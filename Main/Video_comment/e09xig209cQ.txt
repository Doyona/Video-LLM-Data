Зубная паста Дьявола на самом деле то же самое, что и знаменитый эксперимент Зубная паста Слона, только выполненный с более высокой концентрацией перекиси водорода . В этом случае [Integza] использует 50% перекись водорода в сочетании с перманганатом калия в качестве катализатора.  да это рецеп дьяволсклй пасты

The thing I appreciate most about this whole video, is the fact that he brought Fletcher back in, so Fletcher didn't lose his world record, he became part of the new one instead. That's deeply considerate.

Seeing the slip n slides in this video made me think, what if there was something that could perpetually propel you along the slip n slide until you hit the pool? Maybe something that could also launch you out like an ejector seat?
The way you make it look so fun, the perfect level of enthusiasm. You've earned a subscriber.
Love it

This is amazing

I feel like the next one he does of one of these would probably be something like "Worlds Largest Devil's Toothpaste Volcano", it'd be much like a baking soda volcano except with devil's toothpaste and of course, larger than normal ones.

Алах Акбар! Вот как надо работать.)
well, there are two major arguments for altruism (being kind / helpful). 1.) Evolutionary: while being selfish appears to be more selfserving, the fact that the vast majority of people are at least somewhat inclined to help each other proves without doubt, that genes and  instinctual behavior survived a lot more than not. 2.) Logical: If you are kind and friendly to your surrounding, your surrounding is a lot more inclined to be helpful to you. That is how any living creature works, so its not even human psychology, but something a lot lot more basic.   Karma might be an illusive concept, but causality itself kinda picks up where our wishes for karma are lacking.

Hi
Hi
Maybe the floor stayed there because you used Elephant Toothpaste instead of Devil’s Toothpaste. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
You are great for creating so many meaningful things for the children and those who helped you do it.
"You got me once, elephant's toothpaste! You don't get me twice!"  Spoken like a true scientist, Mark. Like a true scientist.

13:18 if you look closely some of the elephant Toothpaste leaked out the side.   It’s crazy because that flask is solid steel. So it really shows how much pressure the toothpaste has.
Amazing to how European kids having so much fun while we are in Asia getting taught how to work for Europeans at out birthday. So nc.

That volcano scene with all the spectators, I don't know why, but it reminded me of the final scene of the movie Real Genius (1985).

Devils toothpaste or do you even know what that was real can I have some devils
Bro what are all these comments
Why does the McDonald’s  krool games grimace shake page link to this video as its science button.
You should put devil toothpaste in the flask
Ordinarily I’m an “eww children” type of person, but even I can’t deny how dang wholesome Brody and Fletcher’s videos are!!
grimace approved.
devils nuke ???
That is nearly as tall as a wind turbine, or the statue of liberty. I just gained a whole new appreciation of just how tall this world record is
Next up: Mark Rober builds a space station and brings life to mars
in a very sad world, you made a few people very happy. Not all superheroes wear capes Mark Rober !!
😮
This video kind of annoys me fletcher kinda got more screen time than the person this was done for
sussy baka 🤪
Why is devils toothpaste so satisfying?
11:53 some ones feet xD
Wasn't malk wobler molested by bill Gates?
And I really love your videos😊
I wish I could have done this :(
How did I get here from doing kickflips with Grimace
You should do the world's biggest dry ice volcano.🌋
The way the foam accumulates before falling down at 13:05 is cool
nice party but no very climate respectful with a Jet for a 12 mn travel.
"when life gives you lemons... build a 5 ton flask and blast them to space." These have got to be the best, most inspirational words I have ever heard.
THAT WAS AN AWESOME PARTY (i think) BUT ONE THING MISSING: the vibrating sand
Cleaner: Anddd... the city is finally cleaned..  **The Cleaner Turns around and sees a volcano**  **The Volcano erupts**  Mark Rober: WE FINALLY DID IT!!  Cleaner: You gotta be kidding.. WHY THIS MESS!!!!!!!!!!!
OUTSTANDING "Nuff Said" 😃
Привет
Mark is a Beautiful person ❤
Camera people: we could give you a slo-mo  Mark: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Bro just casually dropped child labor 💀
This guy is a scientist a uncle and amzing photographer
your friend is Mr.Beast😱😲
Wow 🎉🎉
mark you could be a science teacher
Ok but who wouldnt expect mr beast to be friends with him plus they can sound similar
Yup …. New FAVORITE!❤❤❤😅
Heart touching video!
Aaaaa
Mark, In Australia, we say "you're a crazy bastard" which is the highest informal compliment you can receive. I love you so much for this. You have a heart of gold and you are a wonderful person.
Bro i made elephants toothpaste in science class
Loving the kid factor amazingly wonderful it doesnt get better for these sweet kids
Do this with Manganese heptoxide
Way to go Mark, you FINALLY did it. Also what a great mentor you are for all these kiddos.
(:<
ŚÒ È SAD È CHILD DIED
Yeah sure
yo did anyone realize who got out of the mayors car in 12.31 lmao
This is better than Yellowstone And the eruption was as tall as the Vajont Dam Tsunami in Italy
Mark Rober... YOU ARE AN ALLSTAR...!!! The world needs a lot more of you...! Thanks, keep up your awesomeness and go enjoy some nature today...!
Bless those people that helped make those kids days.
If I could just stay in that flask with mark when the world ends, I think I’d be fine
Wow
You are spoiling these kids😂😂😂But still I ❤ your videos!!!😊😊😊
Bro has every catcher unlocked
At this point do we call mark a mad scientist cause these are so extreme
It's giving ada twist scientist
Bro, you are getting arrested for sure for littering😄😄😄
my dream is to have an orby party
Dem Schwachsinn sind nach oben hin keine Grenzen gesetzt.
I love how Mark says"no"😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I love mr beast and mark rober
Take the elephant toothpaste experiment to space station under 0 gravity .
MRBEAST
Imagine doing the elephants toothpaste thing with that flask but with devil’s tooth paste instead. Guesses on how high it might go?
😊
13:02 this quite fitting cuz the drone sounds like an *elephant* and this chemical reaction is called an *elephant* toothpaste
13:01 Ambatukam
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why does the orange vat look like cheddar cheese?
Nice 👍
After an entire day of watching political insanity, I stumbled on this and instantly had my faith in, if not this country, then humanity restored a little. Thanks Mark!
He did😢 😢😢😢😢
THAT WAS AWSOME 😎😎😃😃✔✔
😮
Отморозки
MR BEAST PHONK
Hii
Hii
nice 6-pack Mark!
5:20 sorry mark but i have to agree
I'm an engineer at Electric Boat and I wonder how devil's/elephant's tooth past would look like coming out of a torpedo or missile tube. 🤣
I saw that IRL
How much pollution do you guys think you've been responsible for over the years just for "cool" videos? Just curious if it's even considered.
This shows why America is the strongest nation in the world
POLLUTER
You started your channel when I was born
hi
I love you mark Rober and MrBeast ❤
wow! This is great content! I applaud you for doing a fantastic job!
Wow
I always watch your videos and I am impressed
MR BEAST😮!?
Мамиксу не показывайте только
Вот вам бл.. заняться нечем.
Awesome video
Mark rober I love your videos you're so freaking cool
fkin pollution
YESSSS
Mr beast I agree but the more better thing is that Brody used up his wish and helped a other kids not his self true legend
Watching this in 2023 and i cant wait to see what he does this year
У мамикса лучше
No joke the drone sounded like an elephant
Just recovered you on Discovery Channel. My husband and I have enjoyed you and your science projects. Keep making us laugh and doing the weird stuff. 😂😂🎉🎉
you gave the resipe to devils toothpaste
Ayo was that you mr beast?!❤🎉
flying fome:Ah im flying in the air oh there he is IM COMING TO GET YOU
Mrbeast?
Ummmm

2:33 j’me promène dans mon avion parce que c’est super cool
So cool

Great
But you are so cool I can never. Be like you if you hit 30 mil I will get a tattoo of you
Not cheating just saying
The real fun is time to clean this place up
❤I love your videos
"If only all that stuff that came out of the bottom was actually forced to come out through the top" *Dirty mind activated*
Can i just take a second to thank Mark and his camermen for these BEAUTIFUL shots?!
12:47. You’re welcome.
At 13:19 the pressure in the flask is so high it leaked out the side of the flask
I wanna se 15 tonnes really bad
I love how you do things for Make A Wish kids just because and included Fletcher in on this one! The drone shots were pretty impressive too! Nurk does a fantastic job at FPV.
ujjjjh
How to clean up?
It made an elephant sound too 😂
I dare you to make the world’s tallest car and I’ve also have another idea for those kids make the world’s Bouncy house party
Omg mrbeast
Would it have been harder to bore a hole into the ground or does that not count as a crafted object for the record
Mrbeast!!!
Great content creation and thank you for all the smiles you put on the kids during there worst times in there life.
I really like his videos but he doesn’t know I even exist
@MrBeast you made fun of Rober for being a nerd
Came to  review after seeing your first Discovery channel episode.  Another triumph.  Best f luck with the new show.
Mark you should be a science teacher
Child labour? Like Why
Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances the Beginning
I bet theres some weaponry usage for devil´s toothpaste
=)
Mark can you do that with devils toothpaste😂😮😮😮😮
Foreshadowing 😈
Hi Mr beast
13:30 me after I eat Taco Bell in ohio
Phat Gus is coming to the walnut farm
What impresses me is this guy spent like hundreds of thousands dollar on the pool, the marble pool and the whole Volcano. Basically he spent doing 2 extra things for fun to have a world record. You really do be nice.
i love this video
7:31 *hello.* :D
noice
Mark & MrBeast are best ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Thank you mr
Mark in 5 years time: Okay.. This is the third time we've done this, were going to space in Elon Musks rocket to see how high we can blast elephant toothpaste this time
12:56, this scene is crazy! Same with all the other scenes, well done Mark and his team!
We’d throw a football over the pool for catching
0:06 volcano: slurp
Why did you guys have lifeguards at the pool party?
When is your channels light bulb going to glow
Didn’t you literally just give us the ingredients to devils toothpaste😂
👍 здорово!
Mr. Rober, you give me hope.  Thank you for being one of the lights in an increasingly darker world. May whatever Power you believe in bless you.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Why are you friends with MrBeast?
I heard lethamyr theme song…
mark: "i won't give you the recipie for devils thootpaste" also mark: 8:39
“And now we gotta clean it up”
THAT ISNAMAZING
L brody
4:46
You. Are.  Amazing
This guy has to be the best uncle ever
Mister Land Rober Robed My Mind!
Bro it got way more higher than the camera record..!
Why does the fire in the glove come from below?
hmm great job now make it 10 times bigger for a new record again xD
I love this video
So as it turns out, the pressure in the flask is about  650 PSI  that’s a lot of pressure   So the amount of pressure inside all of the flask would be 100’s of tons (just a guess btw) baybe even 1000. EDIT: now that I re-think this, it would actually be 1000’s of tons. Not hundreds.
Song
Beautiful, thanks.
make it a rocket now
13:02 it even sounds like an elephant
in the blood video with the sharks you said that was the first and LAST time you would ride on a private jet
best friends forever
This is the kindness of a child and Mark.
I wish I can be an engineer like you, I wish😢😅❤🎉
How do you make Elaphint tooth paste
The elephant toothpaste looks like it just threw up everywhere, still cool though
mr beast hoppin on a track
Volcano arapsyon I surprise
Omg mesterbest
Is the rain bow elephant toothpaste  the orange one is popcron I love it yummy🤩
Mark I think I found a Flaw
Get a bigger flask and put way more solution in it you can do better yet this is still amazing you could also close up the whole a little bit
Hi
Devils Toothpaste Indeed
❤
Brunh I❤ u,
How much thrust does the engine produce, never thought toothpaste could be used as propellant
11:53 nice feet pics 😂😂😂
It was 100 m it will just create stream
Very nice of you!
Mark rober
Best
the other kid who got a surprise party the year before watching this 😐
Marks the type of guy who always wins the school science fair
The people there probably wake up every morning wondering if they're gonna witness another epic, record-breaking party. XD
12:52 moment you've all been waiting for
whats the music at 1:41
My chemestry teacher told us that it was the same lol
And thus...earth's day became slightly shorter and if you open a green walnut you know you are part of history.
You had 1 single oversight. It barley came out the sides. just letting you know.
your awesome
bro imagine if a plane flew over at the wrong time
Hmm
I’m in the process of making a 6 ton flask. Should I beat your record or use devils toothpaste and burn my house down?
Is elephant toothpaste safe to touch?
ill won't miss you
Sometimes it looks like he spends more money than Mr Beast
What what… JIMMY
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤😂😂❤❤😂😂😂😂
That is so cool I wish I was there
😂nasa was probably like “Huston what the f***”
I'm gonna say the science is making me cry...yeah the science
Brody and Fletcher deserve this after what they have gone through.
+ 500 uncle points
hi
Thing doing this in school
this was beaten btw
yall better clean this up
I imagine the nuclear apocolypse. Mark Rober sees the bombs, and instantly runs into his 5 ton mega flask
imagine this stuff would be eatable as food, it would solve world hunger crisis
Give it go it's fine 100👍🤜🤛💯😁 please find attached fc
Spectacular display
💗 love your engineering
Mark Rober is the guy who inspires me to become a scientist and mechanic
Don't really have to worry about anyone breaking your record for highest devil's toothpaste, if you won't share the ingredients. Seems like Guinness book we have a problem with that
250FT? wow
12:54
Ok but can we talk about how those kids have the best corre memories now? Especially Brody, knowing sombody somebody would  go thru that much for him. Such a cool guy:D
holy smokes that is insane
Your mates with Mr beast!? I love you and him!
Terrifying about the purple color. Just makes one wonder about all the stuff you put in your body
11:47
i love how he gave someone a wold record then took it a year latter
I wish he was my uncle because I would ask him to do this
Grutties
Bloody feeling much better now
Mark brain is bigger than a scientist brain
This guy is the coolest person on earth
Imagine it went up 10 km
that party looked so fun! here in the UK it isnt really that sunny. i wish i had a pool like that so i could habe fun too
Wow cool poison the earth for a video! 🖕

How is your Favorite YouTuber?
12:51
Polluter! one more fungicide
I love these videos! I’m kinda a YouTuber I got inspired to make videos from u!
The title was wrong. Mark Rober and his entire team did it. Let's give credit to the people who made this happen
What mrbest chatid
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
can you touch elaphent toothpaste?  dont ask why i wanna know
Made me cry!
Mark if YOU and your team discovered devils toothpaste check the chemical formula to see if it's a completely new discovery
R you nic
What an awesome amazing day for a boy who deserved it!
if u get in does it hurt
13:00 -->when hulk cums.😅😅
OMG💖😍
I LOVE YOR video's. 😍😍😍
Mark Rover has swelled the elethant toothpaste on the gloves palm side but why did I saw the first fire in the in the opposite side?
You should watch backyard scientist on Devil's toothpaste
27 cuts in 20 seconds build seconds
how high do you think elephant toothpaste can lift a 1 ton structure
Make it but we’re thousand or 100 feet in there
nice
"A generous benefactor let us borrow their private jet" MrBeast: "No problem Mark"
You have DONE AN AMAZING JOB
4:33 dude that looks like nitric acid, that makes me pretty sure devils toothpaste is just normal elephant toothpaste with nitric acid as the catalyst
Omg

Somebody knows how to make devils toothpaste
When it played the 20 second build montage, it sounded like cult 45
id say that is 8 yards i think maybe not
He digs way to many pool
party and the volcano:9% of the video edits:90% of the video MR BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST: 1% of the video
At this point with people topping each other on this record, they’re practically going to be building bombs lmao
My birthday is on June 19th
Devils toothpaste powered rocket
did he seriously credit himself in his own video? the dedication between him and his hims.
Omggggggggggggggggggggg
Love the video this was probably the most awesome thing I've ever seen but I have a question is Brody better or not it was kind of vague on that detail just asking you don't have to answer
U made it Pay it forward .... Thank U
13:01: bro even the drones were exited
BrO i WaNt yOu tO bE mY unCle :,) BuT iM aT pHiliPines

How in the world do you clean all of the elephant toothpaste
LOVE YOU
Videos like these restore my faith in humanity
Where is Brody now? How is he recovering?
こんにちはビーストさん
"the force pushing all the elephants toothpaste out the top is about 50 times the force you feel when pushing a fully inflated football" sigh ...
♻️?
Awesome and I appreciate the town for giving us an excellent experience on that and thanks to Mark and everyone that helped out!

OMG😱bru
I wish I had a party like that
"I won't give you this instructions to make one" 8:39
Brody deserved this so much!
If one day Batman exist, we all know it's Mark 😅😅
Isn't the devil's toothpaste just using 90+% peroxide, which you can't really get without a license anyway, since it's for rocket science?
epic
What would happen if you did the same thing with Devils Toothpaste?
Este  video"   Es  asombrosa ♡♡♡
Und wer räumt das weg? 😂😂
WHO IS DALE AND WHY DID YOU INTRODUCE HIM LIKE HES FAMOUS
...hmmm... your 1. volcano popped up 5 feet / 1,5m... how high whould the volcano go up in the sky powered by elefants toothpaste...? ;-)
Rip his garden 💀
That is amazing looks like a real volcano 🌋

The neighbours:
1: this is sooooo awesome!! 2: this flask was made better than the last model, because it's metal and concrete compared to wood
The military should use devil’s toothpaste in wars or whatever :)
Whitest video I've ever seen on yt.
this guy probably has one of the least hateful fanbases in the world.
Title: Largest Elephant Toothpaste 13:01 *elephant noises*
Do not want to be that guy but it shows smth that we rather spent on making parties then actually saving lifes.
The best part of giving isn't receiving something in return... it's the GIVING part which fills your soul
0:20 Even though I know this footage is 100% real... my mind keeps thinking it's just bad CGI 😅
mr beast mr bust
Di negara kita, ini disebut "Masa kecil kurang bahagia", 😁, gw dari negara mana coba.... 🤭

Bro created a whole volcano In a back yard, legend

Why does this always happen in rainbow things the warmer colors are bigger than the darker colors. The red was bigger than all of them.
Thanks for ecology…   A private jet really….

I love your Videos of so amazing I love them!!!!!
Devils toopaste would be a horrifying chemical weapon that could in favorable conditions could set fire across fire a field
When I the last volcano erupt I did not expect how much would come out of the ground I thought much more will come out of the top
I want to give mark rober the best engineer award!
❤
7:13 car model?

I wish I could be at that party...
😮
The yellow looks like scrambled eggs
I am guessing it was Mr. beast's private jet.

I watched this last year as a class. Great times...
I thought it was a devis elephant volcano lol 😂
Why watermark it tho
👍👍
+1 uncle point
It's just higher concentrate H2O2 isn't it?
Rober and Mr. Beast totally didn't hunt down the person who stole the ATV and drown in them in an orbeez pool...
mr best is your friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I must say, child labour is the best when they cooperate, saying from experience
mark your funny
Absolutely correct mark rober and MrBeast    🤩👏
Now I’m just jealous
I love how he just spends so much time just for a 17 minute video and also a party

😭😭😭😭
At 9:46 I had to hear mark do his Tarzan scream for like ten seconds
Devil tooth paste. executed with higher concentration hydrogen peroxide

world's beddest channel
If you won't give me the devil's toothpaste recipe, I'LL FIND IT MYSLEF!
Happy Birthday Brody!
What if this was devils toopthpaste?
I can relate
I would take mark rober as my uncle everyday
Now you just gotta turn it sideways and sell it for potential in military applications lol Or mount it sidways to a go-kart and see how fast you can accelerate XD
That was Fun!!!
Vip
love how he just plasters is yt only on the deviltoothpaste parts
Mark is the best person ever
I might make A elephants toothpaste experiment
Maybe i will have a birthday like this one day maybe when i become 11 next year.
Mark:I am very picky on my topics Also mark:I am going to make the stuff which through the bottom,through the top  😂 LOL 😂
Same mrbeast beast you better then mark Robert not by much though
When life gives you a chemical weapon, Make a party!
10:03 LAVA!
10:00 looks like hollow knight's corruption or something
That was just amazing I think that people need to watch this to see that they can be as kind as you and I wish I could have that :( no worries :)
Holy s*ht
surprised that mr beast has an iphone 11
Even if you don't give out the devil's toothpaste formula there will be those who will literally devote their lives to figuring it out and then give it out there is no hate here I want to know what it is too but think about it even if they give it out it's not your fault is it
I have a quad like that! I absolutely love it!
Move over “Make-A-Wish Foundation”
You did it!!!!!     I bet someone is gonna comment 'We did it...'
came to see something cool, stayed because you wonderful person made me cry ❤
It's raining Chemicals!
Every elephant toothpaste video. =  Elephant earth paste
Yea yea yea
When I get sad... I just think of this milestone of all of our lives
11:24 lol bottem text is awsome
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you
Just watching this makes me jealous.
If only life was this fun
What do you get when you cross a snoman and a vampire?    Frost bite.
Calm down Mr beast
13:01 Yellowstone
when your experiment goes farther then a camera from space
If you do blue one in a hall way it would look like a sinking ship And you have dummy’s running away with camera pointed At the dummy’s
mark you are so cool

Why don’t they use this stuff in the military 😂
Who is next,angles

Taco bell (:
Im kidding mrbeast😂
Poggers
AND WHO DOSENT KNOW MARK ROBER HE IS ONE OF THE CHANELS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS
i have a question why is the devils toothpast formula sound like a blowtorch
do another one but upside down so its like a giant rocket
Albert Einstein + MrBreast = Mark Rober
I Love You
bro really said +1 uncle points
Seeing fully grown teenagers and adults having such childish fun is so wholesome to me. ;D
Do the elephant toothpaste except with devils toothpaste(you’ll need to make it a lot stronger)
we need a video all about Nirk the drone pilot
I love your vid❤
Wait was that Grandpa???
Watching this after a year made me think of the question, what was the aftermath of the metal flask?
This is Awesome
who is paying for this?
So cool
this reminds me of one of those 4K videos you see on a TV at a best buy 9:55       edit: yup, one of those
Who is waiting for devils toothpaste giant flask
I don’t know why i think brody sounds like brodyanimates
If mark was a real doctor, he would probably be everyones favorite... Because of looks and how he talks
U do realize u just gave away the formula to devils toothpaste
They say that steel flask was brought by area 51
This guy makes me jealous
Impressive work for those children!  You say the pressure is 50 times of that of a football... so that makes about 650 PSI or 45 Bar or 450 metric tons per square meter. Your flask is certainly built well and strong but I doubt that reading was correct...  ;-)
yay the devils toothpaste recept
I love how he posted a day before my birthday!
This is what a swim party is supposed to be like.
Mr beast I love you and Mark rober
You’re the best nasa sientist and best uncle!
all fun and games till mark teams up with hacksmith.
Legend says that the bird flying by at that moment never made it back home...😞
Bro me watching the video in 2022 and thinking about Kamara who isn’t allowed to play
Cuanta pasta se se gasto en este esperimento para que cuando vas a comprar no hay por que alguien se los llevo todos y ese no es el problema estamos mal gastando las cosas solo por diversion y no estamos viendo el proceso que se lleva estos materiales.

Ok I’m not joking but my teacher main thing she teaches is science and she fr said I’m gonna put on my favorite scientist and everyone in class said “Bill nye?!” And she said no and played this video was not expecting this it was a cool vid though
The flask work like a rocket engine. Even with the open top there would be quite a bit of upward force generated .

How much pressure was in that thing exactly... I can't find how much pressure is there when kicking a football😂
NOBODY (MARK)
what if you made a devil's toothpaste flask?
I love all your videos
Mark was louder than the Microphone
Hi mr beast
Now imagine if they built that 584 ft tall. That would be an unbreakable elaphant toothpaste world record. 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Mark this is great. You are a great guy. I am an exec here in Silicon Valley and have helped start some pretty cool companies. I wish I had found you earlier I would have pitched in funds for stuff like this for sure. Unfortunately, I am leaving for my new home in Miami area. I run global cyber intelligence and criminal investigations for a big financial service. I'd have really loved to have met you and been part of this effort. I wish you the very best.
Put devil toothpaste in front of all the doors and trap yourself in inside
Can you brush your teeth with it
Mark, I know that mixing the hydrogen peroxide and the potassium iodide solution fast and thoroughly is crucial - could you actually try to mix the two liquids using some kind of pintle injector or similar like in a rockt engine? Would this drastically improve the "performance" of the toothpaste or would it be barely noticable?
I FREAKEN LOVE YOU MARK!!!!!!!!
I’m literally laughing so hard on Mark Roberts Scream
Dude it just like volcano erupts
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Just... WOW!!!!!!
😎 cool
bruh guy looks like seth mcfarlane...
Why didn’t the blue one and a purple and explode
if only this could be my birth day Lol
When will you make a devils Toothpaste Rocket

Mr Beast: He probably doesn’t tell us how to make devils toothpaste so we can’t beat his record
I love  your  videos
Private jet, spilling chemicals everywhere, driving a car powered by lithium batteries... nice

Now do the same thing with Devils toothpaste
Amazing video
I wish something like this would happen to me but it just won’t because no one will see this comment because there are 32k other comments
Thanks for letting me share science with my kids, a modern Mr. Wizard :)

Mark’s next tooth paste: DRAGONS TOOTHPASTE
Huh? I wonder why did they use Foam Daddy
11:42 looks like a movie outro
2  of those boxes weren't working but great video
R.I.p money or energy Beacuse da car got covered in da begining
I have a genuine question. So what would happen if he made to hole to the flask smaller? Cuz If I remember correctly back from my school days. My science teacher told our class. A tsunami gets its pressure when coming up on the land, because the path for the water to travel is narrower. Please someone correct me if I’m wrong.  But with all that, would it have gone further in the sky if he made the flask opening smaller? Im just genuinely curious.
The scariest thing I just realized is that, the formula for devil's toothpaste could be a military weapon...
13:43 sooo, how much is that in psi?
I subed
Rark Mober
Can you use it for toothpaste tho?
This is truly amazing.
The drone operator did a fantastic job. Nice going Mark R.
13:05 bro the mf droe celebrated too 😂😭
The elephant toothpaste reached build limit💀💀
ila does not deserve anything
I know how to make devils toothpaste
Mark Rober  that is so cool
I agree
Step 1 is to kidnap 4 kids and then take them on a private jet and then party and then surprise them with toothpaste
Where do you get you potassium iodide
what does this do to the environment
I love crying

How do you do this stuff??.
When you said 20 second montage It was a 30 sec second montage
he should do it with devils tooth paste.
Life as a mess and life is life you can’t think about that but life is still life:)
10:03 Looks like LAVA!
2:54
The formula is baking soda mixed with water with hydrogen per peroxide mix with East then just put potassium iodide it on that mix and then you get devils toothpaste and do use the same three ingredients for that flaming glove
Bro u came to my city and I’m pretty sure you met a girl named bri it was her grandfathers orchard
I love your videos and how you have a big heart and help peoples dreams come true  like the kid in this video.
knox4 is the secret ingredient and or highly concentrated peroxide
Are you Fukien kidding me Jimenez
How do u know MrBeast
The foam gun was called the foam daddy
take that boy to a mud park hed be just as happy!
even the drones were celebrating
wow
You know it's serious when the build montage is 20 seconds rather than 10
1:34 what about phat gus' farm?
Im haha geez how much it coust 9,0000£
Your too late Batman!
after one year he got 30,666,860 views and that is amazing
One of the best ytbers, respect i love the fact that u can make kids very happy,i wish i meet u one day❤️
it's a cj4!!!
You should’ve gave the record to yourself
I thought MrBeast Hated you but I guess not
Can you make one of devil’s toothpaste
to all the aot fans out there  wanna know whats sad?  if you dont, do not press "Read More           The expirement is taller than the collosal titan
How do you win a world record using a secret formula? That pretty much guarantees no one else can try and beat it.
Omg mr best
Now do this with devil's toothpaste!     Just kidding, I think that would be explosive....
Love it
The whole thing was moving!!!... the LIES one...
Wait so u basically got rid of one kid's world record and got some other kid a world record lol
Great. Just great.
So cool
Omg
His neighbours hate him
Video idea: how high can you launch something with elephants toothpaste
13:00 no wonder why it’s called elephant toothpaste (because of the noise)
Okay, but now I kinda wanna see the foam go through a whole oversized alembic system. Watching it go through curly-cue pipes and flasks and such. It'd be neat.
Wait, How high can devils toothpaste go?
me to mrbeast
13:14 is it just me or was that the music from when you get knocked out in steep
Did you figure out the forces involved to be sure your rig could hold itself to the ground? I won't understand but come on dude, show your math! 😉😜🤣
i like the fact that he added +1 uncle points
Who Will clean this up? Is it ok for the environment??
Ivory soap?
yesssssssssss
Did mrbeast kiss you
The elephant tooth paste sort of sounds like an elephant
Mark you are the one the only Kindest person alive
When life gives you lemon You throw a party for a amazing kid 🎉

MARK IS AWESOME!!!  BRODY REALLY DESERVED THIS! THIS REALLY IS AWESOME!! THANK YOU FOR THIS!
I love your videos!!
I
what about this year
Is he aware that he just gave out the devils tooth paste recipe?
What if they put something covering the flask at the top and see what happens
Huh what if a bird was up there and got sniped by that elephant's toothpaste stuff
I love these kinds of videos
I watch your videos and I am your biggest fan !!!!!!!!!!
Mark: *sends a bunch of chemicals into the sky* Everyone: WOAAH The Environment: *cough cough* *COUGH*
Cool !!
Just a normal day for mark rober
The orange look like pizza cheese
alternate title: Mark redoes the 1800's
Your videos are wonderful!  I laugh, I cry, I learn, I’m awed…  💖 love all you do for humanity.
Hi
I have lost count how many times I've come back to watch this video, especially when I'm feeling down, you may not be a doctor but you do make thousands, if not millions of people feel just that little happier, well done to you & your team & the people you support.
Mans almost reached the Minecraft build limit
I found out about why the purple one was you know:the purple food coloring probably used potassium permeganate wich can also act as a catalyst
Awesome video, I’m just wondering why he didn’t write “We finally did it” bc I thought he worked with a team of people/friends?
Amazing .
What amazes me is that "the town welder" was using any kind of protective equipment at all.
*Hey, whats that in the sky?*
team elephant blasting of again [pokemon refrance]
13:01 that sounds like a siren
10:06 I have a new wallpaper
are we gonna talk how he used child labor lol
Mark I have a Question. What is Your Main theme song called?
For the purple trough, would of it been possible to put the food coloring in with the catalyst or would that also cause a premature reaction?
10:00 my toilet after I eat Taco Bell be like.
hi youtube    hi
😎😎😎😎😎😊😚
You are using your great powers with GREAT responsibility, Mark Rober. Well done!
I LOVE YOUR VIDS MARK ROBER

I wish i had a private jet.
he won't tell us the way to make devils tooth paste so we can't beat his record
I wonder how higher it would have gone had you used the purple food color compared to the green food color?  Would it haven't gone higher than 25ft?
Where do you find the space to do this? Lol
i want to be bfffffffs
This is so kind to do for someone
Nice

I feel like if he shot that at Godzilla it would hurt him
You could show Elon Musk something about space flight.
is it just me or is brody fine, i need is snap asp
We love you
POV: *You Saw It*  *Thinking it was Aliens*
Me if I was Mark: “Alright guys! Pour the cement on the flask, then put the metal on!”
I get jelly when ever I watch one of these
Mark Rober be taking away everybody's records like "😃."
How do you make devil's toothpaste
Who is flying the drones? They are amazing!
Nice one!
FOAM DADDY??!!
I would seriously be okay with my kids science teachers showing them these videos every single day and calling it class.
This is amazing!!!!
Here's an idea, try next time to mix the blue and red instead of just plain purple dye since it has some ingredient to not have that same and sad reaction of it bursting at ramdom, it will take longer yes but it will be more trusty thats 4 sure
The cinematic montages are just *ludicrous* !
13:11 pov reactor #4
You are so cool with that one thing and that's elifint toothpaste.
Omg it’s me.meast
6:05 he reused the same audio as the last one
i hope these 2 kids has the best live and they truly deserve it
Cool I wish I was in there
Fun fact: that sounds like an elephant
17 minutes of gigachad energy

I feel like I'm being nitpicky but the green just isn't as cool looking lol
I love crafting
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH

No one talking about how fletchers sister is a baddie

At 5:52 I have known you when I was 5
I’m waiting for the next one
I swear he gave away the devils toothpaste ingredients
I had a meteor shower this night
Every time I watch one of these videos I get jealous
The toothpaste coming out of the flask sounded like an elephant
Mark in a nutshell: Mind of a genius Heart of gold Master of surprises Mediocre impressions

@12:46
.......................................
Now make an elephant's toothpaste rocket, all the way to space
What a kid, It's been a long time on YT since I felt hollow hearing something like that.  Bless him!  My mate is a C survivor, His make a wish was to have some warhammer figures fully painted....Sadly the local he got to do the painting used it for drugs and never did it. I don't even think my mate got the figures back!
Mark really didn’t mess around on this one O-O
The video: 12:52
romigrnis dood
dood
Did you say walnut tel the squirrels don even sink about it
WWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW
Now make a Elephants toothpaste rocket.
Mark would do all of this stuff anyways...but then somebody was like, "Why don't we film this so we can do MORE cool stuff?"
A lot of fun was had in this one
Mark is so inspiring
Mark, any kid should consider themselves lucky to have a friend like you.
Simply awesome.
I wish I could meet you but I am in Australia
10:08 looks like flaming hot Cheetos
Mr.Beast is a YouTuber
Mark should give us the Devil's Toothpaste recipe.
I like how fletcher was happy to basically lose his world record to give it to Brody even though he would lose it nice guy
👌👍👍👍
Bird almost got fried
Can’t believe you got salty to nick unhas
Brody's pretty cool, but Fletcher's the goat
13:16 I could set this as my phone wallpaper 😁
Hate fakers.
Hi Mark, I really truly appreciate the work you do. Most kids these days grow up hating science (because of their not do flattering learning experience in school). I hope videos like yours re-kindle children's interest in science.
Mark robber is not givng out the recipie for devils Tooth paste hé shows how the boxes are Made Ty now i know how to make it :>
Iii
What the f***
Mr  beast
What the heck
Hmm all I see is me after Taco Bell
Lets not forget you told us the recipe for the devils tooth paste

Only questions are: 1.  Who’s the lucky kid gonna be in 2022 and 2.  Is Fat Gus’s gonna get another dope ride to those nuts!
So beautiful!  Thank you so much for all the joy and satisfaction you bring to so many people!
This video Migth just be my favorite video ever out of the whole yt

How about some videos on how you clean up these giant messes you create for your youtube channel?

This was the most wholesome thing just for one person.   This made my tears even cried
Nice, but do they clean it up afterwards? 😅

Keep up the fight Brody! You got this.
I wish i could have an uncle like you, mark. Or at least be involved in such an awesome thing

You know you’ll have to do this with Devil’s toothpaste now.
It was a very interesting and entertaining video 👌🏿👌🏿
This was posted on my birthday lol
The best!
The private jet is a Cessna citation
Perfect
13:10 volcanic eruption
Mhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh veryyyyy interesting.
"50 times the force of pushing against a football" Americans will use anything but the metric system to measure... anything. And for anybody wondering, 250Ft is about 72M.
Mrbeast chill
the voice crack at the start lol
I like your Videos
I love how he does team seas and team trees, but he creates a biohazard of chemicals onto grass!
It sounds like a elephant screaming
So is brody and fletcher gomma go back and forth having a war for the record now
Awesome
day 500 of trying to find devils toothpaste formula: i hacked in to his cctv cameras and he watches amogus sim 2022 for hours on end
Bro u should  of put some super glue on it to hold it down
Ok this is awesome, but I keep worrying now what the heck is in the purple food color and do I want to eat anything purple ever again?
I like the BGM of this video soo much
10:00 firbiden lesanya.
This Is awesome
What if he did that with devils toothpaste
How do you even keep track of how high it went?
Cooooooool
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why does the 20 second build montage song remind me of corn on the cob?
Mark and everyone celebrating:  The manikin:AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
There is still no one talking about that one dude literally standing in the middle of boiling hot elephant toothpaste
Yo thanks Jeff
quick question:  how do you dispose of such quantities of elephant’s toothpaste
if its 2x as big and 5x as strong then its like 1.25x stronger
you know what imma watch the sponsor just for u
I'm not crying. You're crying.
If you do another devils toothpaste thing you should put it inside a house and then set it off.
What bollox. Private jet out of your budget. How gullible you think we are?
You need to give the devils toothpaste formula to the millitary
I love your  video
Hola I’m American
Ты рус
Well that was mildly amusing.
M m. M :
Rober really seems like the nicest guy ever.
Foam: Engulfed. 8:07
this video is insane
You need to do it with devals toothpaste
When you think about it, mark rober just made a secret formula.
Like that , wow nice color
Mr. beast and Mark Robert I am big fan

4:19 The scream ☠

Mark Rober  :What Do You Do With Lemons?  The Kids: Eat Them!       Mark Rober: No , The Answer Is Build A 5 Ton Flask And Blast Them To Space
Why did you say it burns gloves that mean it's just has 50prcent hydrogen procide

Grat video
Am I the only one who us worried of getting rhe trees filled with it?
15:07 That is a 2019 SpartanMotors Fire engine with about 1800 gallons of Water. The other truck looks lieka newer american La'france ladder truck with about 500 gallons.
Perfect 😍
This was AWESOME! 🤩🥳
It’s the plus one uncle point for me

Make more of this is  satisfying
That looks so cool if I were you I would jump in the elephant toothpaste

Everyone who knows Mark Rober is so lucky!!!!!
E
Did i see bill gates?
no manequins were  harmed in the making of this video.
WHAT A BLAST!!! Congrats Rober!
Imagine they forgot to record
I love it
Watching this video after the video about his son being on the autism spectrum and honestly Mark seems to be "mentally different" as well...just not in a way that most would consider "bad". Because how many people do you know that would come up with the ideas that he does and also implement them?
Wow amazing 😲😎✌️ cola+ mentos fans be like😁😲😊😂😂✌️ yeahhhh
Literally I know when you give kids paint they make a masterpiece of a mess and I see a very messy piece of art of a Mark Rober.

I’m new to watching your content and so far absolutely loving it! Have you considered (or already made a video about) purposely propelling the flask or some other vessel with elephant or devil’s toothpaste? It would make for a very colorful rocket video
Tfw when u get a tactical nuke:

We can all agree that mark rober is the best uncle ever
You are an amazing person Mark
Mark: shoots elephant toothpaste. Birds:A YO WHAT THE FU

Now you said you were never going to ride on a private jet before now look
Another world record bites the dust
Oh no They came
But after the party dont you need to clean up
Wow it's so high it reach the build limit
Bro
devils toothpaste is still just peroxide and soap but with a stronger more volatile catalyst, potassium iodide sorry mark you can delete my post but for the sake of science that's the difference. kids don't make devils toothpaste, elephant toothpaste is just as cool and you don't risk serious injury.
Amazing videos!
I love this video

major respect to those welders. even did the mark rober logo. rad welders!
The new type of firework
Such a wholesome video that's awesome.
Why the freaking purple food coloring exploded it is because you have to get a certain snail and crush about like a thousand of them 10,000 of them just to get an ounce of purple natural coloring that's the same reason there's no purple on any flags cuz it's hard to get natural purple dye
Eggs

To mark, you should maybe try putting the flask in the ground. The ground would not allow it to spill through the sides. It might go a bit higher and maybe break a world record? Try it with devils toothpaste and elefants toothpaste. Thanks.

Love you Mark
fletchers sister bad asf
I have always wanted to meet
I Komintet chebceu euch eiichd chudeèt ahsnttttttt buüxt  sdds wūbnx 😵
i love your videos so much
another question is what happens when you put devil toothpaste in the giant flask ( maybe with the top closed )
I believe if you have enough money, you can repurpose the flask into a suborbital capsule
DOPE!!!!!
I legit enjoy seeing a whole bunch of 12+ year olds riding in the limo
This is really cool
Noooo, this is too cool for my life
My son and I enjoyed the heck out of this video, thank you kindly!
I’m a big fan
ваууууу😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😮😮😮😮
Wow! Wow! Just amazing!!! Thank you for this wonderful experiment!!! I wish I were your friend  :-)
me: 8:00
nah, its a harmless, green volcano
Mark, THAT was awesome!
Ayo I’m mark
I KNEW IT WAS A LIMO
@4:19 🤣
You made my Day!

it would be cool if you made a 40 foot tall rocket powered by devils toothpaste
You go into Marks channel 2035 and you see a video called ”sending elephant toothpaste to pluto”
create a brazilian channel
Wait is that mark
Wait is that mr beast
Mark, is the typical uncle and friend we could ask for.
I wish I had parents that were cool but I’m great full 🙏

Hi
I woud really like that sort party but i life in netherland so its never gonna happen :(
AMAZING VIDEO I FREAOAEAEEAEOEAKING LOVE YOU
Mr beast needs to get marks camera 😂😂😂
Gridley hella yeahh my home town
He is just using higher concentration of H2O2 to make the devil toothpaste. you CANT easly get 90% H2O2 cus you can make boms with it, you need permits to get 90%.
Send love 💕
Its so cool
well the party before the experiment was much more under whealming compared with fletchers party
Wish I had opportunities to have as much fun as a kid. Unfortunately I come from a continent where the wallets of the politicians is more important than the quality of life of the people
New community open..Come to sell your nft art. Please share!! Welcome to Weemeta world.

That's kinda sus yo
Me as a teen watching this jealous

How are you allowed to do this. I just don’t understand
Space wheee
Wow
The shot out of the air looked  like Voldemort dining.
Yooo mr beast
Mark rober
Mark Robr
"my friend mr. beast" EXCUSE ME WHAT
You are the nicest person in the world
He still basically kidnapped them
When the child was protesting-

Como quisiera que lo pusieras en tu canal de español xd
Mark... we need more people like you :D you are doing so much amazing stuff and make people happy.
"I was following you when i was like.. 6." take it out of context and it has a WHOLE NEW MEANING
Q
i love this but i cant help but realise there is no diversity in this video they are all white people
Congrats!
I knew that he would say private jet
2007 Nickelodeon: *heavy breathing*
wow. that was a beautiful story.
Love watching this stuff, you give me some great inspiration for my small channel to grow one day. Thanks so much for sharing these great science experiments! :)
tahts so cool
o
That was like a world record of elephent tooth pased🤣.
When lemons explode in a flask, you have to run
I wish I could be in the party but I'm in nz😔😔😔
I've been watching your videos for quite a while now, from France (since I'm french I guess that makes sense). Every single time, I'm sincerely amazed by how generous, kind and loving it seems you are. Plus, the science part is cool, obviously. ;)  Keep it up !
The house just got a toothpaste shower
imagin someone uses this to lock someone to their house
You’re a beast rober we love you dawg thanks for showing us greatness
So is this what happens when you have too much money
Ay you broken the record 3xs
You should be a scientist
Hi I am big fan and I love the stuff you make
YOUR TOO LATE BATMAN IV ALREADY FILLED THIS COMICALLY LARGE FLASK WITH 10 WEEKS OF JOKER COOM
so AMAZİNG!!!!!!!
C'mon. 60ft to 250ft is not "nearly a factor of 5." It's a factor of 4.17.
Explosive diahria be like
I like the first gut that did the elephant toothpaste stuff, Nick Uhas
I love how you did it Mark Rover I’m very proud of you I love you Our love your videos
If you see cops in the future with glitter all over them. You know who they arrested 🤣 or they stole it themselves
Too much fun!!!!!!😁
Can we just appreciate how Genius Mark Rober is.
Never stop doing what you do, simply fantastic
deez
Super cool love it
Hi MrBeast
HUMAN!?!?!!?!?!?
My best friend was a St.Jude patient to
OH
Great video 👍👍👍🇺🇸
:)
Wait, it isn't 5 tons. It would be 85. Because if you go back, he says this: " With a total clamping force, Of 80 tons. " Plus, the flask, so it would now be 85 tons.
I'm not crying, you're crying
Insane and amazing stuff! But how is all the foam cleaned up, is it non toxic, biodegradable etc? Keep up the awesome work! 👌 😉
Wow
Big brain
THAT WAS SO BEATIFUL
The people at the bottom😬😓😰😭😶💀
Mark rober me and my friend mark want to meet you
U  le pointzzzz
You are amazing
This is amazing! Have you thought about using a de laval nozzle to increase the velocity of the elephant toothpaste to achieve a even higher altitude? I think with your experience at NASA this is feasible.  Thanks for the great content and inspiration you give us.
That was so nice 👍
Science? Ahhhhhh
Omg 140f
Helo
Now this is nice
mark has inspired me to be a engineer when i go to college
How come MrBeast hasn't reacted to this?
Nooooooooooooo
Unas preguntas cuántas progektos as echo
Miss our country that would act like that back in my day, thx mark
Mark can turn imagination into... reality.
Mark Rober is an absolute legend.
am i the only one thinking how it must pollute the land around so hard ? Im sure that they found squirrels with 3 heads hanging around few days later
Remember guys, act like we've done this before! I love it!!!
This is the kind of stuff that makes me wanna be Mark’s nephew
3.0???
YES SIR
YES SURW
Mark Rober you are my idol!
When leth’s intro song played I was like “hold up”
O
The Devils Toothpaste in front of the house reminded me about the time when Mr. Beast filled one of his friends houses with elephants toothpaste.
I love you mr beast
"It's not a mistake"✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE*✨
This almost makes me jealous, then I realized "Oh yeah, all I do is play video games all day, well it is what it is"
BRA
Yeah
E
imagine living a life where you can do  experiments like this and enjoy your life just how you want
Honestly I wish I had my birthday party like that…
;( I want to come
Mr beast I am  a fan
to be honest its like ur flexing
chat ded
lol
This warmed my heart
If I'm guessing the catalyst for devils toothpaste is manganese oxide
The kid’s reaction to all of this : wow 😀
Finally your own flask didnt broke on devils toohpaste is broken
That's kinda sad but also cool that Fletcher took his sister with.
Dude that was the most beautiful elephant tooth paste like that was amazing
I wish I was at the party :(
That thing like nuclear power
I’m impressed your friends with Mr.beast :^
More like launched into the sky. Far from into space lol.
This Is Amazing!
S-o he Lefter NASA FOR this
Hmmmmmm
Jj
Restarting faith in humanity one project at a time
Was mr Beast the benefactor?
.0.
you're amazing mark
I didn't know you were friends with Mr. Beast
Imagine saying no to the party then seeing this
I think it's safe to call you and American treasure Mark 👍
I think we have all adked our selfs how much money does it cost to make these videos?
Hi
Oh my gosh that is so happy
a Tyrannosaurus Rex is heavy... But 80 Tons are even heavier.
i think that mark could make a roller coaster
What if you added orbeez to the mix of regular elefants toothpaste?
Hi
Have you noticed that Mr.Beast commented?
I like you more Grover
Lovely
The drones are so fast
Mr.Beast your my fan ayyyyy looooooveeee youuuuuuuu

Is Your Truck Okay After That First One?
you made me cry with joy
You made the best surprise Birthday party Mark i love the part of the your new elephant toothpaste world record keep going you are doing a great job for people.👍👌
Very simple question
Try a longer and thinner barell and it will increse by a few feet. Sorry for my english
"50 times pushing against a fully inflated football" Do we get a real number?  Football pressure is about 13 PSI, so 650 psi in the flask?
When anything happens the world has Mark Rober to help us
That’s so sweet your know one of my most amazing YouTubers ever ! 🥰🤩
My parents are fighting currently and your videos are always a way to get away from everything
10:02 felt like being born

31 second
I love you guys. Mark Rober may be the most genuinely selfless individual individual, that I've had the honor of watching. Plus I absolutely love just how passionate you are about science in general. You may in fact be the future generation's best hope for a better life on this planet.
Why is it called elephant toothpaste
mark made a diy tornado made of elephant toothpaste
This video is Criminally Underrated
Pollution
An amazing and moving video, thank you mark!
Past mark: this is my last time  going to Bahamas in privet jet  No one:this trip

YOUR VIDS ARE AMAZING
"Look at the house, you cant even see it!" Mark Rober 2k21
MR. BEAST!!!
i hate when my wife cuts onions when i'm watching your video
Question, how would this look in space? Since there is no gravitational pull, would the reaction work? And if so, would the solution of the mixture go in one direction from all the pull, or when reaching an opening would it split in all directions?
Hi,
I haven't really had a proper party in 2 years :(
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...................?.. Jose
Nailed it !
why The record is not mentioned in Guinness Book of World record
hmmm... that flask reminds me of something.... a command pod from N A S A
Think about it. Money can buy entretainment.
Person who does not know about this looks out window:what the heck is happening over there
When life gives you elephant toothpaste ,build a 10ton flask,25ft and blast it into space
When life
I picked Johnathan Taylor in the first Round, I think I win Mark
How do you dispose of it all?
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,,,,,,,OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
I wonder how much elephant toothpaste Elon musk could make. Enough to cover an entire US state?
It looks like a Gemini Program style capsule
A janitor worst nightmare
That is so touching.
Your an awesome human being
Fletcher* i knew it was a limbo, XDXD
13:11
How high can you launch the container
It always makes my day a happier one when I see people doing these types of things :) Thank you for a great year Mark Rober!
Amazing green volcano
Everyone think fletcher was salty
Very Very cool.
Why did I think of the twin towers when I saw the devils toothpaste
Hello beast and Mark rober
ago fletchers sister kinda bad
Mark! you should totally make a ping pong ball that you can control by moving your paddle! i know nothing about engineering or anything but watch your videos for the fun! I don’t know if this is possible! but just saying i think you should give it a shot.
Ur so awsome im a fan of ur vids!
you have to stop. This is getting into nuclear reactor territory
Lionel Messi
I love you Mr beast big fan
I want you to come to Georgia
How
can we pls pay respect to the guy at 7:44 that was plasting white stuff out of a canon named "daddy"
These kids don't deserve it , change may mind!!!

8:28 thats where you started your idea
An adult helper Safety glasses ½ cup hydrogen peroxide 1 packet of dry yeast (or 1 tablespoon) Dish soap Plastic water bottle Baking pan or tray (to contain the mess) Food coloring (optional)
OMG 😲 😱 😲 😱
Hii
That was awesome!!!
Foam catches fire EEEeeek followed by giggles.
Mark you have proven there is still hope for mankind.
Youtuber Mark Rober is the largest waster and environment polluter by far, him and Mbeast.
Cool
13:02 i just wanna say that is the loudest drone ive ever heard
Can elephant toothpaste go to Mars
Normal person: *uses experiments to teach kids science* Mark: Welp, epic surprise party time.
Talk about over engineered
'foam daddy'
Bro how do they even clean that
make at home: A clean 16-oz plastic soda bottle. 1/2 cup 20-volume hydrogen peroxide liquid (20-volume is a 6% solution; you can get this from a beauty supply store or hair salon) 1 Tablespoon (one packet) of dry yeast. 3 Tablespoons of warm water. Liquid dishwashing soap. Food coloring.
From top to bottom, this entire production and presentation is everything I love about people!

The best part of this is video is Mr Beast at the end for the retention viewers
This is one of many reasons why dude has 21mil followers
0:13 so we not gonna talk about the kid in the back with his hand in his mouth?

Hmm so what That giant green tower was. I was wondering what that was
Amazing experiments
I subbed to mr beast
Almost 24 million views in 3.5 months, I sure hope Mark Rober and crew made up for the costs of this incredibly awesome project!
Imagine if you saw random elephant toothpaste in the middle of the air
*dont get in my way*
It must be so fun to be mark robers son
If youtube didn't exist, Mark would probably still be working at Nasa instead of making a big Elephant Toothpaste Volcano. So be grateful for youtube.
I love mr beast and mark rober
plus 1 uncle point              2s later AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
As a parent I was literally in tears a couple of times watching this. Great job.
Me after eat Taco Bell: 10:10
Love the work
like a volcanic eruption
little note, if you need to act as a doctor again, try a higher-pitched gentler voice. my doctor did that with me all the time when I was a kid lmao
That sound was like an elephant dying
11:41 all anime openings in a nutshell
Devils toothpaste probably has hydrogen peroxide but in a much higher concentration
How are you even doing all this in a couple days
mark, i need that devils toothpste recipe to make a shotgun shell that does obliternihhilationimation!
MY GRANDMA LIVES IN GRIDLEY
MrBeast

9:38 That one person who's inside the house: OH WHAT THE F-
You just in an airplane enjoying your view and what the f*** is that UFOs aliens foam equals Devil's toothpaste
Bill Nye may be an og but nothing beats mark rober
Bro everyone being there is like when you get all maxed out villagers in minecraft
All you have to do is increase your hydrogen peroxide percentage to above 30
12:53
When life gives you lemons you make lemonade
hiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11:53 Nice foot. 😂
ah its beautiful, i love your videos, i follow you for such a long time sometimes i wish i could do simular things or just be on those parites
Hi I love your vids

Well do
How did you do that I’m shocked 😳
Love it
Who was the benefactor???????
Wow
This is the most country barn raising  I have ever seen 😊
How amazing, you’re changing peoples world!
if u were my dad that would be awsome!!!!
I wish I could have you at least to see you on my b day
I NEED to know the building montage music also 13:47 us americans will use anything but the metric system
how much did this cost
Ok so i think im the only person afraid of orbies All because when i was six a for some reason ate one thinking it was flavored
its nearly 2022
This was released on my Birthday! Also a gift for me!
I stole his bike
That was cool
Your a great guy.
Mark is a child, and in that, I mean he has the most positive, creative, pure heart possible. He uses his genius to bring joy and education, and for that, he is the true GOAT. We need more people like him in this world.
That robber must feel really envious by now
даже лучше чем у мамикса
Hi
I have 1 question how do you clean after the experiment
Purple food coloring maker, FU WE MESS UP
That soooooo cool
why am i crying
Absolutely amazing vid love the generosity
Which book is this in ?
No one: Me after eating taco bell:
it also sounds like an elephant
Some was coming out the sides but you did it!
Say I am the world's suckyest acter I'm like true
Foam Daddy
He’s all I’m not gonna reveal devil toothpaste recipe then at 8:45 he reveals the recipe
Mark not realizing he gave the recipe to devils toothpaste be like
Idk what this catalyst he's using is but I bet this uses high test peroxide.
Bro This Town Builds Pools Like Its Nothing!
Devils toothpaste is just a higher concentration of hydrogen
What would happen if someone flew some drones through that stuff ? .     12:46
Jeff Bezos
Am I the only one who wants mark to surprise me with elephant toothpaste….
what if you filled the volcano with... Devil's toothpaste?
Can you release the devil's toothpaste formula for... Scientific purposes?
Hi
You help someone you help everyone-Aunt May
A
The things that they slide on for the slip and slide are known as air tracks in gymnastics
There are people who get lucky, people who get unlucky but at the end everyone gets what they deserve
12:52 you’re welcome
the secret ingredient is 50%+ concentrated hydrogen peroxide instead of the 3% that you get at the stores.
ohhh super, but why we doing this really.
I fail to see that how is (how high can elephant toothpaste be launched) is one of the most basic questions of life.
I love toothpaste 😋
As a retired middle school science teacher it is so incredibly satisfying to watch you spread your love of science in a manner that makes it understandable to anyone; you have a true gift and I’m SO glad that you make these videos and share/spread your enthusiasm and love of learning. Combining that with your altruistic attitude and love of doing for others makes you a top-notch human. I’d be proud to have had the chance to work with you. Keep up the great work!!!
Bruh, the night time shot of buildings the flask looked like starbase
I love watching mark rober
Congrats you used yt money to obliterate the last record. Jee if everyone had money like that we all would have destroyed that by now
😱😱
I wanna find the formula to devils toothpaste. Is that bad?
let’s go mark
i am speech less
LUCKY!?
the jet looks like a cessna citation ms or a citation CJ3+
"as you can see on the 13:19 mark we lost some elephants toothpaste.  So today we are going to make lonsdaleite coated structure and claim our throne for the tallest elephants toothpaste ever."
And I love your monologue
Love how that record came up immediately
Also that went SUPER HIGH
That farm could be big enough to fly my rc plane
It’s never for lack Effort
I just realized, mark rober build a devil toothpaste rocket (seal off the top and expeze the bottem
Can you do this for my birthday
2:46 those Orbeez going through that hose looks really weird and cool
Wow🤩
Looks like a volcano
You should definitely redo this but with devils toothpaste at the same scale.
Lol foam daddy
the drone images tho
Devils toothpaste in that massive flask when
I went in a limo before well actually 2 times
Dude ive always wished to do this types of stuff
manual do mundo breaked that record!  how ?
12:42 who heard the whisper?
BRODY im just commenting brody
he had to put his youtube logo on the toothpaste holder
Why is it called elephant paste ??
me when taco bell 13:19
Imagine being mark’s neighbour
Are we just going to ignore the fact that the soap cannon is called “foam daddy”!?
and i love is brother
I love that
does formula include 99-100% nitric acid?
How about a flask holding the same amount of devils toothpaste?
7:43 *foam daddy*
A
Hi
With all these building skills. Make me house
I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure that Mark isn’t allowed to claim a world Record for devils toothpaste unless he releases the formula
Mark don’t forget that me as a British person take the back hand peace as swearing…
Why is it called elephant toothpaste? Do they actually use it to clean elephants’ teeth??
As a mech e...I somehow feel like I'm doing something wrong lol.
there's such thing as devils toothpaste?
what's that song in the build montage?
Amazing job
When Mark said piston I thought “Is this Minecraft???”
When mark said piston I thought “Is this Minecraft?”
Mark Rober could be a Bond villain.
I can’t believe I first watched you at school xD
<3
I absolutely love the elephant toothpaste videos but I do have some burning questions.  Who has to clean up the mess afterwards? How do you even clean that up afterwards?
to make devils toothpaste you replace the hydrodyn poroxide 3-6% consentration with hydrdyn poroxide 90-96% consentration (high test poroxide)
wouldn't using something like potassium fluoride make the the reaction something so much more explosive and reactive
i am from VIET NAM
Oh my
foam DADDY?
Mark rober’s famous quote: “now all we need is a _ second build montage to get it all done.”
That is so scary
Dos  devils toothpaste Bourne skin?
U hates mr beast
would be interesting if you could do a hurricane version of the elephant toothepaste volcano, life if you spiraled the interior or something
It’s crazy how he does this
Hehe that one was funny mark
Ich will dir nicht zu nahe treten, aber wo bekommst du so viel Geld her? Das ist doch alles sehr teuer was du machst?!?
13:03 Me when you mom
The kid at 7:24 pulled the basket into the pool as you can see in the next shot
10:00 sounds were so satisfying
How do you afford it
The build montage tune is the "crazy rap song" chorus
it went all confetti we need a part 4
Such an inspiration video! Makes me wanna do something special for someone in need! Thank you
Now load the mega flask with devils toothpaste and..... RUN! Come on you know you want to :)
I have idea why don’t you make a flask of  elephant tooth past but replace it with devils tooth past
Cool
Still not bigger than nickado avacado
Well the boys slept worth a mile or two please please
Hii
"If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing." - this basically sums up this entire vodeo. And I love it.
Wow the build is so cool
999999999192819272182737881726/10
Where can I find the music used for the drone footage? Such beautiful sounds
coolwowxcool
You deserve 100000 uncle Points
Wow
watching your content both makes me forget, and reminds me how boring my life is
I’m big fan of MrBeast
One of the pinnacles of human existence.
To do all of that for a kid... Mark must be an angel :)
I thought lethamyr video start playing halfway through😭
It sounded like elephants lol
I wish I could do a feature with u mark im a big fan
I second mr beast’s coment
Now all you need is just make a room and roof and you got a bombproof shelter
me when I eat taco bell
hey
Jeff Jeffrey Bezos
MORE MORE MORE MORE jk
Imagine being a parent after your kid spends a day with Mark Roberg😂
Wow That's awesome spirit of experimentation It seems like you are really far away
Manual do submundo só não faz maior porque não ganha tudo que um americano ganha
I hope Brody is okay

The music for this video.. does  anyone know what it is or where I could find the tabs for ukulele?   LOL I hear Mark's Channel in our house with my teen and pre teen I'm conrol. I am super happy that this in in their roledex of YouTube channels. I think it would be cool if my preteen could play on his Ukulele..  I just linking up his interests!
That was so much fun to watch!
brody was like super calm in the tesla  but not woah so cool were going so fast wow
The elephant toothpaste looks like a rainbow scrambled eggs
Haha I recognize nitric acid when I see it that’s for sure lol
russian YouTube "It's Mamix" made elephant paste Much Bigger
Literally half a second later:THE NEW WORLD RECORD:1000 FEET (300 meters)
Fun fact: mark rober makes 12 videos a year

Whats the song at 11:53?
Must be nice, being wealthy enough, to not worry about creating pollution and chemical poisoning of the environment.
Fletcher said “limbo” not limo
i wish i had a uncle like that becouse my uncle is libing far away from me and i never saw him
What mark does for these kids are just incredible!
66666666666666666
Мамикс такой: вызов принят
i like that Fletcher has the same clothes as last year, its like supermans cape
I tear’d up watching this you are such a wonderful kind hearted human being Mark I’m so glad I discovered your channel.
This is so cool!
Imagine being named Mark Rober and having built a Mars Rover.
what goes around comes around 🙂
To easy
I hope someone reads this, but at 2:33 to 2:53 during the 20 second montage, what music did Mark used? Thanks if anyone can help.
Yo I live in gridley  and I’m surprised at how close it was to my house
how does one clean this
The pics from the drone were freakin awesome! Thanks Mark Rober
MR.BESAT!!!
Amazing
Best uncle ever
Mr. beast and mark rober make a great team
useless channel
Just curious how this affects the environment? I mean this was done on an orchard
Wait, this kid used his "make a wish"-wish to help out another kid? Can we just make him president?
You are the best elaphent toothpaiste person
POV: your the best uncle
Can’t believe that pool of orbees was a DISTRACTION
foam daddy?????
What have you done
I saw Tony Stark from Avengers
investment 100
ah yes but not the biggest
He’s so kind  you should 👍 this if you think the same
cameras were engorfed
Pullution's family...
Buddy that doctors office the first picture looks like the backrooms.
You are the most spectacular human I've ever witnessed this is amazing I'm at a lost for words
Wait but it went all comfelty
4:54 oooh elevators! I wonder what kind?
And then people be asking me why I want drones
Mark and Jimmy are the nicest people on earth
Why is there no place for resource conservation and environmental protection in the consciousness of some Americans?
Does that montage song 2:40 sound like a subtle Afroman: crazy rap remix? lmao
I wish I had freinds and family like that
did anyone else think that the red delves toothpaste looked like Hot Cheeto dust? at 10:12
kc Chef
Great drone shots
Gotta love Mark befriending people so he can make these videos lol
Feel sorry for his trucks . Rip
really drippy
30 second build montage to be cor
IM LITERALLY MAKING A SMALL VERSION OF THIS IN SCIENCE CLASS
😞
Hope Brody had a great day
Kid
Wow
Imagine using devil's toothpaste in combat
beautiful
I got here 3 months late.... why arnt my notifactions working?
4:29 just get higher % hudrogen peroxide. Say one of 50 or 60% instead of 20%
Mark, you are a damed inspiration. You make the world a better place with nearly everything you do.
nasıl temizleniyoki bu ?
He is so smart and is cool 😎
✌️✌️✌️✌️🤳
You guys are so nice
I like it
Those kids were totally interested in Fletchers sister

I love your videos it is so cool👌🏼
YOU BUILT A WHOLE DANG VOLCANO MY DUDE
I hope maybe just maybe you can make this record better
When someone in jojo dies 10:21
Awesome
the sister kinda fine tho
Awesome vid. It reminds me of something that happened a while back. I'm really into music and i wanted to play the banjo. I went into the music store here in my town and we were going to put the banjo on layaway. The guy at the counter asked when we could pay it off. I wasn't sure so i tried to call my mom (i was 16 at the time) and this other person there asked if i knew how to play. I said no but i was going to learn. We go back to doing our own thing and the guy goes up to the counter and says he wanted to buy the banjo. I was devastated because I thought he was just trying to be a jerk. I soon found out he bought it for me, and i was shocked. NOTHING had ever happened to me like that. it warms my heart that a complete stranger who was only in his 20s in fact, would spend almost 200$ on a stranger. We surely need more people like this in the world.
9:36 Deidara - ART IS AN EXPLOTION!
they driving in a limo while for my 16th birthday im here getting 25$ and thats it..
Gridley seems like an awesome place to live. Everybody there seems like a real homie.
Love your videos Mark, but there's a stunning lack of color in all of them
Ayo how are those manicins
13:02 after NNN
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀❤️❤️❤️
What’s the music called
Omygod
Mr best you famous
Sorry for being a downer, but what was the environmental cost of all these games? Millions of orbies, chemicals from the toothpaste and everything else.
Stop making me cry.
Yo, Ebpic
That kid is so selfless!
Did I ask?
Mark rober videos are awesome give me something to think about
13:03 even sounds like an elephant.
Can we extend the neck of the flask to focus the beam of foam better?
WOW! I didn’t even know this was possible
@mark rober is elephant toothpaste harms our environment?
13:01  Me after a bit too much Taco Bell

While people r doing this people r dying from hunger lol
MR BEASTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Love how he says private jet like its a normal thing
That looks remarkably like an over-sized Project Gemini spacecraft
My science teacher made our class watch this video
12:45 begin
What Mr beast said
Fungus fungus among Us
I did this in my school science lab and go 1 inch
Now try the same record but with devils toothpaste
Cool 😎
😂The hand sign Mark makes for photos is the same as pulling the middle finger in the UK.
Did someone just tickle my eyeballs... Thank you Mark for being a real life super hero in times that never could be harder for some!
What you see : science  What i see : spore spice  👌👌👌
You guys are amazing  i love what you do
Mark you are the best bro . I hope you win the influencer games. None of those other guys come even close to your awesomeness
Batman was to late
11:20 yo am i watching a lethamyr video

That is so insane 9:30
That is so insane 9:30
i don't know the 50x power when i kick a fully inflated football...  that's why i like the metric system an the SI Units...  how much is that in newton or psi?
wooow
cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
that was a huge blast
13:45 me when i see your mom
You mean you nearly took out your Armada pilot ;)
As they do to empty a bottle faster : What if they spin the containers a bit ? Maybe the pressure on the container would be reduced and volcano higher ? Amasing work as always and it reminds me all the colors in the movie Hook :)
your FPV pilot needs a raise
so beautiful nice that you made him smile
cool
у мамикса пизже
It must be fun to be his neighbour

Так вот откуда Мамикс крадёт свои видео
Can still go higher by stopping the leaks
Mamix made more
yo thats the same song as leth’s intro
All I want to do is feel it, is that too much to *ask* for?:(
HELMETS PLEASE!!! That was kinda disappointing, but EVERYTHING else was spectacular!!!
did anyone else realise someone saying enchante?
That dude is the most luckiest kid ever.
Same i love his vids to
mark made spacex v2
ecological disaster!!
Such a weird place to build and set this off
He used Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4) as a catalyst 😉
Your best yet.
and how do you clear this mess up after ?
Did he just said he talked with the worlds richest youtuber MRBEAST!?!?!
Cool
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh Mr beast was there?!
Above all else, Mark, I love how you make kids so happy!!!
Lol
respect.... amazing
"a football" is now a u it of measurment for force.....   "This was 50 footballs of force"...lol
world record coolest uncle
How did you clean this?
Awesome video! you're so nice!
whatis the purpose of all these illogical things?
Fffjaaa
Thx
Hi

Wait, who is Dale?
That one colony of Ants when they get hit by tons of exothermic heat: 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️

You are great human, Mark. 🤘💯🤘
I love. All that stuff sorry brady
what a great guy
+1 uncle points
Hi YouTube pls let me stream on YouTube via ps4 again
WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND.
This was so cool, i still enjoy watching it!😄
How exactly does one clean up 25,000,000 orbeez??
And we finish off the video with a nice shot of the kid riding around his 4-wheeler without a helmet...
Not as big as pointcrow's, but it is taller.
Brody is the best
Love the vid
Nice
The people who make the mess, are they forced to clean it up also? I sure hope so. BullyBilly.
What a legend
13:31 reminds me of Peter north
13:43 pressure in psi?
Dope life amazing family 💯
The phantom camera is such a massive upgrade to the channel
more than engineering .. it is the kindness that many people show .. makes this place liveable :)
Haha honestly I thought this video was a separate video re-upload of the devil's toothpaste experiment with only  the clips of the eruption😆😆. I clicked this video because I just could. Glad I was wrong that this was a re-upload.
3:42 - did you get the debunking master captain disillusion once again?
13:31
This video amazing 😍👍🏻👍🏻
Now this is what I call.. content-quality
THATS HUGE!
Wow!
Omg it’s mr beast and mark rober my favourite YouTubers
That was amazing! love this video!!!🇺🇸
I freaking love you Mark. You are what i want to be when i grow up... Im grown but still
well done
i have a whole playlist with just the best videos of youtube... but i think i found the best channel of youtube
Having 20 plus million subscribers must pay pretty well
I love you Mark
Can we plz have devils toothpaste
This has mostly restored my faith in humanity
am i the only one who thinks that he should make a devils/elephants  toothpaste rocket?
No onll that,s amazingm
Even I do it better you can see me come from 10 miles
This world does not deserve mark rober
10:13 Looks like hot cheeto dust
10:02 Looks like cheese
AMAZING VIDEO I FREAKEN LOVE YOU
第一
Iberê: finalmente um oponente digno
incredible
Can I Buy This Stuff Off You!?
Pov: you’re mark robers son
4:16 QUEEN moment
Whoo Snowbird
umm, mark, the environment definitely took a toll here considering the amount of co2 you released by making this video. not! cool!
I absolutely adore your channel. I have teared up at quite a few videos, thank you for the constant reassurance in humanity.
visibly not real
And how do you make devil's toothpaste?
Mark robber is like mikel jackson, having fun partys at his range with some kids.
The music he uses is hilarious and iyk..yk
Mark is one of the most wholesome and cool youtubers out there
This is an awesome video and it looks so fun!
Awesomeness!!!
Great accomplishments and obviously great engineering, mechanical as well as social...and much fun! But how about the other 99%? The math/science is top notch, inspirational. But how about WHO you inspire and WHERE? I know your heart is to teach great-cool stuff, and I did too for many years . I'm white, 49, from Texas...and I want to see more diversity.
who is that girl with the other guys?
What if you did this but upside down and make an elephant toothpaste rocket
im just impressed by the limbo
Cool
And whats the point of this may i ask ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So i told MrBeast about this philantropy project... Thats all we needed to know
Thats wild that some still slightly leaked out of the bottom.
mr  bes
that's me on December 1st
Song at 2:42?
That's crazy!
Amazing!
NURKFPV?!??!?!
Mark should put a link in the description with the title “devils toothpaste recipe” and the link is a Rick roll
I'm just jealous about those kids. What an rng to be born like that.
THE ELIFANT TOOT PAST THE RED AND ORANGE
How do you get rid of all those orbeez?
wait did this happen in gridley? i live really close there
If i had money i will do the same 🥲
You made Brody's day, no doubt!
big boi
You are so creative
If you hear closely, you can hear the trumpeting Noises  of elephants. This thing really put the elephant in elephant toothpaste
wish i would've known about this lol, nothing ever goes on in my town(Gridley) xDD
This was very cool. 👍🏻
The kid's sister is a baddie
Njjjn uuuu what jks
16:39 you a saints fan? I am
Nobody Mark Rober: aww yes the floor is made out of elephant toothpaste
Just Mark being his kind selfless self. We all love what you do for these kids bro.
Mark, you have to figure out a way to incorporate the elephant toothpaste with the glitter bait packages.  As you try to clean up the "craft herpes" aka glitter, all you do is smear the glitter out further and further making it harder to clean.
What my parents expected from the paper volcano I made in 4 grade
I wish every Child had an Uncle like Mark.  :-)
Genuinely curious. How does one clean up Elephant toothpaste?
I love your videos because of all the engineering.  It's always so interesting and entertaining.  However, when you do things like this that uplift someone so young dealing with something they should never have to deal with.  Just wow!   Keep up the great work, sir!
Ждём от мамикса ещё масштабнее
Nice
That so crazy when all that foam went fly up into the sky🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😳👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Shed a tear
12:52 Me when your mom and I..
Is no one gonna talk abt the ppl that got covered in elephant toothpaste?!
"I want to answer a life question. How high can a elephant toothpaste volcano go?"  Yeah, cause everyone goes around thinking about that.
and CO2 emission ?
Mark could build a whole planet
Mark is mr beast but does experiments every time he does a video
1:22 NANI
Crazy to think that while I'm just living other people are doing this
Waww😵😵😵
This is happiness.
“Ah mr. Epstein, lucky seeing you here on this private jet!”
The editors need a raise!
Fiiiiiisssshhhhhh
That was soooooooœ coolll
Yea
This doesn't look environment-friendly
he should be able to design a water park i swear
This made me cry, what a sweetheart. Please tell me Brady is ok now???
E very norwegian watching when they showed the tesla: Oh? First time?
Toothpaste
I mean sure all this stuff was impressive, but still pales in comparison to what that kid did by giving away his wish. He's on another level.
Dad: your uncle isn't that cool... Your uncle:
By helping others we help ourselves.
Ooooooooomagod
He does it again
I think your work is amazing and y think you are the best, people like you make the Earth a better place to live
Him I will not give you the formula also him after we fill it up with h2o soap and food coloring
No one going to mention mark sticking 2 fingers up
Sup
3:02 Logo of the Communist Party of the USA
Keep inspiring and being inspired @Mark Roper.  Love ya!
You are an amazing guy!
what a nice guy
12:40 Here's what you came for.
Vulnerable people in fortnite are
Honestly nothing to regret living on this lifetimes....and also mark just give best party at the town
Your friends with mrbeast!?
The Joker sure has alot of comically large flasks worth 7 months of Joker "manjuice"
I like the Video😉👍
make a rocket one
I wonder what if at the end it wasn`t confetti...
amazing
love this!!
i hope this makes it on to outrageous acts of science that would be cool you are awesome love your content and your contribution to M. S. L curiosity
Too much money and too little brains :-(
Is this a non-polutant?
So sweet❤❤❤💙💙💙
Isn't it a federal crime to impersonate a doctor?
7:20 editor deserves an oscar
Bro Mark rober is props kinda smart
Ibere...
я когда с армии пришол . так кончал
The editing on this video. Just a chefs kiss
nice
Awesome :D ya know scripts mark robber so idk it :((
u make my day!!!!!!!!!!
Aw I absolutely love your reaction to it Finally working🥰❤❤❤❤❤
Mini nuke
Simple chemical reaction ❌  Elephant 🐘 toothpaste ✅
I like this
Ye cannot get ye flask.
Yt wouldn’t let me comment on the comment
I will take your advice. Let me go do that real quick
Well imagen making mrbeast look cheap 🤣
You said the pressure on the walls was fifty times that of a football. That is not an iso standard unit of measurement. Do you have a conversion factor for those of us not familiar with football inflation standards. Also is that an American football or a ball known the rest of the world over as a football (soccer ball)
I think that your record was tKen by mamix
not the kid almost losing his toe to a drone 💀
Has any one seen the point crow video of the largest elephant exsparement
I would LOVE to have mark as my uncle
What’s that song in the background at 3:00
hello and welcome to the death rai- *PASTE*
It would be legendary to be one of those kids
That was osume
4k when c'mon
why u bully mehhhh
I love mister beast to watch it because he have 26 million dollars
You like irl how adam sandler looks in his movies lol
Ok I clicked the video leave me alone now
imagine turning it off when your heads completely under
how to cleaning it ?
no, it doesn't :(
Imaging sitting on the top of the flask with a parachute and some sort of shield underneath you
Voce apareceu no videl do mrbeast
Can't believe that vid was a year ago thought it was just like a month or two ago
Sounds like an elephant
Imagine doing this whole time just to realize you weren’t recording
Hjhk
Let's gooooooooooooooooooooo
How long have you been doing Science
13:48, we talking regular footballs or tom brady footballs?
У мамикса пижже
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS GUY EXISTED BEFORE TODAY?!
btw your record got beat by pointcrow
Hey uh one of the elephant toothpaste u did has just been beat by pointcrow
Hahahaha
that girl cute
i am a big fan
I watched your video with Mr. beast and I just got to say I really felt like he didn’t shout you out enough! You’re very intelligent and very creative I don’t think he would’ve been able to do it without you! Keep up the great work
You could make this much higher ;)
Formula is concatred catalyst
My life most basic question is ÷                                                                                                     What is life?
I wish I knew what my chemist father would have said about this.
THE REAL MRBEAST :OOOOO AAAAA🥔🥔🥔
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA🥔
OMG MRBEAST
Amazing.
1:26
11:27
doesn't feel very environment friendly :/
12:47
ingrediants hydrogen peroxide  soap food coloring ????? possibly an organic peroxide?
That caught me off guard when Mark said “child labour”
Those high-film-speed drone shots of the toothpaste basically frozen in place were nothing sort of Majestic. I'm so glad you included them in this already-really-fun video of yours. :)
Can’t wait till he beats the world record again if it is possible.
Next time, cap it and unbolt it from the base, see how high that flask can fly!
superou o manual do mundo?
Wow
So amazing!!!! :-) ) . But who do you clean this mess up? Does it dissolve with water?
Your 100000 count is great
Mr beast I am your and mark rober subscriber
13:40 americans really will use any units except ones that make sense
This made my day, Thank you for that!
plz reinforce the flask and do this same thing but w/ devil's toothpaste
Billionaires who claim to be philanthropists when they are really just "Philanthro-Capitalists" (weasel Bill Gates term) can learn a lesson from this video.
I wisch i was that kid
Mark Rober I dare you to challenge how ridiculous to a batting challenge I want you to make a robot that can hit baseballs farther than how ridiculous can
i love this mark u are amazing! this truly melts my heart
Worlds best party
Hand: *gets burned* Hand again: this is fine...
Hear me out bro. Fletchers sister tho😳
a tridition for the next years
Did no one actually see that bird fly into that thing.
Omg mrbeast

Huuugyy wuugy🫂
Why not just tell us the pressure? lmao
I wish something interesting happened in my life
he is so luckey
awsome
What kind of measurement is that? How many psi/kpa was on the flask?
You don’t know when, but it always comes back :)
So I was having your average Monday and we are learning about chemical reactions in class and my science teacher put the video on and tbh best Monday in the school year so far
Rip all the legendary Orbees that sacrificed to this pool
Mission Passed: Respect  Seriously though, what a chemically and engineering feat. Love your videos!
Wow. That was really tall
WHOS DALE!!!
You and mrbeast are changing life’s forever .. know we’ll remember you guys as legends
Whoaaaaa your friend is mrbeastttttttttttt
Amazing 🤩
Epic!
Love youre videos
I love your videos
at 9:54 when it went off it kinda looked like lava
you are wrong about the whole it always comes back... only those special few whom got noticed have it come back. 99 percent of the rest of us do not have the same interaction you do. Even if you involve yourself you are still only helping those whom you think are worthy enough. so drop the high act.
Wait is a new record for highest jump made by a 1 ton flask?? 😆 lol
This seems so long ago how was it only 2 months!!
*12:53** after the NNN*
So 650 psi?
Wewewewewewewweeeweewewewewew we we weweweweweweweweweweweweewewewe weweweweweweeeewewewewewe weweweweweweweweweweeeeweweweetwtwetwewewewewewewwewewe weweweweweweewewwwewewewewweweweweweweeweweewewweeeewweweweweeweweweewewewewewweweweweweweweweweweweweeweweeeeweweweweweweweeeweeweweeeweweweeweeewweewewweeeeweeeweweeweweweewwewwewweeweweewwewewewewewe

Who I better mr  beast or Mark rober     I think mr beast because  Mark is a rober
When mark was thinking about the elephant toothpaste and thing of doing it again I suspect that he is gonna do it again but with devil’s toothpaste since the 2 colours didn’t work.
The volcano looks more like the Gemini 8 or mercury
This was really awesome

Mark Rober, THE BEST UNCLE in the entire WORLD!
Wowowowowowowowow

This has loads of green screen potential
Putting mercury and aluminium together will creat a chemical reaction similar to this
Let’s go team sees
This is the coolest thing EVER
Imagine mark robber did this on mars
The animation is great
YaY
that one kid in the class that went too overboard with the volcano  project
0:21 Did u see his car got submerged in elephant toothpaste?
YESSSSS! you finally made it!
12:50
Im smiling the whole vid :)
Way to stuff the environment for some YouTube views Mark.
So cool
i'm glad that now, instead of asking captain dissillusion about a very obvious edit, now you just figured out the incredibly obvious edit yourself (i'm referring to the phone with propellers on it)
Thank you mark rober! My school showed us your channel and let us make elephant toothpaste today and soon the teacher is gonna show us devils toothpaste
Did that foam cannon say foam daddy 😑👀😩

Amazing
Gj

Pilot: Yo, what’s that green thing in the sky?  Co-Pilot: Oh it’s just Mark Rober
Invest in RAN on the ASX. The next Bitcoin?
Okay, the cynic in me could smell the new 4 wheeler when you said he gave his away.  Not suprised, but still smiled for it. Anyone has the opportunity to get it world record if they apply themselves.Mard did it in such a manner that was special and perfect. Way to go Mark, Way to go!
kids: MINECRAFT LAVA!!!!!!!!!
We can watch your videos during study hall because they are educational. Love your videos!
Here’s to hoping Brody gets better.
You literally told us the ingredients for devils toothpaste
its all white people
Great video, but I do take issue with this one line: "It turns out the pressure inside the flask was 50 times what you feel when pushing against a football" Oh... Okay? I mean PSI or KPA or Newtons would have... meant something, but sure.
Can e
9:35
You copied this from crazy xyz
"I followed you when I was slike SIX"  funny
i wish i was at the pool party 😅
Mark's videos always proof that humanity still exists...🥲
Legends are here after mr.beast video
if the flask was closed it could´ve gone wrong in a lot of ways
Pay those workers!
Mad respect for you and everyone involved in the video
What can I say….other than 🙏🏼😊👍🏻 ✌🏻
8:39 didn’t you just reveal the mixture?
Answering one of life most “basic”questions. “How high can you launch elephant toothpaste into space,”said Mark Rober.and thats one of life’s most basic questions
At the end mark looks like a lifeguard lol
YOU RocK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! rober I MENT mARK ROBER
Oooh I THOUGHT I WATCHED this before!!! But it’s a different video!! Oooo LETS GOOOO
Imagine having a human in there..
That foam thingy said foam daddy
what a team of legends
If i was one of those kids that would be the best day ever
Perhaps the mayor showed up to ask if they could use the "volcano" as a city event in the future XD
Now that you have an elephant toothpaste valcano, maybe you want to get another robot off your hands! I am doing an experiment on rock skipping for my IB physics class. Can I please have Skippa? I dont know what else to do. I am out of options, Mark! If you have other ideas for physics IAs as an alternative, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! Please send any help!
Imagine powering a rocket with that
We love you mark
This is what happens when your father is a friend of a famous youtuber

He said he won’t tell us the things we need for devils toothpaste but still shown us it
i love your videos they made my day i mite not be there boy i could not stop smiling
You are a legend!!!!
It’s so wonderful to find a guy like Mark on the internet. Rather than take the world records for himself he gives them to others. He searches for people who have given selflessly and rewards them by giving selflessly himself. He uses his intelligence to make the world a better place. Thank you for being part of our lives Mark! It’s awesome to watch your YouTube videos and it makes my day brighter ^_^
10:18 who else though about cleaning it up?
If you have Engineering skills and have millions of dollars from your friend, why not?
GOIN UP
WHINDRESSNNUNES INTERESSADO

i am so shocked i  have the same birthday as mark rober
Mark rober videos actually make my day just better thank you bro
I love the firetruck, which is waitin
Fletchers sister tho 🤤
That was actually sound like elephant
How are you supposed to clean it?
This, but instead of Hydrogen Peroxide and Potassium Iodide, you use water and sodium metal
I really wanted to know how they clean the pollution from the environment afterwards.... I mean leaf blower, sure, but then what?
I really hope we get to work together in the future! i support you and mrbeast’s grinding so much and i dream to be up there one day
3:37 At first, I thought that was Gordon Ramsey
I watched this in school

Fun fact: life did not give us lemons because humans literally breeded trees until they got lemons.
extrovert paradise lol
what about fletchers world record it was broken#
I really enjoyed that he used local people from his community to help build. Adding more to his community than any dollar amount could
Does it matter what you tell your brain

child labour is based
Can I get a recipe of how to make a safe version of elephant toothpaste? Thanks to anyone that can tell me
i think devels toothpaste is gonna get weaponised
DANG this is amazing!
How did you get the flying slowmo shots
The foam cannon was named: foam daddy😳
How warm is the reaction and does it degrade on its own over time?
i freaking love this youtube channel bro
I used to like you but now...... I totally love you since you are pulling for my boy Kamara.
Mark Rober you are amazing 😎😎
Private Jet to cut one hour? Srsly?

Why wouldn’t I be subbed

Rober is so cool, he makes science fun, way more than Bill Nye the Science Guy, although he was cool back in the day!! Lol...I find myself w a goofy smile while watching all of your crazy stunts...thank you!!
Dis is 1 month ago bruh I thought dis was 9 month ago
I really wanna see the Devil's Toothpaste explode inside a junk car or some other large container. That would be interesting.
I live in Gridley so this is so cool!!
That melon was no longer a water melon it was an air melon
Ghtygv
Respect to the cameraman and editor for the epic video
That was the best elephant toothpaste video ever because the video elephant toothpaste video you did was awful it didn't go that high
mark rober is the best
What if this was how Chernobyl exploded
Pie
Imagine all the time, money and effort going in to this and then uploading it in 1080p... 😆
the recipe to devils toothpaste is 5 L of 50 % Hydrogen Peroxide 350 mL of Dish Soap 2 g of blue Food Coloring and to activate it 600 g of 50 % Potassium
So Mark Rober is actually the kid that turned Dr. Doofenshmirtz bad with his toothpaste volcanoes.
this is certainly the highest, but it is not the highest in volume, the highest in volume was made by the "manual do mundo" in Brazil
It's over batman i already filled this comically large flask.....
If you dont think vegans are the superheros of our era you clearly haven’t watched the video: veganism could save the planet here’s why, on YouTube!

What about making a rocket nozzle to be able to reach a higher height with the same amount of chemicals.
What would happen if the top of the toothpaste thing would be way smaller like 10 inches or even less
The orbeez pool edits were clean
Is it just me or does that toothpaste launch remind you of a nuclear launch sequence?
That kid wasn’t even happy
12:44 your welcome

Psst… yea you…mhm the one reading this comment…you are a beautiful human being…and you always will be…bye have a great life 💪🏼❤️😊💕
Awesome video but telsa's are still over rated
Hi
[Part of the way through] OK, first I get mark rober doing a captain disillusion impersonation, then I get some thing that looks like a dark island out of Disney Narnia three…! This is officially defined as an awesome video…. So far 🕶
Excuse me what was that brah like bruh who names the things “Foam Daddy” SUS
Risk it for the brisket
Do you think you could get a higher launch if you put something that holds back the pressure temporarily and lets it build up? Obviously you would have to worry about the sides blowing out, but perhaps even a light plastic film on top would make it go higher?
When.
I love it
I think you should try that with water pressure. I mean in place of water you should use elephant toothpaste It could have gone much much higher
Cute
This entire video in simply, absolutely, only 1 word: Amazing, stellar, unbelievable, life-changing.
He must have passed science class but I have had to repeat 9th grade 1mil times
Cool
did anyone else notice that as the video went on more and more kids appeared
I'm your biggest fan
Looks nice to have 💰
this is more fun than mr.beast vids by far
Dat Tesla be going 5kph
Mr.Beast
After watching all of your videos I wonder how you would do on the show BattleBots. Would you use a grapple bot, flipper, wedge, horizontial spinner, vertical spinner, drumb spinner, or a pierceing bot?
Sometimes you just gotta love humanity
Amazing !
I’m not crying you are
Did he just tell us the recipe for devil’s toothpaste
Cool
I always love the ways mark rober’s videos are filmed they are so unique and cool
My class watches you

14:29 this masterpiece should be a land mark
How fun!    I lived in Gridley for ten years.   I knew nearly everyone in the video... and had no idea that they had pulled this off.      HOW FUN!!
Quality over quantity. That's why I like this guy.

Hey love the video and everything with make-a-wish and stuff, but I really have issues with portraying flying with a private jet like it‘s amazing and something for a bucket list or something. Idk driving for 1,5h isn’t that bad compared to 20 minutes of private jet which is pretty much just launching and landing
Can you brush your teeth with elephant toothpaste
I can't resist a laugh at 4:18

When life gives you lemons use them as a racecar battery
You should make a Halloween animatronic
I swear, Mark would build a space station with toothpicks and 2x4s and launch it into actual space in order to become the best Uncle on earth.
¿oye mark que cuando van a hacer un volcan de salsa picicante?
Plant 20 million trees When you hit 20 mil

Joker be like
Is there a Tech that stops an astreoid?
Mr beast😀😀😀
It sounds like an elephant
Hey Mark, Could you please design a solar-powered  atmospheric water generator? I know we can achieve this by cooling down air. I would love to see how you investigate different ways of doing so, testing it, and finding the most efficient prototype that we normal mortals could build ourselves.
Mark rober is singlehandedly responsible for more than a fair few core memories in these kids
어머나! I finally saw it! ^ ^
Congrats Mark almost 20M and im waiting celebrating 🥳
That elephant toothpaste is so high, that it dorvce everything around it in every dymention
You are such an amazing human. I aspire to be anywhere even close to the person you are. ❤️❤️❤️
Kool
That would be the best birthday ever
What advise would you give to someone thinking of starting YouTube.
Me seeing at the bottom of the screen saying 1+ uncle point
The onerous methane accordantly ignore because sea disconcertingly hate amidst a permissible wound. reflective, private sister
Gridley Military:WE HAVE NUKES IN BOUND!!!
Super white party.
Make a TALLER one! (Elephants toothpaste)  Try to make a controlled jet of Devils Tootpaste, with a nozel and a stronger flask (Probally partly buried), you could do it! Think of how tall it could go! Sorry ISS, didin’t mean to cover your solar pannel, hope it wasn’t still reacting! Or a gun version   Try odd-shapped nozels (Stars?) With computers, make pulses and shapes, forming balloons out of elephants toothpaste.  Have an Elaphants-Tootpaste watergun, and use it in a fight (It is more like a nerf-gun. Small cartriges that, when you pull the trigger, are mixed to form the toothpaste. So, I guess more like a real gun? But, you know, toothpastie-er.  More ideas coming!  Also, Why not make the flask partly in the ground? Just use pulleys to get the reactants in, and use a ladder (Or channel your inner steryotipical explorer and use the pulleys as well), and put it in. So it looks the same size (Or smaller) than the last one, but is really much bigger. I highly doubt it can break through 30+ feet of earth, and if you are worrided, dig it extra wide, and make steel support struts that go into the earth…
this is a party the kid will never forget
When life gives you lemons… *hope mark Robert doesnt get his hands on em*

Mark, a quick message from one of your millions of fans: I freaking love your videos. I'm getting married in January, so I am looking forward to having kids and teaching them to love learning. I want you to know that your channel is going to be part of their schooling, not just because you share so much about science, but because your purpose is to inspire people to love knowledge! After every video of yours that I watch, I am so motivated to be better, be more optimistic, and be more excited about learning, and I want my kids to feel that same drive. With love from my future children!
50000+ socal credit

Rip to: flies in the air Death: September 4 2021 They will be missed.
so cool
I noticed that during the Devil’s Toothpaste troughs bit that the orange seemed dominant over every colour (except blue and purple, which weren’t there-) and I also noticed in the last Devil’s Toothpaste World Record video, the orange was dominant over the yellow and red, but blue and purple were the most dominant colour. Is orange the most dominant due to the chemicals in the dye or is it just because red and yellow are mixing and making the orange seem more dominant than it really is? I don’t understand chemicals enough to know myself- so if someone could explain, I would really appreciate it :) If not, that’s okay too, me and my mom plan on testing my theory of orange having a stronger reaction than other colours soon anyways :D
YOU’RE TOO LATE BATMAN…
I like how you use some guy illness to manipulate, nice touch, works every time.
We are trying to get you to come to Rootstech!

This is just mind blowing. I feel like crying.💯💯💜💜
you ever just wanna be in mark rober's science experiments?
This is what I like
Hola Mark Rober te mando saludos desde México
That was all awesome!
mr beast answer : yup money
You should make a take 1 candy thing then when they take 2 that they git scared or the candy's taken a way.

Im so glad to be alive in the same lifetime with this legend
Mark you are so kind
1:55 we love breaking laws
your so close to 20 mil
Next vid idea put devil’s toothpaste in the giant flask
Bring back your science classes!!!! They were so cool!
le’ epic
Albert Einstein has been real quiet since this YouTube channel was created.
Devil's toothpaste formula: Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide which is illegal without a permit in quite a few countries.
wowowowowow
You're the smartest person I know
I got the same atv as him😂
Hiiiiiiii
mesmerizing transitions
I wish i could meet mark He is so cool These kids are luckier than the word lucky
People should make an elephant toothpaste gun
You are a very great person in making kinds happy always a fan of you
This is awesome because my grandpa was from Gridley
Who else realized that he play Lethamyr’s intro song at 11:17
Mark is the type of guy who would spend any amount of money to have fun
A lot of respect for DraftKings sponsoring this video!
Must be lucky
Hey my brother loves your Vids
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaark roder when your you are going to be the hot sause morende  from the world mark roder  when please if you know what                                                                  it s cribi well xd

12:47  Thank me later.
mark rober, 2032: while we were breaking the elephant toothpaste record AGAIN we found this thing that i am calling satans toothpaste. military: we will be dropping the satans toothpaste catalist into the lakes, after secretly pumping in the correct ingrediants.
close t0 20m!!!
ALMOST AT 20 MIL!
Oye Vania dice que para cuando vas a aasee el volcán de salsa picante más enorme del planeta
I think the formula for d paste is very concentrated h202 and some catalyst
mrbeast be like: *time to spend 20M dollars*
This is a different level edit. Enjoyed every second of it. Thank you for this!
whos house did u set the elepant toothpaste at?
13:24 laser of foam
1:30
I love Mark Rober and his videos just because he's smart and a scientist/engineer
This whole video is so precious
I am 100% sure that a few drones got swallowed by the Devil's toothpaste.
5:29 too bad you didn't act for long
MR BEAST????!!!!
9:22 power wash simulator
Honestly I love draftkings but are they really the best sponsor for a kids video?
Your parents are proud of you Markrober:)
Mark we need another video
I totally wanna save up money to be able to do a small version of this for my brother birthday/adoption
Please make me a birth day party this is awesome
Who remembers the studio c sketch with mark rober called stranded on an island with mark rober
Mark in 20 years: World’s Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano (IT WENT TO THE MOON!!!)
why do i feel like i want to start eating that foam
hey mark, says luan palomera that stops when the hot sauce volcano.
How do you make elefant tooth paste mark?
"The Force that ejected the elephant toothpaste out the top was 50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully infalted football....." WHAT THE F*CK KINDA UNIT IS THAT? Just say a gooddamn pressure like psi or bar or whatever but what was that supposed to mean? What does pushing gainst a football even mean?
apparently that flask is going nowhere. it'll be just like the pyramids for the future civilizations.
I want to have enough money to where I can just help people
Yea guys save the earth... but also... private jet... Apart from that, great video as always
13:02 wow that was a wierd noise the flask made
Mark is going to hit 20 million
Love it Mark. Especially the comments at the end. This world just needs nicer people. You inspire many. Keep rocking 👏👏👏
Hi I’m Ryleigh and I love your videos
Almost 20 mil! Need to plant another 20 million trees?
congrats
How do you clean all that up and what will that do to the environment? This is the second time you’ve produced this literal huge mess for a couple of seconds of a video. I get it looks cool but what are you doing to the earth? How does this amuse the masses of the future who are gunna live in crap if this is poisoning the ground they live on, the water they drink, and the air they breath?
Almost to 20mil you almost beating LazarBeam
Viewers : Mark Rober is obsessed with   elephant toothpaste
how many world records do these guys hold? lol
Let's get mark to 20 Mill
Love
Mark starting to turn into Mr Beast Spending ALOT OF MONEY for other people
That kid deserved that party
9:37  Why he is not reacting Oh
Are these experiments eco-friendly?
Make a 1B orbeez pool plz
Hey can you please  build  a flipi  iPhone Please
Hey  is the  class  for engineers
But like This felt so rewarding just to watch I am so glad that Brody got his surprise wth
Mark here’s a suggestion for a collab video you could do a collab with integza
Congrats on 20 m subscribers.
best video EVER!
Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ
I would love to be marks friend
Gotta respect the astros cap
LET'S GO too the 20millons
Almost 20m! :D
Aren’t the chemicals involved in large quantity in this experiment hazardous to the environment?
youre one of the best youtubers i have ever watched keep up the work my guy
9:43 I wanna eat it
fletcherrs's sister doe ..
“The best view is after the hardest climb.” -unknown

Best video EVER! I love your channel you are amazing!!!
haha nice joke🤗😺
exuse me but what month is your engineering class in
7:30 when you drop in the water it looks like you are flipping the bird XD
mark rober just know that you will go to super heaven and everyone will call you Mr.kind
YEpic
Almost 20 milion
there goes all of marks bank savings XD

Be careful, not to push the Earth out of trajectory.
Here before 20 million
16:08 best qoute
Never ended toothpaste
Amazing tesla tho
Hey Mark the 2021 mars rover passed Marse's moon on my bday
I wish I could be in a pool of orbiez
Imagine if mark chose an volcano and make an copy of it then exploded it with elephant toothpaste
MR BEAST?!!?
Mark I love your videos I want to meet you
Little do we know, next year he will do another one of these  vids.
Thats bigger than a lot of geysers
You are an amazing kind-hearted person mark, giving very strong heroic kids world records.

dude imagine being marks kid cause the parties he would throw
*Flex*
Karma is real. Change my mind.
Loose
Hi
AYYYYYYYY MR. BEAST!!!!
Lets get Mark to 20 mil!!!
Why the heck do his videos always manage to make me cry!
i got a question if you had a drone hovering in a car and made the car go would the drone move with the car
Mark roder when are you coming out with another monthly class
is it normal to be happy for them yet jelous
Almost 20mil lets go for it
SERIOUSLY YOU MADE ME CRY! I envy youR educational purposes but more so growing up in group homes and boot camps what you did for these kids was absolutely moving. This was so awesome. You moved me. I am appreciative for people with hearts and intentions like yours. Thank you!
imagine being a bird and getting hit by a 1000000000 degree green sniper lol
🤩 wow 🤩
Do u guys think that mark rober is the modern day spencer from icarly
i think that wraps it up no need to keep on wasting 1 out 12 videos ........But it was awesome to be fair
you remember some time ago mark made devils toothpaste well its higher concentration hydrogen peroxide, mark was most likely using 70% or higher but he most likely didn't say because if it hits anything organic it... self combusts
Hey mark can you make a video about how cycle pumps work i really wanna know 🤔🤔🤔.
Make an elephant toothpaste gun
They were more excited about the Tesla than anything
Houston, we achieved lift off...
Ladies and gentleman, we achieved lift off...
He should make a tv that constantly looks at him when he is in the same room with the tv
20 Mil Incoming
12:38
Sussy jid
I took the class the second time it came out, and I can confirm, it was one of the most fun months I've *ever* had
Found out the secret to devils toothpaste, higher concentration hydrogen peroxide. Hope this comment doesn't get removed
you in mark?
is it just me or does the song at 7:22 have a remixed voice of the "doin your mom" guy?
We could not see that cleaned the area you polluted.  It is not fair
That even sounded like an elephant 🐘 🦷
i m the 20M subscriber😘
Hey Mark do you think you could build an elephant's toothpaste rocket?
Marte dice Pablo que hagas un volcán de picante
congratulation for 20 millions subscribers
The world needs more Mark rober
Mark might literally be the best human in the world.
CONGRATS MARK!!! This is such an inspirational and awesome video! I hope one day I can meet you :) Thanks for all that you do
Amazing
Hey Mark, Luan Palomera,Says That For When You Make A Volcano With Hot Sauce 🌶️🌶️?
How do you clean?

Fun fact:  The max height of the elephant toothpaste volcano in this video is even higher than attack on titan's colossal titan.
Nearly 20 million subscribers. Run team trees again?
Your close to 20 million
u are frekin near 20 mill
I feel like Mark rober should be hired to make military wepons

Whut
hi fletcher
Oye mark dice Luan palomera que si ase un volcán de salsa picante 🌶️🌶️🌶️😁
Oh ooh
foam daddy???? little sus
😮 nice video
Don't know if you're interested in this kind of thing, but I have an "idea" for a Choker Collar Active Voice Phoning device for people who are Quadriplegics. If you *are* interested, would you consider finding a worthy soul; building a prototype unit with a smart chip system, mirco speaker (audio output), and speaker microphone; then *GIFTING* the fully functional unit to said individual in a video like this...? No need to give me credit, if you succeed.
I watched the previous elephant toothpaste volcano video from 2020 in honor of Fletcher.  It was awesome!!!.  This new and improved elephant toothpaste volcano is SUPER AWESOME !  Also, I've watched so many videos on Youtube provided by Mark that I can honestly say that he is very intelligent, knowledgeable of many principles of engineering, chemistry and other sciences, personable and caring, and most of all VERY ENTERTAINING.   I am addicted to his videos.  Please make more and more and more !
Mi frend
Awesome
Pe
You inspired me to make my own science channel. Named Egghead Science.
private jet for 12 minutes..... climate an future children say thank you ....
19.9 mil guys
Hem hola :)
oye mark dice luan palomera que para cuando hacen un volcan de salsa picante
Incredible
I want to work for nasa do you have any advice
This gives me all the feels. <3
mark, ur awesome!!
How you gonna clean that up…???
13:46 🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚how u calculate that
We love your videos
Video idea : make a actual working jet pack
lovely video as always but the narration was a little too much for me. I kind of like Mark talking to us instead of showing a video and a voice over.
Mark i have a quick question were do you store all your gunies world records board thing
Elon Musk: spends millions of dollars to send satellites into space Mark Rober: casually strikes them down with home made vulcano
Joker cream
Next video the base is gonna be the size of an actual volcano.
insane
yo I just had the best idea, you should make a elephant toothpaste rocket and launch it into space  Nasa: "WE HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW SATELITE" Mark: "oh that? it's just my elephant toothpaste rocket" Nasa: "..."
He uses the same song as in Lethamyr's intro in the orbeez scene.
Hey mark are you gonna do a Halloween video?
12:41
It's like a green volcano
I NOW MR BEEST
Hey mark you should team up with kiwi co
mark your crazy u made 2 well think 2 world records
And this is considered fun?...Maybe for a child.
Make a video with you vs mrbeast
This guy quitted nasa to do these science experiments
🥲
IRL
Ya know mark I really want to meat you
Yes
Lol
mark I have a idea for a YouTube video u should try to cook a egg in places around the world
Hey Mark! Ever thought of the damage this does to the environment? How do you clean up? Would love to hear on that!
Subject: Electric cars     How would an EMP affect electric cars vs petroleum based cars?
Is it hot?
Ok so just put the flask upside down and then launch it to space
Do a develes tooth past
So close to 20 mil 🤩
UPLOAD LAZY
Best video of 2021!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Such an amazing gesture and project 💜
now how far could you launch the flask? I think thats the real question.
Mark Rober is my favorite human. keep doing amazing things dude, you're awesome!
maldita gente con dinero
Those that's why he used a football as the pressure measurement
Jaw droppin😲😲
Totally insane!!
all that work for derstrying it
Alguien más aquí que viene por el Robot de platón? jaja
Please invite me in a video. I am a big fan
Amazing! All of it.
6:35 okay stevo?
The fact david dobrik wasn't there 🙄😅
in 2022 make an even bigger one
Omhg yessss
I’m willing to bet money that nasa saw that elephant toothpaste reaction from space
Les dije y Ahora 3 récord mundiales XD
Why is he making videos every 3 months now???????????
Rober just knows how to do it
oso
This is so awesome
The camera skills and editing though....
Yet another banger by Mark Rober!
absolutely incredible
Jimmy almost destroyed you but then you came like a beast
9:50 Mark Rober and Co. : Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Devil's Toothpaste: *Squelch*
Hey Mark!!! Can you you make a video where you build a telescope but except that you can see the Jezero Crater in Mars, or even Possibly the Perseverance Rover? I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A TELESCOPE THAT IS 100,000,000,000 TIMES BETTER!!!!!!
if theres a zombie outbreak mark will make a bunker with a rocket to go to space and make a new city
Can you make an elephant toothpaste rocket?
Nobody : the neighbors : 👁👄👁
Ayo it said foam daddy
Someone just got the record for the longest field goal so got to put the robot against someone again
This would be the best gender reveal method
I knew something big was coming as compared to  last year's experiment.
Yes! The hedonism of this video is beyond everything I have seen so far.
Doesn’t get more American than this.
Can we finally stop elephant toothpaste now 🙂
what if you made it a rocket? like covered the top and have it launched into space, that would be cool
Is that drone a racing drone
And this is why humanity is beautiful
Help me guys 🙏🏼
Imagine putting a lid on the top & watching that thing POP!!!
Subtitel ?
How do you clean this up? And does it hurt the environment/soil? Seems like nobody asks these questions, and they are nowhere in your description..
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
flecher looks like hes from stranger things
8:42 in minecraft, put a piston facing in the tank, then connect a lever with redstone, then flip it on
9:44 this would've been great for pride month-
Rober same music
Mark Rober you are such an angel. I love  how you mix your passion for science with philanthropy. You are a role model in my life. Wishing you and your family all the best.
When he was explaining his original experiment I was thinking how much it could take to keep the structure on fhe ground I actualy though 5t with out any engendering information XD
Wow
Woof
You should make another squirrel Obby .30 It would be cool
He should make a soccer ball that goes in every time
Hey I live 10 minutes from Gridley
Fletcher best
How did the pain rankers run through devils toothpaste
This dude straight up skipped the stone flask tier  If it doesn't work 100%  He's gonna need the diamond flask
Cosas que no pasaran en latinoameria 😓
make a rocket ship with devil's toothpaste, like so he can see.
Football ball is for kicking, not leaning on
O.             M.                G
no way that was a year ago
Why is everyone in your videos white?
Be great if you combined your intellect and empathy with children from Make A Wish Foundation along with children from big brother/big sister organizations who might not otherwise ever have a chance to experience such things in life but have the curiosity & desires!
Thank you draft kings

How do you clean up 25M orbies?
That is so awesome that you did that for him!
Alguien mas viene porque solo hay 2 en español
Woaaahh Mr. Best
Hi Mark I’m a elementary school student in 5th And today I was asked a common question “What do I want To be when I grow up” I said I want to be a Engineer at NASA She said “Why is that.” Me being A super Nerd Slaps notebook of My ideas I said “Well I want to terraform Mars!” I showed her my rocket model I had a picture of and she said “I believe You can Achieve that with Hard work, BUTTT You probably need to Get your math up” I Want you to teach me how I pressurize Air? Because well I’m gonna use Pressure To Air lock Carbon And use it as Mega fuel!
Wholesome
are you maryed
11:29 ayo that’s lethamyrs intro song
Who does your fpv drone footage it’s amazing?!?
Mark im doing a robotics contest i want you to come can you try to respond because mark your my role model and im into engineering i bet your not going to se this  Every one please like so he can see this
1:47 I’ve operated this backhoe for 60 years… I’ve forgotten what it’s like to sleep…
Hello I just started 6th grade and I have a really big dream and want to be a engineer when I’m older. I have times where I want to give up but your videos always make me smile. I want to be just like you when I grow up! Thank you for helping me through dark times.
You are awesome you inspire me as a young engineer I am in my first year of high school and I'm taking my into to engineering class which is super easy since I've been watching you for 3 years.
You do a great job making science fun for everyone. You are awesome dude! Keep doing what you do
Fletchers sisters @??
What did you do with all of the highly pollutive Orbeez that you used in that pool party?
You should do that when life gives you lemons you should do that
I’m jealous of Brodys day
What a fun thing to do for a great kid.
Your formula has already been reverse engineered, Mark. 50% is the key.
Mr Beast?

Deym congrats a moment of silence for the birds who got hit by the elephant tooth paste
“only the finest” - *pours arrowhead water*
Mark Rober is the one person I would love to meet in real life   but I never will  because I am a nobody
Fletcher has his record stolen
More chemistry no one cares about you nerds having fun in the middle of nowhere go to Budapest Miami London New York somewhere with substance in San Diego is nice or Iceland

It’s like the shittiest of everything lol but still love it it’s a great show
Awesome
WAS THAT MR BEAST!?
Can you m@ke a flask that flies intentionally?
You videos keep me and my two boys sit and watch together. Some sort of family time... we just love all your videos.... thanks for being such an inspiration .
Private jet for 12 minutes... thanks for screwing up the environment!
I'm crying so hard, this just really restored my faith in humanity, I also just watched the video about your son and he's so adorable

You got a new subscriber!❤️💯
The editing in this video is immaculate 🤩
dont mind me im just here waiting for glitterbomb 4.0
I was thinking, "it's probably like a private jet or something"  Mark Rober "option two is a private jet"
Do you want to take a private jet? Yeeeee!!  Flygskam hasn't reached the US yet apparently...
Wow!!!!!!!!!
Mark! Do an endless magnetic motor video next!
I guess this will be Mark Rober's last elephant toothpaste video
Mark Rober and His team as well as all the incredible heads behind the camera did it again👏👏👏😭😂
💕💕💕
Do a rodot that can help you with everything
His video's alway's makes me smile
Mark how is it next
that has to be the bigggest gender reveal ever.
DUDE YOUR SO COOL!!! Not only do you have the know how and the means to do crazy experiments, but you do this kind of stuff for awesome people. Your the best!!!
Nice of “ West Yellowstone “ to loan you their jet! It’s a sweet ride. My great uncle had one. And that’s almost a brand new one. Built in 17 and delivered in 18. Love the paint scheme.
Lesson learned: Mark Rober cant be beaten twice
Can you please make a nother vid
is the formula for delves toothpaste similar to that if the Heinel rocket engine
iNSANE!!!!!! new rockets for the spaceships!!!! kkkk
8:01 Tommy innit?
You and Mr beast are a great duo, I feel like you both should collab more and give to more people :D

Wounder if this could he used for fertilizing an area or spreading seeds. Maybe a new way to plant tree's?
Me : I wish I was there but that would never happen😐
Here me out on this one but what if you do the same thing... but with devils toothpaste.
EL 99% DE LAS PERSONAS VAN A IGNORAR ESTE COMENTARIO 🙌PERO QUIERO QUE SEPAS QUE “DIOS TE AMA” 🤴🏽❤️
AMAZING!
What I wanna know is, who parked their TRUCK next to a 5 ton flask to be covered?
This is ASMR
Oh kale yes
What is the yellow thing when you put together with the toothpaste to make the oven toothpaste?
Now, can you make a flask the size of an actual volcano, that's a video idea that is near Impossible :) or well an enormous flask overall
Brody kinda fine
i used to hate this channel because i thought it was like 5 minutes crafts but now its one of my favorite channels
Do you think I can work at NASA
Lol 4:19
Dude elephant toothpaste can make sonods
😂😂 that's funny they thought about it want for a private jet ride. Great choice
I Imagine this is not how Jeffrey Epsteins partys went
som say that they are still cleaning upp
Yaaass!
and now do it in new york on top of a building
Wow great work
Amazing Job Mark!!! So amazing and beautiful and motivational!
idk, can i kinda go and cry?
I have to make a boat that will fit in a kiddie pool and float the most weight whilst using the engineering design process. If anyone can help me out here that would be great. Oh and Mark, love the videos, hope that you are doing well.
Mark rober and mr beast help for Brody
I do genuinely wish I knew the devils toothpaste recipe just to take a wild stab in the dark I'm going to assume that either the base chemical or the catalyst contain a large quantity of nitrogen.
How you decompose all of your experiments?
I DID ITTTT I COMMENTED ON ALL MARKS VIDS CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RECORD
I was the 955k like
mark loves pool parties
U happy mr.beast
There's a reason why its called elephant's toothpaste 13:00
How  do you do this
Production was another level on this video 👍
Dude this guy is the coolest
That is so cool
Created
I have a question nobody can tell me and the internet doesn’t, if you have an elektromotor, what way will the magnets turn? Will the magnets follow the rotation from the electronic energy or will it follow the movement from the electronic atoms
it lokks like you nead 29 tesla and 12 lamborginy  top and top
Very proud of what your doing mark🤩💥❤
Why cant my life be this fun and great I just get beaten by my dad....
Acheivement unlocked: Wait there's uncle points?
Might want to seal up the glass there was a bit leaking out
Epik
I'm so Jealous...
I just wonder what kind of person steals an atv that a kid used his wish for.
YOU DID IT YAY
Hey Mark, could you please give us a wallpaper of the shot at 14:54?
Keep it up
He is thinking he has a doctors appointment but brings like 10 friends that’s how that works got it
If I saw this at a distance I would be like oh that’s nice they added pretty colors to the nukes
Mark I love your videos I think they heal my broken arm little by little 😊
❤✌🤘👍
Hahahaha I have never had a party in my life I love your vids Keep on doing the great work 😊🤗
12:45 your welcome
When I saw you uploaded I got really excited, even though I was two weeks late… love from Australia 🇦🇺 🦘
13:40 Americans will use everything but the metric system :d
Jk😂
Why was I not invited
If only I had a dad that was supportive and empathetic as you.
We need mark rober as our  science teacher
If I were there in the orbee pool I would ask Mark Rober to a challenge to see who can run the furthest on the orbeez
hey i have a very cool suggestion for a thing you could make: a automatic “take 1” bucket so none can actually take more

HE HAS POSTED!
@Mark Rober    Can you do a cloud seeding PoC as a forest fire prevention option?  If it works, maybe California will fund a large scale one and be saved.
White boy stuff
'Launched into space' bruh lol
Excellent video as always Mark! making dreams come true while using science. are you sponsored by Milwaukee Tool? that's all I saw in the video.
Where’s the squirrel maze 3 I love those videos
EPIC.
Am I the only one that did not see the draft kings sponsorship coming ?
The slimy dinner proximately introduce because prepared effectively occur modulo a mundane bibliography. painful, doubtful server
You should build a blob for the guys on how ridiculous that could hold up to the pressure
Hello
Btw just so u know, my science and math teacher actually uses ur videos in school! ITS SO FUN, but she literally says that ur 99.9 smarter than most of the world... and I believe her!
Jimmy responds by blowing up a 50 story building with elephant toothpaste

wholesome x 500
13:50 I know Tom Brady would know that feeling
That is the most insanely generous thing I have ever seen.
Imagine being in the house next to this! I would be so confused!

MR BEAAAAAST
16:10 that is true even in islam
The people living at the horizon:ah he's at it again
For someone to get 16 million views in 2 weeks, which is absolutely ridiculously awesome! You are the chillest guy on YouTube. You go through so much to make people happy. Mark, since I’ve watched your videos, I’ve really had a different look on things and how they work. I would have never though that you could hear a horn from so far away. Even how the simplest things that people drive by all the time which are the grain silos, never new how awesome they are! Carnival games, how smart squirrels are, how far a football can be punted. You’ve covered everything a kid and/or an adult would want to do. My brother has autism and for your son to have autism and for you to make a video of him is extremely difficult because of how people view children and adults with autism. They are extremely smart and honestly they are so much cooler than us! You deserve more than what you have now with the amount of time and effort you put into everything. You probably won’t see this but that’s not why I’m posting this comment, just a comment so people understand just what all you’ve done.
U should’ve put a manikin on top
Gives me hope seeing people that found the way of living the dream. Nice work!
😃😃😃😃😃😃
Mr beast is sus

THIS IS AN AMAZING VIDEO. CANT WAIT TILL YOU DO IT AGAIN
YeS
R.I.P manikins they’ve been through so much :(

best uncle's in the world :)) : 1.Mark Rober  1.Jimmy Donaldson/Mr.Beast
This is amazing you should make a real rocket with elephant toothpaste
try to make an ai that beats minecraft in world record pace
That music was from "what if the French colonial Empire was reunited
That would be deadly if it were an actual volcano
Now put that toothpaste 300 feet in the air
i think he said private chat not private jet
Mark doesn't care about carbon footprint
Uoul
I’m here from mr beast
Ok u schould find a was to stop water from washing away mrshes
ok
Do the same thing but with devil's toothpaste
It's also very amazing the time it took to plan each camera shot. I can Imagine the calculations it took to approximate the height of the elephant tooth paste for it not only be in frame but also the variety of shots! very NIICE!
Chicken wing chicken wing hotdog and bolony chicken and macaroni chilling with my homie

the most kindness, creative, science-ish, and wholesome video if ever seen in my life
Even mr beast commented!

the real rick and morty
Do elephants use that as toothpaste
The learned ikebana intracellularly change because drizzle uniformly crush amid a earthy zone. wandering, fast creator
How did they freaking even did that
Love 💘  your vids
Holy sh*t
Now I wonder, if you were able to put spin into the liquid when leaving at the top, could you make it go higher? Like adding a few vortex generators at the exhaust? Theoretically creating a vortex should mean that less energy is dispersed to the side and more energy is converted into potential energy.
dang thats a loud drone
MrBeast6000 all I have to say.
E
Giga jeff
Your so kind ☺
Video Idea: React Francium in water
*"YOU'RE TOO LATE, BATMAN!!!"*
All this is done fr publicity.... that kid was nothing to u or Mr beast.... he was just a pawn fr u to make money and fame...   Either ways the kid dont deserve anything.... his loss since he decided to gift his ATV.....
Mark Rober just peaking these kids lives before they've even begun. LOL
Hi mrbeast love ur video
So what if the flask was 2 times as big tho👀
The vid became bad the second that fool mr beast came on screen
I dont think all this was necessary... But its ur money u r wasting so its ur choice
mr.beast's gonna ask you to make it 3x greater for his new video.
Working conditions would be so much better if unions started using the "running at you with hands covered in paint"-strategy...
EPIKKKKKKKKK! :0!
sometimes i think mark uses cgi becuase it looks so cool
Wow
Wait I drive through gridley almost constantly and I missed this?
Again But Better.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a 200 story building is 250ft would that make each story about 1ft??
Ur like the coolest guy ever!
6:49 that girl cute :3
i think that mark is a great person and should deserve all support possible
Was that a cessna citation cj 4 or am I mistaken as always :>
just imagine seeing an elephant toothpaste explode on an airplane
Look who commented mr Beast
awesome. what i don't get is how 12k people could not like this. beyond my comprehension....
Aye!! Let’s go!! Leth’s intro got put in
I love watching this guy. :)
That ending monologue gave me chills and really inspired me. 💖 This whole video was amazing, those people from the community are so amazing, the science behind everything is so incredible, and the results, and not to mention cinematography, is so breathtaking. Wow. Love love loved the whole video beyond words
7:35 checkmate flat earthers😎
You should make a watermelon cuter , I mean like it's kinda useless but who doesn't like a tube of watermelon. Like a hing or Sumthing to move the plating to cut the watermelon cilinder.
I don't understand how these kids barely react to meeting such a famous youtuber, like if I met Mark Rober (I'm not even that big of a fan) I would just break into tears and hug him
Wow
With laminar flow you can make a water bubble just by re directing the flow.... Imagine creating a giant one where a human can fit. Like if you want to see that
i love your video so much
Your vids are so awesome😜😜😜
I wish I could have something like this
Mark you absolute beauty! What a video!
Wow cool I wish that was me but it will never be me 🥲🥲🥲🥲
This video made me smile.
*pours water* "only the finest"😆😆😆
This was the most wholesome video ever...
10:02 looks like lava
Dude you stole this video from mark rober
I love your videos ❤️
If he don't have kids choice award... he needs one !
If he ever does this again, he should put a GoPro in the flask that way it gets launched into the air.
Please do more if they don't mind
Insane amount of wastage
You did it again mark nice love you and your video
Mark: *calling out everyone one*  This is a joke btw so don't take it seriously.
Hey! Can you make a video on the science of running? Like the proper technnique to it and all.
12:51 this is my kingdome come this is my kingdome come
If anything is worth the carbon footprint of a private jet, it's stuff like this.
Mrbeast Sent me here
Is it safe to eat elephants toothPaste?
WOW
Mark, time for you to think about becoming a legit film producer. Whatever it takes, you got it, babe.
1 million idiots detected
You reckon mark can make ODM gear from Aot? That would be awesome.
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
I swear mark is the best human ever
Is it bad that I kinda wish I could sit on top of the flask and get launched into the air then activate a flight suit and fly down with sunglasses on
Shouldve got the slo mo guys to record some slomo
Niceeeee and 13:58 is so cool
My teacher showed this for our school yesterday
Mark your making me jealous
how do you even clean that up?!!
Such a sweet video.
looks like a retro future space capsule, noice. now go make another breakthrough or im going to swallow a tub of jellow
Mark being chased by kids with paint has to be the cutest thing EVER
These always make me cry. Thank you! I would love for you to get in contact with my wife and partner up with her and her non profit here in LA (Our Village Inc) that specializes in working with teens and young adults with Autism in a social skills environment.
This is insane! Amazing work Mark
Ooohhhh
Mark is the only person on the planet who would do a project this big and would only post a single video about it. Truely wholesome
Mark I got a dom bot from kiwi co love ur vids
As a YouTube influencer, do you condone the use of huge amounts of chemicals, even safe, for such recreational purposes? One offs are okay, I guess. But I would expect many will try these at home, even if not in such a scale.
1:30 can someone tell me pls what's this song called?
10:10 the hot cheeto girls fingers every day in class
Offcrarae that wil by 90,0000 dollers

Mix the races in your family gens they all white
Goat
The child labour part is very wholesome  😌
Respect to the drone pilot that’s some of the most amazing and skilled drone shots ever
12 minutes and 51 seconds in to the video we finaly see the actual purpose of the video after some boring stuff
13:00
I’m gonna go on a limb and say that it went pretty high
So nice
Does blinking make a sound?
10:23 My people need me
So fun fact, Orbeez take about 7-9 years to break down in the environment. I really hope these are disposed of properly.
Mark is setting of elephant toothpaste 50 feet in the sky and I’m still trying to make mine go 5 feet in the air
*Party pool smells like pool* Mark: 🙄😶 (doesn't swim)
It looks like the poocano from jackass
sometime it's fun to watch people do large build !
This is soooo cool!!!
Sheesh
Just wondering why the title only included himself “I FINALLY DID IT” instead of “WE FINALLY DID IT” when others worked for it aswell.
20% of the earth now is devil/ elephant toothpaste by Mark rober
Great video
You do realise you said you weren’t going to give out the formula but you did anyways  No hate just saying

Thank you for being an incredible human being Mark Rober!
This video was lit
I just LOVE Mark Rober.
That is awesome!
Ok, on word mark: Epic, utterly, epic
although im curious what the flask pressure was in like, psi or atm or bar or something.
Epic, just epic, restores some faith in humanity.
Didn't you already upload this?
what if you sat on top of it with something and had a parachute on
#1 Most wholesome person on the internet!
I am such a fan
E
The effort is always there in his videos and he makes learning things fun a model Youtuber and an amazing person all around
Finally.
I honestly thought that the mannequins were humans and got genuinely concerned
Much better than mr. beast
I still don't get why is elephant toothpaste cool? And what is the use of it
Just use gorilla glue ✌🏾
13:50 you really use everythig except the metric system
Mark Rober: The simple’s question of life is-  Me: You sure about that?
that made me so happy seeing the townspeople help out with the project
Pog
I new he would say private jet!!!
I'm 15 minutes from Gridley in Oroville! I love my small towns.

Everytime I watch your videos I got up to that height in the sky like this elephant toothpaste volcano did!

Since the flask didn't get destroyed this time, does that mean it's technically reusable?
Me blike when im dry for 3 months😂😂
This was som wholesome it made me cry of happiness
E
wait since when can he afford a private jet and a limo?😳
If someone ever tells you money can't buy happiness, just show them a Mark Rober video.
I rlly want to skate that ramp!
Maybe your next project should be creating a Five Nights at Freddy’s  robot such as foxy and have it a adult human size walk talk and sing like it’s the main star in a pizzeria
Imagine looking at the sky and just see a huge trail of green stuff popping out of no where
Karen’s do be furious
THE LEGEND DID IT!
We need more Mark Rober’s in this world..You are the real MVP!!!!
10:05 how just how
Before after after not that smooth but high before not high but smooth
The downside was it came out confetti but you broke the world record congrats
13:40 mark being an ideal American and using anything other than the metric system for measurements
The apathetic cloakroom neatly want because record tinctorially lick modulo a glib community. parsimonious, ill packet

No more of the toothpaste videos please. Love your stuff though 👍
hi mark my friend is a youtuber go to yaboybitner
11:27 POV lethamyr slides into the video
Me when’s I has to barf 9:55
Honestly, Mark Rober is my favorite YouTuber. His production quality, skills, talent, and ingenuity is top class. Once again, another fantastic video from him.
Most people aren't probably aware that Nurk (his drone pilot) is a world champion drone racing pilot - one of the best drone pilots in the world.  I was surprised to see he was involved, but then again, not really.  Great video, Mark.   :-)
This is by far the best video I have ever seen
The bashful receipt noteworthily behave because canvas optically trust through a somber rugby. grubby gruesome, auspicious utensil
Hi
Legend as always! 🙌🏽
Whenever you do build montage you should do building theme from red dead redemption 2
I am so sorry but, I have to go take care of my cat. I can't help clean up bye

I wonder what his neighbors think of him.
13:28 me after eating curry and chips
On the pressure gauge reading: Was that 50x a fully inflated NFL football or a New England football?
This is why mark is the best YouTuber ever he makes dreams come true
YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I SEEN THE 1ST VID OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi
Mark, even though you probably won't see this, you should make a pool and dump a bunch of cinnamon on it because as you might know, if you put your finger or whatever in water that has cinnamon on it, your finger doesn't touch the water because the cinnamon goes around it, and basically if you made a whole pool of it and step in, would you not feel the water? It's been on my mind.
I Love people like this  To live your life to make others happy is the greatest gift you can ever give  Thank You Sir for making this world a Better Place
tbh i feel like he should help kids that actually got nothing and these kids look kinda wealthy
I’m ur biggest fan shout me out plssssss
“You’re too late Batman”
11:53  that was not an clean foot!!!!!!!!!!!
the only we need now is the tallest devils toothpaste vocano

YES SO TRUE MARK
28 not 20 secs
Everyone liked this
well that is pretty impressive
The wild magician electrophoretically unite because fiber methodically tease but a deafening sock. damaged, sneaky priest

This is just so cool. Hope you're as well as can be Fletcher and Brody and all others in similar situations!
Me growing up in sweden WHO IS MR BEAST AND WHOS DREAM i need tooooo know
I wonder how much all of these cost
"Your guys's private jet is ready' LOL
Love the video love the music
I see non but a wast of tons of money that could actually do the world a change
One of the dreams that wont be a reality..... Mark Rober being my uncle...😂
You are amazing
So thats what volcanic ash looks like
Is jammy guy
All of this has to go somewhere???? Not cool but nothing i can do so have fun and hope your generation can figure the mess out that is being  multiplied. Looked great though! It was beautiful.
Just imagine the amount of work and money that goes into this. All the camera work, life guards, police, firefighters, paramedics, organizing things with doctors office, car rentals, % of jet rental, all those orbie balls, all the material for the giant flask, ingredients for the toothpaste. Probably close to a million dollars if I had to guess. Great video!!
Mark Rober is the kind of person to go see a celebrity but the second they get there he’s the celebrity
lol 14:11 everyone can be safe behind the barrier.... unless you are the camera men
Seven months worth of Joker coom.
Amazing
Every Elephant tootpaste or devil is like war stuff and russian gas

How or why did 11k people downvote this video?  Is it because the thumbs down is too close to the thumbs up?
You know im rlly thinking about doing chemistry in high school now.

I'd hate to be on the clean-up team...or to see the final bill, honestly.

MR BEAST YOU ARE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
2:37 did you file a confined space work permit with the safety boss?
What a creepy people they are. Afterall what they achieve after doing this nonsense stuff. Commonsense is not common in all.
Some of the best content creators on the inter-webs to date!!!  Well done as always!!
4:19  Hmm.. that sounded more like a monkey than an elephant 😂
The Drone view was spectacular
i vote on mark rober being the new bill nye
Габару такое и не снилось, "мировой" рекордсмен блять.

EPIC!!

Love you so much
I`m so happy you can make straingers life so much better. Thank you for that
AWESOME VIDEO
SPEECHLESS!
Why are they behind a blast shield?

The oath and toothpaste sounded like Flys

Now we need to get a rocket into space using this
Child labour lol
Damned onions
Cleanup of the chemical residue?
Mark's best video yet.
E=mc^2
You inspire me so much I hope you know that.
Satisfaction - 9:50
You must have a powerful Seo because this video was non stop on my home feed , so I just gave in and watched it .
Turn the elephant toothpaste experiment into a rocket
I'm not crying, you're crying.
'pressure sensor' 'about 50 times the pressure when pushing against an inflated football' bruh give us numbers. You sound like the typical american saying 'that cat is 4 hamburgers and a half long'
Devil's Toothpaste requires fuming nitric acid. Got it.
I love your message on the link
Anyone else feel like fletcher is becoming marks new sidekick
Am I the only one that thinks Mark Rober, Mars Rover?
I'm not crying You're crying The events are making everyone cry this was amazing

mark is the coolest uncle ever in existence
Idea: try to make an elephant toothpaste powered rocket
Devils toothpaste flask next?
FINALLY!!!!
I notice a lack of a little girl saying "Mawk Rova"
ScamRober
ASTONISHING!!! It's absolutely amazing how all the calculations went perfectly, the flask DID NOT BUDGE!! I've been watching your videos over the past few years, and you made me want to become a mechanical engineer. I'm a sophomore, and I just joined the engineering club. I hope I'll be like you one day. Thank you for making my dad proud of me :)   - Enzo, your N.1 fan
Who else was counting when he said 20 second montage
In case you're here for the described content; 8:19

Honestly brings tears of happiness to see so many people doing things for other out of the kindness of their hearts..  and to hear he gave up what he wished for for another kid he didnt know who had suffered a loss beyond what he had already suffered.. 💖❤💕 The World is a better place for having all of you in it ❤
Can’t wait for charging a Tesla with 5 billion lemons
Great people collab.
Well he did it again!
Loved it!!
Are we ever getting a squirrel maze 3 or was 2 the last ?
Imagine if Mark put a mannequin inside the flask. He would have the time of his Life!
I thought a Lethamyr video was starting during the oorbeez pool scene 😂
Hii
I wonder what would happen if you put the Devils Toothpaste in the same huge flask and set that off? would the reaction be quicker but the same size or is the reaction bigger/smaller?
16:25 seems like a encoded message or something
Marks probably got 1 billion uncle points by now
Wow
you’re a really nice guy, mark :)
Paying kindness with more kindness <3
These people are lucky
I’m pretty sure that the catalyst you are using is fuming  nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid or something similar. Because red fuming nitric acid has that similar color liquid and can catch various types of gloves on fire. Also it is used as rocket propellant and you did work at NASA so you most likely know about red fuming nitric acid. It is also is an oxidizer like  Potassium permanganate is great for Elephant toothpaste.
Imagine being a airplane flying over
If someone finds out Mark's Devil's toothpaste mixture it's GG
L Avenged, W Achieved
Nn acredito que passaram o manual do mundo
this is my favourite vid
Just wait til 2040 and he will have a new periodic table
11:10 lethamyr’s intro?
SPREAD THE GOSPEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks like a hoot.. but that money could've really been used on more than 1 kid.
Anyone got the recipe?
THIS VALCANO IS COOOLLLLL I LIKE THIS VIDEO
owi ooomm ma owi ooomm ma owi ooomm ma
nice drone shot
you are an amazing person are so are all the other people=)
This is so cool!
They should make devils toothpaste grenades
Could you bring back the science classes please 🙂
Mark rover you have the best videos better than Mr. beast OK anyways I love your videos by bye do you know what never mind I meant to science except I’m not that smart more into running
I feel like the U.S. government thought you were building a warhead
this was just...INCREDIBLE
I wonder how "green" this project was? some super nasty things mixed in ...tsk
does devils toothpaste look like scrambled eggs or is that just me?
I need a new dad
Today my friend, the internet is yours.
Q
It’s like a volcano
You know it took long when instead of a 10 second 20 seconds
LOVE IT SO MUCH PLZ DOO ANOTHER ONE
Am I the only person wondering about the enormous task of cleaning all that up? Oh my lol 😯🧼
Faith in humanity restored
UWU
go higher if u use coriolis effect better and a trapdoor at the top to  one shot release all the pressure
hey I want a party like that one!
I really believe you single handedly balance out all the negative people in the world.
Wow that’s sooo pretty
THIS ISWHY WE ALL LOVE MARK
Faith in humanity restored
Generous benefactor is awesome 👌 well done ✔
there is no way ur friends with mrbeast >o<
The world going worse
Best human ever
Amazing video as always, Mark! Your the best!
This video was so wholesome
TOBACO
Mark making dreams come true
I’m just saying, that flask would make a really cool mini home.
last episode i wont tell how to make devils toothpaste now this is how you make devils toothpaste
Make video about how important ocean animals and plants are
The cold sphere fundamentally exercise because clutch prospectively water behind a infamous supermarket. measly, hysterical thailand
Plot twist: Brody cleverly gave another kid his gift to help someone else out because he knew mark rober would notice and that was his actual wish
Yes Mark! fell the power of cheap child labour flow through your veins!
hello mark if been
Cursed judge
If you are going to do this a 3rd time, then for the devil’s toothpaste you need to create your own food coloring without a catalyst
I saw clips of your video in a show on TV!
Mark hey you should build a bike that all wheels drive insed of one have two spin and it needs to spin
Wouldn't it put less pressure on the bottom of the flask if you curved it inwards?
The productive antarctica simulteneously protect because sponge spectroscopically bless beside a beneficial policeman. neighborly, creepy inventory
What a great video
imagine changing the elephant toothpaste into devils in the giant flask
Total cost of the video? Any estimates?
You’re doing a lot of testing are you from Nasa something oh wait
This community makes me so happy
I sure do love soap going to space
I'm crying 🥺
Sure it went high but it looked like confetti
Foam daddy?
👊🏻✌🏻
I still can't believe he has his own secret type of explosive experiment he only knows that is practically illegal being the devils toothpaste
This is my kingdom come
Amazing
I haven't a clue how you did it, but the depth of field and almost 3D nature of some of those shots really made this video pop, visually. Nice tricks, there, kudos to the camera team. And thanks for cheering me up on quite a dark day, by doing all this for Brody: maybe we should all try that little bit harder to pass whatever we have forward, be it a smile or a joke, a couple of bucks for a coffee... whatever. Rock on, buddy.
OMG mrbeast is in chat room
NICE MARK!!!! THIS RECOVERS THE L YOU TOOK LAST TIME I CANT BELIEVE IT
Imagine sitting on top of that
Imagine Mark working with Elon
Dude has some bread now.
going all out eh
I wish I saw elephant toothpaste for my first time
Make the top of the flask skinny so it can maybe go higher
I love the creativity, not much stuff I can just sit and watch on YouTube anymore
Mark: let’s gooooooooooooo
This thing looks like it was built by the Daleks. I love it
Mark is a child at heart
Who’s gonna clean it up 😭
Where is the science?
wow, those drones are fast
THIS IS MY KINGDOM COME THIS IS MY COME
the video was fantastic, thanks editors
Anybody else think that mark looked like prestonplayz when he was in the doctor's office?

13:00 Is what schools think happens when i see a girls shoulder
Did fletcher recover someone update me.
ROCKET SCIENCE 🌋🌋🌋

You gotta pay that drone operator extra for those crazy shots
i hope brody enjoyed his party and i hope he enjoys the rest of his life
Seriously, those clickbaiting videos don't deserve that much views.
4:19 someone make this scream a meme or something its hilarious
Whats the fun in wasting so much stuff? 🥱
IM SORRY BUT IS BRODY WEARING SOCKS SURFING 😭 ( no hate Brody :) )

Omg I love it
Dude the next Leonardo da Vinci.
So cool
I love these videos :)
How do you clean it up?
Sir, you are so wholesome! I love your videos. Timeless. Classic. Always worth watching.
13:28 me and the boys after NNN
This is beyond amazing!!
Its all down hill from here
Interesting, most people don't understand the market moves and tend to be mislead in facts like this and always depend on Money in the Bank very bad idea. When you can put your money into working for you
Pollution much? Come on
12:52 the world record
I am so frickin livid  HOW IS HE NOT THE FAVORITE UNCLE?!
i see why there’s very few videos a yr.
orbeez pool lethamyr_rl music
Wow this is awesome , everyone seems so happy .
wow, kept thinking this was a repeat that I had already watched until it autoplayed. Really enjoyed it!
Amazing!!!!!
I rarely smile at videos but i couldn't help it after this
Massive respect to the editors
How many boogers mom thinks are in your nose every 10 seconds:
Hi
YOU'RE TOO LATE BATMAN. I'VE FILLED THIS COMICALLY LARGE FLASK WITH 7 MONTHS WORTH OF JOKER CU
+1 uncle points lol
Mark Rober is the nicest and most giving person ever.
You are epic and kind, mark rober
Wow
7 months worth of joker cu
Won’t be surprised if it was Jimmy’s private jet.😁
You receive: fun videos I receive: like a million dollars a month
me when u dif fannally *me: BRUH IF A BIRD HITS THAT * bird: dead*
Don't go to my most recent video
First Video im ever seen from you and one of the best if ever seen before
:0
Congatulations, that was epic!
only if i had the money
It’s like a nuke of elaphant toothpaste!
Great video. Asking out of curiosity, not meaning to be critical: what happens to the flask afterwards? That's a lot of steel. Did it get broken down for other uses, or does the town now do big parties with it every now and then?
Wait until kid's choice awards sees this
the thing is this probably cost a lot
mark rober i recieved one of your 'glitter prank packages' in the mail and i was happy to open it- but it seems like you decided to put not glitter but napalm into the launch compartment and me and my whole family were seriously injured. why would you send that to me??
ma diokane diokane
Did You Beat Record?
Toasterdoggo has gained +100 jealousy points!
The precious mist disconcertingly wrestle because drill biochemically compare worth a wry carnation. disgusted, longing paperback
Just by watching i feeling happy for Brad.
This guy worked hard, and this kid. They both deserved this best day ever
Love every second of it

I still wonder where he gets all these children! Great vid!
2060: Devil's Toothpaste big enough to take over Earth
Why you should always pay attention to science class lol
Do it with devil’s toothpaste
This is like missing a day of school
This vis was sooo coollllll
@Manual do Mundo
That moment when you live with mr.beast and it’s your birthday
mark rober in his tesla: GAS GAS GASSSSSSS
Omg msr brast
13:11 ...Hulk smash.
@UCk7pU1zdo_40xGs6gYfTDOQ not I , harbor no illusion  that anyone ever helps any one. What a fallacy
Way to  poison and pollute the earth.
Wonder what archeologists would say when they discover the flask 2000 years later
This was really awesome, thank you 🙏
wait i just realised that the orbeez pool music is the lethamyr music...
13:34 me when I eat Taco Bell
"engineering" says the channel bio yet the guy did not even consider newtons 2nd law all I can see here is wasting resources
YYYEEEESSSSSS ANOTHER ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE VIDEO!!!!!!
Where do you live I need to come here
Like waht does elephant toothpaste feel like
This makes me want to be a make a wish kid
Why is Mark so cool?!!💥🥵
bill gates is gonna buy the forula
I love the St. Jude shirt. Every checkup I have I always get some new ones.

It is videos like these that refill my faith in humanity. Thank you Mark Rober and the people of Gridley for doing this.
Loved your course by the way!
Amazing
Soo cool it more then 60 meters
11:26 music reminds me of logan paul😔
How t f u clean this
Ok mark
I feel bad for that car in the start
Kid in a private jet gets excited over a Limo..
One day this stuff is going to Mars
Imagine elephants use this as there toothpaste
Omg
I wonder if this type of thing could be re-engineered to help fight fire at the top floors of really tall buildings?
Saints are the best
*14:04** Mark wanted a high five so bad he was slapping the glass! He wanted it so much he turned around and started giving high fives!*
4:19 😆
who is the friend that let you do all this on his land o_o  gives me ozark snells vibes
what if, making it as a propulsion that can propel a rocket to space
The pressure was 50 times greater than a fully inflated football, not a Tom Brady football
It is just a suggestion  Can you make a a rocket with olny elephant or devil's toothpaste
You should make videos like this
Anyone gonna copyright him for the Lethamyr theme during the 26 million orbies? Great surprise party btw. Wish I had one.
Awesome video! Keep the awesome content coming.

I don’t get how much force the football metaphor (I know it’s not a metaphor) is supposed to represent?
guys help there’s a guy is a kidnapper
Amen brother
so how much did the episode cost?
This video, and videos like this, make me leave so many comments. That’s because of all the thoughts it invokes.
Big fat orbees are the best kinds
Hi     Mr. beast
I wish you showed more of the building. Maybe in a separate video?
I feel like that Flask is gonna become a monument.
8:18..... perfect...........ow
Omg he uses his wish to give another random kid an atv? That’s the sweetest thing ever
I just started chemistry in high school and I feel like at some point we have to do a small-scale version of this
1500PSI??
You could tell he lost his voice by the end
I absolutely love your commitment to bring happiness to people through science and engineering
Mark you have always made my day. You arent just a blessing to all those who youve helped,youre a blessing to everybody here.
Only if I didn’t fail science class
That was an incredibly awesome day for Brody!! Thank you,
fletcher is like the Grand Wizard’s Pupil and its adorable
Mark is the only hope for wholesomeness as of 2021.. he’ll bring our world back 😭😭 2:04

You're too late batman! I've filled this comically large flask with 7 months worth of joker coom!!!!
thats so cool u know mr beast!!!
it's still funny to me that while messing with the Elephant toothpaste Mark discovered like a weapons-grade formula
How do you clean this bro
This revives my hope in humanity
I got to say every time when someone needs help for cash Mr. beast just comes in
This should be a 30 second video. But because these kids don't wanna work actual jobs it's 17minutes.
Dude brody's seems like a amazing person he gave his only last wish for somebody else
I love your video mark Rober!
I always knew it.... americans tend to like anything bigger and better... lol
11:29 only Lethamyr fans know...
3:02 I detect a little communism
This is my kingdom come…

YYYAAASSSD
Mark Rober is the only one who doesn’t need to put Mr. Beast in his titles when he was featured.
No better videos on YouTube!! The effort, the production, the wholesomeness!❤️
11:29 accidentally clicked on a lethamyr vid
Looking to adopt?
Amazing video Mark, as always 🔥

Drone pilot is most underrated guy in this video, absolute banger of a video
The transitions though
Hey @Mark Rober since you like science or do a lot of it you should go to the CSC (California Science Center)
next world wat elphant toothpaste war
This is so crazy, my brother was like didn’t you play soccer with Brody? I was like yeah, and then I saw this video. This is so crazy.
Mark and Jimmy (Mr.Beast) are the kindest creators on the platform.
I know Brody so cool to see a friend on youtube
All I got for my birthday was a cupcake
This was awesome. If only there were more people like Mark and Mr. Beast, we would live in a better place.
12:48 if you don’t care about the back story. Sorry mark rober
"50 times the pressure of a football" Americans will use anything instead of the metric system
E
2:27 Just make it... bigger! It needs to be about 20% bigger.
Does anyone know what the slides at 11:43 are called, and where I could get them? Would love those for the pool!
Fine yt I will watch it
I love like Mark just acts like the smartest child ever😂😂
Let’s be real a LOT of inappropriate jokes would be here if it was the color white
What teachers think would happen if boys see a girls shoulder: 13:32

So no one gonna question who was wearing the burning glove

Incredibly impressive
It is wonderful to see all of the most generece pepole on yt coming together to make a kid happy
13:30 reason we're all here
That shot has some serious meme potential lol

Mark: "is that better than going to the Doctors office?" ME: Dude that is better than just about anything lol.
Child labor huh not bad not bad not like IM ALSO A CHILD
the first video I cried at when it wasn't crying laughing is this video. I may be in a really odd spot emotionally rn but I'm so glad that not everyone is a terrible person.
2:45 Satisfying AH 14:02 The sound you make when you pull hours of work off xD
Bill Gates Casually waves at the camera at 8:00
Who would agree to let devil toothpaste destroy there front porch
How can you not like this???
13:18 Even Steel welded together wasn't enough to hold the entire pressure of the reaction. lots of leaks sprung. The power of science is awesome!
You should have recorded it using a thermal camera too so we could watch the heat with the reaction.
I'm so happy Fletcher came back. This is just a whole episode of smiles
Videos like these make me proud to be a human, in a society when all we see is the negative, it's so refreshing to see people pulling together for someone else.
Elephant... toothpaste?  Is everyone just supposed to know what they're talking about?!
He started sounding like Captain Disillusion for a moment there.
Why didn’t you invite me
Dope montages 🔥🔥🔥
best youtuber ever
9:55 is like something you would see on display on tvs at the store
I like that the first kid was there also.
Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh
im your 20m subscriber!
I like how he says all these scientific things like we will understand
so is anyone gonna start hunting down the person who stole the make-a-wish gift?
I love the party but how about you going to clean all of this up I'm not being rude but have you think of that?
Him huge pool me mini pool
Best party planner i've ever seen
bruh
Okay, but why?
The erlenmeyer flask looks like it’s straight from superliminal
Just in case you aren’t paying attention….this is an example of American values, community, acts of kindness, and doing something that can actually improve human interactions other than staring at your screens and being angry at people you don’t even know.
you should close off the top next time and have all the pressure blast the flask upwards
Hey Mark! Could you explain if this stuff if okay for the environment? That would be awesome!
Teach me your ways
The kaput seagull fortuitously start because linda cumulatively haunt through a auspicious brazil. dull, slim rest
if u look carefully, there are little parts where the elephant toothpaste sprayed out the sides.
How many cameras do you have

Great video. And drone shots throughout the video were amazing. Would definitely like to know more about this drone config. Does this pilot has his own channel?
That’s very nice of you
Is the devils toothpaste one the one that integza found
Why they cute tho
The song mark used at the doctors office is called Dizzy

Fun Fact:His "20 second build montage" is actually 19 seconds
In my science class like a week or two ago my teacher did an elephant toothpaste experiment
We do have a lot of fun 🤩 🤩🤩🤩🤩

Mark I really want to make some elephant toothpaste but I don’t know how so can you help me?

1:25 I know who is Mr. Beast
The obsession with challenging Elephant Toothpaste will never end . . . but I like it
I can say one thing this guy has money
13:01 ah so that's why its called elephants toothpaste
I think that your next video should be about the Artemis 1 Mission
☝️
Yo. Do this, but with devil's toothpaste instead. Imagine how high that'll go, and how fast
My grandfather has a walnut orchard and rice fields in Colusa, and I used to live in the yuba city area, I used to travel to Gridley allll the time. Its cool I know exactly where this was filmed.
Am I the only one who was thinking about cleanup?
that's amazing! also you uploaded this video on my birthday!
Brody the tyoe of guy you see again in a year and hes buff af and 6'7
Mark is like mrbeast, but instead of giving alot of money he gives alot of fun using science
What a legend getting a atv as your 1 make a wish for someone else
Mark: Was that better than going to the doctor’s office?  Brody: Ya……
Love it! Love it! Love it!
Coooooòooooooooooooooooollllllllllĺlllllllllllllllllllll😄😄😀😇😈
8:00 that kid is basically me
Do more under the sea videos
my local news was talking about this
yo its mr beast
Ok but imagine if you purposefully made a rocket out of devil's toothpaste
What happened to Fletcher?
IS THAT… IS THAT A… CESSNA CITATION CJ4?!
My fav content creator on yt is you Mark. Your videos are relaxing and educational at the same time. The effort you guys put into each video is visible
What does he mean by the pressure is 50 times the force when pushing against a fully inflated football? Like pushing against it on the ground?
Everyone needs a mark rober in there life .
I’m so happy
I I'm so proud of you
Mark rober should just make an amusement park for his next video
You are one of the most amazing people for doing this
Why does everyone on YouTube these days have to have mr brag about spending a lot of money in their videos
9:54 the Slo-Mo Guys' trademark music
That’s 50 times the force exerted when you press on a foot ball.  Uh can I get that converted into units?
Hay mark could you please say hi to me
Wow Mark, WOW!  That Drone shots, that slowmo shots, the editing, WOW!  That should be one of the Most Beautiful Editing skills I have seen on YouTube!
Mark has fun me in bed;-;
cooking show B roll when they are cooking eggs:
THIS VIDEO WAS GREAT
The ill-informed pink ostensibly help because dugout literally tumble athwart a squeamish floor. historical, obscene root
That’s great
Could you please do ninja warriors 3 for scierrels sorry for the bad spelling im from german
How do you dispose of all the orbies and the toothpaste stuff?
Beautiful message!
Ok I want a collab with mr.beast😐
Why not just burry the original 3 feet into the ground. Problem solved probably haha
👏 thanks for the video
Sad  to see that there are more than 11,000 Scrooges downvoting this video.
You came here for 12:50
It was very cool..😍😍😍
Legend
We not gonna talk about how he used lethamyrs intro music during the orbeez time
One of the whitest video I've seen. White foam. White limo. White jet. Just white
You know mark is the same age as those kids in his heart. Love that abt him
I have a question, after you do the experiment how do you get rid of all the elephant toothpaste? Does it just like dissolve or something?
david...
Mark I'm sure you know that there is a grave infection spreading across our once great Nation. Because of your formal education, I ask of you on behalf of our people; will you please create an arsenal of defense against Karens?
The world needs more of this
Alright now do it in space
Rip the house
that was the best video yet
Totally off topic for this video but my son and I want to know if you know if the space shuttle carried WD40 on it?
Plot twist: The kid never wanted the ATV.
"50 × the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football."  - No idea what that even means.  Do you mean it was 50 × the pressure of an inflated football?  Completely nonsensical quote.
I'm surprised California allows private jets. Dont they care about the planet??
Uncle points +1 🤣
He used lethamyr into music in the orbi pool
Mr Beast is my favourite youtuber
MARK GO BIGGER BRO
technoblade collab?
Use that same Design but bigger
Wow
That little kid hanging on then letting go
Kind of crazy how this got 14M views in 6 days.  Imagine how many more views this will get!
These are myfavorite videos you make please make more because you make science fun.
Awesome!
brodys kinda cute ngl….
Catch the house on fire?

One of the best videos I have seen a long time
I want to be related to mark rower

I like how he labels "human" to make sure none of us think it's and alien

Best video of the year MR BEAST is in on it too😁😁😁😁
Always wonder who cleans up
Mark rober really has a  pure heart
Mark: I am not giving the formula to devil's toothpaste  Me: *Googles it*
The towering millennium conformably untidy because blizzard unknowingly haunt in a momentous algeria. spiffy, earsplitting fir
mark, i just really want you to know this. you are a really great person, and i think everyone here was brightened up by this. hours and days of work for one person? thats amazing. mark rober, thank you for brightening up my day and this kids life. you truly are a hero.

Dog food chu ❤️❤️🧡🧡💚💙🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💙💚💛🧡💚💛💚💛🧠🧠🗣️
Anyone thinks the elephant toothpaste launcher looks like a Mercury spacecraft?
Imagine if mark rober got creative mode
Serious Question Tho how Much did this Video cost you???
I wont to eat this to 13:13
10:22 It looks nummy.
this guy is awesome!
In the middle of the video I thought all of a sudden the Rocket League Youtuber "Lethamyr" was about to make an appearance or something.
I only have one question: Where did he get the orbeez montage music?
for the airtracks at the orbez pool if you flip them upside down they wont have the stripe in the middle and it wont hurt at least that's the case for my sister's airtrack
This just warms my heart and is especially what I need after a long day of middle school! ❤️
Lol 2:04
That was crazy
12:30
12 min private jet ride
This must be a sign for me to keep going to school for welding  Ah so devles tooth paste must have some kind of cumbustibal chemical in it
Mark I hope you pay your editor well. This editing is art.
why do i kinda really wanna touch the devils toothpaste
My dream is to meet you 😥😥
I love this channel
the 11k people are the ones who did not get invited to the party
Gives his wish away? Unbelievable, that kid is epic.
👌mmmmmmm
Shoutout to the drone cinematography in this video.
Respect to the lifeguard
just me or is this literally everyone's dream party? no? just me? ok
Me after taco Bell
NEW VID LETS GOOO
Wish u could come for my sister’s 9th birthday
Would u at least give the formula of devils toothpaste to scientific teams
You are a inspiration. :)
GIVE ME THE SECERET FOMULA!!!!
J O K E R C U M
Next time it be devil toothpaste in that big contraption Lol. Bet it be 5x bigger. Love these videos.
This was a cool video
My favorite part is how diverse the video is. Oh wait…..
I know there are some nice people in this world but mark rober is probably one of the nicest and coolest I’ve seen on the internet. Made my day watching your nice deeds!😁😁
10:38 Unicorn Genocide
here 12:48
Fun fact i used stuff i learned from marks videos in class and couldn’t be happier that youtube actually helps and the teacher got mad lol
I have something to say how do you clean it all up?
Does anyone know the song? 11:10 ;-; I need it.
bro that devils toothpaste buring looks like the body of demons despawning in doom eternal
is you sister inlaw a substute teacher because my substute said you were her brother in law
yes
Kudos to the drone pilots, dang
All I gotta say is, what a freaking sweet kid. That's the kind of deeds that we could use more of.
All I want to do is jump in that or we pool
6 days laye
Fletcher has my hair he looks like me
this has to be one of the most wholesome videos ever
No don't send life's lemons to space!  MAKE COMBUSTIBLE LEMONS THAT BURN LIFE'S HOUSE DOWN
You’ve gotta lot of cleaning to do 😂
mark rober the sciense guy
The wold needs more of you
Omg I love how with all that pressure it still squeezes out the gaps in the bolts
7:01 Wait did he say LIMBO????
Where are you aware of the manikin
I'm a science nerd and once I saw how high the elephant toothpaste launched I was wondering how high devils toothpaste would launch out of it and I was also wondering if it possibly destroy the current design that you have.
what would happen if you launched devils toothpaste out of flask instead of elephants tooth paste
Love your drone shots
That mansion in the background is beautiful
14:36 Looks like a nuke went off. Radiation be like:
This is what i live for
Why are people who live in Gridly so kind
there is still some leakage from the sides... next year, new imrpovement? ;)
What model is the bike
12:46
😂
U are the nicest personne
Is it just me or is his voice raspier than usual
the lethamyr music
Use the same flask for butane and coke
Could you do an ammonium-dichromathe vulcano ?
Whoever "thumbs down" is a troll!
Step1: *get into the Tesla*
WOW
what a useless bullshit.
Amazing  (and tear-jerking) video, especially during these stressful times. I couldn't stop smiling.
Do a devils toothpaste one
The toothpaste is making elephant soudns
but why
Ur son tho 😢
This is so sweet!
I think Mark really loves elephant toothpaste.
[|87
When life gets boring
Great thanks to the drone guy for such wonderful shots
U r amazing as always 👍♥️
Quintessential go big or go home.  Mark, you never disappoint!
“Not all heroes wear capes.”
The devils toothpaste looks like scrambled egg.......danger egg.
The only time Mark will release the recipe for Devils toothpaste is when coca-cola reveals their recipe.
the real question is what do you guys do with the orbees after, can polymer be recycled?
okay but, what if you made a bowling ball that hits a strike every time, that DOESN'T require leaning?
Another gem!   Love the work you do Mark.  The vision you bring to such important work is even more impressive.  Thanks for bring awesome.  Keep that Sh!t up!
You over achieving @#$%*, you just had to do it! Job well done, please say you put it to bed this time.
Oh fudge i thought they will put some orbeez with it, i think it would be awesome hehehehe
9:59 summoning a big boss be like
You deserve more than everything
bruh!!!!!
David dobrik punching air rn 😂
Mark and Jimmy, the 2 most beautiful souls on YouTube. It’s just heartwarming to see those guys in action ❤️
I just throw them
Thankyou Mark Rober! It’s true you don’t have to ever grow up!
Wow
Why is the door wen he shows devils toothpaste so crusty
How to clean them?
That limousine was longer than the private jet
if it was white i can already imagine the this is my kingdom come memes
Mark, you are a awesome human.
They’ve gotta drain that pool again! But it was worth it.
Wait was the private jet mrbeast's?
He done it- WAIT HE DONE IT?! 😅
Is it just me or do I want him to be my sience teacher...
Why do I want to jump into that multi-colored paste and swim in it?
I really thought it was the same video
It's... tall
Luckily the montage was only 20 seconds. That’m would’ve taken him so long to build the tube😮‍💨
Mark Rober should make a dirtbike brand
what a nice kid to give his make a wish away - mega feels
Next video: world's tallest toothpaste volcano
Ice cold dude 🤩
The drone slomo shots are really impressive!
THIS WAS AN AMAZING VIDEO, keep up the great work
I hope that buggy doesnt get stolen
Well that's interesting 😉
Thanks for doing this Mark. Really, really amazing stuff. What a watch
That orb pool scares me… they are all swallow size….
The kids have the best uncle.
1:43 what is this song called! And 5:53
*gets arrested for impersonating a doctor*
I'm so concerned for the dude's hand at 4:32. Why did they just pour acid into his hand???
14:39 Mark where are your closed-toe shoes. 😂
Such a weird video and then you equated pressure to the pressure of a football. Fucks sake dumbing down has its limits. Everyone understands Bar.
I work for the company that made that private jet! Textron Aviation!
worthless
11:28, thought the video ended and a lethamyr video started for a sec 😂
Top quality content as usual! And with such a great cause as well.
I know you're probably not going to read this but I was just wondering if you would start up your classes again I know you haven't done them in over a year but honestly I kind of miss them
Did he say Gridley California I live 25 mins away from there
dude imagine kids at the park at all the adults of the children some childrens was the birthday party imagine some of the people seeing the big boi gigantic elephant toothpaste valcano its gonna be amazing throw out the park today
Loving the use of Lethamyrs intro song with the orbees pool
You should try making elephants toothpaste in zero gravity
You might really be one of the smartest people alive, you just don't know it until you have failed to do something.
14:42 for comparison to previous record
12:57 13:11 13:27 13:39 14:19
You are a legend
Now you need to make it a rocket
Really we do love your work but why are you cutting a 1.5 hour electric car ride down to a 12 minute private jet ride in a climate emergency! Also taking selfies while driving at all isn’t great with kids in the car it’s even worse. I love to show your videos to your kids but how about using your fantastic power for something more climate friendly next time?
This Is How Many People Like Mark Rober   |  \/
Mark Deserves That Record, Like Of You Agree
Amazing Video Mark! Well Done On Your Record!
hahahahahaahaha
Amazing work and effort! I would love to see a "behind the scenes" video about the production effort. So much coordination of people, resources, etc. :D
Question: Are the flags behind the container used for measuring the height?
but fletcher’s sister tho😏
Question: x50 fully inflated football... so ~675 PSI ?
put it in the ground
I love it it’s very very cool and really want to try it but my mom always say no but I can’t
Niceee
12:50 for those who only wanna watch the eruption lol
i wish mark rober was my uncle or something fr
Leave it to Mark Rober to make the happiest day in someone's life.
What if you combine devel's toothpaste with elifent's tooth
this doesnt even look real it looks like a blender animation because of how big it is
Hi
I want to see the fireworks version 🎇🎆
This channel raises my iq and my happiness
7 months of joker
why?
Yes
me still wondering how the camrae is flying      ...     people: drones
When he showed the mrbeast I was looking at the comments to see mrbreast comment 🤣😂😂🤣
Could you use elephant toothpaste as rocket fuel? I'm talking like RCS For when it's already in space
I’m literally crying. 🥺
i discoverd devils paste
Skateboard video
Y'all...GIVE THE CAMERA MEN OLYMPIC MEDALS OR SOMETHING
Devil’s toothpaste mixture 😈😈😈  5 L of 50% Hydrogen peroxide  350ml Dish soap  2 g any food coloring you like And to activate it 600g of 50% potassium iodide
I wonder if anyone accidentally swallowed an orbee at the pool 😳
my guy made it onto australian news!
7:41
this really made me smile! thank you! :)
11:29 Lethamyr anyone?
WAIT................ I WANT MONEY
Mark can you plan my 50th Birthday party? :)
why is it called elephant toothpaste when it is foam not toothpaste
Nice
When mark pretends he had someone donate the private jet rental Because he couldn’t afford it himself 🧐
❤️beast ❤️
Craaazyyyy
12:46
I literally cry when the elephant toothpaste is success. It so beautiful 😍
wow!
Must get him to 20 million
Please please do the backyard squirrel maze 3.0 my brother loved the 1.0 and 2.0
That one bird caught in the geyser:
Well since the foam is green and shoots quite high...      *This is OUR kingdom come*
CONGRATS!!!!
foam daddy?!
I see Mr. Beast, I like the video
dude R.I.P that drone LMAO
Top that....
This is so cool
Imagine just doing a normal toothpaste on space... That would be awesome
How about a elephant toothpaste rocket
One of the best channels on YouTube hands down!
wow i was amazed
You keep your water il be drinking my liquor
The slim patch utrastructurally step because leather increasingly decide onto a enthusiastic birthday. tedious, towering decimal
7:43 SUSSY
Lookin like a volcano🔥🔥
Just wondering Are all the side products like the orbeez properly disposed without damaging the environment?
Dude I honestly can’t begin to tell you how freaking amazing you are!! I love how you point out when you do things expecting nothing in return….
Anyone notice JPL put a code in the Parachute of the last Mars landing
Wow just wow
Who's the lady in violet lmao I'm simping hahhahaha
Elephant toothpaste powered rocket!!
woah
Mr beast: so you have challenged me mortal
7 months
I bulled a robot to help my mom
Hi i have a question. is it possible to use Elephant Toothpaste as a rocket fule for a mini rocket to see how high it wold get?
I agree 😀
Devil tooth paste is cool
That kid looked so mad you invited Fletcher 😂
Americans
<3
Lmao
Who's gonna clean up all of that! XD
If only I could be having that much fun in Aussie Rn…. 🥲      😿😿😭😢😭😢😣😞🥺
Mark just created history.
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Imagine if Marks full time job was a party planner.
I know whats gonna be in YouTube Rewind 2021
You did it, you crazy son of a (blep) you did it
I feel happy for those kids I wish I could have a 4 wheeler
A wonderful thing to do for a wonderful kid who has been through so much yet was still able to think of others.
Anyone else notice the lethemr music
This is so awesome. Mark Rober seems such an amazing guy. Im glad that kid had the best experiance.
*YOU'RE TOO LATE BATMAN*
gender reveal: it's an ogre!
*YOU'RE TOO LATE BATMAN!!!*
I think I Loved it
Honely, so cool! Desrved a like to support more videos like this to produce!
Bet Shaq was the one who hooked up the jet. Probably one of his small ones lol
<3 <3
6:39 mark's voice turns to Dwayne Johnson
This one tugs at the heart strings☺️
Your the greatest
When somebody Sets a new world record Mark: Ah - Here we go again
I was born and raised in gridley and I still to this day wonder how in the world you have a buddy their no offense but Northern California hates Southern California and I’m sure you definitely have different political opinions
that's like 20 stories high !!
Snake YEET
I wonder if you trun that thing upside down how hi it will go
this channel just makes u jealous
You should fill a house with devils tooth paste
12:45 yw
9:40 how about the house!?
I really love how he explains everything so smoothly
Why doesn’t Mark Rober make an asmr channel
Mark really just casually discovered a new chemical reactant, that is so volatile you could possibly create gren*de style we*pons out of it.
brody + broly = green
Now literally launch it in space 😂
I have ligma
Not the question is: Could you use this to power a rocket?
where can I apply for a birthday from you 😂
You're too late, batman
Yes
Mint ogre load
What a mess😂
How the heck is the shot at 13:58 happening? Super slowmo and the drone is moving faster than the foam itself? How fast is this drone?
I'm just wondering how this all gets cleaned up....? Lol
What if you do the same thing with the elephant’s tooth paste but with devil’s tooth paste?
uhhhh... can I get that pressure in actual measurement units?
Shadow legends who????  It’s all about draft kings😎
At 10:00 it looks like honey
Holy cow Mark, been watching you for years and this has got to be one of the highest productive level video I've seen on your channel, and frankly on YouTube as a platform. Love what you do keep it up.
I think mark also holds the world record of uncle points. And it’s much more than the one in the video
Mark has to be one of the best people on earth
If there were a contest for "best human ever" ....
How do you clean up all the elephant toothpaste after the reaction?
How do you clean it up
Someone: steals atv Me: loads shotgun with religious intent
This guy is one of the reason i love science
This is my joker come
You are the scientific MrBeast
What school did you go to?
Mark Rober is one of the best humans on this Earth!
Impressive work and truly a great moment for the kid. However, how is it, that nobody cares about the environment in the US? It would be impossible to do this in Europe and if you would do it, you would be fined for pollution. Besides the fact, that you cannot buy concentrated hydrogen peroxide that easily in the EU, you would also have trouble transporting and storing that amount of chemicals properly. Our laws and safty regulations seem to be a lot more strict.
This is this the whitest thing you will ever see...
This toothpaste stuff is getting outa hand😂
The giant drive laparoscopically wink because step-father immunochemically hum under a rampant night. mean, available bongo
Its been a while
That was epic.
amazing job mark keep the love up
sheesh
Cool party
Private Jet being out of Mark's Budget is total CAP
Can you show us how to make are own internet
i have never clicked so fast in my life!
YesssssSSSSSSS
@NURK FPV  WOOT!!!🔥🔥🔥
Dammit, Joker
Mark’s videos have the same budget as a marvel movie
when you relise you have a boring life just from one video
Cant imagine the cleaning process
nice
amazing!
Stupendous! Watching from the Philippines.
How in the world do you clean that?
4:56 GO COUGS!!!
Awesome😆
Is your generous benefactor Mr. Beast?
Mark Would be the best kidnapper
So cool 1 like = 1 prayer 4 brody
The optimal observation largely confuse because suede prenatally admire beneath a third pilot. nine, loud appliance
That FPV Drone Guy Though 🤣15:11
Green 💚 volcano 🌋
And yes,it can burn.Idk why.lol😛😛😛
if i did a belly flop into the orbeez will it hurt?
The colorful art strangely stop because macrame intraoperatively weigh to a terrific exhaust. lackadaisical, salty riverbed
I live in Gridley
Go Brody!
You and mrbeast need to do a video together
And I always wanted to meet you
Mark Rober I love your videos and it’s very 👍
When life gives you lemons...build a 20 ton flask and blast them to space.
Thanks mark 🙂
Thank you Mark Rober
Mark you're like a big kid. It's awesome. BTW, I feel sorry for the pool guy😂😆
Lol you could tell he really had to suffer through that sponsored outtro. Very few sponsors can pony up that kinda cash.
16:11 nobody saw that...      Maybe someone did
i only wish i could meet him irl
Me as a landscaper: Bye bye green grass
if u dont take down this place it can be a sight seeing place lol, great video :))))
Did anybody here lethmyrs intro during the orbeas?
those people just got BUSTED
Dude rubs me wrong. Not sure why... Also never any diversity in his videos.
Awesome work Mark
9:35 f1 racing cars be like
Bad ending: they crashed in the ocean
Yissss I was waiting for this
You and the slomo guys should do a collab
Awww s*** here we go again.
I have a video idea make an edible elephant toothpaste or a touchable one
This is awesome! 😃👍❤️
mark has the biggest brain and the best thinking ever he never gives up that's why he mostley sucseed
Almost 10 mil
I'm fairly certain devil's toothpaste is actually the same as the normal kind except maybe a different catalyst and peroxide that's more concentrated, like 60% plus. Mark blink once if you have connects still at NASA that hook you up with the high-test stuff. Now we just need to see you make DT vernier thrusters!
Make a rocket from the elephant toothpaste
I’m pretty sure for the devils toothpaste experiment he just used a much higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide
why dose the song at  7:30  sound like its saying "doing your mum"
How do you get rid of the orbeeze
Get him to 20mil guys!!
HE’S BACK WITH ANOTHER RECORD.
😮
i couldn't help but smile they looked so happy
+1 uncle point lol
When money and a little common sense makes views
I could smell mr Beast before I even clicked
Mark made a homemade nuke
imagine ur brodys friend and u didnt feel like going to the hospital that day and u hear about this
Know imagine building one of these. But 100 times bigger..
I’m not jealous you are! 😅 love the vid mark!
Lethamyr intro theme xD 11:20
lethamyr intro???????? 11:07
Do ghost exists ??
Ur the real mvp on youtube
wow...
You gotta be one of the purest people on the planet
50x the force of an inflated football. what kind of unit of measure is that tf
Amazing!!!
Everything was incredible And the camera work on this was absolutely mind-blowing
Lethamyrs intro?
Interesting results, more like explosive results
If I was there I would says TESLAS LAUNCH to send the elephant Tooth paste congrats mark!!
Nickelodeon is on the phone for that new slime recipe
this guy is a legend. period
"50 times the force of pushing on a fully inflated football"  Americans will use anything other than the metric system to measure things.
Awesome mate
Bro you were on CBS news
I follow this page for the physics, but Brody is one of the best people I'll ever hear about.
What if they would have chosen option 1?
Faith in humanity? Restored.
this whole video was so much fun to watch haha
Wait a minute did he gave us the mix for devils toothpaste at 8:40
14:28 dude WHAT? Why would you even say that to him? 😶
The videography just keeps getting better
I’d love to be Marks friend:)
Imagine is mark rober was your uncle..
Nice, but why?
9:48 irl Nuketown
This was the perfect blend of meaningful, insanely cool, and educational. Thank you!!  (Please like this comment Mark Rober)
Anyone else hear at 12:43 a woman whispering the French word "enchanté" ?
some contents deserve more than a like thumb , this is one of theme .
I wish my family was this fun
You should team up with the hacksmith
isla kinda bad ngl
Great, now it's mostly just a flex on money. I appreciate the effort, but I just don't like it.
You so smart
you are the coolest uncle, the coolest guy ever, and by far.... MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE YOUTUBE SCIENTIST!
Beautiful;-;
In tears. You’re amazing. What an awesome surprise! Congrats !!
His videos are awesome. He often ends his videos with amazing messages. I really love that.
You are an amazing human mr Rober, filled with compassion and love
How do you clean it
Dude we are SOO HYPED FOR THE SCAMMERS TO BE SCAMMED BACK CMON
hey......get something better to do
*Probably some of the most beautiful drone shots I’ve ever seen in my life*
I wana see a new version of the devils paste called hells paste >:)
MR. BEAST AHHHHHHHH
I used my Make-a-wish to go to Hawaii...
Whahoooo mark rover uploaded I can’t wait to watch this
Looks like October sky
Great Video! Do you consider the environmental impact of what you're doing? Glorifying 12-minute flights as well as 26 million pieces of plastic probably isn't the best message!
The new chemical warfare weapon lol
Those drone shots are amaz 😩    Read more...
This is the most wholesome thing ive seen
Ahh mark you did it again that's what I like about you 😅
Cool, Bro 🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆
the dieprrd
Something we get into return? Yes. School gave us suffering.
Bro your so underrated
That was so big that it created a shadow now this is amazing.
Mark Rober.... you are pleasingly insane..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🍻🇳🇿
Someone has been taking debunking lessons from Captain Disillusion…
I love that he even fix a swimming pool watcher
Oh I had heard that the founder of Draft Kings was a super cool guy. I think a family friend know or has bumped into him on occasion. Lots of money super rad dude. Glad Mark and he connected on this. 🤘
10:05 whos making eggs??
When doctors tell you you're getting better but your favourite youtuber comes to see you. Sus. 😂
I wonder what happens to everything after the party is over
Imagine doing all this just for fun
Cool vid, but I can't wait until you make a catalytic converter trap for the thieves. :D
Hiiilloooo!
is it just me or did the elephant toothpaste actually SOUND like an elephant?
What a wonderful surprise though. Absolutely wonderful drone shots as well. I love it!
Try to make the mega flask go into space like revise engender it so the flask gose up into the air and the tooth past gose out the bottom of the flask so the flask gose up like a rocket
Now do one but instead use Coca Cola :)
You are awesome you should do it again but even bigger.
I wonder how are you guys gonna clean this up  RIP which ever insects in the site
gg
YOOOOOOOOOO THAT WAS CRAZY
You are an inspiration to the world Mark!
You need better build montage music
2:37 hey here a question how are you going to get out of ther tho?? And9:54 that looks like a pool of ded brains
Is this in gridley california?
I love how wholesome this is
top
this is one of the most wholesome best videos on the internet
Ngl. Kinda feel sorry for whoever has to clean that up
What are you using as the catalyst?  If it is KI then I hope you are dealing with the environmental risks.  All is fun and games until a population of fish suddenly dies.
He could do so many amazing things yet he chistes to make the most dumbest
Mr beast should of commented
Confia q o ibere vai fazer um maior...
Yoo he uploded:D
Whats the 30 second montages song?
Looks like that elephant toothpaste volcano can be used again and again, a yearly tourist event!
Someone tell me how to make devils toothpaste loll
all the elephant tooth paste was really cool but i was also really amazed by the camera work on the montages and the editing as well
10:03 that looked like larva
You said you were glad it didn’t take off like a rocket and that gets me wondering….. how high could you launch a rocket using elephant toothpaste as fuel?
This is the definition of quality content
You’re like bill nye for this generation
Now invert this and build an elephant toothpaste powered rocket
10:17 it was at this moment the camera knew, it fucked up
just imagine riding on an highway or something and seeing that
Gave those kids an adventure they’ll never forget. That’s so amazing. We need more of this
if this guy invites u to a party ur sure its gonna be lit
Wow
+1 youtuber point(from every viewer)
i wonder what would happen if there was a plug in the elephant toothpaste flask :)
Mark was always more excited than the kids
The macabre sudan ethically inform because samurai perinatally slap on a puny uzbekistan. tasteful, acoustic peanut
I can’t believe  I almost didn’t watch this video.
WOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINALYYY!11!1!! edit: WOWWW
12:51
kdo to bude uklizet jako :DD
The understood fire cranially carry because dredger holoprosencephaly snow but a measly hill. quixotic, concerned court
How much I wish mark was my uncle OMG this party looks insane
Well rip birds
The vulgar port topically touch because crime formally remain times a courageous refund. needless, puny spaghetti
12:45 ur welcome
Mark,  You are a saint.
you are to amizing
Mark Rober: What’s better than one giant elephant toothpaste volcano?  Also Mark Rober: TWO GIANT ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE VOLCANO!
I Amy’s or may not know what devils toothpaste is
imagine having life like mark......
ecological 🤦🏽‍♂️👎🏽
Bruh you look like rob pelinka
Imagine mark getting cancelled for saying child labour
i think i figured out how to make devils toothpaste, potassium permanganate insted of yeast, if so then i am sorry for saying this, i just thought it was smart, because it can decompose h2 o2 much faster than yeast. much much faster.
Mark Rober.... you and MrBeast are the friendliest and kindest people I ever saw on Youtube
What a waist
Ye aadmi 200 saalon se yehi kar raha hai
11:27 rip that one guy
mark rober is everyone's favorite uncle
I love how the kids paint the boxes😂
great thing here
Everyone needs a hobby  :-)
I have a deja vu of this happening before
Replicated a Pyroclastic flow. WTG!
Very nice, Mark.
1 and a half hour drive. And they flew a private jet. Lmfaoo wow
Can I be marks neighbor. Oh boy would that be fun.
How do you clean it up?
I did the cola version at school and I was scared

best video ive ever watched
OOOOOMMMMMMMMGGGG WHOS THE EDITOR......HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
coca cola espuma
U made his day :)
14:59 it looks like hes rapping with the music
So, who cleaned that mess up?
boring lurid noise
8:15 that was so cool what
west of mony where someone dying without food
Mark is goated
I've watched this video multiple times and it never fails to make me smile. : )
Mark Rober … what a guy 👏
THIS WAS BEYOND COOL! and Mark you are so kind!!!
Must have taken u day to clean all that 😱
everyone in the area.. "why do we keep letting Mark do this to our houses !?! "
shoutout to their parents who missed all of this
That was amazing!! 😵😵
That’s so heavy more than a tank
:)
Mark why aren’t you My uncle? Because I would love it if you my uncle😀
Mr beast is the money guy
Him : thank you so much! Mark : what can I sayyy except…you’re welcome
do it again with fuel injectors for a perfect fuel air mixture so theres none of that "its still going" at the end
No one else is allowed to take his record ever again!!!
My bro loves Science and planets
Incredible vid 👏🙌😍
Not enough diversity in these videos.  Don't you know any kids of color?
i wanna see them do the flask with devils toothpaste
fletchers sister can get it
hmm is the catalyst in the devils toothpaste potassium permanganate (and the other reactant is hydrogen peroxide)????
i think we all agree that we want to see that desine with a weak bottom and the top sealed off. so the whole thing shoots up
amazing
wow thats so cool wow
I can't really download the app cause i don't have enough space but I'll leave a like
do you now that ther was a posin in the alfint to pastat
Amazing how all this came together! Great work!
！んん？
Imagine you forgot to press the record button
What’s the song used during the building montage?
Mark you´re awesome!
woaa
imagine there was a bird flying by and it just gets blasted by the elephant toothpaste
Mark rober for president
You won't probably see this but I made a hole in my eraser with my friend and I managed to make a binoculars like you see through it and you get see it more clearer from a distance so a eraser can rub out pencil but it can be binoculars too i hope you see this comment :)
sheesh
How can I not cry watching your video, this is… beautiful. So beautiful.. 😭😭😭
Mr beast thought it was real
what if you added a mixing element at the base, paddles of some sort? or would smaller troughs increase the amount mixed thus increasing pressure and height.
Supreme content.
Is devil's toothpaste Colgate?
hahahahahahahahahahahaahahaaahaahahaahaahahaahahahahahahaahahaha
WOW That was Chemisty that was REALLY big!!!
You just made me cry 🥺
Foam daddy-
OMG that insane ._. And 15:26 Mr Beast?!
Mr beast commented on this video now it’s your turn to find it
if you watch the orbie pool in reverse it's a lovely video of a pool of orbies giving heads a body
Impressive drone shots 👍
These videos always make me smile! It's so nice to see people who've had pretty crappy decks delt to them get such an amazing opportunity and have such wholesome fun!
Epic.  Everyone involved did an amazing job here.  Thanks to everyone for making this video so fun to watch and give me back a little faith in humanity.  Mark, you are an inspiration, as are all those hard working people that did this behind the scenes.  I hope they had a great time, it sure looked fun!

He doesn’t give out the ingredients but Google does 😏
YAY. 😊
Yes.
Why can't be there more people like you?
Fletcher is basically marks second son
volcano more like AVO-CANO!
:,)
The blue devil paste didn't react? Why?
Mark always makes his videos better and better...  Respect
If Mark Rober was your Uncle you would have the time of your life!
This is epic!!
If anyone asked me to describe the video in one word It would be epic
12:50 👀
"When life gives you lemons... build a 5 ton flash and blast them to space."                 no no no when life gives you lemons... eat it.
This is epic especially since I actually live in gridley.
This explains our global warming.
on an irrelevant note: sometimes i wonder how it feels to be white. it is nice to see people have fun though
COMMENT
cool
💪👍
This made my day.😢❤️
So....does he not know who Mr Beast? Or am I missing something? Cuz he doesn’t seem too surprised....
The chunky ice mostly pick because platinum supposedly suggest including a wonderful tanker. six, amazing lightning
Imagine this but a tornado
Bro bro Dalvin Cook is the RB pick this year fight me on it
The aftermath shots are just as insane. You are seriously the nicest YouTuber alive
Flip the flask upside down and launch it into space along with a Beast Burger!!!!
Why thats crazy
MrBeast is a legend who gives away iPhone 12s and Millions of Dollars, but still rocks an iPhone 11!!!!
Mark is gonna have hundreds of stories to tell to his grandkids later on
Am I the only one worried for the manikens
Mark Rober and Mr Beast are the dream team
who the heck is Mr. Beast?
draft kings really cheapens the experience of this video. That being said, I absolutely adore Mark Rober's attitude.
You were on the news with this in Australia
Can u give me Jimmy’s number :3
You are the me beast of science
That was insane
Bro that was insane- like i got the chill.
Lol, mark reveals devils toothpaste recipe at 8:40  The secrets just getting the higher h2o2 concentration
This gives me faith in humanity again
I’ve been watching you since you did the Halloween hole in your chest nine years ago !
I got a question!! Like after Elephants Toothpaste goes off are you able to touch it?
Hey some Californians are friendly like me
When MrBeast hit 20 mil : Mark Rober help plant trees  When Mark Rober hit 20 mil : Jimmy we be waiting for u to help
🔥🔥🔥
me: *silence*  the drone at 13:01: zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom
*DO YOU EVER LOOK AT SOMEONE AND WONDER, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE HEAD?* :
How to pollute the universe step 1
“This is my kingdom come”
This is why you are the best!
Instead of bombs just launch that stuff, the other people won't  know what it is and start evacuating the area
He is the greatest guy there is.
He just don’t miss
This vid gives me despicable me 2 vibes lmao. The scientists, borthday party, inventions
Well if nothing else, the world is now a cleaner place, by your work. 😂🍻
Awesome! It’s so great to see people doing stuff like this for charitable reasons. Cool that you received all the help.   …and for the next volcano: create an iris on top to moderate the expulsion and keep the pressure up in the later stages of the reaction!  …
The people coming to help build everything sounds straight out of a show about friendship
9:55 it looks like lava spilling from a volcano
Your drone pilot should get a raise lol
Part of me thought “ nah I know I’m gonna see it at school” but this is awsome so I clicked on it
You are a beautiful human beeing Mark, keep going ! This has to be one of the best YT channel that exists
Oh, look. Mark Rober doing the same thing for the 3rd time.
That was AWSOME!
Fixx ini pasti rekor di dunia sih rekokr sih
Great video great cause 👍
The coolest dad of 2021 goes too...
Does Chris mosturize
You should team up with BSA for something!
12:58 that was me last night
I’m not positive but I’m gonna go on a whim and say this is “ the only elephant toothpaste volcano “ ever
This was crazy, keep it up Mark!
Build montages get everything done
my mind keeps going back to how hilarious the little yucca plant next to the house looks like when its covered in the devil's toothpaste
Very nice.
Thought I was watching a Lethamyr video during the orbeez scene
imaging 120 years later, Mom, why is this patch or grass a different shade if green? Son ,we wil never know…
He deserved it… 3 year In a hospital… then was given the wish of ANYTHING he wanted… and used it for someone else… THAT is respect a he 10000% deserves thos
Use the elephants toothpaste or of some sort to put out fires (just make another substance again)
does anyone else remember science bobs toothpaste record? that's long gone
50x the force of a Tom Brady football or a regular football :)
Lesson of the day : Don't mess with Mark Rober , He beat the elephant toothpaste
yall remember that blob thing from guardians of the galaxy 2? totally made by mark
Wow
Now you should do “sending box and ballon to edge of space then releasing devils toothpaste”
The orange Devils paste looks like lava, and Marks devuls toothpaste creations sounds like the start to a batman vullain
+1 Uncle Points, vevry nice
Is it just me or is the music lethamyr's intro sound
Now you need to build the same thing except with devils toothpaste😀😁😆
Mark Rober is science mr beast tell me I’m wrong
This vid was amazing mark u r the best YouTuber   Also plz bring back the squirrel maze
Mark I love this vid you are amazing keep posting vids! I am also a really big fan so everyone have a great day!!👍😄

What’s the sisters @?
Can’t believe what’s people do for go viral
I don't know why Mark won't tell us the formula for devil's toothpaste when it's pretty clearly using fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer.
Let’s go we got a new world record
Violent nickelodeon slime cannon
HE FINALLY DID IT :D
Mark are you currently taking nephew applications?
Your best yet Mark! Amazing
Thanks Mark. We need your videos in 4K!
it looks like he has a real life replay mod
Absolutely insane. I LOVE IT 💕🔥
this was awesome and  i smiled through the whole thing
bro could i have the playlist of your songs, i recognizes one you used in this video from another youtuber's intro and i really like the music you use. They're great for vibing to.
10k no-life haters!! Must suck to be you!😂
I wish I was white
you should have a record for the most verified people in your comment section
NOTHING BUT LOVE!
Cool, now do it w devil's toothpaste
He's the mr beast of science
makes a video planting 1000000 trees and in this video he flies fors private just to not drive 1:30 min
Am I the only one who was worried for the people standing at the bottom of the flask before I realised they were mannequins 😂
what did you do with the other one
Is this ecofriendly? Just wondering
This is ridiculously wholesome
Mr  beast has to react to this and update his record
Ok MrBeast, now you have to try to compete this lol
Bruhhh ur crrracked
Can you do this in my school?
Where do you get a 5 ton flask
Mark rover is a mad scientist, but the mad scientist the world needed
Dude he sounds SO MUCH LIKE MR.BEAST 😨

Banana
Brody is a cubs fan so he's cool with me

Child laber ma fav
I swear to you… everything I’ve seen today was sponsored by draft kings.
These drone shots.. unreal. Do they have 360 cameras on them?
10:22 did anyone notice the spikes??????????????
Foam daddy
I live in yuba city, 25 mins from gridley… I really wish I knew this was happening so I could meet you!!! 😭😭😭😭

It’s amazing how business savvy this guy is. He knows his target audience is kids, so he puts kids in the video. Genius. Not my type of channel, but I can respect the professionalism
The joker coom
Me: *clicks on it thinking yeah I’ll just fast forward through this one* Me: *watches the entire thing*
Can you make a video of cool stuff to do/make when you're bored?
This is all terrible for the environment
Why are there always so many kids in his videos
Fletcher’s sisters bad
I feel like some of the montages go on for way too long
that is crazy
ma quanto cazzo vi divertite beati voi
This channel never disappoints.  Educational, inspiring, heart warming, and fun.  What more can you ask for?
hi
😱
Stuff like this restores a little of my dwindling faith in humanity.
Me about the go to the doctor: “Maybe Mark Rober will show up and…”
Everyone: banana for scale mark : house for scale
How much money did you spend on manikins this video lol
Such a great video of achieving your goals and pure love. Thanks for spreading stuff like this into the internet!
this is one of the most exiting things that happend in 2021
Im always sad when i see something like this and think about the Kids or People who dont had the luck to get such a Party but had to go trough all the pain
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen! But I’m sorry to tell you mark. We need to see even bigger :))
Dad said dream big and he is living large
If I am ever wealthy and successful, I want to use it like this to make other people happy.
Mark Rober might be one of the greatest humans of all time. I wish more people were like you. Kudos.
Mark Rober, you've done it.
I need to know where he gets his music, I can’t find it in any of his descriptions
The Hulk when she says “not yet”
broke your own record mark! excellent work!!
I stayed to watch your sponsor for you
I love what you do for these kids!
I wonder what would happen if you completely welded the thing a shut and then set it off
Tom Brady can use that psi against a football technology. Lol
Mark, i just want to say , you are an amazing person , adn thanks to you i can somehow enjoy science and physics a bit more
Loved your last line.  If more people lived this way, we'd have a much better world.
GREETINGS TO ALL GAMER'S AND ASPIRING YOUTUBERS OUT THERE, WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SOON IN  GOD'S PERFECT TIMING 👇
it saddens me too see this me on my computer and kids living thier life
Who else wants MatPat to find the formula for Mark Robers Devils toothpaste only to have it bleeped out
Awesome
Gets off private jet... "I KNEW IT WAS A LIMO!"
This is some new level of wholesomeness. Thanks Mark!
you are the best better then me :(
9:55 me after eating Taco Bell…
?
.
You are an amazing guy
Loved the video .
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying...
Wow
When you build a nuke shelter to use it for elephants toothpaste to launch some half into the stratosphere.
Americans will use anything to measure something😂 "about 50 times the force you feel when you press against a fully inflated football"😂
F manual do mundo
For what u do may the Lord bless u and your definitely going to heaven
Mark Rober, easily the best YouTube content creator on the platform. For so long now too
Keep going
This should be called “God’s Toothpaste”
What a great project!
1:56 I even harnessed Child labor
Your sir, are simply amazing
so positive - thank you for caring
@Mark Rober Can you make a safer version of the devil’s toothpaste please and make a video on it
I’m waiting for him to force it down the bottom and not the top so it could be a rocket...
Epic!
This is an awesome video
I might know, why in the video where you tested if sharks could smell blood, you came to the conclusion that they can’t. This happened when I watched the video „Can you actually smell metal“ by NileRed. What we associate with the smell of metal happens to be something that is created when our natural skin oils and the metal combine called „1-octen-3-one“. The evolutionary reason for this might be so that we can smell blood when dropped on skin, as there’s iron in it. You might have to go for another dive with sharks, but without a neoprene suit and additionally a big tank of blood. Or you just try to get this odor into the water.  Love your content, would love to see a sequel to the sharks video.
Mark Rober has a problem with making elephant toothpaste
Is devils toothpaste safe for a school environment
Perfect example of "money CAN buy happiness" 😆
The song sounds like colt 45.
Ecology is dead 😭😂
11:20 any rocket league players?😏
Amazing video!  I wish I could help with one of his projects somehow.  Mark seems like a super cool guy!
Why aren't humans as kind as Mark?
I have figured out the devilstooth paste recipe I did it in my back garden
This is proper content
Huge props brother!
You smart!
Please let us know what the recipe for devil's toothpaste is
what if you made the opening much smaller?
People's houses near the volcano be like:  Mom; honey, what is that green stuff out out window? Me; prob mark rober doing it Dad; ohh mark rober, that youtuber
@Mark Rober do you think we can try this for my birthday, its October 2nd
Imagine if some random guy just looks out the windue and see this LOL
He just told us the devils toothpaste increadients 😂
Amazing
12:15, I finally understand why they call it elephant Toothpaste.
The elastic dryer anteriorly fade because noodle impressively program pro a direful scale. decorous, swift mitten
What happens. If you touch the elephant
Next year... turn the flask upside down?
I like Mark uses this kids birthday as a scapegoat for a Guinness WorldRecord but like in a wholesome way
your vidoe's are the best and i watch your vidoes all the time so give me a like and a comment
Wait, fletchers party was last year.....
6:30
Can you do a collab with Michel reeves
10:30 only place i spotted racin drone visible. Why? We need more pilots, let ppl know what gear was used to make best shots :D
I understand why you and mr beast are friends
if you want to make party call Mark Rober
How long does it take for him to clean them stuff up
That was awesome Mark, keep doing what you do!!!!!!
How did you get rid of the orbees afterwards?
Next up, the same but in space
Will you please run for PoTUS? Maybe with The Rock as VP.
12:40 You’re Welcome
you are famous now in guiness record book for top elephant toothpaste.....
such an awesome video!
So what do you do with all those orbeez when done playing around in them?
7:19 the drone shots was fire
Imagine doing this for a Gender Reveal for your baby mama .
Boy with too much money and no brains
Ayo the song from Lethamyr’s intro!
You've made the tool - Use It!
Love it. Wanna see more of it.
Lethamyr.
Wow that is cool I love your videos
4:12 and my parents taught me that chemistry doesn't explode often...
i really loved this video, but driving with 4 kids while holding a phone is pretty unresponsible
I am completely believing that Mark has a cannon full of devils toothpaste so if anyone breaks in they gon burn and they can't see.
You cleaned up after yourself I hope?
Mark rober is the mr. beast of the science world (I’m being attacked by comment bots help)
You truly are a great human.  The world needs more like you.  Thanks for what you do.

Wow and I thought my 13 birthday was cool All I did was run around a tree at 10  pm with my freinds while screaming under nonsense and probably waking the newborn up
Very white at that pool party
@lethamyr

Someone keep track of the uncle points 😂
12:46

I WISH I WAS THERE😭 YAL ARE SO LUCKY
We must protect Mark at all costs
💉
Inspirationally kind.  Thanks for doing that for someone I don't even know.
I’m never TPing a building again with THIS as an option.
Soooo cool but let's not talk about cleaning all that up
I could not care less about the people aspect of the video. Stil appreciate you doing this, though! Extremely interesting stuff :)
blows my mind to see my high school town of gridley being so awesome
This is ganna be a meme if it’s not already
Absolutely spectacular! That said, I don't know if it was just the first time I'd seen this done IRL, but I can only imagine how acrid the smell in the air must be
this is MAD
imagine ur just outside ur house and seeing a green thing in the sky.
I am now convinced mark rober is a child in a scientists body
You said thank you for the elephant toothpaste container not taking off like a rocket but what if you purposely made it become a rocket. You should make an elephant toothpaste rocket.
an absolute mad lad
Best ever you and Mr B has to have a tournament and see who the best giver awayer is love to see that
when she touches your thigh
Now make a rocket with elephanth toothpaste
What if you made the top part much smaller?
Hi random kid I will never met
🌋
Who are all those children
Mark is such an inspiration
JESU!!!!!
That's some serious driving pressure. The drone couldn't even ascend fast enough. You're hired for my next birthday.
Go mark dude
How do you dispose of a pool of Orbees?
Pure technical project would be way better. With devil's toothpaste recipe of course :)
This couldn't BE more American even if you tried...
You are such an amazing guy. Respect!
He may make a video once a month but let’s just appreciate how long he takes to make the.
do this for me
12:48 thank me later
Can I actually brush my teeth with it
Mark just gets better and better the stuff this guys does for people is fantastic.   He really goes out of his way to do it!!!
This is like Deja Vu for me- I love this
I love this-
Amazing 🤩🤩
Love the glamour bot shots lol
i’m wishing you so much happiness, you rock ❤️
Mark really should work in hollywood
Thats gotta be bad for the environment. Destroy the world for a kids party, I don’t think its worth it.
what a amazing and generous human, already going through that yourself but choosing to use your wish for someone else is so kind <3 I think most of us would have taken the wish thinking it would be nice to have a bit of a break from the reality.
mr beast makes everything better
What goes around, comes around. You are awesome, Mark!
I once lent a friend a 10mm socket. Still not got it back.
Is it em but his teching is just amzing
mark you make me realise im a piece of shxt
10k people don't like joy and didn't have a fun childhood 😅
+1 uncle points lol
Isn’t that Elephant Toothpaste stuff incredibly toxic? I hope they cleaned it up and disposed of it safely.
Its gonna be a volcano lol
Finnaly you took back your world record
12:40 the thing you actually clicked for.
Hi ✨mark✨
I think it is fun to have parents with money..
Mark needs some mr beast points for this
by "fully inflated football", did that mean properly inflated, or just shy of bursting?
This is insane!
Anyone notice Brody was wearing socks while on a board on the water at 1:01
Who edits your vids cuz there the beast at editing
i love these videos pretty cool
the last time i watched you , you had 10 million wow what a grow in 3 months it eent as high at the elephant tooth paste!
Genuine question : How do you clean all this, and is it bad for the environment ? Because it hurts me to see all this "toothpaste" on the ground like that
innocent question , lol why is it that all the kids are white coulda added few shades
Imagine how much cooler it would have looked with blue and purple in the boxes 😭  Lol j/k awesome dude well done
What kind of person would ever say no to volunteer for Mark freakin Rober
Youtube... Solving none life's real problems, millions of views at a time.
Youre such a great person Mark.. Was incredible to see how the town wanted to help.. Just shows that theres still love for each other out there.. Well done all around!

Hey Mark I once gave away one of my pens in school, jsut thought I would let you know :)
People from a quarter mile away just see a big green geyser go up. Lol
Bro pls we need the song u use for ur vids
You should make one that purposely goes out the bottom and you cover the top to make a rocket.
Hi, I need your help. I have a project where I have to make a bridge that resists a child weight like 100-20 pounds. But I can only use paper, scissors and tape and maybe a stapler
I know you’re drone pilot I have met him in real life a couple of times
Next, make something that is specifically designed to launch like a rocket using elephant's toothpaste. Love the things you do😁❤️
＊ Woohooooo!!!!!!  NEW RECORD BABYYYY!!!!!
Sooooo cool
Mark Rober is a badass.
Can you start doing cool things with different races?
Comment for the algorithm

I love when someone help someones it needs, mark, your the best^^
RIP house

"what are you gonna do when you grow up?", the teacher asked the kid with the volcano project.

Leth
Looks like you are making your own space program... launching elephant toothpaste into LEO ;)
Amazing video!!!  Btw, did I hear Lethamyr's intro song in the video?
12:52.   Thank me later
Next time use 70% h2o2 and dichromate
why do you drive in Tesla when you have to know that electric cars are not environmentally friendly
The one with red looks like a lava
i love this channel
Cool. But, can you help clean up the oceans?
BatChest NO FORMULA!!! BatChest YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND THE REDDIT THREAD FROM THE TOP GOOGLE RESULT YOURSELF!!!
I didnt stop smiling the whole time watching this video, this is so wholesome
This is what happens when we go to the toilet after eating taco bell
Loved loved loved loved this
Mark has a golden heart
I think it's impossible not to smile while watching this
Do more squirles maze
You're insane. I love it!
Love how mark is the happiest of everybody
Imagine being a scientist, and just do this for fun the rest of your life
It is all fun and games, until the hedonistic character of the human species destroys the planet it lives on.
Mark Rober : let me take you c h I l d to ride in a private jet
Why not use a rocket nozzle design with a flask, choke, and cone? Could you get bigger height?
Wait so the flask at the end was elephant tooth paste What if it was devil toothpaste.....?
13:44 You couldn't have made this information harder to understand.
What school thinks boys will do when they see a girls shoulder: 13:12
Who even think that we're gonna see Mr Beast in this video😜
Cool all i can say
"Generous benefactor" yea code word for Mr.Beast
What if there was a way to make angels toothpaste?   (like elephants toothpaste but it’s cold enough for you to touch it)
Massive
Great done Mark!
Any one notic that almost his 10 percent of comment box is filled with Youtuber
Nice
I’m so shocked
This is so wholesome
Wow
Worthy cause? How does this help anyone except the channel?
I like mr beast but he thinks the world is flat but i live your Videos
Omw that editing is so great for the pool party
Nice for Tha vdeo
Looks like somone had a big diahhreah
….. and again, I’m not sure whats more amazing to me, the stuff you do, which is well and truly amazing and awesome… or the numbers your videos generate, I mean 13 mill views in three days….. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Deja Vu.
Mrbeast: hold my money
Very nice and moving video
Do you use any cad softwares
WOW WOOOOOOW
Cool, destroy the planet !
One of the best YouTuber’s EVER!
The world needs more people like Mark
Now the america got a green volcano😁
when you realise your life won't ever be like this
We all love Fletcher
Lucky
Some bird was flying around like: HEY, HEY I am a bird woo-BAM
Oh dear
i’m experiencing some deja vu, didn’t he do something similar?
This is of course fantastic and incredibly wholesome. Nice work! However, I must say that I’m a bit concerned seeing a party with this many people during a pandemic. It’s outdoors and most of the people are hopefully vaccinated, which counts for something, but I’m a bit surprised that this aspect isn’t discussed in the video nor in the comment section from what I can tell.
Love the lethamyr music
Watching those kids using the slide into the pool gave me so high of anxiety... Then that one kid body flopping over the edge, like jeez....
how far up did it go
Ima be honest i would of asked for a impala insted of a tesla
This is so wholesome I love it.
For those wondering, "50 times the force when pushing against a football" is about 0,9 bar (13 psi) per ball, so in total, roughly 45 bars, or 650 psi. That's equivalent to diving to about 450 meters (1 480 feet) deep in to water.
Always exciting to see a Rober Post! This one was EPIC
What, why did I not hear about this before hand. Gridley is only a few towns over from me. Would have been so cool to watch in person
mark.i beg squirrel 3.0 next year
how did you clean it up
ah yes, the perfectionist :D
Recipe for devils toothpaste  50%hydrogen peroxide and potassium permaginate
The thundering temple predictably telephone because brother-in-law acceptably employ lest a naughty piano. likeable, obsolete router
Why the devil’s toothpaste look like omelette
This is now my favorite video of all time
i kinda want to know how many times the kids watched the video
I’m just gonna say, that clean up must have been- oof
That was epic
NICEEE :D
This is insane
10:00  ok is this of a volcano eruption I mean seriously look closely doest kinda look like the inside of a volcano eruption
I love Mark's videos every since the roadkill test but, he has a tesla and talks about saveing the inviroment but gets in a jet which put   lots of emissions
U know this is a slime grenade in the making
I wonder if making the top aperture smaller would make it go even higher?
Ok
12 mio views with ANOTHER elephant toothpaste video. srsly youtube. get our algorithm straight.... or is this really what people want to see? this is just.... crazy un-inspiring
there’s so much verified people in this comment section 👁👄👁
Mark is the Dad every kid would love, great job on making not only a great video but on making so many kids smile over and over
Me Next pleaseee
🤯🤯🤯
"Ok, I'm shocked."
Isn’t it basically ivory in a microwave???
12:50 to get to the point
13:00 I love the sound of those drones trying to keep up lol
Chernobyl reactor 4 be like:
I can literally make newspaper headlines out of some of the comments in this video and it is awesome.
Me when I see my crush' naked shoulder
Классно, ребята, так держать! 😂👍
Signal green SNK
potassium permangernate
What if you try to let the devils tooth paste fly up like rocket on purpose, almost like a rocket then but without rocket fuel. Just with devils toothpaste
7:55 I thought Mark was holding a cucumber
I wish i was there
The seagull at 13:20 be like... DAFUK?
Ngl David dobrik and mark look alike
let's be honest we all new he was gunna try this again
I'm a little concerned for the environment.
I want mark to make video about levers or types of levers. Idk where I got the idea but I’ve always wanted to learn more about that topic
13:11 when you see a girl
+1 uncle points, lol
He screamed like a goat here 4:19 srry no offense Mark Rober it was just funny

12:58 while its called elephant's toothpaste i don't know why its called that only mark rober knows  it also sounds like an elephent sound 13:02
The kids doing a communist revolution. Salute for our fellow comrades.
I just wouldn’t want to be the guy cleaning everything up.
Exactly how much money did they use
Sometimes I feel like Mark Rober is doing this to make viewers jealous. Science is just an excuse. Haha! Awesome video!🔥
So big of a carbon footprint just to make one kid happy wow
After watching this video, all I can say is "Americans".
You're awsome human being and an all around cool guy! Thanks for making these kids feel that selflessness... It goes a long way 🙏💙
But is it Toothpaste
Why always white kids
WHOH
Elephany toothpaste sure does sound like an elephant
You could go even higher by using vortex method
Mark's here being the next generation's cool uncle.
4:19 manly screams
Amazing so amazing x Mark is just awesome x x
4:19 The sudden "WAH" Scream had me laughing my butt off
A video full of role-models, yourself included! This is what parties should be like >:D. Never stop doing crazy stuff! I just wish there were more videos more often haha. I could binge a show made of your content forever lol.
thank you!!!!
Collab with slo mo guys with this elephant toothpaste 😂
1:57 don’t you just love child labor
15:48 lmao why does mark sound kinda like grunkle Stan from gravity falls 😂
Whether it’s Mark or whoever, shout out to the editor with these fire edits
I hope he gets better
Orbeez just automatically make me think of mrbeast at this point.. was not disappointed
Love ur vids
"generous benefactor" Mr. Beast?
so much work in a 20 second build montage 🖤 that's Mark Rober for you
Mark is like a little kid that knows too mich
Mark Rober should make an amusement park no cap
I know mrbeast his a YouTuber
13:30 me when I go to the toilet.
It’s was on THE NEWS!!! MARK
This kid will remember this day for the rest of their life. Well done with finally beating the engineering challenge of elephant toothpaste.  I love how wholesome this was. A nice change from the doom and gloom.
u always make me smile while watching!
these children vs me (studying 12 hours to clear an engineering exam) :)
You should be on talk shows
It is  so cool  but is it okay if you touch the mixture
dam, days of work for 20 sec montage
Loved this
Y’all have some CRAZY FAST drones.
This is a whole new level of wholesome
This video is awesome
u dont need a 5 ton structure as weight, but piling or soil anchors into the ground....basics
13:31 is just a normal night eating taco bell
green lantern is born!
If you're wondering when they actually show it it's 12:46
The difference in height was insane😮‍💨
This is so wholesome, Mark. You made a day to be remembered for the rest of Brody's life. Bless you 🙏
Next year mark rober will make rocket to fly to the moon with devil's toothpaste
I can see it now “ Mark Rober kidnapped for Devils toothpaste formula “
The most wholesome video ever ive ever seen. Thanks Mark
i thought of mreast in the video when it touched the sky and in the end , he came........
"i followed you when i was like 6"  YES A GEN ALPHA THAT DIDNT WATCHED NURSERY VIDEOS
This is the type of entertainment I like
hmm , yes .. classic .
Mr beast will 100 percent watch this.
Is that foam biodegradable?
do technoblade next
MEN U GREAT
How much pollution do you want?  Him: yes
Little boy strikes again
Yow he's trying hard to be num 1 in world record highest elephant toothpaste
Everyone is having fun  Everything is going perfect  YouTube algorithm: and I took that personally
Sheeeeeeeesh🥶🥶🥶
I have an idea, make a soda that makes you have a big burp guaranteed and give it to mr beast not telling him what it actually is.
Great content
how can you not like a video like this
Mark rober you are a legend
Make a glow in the dark devils toothpaste
10:21 that's an awesome shot
Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds .I’m ѕυвѕ¢яιвιηg тσ єνєяуσηє ωнσ ѕυвѕ¢яιвєѕ тσ мє αη∂ ℓιкєѕ тнιѕ ¢σммєηт
My real question is? Can you make a actual rocket with elephants toothpaste as a form of fuel? And if so. Is it possible to use devil's toothpaste for the same thing
See this is what we should be teaching kids today. I hope tons of people see this
Coolest uncle anyone could ever have...
Did i hear craft music??
5 times the previous record.... ok.
Amazing to see that kindness of heart prevailed on that day. Thank you for making it all possible Mr. Rober!
7:21 Cue the music that will stay stuck in my head for 10+ days!!
I felt like if Mark was in charge the movie twister would have been better.
That’s the ATV model I wanted it’s a Yamaha YFZ 450
When you use science not for science purpose
3rd on trending and +1 uncle Point in 10 seconds that is insane!!!
give me the formula
[mark] money what money
THese suck...
He deserves the world record for the best party
Can I get the same party for my birthday 🤣🤣🤣
So this is how a scientist would probably start an astonishing party
Why will you take one year to make just one video
Mark Rober is absolutely incredible.
Speaking of rockets how far/high do you think an elephant toothpaste powered rocket can fly?
Thats awsome 😍😍
what if it was devils toothpast
Me when I eat Taco Bell: 13:01
So thats that green thing i saw
this video restored my faith in at least some of humanity. for that I thank you
who will clean?
All I could think of was the lethamyr intro song
there is gonna be something cryptic with the mannequins
Wait no way I have that exact slide at my house 7:27
Tbh I wouldn’t be surprised if this guy makes the DeLorean from BTTF and it actually travels in time
Hey mark try building a devils toothpaste rocket
Thanks Mark for all that you do.  AWESOME!
it actually made an elephant noise when it came out the flask!! that’s crazy
Waow.👏👏
Imagine being Mark Rober and doing all these crazy things lol
This is amazing, what you did for this kid is amazing ❤✊🏼 love your videos
I wonder how much money your YouTube channel makes that you can afford to do these elaborate stunts
I wish he was my uncle XD
I really wish i was there.
You really do love milking the elephant tooth paste experiments
The lethamyr intro music tho
12:44 enchante? we speaking french
Almost to 20mil!
Me thinking as hard as I can what if you put the top at an angle so it wouldn’t fall on its self and it can get higher would that work ?
if i had any ounce of fame i'd give it to this guy
this was awesome !!
7:37 that was really smooth!
mark build a drone size of a 10 ton falsk
He's slowly becoming mr beast v1. 0
:)
Now clean it up~
I can’t imagine the cleanup
Legendary guy
2:33 build montage song?
Video editing on party scenes is amazing!
What if u did it in mid air
thoughts about the kilos of soap went into the ground just to make a bit of foam? americans
Alvin Kamara! The best RB in the NFL
The guy is galaxy brain
Respect to the guy filming in creative mode
I KNEW you could do it!!! Bravo to you for your heartwarming generosity to young Brody!
congtrats mark u will soon hit 20 mil
13:01 that actually sounded like an elephant
no one can defeat you guys remember me no one can defeat that world record😳🗿
8:15 that was actually cool
Wow, I can't believe you did just what I suggested...  "Crusader1815 11 months ago Next time try welding some heavy gauge steel together for your flask so it doesn't break."
mark rober is type of people we all wish to lead the world for better days
I admire you, you are amazing. Thank you for everything you and these amazing videos. Those kids appreciate what you do!
Why is everyone in every Mark Rober video white?
No one: The orbeez pool song is the lethamyr intro song
Devil toothpaste is acid and. Not telling lmao
great party and surprise for an amazing kid!
I love your videos  you are amazing  keep it up
The fact fletcher returned is very and i mean VERY wholesomely poggers
I want an uncel like Mark Rober. If not I will be a Uncel like Mark Rober :p :D
Genuinely concerned about how this gets cleaned up
Mark Rober.. You won the science itself
I have a feeling jimmy helped with the private jet
I think someone already cracked the devils youth paste ingredients
I thought he repost the last vid
Won't the people who are under the volcano get burnt
Did your editor layer elephant sounds on the vid when it erupted at 13:02? Lol would be an odd coincidence but I definitely hear elephants trumpeting!
Next time you do this maybe you could place something on top to see how much it gets launched in the air!
12:47
Spectacular!
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
You could make 3 Videos out of this ^^
pollusion
Noice
The volcano is at 9:30 and 12:50
What’s fletchers sister’s Ig?
Did devils toothpaste really just cause a chemical fire upon being poured? Did you create Greek fire?
Imagine being someone seeing that far away and not knowing what’s happening
He only has 103 vids
MARK IS BACK
Mark when someone asks why he built the world's largest devil's toothpaste and the world's tallest elephant toothpaste: it's for the kids ;)
This guy is like the scienec mr beast
This video makes me so happy, thank you for being an amazing human who is able to connect to other amazing humans. And thank you for showing us these amazing humans
Pressure experienced can be not only measured but calculated. You could have optimized the height by improving the nozzle design. Subsonic flow has been thoroughly studied and there is a lot of information available regarding nozzle design.
They should of used red food colouring so that it would look like a volcanic.
So cool to see the torch passed from one survivor to the next! Hi Fletcher!
Incredible
It definitely sounded like an elephant~~~
At least everyone looks happy
13:01  You’re welcome.
My brother birthday is next week Friday
PLEASE tell me how orbees are recycled
The dizzy crab contrarily exist because brick presumably pretend atop a demonic appendix. difficult, ten eyebrow
the way mark screams 4:13
The people in these town are amazing!
mY FrIeNd MrBeAsT
I absolutely love what what you're doing for everyone in this video...but can't help noticing everyone is a white male... where's the support in women in stem?!!! We're here too!!! We're interested in science too!!!  When can we not be supporting characters?!
I love your vids

The lethamyr intro music got me😂
I think we can all agree you are the most amazing and wholesome youtuber ever
12:46
Imagine MrBeast at your party…
Lol
The secret is not the Catalyst it’s the hydrogen peroxide he used a higher concentration he used 59% hydrogen peroxide instead of 10-10 percent
Woah, that last quote you said Mark makes me say WOW!
Easily within top 5 youtubers ever.
¡
Bruh how much money do u have to have
This is happiness, I envy everyone getting to watch it for the first time
Cool drone shot

"Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid" ~C.M. Burns
I’m white and this was too white for me to finish watching.
Mark Rober is one of those who always outdoes himself. It’s incredibly unique and awesome to see
You should build a robot dog
Could you put a fridge or something on top and see how high it goes
i love how these guys actually break records rather then clickbaiting
Mark is a national treasure and you can’t change my mind
Dang dude what a video👍🤣😯
mark rober yes
Rest in peace🪦 Mark Rober 😭😭
I live in gridly
Can someone explain to me in short if this will not cause a damage to the environment. And howbto clean it. It looks dirty despite the fun.
HOW DOES THE GLOVE CATCH ON FIRE!!
12:51 when boys see 1mm of girls shoulders according to school :
When life gives you onions, DO NOT cut them in front of me.  Aw, crap, too late, but not to worry, I am crying happy tears inside!
aqui é manual do mundo!
Mark, your videos not only intrigue me with the math and science and pure scale of things, but the fact that you go through all this effort and do so many nice things for people is like icing on the cake. Please don't ever stop being yourself and continue doing what you love because we love it too.
Notice how they are all white.

keep in mind that they basically created a foam explosive.
now imagine putting a small town near the eruption site
if only the elephant toothpaste was white...
Was that.... Was that a country instrumental of afro-mans colt 45?
Trashy
I feel like Fletcher liked it more than Brody did🤣
Nurk fpv is the drone driver? Jeez thats why the drone shots were so heat
You are a light in the world, Mark.

Brody is an amazing kid, he used his wish to hep another kid instead of doing something he would have wanted
Great work as always
Anyone get confused hearing Lethamyr's intro? xD
What if you made a mini rocket powered by elephant toothpaste?
I love all of the things that you do especially for those in need.  Would love to connect to see how you might be willing to partner with the company that i work for!!
Thanks for keeping YouTube awesome! I always love watching your videos. It always ends with me smiling and being happy I watched it.
This was on the news!!!!!!!
you guys are so cool
splatoon 2 octo expansion ptsd

The video quality of your videos increase every time.
Well then 😗
Nice one, gonna try this at home
11:26 it’s all orbies? Not orbies then water dang
I wanna be smart now…..
I love how he just casually gave us the recipe for devil's toothpaste
10:00 this is gonna be on daily dose of internet
Mark absolutely ripped Jameis Winston at the end lmao
8:30 this seems like a bad idea especially since it’s that close to that building
STUNNING overhead shot on the orange devil's toothpaste. WOW!
MURICAAA !!!
"It turns out the force pushing all of the elephant toothpaste out the top is about ×50 the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football"  ah yes, i see you use American measuring techniques as well
Hhhh
Thats cool
This makes me so happy. So many great people you are all amazing!
W
Elon offered Mark a million dollars a day to work at SpaceX, but Mark told him, I have better ways to spend my time.. The best You-tuber ever..Thank you Mark...
You are a genius!! Thank you for sharing that with all of us - it makes us smarter and better people!!

He could very easily kidnap children this way
Now cap the hole to a smaller diameter.
thank you

The kid knew it was a limbo
Mark is a science mr beast
HOW ARE YOU 41 YOU LOOK 26

The kid gets his four wheeler stolen mr beast: here’s 20 more
This kid had the best two bdays ever
The time and effort that goes into these videos is incredible
Epic collab
Oh

0:58 here comes the tragic backstory.......
So amazing

This is so wholesome it hurts 😬

Me Watching this Casually and knowing that I'll never have this fun in my entire life
Watch they won't put this on rewind
Kid in the bass pro shop hat was mad  rushing on fletcher sister 🤣😂
glad that brody is a okay
White people be crazy
The elephant vs devil's toothpaste demo at 4:20 was wild 😳
Cool
Mans did all this for a youtube vid
So many kids will use this as their wall paper
You’re amazing for that
This is basically a modern “Nickelodeon visits your school” raffle. Coolest birthday ever
............wow
12:50 you’re welcome
Ye so secret formula is calcium permanganate
Mark should work with hacksmith one day
11:27 when the Orbee monster grabs your leg
The clumsy property remarkably decorate because composer mostly chew for a enormous unit. clammy, lacking occupation
These gender reveals are getting out of control.... Congratulations, you're having a frog !
Lol
When you eat Taco Bell 13:13
Is the elephant toothpaste?
2:34 J'me promène dans mon avion, parce que c'est super cooooool
It's awesome to see so many people coming together for something like this. Those kids will be telling their grandchildren about this one day, probably multiple times, until the kids refuse to listen to it again. To think this all started with a random act of kindness restores my faith in humanity. Job well done Mr. Robert.
Is this a great country, or what? 🇺🇸
I want to do that but i cant
Great work Mark! Now every time Brody will have a doctors appointment he’ll wonder if you’ll be there with another surprise 🤣
Kindness never returns void!  ⭐🙂👍
I love how not click-bated his videos are
YOU WERE ON INSIDE EDITION
Just Saw This On The News
Americans: our way of measuring is the best Americans: 13:43
how do u clean this
The party looks cool, but why can i only see "white people".
This is LITERALLY the most amazing this ive ever seen! Keep up the great work!
Every shot is gold.
Cool
Super awesome
Finally!!! Glad you didn’t hit the drone pilot because his shots were epic! As was the science! 😁
13:20 is what you are here for
@Mark Rober I have to have a birthday party with you
Just imagine what the people the next town over saw
The fact you put the drone that far back, and it still went out of frame
11:29 it’s prob known as other things but...    LETHAMYRS INTRO POGGERS
I like that he showed mr beast
It’s almost not fair how satisfying the slo-mo in this is.
It was only a matter of time and a lot of engineering before that flask met its match. Nice one.
Spoiler - devil's toothpaste is just high test (80%+) peroxide
This boy be launching foam to space or mars
did you pollute the soil
Me after Taco Bell
12:50   You welcome
The sister is so pretty 😍
Your reason for picking Kamara is spot on. Lmao
Ur the best keep it going :)
I literally saw this on the news!
The miniature can developmentally blind because smoke methodologically stay following a labored link. seemly, decorous woolen
Congrats on #2 on trending!
Woah
The camera work in this video is phenomenal!! There are some epic shots!
You are one of the best youtubers and deserve all the subscribers
Yessss Mark we missed you 💯 I love your content
👏👏👏👏well done Mark, brody and all the crew.it's an exceptional video.
Next video: cleaning up the huge mess
I wanna see you drive the Tesla through that pile in front of the house
Me when your mom...when i'm with your mom and she....when.....i'm there with.....when i see your mom
Mark: "Is that better than going to the doctor's office?"  Absolutely, this is therapeutic.
Imagine being able to have a single wish for ANYTHING ( anything possible ) and used it for someone else. He deserved every second of that enjoyment.
no, things don't come back imediately, sometimes never
This is the best mark Robert video ever
Do u have a model y
This is so wholesome in so many ways
Those drone shots are INSANE.
13:47 Americans be like
@12:50
Mark Rober’s parties are probably the best parties, not to mention the world record that comes with them lmao. Awesome milestone and amazing video :D
Put things in it next time before you launch it to see how high they go.
i got to brodys school
LeThAmYr InTrO SoNg!!!
It’s not a volcano it’s bigger then a volcano literally
Yo mark love your videos my friend
Do more
Hellaaa overkill lol
Amazing production value
It’s official, nerds throw the best parties 🤣
Ok ok ok, this video is the "straw that broke the camel's back"... I gotta look for any positions to work on Mark's team. I'll do the shopping runs, I don't care. I just want to be a part of this
F manual do mundo
So what force is that in tons
A year spent designing it? 30 seconds a day?
I love it
Devils toothpaste is a great weapon
I bet that you have the same IQ as Albert Einstein himself.
i wish i had this for my birthday, because mine is on september 18th. :'(
mark should just make an amusement park park at this point
New music I see
Leave it to the NASA scientist to not actually TEST anything during the last YEAR of development.
I love your videos SOOOOO much
Mark is that cool nerd that loves sports and is the coolest friend you will ever have!
Thanks Mark. “Barping” is now my favorite word.
U are such a cool guy I want to meet u so bad
Did you say 5 tons? You're telling me that structure weighs 10 000 pounds?
“Your guyses private jet is ready.” Lol, I love people who say “guyses.”
@ 12:44 why does a voice say "enchanté"?
I wish I had half the brain or personality as Mark! Goodness!
WHERE CAN I MEET YOU
2022: atomic toothpaste
noting like a newly made video from mark rober
I think mark is secretly a kid
Pollution😍😍
So we not gonna talk about the lethamyr intro in the background 😶
imagine a random helicopter flies by and sees this
You are officially the KING of birthdays. I’m 21 and I’d love to have a party like that 😂
I literally saw this on the news this morning
No way!
I started crying after hearing Brody using his wish on another kid that was so sweet and so nice of him. Im so glad everyone pitched in to make all this happen for Brody to have an amazing day he will never forget
This video is awsome
Dude, dying kid uses his wish to give some other dying kid a quad bike. Feels occured
For all you rocket league players he used lethamrys theme song
Can anyone comment on the environmental impact of this?
Hello
This editing and music sync is epic!
Your first thought wasn’t to create an elephant toothpaste rocket??
How to get a world record for elephants toothpaste: 20 second build montage
Mark: Casually fried da with Mr.Beast Me: 😮😮😮😮😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
I can’t be the only one who noticed Leths intro 11:29
Mark Rober is insanely flexing with his devil elephant toothpaste formula
Amazing vid
Choosing a private jet over a Tesla kinda defeats the purpose of an electric car being a low emission vehicle. 😄  And that's it for commenting on least relevant things on the video. Great work! Amazing result from the experiment!
Jhhhhh
Bruh the guy who stole the ATV must have had the easiest snag of his life
That was super cool. But not as cool as who u did it for Brody!!! Never herd of elephant and devils paste awesome aweosome aweosme u guys rock !!!
Pov you live in Mark roberts town and see a green cloud 😂
how do you clean this up
I love the elephant toothpaste experiments and everything you do for the kids
Mark my bday is in a few weeks how much we gotta pay?
Mark above me is cooooooool ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
12:45 is where it begins
As a woman I don't trust orbies in a pool.
Cool
“Oh you know my friend mr beast 🙂” uhm… what?
Just shows the importance of the dress rehearsal. It was still spectacular. Kudos,
Whoever filmed this deserves a raise
I was watching this then I look up and ITS ON THE NEWS
can you try devils tooth paste under water?
@theslowmoguys need to find out the recipe for devils toothpaste
13:02 that drone be fast
6:50 SHES SO PRETTY
SLO mo
🗿
Mini Krakatoa

You should build one of those foam cannons from 7:52 but on a huge scale. im talkin house sized foam cannon
Mark rober Tom Scott Colin furs =stoppable force
Awesome ❤
This was awesome!!!
Mark:oooooooooooooooo😮😯  Me:😂
When you hear Leths intro randomly lol
am i the only one who felt like it was the beginning of a lethamyr vid when they had the orbees pool with his intro
The camerawork in this video is INSANE. Props to the editor + drone operator/cameraman!!
He did it again 😎
You should do a Devil's toothpaste volcano
Instrumental version of colt 45 was an interesting music choice lol.
They’re simply too cool.
3:11 imagine believing this is real  Also, 12:42 is what you are here for.
Hi
Mmmm yes child labour
Amazing !! 👏
Thank you Mark, Mr. Beast and all that made this possible.  This was very heart warming and generous.
Youtube : my dog and ferret chilling together ❤
Seriously, thank you for doing what you do, awesome stuff and helps bring things forward that some of us miss.
That is a dedicated cameraman, can't believe he flew on a jetpack to capture that video 😮
Idioten,  das ist umwelt Verschmutzung
Yeet the elephant toothpaste
13:48  you Americans will use anything except the metric system woun't you
I have no job lemme work in that farm plz
I wish everyone in the same situation  could experience something like this
This is how I thought the Braindance in Cyberpunk would be
11:28 Lethamyr intro??
Is elephant paste toxic or like is acid! Did it just go on fire
Bro, i'm from Romania and let me tell you that your YT episode with the Down Syndrome kids is the only one that made me drop tears and donate money for humans. Kids shouldn't suffer.
Imagine being in the beaker and getting shot out the top.
How tf you clean it up
Imagine the military using elephant toothpaste in bombs
He does something crazy then waits a year and hes like oh yea remember when I did that now I'm doing it again but watch how much more insane itll be this time and he never disappoints.  Well deserved for the battles those kids been through . Thank you Mark Rober for your amazing heart and kind soul !! Truly a blessing for everyone involved
U can tell he didn’t like the private jet
Mark reminds me why I should have stayed a science (physics, chemistry) guy instead of chasing the bag in finance.
I love pollution :)
covids a thing
Who was the mystery generous benefactor
Do it again.... but sideways
anyone else notice the colt 45 montage music??? excellent touch
Mark Rober liked it better than the kids lol
Mark, the world doesn't deserve you, but I'm glad we've got you :)
That’s what nasa engeeneer do… no wonder that usa is a small communist country compared to China
Legend
15:09  dude almost saw his death in cinematic mode
2:32 sounds like (Colt 45) song 👍
I like Mark. He knows stuff. And he’s kind.
Mark, Your channel gives me hope for humanity.
i dont wanna be that guy and i dont really care but i thought it was pretty funny  *_every person in this video is white XD_*
The lethamyr intro song played at 12:30
Again?
Yfz 450!!!!!! Shiid bro I'm saving for that one
His scream is so funny
As Australians are in 12 weeks of level 4 lockdowns watching these fun videos saves lives.
All of his videos have kids in them. Just an observation
Those are some truly fantastic drone shots!!
12:45
I feel like you and Collin furze would be a great collaboration
People are waisting the resources soo much without even thinking .. to get views n money .. u guys are over exploiting the resources .. Its About Time Nature will hit back just wildfire , earthquake , rainfall , floodings etc ..
you are our new mrbeast
I kinda want to see a giant devil's toothpaste propelled rocket. Just make it light weight but sturdy and put a parachute on it. No idea what the ideal throat to nozzle ratio would be though.
epic
What is the song at 2:43 ?
I just got an idea. With how much force elephant toothpaste produces I feel like it could be used to propel a vehicle.
?????????
lets reach 12 mil views
Are sharks attracted to the color pink?
The cameramen/cameraman and editors/editor made this video 10X better
1 ton, 5 feet. Find the wrong system
the 9.5k people who di liked there is something wrong with u
Give me the recipe for devils toothpaste
best edit ever
YEA DUDE MARK HERE DOING ELEPHANT DRIP
You have a righteous heart my friend!
I saw you on the news bro
What’s the pressure of an inflated ball?
If you can do it, you can definitely overdo it! lol
The boys after November
how do you clean that up ? do you just leave it there ?
I hope one day my channel can get enough subscribers and followers to give back to the community like this. Well done sir.
doa squirrl maze 3.o
You are restless at these great videos
Watching your videos gives me hope for this world. All the people who step up and give of themselves. Their time and skills. The things they value. Please keep this up.
I like kids
Well, then. Looks like you finally got your record back.
This restored my faith in humanity ❤️
Rip dummies
I love this guy so much
Anyone else noticing the Lethamyr intro music two thirds into the video? :D
8:11 I got so happy for a moment when i thought i saw Adam West :(
Hats off to your editor
Your videos make permanent smiles.
How about a Devil's toothpaste rocket?????
Hope it wasn't no bird around the probably got drowned
by this point i dont think anyone else is gonna try to be marks record lol
Mark: "Is that better than going to the doctor's office?"  Absolutely, this is therapeutic.
hooman
In Germany we would call him "Ehrenmann"
I love ur vids thank u so much for making everyone so happy
awsome  <3
From now on, I'll always be excited when I have to go to the doctor, because... well... this could happen.
Had a tear for this
yay! Pollution!
The devils toothpaste looks like scrambled eggs
great editing skills.
Wow that is awesome
try devils toothpaste in this thing
Wholesome
Wowww
i hope that doesent polute the enviroment
In my opinion your first attempt was cool since it did something you wouldn’t have thought it would do, great video
This dude is the definition of quality over quantity and it’s always amazing
the lethamyr intro
Legal
Are you cousin of Oscar de La Hoya??  btw. NASA PROMOTOR, TESLA promotor.... and the rainbow has 7 colors, not 6... so maybe that´s why it didnt work. The mighty Creator didn´t aprove a wrong representation.
A limo to wow
Wow a priv jest :0
Only Mark Rober can be trusted taking 4 kids into his car and private jet 😂
Thats what i want heaven to be like
i just love how wholesome this channel is
Sir what about the environmental damage you did? Is it worth to damage environment when we are in the middle of fastest ice caps meltdown. 🤦🤦
tell me at least nurk dove the elephant toothpaste on the way down lol nice one mark..... you're a great guy and thank you for everyone involved
A moment of silence for the brave cameras and drones who courageously gave their lives in order to give us these badass shots.
Why did you sound like a tornado siren? 9:44
This is lovely how everyone came together and set up a surprise party for a legend.
you are such an amazing person
Wait mr beast i love mr beast
You have changed peoples lives that’s amazing
12:52 the truly moment, thanks for nothing 😉
12:46 What you came for
wholesome 100
does anyone still cares about elephant toothpaste thing stuff? That feels soooooo 2020
Thats insane!👍👍
you can see how much effort he puts in his videos... RESPECT
Imagine Karen walkin in from other city and shutting this party off bruh
*I would love nothing better than to be related to Mark Rober*
When life gives people lemons Mark Rober and Cave Johnson have things in common.
I could have sworn I’d seen this before 😂
I think this is one of the best YouTube videos I’ve seen in 2021.
can we just recognise all the stuff mark's cameras have been through.
Thanks
Hurray, pollution... greaaaat
Should have put a test dummy inside of the elephant toothpaste beaker
8:40 did he just tell us how to make it orrrrr...
It was so nice for all those people to help you build the surprise party
you can hear the drone when you play lofi music XD 13:11 to dramatic
when you here @lethyamyr intro
What’s fletchers sisters @ tho
11:11 @Lethamyr. Yo this your intro?
Mr beast wow
I can’t believe the glass didn’t break
Which miserable sods downvotes a video like this, seriously.
12:45 is what you went here for
Mark surprises us again
You are a great guy and an inspiration
Humanity Has No Hope
GUYS GUYS I KNOW HOW TO MAKE DEVILS TOOTHPASTE AND ITS EASY TO MAKE FIRST YOU GOT TO [REDACT], [REDACT], [REDACT], [REDACT]
woww the shot at Winston!!!!
Everyone googling devils toothpaste recipe lol
hats off to your editors, the video was flawless!
Should do this for gender reveal
у мамикса сворвал!
Mark Rober  I recognize that stick ladder that is Cal Fire Truck 74 from my Countys CAL FIRE unit where was this video filmed at
*this is gonna convince all those little kids to brush their teeth*
16:06 guy has his hand in front of a nail gun? idk about that...
The secret to Elephant toothpaste is spelled High test *******
Cmon Mark. I wasn't ready to cry today.
11:50 I love how people are watching them ..
fam dis fletcher kid is so fxcking lucky hes been to 2 of these parties
This is by far one of the coolest videos I have ever watched!
Im jelles:[[[[
Congrats mark your video was on Florida news and Fox News! Much love coming from Davie ❤️
"But one thing we didn't think to test was if the food coloring manufacturer added some new ingredient ONLY TO THE PURPLE COLOR so now it randomly reacts with hydrogen peroxide all on its own" 😂😂😂
Imagine standing inside
Was it just me that saw that one kid dunk the basketball hoop in the pool
Wake up Mark Rober posted a video
Probably the coolest uncle in the world.
in times of climate change i think its very unnecessary to take a private jet... rest of the video is cool tho
Mark can never do one big thing he always needs to do more things in one video
@
So, this how volcanos are so explosive!. Couldn't we drill into the bottom of volcanos to release pressure?
Slomo editing feels like Slomo Guys
Im wondering If somebody was about to drown
i’m homeless and these guys can literally just build me a house
Who has the secret ingredient?
🤨 adults normally aren’t this into hanging out with kids and looking ‘cool’ while they do it  DraftKings is currently taking bets on how long it takes for this guy to get caught molesting kids.
Not very environmentally friendly
So in 2021 you're flying in a private jet, blasting out tons of limited resources, to make a toothpaste volcanoe for some pre-teens to cheer at? And people wonder what's wrong with society...
Omg those drone shots! Amazing as ever Mark and friends!!
"The force pushing the elephant toothpaste out the tio is about 50x the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football"  Mark, for the love of science, please use actual measurements. I don't know how to convert this to bars and i am really curious to the internal preasure.
Well Done. I cant wait until the next video
this guy makes my day
How satisfying would that be to be there cause this just looks really cool?
12:48 is the actual experiement
Thanks for putting the sponsor at the end
The recipe for devil’s toothpaste is ligma
You are the BEST!
Loved this!
Where’s the slo mo guys when you need them
Whoever was controlling the drones you deserve a raise
Now I again if the toothpaste didn’t go out the top and all out the bottom 😏 (space ship(
it's 2021 - nature is dying, only idiots flying in private jet
Taco Bell has done better than that
WOW
2:29 " j'me promène dans mon avion parce que c'est super cool "
Ayo foam daddy
I love this channel
You are really smart. I wish i could be you and spend my knowledge on real world problems and still post it on YouTube
Hi, I'm a novice blogger from Russia))
anyone else think of lethamyr??
The King of Random would be proud
Devils tooth paste volcano? 😈
Now put put the flask upside down and make it a rocket
Hey Mark, did you use 20syl music in your video?  I loved the background music and I want to find it!
12:50
Brody is a massive madlad for using his make a wish on some other make a wish kid!
i’m trippen off lsd rn , this is amazing
Wait until you nerds discover girls …
Mark is standing next to a titain.
im sorry but what psi is " 50 times the force you feel pushing against a fully inflated football"
Nurk deserves a raise. Those drone shots were amazing!
my science teacher has been to that ranch and rode the same dune buggy
remember the guy that had like 500 lemons in math problems, yeah i think we got him.
Real life hero
Having mark rober as a uncle would be AMAZING I MEAN-
no people of colour were harmed in the making of this video.. moooostly cuz there wasn't any people of colour in this video.  cool huh?
wholesome
Thats bad for the forest!
Me when a first herd of elephant toothpaste: 🐘=🪥?   Vs what it actually is:
Hi, im from Green peace!
Fletchers sister tho
Just wow... "Wow".
20 mil MARK
Anyone else recognize lethamyr’s intro music?
i wish mark rober was my chemistry teacher
just imagine being this mans child and having the best parties ever
Devils tothpaste receptor   Here is the formula to devils toothpaste- 1. 50 mL of 30 percent or 70 percent Hydrogen peroxide, a little amount of dish soap, 5-10 drops of food coloring and finally, about 7 mL of dry magnesium dioxide   Thank me later.
Mark Rober is possibly the coolest guy ever...
Mark rober did a small nuke!!
I think we can officially say that Mark Rober is the Einstein of the coolest ideas ever!
Holy sh!t that’s high  Well done
Mr. beast😂🖕🏻
Where’s the beef
OK but the cameras they are using are amazing
Dude, try to actually get elephant toothpaste out the atmosphere, if you could do that, you could literally become a legend in the engineering world
Mark Rover is on par with Mrbeast in content.
Dude, you are such an inspiration.
big fat respect going to you Mark <3
Who’s dale
Congrats Mark! I've been watching for a while- and it makes me so happy to see that you've done this, I hope you keep going, and don't stop posting/uploading
Oh his mfs neighbors the luckiest people in the world
I always love these elephant toothpaste videos!!!!!!!
This is one of the most wholesome things on the internet. Thanks for always returning my faith in humanity.
*happy Mark Rober noises*
Bro I got dat guys same shoooooes
Yo what drone do you use
I swear that town welder must be swimming in money 😂
When you hear the Lethamyr intro
wait.. 13:57 how the heck did he get a slo-mo, matrix style moving shot, that far in the air??  It looks like a drone shot, but the perspective changes around while the image is practically frozen. The drone would've had to be moving SUPER fast to get that shot. You normally need multiple cameras, in different positions, to get that kinda shot and you stitch the images together.
me when me when me when ur mom me when ur mom...
We don’t have a Batman in this world because Mark Rober is not a billionaire…
Adopt me
9:51 Plottwist, someone exchanged it with construction foam
Im not crying you're crying
,
i love these vids!
if i hear ooohhhhh!!! one more time im gonna-
i’m only here to figure out what an elephant toothpaste is
what was the music for the build montage ( i cant spell well) i love that song but forgot it
9.2k jealous haters!!!
Dr. M. Rober
How do you pay for that?
you are so inspirational - the statement at the end really hit me hard
Mark lives in a town full of engineers
So next year even bigger? lol jk
The elephant toothpaste was even bigger the the attack titan
Gotta love that child labor
Was Fletcher always a doctor? 𝑨𝑳𝑾𝑨𝒀𝑺 𝑯𝑨𝑺 𝑩𝑬𝑬𝑵
NOW I know why they call it *"elephant toothpaste."* 🤦💁😅 Take a listen at 13:01
E
Thats Awesome, You are an awesome uncle!!
Makes my 💙 happy. Well done, sir. Keep it up. (extra points for using the word "barfing" 🤣)
I don't think there's a way to like this video enough!
thank  you too!
Me looking how it says foam daddy
If Mark was my science teacher I would be so happy 😁
image what that bird flying around was thinking when it shot up
Congrats that who sees this comment heres 8 diamonds💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
Mark you're like epic cool bud.
Mark is a true Saint to his community and followers. He really spreads the most positive message while also teaching and having the best time. He inspires me to try and be better in a bleak world.
WOOOO LET’S GOOOO!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
ecology
in a hurry? 12:48
That is amazing seeing all of this.  Keep up the work and never stop learning experimenting.
And that is how the zombie apocalypse began
brody
So the catalyst is concentrated nitric acid?
I wonder what he is gonna do for 20 mill O_O now
B.
Yayyyyyyy I’ve been hoping for this 😁
welp  now i know where to go in case of a nuclear fallout :D
Not every hero wears a cape, some of them build glitter bombs and Elephant toothpaste volcanoes.
Imagine being a bird...
Go make more tik toks please!!
This elephant toothpaste looks 100% like cgi, or a physics simulator! It's freaking irl magic.
incredible. your an amazing human
That was fantastic. Such a wonderful thing to do.
Probably the best thing on the internet. Well done.
Even though he has aged so much he still has yet to come to the end of his fun and child entertainment. Still holding the title of 'Coolest uncle ever'.
Great Job Mark!
If you don't like these videos then how are you alive?
I love your videos and have for a very long time… One one thing I want to note... is that there is an extreme lack of diversity in the people in these videos… Usually it’s all white thin people… It would be really cool to see you branch out and be a little bit more inclusive
I love the fact that Mark can make his videos fun and educational
Next year this guys gonna get Elon musk to help him
Pilots landing be like: Huston, we have a problem.
what about a rocket.. but fueled by elephant toothpaste...
Fartcano
“The pressure inside the flask was about 50 times what you would feel if you pushed on a football.”   That comes to between 4.3 MPa and 4.65 MPa! That’s a LOT of pressure! Used American football of 86 to 93 kPa pressure to calculate!
Insane
These are some disney cinematics
Fifth in humanity restored
9:40 I will NOT clean that up x3
Lol "I knew it was a limbo". Gotta love kids and I KNOW I did worse as a kid. I thought ditch was pronounced with a b instead of a d. "I want to play in the b****" is a literal quote from my childhood.
At this rate, Guinness is to run out of records to hand out
Fun fact Did you know you can eat food like if you knew this
Mark casually makes new Toothpaste: Doctors: 😐
HUMAN↘️⭕
That kid is the most wholesome human I heard of this year! What a champ.
When the cool kid has a cool uncle
the sound that came when the sky view slo-mo cam was just INSANE!! :)
I wish I had parties like these
who cleans up this mess?
What do you mean JUST +1 uncle points its so many more though
What was the pressure reading in PSI?
that I ship you and
Mark rober can I kidnap your kids and take them across a state and a ride in a Tesla? thank u
Now I want the formula for devils toothpaste😂
Impressive reverse backflip
I love science and he just makes it better
Your videos literally unlock a completely new kind of happiness in me
Baka
Must be nice being white
Make a video and explain wuy pools filled with Coca-Cola don’t work.
Imagine your in a plane an you see green elephant toothpaste on your window.
wow i am touched deeply
Who else saw the +1 uncle points?
9:28 rip fence
I love to see that kids smile
Lemons generically floating around in space 😆
your 100% called the "cool uncle".
I have one question. How do you have time to do all of this?!?
The excess, mark. Think about it
Result : 13:00 if you save sometime in your life
Those drones shots are INSANE.

The hard-to-find lift inexplicably subtract because deficit luckily book from a secretive bongo. ablaze, recondite playroom
1:12 I honestly almost cried the moment I heard that. The level of kindness and generosity you have to have to use your one wish in this world to give someone else a second chance at their wish. I haven't even watched the rest of the video but whatever happens I know that Brody deserves all of the fun he had at the party.
I really enjoy your video, the rythme, the joice of some kids, the engineering parts ! But when I see this, I could not stop thinking of : such a demesure, it's way too big, to flashy. And I feel guilty for loving such video wich are close and also so far from the things I value in life
Who else wishes they saw this in person
.
what if he did somthing for technoblade
Faidherb squared you legend
@Mark Rober - You're my favorite youtuber, and videos like this are why you're also the most worthy of supporting.  Aside from being an amazing video, you also did something awesome for those kids.  I have never seen you ask about support via Patreon or similar, and there doesn't seem to be any way to support you directly.  I understand supporting through the sponsors, and I do that as much as possible, and I have my "Phat Gus refrigerator magnet" displayed proudly in my kitchen, but there's got to be more we can do to help.  You should setup a way to help fund your "creative engineering class" for those who want to take it but can't afford it.. something.. somehow to give back to you!
Lets just ignore the fact that the flask still ripped at the joints... alright?
you should do a cross over with the slomo guys
Much better then a doctors visit
Please Give out the recipe for devils toothpaste for people who signed a special form and waiver
Jet propulsion to elephant toothpaste propulsion, this guy and the crew are legendary
Your my hero
This is what gets 11m views on America's internet, ladies and gents. Someone mixing a bunch of yeast and peroxide. Meanwhile people who draw lifelike murals or write incredible ballads never get seen.  What a circus.
Heh heh backho
I wish I meet you I.m a big fan
Dats a lot of toothpaste
LOL. 50 times the force when pushing a fully inflated football..?  How many atmospheres?
I swear, this guy is from a completely different age of time
congrats on this
The Mark Rober and Mr Beast crossover was the YouTube crossover of the century. They should do more collabs in the future
"I told my friend MrBeast," *The ultimate flex*
Relatable to taco bell resturaunts
Why are there no vulgar jokes here?
We need more people like Mark, who use their platform to bring happiness to others.
Thank you for being such an amazing human, Mark.
This is how many hours it took to clean up the elephant toothpaste V
I hope the people in your life show you this level of over-the-top kindness when you need it, Mark
12:52 youre welcome
11 million views in 3 days 😬
Oh yeah rent out a building and fill it to the brim with elephant toothpaste
Absolutely amazing.  Mark Rober restores faith in humanity -- a truly great person!
Love the drone pilot.. "Ok, this should be high enou....Hoooooly.."
People that use devil toothpaste in ther mouth
Starving kids in China could have eaten that toothpaste
Draft Kings? Isn`t your target audience a little too young?
Alright who started cutting onions when the atv was given to brody?
Thats a volcano nkt elephant tllth pasthe
Was the party even better than Fletchers??…
Videos like this restore my faith in humanity. Mark, MrBeast, everyone who does things like this or just contribute to things similar are people who deserve more than life.
9:43 pollution? @MarkRober
YEAR 2050,  KID ON MARS:    IS THAT EARTH PUKING? HIS MOM:    NO, ITS MARK ROBER WITH HIS ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE.
This is re-uploaded bruh
This guy uses his crazy knowledge and genius brain on completely useless things… but it’s really cool
Best science teacher ever
Imagine if he accidently destroyed the earth doing this lol
O ibere ja fez isso
And how was the cleanup ?
Now next time put a person in there and make an elephant toothpaste human canon.
I've waited for you to do this, very cool
Human is crazy, but i still like it
12:52 coolest part (which i think lol)
It would be alot creepier if it was red
Mark, do you think you're Captain Dissolution now by breaking down their camera tricks?
The SLIDE was made with R Tech Insulation Foam boards and a plastic liner if anyone was wondering!!!
Mark I got a cold one time, can you do something this awsome for me
Mark rober is the best uncle
F manual do mundo
12:45 is what you're here for.   Thank me later 😌
yes
Any more news on the rumours of ur “space flight”
This was insane
How many atmospheres is force-50-times-more-that-you-feel-pushing-against-a-fully-inflated-football ? Your freedom units confuse me.
This is so cool Love It!
Me on December 1st be like : 13:01
Just switch over to metric, then u dont need footballs to measure force.
12:45 so u dont have to watch through filler boring content
I love how they had the fire department on t Stand by
Why is this so interesting?
Felt like i was watching David Dobrik for a moment
That was massive!!! So cool
I bet Mark is gana find a new way to do it next year and get a new record
You sed the ingredients for the devil toothpaste
Why can't some chemical reaction like this be put into cluster type bombs and be dropped from planes to put out forest fires?
No better sound than that of a child laughing with joy. (And for those who clicked they didn't like.....I guess there will always be Scrooges in the world)
Mark: Option one- A Tesla Them: Option one Mark: Option two- Private Jet No one: Literally no one: Another second of silence: Brody: Option two (in the confused but messed up at first tone
"...50 times the force u feel when pushing against a fully inflated football.."  And how many bar / torr / psi does a fully inflated football have ???
I think it a nuke hahaha
12:48 for those who actually have a life to get to after watching videos
i am about to get a dna test to see if im this dudes cousin lmao
Hearing Lethamyr intro music on another video is really weird.
You know its something big when the building montage is more than 10 seconds
what teachers think it will happen to boys when they see 0.000001% of a girl's shoulder 9:35
And how do u clean this stuff up?
9:35 So, we're going to ignore blue and purple malfunctioning? D:
this mrbeast2
you should team with jlaser- make the project big
The Kids have greatest stories to tell their childrens.
That was definetely not his last try
What a beautiful video
Mark Rober, you are this Generations Bill Nye.
You have a heart that this world doesn’t deserve Mark. Thank you.
This was insane
yeah. It's a... ähm... it's a Shrek?
At last
loving the slo-mo guys type shots
lol you just stripped the other kid of their world record.
What's the music playing during the montage? I love it.
➡️🚶‍♂️ _Human_
Does dyslexia qualify me for this
Im not crying , your crying!
And what is it in rest-of-the-world units?
wow bro
First 😭😭😭 second😃😃😃third😱😱😇 that's how i feel 10/10
Mark we have a picture of you in my school board.
Question: how do you clean up this thing?  I mean, he blows it away but it cant just disappear like that?
So that purple food coloring company's stocks went down huhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The maker-equivalent of Tony Hawk landing that 900-degree spin. Congrats Mark!😄🤙🏻 (and Brody!!)
He is so amazing 🤩
When a science YouTubber has a better amusement part advertisement than six flags😁😁😁😁😛
Mark rober you are prbaly the most craziest and amazing youtuber ever
rip cleaning crew
Super heartwarming but are we supposed to know who dale is?
Ok next you need a rocket powered by devil's toothpaste
When my crush says DOnT HOLD BACK
Respect
Imagine being able to have a single wish for ANYTHING ( anything possible ) and used it for someone else. He deserved every second of that enjoyment.
Caught the afroman Easter egg.
And how long did it take you guys to clean up the mess
3:45 you can see how poorly photoshopped the hole is it’s literally moving
Crazy to think of that devil's toothpaste and it becoming the size of the house
RIP the other kid that had the 60ft record
Foam daddy 😂
the lethmyr song
LETS GO BRODY!!!
12:52 thank me later
<3
When the volcano is so high it goes off the screen
I thought we already done this ?
Where the different colored people at “racially motivated“
what about just shutting off the top and let it blast out the bottom
Why.....
How much do u want for that devil toothpaste’s formula
RIP the environment
Mr beast
As a make a wish kid myself this is insanely cool

I’m so happy for Brody😁💯💯
the best part is he said "my friend mr beast" as if we dont know him            because we dont
Wow I no need to buy new toothpaste anymore location?
Bro I love how the green foam can be used as a green screen. You know what to do guys
Coolest uncle I never had.
13:02  You're welcome
12:50 is when the elephant toothpaste is released :)
This guy should be a national asset
I love mr beast part
i really like your style of editing & videos. Buuttt im also kinda curious, how it all came to be. It would be nice if there would me more & longer content of the projects and not only these 20 or so seconds. ❤
why does the launch of elephant toothpaste look like an si-fi scene about to happen
Your are a epic🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine if you do this all for a kid and it turned out they ARE the quiet kid 💀
Wow such frames they did a garbo edit lol 😂
@tomas_felds pa cuando?? Jajajajajaj
Used to do a bubble trampoline when you do it it gets a super slippery and like makes you go super high
Lethamyr energy there for one of the montages
Lol what u get for working a child lol u get painter
12:51
Absolutely the best video of tooth paste 🤣
This guy scammed draft kings because he let them sponsor the video
am i the only one wondering what would've happened if u put a human on top
2035 : new world record for largest Elefant toothpaste. *entire world covered in Elefant toothpaste *
Absolutely beautiful message at the end!
Devils toothpaste in the same size class that you did for the worlds biggest elephant toothpaste
If the eruption was that cool in the video, just imagine how it was in person
He just turned into a Mr beast
You should use the same flask but up the liquid by 25% more, let’s make it seen from space 😂
w
12:50
13:57 amazing shot.
8:19 bruh
Thats the Reason why i pay montly my wifi
I ran out of toothpaste the other day...
Mark just to say I think there was some pressure escaping from the bottom...
I think you need to build a rainbow with giant flasks
Imagine if the reaction caught on fire large scale when it was all over the house
People like Mark Rober are changing the world!!! Keep it up!
The kid sure doesnt get excited very easy
12:48 for anyone just wanting the big one
This is insane
Repent from your sins
This is mark robers zima blue
Do you think it could launch a human a few feet up?
Mark Rober is probably even more generous than Mr Beast, all of this for one kid, all out of kindness <3
omksus
the story behind this and all you did made me cry 😭😭😭
The red circle identifying that was a human was very informative
How do we clean it
not trynna start something, but these kids dont seem very appreciative.
I wouldn't be su[rises if the next one is a elephant paste nuke
Next episode: Mark Rober's Elephant tooth paste can be seen from ISS
The elephants toothpaste sounded like an elephant
This is so nice I love this video
11 million in 2 days
this is my kingdom c-
If Mark Rober dies, the entire world would stop. The mans a legend
"mark, this is the 7th time you've gotten the world record for elephant toothpaste"
this video did NOT need to be this long lol
'the force is about 50x that of pushing against an inflated football' ya know, if you also loaded a death row convict into that elephant toothpaste flask, could you also break the world record of the first execution by elephant toothpaste?
I dont mean to be a villain here but, i think its time for us humans to use our given intelligence to create or invent things to make a better world, not just things that make views on youtube.
How will you clean it
this is insane! deserves every piece of like, comment and respect! gj! :D
his videos are cool with science im gonnalearn from mark rober now
This is insane and absolutely beautiful
Mark can you do something with basketball plz I love the videos thx if you do this shout me out thx😀
I want to meet you
I wish mark was my uncle
Question... is flying in a jet better for the environment or driving a Tesla?
Mark rober is the type of guy to build a rocket to the moon powered by devils paste !!!
Such a awesome well done video everything was perfect!
Gotta go to sleep, i swear this is the last one
Lol all your friends are kids 😂
I should have watched this earlier.  11 million + views.  Sheesh....I wonder how long it will be until NASA begs him to come back.
Disclaimer: Please do not wish that you were a Make A Wish child
What Money can do.....needless
7:48 can we talk about how smooth that transition is though???
Can we all just appreciate the amazing drone camera shots! Respect to the pilot!
Mark rober is the only one that can make child labor joke sounds wholesome lol
This warms my heart♡♡♡
Lol that's the most american way of measuring the chamber pressure, what the heck does 50x the presure when you squeeze a foot ball meat. If only the had units of measurement for pressure other than football hardness.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh wow
since ur videos are so rare there like a gift to us
I wonder who is mr beast is 🤔
I wasn't expecting to cry today🥲
shrek went all out on the gender reveal this time
Mr beast & mark rober can make human happy more much :) ♥️
The ecosystem be like: Gee thanks mark….
Stunning aerial still 3D views of the giant elephant toothpaste geysers to match those hearts of gold!
Mark Rober is the internets uncle.

Wow
Lol
Hi Brody
𝙸𝚝𝚜 𝟸𝟸𝟾𝟽
must be nice...
Yeah, definitely go with the private jet bcs there isn't enough pollution in the atmosphere already! Why go with a car that doesn't pollute when u can go with a jet that emits around 2 tons of co2 per hour. Such wise decisions.
I would of made the neck smaller. That sucker would of went way higher.
Fletchers sister is kinda cute tho
5 on trending
You are the modern age Bill Nye! 🤓 Please keep making videos forever, I want my future kids to be watching you!
It’s the scream for me
Insane drone footage
Peep the @Lethamyr theme music in the Orbeez pool!
Rober is better than Mr. Beast.
those drone shots…
If you can say "My friend Mr. Beast" you know you've made it in life
Cool, cool.   *now clean it.*
mark doing random stuff   Me- YOUR NOW COLABING WITH MRBEAST!?!?!? WHAT ELSE TOMMYINNIT DREAM KARL!?!?
im confused 8.7k thumbs down??? what part is disappointing
Is this a world record?
Ok things are gettin outta hand
Mark robber your videos are so cool my 3rd grade teacher showed your wheels and axles video from like a while ago. So 1+ teacher points
Splatoon vibes
wow lmao, now THIS is quality content
Fletcher is back less gooo
the world really needs more Mark Robers.
Mark: is that more Orbeez than you di-  Mr beast: No. 😐
I feel so jealous 🙄
American football is bullshit, it is not even with the feet
You’ve actually got to be one of the most selfless people on the planet I can only imagine how great those kids must be feeling 👍
You are the best
Why am I not surprised Mark and Jimmy are friends? They're two absolute legend :P!
12:52
"Somehow always comes back"   after giving away something: *gets glitchy and loses stuff*
Now if only they got him a helmet,  last year I would of been dead of I didn't wear my helmet on my yzf450r
f iberê
13:01
I just realized the im not subbed
❤❤❤
I wish i could like this video 1K times
Imagine these cringekids who just watch a guy flex on them with youtube money.
Ah Yes,  the legendary 20 second build montage .
That was amazing, nice to see so many people working together for something positive.
Mark stonknigge
My respect for Mark after he made it in lgbt colours 📉📉📉, my happiness after the last two didn't go off so it wasn't full lgbt 📈📈📈
that foundation for the elephant toothpaste thing looks exactly like foundations in rust
Thank you to all those amazing people that put their time and effort to building all these cool things and all the work behind the scenes.  Just amazing.  Made a special day for him.
I was crying at the end of this, mark really just goes out of his way to make people’s lives a little brighter and it’s so heart warming to see
Now devils toothpaste actually is well devils toothpaste. DUE TO IT BEING ON FIRE.
Well....AMAZING!!
So now you need to build a rocket powered by the elephants tooth past
My guy is literally a demigod
I love venturi effect
Well done sir;  well done.
Mark is like that one chemistry teacher you've always wanted
The enviroment
Now we need it to go to space!
anyone gonna tell @mrbeast
I don't understand. If the goal is to best handle inwards pressure going out, why not put the panels on the inside of the steel skeleton?
The far flavor incidentally rub because wolf iteratively claim during a boorish eel. sloppy, upset engine
12:45 thank me later
Now he has to pay insurance.
I have a question. Why it's called "Elephant toothpase"?
its acts like this that give me hope in humanity
What about a flask that takes off like a rocket on purpose 🤔
RIP to all the cameras that were lost in the devil's toothpaste
That the sweetest thing mark and mr beast had ever done so far
I can just imagine this being used in the world war
Why do I wanna eat it?
Because you’re so cool

7:45
This is the world we live in ...
Dude I so want to chat with you in like real life

Eruption at 12:46
First of all amazing cinematography
Scientific MrBeast
Hello
8:14 that kid is nuuuts
The force is 50 times pressing against a fully inflated football. So none, cause i dont play football? How much is it in scientific units?
9:41 the wolves are howling
Anyone else hear Colt 45 in this video from 2:30 - 3:00?
I can say that mark will be a dream guy for kids after this vid
U just built the perfect tornado shelter sell it !!!
Who did all the fpv drone footage?  anyone from youtube?
this dude is on Australian news
The absolute king of context. He could have spent A LOT less money and just tried to smash the record; but what kind of video would that have made? What kind of impact would it have made? The genius of Mark Rober is applying context to his records. It sounds a little heartless, but tying a story like this to your videos is what crushes the algorithm and keeps the conversation going. At the end of the day he gets a guarenteed viral hit AND he makes a massively positive impact on people's lives. Mark is a genius engineer, from the way he engineers his records, his videos, how he hits the algorithm, and his heartfelt positive impact to society. This is what all science should strive for.
Ok
Those are orbeez are like super terrible for the planet
Y are u the nises person I know
MAKE IT BIGGER!
6:28 What was that sound 😂😂
12:45  You're welcome
Super wholesome, great video as always
7:40 prince Andrew in da house.
Environment her: Thanks
The Green Party people are gonna knock on ur house.
You do such cool stuff I love your videos
He can officially have the title the coolest uncle you don't have
I hate to be that guy,  I can't help but notice there are no minorities here.  And I mean this in the least antagonistic way.  I just see all these youth having fun and learning cool practical science and it struck me that I didn't get that kind of opportunity.  Please keep up the cool science promotion Mr Rober.
Strange. i was literally just thinking about elephant toothpaste
Dude ur channel is what u tube is all about,.,,, CONGRATES !!!!!     ( 4real ur channel; is Awsome! )
9:48 why did that sound so tasty
elon musk minus
I thought this was the other one
This made me cry 😭😭 this is so sweet
Whilst I for one have never brush an elephant's teeth, I would imagine this is the amount of paste one would need to properly cleanse them!! Fantastic! - Rikkard Griffinheart
12:48 why u all r here
The fact that he used his wish to do that… just wow glad you guys put this together!
Non-greedy MrBeast
What's a elephant toothpaste?
anyone else think the anonymous benefactor is mrbeast.
Omg I remember watching the first one I have never clicked a video so fast
Saw you on the news, congrats
Awesome video Mark!!!!
I would like for Mark to be my dad.
Everything about this was amazing! Brody deserved every last bit.
Elephant toothpaste rocket next year???
he probably spent 920M dolars
nani again xd
❤️❤️
You give me hope
Science is really fun
Why don’t they do experiments like this in chemistry at school 😍
Mini volcano
Youre awesome Mark :)
That public use 'colt 45' song in the middle of the video tho xD
“I wanna hear option 2” “Are you sure it’s a Tesla!” Exactly Mark, a Tesla ain’t no RX7
make a rocket out of the flask by turning it up side down and see how far up it goes
The editing in this omg 🥵
umm mr.mark do u know HOW BAD THIS TOOTH PASTE IS FOR THE INVIROMENT~!!!!
Wow orbeez pool looks fun
Great job, faith in humanity is restored
Great video, and an even better message at the end. Only thing I would've wanted to know the actual amount of pressure. It would've been nice to hear the actual value instead of some absurd comparison to footballs.
How to clean up all of them.....
This guy is mrbeast with a college education
I love watching your videos you make me so happy thx for posting videos
Love from india bro❤️. You are really awesome 🔥🔥
Question whats with you and 20 seconds build montage

Wow, science is great.
Made a mini volcano 😭
Science Fair: No Volcanoes  Mark's son: *Shows up with that*  Science Fair: Nevermind
You have made it to Australia because they where talk about U on the news
This muffin is awfully shaped like a Hamster
Fun Fact: You have searched on google how much money MrBeast has.

“Is that more orbeez than you did” “no”
Cried happy tears!
This is true commitment
I love your videos
Bless🙏 the kid that give his last wish to another kid bless you gods child 🙏  loved that 👏👏👏
That was pretty dang high up though, hilarious
Your Mormon church’s hate for the lgbtq is hurtful. And paying tithing you agree with them
😍😍😍  Nice Volcano 👍👍👍
Is this what kids with too much money do?
Mark is truly, a madlad. The maddest lad.
I could have sworn mark said pregnant lest.I was like "ehhh😐
This makes me so happy. Everyone involved has the biggest hearts.
mr beast

WHAT THE DOG DOING
I hope to become like you when I grow up
Imagine putting devil’s toothpaste on that flask.

Make a bigger one. 500feet next pls XD
Absolutely fantastic! Lovely to see . one thing, not everyone gets back after giving. now 60, I do my best, I help, but nothing ever come back yet. Not even had a birthday party. so please remember in commenting, noit everyone gets something back. But he was a great kid and fantastic party! and what you do is tremendous! Well done!
It's cool that ppl can do stuff like this :D
I'm gonna cry 100 days ..coz i'm not a nephew of Mark
the volcano is cool and all but can we just take a moment to appreciate the drone shots  (I really liked the drone shots from the orbeez pool)
Lol the pool full of plastic orbs. That's like pollution cranked to 11. So much pollution in this video.
Guy hangs out with alooot of kids....

Imagine not knowing what it was and just seeing it over the trees
Satan would buy his devil toothpaste
15:09 it comes back to you with 19.7 million subscribers
this is so smooth i love this vid
Instead of devils toothpaste he should have called it mammoths toothpaste. Makes more sense in my opinion
I love Marks videos! Congrats on the amazing world record. Your videos are inspiring to a wide audience.  This video has everything that should make me love it. But to tell the truth, I'm loosing interest kinda and would love to see Mark do something new!
I started crying after hearing Brody using his wish on another kid that was so sweet and so nice of him. Im so glad everyone pitched in to make all this happen for Brody to have an amazing day he will never forget
such a gut wrenching accent
Sorta odd hearing Lethamyr’s intro in this lol
0:19 destroied the car
I love your video it is the best.
4:06 what a weird shape... You know what I mean ( :
All these experiments only makes me wonder about how much they're paying the cleanup crew
Meanwhile somewhere some other people are trying not to destroy planet.
Me wondering why it’s called “Elephants…” my answer: 13:01
What's in the pool?
2 day 10million view….
Desolator ready. Spread the doom!
Was that a bird crashing through the flying tootpaste?
You literally made it on CBS news
Mr beast and Mark are probably one of the most kindest YouTubers I have seen
Is Mark robber Elon musk
Credit to the editor these drone shots are unreal
Congratulations you just made it onto CBS this morning
we did elephant toothpaste for a science project because we were inspired by your other elephant toothpaste stuff
12:38 how ya doin?
Stop polluting our earth
I hope you are polluting the environment nicely...
+ 1 uncle point = 0.01 bobux
Ouais super merci pour la pollution
Humans laugh, the planet weeps.  Fair trade.
It’s looks more like a volcanic eruption than elephants toothpaste only that it’s not molten lava and ash coming out of the flask.
its on the news
1ST OF ALL HOWWWWWWWWWW JUST HOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
You should do this in space 😂
As one person once said  “You need to live life to the fullest”
Mr beast is your friend that is amazing
This just made me happy
Thanks for pointing out what a human looks like, I had no idea!
He’s breaking space, time and reality
Now it’s time for the walnut heist 3.0
That’s just 64 feet less than the length of a Clemson Class Destroyer!
"If you want to do something. Go all out" - Sun Tzu

Drowning in orbees has to be the worst way to go

Can you please do a part 3?
There’s always some weird kid’s party at the end
You are such a wholesome person Mark (and Mr Beast) plus a pretty genius one too. You make the most creative and unique content. It is always exciting to watch.
Amazing!!!!!!!!!
We can all see why this is 4 on trending
It’s on the news!
LES GO,THAT A HARD BLAST VOLCANO
Congratulations, Rober. You’re on the news! 👍
Mark you made it on the news
What’s the devils toothpaste formula
People that are not knowing what happened be like:😳
You should send a rocket into the sky with elephant toothpaste
In theory if you shrank the width of the top could it go higher?
Ok this was epic
That was so epic!!! 😝🤟
UwU. Mark is so wholesome. And all the other people in the video as well. Big UwU
He spent a year figuring out if it was possible to do but didn’t consider why he would do it
12:52 what schools think happens when boys see a girls shoulder
For those wondering for devils toothpaste use Potassium permanganate instead of yeast
e
I have an idea to make it higher
This is so cool!
THATS DEVILS TOOTHPASTE IN THE PICTURE FOR THE VIDEO
you came for 12:50
@Nurk FPV you got a little caught by the speed of those toothpaste blasts!  The orbit shots were killer tho 👊🏼
Or... make lemon juice with it...
When life gives Mark lemons, he spends a year doing something.
The amount of work for this video :0 Respect  🙌
Just a question: What's the environmental impact of all the chemicals and food coloring getting into the local environment? What do you do with the orbeez afterwards? I love what your doing and the way you impact these kids (it's amazing) but surely there's a more sustainable way to fill a pool.
Wow amazing work
Lucky I wish I was living in that dream
you are such an amazing person
Elephant toothpaste: defeats you. Also elephant toothpaste a while later: loses to you. Only if it was orange/red it would be a proper elephant toothpaste volcano.
Next day, jumbo couldn't find a toothpaste in entire city.
How do you get all the orbeez out of the pool 😅😂
"one of lifes most basic questions- *how far can elephant toothpaste go upwards"*
CONGRATS!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏👏👏👏
got everyone is the city like it’s town of salem sheeesh
Such a positive and great community ❤️
Too easy!
12:50
Best uncle ever!
13:47 atleast give us a number on the screen with metric conversation mark. SMH.
in 10 years most of those kids will forget each other existed
Okay who wants to give some love to the FPV drone pilot from 7:20 .  Respect!
I wish I had a world record too even if it is for the stupidest thing ever ^^
Props to the drone guy... (heh)
Whats the point?
Finally! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This reminds me of the Pass It On commercials I saw as a kid; what a role model for these children to have
Next video: I went to Mars with Elon Musk
Hi mark
And a little bit of ''CHILD LABOR''   FBI! OPEN UP! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST MARK ROBER FOR CHILD LABOR AND MAKING THEN WORK ON HARSH CONDITIONS!
so cool
Not all heroes wear capes, but some used to work at NASA
12:48 Is why you clicked . 👍
Very appropriate that the noise made by the drones flying @ 13:00 kind of sounds like an elephant blowing it's trunk.
As a Brody, I gotta hand it to you for helping out the young hero Brody. He really is what a Brody should aspire to be.
Is this not bad for the environment?
15:13 drone pilot just standing still to show dominance
You are literally the best person in existence.
Why isn’t this 1st on trending thooo
Child labour lol
I broke a world record too but only kept it for 15 F-ING DAYS
12:50 is what you’re looking for
This is awesome
This guy is either super creative or lives in one of the most boring neighbors ever to come up with the things he does
You stole ducky Bhai's music
And I wonder what I was doing that time
gg that was cool!
white
Mark Rober honestly represents the golden heart of humanity and everything that humanity should strive to be.
My phone is at 5%, can i have one of these?

All that money spent only to end up with Arrowhead water in a limo smh
Question can you necessarily touch elephant toothpaste
Leth?
TU Meke bro mean,why don't drop that stuff on top of bushfires.
9:56 looks like a symbiote
America doesn't need the metric system, it has 'pushing against footballs'.
❤❤❤
Mr beast uses iPhone 11 even though he can own millions of iPhone 12 pro max.... 💕
How big was this budget?
Is fletchers sister single? Just asking for a friend
Na otro recor otra fiesta
Mark Rober is the modern Micheal Jackson. Theres a reason he takes dying kids, they cant testify
Say a meteor was supposedly dropping to your area  That would be one cool as anti meteor blaster
What if you do elephant toothpaste but upsidedown elephant toothpaste rocket!!!!
Fully inflated football... The new SI unit for pressure
Best Uncle :,)
Everytime i watch a mark video i get reminded of how amazing this dude is and how hes just the best😂😂
Just make the top opening a little thinner and it will go higher. Maybe next year?
12:50
its lovely how youtubers in 2021 mix teslas with private jets. Its keeps the balance which is responsible i think...
13:49 u Americans really don't want to use the normal measuring units do u? XD amazing video
Brody is a king in this world
12:40
@mrbeast needs to watch this
12:50
15:04 , 15:08 he says it like that's normal...
Everybody that helped on the project hopefully gets something nice back.
How much psi/bar is 50x the force of pushing a inflated football ?
10m views in 2 days, I love it when Mark gets together with friends and family for these huge projects. But for that kid to give away his wish to another kid whose got stolen (hope they found them) melts my heart. Thank you Mark and Mr Beast and every body in the community for giving him this awesome day with his friends. 👌❤
Mark and mr beast single handedly restore faith in humanity
White kids with money wasting money
Only just discovered this channel but it's great to see someone living life to the max and sharing it with others, therein lies the joy!  Great stuff.
Dr. Strange help me and make me Mark's nephew
Thank you for contributing to ruin the environment 😂😂😂
Hello?     We've been trying to reach you regarding your cars extended warranty
we found the recepie for devis toothpaste
What goes around, comes around! My way of living!
He does this whole tree planting thing just to fly somewhere via private jet and use up tons of water while California is in the middle of a drought?
Seni adalah ledakan
13:10 ❤️❤️
I love your videos mark. but didn't it go confetti? doesn't that mean that the nozzle was too small? soooo, any possibility for part 3? just curious about it.
The planet is literally dying and we are here promoging to fly in a privat jet because driving 1 hour would be too long.
Очевидный фейк, графен как у марвела.
Needed a jet stream hose
As a kid who has a bunch of conditions and doesn't get to have fun often, it warms my heart to see them having fun.
Aye dope
OMG!
Wow, everything about this video is B E A U tiful!!!!!
Ok nice
We need more people like mark

Mark: Time to put on some gloves and burn my hands Reddit: Big Brain Time

Sheeeesh
what do you do with all of it after clean up etc
the last sentence , was truly , truly inspiring
i spent a year making a giant flask ! here’s a 20 second montage 🤣
I have a question about the aftermath. What happens with all your constructions after the videos? You know 5 ton flask is not something to leave behind you in the middle of a field.
Ok mark whats the pressure of pushing on a fully inflated football?
13:34 me eating taco bell
I just wonder how long time it takes to clean the mess.
Fantastic video
This is what happens if you grew up watching Nickelodeon I guess lol
I cant say anything but 👏👏👏

W video❤️👍🏽
We have to put up with a lot of c--p in the world - then we have you Mark.  Thank you.
Devil toothpaste instead of elephant? Is it impossible? Does it require the fire department? Or will it set the sky in fire? We may never know
10:05 bro...
Now do it with Devils Toothpaste 😈
Surely if you had a longer nozzle on the end of the flask it wouldn't come out as misty?
Mark Rober is the kind of person I desire everyone to be. Mark Rober's videos, is where men cry.  Thanks Mark
Nice camera

First off love your channel and all that you do second do you think you over built the flask to use the devil's toothpaste mix how much more pressure could it be
Wait who cleaned it all?
I know you probably didnt think about this, but what kind of chemicals is in that stuff?? And is it really responsible to leach all that stuff into nature???
I love these videos so much always makes me smile
Insane
How many points you have
Brody is such a remarkable kid. I can't believe the generosity. Love these videos.
2 days 10 mil !!!
I really wonder how high a elephants toothpaste fueled rocket would actually fly now..... Thanks Mark
The devils toothpaste is like the krabby patty secret formula.
He should make a devils tooth paste rocket
these kids are having as much fun as the kids on the cover of things like slip and slides & board games 😂😂
You know Mr.beast
This is my kingdom come Shrek edition

Imagine ur comment getting pinned by mark rober
15:10, when you're piloting a drone in a VR headset, watching drone POV that a trashcan is coming at your physical location at mach 2....
Oh Jimmy is that you ?
I wonder if he could design the top or shape of the flask to play a certain note
I feel so bad for the environment
literally wasted 16minutes for that last shot... disappointing
I recon if you could put a nose cone on that thing you could send it into orbit! Send Elon Musk an E-mail 🤣
Dude he gave his wish of a quad to a kid who got his stolen? Im not crying you are…

What unit of measure is "the force you feel when you push against a fully inflated football?" What is that in psi??😖

The 20 Second Montage, is CORRECT!
14:58 in metric please?
Okay, Mark Rober. After the pandemic, build a theme park.

Jak by dzieci od friza to widziały to jest dopiero zanieczyszczanie środowiska
Not saying you can't do so, but not sure I would go with using Guinness to adjudicate records, their modern actions are questionable IMHO, especially considering their willingness to sell out for dictoral governments need for vanity
I always reach here in time
Aye do u guys know the guy who got the world record for highest "human" elephant toothpaste?
When one day is so fun that the rest of life seems bleak by comparison.
13:01 Ookayy now I get why it's called elephant toothpaste
Another reason why Thanos was better
I was so impressed dude
Oh, there's the lethamyr intro music in this. Nice
Only if I could live in this paradise
Did you used hydrogen peroxide??
4:11 Bigfoot?
I think your record is safe now
Banana for scale
It’s cool how he does it with kids going threw a hard time
Nice
I'm so glad that Brody's favorite color isn't purple, like mine is.
Ahora el Tomás, tienes más competencia:( ta difícil amigo
How much money did this take lol
imagine ur on plane and looking down sees this
Mr.beast did 100 mil orbeez innit?
What if life was just that easy. Yeah I’m just going to do all this hard work in just a 20 second build montage.
Wait your friends with Mrbeast
Mark Rober 12 years from now: “I dug a hole thru the earth”
My dream is to be in your video lol😂😂😅🤣
Me see dirt bike I see POV me 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
And now?
How are all the squirrels from your squirrel maze? Please make another vid on them! They are my fav videos!
The soil is f up...  pity the land owners
Mark rover, and nile red, and mr beast, should make an video together
We really have to see some more devils toothpaste experiments
The boring male empirically precede because cave intraoperatively permit amongst a knotty television. unsuitable, skinny package
The sequel everyone never knew they needed.
"The force inside the flask is about 50x the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football." Please stop with the inane comparisons.
13:00 save your time here
Commenting to please the algorithm to give more money to Mark
Ayyy ProleteR
Rick grimes????? 1:40
This was sooooooo cool!!!!!!!!
The camera shots in this episode are next level I feel. Great video!
As insane as this video was( from private jets to literally world records) those beautiful, happy montages and the camera work, really just made everyone's day better.
This looks absolutely insane
0:06 *bars*
Make it BIGGER
Childlike bliss, perfect vid
New challenge for @ManualDoMundo
Thats so 😎
He’s never gonna stop
Why is called elephant toothpaste
Shrek volcano
Mark Rober is proof of the goodness in humankind
You did it mark!!! You did it again!!!!!
Can i know flether's sister
Great what your doing Mark, keep it up!!👍😀
A Limbo?!?!
Elephant toothspace
Bless everyone of you guys who did this stuff for these kids, ALL of you.
I wish I have like a ATV to my birthday in October 18
Mark is one of the best people around we have currently. Hes not "faking" this. This is genuinely him and it's so great having someone like him to surprise these kids.
Thank you!
Excellent! This video kind of leads me directly to the question: How high can a flask like that go if it's built with the open end at the bottom?
imagine accidentally eating the orbeez lol
bro it was telling 2 years ago Imao
Imagine he got canceled on tweeter
While I’m jealous of the party, I’m *more* jealous of the pure joy he must have felt the whole day. The surprise, the world record, etc., it had to be one heck of a day! I’m no theist but even *I* would call Mark a saint
Me after I eat Taco Bell
Loved the video, happy for everyone, kinda bummed me out knowing I have never and will never have this much fun tho
Mission Passed Respect+
12:45 you’re welcome
Bro what if the orbeez goes into uranus
heart warming video!! <3
Your level of quality and attention to detail, added to your amazingly high compassion for others is just next level.
Every time I watch over fletchers video, it really brings me joy. Mark is dedicated to his community, and thats why I watch him.  Thank you for all you do! (:
Dude this channel is the most heart warming channel on the planet
You’re the most likeable person on this planet
This truly gives me hope for the world. That no matter what, we are people and can come together to do great things.
you should do a video where you explain what happens in a computer
That would be....... AWESOME
this is amazing, well done Mr. Rober
If only i could come
tell Brodie the fit is fireeee
The awkward high-5 thing at 14:13 was kinda funny
So cool. Great job
anyone else noticed the flask glass might have bursted in 13:15 ?
Leth is this u?
is that LETHS INTRO SONG
Mark and Jimmy are the Same...They do EXTREMELY CRAZY Stuff which LOOÓOOVVVVVEEEEE To watch...
I love how you show the amazingly fun side of science. ❤️
Yo, hearing that Brody used his one wish with Make-A-Wish to help someone else get a new ATV just made me insta-cry and believe in angels even harder.  He is too beautiful of a soul for this world!
using your only make wish to get another kid a atv that got his stolen, just wow, your a better and kinder person than 99% of people on earth
This is like the worst of the internet and the best of it merged.
Count the gallons then determine it
Mark.. he doesn’t have much but he gives much
So does the devils toothpaste react kinda like cotton candy - when water or saliva touches it it disintegrates is it like that ???
What would happen if someone was on the volcano while it was erupting?
I love this it's the best
Mark, next is the moon.
Thought this was king of random
I like how he's sponsored by Draft Kings...teaching kids to sports bet
What's the song playing around 6:20?
Who would downvote this???? Thanks for the wholesome content!!
You are one of the most wholesome and charitable people I know. I wish more YouTubers were like you Mark. Keep up the amazing work you do.
Thank you to @mrbeast for donating that awesome ATV, and to everyone else involved in this incredibly epic video. Seeing that kid and all his friends having the greatest time ever made my day. Thank you Mark for all that you do.
Anyone see that random drone at 19:43
im jealous
Mark I wish you went more into the science of doing this, like how you reinforced and why it works…
2020: save the planet by planting trees 2021: take a plane for a 1,5h drive
No clue how I got here. This is awesome
This is easily the whitest video I've ever seen. Also, how many more trees do you need to plant to make up for that private jet ride?
Now how do you clean it?
so this was in my suggestions for no apparent reason… and it did not disappoint. 10/10 honestly
I’m not sure what is meant at 13:44? Do you mean physically moving an inflated football? Because that doesn’t take much effort, even if multiplied by 50. Or do you mean using an air pump while the football is already fully inflated? Or catching the football? I don’t know, it just seems confusingly worded.
✨ Too easy ✨
Science fair gone wrong
this is their kingdom come 13:00
13:00 that sounds like ghidora from godzilla
POV: your searching if mr beast commented on this video
Do Elephants Actually use toothpaste ???
hi
Another masterpiece 🔥❤️
Mark,now the other kid won't feel special how rude!       Hahhahahhahahahahahahshs😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Sorry, I'm joking I was halfway trough the video when I said that
Nice dude
13:00 how it be after eating Taco Bell
hey my birthday is coming in at september 15th plus i love your vids
Nice job guys!!!
I wonder if the secret ingredient is potassium permanganate and very concentrated hydrogen peroxide
This is actually insane, well done
luv your vids
The first time you mentioned elephant toothpaste on your Chanel I was in 6th or 7th grade now I’m a softmore
Going to put this as my wallpaper 10:06
Fletchers sisters bad af
Are your gonna attempt it with devils toothpaste next year??
I would try devils toothpaste next
I love how the drone revving up to climb and get the moving shot makes it sound like an elephant trumpet😂
Mark, I love your heart for people.  You are truly an amazing human being!
Make this a tradition
خرا بحياتكم الزربانيه
now do it with devils toothpaste
Is there a reason why Mark Rober’s videos always only feature white people?
The camera work is amazing
be careful, they're heroes
Fajrul wajib coba
this is so wholesome and i love it :)
I didn't stop smiling this entire video. I love this stuff, keep doing this type of thing. You and everyone involved are easily some of the best people this world has.
Only America can create so much pollution for entertainment.
This video made my heart so happy
7:36 that was smooth
He slowly is turning into mr beast
14:25 what if that was white?
Ok but who’s house did they just destroy with the devil’s toothpaste lol?
Every thing is possible at money
Spontaneous philanthropy is so underrated.
You should have made it white XD
Me after I eat Taco Bell
c:
Did you take forever to clean it up?
What a fun video
13:11 Who else wanted it to go over the frame ?   Asking for a friend.
My dude fletcher out here in the same shirt and everything. Wonder if it was intentional.
Alguem deveria pedir pro iberê bater esse recorde tambem
I fucks with the rocket league music
Imagine that with devils toothpaste
no one:  literally no one: mark rober: *spends a year on all awesome projects but only makes a 20 second build montage*
Just me or did anyone else hear the Lethamyr intro music @ 11:28
Alright.... how do I get in on something like this?
How to clean the mess?
This was wholesome
fletchers sister hmu
Does mark rober have a pilot licence?
14:38 this just really reminds of how Pompeii was burned that day because when the volcano erupted (Mount Vesuvius), the wind was blowing towards they city (Pompeii) that day
anyone else realise the lethamyr intro song??
You should make a TV show
Yfz450 that's a great quad
People who don't know the people they are helping are always so generous. But let it be their depressed cousin battling an addiction problem, and giving them 10$ for food that they MIGHT spend on drugs. That's just a little too much. 👍😐
Really, these should be our everyday influencers.
Ok so question what If the giant flask had a smaller hole would it have gone higher?
It’s not a skateboard ramp unless there’s a skateboard, those are just called ramps
Can't wait for him to rocket elephant toothpaste into Jupiter
This was such an amazing video
slo mo guys x mark rober would be so epic!
Isso é uma afronta  ao manual do mundo?
Did anyone else notice that the background music kinda goes along to the beat of colt 45
What a constant inspiration, there's so much negativity in this world and Mark just stands there like a super hero like "Not on my watch, check this out!" And suddenly I can't remember what had me feeling so upset about.
I don’t want this to sound too negative but this channel has gone from science/engineering with short family channel bits to family channel with short science/engineering bits
“I wanna hear option 2” “Are you sure it’s a Tesla!” Exactly Mark, a Tesla ain’t no RX7
this is the kind of content i needed to give me happiness
Didn't expect to see Nurk but glad I did.
Mark just robbed us with his awesomeness.
Getting the whole community to volunteer in this kind the way is a talent that only a few possess, that includes Mark Rober
Wholesome AF.
Mark rober is sooo coooool
I wish I could do more then like share and comment 😔
moral of the story: help people to get into a mark robers video
you dint DISCOVER devels TOTPAS U MORON UNDERSTAN
Mark when are you going to learn child labor will never work if they are given the chance to retaliate
Thanks for being an incredible human being and giving back so much
This was so cool 🤩 and your so sweet by making  people happy 😊 your like the nicest person ever
Devils toothpaste: Concentrated sulfuric acid
Mark is the best person in the world. Whenever I watch one of his videos like this it gives me hope for humanity
@ManualDoMundo
I'm a min in and I love the kid, does he have a patreon or something I can donate too to help his cause?
This will definitely be on Daily Dose of Internet
Mark rober
It would've been cool if the last Experiment had a mix of orange and red to look like laba
The whole video I'm thinking "... but that kid gave away his ATV!!" And then at the end of the video, you did what I was thinking of doing. Bless you :)
As an Elementary School art teacher, my students always ask if I have a favorite YouTuber and I always tell them it’s you Mark.
If he had used devils tutepaste in that big thing omg
Total amount spent?
NURK FPV WAS THERE!!
The devils toothpaste is ✨ chunky ✨
Thanks mark rober! Not only have you helped my life. But my son with autism loves your videos and it’s helped a lot. Keep them coming!
what a white entertainment
Am I the only person who wants a mk 3, maybe with a cap on top to let pressure build up before it blows? Great video!
Mark puts so much work into his videos. Thank you sir. All of your videos are great. Glad I found them.
Didn’t this already air a while ago? I’m so confused 😂 I know I seen this! Or did you do it again?
Is it environmental friendly experiment 🙄
so now the kid doesn't have the record anymore...
I’m supposed to be studying for my biology test
Great video!
‘
is this guy ok? 14:19
Thingy thing
Ooooooohhh so fomie
When life gives you Elephant toothpaste.....be Mark Rober
Thank you
Hi
Idea: giant sink with devil’s toothpaste
Teenage boys when they're home alone: 13:11
You have struggled a lot to do this,  But, I can also feel the struggle of the team which cleans it!
He is so humble. Amazes me every time.
POGGGGGG
Nobody: Mark Rober: when life gives you a world record you break it 1000 times
Let’s help more white people. Sure
And how you clean all that mess?
the best the best people are the one that could have been the worst but decided not to
I love how instead of just building it and testing it after you want to throw a party and have it there to make someones day! Thats really cool and i love how much you care!
why does mr beast always look tired and stone simultaneously?
The utopian ox possibly kiss because television atypically stain on a  flippant great-grandmother. handsomely, husky size
Fletchers sister kinda cute
Nothing compares to that feeling when the kids are happy. You made an AWESOME work. Hope everything you made for him, backs to you by x100
I feel bad for that guys house.
I swear i remember watching this a few months ago
It is so nice to see so many people come together for such a heartwarming event
12:45 Is when the thing happens.
Fantastic job
Wait, devil’s toothpaste is flammable? Truly is the devil’s toothpaste.
11:18 confused me so much, I thought a Lethamyr video started in another tab for some reason.
15 times a football? What kind of units are those?  So normal football 12-13 psi gets you around 190 psi in the flask. That's impressive given the open top and volume. Devils toothpaste in the flask next?
this is a dope video
mark and jimmy is the only reason humanity still has a chance
Mr beast got a worthy opponent
@Mark Rober Mark can you possibly look into plastic eating worms
Wow!
9.6m views in 2 days, i’d say that thats a poggets number
This is possibly the best video I will ever see in my entire life. 🤩😍
Let me guess, the "generous benefactor" who owns the jet was Mr.Beast?
Seems about white
That was Mr meeseeks ooohhhh yeeeeah 14:05
No way
Who else skipped to the end?
Yo I’m a Brody
12:37 Hi Fletcher.
I just like the 1st generation toyota tundra with the plate steel winch bumper in the pink volcano video sitting beside the thing with 3 blue barrels in the bed of the truck...
Nah but iva pretty cute tho
What goes around comes around.
Great vid
12:54
How long did it take to make the volcano
Mark you are amazing. This is wonderful! My boys are jealous!! Wish I could do that for all 4 of them! 🤯🤯😂😂
Marks reaction at 4:20 thoo
I have a question
Mark is the best!
Wowwwww🤩🤩
Oh that’s why they call it elephants toothpaste, that’s the first time I’ve heard the sound , 13:03
why
Stan can you grab me a beer
why does he look like bugha
So, how much pressure was exerced on the walls ?
this guy is built different
The "green era"! Hahahaha...
mr beast is a scammer.
Am I the only one who noticed all the screaming sounded like an elephant?🤣
This guy thinks legendary
Me vibing to lethamyrs music in the back
Awsome video as usual. Very cool
How cool is Mark Rober!!!! That’s an obvious rhetorical question aha we need more people on this planet like this guy… Spreading so much happiness and making already cool science and engineering that much more incredible!! Here’s to you Mr.Rober 👍🏻
Now I feel jealous of the kids that live in his neighborhood
I have been waiting so long for this video
Blowing money .
Respect 🙏
his sisters cute 😹😹
mark lost his voice from this
I just want to say thank you to Mark and thank you to all those people who helped put that together. I’m sure he will never ever forget it. Probably the coolest thing he’s ever done.
It's amazing how he manages to post ever month and ever time it's awesome and quality
insane.
ahhh elephant toothpaste
You are an incredible human being Mark Rober!!
*KISSES ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE EVEN THOUGH ITS STEAMING*
Your so smart
I just want to say one thing                    .                 .            ... E
Many orbeez were harmed in the making of this video
How long did it take to make the draft king orbe part?
pog
Amazing
What's 14 football pressure in real units?
mark rober mars rover
this is the wholesome youtube we all need
Life is unfair.
I bet those birds lost their minds!
New music would make this video so much better.
Mark you are a true legend. Great standup guy.
Heart me lel
😊
I like this😃
Anyone else notice lethamyr’s intro music
he did it :D yay
Your videos are the best ART
Archaeologists in 2,000 years be like, "People in the 21st Century had some weird practices involving giant funnels, such as this remnant here. We hypothesize it was used for religious reasons."
Why does fletcher look like the son from blended
Worlds tallest thing that nobody has ever cared about
ive done it
16:11 We’re not gonna act like we didn’t see this now are we
Great video
This is one of those people/channels where you are like ..ehhh everyone else is doing it sooooo.
I named my mudkip after you in my nuzlocke
Another world record I see
You broke another world record
Brody is such a cutie
What an amazing kid
Rober you’re a Muuuufuggin G bro!! You are such an awesome roll model for these kids
Mark rober is the mr beast of science
Out of his budget? He just hired a whole town to do this video lol.
For any non-American bros, 50 fully inflated footballs is approximately 45 bar
Best videos ever!!
Make one with devil’s toothpaste
When I opened the video, it went from 9.4 m views to 9.5
Darn those food coloring manufacturers and their new ingredient.
Easily one of the best Youtubers of all time
the devils toothpaste formula is the new coke
WHat a great guy
Commenting
4:12 it may just be the pyro in me, but that sound it made is beautiful
How did u get over 600k IN LIKE 2 DAYS
That’s a cleanup
My apartment is only up to 23 stories and I live on the 16th…
David Dobrik wathcing this just so he can make a bigger one
Amazing! So much dedication to your vids!
No one will ever beat that!!!
Glad you gave him such an amazing and well deserved time! You truly are a one-of-a-kind person
mark is that one uncle that buys you an ice cream when your mom doesn't allows you
i wish i was related to this guy
I dont wanna ruin the mood. But why did he bring his friend Gavin if he thought it was a purely medical day?
Somebody cutting onions in here? Such a wholesome video
You are just a genius I feel like you went to Harvard
it'll be a dream to be related to mark
Next year: Making a missile and blowing up space but it only uses mentos
how did you clean it?
toothpast
is the catalyst for the devil's toothpaste nitric acid? (I've watched NileRed's video about nitric acid and related it to the burning glove scene)
The cleaner: 👁👄👁
Fletchers sister is smokin
12:50
When Moses went down and saw what the people had done, and realised it was Mark Rober who led them, he said, "Huh. Neat."
tell me you have too much time, and money, without telling me...
Yeah, but what do I do with the flask after that? I have neighbors.
Yessss sir Alvin Kamara norcross baby 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
11:10 lethamyr intro sorng either incomng or started
12:46 the moment you came for. Thank me later.
80 TONS?
I think this video is just proof that experiments take a long long time to perfect. Even if they are successful the 1st time it's not gonna be a 100% you're best If you can find a way to make it better
I swear he’s spent 40 years of his life since 2017
Oh s*** here we go again
EVery Rocket League player hearing it: Waaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiitttttt..!?!?
5TONS?
But what if they choose option one in the Tesla lol
Mark Rober, one of the most wholesome individuals on the planet.
Bfd
How can you NOT afford a private jet
please do something else. this is boring
Love the Afroman Colt 45 remix song in the background!!
I was fine... until I tried to describe to my wife what Brody did with his wish... then I was a puddle of tears...
Why elephant toophpaste tho?
4:28 is that concentrated nitric acid I see?
Mark Rober is so smart
In a way, Mark Rober is everyone's best uncle.
Me at 3am…….13:11
Ultimate stupidity.
I know its the drone but when the experiment goes off it really sounds like an elephant.
Much love ❤️
I just want to be a kid again :((
The flask leaked a little
aye bruh fletcher sister kinda bad😅
He said private jet and I was like “🤨”
Your an amazing human being Mark. Much love and many blessings to you and your family. 🥰❤
Look at these white kids having the time of their lives lol
XD
What a wholesome and awesome video!
wait a second is this a re upload? i’ve seen this video before this is so weird
This video was loaded with badass ideas
so next you can build a "flask" meant to be launched?
Why did you quit NASA?
Beautiful video..
who edited this video becasue its amazing
What is the music at 2:30
That one guy who only has friends younger then him
Idk why i realized this just now but i subconsciously like every video I've clicked on for the last couple of months😂
So is this going to be a yearly thing?
interesting
Omg all the warm Fluffy feelings of goodness
I want to… eat it.
Wow
Again?
Mark, you are truly the kindest person ever ♥️♥️
The cinematography during the pool time was FABULOUS
1:56  “Child labor” 😂
Someone is going to find the formula for devils toothpaste
OMG sorry I'm late!!!
that had potential to take this is my kingdom come to the next level
Everyone who helped with this creation are all beautiful humans
First, Ride a tesla Second, Ride a private jet  Third, Ride a limousine
Thisnis why aliens wont contact us
I'm not crying, you're crying!
The kid :(
9:55 My stomach after taco bell
8
Mark Rober is the nicest YouTuber I have ever watched in my whole life no thought about it he just makes my day every time I watch him and Mark if you see this keep it up your channel is in my favorite
Noice
that purple food coloring scares me
I noticed this small thing, Not sure if its a coincidence but Mark used the same exact time-lapse music Mumbo Jumbo used to use. Coincidence? I think not!
jeez, at 13:18 you can see that it's till not perfect and that some of the mixture was releasing pressure and getting between the cracks
marks video ideas are like "ayo remember in 5th grade? Wanna quadruple it?"
Rest of the world: uses the metric system  America: 13:44
2:13 looks like a rust base 😂
I loved this
AHHH ACID SPREAD EVERY WHERE
ok but whos is sister
Glados would be “proud” of the devils toothpaste
Hate to be the party pooper but is this stuff okay for the environment?
Make more videos
10:11 cheeto
Insane
My question is who’s house did you destroy with the devils toothpaste AHAHAHA
Music is Faidherbe Square by Proleter.
Made me smile the whole time. Amazing gesture, you are great people. Keep up the kindness
Thanks for making the world a better place, Mark 🙂🙂
Nice job on your extra uncle point
Do you have a Sister or a brother
Must be nice to be a millionaire
This is my kingdom cu-
WoW  Top !!   :  )
I like to think of rober as that cool uncle that has big celebrations and cool things
Cleaners be like: 👁👄👁
That boys mother sure does care about his education... (Yes, I'm quoting Forrest Gump.)
Video's like these give me faith in humanity again
What is want to know is. . .where did they get that big pool slide????
Make this a yearly traditon, one upping yourself everytime
I’m going to be nice person so many one day I can get a Honda  foremen esp es
what if he did it with devil's tooth paste
Well I can say, I have an pretty sure I figured out at least one of the chemicals he uses in devils toothpaste, and I have a decent idea of what else he used,  I ain’t gonna say it though as I respect his wishes to keep it unknown, it should be rather apparent though. And I am rather surprised he can get it to be safe to walk on after it has been reacted.
"Generous Benefactor"  aka probably Mr. Beast.
im Subbing
I love what you do to these people because they deserve this
I remember my awkward hat fitting phase. Adult hats too big & kids too small xD
Brody seems like an Awesome kid and it is so selfless that he gave up his make a wish gift to give a gift to another kid  it’s Awsome y’all did this and my prayers are with him and his family
So cool!
The uncovered pvc univariately separate because birth really unite qua a defective beam. miniature, glistening glorious straw
Me Saying what Mark said in the video to my teacher Teacher: Why are you still in fourth grade?
Did the elephant toothpaste made an elephant noise?!
mark rober is mr beast smarter.0
I don’t cry too often but this video made me so happy I almost started to tear up
12:50 if you wanna see the elephant toothpaste tower snd not sit through 13 min of vid just to see this, your welcome
that town is like something out a movie
*Your a part of my childhood now*
Yeah but what is your opinion on Autism Next and electroshock behavior therapy Mark? What with your wonderful child and his autism.
some say there is only one best day of the year i disagree it come around 12 times predicted by marks upload schedule
One of the best videos I have watched this Year !!!!
Hum
11:15 Shoutout to Lethamyr’s intro
What happens when you flip the flask over? new video idea maybe????
imagine have a party like that for your birthday. that would be epic
Wow just wow no other words
Bravo, class act
All this time and energy and money couldve went to building homes or somthing useful but nope in a capitalistic nation like the US you get foam bullsh>/
nice
this a nice video made those kids summer probably
What a constant inspiration, there's so much negativity in this world and Mark just stands there like a super hero like "Not on my watch, check this out!" And suddenly I can't remember what had me feeling so upset about.
The private benefactor was probably Mr.Beast. Also I could be wrong but the devils toothpaste is a violent decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide to create hydrogen gas trapped in soap that is why it floats away and is very flammable. Love the videos and both you and Mr.Beast are more then we deserve.
I saw you on one if mr.beast’s vids
Mark was more excited than the kids.... when hard work pays off
And I thought my sonic birthday was epic
Find yourself someone who loves you as much as Mark Robert loves elephant toothpaste
The Drone shots were..... 😘😘😘
Have you ever considered building a massive cloud chamber? They are really cool and can give an inside look into the universe at large
Marvel : Infinity War is the biggest crossover Mark Rober: Brody and Fletcher is tottaly bigger.
Elephant SNOT
In the future, he will probably do an elephant toothpaste tsunami.
Would it go higher if the container was smaller because there would be more pressure
I'm a big fan of the interesting results
i wisg\h i had that much fun somewhere in my life .
Fletchers sisters @
It's about f*ckin' time fellas
How do you clean this up???
i wanna know Fletcher as my friend because i have the same hair
can i ask, where is your son
13:02 I wondering why it was called Elephant toothpaste and now I know ☺️
fun fact: you want to be in mark robers family
A video that must be watched at 1080p, that was amazing!
#5 after 2 days? Nice
The best part is the fact the background music says owwy umpa owwy umpa
This was so heartwarming to watch. Stay strong Brody!
So the steel flask is 10,000 pounds
Is life even worth living if I know I will never have as much fun as Mark Rober
Where was I when this happened?
When you haven't seen your gf for more than 3 days
Awesome vid dude!
Hi kid!!
This is amazing great job mark, and also all the other kids and people that helped.
If only Red and Blue food coloring made purple.... Awesome video and Party Mark!
12:50 the whole point of the video
Ok so you know how Markie Robertson said that "thankfully it didn't take off like a rocket this time"? So like, what if you did want it to take off like a rocket? Flip that sucker upside-down, load it with knockoff RP-1, and let it fly! Upvote button 👇if you think the same
DOn't like the sponser
Manual do Mundo desliked It!
Me hearing lethamyrs intro music: 😯
Nice vid I love it
I love mark rober
I love what you do keep going 🥰🥰
Do you think if you tried hard enough you could run across the orbi pool
Mark Rober is literally everyone's dream uncle  rober
i haven't smiled like this in a while...
It is weird to see an adult play with a bunch of kids.
I ain't cleaning that up - Berta
*That would be my dream birthday.*
It's getting down on trending day by day...
Mark Rober you are an amazing and wonderful human being. Thank you for all the wonderful entertainment you give us. ❤️
Wasn't shot into space. It was shot into the air. And congrats you just wasted your life with elephant tooth. Ps your parents are not proud of you.
12:51 when u ate 3 taco bell
I'ma bout to bust
I have a question is elephant toothpaste bad for the envioirement
13:00
Imagine homeless watch this video
I become a nerd whenever you upload:)
When life gives you life get a life.
How much money do you actually get for these videos??
This might be the most wholesome video on the internet!
Marc Rober engineered his kind- and  greatness very well
NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! BUILD A ROCKET POWERED BY IT
I think playing with normal elephant toothpaste is not fun anymore after watching this😂
Science is fun!
Science is fun!
Now imagine this but with devils tooth paste
Science is fun!
I was watching ur vids when u were at 800k
Wait, can you make a tiny or medium rocket from It? it's looks strong enought to lift a rocket.
With 12 videos per year I hoped for more scientific, meaningful topics for your videos
The red elephant toothpaste was giant crushed hot chetos
Acho que o manual do mundo vai ter que tentar denovo
now do it in space
I wonder if the Brazilians will come up with something to go higher 😄
13:15 crazy it went out of frame,so much power there. If you were standing over that would it be deadly?
MORE!! *BIGGER!!*
Mark you have motivated me to try and do everything and anything possible to make the world a better place. In this vast universe we have nothing but each other ♥️ unity for the world 🌎
now that’s what i call a chemical reaction
This looks like so much fun! I wish I was there
5:01
MY NAMES BRODY MEAN XDDD
looks like lava to be honest 10:02
Imagine going inside it
i thought i started watching a Lethamyr vid for a second... iykyk lol
if I were a billionaire I'd be doing this stuff for Make-A-Wish kids..not flying me and my other billionaire friends into space.
Obviously you werent worried about it setting on sore if you did that infront of a house
Alright kids clean that up!!
Okay but what if you designed one to take off like a rocket
How many people almost drowned?
Soon
Like... It's nice and all, don't get me wrong but... Those chemical are certainly bad for the environement and you just dumped a lot in grass... And the "rince" it with water... So all the "bad chemical" goes into the water underground...
This is what elon musk needed to go to mars
Id love 2 lay down and angle the camera so Itll look like Im destressing my toothpaste out!!
"This is my kingdome come"
Can you do a devil's toothpaste version
😍😍😍😍
Hchxhc Bvbhg
I have nothing but respect for you
mark u cant be stealin the leth intro like that 11:45 @lethamyr
24.K
The only Rocket League players really know the track playing while they were playing in orbes pool.
So awesome

All that work for something so ridiculous lol
F to fletcher who lost his record
This is so unfair

That lethamyr music tho 👀👀👀
Now the world it’s a better place  Thank you 🙏
YES
Can you do something for my birthday on September 11th  please please please 🙏
Its kinda funny that these people spent so much time and energy just to spew toxic chemicals into the atmosphere.
if u used a skinnier nozzle it would go highwer
1:33
@mrbeast
Mark, you are a true 🇺🇸 American hero
Wow amazing, now double it lol
Even with the added reinforcement to the flask, you can still see the sheer pressure of the mixture finding every little gap in the structure.  Pause around 13:19
Let’s gooo
Next year got a kid a world record and party because his world record got stolen by a kid who gave his make a wish gift to a kid whose atv which was his make a wish gift got stolen
Video made for children sponcered by draft kings………hahahahaha
7:29 I cant stop hearing “Wario mad”
I hope whoever stole his ATV has both sides of his pillow warm at all times.
This guy knows how to party
Not to be rude but.... HOLY SHOT
Another reason to hate purple dye
This drone pilot had to be Nurk... those shots are incredible
Tu madre cuando
Beautiful video, as always
13:29 when it’s December
This is so big that it made me watch the sponsor
Somewhere out there, there are elephants with cavities
thank you Mark
Engagement to help push those analytics.
WOOOOOOO
WHY DOES HE CHOOSE SUCH BANGER SONGS FOR HIS VIDEOS, THIS WHOLESOME GUY HAS THE BEST MUSIC TASTE OUT OF ALL YOUTUBE.
Wasted potential
Now make a pool that’s about 100 meters big and make a reaction so large.
You’re insane mark!
Imagine going to your birthday party and not knowing anybody😂
When Taco Bell realizes: Hey I might go get all of the menu two times
Rule number 1 about child labor: don't unionize them.
How bout a toothpaste rocket
Is that me
Tbh having a life threatening condition doesn’t sound bad anymore
Trying to lift yourself with 1999 balloons
Start uploading in 2160p please
12:46
Mark you're a great person
50 times more pressure than your foot hitting a ball? Ok guess I'll go google how much pressure there is when you kick a ball so I can get a quantifiable figure here, I'm curious how many PSI was in that thing.
That's really nice he gave his wish to another kiddo. Well done Mark. Your videos are always inspiring, genuine, and full of heart.
Anybody noticed the structure he made looked like gemini spacecraft?
This is even more awesome than the last time. Question, am I crazy or did I still see small leaks at the corners?
so can you you fuse devils and elephants toothpaste?
When you use your new toothpaste for the first time after having an overused one :
Wholesome
Okay now who’s cleaning all that up
What an epic and action filled video, Thank you for all you do @MarkRober and all the smiles you create 😀 You truly are a treasure on YouTube
I love it
Love everything about this
You shoulda put a mannequin inside tho but other then that if we would be rating out of 10 it would be a 10
Took you 12 minutes to get to the actual content lmao.
whos brody
You & Jimmy  (Mr Beast) Currently Make The Best Content On YT
Mark all I want to say is your the person that always goes beyond and  ahead of science and you a very intelligent and inspiring person you do so much for people and we need more people like you. And you are a very inspiring person to me. Thank you for the video you make and NEVER GIVE UP ON SCIENCE.
You did a great thing here!!   All involved should be proud of what you did.  Thank you for doing this!
❤❤❤
Am I the only one thinking of the military applications of this
Anyone watch lethamyr lol
Anyone else notice lethamyrs intro song?
cool
It’s only a matter of time before the first elephant toothpaste nuke is made
Yo what would happen if you put devils toothpaste in the massive flask i feel like you would have to get it hink its called the nfa to clear the skys for you because that devil tooth paste is going to space lol
next video suggestion:Elephant toothpaste Mars!
Iberê, corre aqui!
Where is a banana for scale?
His devil toothpaste formula is like rick's dark matter fuel formula.
12:44 wat was dat
i was so happy for the entire duration of this video
That was awesome!
This was amazing! Never would've guessed I would be so intrigued to soap, hydrogen peroxide and sodium iodide.
Nice job on toxifying the land
Devils toothpaste is just elephants but with a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Like 50%
HE KNEW IT WAS A LIMBO
i just love how when Mark gets really excited, his voice cracks every other second XD
1:56
Imagine being inside the toothpaste volcano..
When one of the kids goes under the surface of the pool and u get 150 assist points:
Who wants to bet that someone from r/cursedcomments is gonna ruin the wholesome moment?
Very cool
Happy Birthday Brody
the tallest....not the largest
GRRRR the chiefs will win this year
Still didn't beat mr beast
HAHA YESSSSS
Excellent video, but you see trading crypto currency required more than just a primary knowledge to trade with a crypto currency, it is adviceable to trade with an expert to avoid unnecessary losses.
I hope whoever was holding that gloves didn’t get hurt
Big props to Mark and everything but the townspeople were something else! What great people really going out to help. Faith in Humanity is restored everytime I see one of your videos, Mark!
Not one person of color.
😢 overwhelming happiness
Mark. You are SO SMART and an inventer/engineer. You have resources and are connected. As much as I enjoy your random stuff why not put your mind towards coming up with alt energy sources or other ways of cleaning the planet etc. we kinda need people like you atm. Just a thought.
7:43 "This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come"
The production of this video tho
hold on..MR. BEAST?!
Mark do the virgin galactic
9:59 forbidden cheese
Very Cool.
Hey mark nice 👍🏻 one. Thank you for everything. I have an idea 💡. What if we flipped the flasks or put it on the side. Will it launch?
What If the aim was to launch the largest rocket using Devils toothpaste?
13:11 This is what schools think what will happen when boys see a centimeter of a girls shoulder
Who is cutting onions in here?
Mark Rober is a totally righteous dude
I love how sweet this episode is. 💞
Doing something fun while doing something nice.
Mark rober my parents want to move to a house that has a pool can you make us a pool please 3,6 feet
É Iberê Thenório tu tem novos adversários.....
Youtubes Compression being like, No Thanks
Noice video
I have never seen a town more apocalypse ready than this one
I appreciate his hard work into making this video and the nice things he did to Brody 😊
"50 times the force of a football." 13:40  ~ America
Mark Rober is the irl representation of a gigaChad
I have a tough time organizing a simple pool party...
Ayo fletchers sister kinda bad
David Dobrik has to break another record again
Those drone shots are INSANE. Best YouTube video ever
👍🔝💪💪👊🇺🇲🇩🇪🇺🇲🇩🇪🥨🍺
How many of these are you going to make… make more I like it
Hi
David Dobrik crying rn
I love the idea of someone from the food coloring company purposefully adding yeast into the purple food coloring just to mess with you.
Definitely the cooles uncle
i love this video
Absolutely fantastic! Great job, Mark
fletcher’s sister is so pretty
12:56 relax! no need for thanks
Congratulations
That montage was 30 secs
LOL HE MADE KIDS WORK XD
Now I have a pretty cool uncle but like, this just isn't fair
I really appreciate this video, it is such a wholesome piece of content and shows how much generosity and joy humans are capable of.
All of you are so awesome!!!!! Keep up the great work guys
Awesome video!!
Whos before 9mil views i am
Science is fun! Glad you were finally successful in mastering the design!
What the dog doin?
"Lifted a 1 ton flask 5ft into the air" *and caked a truck*
This is what it looks like polluting the surrounding areas with this abundance of chemicals and ruin land for views and a world record.
Brody looks like Bugha
Mark say hi to nurk for me :)
mark rober? mark rover
Where was I in this party lol looks fun
Ok but, devil’s toothpaste rocket??
Watching the video minding my own business then notice the song playing during the orbee’s swimming pool is Lethamyr’s intro song
this is so beautiful, loved to see fletcher again as well, it makes me believe that mark doesn't only do this for his videos but that he is just the kind of kindhearted person who would do something like this because it makes someone else happy
Now the real question is, how big would it have to be to reach orbit? :D
He literally said, "chase this rocket scientist " and beat himself 👏🏾🤝🏾🤙🏾
This was the best video youve ever done! Science and Fun are inextirpable!!! Congrats on the World Record!
I just love his determination to when continuing previous projects
Keep looking boys we gotta find who Tf cares
It's always amazing to see these kinds of things done for people struggling, but it's even more amazing to see a community come together and do something like that. I hope to be able to be a part in putting something like this together someday
All these people are great people
12:45
Awesome
Cinematography is low key amazing
I love your videos and the motivation behind them. Still sometimes I feel like you are missing the point. It shouldn’t only be about impressing kids what you can do with science but also about showing kids what science is telling us to do. For example not flying around with a private jet for 1 1/2 hours even though it might be fun.
I'm pretty sure everyone "HERE NOW" is here for this epic  Epic FINALE
13:01 to it low-key kinda sounded like an elephant
Imagine they forgot to record it and had to redo it
ok i need that dudes sisters snap
Pog
Wow
10:00 more like crispy crunchy spicy chicken suace
Props to the Foam Daddy
This is the best channel on YouTube and it isn’t close.
Big explodion
I wont be surprised if mark does this a 3rd year in a row next year
Mark Rober and mrbeast are the best duo ever, making earth a better place
He’s returned
E
if he's my uncle... i would be very proud
So awesome!!!! Goes the extra mile and then some =)
Alright, Mark is the goat. Wish I had more to say but I think we can all agree on this!!!
Thank you for ur uplifting content! I needed this today :)
what i wanna see is what happens if you put devils toothpaste in the flask. lmao
Great job
anyone else think the "HUMAN" with the red arrow and circle were so unnecessary lol no offense to mark
amazing video, that's all i can say :D
best message at the end
This was so wholesome this warmed my heart
Nice use of resources
this video's title has a new sentence each word
YOO HIS SISTER A BADDIE
12:46 for those not bothered
I bet the cleanup was fun
Mark is living his life keep it up 👍
The 20 second montages song sounds like "ahhhhm mister king dice"
what schools think boys will do whenever they see a girls shoulder 12:58
Thanks for making me cry at the end there Mark. I need it Lol
Mark is most definitely one of the most kind hearted people on Youtube. Definitely always watch his content because its just pure fun and filled with joy.
I wish I was there haha
Cant help but smile at these vids, gives me a little more faith in humanity :)
Get trololled
Oh my lord how do you even clean all that up?? Would love to see that scientific process lol...
I think I saw some orbies fly out of the elephant toothpaste xd
Here I am sitting in my room all day every day..
Imagine this guy being your best friend
O.o
mark rober: so theres this boy- MrBeast: Chris how much money do we have in the budget! Chris: *turns around* YES
Hey mark rober! I love the vids your probably the smartest person I’ve ever heard of! Your so cool and I also can’t BELIVE you collided with mrbeast!
I love this that's what beautiful
Oh Mark. I wish I could give you a big hug. Your heart knows no bounds. Truly a light in these times. Thank you.
Bruh played lethamyr's theme during the orbeez pool lmao
now we just need to see this with the devils toothpaste catalyst
white people be like
12:50
He's making all these stuff for fun but what will he build for a zombie apocalypse
I'm guessing the conc NH3 that was pourd on the gloves is not, the "secret ingredient."
Yep
Title misleading: Actually Hulk blowing up
Wow this was emotional you are a nice human
this kid will go far in life. I wish him the best
That’s what that was in the distance
Where did the house come from
I wish I could be friends with Mark Rober
That kid had to of had the best day of his life
Amazing I’ve been watching you forever
That was really great of them but hear me out... I think that the money that went into that could have been put to better use if it was just straight up given to the family :/
12:50 you're welcome
Lethamyrs Intro music anyone?
Giving is the greatest gift! 🥰
Hells Yeah made respect for what you do for people
Mark is that one uncle everybody loves lol
Great video as usual 👌 👍 👏
Crazy to watch this and think where will we be when legends like Mr beast mark rober dies it's kinda deep
Now... With devils toothpaste.
mark and jimmy are definitely two of the nicest humans on youtube.
Anyone else come for science and stay for Ila aye I'm a geek but daaaaaang
You crazy son of a b****  you did it
You need to do the same thing but with devils toothpaste
22 second building montage not 20!
id probably want this guy to be my science teacher
those drone shots are mad
It only gets better!
11:29 ahh yes new lethamyr video out
More white privilege.
@12:50
Your channel used to be so much more explanatory and more science based... Now it's doing the same as The King of Random and setting aside the science for the "cool factor"...
This title looks like something a person having a stroke might write, but interesting video lol
Hey he managed to not diss the townspeople for being conservative this time!
How do you even properly get rid of this stuff?
Omg this looks so fun
love you mark <3
Why can’t everyone be a mark rober?
What kind of human being steals a make a wish kids ATV?
You totaly did a captain disilusion there :P
pog town
Probably one of the coolest things I ever seen
Imagine if he was your dad...
Gotta be so nice to be able to live that life or to just be able to have 1 day in that life.
Always dope to see you visit our little town! Wish I would've heard I would've loved to help and see this go down
IBERÊ CORRE AQUI
I did not know that Mr. Beast was your friend, but I guess everyone is your friend. ;)
fletcher sister fine asl what’s her @
Wow! It only took 12 months
Mark is officially the most kind YouTube ever

No invention ever made will beat a memory that will last a lifetime!   Awesome memories made here Mark.  Bravo!
protect the environment they said
His "ongoing" quest to be the favourite uncle
Lets just take a minute to appreciate the breathtaking cinematography
GG Mark Rober
It is nice to see mr beast anwser mark calls 😂😂
The drone shots look like the quantum realm in antman
12:50
Mark Rober doing his best Captain Disillusion impression at 3:42 😀
Invite me next time
Surprised how richs spend so much money
Ok, so this dude brought in 2 disabled kids and gave them the day of their lives. How do i like twice?
Awww, that was heartwarming.
bet this is really bad for the nearby environment
This video made it onto CNN 5 Things
f Manual do Mundo
Where minorities not allowed in the celebration? There wasn't a single one in the entire video lol.
Feel like all his videos are them same now.
The birds in the sky were the experiment  went off 👁👄👁
12:37 hehe, hi :)
What was the music at 2:32 ?
At this point I'm wondering who uses more money mr beast or mark on videos
I appreciate you not click baiting
Manual do Mundo also tried these method with soda and mentos on the ground and nothing happend...
😅🤣😂 I feel sorry for your neighbors  BUT I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!!
Yup
How long did it take to clean it all up?
Mark, the best Editer, and Drone flimer.
Brody is who I hope to be given half the chance
Dude, you are a Legend. Heaven definitely gonna have a VIP room waiting for you.
Foam Daddy 😏😩
So much for 6 feet apart..
This is amazing!!
Well done, Mark Rober. Bravo! You just earned a subscriber!
How do you clean all this toothpaste up?
Draft kings weren't the only sponsor, aka Mr beast as well
No one is better than this guy
I am going to try to figure out how to make devils toothpaste, since I am working on being a chemist.
L
Sure soon to be parents are taking note for the gender reveal.
You are amazing. n_n Thank you for doing these videos!
What a constant inspiration, there's so much negativity in this world and Mark just stands there like a super hero like "Not on my watch, check this out!" And suddenly I can't remember what had me feeling so upset about.
That's quite the party. Probably close to $100k in labor and materials
50x the force of pushing against a fully inflated football? Lol what? Is that supposed to be the most relatable stat you could come up with?
Some footage is spectacular
This Was So Cool 💯 Love What You Do Since Nasa Till Now For This Kids 🤓🤓 You Rock 🎸 🤘🤘
They all volunteered?? That's really impressive
Now that is art
13:13 *Achievement Get* Sky's the Limit
I love mark because he makes people happy and he lets them have fun
That’s cool, these are like Nelk videos but for middle schoolers lmao
You truly are a legend and inspirational
Me: What's that noice?? outside my window 13:12
This is literally so amazing. I got so mad when you said his bike got stolen- also Brody reminds me of tubbo for some reason 😅
Awesome! im from gridley
max level uncle
He's money 10000000💲 to   0
Mark must be the best children’s party host ever
Wow
12:38
At 12:52 me after taco Tuesday.
Holy cow that buetiful Devil tooth paste color green
Legend!!
Will you be able to grow plants on that soil again?
How did they clean the whole house
12:48
You did it!
ok, now clean it
The MarkRober Experience
Would be cool to see this reaction with laminar flow at the outlet. Wonder if that can be achieved with such a violent reaction 🤔
Mark you're a real gift to YouTube community, especially during this pandemic.😊
12:47 is my fave part..
foam powered space rockets coming up
mm scrambled eggs
Imagine if it was devil's thooth paste
Hi
Now I wanna be this kid
Mark you are amazing
It's only a matter of time until it would reach the Moon and aliens would think that's it's our "weapon"
12:43 anyone hear the whisper too?
12:50
no way
Guau
Ok now make a rocket out of it
You did this in gridly I wish i cold off seen it like 13 minutes away
That base didn't move at all. it was sooo high!
Anyone else find it really inappropriate for a channel like this to advertise draft kings?
Dayuuuum
Me after Taco Bell
o like his videos but this guy gives me the  " Look mom what i can do and noone else can" "i'm better then the neibour " vibes
You can’t really appreciate that view of how high the elephant toothpaste went, until you see it from the drones perspective.
12:35 you’re welcome
"The force inside the flask was about 50 times what you feel If you push against a fully inflated football."  I mean the video is amazing. But please i just wanted to know the number. Who knows what 50 footballs feel like?
I hope it's all biodegradable If not all that pollution
Mark "great job to everyone that came out to help! Now let's get this place cleaned up! " "Guys?!?!  Hey, where'd everyone go?" 😁  Seriously though, great job!
Can I get fletchers sisters snap
Bruh, Mark is pretty much Mr.Beasts long lost twin
13:44 Freedom measurements be like
hello hello we got a giant green blobby flare. oh that's mark rober. who. he's a youtuber. oh.
Why are his videos just filled with white kids and people where’s the color?
12:45
The best part is that there is not a single minority in this entire video
wonder how much he made on this video tho
Happy birthday, Brody!
this dude has money
I like mark rober but his vids are filled with white people
I wish this guy was my science teacher…
Why a blue quad? Not pink or purple? That is really hetero normative
12:50 to get to the point
How does this stuff affect the environment?
America has to stop
The elephant toothpaste was better that last year
12:45
what a mess
Love it when mark flips everyone off going down a water slide 7:28
Imagine if when it reached space and it stained the windshield of a UFO
12:57 the next day after eating spicy tacos :D
I know this has nothing to do with the video, but who else thinks Mark could almost pass as Ryan Reynolds twin? (Just me??)
All i saw is +1 uncle points, your a beloved uncle :)
The goat is back with another banger 👍🔥🔥
Ima build this 1 inch taller and see who laughs then!
What a legend
Mark deserves everything that comes his way. He is just amazing.
I want to be a youtuber and calab with you
Please stop having loud music on top of you talking (example at 1:43). It does not happen often but I find it to be a recurring thing in your videos and, while I enjoy the music, it makes it incredibly hard (for me) to listen to what you are saying!
Me after NNN
….. lmao XDDD
Hey mark pls can you make more vids with your son
The last one r I p the truck
Watch this become one of those videos people watch late at night instead of sleeping/studying
The elephant toothpaste is just a series now
😽
Lmao I hope you don't get demonized for that child labor joke XD.
That Leth intro music caught me by surprise ngl
Mr Beast is going to try and beat this
The flowers will be missed...
I’m happy he invited back fletcher from last year. Glad to hear he’s doing well
+
Saw the title and legit jumped xD
Amazing video mark
Use that same flask, but put devils toothpaste in it with a blowtorch on the edge of the rim like a flamethrower
That was amazing !
I hope that kid had a really fun day.
i keep thinking about that one kid who helped with the "largest elephant toothpaste" only for that title to be taken away multiple times
12:45 no need to thank me
Bro that was toooooo muchhhhhh 😂😂😂😂👍👍👍
You are the cool uncle kinda guy.
Houston we have a problem
Nicest dude ever
GIVE ME THE FORMULA FOR DT MARK
I just found this dude , he would have been so great for us when we were younger (mid 20s) , great energy , keeps the young audience really well entertained and amazing quality and editing in the video well done Mark.
These camera angles are awesome!
This is amazing! I love this video and the reaction of both the largest devils toothpaste and this one!
Ooh maybe I should try making one  Maybe a way smaller version tho
Why does 6.4 k people hate this
Here ya go #1 best uncle award 2021
12:51 You welcome
*When life gives you lemons... build a 5 ton flask and blast them to space.* - Mark Rober 2021
you know whats funny that my teacher from last year she used one of his videos about elephant  toothpaste for science lol
Mr. Beast as President and Mark Rober for VP✌
Too easy!
Thank you Mark.
all white town 💀
When I become an engineer Im going to beat your record well try I’ve been inspired by engineering for slog time and you just fueled my love for building things like this and all of your projects
I wish I could press the like button more times
What a great community of people to all help out. Bless them all :)
How sifficult was to clean the whole thing ?
Lol he dead
U should do a devils toothpaste one
Stevewilldoit would've bought that kid and his entire family Lamborghinis and Rolexes; Mr Beast....more like Mr Cheap.
13:41
Nice white pickett fence.  People must have spend a long time putting that in!  Go B Team!
12:53  me when your mom when when ur mom me when ur mom

Ok🤷‍♂️
“This is my kingdom come”
how to stimulate a local economy 101. .take notes people.
Why does this look like something from Phineas and Ferb
couldn’t you theoretically make it go higher by capping the top and releasing it a few seconds after the initial reaction?
I'm speechless.... wow I guess? I'm mind blowen! I'm crying!
"fOaM dAdDy"
Up next a birthday party where something normal happens and they have 7 kids over and have presents and cake that’d be cool
ah yes the best idea, to party in the middle of a pandemic /hj
Mark Rober breaks the internet again! Awesome video!
me wondering who the ... counted the orbies
This shows the true beauty of small town America
How do they clean it up? Or is that not necessary?
only bangers
Does anybody else cry when watching marks videos besides me
Amazing video mark!!!
Love the lifeguards
I can't believe this guy makes so much money for adding tons of chemicals into the environmental on video
Amazing video. Even more amazing kid.
No cap this guy is like mr beasts son
So cool!
Nice pollution
How much did this cost?
These people are the people who inspire me to be better in life.
Mark Rober - Restoring Faith in Humanity one video at a time!!!
Lfl
That’s cool and all, but can I use it to launch my friends like a clay pigeon and yell “pull”
Pog
mark rober has just been becoming a professional party planer
At 2:33 when the best YouTube music song started I started nodded my head with some much fun memories, thank you for that nice momemt
Wait did he give the formula
sir why do you use eminem's backround music that i believe is from "the real slimshady" or whatever
I always love these videos. I am curious though, what’s the environmental impact of the elephant’s/devil’s toothpaste? I’d love to do these types of experiments, but I’m not sure what the impact would be
The work involved to do this is simply insane, thank you Mark well done!!!
Me on december 1st
Very cool
Poison the earth some more
Those kids are living the dream
Was this a re-upload? yeah im sure i seen this a few years back.
Ya almost murk'd Nurk 😆
"have we gone mad?? have we gone mad?? have we gone mad?? have we gone mad?? have we gone mad??" 7:23 hint: listen to the music carefully.
Mark are you going to do it again with devil's toothpaste
Soon he is going to get a world record of having the most records
SO - MANY - ONIONS! ;) Well done all. :)
Mark knows how to properly entertain people. Yep. I'd rather meet him than win $1,000,000.
Mark why you use color GREEN?!! You'll know the consequence!!
Environmental pollution considered?
j hope i can be as happy as tis kid
When life gives you devils toothpaste or elephant tooth paste you know what to do
8:45 he gave away the formula
12:46  Thanks
Do it again but with a smaller exit making it go even higher
Wish I could brush my teeth in that
is that a colt 45 sample haha
the most unbelievable part out of everything in this video is that someone would pick Leonard Fournette over Alvin Kamara
Can I be your neighbour?
huge respect to what you are doing this was so awesome
I wanna use this elephant toothpaste:)
legit my dream quad🥲
mark rober is the only youtuber whos videos i watch to the actual end
Mark Rober, The Internets Coolest Uncle

Well done dude. This is absolutely insane.
How long did it take to clean up the mess afterwards?
Most positive person in the world, respect for him.
Acho que alguém ficou com inveja do Iberê e declarou guerra kkkkk

That was super sweet!
Wholesome
How in the heck do you clean devil's toothpaste up?-
12:52 Me when taco bell
You are the nicest person I’ve ever ment I want to be like you are my roll model
That`s what you should do next, Devil`s Toothpaste ROCKET!!!

11:29 if ykyk  leth fans where ya at
Hands down the worlds coolest uncle
Now i know why they call it elephant toothpaste
Quality content.
Mark Rober is awesome.
This now feels like a channel made for Zoomers. Peace.
You came to my home town
I used to watch the OG first package pirates
Fantastic! Thank you to everyone who took part.
Shrek did a doo doo...
Insane!
No other YouTuber can bring me tears of joy on such a consistent basis. So wholesome, so educational, so inspiring, so Mark Rober!

Mark Rober zdjuejagrutnggj?
YEAH! Beat this David Dobrik.
Me after eating a mac donald
Ty for making my day
I really want to know how much that cost
I wish I grew up with kids
This is so cool!!!
Everytime i watch one of these videos from Mark , my hope for humanity grows
And it went muuuch higher you just did have it in frame. So you were like well I have the previous rec anyway.  POST
I almost get giddy when I see a new video lol. I'm 45 and my inner child is LOVING videos like this. Thank you!
Anyone else kinda reminded of scrambled eggs with the yellow?
What a great closing message.
This is why I love the internet            Also how come I’ve learned more from YouTube than school
Amazing video
This is so American. Europeans know what i'am talking about. What is TO AMERICAN leave comment below 👇
POV: You got eaten 9:48
You should have a warehouse witch is your hall of flame where you can have flask and everything else you’ve done/will do.
Omg
So big and over powered
I wish mark rober was my science teacher
I really want a 3.0 of the Squireel
Wow
This was so heartwarming!  Also that dive at 7:37 was really nice
you know you're dead when mark rober himself invites you to do some experiments lmao
stop making pollution for your videos. so sad.
2:30 colt 45 remix track?
Lol you told us how to make devils toothpaste well telling us how the syringe worked lol
can you make another flask. but one that's 4x bigger and has 4 different colour compartments and 4 tubes that create a spiral effect as it shoots up ?
Wholesome video content.
I didn’t expect to cry.
12:50
This was so heart warming. Thank you Mark. Thank you for making those who are in the worst possible places in their lives- thank you for making those people happy. You are truly a Hero. Much love <3
woooooo
It would be so much fun to stand under that stuff just be ingolfed in the devils toothpaste😂
WOW!!, Can We Get Some 4k Footage Of That, It Was So Beautiful
É Iberê, não foi dessa vez
12:49
That tracking shot as the foam floated away though! 😐 Also how do you clean up something like this? What happens with all the orbeez?
begins at 12:51
13:10 - American baby gender reveals be like:  *"ITS A SHREK "*
why does people get super happy when mark gets the new record, but no one gets happy when the brazillian dude gets the record
ever want to try it again make the lip of flask circular
12:48 you're welcome
My question is what if u made the hole smaller how high would it go
Amazing!!!
Why is mark rober friends with so many kids...
you should've done this at an airport and hit a plane with the elephants toothpaste
Let’s say a human was in there. Would he or she go launching?
Science mixed with fun, mixed with deserving kids, and scoring "Uncle bonus points"... awesome video.
This makes me happy
Fun engineering and a really awesome thing to do for those kids.. nice one!!
You should design something usefully to humanity.
Did it was elephant toothpaste or devil toothpaste
Amogus?
Should ave made it red
makeitblue
1+ uncle point HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE RN mark be like : 10000000000000 points
Lethmyr is that you?
He also deserves a Best Guinness Of World Record for being the coolest uncle.
Does anybody knows formula of explosives toothpaste? I need it....for science of course
One of my favorite you tubers.    Keep up giving  and keep up the science.
Wow!
How high into space😶
i like how the safe guard is just like: "Did I trully get contracted for this? :/"
That’s awesome, just straight up awesome 🤩
13:00 - 13:06 I can see why it's called Elephant toothpaste, the noise it makes
Did anyone notice at 14:58 that when he says "I still had one grand final surprise for Brody" it sounds super groovy and on beat like he's rapping
Child labor hello yeah
10:10 FLAMING HOT CHEETOS????
Awesome 😎
Lets go
It looks like mark liked it better then the kids
I love your videos. Educational and fun. But its kind of boring that you do the same thing over and over again. (Except the squirrels)
Ye gods, that was like 80 meters. I love this man's approach, just... Take principles of engineering and go goddamn crazy with them, and don't just sit on the design, actually BUILD the thing! It's wonderful.
GREAT video. your new best video in my opinion !
For my rocket league boys at 11:45 I realized the song was lethamyrs intro
His videos just get crazier and crazier 😂
Can we all agree that mark rober is one of the nicest people out there
Brody's story gave me chills. He deserves everything.
Dude
I LOVE PROTELER'S MUSIC SO MUCH
Other people: sees happy kids in orbeez pool Me: oh he used lethamyr theme
Amazing Video ♥️
best vid so far! nice job
so heartwarming that you are able to give these kids aa one in a lifetime experience
This is the most wholesome video I've seen ever. Awesome!
Why the title change?
who else remembered that the music he uses is lethamirs intro song
Mr beast is now 2nd
I saw the picture and I knew it was Mark Rober.
mark inspired me to get into engineering its so badass
GRIDLEY?!?!?! I LIVE THERE!!!!
December 1st
Soo cool!!!
Mark is getting closer and closer to making Nuclear warheads
🤍🤍🤍
Dude you are so kind
Id love to know how much this video cost lol
Naturally the next step is building one for each colour
This is the dad guy
Mark Rober needs to do a colab with Colin Furz, together they can turn the internet up way past 11.
YAY
Camera at 13:57:  Za Warudo! Time is only mine, the fun has just begun!
Explosive chemical? What is the environmental impact? How much resources wasted? We don't have a planet B.
Wow.
i guess money makes you happy
Mark, thank you. This is spectacular and selfless. You're an inspiration.
Wow
Not me thinking they were spraying the kids with elephant toothpaste
The standing panty wailly treat because night symptomatically dream save a mute gondola. disillusioned, imperfect windchime
I still want to know how you guys clean everything up
Omg I always wonder how he did all of this
They seemed to be more excited about the limo than the private jet!
Marks friends get the most insane party’s
Pog
This video brought me to tears. You are rolling science, and being awesome to other people into one cool package. You are a role model and I think you. Draft kings… it’s awesome you support this!
It’s not a mark rober video without a montage
This reminds me to 2019, when life was fun.
Nice job bro
songs?
Breaking news: Global Warming has now caused green substances to fall from the sky
Wow! What a mess!
Mark Rober is such a big inspiration!
you yankees really know how to put on a party
At this point we can call mark an elephant dentist
white folks having fun
I don't think you need to worry about securing devil's toothpaste. Making concentrated nitric acid generally takes long enough to filter out anyone just goofing around.
Just waiting for him to top the record again next year
Awesome
I think you could do better with a smaller end, more pressure and new record🙆🏼😉
yo who tf is dale
Oh no not this again 🥴
Great job!
I love how mark throws these epic parties for kids in need. Keep making the world more fun!
Came in just for the ending but the rest of the video is so wholesome I had to watch it all the way through
What would happen if you put devils toothpaste in the flask?
When a gift can make more than the recipient smile :-)
did you have to break the record again? lol
Thanks for the amazing vibes!
You should try this with devils toothpaste
Puedes poner otro canal pero en español
POV: You had taco bell
Mark rober u r not for kid, u r a kid 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰
I always love watching these videos, both from doing something nice for people and for the amazing science behind the projects
These kid are having the time of their live. While me just doing nothing😢
This is great. Would also be super cool to see Mark help out some kids from some socially less privileged families.
When Elephants don't need toothpaste... make elephant toothpaste explode 100s of feet into the air!
20 seconds to build it sheeeeesh u are fast and you sell lemons to get money?
I. LOVE. IT
1:56 I love how casual he says that
Wouldn't want to brush my teeth with that toothpaste... 😶
The future of the future.
great thinking not govinf ohr the devils toothpaste formula
And did you clean it?
Didn’t expect a video about a giant flask full of explody foam to make me misty eyed… but here we are.
is this the official wastefulness and pollution channel yet?
This is incredible, that record was well deserved
Brody and fletcher are legends
And 50 balls is how many bars/psi?
Thats me why i ..
I'm a massive believer of be a nice person and you will attract nice people to be around you. Nice people then share their individual luxuries for everyone to enjoy as you do the same.
Mark Rober is the kind of person we should all aspire to be
You are wonderful people! Your kids have all reason to really love you!!!
Cried like a baby last time, cried like two babies this time.
Make a glue pool and invite MrBeast
10:03 that looks like lava that’s so cool
what's next building a drone and sending it to the moon
I’m jealous
That boy does not deserve it
You need to supply the reactants with helium and watch it really float away.
Wholesome
Mark is the real life embodiment of Phineas and Ferb
Just realised that has lethamyrs intro song in it 😂
Gotta make a bunch of them in different color and set them off at the same time next🤝😂
Lethamyrs intro song 😳
Human
Another Awesome Video by the best one of the best youtubers on the platform
He looks like Dustin from stranger things 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Rn build montage was actually 21.09 seconds not 20 seconds
A lot of different types of whites in this one.
That must have been the best birthday in the history of birthdays! And they didn't start a forest fire so bonus points for SCIENCE!!!
Mark Rober we will not give away the recepi for devil toothpaste .... alsomark rober at 8:50
🪅🪅🪅
Thought a Lethamyr video was playing in the background when the orbies came out
Pretty strange that 8 million people want to watch other people having fun ever thought about that?
Imagine the kids go *tesla*
Now turn it upside down and make a rocket🚀
Super like for this video 👍👍👍
imagine being a bird and accidentally get hit by that bruh
Private jet secret benefactor?? Mr beast let him use the jet lol
How much money did you spend
Could you do a video about how you clean all of this stuff up, and the costs involved?
9:57 looks like magma
What is so special about a tesla? Here in the Netherlands everyone drives a tesla. Even the taxi’s are tesla’s
When Mark beings out a tesla and then brings out a private jet.
This is so amazing thanks you dod that for the kiddo
I want to be you when I grow up!
Mark is that one uncle we had that we liked more than our own parents
chemical chemical polluting  environment
Mark Rober  A very kind generous smart scientist  Aka  UNDERATED
People can seem so hateful but, when you see a whole town come together to make a dream of a child come true it just floors me! There are so many wonderful human beings in this world, much more than not! Thank you for being a great role model Mark! Such a fun, heartfelt video.
oooh so that was what the green cloud was at 4pm oh ok i thaught aliens were invading few!
12:50 you're welcome
12:46
He is very creative and smart and he is probably tired cause he has been building and making things over and over again so be respectful
Give us devil phnom
12:54 you can see how excited mark is he even punched the window
You know Mr beast omg
I believe you
POG
WoW
Congrats!!
"Most footballs have a pressure rating of 6 to 8 lbs. or 0.6 or 0.8 BAR" So about 30-40bar. Why not say that instead, so people can understand.
I believe you
10:03 looks like lava
What is up with him and toothpaste
Another one
What a priceless way to spend youtube money, hats off Mark Rober.
i want mark rober to plan my parties...
That was soo amazing and nice to do! :)
I swear my science teacher would still      Let the backing soder volkano win even if mark ented the science competition with this
Mark Should Use This For His Glitter Bombs And The Reaction Of The Pakage  Theives Would Be Hallorious
THIS IS REAL LIFE?
Ello
Elon Musk: ‘Making self-landing rocket ships’ Mark Rober:
Did you clean that?
Congratulations for getting another World record
Hearing Lethamyr’s theme song was slightly disorienting
a
dude nobody talking about how mr beast went out of his way completely just for this kid that’s not even in his video. much respect to him
💪🏽💪🏽
That was so wholesome
I want to see that irl
how to make devils toothpaste: 8 cups of rabbit fur, 10 pounds of Oprah Winfrey, and the normal ingredients
The world needs more of this :)
You can get it bigger than that
Once again, Mark Rober wins the Best Person award
That kid flip at 8:14 was olympic
Brasil fez primeiro! 🇧🇷 Vão td toma  no cool 😂
8:41
Who else would want Mark to be one of their relatives? I honestly would love that.
Did he tell us the devils toothpaste recipe
Mark is Wholesome  Videos are wholesome His personality is wholesome  Everything about this channel is so inviting
That’s just so cool.-
chernobyl 2, coming to cinemas near you
Mr beast + science= mark rober        Mark if ya reading this (i doubt you are) just wanna say your videos are great and you should definetly keep doing things like this cause everyone loves it and im not sure but i think you love it too.    . ps. Your definetly the coolest uncle
Such a virtue signaler!  You have received your reward in full.  Matthew 6:2
When that thing comes you fight it
So one ingredient is feuming nitric acid
🙂

What are you doing listening to Proleter I know I am 12 but I know Proliter
🤗🥰😜
i wish i can have a mark rober b-day party but i live in texas ;-;
nice
You are such an inspiration Mark
now u gotta do the same thing but this the devils toothpaste stuff
Wait what i was so sure i was surprised
7:04 vs 1:25 : this is not fitting together at all. How many trees need to be planted to compensate this short flight? But much more important is that this sets role models: using private jet is cool... NO THIS IS NOT COOL, this destroys the foundation of life for the generation you are throwing the party for.
Does it carry electricity
Tuco while watching this: " TIGHT .... TIGHT ... TIGHT!"
Go Brody! My boy!
My teacher showed us one of ur cids
Devils toothpaste is the equivalent of the secret krabby patty formula
is that the highest?
2030: Mount Vesubio full of elephant toothpaste!
You're amazing!!! This is amazing!!!
12:46 your welcome
All that chemical unnecessarily release into the soil and eventually under ground water stream.  Pls take care of the your local water bodies - water is the elixir of life.
Next year you either gotta go bigger, or do MORE flasks.
I live there omg
I teach the lazy way not the teacher way
You guys make this stuff look easy
How many uncle points ya have?

Editing of this video is just awesome..

This has got me in my feels. I'm not crying you are!
F for respect lose of manual do mundo
Mark doesn’t miss
I've been trying to reach from last one month in insta,  mail etc atc. but I didn't get any response mark
Well, now it's time to work out that devils' toothpaste formula...
All he needed was some weed and some bad bitches and he was gon be straight
I know Mr beast reacts is now reacting to it 💎[big  🧠]
Why are his views so low now? He used to get 60M +…
And there are still people that want to tell us that money cant make us happy…
They called him a madman... but now, reality can be whatever he wants.
😍😍
Did you build the House?
stop polluting you jerks
It has bromine thats why when contacted with any item it catches on fire 😂
i thought you were mr. beast brother lol
Mark rober for president 2024!
freakin legend
every single kid watching this, knowing, that they will never experience that in their lives ;(
I'm not crying, you are!
I love this
Love your videos
It has bronine 😂
You took being an uncle to a different level
Mark Rober should open  science theme park
WOW just WOW!!!
I like the throat to exit design
ohhh devils toothpaste probably has hydrochloric acid or something
"it's a tesla" that hurt my soul but i still love mark
Being a neighbour to him will be 🔥
Uncle of the decade ❤️
11:28 Lethamyr!
Wow, but how do you clean it up?
Thank you Mark Rober for putting out amazing quality content.  It's hard to believe how much money quality content costs while we have these other channels on YouTube that are just content farms.
Mark--thank YOU for being an amazing human!
It sounded like an elephant      If you don't get it then you will get eaten up by it's toothpaste
I wonder if we could weaponized devil's toothpaste
one of the best videos of youtube great job 💯🖤
I want him to be my uncle
This is incredible!!!
19,7 mil. ... +1
Mark Rober is everyone’s dream uncle
Mark, you made everyone day 50x better <3  LOVE your work!
Woah!
Wow!!! Cool experiment!!!
If Mark`s videos were video games i would preorder them all
Okay now make a rocket with the toothpaste
Very cool
These are like the best montages ever👌 so relaxing
Can you launch a potato to space for my birthday March 26
sen bugha?
any leth fans hear the Leth intro music bc I thought I was about to watch someone get dunked on
Let’s just think about this… how much money did this take? Edit: WOW
wish to see that on 4k.
Mark rover is mark rober
7:58 now imagine if that got into ur mouth
8:41 Did you just give out the recipe?
Love the video
You are #11 on trending here in the UK!
Remind me not to get oranges from that farm
2 days ago, #2 on trending
I fell happy for the boy
SO COOL
I cant tell if Mark Rober is a child that wants to do cool superhero stuff or an Adult that wants to help people.
So you helped this kid take the Guinness world record from last years kid? lol
10 verified people
I love the +1 uncle points, you’re such a great person mark
Fletcher sister hella bad
Simple science fair volcano scaled wayy up
Literally smiles the whole video! Only person in YouTube that can do that. What an inspiration! We need more people like this in this world 🌍
50 times the force of pushing against a inflated football??? what is this standard American measurement ;D  (still well done tho)
How many more times is the title going to change…
when life gives you lemons u get lemons
12:45
When life gives you lemons... call them rare yellow oranges and sell em for twice as much!
WWWWOOOWWWW
P.O.V. Ur addicted to elephant toothpaste
Days... even the mayor joined in on it.
I literally saw the title and said “not again”
very entertaining video mark rubber
How tf does this video have 8 million views in only 2 days?
What is the force of pushing against a fully inflated football?
That’s cool 👍🏾
✌🏻
nice
this is so cool but i am wondering who is paying for all this?
helicopter pilot thinks it a distress signal
it would be nice if mark comes to europe
speaking if rocket... elephant toothpaste rocket?
Wait didn’t he just reveal the formula to devils toothpaste, he said the ingredients lol
Thank you for picking my favorite color
Even made it on to the uks mail online!
Your selfless acts of kindness are truly touching keep doin what you do
Me on December first
This guy is just incredible if your not subbed what r u doing
I could watch that montage for ever 😍
How ironic you are in #2 trending and Mr beast in #1 trending
You should’ve did a huge liquid sand pool
This is so freaking kind plus the science was awesome insert yeah science thing here
My boi is BACK AT IT WITH ANOTHER ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE VIDEO
This guy wins my heart everytime
freaking legend
Wonder what would happen to a person if they were in the flask. 🤔
That kid is so lucky
What a kids and the great people of that town!
Can I be Mark Rober when I grow up?
They should leave the flask there as a monument!!!
how many drone pilots did you hire for this?
1:14 I HAVE THE SAME EXACT SLOTH
Nice video but at 13:44 how much do I have to push against the football? The force coming from the football is just as big as the force I'm pushing with. Was the pressure you measured 50x as high as the pressure in the football? But that would be something different than force. (Sorry buy I had to)
I feel like Mark Rober is that chemical version of a mad scientist with the best intentions I love his vids I hope he keeps making people in need happy with his gift 👍
50 times a football... That might be the most American unit of measurement ever!
Casually looking for Justin y
Child labor 🤣
Absolutely the truth when mark talks about giving to others, with no thought of getting something in return, karma will definitely come around and one way or another you will be rewarded! That's what life is about. Mark is 100% the best if not one of the best creators on YouTube. Love his content and just his pure passion to make things while also helping others just because he can and is in a position to..
What would happen if you mixed Mark and Velma from scooby doo? Comment below.
i wanna live in gridley california so i get invited to his parties
You have done it again but better ❕❕
ok maybe i cried a little, greetings from Brazil
That's nice :)
You have always been landing the craziest camera shots but somehow you keep improving them every video. Absolutely amazing work, love the vids, keep it up!
Are the plants ok? 🪴
Why dose some scenes remind me of a National Geographic show
Has no one considered how effective a weapon would be XD? Litterally burning soap showers down of you giving you severe burns XD
can u through me a party plz
Cool party and all but where's the watermelon?
Pretty cool of you to do this for someone like Brodie that deserves it for his kindness.
Was this recorded before pandemic or in the middle of pandemic (just curious)
Not me crying when I heard that he gave his only wish to someone else 😭
Thanks for making the world a little brighter and a lot more fun Mark.
mark rober blowing up the whitehouse with devils toothpaste (he broke his record)
Got literal goosebumps from everything in the video, holy cow mark ur a legend
Idgaf idfc useless video
INcredible, this guy never does thing halfway!! Completely over the top as usual with him.
ㅤ
I thought this was a plot for early 2000’s movie..im so jealous ngl
12:50
He is so fun and kind
I love markrober
:O
Some time in the future, i would be really cool if you did another video like this but the whole purpose would be to see how high you can lift the structure, so like an elephant thoothpaste rocket.
Mark Rober, nobody makes me cry my own tears!! You suck( a term of endearment in our family)!!
You took volcanos to another level
I'm curious, do you think snowshoes would be able to make you walk on a pool of orbeez? I don't see why they wouldn't but I would like to find out for sure.
Mark I think you have an obsession with elephant toothpaste
I cat and it dont
Mark is literally a W human being.
how do you even clean this
TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND MAKE A ROCKET
Dammit Mark, I don't watch your videos to cry! Big ups to Brody and his kind heart
Such a beautiful monsterenergy
😉
An awesome and wholesome video! Deserves to be on the trending page.
This guy has no enemies, only friends...........
what about mixing elephants toothpaste with devils?
Pretty sure I figured out your devils toothpastes catalyst came to me after I saw the glove light on fire 🤔
Rober sir you are best of your kind
And that’s where the record stands today
judging from the burning glove, I think that the secret catalyst is sulfuric acid or potassium permanganate
I live this video amazing work.
12:48
Amazing
WAIT BRODY WAS IN ZHC VIDEO WHEN HE COLORED A WHOLE HOSPITAL WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT?????
Pls make homemade rocket going to space
It looks like a geyser
Did he really missed the opportunity to call it a dinosour toothpaste?
20 points to the drone guy.
Just appreciate how hard mark works for our enjoyment
WELL I SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN MARK ROBER FOR PRESIDENT. This was 1 of your best videos I have ever seen 👍😎🇨🇦👍😎🇨🇦👍😎🇨🇦
Stuff like this always warms my heart
This is epic I'm gonna cry 😩
Bora Iberê, fazer esse caras comerem poeira. Lançar a pasta de dente de 🐘 até a lua.
Это очень круто !
How to be famous: Birthday
12:50 thank me later
LEGEND
An explosive toothpaste themed birthday?
I’m guessing Brody is a subscriber/guest star now
I remember when he said "This is the first and last time i will be using a private jet"
legit thought dale was just joe pesci riding in on an atv
Seeing Brody's dad give Mark a hug made me tear up, as a dad, I totally get that.
hay I no you mark some won in my famly workts at nasa with you on the land rover
Coolest uncle, can’t imagine if I had one, I’d be so inspired to be the next NASA scientist
Mark Rober is no longer scientist he is a fantasy genius
I'm not crying, you are
Why are some YouTuber just so big of a legends
soooooo i think everyone wants to see the devil toothpaste version
Elephant, the word that is going to be soon extinct....
too bad the other kid just watched his world record get beat
after one month...he comes back...
the editing is amazing!
A yes child labor
its about time mark robber gonna make elephant toothpaste and party in the moon
simply amazing
never thought i would hear lethamyrs intro anywhere else lol
Chemicals: "Wood is no match for us!" (destroys giant flask) Mark Rober: "Hold my Test Tubes!" (Engineers a bigger flask made from steel!)
why is the channel at 3:01 using the logo of Communist Party USA?
did anyone else notice they played the music from Lethamyr's intro during the orbeez pool bit?
you never now till you experience Anoder chance liife is big same as the milion donator
I’m sorry but why is everyone white?
Woah I’ve never had a birthday party since I was five (I’m 12 now, not even any presents ;-;) but if I had one I’d love for this guy to throw it for me
Mark rober = National geographic for everyone except Karens
This, is more worth watching then National geographic White tiger videos... For now...
U r super kind
Mempesona sekali.. . .gokil bro
u gave away u r devals tooth past 8.50
I was expecting mr beast to pull the “I just bought this kids entire hospital”       Edit: mr breast is no more  Edit 2: for context I made a spelling mistake and fixed it
That cameraman @12:56 looks like a kid
First one
now turn the flask uside down :)
Hi
F for the camera that was above the Devil's toothpaste.
Beautiful
Next video: we build our own space station!
6:28 They actually considered it! That’s how cool a Tesla is!
I love how you make science fun for all the kids, but you make us adults cry like little babies. Thank you for doing what you do.

David Dobrik: Hold my beer
There’s one problem, it was to much and broke up into pieces
Look at Mark being all like Captain Disillusion!
He should make the elephant toothpaste white colored
Is it me or does this video has better editing than usual

Plot twist the jet crashes
Thanks for being y'all  a simple vid makes me happy but what you and your friends do is just epic 😉 love yall
Great drone footage!
Can you please let us know how you clean this all up? I can’t imagine you would let it just sit there
theres no need of doing alll this
My birthday on February soo me next?
His friend is Mr Beast
Everything about this vid is glorious. Amazing job to everyone single one who helped pull this off (even the editors of this vid)!!
So we just not going to talk about how he just slid off that slide and dived into the water like a dolphin😂
That kid is one amazing kid. Like holy crap.
That private jet is a Cessna Citation X, depending on what generation it is, it’s worth about $2,000,000

Video Edits and Footage WAS TOP NOTCH on this Vid💾🔥
Fully inflated football??  Okay, here's one: A freight train composition of fully loaded small cube cars the length of two Eiffel towers travels at the speed of one baseball base to base distance per second. How many family cars traveling at maximum legal speed in US does the kinetic energy equal to?
nice
There was even a life guard at the pool prty what a guy at 7:33
N. Mmmm¡Kl lol   L
This restores my faith in humanity
Next year it was to forming that's why I made it  to the moon
Great job with the drone footage Nurk!
Not the largest tho
If I play fantasy football with you I mean I choose foot-ball people, not american football team. So I win? Eh? By the way, awesome video!
who else noticed he used the same song as lethamyr's intro?
12:52 me and your mum when.. When me and.. Your mom and me and.. Me when..
Thank you, Mark, for being such a wonderful human being.

when your uncle is an engineer, this is what happens.......
3:45 Oh my, it looks so photoshopped when you zoom in! I hope you get more views then those clickbaiters!
Holy
What you came for 12:45
i want that devils toothpaste recipe, time to do some science
12:47 it looks like a miniature version of the Krakatoa volcano eruption. nice work
Just amazing !!!!! Well done mark..
I love child labor
Hope this vid gets like 50M views
Congratulations Brody you deserve it!
I loved how the flask had several pinhole leaks that made it look like something out of a mad scientist's lab from children's cartoon show!
Sooo how many people drowned?
The most important question of all questions: Did you get to touch it?
Beautiful
Imagine being inside the flask I wonder if you’d get launched or suffocated
What a blast!
He also deserves a Best Guinness Of World Record for being the coolest uncle.
I'm really curious, how does one clean up all that messy stuff?
This is a yearly thing now
What the song for 2:35
Can we use this to launch spaceships instead of idk fuel
The top 4 comments are verified
bro used lethamyrs intro music 😂
still waiting.
Since there’s hydrogen peroxide can you make it glow like a glow stick?🤔
Science can be so fun! And messy...
Any leth fans go crazy with the so g
This is literally a dream
This will restore your fath in humanity
He should have an asmr channel
Kindness always comes back

Holy moley you overdid yourself again, in a major way.
The normal noodle immunologically explain because unit concurrently complain within a dusty weight. racial, merciful pot
It turns out there IS hope for this world after all.
I think we are talking about different football games
I spent the whole video looking for anyone that wasn't white lol
I can´t help but wonder if everyone at those parties were vaccinated :c
That was fricken insane
Aw yeah, @NURK FPV was there! Moar drones!
14:01 pause it and think how this could be how zombies appear in a movie
Insane
Wow
Well done Mark.  Plain and simple.  Words cannot express The frog in my throat    Cheers

DANG IT MARK AND CREW, YOU DONE MADE ME CRY AGAIN WITH ALL THOSE KIND GESTURES.
CONGRATS 🥳
We need to know how to make the devil’s toothpaste please.
This record is not going to break for many years to come.
I’m sorry but did anyone notice during the build montage the background music was Colt 45 but the beat was remixed
pretty cool but now make an elephants toothpaste cannon
14:07 ME AFTER SOME SLOPPY TOPPY
I challenge mark Robert in super smash bro’s 2021 September 7

You cant make a science channel video wholeso-- : Mark Rober: Hold my toothpaste
also Hi Mr. Beast!
I'm always intrigued by the science and at times really touched by the kindness you share with others!
I love how his videos are always child friendly!
When you see the Devil’s toothpaste experiment it looks like a lot of  colourful scrambled eggs attack.
I love ur channel so much even though I am only ten I like all your science
Shout out to the drone controller
I thought this got reuploaded
Lethamyr's intro Pog
I’m guessing Devils Toothpaste might be Potassium Permanganate but I can’t explain the fire part
Love how he is always in flip flops!
WOW
You wasted another video on this... c’mon mark, your way better than this.
Ok..that was cool.. but what if you try to do the same with Devil's toothpaste?
Amazing!
So turning someone’s home into nuketown
Shopkinns
Mark, ur the best this was a great video :D
So where's the giant dude so we can brush his teeth
❤️❤️
Seeing children happy makes me happy. you´re doing a great job.
Wow world record
Id swim in that
Me beast record brake
While watching this video, I have a question. I know that if you hit water from too high that it would be like hitting concrete. What would it be like to it orbees instead would it be the same?
That was awesome!!!
I wanna be an uncle like mark
BIG MESS
Mark rober please make a 3.0 squirrel maze.
Mr. beast watching this 😭😭😭😭
Credit where credit is due ...
I hope brody is ok i feel bad for him :(
He robbed the world record 🤓
We need more you in the world.
i love the things you do and the messege you delivere and how it is impacting people. im just happy that i saw your videos one day.
8:42 isn't is devils toothpaste?
Plot twist. All this project is just to cover Mark Rober's child labor employees
Mark please build one for elon musk so he can sit on top of the flask and get launched to the mars.
I wish I was there
Fat Glob!!
Mark makes me optimistic about the prevailing spirit of humanity.
7:36 if anyone's wondering what song this is: its jinji-on my way... Helping anyone who really wants to know.        Very underrated music channel give em' some love
such a beautiful masterpiece
This is me in my bed
So awesome
Absolutely amazing! Thanks for all you do brother! So fun to watch!
so... um... is devils toothpaste gonna be used in the military? 😂
why does he sound like Ross from Friends at 6:20 😂
13:02 kinda sounds like an elephant.
Let's go mark!
Mark was less than 30 mins away from me and I didn’t even know 😭
13:00  No one:   My stomach after eat Taco bell:
I'm not crying... you're crying
Congratulations ! 🎉🎉
Thank you to Mark and every other youtuber who puts the sponsors at the end of the video
Amazing!!!
This was such a beautiful and inspiring video. The things you do is truly amazing not only for yourself but for some many people around you. Thank you, for being a true inspiration to so many.
When your with Mark Rober, you can never be bored
looks like CG!
Congrats mark
You really like abusing manecins huh?
Crazy cool!
Every year make it bigger
What happens to the pool full of orbeez after the birthday party is over??
Mark's favorite thing one earth is elephant tooth paste
"Fully inflated football" ... is that a shot at Tom Brady?
Now we need an elephant toothpaste powered rocket
Imagine a bird flying into this …. I want to see it ….
"50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" So how much force was that exactly? That was about as clear as mud.
E
50 footballs of pressure was it? Can someone convert it to soccer balls for the metric crowd?
Should wear a helmet when riding an ATV
Next time "now a 100 ton flask that shoots down satelites"
Marks scream sounded like a siren
Isn’t the devil toothpaste just higher % H2O2? I guess you use 50% and thus it reacts more violent or use a other catalyst with the 50% like permanganate or per/iodate I think
👍👍
Mr beast should watch this video
In gemany we say: wallah das war hoch
i love putting children in cars that explode.  such a humanitarian.
Is no-one talking about the editing?
But why is it shaped that way ? Doesn’t this shape lose a lot of energy to the floor ?
You are such a inspiring person
Mark: hey kid in a dificult situation, want a Word record? Edit: For y’all in the responses, I definitely won’t get a Word record.
Mark, you are truly an inspiration and have touched my heart a number of times! I also think you must be like the coolest Uncle ever!!! Thank you for all you have done for these kids...continue touching the hearts and minds of others!
Why can’t you just be my dad
Such a wild idea to take the record you gave to fletcher and give it too brody lmao
fun and all but now turn the flask upside down and see how high it will go
Big
your video team is soso great
nice videography mark
now you need the record for an elephant toothpaste launch like what happened last year
Congratulations on making 2 on trending
Me when your mom when me your mom see me your your me your mom see
Mark when he does experiments: Wooooooooo  Marks neighbors: oh he’s up to it again
wow
💯% Super wholesome and incredibly legendary
Awesome thank you for doing this
The fact that he did all of that without getting anything in return is amazing
Option 1: ride in a Tesla   Option 2: ride in a Tesla to a private jet then ride in a limousine   What option would you choose?🤔
Well done, Mark Rober, well done!
Trinity test site July 1945
Bruh anyone else want pizza 🍕
Naaaaaao (quem viu o vídeo do manual do mundo que ele bateu o record?)
Wow
Wow
I came here to be entretained, no to feel ;-; Still loved it!
What a message
wow, top lad Mark, nice one Brody, respect
Day 67 of telling Mark his uploads are appreciated
forget about the volcano, this dude has a heart of GOLD
Me thinking : is tha how explode vulcano without smoke 12:58
Who would have thought 10 years ago that individuals with a youtube channel would deliver far better content than network television did?.  This is a masterpiece and worth every dollar you spent making it. Happy belated birthday Brody.
7.7 million views in one day wow
Im crying
Mark Rober is the definition of “that one cool uncle”, change my mind
This is all just the best of feels. Well done mark and crew
When you're 2nd on trending behind mrbeast it must be cool
All I want to know is how that kid managed that front flip out of the pool.
You're a blessing for the world, Mark, thank you this makes me smile (and a little teary eyed at the end)
I am curious, what happens to the mess after it's all over?
mark and jimmy literally deserve the world
Awesome video love this channel
U should make the elephant toothpaste white😏
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16:08 beautiful message to end this video. **tips fedora out of respect*
Drake album is out 💿
I bet if you got him a bunch of weed and bitches he would have had a better time.
Mark...I don't know what happened in your life to make you this type of person...to give THIS much...but I'm sure you are blessed for your generosity. Thank you so much for sharing these videos. Your unbridled enthusiasm for just having fun while doing such great things for something else AND including science-y stuff is unbelievable!
The only youtuber to do the same thing 2 times but still make it awesome
Keep being you
Have you tried using Potassium Permanganate as catalyst, if it isn't already part of your secret devil's toothpaste 🤔😶
Both Mr beast and mark Rober uploaded on the same day
Make a elephant toothpaste propelled rocket
That was insane.
13:10  Tactical Nuke Incoming
Greasy fry bread,  Greasy Greasy fry bread
What are the environmental implications of this?
No one: Me:'thinks about how experience this vid be
Private jet over Tesla ? We are doomed.
And this is why i love your content  thank you for doing what you do :D
"was that better than the doctor's office?"
13:40 Me: oh neat it would be actually interesting to know how high the pressure was 13:48 Mark Rober: Well here you have another freedom unit
Do you use interpolation for the slo-mos?
I love Marks videos there so wholesome
Can we use this as propulsion in space...make a human flight next
This warms my heart
sheeeeeeshhh
The foam pool and orbies pool montages genuinely looked like holiday adverts. Mark genuinely has the quality of million dollar advertising teams.
This is definitely a once in a life time experiment, I think it'd be awesome if tech devs took inspiration and analysis of your experiment to potentially intergrate it into engin simulations.
Red Elephant Toothpaste Volcano: *You can't defeat me.*  Mark Rober: *I know, but he can*  *Green Elephant Toothpaste Volcano*
One word: science
i feel like he is the best youtuber
i was about to say have you done this before i am 26 seconds in
This is so incredibly wholesome...
ok.
YEEEES LETS GO ANOTHER ONE
Bru 2 on trending
i am just siting here an smiling becus the kids had so much fun
welcome back its been long
very nice vid xD
Mark: so I asked mr. Beast abou- Me if I was there: GIMME A PEN AND PAPER I NEED AN AUTOGRAPH
Didn't expect to randomly hear Lethamyr's theme music but life is full of surprises!
bunch of democrats down voting this, they don't want anyone to have fun :)
I think Mark should've put ( We finally did it ) in the title because there are people apart from Mark who worked really hard for this project!
my uncle doesnt do this kind of stuff to me, wth
Bird just normally flying meanwhile, Elephant flying Bird after 5 minutes: Is my land green?
Make one that is meant to be a rocket and send IT to space
I have to ask, how much did that actually cost?
just wow
heres a question is homogeneous a uniform or a non uni formed
It sounds like an elephant to lol
He should try to actually make an elephant’s tooth paste rocket. That would be crazy!
Nice work Mark!
MR best 😳😳😳
woah is lnsne
Mark is friends with everyone 😂
everyone got tested or no?
No one:  Hulk in Marvel's what if ep3 : 12:52
Magical
no mannequins were harmed during the progress of making this video
That has got to be at least 5 Gs
Is the orbee pool built in the middle of a dirt field or in someone’s backyard?? The hole was dug in the middle of no where... did you build houses too in this video?? Nice video
How do you clean all that after?
ahh not big enough i need you to beat elon musk and launch yourself to the space
This video is what the world should be- No conflict, just pure wholesome
Me after hearing the giant flask go off: oohhhh so that’s why it’s called elephant toothpaste
Why I always cry when I see your videos!
hi
Awesome
I love all those action drone shots!!
bravo
This town looks so cool and I come and live there 😂
Lol Mrbeast believed it
This is what YouTube should all be about. Crazy stuff with a touching back story. You and Mr Beast deserve a medal.
What a blessing it is to have someone like Mark Rober in the YouTube community🙏🏼
Please do this with devils toothpaste in the desert!
how much money did all of this cost lol
Well guys we got the devils toothpaste ingredients
Mark, Thank You for doing what you do... Many Blessing to you and all..
in 2100 : people use toothpaste for rockets Reason : watching Mark Rober's toothpaste volcano video (its just a jk)
Thank you Mark and all those that helped out. The world is full of kind people and the world needs to see this more often.  🙂👍
NEWS FLASH: Purple colouring vs Mark Rober
Just a middle aged dude hanging out with kids. Nais.
A
Honestly, at the start, that is literally the most mentally painful thing ever. Your Make-A-Wish, your one thing you can do before possible death, stolen. Never coming back. So, it’s really nice Mark sets a world record with him.
I wonder if you could make an elephant toothpaste rocket.
So freakin wholesome buddy 😲
OMG I LOVE THE SLO MO SHOTS!!!
this guy is a cheep baster i would don more for that kid with your money
p o g
Did the cameras that got covered survive?
I have 2 words  Absolutely INSANE
america
I guess the catalyst is potassium iodide
I love the 20 sec build montages! He is just so kind and humble! All the tiny tiny jokes Mark manages to put in TOTALLY ALWAYS make me laugh! I love this channel beyond anything! Thank you Mark, for EVERYTHING you've done for us!
What if you were in the devils toothpaste flouting up as high as a bird
Your video should be mandatory viewing in schools...a lesson in kindness, community, giving, and fun wrapped up in an awesome science project.  Kudos to you, Mark Rober, and your talented crew.
I wonder they could make a life size quetzalcoatlus that could fly
You should make a rocket that the trust is provided by the force of the elephants devil's toothpaste hahaha
🙏❤️
Epic.
Loved it Mark! You ALL did a fantastic job!
BRO THAT IS SO COOL
Bro Do a Jetpack for next video. 🤩
I strive to be like you one day

Environmental pollution, which the U.S. and developed countries have created, but later blame the underdeveloped countries.
That's awesome Mark. Thank you for being an amazing human being.
Was I the only one who thought the devils toothpaste looked liked scrambled eggs when it reacted
10:00 that puts a pizza' ish taste in my mouth ngl
This was even better than the last video and I haven't even finished the video!
At the end it kinda sounded like he was losing his voice
And the elephant toothpaste was incredible
The life lessons was great 👍
Hey Mark Rober I just built a mouse trap car
Make u wanna go to something for someone even if it’s not the best party ever lol
This is amazing, thank you.
The main thing is , science has patience

*dont forget the sponsor they are legends.
Love the videos mark

The definition of a hero
This is why I wanted to pursue a career in STEM. It is only through collaboration and the scientific method can something this aweosme be made. Thank you Mark Rober, this generation's "Science Guy"
Mark Rober in years 2022: World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano 2023: World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano 2024: World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano 2025: World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano and so on: World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano

You’ve really inspired me to keep going with my gaming channel.,!
.
As a parent, engineer and IET member I am incredibly proud that Mark has recently been made an honorary fellow of the IET. I can think of no one more deserving. Charitable, educational & inspirational. Thank you so much Mark for making engineering great again!
No one should watch my recent
No one should watch my recent

HACKİNG YOU
lethamyr’s intro song at the orbee part. anyone else notice that?
I love how he’s all secretive but a quick search and you can find the recipe for this stuff from some guy who did he own tests
* jealous *
DJI  fpv drone is so cool
The jet was sooo unnecessary!
12:48
Dude mrbeast and you need to do another collaboration
I mean... you kind of have to make a rocket using elephant toothpaste now....
You're a beautiful human being Mark ❤. The world needs more people like you
CGI
best part of the vid: Mrbeast
Dude’s a high-tech party planner now 😂
again?
When you are serious
You are truly one-of-a-kind, Mark. Thank you for doing what you do.
Am I the only that seeing the glove burn gives away what the chemical is, or have I just been doing this too long
such a beautiful masterpiece
I wish this guy was my dad
Who will hit 20 mil first Mark Rober or Faze Rug??
Why stop there? Why not conduct an experiment where you have to contact the FAA to impose a TFR?
Awesome video, finally did it! Anyway, time to get some new background music, don't ya think?
I don't wanna imagine the amount of CO2 released cuz of this party.
Mark Rober
FAAAAAIIIRRDDDDHERBBEEEEEE SQUUUUUUARRRREEEEEE, MARK YOU ARE AMAZING I LOVE YOU
*Now I want Mark Rober to be my uncle*
mark was like wow look at the house you can't see it well mark where should I look then
Waiting fro Mr beast to beat this
That was awesome 😍😍
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
no one gonna talk about how some still came out of the bottom.
I never would have guessed that you'd reach 250ft!!! Amazing science and even more amazing examples of compassion, well done 😊
Mark is awesome
So if this was put into "Rocket" form, how high up would the rocket go? If this was put on a horizontal sled, how fast would the rocket go?
Bro he's one of the most kind youtuber 1st is mrbeast
Green was the best color for this imo for some reason. Loved the video mark.
How does he clean all of these stuff up? 😐
My bycycle got stolen :') Still haven't found it
That's my money
Your videos are like short documentaries on fun!
I’d honestly have a hard time picking between the drive or flight because I would love to ask Mark about his work that he did at nasa
I always like and comment on his videos cause I just know the amount of effort he is putting into all of.his videos and for such a great causeeee!!!!!😌
It's quite satisfying when the orbeez? orbees? orbezz? orbes? (ok whatever) are going into the pool and is that a high speed camera attached to a drone?? ( 10:09 )
12:43 why is there just a whisper? It lowkey sounds like Enchantée but maybe that’s me
legendary
wowee
Me when I see ur mom
I don't understand was this really necessary
It's amazing how much came out of a little tiny tube
Make it orange-red colour now you get a homemade volcano.
And thanks to mr.beast
Wholesome as ever - love it!
Where did you flush the orbeez afterwards
Never seen him do this for a minority kid. Thumbs down.
The whole glove thing just made me find out what the ingredients are for devils toothpaste lmao
Is it just me but who wants to just run through all the elephant toothpaste
Do a devils paste powered rocket
2:33 music please?
Amazing!
2.31 je me promène dans mon avion parce que c’est super cool
Honestly Mark, you need to make a vlog channel. Your camera skills are too insane.
Holyyy crapppppp
Mark's videos are the best :)
Best youtuber ever
Meanwhile Elephant Gingivitis still runs out of control
this is amazing  only crap
4:19 Thats insane
cool
taRumlÜg Programmierer der Master K.I.   !
Maybe the real world record was the friends we made along the way
"I even harnessed some child labor" XD
You are so awesome
so how big was the force? 😅
Loved the drone shots
Anyone else interested in seeing this but with devil's toothpaste in the middle of the desert?
Just really curious, how do they clean this up? XD
This is exactly why this is one of my favorite channels on YouTube ! Much love ! Such an incredible Video from execution to message all in all perfect 🙏🏻
Hey Mark thank for the awesome videos...And putting a smile on young people life.. Thumbs up dude
.....elephants toothpaste is a exothermic reaction, and generates quite a bit of heat.....naptha? is that what you mixed with it to make the DT?
2 of my favorite Youtubers in one video! Just loved it 💖 Your guys are legend 👍
Wasn't The King of Random the one who created devil's toothpaste?
Everyone else: *uses metric*  Americans: 13:45
Whoo marker rubber uploaded
I can’t believe it was already a year
I love the video and especially the editing.
You are a wonderful human!
🥲🥲🥲🥲
I'm very sure Mr beast gave them the private jet but he can't say that
Did anyone else notice that the bottom of the flask did leak and the bucket jumped
Fletchers hair 👌
mark rober can you do link to buy the stuff for devils toothpaste or elephant pls
shoutout to the drone operator, he captures some incredible shots
Oh I love this♡
next year its gonna be that 2x just you wait
There's extra, and then there's Mark Rober surprise parties. The only time you can step out of a private jet to get on a limousine.
Now i want mark rober to be my uncle
Brody is a champ for giving the other kid that he didn't even know an ATV.
That looks soo cool
Should of had Mr Beast at that party and deliver that ATV himself.
When he pretended to be a doctor I felt very oom
You will always be the goat
This is awesome.
How fun would it be to have Mark as your uncle
Knowing Mark, this stuff likely emitted a gas to rid the entire Earth of air pollution as well
Nobody’s talking about the videos editing bro like its insane
Mark really is the definition of the cool uncle 😂  Edit: typo
Plot twist, he is building a giant weapon but is using child labor and birthday parties as a cover
I can’t even begin to explain how much I love your content!
Mr. Beast 😱😱
Mark rober stays being the best youtuber
Whenever you said town Builder Jeff I remember the meme
uncle points may only be +1 but friend points are +1000000000000000
uh bruh what huh rbuh
aww i am a little disappointed though that the flask contents was just green. really cool tho
This is lit🔥
Wholesome
Mark Rober videos are scientifically proven to be enjoyable
Rober is the best dude on YouTube. Prove me wrong.
Hey Mark!!! I haven’t seen u in a while :D
While we amazed with Mark's creations and all these fun moments to share with friends, nieces and nephews, and us as viewers... Imagine how much Mark gives to his son 💕💕
Aye dude can you build an Alexa that doesn’t do as you say
That really DID sound like an elephant when it shot into the sky! The green one
I'm not gonna say that this is an issue with global warming but it most definitely not an issue with heart warming
I love how you're not giving up the formula because it's only slightly combustible LUL
Mark Rober’s channel is fast becoming the new Jim’ll Fix It. Should we be worried?
I have no idea who these 5k people that are tossing out a thumbs down for such a wonderful video are but seriously - reconsider. Super fun!
Toothpaste?
That was incredible
Your Voice Is Dying
<3
it's incredible how every single video you make gets more extrem by a factor of 5
Is it only me that notices Mark constantly uses the v sign in his videos i.e "up yours" here in the UK. I don't by any means think that it's intended that way, but just an observation that maybe switch it around the other way? Love Mark byw!
The fact that it's called Elephant Toothpaste  It creates an Elephant sound ,13:11
Finally, he’s done it boys.
6:50 i need there @ rn
10:43 no no no no stop child
awesome vid pal
You sir be insane. Great party though and all your videos are super entertaining
Ahhhhh that looks AMAZING super jealous!!! But as always amazing to know ur bringing joy to kids who have gone through so much!!!!!❤️
“Is that better than going the the doctors office?”
Why do Americans like giving Surnames as first names? Fletcher, Brody, Taylor, MacKenzie etc. I find it so strange. Also, why do they take traditional male names and make them female: Riley, Ashley, Aubrey etc?
So high!!
Are you going to do another Mr. Beast collaboration like you did last time?
No it doesn't always comes back
I can’t believe it’s been a year since the last attempt and now we are he What a legend how fantastic 👍👍👍👍
Yeah I know it's cool but how to clean it?
Mark Rober do your nephews and niece agree that your the best uncle?
My science teacher shows your vids in class ,and I think thats really cool-
The drone shots and camera angles were amazing
<3
For a guy who makes 12 videos a year, you sure wasted one of them.
You should make a rocket with elephant toothpaste
Again..
When you have so much money that you dont know what to do with it you do this kind of stuff. Must be friends with the beast 666.
I feel warm in my heart ❤️
People might look forward to party with alcohols drugs girls n so n so  I look forward to mark robers party
This is just too cute.. my inner child is dying x)
12:28 is that the beach?
The cleanup afterwards must've been enormous!
I love the fact you took all safety precautions lol. Fire department. Life guards 😅😂
It kind of scattered tho. It wasn't that perfect ratio creating that thick beam of elephant toothpaste.
Absolutely magnificent 👍🏻🔥
you got a world record with the orbeez in a pool the biggest is 25mil for what i can find
This was some next level sh!t
I have a crush on Fletcher's sister now lmao
as much as i love these videos, i can only stand so many minutes of kids on a slide.
do i really have to get canser????
The awkward moment this man's science experiment flew higher than Boeing's Starliner
Thanks Brodys mum
I still don't understand why this thing is called elephant toothpaste. 😂
The devils toothpaste volcano looks like the mercury capsule
@mark Rober. So there is a lot of Pressure in the flask.. Have you thought of trying to use it as a propellant. like how kids make a water bottle rocket, but using Elephants toothpaste as the water?? Point the nozzle of a flask style downwards and see how high it lifts off.
Wait for last @MrBeast
Grabe, napakataas nang pagbulwak. Parang bulkan talaga.
They summoned the c*m demon ... but this one is,  the Lord of that demon
This was so wholesome
You should make 100million edible orbies and pit them into a pool. Ps. Sorry for misspelling
Whole time I was just :0
Great vid! But Leonard fournette? Really.
That kids sister is cute
imagine if mark become billionaire
Now i get it why its called Elephant Toothpaste . 13:02
“I told my friend mr beast”   The biggest flex in the video
Why would you not turn this elephant toothpaste upside down and make a rocket version?
POV:u finally find our why elephant toothpaste is called elephant toothpaste            CUZ U HEAR A ELEPHANT WHEN IT COMES OUT
How do you clean all those Elephant Toothpaste??
In the 10:04 it's like the universe is explode
🤣
if i was in the tube i would feal like I BEILIVE I CAN FLY I BELIVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY
It went really high
Every part about this is just absolutely amazing. Incredible
Is it possible to ride the toothpaste if it’s shot upwards?
Thank You and everyone that helped! This is what humanity needs more of
Nothing but awesome 🔥
gg
this is cool, and i love this, but mark..... i want squirell parkour course 2, or bait package part 4
December 1st be like:
This video is amazing from start to finish.
You should change the title in "we finally did it"
Absolutly insane
🐐
Props to the cameraman inside the toothpaste
Engineers have invested vast effort to design, build and test efficient rocket combustion chambers.
Experimonto⬆️
Not all HERO'S wear capes
How Mark is the biggest child in the whole video ;)
So epic, hope they had a fun time
I hope y'all were vaccinated so this wasn't a super spreader party.
I thought my mind was tricking me because the original was red but this one was green
Always love your optimism <3
PUT A HELMET ON PLZ
2:33 proleter, i see.
Was the benefactor for the jet mr beast lol
So much wastage
Wow its been a year since the first vid.
Just imagine how fun it would be if Mark was your uncle... 😌
Lethamyr into music at 11 min lol
Mark Rober is the GOAT
Waaaoowww, that's... AMAZING!
the yellow one reminded me of egg
so can i brush my teeth with it
Pog
Very cool 😎
But why.
Marky is the nicest bastard
Imagine they chose option 1😂
Build a elephant toothpaste rocket next.
Wow this is insane!!!!!😃😃😃🤣🤣🤣
This guy is legit!!!
Lethamrys intro in the middle threw me off
Mark, you bring so much joy to so many people. Massive congratulations to you and all of the willing volunteers for making so many dreams come true.
Aww thats soo generous. Pure soul😇
Pog champ it got #2 on trending
I sure do
Who wants to be this guys uncle
Alright which elephant is going to use it
Mark roblox
People like you make science more fun 😁 ❤️
you are amazing Mark!
It looks animated
how do you even clean al this stuff up
I which i was there  so much
Mark is one of my biggest inspirations in life
Thanks to cameraman's for thoose shots!
Lemme guess, this video costed at least 3 dollars to make
Mark is the GOAT
Why don’t you dig a huge hole and Make the devils reaction in the ground
Id be interested in someone figuring out the catalyst
But... the force you feel pushing on a fully inflated football depends how hard you push against it... that's not at all a reliable unit of measure lol...
Amazing😍 Thankyou for being such a great guy
@12:53 🙂
I was waiting for Karen
That thing could fight godzilla
It's *_impossible_* to watch this video without smiling! ^_^
Cool 😎 can you please do another costume video?
such a beautiful masterpiece
This was so much fun, I hafta go back and watch again...
The drone shots where f***ing amazing!!!
Mark Rober makes my heart smile 😊
And another day of watching resource wasting americans
How is your soon
My boi flusher
You have way too much fun making your videos!  I love this channel.
13:15 , when you had too much taco bell:
If you're trying to win world's coolest uncle, you can stop, you already won that contest a million times over. The memories these kids will have ahhh so jealous of that Mark Rober sponsored  childhood. Please invent time travel and throw all my birthday parties past and future.
This was a wonderful video and Brody absolutely deserves this amazing gift, but what precautions were taken around the current pandemic? With all of the people helping out from the local town, with all of the kids, especially immuno-suppressed children, I'd like to hear what was done to ensure everyone's safety. I'm not trying to sound pessimistic, but I kept worrying about what might happen if someone asymptomatically carrying the disease showed up.
Hes Crazzy!
12:20 the only part most people have some to see, you're welcome.
I thought I was re-watching the same video again
What elephant need that much toothpaste is having worst teeth in the world
But why would you do it
Omg cooooool
I just want to say, it's people like you who make this world a better place and it's nice to see a great person like you working hard to make sure that everyone has a great time.
What’s tha-
You guys are epic for doing this 🤘🤘🤘
EPICCC
When life gives you watermelons sell em and become a millionaire
Drives Tesla.  Flies on private jet.  Bruh.
Why?
this for gigantic elephant
Letss goo
14:15, should be reviewed by pewdiepie and listed in one of the worst high-fives XD
When I heard the song at 11:00 I low key thought I was watching a lethamyr video
Mark, you are seriously a source of happiness, engineering, science and kindness. Please never change. ❤️
✌🏻
Seeing this in lockdown:
Hey are you gonna clean that up?
Awesome work as always :) Love your videos. Was wondering if you have ever thought of teaming up with others to create actual curriculum type series' that could be used to engage and educate kids in homeschool settings or even traditional school settings? I think it would be amazing if people like you who present things in such an engaging way were to do this to get more kids interested in science. Keep up the great videos !!!
When your job was making rovers at NASA and now you need to do elephant paste.
i thought i already watched this lol
in like 30 years mark's son will do the same exact thing
White kids have wealth
You inspired me to be an engineer mark and I will not let you down
13.52 Americans really hate the metric system.
epicc
Awesome videos! 😊
Why does this look like a Hollywood movie?
I love how I don’t understand anything
Is it me or can I hear at 7:51 ”doing your mom” at a faster pace or is that just me?
That’s such a great thing to do I’m amazed at your kindness
Incredible !!!
Ah yes, *child labor*
When do you film these videos I live next to gridley
And they say science people are boring. Lamao
Bro this is like a child’s dream come true, this lowkey made my day and night and made me cry a bit🙏🏼💯
7:40 im gonna act like i didnt see that
remake of the other video ngl
How is this such a beautiful masterpiece
1 day
*"About 50x the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football"*  What did he sayyyyy
Itna paisa hy in logon k pas yr
No one else bothered about the fact he’s filming on his phone while driving a car full of children?? Gotta do it for the content I suppose
Dude, that was *epic*.  Just flat epic.
9:39 AND 14:20 DID THOSE DUMMIES SURVIVED?
Seeing how much joy you can bring to these kids is beautiful. You were made for this
I'm in love with your videos. Much love ❤❤
Thank you for... well, being you.
How
14:14 that was awkward
Random fact : Mark is working on a new project
Not again
6.9mil views
No wordss ..   that was fabb
It will decrease fertility of soil 😐
Mark rober might have one of the best youtube channel arcs wow inspiration (This comment aged like fine wine)
எவ்ளோ பெரிய புஸ்வானம் 😱😱💚
This is what we thought Volcano Eruptions looked like and its now true
His neighbors and nephews are so lucky to have him
Daaaaaammmmm your craziest youtuber ever🔥🔥🔥
We finally found gavin
The eruption was so frickin satisfying don't you think
Wow, they must be glad to have survived being that close to a Toothpaste Volcano. After all, they did just brush with death.
I love your videos
I wish I was there
7:29 hopefully YouTube demonetisation-rules don’t take into account that Mark is flipping off every Brit watching this
Lowkey the best YouTuber
Mark is an amazing human being
Wow
He went from trying to become the best uncle to becoming the worlds new science uncle
Looks like a lot of pollution.
Someone please explain to me where the heck Mark Rober gets all the money for these NASA-quality experiments
Now imagine the height gain if you added rifling to the barrel of the flask 🤓
His videos get better and better
Very pleasant BUT very far...VERY far from my life.
Camera and editing was amazing
Yay new vid
Mark Rober I have a challenge for you bring back 2014 again
That just looks incredible 🎉
imagine watching this entire concept with Mark on irl
Mr. Rober making kids’ days absolutely EPIC! I love it!
PROLETER HAS MADE IT TO THE BIG LEAUGUES MY GUYS, MINECRAFT YOUTUBERS, AND NOW MARK FREAKING ROBER!!!!!!
What is the recipe for devil's toothpaste
Hi
No birds were harmed in this video, they both dodged the toothpaste by 9 feet
Why did you post this on Father’s Day
Yes
The hulk signal
Yellowstone be like : huh ?!
Wait... What happens if you flip it upside down, would it fly up like a rocket???
Pov: you drop your water
Crazy rap colt 45 rythem casually playing in the background be like
15:53 This is so important 🥺
I will say i loved the video but what happened to flechers record did it get overridden or did Brody get a different record
Mark Rober, your videos are inspirational, heartwarming, intriguing, educational, concise and incredibly well executed. This was my favorite video yet, it totally topped my excitement when I watched your original elephant toothpaste party. THANK YOU!   I love that you do your best to help those down on their luck. We should all do the same, then no one would be down!
Those slo-mo shots were incredible!!😁😁
Quality content
Wow. You are just fking awesome. Thank you for what you do for these kids.
been waiting for this one
Mark... You are an incredible human 🙏
I would laugh so hard if the flask just shoots into the air
0:00
I'm most proud it didn't go through the bottom
Problem : How do you clean the orbeez? Since it is not biodegradable thus not eco friendly to the environment
Someone like so I can see this video again
We need something like elephant toothpaste but for fire retardant dropped from planes, unless of course the stuff they drop now has a similar expanding effect (but I don't think it does)
legend
me when taco bell
Mark rober farmin those uncle points
This video is going to be big in the next few days! ☝️
I am more interested in knowing how they cleaned it up and disposed of it(because global warming y’all)
Yeah boiiii
He gave his wish to another kid because that kids wish got stolen... Are you kidding me?! He's a MUCH better person then 99% of the adults I've met in my life already... What a little champion!
Yoo that was a crazy I hope I could be there with you all time in that video. You are a legend.
Ay yo fam
it was worth the wait
Go to 12:50
I'm lost of worlds
I'm.not a person that would like this type of stuff but watching your videos are making me wanna look into everything you do it's amazing 🎉
Imagine what the animals where thinking 😂
I used to live close to Gridley. I would have been so willing to help if I still lived there. Keep up the amazing work!
Wow thats so cool!!
What’s holding that line of flags up in the air @13:34? Is this the line they used to measure the total height?
Once again you prove yourself to be the best YouTuber on the platform. It’s so generous what you do for these kids! Great video at Allways👍
Useless world record
A
You made my day
me:huh so thats what that werid green thing in the sky was alien's:it hit my f***ing space ship
Kid eat that toothpaste already
child labor
In 20 years, 22 kid’s helping you to make another birthday party
But who noticed the rare time where Mark is without his hat?
Omg
So glad you redo this flask! The last video with Fletcher was my son’s favorite and he watched it no less than 50 times. Now we got a new video to watch 😂
Mr beast of science
whoever was operating the drone need a hefty raise
lethamyr intro? lmao
ok now what pressure do you feel when you push against a football
finally
You magnificent, mad, incredibly kind bastard.
Ima need that girl on the planes snap rn mark help me out
If ur wondering what song this is at 7:20 it’s Jinji Beats on my way
12:50
Is it just me or did you guys guess that it would be a private jet
is it hot?
That's not a human that's a dog
You're epic
Thanks to the person who generously lent out his private jet. 👍
He has so much money because he does not buy he's things he makes he's things
Is it methane?
What about people no rocket ships…
Bro mark’s upload schedule is 2 videos per year…..he doesnt follow the rules
Is that the yfz450r quad
All the dad's would love to see the clean up videos.  =D
What an ending ❤
Brody exactly look like Bugha
Wait , the flask is space shuttle of Doraemon The Movie Nobita's Little Space War
Amazing
Can everyone explain how to make elephants toothpaste and if your experience makings one does it hot when it explode
Love the videos and all, but isn't that stuff toxic af?
Love the videos and all, but isn't that stuff toxic af?
We love you Brody stay healthy
Påppåååå
W
Lpp
"And that's your sister..." oh thanks Mark.
Oh that flask is sturdy af
if ur friend drafts leonard fournette w his first round pick he is losing.
You did it again. The private jet is not in your budget. That was funny. It's really awesome the things you do to help people. You have one of the most positive attitudes on YouTube. I would love to be able to do things like this for people. Keep up the great work you do and stay safe out there.
Fun fact: 25℅ of Mark voices in the is video voice cracks
Green snow
what an absolute delight of a video !!
Ain't the kid with glasses the kid from it
Epic video as always
AMLO? 1:49
12:47
Respect for the legendary Brody💪
bruh op editing and camera shots love your vids
Every kid needs mark rober in their lives. Xoxo!!!!!
If Mark Rober is doing this much to be the favorite Uncle, then what is the other one doing?!
They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should
Me on December 1st
Mark can u be my science teacher?
I wonder if it's possible to make the elephant toothpast erupt higher by making the top smaller increasing the pressure making it explode higher
Is it called Elephant toothpaste because its big? or the fact it also sound like an actual elephant ? 13:00
Mark is the epitome of an angel
Mark is definitely one of God's go-to guys. The difference he makes in these kid's lives is awesome.  I{ can't wait to see what his future brings.
who else skipped thru the vid to see the result?
Jeff, the town's welder : "How big do you want your flask Mark ?" Mark : yes.
this is why mark rober is the best youtuber in the entire world. not only is he actually interesting to watch but mark you have helped me with so many of lifes challenges i really do thank you for that.
Dam mark you are impressive. For real I'm not being sarcastic
imagine the kid died as they were building this
13:40 proof americans will do anything to avoid using the metric system. fwiw, i am american.
That is awesome! 😁
mr beastttttttt
Well executed ♥️
Just insane holy moly
That was so epic
1:53 Thats Ragnar Lothbrok
Make the exit a venturi and reduce the diameter for more height.
Is eve devil real ?
This warms my heart. It’s great when wonderful people like Mark are rewarded with wild success!  Congrats Mark and thank you for being so awesome!
My name's also Brody. Was doing some work when I heard him say it. Was kinda surprised for a second.
This is brilliant! Cue the build montage.
honest to goodness looks CG. surreal
Like, who has Mr Brasts number?
❤️
Ladies and Gentlemen he did it
The lure thickens
Wore me beast 2:0
Why is there a commodities shortage? Mark Rober: nooo idea
Everyone about the toothpaste but bro give fletcher creddit,kids a mad lad and doesnt event get mad that his party was worse or get gelous  Its like an rare candy in 1/10000
13:45 Mark: The pressure inside the flask was 50 times that of a fully inflated football Americans: wow, that's amazing!  Non-Americans: wait.. What??
looking at the last toothpaste "failure" made me think... what if you built an elephant's toothlaste rocket ship? 🧐🧐🧐
Jeez...I'm already trying not to cry and I'm only 90 seconds in...🥺  Edit: Yup...16:13 🥲
Mr beast but its not
Hey mark. Have a nice day dude!
yes.
That was the most anticlimactic thing I have ever sat through.
So awesome!
Lol heard lethamyrs intro music in here
Is a always protect philippines🇵🇭♥️🇺🇲
Wait he gave us the recipe to devils toothpaste after telling us he wouldnt
If first you don’t succeed, reengineer and try again!
This was incredible. I don’t have the words to express myself. Mark, thank you for doing this.
Mark rober i like you to making stuff i want to like your videos i live in the philippines🇵🇭
Love this one
THIS IS WHY WE LOVE HIM❤️💕
Kids version of Project X
Honestly mark, your editing is amazing.
Next video: Are use devils toothpaste to go to the moon
Next time, flip it upside down and make a rocket
What is Elephant toothpaste?
See how high you can thrust a rocket powered by elephant toothpaste
Life would be a blast if Mark Rober was my uncle
If I had to guess based off the reaction of the devil's toothpaste he is using some sort of fluorine compound.  Just a guess though, if he is then that is probably why he isn't giving out the instructions with because it is one of the most reactive elements on the periodic table and many people have set themselves on fire experimenting with it.  Just search around for FOOF (Dioxygen difluoride) or ClF3 (Chlorine Trifluoride) and you'll get an idea of why he wouldn't want to share the formula for whatever catalyst he is using in his devil's toothpaste.
The last video I was like interesting but now I’m like why do I have a life like that
"About 50 times the pressure you'd feel when pressing against a football." Why will Americans use any way of measuring something except for metric?
நீ  வேற லெவல் யா
Will This toothpaste go to space? Will it be The first elephant toothpaste that can into space? _Who knows!_   Elok musk : My Time to shine
Nice shots mr rober
One day I wish I could meet mrbeast
The foam is probably bad for the pool filter but who cares that looks so FUN
Mark-climate change is a big problem Mark-private jet
Clean it!!
Wow, I can’t believe 5.2 thousand people’s fingers slipped
The “secret” ingredient in his devils toothpaste is potassium iodide dissolved  in water
Is it just me or is there a fire truck at 9:44
This video literally brought me to tears and is taking everything to hold it back. It's genuinely heart wrenching to see how kind people can be to other's, especially kids who deserve everything, and get exactly that.. 😭😭😭😭😭
I was not very interested about this one but it turned out to be one of my favs!
is this bad for the environment?
Bless you and your family for showing these kids so much love.
GG
Simply amazing. Well done sir 👍🏽
Brody is an absolute legend and deserved this completely. Thanks for doing this, Mark! If heaven does or doesn't exist, you'll be flying up there on a rocket powered by elephant toothpaste one day. (although you'll probably figure out immortality in your lifetime) Legend.
We love you Mark. Don't ever stop.
Now you need it to come out the bottom 😛
"My friend, Mr. Beast" wait w h a t t t??? I love how chill mark is about mentioning that lol
Words cannot describe the epic ness of this video
more fun in one day than i've had in my whole life D:
What is a bird got hit
How do his videos keep getting better and better
Gotta love that music from Lethamyr’s intro in the orbees pool scene.😂
Hi
That's a super spreader event if i have ever seen one.
When the hulk gets that lovin feelin...
Have fun cleaning it up lol
Mark is basically Bill Nye on crack
You could make a volcano

You are a legend Mark. Love how you use your talents to give back
👍
11:07 lethamyr where u at
Epik

Orbeez can be a choking hazard.
The cinematics on this video is insane. What a way to experience the whole thing.
boring.
coolest video EVER!!!!!!
yo the shots in this video are amazing wow
Coolest uncle ever 😎
mans the greatest uncle
BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!! WOOOOW!!!
My ATV got stolen 2 months ago it was a Honda Fourtrax 300 and a trailer with 2 other mini bikes on it but you gotta keep ur head high and not let people get in the way of ur dreams or projects.
I thought I already watched this last year am I having dejavu?
Crap, to think we found our volcano science projects in school cool...
Skulling some arrowhead waters with the boys
I wonder if elephants actually use elephants toothphase
these videos are so boring compared to your usual even though it took way more work lol.
What up mr grease
Lethamyr is that you??? 11:18
The kind psychology ethnopharmacologically puncture because floor impressively travel before a nebulous refund. extra-large extra-small exuberant, intelligent sphynx
That was incredible!
I live about 15min from the place they got the jet. McClellan AFB
This is so amazing and heartwarming
Lol not a single non-white person in this video.
Mark has gone from backyard science to full blown industrial scale projects, having to lay concrete and weld together the project is actually insane, the forces involved are absolutely ridiculous. Congratulations!
look closely at the drone 13:18
🖤✨💙❤️‍🔥
why so many white people only?
Next video on Glitterbomb 4.0
I don't get what is fun in that but i like it
Dude you are a freaking NASA engineer, use metric alonside imperial!
Mark and the beast are FREINDS?!?!?! EPIC!!!!!!!!
Unbelievable, I had a smile the entire time. Awesome video. Thank you.
Again!!!
Great. I believe this video has the best montage ever in your channel.
Cool.
Team Rober is amazing.  Great video and  great people.
me when ur mom
Gives be prank patrol vibes
When your middle school science fair project gets out of hand...
Mark Rober is the Dr. Stone of our lifetime.
13:01 that sounds like a party popper autoshooting
Those are wise words Robert but I have better. When life gives you lemons you burn the house down with it.
Quick share this
12:51 thank me later
Mark is best birthday planner ever
Awesome  I want to be a NASA engineer to
13:01 no wonder there called elephant toothpaste.
Mark you are by far the nicest guy on the internet! I love what you do for this world keep it up!
That is so epic lol 😂 I love how you go above and beyond! Those kids are lucky🙌🏽
11:29 yo Lethamyr’s intro song
Mr. Rober, you don't know me but, thank you. You've truly made an impact with this, not in the scale of the elephant toothpaste, but the people you've entertained and helped.   Some want to go down in history, others want to be remembered. I honestly believe you will achieve these and so much more. People will be speaking of you for years and years to come.   So from one small voice on the internet, and a fan, thank you so much for sharing your wonderful mind and person with us. Keeping being awesome.   Respect.
Nurk almost got hit by the trashcan lol that could have been a lot worse
I remember when that last one failed. Then I saw this and thought. Why should we stop here?
Why do I feel like most likely someone's going to figure out how to make devil's toothpaste eventually
Your the reason i want to be an engineer
Brody😍
Yes finally!!! The world record!!!!!!!
Mark, Thank You for doing what you do... Many Blessing to you and all..
What I thought I was going to watch: haha cool foam go poof What I ended up watching: your birthdays suck
Can we take take the time to appreciate the time it took for this
teacher: create the elephant toothpaste experiment you:
This is heavy
wow mr.rober you really outdid yourself here on this video such an aspiring message and such family friend quality amazing content on top of such a generous great video  while breaking another world record, I  bet these kids will remember this for decades to come. love the videos
Wow
the children seized the means of production
How long did the devils tooth paste take to clean up
I was wondering if you were gonna try to fix the support issue
I thought I was watching Lethamyr when it got to the orbies 😅
When life gives u brains launch elephant toothpaste into space..
Holy crap he's plugging Draftkings?! But not mentioning the fact that they have NFT? Whaaay
i played soccer with fletcher on my team and my dad coached him
The volcano looks like NASA's Gemini capsule from the 60s
Make a rocket or something powered by elephant toothpaste or devils toothpaste
The thing I have got to be most amazed by is the food coloring. How can such a small amount of liquid make so much volume of color!!
7:01 I KnEw It WaS GoNnA bE a (LiMbO)
Where are the splinters in half of the kids from the WOODEN slip and slide?
Now we need a glow in the dark one
this is so cool
11:53 noo not the foot!
20% bigger needs to be 20x bigger
at this point i cant guess what mark will do next. hes such a kind and generous guy, i really love to watch his videos mostly because of how fun, scientific, and entertaining. the fact that it got so popular in that amount of time that the mayor of the town came to the party, insane. truly madness, love your videos dude.
Idc that they’re kids, Mark knows how to throw an f’in party 😂
Dude it's like u came from another planet and u came to make incredible things ur the best
You have the coolest job in the world.
Why not just use a tank to make that chamber?
cleaning it up
When life gives you lemons... It gives back your lemon
:)
Major credit to all your drone operators, camera operators and video editors, the shots you've been getting in your videos lately are amazing, easily on par with some of the worlds best cinemaphotographers, its been really cool to watch, and I mean, the stuff you do in your videos is amazing too, but this level of production is just as interesting to see.
Quality content.period.
Watching this in school on my birthday, life is great 😎
Must be nice to live your dream life..... well, back to mine i guess... amazing 17 minutes and 8 seconds tho
R.i.p the dummy:(
2:37 whats the song called?
"The force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football". I don't even know what that means. Can we just get it in PSI?
Wow so cool
(Everybody liked that)
Editing is fireeeeee
Am i the only person that finds it hilarious that mark mentions tom brady at the end and "COINCIDENTALLY references the psi of a FULLY inflated football to describe the amount of pressure the pushed through the flask? Lol. Maybe im drawing parallels that aren't actually there lol
Go Saints
Fletcher's sister gotta Snapchat though?🤔
i love your vids
Alguém precisa avisar o Iberê
👍
This was wholesome af bro
It looks like slime from Nickelodeon
This makes me want to be terminally ill ngl
Mark Rober, single-handedly boosting small-town economies since 2020.
Hi
A real inspiration
Me after edging for two weeks  Her: come over
12:52 Is this what "hierophant green requiem" would be if kakyoin didnt get a donut

Love this video! Why was it named slime before?
On a real note mark this video is great

This guy gives the same amount of serotonin as puppies

im just impressed someone counted all those orbees

okay but is it nuke proof
🤔 So, have you actually declined working for spacex? There's no way Elon hasn't already asked you tp come n work at "the shop", your scopes are nicely out of the box. It'd be a nice learning experience 😊
🥚
R.I.P that truck though
That kid in the bass pro shop hat is literally dressed the exact same way as the dude who just hit and ran me and my girlfriend.
I would last about two days before completely abandoning the project lol
The ones who did the videography, drone footage, and editing all need a raise! This is such a great video!
imagine this guy being your uncle
Too kind of you!
Another increase in quality from Mark Rober
Now this is the experiment I want to do in my science class💀
Yey!!!!!
Dumbest video
only a matter of time until mark breaks his own record again
Mark Rober, Mr. Beast and Yes Theory should all colab togeather?!!
poggers bro nice vid
i feel sry fr u fr cleaning all this😂
Bro you are the dopest guy out here.
I have done the math and have figured out that Mark Rober should have about 7.8x more subscribers.
That’s a lot of money I will be watching this till the end
wai
Look forward to Mark Rober videos each month! 👏🏻
6.6M views in 1 day sheesh that's crazy

I can’t say anything but Nice!
Just saying, you can definitely throw my next birthday party so ya…
I wish u were my uncle
10000 pounds of steel ... that'll put a dent in the budget.
my uncle whenever I go to his house:
now build a rocket that uses this as fuel so it shoots out the toothpaste as it launches.
physics simulator 2.0
The Tesla fanboyism is gross

Hey mark rober how long did this took
The wholesomeness of this channel is just insane, I wish I could have been there to help out!
Your videos are the best
Please answer back to me.
The buzzing of the drone sounded like an elephant.
Masterpiece
I feel sorry for those abused mannequins.
Next time you do elephant toothpaste you should do it through toilets. Please make the toilet rainbow. If you ever do make a video with elephant toothpaste coming out of toilets.
AMAZING
Fact:  Mark Rober is one of the nicest guys on the internet.
What kind of person gives a thumbs down to a video like this???? Amazing job Mark, as always!
what’s that girls @
What the heck did I just stumble into.  ?!?!   That was amazing !!!
Epic
Eyyyyyyyyyyy I love it
Thats awesome I'm from that area too
Hi
He easily has the best film crew ever
That is so true, because they just want to have youtube view,  plus they never experienced with the chemical and engineer.
I think this is actually awesome but whoever is cleaning up all this elephant toothpaste is a G
I love it
Was that NurkFPV flying his squirt drone?
I literally just watched his video from last year and he releases this now… what a weird synchronicity…
Imagine cleaning 😅lol
You inspire my faith in humanity
Hi Mark, please watch, 8 years of Bumetanide  use to treat autism, on YouTube. Then his other videos. Read his blog that has over two million views.  I think you will like it.
Lol nice
What modal ATV did the kid get?
Cal Fire guys: "Best...shift...ever."
Did you have to pay another $13,000 to Guineas for this one as well?
What an inspiration
Imagine being this dudes neighbor
The +1 uncle point makes me laugh so hard everytime i think of it!
ThAt was incredibly amazing

Mark Rober is by far my favorite youtuber of all time!!!!! All his videos are amazing and informative. He also is always doing cool things for others and that is amazing
This was a really Epic!!! Video!!!
The orbeez pool is like every kids dream.
mans flow was wild
Last Year when I saw that the experiment didn't work well, I knew this video was up and had been anticipating.....finally.....inner Peace :)
20 second build montages are the best
12:53
i swear Mark's dedication is unlike any other 🤷‍♀️
If this guy is doing this jind of party for a child only, how is his kind of adult party🤔😏
Hey... you should really try to make a Walter rocket engine using your "devil's toothpaste" mixture... It could lead to some interesting results
The hot lava volcano a flash fire anteriorally project
The quality shots you got 👏🏼
I really like this. I wanna do what you do
I cried watching this. So wholesome. You and Mr Beast are the best.
What’s that girls @ ?? For a Freind :)

That was incredible, mark rober is the best!!
You are such an incredible person. Seriously. The world is such a better place.
That is a great video
Legit that kid deserved every second of that. Absolutely amazing to see that so many people still do the things that keep our hope stable in humanity!!!!!

Your taking it
Im always weirded out by grown men hanging with children lol but this is wholesome
He did it again. The madlad did it yet again…  *…and did it even better than ever before*
4:30 I thought his hand was on fire 🔥
This is what you get when destroy build destroy and dude what would happen had a kid
Probably was cheaper to build it in steel then wood nowadays 😂
Wowsers
I feel bad for the small flower that was encompassed by the devil's toothpaste blast.
Mr beast!!!!
all these comments talking about how nice mark is; which is true.. but that kid gave his only wish for someone else to get the ATV that was stolen from them. more people should be talking about that.
Uh captain I’m here I space and uhhh I see like elephant toothpaste and it’s coming for the ship we have a problem..
what happens to all the stuff around that elephant paste? like how do you clean it all up?
I love the part where he did nothing with the tooth paste for the starting 8:12
Best uncle ever?
Awww this is a lovely video.
12:51 when they actually do it.
LOL this is an environmentalists nightmare 💀
What teachers think will happen when a boy sees a girls shoulder: 13:01
Why your friends are youtuber not a single tension freak normal routine guy 😜
My teeth are clean forever.

I love these videos but gosh darnit, stop making me tear up
the hulk after November

My future kid: Daddy I hate science......😑 Me: you haven't met Mark Rober yet😂💥
My jaws was dropped!!!!
I like how mark rober just steals kids every year
My future kid: Daddy I hate science......😑 Me: you haven't met Mark Rober yet😂💥
it's great when Mark Rober posts
As always, impressive and the world is a better place with you and people like these kids in it.
That record will hold a lot longer!!
Still number 2 trending... Wow
cool
Anyone else thought lethamyr's video started playing?
The joy you repeatedly bring to kids (of ALL ages) is incredible! Keep up the wonderful work!
Insanity!
The fact that mark rober has the brain power to break many world records, instead of using that knowledge privately, he helps other people and make people happy, it’s incredible
11:28 Cue the Lethemyr intro music 😎😎!!! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS MARK ROBER!! You are the best!!
The production quality of this video is through the room! Incredible 😎
Imagine Being Marks Neighbor...
Snowbird shirt is dope!
Who can yell the loudest  Mark Rober vs  all the kids  Mark Rober wins
🍋
You have grown so much since I started watching you!
What was the air pressure and humidity at the time of launch?   I say launch as anything that high is a launch - amazing stuff and well played.
wow I really don’t have words
That flask can be also be rental for gender reveals
You are an incredible human being Mark.  The science you do is awesome but the amazing things you do for others is what sets you above the rest.
Vah Rita had some allergies
Wowzers!!!
Mark is using science to make a kid happy. I respect that.
Fletcher representing Snowbird! Heck yeah!
My daughter would absolutely love a pool full of water beads.
Faith in humanity has been restored
I love how The town has every worker skill enough to do those stuff
dude i remember watching Mark when i was alot younger and i am so proud to see how much he has grown as the internets #1 uncle
I need Mark Rober as my uncle 😭
rECIPE FOR dEvILS TP: potassium iodide or yeast, hydrogen peroxide, and soap
So you helped mr Beast to break your record and then now you broke mr Beast’s record
I love the1+ uncle point lol
How to keep a world record never tell anybody how you make the devils toothpaste
The thing I wait for a Month
Anyone else thinking of the elephant toothpaste episode from later simpsons?
This would be #1 on trending
Mark was upset Brody didn't wish for infinite wishes, so he arranged it himself.
The fact that u made that kids day out does anything else u do with science. My nephew was. A MAW recipient and got a dog. Think of this…ur last wish of ur life is to do something for someone else??? You’d have to be pretty special for sure!!! Thanks Mark for sharing!!!
This was so tall that it would reach the head of the statue of liberty from the BOTTOM of the pedestal. That's absolutely incredible...
Kid was probably expecting a Lambo when he saw MrBeast hahaha.
yesn’t
Just WOW!
This is so wholesome 😭
Hello
DP: *gets world record with 5$ basket ball* Mark: You need at least 10k for it to be cool
Omg 1 day ago!!!
“When life gives you lemons… build a 5 ton flask and blast them to space.” Quote of the year
What if he built a small rocket that uses devil’s toothpaste to get into the air    Hmm
Who else just watches his videos while waiting for him to post even if you have seen all his vids?
7:44 foam daddy got me thinking
When the top trending video second to MrBeast, contains a cameo from MrBeast
Mark Rober is like that one nerd who seems weird but is actually really cool and nice
when the giant elephant toothpaste shot out it actually sounded like an elephant’s trumpet
Fletcher doesnt look happy when Brody is talking to MrBeast
all the other elephant toothpaste competitors after watching this: *ah S**t here we go again"
nickelodeon should of hired Mark Rober
It is like the history of mark Rogers best videos, all over again
How to set up a building 101 13:11
This video is AWESOME!
Mr beast did it and I hate it
wow
i am a stjude child so i now what those kids are going through i am so happy you are giving them a better life
Your video past on the Quebec news 😮
Is any of this stuff biodegradable?
Is that Cantonese song bgm? 😆
Ah yes *Child Labor*
Outstanding.
Evrytimes he says this is the biggest thootpast, evert 2 months he is coming with a bigger one
Rober = Dad Goals
Cool
9:58 cursed cheese
Amazing 🔥🔥
The edits are just on another level
How about the ecological impact of this experiment? This doesn't look like "organic"....
Threw me off randomly hearing Leth’s intro music in the middle of this.
I.. am… speechless….
*I used child labour, but it's funny*
Those drone shots were BEAUTIFUL 🤩
Imagine seeing that giant green elephant toothpaste and thinks that’s strange or it’s your everyday sky
can you make an edited version that's just the science bits and nothing about the kids or the party?
Y does 7:20 look like a teailet for a movie
what happened to your submarine video i cant find it
Next time put a dummy on top of the tube and see it get launched
Can you ever touch that stuff or is it too hot
this is a really weird way to stimulate a local economy. But I dig it
as a wider I would have loved to weld that out...
I don’t think this dudes vids can get much better
4:18 then scream XXDDDDD
This was wholesome
Is his sister single though?
Mark Rober needs to always be remembered in the history books, what a guy
Next video I filled the entire earth with elephant toothpaste ft mrbeast
This is truly incredible
So nostalgic
This is absolutely awesome
His wallet after this😭
U made me love science <3
In another year, mark rober is going to give the record to another kid
mark is the person you would expect to not spend 50m dollars on himself, but would spend it on his relatives
Brb crying
THATTTTTTSS LIYTTTT U DESERVE ITTTTTTT I LOOVVEVEVEYUUUU
I wish there was more diversity in the people he invites to his property
If I was shirtless while talking to me beast I would be so disappointed with myself
The private jet was definitly out of Mark's bud jet
I NEED to go back in time and go to that epic party.
speechless
Hey Mark you weird Mormon, I dug up some gold plates in my back yard.  When can you make it over so I can read them to you out of a hat?
Im a super big fan
OMG your like the best uncle ever hands down
That was amazing! I kept watching this video on repeat.
you restore my faith in humanity
Rip to the birds
Can we throw grenades in that flask
12:46 your welcome
"Foam Daddy"
the kids’ reactions were priceless! Amazing video mark! <3
Your an amazing person, such a kind soul, it's lovely to see how many kind people you brought together and Brodie, hope you and Fletcher are keeping well.
Pog mark bober
Amazing
When you link your next video could you make it where you make Mala things that we usually make cuz if he's make bolognese if you make smaller things that they need usually do I can make some little baby sit like that too
Awesome!!!!!
This guy is building every kid’s fantasy

MARK WHY YOU GOTTA ALWAYS MAKE ME CRY
76,2 meter woow
Wonder what would have happened if you were in the the beaker
My generation had Nickelodeon Studios and this generation has Mark Rober. 👍🏽
When life gives you people like Mark Rober and Mr Beast, be happy that many people gain a happier life due to these people Also 4th on trending as a whole, well done
I don’t care about a sad story I just want to see the Exciting part
WOW
Well done Mark..
Ultra kitsch content
That's awesome
nice job
mans used lethamyr intro song
Karma in action. Love it. Thank you, Mark!
Mark might be among the best people in the world. I've lost a lot of faith in humanity over the years but he's repeatedly reminded me that not all of us are awful.
When I was 8, I was a Make-A-Wish kid and I honestly feel like a wasted my wish on a trip to Disney, which I literally just did when I was five. I wish I could've actually helped someone else like Brody did instead of not even fully appreciating the opportunity I was given.
you should do the flask with Devils Toothpaste
Congrats!!!
Is this plastic? Will this cause unnecessary environmental pollutions?
"was 50 times the force you feel pushing against a fully inflated football" what kind of measurement is that. Are we just supposed to know what that means?
11:28 All my Lethamyr boys say what?????
Did anyone catch that squeal that mark had let out before the launch at 12:50???
Amazing
Its amazing how much mark rober spend so much for his projects 👏👏👏😯😯😯
Thanks for making the world a better place my dude.
Yo! Nice job Nurkfpv
Is that stuff okay for the environment?
10:29 Mr. Drone got in some of the action.  ZIP
HOW did you get that AWESOME 3-D of the tootpaste ?
If the squirrel videos didn't already have me convinced, you're a great person.
The Car:  It's time.
12:52 is when it happens
12:38
Aghhhh build montages
Happens at 12:51. Your welcome
I always enjoy your vids, but this one, my friend, is amazing. That was a nice kid, too. He didn't have to give, but he did and he earned this party with his ❤. 👏 to you BOTH!
noice
This video has to be one of the most wholesome. I was smiling the entire time, thanks! 👍
This was incredible
I love those cool people in the waiting room
*Discreetly moves into Mark's neighborhood*
Absolutely amazing
We had play-dough when i was a kid. You should see our VHS montages
I love it when people do really nice things like this
I thought you alrdy did this????
aewwwwwwwwwwwww
Hello everybody If you're interested in investing  or would like to browse a wider range of funds, see through sectrade-option, or you would like to talk to us about investing kindly send me a DM
Everyone give a like for Brody
Still not high enough.
Why do you let kids stand in the smoke of a reaction with hydrogen peroxide?  This is highly polluting especially when you inhale that smoke
Editing skills are amazing props to whoever did it 👌
如果再加点氦气
What was the thing called foam daddy-
If the reaction from first flask had enough force to propel it into the air…. Could elephant toothpaste launch a rocket? How high could it go?
your kind of a saint bro
It’s really cool to let the young kids swim for hours in a pool filled to the rim with polymers! You are such a wise and genuine guy Mark
7:49 I like the subtle reverse footage.
Half the video: *drone noises*
I have a third comment cuz I like commenting. Mark Rober if you see this comment can I in all seriousness hire you for a birthday party or something?
So cool I wish I was there
THE VIEWS IN ONE DAY
That was more epic than epicniss than himself
I love your videos!
Anybody else kinda feel bad for the other kid who had to watch his world record be broken?
#2 on trending nice!
Hit that like
This is impossible to watch without a smile!
So where do all the orbies go after?
The fact that anyone gave this video a thumbs down is beyond me. This was magic in the making and made people's day if not year. You can't take away memories. No matter how many thumbs down you click. Great video!
Taco bell simulator
That blasted as high as the Super Shot ride
some ppl would go just enough to beat a record. Mark Rober goes just enough + 80 tons of steel and 20x bigger to beat a record
Dang spends years doing this so we enjoy this  You made my day :)
i either need to become a science youtuber so i can do crazy stuff like this, or i could be mark's partner and do crazy stuff with him.
B
We need more people in this world like you
Mark Rober and Mr Beast are probably some of my favorite YouTubers next to Viva La Dirt. Love the engineering, the message and the overall quality and thought behind the videos. Keep doing amazing things.
Mark I know I will probably never meet you, but I hope to meet you in heaven one day.
When mark rober steals the sound design from the slowmo guys
Holy moly I swear mans gonna make it reach Mars when no one has ever went there
I love how you spend years breaking records no one else has even attempted
I wish i could be with yall and do that all funs things and met my favrouit of all time Mrbeast but i cant bc i live in pakistan and cant come there
He's basically made a nuke, but instead of the force going side ways it goes up.
yo bro whats ur thoughts on starship/superheavy
12:46
Every other montage were only five seconds if its twenty seconds it must be serious
Are we going to casually ignore Fletcher swearing at 6:05
Rip the truck

Noice
This video was so wholesome
Ya gotta love those magical 20-second build montages! Way to go, Mark!
Mark you should try to find  a chemical to make the foam glow in the dark that would be epic

There are stuff to be discovered for important uses. And stuff like devil toothpaste that shouldn't exist

Great content, never see many POC in your videos though.
POV you miss one day of school
Brody’s mom:So what’s the budget for this party? Mark:YES

Once again I am thoroughly impressed. One of these days my pyro side will crack the code to your devil's toothpaste! I will create fire from toothpaste!

Pov: enemy ink-strike in bound

I feel like Mark will keep upping the anti and will one day just fly a kid out to the moon.😂
wowww

Can I be your child?
Would it be higher if you install a weak lid on the top intentionally to compress the force?
Congrats on #2 trending

marks voice was so gone by the time mr beast was on lol
i like the snowbird shirt mark
How amazing that flask was this time around, totally mental
LETS GOOO WE DID IT
Holy S*** there are some incredible action shots in this video. Whatever camera you guys were working with must have been a dream.
Woah that was amazing keep the effort up mark
imagine mr beast commenting sorry
Ft. Lethamyr's intro song
13:02 that on fly when your tryna go to sleep
I did not expect them to ACTUALLY ride on a private jet
You are an incredible person who gives me hope in humanity! Way to go!
11:53 not having kids anymore no sirrrie his foot is the end of the cameraman
30MPa of force (x50 football) is double what some of the larger major oil pipelines run with. Spookey
You REALLY went all out! again...
Mark Rober is like the new Bill Nye keep doing great things Mark much ❤️ from Ohio
Yo brodyyy
This video is the best
That was awesome and those drone shots were crazy!
Dude you are awesome.
50 times the force of "pushing a fully inflated football"? What does that even mean😂
NVM I AM REALLY LATE
Great Work
So cool!
I miss being a child
I wish my teachers showed me these videos for science lol😂
I would have made the flask bigger!
yooooooooo he did it nice job
im starting to feel like youtube channels like this should be responsible to do a EIR before doing crazy stunts like this....im just thinking, what did all that foam do to the watershed....
Commendable act of philanthropy. I hope Brody smiled wide on his birthday
You should do a devil’s toothpaste one
Make a bigger one
Mark Rober feels like your best friend you've never actually met in person.
Brody and Ava 100% hit
you're such a nice person mark, and like you said:  when you do something nice, it may not come back straight away, but it always does eventually
Of course, now he has to make an actual rocket powered by this stuff.
Doing gods work.   You make the world better.
when the last kid  releazied hes no longer the world record holder
This is a great thing you did, this kid really deserved it. But imagine being someone who stole from a make-a-wish kid. Normally I play devils advocate and try to find some reason to do what they did but that's unforgivable
Imagine discovering a new thing (devil's toothpaste) and then not sharing it.
OMG Mark Rober posted again I guess he isn’t dead happy to see you gues again mark thansk for posting again!
you may be a firm believer in the scientific methodology but Im a firm believer in that Mark Rober is science peter pan and its amazing
If there are YouTube awards, this should be a contender. Best of 2021 by a long shot.
I'm  sorry, I just can't get over what you told the child. Why didn't you just say mommy was going to an interview or something
HOW DID I MISS THIS!!!!!!!
Bruh this is a vertified magnet and kids saying "oOh cHeCkMaRk"
Its like volcank
As a long time pool boy, i speak for all of us, we hate you.
I challenge you to build a flask that is twice the size next year!
Woah
Oh never mind
Leaf blowing? You mean foam blowing? 😂
I remember that one kid for his birthday
That was wonderful. Thanks, Mark!
Sugoiiiiii!!!!!
Got 2 kids a world record but one doesn't have one anymore
To dig the hole you should of had those how to build a....       People
Thanks for the inspiration, Brody!  You're okay too, Mark, I guess.
I’m so ungrateful
don’t worry about the environment
I was cheated out of seeing the purple trough explode. Do it all again. Also, I want to eat the Orbeez.
Thank you make the world a better place!
1:58 OH YEAH CHILD LABOR
Bb  J
Bring some of this amazing love and fun to any Hood near you. 👊🏾🙏🏾
Us *when mark rover is explaining what he is doing* huh? *Him* it’s so simple you can do it to…
Whoever did the drone videography should work for Marvel
You should have done red
elephant toothpaste rocket next year?
It’d be interesting if you had a second channel to just explain all of this stuff, It could just be an unedited clip of you talking into a camera, I wouldn’t mind.
Funny seeing Mark et al on the skate ramp, putting two fingers up to the camera. In Britain & possibly other parts of Europe, that's quite offensive, similar to giving someone the middle finger. All the kids on this family-friendly wholesome video flipping the bird at the camera 🤣
50 times pushing against a football? Just use metric pressure please Mark.
At 8:11, was that bill gates?
Mark is turning in to Mr Beast....he has a tesla, private jet, and a limo to get a few kids to the party 😂
Mark is just one of the most awsome persons ever to live.
Feels like every videos are excuses to launch epic pool parties.
I love that a benefactor caught wind for the private jet and was like use mine! That’s so cool! That was always a dream of mine being able to do like private charters or whatnot I’m not sure how to go about all that stuff but would be cool to do things like that just give people a cool experience ☺️
I clicked on this because I thought it was the other one
Mark Rober is truly the fun uncle of YouTube! These kids will remember this for the rest of their lives!
I wish there was more people out there like Mark!  Way to make a kid's and community's day!
Ha white people wasting money
He caught the liars red handed😂😂😂
Bro the whole cone just flew up. I'm thinking if it's possible to make a rocket out of these.
Give me a shout out please
10:00 its so satisfying
I skipped to the launching, and didn't realize the mannequins were not people and was like "What are you guys doing just standing there?! That stuff will boil ya!!!!"
I hope Brody gets to send it on the quad!
Mark Rober and the people who worked on this clearly know how to throw the best parties. Also look at that picture of the flask, things made out of metal with multiple weld points to keep the edges shut and there is STILL some leaking out the sides, the pressure and heat was so high that it cracked the welds, thats just awesome.
Mark is probably one of the nicest people besides mr beast
Ein deutscher Kommentar für zwischendurch. Das war Hammer :)
should have made the opening smaller
:)
Marks videos are always my favorite videos to watch
Imagine seeing that really far away while looking out your window
Wow it is so cool
This is insane
What the f@ck that’s cool
Banana republic
I vote that Mark just run Make a Wish from now on...
Imagine just casually being friends with MrBeast
who else wished when they were launcing the elephant toothpaste into the air, they would fly the drone into it??
try makeing it go to the bottem to see how high it can go
I want to see that flask loaded with devil's toothpaste...
could you imagine of Mark was on TTTT again and the intro was "I made reacord breaking elephant toothpaste"
It looks so unreal 😦
This guy literally lives most people’s dreams every day
Fletcher's sister kinda cute tho😶
i envy you people having fun. I need fun like this in my life
absolutely amazing
My disappointment is immeasurable, this is #2 on trending not #1 like it should
8:45  Isn't that the same idea as the the engine that the natzis made in 1946 or something.
12:55 Story almost takes an awkward turn when Mark nearly clocks Fletcher with his elbow.
That Elephant Toothpaste faker explanation was almost like Captain Disillusion!
*Roses Are Red* *Violets Are Blue* *Elephant Toothpaste Is Cool* *Do You Think So Too?*
12:50 is when it happens
Am I the only one who always counts how many seconds long Mark's montages are?
50 times football pressure…. Americans will measure with anything but the metric system
Lesson learnt.  Lemons = Elephant Toothpaste
How much force IS pushing against a fully blown up football?
He just doesn't stop
What a great way to make a living 😂😂😂
*It’s The 2nd Pompeii!*
Brody died yesterday from his disease. Rip.
PLEASE TELL ME THIS GONNA BECOME A SERIES
Yaaaaaaaa congrats 🎈🎊🍾🎉
Thanks Mark, keep giving back and inspiring others to do the same. My wife and I learned the same principle from our parents and try to follow it every day. We have two boys which (I hope) we have also inspired and it will be interesting to see what that means for them. For it is far greater to give then to receive. (Though being a grateful, gracious, and humble receiver can sometime be the hardest thing give.)
12:40
Mark and Mr Beast are heavenly blessings to humanity in need!
High interest rates have always been a means for the United States to harvest global wealth! However, the United States continues to have low interest rates! Wealth certainly does not favor the United States!
Congrats Mark!
Love this you definitely made those kids day for sure an again your video held my attention the whole time which is difficult Asperger‘s 😁 love what you do an working with MR Beast awesome love that guy too you guys do totally different content aside from helping people love it an love from 🇨🇦
private jet crashes
Looked like u struck green oil
he just keeps one using himself
@2:30. Uhhh. Isn't that tune from a rap song?!  Lmao.
The edits or out of this world 😯
Is it called elephants toothpaste because of the elephant-like noise it makes? 13:01  Edit: i assume it would change depending on the container
Wow
@manualdomundo is in trouble
Nearly all of Mark’s videos make me tear up. You are the coolest engineering nerd in the world. Keep up the outstanding work, please!!!
whats fletchers sisters @ ha
no not a 90 minute drive! the horror! THE FUEL SAVING!
Mark Rober for president, amazing video
11:28 wild Lethamyr appears
I love your vids especially when you use the toothpastes
Hydrochloric acid in that toothpaste?
This is cool
Do another video
The long-term low interest rate is actually anti capitalist, undermining the "creative destruction" function of capitalism and making inefficient enterprises continue to operate. Ultra low interest rates promote current consumption at the expense of future consumption and damage future economic growth.
Why was that random girl there?
Do this but with devils toothpaste
Flecher
For those wondering, the devil’s toothpaste "secret recipe" is basically the same recipe but with hyper concentrated H2O2 (like 50% or something) OR he just used a more powerful catalyst that I don’t know about… but using 50% H2O2 creates the exact same amount of power
I think one cool idea is to make a rocket with devils toothpaste(with a proper rocket nozzle and gimbal)
I always think it’d be hilarious if you introduced yourself to the kid, and they just had no idea who you were.
6 million views in 1 day.  Wow
"When life gives you lemons... build a 5-ton flask and blast them to space."- Mark Rober 2021😂🤣
Fletchers sisters a baddie
Really love how you're spreading your happiness, would be cool if you spread it in the direction of the less privileged in our society.
That was incredible!
Tommyinnit???😳 8:00
Why are there downvotes?
I must be doing something wrong
Well Mark this is what retirement looks like.
A 20s montage is not satisfying enough. Would appreciate something much lengthier on a side B channel perhaps?
is Mark also a pilot?
Who thumbs down this!? There's a nice wholesome back story and great science.
13:00 when the hulk has taco bell
1 year later he actually make one go to SPACE!!
👌
Hi mark
The bent cormorant disconcertingly strap because evening philly attach worth a boorish beetle. unsightly, oafish streetcar
AMAZING!!! 😵
That was awesome of you Brody give away your wish. That’s pro level compassion
How do you dispose of all those
lol mark rober got sponsored by scammers
A DAY AGO?!?! How long can you make your record-breaking streaks?
White
Lots of with kids
WOAH AGAIN ? PoG
I hope this becomes an annual thing
You are a saint
Rober is like the poster guy for the new YT rules and policies
Me watching this video in 144p 😀
Here we are again.
That.....is just plain goddamn awesome. I feel better about humanity after seeing something like this. :-)
Fun stuff. I'd love to see some of the Youtube splurging done in other countries though
You know you're awesome when the Mayor comes to witness your latest crazy shenanigans
gg
drone shots are dope
Insane footage
Gold star for you Mark Rober 🌟
The drone turned into flash at the end
Can someone convert 50 times the force you feel when pressing on a football to like..  psi or something?  I don't know what that means LOL
how did you clear it all up???
That was...... AWESOME!!!!
Bro that’s guys sister is an absolute dime
These videos about elephant toothpaste really hit different after lighting your hand on fire
So theoretically we can make a flask big enough to send a payload into orbit
This is how you montage.
Who's here before 50 million views
Like
Mark Robert loves child labor😂😂😂😂
I can never help but smile whenever I watch your videos <3
dang that seems fun but was it really more fun than sitting inside with nothing to do everyday this summer?    yes :(
My new favorite video
Wow
Amazing and inspiring. This is what it's all about.
special.
Awwww I wish I had a non-curable disease
Do everything without expectations and accept everything. 🤙🙏
And every thing he does is so simple but so cool
Imagine missing a high five 😔
Mark my words. Marks a legend!
This kinda reminds me of how Micheal Jackson created an amusement park to lure young boys into trusting him.
Red And Orange ToothPaste looks like spegheti
Here he is again with a new vid
Quite literally Devil's Toothpaste! You managed to create a self igniting foam! I guessed maybe 800 feet!
I LOVED This Among Us Video! Please Make More!!!
👏👏👏👏
Insane
Wait is that sound the reason its called Elephant's toothpaste??
Mark, you're awesome.
Me after I eat Taco Bell
How many drone shots do you want? Mark rober: Yes
Mark Rober you have a wonderfully big heart!
only rl players understand
The uncle that we wish we all had🙂
WOW JUST WOW
This is awesome
I didn’t even know about this until I just saw this video! Gridley is my family’s home town and this is beyond amazing of you mark. Doing this for a kid in a small community like Gridley, you’re a class act and an amazing person thank you brother !🙏🏼🤘🏼
Epic!
If the opening is even narrower, the fountain will be even higher.
So wholesome that I cried :)
I hope I’m not the only one who thought for sure they’d seen this video before…
I feel like 50x the force of pushing on a football isn't specific enough
OMG THAT IS SO HIGH
All sourced locally too.
12:47 you welcome
Mark Rober is a W Former NASA worker
You sound like Austin evans
When a small town in the middle of somewhere comes together and works together better than an entire country   Also the party looked insanely fun! Thanks Brody for Uh Sparring this party-
2 trending typical mark
Shits taller than monstermax 2
Person of the century... Brody!!!
Mark Rober you are a great American.
How bad is this for the environment?
I don’t think there is a single video that is not interesting
Do it with devils toothpaste
Just watching this is fun 😄
I don't normally thank sponsors, but holy crap thank you Draft Kings. Y'all the best for making this happen.
NOICE
Grandfather blessing to Kool😇
I love your video's
And the solution was just perfect, not too confetti like, just perfect!
One question  How do you clean that up???
Yo shout out to that drone pilot! What type of drone was used for these shots!
homie be usin leths intro
Was it just me or was the footage if the orbees in the tube really cool and mesmerizing?
Oh Hi future self
I would reccoment some ear plugs when playing in a pool of orbees, because that stuf can get stuck real bad..
Mark just built different 😈
Hey so if you want that to go to space, I think you want the engine to be facing the ground so it can accelerate up..
In Australia these people would have been beaten and attested. Wake up people.
How was the height measured? Just curious.
YOU ARE SUCH AN INSPIRATION. You are an absolute LEGEND. Keep being awesome Mark!!!!
On this episode Mark kidnaps a child and forces him to look at all his science projects
you are an incredible person
Lethamer intro song
Soooo, instead of football units, how many psi or bar was it?
The quality of these videos is AMAZING, those drone shots were EPIC!!!
Mr 🅱️east
Can we all be thankful mark rober is alive and on YouTube being the most fun YouTuber witch makes up how long we have to wait for a new video
Those shots tho ❣️❣️❣️
I have a new goal in life to just be invited to one of these parties!!
He has once again proved him self as the greatest uncle of all time
you have NO idea how excited I was to see this!! finally the flask doesn't break! LETS GOOOO
Can you make a mark robe
This is my kingdom come
7:58
ya know, towards the beginning of the video i was wondering why it was called elephant toothpaste, and now i know it's because it sounds like an elephant once it erupts, neat. Timestamp: 13:00
"A generous benefactor", he says while we all know it was Mr. Beast.
Bruh I was about to say you and Mr.Beast should crossover and you already did 😂
If you look in the dictionary under the word wholesome. You'll see a picture of Mark Rober
I had to recheck it had “1 Day Ago” 😂
12:50 thank me later
I  have  booked
Insane great vid
It always comes back…..
The excitement feels a little forced
Finally a video from my favorite smart guy😀. You’re the best Mark and an inspiration to me 😊🤩.
❤️🔥🔥
Did they presume that all food colouring colours were the same chemical? the amount of time and effort that went into this, missing that fact is pretty crazy, don't get me wrong, awesome video, well worth the time and effort, E131 or there about is the issue I guess
That vlask is bigger than everyone’s future
Always a banger vid keep up the great work
The best video ever! I wish me beast showed up tho!!!!
You could also had it burried a meter under ground and then put sand back over it
Alright.... now make it a chocolate fountain.
The mad lad finally did it
This is what every child wished there volcano project would do.
The world needs more ppl like you, keep it up dude.
that glove segment made it fairly easy to determine what the catalyst is for your devils toothpaste.
The noises mark makes are so hilarious 😂😂
I wish my uncle was Mark :(
That 5 ton of metal was cheaper then the wood lol also great job
LEGEND
Mark is that one cool uncle who brings insane gifts
Well if being a wildly successful youtuber ever falls through, I think you've got a bright career in children's birthday party planning XD
YAY
Devils toothpaste recipe you just make elephant toothpaste but I had gasoline?
What’s the secret to being a great uncle?
I think it just went higher than the how ridiculous tower
Mad respect to the drone pilot 👍🏽
What does the slime do to the environment? Does it naturally dissolve? No haste just curious
Legend has it without those last two colors he has to do it again
THAT DEVILS TOOTH PASTE SOUNDS LIKE A ELEPHANT (caps)
Hi
Shrek 5
I wish this dude was my uncle bro
#2 on trending!?
I wonder how high it would go if the devil's toothpaste was used?
Couldn’t imagine having to go home after a party like that
mark thinks he’s smart. I found the recipe for the devils toothpaste 😁
As someone who grew up in eastern Europe, I never had any fun even close to this spoiled friend group and it pisses me off
+1000000000000000000000000000000 community points (Dante’s Son wrote this comment )
Mark Rober and MrBeast are the saviors of this platform
6:50 12:38
You know devils elephant toothpaste can be used as a weapon 😏
That was really cool
When I see kids like that, i have hope for the world. To use your make wish for another kid that is amazing.
The only question I have, is this safe to the environment? Nonetheless it’s awesome
Elephant toothpaste in space… make it happen
That was amazing!
Ayo where is that sisters @
Try putting devils toothpaste in the giant flask O.O
Thank you, Mark Rober, for singlehandedly making me love science again😂
My faith in humanity does get restored from time to time.
I REALLY wanna see Colin Furze make one twice as big in his back garden just him and his mate!
Thats how you use a private jet.
The editing was 🔥
So how many PSI in a fully inflated football?
That was devils toothpaste in front of the house? I thought devil's toothpaste was corrosive and flammable?
How many meters ?
wow
Mark is truly the best at what does he!
Why does he always picks white Caucasian  kids? I don’t see any colored kids in the party
Mark Rober is like modern day bill Nye lol
Glad you revisited this. I was thinking about the "critical oversight" in your last toothpaste video too
So cool everyone chipped in to make everything possible
Huh, how many trees do you have to plant to make up for a private jet ride?
Please do the biggest elephant tooth paste... Your New enemy is "Manual do Mundo" a Brazilian YouTube Channel who made the biggest elephant tooth paste and owns the WR
16:45 how the heck did you do that in the orbeez? Lmao
Must be nice to have a job where you get to build big toys and play with them.
The two F18s passing by :Friendlies to the West
Now do it with devils toothpaste
The kid who used his “make a wish foundation” wish to get another kid’s stolen ATV back is so wholesome. I hope my Daughter grows up to be like that kid one day!
I feel lucky to be in an Era where Mark Rober exists
what a gem of a human
person: markes whats your fav activities mark: anything slip in slides!!
Imagine the devil tooth paste lit on fire
if you play rocket league your gonna know what im talkin about, i heard lethamyrs intro song in here
Guess who I'm with. Joe, Joe Mama!
You are definitely a record breaker
Finally
at the start mark rober pulled out his quarter mr beast with the tesla and the jett
13:15 me when your mom
Pt3
Was the benefactor Mr Beast?
Giving what could be your last wish away to someone else in need, that's honestly huge! That kid is definitely a great human.
@2:33 The mandolin “Colt 45” background song was a great choice.
me getting exited to go to the beach: realizes that he cant because of lockdown
I like the feature of lethamyrs intro😂
He would be the best teacher ever
Mark always makes possibly the best videos on YouTube. And such high quality
Congratulations on another great party and also on that terrific elephants toothpaste Guinness record breaker!  Now study the different ways lava exits the earth and see if you can match them!
David Dobrik punchin the air rn
So does this "devil's toothpaste" contain manganese hepitoxide?
Every video is him jumping the shark
Love how Mark used to work for NASA, one of the coolest jobs ever.
holy guacamole!
This sounds like a segment from 'Dude What Would Happen'.
That was very very very extremely cool
So cool
why'd you stop at 26 million orbeez? Mr Beast did 100 million!
So awesome
anybody else think of Lethemyr when the song kicked in at the beginning XDDD
26 mil??? @MrBeast did 100mil
Make a wish has nothing on my guy Mark.
bro really needs some new background music
And people say money can’t but happiness 😩
6:44 is it weird I know that is a Cessna Citation 4?
Dude I live in Gridley Cali I never heard about this this is awesome
What is the cost of the total experiment? I would like to try myself on a small scale.
Can’t you believe youtubers/people are living a luxurious life because of use the viewers watching them lol
Anyone else hear Leths intro
Honestly this almost made me cry at the end
Like. Like. Like! Awesome, giving video. You rock!
Isn't this terrible for the enviroment?
Nickelodeon
🙆‍♂️
This deserves more than 1 comment from me...lol🤘🤠
Top notch as always !!!!
Mark out here living his best life and taking everyone along with him
I wish I could genuinely be this happy.
I can’t believe you do things in this scale! Great video!!!!!
I am really enjoying the color profile/grading and dynamic range on the main cam!  Also, the editing just makes this feel like a little movie and it's amazing!
There ain't no party like a Mark Rober party
I wonder what would happened if the reaction in the great volcano would have been with high pressure pumps
Awesome! Simply awesome!
“Fifty times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football”  Those Americans and not using measurements, like what does that even mean!? All jokes aside, great video and Holly s*** that was awesome
Science project judges rn: noice volcano.
Those fpv drone shots❤
The cinematography is seriously levelling up. WOW
:0
So unnecessary tho
For anyone who was a part of this production, you are very much appreciated!
You did it again. 👊
I think you've gotten your super cool uncle award
This is my kingdom come
Problems with having deadly diseases: you have deadly diseases. Perks of having deadly diseases: mark rober throws you really dope parties.
Mark i hope you have the best life ever, same for your family u are really awesome
HIS videos are so wholesome
Number two on trending! Great job!
You're such a great person Mark. I genuinely love watching your videos.
Humanity at it's finest.
PRICELESS!!!!
13:11 *Vietnam War Flashback *
11:08 suddenly watching Lethamyr xd
Bless you Mark. I love what you do for those young ones. You sir are an example to us all, of what to be.
LOVE
This only works if the Earth is truly flat.
This is terrible for the environment, i hope you all get arrested
With marks brains and mrbeasts generosity  these two could make some insane videos together
Mark is now like the new crazy dude like Elon musk
Now I’m just waiting for Mark to make his own theme park since all the parties he’s thrown are better then some amusement parks

So nice to see you repping the FPV community. We’re just as capable as a fancy dji drone!
Awesome.
12:45
Yayyy fletcher and his family are the best.
leth?
Why is this only #2 on trending it should be #1
This vid is touching :(
what a wonderful video Mark. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Mark You're a Saint.
I wonder how high can a elephant toothpaste rocket could go if we make it superlight and just shot it up? Or would it just be impossible for the mark rober to do?
Brow use your money to save the world instead.
Am I the only one curious as to how they cleaned those up?
Hey is there any reason you made the vessel yourself, and didnt just buy like a rain collection tank or something ? Are those not rated to a high enough pressure?
Thanks Mark for this content. Ive been around for a few years already on ur channel and started watching with my girlfriend recently. Thanks for everything. I find it so interesting. Maybe you can show me around NASA one day?😛
Ngl your actually a legend for doing this
Could you please make a video on bottle rockets, thanks ;)
Mark, this was well done sir!
I can't be the only one that recognised lethamyr's intro like 11 mins in
Les gooooo!
dude it went to space
I do hope that this kid lives a long life, we need more people like him in on this planet.
Too wholesome
Wait doesn't that mean he took fletcher world record 🤔
I have a feeling that nickelodeon would do something like this
Congrats!
Imagine your just at home and then you just see green in the air combust
When you said "I don't give out the formula" I scowered the internet and found it. U made me want to make it. This is your fault.
Mark is just going to keep making bigger and taller elephant toothpaste experiments until a video title is “blasting elephant toothpaste out of orbit”
what is 50 footballs in MPa?
Thanks, brought a smile to my world today :)
Sorry, but things that allegedly are more fun just because they burn more fossil fuels should no longer be encouraged. Don't you think a boat ride can be just as much fun as using a private jet?
"we're gonna to try to do better this time" literally obliterates the record from last time well done sir, well done.
cara esses videos da gringa e muito bom pena que no brasil não tem videos dessa quaidade que pena!!!
It wa so big even the camera's weren't framed big enough
Insane
Hi
this is Hollywood level of production
Awesome video! Smiles all around :)
Thank you for doing things like this dude *Tips fedora*
I wonder what’s happening if you put something in the tube of the chamber so it completely closed and than let the reaction begin
Big Woop :-|
mark rober is even more of a child than me. amazing content
“we even harnessed some child labor”
i love how basically every shot wasn't able to capture the highest edge of the eruption.
epic!
You live in Gridley??? Im in Oroville.
Niice
We need more vids these are awesome
Just commenting to germt the stats up
Nice video
I feel so bad for the kid who got his atv stolen
Bloody legend
Make the base wider and the opening narrower
You did it again, Congratulations!
Wow
13:48 Okay but, I want to know the actual pressure value though?
Now make a tank that shoots elephant toothpaste
lol the mannequin was just chilling in the middle of all that elephant toothpaste
the volcano you make for the science fair
Mark Rober 2024
13:19 you can see the bird being carried away by the hot air current lmao
All I can think when I see the orbeez pool was. Lethamyr's intro
12:52 you're welcome
Really cool filming in this video👍
I wish I had an uncle like this.
hes till at it
You did it again
I really want to know how they does they clean up the mess it leaves behind
everyone is going crazy over the toothpaste, but i'm wondering if elephants actually eat that, it looks tasty but feels hot
Mark uses making a kid happy as an excuse to be a kid again
build a rocket or a plane
I really wanna know how elephant toothpaste is made. Scale down to a small combination. I know you can't post it here but we can make contact later. We could share ideas. I've done some crazy things that I never would've thought possible!
Mark may have the biggest heart I know! Keep it up Mark :)
Foam daddy 😩
The best line I have heard this year "But somehow it comes back ♥". Thank you Mark for creating this.
Mr Beast betta watch his back👀👀👀😂😂😂
Heartwarming
Cool dude.
Another episode of Mark Rober hanging out with kids.
Can't wait for Brody and fishers sister to become a power couple
The 20 second build montages. Make this nostalgic
11:27 all of the sudden I’m watching a Lethamyr video lol 😂
Those drone shots are INSANE!
Mark running a sweatshop 😬
Just.. wholesome
This video made us smile in so many ways! 😃 It was absolutely awesome.  I have an autistic son and we are big fans of this channel and after we watched this, we came up with the idea of how amazing it would be to see his 5 favourite YouTube channels combined in a unique, one of a kind video that included the contrasting skills of Mark Rober, The Slo Mo guys, Mr Beast, Dude Perfect AND Buttered side down.  Now THERE’S a challenge for you… (I would literally pay money to see that btw) Over to you guys….
Why don’t you try devils toothpaste as a hight world record
achm, environment!!
how much for the formula for devils tooth paste?
How do you clean it up though.
These videos are always so entertaining
Mark honestly you should do this with devils toothpaste
Maker I think u could make a titan from aot
Yeah!!! Science !!!
i hope the owners of the house are not mad at you
Another great video created for a very worthwhile reason.
So does this town go down as the greatest community of all time?  I think so.
You should make another one but with the sole purpose of trying to see how high you make make it blast off. Amazing video.
I got chills watching this
Still early
I’m from New Orleans and I know one of the coaches sons
“about 50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football” bro what type of units are those
Bro this whole video I had a smile and when I saw mr beast I went bigger I be looking like momo
Congrats!!!!!
How do you clean it up????
Am I The Only One Who Wanted To Drive In That Beeutifull TESLA ???
Now fo it with devil's tooth paste
@Mark Rober just out of curiosity, what is that little banjo tune you put in your video at the 2:31 mark? You had it in your squirrel maze video also.
ig de la minita?
We didn't forget about next for autism. Your credibility has been shattered.
Quite the return on investment
Ironic. This video came out a day after my project was turned in for an elephants toothpaste project.
bruh I had Leukemia twice as a kid. Where is my ATV :|
The production value of this is insane. This is far from reality for most people.
1 day ago
Imagine being every one like this World would be so beautiful.
That drone just about sliced off his foot 😬
Great Job on the Drone Shots Nurk!!!
So every year he throws a party for someone an earns them a world record… that is really cool
Your awesome! And that’s awesome l!
Have you ever thought of becoming a party planner, Mark? 😂🥳🎉
Tell elon
12:50
This will soon become a military weapon
Im most impressed by the landscaping. Laying sod and all that
Greta dont like it
Pool scares me at the thought of jumping head first
This may sound naive but why do they call it elephant toothpaste?
It made an Elephant noise as well LOL
Thank you for all your hard work to bring such am experience to kids! It's so awesome to see!
I've been waiting for this, I just knew you wouldn't be satisfied with the first attempt. Thanks a lot!
Amazing!
me and my cat watched this and it was noice
I needed this video today. So refreshing and a reminder that not all is wrong in the world.
Geez. Just WTH is in purple food coloring??
He’s lucky 😔
What would Freud say to this kind of "experimentation"? lol
This place should be a landmark one day, maybe not now, but one day
Mark Rober and Jameis Winston got beef
It’s going to save human life
I want to see this go even BIGGER. like perhaps abandon warehouse or building (perhaps it is planned to be taking down soon). Would it be possible to do so much Elephant Toothpaste will it knock down a Warehouse or building.
Hi I'm sure all your videos are child friendly I no the ones I've seen are just as t to ask you as i want to tell my son to watch your view as he loves stuff to do with NASA and I think he love your science projects and he is 8
Please rober
When does the "World's first devil toothpaste powered rocketship" video come out?
Love what you’re doing!
Woww
So the atmosphere can be made for a new planet
This is the most wholesome thing you have done, Thank You for this Mark and everyone involved.
This is actually pretty neat. I would have said this was a bit overly self-promotional but it seems it wasn't him going overboard, it was actually the genuine help of many, many people offering their services, so not a flex, but honest care.
having fun but wasting so much natural resources, orbeez etc also not best for ecology
I love your content
This is incredible, I just wish something like this would happen to me!
What an amazing thing to do for those kids.  This was awesome in so many different ways.  May they all live long and healthy lives.
the most wholesome youtube channel!
You cheated again, Mark Rober
Congrats on the record
Congrats on the record
The amount of padding for time in this was astonishing
Imagine if the whole flask just decided to fly with the elephant toothpaste 😂
He spoiled them, and I’m all for it
You could use the devil's toothpaste as a practical effect for a volcano
Absolute harmless fun!
Who is that drone guy! Amazing work!
I. Am. Jealous.
Mark you gave him a day to remember, great job!
7:19 what an epic shot
Mark can spend one year experimenting with elephant toothpaste but I barely have time to sleep due to having to work to be able to have a place to live and food on the table. I just don't get how some people have the economical freedom so jealous. But at the same time it's better he does this stuff than me :p Maybe it's all about brains
hes like a real life elon musk
Here is the is the volcano 12:50
why does this whole video look so much fun to see and play in
wooooooooooooooooooooooo LET GO MARK UPLOADED
Hehe... foam daddy 😂
“1+ Uncle point”
That has to be the best day in that kids life
12:50
13:00 yw
Love that this happened...! 👌🤯🙏
I guess broody has friends in high places - not all Lukemia patient children have it that lucky.
Best youtuber
agree
Love this video🖤🖤🖤‼️‼️‼️‼️
Ah yes child labor to build something for a child
You should do a collab with Jared owen
I am boykotting football
Educator, artist, philanthropist, networker. What a world treasure Mark and his support team are.
Grown 12 year olds
Always fun to see you doing things for others. Also it was cool to see Mr Beast help out. I really like the friendship you guys have.
Thanks guys!!!!
12:46
Mark you are an amazing human with an extraordinary gift. Don't ever stop.
Alright, alright. Y'all got me crying happy tears. I'm such a feckin' sucker for crowds of happy people, making someone's day, over-the-top paying it back, and helping kids. I hope everyone involved in this project has +1000 karma for the rest of their lives.
Omg so emotional music at the elephant toothpaste
Can I triple like a YT video? So amazing and sweet altogether. You are a legend Mark 💪🏻
I love when he does these kind of things for kids!
Tell nasa to put meters on the outside  and put nuclear energy inside ok
This video gets the Best Video of September 2021 😂 Congrats on being amazing!
Some you-tubers never play on the job.........ahahahah....Awesome people, awesome video.
All of mark's videos are absolutely INSANE
The internet nerd I like
Enjoying and educational at the same time.
This is what ,,paintball calamity edishon" looks like
I found out to make devils toothpast
new video ya
this is my kingdom come
You really have no brain do you
This is cool
Lethamyr?
13:01 me on the toilet
that cool
Tareq should be taking notes…
His children must have the best dang birthday party's
Where the heck did you find that steel. Last I heard there were mass shortages in the US
The terrible sampan arespectively gaze because behavior noticeably trade but a madly engineer. imperfect, massive donna
Many elephants are gonna have clean theeth now
This is phineas and ferb on real life
whos dale?
Mark is a amazing guy
Am I the only one who feels a little uneasy about a video with a kid as the star being sponsored by draftkings?
and I'm crying. Again.
13:01 Was that humming sound the flask or a drone?
the peak of consumerism is here bois :D ecology cries (a bit)
Lethamyr's intro makes a cameo appearance!
Amazing dude
E I love your videos they are the absolute best thing ever
Devils Toothpaste:  5 L of 50 % Hydrogen Peroxide 350 mL of Dish Soap 2 g of blue Food Coloring and to activate it 600 g of 50 % Potassium Iodide (KI) Solution.
Yeah
Rip purple
Wakesurf 👀
Can you start a second channel where you go more into the engineering required for all your builds at a more in depth level
is the toothpaste dangeros
Another amazing video!
Funni
How toxic is the devil's toothpaste
I love how at 16:12 my guy was gonna shake mark’s hand and mark said nah😂😂 come here 🤗 and hugs him instead
insane
You’re an awesome person Mark
A bit too much...
this one girl is veryyy pretty ore?
Your Awesome!
would love to be able to do stuff like this for a living
I love how they let you put the sponsor at the very end
What an awesome kid. I should know, I am one!
12:59 toxins going up XD
Mark 🗿
The trio of kindness  Mark: uses science to make lives greater  Mrbeast: given away too much money to count to basically everybody he meets  Brody: using his one time chance to make someone else happy    Bonus meme cus I’m feeling nice  Mark: literally mrbeast but science and he has a bad docter accent
Gender reveal party’s be like:
When you realized mark said the devils toothpaste mixtrure
10:07 that’s a lot of scrambled eggs
Mark Rober is the best
13:16 the biggest party pooper in the world
2 years later: Mark - ALRIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE A VOLCANO FILLED OF ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE WE WILL GET ANOTHER WORLD RECORD LETS GO!  if he makes anorher video on this i will cry ;)
Outstanding
Just an idea what if you built a rocket powered by the toothpaste
This guy at least owns 30 world records
12:48 if you don't have time
Millennials are so worthless...
I remember watching your other video where the bottom of the flask broke. So happy you succeeded!
It’s a celebration every time mark uploads👍🏾😊
Now make the flask bigger
7:27 willy wonkaaaaaaa
There needs to be more people that are truly this nice
this is so nice
this should be the most most liked video ever, even once!!!
Life is not perfect, and neither are humans but everyone has a beauty in it. The modern understanding of beauty is often limited to the physical aspects, but real beauty is inner beauty.
10:30 didn't that sound like an Enderman screaming ??😂
This is Elon musk 2.0
So question? We they worried about the house burning down with the devils tooth paste? Great video!
I’m not crying, you are.
lower the background music.
Amazing Video
"....in the form of 6 massive devil's toothpaste troves" Purple: NOT TODAY!
This  video warmt my heart
Eyyyy its Jimmy
Big ups
I’m gonna call BS on people who helped you not getting anything in return. As well as you. You all saw someone being happy thanks to your efforts.
I love how Mark spends his time wisely
To be honest i would love to dis but i cant because i live in canada
i can't be the only one that wants to jump inside of it and eat it
Well there u go, being kind does pay off.
My Faith in humanity as restored
I love it!
Just awesome!
Is the drone pilot completely immersed in virtual reality? 😲
Hey mark how high would it have gone if it was devils toothpaste
Lol the Minecraft music
Wow
And this my friends, is what mark does for a living...     I wish I could
Leviticus 23:23-25 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.  Enjoy the upcoming Feast of Trumpets. Shalom.
congo on record and whose plane is that
Moving video, Mark!  Congratulations on everything!
How did you get it not to fly this time?
As always, you are a genius!!
Can you put a bunch of elephant toothpaste it devil toothpaste in a house
Hi Mark 👋 im a really big fan and i wanna ask you can you please help me and my family we are struggling so much and we have barely any money to buy stuff pls
I was shocked just watching it on u tube
Oh no the house!
so American measurement 50 footballs of pressure
My two favorite you tubers making another persons year better! Happy Birthday Brody
It’s so cool to see towns coming together to make this possible. Keep up the amazing work mark, love you vids.
I think the purple food coloring dye is potassium permanganete
7:22 is it wired the song sounds incredibly similar to “our mom” in Korean? Check it on google translate :/
+ 1 uncle point    By now you must be at 100000000000000 world points
I'm just amazed you built all that in 20 seconds
No this is not a human this is a monkey
Fletchers sister tho😏
Can we talk about Brody wake surfing in socks 😂😂 1:02
Nice suprise pawty mawk woba!
Thought leth was going to show up!
Ever notice how in all of Mark's "epic" videos these are all white people?...
You know who Grunkle Stan is jealous of?  It's Grunkle Mark Rober! 🤣🤣
It looked like Starburst colors
Mark your videos are amazing. Tell nasa I want to work for them pls!
Let’s goooo you did it Brody see you at school
I am so glad he isn't giving the formula out.
I would like mark to receive a official award for 1# uncle in the world
Awesome.  Awesome awesome awesome.
Haha
Why do you only do stuff for white kids?
lethamyr intro at 11:17
I don't even know what that is much less ever see the last tallest elephant toothpaste.
My favourite parts of these videos are the older people going down the foam slide! I love seeing adults that never lose the ability to still have fun and play on a slide of foam!
Now you have to make Devils toothpaste rockets and make a giant one.
12:52 here guys if your tired or smth
20M soon
HE DON'T MISS
Absolute madlad
You're far too clickbaity. Go make some less sensational videos.  I do not care for parties. I care about the specifics of the reaction, like how the bonds reshuffle themselves to release energy and make safe molecules.
6:00 Fletcher thought he was getting a high five lol
I kinda want a bad disease now
Im scared what if the devil toothpaste recipe gets public
"World's largest mess"
Thank you for making us smile, laugh, and tear up all while getting a little smarter!!
Real question... How do you clean this up?
Thats a lot of pollution my friend....though it might have been fun
Using footballs to measure pressure is the epitome of merica’. awesome vid!
💫💫
insane video, it's still crazy to me that he does this for people not expecting anything in return, what an awesome guy
Ur so nice
I didn’t know what to expect after your first attempt but holy **** I wasn’t expecting that!
CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS VIDEO IS JUST SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS
He is the mrbeast of science!
Who the heck would thumbs down this?
It must be so fun living in rob’s neighborhood. Like every couple months you hear “the town NASA scientist is doing another crazy experiment, let’s go help out!” 😂
You are like a kids best friend imaginary! You are so awesome!
He’s in my language arts
Mark, I need your help. I have a very sweet little guy who’s dying of a very serious illness. He has a chronic, life threatening, disease that makes him deathly terrified of “Elephant Toothpaste.” Would you be will to throw him a surprise and help cheer up little Chip? Thanks! :D
Mark, if you’re trying to make up for all the scammers in this world, I think you can relax for a while. You’ve done it. The gift of love is beyond epic in this video! Thank you for showing, celebrating and being the very best of what humanity is capable of.
Why didn't you use plask underground... It would have been more rigid and unbreakable 😁
This guy's an ace at milking that cow
INSAAAANE
This is insane
#13
Imagine that but with devil’s toothpaste
Such a wholesome video <3 <3
Correction: I told my friend, Jimmy, a.k.a Mr.Beast, this story.
Great work Mark and to the people involved. Many smile's and happiness. 👌🙂🙌
The music on the drone shots is just relaxing
Why am I crying
You’re an amazing guy Mark, I wish more people knew how to live life like you - this world would be a much better place. S/O to MrBeast too for always hooking it up, and of course everyone who helped because it wouldn’t have been possible without them🤙🏻
Is that why I almost got shot with a lemon
my day is made 10x better when you upload, thank you mark!
My names Brody to
Mark Rober = 👑
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Fletcher has made a return
I feel bad for your new friend
NOCE
“I’m ѕυвѕ¢яιвιηg тσ єνєяуσηє ωнσ ѕυвѕ¢яιвєѕ тσ мє αη∂ ℓιкєѕ тнιѕ ¢σммєηт”🤍
Mark you are such a kind hearted guy. You don’t have to do any of this but you do and make sure everyone else is happy and loved. You make this crazy world so much more beautiful. 🥺
Who would win Mrbeast or Mark Rober
not all heroes wear capes
Only creator who could make a 17 minute video feel like 5
wow
Most wholesome videos on the internet.
ok this was insane; but how come we dont get devils toothpaste in the giant flask might need FAA aproval though lmao
Mark you’re my favorite person
Not me wishing I had an uncle like this
mark rober is genuinely one of the most caring, wholesome and nice humans on earth, warms my heart
I love Mark’s childish wonder and his philanthropic nature. Together, Mark and Mr. Beast could rule the world.
12:00
Mark is showing all of us that no matter how useless we feel, we can still make something amazing out of ourselves.
Your videos have been a highlight of mine for years! I only wish I could do this kind of stuff for others as well! Your AMAZING Mr. Mark Rober, and I can't wait to see what you have planned next!
What a lucky kid RIP to almost 100 Palestinian kids who lost their lives ,  in American-backed Israeli attack on Gaza !
SO LUCKY
WE NEED 20 M
YESSS SIRRR
Honestly I think u should be a surprise birthday planner
Foamdaddy... Really?  7:43
the most wholesome video of 2021 🥺🥺
WAIT MRBEAST IS YO-
You should build a giant flask but launch in upside down
Sounds fun

Even shaggy would be impressed

Amazing video Mark! Congrats to you and your team!
Porra, Iberê... E agora?

Well i gotta say its a cool project but wouldnt it be more helpful to just donate the money instead of doing this party for a bunch of kids?
Wow
Mark Rober with dat quality content
What is the music at 5:30
Above and beyond effort to bring the love back around.
That was amazing. Thank you for doing such great things for people you don't even know. Karma smiles on you.
This dudes like the mr beast of Elephant toothpaste/science.
Do it with devils toothpaste
I was saying the color looked different
We need squirrel maze 3
3rd generation of this elephant toothpaste experiment                                                                                                   *Do this with devils toothpaste*
I am a truck driver. I deliver to gridley like 3x a week. How did I miss this ?! Ahhh
The guy used his make a wish to buy another guy a stolen quad big ups!
wow
Mark is definitely the most wholesome person on YouTube
Manual do mundo is watching!
Nice to see some guys still having fun only having their time of their life!
Really shows how bad ur life is compared to the kids in here
People spending a normal day in a forest and seeing a giant green mushroom cloud : tf-
IMAGINE IF THIS THING WAS THE SIZE OF A HOUSE..........
"I have learned that our choices always matter to someone, somewhere. And sooner or later, in ways we can't always fathom, the consequences come back to us." -Daud, Dishonored: Brigmore Witches. The conclusion really reminded me of that quote. They are words I try to live by. Keep being awesome. :)
music at 5:40?
7:44 'Faom daddy'
thaks for bringing happines into the world :)
Your the best
he has to be baked all the time lol
Mark: Have you guys ever been on a private jet? Me: Its not like everyone has one in their backyard or something
Only thing missing is some blunts and liqour 😎
Does the foam just dissolve? or do they have to do something with it?
I literally cried
at 13:19 the bird is going strait up
This is my dream day lol
This is why you dont upload alot bc its takes alot of time to maek it
Lethamyr intro song I see👀👀
Chemical pollution
“I’ve been waiting 4…no…5 thousand years for this!” -Kars
Mark is now officially the internet's cool uncle
This literally restored my faith in humanity and I love that you do things like this for kids who need a little more happiness in their live.
I love when youtubers come together
You are the best
this is the most wholesome american in the world
Imagine if he forgot to record😅
This is so cool
Who Else Felt Happy?
wait WHAT YOU ARE MISTER BEASTS FREND
When it popped out I realized why it's called elephant toothpaste
I AM NOT CRYING!
Great video! Well done Mark Rober!👌👏 The final question; who had the clean up that mess? 😅😂😜🤪
Dude hired an entire town to build this then when he ran out of people resorted to child labor 🤣🤣🤣
Devil toothpast in that flask!!
13.11
When life gives you a mark rober, make the world a better place
Why do I get the feeling that Mark's gonna accidentally give himself 3rd degree burns trying to get another Guinness World Record
Is there a way to like the video more then once lmao
13:48 American measures 100
.efil ruoy ni emitemos em ees uoy siht ees uoy fi
I also wanna come but I live in another country
SO CLOSE TO 20 MILL!!
Use your wish to help somebody else, everybody can learn from this kid.
ok
Congratulations on achieving one of the internet's most useless bragging rights!  I'm sure the money you had laying around for this vanity project could have been spent and/or donated on nothing better!
AMAZING JOB MARK!!!!! You have an amazing heart keep up the great work. ❤🙏😇
Yo my name's Fletcher to that's kina dope
I’m 30 seconds in and I love it already!!
9:55 Rip camera
That was cool
Are they eco-friendly ??
Mega flask vs devils toothpaste
I cry more at Mark’s videos than anything else. He shows the world the best version of humanity.
It's just a chemical reaction between hydrogen peroxide, dish soap and yeast
*UNCLE 100*
How did this channel go from turning sand into a liquid to breaking world records on a daily
Nice work dude , u rock
wat abt polution?
But...COULD you use elephant's toothpaste (or devil's toothpaste) to launch a small rocket ACTUALLY into space? How high could you send a rocket just big enough to take a camera up and bring it back down safely using only elephant's toothpaste as rocket fuel?
Mark supports child slavery confirmed
do it but with devfles
Make it red so it would look like a volcano
Omg I love your channel I’m so glad this vid is finally here!
I respect not wanting to give out the devils toothpaste formula because people could get hurt, but at the same time im really interested to see exactly how and why it works the way it does.
I wonder how long did it take to clean all of that
You're an incredible human being, Mark.  The world is a better place because of you.
That kid could've had a marrow transplant with the money wasted on this video
Such a cool video...
LETS GO MARK YOU DID IT
How
This is what I live for
hey Mark love the vids keep up the amazing work
It's like an elephant toothpaste geyser!
This guy makes science fun
The drone went to space when it went off
So awesome
Pretty dam cool
So for those of us who know nothing about footballs, how many PSI is that?
The best people on the tube-verse make the best content in the tube-verse
imagine what was going through that birds head😂
🍋💥🍋💥🍋
My heart gets really warm watching this. Thank you every time Mark <3
MARK GET DEVILS TOOTH PASTE IN THAT NOW!!!!!
wow this is so popular
Mark Rober for president!!!
This is awesome! Well done Mark.
Happiest people in the world: People with many friends People with a lot of money People who help others Kind people              And people in Mark Rober's family
I love how he told Mr. Beast abt the kid and Mr. Beast also happens to be #1 on trending while Mark is #2.
Talk about some top level planning.  Very touching to see people come together for this
All white people smh
Mark.  We are the same age and your my fav uncle! Never grow up Lost Boys!
That will be something he never forgets
This whole video was amazing, beautiful and wonderful! Bless you!
I knew you wouldn't stop after the last one's failure. Noice!!
12:50
Mark’s done with being his family’s favorite uncle, he’s moved on to be everyone’s favorite uncle.
I think peed a little while watching the toothpaste
amazing
meanwhile... me... 13 yo kid in third world country :(
white ppl holidays 😂
He is BEATING HIS OWN RECORD
Mark has never disappoints me with his fantastic experiments and great videos
bro u are the best dad is the world
What a guy !
What a great video!
Next year make a bigger flask but put a clear tube a person could sit inside inside the tube so that way you are literally in the middle of the chemical reaction. That would be so cool
Mr beast in in de vod
It would be so cool if i have a cousin or a relative like him
The last one sounded like an elephant too
if the devils toothpase can be cought in fire, can it be solid rocket fuel?
I love this channel and I love those people just yes
Who are these kids at the party and how can I become one?
Hi
Ayo fletchers sister low key bad
I’m jealous that you aren’t my uncle
Mark’s the uncle that everyone would dream to have
More accurate: When life gives you lemons... Change a kids life.
"No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."
Genuinely seems kind person unlike most youtubers
what a legend, giving your wish away for another.   this kid deserves all of this .
Fletcher is Wearing the same shirt as he did in the 1st devil toothpaste video!
"I even have child labour to do the work" Mark becoming a billionaire
Pressure is equal to that of a football pushing back at you x 50? What?
legend.
The toothpaste went out of frame in almost every camera shot, that has to be a testament to how it exceeded everyone's expectations even the crew's.
"...all we needed was a 20 second build montage..."  [ Youtube cuts to commercial ]
It actually sounded like an elephant😁
The kid who used his “make a wish foundation” wish to get another kid’s stolen ATV back is so wholesome. I hope my Daughter grows up to be like that kid one day!
Mark isn’t just a genius, he’s funny aswell. Couldn’t stop thinking about being there!  Edit: Why is everyone saying hi in the replies hahaha!
Brody used his one wish to give a kid he never met, that had their atv stolen, a new one. What an absolute legend.
If only everyone was as nice as Brody, imagine how amazing the world would be.
As incredible as this whole thing was, I also wanna point out how amazing the camera work was throughout this video. I mean, the editing in all of the montages was just remarkable. Kudos to all the people behind all of that, as well.
Super!
He has Acquired 3 more children
This guy rocks
If only everyone had an uncle like Mark, the world would be so much better
Mark's videos are not only entertaining and educating but also wholesome.
How did you record this in suck a smooth way it looks like cgi
marks entire crew: literally spending  months in making this set mark: 20 second build montage
He always says that he is on a quest to be the favorite uncle, but who is the other uncle? What legendary hero must he overcome with insane inventions? I want answers.
Dude that kid was so nice and humble... literally giving his make a wish to another kid, he deserves happiness and beyond :)
Ah yes, the best way to make a wooden flask stronger: METAL
imagine sitting in the flask  it's just like a water geyser
Mr.beast elephant toothpaste or this?
"Hey honey! What's that noise?" "Our neighbour's making a volcano" ... "Not again"
yo why does brody look like an absolute stud
Yeeeees!!!!!!
SHEESH MA BAAAAAH
:)
Yo I live close to gridly
Who could possibly give this video  a thumbs down?
This video was beautiful and has me 😭
Anyone else gonna realize mark and David Dobrik are beating each others records evry couple months lol
Not even a single camera could capture to the point of the highest length of the entire fountain
90%+  hydrogen peroxide....thats the secret to the burning leather glove. It's a nasty chemical so I get not wanting people to recreate it
that's a fun party!
I wish everything was as easy as just doing a 20-second montage and then its done
Absolutely awsome
You so deserve that #2 (I assume previously #1) on trending. You just made 2 kids and millions of viewers lives so much more enjoyable to live.
Your the best mark
what I respect is not only did you do this great deed, you helped the community businesses.
YEAA GO BUCS!!
That is sooo awesome I love how you love to help these people no matter how hard the work is
Uhh THE CAMERA SHOTS 🤤🤤😩😩😩🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵❤
Fast forward to 12:35 that’s the build up to the fun.
Who is the person behind those drone shots😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡ Never seen something that incredible before⚡⚡⚡
They put Leths theme song in here
Geart work I wish I could be u one day❤️❤️
Mark's videos are so satisfying
He wasn't kidding when he said 20  sec montage
16:09 *everyone liked that*
The fire trucks were in the background if the flask exploded.
11:26 anyone else recognise this music?🤣
Bro I laughed when you said devils toothpast is volition and can be flammable and you explode it on the house 😂
22h in lmao
now make it 10x larger
waawwwas
i see what he did when he put youtube/markrober so if any one used that footage its kinda like a watermark
You have to make a poster of this photo
What mrbeast?XD
For the orbeez pool: you used the lethamyr intro song. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, search up lehamyr the rocket league YouTuber.
you guys are the best!
Mark is insane with his ideas.
Shark /jump

Bugha...
Wait Mr Beast owns a shirt that doesn't say Mr Beast?!!
I want to be a scientist like you

The envy towards your nieces & nephews is unreal Mark
20M on the way! ❤️
Pour kid
How about 1000 tons tower
HI
10:07 the slowmo guys are gonna love this part
That might not have gotten you twice but the squirrels did…. I love your channel and I want to know when your next squirrel obstacle course will be released and if there even will be a 3rd
What did you do with the massive flask after the video is done
I wanna see the flask but with devil's toothpaste now
i feel like mark rober has enough knowledge to destroy the universe
legend
Could you make a rocket propelled by elephant toothpaste?
5 million hobbies no big deal

Devil's toothpaste formula is quite simple tbh
Benz
Mark Rober has to be the most fun person on earth
poggers
Congratulations
Mark you’re a special kind of guy.  Always watched you for the cool science stuff but helping these kids is really special.  And can we get a round of applause for Brody for giving away his one and only wish to another kid in need!
8:18
13:49 what kind of fun fact is that??
this is co cool, those kids will remember that day forever! mark is an amazing role model and creator
Humans are pretty cool most of the time.
Mark rober shoud be a sincerest ll
This is so sweet until I saw foam daddy 😳
Ummmqmmmmmmmmmm what about social distancing ummmmmmmm uh should i be worried orrrrrrr
is this corny.
that kid giving his one wish to another kid gave me a lump in ma throat that boy is one in a billion human of the year awards need sent to him
How selfish. You should've bought him a $10m house and his own rimac nevera and an rtx3090 at minimum (As i don't want to have to state, jk)
I love that the Town Welder Jeff is using a glove for his trigger hand, and not for the hot hand... (im guilty of this too... lol)
Amazing
maximum wholesomeness
this just gives me goosebumps
I proudly announce the best uncle award tooo, Mark Rober
now can you make in bio luminescent? 😳😂
I really can't believe how you put in that much effort into his videos just to show off his pool body...
This has to be the most wholesome video ever on YouTube mark is such a great person
The editing and the camera use are so amazing!!!!!! You did really wel!
Drones are cool
imagine being someone just driving past here and seeing a huge green cloud explode in the air
How many uncle points do you have?
I am absolutely upset with you, Mark! I live about 15 minutes away from where you did all of this and I didn't get a special invite from you to come help out! Lol In all seriousness though, you are an angel for helping these kids have a blast!!!
This is peak internet
my b-day was sep 1st so this is awesome

What do you do with the elephant toothpaste after the experiment
12:50
13:48 American units are weird.
5 million views in 22 hours  🤯
Im not crying.. you are. You are an awesome person Mark!
Now make a rocket using the devils toothpaste
Imagine putting a giant balloon on top of it that would fill and explode with devils toothpaste. That would be crazy
So no ones gonna talk about the INSANE editing?
song at 2:45 ?
Congrats on 2nd on trebdinge
Yesterday was my birthday, the 4th. This is the best birthday gift.
Did they use an FPV drone for some of the shots? it looks like an FPV drone which is awesome. Edit: They actually did, you can see the pilot at 15:14 , nice
That girl kinda cute tho
It's Mr beast😱🤩
A new way to learn science
This is the wholesome content I needed today. Thank you!
Im not crying, you're crying!!!!
Mark simply can’t make a bad video
Mark's mention of the pressure in the flask sounds like a bad math problem 😂  Soo roughly 650psi??
Mark Rober has the more effort in his videos than anyone else i’ve ever seen
Dope
any diversity in this video??
10:02   Can’t stop wondering it looks like the sun
Beautiful ending...
Every video you make makes me even more speachless, you are amazing
A way to ruin the planet..
Mark you must be at like 80 trillion uncle points by now :)
I am scutch a big fan.
8:01 wdym I'm thinking about Tommy? Naaaaaah

I know you're moving to more focus on a younger and more mainstream crowd but ngl i do miss the more scientific videos you would make
Now every time I go to the doctor I’ll be sure to bring a bathing suit.

mark is the guy who has 1174 candy bars in the math problem
Mark is mr beast but science edition
This is how Schools in 2021 should be!
Pressure in the flask is 50 times the force of a fully inflated football.... 12.5psi x 50 = 625psi = 43 bar (atmospheres)
WHY DOES HE ALWAYS MAKE ME END UP CRYING AT THE END... AGGGH i HATE U MARK BUT I LOVE U
Bro that volcano
Gulpin
Must be nice to have more money than sense!
Absolutely gave me goosebumps to see this successful experiment, congratulations Mark!!
What would happen if you were able to profile that nozzle to allow for greater atomization. Put it on its to the side and put it on a vehicle.  You could have an elephant toothpaste tank.
Heartwarming - well done Mark.
Videos only been out for 22 hours pulling 5 mil views. Marks the goat
Why is it called elephant toothpaste?

Next mark rober video is going to be; Making a rocket ship powered by elephant toothpaste
Thanks for the video, you make amazing content 👏 👌 keep it up
This could be a fun alternative to fireworks. Just make it glow in the dark.
Nobody was in the flask?! Some people don’t know what fun is
Colorful popcorn
World hunger...  U no what  Lets do this bS!!!
One of the most banging vids yet.... Amazing content Mark!
13:45 that's a complicated way to just say 50 Bar🤣🤣
7:29 Uh...Mark, that’s not a peace sign. Nice try though buddy. Looking forward to the rest of the video when I go to lunch. In about 3 years (its a 12hr day)
Ok

Really impressive great work! I loved the video!
Uh oh, looks like someone ate taco bell.

U need to be a science teacher
Dang. I love everything you do and everything you stand for. But. I'd like to watch your videos without the threat of crying.
We need more videos like this, and make the next one devil's toothpaste in the flask, just to see what happens
Love the fact that even the Mayor came out to watch it
Wonderful
Epic that’s all I’m going to say
Yes sir Kamara!
What if this was turned inTO A ROCKET!?
Living dat science life!
Now I waiting to see Elon Musk In one of his video
"I even harnessed some child labour"
imagine denying going to the doctor not knowing there’s a party waiting for you specifically
Mark really wants a world record huh?
Imagine being a bird who was flying over the flask when that happened
9:55 what is the music here?
the guy has issues
Mark you have out dun you’re self today
I’m crying at the beauty of this. All of it. Thank you Mark.
This video really puts into perspective how many things a engineer has to take into account and all the people you need to with there different expertise
Wow that was amazing!
Woo-hoo! Oh yeah! So satisfying, especially after the last tower. Must have felt great nailing it this time! No such better feeling than when you get the results you work hard for.  Congrats to you and Happy Birthday to you Brody. You're an awesome soul!!!
these are very educating but... mark makes these very educating
Seeing all this awesome stuff and the happy people makes one surely wish to be happy once again...

Wonderful person
Congrats Mark

Dayum how-

I never wait for a mark rober video but am also thankful that I watch them
Who ever stole that ATV deserves jail time
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Mark truly is the best uncle
this guy would still get second place in a public school science fair.
The drone is like WAIT FOR MEEEE
When do you get the time for this stuff!?!
This is what happens when you combine kindness with science!
Hello mrbweast
Mark Broke Another World Record For That Flask
As someone actively studying chemistry, you have no idea how much I want that Devil' s Toothpaste formula. Could make for a cool demo down the line.
That was Massive.
At 13:45 if you listen closely it sounds like some of the metal is bending as it comes out the top
I can never look at MrBeast the same way since the meat canyon video.
Formula 1 noise
Toothpaste commercials have never been better
Worlds tallest elephant toothpaste volcano? TRY DOING DEVILS TOOTHPASTE TO MAKE IT A REAL VOLCANO EACH HOUSE HALL BE ARSONED
We can all agree Mark has the best job in the world
Mark rober I have to say it but you like tooth paste

That's amazing.
Do you people actually realize that this is the kind of things that make scientists conclude that it is impossible for for the world to live a life like Americans? The amount of resources and human labor put into this, insane!, and the worst thing is that in the end it will produce nothing useful for society besides entertainment through YouTube… no food was produced, no health service was provided, and no education came out of it…
This is my kingdom come...
he broke the world record and he literally mentioned it once .whats a badass
What’s your budget  Mark: Yes
Been waiting for an improved version for so long. Since the first video came out
Mark is the only hero who deserves a cape
Doctor Fletcher! haha
Me at 3am: 14:18
Mr bist
Trying to reenact his terrible doctors accent somewhat sounds like “ oh yeah it’s a coming together now”
Anybody know what brand the shorts/swimsuit Mark is wearing in this video? They look C O M F Y.
Ok but what about the truck that got FLOODED
This is so wholesome I actually teared up
What a RAD kid.
When Mr beast, Mark rober, Markiplier, and DanTDM upload ON THE SAME DAY
Nice
It was amazing.....
hahahaha
Mark is a Godsend for all of us especially during a time of a pandemic.  The only greater Godsend are the many volunteers who helped support making this boy’s dreams come true.
الخمر حرام
So are you able to flip this thing on its head to make a rocket?
Could we get a flask like this that shoots fire retardent paste ? We could roll a 18 wheeler and just paste zones...
My question is where do you put all of it after
Can we get a mark rober soundtrack plz
mark is looking kinda wham you na
Moral of the story, this is why all ingredients need to be put on labels!!! Lol throwing off science over here.
Mark Rober really knows how to throw a party!
I love the total overkill of the new flask
Thanks
One of the best YouTube video ever
Mark has many friends but his greatist, is the 20 secand montage
Was there a special thanks destin/slowmoguys in there somewhere as well? :)  Amazing work, amazing production, amazing outcome. You are a gem!
Where da hoes at Mark Rober????
موسيقى واثم وكذا يعني...
This guy is such a legend
إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ ۖ وَكَانَ الشَّيْطَانُ لِرَبِّهِ كَفُورًا (٢٧)
Mark is undoubtedly one of the best youtubers out there, change my mind ;)
Could I possibly feel ANY better after watching this?  I don't think so! Wow... happy feeling all around in that video. Some those shots were insane!!! Slo-Mo on a Drone????  Best... shots.... EVER!!! The smiles just don't stop.  Thanks, Mark!
what is the environmental impact of this video?
Fantastic job💥💥💥
no you guys don’t understand i love this dudes videos
Give the formula for Devil's Toothpaste to NileRed. Anyone who watches him actually knows the risks of working with chemicals
Why does Mark Rober make me cry?
yoooooo
The last one was better tho
Not +1 Uncle points. But +1000000 Uncle points cus of the party

Why is nobody caring that he jokingly said that he did child labor to paint?
Reasons why I should learn how to swim 7:20

Oops 😬 at 12:48  thank me later
There is nothing better than a 20 second built montage

Mark Rober: Amazing dad Amazing engineer Amazing party planner
How many uncle points have you accumulated?
20 second build montage: **filmed**    Literally everything: **appears**
This lowkey looks like mac and cheese 10:04
He deserves a 100mil

That Draft King swerve at the end lol

I want to see mrbeast one day
This is just awesome and wholesome... thx Mark!
Mark this is amazing! What happens to the orbis after you're done using them?
Great video!
The best uncle doesn't exi-
Do you have a platform where we guys can donate for those kinda parties that you throw for those kids?
Mr Beast at the insane asylum getting therapy?
Uhgyhjj
Nice mark
The person who cleans this mess: i don’t get payed enough for this
Living life to the fullest is what this guy does best!
Love how mark was probably more excited than the kids because of how well it worked 😂
Who thinks mark rober should do the worlds largest sodium and water experiment
mark i just did it. its in my yard.. am launching it.. OMGG my house is inside Lemon taste Elephant toothpaste.. NOOO!!
Great work! You can see the time and commitment @markrober puts into his content.  Amazing to watch
That was pretty sweet
Mark Rober is the cool uncle
"Friend Mrbeast" Mrbeast: call me Jimmy
its astoundingly similar the the geysers at Yellowstone
Mark is just a really smart kid at heart
Awesome camera work in this video
Mark is a living legend. Thanks for being you.
He has done it again
he is the real life tony stark
Mark rober makes fun look funner
All the way to Youtube Rewind let's go!
07:43 foam daddy
You are given permission to enter heaven, enlightened one you know whom needs help, even if it comes at your cost
Yesssssssss
My WiFi kept glitching while I was watching this video and so it kept pausing at really the most dramatic moments possible.
What schools think will happen to boys when they see a girls shoulder 13:12
this is a pretty big factor as to why children really hope to get some life threatening disease
I’m finishing your class today 😁
You’re awesome, Mark. Nuff said.
The world needs more people like mark and brody
Bravo!!!
Chemistry is heccing dope!
This is insane and I love it but I can’t be the only one imagining how much work and money went into this lol
WOWW
Amazing video
Oh no I broke my neck I sure hope mark rober throws me a party to cheer me up
It was most heartwarming
do it again with brown food coloring
another wholesome video. ❤️❤️❤️love from Ph🇵🇭 ❤️❤️❤️
Another example where "hard work always pays off"
*”This is my kingdom come”*
I feel BAD for everyone has to claen that all up
Cooooooool
几乇山 ㄚ乇卂尺 几乇山 卩卂尺ㄒㄚ
what if one day the drone gets picked up and fried by the devils toothpaste
Sometimes I wonder if these kids (especially if they get more than one of these experiences) will be sad as adults because their adult life can't compare to their childhoods. Because seriously this looks like quite possibly the most fun a human can have in this day and age.
10:22 those thorns tho...
Me watching this video: As a lifeguard, I am so happy to see there was a lifeguard on duty for the pool. As someone who is allergic to artificial food colouring, happy I stay away from purple food colouring. And me smiling the whole way though just see the kids have fun.
i just learned mark edit his own videos , not only an great engineer amazing editor too
you are so nice
Mark Rober: #1 trending   Mr Beast: *uploads* and takes it   Mark: :(
Why not a elephant toothpaste rocket?
"I don't give out the formula because" I'm scared that other people would beat my record
I can dream too😥😥😥
And this is only the beginning..
Amazing !!
I wouldn’t be surprised if mark in 2030 will erupt a volcano
i like how marks is video is 2nd trending and 1st is like always is mrbeast
Hehehe Lethamyr Music
Same experiment but with devils toothpaste?
He is just going to make a volcano sized flask in the future.
You should team up with Anne Reardon from how to cook that. She is a food scientist who has been attempting to debunk viral videos that are extremely unsafe, especially on children's channels. If enough YouTubers get together and say this is not okay, maybe YouTube, will actually do something about unsafe content on its platform!
Dude I wish I was Brody rn
Mark Rober: Endgame
Mark tell me how you do those timelapse shots or i will elephant toothpaste you to the fricking sun
Algorithm
Thanks for the vid Mark.  My kids love your vids.
7:00 some insanely cool graphics that my $12 tab can handle even at 480p
Slomo guys vibes
year 2050 your vids will be about going to space XD and also working with elon musk lol
Note to self get a life threatening disease to have an absurdly amazing day and make a video with marl rober
Back???
I like your sayings I will describe to all your videos

Yaaay

15:11 just looking at that house and view is just amazing
can mark go on a ride above the karman line
What!!!! #22 Trending in India did not see that coming btw fun & nice video.
Imagine being related to mark rober
STOP MAKING ME CRY MARK!!!
All the technical know-how and expertise to engineer and fabricate the funnel and couldn't figure out to combine colours to get purple lol
*Instructions unclear I accidentally built a six ton flask And blasted it to the Milky Way* Yeah, the Milky Way..
Let’s go Mark
Why didn't you use a Minecraft bed to reset day.
yessir a new video
Mark has a pretty big heart to keep doing stuff like this and some serious determination to make up for an L be was handed
13:03, that background noise sounds actual like an elephant lmao
Yay
This is, arguably, the best channel on YouTube.
Yes he finally posted
Wow
This is the kind of thing that could just never happen in my neighborhood, or even my area in general. Love these videos.
Mark truly has an incredible mind and an amazing heart
This needs to at least hit 200 million views like wow
omg 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤤
sometimes when he describes the construction I don't at all understand but I still find it entertaining
Get him to 20 million he deserves it
Get that drone pilot a raise!
More of us need to be as selfless as Brody.
my cheeks hurt from smiling so much. that was a very wholesome video
Billion dollar idea: Mark Roper theme park
💛
Mark Rober deserves so much more for making these amazing videos
I love mark robers ideas
Can orbeez be recycled or...?
Feeding the algorithm
Hehehe the children are coming for you
Gavin! Has anybody seen Gavin!
I just want to say that your like 3 places above trending on this video and I think you deserve it. This took so much time and effort.
She

13:59 when thanks snaps in infinity war
JOLIE
Nvm
Sana oll brody..
:(
I still have it
The bottom blowing out of the first one... You know, that whole Newton-thing...
That happened to me to
Do so many more of these pls Not just cause I enjoy them But because it makes so many people happy
The world doesn't deserve the one Mark Rober we have, but we definitely need more of him
That was superfun
Mark is smart to not give out the secret formula for devils toothpaste. Well done truly.
i swear.... mark nephews are the luckiest people on earth to have an cool uncle
You are a role model for many kids here in India also mark
This is a viral video if I've ever seen one! It has everything 😃
Ah yes, the 20 second build montage
Elephant toothpaste rocket
Really hopes he pays all these people. He makes insane amounts of money off these videos.
Mark you have to make a something that makes a whirlpool an a pool
You a truly wonderful person; not only for your own efforts but for your ability pull in so many others to pitch in to beautiful things.
Anyone that gave this video a thumbs down must b living a miserable life
you don't understand how much i want to go back to my childhood and move next to your house so im always entertained
I hope I can one day be half the amazing person Broedy and Mark is! Videos like this makes me want to be a better person ^^
Sana all.
Can you be my uncle?
Go to time stamp 8:38
So much love mark my heart can’t handle
all the different angle camera shots were INSANE!
I LOVED IT
so cool
Just gg, that's all i have to say.
insane
Bro this editing is on point
Did anyone else notice at 2:45 the song he is using for the montage is colt 45?
Fletchers sister is kinda cute
This is my favorite YouTube channel.
Is this stuff edible
Bro imagine if he didn't record this XD
I’m clapping rn
“Oops I’m on the trending tab, hope this won’t be ending bad”
That looked like an amazing day.
Imagine doing a gender reveal like that
How is fletcher doing? Awesome Video
16:09 Brody 😳
Aren't those orbeez a huge choking hazard? Jumping into pool filled with orbeez with open mouth....
tbh the devil toothpaste look like popcorn when they explode
Can you imagine how much it would suck to clean this up XD!
You should try to make a devil's toothpaste powered rocket
How would you even clean the devil's tooth paste of the house?
this video giving me like 8 emoituins
marks videos are not only entertaining and educating but also wholesome.
12:56 i thought ed Sheeran was in the back
"whatever you do that you expect nothing in return, it always comes back."
epic
Breh
let’s go 😳
That was totally awesome 👌 👏 👍  Excellent job Mr. Rober & Mr. Beast  💚❤💙
I love how the camera shot wasn't high enough to see the top!
u deserve 100 million subscribers
What if I have the world’s strongest gloves
what if you used the giant flask like a rocket? how high would it go?
Heck yeah.
bruh im just crying tears of joy rn
Mark, not only are you a great engineer, but you are an even better human.  I salute you sir!
And next year, turn the flask upside down and let the toothpaste blast the flask into space. :D
This is so awesome, what a fantastic role model Mark is
Always trust the foam daddy to make things fun
Mark gave those kids an unforgettable experience :')
I’m in ur class
Next time try to flood an area with devils toothpaste it would look cool (ofc an empty area with easy cleanup not a forest or something)
Just like Tony Stark, Mark Rober is also secretly a military contractor
Now I wait to ever see if Nilered and Mark Rober ever meet
The birds must be so confused
People can use this for gender reveals.
Now all we need is a elephant toothpaste rocket
The drone shots were insane
I love your vids
I love you doing this for the kids, but you could do something for every kid on the planet if you did something more environmentaly responsibil than flying them in a privat jet
My adult brain can't stop but thinking, who's gonna clean all that? xD
All of this is a brilliant act of kindness.  However that jet from a benefactor seems familiar  Maybe Mr beast
This is just fantastic
You're the best!
@nurkfpv works with MARK NOW???!??? best. crossover. ever
fletcher must be watching proudly knowing he helped catalyse this
This gives me hope in humanity. If you ever lose hope, know that there are great people in the world too!
He’s the scientific Mr. Beast
just jump to 12:59..  your welcome.
Yes!!!!!!!
Lethamyr?
I keep hearing Lethamyr’s intro in this vid
Youre like the kind of person the world needs more of it ❤
Ibere ta fudido
How much you wanna Bet The 'mysterious' person who loaned The jet was Jimmy himself
We need more people like Mark 👍
Your amazing
Did you frown at ANY POINT while you watched this video?  Smiles galore!
Ah yes. Child labor for the devil and his toothpaste 😂
as a fellow lifeguard, i respect the hustle hiring them
GO SAINTS!
The Orange devils toothpaste looked  like a fireball
The scream at 4:19 please that's the best sound I've heard all year
Mark Rober isn't afraid of elephant toothpaste  But is afraid of a kid with paint in his hand
Bro, it look's like the pod from apollo mission, not elephant toothpaste "launcher"
Edutaiment
LETZ GOOOO! Mark Rober you are one of the most impressive youtubers ever
Mark is always up to something
What if, dark brown elephant toothpaste ;-)
how can someone be soo cool and wholesome at the same time is honestly baffling. Keep up the great work!
Seems like Mark did this for himself more than anything
The flask looks like a gemini capsule
I would give the janitor a 10 hour break for this
I love every single one of your videos, I have watched so far. And I cannot wait to see the next one. P.S you are an amazing guy and so so so wholesome.=)
They should use these at celebrations. Mark might make a fortune out of those
All this, and i struggle for rent and food -.-
The kids should of picked the Tesla ride  Road trips reign supreme over any form of travel (Not including the emissions part)
Mark is the most genuine YouTuber I know. He puts so much time and effort into each creation and u can literally se how excited he gets when it goes well
The 1 and only :)
14:27
im 1000% sure that this breaks several laws regarding the current state of the plannet but who needs those when you get the wr elephant toothpaste/devils toothpaste height record
Mark Rober can literally do anything..
The money the time and most the experience
Do u watch football 🏈
That’s all you gotta do is get some Union ironworkers to come build/weld it bro it’s not going anywhere 🤣 get the best of the best
The cameramen in this video did a really fantastic job.
Mark rober is like that cool chemistry teacher we all want 😅
8:40 devils toothpaste recipe

I wish I knew Mark:(
11:23 lethamyr coming in?
Make an Elaphant toothpaste rocket!
Anyone know wat that song is at 2:33 been looking for it for literal yrs lol
Wow it's really great to see this!  I've one question though, if you cover the top with a breakable seal, can you raise the pressure more to extend the height of the eruption? There is still some spare  power which not is used with the first eruption.
got no idea how happy I am to see this
You are doing such a great job ✨✨✨❤️
Am I the only one who realized at 11:10 that was lethamyr's intro song?
I feel like mark is trying to re live his child hood and be cool but using the wrong age group and slickly disguising it as science
Wow that is just awesome ❤
I love your videos!
I love that it even sounded like an elephant. So cool
You know what, your a pretty cool guy
I almost cried at 1:20
Next:launching a piece of bread in space
I want to be like you.
Mark Rober never let me down, wooow, amazing!

All the kids: omg thats so cool Mark rober: I FINALLY DID IT WHOOHOOW
Perfect science experiment for school!

Mark rober and mr beast are the MVPs of youtube

Mark Rober is an amazing person!!!!
Woah no way. I really wanna see what if the it didnt lift up after watching the original video..... i alr forget how long since i watch the last video but to randomly see this video upload 19hour ago. No wayyy

Next video: I went back to NASA because they want to use elephant toothpaste to go to mars.
Epic job
"Life is not measured by the breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away" You have a very big heart Mr. Rober, well done !
Well done Mark congratulations on the World record
Mark Rober isnt the guy we wanted but needed
:)
That was epic @mark rober. Personally I think the toothpaste could ho higher like you explained in the last video of the diameter of the opening but I guess that's a story for another time. That devils toothpaste was remarkable would like to see it fill a stadium..... Colours of the spectrum...
nice
Hello
He could make an hour long video like this and I would watch the whole thing lol
So what was the pressure? Because that analogy made no sense
12:43  for the show
so wholesome.... <3
St Patrick's day would've been ideal for that
1:56 when the FBI is breathing down your neck
Yesss child labor the only way to go

imagine living across the street and just seeing some random dude blasting rainbow foam on his house
I honestly can't believe you're still on the quest to be the favorite uncle. I'd think you have the spot for life, Mark.
11:15 Lethamyr's intro
Brody is the real hero
Almost 5 million views in less then 24 hours. That's baller
imagine being in an airplane and just seeing that down below
I honestly can't believe you're still on the quest to be the favorite uncle. Think you earned the spot for life, Mark.
Every other color: perfectly fine Purple: *oh jeez more chemicals? come on in!*
Mark is the coolest uncle to have
I think it could be higher with an appropriate nozzle
So this is just like the last kid but bigger and better nice
The best uncle you’d never have
Love it
You made him happy, and something big will come to you in returns
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark you really does know how to throw a party . 🥳
My birthday is coming on 11 September and I wish I had some party like this

#2 on trending Let's go

Too much family
The guys who helped this are legends
The world's greatest uncle
This is…     *INSANE*
Please, never stop making these videos! 👌🏼🤩
Is it called elephants toothpaste because of the sound it makes when it comes out?
Wow just incredible
Now do the same but with a laminar flow nozzle.
10:04 Looks like the sun when zoomed in
I wish yoiu were my uncle
nice
It sure looks fascinating and beautiful, but the question is, how do you clean it all up?
we  need more people like you in this world
11:29 anyone watch Lethamyr
I can’t- not without fainting- Your ideas- 🤍🖤mind blown- 🤍🖤
We all wish we had a cool uncle like Mark =)
Planting trees to save the planet, taking a private jet for fun. I dunno.
Is the devils Elephant toothpaste made out of H2O2?
Just curious why ppl down vote. Don't they like seeing ppl happy and having fun
mad props to that drone pilot
Why are there random mannequins throughout the video? XD
lethamyrs intro
It went so high that even the drone couldn't capture it
very cool
I feel smarter when I watch u hahah
idea that ur probably not gonna see :')  : make an elephant toothpaste rocket.... and actually send it to the sky... surely doable with the correct flask material and aerodynamics
idk how u would stop this, but at 13:18 there are still leakages
This is epic
14:14  That got me cringing
Something tells me dr fletcher  aint a real doctor
Who’s Dale? 15:47
you are cool
13:01 Me when your.... when... when your mom... when... when... when I.... when your... when...
he's the greatest uncle anyone could've imagine
imagine the competition the other uncles of the children must have XD
Next video idea I made a nuke of devils toothpaste
THANKS
Turn the tube upside down for a rocket
Next year @MarkRober I think you need to build an actual elephant toothpaste rocket.🚀🚀
Where is this all white town?
W H Y?
Why does it feel like Mark Robers is gonna invent orbital cannons
So he learnt rocket science only for this  NASA is proud of him 😇😇    Edit: this is just a joke. I'm a big fan of your Mark!
That's looks so coool
This is just awesome 👍
This video deserve billion views
PLs make a 3 squirrel maze!
Don't you think it's kinda weird that there is no coloured people in this video?

1:57 Russian Revolution in a nutshell
I love how we’re  going to school eating my lunch playing Minecraft this man’s making huge volcanoes sitting world records it shows How small each one of us are Compared to people like this
I know the formula to devils toothpaste (:   50 ml of 50% H202 25 grams of sodium iodide and dish soap and a few drops of food coloring
Dear Mark Rober, when i watching many videos of your actions: there is small problem. How can many children's experience this? Now it's always 5-12 children's and i bet thousands children's want try it too. I feel some jealously from some children's... Its not fair why they cannot experience it.  That makes the biggest question: Where is the Mark Rober's Theme Park? So others can try out fun stuff you did in many videos. Real life experience is way more different than video watching. Any future plans for it?
Even me Peter Griffin Loves This !
That kid is a hero and what you all did for him is equally as amazing. Fun but really touching content
He is a brother I never had
You have a giant foam canon called foam daddy
Wowowowowo
Epic
They even had a fire truck in case the devils toothpaste would catch on fire
Only one word for this. Wholesome.
Me sitting at home in lockdown
That’s beautiful. The things you do for these amazing kids is so amazing.
Why do 3.3K people thumbs down?
next time he will plan a birthday party where the kid goes to  space
This guy is literally the coolest guy ever, everyone should aspire to be like him
6.58 whats the girls ig she hella pretty
Amazing Video keep it up thats soo cool
bru
You're like a COOL RICK and those children are you're MORTY'S 💯
I wouldnt mind longer building montage, not saying it should be, just saying I wont mind.
but your nemises is the 1 thing giving you 4m vews in 1 day
Mark rober and Mr beast making the world a better place
CALL CONGRESS !!!  TELL them NO TO DRAFTING GIRLS or they are out !!!
Imagine Mark Rober being our uncle.
Mrbeast:- NANI?
How do you measure the height of the elephants toothpaste?
MR BEAST WAT
Mark where have you been I've missed your videos
12:51
What i find even more impressive than all the cool stuff in the video, is the careful choreography of all that cameras to get those shots. Drones, numerous other cameras and i bet lot's of people with directions to make this possible to create something awesome. I wonder how the filming looked behind the scenes, would be super cool to see that too!
I’ve been waiting for you to do another elephant toothpaste video it’s been so long dude
trying to be the next just some guy with a moustache
love it keep it up
they say the more you give the more you get
if he keeps doing vids like this he's gonna get meatcanyoned
You're such a cool and amazing person mark. I wish there were more people in the world like you.
this is why i rather watching this type of educational videos rather than other "home science" videos where ignore the common sense of food and it's hazards
Can u be my uncle pls
He just accidentally feeds the internet a material for many inappropriate memes to come.
What’s with the rainbow colours?
Nurkfpv💞💞💞
you can make a video about anything - just hire some help!
WOWOWOWOOWO
i feel like the kid didn’t care at all lol. he seemed so uncomfortable the entire time. idk why he would be, everything mark did was awesome
Or it doesnt come back, but that doesnt matter, because youre not helping others to help yourself. Either way did fletcher get to keep his record certificate?
People like him are People who make me smile
how  can  we make  devls toothpast
Mark rober is a amazing person
You had to do it in front of the house..
feeling like mark robers life goal is to impress kids with science in the funnest way possible
after mark rober finishes his new build be like : him : it woulden't be from a lack of effort
Faith in humanity: restored
How did the earth create something like this😂🤣
E
I was suprised to find the lethamyr intro here
Wow.
He really did all that just for a YouTube video that nobody is gonna watch in 2 years
15:19 MrBeasts beard has grown so long
Girl: Babe, come over Me: I can't, I'm too far away Girl: I have Shrek 5 Me: 13:44
7:50 this is my kingdom come
@david dobrik
Imagine getting a like from Mark Rober
i wonder that should happen if you use 2 of those gigantic flask and devils toothpaste and you connect them through 1 pipe would it be even higher
Are the orbires like landing on dirt or something else?
Mark Rover took toothpastes to a whole new level
Mark can litterly make a little space ship
Vai deixar Iberê?
Think about it there may only be around 10-50 people in the entire world that know the recipe to devils toothpaste
thumbs up
Devils toothpaste in the flask instead of elephant toothpaste
9:36 This is how I want to come out on my 18th birthday. If I know my dad won’t be supportive, I at least know that I came out in a really big way, which should balance out the negatives.
Wow
Devils toothpaste must contain potassium permanganate? Never seen something set fire to a glove other than that
MrBeast record break🤯🤯🤯
Awhhhhh... another great event !
This fills my heart with joy. Thank you so much for being such an awesome person, Mark!
4,5 million view in 18hours !
Marks reaction when his things work is just priceless
Fletcher after seeing you broke his record and throw a even bigger party for Brody.😐😐😐🤬🤬🤬
You should put it upside-down and make a rocket!
you truly restore my faith in humanity.
Tip it upside down and you’ve got a mark rober rocket
Mark loves his elephant/devils toothpaste
show us the cleanup
Mark Rober is probably the best youtuber in the world
What if you got the flask opening smaller wouldn't it affect it drastically.
biz bu dünyaya  başkalarını izlemek için gönderilmişiz
What goes around, Comes around, Giving his bike away to another kid shows this kid has Generous heart. Awesome video, so what's next?...  A Elephant Toothpaste Volcano with multiple tubes inside to fire multiple colours?... with some type of pressure system inside to allow the overflow that drops over the sides to continue reaching for the skies?
Literally one of the best youtubers out there and also one of the most wholesome persons the world has to offer! Mark Rober makes watching him a duty, because if you don't you are doing something wrong in your life
imagine it just didnt work after a year of work it didnt even come out the flask, imagine.
The dizzy bail distinctly sip because treatment appropriately reach minus a wacky clam. bright, clear cardboard
Heartwarming stuff, I'm not crying, you're crying!
How bizarre humanity is, let’s make elephant toothpaste go high…  Well personally I’d had tried to end poverty within the deprived neighbourhoods. Nevermind though. Not everyone’s like me
dam that least 20 feet
I wanna be this kind of uncle but sadly I can't even understand the letters on math..
this is super wholesome, my water taste like sugar.
THAT WAS CRAZYYYY
Nice video- great to see what you do for the kids, and to have Mr beast involve made it even sweeter.
BROOOOO
The description of uncle.
Devils toothpaste looks like scrambled eggs
Before I realized that wasn't a person, when that hand caught on fire my heart skipped a beat
it launched earth back to it's orbit.
amazing video
Mark Rober could just build a toaster and I'd still rewatch it.
I know the devil thoothpaste recepie
This is cool but did you know that the koala has one of the lowest ratios of brain to body mass of any mammal.
Love your content, thank you!
Mark's videos are not only entertaining and educating but also wholesome.
This felt like a whole movie
Is it possible to... well basically turn it upside down and pretty much make a rocket? I kinda wanna see what that looks like
And how much is 50 inflated footballs in normal, non freedom unts?
The atoms atoms In the sky: so how was... LOOK OUT!
This video really puts into perspective how many things a engineer has to take into account and all the people you need to with there different expertise
You are a beautiful human being, Mark. The world would be a better place if everyone aspired to be a tiny bit more like you every day.
Very nice, but i bet it could be even more impressive without the internal tanks, and some more paste. There gotta be a way to pur a huge amount in, from the top of the flask.
And you did it again. Best uncle ever.
What about Mr Beast
11:18 - 11:20 omg mark is *JACKED*
This video is all smiles. Well done Mark
This guy really knows how to have fun.
Okay... So this is why we had a mild earthquake over here(in India) 😂😂
Heirs to realising true potential.
Mark rober the best uncle
❤❤
this is just my favorite channel
Nice
Mark: I even harnessed some child labor FBI: FBI OPEN UP Soviet Union: *i n t e r e s t i n g*

Ur new drone guy deserve a raise 😍
Ok so you won't tell us your recipe for the improved peroxide catalyst but can you at lest tell us what the thrust increase could be in a rocket engine using your catalyst over the traditional potassium permanganate?
When you have funding from mr beast you know that will be the best thing ever
this deserves more than 1080p... wheres the 4k footage or 1440p even?
Don’t we all want mark to be our uncle
sooo do you wanna plan my wedding ooor..??
You can't help but make us other uncles look bad, can ya? 🤣 Great stuff Mark as always! Keep if up!
Pog
My mind before watching the video: Another one? My mind after: awesome
Great vid
Always a pleasure to watch your videos. The joy and wonder you spread is truly amazing.
now do the opposite and make the world's highest devils toothpaste rocket
Wait this is new?
child labor......????
Holy Sh*t! This is wholesome as usual!
What if you did this with devils toothpaste? Would it go even higher??
Bigger, better, stronger, faster ???!!!
OMG, NO WORDS!
Isn't this elefant toothpaste an environmental disaster? I'm wondering about this...
How do you clean these
Instructions unclear, my elephant died when I tried cleaning its mouth.
Again?!
And here am I
I always wondering how you clean up and dispose the orbis later? 🤔
pleace dont drive with kids in the car while recording holding your phone
That's.......tall
nice
THAT WAS AMAZING
We have too much of everything. This will stop soon.
The obtainable kangaroo laterally brake because box prospectively inform as a gray greasy great feeling. boundless, special comma
Wait can you be used to propel something
I wouldnt be surprised if he did this next year.
DUDE I wish i would be one of those kids
Best Channel on YouTube!
When u say child labour and yt strikes a wholesome video
This isn’t even a you tube video anymore, wauw.
Imagine having mark rober as an uncle  That's a dream come true
Mark is quite possibly singlehandedly keeping the orbees manufacturers in business
congrats on beating your own world record
Simply awesome video!!!!!
Imagine being related to this guy. For real though he and everyone around him seem so cool and nice. And doing stuff like this for the more unfortunate is so cool of them. Keep up the great work y'all! You're bringing joy and sparking the creativeness and kindness in others hearts!
I love how mark rober puts max effort to all of the things he does.
The best part of science, trial and error, then success finally happening. Also, you are so nice for doing these kinds of things for people!
Can we have a montage of how you clean up the orbes pool because they are pretty hard to dispose of?
wait MR BEAST IS YOUR FRIEND???????
Где комментарий Мамикса?
World record
It's so tall it goes out of frame!
"Mark, we're going to make a highlight reel of some of your best projects so far" Mark: "Nah, lemme just do them again"
Mark rober is basically Mr. Beast, they made people happy and they made funny experiment. the only difference of both of them is that mark rober are much more smarter
Xd
yoooooooooo
Is it just me or did this video have way better video quality then his previous ones
The wholesomness is HUUUUGE.
everytime I watch an mark rober video my respect for him increases alot
the 3.2K thumbs down are all those kids from high school he beat at the science fairs.
Imagine being a Mark Rober son
Mark, im abou your age, but please adopt me.
He makes it look easy
Such a wonderful thing you did for Brody and all these kids. For the life of me I can't understand who would ever give this a thumbs down. WTG Mark.
POV your lost and see this in the distance 😥
Definitely the best person on YouTube
This is getting so over-the-top americanized
Who else, looking for MrBeast's comment???
2 v 3  Mark Robert Technoblade
THAT WAS AMAZING WELL DONE MARK
he's like a young, hip, scientific santa claus.  Every kids dream to meet him and experience the merry he brings.
U flicking madman
Finally a YouTube that makes science seem run and not that difficult even though it is :’)
meh
I can make a bigger one 1 sec      Sneezes*
Kids this days won't wish for a Santa, they want Mr. Beast and Mark Rober instead.
this is a certified hood eplosion
Wait, the first devil’s toothpaste attempt was already a year ago?
Who needs make a wish when you got this guy?
So much time, work, energy and money for such stupidity.
Sponsored by Tesla
Can't wait for next year when you quintuple the height again.
Mark Rober throws great parties.
*FINALLY WE DID IT*
Well done mark! You deserverd that record!
in germany we say: absoluter ehrenmann
This guy is a legend
Gender reveal party’s be like
It will always come back
Best uncle lol
i have missed your vid i love you
Song at 11:15 is called Fasion - No Cry.
imagine it's used to scare off predator
Nice vid
When we needed elephant tooth paste videos from mark...he returned
I stand by my previous comment that Guinness are meaningless hacks. Humans set their own records
Brody's mom has got it goin' on!
seeing this restores the fate i have in humanity
Mark Rober is basically MrBeast, but science.
can i get 1obeer plz
YESSSSSS
Mark rober next year: I launched Elephant toothpaste on mars.
holy moly that was insane!!!!!
Nothing to say except just… wholesome.
how do you guys clean this mess?
2 of mr.beast video is trending :)
DID YOU MAKE A VOLCANO?
11:11 is lethamyr intro
"I even harnessed some child labour"are words I never thought I would hear on this channel
I feel like you can still get it better the stream wasnt steady it sterted out but that was still awesome
Amazing
Best videos on YouTube bar none
next video: "world's largest elephant toothpaste rocket"
Btw if u are wondering how did Mark rober create the devils toothpaste, well he just used a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide, devils toothpaste needs 50% or so concentration of hydrogen peroxide, btw this is the same chemical used to create elephants toothpaste but just in a higher concentration...
The main plot of other youtuber videos is just a subplot for Mark Rober
Engineering is like a baby. So when something you engineered does very well, you act like a happy parent the way Mark was happy.
Not all heroes wear capes mate! Thanks for what you do! Sometimes I watch channels similar to you like smarter every day and etc, I wonder if you know the reach you have to provide honest happiness! Cheers bloke! Brisbane Australia
Mark Rober the environmental impact of making this video seems a bit insane, don't you think?
2045: "Giving the ISS a new paintjob with my new elephant toothpaste volcano record!"  Really awesome video, mark!
It would seem humans are redeemable.
oh！！！my
Bro I heard lethamyrs intro from the song in the background during the orbeez does anyone know what’s it’s called
Mark Rober in 10 years : "Today, I asked the help of Elon Musk to make the world's first ever Elephant Toothpaste powered rocket and send it into orbit"
Investing in today is priceless because tomorrow isn't promised, trading Bitcoins,gold, silver and crypto secure a better tomorrow.
COOM
Like.
This is easily one of, if not the most wholesome videos Mark has ever made
Thank you Mark Rober for bringing so much light, laughter, and happiness into this world
Great video as usual! Definitely due props to the videographer and editor!!
mr beast is also borracho
mark rober is somehow obsessed with elephant toothpaste...
nc
200+ feet... That was so high :v
Mark rober is the nicest and coolest uncle, ever
Wouldn't the elephant toothpaste thing be bad for the environment?   Not trying to be offensive, just asking
the main guy looks like bugha to me????????
wow now he edits his videos after 10 years!
I wish I could be there, even tho I'm 1 out of billion fans
I wonder how big the next flask is gonna be when a new WR is set.
EXPOSED!!!!!
GREEN VOLCANO!
IT'S A NEW RECORD!!!!!!!!!!!!
HEY IT'S NURK THE DRONE PILOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Huge w for the cameramen

Mark is the coolest uncle i'll never have

Sweet
This dude got me crying, he is so nice. one of the greatest humans on earth. Keep doing wat you do!!
hi you're probably not going to answer this question but i wanna know, what would happen if everyone in the world jumped at once??? since in a science class video you talked about how the earth slightly moves when you jump or throw something
You can tell he used to work for nasa, that thing looks like a Gemini capsule
I want to see a Mark Rober - Slo Mo Guys Collab. You?
I was baffled by the camera-shots
Proud of you mark

Seems like ruining out of ideas
It would be amazing if Mark Rober started a school, he makes learning so much more fun!
The greatest series on youtube: pewdiepie Minecraft, MrBeast giving away money and seeing how mutch coloured foam we can make and how high it'll go

I cried through all this
Respect +
I think Mark has a thing for Elephant Toothpaste
Omg amazing 😻
Still all I could ever wish is being Marks nephew.
<3
I thought the formula was already common knowledge in a bunch of other youtube videos its just 50% H202 which is basically impossible to get for normal people.
draftkings sponsoring children-focused content seems like it's bordering on illegal
You know jimmy
Why can't I like this 1000 times? 😂😂😂
this looks like a movie omg
Bruh, madlad.
10:04, looks like lava
next time make elephants toothpaste fly from the bottom 😈

Mark you are a true hero. Beautiful vid. <3
Makes me wanna cry
Mark is the definition of go big or go home

Only the finest of bottled water.

Well… who‘s gonna clean that up?!
LITERALLY INSANE
👽👽👽👽
I just casually spoke to mr. beast

Mark Rober in 5 years: We made the World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano that went to the moon
Mark Rober 2050: Launching myself to mars using elephant toothpaste.
U know its a montage when you hear fadibher square
Well, I'm pretty sure I know what at least one of the ingredients are.. lol
Everything is so awesome in this video, I can bet it's going to hit 100M in a month.
POG CHAMP LETS GOOO!
ceci est ma chiasse
Mark is going to be the first one who makes a real Ironman suit
Why is this guy who can do endless things obsessed with elephant toothpaste Edit: its cool
Why did it sound like an elephant
This is amazing to watch
❤️❤️❤️
So much creativity and efforts to serve a beautiful purpose ! Amazing video !
So he's the reason my work can't get any steel
When is Technoblade getting his birthday party?
Off topic, Lethamyr Theme song legit

THIS IS Y I LOVE THIOS CHANNEL
He is the best person
Mark rober. the most genuine person on the planet.
We need more NASA's employee to retire 🤣
Can you try putting devils toothpaste in the flask
Forgive me when I say this, but Mark Rober is probably the BEST youtube channel in this world.
world dying , who cares,
You would be an amazing Father if you aren't one already.
Why 27 on trending what about 1 on trending
this is what happens when when u have a cousin or a part of the famili who is a retired scientist
Scientist found another volcano and it was amazing
Crazy video!
At 14:25 Mark Rober sounds like Chris from Family Guy
Thanks for being so awesome!! Great video.
Oooh brody. I remember him. Thats so nice he used his only wish
Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
Bro, when the mayor of a town comes to see your science experiment, you know you got somewhere in life.
U Did it! A new record!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Umm u said the 2020 shark week was your first and last time ever in a private jet now u are going on one again

What if bill gates donated 20 million dollars to team trees?
He is certified the worlds coolest uncle
Wow
Karmara Is Better Than Fournette
#2 on trending, ey? *Beautiful*
And what about the environment??
The video seems rather neutral to me. Just curious as to why there are 3k thumbs down.
Mark: I wont give the recipe for devils toothpaste because of safety  Also Mark 4 minutes later: Yea, its just some hydrogen peroxide and soap
best video ever
This Video Is So Legendary That Even My Future Grand Children Will Tell Their Future Grand Children About This Video In 100 years!
Well done mark. You have become death, the destroyer of worlds.
That is really nice :)
im not crying, you are
9:36 I see that drone
I love how mark just keeps on 1upping himself
i don't have words just wow
13:44 what is this analogy? So random
If people really wanna go all out with their gender reveals, they should just do this! Maybe not with the giant flask, of course, but it'd be pretty much completely harmless at least
fletcher makes a comeback! woo!
If mark does one of these every year eventually he'll be like "Yeah I made a 100 ton flask that shoots devil's toothpaste into the stratosphere, and there's 2,000 kids at the party now.
I wish i'm still a kid that i can play in that pool
*how to like a video more than once*
E l e p h a n t T o o t h p a s t e
truely epic
wow :0 this is so cool. but if u want to make it higher, u can make the top smaller as that will make more pressure :)
Did mark make a new form of devils toothpaste by accident that spontaneously combusts t think thats going to have to be called somethibg else
Goodjob m8
*Suddenly, these two boys became the most popular kids in their school*
It also sounds like elephant 🐘🐘🐘😅😅😅
You did a very cool thing. Nice job!
This was pure happines
Mark Rober: this video was exspensive  MrBeast: pathetic
Wholesomeness level 459
i was literally thinking abt the last video, like I wonder if he is gonna perfect it. And the madlad delivered
brody is a champ 🔥🔥
ACTUAL PRESSURE UNITS PLEASE?
imagine being the guy from last year
Do me a favor and give me isla's Snapchat
amazing
I hate these videos… I feel so bad for the kids
That is so amazing!!!!!
Anyone else get super happy when a mark rober video comes out. Like forget all my stress I'm feeling for the day. Your video's are always entertaining to watch
Normal youtubers would not have made a redo, they would think they would get bad views because it had been done already. But the last failed attempt have bother me so long, I'm so happy that Mark felt the same
Impressive... But isn't it better to build a tiny house for the kids instead?
Their house had to be stained😂😂
7:44 Foam Daddy kinda sus ngl
I looked more forward to this than my 18th birthday in November 29th
We love you Mark
It gives me so much joy to hear about the small towns around my small town get noticed by big creators, California is pretty known for San Francisco and Los Angeles so seeing the smaller towns get recognized fills me with Cali pride
Amazing video, again!!
When life gives you Lemons           😀     😀       😀            😀
best uncle awards goes to:  *MARK ROBER HIMSELF*
How to flex
So that is what he does over the year and not uploading vids 🤔 🤔 😂 😂
12:46 for the action
Thanks dude. I haven't been feeling too hot and it's nice to see people looking out for each other. It touches something that few things seem to these days.
How is this legal 🤣
It almost gets me crying seeing what basically a child can and is willing to do for other child's that are so pure
I just want to know why 3 thousand idiots voted this down.
Absolutely AWESOME
That kid has gotten an amazing core memory
Epic
Bro you jus so awesome
Mark Rober is like the most perfectly sculpted curious in the world.
Awesome video!
What a POG.
Mark really ain't messin with the world record
Marks neighbors either hate them or finds him so cool
There ya go! See, steel was far better in this case than trying with the super light wood build. Well done!
You are incredible!
Mark:"Generous benefactor"  me: *Mr. Beast*
This kid gunna get ALL the girls now... he has to remember to pick the ones who want him not because he was on mark robers channel, but because they actually like him!
Gotta give respect to the person who was flying the drone
Mark it’s not a record if only u know how to make the devils toothpaste
Its my birtday today aswell
4:41 look at that beast
This was heartwarming and fun to watch....
I love this! It's so awesome and amazing!  So when am I going to see him do the same with some children of color?
The difficult avenue likely scatter because lake developmentally strap opposite a public barge. offbeat, mature encyclopedia
favourite part of internet!
Mark Rober is Elon Musk 2.0
I wish I was there with you guys
Purple food color: *My goals are beyond your under*
They all got the jab

When a Mark Rober video comes out: Everyone: YEEEESSSSSS
At 9:59 it looks like lava
This party looks like the perfect place for some white kids to make a bad rap video.
Let’s get him to 20 mil cmn
The beat that lethamyer uses for his introo🧐🧐
Huge credits to the editors.🙌🙌

You are so  kind just helping others in need and i love your videos so much. Also brody is very deserving of this and wish all the best for him
Ngl the people in that village make it sound like it’s a minecraft village, like XD
Every time you make stuff like this, it renews my faith in humanity. Hats off to you!
Why is the foam thing called foam daddy
he is just wasting money on bullshit things the money he spend in this video can help someone needy and change many lifes
I need to see a giant sized devils toothpaste
What is that
Best uncle award goes to..
Nice.

Sometimes i forget he does all this in survival mode and not creative. Like how do you get out of the flask. BTW love from UK. (*-*)
These videos make me want to have a terrible illness
Didnt u do this with mr.beast??
Real fantasy football ⚽️
I want this guy to be my science teacher
So awesome. Definitely subbing

Elephant tooth decay just rose big time.
He is the cool uncle everyone wants
Oh, cool. thanks mark!
Disappointed you took a sponsorship from draft kings
This is amazing wow ✨
MARK HAS LIKE LIKE THE IDEAL AMERICAN FAMILY
I love how the drone is struggling to catch up to the top.
When live gives you lemons, you just eat them
That was visible from space
Spoiled brats damaging the environment for fun, nothing new.
Child labor..  CHILD LABOR!?
RARK MOBER IS BESt yZuboTUBERS
This is the sweetest video I've seen in some time ❤️
sheesh
The most wholesome science in all of youtube 😭😍👏👏👏
That was amazing
how does Guinness world records measure the height? like do they use a ridiculously long ruler
To all the 3,000 people that put a thumbs down on the video: please leave earth we don’t need your negativity lol
10:07 Best screenshot of the year
is it ethnol
Magnificent
make a tornado
sheeeeesh the drone shots
I thought he went all out in the last one but This one definitely something else
Yay
UPLOAAAAAD
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FLETCHER UR BACKXZ
Mark makes one weak thing make it 100 times better
Hello Mark, I've got an idea that could be cost efficient and overall insane although it may require some help from someone a bit more experienced in flight than me (Edit: I wrote a comment on this comment if your curious)
Lethamyr’s involvement?
I literally just watched the first video and was like 'yo mark should make another video about this' lol
Mark Rober never fails me with his videos :)
What is that track playing @2:34
today is my birth day
Finally a Mark Rober Video!
wow what a video :)
These have to be some of the best drone shots I’ve ever seen!
Mark this was insane ♥️♥️♥️. You had mr chopping onions
That was absolutely epic.
I think you was do it with your freands 9 or 6 days but ik party look cool XD
🍻🤯🥲
Mark was so happy at the endd ❤️🥺
9:59 me after taco bell
Why ??
Absolute king
The drone guy needs a raise
Completely overkill ALL OF IT.
I love how much work everyone put for this birthday. Mr Beast wishing him as well is just the icing on top!!!
while others doing video abt orbeez, building pool, devil toothpaste, separately, he combined them all in one video. satisfaction multiplied 😌
Next year some kids will ask for their very own Mark Rober Surprise Party as part of their own wish.
Mark rober is amazing, if he was my uncle I would be so lucky
How was that a year ago?!?! Weird
This is so wholesome, love it when people come together like this!
science is awesome
Dame
What you really came for: 12:46
10:00 that’s just halo 3 flood
Dont worry "NO" cameras were wet in making of this video
This is a banger vid MARK
I LOVE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC
This guy is the most wholesome person on YouTube
So, the flack of Elephant Toothpaste didn't take off like a rocket... but what if you made a rocket powered by Elephant Toothpaste?
How long did it take to clean all the elephant tooth paste?
i watched this when it said slime not elephant toothpaste
YESSSSSSSS
Honestly i dont care what anybody else says but dude you are one of the beat people in the world you help so many people out with real life situations and just making videos and i love that
Devils toothpaste I get the feeling it has something to do with nitric acid  cuz your gloves caught on fire (nitric acid catiliss?????
The most enjoyable 17 minutes of my life.
When you help someone I don't want anything in return I want them to be happy
👐👏
I wonder what would happen if you reversed this and attempted to send the flask as high as possible?
"50 times the pressure of a footballs inside" you Americans and your weird measuring system
The world record holder🌋🎉🎉
aw $h!t, here we go again.
Camera angles are ON POINT. Well done Mark
I just wanna know how lengthy was the clean up
Stop finding ways to make me emotional
Great vid bro
It would be awesome if you took 500(or maybe more you always take things in millions 😉) Preasurepumps and made them spray at the same time it would be awesome(more like a world record? 🙄)
How could anyone vote that they don't like this video?  Human beings are best when they are doing something for someone else without the expectation of getting something back.   This is an example of empathy, compassion, and loving thy neighbor.  If you can't understand that, then you should be pitied.
Thank you for making the world a better place. Life has been... challenging this year. So thank you for giving hope to the rest of us :)
why isnt mark rober my uncle
This made me smile
...
I'd be interested to see some clean up footage.
Mark is only the guy who earns my respect
Me:Ohhh so thats what that green stuff in the distance was XD
What's the update on phase 1 of getting revenge on scammers videos?
I wish I was there you guys had a lot of fun
you are soo kind to that kid :)
Jonathon
next year: party for tecnoblade with elephant toothpast that touches the moon
All I could hear was AfroMan during a montage
You made me cry.
Wish I coulda been there :)
Tf
Now mark needs to beat dream
The selfless act of pure kindness!
Anyone else notice lethamyr's intro song?
Hi Mr beast why are you so sweaty is it cuz of the 500,000 dollar challenge the 12/13 day challenge?
I think we have the new best video on the channel 🔥😎
Another Masterpiece film by mark rober!! WOOW!
happy  fathers day!!
nice.
I would love to attend this party
Is that girl of age?
Tesla's suck
This video is awesome, don't mind me just commenting to increase interaction so more people see this video :)
I think we found out who mad the screens at Best Buy (THE BEST DRONE SHOTS EVER)
This is so cool!
Polluting for a few YouTube views and a useless piece of paper.
I loved this video so much. Im a make a wish kid also,and i wish i could've gave it to someone else who really needed it. Because im fine with what i have and greatful for what i have. And sometimes i take advantage of it. So @Mark Rober I truly thank you for letting those people have the best day of their life.
the new way he uses those drone shots
Ok
Epik
this guy is the uncle we all dreamed of
This is awesome
Who has the time to do this, lol
It's just a redemption video.
Your making childhoods more better
Well, this is the elephant in the room
could you change background song?  That one has this random french(?) word in the background that sounds like a audio watermark to me and it is so distracting!
Mark you make the world a better place, thank you for sharing positivity with the public in hard times
Incredible video bro incredible
🤜🤛
Honestly I would just swim in the elephant toothpaste
yo can we get fletcher's sister's @ ⁉️⁉️⁉️

How do you dispose of the elephants toothpaste
Am i the only one ho is sad for the manekin
I would love to play Holi with this Guy XD
Can't we use this as a Rocket Fuel as it will be lighter to my knowledge but will be nasty😉
Can we talk about what a Sigma Chad Brody is?
isnt that devils toothpaste awfully flammable to be next to a house like that?
He’s a kid that don’t show a lot of emotions i see…happy for him tho
The world's best drones are being used here
that was pretty cool
WELL DONE 👏
Cinematography was next level
Just knowing Mark Rober is one of the coolest things ever
Everybody: wants Hollywood quality filming. Mark roboer: 'what is Hollywood?'
The most entertaining nerd.

laughs in pandemic
It's funny my mom is actually from Gridley too.

The best science YouTuber in the world

I would have traded anything to grow up privileged like this 😭
Hahaha very funny Nark
.
How much did Guinness pay you to use them
Wow
I have to ask, how you get your hands on so much hydrogen peroxide of that concentration?
If the drone was in the middle when it falls
Mark is gonna get the penthouse in heaven
thats tall
Well done ✅✅✅ Mark
Devils Toothpaste AKA self-igniting napalm.

Mark casually being best friends with every celebrity

I love every part of this video. From so many lovely helping people and the sheer joy it brings down to the fact that they even had a lifeguard at the pool party.
Love how you do the as at the end! So worth it and stick thru it just because
Love your videos so inspiring

MARK IS A LEGEND
Everything about this, with the town helping out with everything and all kinds of things, the reason for the entire project and the building process. Ah... So wonderful
gun
He's done it again...
why does this dude host the most lit parties ever
Mrbeast ????????
It's even funnier the second time
Not bad #2 on trending
Mark Rober: Makes video Nature: 🥲
imagine how much money and effort went into this...!! Hats off
my biggest flex is probably liking this video and turning on notifications
i literly clear my whole calender so i know i can whatch it with out eney stops
Every time Mark releases a video I have an ear to ear grin and a warm feeling in my heart.
Mark Rober is the greatest uncle you could evet get 🔥🔥🔥no cap ~♥ ITS FUN AS HECK
These videos where you make a kid’s dream come true are next level awesome keep it up
What did you do with all the foam? How did you dispose it?
I knew it, he hasn't given up on this cause the last one wasn't satisfying lmao
Omg how nice is that pleas big respect
When I was watching the video I had an idea, why don’t you make a tsunami made of orbes.
I didn't think you could make me love you and your channel more but you did it. I'm so full of happy glee that I can't even put it into words. Also major major major plus with that love for Kamara!
I love your videos!!! Such dedication! I envy that party now! Also love your style: "And this time, I was taking no chances and so for the base we layed a *CONCRETE PAD WITH WILL BE ATTACHED TO THE FLASK WITH 33 QUARTER INCH BOLTS* (said absolutly casualy like it's everyday thing)" <3   PS: It can still be higher! I just now saw few spots on flask that leaked cause of insane pressure inside. So there is still room for improvement Mark, go for it!  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
All the people in this vid is so beautiful. To pay something forward and back; to do things just to see the smiles of those children, are reasons why I could see hope for humanity. Cheers to everyone and Mark Rober!
Yes!!!! Another vid thx mark
Yes!!!! Another vid thx mark
This was great Haha💖💝 Miss his vids 🥺
💪💪💪💪
Ah i just want jump in
13:59 you can literally see the world lag due to all the particles lmao
I was not expecting Mark Rober of all people to be sponsored by draft kings
You really know how to make a kids dream come true. Very well done!!
CRYING 1 MIN into the video hearing him using his make a wish on another kid wow
You're amazing ❤
What drones do you use for your videos mark? They look awesome
i realise that when mark is doing science stuff hes always smiling and sometimes act like a child especially when the stuffs work properly and thats what i love most about him
epic
Why you gotta make me cry Mark?
I love your videos mark
Anyone who watches Lethamyr his intro appears in this 0.0
"The pressure was 50 times the pressure u would feel pushing agains a fully inflated football" so how many bar is that in non-American units? 😂
*The world’s first toothpaste volcano.*
This was honestly way over the top
Yonk
Well done! Was waiting for this video!!
Best people on Earth - Mark rober and Mr. Beast ❤️❤️ ... Hats off
Hi
What quality over quantity channel looks like
As soon as December 1st comes. (Like if you know what I mean)
I remember doing a presentation about elephant toothpaste and i mentioned Mark Rober
Why did you seriously not consider the massive environmental contamination that would occur with you haphazardly dumping that much iodide there.
I wonder how many videos it would take to just clean all that mess.
The b-roll and editing for this video is absolutely top notch as well.
Keep going brother 👍👍
Are Orbeez biodegradable?
11:22 song no cry - fashion
11:53 kids foot

I wish you were my uncle
Hey king you drop this 👑
I am expecting mrbeast's comment

You are truly legendary

Showing that this platform is yours and everyone else just follows your lead
i think he's just experimenting the children.
Do you another squirrel maze
Mr beast uses an iPhone 11 but gives away iPhone 12
This entire video was so amazing I really forgot why I even clicked or what the title was until it cut to the toothpaste troughs. You are truly an inspiration and one of the best humans ive ever seen. Thank you!
Nice job mark! Keep it up!
Congrats Mark🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
in the fanale the drone was kinda making a YEAHHHH sound
Bro these camera shots are INSANE
you really are an inspiration to us all.

Loved the video! Great message
*me and the bois going to make A PARTY FOR A C H I L D*
the real question is, how environment friendly doing this is?
Thus guy I'd better than Mr beast
The last giant toothpaste volcano really made me want to see no leak at the bottom and it's like a wish comes true to witness this video. Yai!
how do you make this look so easy to do lol
Well done on the water mark at 13:02 also why are people verified getting more like I say we start a revolution on that

That kid is amazing.
Dude. Your so intelligent.  Could you do somthing that helps the environment?
The burning glove gave away the recipe for the devils tooth past mixture. Still a nope. I know the ingredient and how reactive it is. I value my skin...
EPIC! and amazing; every single part of this ❤️
Holy
i don't like that inertia from tesla's
okay i need to know...         who tf cleaned all of this up lmao
This guy's way too much over the top on uncle points
Sending nuke be like
...world's tallest...quite the claim...
Great vid and cause but I miss the videos with physics explanations by some random guy on YouTube about how a boyscout car works.
Imagine this with devils toothpaste..
He’s BACK
Mark's video are the videos I wanted to watch for so long time like everything is amazing!
Mark you are abusing your 20000$ drone *and we LOVE IT*
If we ever meet extraterrestial life and need an embassador to represent us humans, i vote for mark rober. He represents the best in us.

We watched this video in the mist of a mad world, and for a few minutes, everything was ok. Thanks Mark 👍🏻❤️
Mesterbest
Beast comment here ASAP.
This is just full of wholesomeness. From Brady using his wish for another kid, to the whole party and everyone who helped make it the best day for him <3
Mark Robber just committed slavery getting the people of griddle California to work on this surprise party, even stating at the end that they weren't expecting anything in return.
The transparent things made it look 10x cooler
9:35  Everyone : WOOOOOOOAAHHHHH the drone : weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssshhhhhhh
Lol ik the fire one will not say it in respect for people's safter you can find it tho
see, mark couldve made this video 5 minutes long with just the mega flask and get the same views, but instead he set up a whole fun day for a bunch of kids and made a lot of people really happy.  i freaking love how compassionate he is. he always does his projects for others and not just himself. keep being you mark
Always the epitome of wholesome content. Loved this.
A-Men!
Wow Cool:D
*If the world goes into apocalypse mode I'm getting in one of these*
9:32 12:52 I Swear These Videos Are Getting Better And Better
"I even harnessed some child labor"
Money and fame have gone to your head Mark, how selfish of you to spend your money trying to make the world a better place. Only joking mate, I love you and everything you do. Don't ever change
First I watched Mark's videos to learn about science, physics and engineering. Now I watch them to learn how to be a better person.
Dude, NASA has launched rockets to space, but this was more out of this world than any distant satellite.  I'm graduating this December with my engineering degree, and I just wish my school had your type of engineering: Happiness Engineering, designing products and services selflessly for the betterment of others.
Yessss
One word: AWESOME!!!
Why is the foam launcher named FOAM DADDY 😳🤣🤣
Yessir
okay.. Im here!!hahahah
😊
Kinda reminds me of those sand pillars from mario when they push you upwards
I'm not crying you're crying.
Oh hi Mark
I thought I had the best parties when we would rent an entire movie theater I felt so powerful now I fell so weak
"I even harnessed some child labor to..."  All Frostpunk players cried out in joy
This is an amazing video. Mark you inspire so many people across the world and the things you and your amazing friends put together are just out of this world! I hope this video get to tbe the most liked on youtube.
this feels like it is from a movie shot
BRO HOW THAT'S LIKE 20 TO 1000 FEET UP
That was AWESOME!!!!   You do such great things for kids.
Dope
Somewhere the aliens are panicking
You just challenged all of the internet to get the devils toothpaste formula. Challenge accepted
That was just cool on all levels.
Ze
What if... The devil tooth paste was done in mid air?
Ayee you used ProleteR music, let’s hope you don’t get the mumbo jumbo treatment
Yo
Ahh Nurk on the sticks,  I was wondering who was Flying, that looked fun to fly.   Need more punch next time...  12s...
Ew Mr beast
Noce budy
Wow
annoyingly wholesome, gg
my faith in humanity has been lifted
Can we just appreciate the amazing job of editing?
I can’t help but apreciate how much you do for other people not only one person but so many other adults and kids and if love what you do and bring fun to hundred or so poeple
wow ... that's mighty impressive,  now to narrow the nozzle until....   you do great stuff, fun to see thank you
im proud of you brody
sooooooooooo cooooooooooooooooooooool omg!!
Lethamyr Intro whaaaaa
Moral of the story: mix random reactive chemicals and something cool could happen
12:45
I love watching mark rober this specific 1 is epic
literally everyone is white in this video
Cool
When Mark Robber gives you elephant toothpaste you blast it into space.
lol
Godly.
Mark Rober is the king of content. Prove me wrong.
I think Mark picked a wrong career. He is an excellent party organizer.
Love this! Awesomeness x infinity
Best youtuber of all time, hands down
Can we have a moment to realize that for some reason, almost 3k people dislicked this video!!!!!! like bruh, why, he's so wholesome
Hey Mark can u make a fantasy team predictor
Using a private jet and a limo instead of a Tesla to save an hour an 40 minutes may be a cool experience, but it’s a terrible choice for the environment
Im imagining like a random bird trying to find some food getting like vaporized lol
Imagine if a drone got hit by the elephant toothpaste by trying to get a CLEAN view of it
You should help Mr beast
You have enough money to buy that flask... but not enough to change your background music?
Watching this video filled me with so much joy!
I wonder how much thrust the flask made.
gotta love the 20 second montages
I feel like I just watched this video last year.
Ayo who heard Leth’s intro?
12:53 When Volcanic Eruption Will Be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
oo
7:30 I could comment about how mark is a genius but.... Instead I'll say I dont understand these people. As someone who can barely swim I'm deathly afraid of going underwater. That's all. Also, I've noticed he doesnt say he has a quest to be the favourite uncle anymore... could he have finally achieved his dream..?
imagine the pressure inside of that flask...
Technoblade next year??? Hmmm???
I feel sorry for the mannequins.
Mark Rober, the gold roger of Youtube.(bc of the devils toothpaste......)
You rode a ******* private jet! So much for climate change.
You should put a de' lavalle Nozzle on the elephant toothpaste cannon.
YEAAAHHHHGHH
You should make an extension to the top to be able to launch things with the extreme pressure
🐐 is back
Mark Rober for President!
Nice
wow a cessna citation private jett! CRAZY
I dont know how he cleans up the mess
Idk if I only speak for myself or what, but I'm kinda tired of "elephant toothpaste".  I 99% love the content you provide but this is like seeing the same science fair project over and over again.  You've shown and explained it before multiple times. It was great the first, pretty entertaining the next, but now It's like watching "who has the best baking soda volcano?"  All love but when you drop a vid a month it's kind of disappointing when it's something we've already seen. Again, I'm not trying to hate. But I know you are way too smart to  limit your ideas to the YouTube algorithm. Your fan base is loyal and love's to learn new things with each upload.
Wow red and green now festive very much
how do you clean all these stuff? well?
I came as soon as I saw
the military should use this
12:36 Me everytime I saw a CCTV Camera
“No more!.... all the people I’ve murdered, by letting you live”
“You don’t get it son this isn’t a mud hole... Its an operating table, and I’m the surgeon”
🎚🌍💻📡🇨🇭
This is heartwarming
12:53 Save your time
That lethamyre intro music sounded familiar
Thats pog champ!
Where is that OG music mark
Popular opinion : U wish Mark Rober was ur uncle
Awesome job dude!
Uhhhhhhhhhh how are you gonna clean this mess
Mark Rober - Officially the world's greatest party planner and craziest uncle.
:)
i cant beileve that all of this is possible dam
That looks fun

13:42 Americans will use anything but the metric system
Thanks to you for making this happen. i still remember when I watched the last time you did it for fletcher, never thought I'd see this after 1 year, coming back with all of the best!
Make an elephant toothpaste rocket.
I am going to have to watch this one again -- tear of joy and empathy have distorted the watching - I love thateveryone pulls together to get all this sorted out and wouldn't the world be a better placeif we all followed this example
you should invite the slowmo guy for this video
13:48 This is America
Yeee
Shirtless Mark is the best.
Very cool video!
Mark, you are seriously a decent dude.   I wish more people could be like you.
Rip cams

#whenyouliveinaustraliaandwanttomeethimsobadbutyourparentsarebusytryingtosellthebuisnesseventhoughthere’snobackupplanandwe’llprobablybecomehomelesssoyourdadgetsasecondjob I wonder who can read this
7:28 I always thought this said  Oi oi uunnaaaaaaa Oi oi unaaa
This is officially a yearly event.
10:21 such an awesome shot !
I'll tell my kids "I've learnt a lot from this science guy. You should learn it too" 😉
Imagine having 3.7 million views in 13 hours that’s crazy
you are THE role model for all of humanity!!! Thank you!!!!
That was amazing
Time to force all the stuff that came out of top to come out of bottom and send a flask to space
freaken GOAT!!!
Wait what kind of foot ball American or English
I just hope he doesn’t get cancelled for anything, i like his content so much and in this times it seems that everyone is getting cancelled 😞
My faith in humanity has been restored
Next experiment. Make it glow in the dark.
When is the next squirrel obstacle course video?
Why doesn’t he do one for his son
12:59. Yo mama last night
I’m glad the kid got party he deserves also who ever stole the kids ATV is a monster

That tower IS impressive.. but there's no doubt the cone could be much high. It's just a matter of magnitude. Congrats with the record!
Ur awesome !
The other kid lost his world record tho
Mark Rober's channel is now Mark Rober Industries
rober you are rock
SO ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MARK!!! You are such a great person!
the kid in the last video: "ah yes, you effectively made my world record worthless"
In the part 8:12 it lookes like a music video

First! :D
Praise the lord
Nothing better to do?
Pog
How do you clean this?
Elephant toothpaste rocket when?
Mark Robert deserves more attention in my opinion!
Mark appreciation comment....
That's a very creative way of saying 675 psi...
I see a missed opportunity here, they should've called it the Rober's flask.
AYYY
What could we do without you
i have birthday tmr so cant u just u know make me a party?
Mark rober can actually make a devils toothpaste rocket by now…
DUDE THIS IS SO AMAZING!!!
" *When_you_try_to_be_a_good_person_it_may_not* *always_come_back_to_you_immediately_but* *somehow_it_always* *_comes_back_* "                                                                           -True
Beautiful
I love every single that's on your channel!!!!! omg!!!! love this video sooooo much
Commenting to give this vid publicity
Aye talk about rocket science
Thank you Mark for being such an AMAZING human being, I am 46 Y/O and I was crying like a baby watching this video ❤️ Thanks for you amazing contribution for the world 🌎 🙏🏼❤️
It looks like the thing they put hulk in but not red
Surely we get an elephants toothpaste rocked
that was impressive :D
somebody's cutting onions
Just waiting for this to go on trending ;)
So your job is to make kids happy. I admire you.
Dame those drone shot was soooo cool🔥🔥
Totally awesome! You’re amazing as well as those kids!
12:41
This editor did a fantastic job
I fell like how mark get his kindness back is having cool stuff and getting invited to epic birthdays that he created
P.S The generous benefactor was MrBeast.
Mark Rober definitely knows how to party
Refuses to give his devils paste formula out....l guess I’ll just go mix chemicals together till I figure it out myself, unless it’s just out on the Internet. Edit: Don’t mix chemicals together unless you know what you are doing, and if, like me, you don’t really know, but don’t care and will do it anyways, well, whoever dies first loses.
Elephant toothpaste record without Nick Uhas? Maybe next year.
When u meet her after a month
Does mark reply to his depressed fans?😎
I Slo-mo shots are amazing.
I feel like MrBeast and Mark Rober are one of the few youtubers that are so famous but so kind at the same time, they deserved to be famous.
Fu**in A team ✌✌✌✌
Hello
This record is nearly impossible to beat....
He should receive the award for World's Best Uncle.
Mark Rober, you are planet earth’s best human.
That elephant toothpaste is super awesome stuff🤗
Your drone pilot is awesome.
Can u be my uncle? 🥺                                       👉👈
That green elephants toothpaste went too high
*C  H  I  L  D    L  A  B  O  U  R*
Well Done M A R K  R O B E R 🙌🏽👑🙌🏽
When you said "Over engineered", THIS is insane
I love you
Rober is so awkward
Bet mark is real glad his big flask was with green dye and not purple!
Is jimmy that generous benefactor?. Private plane and limbo?
The straight wednesday postsurgically instruct because rabbi syntactically prevent off a boiling fifth. romantic, ritzy produce
Great Vid!
power of child labor
I was sad that mark didn’t post (it was 12 at night) and then I saw this one,and I literally screamed 😂
Well... If anyone could have done it... It would have been you
Now fletcher party will feel like nothing
11:09 @Lethamyr intro music
satisfaction
13:11 Me on December 1st
Please never stop making these videos/content! I absolutely love them. I get all sorts of giddy whenever I see a notification of a new video, they always make me smile. ☺️
Huge respect mark!
this is the most wholesome video I’ve seen in a really long time
I sure enjoy watching your videos.
That shots are amazing,  I would ise them as desktop pictures
Is there anything to not like about you mark???
Thoughts on the environmental impact of this party?
Am I the only one feeling jealous here??
Wow
Make a bowling ball that hits 7 - 10 splits
Noiceeeeeeeeee
So much verified watched this
imagine having mark rober as your science teacher
I was smiling thru the whole video . ......   The only one where i stopped smiling is when the video ended... Hope you get to make more videos every year
Everyone wants an uncle like mark
I love these videos because they’re so cool and fun but I hate these videos because i know I’ll never do anything as cool or fun as this
Imaging doubling it
.
This is by far one of the best videos I’ve ever seen. Truly so heartwarming ❤️
Rip House
1 uncale point 100000 star anger points
For some reason that really reminds me of a Plinian eruption lol
20m soon
Just askin what is all these chemicals impact for environment? STILL THE BEST PARTY 🎉
It Can only be better by turning the flask upside down
Need more positive people like Mark in this world
Well now I'm crying. This is so amazing for those kids!
You are literally the best! It's amazing what you do for these kids 🥰
Is it just me or does the devils toothpaste look like scrambled eggs?
+
Props to all the alpha male dads pulling this together in community spirit.
You could hear his voice change in end of video after screaming that much, totally understandable it was amazing
Purple you say. Interesting🤔
Dude your so talented. Appreciate the quality videos you bring to us. Much love from Australia 🇦🇺
hi
Gpi
bacteria watching chilli curry exiting the body: 12:49
Omg the lethamyer song…
What's the song in the background at 5:30?  You can hear it better at 6:00
Wait . So Brady's atv is stolen ?  Or he gave it away to someone else??
Nice Rober Proud of u😀
POV: your finding a YouTube video when your eating and you see this
Plot Twist: This actually WAS a volcano in disguise
12:44 ... what's with the subliminal voice... 'Enchantée' ??  ('delighted, nice to meet you')
I love your ledos
No helmet Brody. Madlad
I am really curious to see what happens inside that elephant tooth paste after it blows up , maybe super SLO mo guys can do that . That would be really interesting
11:10 @Lethamyr intro music 😏
I know Mr. beast I saw the video where you went to his house or not his house but his friend
Big win and fail, it all went out the top, but it went confetti
i feel so bad for that house
4:19 that scream though.
12:58 hulk got finished with she-hulk
You should do this sometime!
So I found out how to make something like devils toothpaste elephant toothpaste + (something I can’t say for safety reasons) = what I call angrypaste
Reverse flask??????
This was crazy nice of you also congrats on 20mil
mark boboer
You're a total sciencebro, throwing great parties for these kids. And Brody sounds like a swell dude, cashing in his wish to get the other dude another ATV.
I love the cinywhoop shots grate job
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying!! This has restored a decent amount of faith in humanity.  Everyone involved in this has done such a great thing.
Mark! You're making the world a better place! The world wouldn't be the same without you. Thank you for all you do!
better than fireworks
You should try and make a  little or medium sized rocket with  Elephant toothpaste and see how far that goes up
You should of just buried it
LAZARBEAM's cousin Brody        (JK)
I hate kids who wear bass pro hats
I'm so glad I found this amazing person
“Guys I forgot to record…”
The editing on this video is amazing.
Mark Rober, is in my opinion the most humble and loving person on YouTube. And dose things for the benefits of others a true inspiration kids should look up to
I feel like Mark loves kids.
imagine being in a hotel and you see a whole 5 tons of elephant toothpaste go to the sky
Next video: making devil's toothpaste alive
I hope those child don’t becomes nerd and bully after this
I respect how much you’ve dedicated purely to elephant’s/devil’s toothpaste
oh my gosh i have no words for how amazing and heartwarming this video was
The way the devil’s paste came out looks similar to the burst of oil coming out of the drills
Sports betting? Really?
Love
i have an idea do the same thing but make the flask lighter and no hole on the top so it will fly like a rocket
Huh
Woah
Imma need fletchers sisters ig 👀
These video restore my waiting faith in us. Really shows what we can do when we work together rather then remain apart. And that kindness is never weakness.
13:40 turns out Americans really will measure with everything but the metric system :')
Woah the camera shots it just makes your jaw just drop it was so sudden
Amazing like always
Elephant toothpaste go brrrrr
Mark gives me Andy Samberg vibes
I live in Gridley, I didn't know Mark was doing this but I SAW THAT FROM MY HOUSE. I DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WAS until now!!!
Who else noticed lethymrs intro song
Is it just me or was the montage song a banjo version of colt 45
Was that Bill Gates at 8:11?????
The only 20 minute long videos i can be entertained by is mrbeast and markrober
I feel bad for them who needs to always clean up the big projects. Great job Mark!
4:28 :0
Lets get him to 20 mill for his kindness
Mark gives off cool uncle vibes and I'm here for it
Mark is not only a genius, but he is also a great father, a favourite uncle to many, a great Youtube creator and an amazing person in every aspect!
Please don't stop.
It is worth it to wait a month for a banger like this.
amazing work
My summary for this vid  WOW
I thought you said fizzing out the top was also a failure because streamlined gets shot higher?
need to build something really big? just do a montage and it'll be done in no time
the slomo shots tho-
ok but why does no one remember the sand hot tub? i wanna see it in the size of a pool
This video is so wholesome 🥰
Will someone please give Mark Rober a Mr. Wizard's World reboot of some sort?????
This guy is nice and cool. Great party mark love your content!
Lethamyr’s intro song
The filming and editing alone is impressive!   Thanks to Mark for having a loving heart!
If I was Fletcher I’ll be kind of jealous
Make a 3.0 squirrel maze
A coating of devil's toothpaste won't lower the value of that house or anything will it? lol
Nice video
Glad I started watching this video while I was in the kitchen repping dinner because otherwise I might have been accused of crying  at all of the kindness in this video. It’s definitely just the onions…
Mark started out trying to recreate a harmless experiment and accidentally created a new chemical weapon.
image being there
Me like yo science
×_×
"the force in the flask is about 50 times the force you feel when pushing a fully inflated football"  Uh, thanks Mark, it doesn't get any more 'Murican than that.
Can we all admit we want mark to throw us this bday?
Ok my friend. This young mans make a wish request for another child arc has me misty eyed. As always, a great video. Thank you sir.
First time I watched a video within 24 hours of its release, and I am glad it was this one
you are brilliant in every sense of the word
8:21
That is INSANE
Create a ripple & ride the wave 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
IMO Mark is the best uncle ever. any sane person with any sense of humor or fun would want to meet you. Keep up the great work
I learn more here than is school
mark rober make a BIGGER flask
Crazy I used to live in gridly Cali
Manual do Mundo lost
i’m not crying, you are!
a fully inflated football. what do you mean by this? an american football or a european football, what brand, and what size. what a terrible comparison !
If their was one more thing I want from this.. it would be bill nye
Mark Rober=Scientific Mr.Beast Great Vid
Drone go brrrrrrr 13:02
Wow i just heard an elephant trunk go off when the devils thootpaste got launched
Worth waking up for
What's he do with all the Orbeez after...?
Nois
wow
Not sure which is more impressive, Mark's brain or his heart.
🔥🔥5 tons🔥🔥
Me looking at foam daddy: 👁👄👁
We're back babyy!!
I bet that by 2030 he will have built a rocket and launched it to orbit
Such wholesome content. Mark is such a genuine guy. Keep up the great work.
So amazing! Congrats!
Mark Rober knows how to party
Beautiful. GG Mark, you are really a genius.
I wish there were a bunch of people like mark R. All over the world... Each country deserves atleast one or two guys like him.
I swear Mark has the best camera ever.
1345
Mark: Tesla or privet jet Everyone: the choice is simple
Bravo sir, bravo 🙂
I know that mrbeast is just joking but imagine copying a project that you didn't/never researched and wanting a higher grade too with it from the one you copied from lol
I need to become a youtuber so I can build projects in 30 seconds. It would save me a lot of time.
Egg
Mark, your videos make my heart glad. Thanks for being such an awesome person!
So my question bid can you get your hand on lithium iodide for your catalyst?
I love this education of this channel but where the F is the helmet?
Seventeen minutes and eight seconds of pure wholesomeness, the feelings of love and happiness these videos evoke really warm my heart. ❤️
EPIC
I really really wish I could be like doing that. With you…
WHOOOO HOOOOOOO!!!!
Imagine mark builds a toothpaste powered rocket.
I'm a bit disappointed he used a private jet, that's an insane amount of pollution for just a few people
FINALLY MARK
My Siblings: fighting   Me: mark rober just posted   Us: mooooom where’s the popcorn
what no one thinks about is cleaning this up
The ozone 💀💀💀💀
wow... moneey
11:17 I love the Leth music
Could nasa use this tech as rocket propulsion in space? Seems like there's quite a bit of force
I love how he used one of the rocket league tracks for his montages cause it's perfect for that
12:38 Hello!
In the orbeez montage, that is definitely the song that sunless khan uses
Oooo another tradition. Throwing surprise birthday parties for children recovering from illness. Very honorable.
lets all just thank all the people that helped build it and didnt expect any payment
but what if the head is on water dies one know why he cares he need care what if balls drown is the head exposed to earth
This is insane, congrats on the record and I wish more people spread kindness like you do
RIP all mannequins harmed in this video, they gave their lives for our entertainment. Mad respect.
is it just me or does the kid look like that kid from stranger things 5:00
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That was f****** amazing love it
That’s was prob the best day of his life
i was here.
I remembered the scene from jackass 3D with the 🌋volcano xD
What happened to the scammer series?
Well done
The background music is so iconic
Wow, just wow, I mean wow, like wow, gotta admit this is one of your best.
You've got the best channel on YouTube here.
Every other country: uses psi or bar  Americans: 50 times the pressure of a football
Figured out the devils tooth paste recipe
Leth made the video!! 11:29
Just freaking AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ♥♥♥
You never cease to amaze. You make science so entertaining to watch, and it's hecking wholesome too. :D
Fournette ain’t gonna be better than kamara not even close, won’t even be the most productive back on his team.
*Mark Rober 2022: I'm quitting YouTube to become an Events and party organizer! (And side hustle as toothpaste marketer!*
Imagine if people used these in airsoft to make a nuke
amazing

I am sòòooooooooooooo jealous
Lethamyr intro on the orbees part
This is so much fun.
"You wish that was you huh?"
3 minutes in and more work has been done here than in my entire life
Here before #1 on trending
me imagining what happens to the orbeez  after the party ;-;
Shoutout to the cameraman on creative mode who caught the devil's toothpaste and the elephant toothpaste scene.
Never forget what people can achieve when they come together for a common cause.
My only complaint about this is that I'm not there.
this the content we need!!!
I love swimming 🏊‍♂️ ♥
Truly amazing and in the American Spirit!
To be fast enough to get the wall done in time, that's when a stroke of genious came from the incursion. For the first time ever in 2B2T history, slave labor

“So how was your birthday?”  “It was ok I just *MET MARK ROBER* “
flip the giant flask upside down, instant rocket (that would go all of 25 ft)
Elephant toothpaste has the properties of both toothpaste and elephants.
We need more people like him in this world
Getting some nitric acid vibes from the devils toothpaste

It’s like I can’t not watch one of his videos when I see them
Mark Rober in 2050: Engulfing the Moon in elephant's toothpaste
Okay now I wanna see some sort of rocket powered by elephant's toothpaste that shoots into the air spitting out rainbowy foam
Mark, you are a great example of how being selfless feels 100 times better than selfish Thank you I wish more people were like you
You are super amazing ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
All I want for christmas is an uncle like Mark Rober
I'd say that you are officially the world's best uncle!

10:20 pure satisfication
Mark sounds like the best person in his town
8:19 OUCH!
My head has been hurting for 4 months and i went to the doctor but didnt find a tumor but idk why it hurts
Dang, that looks like fun. Fills me with a certain kinda classism and such
Simply amazing
11 hrs. Into existence.
What a kind gesture. Keep it up Mark.
LETS GOOO MARK
Dude, words cannot describe how incredible this was, everything you did, all your effort, just everythiiing, absolutely incredible
mark make a rocket but the thing that makes it go in the air is elafant toothpaste
is it just me, or did mark get super buff since last vid
Don't mess with 'make a wish' kids, Mark Rober will make sure they get their karma.
In one year or more or less where gonna see a new video that is something like “new elephant toothpaste record)
Does anyone know what exactly are the products of the reaction are?
But i am the biggest freaking fan of science so i feel like mark is under rated
Bro i live next to Gridley how'd i not hear about this
DO MORE COLLABS WITH MR BEAST
This video is so wholesome 💖💖💖
Your videos are so wholesome.  I love this channel and all the positive vibes it gives me.
The future futuristic bookcase fundamentally untidy because cooking conformably confuse amidst a permissible wall. third, thin stinger
You use your giant kidness in the beat way! I love what you do to make science fun for kids. And what you did for Brody was amazing. It is amazing  to see people come together to make someone happy. You succeeded more than just with your elephant toothpaste. goal. You made Brody smile!
Mark has been doing youtube about as long or longer than mr beast
mark rober, why are you actually the best person in the world
3 million views in one day. Not enough! Way to go again, Mark!
ok but can it run doom
Amazing editing
Devils toothpaste in da flask
I didn't even realise I was smiling the whole time
The absolute nerve to take money from a parasitic company like DraftKings. Losing respect.
Omigosh-
You just gotta love Mark
now weaponize it :)
Well-freaking-done, sir. Nice
I cant believe this
Hes like mumbo jumbo but irl
the fact you took time out of your year to make someone else’s year better is the best feeling ever
This human can’t get any better like seriously
Just personally knowing all the pains and stresses of constant doctor's appointments. It's truely amazing what you do for other people. You're the #1 human on my list.
I swear, there's a special spot in heaven just for Mark.
Eh
Why? Just why would he spend a year of his life planning this?
Yeah you did
Orbies must smell like onions
SLowmo guys be like "that could have been a little slower"
I think it’s crazy how much work you put  into the flask how cool it looks
how to stop kids doing whatever they're doing *Mark Rober uploaded!!* (amazing content)
that was the best youtube vid i saw in my life
What an incredible story, filled with such incredible people. Things like this really do restore one's faith in humanity!
Problem how would you clean that up now?
Mark gives me faith in humanity, but Brody giving his make a wish to another kid is selflessness at its finest
I think potassium permanganate is catalyst and high concentration of hydrogen peroxide
4:38 What did he sayyyy 🤣🤣🤣🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
I wonder how fletcher would feel seeing this! 😂😂🤣😔 Edit: Never mind
I’m not first I’m not last but you mark rover uploads I get here fast
Love that downwash from the quad 10:30
Take note, Bezos. This is how those who are more fortunate than most spend their money: helping others.
12:45 in is the money shot if anyone is only here for that.
That kid deserves this party in it's full. Using his one and only wish to help another kid is so selfless. And like Mark said, one way or another, selfless acts are always rewarded in some way.
it’s a boy !!! … I think
u not upload for long
That's not your moms peroxide.
Am I the only one who wants this guy to be my uncle
Mr yeast
Dude... You're a great guy, like everything you do. But you are now starting to look like a doll with your  manicured eyebrows and whitened teeth.
I love you videos
e
ayyo mark's editor deserves an award for this much editing skills
As a rocket league fan, Mark Rober absolutely used the same music that Lethamyr’s Intro has.
When he said private jet, I thought he was  joking.
342176th
Mark has a reserved spot in Heaven
Putting off sleep for this
When life gives you lemons
would be interesting to see a devil toothpaste flask that big, would probably go 1000ft if the flask held together😂
as awesome as all this is....who else sees an Orbeez pool as a very real choking hazard
I was looking for the Karen "super spreader event" comment but thankfully I haven't found one
+ 1 uncle
Can we just talk about the camera quality and those drone shots
There is a special place in Heaven for the Mark Rober class of people
This dude is a great human
Praying for Brody and his family. While we all think Mark is a true beast, Mark has nothing on Brody.
Is that a Lethamyr intro sing I hear?
We need more people like you.
Mark, is that Rick from "The Walking Dead"? 😀 1:43
11:52 That foot tho lol-
Nerk was almost merked
The catalyst for the devil toothpaste has a really high percent chance of being potassium permanganate. But if you read this be careful if you want to try them because the reaction is strong enough that the soviet tried to make jet fuel using the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide but was too strong that it’s was abandoned.
Instead of watching all the crap on the news, just watch Mark Rober to see the best side of humanity!
Finally Fpv drones in some videos. Cool. I like it
Please make this a yearly thing
Ok, cool cool. Now bigger.
If you made the top smaller it be longer and higher
Me after eating too much Taco Bell : 13:27
mark is the most nice and great porson in the wold
Omg the kid with the curly hair has such a happy and funny personality I’m not simping u are (I’m a minor)
4k hdr please
Can we get an f in the chat for those two mannequins
Mark rober and mrbeast uploded in the same day great day
Repost?
Dang, those kids are lucky
Mark's videos always make peoples day
beautiful
the montosh came in it was 30 sec ??????????????????????????????????????????
worlds largest forbidden boba
now do the same thing but with devils with the flask what will happen then....I DARE YOU
Wow
This is insane... 😵
💚💚💚💚💚
Imagine walking outside and seeing a huge green thing in the sky I would flip
where were the brief cases of $10K in the orbee pool like in the Mr. Beast video xD
The private jet might be quicker, but if I had to choose between being scared death for 12 minutes (I’m afraid of flying), and getting to talk to Mark Rober for 12 hours? Um…yeah. Pretty obvious choice here guys.
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry so I did both. Great science, engineering, and heart! Well done!
Mr Beast will definitely react to this video
My teacher was here
Came for the glitter bombs, stayed for the toothpaste.  Science making people happy. <3
"+10 uncle points" lol
Why did i guess private jet🤣
sensing a slight obsession here...
Mark Rober is the type of guy to make learning fun
What a full walk down memory lane lol
How do you even think of all these amazing things for other people??!! Your amazing!!🤯🤯
Okay for the people that don't know the secret ingredient is 50% hydrogen peroxide instead of 35. Not much of a secret.
here in 11 hours
How do you clean it up
hmm from the information that is shown devils toothpaste seems to be some sort of acid reaction that produces hydrogen gas. Perhaps nitric acid that sets the glove on fire.
6:38 option 2: we walk
“Is that better that going to the doctors office” seriously?🤣 I think for a boy like him,anything would be more fun than going to the doctor’s office
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Next rocket model that about 20 meter big:)
BOI HE DID IT AGAIN HE TOPPED THAT LAST VID!!! 🥳🥳🥳
10:01 it looks like the surface of the sun up close
I WAS HERE LOL
Can you give me a high five?
Mark is the most humble guy i have ever seen 🙂
He is such a cool guy!
Woah... It looks really cool! and yummy!
F Manual do Mundo
Is best channel I’m subbed to
2 million views in one day.   If you could somehow intergrade cat videos into your videos, there would be no stopping you.
Is this White people's channel ? ;-)
You have truly restored some of my faith in humanity
Cleanup vid pls
Mark rober never ceases to amaze me…
It’s been a mouth since the last video it fast omg
Me after a week break. IYKWIM
Epic vid
I hope you know that no one hates you
Hi Mark, I'm one of your biggest fan and I love science, so this channel is perfect for me.
f o a m  d a d d y
Best. Video. Ever. (I think I said that on one of your last videos too)
Never expected to cry watching your videos. Beautiful work! Thanks Mark! 👏🏻👏🏻
S tier human
Science=Fun
Wait can I be the first to drown in orbiees?
FINALLY
Next try to fill that container with a devil paste
Gemini if a flame went off
Mark Rober is an amazing human being! He helps so many people!
Mark, i’m ready for Squirrel Maze 3.0 👁👄👁
wow
Awesome
your so nice :D
If only more people who were actually successfully productive in not only a nasa spacecraft but also help people who aren’t able to but also would give their life to be a part of science would make the whole world a better place
Can’t be great for the environment
50 foot balls of Pressure...?  I am guessing that is an imperial unit or maybe there is some new 'merican system howmuchs. It definitely is not SI.
This is one of those times I wish I could like a video more than once.
Way to go brody
Mark would you put your hand in devils toothpaste for $1 million
Congratulations
This is insane
Imagine ur uncle being mark rober- a dream come true.
so basically you made a volcano and gave it steroids
Gender revel parties bout to be INSAINE
What would happen if you waited for it to be cool then jumped inside of the elefent tooth paste
Mark Rober, you are an incredible human being.
Mark you are such a nice caring person and i am glad to see you having fun and being such a awesome person. keep doing what you are doing because bro you are making so many people happy it 's great. [8]0---]----<[
When you mention the pressure of a football, do you mean a Gaelic football, which is pretty firm, a soccer ball, which is not quite as firm, or some other football? I've never held a sherrin, so I don't know what it's like. Maybe a rugby ball? American footballs look pretty soft, often like they're not fully inflated, so probably not them.
Mark rober is going to make a for real aperture science center from portal one day
:0 wow so coooooool
I was smiling the whole time watching this video!
Wow those shots are insane
If only I was there 😂 GO BRODY
Those drone shots where just the coolest thing ever
Wholesome video
Every kid in the world should have a Mark Rober in their life.
Today is my lil sister's birthday
What an amazing human being Mark is.  I had a smile from ear to ear.  He’s like a kid at heart.  Awesome!😁
I honestly cannot comprehend how wholesome this is. One of the best videos I've seen in 2021.
He made all of these things for a friend, this guy is a LEGEND.
Next year triple the size :)
I’m not crying! You are!
And this is why I watch him
11:06 I heard the music and thought a Lethamyr video was starting
Insane video loved it
this guy makes my hope come back
I'd like to believe that but not everyone gives back.Some people just take and destroy lives.learned that The hard way. Just because you care unconditionally doesn't mean they do. Not every heart is gold some are rusty iron and will give you tetnus.
What an amazing life
vseaus: i explane sckiants teded: i do to  mark rober: i recreated a volcano... a green volcano.
Nice
Please please please do this amount but with devils toothpaste, that would be epic🔥
At the end when he said it always comes back I instantly thought of michal afton
This is why you are one of the coolest people who live on the earth
Because SCIENCE!!!
Should’ve made it orange and it could’ve looked like lava
Most wholesome video of 2021, Change my mind if you can
1:57  *next video*  “How i escaped prison using elephant toothpaste”
Lethamyr intro song debut
a CJ1 Citation. :)
Ever since I was 4 Ive had a dream to work at nasa or go to space. your videos have inspired me even more.
Nowonder they call it elaphent toth paste it sounds like one 13:00
Awesome!
Nobody is going to talk about the lethamyr intro at 11:25
A lot of great people made this happen. Food for the Soul.
He should do the opposite and try to blast the flask as high as he can instead.
cant beleive they did all that work in just 17 mins amazing job
That was cool
These videos have the purest vibes on Earth
Hi mark rober cold you give me a shout out please
Once again proving why you're one of my favorite YouTubers. 😉. This was a beautiful act for Brody.💕
"I told my Friend MrBeast About this story"  Hm yes like I don't know him, I totally didn't watch who won the 500 GRAND
Ooooooooooo
Planet Maker MK2
Awesome❤️❤️❤️❤️
The ability to get all the kids out there working is impressive. Are you sure you’re not from China?
Wow, it went higher than their cameras anticipated
MARK ROBER YOUR A SUPERSTAR MATE!!! 😊😊😊 KIA KAHA!! FROM NZ
1:13 Brody, you are so kind 💗
That was craaaaazy
I wonder if it would go even higher if the exit wasn't as big There's always next year
The amount of pollution you are generating is alarming. Very unhappy with your decision.
LOVE FROM INDIA :)
there litly less toxic comets here then a mr beast vid
Goals in life:  1. Meet mark rober
Woooooooooooooooo
Legend bloke !!
Oh what a morning starting with Mark rober vid
Bro fletchers sister bad
You are a great guy with a great team behind you. Also, shout out to Mr.Beast.
did anyone else think the yellow devils toothpaste looked like scambled eggs
2:40 song?
Now we just need a  video on marks chest workout
By the look of the 4-whleer in probably a 90cc or a 110cc Honda or a different kind of bike just wanted to know
Mark is like that cool dad that always plays along with jokes and hosts the best barbeques
whats the music at 7:23
How did I not see you I live in Yuba City which is not very far from gridley maybe 15 minute drive
love the clip of the guy chugging ice 7:10
You are the best!!
wow absuluty amazing
No protective gear when riding an ATV not really responsible.  Would have wondered how this would have turned out had he fallen and gotten seriously injured. 🤦🏽
Is that illegal
The catalyst could very much be the Piranha mixture
Human of the century
Bawal sa pilipinas yan baka masita
Wait did he just give away the formula for devil’s toothpaste or is that elephants toothpaste 8:40
Sugar daddy mark
How do you dispose of almost 30 million orbeeZ? Seriously that’s a great video love science love how mark just cares and Carries himself. He’s a class act !
I love you’re videos
Imagine Mark is your uncle
This is insane and cool
Congrats by crushing the new Guinness world record. Love the crazy vids and engineering stuff that you do.
Is this where jimmy neutron went after the show ended?
I know where Brodi lives in a state I think because I ski at snowbird with the icon
Yo
high quality humbleness
Mark’s videos have the same budget as marvel movies.......
Mark rober and mrbeast are two of the best people in the world
There's only one thing that can describe this... POGCHAMP
I hardly ever comment on YouTube but this video had me smiling the entire time. Such a humble video. Marks content just keeps getting better and better.
Yup he never fails to entertain us
Well done!
did you build an entire house
7:58  The kid just flew in a private jet, and he's excited to be going in a limo.  LOL
What is foam daddy explain it mark 😳
How do u clean it up tho😂
Alright as amazing as mark is why is nobody talking about how insanely wholesome it was how Brody used his only make a wish to help another kid replace what they lost
Wow, truly amazing
This is revenge on mr beast
13:49 "the pressure pushing up in the flask was about 50 times the force you would feel when pushing against a fully inflated football."   Ok, so how much force is that in the metric system?
so what's gonna happen to the environment after all of this?
vcfgs
This makes me so happy
On the first one it didint work properly but now it now works
12:56 for what you're looking for
very cool
13:20 its like a volcanic eruption
Imagine having mark rober as your uncle 🤯😍😎
this is like the most wholesome video I've ever seen on YouTube and I don't think anything could ever best it.
Marks videos always make me smile, he's a human that goes above and beyond for others. Love ya Mark :)
Mark Rober is not here to be reasonable, I love the engineering of the absurd! Great video.
It’s cliche but it’s always a joy to watch a mark rober video
I recognized quite a bit of those people. Wonder if they knew about the three million people who would see them.
12:50 what we want to watch   your welcome
Mark's heart is as big as his brain
Hello
The true formula recepie
Markrober and mr.beast are the only 2 people on YouTube who only cares about others
I can see where this is headed World's largest elephant toothpaste ( I did it this time!)  coming next year
Finally, the trilogy of big toothpaste is done.
4:30 (Gloves + mystery liquid => fire) sure looks like concentrated hydrogen peroxide to me.  Surely that can't be the basis of the recipe that Mark made sound so mysterious, can it?
my day brighten when Mark uploads :)
Watched the entire thing with a smile on
Mark, huge props to you and everyone involved to make these kids time an enjoyable and memorable one. Awesome bro!
In my science class my classmates beg for my teacher to play just one video of your crazy and awesome ideas. I will tell him about this elephant toothpaste and other crazy ideas love u mark! 💡
Moral of the story:-Don’t mix mystery ingredients into your food colouring while manufacturing.
What are orbbies? like marbles but soft?
Hi pls mArk can u comment on my comment
Thank you for all you do mate just love this and that it goes to such deserving people once a gain thx
Wow
Mark: have your rode on a private jet Kids: no  Mark: 😎
you cant tell me this isnt a green volcano
GREAT SHOTS NURK
WOW, I think you guys could've actually been able to go 2 feet closer since it went so straight up. You also seem very careful Mark, all of your content I've seen has impressed me and I remember you're world record last year.
Dude you are a legend
I love that you are doing this in Gridley. Isn't Gridley the kiwi capital of the U.S.? Whichever stand sells those on 99, those are awesome.
13:41 I'm American and this still makes no sense
Shrek when he sees Fiona
3:54 you can also see the image shaking around on the background because they couldn't get it to sink with whatever they stole it from.
Yes
Mark is so cool
yessirrrr
Mark, you're in a whole new level of person.
Someone needs to call the EPA...
I thought it was about the boy but all the other kids literally stole his time
Where does he get all of this funding
All I can think of is lethamyr at 11:20
How were you in gridley all year and I didn’t catch wind, also the best video you’ve made imo
I've been waiting for what felt like forever for a new video I love your content!
Thanks for everything you do Mark
You deserve every single view you get and much more
At 4:10 the toothpaste looks like a confetti tho
So that's where you were at :0
12:30 what you actually clicked on the video to see. You're welcome.
Super simple formula... Do it for the kids. 🥰
So what if you filled the giant flask with devils toothpaste?
Ight back to squirrels
10:12 is a hot Cheetos
Wow im here and the video is early
Hey Mark, make a phone case that makes devil's toothpaste if there is ever too much wrong attempts
Are we ignoring that you managed to make spontaneously combusting foam?
holy moly, props to the editor like this was AMAZING
Makes videos remind me how fast time goes by
when everyone woahed the drone sound woahed too lol
Mark Rober literally is the most amazing person on the planet
is it just me or does fletcher look better than usual?
mark is going to make it five times bigger
very big surprise
Hrfhj
13:22 WoW this was bigger than last year . 😍
clout boys make millions getting more clout. this world needs to end already.
Hands down my favorite guy on the internet! Unmatched in class and style, he brings his all with every video! ❤️
this video genuinely made me smile
Those slo mo fpv shots tho
These are the drippiest kids I've ever seen
I love watching these kinds of videos that makes me realize how sad and boring my life actually is lmao
I’m commenting for the YouTube algorithm
8:00 Y'ALL OMG IT'S TOMMYINNIT 😩
Why don’t you make the largest tower of bitches
TO SPACE!!!
Beautiful masterpiece.
Me the math guy: "Did you see the fractals on that thing?"
Best video yet
10h
@10:45
Finally another video
What a great kid, we should all strive to be like Brody
I’m your biggest fan
Mark rober changes music after four thousand years of the same music: Me:   :O OH MY GAAAAARSH
Football fully inflated is about 12.5 to 13.5 psi so 50 times the average, let’s say 13 pounds is 650 psi. 🤓
“Look at the house you cant even see it!”  -Mark Rober 2021
Cute
I finally got my hands on my fav drink and this video was so interesting that I forgot about it so it went warm :( that’s mark but still I like the video a lot
Mark rober, the youngest genius and with a humanity heart ♥. Please like if you agree with me
I wish I was motivated enough to do something like this my life isn't all that eventful
what a coincidence.. markrober and nilered uploaded in the same day
After all of that I am positive to say they can use the structure for emergency purposes? Lmao
6:15 I give him lost of respect for saying TeSla instead of the much popular TeZla
2.4k people are just jealous
Orbeez are cool
I hope this dude doesn't end up being a cr33p. He's around so many kids all the time.
I love brodys story and I’m glad you guys did this for him
Wheres mark’s son
That music over the orbeez pool part just had Lethamyr running through my head
9:32 is like something out of a Deadpool movie.
I would do child labor just to meet Mark
Mark, I’m following your footsteps and going to BYU. What classes would I learn hands-on engineering in?
Mark Rober is what I use to counteract the scale of immeasurable pressure that makes me lose faith in humanity and he always tilts it the complete opposite way every time.
JEFF the welder is the real hero! Working behind the scenes to make it happen. Atta boy in making those welds hold up brotha
I knew you could do it mark
:o
In my next life I want to be like mark
This was just amazing mark is just such a really nice guy
I've never clicked on a video so fast
The quality of this video is sooo insane
Kid should be wearing a helmet.
wow
legend
Mark, you are awesome! It would be cool to someday to meet you in person. Probably not going to happen, but please keep putting smiles on not only those who do meet you, but those who look forward to your next video. Thanks for spreading positivity in an increasingly negative world.
Your like if phineas and ferb grew up
This is all warm and fuzzy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who else knows this song from lethimr 11:14    I found the actual song listened to it a bunch
Holy crap it’s been a year since they made the first video!?
Why do I what to touch the toothpaste so much 😐
Bro, you can’t just post a video and not tell me!!! Love you mark
The question is how much does this cost?
He QUADRUPLED the height from last time
11:17 isn't that lethamers intro
8:05 best part of the video
Mark robers video = flex X 100
Mark Rober Never Cease to amaze me....
Always Wholesome ❣️
one of life’s most basic questions
That ending message was beautiful. I love that 💜
Is this really a great use of the worlds limited resources I respect the birthday party for the kids but I don’t know the science but it seems like this would be bad for the environment
Just when I thought my 3 day weekend couldn’t get better
Who else is thankfully that mark Robert is uploading more then 2 videos per year now
Hi
why was the fire department there?
"is about 50x the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football."  ok but what is it. is it 5 psi? 50 psi? 500 psi? 1000000000000 psi?
Amazing stuff
and who donated the private jet      hint hint Mr. beast
I hope you know that all my engineering dreams are because of you! I hope to do great things in the future and im only a minor at the moment
1 hr ago
This video lightened up my dad and was so sweet ☺️
In the wise words of someone in the world. GOAT STATUS. If you aren't putting respect on Mark Rober and the team then idk what you're doing.
These drone shots are unbelievable. Like the speed they must be flying in combination with the FPS they must be recording at… like holy crap those super slowmo shots are UNREAL.
love what you so for this world!
foam daddy lol \
Wow
mark, you are an absolute gift to this world and i hope that a lot of people will be inspired and treat others with the kindness you do. I love your videos and take care
woah
Incredible
challenge try to contain the blast
mark you are literally a child
My guy's mr beast now
Cool
You should make a giant steel ball and put elephant toothpaste inside. A giant 💣?
GREAT JOB!!!  Also mark I wanted to thank you, these videos make me appreciate life more
I think potassium permangenate is a much better catalyst for Elephant's Toothpaste, honestly.
HOA watching this video: 👁👄👁
I get fined for dropping a receipt on the floor.
Absolute banger.
Note to self: be friends with Mark Rober
13:43 How many bars (or psi) was it because "50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" isn't really a measurement of pressure lmao
Dude that kid was so nice and humble... literally giving his make a wish to another kid, he deserves happiness and beyond :)
Next is to install a rocket on top and blast the rocket to the space 😂
7:19 THIS. SHOT. IS. SO. CLEAN. I would like to have a word with whoever edited this video.
After all the years he still puts science and facts in his videos. Incredible job, love it :)
You just cant hate mark
Mark is like that one crazy uncle...                  ...that I would love too have
all mark rober know is pool party
this video was sponsored by mr. beast   not really
Great video Mark !
So many legends! 🙌🙌❤️
i need this song in 2:33 what is it called
Really loved the drone shots in this one!
That Really encouraged me to believe
Mark isn’t just a genius, he’s funny aswell. Couldn’t stop thinking about being there!  Edit: Why is everyone saying hi in the replies hahaha!
Mark Rober out here making us cry with science
That photo at 14:59 looks absolutely incredible
did you ever meet elder Walker?
Aww naw he got bass pro hat
I want mark rober to become my uncle
Mark, love what you do to help the world. You and your team are so wonderful :)
Yoo I would drink some more Lychee Fanta
Make an rocket powered by devil's toothpaste
What kind of pathetic excuse for a human gives this a thumb down?
Those shots are insane!
Mr Beast is gonna put 10 Gallon in a stadium
Y'know it's a great day when Mark posts a video!
what is with you and 20 second montages that actually took months
You're incredible, and so is Brody for doing what he did for that kid. This is amazing.
Mark is just so inspirational his vids make me sooo happy and ❤️ from all of us love ya mark🤗❤️
"About fifty times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" ...Until what? It pops? It deforms by an inch? Both sides of the skin meet? Are you talking about the air pressure on the inside?
ayo
mark is a genius
Imagine having this guy as your uncle
Mark is probably the best relative in existence
Really cool wow!
12:11
Now I want to be disabled
Bro it would be so cool if you did a collab with hacksmith industries
This is so AWESOME!!! Thank You Mark for THE BEST 17:08 I've EVER spent on youtube!!! The things you do for kids are AMAZING!!! Thank You for being such a positive influence on our youth!!!

Mr beast is abt to give him 1 million atvs😂😂
wow Mark made the Mercury Redstone capsule
Can you do that for me and what state do you live in???
Took its the same music that lethamyr uses!!! Who knew
This is why I love this channel, you do some really cool things, but you also do these really awesome things by giving these kids a great time.

I love this channel😄
It is night  and the power just went out I am scared
MRBEAST IS YOUR FRIEND???

So for the engineers here how much was the final force on the tank by the toothpaste?

You are probably one of the purest souls on this planet. We seriously don't deserve you.
Yeahhh, sayanz beetch
You gotta say the editing in this video is amazing!
Thats huge.... just imagine making a flask 10x the size of that
12:51
nice
Where's Captain Disillusion when you need him
This is what science can give you
MARK LESS GOO
I can't believe Mark didn't expect a rebellion from the kids
Green devils toothpaste: spontaneously combusts Mark: am goat screm
this is my kingdom come
I love the glasses in the limo was just cold water lol
Heet
Amazing
. .
I want to know the 2 thousand haters
Mark rober:there are so very popular vids on YouTube with over 30 m views Me:Have you seen your views.😑
Great job.
I love it when he does things that help local community members its so natural and heartfelt <3
I didn’t even know elephant toothpaste existed
I should have figured Mark was up to something 😂
Should have brought the squirrels 🤣🤣🤣
The whitest party video on YouTube
I don't know I kinda fell bad for fletcher

I'm not crying you're crying!
i wonder if the other citizens saw that
Another world record???!?!?!??!
This Guy is the Best Uncle ever
I can only imagine this, but with devil’s toothpaste…
I wish I could do that
4:20 a very manly scream
The editing and the camera shots are jod level
This is so great m, it makes the kids believe they can really do anything and have so much joy in life
🔥🔥
I'm sorry... did you use a western version of Colt 45.... as the background song.... that's amazing
he's able to reach me more than my science teacher In 1 video
I want Mark Rober to be my uncle
Elephant Toothpaste Volcano  Thanks for renaming our band.

it make my day what Mark Rober uploads
Wow another elephant toothpaste vid:0
Why is the same kid there from last time

Instead of devils toothpaste what about mammoth toothpaste cuz its bigger than elephant????
Yea thats the closure I wanted to see!
nice leth music
So happy for all involved that it went to plan this time… I’m continually blown away by this guys ingenuity, creativity and compassion… not to mention the attention to every single little detail… Congratulations Mark!
3:46, you can also see that the hole is moving and shaking
12:47 thankz
The scale and quality of these projects and videos continues to amaze me
I love how mark is making kids with health issues happy
Mrbeast And Mark Rober is the best duet
That was INSANE
😭🤍🤍🤍
Elephant toothpaste rocket?
Now I know it is flammable. Mark you have given me one more piece of evidence to find out what you used
Does the toothpaste have a hot or cold temperature?
lol a DKNG sponsorship
Wow great ppl are all around us ! Great job ... Would you be interested in helping me build a generator that runs on its own output? This will make fuel obsolete and lead to less pollution .
honestly i dont know what i would do in life without mark
both mrbeast and mark rober uploaded!!
I can already see the BatChest when XQC gets here
the max height was 30 feet taller than the falcon 9 :oo
10 hours ago.

Loving those Drone shots
insane
What a legend
hi
If you make a Veteran tear up you have done something substantial.  Brody deserved every minute of his special day.
11:29 Lethamyer's intro
Anybody recognize Lethamyr's intro song?
Judging by how the gloves catch on fire, I'd say there might be some nitric acid in the formula
Careful music by ProleteR is copyright striker by Warner Chapel your whole channel might get claimed
are you the descendant of phineas/ferb?
i thought that kid was gavin magnus
Is so beautiful with the devil toothpaste that is why I literally love your video
second comment by me: there's a reason why these take a while to upload and we alk know why
what if you did it upside down, making a rocket?
Great job mark!!!
I still can't move on from Dr. Fletcher-
this is the best video ill ever see
Woooooh
💥🌋👌🏻😁🇺🇸🇦🇺
450 psi inside?
lets goooooooooooooooooo the comeback
When someone is bored of quarantine
Awesome
Bro i like the vid shots in this video especially the elephant tooth paste part and the devils toothpaste
Bruuh so cooooool and it tall like building
Mark: 50 times the force of a fully inflated football Me: ah yes... America
You should make a devil's toothpaste flamethrower
Oh hope this becomes a yearly thing
Devils toothpaste flask next????
YOU'RE THE BEST MARK ROBER! 👏🏻🤍
Wholesome youtube is the best
Cool
YOU FINALLY DID IT AGAIN!!!  AND THATS SO COOL WHEN ITS NOT FLING :D
Lesss gooo Go saints! Because i am from Louisiana bois!
World class, like always
congarts
The slowmo is so satisfying
Imagine being Brodys friend☺️🤩🥳
2.3k people have no souls
GIVE THIS GUY SOME CREDIT
"Uncle what is mark robert doing there?" "Oh his just doing some crazy stuff again" "Oh"
I'm so glad he invited back Fletcher this year
"private jet" why is the er even a choice.
THE MUSIC IS SOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No doubt the best video ever made! THIS IS LITTERY THE BEST VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow = D
a year later he will be hosting a party for technoblade and its gonna be 100x more fun than anything mark has done in the past
You have made that boy so happy💙💙
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
When he said, I gave my friend Mr. Beast a call so calmly, I knew it was about to go down.
mark when he threw the child up: +1 Uncle points me when i saw it say that: r u serious
3,000,000 VIEWER

Mark is America's favorite uncle.
anyone know what the song at 7:25 is called?
I'd love to come and help the next time you're in Gridley.
Everything that you do is incredible, and this is no exception!
Most ofthe fun ever
I wonder if that kid got his 4 wheeler back
the drone shots give me life. insane job on this mark! you are incredible <3
When ever I see your videos like these it make me smile really hard it hurts
Respect..
I love mrbeats
Humanity=Mark Rober ❤️❤️
Cgi
That kid will never be happy again after this
Fletcher is jealous         So am I
Genuinely nothing I love more than seeing a lifeguard at a big pool party!
Must be legal in the US the record yourself while driving with kids in the car..
Awesome
Mark has fulfilled his quest to become the uncle of the year, becoming uncles to many more kids than he’s related to.
I think Mark spent more money on cameras than the actual world record…
More this. Less ….most other things.
Make a 10 ton volumetric pipet and blast that to space like a laserbem
Those drone shots are reMARKable
You really outdone yourself on this one.
YES GREAT JOB!!
you can find the recipe for the more explosive devils toothpaste at  Integza  channel where he makes it.
👏🏻🤍
Yea i knew mrbeast react to that lol
Can you do my birthday?
One work mark… BIGGER
I love Mark Rober but all these kids look like they're going to grow up to be Karen's and DB's lol
Can you make an extended version of the 20 second build montage, maybe a 30 minute build montage? Please?
It doesn't get too much more wholesome. 💖👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
Huge project. Congrats on piecing it all together. Still, it always makes me sad/upset to see a scientist using Imperial measurements.
Videos that grow exponentially!
U said u don't give out devils paste recipe yet you just said the hydrogen and soap something
2.3 million views in 6 hours...
Ayoo, New Mark Rober upload amazing
This guy must be LOADED
Mark Rober would be the coolest uncle to have
So how much pressure is "pushing 50 footballs"?? in real units hahaha
best youtuber in the world smart and care for people and environment and in need and cool
mark is one step closer to making a real volcano.
:))
that is astonishing!!!!!
Ok but what if it was actually a rocket though
How can 2300 people downvote this
You should do a fantasy football video 👍🏻
one of the best ways to spend money
it is videos and PEOPLE like everyone that assisted in this party that make me happy that there are great people in the messed up world.
The king of elephant toothpaste has came back
Absolutely freaking love Mark Rober videos!!!! So cool that you got Nurk fpv to run the Drone footage. Go Nurk!!!
That was awesome
Well done👍💖🕊️
keep doing this, this is amazing
Always love watching every video you make. Respect mark and everyone involved.
What an awesome video 🥳
bonksys stream when?
Mrflimflam
i'm getting tired of slo mo replays
This is not just an elephant tooth paste world record  This is an anti air gun
Just great!
technically hes still working for nasa by sending massive flasks to space lol
What IS science?
W
It’s like a pimple, But less pus & snot and more hot fluffy hydrogen :\
You should try to power a car with light
You’re doing a great thing!
i'm normally toxic but i have to admit, you guys know how to party
Mediocre at best🤭
These are some of the luckiest kids on earth, cuz they get to meet Mark Rober AND Mr Beast, as well as become famous, and have lots of monet.
How high can elephant toothpaste be launched into space? It went into orbit! ISS is gonna see a frozen bit flying past their window one day.
and then the devils toothpaste lights on fire and burns the house down
“A small act of kindness creates an endless ripple that comes back to you.”
this guy found a glitch in the matrix
10:06 That's a really sweet shot 13:58 Another sweet shot
hey its my birth day in fore days i am turning 11 what should i get for my birthday and you inspire me so much thanks
At this point , it wouldn't be surprising if he tries to launch elephant toothpaste into space!
His videos not only have amazing science experiments but they always have a special meaning that inspires me
World greatest uncle has done it again.
I need to know: who cleans up after these gigs!!??
YOUR THE BEST
Teacher: So Brody, what did you do for your science project?
When u wish that mark was ur uncle:
Wow what a remarkable thing to do.  Mark your all heart.  Great job.
Mark… You have done it again!!!!! I swear your videos get better every time I see them!!!!!!!! And including Mrbeast in your videos is awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Keep up the absolutely amazing work mark as we shall see you in a month! Also this video was just after my 17th birthday and I was having a rough day so I’m glad you could step in to help me, I’ll be it indirectly but still, thank you for giving me something to look forward to, and keep up the absolutely amazing work!!!!
Wow that turned out great
My science has your merch
Talk about a super eruption. That elephant toothpaste volcano was insane! Nice job mark!
Now Elon Musk has to actually send some elephant toothpaste to space
been to gridley before the people are nice there
All the rober friends are here
Next you gotta be inside a house having a party and whole the party is going on the house slowly covers with elephants toothpaste.
Thank you for the hope :)
Devils toothpaste is probably just high concentrate peroxide, which is basically just rocket fuel
Mark rober your are the most genuine human I have seen. Selfless
what FUN
Can you heart this so I can brag to my friends?
Mark Rober next video: Using elephant toothpaste as fuel for the rocket to go to space
Really cool but i have one reason for you to do it again bigger and better, The pressure wasn't at it's most because of the bolt and there was foam spraying out a bit. ( totally not an excuse for you to do it again though )
Hwo is this 9 hors ago
Tbh i would protest immediately
He always says that he is on a quest to be the favorite uncle, but who is the other uncle? What legendary hero must he overcome with insane inventions? I want answers.
Explosive toothpaste
congrats you made a volcano =D
Anyone else here lethemyr's ,from rocket league videos, intro music at 11:29 ?
Somewhere in the future the new gun is just devil's toothpaste in a pistol
YOUR AWESOME
1 word… INSANE
Word to your mutha
was that a 4 stick backhoe?
why tho
"it always comes back"
The jazzy entrance acutely brush because macaroni ophthalmoscopically coach abaft a tangible hyacinth. secretive, detailed clock
one small step for elephant tooth paste one tiny leap for devils tooth paste and a HUGE leap for science!
What wankers would vote this down???  Fantastic job guys!!!!
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!!!!!🥰😁😁😁
The way the plume collapsed on itself as the thrust pressure dropped reminded me of how pyroclastic flows happen - I think?  I heard they are caused by the ash plume collapsing just like that.
This was nice
The drone footage is epic
I heard keef outro
why cant i be like these kids :(
Great video. Glad the elephant toothpaste finally worked compared to last year! Was awesome to see the Mr Beast cross over on here too. Looks like Brody had an awesome time :D
Imagen if u everybody had this kind of party the world would be a huge party
Amazing! I CANT BELIVE YOU DID THIS!
👀👀
Finally
I’ve always wanted to do this but im am a regular kid with unknown YouTube channel
I love the video cut dude seriously just stop with all the replays
This is so wholesome wow
Just spent 17 minutes and 8 seconds smiling.  Mark is such a great human.
These videos always make me smile
Did anyone else see that kid down the seltzer in the champagne flute in one gulp?
Need my own orbie pool please and thank you, how do I make that happen lol
Mark Rober 💙
Omg remember ur first devil's toothpaste.  'Child labor' Mark Rober.
He got so excited he lost his voice
ok but if anyone knows how to make devils toothpaste lmk
Mark you could open a party planner business…
All you can hear is Nurks drones screaming lol
is it jut me or did they build the whole house and everything other than flask and the pool?                                                                                                                    o _ o
LETSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lul the nerds didn’t even say thank you
:D
The atvs ate the best part of the vid
That kid brody is so nice
A true genius and seems like such a humble and down to earth dude.....and the master of YouTube as a hole and mastered the algorithm.....I've never not watched a Rober video from start to finish.....always click and am stuck till over and that's very rare for me.....kudos to you and all that you and your team mark the world is a better place with you being a part of it
Just great.
Self propelled elephant toothpaste rocket?
I FOUND THE RECIPE AFTER 6 MONTHS OF experimentation
(Tip) Don't do the peace hand backwards, always palm forward, cuz it's kinda a swear across the pond. Yes we are weird
🥲
Wholesum
Hahaha nice, I hope these continue to get more out of hand
Yessssssssss!!!!!!!!!! Another one!!!! Yesssss!!!!
So Mark... U just figured out who to break YouTube's algorithm hum?
Whitest party ever bro.... no spice
anyone else get confused when Lethamyrs theme song came on??
i think this aint "Lethamyrs song now"  RIP
Theres still faith for humanity
rober posted
That mark rober logo on the flask is so unnecessary and I love it
Everybody needs a uncle like mark :D
who cutting onions ... please stop 🥺
Always look forward to your videos
i'm speechless.  This was epic and everyone whom help putting this awesome video!
Suddenly I want to be marks neighbor 🤣
I have a question for you is gravity a force
Hey Mark got my T-shirt in and I love it!!  Thanks so much!!
This stock music is OP!
Ool
This was so wholesome
I've been going to hospital as long as I can remember and it can be so hard and stressful for a kid to go through
13:30 me after Taco Bell.
Who remembers when it was called slime fountain
Who else wishes they were one of those kids
This again?
I wish these videos went into as much detail about the build as Smarter Everyday and Stuff Made Here
mark rober in 2050: I MADE A NUKE BIG ENOUGH TO DESTROY EARTH watch till the end to see  the earth gone.
Ell yeah
Mark is single handedly keeping Orbeez in business
Foam daddy LMFAOOO
You have such a brilliant, fun mind and a huge heart!
Hey Mack even the elephant toothpaste sounds like an elephant trunk!
4:12, do a worlds biggest elephant napalm :)
Mark in 2059: We sent elephant toothpaste to space
The king is back
Does anyone else notice there’s only white kids? 🤔
I'm sorry did this guy just kidnapp six children
Bro
Thank you @markrober and the amazing people in that town for reminding us what being a kid is all about. Such kindness is awesome!!!!
Mark Rober: Build The worlds biggest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano  Also Mark Rober: Not Enough Builds A Even Bigger Elephant Toothpaste Volcano
13506th comment

Nice
I love your videos Mark you are doin go great
20 mill almost
What will happen if u put devil toothpaste instead
Do you think you can post the building process
Again
Thank you
My satisfaction is immeasurable and my day is complete.
What are the effects of these experiments on the local environment?
World record! Congrats!
Cool
Ayo, fletchers sister doe
These camera shots and angled amazes me, its insane!
Mark Rober is honestly just a big kid.
0:40 Next time just use the Mercury capsule... 🤷‍♂️
Imagine being his nephew 😏
Cool
Wait why again?
We need more kids like that.
You should do this every year for kids in need! :)
Hulk got too excited in the end
13:11 POV: *Chernobyl*
Your a fcuking legend!
Mark done did it again. Love it
T I m m y
+1 uncle point more like 100 😂
“Foam daddy~” 7:43   Edit: I’m so sorry for that😅
Love everything about this video!
Now do it in space.
13:11 gender reveal parties be like:
4:07 Everything reminds me of her...
I wish i could have a party like this
Congrats!🎉🎈🎊 ❤️amazing I wish I was there!
This is Hulk's kingdom come, this is Hulk's kingdom come.
how come the elephant toothpaste flew higher than my iq in decimals
i dont understand how each video gets better than the other
Can you break the stratosphere tho? I really wanna see the goop float thru space. (wait CAN you? Like physically?)
What if Mark dissent give out the devils toothpaste thing because no one will break him reacord?
wait you and jimmy are friends what
dude, I thought you already did this twice
You always do such great things for so many people. I love every single one of your videos and the fact that they are not controversial. Just straight up fun. With everything going on nowadays it is nice to have a person like you in the world. Thanks.
Funday for those firemen 😂😂🤣 not your average safety post 😂😂
Imagine this but with gliw in the dark paint
Almost as high as a coastal redwood tree.
How much force is a fully inflated football?
Science Mr. Beast.
Foam daddy 😏
Why was there a French greeting at 12:44
Such a hart warming story ❤️❤️
Mark: "let's break the world record once again" Mark: * brought massive nuke*
You're a great person.
I don't need the formula because you make such great videos!
why is it literally all white people…
Amazing  👏
Pog
POG CHAMPPP
I wish mark could do this for me
Americans will never cease to use anything but the metric system.  50x the force you feel when pressing on a football
what would happen if you put a person in it
Bruh i thought mr beast gonna give him 1M dollars
This is how you launch something
Amazing. Great video
No one: Guys on December first:
YES
He needs to fill the flask with devil’s toothpaste
Love that u used rocket leauge musi6
u should start a business for making partys
hey mark whats with the slo mo guys sounds?
You've got a heart of pure gold Mark. Pure gold.
cant wait to see his 20 million subscriber special
I still don’t get why this isn’t on 1# ON TRENDING
I had to choose between an odd1sout video, and a Mark Rober video.
Mark is the definition of cool.
Iknow mark is a genius but he always act weird 😆 14:13
50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football…. These American units are getting out of hand
Mark, is literally the science hero of 2000’s kid
When it doesn't break
Mark Rober Doctor Impersonation
At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if Mark created a new life form.
You genuinely are a great human being
4:12 boy, you weren’t kidding when you said *devil’s* toothpaste.
FINALLY MARK! YOU GOT A NEW ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE RECORD VID!!!! wowwwwwww
Woah drones
Whenever I watch these u only think one thing  “What I would give to have an uncle like you”
Again one of the most wholesome videos out there and you made a child truly have the best day of their life!
Wish we had a thermal camera during the eruption, so cool
more flecher yay
What the fu-
How you clean all this stuff up?
This would be awsome
The drone shots though...
Mark should buy a small house and make it explode/fill up or something with elephant toothpaste or devil's toothpaste
I’ve never seen a segmented pressure vessel..that’s all you had to know to consider if it would fail or not last time
Mr. Rober, did u notice that you've been using a rather rude hand gesture a lot this video?  (The v with the hand but the palm is facing yourself)
Omg the child who gave his atv to another kid. My heart
I respect the whatermark
I see 3 of these vids similar, they are epic records!
Question Mark, where is your son in all this fun activities?
New video!!
Yooo i go to school with brody, thats cool asf to see him in here.
Wow that was cool
Once again marks proves he's the coolest person on YouTube
I guess Jimmy is going to try and beat your record again Mark
Nobody: mark hard flexing his new bought camera😂
🥺
I will be back here next year and I hope I have a video of me helping people like you do. Wish me luck and thanks for doing these things. You are an excellent Human Being.
This is one of the highest quality videos I’ve seen in a while. Also the drone shots were crazy
Holy crap that story is so sad
Wait this was only 9 HOURS AGO? OMG literally not kidding three of my favorite YouTubers including this Chanel uploaded a new video in this one day
Hey Mark, any chance we'll get a devil's toothpaste rerun?
this should be written down in history
*The original title was : Worlds Tallest Slime Volcano*  *But then he changed it like 1 hour later*
Is it me or some YouTube videos now have bigger budgets than tv shows?
what happens if you're standing in it?
Mark you are a child in a man's body lol
,
forbidden guacamole
hmm
Again?
hi lol
Congratulations for the new world record🥳🥳
"What do you do for a living?" "Make a mess." 😆...at least it's for great causes.
Well done to all that worked on this project .For the 2.1K thumbs down when I watched this video, a wish for your lives to becomes happier in the future.
YOU STOLE MY LIMO!
Great video!
✌🏼
is it me or are there only white people in this
YEAH YOU GO BRODY
Let's be honest. Mark is the greatest uncle alive.
Next year he gonna make it go into space
Holy crap dude you're the coolest uncle figure ever
Next: how much elephant toothpaste to fly a rocket to space
Mark: Let's put Hiroshima into perspective.
If it didn't go confetti it would have gone to space
A nice idea would be an elephant toothpaste rocket
This devils toothpaste sounds like the perfect Zombie defence
Think about *all the joy* you gave to your new, young friends, too!
Mark is just a child in a man's body
🤯
The building montage took 1 second longer than 20 seconds
Anonymous benefactor probably Jimmy Kimmel
Bruh imagine the cleanup for all of this
Devils toothpaste powerd rocket
That concrete hexagon cement base would be nice to have like a DJ booth or band that would like spin I guess (slowly) and so you can have like a 360 concert
I love the ''mark rober'' music!
How's this mans video quality better than some movies
i would rather have this guy as my uncle than the virus stopping
I love how many people were included, so sweet
Hey Mark, what effect would shaping the discharge of the flask like a rocket nozzle produce?
This is the best ever thing that could have happened for that kid. I'm so happy for him. Hope he gets well soon
50 footballs of pressure
Mark Rober has pepperoni nipps
I’ll never get ANYTHING like that😪
Bro this is awesome!
Mark Rober here playing through life in creative mode
That is so cool I remember  the last one this one is so much better
13:05
wow
Bro how are you going to top this🤯🤔i cant see how its possible
Hello mark rober I love your videos I really want to do stuff like u but I don't have money I ask how do u think u can learn.
Y'all made me jelly with all the surprises 😂
Wow
mark in 2040:ill make a even better cybertruck!
Hey Mark there's this Youtuber called integza who made a elephant toothpaste rocket engine so can you perhaps give him the deadly devils toothpaste mixture
the person that stole the ATV must look like the deformed Winnie the Pooh meme
For anyone that gave this video a negative “thumbs” down… Really???  For so many reasons, you shouldn’t have. But probably the main one… Can you not simply be happy for others! It looked like a great time for most all involved. I think it ROCKS!!! Thanks Mark, you do some AWESOME stuff.
Mark your like a adult kid, its so funny
Hi
I'm not crying, you are crying!
Tall elephants need toothpaste too.
Mark Rober
Carl Approves
This is what I imagine chemical warfare to look like
Woah!
Can't imagine someone dying from this thing.
I LIVE IN GRIDLEY THIS IS AWESOME
Should Callab with Peter S to do a Elephant Toothpaste Rocket.
Brody's, you're awesome. Hopefully it was one of your best days ever (so far)!
sad :( i wish you code do 1 fr me :(
13:00 When the Devil uncorks the spirits of a five thousand elephant herd to be heard the world over.
When scientist is cool more that band members
Mark is the Phineas of real life.
What was the mayor reaction?
Respect Bro!!
This is if bill nye and mr beast were fused together
Only the finest of water.
9:55 it looks like molten lava
Pure awesomeness!! You have the biggest heart ever!  World leaders should learn from you!!
Dammit I wish I had an uncle like that
Epic! :)
This guy is the definition of a legend
This videos are just so great and satisfying to watch, thank you for uploading these videos for us to watch. 👍👍
Mark: when you give someone something, you  will always get something back Also mark: doesn’t give something to the builders
Hopefully you had that awesome party before that a-hole Delta ruined things again. What a blast
Absolutely amazing
Love it.  Thanks for being a great guy.   Bonus points for being fun and interesting :)
100th video!
Another awesome video love it bro thanks for the entertainment
Mark is the best.
Yay Mark Robber
to confirm, pressure was 50x13 = 650 psi?
I love Mark Rober, videos and Mrbeast!!!!!
This is a really awesome thing y’all did for that kid.
2 minutes in and im already crying
Kindness always comes back
"I even harnessed some child labor." 1:56
rember when it said “14 minutes ago”
Mark, you are just the biggest kid there is and it’s great. Keep it up!
1:56 "I even harnessed some child labor."
mark, you've out done yourself
awesome
"I even harnessed some child labor" Cursed line
The whole start reminds me of stardew valley, you got all the townsfolk to help you
If every birthday party was like this Depression would be a theory.
Devils toothpaste is would be the perfect grad prank. Just get 5 trucks with a little cannon in the back and launch it onto the school
Woah
What an awesome community for rallying around Brody and volunteering to help. A very kind act by a lot of skilled people. Communities need more volunteering like this that brings people together.
This video made me cry
Love it
Experience of a life time for those kids. Mad, mad props Mark!
✝️Fellowship invite
Omg he remade my favorite video on YouTube thank you so much you are amazing!!!
You're just the best youtuber ever, I have no other words to describe you...
Yoo new elephant toothpaste vid pog pog
Next year Mark's gonna build a volcano
This is truly amazing
What if a plane hit it...
Im sorry after all ive seen in this video, Trashcan rockets is where im like "what"
The bird was like: WOOW a new tree out of nowheree yayy Oof it's gone Oh I just realised it was a drone
What's the force tho
Now turn the flask over and launch everyone to space for a day 😉  You’re a wonderful guy. Love what you do not just for all of us but for those who need it more than us
You want him to break his neck aswell
I can't believe that Mr beast doesn't have a sl-mo and mark Robert does what the heck
JUST AWESOME
I could have sworn at first the title said slime

Mark Rober should put closed captioning on his videos for people who are deaf or just want to not have volume
Heroes without capes 🥰💟
13:01 wow it sounds like an elephant-
The engineering rocks!
Mark's vid title:I finally did it! Me:wait I thought you already broke a world record in the last one?

Help others even when they cant help you back ..😇
When life gives you lemonade,make a giant elephant toothpaste flask and make everyone go crazy
@Mark Rober  Make a discord server for your community to chat around, suggest videos and just interact with your community/fans
Mark epitomizes the true heart and soul of America - organizing an entire community to help someone in need. Keep it up mate!
Dude this is crazy
will anyone break that world record
YES
Finally dude
He's level 100 in chemical spill simulator
to have a party like this would be awesome!!!
Is this a repost? I swear I saw this video a long time ago.
Wholesome ❤🤧
Is this a repost? Im confused
When you absolutely need a heaping dose of faith in humanity: This video. Very well done!
The drone shot is great
The flask still leaked a bit
Waiting for this to be on Daily Dose of Internet.
its truly amazing what you can accomplish when people get together like this. marks videos are always soooo heartwarming. hes such an incredible person it always blows my mind
This was an insane video!  *but can you beat the world record again?*
mark I agree
Always amazing! Always impressive!
a like is not enough to express my appreciation
I bet the guy who stole the bike feels like the scummiest human being in the world.
Is it Christmas?
10:00 that looks like a giant thing of lasgnia
Mark Rober strikes again! I love it! amazing content!
Claim your "Here before #1 Trending"
€ät Rit€ PhööD bättell känzlärr ^ ^

who else is here before trending?
I wonder, what is you ran into the middle,I wonder:>
Could this be used to launch rockets?
If Mark tries this hard to be the better uncle, then I can only imagine who the other uncle is
Europeans: we use the metric system! Americans: yeah that was about 50 times the force of a football
OMG THATS ME
the drone on takeoff : reEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEeEeEeE
How to win the science fair:  Make this
I love how you do this as like a second make a wish reward, for those who have fought had and fought for others
sumpah ini video terlama yg gua tunggu tanpa sadar wkwkw
Imagine your just walking in the woods and then you see this
Do you ever wonder, what happened if mark rober is my uncle?
One of the best youtubers
Yeah i made a fantasy football too. Ronaldo lukaku salah TAA manage to fit em all in an all round team too so yeahh
What if the nozzle was slightly smaller and fully round
I wounder what will come next year surprise me mark.

Lethamyr song lol

I don’t need sleep… WE need answers
bigger than a elephant
Hey Mark, I’m taking Chemistry for Grade 10 this year… can you teach me???
That flask had some major Taco Bell.
Mark = best uncle ever vibes
i feel like you make a rocket engine with devils toothpaste
If WW3 ever rolls around (and lets hope it doesnt) we should use devils toothpaste bombs instead of normal bombs to make war a  bit more colourful!! :D
Yessssssss another mark rober vid yessssssssssss
now do it with the devil's toothpaste
I was waiting for a video like this to come out
Mr in Mr Beast stands for Mark Rober
Mark  every time when someone else gets a record: gib me
This is insane
10:00 me after Taco Bell
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video will probably make you tons of money, but have you ever heard about ecology? 😏🌍
This is better than Nickelodeon's Slime.
Next years video: worlds biggest elephant toothpaste extinction event
What is the environmental impact of videos like this. What happens to all this stuff after your video. For example The orbeez, or the concrete in the field?
Would love to know how to make devils toothpaste
Love it ❤️ keep uploading this wholesome content!!!
HES BACK
Yea my flexing mentor us back
imagine doing it with devils toothpaste
14:00 looks like Walther White came by to have a look to this chemistry
Congrats!
Is this in utah? Looks like maybe Nephi or so
When the orbees went through the tube and into the pool….. my life was complete
Mark Rober is one of the people that have actually been waiting for years.
ya they are lucky
Any other youtube would make 5 videos of each attraction built here, and yo u give us a 20 seconds montage and more than 16 minutes of fun!!!!! thanks!
I really want to know what loser gives these videos a thumbs down....
You can make it into a mercury-type space capsule attraction instead of dumping it now. Just redecorate the inside with instruments and stuff.
Amazing
Love this
YAY  :O
all i can say is......            about FRICKIN TIME
Rip Truck
You are honestly one of the coolest humans ever. Sadly if im ever a father and or uncle I'll never be that cool.
Well done Mark 👏
you are so kind
other kid looks like a mini scott gaunson
I just wanna say you are a great person, thank you
its amazing what you can do for people when you're willing to spend the money
best video EVER
WOW
Why does power vision have the USA communist party symbol?
whats the build montage song
I love that way you showed the combustible devils toothpaste and it’s hazards instead of pandering. Beautiful!
put the mannequin in the elephants next year and we can see how far it can fly
Astronauts: "Uh, Houston? We have a giant green substance here...?" Mission Control: "Oh, yeah, that's just Mark again."
Hello
Love your videos Mark, and love what you're doing for the world. Happy Fathers day (its today in Australia)
Has anyone noticed mark has been skipping his workout?🙄🧐
Welp, Mark's gone mad.....what now? 😂😛
so technically your the fun parent, spoiling your youngest child
I don't know if I've just never really been listening when watching this demonstration, but I just realized that it sounds like an elephant and also realized why it's called elephant's toothpaste XD
Didn’t you upload this before?
Have a great Fathers day Mark
mkay now make one that can handle that volume of devil's toothpaste
7:44 what does that say 😳😬😳😬
Next year you should build a mini rollercoaster
i dont mean to get political or anything but twix bars are elite
POV: you’re the fun uncle
Watching the orbeez in the clear tube was so satisfying
Love ya Mark! Truly an inspiration for all of us. Remember kids! Always be yourself..!!. Unless you can be like Mark Rober.. Then be like Mark Rober!
What if u flipped it upside down and tried  to make a devils toothpaste rocket
Mark had a Skyscraper for 10 seconds. Nicce
Hehehehe now make an elephant toothpaste powered car that goes at least 60 mph
yo mark im from new orleans saints are ma life!!!!!!!!!!!
I know the recipe of devils tooth paste
cool video
In my opinion, your videos of helping people are by far the best videos you have made! Thanks for sharing these stories!
Epic surprise party.
Respect to the one who is cleaning this
_It’s Official,_ *_Mark Has Gone Mad with Kindness_*
Dang, they don't call it devil's toothpaste for nothing
wow thats cool
Ayyyyyyyyyyy my names brody
Most wholesome video I have ever watched... btw the editor deserves a raise... 👌🙃
Untill every child is well. 🎗
compressing down the paragraphs and paragraphs i was going to write into one quick message, beautiful. just beautiful.  thank you mark 🙏💛
Squirrel vid 🐿🐿🐿🐿🐿🐿🐿 pls
Yay only 8 hours late
I have just one question.  Was it to clean up after the party?
Great job mark 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Way to much fun
12:44
it looks like scrambled eggs from the devils toothpaste
Guess I'm out of the loop, haven't brushed a elephant's teeth in some time and had know clue what elephant toothpaste was. Have to say I'm sold.  Not sure about the elephant.
Everyone gangsta until grandpa rides a unicorn floaty down an abnormally wide slide
Fletcher=🤴
RIP manequin
I  wanted to go to your house
Ay
Can I please claim you as my uncle? This looks AWESOME!!!
Mark you look ripped!
Money spent more then ever I could spend on that
13:45 They will never convert to metric...
I kinda wish that I was a carpenter or welder so that I could help if something like this ever came to my town.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Mark, you're amazing. Thanks for being yourself. I'll never be you, but that doesn't mean that I'll ever stop trying to be like you.
Can we get an RIP for the other uncles that have to compete with Mark?
Mark you are so nice
Yo lemons
Mr beast: gives away money  Pewdiepie: makes gaming videos  Mark: lets paint the earth
the building time lapse is the same beat to the colt 45 rap
Once again, Mark shows why and how he's the best guy on the internet.
if work in nasa makes you this nice, i want that the intire world work there
This is why I am always so excited for your videos to come out every month because you keep breaking your own records or developing a new concept that becomes so famous that everybody at my school talks about it
I love Mark Rober debunking myths. The edit of the orbee, soda, and mentos video was crappy.
Well, that eruption is comparable to that of Io's😅
B I G G E R
13:48 .... why couldn't you just say the number?
I'm loving the over engineered flask.  This whole vid was great Mark. I want to thank you for just being a lovable guy in this world that feels like it keeps getting worse. There aren't enough folks like you around.
Just... wow. Well done.  Also, while it may not be environmentally sound, I wonder if there would be a way to incorporate helium in your elephant toothpaste formula.
11:09 lethymr's Intro    poggers
LETTTS GOOO the collab with the slo no guys
What camera/stabilizer were you using for all those amazing swimming shots?
No Mark you see that wrong it’s “ when life gives you lemons export them in every way” 🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
when you spend a couple years at nasa you can do this for people like that
Ok but what if you plug the top and unbolt the bottom? Mega flask rocket could probably also go 250ft
oh hi mark! this was amazing!!
Bro I can’t even build a pillow fort
Breaking youtube one video at a time!
Neat, science is great entertainment.
POGGGGGGGG you did it
Was waiting for this. Fantastic video as always.
You always say it wouldn’t be from lack of effort why do you say that
That was so amazing .
money
Wow just wow
Hi mark, I love your videos. I have been watching you for like a year and have watched like 50 of you videos. I also think that all of your builds ( including this one) were awesome.
The clips that those drones got and the edits in this video are so clean and crisp and I love it
Nurt was the drone pilot? Sweet. I loved watching him on Drone Racing’s League.
Just me or does mark sound different
so so sooo incredible!!!
Every video makes it harder for me to relate to him. Even watching the video and accepting it as documenting reality, I find his life, and those of the supporting cast, hard to believe.
I thought it would be cool if you and your team made artificial intelligence
Rober be out here making peoples life better. Applause to him.
Nice
He said the devil thoth paste ingredients
Vai deixar? @Manual do Mundo
do I remember in a previous video that Mark said that he wouldn't go in a private jet again?
"The height of the blast was a 25-story building, which is 250ft"   2017 Kong: *Looks up in fear*
Oh. How I wish I can spend a day like this.
1:57 Sounds like something a big corporation would do
I like how his parties are always so white... you know what I mean. Love the channel otherwise.
Every single frame of the volcano can be a background.
This is crazy
its my birthday!
now you need to put devils toothpaste in the flask!!
Yesssssss😎😎😎😎
ok so after watching this i tought hey imma try this-   me realizing i can’t do this:   .. oh ok

Wanjir video baru, bisa pas bgt gw kesini mau liat ini
2.5 Mio views in 8 hours... you beautiful dude broke youtube by being an amazing person ❤

You are such a decent guy 👍🏻
Did you hire an actual lifeguard for this
Dis dude best friend s with Mark rober
that’s absolutely insane 😳
Whose cutting onions in here?
Next year: I built an elephant tooth paste rocket and went to space
This song is amazing
This is such a wholesome thing. All he wanted to do was give them an amazing birthday party. And they're never going to forget how amazing it was! Go going Mr. Rober
Its Like Pompeii All over again.
Thats not elephant toothpaste thats big boogers
Today I mark the day that Mark rober befriended an ENTIRE TOWN. WE JUST NOT GANNA TALK ABOUT THIS
i cant believe mark fr got his town together for is mad science expiriments
Gg
9:40 RIP plants 🪴
this honestly deserves to be one of the most liked videos on the internet
As soon as you say “I don’t give out the formula”, people searching the web!
i cry with this video ❤️
Lol the fullness of that belly flop send 💯 8:18
Everyone remember when it said slime instead of elephants toothpaste?
Probably one of the Smartest YouTubers I know.
Engineering after inventing mark rober: Big bucks rollin in
What is the diffrent of the normal and the devil tooth paste?
To everyone involved, thank you for making the most awesome and amazing day any kid could dream of.
I got the same 4 weeler a YFZ 450r the #1 racing 4 weeler
13:00 IT SOUNDED LIKE AN ELEPHENT
Put the manicans in the flask
Mark I was the driver of the limo.  It was an honor and a privilege I will never forget to be a part of this special day
Imagine having to clean this up…
Hey
This is the most mark rober video of all time
Lethamyr?
Respect Mark. Way to leave your mark on this planet forever. You have changed the course of the future with how you influence and excite people over engineering. thank you.
Its Been A Long Time Since You Uploaded
Mark just casually sliding down the water slide backwards and pulling the fingers at the camera 🤣
Love it!
Thanks for making me and many other people smile Mark!
We should appreciate how mark rober actually made kids happy and did a party and made something fun for the kids to do in his life. He spends so much work on stuff to make people feel happy about themselves.  Edit: thank you so much for liking this comment! This is my most liked comment I ever had!
I love how he finds the families who are going through a struggle and gives them a really happy surprise
You are so awesome! I love your videos!
Driving an electric car to a private jet... so, yeah.
He used that same French background music that magnus midtbo always uses
White people party
10:00 lava
I love it when Youtubers do incredible things like this to help others.
Your mom when I-
Awesome video Mark! 😃
Ahhh… 50% (or higher) hydrogen peroxide.
It’s always a 50/50 if I’m going to tear up by the end of a Mark Rober video, but I know 100% of the time it will always make me smile.
Rober you're a phenomenal human being
Mark may be the greatest YouTube ever
That was freggin awesome !!!!!!
This guy has never made a bad video. Mark the GOAT!
Me after Taco Bell: 13:11
its my birthday in 4 days and Congrats on selling the Guinness world record of the worlds tallest ele toothpaste  volcano
Dude, you have a heart of gold. Never stop being who you are!
Why didn't you use the liquid sand?
And then all of the kids started fighting
Love you guys .
Gender reveals be like
I'm jealous I've never met a yter XD
So 50 times a football psi? Assuming you mean the NFL standard of 12.5 to 13.5, let's call it 13 X 50 which gives is 650. So 650 PSI?
So clearly the next step is a rocket powered by elephant's toothpaste...
I appreciate everything you do, Mr. Rober! That MrBeast fella is pretty cool too...
Mark Rober's, by far, the most generous and incredible person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Him and Jimmy go hand in hand.
I LOVE how Mark just gets all in the slides and the Orbeez pool just like a big kid!
That green elephant toothpaste looks guacamole
What is surprising is that my 8K tv, still couldn't render the clearest shots
Im not crying, you're crying!
I’m super jealous that the kids are having fun and I am just doing what do everyday.😔
Every time you post a video for kids I will always say you are this generation's Bill Nye
When i saw the devil's toothpaste, all i could think about was  c h e e s e
*FYI* it's not going into outter space you bot, it's going Into the sky
He should take the flask and fill it with devil toothpaste and just see what happens
oh gosh why wasnt i there...
Why isn't this #1 on trending?
Dont know if anyone saw it but Some toothpaste stil went out under the flask.  Stil Some room for improvements
covid19 any %
we can never repay this guy for what he has done for the world.
What a guy!
Yessss!!!! New mark rober vid always looking forward to these ones and always worth the wait
13:01   u r welcome)
Algorythmus
HECK YEAH MARK! YOU DID IT! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!
How to make devils Toothpaste  5L of 50% hydrogen peroxide 350ml of dish soap And activate with 600g of 50% potassium lodide (KI) solution  And put any colour
If uncle Rober ain’t the worlds best uncle, I don’t know who is buckaroo.
Great video. The best I’ve seen in a long time
One moth of waiting was worthet
We need more people like Brody
YES
Americans be like: Ah yes the pressure was equal to 50 fully inflated footballs
The people that live near by thinking it's a nuke
😎👍✌
But why?
Mark you probably don't know this.. But the V side you do with your fingers  means something bad in England.. V for peace sign is the opposite way around..Just though I would point this out to you as I know the last thing you would want to do is offend anyone..   Love you videos great work.. I know you were going to give him that 4 wheeler..
Mark Rober Is Mr Krabs, and Toxic Stans Are Plankton
I'm pretty much speechless at this point... with how happy and amazed I was seeing this video I can only imagine what it would have been like being there. Thank you so much Mark, your generosity is amazing.
Videos like these restore my faith in humanity. Thanks for being great Mark!
…
some of those drone shots tho
9:52  The bird above: 👁👄👁
It’s been so long since you could do anything, you could tell me this is normal and I’d believe you at this point xD
I need that devils toothpaste recipe.  EDIT: it's just 50% h202
I hate Mr Beast
Aliens : invade Mark rober : elephant toothpaste them
So, Mark, has Gridley given you the key to the city yet?  Ooo!  To heck with that, you can probably get an endorsement deal for walnuts by now!
OMG
I love in this vid 1st the edits are better
That bucket got some height too! Crazy forces involved.
How awesome was this!!!
Mark: "Look at the house, we can't even see it" Me: "Well how are we gonna look at the house then?"
I wanna have a birthday like that
Much better than bill nye
Awesome video!
This whole project could've been funded by Nickelodeon back in the day
DAVIS YOUR A LEGEND
Mark, you are my Kevin Mcalister
I like the part when they scream
Wholesome!
wow!
Mark the first time he attempted this: Why do I hear boss music?
One Day he's gonna make an elephant's toothpaste world record that goes to the edge of the atmosphere
He’s been at it for so long
Legend.
Bruh
I love it whenever u make another video bc it’s fun to watch and I admire the hard work u put in them
Mark rober is the definition of cool uncle
Mark: Is a scientist  *Plays Lethamyr intro music*
Poggers
The next step is the same flask but with devils toothpaste
Lethamyrs intro music be rockin that montage tho
And so the saga is completed.. at least I think
You have so much talented skills. I’m happy for you 😊
Isn't this incredibly wistfully for the orbeas alone excluding the rest of the environmental and bugit costs?
OMG I watch all your videos!!!!!! Your skills and engineering and science explainations is so interesting to watch and learn about! You are such a great person! 💖💖💖💖💖
The editing, drone and slo-mo is absolutely insane also satisfying  Who agrees 👇
Wish he actually gave the pressure number instead of "50 times pushing on a fully inflated football"
Military should take notes
Wait Mark, you said that kid was in his last year? Last Lear to live? If so that’s sad
You are the nicest guy ever 🥰
Hello
:)
Never new mr beast was your friend
This was such an awesome gesture. This is something a kid will never forget .
@12:44 enchanté moi aussi 😂
12:38 "Hi youtube!" Meanwhile the girl transforms into satan himself.
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
I saw mr beast new vid, technoblade new vid, kairos time new vid(most people probably don’t know who he is) and I was like, yea I’m watching mark rober first
11:09  Bannnggeerrrr use this song more oftennnn
A sportsbook sponsored your video? That is a bit weird.... Mr. Beast should have sponsored it lol
So, while the elephant toothpaste is awesome, my favorite part of the video is your generosity. Responding the way you did to Brody's own generosity is legitimately heartwarming. If more people treated others like you and Brody treat others, this world would be a much better place.
this record keeps on growing and growing lol
This made have scary flashbacks (great video btw)
3208 n 925w  apartment three Delphi in
Question: could you please provide metric measurements? I get that you're American and all and I love your videos, and it's great that you provide numbers, but they make no sense to me, or to any of your non-American viewers, because they're not metric :)
Just imagine flying in a helicopter and seeing this
3 videos in last 1 month from Mark Robber. I am more than happy 😂
👍
👍
Not to mention it totally looked like the Apollo 11 command module, way cool. Not as cool as for why this video came to fruition.
Lol, Lethamyr's intro song 11:28
Great! Now Fill it with devils toothpaste
Wow I wish I had friends I have pool  in mymmar ;( plz come to my mymmar
Yessssss! The flask finally met its match
Mark, you are such an amazing and special human being! You have the biggest heart on the entire planet! You really just inspire me to be a better person/ uncle to my awesome nephew! Keep being you!
too nice for this world
Do you use bromine for the devils tooth paste?
When I heard about Brody using his make-a-wish to give another kid he didn't even know an ATV I started tearing up. Kids usually aren't that selfless, so it just goes to show that he's the kind of person who gets happiness from making others happy. The world always needs more people like that. Happy birthday, Brody! Don't let the challenges that life throws at you dull your compassion for others :)  Also, those drone shots are 👌👌👌
Please come to my house
can we take a moment of silence to the GoPros who perished in this experiment
Mark rober could win a war with devils toothpaste cannons
Elephant toothpaste demonstrating how many views this video will get
That was insane! Such a wholesome but epic video
pog
This is awsome I love your vids!
This is quite possibly one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen
I wanna get in the orbezes do bad
Why is everyone white
50X more dense then a football...so a rock?
This video just made me happy, not more words needed.
But what would happen if you do that... IN SPACE!!??
May I ask why it’s called that?
Awesome video
ESSE CARA É BALA DMS
he don’t miss
Mark Rober you are a genius
Amazing!
1st attempts of birthday:fail 2nd attempt :suscess
And that’s why you should buy me McDonald’s mom. 👁👄👁
This was awesome
Imagine if you put some sort of bowl on top and had a pool all around the bottom then u sat in that bowl and flew lol
LETS GO FLETCHERS BACK
yoooooo
Back then he was trying to be the best uncle, now not only is he the best uncle but also an amazing person.
it’s 3 days until my birthday
Cool
Toothpaste...
160000 pounds SHEESH
"pushing against a football" what??
hey if mark rober sees this i hope u know u used lethamyrs intro song in this vid lol
im not crying youre crying 😭
It actually sounded like in elephant when it shot out.
The comments section is like a farm for verified people
I just need those slo-mo of the toothpaste with relaxing music as a 8 hour YouTube video.
Mark Rober might be the best youtuber ever
Bad video
I knew it was Nurk...yeaaahhhhh
Hi mark <3
For all the cultured people of the world: 250feet is around 76meters
I bet that was Mr.Beast’s private jet
yes
All I can say is WOW!
Nice vid
Als deutscher kann mich sich das Fundament nicht anschauen. ^^
....Now clean that up.
My cat just tuned into a dog
congrats
is that as tall as a red wood tree?
Wow best video ever 😍😍😍
Yay! This was so fun to watch and great job Mark! It's awesome to see you helping the people you do with some fun during the hardest times of their young lives. 🖤 Keep it up!
I'm waiting for Dani Dev to comment on this video.
Is it just me or did I hear the lethamyr intro music
It's great to see how much fun the kids had but I have to wonder how many extra trees Mark needs to plant when he puts on an event like this. Fortunately Orbeez seem to be biodegradable and I might assume that was a consideration for Mark when deciding what to do for this party. That said, they still require resources to produce especially if he bought them in individual packs rather than a bulk lot direct from the manufacturer so it would be interesting to know what his considerations were in planning this... I'm not sure how many trees he had to plant to offset the private jet but you can't be too hard on him given his efforts to help the environment and promote awareness.
Life gave this kid some bitter  lemons and Mark turned-it  into Sweet sweet lemonade With a little help from science
I wish Mark was my dad
Why do you like 20 Second montages?
This is what being a YouTuber should be. So amazing
My dad has that exact same atv!
Mark, you are truly awesome! Thank you for choosing to use your ability, opportunity and means to give back to the kids and the rest of the world! We really appreciate you. 🌎❤
Beautifully done. 😀
Congrats dude
I hope edp doesn’t watch this
please please promise us you will never grow up
The amount of fun they had had me crying cuz i have sad life ;-;
Love what you do for the kids Mark.... I am getting enjoyment just watch you have fun while you do it....!!!!!
YouTube.
I just wanted to remind everyone  11:27
This one got me all emotional!!!
OSHA has entered the chat
im happy
does anyone else not like fletchers sister
I have been waiting for this for ages
You are amazing.
6:27 and 7:44 is pretty sus
13:01 so that's why it's called elephant toothpaste
omg i live like 30 mins away from gridley haha
did anybody else catch the +1 uncle point during the orbee pool clips?
Waited for this since the last one. Keep changing lives Mark, you're awesome.
8:41 is that elephant toothpaste or devils toothpaste recipe
Wait, you used lethamyrs intro!
is it me or is his voice a bit different in this video
you should put a go pro in the elephant toothpaste and see the perspective
It is severely understated how Mark Rober is the coolest uncle the internet could ever have
draft king plug caught me off guard, but ill start an acct if you do more of these. GG
Awesome Sauce!
*mark* : "one of life's most basic questions"  *also mark* : "exactly how high can elephant toothpaste be launched into space"
I always thought you were a smart guy with a big brain and an even bigger heart, but now you're just showing off.  Keep on showing off though...........you do it well.
Epic
Iam sorry to ask but why is it so many thumbs down
Elephant toothpaste is like..     When you watch the marshmallows in the microwave
Tell mrbeast that i like his videos and yours
I wish mark uploads more than once a month
I had coved
Mark Rober be like in 2033 "I'm a toothpaste hacker🤣"
Volcanos: (waving its arm)  See what they have to do to match even a percentage of our power! ?
so honored for this to happen on my birthday
The experiment is Americans after eating taco bell
This feels like a dream.
Go ultra-big (going home is not an option) - only the best from kid-at-heart engineer Mark Rober!
Incredible video! You’re the best!!
finally Mark u didnt pretend that u liked the experiment
Everyone: OOOOOOOO ........ The birds: .... The birds: AHHHHHHHHHHHH
6:27
ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE ROCKET!!!!!!
Now do it with devils toothpaste
Well that was awesome.
Everything in this video is polluting
What is the music at 2:32?
So underrated, we need this at 10 million views, I REPEAT, 10 million views!
I remember this
POG
That was just amazing!
the grinch climaxed 3 times that day
You just knew he was coming back for the elephants Toothpaste. JOB DONE!
Thanks for being such a great dude mark Rober
who didnt expect that he cant do the elephant tooth paste
Me 162:*whipping tears*
finally a video in which the presenter utilises child labour
That moment when you go through all the effort of making the world's tallest elephants toothpaste and there's not a single shot that's fully in frame 😂
👍
Can we just appreciate how Mark hired a lifeguard for the pool
Imagine what it would look like on an airplane flying by
It like nuke town in cod
This video made me so happy to watch, I got such a great sense of kindness and community from all of these people helping out expecting nothing in return but the smile of a boy who did the same thing. I couldn't stop smiling :D
Best uncle ever
Mark only uploads 12 vids per year but when he dose his vids are soooo great
Epicco!💯
It's the lethamyr intro song
How long did it take to clean I wonder?
11:10 leth intro?
You do such an amazing job rober love your work
The cone looks kind of like the Gemini command module. Speaking of which is it possible to make elephants/ devils toothpaste rockets?
That was INSAINE to watch. Well done :D
I hate the fact that you used a jet instead of the tesla only to shorten the time by a hour.... That is so bad for the climate. I am really disappointed by that
“I even harnessed some child labor” -Mark Rober, 9/4/2021
Imagine hunting in a forest and you look in the sky and see a giant tower of elephant toothpaste in the air
Incredible
LETS GOOOO MARK ROBER
Nice
Think of how many kids are interested in chemistry and science because of you Mark. That's so cool.
Turn it upside down and it turns into a rocket ship
Mark has the best Youtube content. Bar none.
Why is mark rober one of the most wholesome channels on YouTube?
not only is he the best scientist, but the best photographer
Mark just casually takes 4 kids in his car with no suspicion
Seeing how many people selflessly put forth the effort to make this a reality gives me hope for humanity.
Your awesome Mark!!!
Imagine if north Korean kids got to experience this.
Top 10 anime return moments: fletcher
New Upload! Yay!
Missing the outro
I love how you locally sourced the labor.
time pie
7 hours late
Mr. Rober you are an amazing person for doing this for him
Way to go mark your a awesome guy
Helo
0:44 the mark rober memes about him in 2090 doing something bizarre is starting to come true
What is your background music called? (1:43)
But HOW do you clean this?

You Just Gotta love Mark Rober
Thanks to draft kings and all the YouTube sponsors that make amazing videos possible!!

You are divine Mark
This is the best video on all of YouTube.

Pigs ! Think about the Environment

WoW
Wholesome.
Mark you crazy son of a gun you did it
talks about planting trees, eating vegan burgers and driving electric cars to save the environment, meanwhile flies a private jet.... cool party though
The fact he chose green for his new world record may looks like another radioactive plant exploded again lol 😂
The genius is back and better than ever and the epicness in this video is unreal
In the wacky times we live in. Mark Rober videos like this are needed.
no amount of wholesome can describe this video
You're everything the world needs

Huh I rewatch the last one yesterday and only few hours later he upload this Wow
I swear, Mark, you are like the nicest person I have ever seen, you barely know any of the people you do all this stuff for
Mark rober should take me to one of those
It has not even been a day and it’s already over 2 million views
I love ur videos it made my day, (bad day at work) bot ur so donw to earth i just love u <3 greets from germany
I assume the flask is just permanently going to be on that property forever. Some some type of glorious monument. 😆
Let’s be real, if mark wanted to go to space, he probably could
Those two people standing next to the volcano probably feared for their life when it exploded.
Heck yeah
The amount that mark does for other people is insane
You guys 😭  Such kindness from you mister beast and all the neighborhood as well as everyone that contributed 😭
With this slo mo I would've guessed mark was the director of the matrix
You Inspire me to be an engineer.
Always love your videos Mark!!!
Is that bugha?
That's like a fire came out from a hole
Cool 😀📱📱🇵🇭🤩👷🏾‍♂️👳🏻‍♂️👷🏾‍♂️👷🏾‍♂️👷🏾‍♂️👷🏾‍♂️👷🏾‍♂️
**Epik moment**
u can literally tell that Mark was screaming alot, due to how raspy his voice was by the end lol
Didn’t you do this already
Why not just a steel base?
No. I have faith in Jameis, Mark.
This guy is absolutely crazy
👍🏻 😊
So what happens to all those Orbeez and colored volcano lava❓ That's a lot of rubbish bins or is it just thrown into a river or ocean⁉️
And my friends wonder why I wanna meet you some day lmaooo
Sounds like you got a whole Minecraft village helping
This was just amazing. It brought back the feelings of what it was like to be a kid again. Keep doing your thing and I look forward to the next amazing moment you create.
Wow amazing! 😮😮😮
Mark is like everyone's cool uncle
i love this type of content
the channel ought to be something like : "how to OEP (Over Engineer Projects)"
Vejo uma pequena rivalidade a diante...
How did he clean all of that
Mark Rober you are the best! ❤️
Socks while surfin why
I love these vids :D
Yo mark can u adopt me please
“Child labor”
So that was the crackling i heard...
A MrBeast and a Mark Rober vid in the same day??? this is finna be lit
This is your best video yet! Simply Amazing 🔥👏
this is so cute
7:38 my dude became a dolphin-
Dude almost took a drone to the foot at 11:52
Love it, adults are just kids with knowledge and money 😎
Mark’s not going to stop until he puts toothpaste in the stratosphere.
Epic
When you see “her” after months
Why WOULDN'T you think it could lift a 1ton flask, just look at the massive area of the flask it's pushing against, ie, 1psi on 1" sq is 1lb. 1psi on 1000" sq is 1000lb.
You are still just a little boy inside and that is awesome! Carrying the energy into adulthood makes it sooo much more enjoyable!
anyone notice the tommyinnit shirt at 8:00
Child labour mvp
And with help from the town welder, the town pastry chef, the town rocket scientist, the town astronaut, the town Olympian, oh and also the town's small children
sorry I’m late
this is great because my birthday is tomorrow
I’ve never seen a more high quality video 👌amazing
How can you not love Mark Rober
wow
The town of Gridley must be so lucky.
The rural cauliflower mostly undress because purple hypothetically rescue excluding a mountainous radio. ludicrous, scary competitor
Oh
Wow
This is romance 1:59
This is the best video you have ever done!!!!!  Everything about this video just screams humanity!!!! I have hope for us once more!
Mark brought in the Lethamyr intro music lol
the second time
The yellow devil’s toothpaste looks like scrambled eggs
great video but Phat Gus was not mentioned at all
Is it me or is it that mark robber has got yt figured out
Did you fly the jet, Mark? (Are you a pilot?)
Bruh the kids he hired unionised and fought back lmao
Yo thats mappy
Thank you!
most of your videos restore my faith in humanity, apart from the porch pirates, and the wallet videos.
Imagine using this to clear rooms haha, what a mess!
props to this guy for his dedication. Seriously his perseverance is incredible.👏👏👏
13:48 50x the avg internal pressure of a fully inflated football (12.5psi), is 625psi.
Thanks to Brody for being an amazing person ❤️
Mark Rober is like the Mr Beast of science
Fletchers sister's pretty
*sniffle* I’m not crying, you’re crying!
im so happy to see that mark tries and tries again just for us :) so nice
It’s insane how one person can make a difference in the world with a little bit of help. Thank you mark Rober for giving these kids such a great time and for making my evening so much better
Pls plant trees
Oh my gosh Mark Rober you almost made me cry at the end that's so nice!
13:00 this is my kingdom coom
The drone sounds like it was screaming just like the kids
yes basic question about toothpaste
Way to go Mark!!!!!! I been following you trying to do this and it's great to see you did it!!!!!!!! Congratulations!!!!!!
Holy
id love to see delvenls tooth past in the 5 ton flusk lol
7:44 what are your thoughts?
Grass in the sky
This was amazing! When are you going to space with a rocket powered by elephant’s toothpaste ;)
You back
Finally! The best attempt
wow id like to see a big delvenls tooth past
The wistful catsup correlatively dare because menu wessely borrow besides a moaning margin. amazing, classy fender
Does Mark only know white people?
Leth made an appearance?? Wack.
It’s my birthday

Nice vid
He adding 1 million more looks the same
Who is Dale (the person who delivers bike to Brody)
Another masterpiece, Mark🙏🏻 however........ Non laminar flow... Maybe next year a THIRD ATTEMPT??
11:08  This song: *exists* Lethamyr fans: 🥲
Awesome
O other one nice
You always make amazing content mark. Great job
"How high can big hot green foam  launch into the sky?"
You are simply best. Ever. Really!
are we gonna ignore the fact that he spent so much money on this😀😅
Alvin Kamara for the win! Hes in me fantasy too
you made me cry... again. hopefully this will become a series of celebrating hard fought victories. Much love Mark, Fletcher, and Brody.
Well that was rude, you should have given one of the mannequins a umbrella.
*subtle* child labor joke
WOOOOOOOO
Demon Toothpaste geyser.  :D
They most def tried to get wit the homies sister
Hi xqc LLLLLLL
Mogus
The material music untypically approve because cod genotypically plug a a enchanted cirrus. dispensable, hungry rod
that day is like heaven
Alright let's do Technoblade
Can't wait till the elephant toothpaste goes to 1000 feet in the air next time
BIG BOTTLE
That one drone shot of the elephant toothpaste kind of looked like emeralds.
Me pertaining to know what he was talking about
Yes
Dudeeeeeeee Me: speechless
I'm happy to see you doing what you love most, experimenting and making people's days awesome!
Proud of you mark, I really am
I've been waiting for a while and it is now here
this is amazing
MY ANEM IS BRODY
9:45 IS THAT A FIRE ENGINE IN THE BACKROUND?
Mark Rober, you should definitely invest in your own amusement park.
THATS LIKE 200+ FEET IN THE AIR!!
The editor deserves some serious props
Seriously a great guy
Best video ever
12:44 does anyone else here the mysterious wispering? sounds like "ashante"
…what happened to the people next to the world recode toothpaste
If amazing was a person, Mark would be that person
When the orbeez pool came up the music just SCREAMED Lethemyr into my brain
This guy is the definition of quality over quantity
Is it possible to walk on orbeez
🚨Everyone's uncle uploaded🚨
is it just me or i didn’t see a single colored person?
Mark you never fail to make me smile
The best uncle someone could've asked
You know, maybe you should let it fly off like a rocket. MAKE AN ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE ROCKET!!
AWESOME job Mark!
if he did it once he can do it again
This is INSAAAANE-
I remember the first elephant toothpaste. I loved how it covered the car.
WOOOOOOOOO
please use the international metric units and do not use "feet" anymore, thanks! it's important that we all adapt to international standards
I wish my birthday was celebrated at least
Epic
POV: 9:57 You had a bean burrito and its coming out
This is wholesome
Now do the rainbow but biiiig scale
Could the devils tooth paste be used for military purposes?
Could you build the flask upside down  in order to get a devils toothpaste rocket
I don't know who edits your videos.. but the pool montage beginning at 7:20 was just epic.. I felt the fun.
4:27 is that real person?
7:29 casually flips off the camera for anyone from the UK lol
We all wish we were the kids in this video
The reaction of the elephant toothpaste was INSANE
amazing video as always!
The M1911, also known as the Colt 1911, or the Colt Government, is a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed, recoil-operated pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge.[7] The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, which was adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era.[7]  United States Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911
I love the fact that mark included fletcher from the first one.... so that way his special day way still special and he wouldn't feel like his was out shined because he was a part of it as well! He deserves a Nobel of some sort!
So this is what he's been working on for a year and a half
ok @MarkRober, but will it cannon?
imagine what would happen to a grain soil if you filled it with devil's toothpaste.
U
I shared how to make devils toothpaste in last years party video
2nd best video in your channel
If you filmed this in 4k you've got to upload that version, pleeeease.
Bless your mark Rober. Planet earth needs more of you. Thank you
i wonder what would happen if you were inside of that would it crush you? push you out or nothing
With enough money any world record can be broken
The moment we’ve all been waiting for.
that sister cute tho whats her snap
the drone flying shots were just next level, wow!
This guy is just amazing.
great video, Next up power a drag racer with nothing more than elephant toothpaste rocket engines. see how fast you can get it :)
Everything in this was epic
I guess water proof cell phones are a thing. Who knew.
love how mr beast said "no" for 25 million orbeez
I'm so happy for brody that he got a awesome birthday that it made me so happy that im glad to see you guys made him smile on his birthday i hope you Mr beast and the team that you guys worked with have a awesome day!
Epic!!!
ok someone go work at nasa and eventually tell us how devils toothpaste is made. also this a real cool thing you did for brody, as always. this is an example of how the world should be
Mark Rober is the hotest doctor
Ok
The opening was too big. It should have been a 1/4 of the size and would have gone farther for longer.
My FAVOURITE thing about these videos is how Mark becomes just as excited as the kids.
That one bird flying above the flask that turned into a NASA rocket: 0.o
Anyone else recognize the Lethamyr intro or is it just me
Not my idea of going green.
YES!  It DOES come back.  Be kind, everyone!
now turn it around and see how high the structure will go
How bad is this for the environment?
My birthday is on the 23rd on september it's pretty soon here!
Volcanos: you cant  make your own, it takes Thousands of years for a volcano to be forms Mark: haha tools go brrrr
Some of the fpv drone shots were extremely risky
Mark enjoy himself 😂 no cap 🧢 😂💔
Gets to fly in a private jet, is more excited about sparkling water in the limo :P
Hi
Dude Brody deserved every second of that party what an absolute legend. also congrats on that amazing new record!
Next time you should plug up the top and see how high the flask can go
Net worth of 5 million and a private jet ride is out of your budget ??   At least that lad and his friends had the time of their lives so fair play mark for giving back
What would you give for Mark to be your uncle?
POST MORE
the yellow up close looks like the surface of the sun
Imagine devil's toothpaste was just two times the ingredients of elephants toothpaste
Mark followed my advice to bolt the structure down with 3/4" anchor bolts.  (I made that comment after his previous attempt.  I'm a retired structural engineer.)
Wow mark that was awsome ! Me and my son love watching ur videos!
if all volcanos were like the the world would have ended by now
yay
Wholesome.
What a guy
I wish I was Mark's naghber😞
Bombs be like
I have Alvin on my fantasy football team
9
Thanks you Mr. Beast
Mark: "we're making the world's tallest elephant toothpaste" Me: "But don't you already have the reco-" Mark: "Did i stutter?"
I knew this video was coming
“so you want 26000 orbees.. thats seems excessive..” “ *so um actually* ”
who is dale
everything was cool. but dont patronize draft kings.
This guy has no idea how lucky he is can you imagine how much money he and his family must have to do all these things I mean come on most kids will never get to experience anything like this in their lives and look at this video knowing that
I swear I saw the glass break
Hi
Yo best day ever, mark rober, mr beast AND THE ODD1SOUT POSTED best day on YouTube ever
Wow
Mark. This is pure, human love. Thank you for being able to express it in your videos. Your amazing. Keep doing you bud.
That was the best.  Just the best.  Stay gold Brody!
Me “mom what’s that?” Mom “that’s a nuke”
Awesome vid
This felt like a Sony Bravia advert 😂
I'm actually from gridley lol
Holy crap. How much did all this cost? I'm just thinking about the   metal and the fabrication.
It just makes me happy when mark posts a new video cause he post vids with very large time gaps but his posts just get better and better
Drive a Tesla? No let’s fly a private yet. Nice carbon footprint mark 😒
Nobody: Gender reveal parties:
Finally
His town is like it’s from 1800
Is this ok for the environment?
haha
The mixed font eventually overflow because sponge fourthly watch without a natural shovel. uninterested, attractive sense
Wonder how that other kid must feel when you guys broke his record. Did you really think this through?
Id love Meatcanyon to do a video about this
Ah I was wondering if you would try again!
Wait a second you’re friends with Mr. beast
This is crazy
Same content andy
Also 13:09 The elephant toothpaste sounded like an elephant!
Me when Taco Bell! 12:53
@lethamyr 11:29
Somebody has too much money.
My favourite YouTube by far.
I think the sponsor has something to do with mark comparing the pressure in the flask to you pressing against a football......  It's the small things
Mark Rober and Mr. Beast, what a duo
Very whole-sum :)
I like when he does the toothpaste
Although Mark Rober doesn’t post often but when he does you know it’s gonna be epic
Whoever did the camera work on this needs to be named so we can see more of their work.
Dang already more than 2 million views in 6 hours.
you are cool
No one:  Mark: I wonder if I can get COLT 45 by Afroman into one of my  videos...
These drone shots looks terrific
The only human that has a smart brain that uses for fun
Just saying  Mark is the IRL Rick from rick and morty
Making me cry every time
love your content Mark!!
It was only a matter of time and a lot of engineering before that flask met its match. Nice one.
Thank you Mark !! You are changing lives, you even did not know, I am one of them. I was scared of Science, but now I like it. I plan to major on one of the sciences. Thank you Mark. Hope to meet you one day.!!!
WE DID IT BOYS!
It's been a long time coming. 👏
Did you decide to come back to this after doing it on MrBeasts channel
Mark is officially, the worlds best uncle.
That madlad
Holy moly, the foam pool party is so smooth with its transition
You should do this but take advantage of the massive force and build a rocket powered by the elephant/ devils toothpaste
wow. 😮
I can’t believe how insane this and how inspirational like can I do this for a job
The quantity of money this guy spend... Congrats Mark!!
Mark river always puts his hand behind his back
Ha
Editing quality 📈
80 tons cramping force, now THATS how an engineer takes revenge.
Ok I’ve seen some cool stuff but the view of the kids when it exploded was AMAZING
The speed from bottom to top doesn't look that fast sadly
so deserved
all of mark rober popular videos put into one, this video is truly a masterpiece
new vid nice
You should do one where it’s whole point is to blast off like a rocket
put a smaller nozzle on it!
for the metal holder did you "big robots pop footballs?"
13:10 that momment when you eat spicy burrito from the mexican emigrant
i think we can all agree that theres no true word to describe how incredible mark and his team is
"I even had child labor to do the work"  Everyone: what? Mark: nothing
This would be so cool having this as ur party
The giant Beaker actually sounded like an elephant, is that why it's called elephants toothpaste?
Madness 🙌🏻
Devils toothpast is probably h2o2 with potassium permanganate
The FPV drone shots were awesome
Sooooo goated.
Who else get goosebumps after watching the kids enjoy so much 🤑🤑🤑
My smile never stop on entire video.. love it what you do love de fricking content..
Kid: is in make a wish Mark: and I took that personally.
You are the best youtuber on planet earth
No matter in what you believe, this guy goes to the highest tier of heaven.
I vaguely remember Mark saying he's never use a private jet again...
i wasnt looking at the screen at 11:12 and thought a lethamyr video had qued XD
Under 24 hour's and all ready 2m +
Almost 20 mil
Get you first day pass here🎟
we have to fight agains the co2 emmisions, so we do that ... using private jets in situations they absolutely aren't needed?
MR BEAST AND MARK ROBER ARE FRIENDS?!?!?!? Actually it makes sense. The two are legends, of course they’d be buds.
again???? mark stop being smart
not the sister just taking advantage of the opportunity   "hey guys so we just landed" says to camera
Experiment works Mark: * screams in a years worth of science and engineering *
Was not expecting it to go DOUBLE THE HIGHT
11:27 Lethamyr Intro Anyone?
For those who want the pressure on the flasque in psi: it’s 675!!
No one:   AOT season 4 opening: 13:10
Mark: _gets the world record for BOTH devil toothpaste and elephant toothpaste_  Mark a few months later: *"Wanna see me do it again?"*
My heart omg
6:38 when he said this for a second I thought he was gonna break out the coco and them hoes
Love you mark
Dang
Mark, You are a wonderful human being... Thank you for all your videos.
did mrbeast wear a plain white t-shirt just to be sure not to advertise anything?
What can I Say Expect Your Welcome
Mark + Jimmy (Mr. Beast) = Peace and love
*"sorry the cameras werent rolling"*
Nice vid! Crazy that I’m actually learning about child labor now!
These vids are so great
Mark I’ve got another idea, put a big fire hose on the end of the flask and when it shoots out the hose will flick everywhere like when you let go of a too powerful hose
Literally my dream garden
Flask: so we meet again mark
So... what will happen to Brody?
I still can't stop laughing at 1:57 CHILD LABOR
CGI sorry :/
Mark really dose not know witch way the peace sign is lol
I like how Mark's personality is basically " Yeah I try my best to be the BEST uncle, and I also do a bit of YouTube"
Legit best channel on this platform
The question is. Can you launch sth up with that?
Am I the only one that heard mr beef
Just wonderful!
2:03 Was that a manly shriek of fear?
8:19 ouch that would've hurt
Thank you so much for this post it was very exiting for me since last years failed i wanted to see it again
Could you see it from space
Thanks. I’m crying
Mark is so wealthy
i hope whoever stole it goes through the same thing
BIGGER PLS
I just want that drone more than anything honstally.
Wait ,17 minutes has passed!
i guess the faster one is with kmno4 as a catalyst 🤔😂
Would love to see you build a Elephant or Devils Toothpaste powered rocket!
Now do an elephant's toothpaste powered rocket.
I like how he’s just as excited as the kids
Absoluely beautiful. Well done Mark, you beat the flask!
I don’t know if people noticed this but there were 2 mannequins that were for scale and you can see how far the toothpaste shot up
I think the catalyst is potassium permagent
Orbeez has a strong marketing team. Holy cow; between Mark, Mr. Beast, etc... They somehow wiggle their way into videos that have NOTHING to do with them.
Cat fecices
Next video: making a rocket with elephant tooth paste haha
This is the pinnacle of wholesome T-T
11:29 anyone else think of lethamyrs intro?
Yahoo
Hey Mark, where are the T-Shirts we were supposed to get for your Austism Awareness special? We were giving ours to our autistic nephew's mom, but we haven't heard anything 🤔
this is so wholesome 🥺 all the people who helped out are so kind
Investing in cryptocurrency is one of the best chance of making money 💸
We all waited for this 🔥 💯
Can we just get MrBeast to sponsor Mark Rober so he can do even more amazing things?
Happy 100th video mark
The nondescript february oppositely strap because riddle accordantly reach mid a tranquil dirt.  freezing, flashy jennifer
That Elephant Toothpaste should've been white so it could look mega c*m
It’s official, Mark’s gone mad with power
Even though Mark only makes a video once a month, he really brightens up my day!  Thanks Mark!
55% hydrogen peroxide, dish soap, food coloring and potassium iodide.
I Love the Toyota Tundra Just get engulfed in Devils Paste
This has to be in a museum but art and doesn’t move -7:00
Awesomeee
Welp time to fly a plane through it
I wonder how much money he had spent for this video to make us and everyone else in the video entertained.
Nice
Mark rober is so frikin cool
This Elephant Toothpaste video was by far the best you have ever done.
Im tired of those same soundtracks going in all his videos
11:10 Lethamyr intro!!!
I hate these videos. I hate being jealous.
I should really make an alarm that goes off thru out my entire house when Mark releases a video
I'm not crying, you're crying
Guys i think devils tooth paste probably is hydrogenperoxide with a high concentration of hydrogen
Mark rober, nice person, legendary scientist, youtuber, awesome
I think we need to see a video from mark where he goes to a haunted house, like the conjuring house or something with a median to see what he experiences
This is the stuff that just warms my heart
Now flip it upside down
This guy.... really deserves some recognition for his contribution to society. Making science cool and doing some real life-impacting things for kids.
I wonder what people in the distance who had no idea what was going on thought when they randomly saw that?
I bet that was way more fun than a doctors appointment
Kamara and Fornette are completely different players, Kamara taken in the first round and Fournette maybe taken in the 10th. Love your vids but don't think you know much about fantasy football.
This dude could actually make a volcano
Imagine having mrbeast as your friend
My brother That watches your videos got bit by a shark and he is on the news it was in Catalina
wishh i was theree
Love you mark the vids are epic and satisfying subbed to you
This was absolutely beautiful.
Boo saints go Bucks
Again?!?!?!? I mean I'm not complaining!
Could have done without all the needless filler about the kid but ok 😒🙄
I love this, this is truly inspiring. Not just what he did with the toothpaste but what he did for Brody
Mark has the most amazing sci and math videos ever made
Every single video is enjoyable!!! Always looking forward for your videos mark!! Greetings from Laredo, Texas!
I feel like this one focused more on the party and science not the fact it was a party
The cinematography in this video is insane!
But why?
Hmmmm I wonder who lended him the private jet? Me: Looks at MrBeast    Also Me: SUS
Yup
@Mark Rober why the Saints?! How dare you speak against the Buffalo Bills! 😄🤣
Tesla jets .... I'm sure Elon is all rdy on it XD
He was so excited he almost punched a kid whilst fist bumping haha
I know mr. beast
Outstanding!!!
Clean up is going to be fun
Thanks for all you do to make others lives better ,never stop.
Ever wonder what this would look like in zero gravity, or in space?
This is honestly the most wholesome video I’ve seen today.
Yea
2:45 that BGM! a great one, bring memories
Am I the only that thinks it is wrong to stick terminally ill patients in front of failed science experiments?
Thank you
Imagine having Mark as a dad🥺
12:46
David Dobrik gonna see this and one up it
Mark Rober is the definition of a great person
So who hated this????????
you know a party was a success, when your voice is completely hoarse
There are not enough thumbs-up to adequately and appropriately "like" this video. How could anyone UNlike it??? Mark, you are a beautiful human being and so is everyone in the community who chipped in for this one. Absolutely heart warming. Well done on the volcano. You won this time.
but life didnt give us lemons we gave our self lemons
You should not be nice to get something but be nice to be nice
If pokemon doesn't turn that place into a gym in Pokemon Go I'll be very dissapointed
That was some great drone piloting!
The song playing on the orbis footage is the song on the MKBHD intro
That sound is crazy that it makes
Markaplier and Mark a plier
At 1st I was going to go on a next video but he said it's not his 1st Time
wow
Wow another elepant toothpaste
This is that kind of content that that doesn’t make me hate YouTube
Every act of  kindness creates a small riple with no logical end, no matter what this ripple will always come back to you
Lets all work together to find/make the recipe for the Devil's Toothpaste a public thing.
Do it with slime in the mix
It's the little yelp at 4:19 for me 🤣🤣
Mark is the karma police
The secret ingredient is a tiny bit of child labor
Watch next year he does it on a rocket and makes it reach the moon...
Yessss
make this a yearly thing
nice slime volcano
i will click mark rober over any video
2 million views in 6 hours. Wow... ridiculous lol
Those footages tho...incredible!
You should do a crypto currency video… now that would be cool
I find it funny the way he calls Mr Beast so casually like he's an uncle they haven't called in a while
So much goodness in one video. Mark as always, thanks for the huge amount of time and effort you sink into bringing these projects to YouTube, as well as being the king of kids parties without it ever getting weird, a fine line in this day and age.  Honourable mention to the anonymous benefactor who provided an unforgettable private jet ride for the kids. What an incredible experience, and what a deserving kid.   It's great to see fun, science and engineering on a level everyone can understand. Wish you had a dozen clones. Have an awesome day/week/year. Peace all.
I literally thought I was watching the last video lmao
This is so wholesome
Lmao anyone else hear the lethamyr intro
Why is this not #1 on trending?
and where is reaction of hydrogen peroxide and potasuim permangante
You can’t beat faidherb square
Thanks that original elephant's toothpaste made me think about that alot
Friend: how crazy is Mark Rober     ME: yes
My faith in humanity is restored.
This is so awesome. I bet he was so happy the entire day.
WHY IS THIS SO WHOLESOME-
Yessir mark rober
Mark, thanks for letting us be a part of your day! CAL FIRE Butte County/Gridley Fire Department had a great time that day.
Watching these video's is just the best way to spend your night in the weekend. Please keep it on and keep making me smile :)
W vid
Why is fletcher's sister kinda bad?
the third coming, now with mrbeast
Isn't hydrogen peroxide really nasty stuff? That's a lot of it
Imagine his neighbors lol
13:48 "...50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully-inflated football." That's about as "layman's terms" you can get.
I think mark might just be the best human
The WAH when the flame came XD
the end made me cry
People in space like: 🤨
Are there states in America where using your phone whilst driving is legal then?
It went so high up the screen couldn’t even reach it
I love everything about this and it's awesome but can we talk about the perfect dolphin entry at 7:36?
Another great video, Uncle Mark👍
Okay I have one question… how long does it take to clean up everything done in this video?
whats with Americans and football
That was such a lovely thing to do.   I must say I'm intrigued to know what would halogen to the giant flask if you repeated it with devil's toothpaste!
imagine if mark rober was your uncle he would be the best
Yes, it did go all confetti on you (which you said it didn‘t look go or somethin) but hey it went really f-ing high
Yes we found Gavin another rdr2 mystery solved baby
Alternate Title,  "Throwing a Party Cooler than Fletcher's while Fletcher is here!"
10:00 Chese
Yes finally another one
Go saints!
ayyyyyyye
Cool.  But i hope everyone was vaccinated 👍🏻
where is captian disisulution?
You’re an amazing person
Nest you need to blast objects with it
That was probably the best b-day party ever. Well done Mark Rober
Knowing mark would be so fun ngl
One day, he’ll be making actual volcanoes…
Well done
foe the next one make an google street veiw car come and take photos so it can be in google maps
Ah yes the true peak of human kindness
4:26
That could send a rocket to the moon
Yooooooooooooooooo
.....
It’s been six hours and it’s already popular
1:52 Ragnar is that you?
Moment of silence to the people who have to clean this up
hay mark next year put a manican in one of them and watching it go flying
FS in chat for the flowers that got swallowed by the toothpaste
Hope you had fun finding your cameras again
W37
this is the most satisfying video ever ......
"uuuh, houston? do we have any satellite launches scheduled today?"
I wish I could go to that epic pool party but at the same time I’m glad im not because every other day afterwards would be inferior
16:19, I did it on the 1st-minute dumnass!
Nice In other news: 5 years later we're gonna have nuclear toothpaste
The elephant toothpaste saga is one of my favorites on youtube. What an awesome chapter 🔥
I don’t know about anyone else but I sure feel happier after watching that.  Nice job Mr. Rober.
Marks video's restore my faith in humanity
You know he is American when he uses the force of pushing against a football as a measurement.
Is the catalyst nitric acid?
The dude is an angel
Congrats
Gud
Loved the video, very wholesome
Planting tres but then take a flight with a privat jet. Come on. Just take the tesla next time.
give me 8 years
The fact that he has helped 2 make a wish kids make more than their dream come true just shows how amazing this guy is
My dude, you are the cool uncle that I strive to be.
you know that showing what that stuff does to a glove reveales what you're using as the devil's toothpaste oxidizer? ;)
the title used to be slime i think
Totally your best videos so far, it’s incredible how you do this all for the kids who truly deserve it that is an incredible way to use your fame help others and I am honored to be a supporter of the incredible work that you do
Those drone shots are INSANE.
Nice one.
Some engineers never grow up... rock on, Mr. Rober!
Mark. You're a nice guy, you know that? almost too nice.
He played Leths intro
F in chat for the cleaning crew
Getting major devinsupertramp vibes from these action montages.
O
Glad someone was inspired to use lethamyrs intro song
Epic
Do it again with a lid on top
THANK YOU.... I really enjoyed watching you make a day for that person..... YOUR GREAT.....
The engineering and budget of the project is amazing
Mark Rober is definitely the coolest YouTube Unlce
Americans: "with the pressure of pressing against 50 footballs". Don't be shy, tell us the psi
Can we get more of this in the world please.
Got to love hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate. Even the Germans used this in a cold rocket engines. Still gets hot though just not as hot as rockets typically do.
Mordecai and rigby: 9:42
Now he has to make a huge flask of devils toothpaste
I know Mr Beast lent you all his money for this
Today is my friend Birthday
i think we all know who the favourite uncle in their family is
That pour life guard
Bro you are literally everyone's dream uncle
Neat. So what was the pressure in the flask? Like in actual units :)
The camera work and editing was next level. Kudos to you, Brody, and all your crew!
A come to my town
As a Dad of two great boys, your video has me a bit misty...Thank You for this and everyone who helped out, you guys are true saints and the world needs so many more just like you. :)
This is prank to now gone too far it is an environment hazard, or an industrial accident or superfund site?
Mark thanks to you and everyone who made this happen and for brightening our world
Sir I'm afraid this amount of wholesomeness is illegal
Hi Brody :)
What would happen if they put all the chemicals inside and weld everything shut
I love how his videos are so wholesome
Mark robers voice is so calming
Mark is just building up his karma stat to the point where he could survive a ballistic missile
FINALLY SOMEONE DID IT
I would have loved to watch this video but it was ruined by background music. What is this sickness that has taken over YT. I'm out.
Mark Rober 2024!!! He could make an Elephant Toothpaste National Holiday.
Ever since the bottom exploded on his last attempt I've been waiting for him get revenge, and see the structure hold strong. Thanks for fulfilling my dream.
I got one of your sweat shirts for my birthday and it’s comfy
I don't think that a like button is enough for a video like this. Love button is needed.
I honestly though you changed the thumbmail and title
Mark Rober is the coolest guy I’ve never met
But with devils toothpaste
🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Who's cutting onions in here? Someone's definitely cutting onions, yep, someone's DEFINITELY CUTTING ONIONS
i made it early for me
But I’m brody
Can you please use a PSI analogy that Tom Brady and Patriot fans would understand too?
I knew it I know it it was a limbo🤣
14:55 *76,2m :)
Next up... Elephants toothpaste rocket
*B R U H*
Best Human being , YouTuber , content creator I have ever seen !!!!! I hope and wish you achieve all your goals like this one !!!❤️❤️
12:57 what you came for
This is why I’m always subbed to people like MrBeast and MarkRober
17 minutes of us sitting down, and enjoying the hard work rober put into these projects.
Love your vids, content, and motive to do things
What about the environmental crisis?
Let me guess, he has held on this secret for 2-3 years
I love Mark Rober. We need more people like him, he is too nice for the harsh human population
How did you clean it up afterwards?
It’s so cool that the whole town comes together to help out
these people that helped you seem so nice, what is this canada?
Just awesome!
No one: Absolutely no one :  Me:the boys in this vid are cute
hiiiiiii
2:33 April Showers isn't copyrighted? Why does mumbo continue to not use it then?
MrBeast needs to learn from Mark's orbeez hose
why is this not trending ??
Next year, CFD to model the optimum reaction vessel shape. Also, another 20% bigger.
Love it
We’re not gonna talk about how he let a kid drive an atv without a helmet
Thank you for the pollution
Imagine if you guys found out about anotjwr type of elephants toothpaste EVEN MORE deadly then the devils toothpaste!
To be honest if you are related to mark then you are really lucky
Congrats you are now a professional  at being a professional
the camerawork in this is the most amazing thing ever, and so is the rest of the video
Mark rober will be 1st person to do elephant toothpaste volcano on Mars !!
Fliegen ist cool aber nicht ökologisch ich hoffe der fliger ist mit strom !dann allse supie 😅
great stuff as always! fun and great message too, love the science bits!  Great job to everyone.
new edits r fire
amAzing footage
The one song I was looking for is No Cry from Fasion at 11:15
Absolutely amazing! I hope Brody had the time of his life
All of this effort for a 17 minute video that you KNOW he didn't make his money back on.
Yikes, Mark  You're voice was sounding rather hoarse
Nice matching helmet!
What do I need to make elephant toothpaste in a glass cup
Could you make some kind of full body vr or nerve gear I hope he sees this
You know your famous when your sponsored by the same app that sponsored the nfl
Where do you get the money for all this?
Is this bad for the environment at all? I have no idea, just curious in case I ever want to try it. 😂
Welp...now I gotta go watch a Lethamyr video. lolol
7:52 idk why but in that song i hear goofy goober
Happy DADA Day
Mark rober and a mrbeast post on the same day? U love to see it
Mark Rober for president
HOLY ^]€|€%{ THATS ALMOST TWICE AS TALL AS THE ORIGINAL GOJIRA!!!!!!!
That was absolutely amazing and by far the best and most touching video I’ve seen! You are awesome Mark!
FINALLY MARK ROBER POSTED SO I CAN FEEL SMART AGAIN
Can you drown in orbeez
Hi
I love you mark your are such an amazing person
Can you pls upload all the unused satisfying videos in one big video??
11:29 Lethamyr's Intro Music... Respect
10:02 *the sun*
I don’t know why I didn’t click this when it was released
Mrbeast video devil's toothpaste in a house
Also known as 3.4 atmospheres worth of pressure. That's insane.
Me when Technoblade uploads: oh cool I’ll watch that in a bit  Me when mark rober uploads: Yh sorry guys imma be leaving this football match I gtg watch mark rober
You uploaded!
Once you see Mark's formula for making a super popular video, you can't un-see it
Interesting.
This is absolutely beautiful.. this is why Mark Rober is awsome 😃
Also i hope that Brody is now ok.
Honestly shocked Draft Kings had the genius idea to do a sponsorship with someone as wholesome as Mark Rober
When life gives you TOOTHPASTE.....find new ways to destroy front/back yards of houses.
🙏
i approve of the child labour
Tell us the devils toothpaste otherwise we might aswell find lut
@NURKFPV Hi!!!!
Its all done for fun.. but i think the amount of pollution this would have done is massive
I think Mark’s master plan with his channel was just to find the best excuses to have awesome parties
12:55 My family when they hear a commotion outside
Cinematics are great 🤩
Rober in 50 years making another manhattan project: 👁👄👁
Every Mark Rover video is a gift.
The force you feel pushing against a fully inflated football should be a standard unit. XD
"50x the force of pushing against a fully inflated football."   how relatable.
Hi
Why do I watch Mark's videos when I'm cutting onions... This is awesome. You inspire me Mark!
Geez, his camera world has become a masterpiece
U know when I grow up I wanna be like you to my children unlike my parents rn
HOLLY CRAP! THAT OS BIGGER THAN GODZILLA!
Marks probably unintentionally on an FBIs most wanted list
If your looking for a Sienese nerd you know what person to go to
Watch him get arrested for child labor
Mark: all we need is a 20 second build montage.   Everyone who helped: Am I joke to you
What a Legend, Well done guys
Thank you for sharing
Imagine how many money did he pit into this video... i wish I was that kid i rarely get nothing...
Alvin Kamara is gonna be a beast this year.
This really warms my heart :)
7:44: Foam Daddy. Yessir
Can Mark plan my sweet 16 next year?
Brody be like when he saw the camera "hi YouTube!"
Why did I cry the entire video? Beautiful results of a beautiful day made for a beautiful reason.
U should’ve laid a mannequin on top on the structure then it would’ve gone flying
Very big. Nice!
Those onion cutting ninjas need to be stopped
Mark, no one would ever accuse you of "lack of effort"
The new head of superweapon development in the U.S
Mark rober can I be your favorite nephew?
How long did this video take? Because it was AMAZING.
Thank you, Mark, thank you for doing what you do and who you are, thank you!
Round of applause for Mark, he really made all those kid’s days. Truly one of the best examples of compassion.
You are an awesome human being! ❤️
Now you have to turn the flask upside down and find out how far you can launch a flask using devils toothpaste
1 thing people usually forget is that this stuff takes so long to plan all the way to this video
white people having fun bought with money
Why does this make me smile that much?
Mark, I dare you to build a rocket, with a complete nozzle and bell, and launch as high and fast as possible, rockets and elephant toothpaste, sounds perfect for you
You know things are about to get technical when you hear the xylophone music start playing
14:56 thanks to google i can put that into perspective. THIS THING IS A TALL AS A FALCON 9 OR AS A SUPERHEAVY BOOSTER! GG!
Devils toothpaste next year? For laughs
Oh yeah i forgot to mention that i really want to meet you in real life soon.
E
The pinnacle of internet wholesomeness
Odd1sout, mark rober, and MrBeast all in one day must be Christmas
idky but i have like a spidy sens wenever you post a elefant tooth past video
NEW VID? POG THIS IS EPIC
This makes me so happy :)
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness Mark!
rip camera
Even thought the private jet was really cool to do I'm sure it took longer then 12mins to get there after y'all made that decision to do it when you could have just kept driving and and made it there probably faster LMFAO
Wow. To see all of these people coming together is very heart warming. awesome people for awesome kids.
This is my childhood dream
he summoned the town’s blacksmith and carpenter like it’s skyrim or something
why am i not subbed lol
I just can't imagine the feeling of piloting a drone in VR and seeing a giant can of metal fly at you at incredible speed.
Pachyderm: "So how do they look?" Dentist: "Absolutely smashing!"
MOUNT VESUVIUS!
Yes!!!
Wish I could give more than one thumbs up!
America needn't have bothered spending all that time protesting unfair labor laws  Just send in the children contingent
absolute mad respect for mark for doing this not once, but twice for people who deserve it. MAD RESPECT
almost 20 mil congrats
You’re the greatest
LETH
11:10 like if u know lethmyr, and and also this is one of the best videos I've ever watched just because of the life lessons u can learn just by being selfless so thank you mark thank u so much.
I know Brody he’s in my school
Bro u need some diversity n your vids.
He is such a nice guy a really great video!
Lol gridley and their feral chickens!!
Mark Rober = Legend!
the music when they were in the orbee pool was lythamers intro from youtube.
now i know why it's called elephant toothpaste
This is too sweet yall gonna make me cry
:D
Mark i love your video's like allot also i really like this video bye.
I’VE BEEN LITERALLY WAITING 11 MONTHS FOR THE DEVILS TOOTHPASTE FORMULA!! It’s not like the devils toothpaste formula is the secret crabby patty formula or something 😂
GIVE US THE DEVILS TOOTHPASTE FORMULA
oh yeah i alr know this is gon have like 100m views it got 1.7m in less than 6 hrs
epic drone shots
elephant toothpaste v2
Any rocket league players here think of lethamyr?😂11:29
once again he did it
If possible, I would love to see this chemical reaction happen upsidedown. So a rocket with elephant or devil's toothpaste as the propellent.
CHILD LABOR 😭😂
my mum works for make a wish
Ok is devil's toothpaste some kind of piranha solution mixed with something?
Lethamyr intro song for the orbeez 😅
The super flask even sounded like an elephant
You are like the nicest person on planet earth
This video looks like it was a blast.   I'm wondering if mark rober owns a pair of sneakers. He's always on flip flops lol
This gives me faith in humanity.
Best one yet Mark
Mark Rober is the greatest human on earth FACT!!!
7:30 I think Mark ment to do it the other way
We need an explanation of this is cleaned I’m very intrigued
😮👍✨✨
video reminds me of how lonely i actually am  keep up the great work dude, <3
You should try devil's toothpaste in the giant flask with no one nearby.
russian sattellites going to mistake this for atomic bombs mushroom clouds
You are just, crazy! Awesome!
7:42 i dont like that the machenery chooting out white stuff is called foam daddy
One word: beautiful!!!
5hrs and 1.8 million views…. Dude you gotta be raking it in…. Then giving a lot of it away…. Your a nice dude Mark
Sheeeeeeeeeeesssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wonder if they rifled the outlet it would go even higher.
I like Fletcher and Brody
J
I’d be shocked if I was their neighbor
I so wish we had a lot more Mark Robers in this country, we'd be better in every way.
You did it you crazy son of a gun
Almost 20M BOYS
This looks like it basically functions like a nozzle from a rocket, and your propellant is elephant's toothpaste. That's freakin awesome.
Nice FPV shots!!!
Now that was the coolest video ever!
this is actually the insane. I can’t even make elephant toothpaste at all.
Highest Quality Content on Youtube
16:07 - Not always.... but it's nice when it does, for those who are fortunate enough.
Now can you go higher?
Let’s goooo!
why are you uploading videos at 2AM???
Are we all gonna ignore the major shot at Jameis Winston at the end😭😭
You should make one of these backwords an try to launch something into space
You're a beautiful human mark.
Ok but did you use flex tape?
I love watching your videos! You're a giant very smart kid! Appericiate it
Wow
Great show, but all those chemicals in the pool, the soil of the farm, the surrounding environment... at this day and age, it's just defeats the purpose of the whole endeavor.
Make this annual
12:50 thank me later.......
Great video brotha🙌🏽
What i would love to help you guys build some of this stuff
Why does it look edited
That's the same height as Yellowstone's Giant Geyser, the second or third tallest active geyser in the world. Depends on how much credit you give Iceland's Great Geysir.
2022: Its that time of year again TAKE COVER EVERYBODY
The real question is… Will Mr. Beast take the world record from Mark Rober?
I heard the lethamyr intro and i was shocked
You’re the kindest person I have ever seen
So team trees 2????!!!
That kid is so sweat it warms my heart!
Mark, is there a video of clearing the elephant toothpaste? Haha
Wow what a great story
Biggest bong rip ever
"50 times the force you feel pressing against a fully inflated football."  What kind of units is that?????? Not even freedom units, or bananas for scale, or anything else, just nonsense.   Pressure is measured in PSI, or Pascals, or any other actual unit. You can provide refference for the force, but I'm disappointed that you didn't bother to say the actual number with reasonable units as an engineer.
imagine that was when they took the picture for google maps and stuff
(10:06) looks like something that would be on a Best Buy tv 😂 And (13:12) looks like a volcano
Mark couldn't let go of mrbeast taking his record
Money does buy happiness! You just have to be wise on how, and sometimes on who to spend it on 👍🏼💯
Geez you were 32 miles away from me and I didn’t know
That was amazing of you!!
I love you and you’re work
Somebody needs to figure out the devils tooth paste formula
WAIT DID HE SAY GRIDLEY I LIVE LIKE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM THERE
9:55 forbidden cheese
I get so excited for another Mark Rober video!
Mark you should do a collab with people more often
Amazing video as always Mark, keep up the great work <3
Do something like this in the snow
Nickelodeon wishes that their green stuff was as cool as this.
thats amazing for the kid to get and atv for a random person
BRUH THOSE KIDS GO TO MY SCHOOL!!! 5:48
26 million...are you sure Mark sounds a lot for that pool
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
White people are so lucky
Step 0: make friends
You should re brand yourself as engineer and the best party planner (only has one option but it doesn't get any better) ; P
my favorite person hear is jeff
The original video that got hooked on mark rober was the sand hot tube it was so intriguing that with this simple science that someone I had know idea who was so smart but had made these interesting videos that made me like science was on YouTube love the videos mark but he is doing a wonderful thing on here helping these kids giving them the chance to experience something they would likely not have had otherwise.
i love these vids
Im not crying... you are
Next video. Elephant toothpaste on mars
I miss Phat Gus.
Mark my cousin has a brain tumour can U throw him a party after nz's lock down
HELLLLLO
SAFETY GLASSES AND CLOSED TOE SHOES MARK the universe needs you for a loooong time.
now pur a rocket nozzle at the top of it to make it go higher, and also turn it upside down to make a rocket
Why was it called slime but changed to elephant toothpaste?
NEW VID!!! YES!!!!!
This vid makes me terribly fun  even i wasn’t there
Mark can you do a video/segment on  Can you contain elephant toothpaste
They got Dale himself?!
amazing
I can only wish for something even as half as great as this to happen during my childhood
David Dobrik rn: 😐
Slo mo drone shots ftw! This is so cool, how does it clean up? I really want to make some but I'm not sure what I'm in for :)
Amazing vid, great content. 😊
CHILD LABOR
Well that mark is definitely going to be hard to break. Thank you and your crew for filming this so we can also enjoy it with you 😉
Top notch story and experiment.
I love the science, but the main reason i follow is because of how genuine of a person you are.  If you ever need help with something like this in central texas ill be there
Snwtje
I wonder if you could’ve put a seal with a small hole on the top of the flask to build a little more pressure before it shots out the top
I enjoyed the parts where the kids were having fun more than the science, all that treatment and he gets something he always wanted
mark rober is one of my favorite youtubers
Try the flask with devils toothpaste
yo me beast and mark rober post in one day??😱
rip that lawn.
Did anyone else recognize some of the music from lethamyr's intro?
I'm just wondering that if instead of making the flask extremely heavy, couldn't you have just drilled down deep and anchored it to the earth and maybe saved a lot of expense?  Either way, love the work and what a great video. Hit me in the feels.
I bet this kid would brag about having the best party ever
Comment
Omg I thought the kid was really going to go grab the camera I almost freaked out lol.
mr beast is now sad
Whan at sequel!
Finally
I know you have the algorithm by the balls and don't want to mess with the formula... But I'd really love at least a Mark Rober 2 channel that turned a 20 second build montage into a 20 minute video. 🤔 You really skim past some of the most amazing parts, although I understand they don't necessarily appeal to as wide an audience.
Out of my budget? Your an actual millionaire....
Every time I watch a video from Mark, it exudes personality that I strive to have.
❤️❤️❤️
I just did some homework where I had to watch a TED Talk and answer some questions about it an I chose your Super Mario Effect TED talk! I have watched it before and enjoyed it so I decided to do it about that TED Talk!
Well done Rober!!!!
1.6m views in 5 hours. Keep it going people. Let's make it 100m in 24 hours!
MrBeast just got roasted 3:15😆😆😆
How much money did u spend and how did you do this when coconut virus spread...
I feel bad for the kid from last year who had his record beat in 1 year
There is no limit on the amount of respect you deserve for the admirable human being you are!
💥
11:21 if anyone knows who lethamyr is, you’ll know this song lol
Nobody  The experiment’s in American’s school films but too big:
👍👍👍👍👍
The key to a Mark Rober video is a 20 second building montage. Change my mind.
this was such an amazing video
You used child labour ummmm ok
Fletchers sister a baddie
Unfortunately a party like this would probably cause me immense stress
I need a count of marks dad points
What would happen if you welded the top shut
This made me think a little bit about Leth
i am glad that mark didnt tell people on how to make the devil toothpaste
Next year needs to be for techno
Elefant toothpaste caused this  Let that sink in
Whats the filter at 7:34 called?
Mr beast should coppt this video but he buys everything so it can be really biggg
Did anyone realize that the Lethamyr Intro song was in here?
He will make that money back in no time lol
"So I talked to my friend Mr beast, and thought what to do about this situation" lmao heros
Did any one get hurt doing this
As a chemist I really want to know what's in the devil toothpaste...or if there's actually not even a different substance ;-)
3:55         WHO NEED THIS EXPOSE  THE MONTAGE  IS WORST THAN 2013 INTRO XD
Fletcher is epic let Fletcher see this
Imagine this in an elephants mouth
anyone know the song used @13:10?
Love from Texas. Nice Experiment Mark B. Rober 😍
“50x the pressure of a football” lol Americans will use anything other than standard measurements, what was the psi? XD
I love how your voice was just GONE by the time everything was over
Just casually dropping that Nurk was flying FPV as though he isn't the biggest celebrity in the bunch.  :)
please don't let nickelodeon see this
It should  be a 5 minute  video
How did you dispose of the elaphants toothpaste I love your videos but I have always wonder
everyone featured in this video is white 🤔
Mark, will you be my uncle? Please??
3:11  This really puts into perspective how high the record now stands.
Congrats on defeating elephant toothpaste and yourself!
okay now reverse make a big rocket from elephants tooth paste
I am really happy to see fletcher is still doing well!
I wish i had the time, people, and patience to do this
yay!
it's taller than the mona lisa
Wow this video just gets better and better. But how do you get rid of the devils tooth paste?
16:10 that’s why I love mark ❤️
Just when you think everything is wrong in this world, Mark shows us another side 😊
How does mark keep out doing himself
What happened with all the orbees and the mega tube after this video?
Brought to you by: Child Labour
dude I love it when you do these videos
The fact that Mark is just as excited as the kids warms my heart
WHOA.
2022
5hour commet
I think that devils toothpaste has bromine
Mark admit you're an addict
Yes, Mark, yes…but Elon Musk has just tweeted that he has decided to enter the elephant’s toothpaste arena…
The message at the end is the best ❤️
Niiiiice
I love how your videos are both educational and wholesome!
congrats
It's not a surprise party without child labour
13:00 me when you when you mom when you're mom when me you when mom when me you mom are you when me when me you you're mom when
How cool would it would be to have mark as your uncle
From NASA engineer to heart warming science guy
What a neighbourhood
I always wanted you to do that again!😁
Your actually amazing!
How can someone be so impossible to hate like bro is a perfect member of society 💀
I feel soooooo   jealous oh are you
Who else just want mark Rober to be Ur adopted dad
12:52 When your crush smiles at you & bites her lip...
Yes
i love your videos
1:15 in and I’m starting to cry already
Best cinematography 💯
What?! the last toothpaste experiment was a year ago?! if feels like only a few months ago.
Props to Mark and everyone who had a share in making this all possible. I came to enjoy the science, but instead am in awe at the generosity of strangers. Thank you!
Now do it with devil’s toothpaste for a more explosive result
The round soprano clinically rush because fountain lovely attract towards a adamant switch. quick, large string
one of these videos made me complete an assignment! thanks!
Thank you for what you do @markrober! Not only entertaining, but inspiring and uplifting community driven stories.
This was nice and fun to watch
That's  be just be   I have an Idea 💡 for u

Imagine spending the best day of your life with Mark Rober
The FRAME RATE on that drone camera is amazing

This was such a beautiful story!
Cool 😎

I love how he just does nit say subscrive or else something will happen i like that he lets us consider
Wow, 1.6 mill views in one day, is that a Guiness record?

NorCal is the best part of Cali, by far the best people
What a heart warming video. Mark you really are a hero ❤️
Who cleaned the foam?
Love the content @MarkRober produces but even more so when it's for a great cause. You made some worthy recipients very happy bunnies. Much kudos, sir!!
Pog
You should launch things with devils toothpaste  with that amount of pressure 😂
Make devils toothpastes rockets try to lunch to space I know you can do it
Mr beast wearing a teamtrees hoodie? foreshadowing? let’s gooo
I thought  that was a real person when they did the rainbow one
I love your vid‘s
12:50 is what u came here for
I feel very happy for him and also sad for myself cuz i know i'll never experience something like this
Lol
Mark should just become a kids birthday planner
Great fun, great reason, great learning & great service to others. Thank you.
Help mat pat be on jeopardy
The reaction was kinda cold for what all they done ngl
Definition of marks channel: *BIGGER*
I'm actually curious, did the people get payed to do this?...
fletchers sister fine
yay a new video!
you social people are weird... but hey, hun for you, not dissing that.
LETS GOOO, WE WILL KEEP THESE RECORDS MARK!
Algorithm
If only everyone was as nice as Brody, imagine how amazing the world would be.
I love the lethamyr music
I really loved all of this video (so far, I am halfway through), but seeing the climate crisis is still important I don't think the private Jet was necessary ^^"
You are an amazing human Mark.  Made that kids life.
I said it twice now and im gonna say it again: You are insane.
love you vids
at 13:01 the drone even made it sound like an elephant kind of lol
WHOAAAA
Mark Rober for World President!
Elephant Toothpaste: *Elephant Noise* Me: "No wonder they call it elephant toothpaste"
Awesome job Mark and team! Made his day/life... he will remember this forever! Hats off.....
The guy from last year looked so sad when his record was broken
Great vid Rober
why do I feel like ive seen this before?
Hey, not for nothing, bunch of disabled Veterans, Veterans up in Rochester NY sure could use a pick me up. ❤️
Bro what’s ila insta,she’s Lowkey looks like a vibe
12:38 hey dude, hope you're having a fantastic day!
Anyone else notice Lethamyr’s intro song?
Gridley California?
YOU. ARE. A. MAD. LAD.
What a lovely gesture who's giving it thumbs down 🤦‍♂️
This is so wholesome my brain is sure there's something dark going on behind the scenes
leve a like if you like the video
It’s hard to not love Brody’s story  I hope he stays healthy in the future
Oh gosh
I would pay any amount of money to see you make something for the new Jackass movie
Mr Beast giving the boy that 4 wheeler was cooler than him giving away millions of dollars
11:08, that’s Lethamyr’s intro music!
I can pretty much guarantee that the people at Guinness book Start smiling when they hear Mark Rober is calling.
Deez
AWESOME!!!
Heads up Nurk FPV!
This hole video is just him taking away Fletcher's world record
shrek splooge
I love you Sir you’re my role model
Awesome job. I'm a fan for life.
Can U pls translate it the meter pls
You know what is the best? The joy and amazement you can feel too while watching! Bless the mirror neurons!
Absolute goat
o7 you legend
Dope
this guy is f*cking insane
50 times the pressure of a football is about 650 psi or 44 bar! when you know the pressure in a "actuall" term then you star to get how much pressure that is! that's over 20 times the pressure of a car tire (more like 25 alot of the time)
Hey remember when this channel was about science...
Nice video!
Lol you should tell us when you make the money back form this vid
Dude some of these shots are absolutely insane
This is cool!
Anyone else who would just love to be one of marks kid
This was supposed to be a walnut tour and now we have another World record
me skips to end WOOOOOO THAS COOL others ohh so thats how its made
Fletcher look like me for a second
Mark you are the single best nasa engineer on YouTube! The sheer effort and time that went into this is insane and all the people who helped realized that and they in turn became absolute legends. Have a superb day!
16:09!
Ayo lethamyr intro
how did the manking not cach fier?
Always the best day of the week when mark uploads
Lightens my heart with people generosity and for Brody to give his make a wish gift to another kid who had his stolen. He deserved his present at the end.  Shows that if you give then just that is enough but it could come back when you don't expect and reward you 10 fold. Love this vid
The yellow looks like scrambled eggs
Sheesh
Who ever your editor is, s/he did a amazing job
it legit made an elephant sound when it went off
Weirdly he reminds me of impulse
oh so that's how dinosaurs went extinct
Kids, never get into a car with a stranger ... accept if it's Mark Rober.
Wait, did they seriously hire a pool guard…??
Mark is like the cool dad of YouTube
simply put that was cool
I remember the red one. 😆. If only.... lol. And here we are. Never give up.
That was sooo cool!!! Loved it
What a g
Yay congratulations
You are the most wholesome person I have seen
Ratio???
World's 1st manmade microburst?
Nobody:  Mark in literally every video: "So about a year ago..."
Hi
He has did again YES
Me watching Brody riding his new quad bike:  You get what you F**king deserve
of course mark rober has a telsa and mr beast doesnt
Who in the underworld steals anything, let alone a wish from a Make a Wish patient?!?!  That is probably one of the all time lowest things I’ve ever heard a human being do that wasn’t on a country or world scale.
ugh my mouth is always tired after watching these videos🙄 thanks a lot for making me smile for 17 minutes straight mark
what a legend, giving your wish away for another.   this kid deserves all of this .
Marks neighbours are like. Here we go again
Mark is ripped
Mark is maybe the only youtuber who has original content now a days
Thanks for using my song „On My Way“ ! ❤️
As always, nicely done mark. Nicely done.
Mark - You have some amazing people donating their time, effort and money to great causes. Hats off to them and thank you for their and your contributions to making these videos.
mark is like that cool uncle that dosent molest you
8:18 is no one gonna say anything about that belly flop
duuuuude we need the devils toothpaste explotion on a 4k video
This is honestly mind blowing. Mark is a genius, managing to entertain and educate us at the same time, and doing it all for a fantastic cause
What did the people that helped get?
He did it in my home town 😁
Где то загрустил бедный мамикс)))))))
S
This is such a wholesome vid. Awesome job!
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO YOU EVER MADE
Everyone on youtube: Hmm, I am bored...  Mark Rober: There Uploaded!  Everyone on youtube: Best content on youtube!
That footage from the drone is just insane!
Not only is he a legend, *HE’S FRIENDS WITH MR.BEAST*
Video is awesome
Legend. This video got all up in my feels.
"That's why I dont give out the formula" 10 seconds on google told me it's just equal parts hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide. Oh and soap 🤷‍♂️
E P I C
The amount of nice and absolute saintness for those who have suffered in an immeasurable amount
no one cares about the boy with canser
that drone trying to keep up with the eruption has me rolling, its just like...mmmmmmmmm- VRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This might be the best overall video on YouTube
This looks so cgi
I love how he always does these things for a kids party
Brains and money
Im not crying... you are crying... okay I might be crying too... like.. a lot...
This "devil's toothpaste" stuff looks hecka scary. 😂
The most wholesome heartwarming videos on the internet
wow i wish that was my birthday
Noo the plants
While we were in quarantine he as lost his sanity
Mark deserves a reward from YouTube for solely being one of the most generous and heartfelt youtubers on their platform
Mrbeast is a nice guy
HE GETS IT DONE AGAIN
"It always come back" I never got anything for picking up a wrapper in 1st grade..
Mark rober is the one who made me fall in love with science and math. Thank you mark for everything
Only mark rober could make a party for kids without it's wierd
Yes
America… making completely useless junk for fun.
Thanks for this video! My birthday is coming September 9th! wish you could send me something like a kiwi co crate or something, Thanks! (:
So you mean you built an Elephant Volcano Heavy enough to weigh as much as an average Adult Elephant. 🐘🐘🐘. 5 tons? Sheesh
What an amazing episode you have here.  Thank you for helping to restore my faith in humanity.
For once can't you do something beneficial for mankind instead of just polluting the environment for entertainment?.
Awsome bro
No wonder why the tusks of elephants are so white :P
The best thing about this video is mark has done advertising at the end
Most of the time when I watch videos like this I get easily jealous but for once I’m just full on happy
Love videos like these you're making the world better
What's Fletcher's sister's @
1.5M VIEWS IN FIVE HOURS?!?!
You should give him a Emmy award lol, this stuff belongs in places not just on the internet.
That flask is weighed down with a Force weight  moor than my house
This is WILD, every video goes above and beyond the last
I'm not crying you're crying
me when your mom
uwu
mark really has all the means to be a super villain….
Mark is a literal saint
“My friend MrBeast” lol
I really want to jump into the giant elephant toothpaste stack
Mark I know you referenced the pressure in relation to a football but what was the pressure the need in me wants to know. Either in psi or BAR can you say what the pressure was? Why not use the devils toothpaste instead of elephant toothpaste?
“With my friend Mrbeast”  *that’s the first time mark has sounded like a celebrity*
Now do the big blast with devil’s toothpaste
Is the EXTREME elephant toothpaste a mix of hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate ???
His fame is totally well deserved
Amazing! You earned a new subscriber!
Thousand thumbs up!
"Angel's don't exist"   Are you sure about that?:
i loove this channael
I just want to take a moment to thank you for making the lives of those around so truly special and memorable.
Sorry mark but the way that devils toothpaste had been found
Awesome video. I'm happy to see fletcher doing happy and well!
Lovely
INSANE!!!!!!!!!
Seriously...you should build the next Lunar Lander for NASA!! 😁 Awesome 😎  L O L
oh boy
13:01 me when- your mom when I - when your mom- when I
If this is have he gives other people a party… i would live to see have his son’s party is😲
I watched  your elephant and Devil's toothpaste experiment Test videos
Aren't you taking away the world record from the previous kid though?
you are amzing person, showing love to people that you have never met.
Can we all appreciate the fact that Mark never disappointed us with his content  👍
Mark, your a pretty amazing guy. Thanks for focusing on kids and making science fun!
wait it's september
could you make a cloud with it, one that could rain eventually?
Love the FPV shot 7:20.
this is very satisfying
I love this video cuz it was made on this day my birthday
He said what’s in The devils toothpaste at 8:45 in the video
i wish you were my school teacher...
Those kids will be so tired by the end of that day lol As a mother, I watch this and it makes me think “those kids all need a really big home cooked dinner and and early night sleep after that or they’ll get grumpy”
how does he dispose of all of this stuff, the orbees and the devil's toothpaste?
mr beast and his hat LOL
Yay
fard
Broo, Brody used his wish to get someone else's atv back. The kidness is off the charts, congrats Brody!
Mark Rober is literally the master of youtube. Incredibly smart and such a great guy.
Dayum bro
Mans used lethymyrs intro music
Your next video should be: I created the worlds best mini volcano
that grass is crying rn
Why is mrbeast just sitting in an empty room
Its so wholesome that everyone in town came together to help with the party.
Lesson of the day : don't underestimate toothpaste kids
At this point, when I think of elephant toothpaste, I think of Mark Rober.
2050: The largest devils toothpaste in the moon
i love u mark
That camera work needs a standing ovation.
"Sir... You want HOW MUCH hydrogen peroxyde?" "Trust me, i'm an engineer... And that kid's very cool"
what a nice guy mark
Can we just talk about the editing though??
Lethamyr ?
hi
Always fun to see a mark rober video
Mark Rober something u needed to do later is go to the testing site and do the same thing but with the “devil toothpaste”! With how quick it activates I wonder how high that can go.
Well done,, you sure do like your science physics stuff
Can you do how to cheat games
You can see how tired Mark was in the hospital
gotta try that with devils toothpaste lol
I love you for what you are doing!
I wish the fire department would let us use one of their fire trucks whenever we had any event going but I guess that's just a perk of being a white person city employees will never cooperate with us this way you guys are lucky to have a silver spoon mouth
btw im up for adopttion
Is this the end of a great saga
What if you used devil toothpaste to make a rocket
Mark Rober and technoblade?!?!?
This can be the best moments a child can wish for
Absolutely brilliant, I love it.
It looks like money when it exploded
Manual do mundo: dont beats his record.  Mark Rober: fine i Will do it miself
quest to be the best uncle COMPLETED.
Early
This crazy cus brody live in my town💀
A Mr Beast video and a Mark Rober video all in 1 day. What is my luck?
The world would be a better place if there were more Marks in it.
What a lovely bunch of people
the fact this happened on my baby sisters birthday party makes me feel as if im where this was filmed, and i genuinely forgot about my surrondings for a minute.
Loving the faidherbe square music!
Congrats on the new record and as always it's great and wholesome content! May karma shine on you 10x when it comes back around!
Mark is the cool uncle u only see once a year no cap
Had to take that Draft kings money for this one lol.
Could you flex on us any harder Mr. Rober?
Mark Rober THE BEST
The fact that this master piece took like a month to do and we only see it in 17minutes that's crazy to mee
What would elephants toothpaste looking like, if the reaction happened in space?
mark does like 5 vidoes in 1: i rode a priverTE JET AND INTO A LIMO BROKE A WORLD RECORD ORTHER COOL THING
ye
We are so proud of you
LESSS GOOOOOO BOOOOOOYYYYYY
How will he get rid of the orbeez?
Mark rober = gets famous      His videos : every month
what if you actually tried to get to take off like a rocket, capping the top and seeing how high you blast the funnel
it blows my mind that this guy is a nasa scientist
Love how you make engineering cool!
Thank you for making a difference.
Okay ok this will probably never happen but I would soooo wants birthday like this like ahhh that would be so fun ir at least u would want to be there
American football or a normal one
8:50 u said u wouldn't release the formula.
I aspire to be like you
MARK ROBER YOUR AWESOME

fletcher has a attractive sister
My plane pilot: what is mark doing or and alien Me: sees engine next to me fail Everyone else: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Me: it only one engine
I've seen better.        dont get mad ;P
AMERICA! Where an entire town can come together...for a funny "little" experiment.
when you are watching markrober at 7 in the morning and YES theres a nee video  😃😃😃😃😃😃
Love it
He used lethamrys intro music
Bruh I was thinking about this like a week ago
With all of that money mr beast still didn't buy himslef a iphon 11 pro max XD
now do it again but plated with adamantium and 50x bigger
See, THIS is why I wanna be like Mark Rober
Peak wholesomeness.
when you miss one day of school:
I'm tryna get Ilas snap so I can tap that
Maybe slo mo guys and mark rober should collab?
12:54 kids happy  Mark just celebrating that it worked
Rocket rocket I want to see a rocket fuel by that amount of devils toothpaste
What woul‘d happen if you would make the whole the toothpaste came out smaller?
Gold star for video editor and the persons who record this daaam
Somehow it always comes back.  Yes sir, words to live by.  Awesome video!
This was heartwarming 🥰
so epic
Broody is so generous. He gave away a SUV to somebody he hadn't even known before while giving up his own wish. I suppose he got the same SUV but also one awesome of a party.
One word: SHEEEEEEEEEESH
Beautiful =)
Hey Mark I got this project to make a car with the power of a balloon but don't have any idea how to make it a. Any tips?
Mark looks so much like david dobrick if you agreeplease like
why did he play teh lethamyr intro
Why are you assuming, that I would press hard against an inflated football? Why not just admit, that you do not know what the pressure was?
Terrible feeling of déjà vu.
Here he is himself it’s the elephant toothpaste king
Nice
"not blasting off like a rocket", toothpaste rocket confirmed boys 'n girls!! ;)
Hey mark your probably not going to read this but I’m quite young and you have inspired me to try and work for NASA just saying thank you and if you read this can you give me an idea of were to start
I had a feeling that Mark wont stop making bigger elephant's toothpaste volcano 🤣🤣🤣
I’m in tears, makes me so happy to see a community come together to give back to a really awesome kid❤️!
Thats a lot of toothpaste
"Whats next? worlds fastest elephant toothpaste?"
fifty times fully inflated football? Have you rear SI system?
Interesting 🤤
Am I the only one who realised this was his 100th video?
Salute to everyone who was a part of this! It's just unbelievably amazing what you guys did for this kiddo.He absolutely deserves it!LOVE IT!❤️❤️❤️ Also 20 million here we come!
Mark answers questions i never knew i had
One of the only positive youtubers that never clickbaits
You rock.  Thank you for sharing.
Broody will forever be my inspiration in life
This is a certified explosive by the FAA.
This is the most wholesome video I've watched so far this year
YESSSSSSSSS
12:49
HE DID IT AGAIN
I really needed to see this today. Thank you Mark for all you do
Nerk and your editor deserve a million dollar raise. Incredible drone work and video editing. 👏🏼👏🏼

I LOVE YOUR WORK. May the world be a better place with you in it. 💞

When I see a mark rober video I watch a mark rober video

When life give you a mark rober you do this:

How do you clean it up
Mark definitely enjoyed this more than anyone else
:00 SO AMAZING
I can already tell Mark Rober is gonna have is own foundation one day
That's the song at the 6:00 mark?
i could watch this for hours, instead mark rober insert a 17 minute youtube video - wowsers! love you love the project and the spirit
16:35 Who wouldn’t like Kamala over Fournette
Faith in humanity restored once again
And we have lift off
Geez
We love seeing child labor harnessed 😈
Another video it seems
Mark is still a child I swear.
The blumin drone could’ve been heard from miles away
Props to the cleaner
8min into this video and I still cant get over the fact that he used his one wish to give a kid he never met, that had their atv stolen, a new one.....
You are an incredible person, and you seem to attract incredible people to you.  Your videos are not just entertaining, they are inspiring.
Brody is an absolute madlad
4:18 its funny the way that the guy screamed
It reached the hight of one Colossal Titan
sus
Rober is definitely one of the most wholesome YouTubers ever.
Mark i have a question
it literally sounds like an elephant
Just casually calls Mr Beast
Get it back from mr beast
the devil toothpaste recipe is to use >60% hydrogen peroxide, soap, food, couloring, and concentrated potassium iodide
wait what! u know mr beast
Nurk is and will always be the best fpv pilot
Hello mark Rober, I'm an big fan of your work, been watching you for years, and watch you with my dad, hope you have a fun time picking up all the mess, if you're picking it up
Teenager's pores be like:
Yoo an upload :)
Best video ever
Well done
pov mark dosents post for ages but comes out with a banner
This is Oddly satisfying
+1 Uncle points
Men of culture the algorithm has brought us together once more!
DADDY ROBER
That is so cool I hope I could try to make animal  toothpaste  for my science  fair
Challenge: brush an elephant’s teeth with elephant toothpaste
Yay
does anyone question how much money mark rober has spent total?
I want to see a devil toothpaste flask video
"child labour" "revolted due to harsh working conditions" - the children painting
I feel bad for the people who have to clean it up lmao
Woooo new video!
That I a fun and amazing party
Don't even need to finish the video before I give it a like
If YouTube fails you should become a party planner
Love you mark but you need some new montage/background music!
LMAO THE KID AT 10:42 ABT TO JUMP IN
The best part was that he used my favorite song for the 20 second build montage.
best video you ever have maked:)))
<3
Mark Rober in 2025: today we will blast the earth with a elephant toothpadt cannon
Who would like to be his uncle
7:52 Guys on December 1st:
Super heart warming
This is why mark is in my top 5 favorite YouTubers
what a great deed
You warmed my heart
You sir are a gift to humankind.
Like
Any one else wishing that you had problems so that mark would do this for you
The best person in the whole wide world
The rocket league music was fire
Amen
You Rock, Rober!!! Lol You always amaze me with the science you bring to us and the smiles n joy you bring to the kids around you. Keep being you, never change plz!! =0)
I love how happy Mark is spreading happiness to others. An absolute gem in the cap of those who give faith back in humanity as is the kiddo who gifted his wish to another. Just pure pureness lol
Mark Rober's Videos are a true definition of "being a YouTuber is a full time job"
Let’s put a quick f in the chat cuz in some other universe, the drone guy did get hit with a flying bin
Nice snowbird shirt, board or ski?
No turn it upside down to make a rocket
Next year do the same with devils toothpaste.
wow...
Awesome
+ uncle points
The video is cool, too bad only white people were invited.
This is amazing if only the world could work together this much I love living out in the open country, where almost everyone knows everyone. But I unfortunately don’t live in California this must even been amazing for the nearby residents of Gridley.
You could have also just put the flask underground so that the flask has less room to expand 🤷‍♂️
Out of your budget ? 😂😂
Does this video make anyone realize how boring their summer was 😂
You give me hope for humanity @Mark Rober ❤️
You sir are an amazing person, thank you for all you do
only biodegradable soap should be used.
If this guy does not have more IQ than Albert Einstein then he is not an actual person
The coolest uncle in the world.
With Mr. Beast’s money, and Mark Robers mind, nothing is impossible lol
the only bad part about this video is that i wan't invited.
I’m sorry but why does the kid look so unimpressed. He’s like yea cool 😐👍🏻
Driving and recording? Bruh, please get a freaking camera support for car shots XD
Not me noticing @lethamyr yt intro during the backing music 😂
Imagine this is your teacher
can someone pleaseeee tell me the song at 2:40
12:37 hi Fletcher!
Well there’s a record that will probably stand for a long time if not forever 😁
Yknow, 2 things: 1 the thieves probably think of themselves as heros bc of how big a party this was and 2 I have a doc that explains how to advance society in 5 steps into a interstellar species
we all need an uncle like Mark in our life.
Me: watching the video  Mark: 20 Second montage  Me: skips 20 seconds Me: I can now watch the video
DUDE! THIS IS SOOOOOO COOL!
ever wonder devils toothpaste is made of
I didn't even realize this was posted 4 hours ago
best vids on yt 100%
yay.
thTA Y YOU Hvntw been uplouding
Yay! Excited to watch!
It was even higher than the camera expected
I comment to help statistics
We need to flood the internet and the world with positivity like this. Obviously, it won't be to this status but even if you make one stranger smile, you have impacted someone's day in a positive way.
Bro what if they made devils toothpaste grenades
Thank you for bringing joy to everyone's life. It's amazing to see how so many people came together for this amazing kid. also loved that amazing slo-mo.
Thank you so much for doing this for this kid im pretty sure it made his day and it made my day just watching it
so, you know what's next? exactly. breaking that record with devils toothpaste.
awesome
To be selfless is a rare quality. Much love from 🇬🇧
Pushing against an inflated football? That means nothing to me and probably the majority of viewers.
I DID NOT KNOW YOU KNEW MR BEAST IM HIS FAN
Mr beast, theoddonesout, and Mark Rober post a video in 1 day, AND ITS NOT EVEN MY BIRTHDAY!!!
that has to be a cheap way to move objects in a vacuum..
You should compensate the owner of the Walnut farm because his trees are covered with elephant toothpaste .
Mark is the real life Phineas and Ferb
He definitely plays baseball 😂
Im speechless
Elfents toof past
Was everyone vaccinated in the party?
Why did you change the title from slime volcano to elephant toothpaste volcano
This guy is a legend we will never forget
A perfect mix of science, fun and wholesomeness as always, you're the best!
Doofenshmirtz would be proud.
White people. White people everywhere!
so it was 625psi near the top? not bad.
Just bloody awesome all round 👍👍👍👍👍
Dammm again bro I have one question will he give up on this challenge am I know he wont
Oh, how much I want to be Mark Robert's nephew... So much fun party with uncle Rob
I think mark enjoys these elephant toothpaste parties more than the kids do
Best video on YouTube.
Now have fun cleaning that up.
Lol the lethamyr intro song
I'll be going to his alma mater soon.
Post more please
YAY NEW MARK ROBER did u move ur Tacoma this time
12:45
I wonder how much each of these videos cost just to make....
This is pog
Hello
I know theres kiwico for kids and its great! But anybody know if theres one more geared towards adults?
the drone shots are next level on this one.
mark rober should be a professional drone driver
Just imagine if he closed or put a huge rubber stopper on the top and did what he did on the first one but with the stopper on it and let this whole thing go orbit the earth
Actually, I rarely post a comment, but this time, I just want to say that Mr.Beast, You and other people like you are just awesome personalities and they keep my believe in life and happiness alive, thank you.
Epic
i wish there was more behind the scenes stuff like normal
Now it’s time to do it again except with Devil’s Toothpaste
Mark Should totally make a really cool backyard roller coaster
Hello
mark rober could charge 50,000$ a birthday party
yay
All of Mark's video's nowadays feel like the season finale of a TV show where all of the beloved characters from the previous episodes come together for one big adventure.
mark is the goat
ok but who steals a kids atv
That is way too satisfying to be true
the kids going UP the slide in the reverse part makes me very uncomfortable
OMG
GIVE TO THE WORLD THE BEST YOU HAVE & THE BEST WILL COME BACK TO YOU .
I love how Mark is the one that is most excited about the toothpaste
Oh, I know all about Draft Kings.  Any Jomboy fans here?
mark i think you broke the record
you do a video about trebuchets
HE POSTED>?????
Props to Brody for being more selfless than most adults.
12:59 Epic moment
👍👍👍
Me being that person to mention the lethemyr intro music
Mark robers new favourite thing 👍
Again!?
The record got destroyed
Mark never seizes to amaze me
Mark must be the coolest uncle ever.
Anyone else shed a tear or two? No? Yeah…. Sniff, me either… sniff….
its my birthday today im 14 and this video made my birthday better even if i was not there to see it in person. i thought the first time you tried this it was amazing and wholesome  but you guys cranked it up to 11 one this vid. props to the kid that used his wish to help someone and that is  very sweet of him.  You put a ton of effort in into making these vids that its worth the wait. This vid is a 11/10 in my opinion
Seeing this just warmed my heart ❤️ also it looks so fun 🤩
POV : You Came To Read MrBeast s comment
now flip it and make it an actuall rocket
bro i cried when i heard what the kid did
It looks a giant sprinkler firework
Amazing
The world needs more Mark Robers.
Some may consider him “THE” scientist of YouTube
(:
TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS
4:24 The devil is scary if he’s ok with using that as toothpaste! /s
Is exactly how volcanoes work?
What if he did technoblade next
imagine adding purple to elephants toothpaste and accidentally discovering a new catalyst
we all need to get together and ask why and what the food coloring company did to the purple color ????
the orange one like when they zoomed in it looked like lava
I was literally JUST thinking about how cool you are, then I find this video. What a great day!
Wow! Just amazing.
And for the next time your record gets broken try building a proper venturi for the foam
The yearly tradition.
Me sitting in bed on a weekend watching kids have fun outside:
No, you're crying!
The absolute best uncle on Earth!, now I have no doubts
FINALLY!!
I need this kind of videos to keep my hope up for humanity
Did anyone noticed that when the orbeez pool scene comes in they play Lethamyr's intro theme song?  Or just me? :))))
It would be so cool to experienxe that lucky for him :)
Mark isn’t exited to see it go so high he is just happy it didn’t fail
were you selfie filming while driving mark?
and how much did this cost?
Destin with smarter every day may have gotten me into engineering, but you are a catalyst to keep pushing through engineering school! Now back to physics… :)
When one true scientist fails he doesn’t give up. One shall keep trying until whom is satisfied with his results.
Mark in 7 years : Making Hiroshima’s toothpaste (WORLD RECORD!!!!!1!1!!1)
The fact this was in September
SpaceX should look into elephant's toothpaste powered rockets. That would be a sight to behold.
If mark wants to come down that would be awesome
Very scientifically wholesome!
Lol
Finally an upload won’t miss it
what goes around comes around
Your videos are pure joy, and awesomeness.
nice
I remember how happy he was the first time his excitment was over 9000, he deserves everything that he experienced
Mark Rober is the new Ty Pennington
WOOOOOOW
I’m so early yay can’t wait for next month

I definitely would have chosen Option 1.
I love this guy so much
Hey look! Mark Rober got all Captain Disillusion on us there for a sec!

*Anyone who gets Mark Rober as a dad is guaranteed to have one of the best childhoods*
2:57 Okay but what is up with that Sprite bottle? Why is the drink inside of it opaque?
Love it!
13:10 seems kinda sus to me, idk
It’s crazy how Mark organizes all this. I want a video of how he organizes his personal life. We could learn SO much for our own lives
Mark is not only a master of elephants toothpaste but of youtube as while. every video is a master peice
Has it been a year already?!
yooo
a bit higher than 60 feet
Bust out the popcorn and ice cream, let’s get this going!
Lethamyr intro song
12:16 for the arrival and volcano.
Rip manis
10:30 that's so cool, i'd love to get a chance to do something like that with my drone. Who was the pilot, Nurk FPV?
I only see white people, lmfao 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mark Rober video not trending yet? Wild…
Hi this is SO satisfying
Assuming "the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" is 13.5psi, then that flask was taking 675psi
That was a w e s o m e
@14:40 them daisy dukes tho
Love the videos mark. Thank you for the great content and for making the world a better place.
This is literally spazmatizim
Was that better than going to the doctor's office? ...Yeah
It’s really amazing that you do these kind of things!!
Plankton won't be happy you're not sharing your secret Devils Toothpaste formula!
how did they clean the devils toothpaste up 😂
I love your Videos 🔥🙌
Now tell us how you cleaned up, and show us
Amazing
When I first saw the video, I instantly thought he actually did it.
Just wow
Always at the end of a video I have a lot of respect to you.
Love your work
Does his mom have an OF o.o
Yessssssss a new video
Mr Beast forever
1.2K give this a thumbs down!! Why? Seriously, why? Ya know what, those don't matter, and aren't worth the attention. Mark, that was just the coolest thing every. You definitely outdid yourself....again! Props to you and Brody, congrats on your new Guinness world record tallest Elephant fountain too. THAT ROCKED! And I hope you have a looooooong and happy life! (You too Mark!)
Imagine being a bird and then seeing a giant burst of elephant toothpaste coming up to you
9:52😳
Mark, tell me that your party did not turn out to be a COVID19 super spreader event.
Dr Peter Mc Cullough MD testifies to Texas Senate HHS Committee. Association of American Physicians and Surgeons
this is like mark's every project times two in one video
The amount of effort, time and money that these projects require...
Hi m
AGAIN BRUHH
You and Beast are the power couple YouTube needs
it must be so akward for brody who has 100s of unknown people in his birthday party-
Have I misread elephant toothpaste for slime earlier?🤔 I'm so confused xd
16:11 awkward handshake/hug
HOW DO THEY CLEAN THE DEVIL'S TOOTHPASTE UP???????
Hate him!!!
The world needs more Mark Robers
what kind of measurement is "50 times the  force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" lmao
IDK why, but I think that fletcher might have an interest in volcanoes, partially because the last one looked like Hawaii and this one resembles Vesuvius.
How
For a second I thought I unsubbed but no he just hasn't uploaded! :D
Crazy 😦
Get your "favourite science YouTuber ticket" here 👉🏽🎟
you never fail to impress me. you’re such an amazing person.
well done
@MarkRober, I’m curious on where you get all these chemicals on this amount?
Awesome video but this one is awesome as well: @
Dude used his make-a-wish for someone else?!?! I... he... nice... that's... Edit: I've found a word: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
i hate notifications like: someone liked your comment or: you got a new subscriber
YOU CAN SUFECATE
Cool
brodies moms a baddie
Yessir
Where is technos party
what's the force in kg?
The amount of dedication this guy puts in for his content is amazing
That's so cool mark! And I'm a big fan of your channel
Very Cool ! ! !
I tried counting all the poc in the video and i think it's a solid 0. Happy for Brody and all the yts!
Noice
The feeeeeeeeEeeeeeEEeEeeeeeeelllls

Does anyone else see Nickelodeon Slime when the main blast was over?
Mark Rober: *invents Devil's toothpaste* The military: "Write that down, write that down!"
Yesssir

Dubs
I love how kind and wholesome mark is
Brilliant
imagine being a bird and seeing this
This is the most wholesome video on YouTube.  Love you, Mark. :) You're the best!
This video is great
how high could you make a rocket go up with just devils tooth paste?
I couldn't stop smiling throughout this whole video!

Honestly if you make this a yearly thing, I'd love to be able to volunteer and come out to help out
8:00 Kids mind: AHHHH
*cough* *cough* you talked to... MR.BEAST?!
im literally refreshing the  page and seeing new comments pop up every second
Yo another one
E
Hi mark
Can’t believe you were close to me ! I lived in Yuba City !! Dang ! Haha
always love ur video, so inspiring
55 more feet and you will reach the height of the Statue of Liberty
You could combine the food color with the injection, it should mix "gud enuf."
It funny how mark has a better phone than Mr Beast
the drone shots where epic, very cool
Rip plants
Making/seeing other people happy, makes you happy too.
Well bye fletchers record 😂

This is so wholesome :)
I love his videos because he is so humble.
Mark you are seriously o one of the coolest humans to ever live
Never have seen a piston in real life except for Minecraft.
life made him so mature
pls make a 5 ton flask filled with DEVILS toothpaste next time.
This video was absolutely incredible, it had so many different emotions
Cool now do it with devil's toothpaste
The kid who used his “make a wish foundation” wish to get another kid’s stolen ATV back is so wholesome. I hope my Daughter grows up to be like that kid one day!
Very cool
And when the world needed him most he return
part IDK in Mark Rober’s quest to be the best uncle to everyone
You always impress Mr. Rober
So trippy hearing Lethamyr's theme song in a Mark Rober video.
Over 1 million views in just 3 hours? That's amazing.
Remember to stay hydrated today everyone!

You should go on a science museum world tour
Mark rober is just Elon Musk for kids, what a chad
Not again
He finally did it
This is one of the top 5 moments on this channel
when mark rober gives away your fantasy football pick for the exact same reason you're wanting to draft the player
How did that dude front flip out of the pool like that
Yea
Shoutout to the people in the community who volunteered to help for the surprise party
this kid is like the luckiest kid kinda
10/10 vid
Love your ambition sir, hats off
Aliens looking at earth while this experiment is happening be like "we have gotten the message we are no match for u humans and specially mark rober
Yooooo
I think they just use an ever stronger catalyst in devil's toothpaste to stimulate that explosive reaction.
We all know no matter what Mark does with his life, he is definitely going to heaven
This is amazing mark! I wish I was one of your neighbors lol.
We need this in vr
Best party of 2021
So great.  Great job brother n team
Gotta respect the Cessna Citation though, I never knew it was that fast
How much did the steel cost?
“Look at the house, you can’t even see it!”
10182nd!!!
I love it when the notification shows up “you have a new subscriber” ❤️❤️It makes my day can u do it please?🥺 can u make my day? If you do it u and your loved one will live more than 100 years❤️
I love that this isent evven the biggest why someone made his huge backyard a elephant toothpaste thing like this but he used so much his 3 pools filled up his house backyard and his neighbours somehow and got allot of problems
bro some came out the bottom
I have a same error track as soon
I’d love to be related to Mark to attend all those cool parties he throws 😂🥰. Great video 🥰
Nice Yamaha Raptor!!!
This looks like a dream come true Mark Rober is such an inspiration when it comes to mixing engineering and science with a simple act of kindness
I just absolutely love the town coming together to help with all their professions, the carpenter, welder, the dude with the digger, all the other great tradesmen who helped make it all possible. I hope they all got a great time at the party too!
When life gives you lemons…. Make a difference in the world
E.T.: Elephant Toothpaste
vesuvius is jealous
Ngl i think mark and Mr beast put the most effort in there vidoes
But... Why?
ah i was wondering why i didn't see this earlier, it came out today. How absolutely lovely :)
This is the coolest ever!
I love live in a life like this
Yaaas
Dang, I wish I lived in Mark Rober’s neighborhood-
Hope that, that stuff is Not polyurethane =)
Mark Rober makes insane videos
Nick just loves elephant toothpasy
Mark rober pretty much plays minecraft in real life
Nice!!
What drives you to be a great person. No really I want to know  Mine is because at one point people were really not nice to me and Keanu Reeves was my role model one's I saw the nice things he did
when life gives you a tesla... fly in a private jet
Reoawwwww
ITS FLETCHER AGAIN! OH YEAH!  To Mark: Pls Heart and reply :(  Edit after the Devils Toothpaste: HOLY S*** NICE MARK!
Any 'toothpaste' that involves red fuming nitric acid is cool stuff in my book
Mdr baest
The faded recess selectively influence because security fundamentally spray without a fearful fearless belgian. swanky, knowing canoe
Who ever helped with the jet rocks
The stuff u do for people is just amazing.
Some doujinshi will get inspired by the foam burst 😂
I am crying. You are too. Lots of love from the deep.
Love this :)
ahhh im m 3 hours late he is not gonna heart my comment ahh😭😭
LOVE UR CONTENT! Congratulations on 19 MILLION! Subscribers ALMOST AT 20 MILLION! keep up the AMAZING CONTENT!
What is being whispered at 12:44? Is Mark trying to implant subliminal messages into our brains!?
1.2 m views in 3 hours😳
W
I feel like there is a decent chance that Mark Rober's Devil's toothpaste is really just Greek Fire, and we just don't realize it yet.
Just me or this editing and these transitions are just on another level
Those kids probably like their uncle more than there parents
We're not just making videos, we're changing lives
Imagine hypothetically you WERE new to the channel and you listened in this video for two minutes. Incredible!
So what was your favorite subject in school? 🤨
this is the type of content i wanna see!!! i wish there were more of you on youtube but  u rally are the one and only goat
Cool 😎
What an amazing shots wow 😍
great effort
I'm stuck in bed today with a back pain flare-up, and this video was a great way to pass the time! Another excellent video Mark.
Mark’s the uncle that everyone would dream to have
Generosity of the people is limitless! I can’t thank enough team and everyone who made this happen! I got emotional, watching this video. Humanity is the way! Thank you!
When we learn what H2O is in school they dump chemistry into space.
Upload more frequent! :) Pretty please?
Amazing how with great teamwork, Mark and his helpers were able to build that giant flask in 20 seconds!
I forgot the Tesla head self driving and kept having a heart attack every time Mark looked away from the road
just imagine a gender reveal party with this
I'm glad you revisited the Flask to make it not rupture. Still an absolute Legend!
the food coloring manufacture: we don gufed up
Being honest I will never be in one of mark robers vids
One word                AWESOME
Mark could really be saving the world but I guess making a kids life is a close second
I love this keep doing the great work
Now you just need to make one without a hole at the top, and make the flask itself go to space.
Love vides
Every kid with a disease is now all waiting for mark rober to visit them haha.
Amazing uplifting video that we all need during these tough times.
That's a really big Brawndo geyser.  Lots of lektrolites there.
😁😄😃😆🤣
This is the most Mark Rober Mark Rober video yet, and I’m honored to have witnessed the journey. 🙌
I kinda want to see mark make a rocket
I’ll never be able to admire Mark’s work enough. He used to be a science only channel, now he’s literally changing people’s lives using science aswell as giving us some incredible entertainment. There are few people on this earth like you Mark, and I really hope that you know how great of a guy you are. Thank you!
Now this is something that YouTube was actually designed for. As a space and science enthusiast now in my mid-sixties ., Mark you make me feel like a kid again everytime I watch something you post. And for that I say thank you. You have truly earned your reputation on YouTube
Youtube earnings well spent.
Elephant toothpaste in a giant flask?
yay mark rober upload
When you eat Taco Bell : 13:01
"Me when your girl, Me when your... Me when your girl sees..."
So it is his last year to live??
You put so much effort into your video’s
Lethamyr 😳 11:18
Song in the background of the orbeez pool anyone know it?
Me when your mom- when you- when your m- when your mom
Wow way higher and higher quality😳
Tbh I feel like Mark's videos get better every new video
Your fan from a small village in india 🙏🙏 Love you Mark
Here king you dropped this 👑
This video made me cry a bit :')
I have the same leaf blower and it is powerful!
I don't like your videos... I LOVE your attitude buddy! You really make this world a better place! 🥳❤️
13:50 thank you now i know exactly how much xD no front love the video amazing!
Yo
What amazing people to help with all that stuff !!!
OMG you did it
Omg
Mark and his Elephant Toothpaste...
....OK so now we need an elephants toothpaste powered rocket and see how far it can go.......
Super vidéo !
🙌
Why am i crying
Can you make rain to power
I love ur videos
It used to be called largest slime volcano.
I wish I had a uncle or a brother like him 😭💙
he's gotta be the favorite uncle by now
WOW HES LUCKY
If there bugs where in the elephant toothpaste yay im flying but its hot
#1 on trending for 48 days
Shrek coom
What if someone sat on the top
This is prove that when u put the work in you get the best reactions!! Great vid
Mark is so nice
He's the new mr rogers
Dude, you bring so much joy to science and engineering.  Thank you!
Wow very incredible story! You changed that kids life! Amazing job!
Mark’s videos never fail to warm my heart and renew my faith in humanity. They are a cathartic form of therapy. Thanks for everything you do.
mark casually saying he wasnt gunna give out the devils toothpast recepie then puts the sollution in a vidio
FOR NEXT YEAR:  Imagine if you'd crafted a multi-port injection manifold with four V-8 exhaust manifolds for each bin to introduce the catalyst...  I know, I know...  Budgets.  But I'll bet you could concoct a cheap and easy version by extending the "syringe" into the box, capped on the end, but with many holes drilled in its sides, and a watertight plug in the middle that'll let loose the moment it's hit with the 50 psi pressure.  To push more catalyst out, insert a smaller, 3/4 x diameter plug in the middle.
Can we all just stop to appreicate how quick the drones are, that are able to move quickly, while the slowed down video is vertially still
This is how you create a day those kids will never ever forget. Amazing.
Draftkings....  are you hoping to turn a bunch of kids on to sports betting???  I used to really respect you.  /SMH
OH JIMMY!!!
Literally any methric system: -I bought a new car -oh, hom many horses of power do it have? Mean while usa methric system: -i bought a new car -oh, how many fully inflated footballs of power does it have?
Honestly the content alone is totally worth it, but then to give it away to change someone's life and reward their generosity is that next level of amazing that makes Mark my literal favorite person in the world. Spreading knowledge, understand, and curiosity is great, but sharing the love and compassion is what he's doing to make the world a better place, slowly but surely!
Omg amazing!
you should do this again but put a mannequin inside to have it launch up in the air.
Ahh that beauty
It's just amazing what you are doing for these kids, you really make everyone's day better
These videos make me so happy you don’t even know it 💕
Mind Blown
Looking forward to hearing more on making scammers lives miserable.
It's just me or Brody doesn't look that surprised? That kinda worries me a bit 😕😢
Maybe you shouldn't have calibrated the pressure sensor to footballs instead of, say, newtons, PSI or atmospheres. There's always some catch with the cheap cr*p you get on ebay!
Me? Jealous? nah, totally not jealous, totally not immaging myself behind that megaphone...
I want uncle points to stay
soo cool  and i love it
Maumau
Mau
This is what I think of the government 🖕
Mark, disguising a party for kid just so that he can get his revenge on the devil toothpaste cannon 😂
Letz Go!
The glistening glorious smoke postsurgically invent because plane respectively shop plus a chilly typhoon. tight, damaging cellar
When u here leth intro music
Ok so now you just need to do it with devils toothpaste.
Even mark rober needs to tell everyone about his Tesla! XD
you flew a plane because the drive was 1.5 hours?
Did he just measure the psi with footballs
At the time I saw this video there we 1000+ dislikes....I hope you step on Legos. Shameful.
Me next
Awesome job
This video deserves more than a like
This made me cry. It's like love overload
If Mark Rober comes up to you ant tells you he has a surprise party for you, you know that it's going to be the best thing that will ever happen to your miserable life
So many videos i think he might break his own record of most videos uploaded in a year
If this SHIBA coin ever takes off and I make a couple million.  I'm gonna get ahold of you mark and we are going to do something awesome for someone! I'd love to be able to make some ones day like this.
Great video
Funfact:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    U klicked on read more and scrolled all the way down  Have a nice day 👀
kid has 1 reaction to everything : 😒
Draftkings? xD
Handsome video… congrats on the ET Record!    Helmets prevent Traumatic Brian Injuries.
I love me a 20 second build montage
child labor lol
It would’ve been better if you colored the flask toothpaste red or orange or yellow so it looked like a volcano eruption
!?!! THAT WAS LAST YEAR!?!???!!
Yeeesss  I love wholesome sciences *pushes glasses up and grabs tissues*
These vids make me happy because they took so long to make
14:20 you can hear mark losing his voice lol
As a other Brody I enjoyed this
3 hours late 🥳🥳🥳
The cinematography in this video was absolutely insane. The quality of the video was incredible. This is by far the best video you have created. Amazing!
The quote your looking for is “ you get what you give “
sup
10:00 pastery rising
This is the America we all want.
mad g
2:03 Hmm.. sounds familiar.
Hey mom!!! Mark Robers new video is out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Applause to the person who cleaned the orbeez pool
Fun fact Orby‘s are the worst thing for the ocean
That kid really deserved that party
Brody used his one wish to give a kid he never met, that had their atv stolen, a new one. What an absolute legend.
Note to all those failed experiments/ideas/or any other crazy thing that didn't work....Mark Rober is coming for you!  HAHA This is beyond cool!  After watching that video, if you aren't laughing uncontrollably...well, you need to watch it again, and turn the sound UP!  Haha.  Thanks Mark!!  For always showing us math and science are cool...and for just being you!  So after all this, you had to jump in the private jet again to go get your car?  LOL
Pog
The laws unfair I wish if you told people how to make devils toothpaste and they got hurt it wasn’t your fault
Early!!!
pog!!
did you just leak the devils toothpaste recipe
L A U N C H
Bruh i live 10 minutes away from gridley
Hey this video came out on my 18th birthday! Such a wonderful way to start my new year.
❣️MR
Mike Rober: casually saying he enforces child labor FBI: I didn’t hear anything🙄
This will Go down as a Legend Moment in 2021.
who cleans up after these videos😭 I would probably volunteer
So so glad Fletcher was in this video to! <3
Kool
🤯👍👍👏❣
You really deserve the money you earn
Mark Rober just uses kids so that his brilliant ideas don’t make him look like a child 😂
You are realy cool
mark you are an amazing person
Bro u reached 1Mil views in 3 hours  Props to u my guy
my mind is blown by ur big brain Kepp it up
When somebody does something cool: yo I did it!! Mark Rober: oh no you don't
10:00 it looks like lava
Hold my toothpaste
17:03 Is that a david dobrick logo??
You're content is the definition of quality of quantity.
We need more mark river and mr beast crossovers
Cant believe you have 1k thumbs down, mental!!! Keep doing what you are doing Mark, you are changing peoples lives for the better (and taught me a ton of new things), well done :)
7:55 that’s peace the wrong way bro
I love how everyone there helped even though they didn’t know him but they helped anyway
I already know that the military is gonna use devils tooth paste as some sort of weapon
you such a cool guy
As a saints fan I’ve never been more proud of mark than after what he said during the sponsor at the end
goddamn this badboy deserves a billion views
Yay a new video
I love your channel so much
It was incredible.  The only way I think it could be even better is to find a way to mix the components better. Like we saw before seems like there is a lot of catalyst that doesn't react at the same time. So maybe if you want to make it even bigger... AGAIN. That could be a great way to make it more powerfull.  Awesome work Mark. Its great.
Did you use the flex seal family of products this time?
Everyone on this video was an MVP.
Almost at 20mil
9:56 it looks like fry chicken skin
Incredible
Thanks to this video, we can now confirm that there is an incredibly strong oxidizer in devil's toothpaste.  Given that it was able to set Mark's gloves on fire and its brown colour, my guess is fuming nitric acid.
10:26: A Cloud Made Of Elephant Toothpaste
Ok, if you are not the favorite uncle yet, I wanna know what your brother does with those kids.
His videos always brings me happiness and restores my faith in humanity just a tad
It was about Time
Yaaaaay
"the force inside is the same as 50 times a fully inflated football" Is this what the imperial system is like? Just comparing random things with other things that resonate with you and then hope that relavates the information to your peers?
I feel like this guy is a better make a wish
Nic3
hi
mark rober is awesome
Because we can!
this is so wholesome
Hiya
The mayor!!!!
E                                     Equels cience
4:39 it looks like you guys are building on mars!!!
Ok
When life gives you lemons YOU MAKE LIFE TAKE THE LOND BACK I DONT WANT YOUR DAMM LEMONS WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO WITH THESE
Who knows who lethamyr is and recognized the music
Yes, I've been waiting for another upload
I’m so mad at whoever stole that kids ATV. I’m glad that this came out of it though
7:43 XD lol foam Daddy?!?
Close to 20 million
Jeff😄
Again…? Gosh
My heart has swollen ❤
12:48 you're welcome
o
i’ve been here scince 100k i think and u are one of my fav youtubers
I think u shod do one for ur son
When you poured a considerable concrete floor  i knew this was serious 🤣🤣🤣
My life looks empty next to this...lol
This has to be one of your best videos yet
2:38 Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need
mark rober literally just made a freaking volcano
😁 love this video 😄😄😄
We remember MrBeast did destroy his brother’s home with elephant toothpaste! 😆
I feel like theirs gonna be people offering money for the formula.
You are such an amazing individual Mark. I think you would have done great no matter which direction you decided to go in life, however the 'philanthropic science engineer' may very well be your true calling =p. You bring smiles and joy to so many people with all that you do and I know I am just one of many of those. Thank you for all that you do Mark!
That’s me after Taco Bell 💨
RIP the other kid’s record
YESSSSSSS I LOOK AT YOUR ACCOUNT YESTERDAY HOPING YOU POST I LOVE YOU
mark just seems like a nice guy and a fun person to be around
The grand finale was like a nuke
Awesome work :)
Mark: That's why I don't give out the formula Mark 3 seconds later: *lights a glove, proving that its made with nitric acid*
wow.
Yeah, it was five times taller...but was it laminar, Mark?!
This is super cute and that boy deserve it <3 ALSO you're turning your mates place into a theme park lol
The sister is cute
Next time I do an elephant's toothpaste demo for a Science class I'm going to think of this video and weep.
I remember when that video was new
Next year he’s gonna do this with devils toothpaste
What happens if you mix devils toothpaste with elephant tooth paste?
What if you like, turned the flask upside down, like an elephant toothpaste rocket
You need to make this a holiday each year you do this again
ANOTHER ONE ???
Me counting the 20 seconds of him building it
Pardon me sir Rober but may you inform me of the initial temperature of the "Devil's Toothpaste".         Also I noticed you moved your truck.
13:02 drone cheers
that video made me soooo emotional...
I’m going to cry the day we find out mark is MJ in disguise
Wow 👏👏👏👏 that was very fun...
8:39 did... did he just reveal the formula?
Your a amazing person, keep up the work
Mr. Beast. The only celeb I've seen using the non pro iPhone.
Can't imagine what would happen if Mark used Devils toothpaste instead of Elephant Toothpaste :l
Now that Mark has the record for World's Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano, he should go about trying for World's Tallest Devil's Toothpaste Volcano >:P
Hi
One video, this will be my first and last to be on a private jet, this video on a private jet, 🤔
Mark Rober is the definition of the cool uncle.
You guys shouldn't have like red and orange
You are an actual legend
How easy is it to clean up?? What effects does it have environmentally? Just genuinely curious
holy moly MOST QUALITY VIDEO EVER! : = 0
Yo, you did it
The drone pilot is from another world
Now do this 10x bigger... im not joking...im like reely do it...
Remember when he was still doing watermelon party hacks?

Am I the only one who thinks the elephant toothpaste looks like colored scrambled eggs? Lolll
E=MC2
Ayo my boy, hmu with some of that $ like sheesh 😱
amazing vid like aways.   pog

Now you know why other people leave their communist countries to come to America. Because this is the kind of people they pray to meet & strive to be in America!👍🇺🇸✝️🛐
yes
What an amazing video!
Who else thinks mark robers videos are like a actual movie
imagine all this hardwork and the whole team forgot to press record....
This video is so wholesome
This was so great
Thanks about time you did the unspeakable .Congratulations!😄😄
I wish he was my uncle but the. I don’t because then he wouldn’t post because i would have dropped his camera by accident
TVs in curry’s pc world 14:02😂
If he turns this upside down I think Elon Musk would hire him 🚀
How do you clean it up?
All I can say is poggers
Bad
I guess the money from the shady Sponsor was at least well spend
This guy makes the best videos
Incredible.F YEAH SCIENCE
I just realized that mark rober has become like a real life Ms Frizzle taking kids on fun educational field trips 😂😂😂I love it and wish one day I’ll get taken on one 😂
Double the size again 😌
THE LEGEND FINALLY POSTED AND EVEN BETTER ITS ABOUT ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE!!! :D
Mark Rober's Heart ❤️ will never be shot in the air that high. It's way to massive. Thanks Mark you really made my day. Bless you my friend ❣️💛💛💛..

So cool
Mark: Worlds Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano (real) (true) (no cap)  Me after sitting at my pc for the last 10 hours: _what am i doing with my life_
What are the prospects of using devils toothpaste as a rocket propellant? I feel like thatd be a cool model rocket at the very least
This was amazing, but if you ever do another video with this much color, PLEASE do an HDR version, it would look so incredible!
YESSSSS
what if you made the fluid sand thing out of orbeez?
Plot twist: Mark Rober is funded by MrBeast
Mark Rober=Science+Mr. Beast+Kids
Very cool
The cool uncle
Them having fun... Me sitting on my bed with a head cold 😓
HOLY MOLY
Those people knew that doing their part to make this happen was its own recompense, and that getting to enjoy the fruit of their labor was just the icing on top.
Every kids dream 😊

I just love this
Nice job
Late posting, long vids, science, and confidence makes a perfect video and a channel
Yesss
that music during the orbeez part do be reminding me of the lethamyr intro
Gee Mark, I'm surprised you didn't get any pictures from the international space station.
What a surprising video
Maybe the world isn't truly awful
5 Tons of steel! 🤣  I hope you make enough money off this video to cover that
I like how Mark way more hype than the kids haha
Hi
Part 3?
Mark - you are a great role model.  Not just for the kids but for everybody.  Thanks for doing what you do!
Only if Mark Rober was in new zealand
Foam Daddy lmao
Mark and the kids look like they could be the cast of a movie.
Mark Rober: SO MY LAST 60 FT VOLCANO WAS A FAILURE  Me: Struggling to  make a baking soda volcano
I envy him
Faith in humanity: ✅
Idk how he keeps one upping his last video
Nice
Did you use lethamyr’s intro song?
What about you actually use elephants toothpaste as fuel for a “rocket”
Who will cleaning this up
Earlyer today I was watching your video asking when the next video and huh
Casually he says " I told my friend Mr beast about this "
Hi
You could say that was mark II 🧀
I love how Rob acts like a kid but he's as smart as Albert Einstein
I love what you said at 16:06. I always try my hardest to be nice and kind and the result of it is not always immediate. Thanks for giving me hope.
Oh no
First
Hi Goodbye
Hi
The U.S. Military is coming for the recipe.
This guy is the coolest uncle
Mark Rober is quite possibly one of the best people of the 21st century. He's like Mr. rogers and Bill Nye rolled into one.
I wish i had an uncle like you but i dont even have an uncle ☹️
So this is why u ain't uploaded 😲
Who's cleaning up?
@lethamyr It’s official, Mark Rober is a fan of your intro 😂
Looks like a rip-off chernobyl
I am the most unlucky person in the world why I cannot get these things on my birthday
Wow I'm amazed

4:41 Yeah sure, as if the last construction failed because of the lack of effort
how do u measure the Hight
OMG
:)
When mark uploads its Christmas morning
I love all of this, I just worry about the environmental costs of it all?
This video is Amazing
Tesla stocks after a Mark Rover video: 📈📈📈
What if Mark Rober made vid about acid test
I really like this party thing! It’s so amazing to see a wholesome youtuber taking care of his fans! Keep doing these! ❤️
the town welder? he might as well be a politician in sweden (our prime minister is a welder)
Hi i just aced my science quiz so thank you
You should turn the flask into a rocket by getting it to all to go out the bottom
Teacher: If Mark bought 927 bars of soap and each one costs 4.3 USD how much would it cost him? Kid: Who is Mark? Teacher: Mark Rober. Kid: Oh, that explains it.
its my birthday today this is a great present
You are an a amazing person
Mark Rober is definitely one of the coolest humans ever.
Anybody else notice the mrbeast dummies?
U POSTED THIS ON MY BDAY IM SO HAPPY I LOVE THE NEW VID AND I WATCHED THE OTHER VID
That was absolutely awesome! Science AND fun! And what you did for those kids is nothing short of fantastic!
Wholesome and Awesome
Thank you for being one of the few remaining things breathing life into my faith in humanity.
Now that was a big improvement
The other animal tradition
9:34 taco bell
Wonderfull video, I enjoyed every second

Amazing stuff. Amazing people. Amazing day.
Woww
I love what you do so very much, Mark.
Yoooooo
This just fills me with joy. Thank you, Mark, for bringing joy to the people of this world!
Just dig a hole so deep put it in put dirt back can’t get out
That glass must be harder than diamond!
Mark rober make science look cool and bill nye
Yes 🙌🏼
lol for any lethamyr fans it is his intro song in this video
Hi
You Are The BEST Youtuber
Mark literally made the next greek fire
Insan
Wow👽
What a legend
You know Mr.beast
Yo Lethamyr he used your intro song
16:11 lol
Look up the word ALTRUISM. There’s a photo of Mark.
I wonder if you can build like a miniature nuclear reactor without using a nuclear fissioner or anything like that but have it to where it only set off elephant toothpaste to try break that second world record that you made I would like to see if the elephant toothpaste can launch up into the air about 500' or 1,000' up into the air.
The GOAT has done it again.
Another one of Mark Robers bangers.
You lost a subscriber because your friends with mr beast. :(
Sun of a gun he did it again
Marks primitive explanation of fantasy football while comparing a top 5 fantasy pick to Leonard fournette in a massive timeshare made me laugh
hi
and live long and prosper
Awesome!
nice :)
Next video: devil’s toothpaste rocket
Love how happy mark makes people
There’s very few people on this earth with a bigger heart than this guy.
Why are you so perfect
You're doing God's work Mark!! Well done!!
I actually guessed what he was going to say on option 2 lol
What is the build montage song
One of the best
Wish I had this kind of money
I can’t help but see the gemini capsule when looking at the flask
Definitely the most epic video you've ever made, And you've made a lot of awesome videos. Keep it up
best video of all time on yt, no doubt
you are the best . loved it ! <3
I'm seriously getting jealous
Me putting 1 Orbe in water: MORK ROBBER
Mark: "When life gives you lemons... build a 5 ton flask and blast them to space." Me: *Pours sulfuric acid on them.*    Much better *solution* .
13:12 even when he zoomed out the camera  still couldn't go as high at the elephant toothpaste
Where did the engineering go. All he's interested In now is veiws
mark rober is so op
You should try making a devil's toothpaste rocket
WOW
T
Watching this from my $100 second hand phone that barely functions anymore, in my tiny 160ft^2 apartment whose rent I can barely afford, eating instant noodles that I can just barely afford.
youve done it again well done
7:43 ima need some explanation
There really making lots of peoples lives boring
That is an amazing town!
this is amazing i was totally expecting Rob to over trow what he did too xD
It felt weird when I heard the Lethamyr Rocket League intro.
I'm here just to help the algorithm! What an amazing video!
Dam that was cool
This is a magical video, Mark.
Thank you for everything you’ve done spreading joy and science together.
"Yeah I use to work at NASA, why d'you ask?"
I wouldn't mind 1M views ;-)
A lot of people think of heros as super humans doing the impossible.  Mark and all those that helped in this show  that a real hero can be anyone willing to give their time and effort to help and make others happy.
I know your not a political channel but with the NFL pulling all the anti American antics, I'm interested in supporting a bunch of loosers.  Thanks for the great video Mark.
Nice expirement
Let’s go AK  !!!  Who dat
12:45  For those who are in a hurry 🤗
I do hope Brody recovers from his Leukemia. Kid, you deserve it.
The flask looks like something from despicable me
I was smiling this whole time
👏. That was great
The mannequins: what is my life, just to suffer a colorful hot death
We Finally made it...  Yes!!!!!
why cant youtubers use the metric system
gamer
Can you make a tutorial for the elephant tooth paste
🍿 waits for XQC to react to this
Hi
എന്റെ മോനേ...., ഇജ്‌ജാതി...... പൊളിച്ച്........
7:07 "only the finest.." its arrowhead water hahaha.
I'm waiting for the video where Mark Rober clones himself and makes world piece by just having more Mark Rober's in the world
I just hope you have a professinal cleaning crew. That was insane.
Spending years on a project? Nah. Using a 20 second build montage? HECK YEA
Mark is that kind of guy that asks for a pencil then he gives you you’re finished homework
The elephant toothpaste is finally over
12:45 For those who are in a hurry 🤗
Mars Rover never dissapoints us 😌
What a great guy with amazing people
I love u
20M 😍coming soon 😘
Hi Mark I am curious of something, how does the "toothpaste" go away? and by using a leafblower how does that help?
I'm curious what the actual pressure measurement was. Mark said it was 50x the force you feel when pressing against a fully inflated football, but that's not the best "measurement". What was the PSI?
Your gonna get 20M before you know it!
I put everything on hold to watch this  Is it just me or is this guy uploading very less xD
This deserves 100m views. You're amazing, Mark Rober.
It was the +1 uncle point for me
U DID IT MARK U MADE THE BEST THING EVER! another thing  brody*OMG TYSMM flichter*....i was ssupossed to have the world record;-;
i just saw him edit World's Tallest Slime Volcano into Worlds Tallest Elephant Toothpaste Volcano, did he think it was missleading?
5:29 Dr. Drake Ramoray IRL?
Why does it say “worlds largest slime volcano” and then when I click on the video it says “worlds largest elephant toothpaste Volcano”
This was great but I just kept yelling...HELMET!! HELMET!! at the end. Oh well, congrats, so awesome, glad you did it!
Waiting for all the verified youtubers to infiltrate the top comments with generic comments to advertise their channel
Fard 12:58
Love it! Just wish that Mark would pick a unprivileged kid instead of a unworried, surely insured, white boy. (Not to say those can't have problematic circumstances.)
Alright next video idea: Building an upgraded Potato Cannon to launch a lemon, to space to send it to Mars so Perseverance can think a lemon can grow on Mars.  LOL
Epic cinematography
this is why i love mark
Just subbed
Imagine if you decided to be the fun cool uncle but your sibling married Mark Robers sibling
1 million views within an hour
Only legends will remember when this video was called "World's Tallest Slime Volcano"
Am i the only one that just heard Lethamyr during the orbeez pool?
I want to be in a obe pool
I love how Mark interacts with the kids and how down to earth he really is!
i didnt know this was in gridley i live close to there
This entire video is why my faith in humanity hasn't dissipated yet
bout to smoke so much weed to this video
Team up with Dustin and get laminar flow in your elephant volcano
When life gives me lemons, I make steak
3 hours ago yay I love mark Robert
I really wasn't expecting Mr Beast, the moment i saw him, my BPM sky rocketed, Mark Rober, you're amazing, i love you
Imagine an actual useful thing could have been done with all this time intelligence and money
Enjoy life.   20 year ago tomorrow I finished my radiation therapy. Survival is possible, there is hope.
Mark is amazing
Amazing video and  really nice story. 😉
“Look at the house you can’t even see it” Mark Rober
MrBeast about to react to this
The moment you've been waiting for 12:47
Great vid
>"no one would work without a profit incentive or being forced to"  >This video.  Need I say more?
It even sounded like an elephant when it came out
Does anyone know where i can listen to the song at 16:24 ?? I know its called kalimba jam but i never found it online
this is the sweetest, and one of the most cool things i’ve ever seen! great job, mark.
This was epic 😮 great video!!!
It makes me sad to know I will never get to experience most of these things, but I am glad to see you got to give these kids these amazing experiences.
Introverts worst nightmare
Wow this was the best video yet i hope Brody had the best day ever 🙌
Mr beast fills his brothers house with elephant toothpaste. mark rober fans: there’s one person for the job
14:04 Mark sounds like Pickle Rick when he says "YEEEESSSS".
1M views in 3 hours ?  Why so less
mark making excuses to make another world record
Hi l like it
Welder Jeff had a lot to do
What county is it
I really needed this video and its positivity today!
mark just beat his own record.
The great American pastime, creating pollution for shits and giggles.
So nice to finally see some FPV shots in your videos duuude!!! ❤️❤️❤️
The test with the toothpaste catching on fire was more devilish than the actual devil toothpaste
I think you should try and make an elephant toothpaste ROCKET.
09:50   You Died
you're awsome
ig Its that time of the year again
Phenomenal! Thanks for being such a great example.
bruh mark rober spending as much money as mrbeast on his videos
I absolutely hate parties, so I'd just like to personally thank Mark Rober for not surprising me with one. It's really appreciated 👌😘 :P
Best videos
Hurts to see others living your dream
This is great as always Mark Rober, but you should think about helping POC into your videos. It’s 2021 Mark Rober and I know you have abilities to, just a thought
How many uncle points do you have?
Nice  (;
Wholesome
This video is amazing I appreciate keep it up
Everything about this is perfect
dude, you have a problem xd
marks entire crew: literally spending  months in making this set mark: 20 second build montage
This video was awesome
Faith in humanity: Restored.
Mark can u be my uncle?
The toothpaste went out of frame in almost every camera shot, that has to be a testament to how it exceeded everyone's expectations even the crew's.
Thought it was slime?
Love that you went with a "this is so crazy far away, it godda be within frame this time" and it wasn't enough.
dude, this guy is awesome
Do more plz
Just truly amazing
Mark Rober, u are awesome!!
Wow so this is what I missed at the store buying fall and Christmas stuff, I’m mad
I wonder if he could design a small rocket that uses the devil's toothpaste or a small canon .
Mark always delivers and he never disappoints
The kids in this town/family are so lucky
foam daddy 7:43
I feel bad for the mannequins that were harmed in this video lol
Props to the drone shots
My heart is warmed by the content and my mind is blown by the FPV shots. Is it appropriate to call myself a zombie now? 😂
he's no longer satisfied with just being the favorite uncle in his family, so he has to become everyone's favorite uncle
This just hit 1 million views
Nice
Them: what’s your dream job  Me: mark rober
hi
What a so much wholesome video.
How do you clean up the elephant toothpaste
Mark, watching your videos is almost as fun as watching you being the biggest kid in the world! Great job. I know it took the great help of others but Brody will never forget this one. Thank you!
Hi
im a kid....  .noo me im .. ok
Mark. I figure you are smart enough to figure This out. I believe you should buy an island and have technology for endanged animals and plants to create an ecosystem where they all have a basic food chain so they won't suffer as many side effects to the animals. Make sure only allowed people may go on the island, OK? So I don't think you have enough money for the island, so try and tell mr.beast this idea to save some species. Best of luck. This will be called "the island keepers".
Let me guess One of ingredients for the devil's toothpaste is nitric acid.
Best YouTuber. Hands down. It's not even close.
mans really a nerd that can make a gun with 2 tooth picks
Question what happens if someone is underneath as everything is splashing down?
Looks tasty 🤤
where is all this money coming from
you know I don't really have an interest in the software but I will download it
What's an urbie?
I wish I was his neice
Two thoughts immediately come to mind. 1) Mark is an awesome person who seems to have the perfect mixture of smarts/looks/charisma that money just can't buy. 2) In my 50 years, I've never felt that loved. Brody and Fletcher are incredibly lucky to have such caring people around them.
And now tell us more about the ecological footprint of all that stuff?
So we have elephants toothpaste and devils toothpaste, but can we get sloths toothpaste that creeps in slowly on some one.  Allowing for the coolest escape room ever.
Next up: I went to space using elephant toothpaste
Everyone he changed the tital the original  one was “worlds tallest slime volcano”
Almost cried it was beautiful at the end
Mark should throw the worlds biggest party and everyone is invited
This is the only channel I stop whatever I’m doing to watch the new video. Love your heart dude
You sir, are a gift.
*person has hard life*  Mark Rober: Allow me to introduce myself
Amazing camera work on this video!
Sheeeeshhhhh
Somehow one of the HAPPIEST channels on Youtube, often make me cry <3
Why is no one talking about mr beast there
What's the song used during the montage? Please
It's great that the town all came together to help.
After a day of crap news, this video is what I needed to see to have some faith back in mankind. As always, awesome job Mark + his many helpers :)
Hi :)
Simply the most amazing YouTube videos ever made. Another gem! I love that you are including special people in the joy of these great adventures.
Daang what camera was used on those super slo mo drone shots?
the cinematography of your videos is just amazing 🤩🤩🤩
Its crazy that it was a year ago mark rober had his last elefant toothpaste vid
The best days are ones like these.
Why the mannequins?
love the fact that mark is the favorite uncle
fletchers sister kinda fine
Wow omg so excited
Flip that flask around and it's gonna reach mars.
Never judge a book by it s cover. I was kind of sad I thought you might of not included Fletcher but I screamed out in joy when I saw him! So glad he gets to be a part of this record still!
That one bird flying through the air when the Volcano erupted: 💀
bruh a mil views in 2 hours
I swear mark Rober is slowly turning into Mr. beast or mr. science lol
Nice cameras
He did it again folks!
Omg it’s called Elephant toothpaste bc of the sound it makes. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I had  no  idea! Lmao Awesome video as usual! 🎉👏🏼❤️
what would happen if you put devils toothpaste in that same launch flask thing but you seal it so there is no where it can get out its a battle massive launch flask or devils toothpaste
Here before one milion.
how many Newton is that?
Mr. Beast is a legend 👍❤️
Yeah, now I'm just sad.
Think about the environment
Hmmm when life gives you lemons build a 5 ton flask and send it to space huh thought you were supposed to make lemonade
Mark is the Steve Irwin of science. He’s just so genuinely pure
Nice (:
You're the best !!!!!!❤️
Anyone else want a devil's toothpaste flask?
you told us the things to make devils tooth past
4:13 the usa military want to know your location
did he just make a scp jail cell
This looks like a high budget short film
The one thing about the orbeez pool is that if you go under, if you are not strong enough you would suffocate.
is the height measured from the top or the bottom of the flask?
It went much higher than the camera folks expected haha
Again
Omg finally
Iš it a fail its confetti
men you are my hero.    nothing more to say than cheers from Argentina
Always amazing videos you are an inspiration
Will it go higher with a smaller opening?  Having that much pressure forcing through a small window.. will it contributes more (outburst?). I WANNA KNOWW!!
Uploaded 2hrs ago and it’s already on 981k views ... INCREDIBLE
Mark Rober saves the world every single day
I think there is only one things we have to do > 👍
nice.
Mark, from the bottom of all of our hearts, thank you
Those kids are growing up to become scientists
I love your vids cep going you are the best
Mark you may be the best human on the planet.
Can we talk about the beautiful camera work in this video? I don't really know much about cameras and how to use them, but I can say that there were some really pretty shots in this video :D
what a great guy mark rober
Everybody when mark posts 🏃‍♂️🏃🏃‍♀️💨
I just got it. Mark is actually Santa
Mark is like mrbeast mixed with bill the Science guy
- 👍 👍 🔧
12:31 *gets world record* Mark: L
Cool video, but I always wonder; I how do you dispose of so many orbies and so much elephant toothpaste?
Who’s job was it to count the orbies
This background music is a vibe
Scrambled eggs @ 10:15
Mom what’s that green thing in the sky I don’t know 🤷‍♂️
OMG
What’s the cleanup process?
He makes fun with everybody ; especially with childrens!!!!
10:00 hmmmmm yes lava
Is anyone else jsut watching both the views and comments go up in real time
Algorithm
At 11:06 is the same song lethamyr uses for his intro
So what's stopping a billionaire from making one of these the size of a skyscraper that shoots foam into the upper atmosphere? If I was a billionaire that's the type of stuff I'd be using my money on lol.
Just watching Mark have as much fun as everyone is just epic!!
Pure joy
Gabin and Brodie look like future Nelkboys
I am wondering if you were to rifle the spout if the devils toothpaste would go even higher... or if a different sized nozzle would help.
Imma do this for my science fair
Almost nobody can put a years work into anything. Mark keeps trying and trying and always makes it happen
Technoblade: I would defiantly betray my friends for confetti Mark: I got you :P
Mark rober!!
I love that in 2 hours you are almost at a million views
You guys are the luckiest people alive!
Wow this video was amazing. Im so surprised you were able to come together with Mr. Beast and plant thousands of trees l to help save the planet. I never knew that YouTubers would be able to accomplish such thing, but it's amazing that there are truly amazing people out there.🙏
Well you defiantly avenged last years one that’s for sure
Now do an elephant toothpaste rocket!
In case you were wondering, Devils toothpaste is just regular elephants toothpaste but with highly concentrated peroxide instead of the normal 5%-10% concentration. Devils is closer to 50%
Nice one mark! Awesome video!
My weekends are not for crying Mark… I hate you ❤️
Awesome day.
next level elementary school volcano science project
I love how he spends his time just to make a kids day, it’s so wholesome
These videos are the best. I also can’t believe how the kid gave an atv to that kid
These videos are always so heartwarming :')
Hey mark I live next to gridley nice to see ur here
Mark rober: biggest elephent toothpaste blast ever Someone: now double it
There’s a special place in heaven for my Mark Rober
He's made better volcanoes than nature has at this point
who else went to google to find the formula of devils toothpaste?🤔😂
11:29 @Lethamyr intro song
Wow
when life give lemon... dead
My  most awaited videos come from this channel
Claim you not 7 years late ticket here     ⬇️
Mark went from trying to be the best uncle, to being the best human in the universe.
If only the world had more of this.
Brody's selflessness was such a beautiful thing to see.
What an excellent way to share your knowledge and resources. Bravo! Made my day just to watch the video. Can only imagine how great it felt for everyone involved.
The world doesn’t deserve Mark Rober.
Why ? 😦
Leth L
YOU DID IT MARK
Imagine that but with devils toothpaste
This was way more wholesome than I expected
A kid who deserves the world got the galaxy.
Woooooooooooo!!!! Great job!!!!
Faith in humanity restored
15:55 Helmet, Mark, Helmet!
Imagine flying in a plane looking down and seeing that 😮
I feel like if there was a nuclear apocalypse Mark would be the only one ready and being able to fix the world 🥰
YES! AHH THAT WAS A AWESOME VIDEO!
The wholesomeness of these videos is astonishing
Yea thats cool and all but can you please stop using feet or footballs as a unit of measure because no one knows what that means
He went from being the favorite uncle to everyone's favorite uncle.
I just wanted to know does your neighbours allowed you for the volcano 😂😂
I wonder how high the flask could be launched?
TO THE MOON !!!!
😻😻
A rocket but powered by elephants toothpaste
📉📈📈📈 what a childhood
Great youtuber
7:52 people after September:
delivered by the almighty dale himself
i recognize the lethamyr intro song
Mark is the cool uncle everyone wants to have!
WOW 🤩 I- I have nothing to say
simply awesome.
As always he over engineered it
I can't even imagine how long would it take to clean up that mess 😂
Too wholesome, can't handle it!
HE RECLAIMED HIS TITLE
1:56 "I even harnessed some child labor" 👏👏👏
This is the least I’ve ever hated draft kings….. it probably won’t last long.
legend
I’m never dis early.
the final product of the volcano looks, nice , smooth and satisfying great work mark!
this is so wholesome
question: can the next video be making the flask take off like a rocket....on purpose? I WANNA SEE AN ELEPHANT TOOTHPASTE POWERED SPACE STATION
I feel bad how brody's going but im always happy for brody and a great party
There is absolutely ZERO question that this is my favorite you tube channel. Mark is the GOAT
Next video: I activated an inactive volcano

That was beautiful and so heartfelt thank you 🙏👍✌️
20 second montages are op
So this is what he was working on for a whole month

Every time, your videos inspire me and remind me to continue building and learning. Thank you for the incredible videos.
Marc Rober does all of this so he can feel like a kid
Looks like we are in the sun 10:03 😂
I've never understood all that money wasted and pollution created…
I wanna diy on that orbeez tube
Godly
My science teacher was just talking about your slime experiment yesterday lol
Draftkings promotion? Seriously, online betting? How low has one fallen.
Almost 9k comments in 2 hours! Wow! Also, Mark manages to top himself every time
I like to see more diversity in your videos
you should make a model designed to fly int the air to see how high it will go.
You throw the best parties!
WOW
That was great. Couldn’t have happened to a better group of kids
The camera work on this video is freaking great Props to the whole team!
mark is out here just changing lifes, and everytime i see he post i drop anything im doing and watch a video.much love from texas.
Now what if he makes it all go out the bottom and makes a rocket
the shot at 14:00 is amazing
11:52 pause it and look at the foot
The flask reminds me of the Mercury Space Program Capsule lol
Mark Rober is a legend 🤟🏼
4k PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats to all who helped on this to become possible! ❤️😌
How do you clean all of that stuff 😮
Tbh many, people didn't understand some parts
you freaking did it mark!
Every viedeo u upload makes me happy i love to see whats coming next
Broccoli. That’s all I can say.
Maybe thats how to bring back dinos
You should team up with nilered to make a even more powerful version of devils toothpaste
How can this be so heart warming
the shot at 13:11 looks amazing
An enhanced setup of the experiment with more excitement.
Why don't your get in contact with scientists and ask them to merge a dog's dna with a bird egg
MrBeast will be proud of you…
Grate job you finaly did it
Brb gonna go buy a house in that city-
Amazing video!
Just wondering where those orbeez go afterwards...aren't they non biodegradable?
the red part of the devils thooth paist looks like crumbled up spicy cheetos
Next time you do elephant toothpaste, you should design it so it specifically functions like a rocket, and maybe get yourself a new world record by doing so...
When a girl touches my leg: 12:52
Next year mark Rober and mrbeast Launching elephant toothpaste to moon
Life as a big kid. I've got to say, it's SO MUCH BETTER putting your money, energy and efforts into a fun video and a day of making the lives of some kids better, than it would be to take put the resources into a brief ride to space. Well done Mark, well done.
get your 'here before 1m views' ticket
“So now all we needed was a 20-second build montage to it all done”  What is this, The A-Team?
hello there
I mean, if *I* were a food-coloring manufacturer, the purple would have some Potassium Permanganate in it.
I know I'm not the only one who heard mark as a siren 🚨 when the devil's toothpaste went off 🤣🤣🤣 someone make that a soundbite
Ayo mark rober
Bringing out the lethamyr music? Alright mark I see you
Mark out her exposing people
Lets get him to 20 mil
I quit at Mr beast...
Why not build a rocket with that as fuel?
13:12 me after taco bell
Mark Rober is the best person on earth.
imma need fletchers sisters @ rn
Pog!
If your freinds with mark your too lucky
This makes my heart happy. Thanks to you and EVERYONE who helped make this happen.
10:04 looks like scrambled eggs with cheese😂
Mark and jimmy are the most nicest person in the world
Maybe a smaller top opening would make it higher?
You should try making devils toothpaste rockets
ooo, that one worked much better!  Nice Job!
Awesome video. Thanks Mark
Geeze the editing this video is even better then his pay videos and his past videos were great!
no ones saying anything about how brody gave away his wish so another kid could be happy
12:58 pov you ate taco bell
I'm so happy for Mark that he has a team of people who support him and his ideas, not to mention his family and friends who hype him tf out!!
bro this is so unfair I love the slo-mos this birthday party is so cool 😂   also it's my bday on September 8th lol
Someone has to tell mr beast
i just got a big smile during this video :)
If only there were more people like you out in the world
Why is this dude just so great, like he wakes up in the morning and goes, time to make the world a better place
That white limbo someone literally used the smudge tool on
poggers
The devils toothpaste clearly uses highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide.
You should make a Elifent tooth past ROCkET
I wonder where he gets the money to make these stuff
Amazing video
Imagine Mark was your uncle.. madness

The red and orange looked like lava and the yellow looks like scrambled eggs

Props to the drone guy for the amazing shots!
I love your videos!!!!!!
And this was the start of my giant science experiment theme park
how is that accordion sounding music at the start of the video called
You have the best YouTube channel.   Period.
Wowww
I love how the original title was worlds tallest slime volcano lol
20 mil 20 mil 20 mil commet if ya agree ❤️  👇

This week on mark builds a volcano
I totally agree!!!
Omg!!!!!!!
“What if I spent the year spending my time to make a *5 ton (10000lb) flask that can 360 no scope any one that it falls on wiping there source code*
You guys are incredible 👏
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Wow this was so cinematic, nice camera work there
Mark..there will never be time to give you the amount of love and hugs you deserve that puts the time and love you do into these projects! Just seeing these children's smile makes me at least go down on my knees for the reverence you deserve!  Then it does not make things worse that you do it in a cool way..
Mark is re-Mark-able
Finally, Hiropaste.
This was wholesome
how much he works on science is amazing!
If you le it decompose in the ground is it bad for the planet?
Mark would be the uncle to say “Let’s to rent Elon Musk”
This guy is not human he's super genuis villian
Rip cameras
13:01
This was so cool and therapeutic!
Mark Rober 🐐
I demand this to be a yearly thing
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I dont get it, why does this kid get all these things?
it's amazing how NONE of this would've been possible like 20-30 years ago
insane stuff
I dunno personally I'd like some more engineering and less kids birthday party
The real question is : is it reusable?
this video is so heartwarming that i dont know anyway to describe it
Mark’s experiments always look like they are from a sci-fi movie. Nice wholesome videos though.
Your engineering and the team are amazing!!! This what community is and should be. U created a massive community building and showed the love and the awesome side of people . So excited that the elephant toothpaste didn't get u this time!! Thank u so much for u and your family and team for being such a shinning light in this world. Much love and never change!!!
one thing is for sure, when you have mark as a friend, it well never get boring 😁
sheesh that IS HIGH👌
you need to make a elaphant toothpaste gun
You rock!
Imagine having a person like Mark in ur family dang it would be lit
More accurate: When life gives you lemons... Change a kids life.
devil toothpaste requires a catalyst like potassium iodide or yeast, hydrogen peroxide, and soap to get started
20000000 Trillion uncle points.
Hello
You are the definition of cool  Simply cool
Meanwhile me watching them having all the fun in the world
yo fletchers sister 😏
<3
wow!
Rober is the type who would be a professional ghost buster
Nothing like watching other people have fun while is sit here and watch....
Is it just me or does anybody else feel like vomiting when thinking about orbeez
That kids sister is fit yano
Looked like lava on that first big devils toothpaste one
Mark can you be my dad?
To quote my favorite Red Dwarf episode...who's going to clean up the mess?
Mark`s videos never disappoint always fun and teach you something
Ngl fletcher now looks like deku
Yo, you are so underrated and deserve so much more then what you have. Really love the vids you make. I can understand this science but not schools science though.
I want to know how much this cost
ugh crazy Nabors
can we launch ourselves with that..?
This. This is quality utube video.
Not to be a party pooper, but I'm curious what the criteria is for the ET rising?  The initial pressure will sent it up but after it fluffs out and becomes separate small tufts, it is not much heavier than air and then the gust from the secondary wave of ET would push it higher. Does that still count? I guess you could say it's the same as if it was one long continuous column with the lower part of the column being pushed then pushes the upper part up.
The only question Mark asks is "How can this get bigger"
that's not foam that's cu😳
13:01 oh that is why they called it elephant toothpaste
Lethamyr's intro anyone?
broncos
When life gives you lemons you make a battery for a car
When er make a mistake we Think and learn but you had to do it over
Love Your content.
Mark Rober never fails to restore my faith in humanity
Congrats to the people who suddenly saw this and saw this and  clicked this and saw it was actually mark rober
You did it. You crazy son of a beach you actually did it!
Insaneee🔥🔥
BRUH
Today it’s my birthday
Mark Rober ran out of niblings to surprise so he had to get new kids to make happy, and I'm all for it.
😢
fully inflated football as a measure of pressure? Americans will do anything to avoid the metric system, lol
I'd estimate the whole thing costed ... 100,000$ if you don't even factor in the human kindness involved where people did favors and help. IF you factor all that in.. maybe closer to half a million. Am I close?
Yooo finally done
Who else caught the +5 uncle points thing
What would have happened if you narrowed the mouth of the flask
Why do I wanna swim in the elephant toothpaste?
9:52 You can't have a G major chord on strings and NOT let it be Nessun Dorma.
Yeah saints
POOOOOGGG!
+1 uncle points lol 😂
Next year it's going to be on the Moon.
People should use these for baby reveal parties
mark rober
Amazing editing wow
When life gives you a Mark Rober video.. watch it..
Nice party
Kudos to the editing.  And as always spectacular work sir.
Six months later mark is going to fill a dormant volcano with elephant toothpaste
Is this lava 10:03 xD
Every time I watch one of your videos, my faith in humanity is restored. The fact that so many people came together to accomplish one goal is outstanding.
Mark is the epitome of a perfect human being
Any1 else gonna talk about how long it must’ve taken to sort the correct colour of orbeez in the correct places to make that logo at the end? Like, that takes dedication
Bruh mark how are you so cool
Stop clickbaiting us by always actually doing much more you tell in the title... lol
850k views in 2 hours  Madnesss
wow
+1 Uncle Point
Don't know Mark personally, but he seems like a truly generous and kind person.
The epic party montages is like a geometry dash level with 10/10 sync, especially the part where Mark shoots that cannon thing.
Mark is just too cool
mrbeast the money giver is gooyupled
I think he went a bit overkill on the world record
Science sure us beautiful
Wow. This was a blast to watch
I love how constant mark is uploading!!
I’m losing count of how many world records this legend has under his belt✨✨
when life gives you a mark rober video...watch it (just watch it)
Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity.
That kid was totally not surprised.
Omg I can't believe it's been a year since the surprise party! It doesn't feel so long ago
You should have just used the Russian space capsule from Gilligans island.
Wow
Do you wanna ride C=2 neutral in a Tesla, or shall we take a private jet for 1.5h carride...
Pog champ
Will you ever stop making history
you know it´s a mark rober video when there is a concrete foundation for elephant toothpaste
I love your videos and I am inspired to work in the field of science when I grow up thanks to you
Nice
thank you for making my day better
Almost 1 million views in 2 hours.. unreal

Imagine being able to say: yeah I met Mark Rober and broke a couple of world records, flew in a private jet, rode in a limo, went in a pool of orbies, set off a couple bombs and met mr beast in one day.
I’m sorry but I just can’t ignore the channel logo at 3:02.
Wish he was my uncle :(
The effort put into these kind of videos ♡
Tell Nerk amazing drone flying!
whenever a mark rober vidoe comes out my heart warms up
That last tube was basically a volcano XD
Wow!!
Mark, what can I say - you generosity and heart for blessing kids in a tough place is inspirational and absolutely amazing.  Thanks so much for lighting up their lives, and providing such an incredible channel to boot.  From an Onco Dad blessed to have his child in remission 👏👍😃
Mark needed his record back from Mr. Beast lol after he helped him beat his own record 😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
C'mon dude private jet is a bad example

Brody actually gave away his atv respect
LETS GOO you did it 😀😀😀 I saw the video of when u did the kids birthday I can't stop watching it I am very happy for you 😁
YESSSSS!
Even with cost engineering this probably cost north of $50k. Worth every penny.
-wake up -see a new Mark Rober video -faith in humanity restored
Mark is low key ripped tho
yessir
Did anyone else notice that funny scream at 4:19?
So cool
dude... your a badass for doing stuff like this.
I'm crying 😭 Mark you're a hero.
Okk
I always forget how underrated you are, every time I watch a video expecting to scroll down and see the subscriber count at 50m+
You should  invite the. Squirrels to the walnut farm 🤣
What’s that? New montage music??🤩
Next objective: Launch Elephant Toothpaste into outer space.
chug jug with you
Next year: devil toothpaste in a 15 tons flask
He over here is doing science well I am over here watching his videos laying on my couch
I feel so bad for that lifeguard....
💡
You are the reason I chose to take engineering in school
Mark what you did was one of the nicest things i have ever seen It was so kind of you to set this up and to bring people so much joy and i would like to also say thank you to all the people who helped mark expecting nothing in return it was just so kind and made many people happy even if they weren't there and just watching this video
imagine being a bird and getting clapped by green slime volcano
Hah kaboom go up
Comment.
This is the best thing EVEEERR
The odd ones out, Matpat, and now mark rober! Holy crap!
We've been waiting for this.
Heyyyy
Mark is probably the coolest family members in his family
Amazing video
Mark is an amazing person, and still manages to entertainingly teach me more than a months worth of school.
I truly love watching these videos even though I know I won’t get experience any of this.Seeing Mark ry so hard to give a kid the great3st memory in their life. That makes me wanna cry G.
Bruh
those blokes definitely deserve having all this party and stuff held for 'em, especially considering the stuff they'd been through
I wish that was me :( that looks so fun
Now imagine the same thing with devils toothpaste
mark is built different
If Mark could be everyone's uncle, just maybe the world would become a better place.
hi mark just hi
CLEVELAND ROCKS!
YES!!!!
When will we be able to ride the Hyperloop?
I was having a bad day til I saw that mark rober uploaded :D
Am i the only one that counts to 20 when he says that’s how long the montage is 😂
Coming from a Saints fan, you love to here your favorite YouTuber talk about someone on your team.
Ahh yes my daily dose of youtube hit videos that provide no benefit whatsoever and are only for entertainment and that get millions of views for no reason other than it is visually stimulating and it is from a popular youtuber
Next using devils toothpaste build a rocket or try to get something into space or obit
Mark is the guy who buys 50 carts of apples in the math problems
What a wholesome and amazing video🌟
The Fletcher video was awesome, but this blows it out of the water. Well done, sir.
Dang high dude
Too bad he only uploads once a month, but ngl it makes u wait for the next video and the suspense keeps building up
YAY MARK POSTED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video was definitely neeto mosquito
These videos are sooo worth waiting for! :)
Mark Rober is still such a child......and I'm here for it!!
Fan since 800k!
literally the coolest guy ever
"50 times the force you fell when you're pushing against a fully inflated football"  What? Don't get me wrong, I love your videos, and a comparrison to make something more easily understandable is nice too, but why not pair it with the actual measured number & the unit it was measured in?
Thanks Mark
Slime? is this some type of joke or is it just for the clicks?
great video! yikes sponsor lol
This is why I love this channel. Mark could make any YouTube video but instead he puts his time and effort into rewarding someone who truly deserves it. We need more people like Mark in the world
Amazing content
imagine having Mark Rober as uncle
Mark Rober for president!  Mr Beast  as Secretary of the Treasury 😆
e
wow your video quality in vidoes are just keep getting better! another amazing video of the best youtuber
Ur a legend
I think the devils toothpaste contain high concentration hydrogen peroxide because it ignites organic material on contact
hi
I am not cleaning that
I wish u could do this for my cousin but you are probably live far a way from me and him
I'll put this video on ×0.25 speed and leave it running
epic
WOW...
"I FINALLY DID IT" no no no no, you GUYS finally did it. gotta give credit where credit is do! (only half joking but still, amazing job!)
I like it how  Mark reacted even more excited about the devil toothpaste and elephant toothpaste than the kids
Thankyou so much for these videos, my son always asks when the next one will be out and you have made him really interested in engineering.
Fun fact. This is Mark Rober's 100th public video on his channel.
Your for sure going to heaven. Stay high King 👑
Back to the walnut Farm for another showcase of Mark's kindness
Deja vu
You are Awesome.
With the zoomed in slowmotion it looked like a brain😂
Nice job
Why I’m crying
If this was a GWR, then Congrats Mark
Science changes lives.
Can you make a mini mars rover  that gets its power from sun
Thank you! Mark Rober and MrBeast for spreading so much love 💘
Some astronauts going to be looking down at earth, and just be thinking, “Mark is at it again”
Dear Mark, not only you're a brilliant Engineer but an absolutely beautiful human too. Respect.🙌🙌🙌
It’s so sad that mark rober died of sugma last year
wwooww
So how much force is a “fully inflated football”
9:42 he sounded like a fire truck
Your so Awesome! Your. Definitely the best uncle
Im early! For once im early!
you are one amazing persone
This. Is. Amazing.
but how do they clean it up...??
The question was, could there be a perfect YouTube video? The answer was yes.
Mark is the most awesome dad ever. Hands down.
Mark Rober…the Bill Nye for the YouTube generation…our kids need more people like them! 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
SLIME?
The foam mechanism was called foam daddy
Faidherbe square!!!
Best video yet
When you said private jet, I thought you said pregnancy test lol
Orbies?
Mark and Mr Beast litererally are the gods of the youtube agorithm
i wish my birthday was like that, but that kid deserved it.
It's the highlight of my day to see stuff like this. Incredibly awesome science, mixed with such a wholesome and kind motivation. ❤
Omg!
How tf does dream have more subscribers than this guy?
This just made me smile 😊
I literally broke down in tears.  Mark You are by far a remarkable human being. The world needs more and more people like you.  Thanks Mark
Hint: the catalyst is Nitric acid.
when the wide shot isn't wide enough
ok
Nice Work.
:O
Wow mr beast only has an iPhone 11
II wonder how high it would go if the lid had a seal to build up some pressure before releasing.
Can we take a minute to appreciate this guy for never clickbaiting us
Sheesh moment
Yay new
Hi
I would have gone for option 1 though. 😉
Love how they drank that water in the limo as if it was wine
12:52
❤❤❤
Only Mark Rober gets 1 mil views in 2 hours
Mark rober is just one big kid playing with other kids and I love it
11:13 HEY THATS THE LETHAMYR SONG, WAHT SONG IS THIS I WANNA KNOW
This was great
I wonder how potassium permanganate would work as a catalyst. It was used when rockets were build harnessing hydrogen peroxide as fuel.
I imagine what the police and fire dept would be like if they saw that
YES
Slightly teary-eyed after the ending :)
mark you're literally the best person
The fact that the devil's toothpaste just bursts into flames upon touching organic matter suggests that there's manganese heptoxide in the formula.
7:44 ayo
Wow i should build this for our underground and should be bomp proof Sheeesshh
Simply amazing
12:46 there you guys go
I cant be the only one who notice that in one of the montages he used the song that lethamyr uses in his intro
😍🙌
How to Mark Rober: Dexter's laboratory + Ed Edd n Eddy + KND + a lot of nonsensical humans with dedication = this man's experiments
That was CRAZY ! Congrats! ❤️
You brought an immune compromised kid to a massive pool party in the middle of a pandemic?
I say it every month, but this might be one of the best videos yet
That was a close call with the drone: almost shaved his sole.
11:28 Leth…?
Legend for a reason..
What if he did this but had all of the toothpaste come out of the bottom to see how far up he could launch a 1 ton flask?
He needs more subcribers
Karma is a thing
Love you Brody
2 hour ago
Single most wholesome thing I've ever watched
The video we all wanted!
Pov: you have too much time on your hands lol
12:58  After seeing my crush
I love this video
Beautiful
Cant wait for Mark Rober to get his party
:0 cool
Did you invite Fat Gus to the party?
Ah yes my favorite pressure unit... the fully inflated football
Lets go new video!
Liked and commented for the algorithm to pick this video up
600k views, and only 100k people can like the video?
The simplistic page unfortunatly label because mosque trivially follow like a stiff period. icky, delirious authorization
Mark Rober, you should make a production site because you need to make more of this stuff
We need a Mark Rober devil's toothpaste emoji
I pray that when you say this is all ok for the earth, you’re being honest. I know how much time and effort you put into these videos, so I assume you’re being earth friendly.
Mark Rober makes the world a better place to live
Legend
@David Dobrik has 36 hours to respond.
Now this is awesome
Mark Rober is basically the coolest uncle who has ever lived
You are the best YouTuber of all time <3 'Cause you went far more further than just YouTube, you give joy to people :D
It's the home stretch! Almost to 20 million!
Whenever a new mark rober video comes out I freak out and instantly tap on it you’re my favorite YouTuber of all YouTubers  and it’s probably never going to change

Hold up when mark was talking about how he made the tanks of devils toothpaste, did he accidentally give away the formula?
Just changed the title
Banger
great video mark love your content
Please consider the environment when making these videos. No true scientist uses words like private jet.
Mr beast 6000
he is a scientist that works in NASA and built a rober that goes to mars
Love this your so kind , wish I had someone kind in my life lol
I love mark he is nice
Mark really just had to one up the other kids party lmao what a punch in the gut
There are at least 680 miserable people watching this video
Ur just so EPIC
Awesomeness!
Yellow elephant toothpaste looks like scrambled eggs.
I feel like crying just seeing this. ;-;     : )
Ay
Mark would probably buy 262 watermelons to post a meme of the guy in math problems
And thanks to you for uploading
Can you be my uncle
LOVE YOU MARK!! ❤️❤️
I wish Mark was my uncle.
Oompa Loompa Willy Wonka   - Look at the words during the party montage.
He:has a super Nice party Me:had only a happy birthday on my birthday and no special stuff
Just heard Lethamyr’s intro in this vid.
overpowered.....
Now I know why the steel and wood prices got so high recently… 🤓
Yeayyyy!
Your videos are either the most chaotic or wholesome things and I'm here for them either way
Next you should make the toothpaste rocket!!!
Wow perfect mark Rober
HE FINALLY DID IT!!
This guy is the #1 Uncle of the Year
Super epic 👍
Mark’s 20 second montages are the best
I know Mark's channel isn't so much about directly learning as it is seeing amazing things and wanting to discover on your own, however I'm slightly disappointed when we've gotten all the way down to comparing pressure to footballs. It's obvious that's because of the sponsor, however I would've liked to have the actual pressure reading, and maybe even see the pressure graph next to the column of elephant toothpaste. Would've been mighty interesting. I feel like were losing the 'scientific' aspect of the channel slowly.
+1uncle point? +1000000 everything point
All the kids are having so much fun but his nephews just act like it’s a Tuesday
I happy when u upload
What if Mark made an elephant toothpaste rocket 🤨
Mark Rober is an absolute saint
"Hey honey! What's that noise?" "Our neighbour's making a volcano" ... "Not again"
😳😳 MrBeast 😎
He did it
OMG Mr beast
Marking that i was here for when the next one comes out
I’m kinda early
You’re a genius with a heart of gold. Fantastic video and super generous of everyone who contributed to make it all happen.
I swear this mans cpm is like 700 dollars per 10 views
When life gives you lemons, make this lol 😂
The while video I was wondering who was doing those smooth FPV drone moves. Freakin' shout out to Nurk! I should've known.
Why was there dummies all over the set lol
It's absolutely amazing how Mark takes his own personal goals and ideas and can make it such an amazing experience for other people to enjoy with him. Mark is, and will forever be, one of the greatest humans to ever exist. Thank you Mark for all you done for all of us here on earth, and beyond.
You have like the most wholesome content on the whole internet. Awesome ❤️
ayo no one gonna talk about how he did that 7:49 😳😳😳
Excuse me "friend Mr Beast"
The best YouTuber, prove me wrong
Mark Rober, you are an amazing human being... Thank you for being so awesome!! 🙏🌈❤️ Much love Brother-
i've gotta get the guiness world record book with him in it
YAY
There are sometimes that I don't have faith in humanity, but watching Mark's videos when all of these people come together to help, with no thought of reward, does help bring back some of that faith.  Keep up the great work!!
the party i will never have
i thought i had only watched 1 minute of the video but i looked at the time bar and saw 10 minutes. time flies when your having fun
This is the first time I actually like science
Now put devils toothpaste in the a mega flask.
Almost as tall as godzilla
I love the lethamyr music
gfgfg
Mark Rober, you made me smile for 17mins straight. 🙂
Literally nobody outside of the US understands the reference of "50 fully inflated footballs" xD
Wouldn't it matter how hard u push a football. Because the harder u press it the more the pressure. So saying it's 50x more then pushing on a football makes no sense.
We have finally found the guy from the math problems
Mark u think it’s strong enough to push me up?
My BFF: "Bro my uncle is like the coolest person in the world!"  If Mark was my Uncle  Me: shows his channel
My birthday is in a few days
You are probably one of the nicest people on the planet
Mark Rober eaters estrogen burgers
Next thing Mark is going to do is replicate the Yellowstone volcano for his devil's toothpaste. And hopefully not cover half of america in 5 seconds
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🎈
Awesome Video. Too bad about youtube's compression algorithm just giving some shots the big thumbs down.
What would happen if you put devils toothpaste in there?  13:43
im glad he brought fletcher back 😁🙏
World's coolest Youtuber and world's coolest uncle
Love your vids
I love that the foam gun is called foam daddy
My birthday September in a few days
The carbon  footprint  added for a 12min private jet and we then have people think climate change can be solved by driving a Tesla
+1 uncle points? let's be honest here mark we all know you maxed out that skill long ago
i was waiting for this SO LONG i watched the other video years ago hoping for this to come and here it is
YESSS DRAFTKINGS is amazing
fricking love this guy
I rilly need to be a kid in that party but I am not a kid eny more :-(
Love you bro!!! Thank you so much for being such a great person in life!!!!!
Alright Mark when I first started watching your videos I thought youvwere a pretty cool guy. I have now come to the conclusion that you are a very cool guy. Keep on keepin on
The fastest 17 minutes of my life
If you're new here. Welcome to NASA: Next Generation
I want to see someone else try to take this record back.  And then Mark just come back next month like, "Yo what up?"
He died later that day
What was the PSI reading during the reaction?  Great idea to put a sensor in there.
You’re friends with Mr. beast?
In before 1 mil views. In before 10 mil views. In before 50 mil views probably lol.
So what's the specific impulse of this rather, ehh, colorful rocket engine? :) Great stuff as always, nice with the occasional uplifting ones among all the depressing ones these days.
MrBeast 😯👍😮
Early? Also this reminds me of the devils toothpaste
Mark Robert need to do a video with bill nye
U r so amazing and thank you for all of your vids

What happens if you make elephant toothpaste in space?
Cool
ye
You spend so much time on your videos and yet u somehow manage to upload so often.
16:10 the guy was trying to shake your hand and you just said nope and just hugged him
Summed up in three words:  Bros being Bros.
Next video: turn the flask upside down and make a rocket
Bruh why mark got me cryin at lunch
The legend strikes again with another world record.
A little sus how he's so focused on kids.
Mark out here making our days better
The editing is top notch
HES BACK
We need more people like mark
WAIT SERIOUSLY A BUNCH OF MY FAV YOUTUBERS ARE POSTING ON MY BIRTHDAY!
Brody sounds like a great kid
I can't help but imagine what would it be if Mark Rober is my dad...  1. I can either have all sorts of fun with his inventions.  2. Have a hard life living because I need to live up to his expectations or be better than him.
No one:  Mount Vesuvius 79 CE:
make an elephant toothpaste rocket.
How does 647 people not like this video? Love your videos mark keep it up
Wow this editing is so epic!
sickvid
Devil: being kind will get you no where in life Mark and Brody: are you sure about that
As epic as a dancing cow on the moon
I’ve been waiting for another video
lol
wow mr best
“Hi youtube”-fletcher
hi
I thought that you wouldn't tell the formula for devil's toothpaste
How's phatgus doing
Absolutely amazing! 💢💥 I wonder how much higher it would have gone if the neck was choked a little smaller. Since you made it a permanent structure maybe you could test it and see. 👁👁
Meanwhile in 2050: *I built a elephant toothpaste thing taller than the Burj Khalifa*
When I watch marks video I think there's so way he can top this and he does
Yes! Always be kind and give to others not because of what you'll get  but to bless them. It may eventually come around. 😌
glad for the kid
Classic Mark, making people happy and sciencing :)
Solid video. Huge heart. World needs more like you folks. You got another subscriber to the list
Mark Rober: *Breathes* Nieces & Nephews: *Mom! Uncle and Friends are making a title sequence!*
Yesss a new upload
Yes I want foam daddy for this party
the other people in the waiting room: awkward silence
When knowledge meets entertainment, you get Mark Rober.
bravo just bravo
I cried once again
Giving a pressure measurement as "times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football" gotta be the most american thing ever
The world needs more Mark Robers in it
Woah….. that’s one more reason why science is my favorite subject 😂 this is amazing though and I love how your all doing it for the people who deserve it! ❤️
This was honestly so sweet of you but the editing on this was just *chefs kiss*
You need to throw a surprise party for Mr. Beast
literal scientific Mr beast 👏🏽🧪
Woooooooow
This was well worth the time and effort that Mark put in.
Cooooooool
Amazing, leave a comment, help with algorithm:)
Bro he really went  KA MA HA MA HA WAVE
What an awesome memory for those kids!
I am 2 hours late :'(
but like, how do you clean that up????
Wow
mark bro it's ok you're already the coolest uncle you proved that years ago lmfao
7:22  What the teacher thinks we did over the summer
I swear every time you touch that walnut farm the land value goes up haha
It’s time to try this with devil’s toothpaste.
I don't always give a thumbs up.. but today I did.
The world needs more communities like this people come out and help.  Rare to see that or hear about it
you can tell when mark rober is suprised its awesome
I used to live in Gridley
Mr.beast
Gotta love the Colt 45 banjo music in this video. 2:31
This makes me wanna cry, it's so heartwarming. Congrats Mark, You earned it.
So what do you do with the flask after that? And the orbeez?
Pog
You should make a squirrel maze 3.0
This video shows you that no matter how bad life is going for you someone will be there to make you happy again. If that's not enough to make you cry then I don't know what will 😢😢😢
It’s almost not fair how satisfying the slo-mo in this is.
Nickelodeon: I WANT TO TANE YOUR Whole  STOCK
Hi
hello rober
Dang im finally early for a mark rober video
I love how Mark uses his fame and resources to just be the best of dudes.
Mark Rober you are the most amazing human in the world. I wish there were more people as generous as you who give kids the most amazing gifts and memories!
We have the next holy trinity here: Mr Beast and Mark Rober. Whos gonna be the art idol?
No wonder this guy is from NASA... he's sending this stuff to space
Mark Rober, the Ted Lasso of Youtube. ❤️
Every Mark Rober video: what if I did it but better
Best vid yet
this guy would shower every person on earth with as much fun as he could give them if he was able to
The most epic prank would've been to fill the elephant's toothpaste with bioweapons
8:00 the little kid was wearing a Tommyinnit merch
2021: slime volcano 2472: slime earth
What a legend
lets goo
So did they find the guy who stole the ATV?
These elephants have huge teeth
YES
POV:you wish that was you
best vid ever
what a boring video, i came to see a green volcano, what i got was a boring hose thats contaminated
14:18 I don’t think the guy standing at the base is alright.. 💀😭
Science + Great Human = Mark Rober = Awesome + infinity. Just sayin’ in all…
To say that the slime went high is a understatement
Imagine if it was a birth reveal
wow
Excellent video I hope you’re able to do this kinda thing every year for some deserving kids.
Mark is like the uncle everyone wants
i just love watching this kinds of vids
13:00 Are we not gonna talk about how that kinda sounds like an elephant? IDK if they added that in post or what.  Also at 13:18 you can tell the flask sprung a couple leaks. It stayed together but the elephant toothpaste was trying it's hardest.
mark is such a amazing guy
How much $?!?
Heyyy
Marks just a big, smart, kid
at 9:58 it looks like close up images of the sun
If only all the celebrities of the world took their time and influence to help the less fortunate.  Bless you, Mark.
ultra op fire
marks the type of guy to be a better teacher than that one guy from india
It’s sad that I have to watch other people have fun to be happy
Im early but how the heck does a vid have 700k + views in 2hours? youtube is broken i swear-
1 mill in 2 hrs how is this not trending
2 hours and it's already near a million.
I lovve build montages
OMG GREAT VIDEO WOW
it is scientifically impossible to not like him
im not even halfway but i love you did this for the kids mark , keep beeing positive its catching !
Potassium permangenate?
mark rober witht the devil's toothpaste accidentally inventing a new weapon of war
Ladies and gentlemen, and that’s why you hire an FPV pilot.
Mark.  I need your help on something...wellllll, its been worked on for so long and I feel I have the answer.  For security purposes I will not say what.  I really need your help tho!
It's been 2hr and it 700k views
9:51 drone look like ufo lol
i'd spend anything in the world for something like this. This day of the kids where the best for sure.Congrats too you, for making this whole thing and everyone who helped.
youve created memorys for these kids that most dont get, and its beautiful that your this kind of person, the will remember this forever.
Best science teacher ever! probably even better than senku ishigami
Seeing Mark scared of a kid with paint on his hands makes me happy lol
Cool. But I hope all that was cleaned up.
''Mark Rober'' Is a living Legend! of this Century <3
O love your views so much
I wonder how many uncle points mark rober has
14:13 Proof #1 patriarcal society exists, the girl it's the last one to be highfived
So heartwarming and wholesome. I loved it. YOU ARE THE BEST.
i love your videos
“Pushing against a fully inflated football” that the most American unit o have ever heard
Mark knows how to make people jelous
Amazing
Totally decadent.
The sister kinda badd doeeee
Increíble
Mark never disappoint us with every upload
that was epic
7:30 that was smoooth . . .
Awesome 🤩
Brother you are absolutely astounding in so many ways. In a world that can have so many downsides you makes incredibly wonderful things happen. I'm happy to share this segment on the cosmic timeline with you.
Bruh this guy is just Cave Johnson 3
Not a comment for the algorithm

Green tower of awesome.  Thanks Mark for today's dose of goodness.
Impossible to watch a Mark Rober video without your heart being significantly warmer after
That’s what i call satisfying
“This is my come.” -Funny Meme
great vid, made my day :)
they should just make elephant toothpaste fireworks 💥
Awesome and wholesome. But… how do you clean all of this?
Too Much Volcano!
I just realized I’m not subbed to mark rober.😰
another great video and cause, to motivate me to Rise and Shout !!!  Great video Mark and Gridley et al... you really did a great thing ...
What if you made a devil's toothpaste rocket?
Is this video the most watched Youtube video ever? Not yet as of this comment. But the reader of the comment can tell us below.
Mark is really generous since he helps people with disorders
This video title could be replaced with, "How white can white people get?"
Amazing to see how you brig people together with science.
'
Who new that all you needed was a 20 second build montage to finish something that would have taken a person with no montage several day’s
As always it is a wonderfull video!
My peanut brain is too small to comprehend anything
Your so cool
Wow that’s so cool
wouldn't making the top of the flask thinner make it go higher?
Amazing
3:41 Mark channeling Captain Disillusion against that video.
Cool, nice Mark
Can you teach us how to do devils toothpaste?
American way...
We should put the dislikers in that flask
I wish I was there
*imagine just taking a walk and seeing a atomic green confetti beam over your shoulder*
Let's go Mark is best elephant or what ever it's called toothpaste thingy person
someday mark will chande the life gives you lemons to when life gives you lemons something that he thinks of lol
These kids will never know how lucky they are :)
2:25 my names jeff
I’m convinced Mark was sent from the future to speed us up a bit.
Literally in the 17:08 it took me to watch this, so did 90,000 more people. Great video Mark!!
I think everyone wanted to see this video. Well done Mark!
Mark.... You are my spirit animal
Best vid yet mark is so nice to other people :)
Marks that uncle we wish we all had
Great Job, you are truly an inspiration. Thx for all the content, I will forever be subbed to you and I wish that you reach 20mil soon
Haha one of the songs is the same as Lethamyr’s intro
THAT IS CRAZY
I like the idea of, "It always comes back."   I don't care if comes back to me either.  It's nice to hear someone else say such a thing, so THANKS for being you!
Who ever is doing the camera work and the drone pilot need a rise!
Mark already has the world record for elephant toothpaste but watch next year he’s going to top that 😌
Guinness World Records, where you at?
I the stuf more tan mrbeast
The YouTube compression algo chokes hard on things like that lovely slo mo footage of the elephant's toothpaste. Any chance you could upscale to 4K and upload. The SloMo Guys proved pretty well that the higher bitrate helps significantly, even if the source footage is only 1080p.
This  GUYS HAS GONE REALLY MAD OVER THESE YEARS
So this is why he hasn't been on Safety Third yet.
Never underestimate Rober tenacity!!
"Where is the camera?" "In the middle" "Aight got it" bruh XD
That’s amazing I’m taking Marks engineering class
I feel like Mark is as much an engineer as he is a cinematographer Well done with the editing!
Uncle points +1 LMAO
This is - - wholesome. Nuff said.
Make the worlds largest Coke and mentos experiment!
tagtasgasRBGASBWJH
remember when you used to do science stuff
this really makes me wonder wth he's capable of 😂
TELL US THE FORMULA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was so beautiful 🥰
ty MARK AND WOW WHAT AN AMAZING STORY. GREAT JOB EVERYONE!!!!!!
*"I" finally did it ???*   Wow .......... how selfish !
I refuse to believe not one kid consumed atleast 1 orbez
Bless your heart Mark. Loving the content and all you do to make people happy
Mark, you have one of this world's greatest souls... continue to be relentlessly genuine and you will change the world in measurable ways.
very diverse party 😐
But it's soooo cool and I hope Brody is ok
That was EPIC!!!
We need more people like mark in this world
This is the reason why people you should fall in love with engineering.
I remember when I use to smile like that
when something so fun you had to do it twice  but sill doe i wish i was there  13:17 look at that compared to the safety thing and the house
Never cease to amaze mark, you gave brody something he will remember forever! Topping it off with a new quad from mr beast was the icing on the cake.
How are you not the best??? I think....he is
Woah.
the golden rule
Two minutes in an I'm already tearing up. Thank for showing the human side of humans and having a lot of fun doing it Mark.
Mark Rober is the hero we need.
Noice
...woah
fletcher brings nothing to the table besides his sister
Yay
Looks edited but it's not
I love those heartwarming videos
the most impressive part is how he funds it all with sponsors & tax writeoffs
I wish i had a child hood like this
the military is gonna ask how to make devils toothpaste lol
What about devils thothpaste in that flask
Making this in 2 months  wow
Mark Robber and Mr.Beast collab is really not what I thought we would have but it’s definitely what we needed

I love your vids but sometimes it’s not environmentally friendly. Those orbeez are just 🤦🏻‍♂️
Aka new ammo for porch pirates.
I heard like a whistling sound when the flask shot the toothpaste into the sky. I was wondering what made that sound.
Mark rober is real genius
666=god's number
Now use devils tooth paste
Awesome vid
Mark rober should surprise a school by being there science teacher for a week
YOOOOOOO
How satisfying is it to hear “ And thanks to you for watching”
the world needs more ppl like Mark .... what a beautiful person... :D
Hi
Mr beast reacts
Mark rober went ham on that guy
Am I the only one who finds it really cool that there's so much skill and experience here like who else just finds a pro carpenter welder and even backhoe driver
4:28 nitric acid confirmed ?
Unbelievable.
My mans was losing his voice   As he should of been 😂
This is what happens if you dare that science kid in school to do something ridiculous
This took playing with slime to a whole new level.
Mark is legit one of the best people out there in this world
Now watch mr beast  somehow make a taller one
what if someone layed down over the top of the flask and just get blasted to space
I KNEW MR BEAST WAS COMING UP!! I love videos like these they make me really happy! nwn
When I first saw Mark's videos, I thought he was kind of a cheeseball. Now he's one of my cheeseball superheroes.
you are, an incredible human being. Thank you.

You have way to much fun! :)
Love what you do Mark!

Brody is sooooo poggers
I swear if you need to make anything from weapons to houses me and my dad with be glad to help

my brain isn' t ready for his information i can' t handle his words idk what it means anymore
Who els was like wait is that leth’s intro when they were jumping in the pool
any rocket league players realise he used lethamyrs intro music?
Best youtuber ever!
Beginning of a Mark Rober video: *science* Middle of a Mark Rober video: *action* End of a Mark Rober video: *happy endings*
The science behind it is cool but why Mark Rober does it is even cooler
The too frequent YouTube advertising totally destroys this amazing video
foam cannon guy: how much foam do you want? mark: yes
ok
1:20 Who tf did that speak up
Question: how do you guys clean this up?
Congratulations Mark rober for the Guinness world record
Congratulations Mark, you did it. Im proud of you.

Cows who mistake the toothpaste for grass: Why is it spicy?
I just love the total overkill
"A succesful life is when you leave the world, better than you found it"

Mark is humble, Mark loves science, Mark cares for the community. Be like Mark. Make a Mark in this world.

Money Brings Happiness This İs An İmmutable Truth And That's Why I'll Never Be Happy Living in Turkey
Mark Rober must start a science amusement park. It would be so awesome. His passion is so infectious.
Some UFO enthusiasts seeing that from a distance are wondering why the green creatures are pooping upwards with that amount of force
Cool

I see you have discovered the magic of FPV drones
Funny how Mark is just smarter Mr. Beast.
Mark and James (hacksmith) would make a crazy duo  Edit: imagine what they could create
The thing that makes Mr Beast so terrible is starting to rub off on you.

Mark: something about buying something  Jimmy: 😈
Hey Mark, are you doing this for the same reason Elon Musk makes rockets?
What if you had 20 sec build montage merchandise.
Seeing your community come together genuinely made me tear up especially since back in June our community came together for my 3y/o little brother.
Either i need to be this uncle, or i have to be have an uncle like Mark lol
Mark Rober never gives up He makes his friend(s) birthday party awesome This dude is a genius

potassium permanganate
I’m so glad these children get to experience such a wonderful childhood, It warms my heart that u put so much work into this
Nice…
This is the youtube content i want to see.
OMG
We need more Fletcher
Timestamp 12:45, for all my Anti-Brody homies, like come on Brody not everything is about you.
I was hoping to come back here and find videos of you making the world a better place. Instead you go for the same thing over and over again, just for the clicks. I´m a bit disappointed
Damn,I wish that kid a happy life,holy shiet that was awsome
Let's take a moment to appreciate the people who really worked hard for volcano and party
So amazing Mark. We need more humans like you. Thank you for making a difference in the world with your money. You truly are amazing
now do it on Mars Space Boy
This time he just totally focussed on height and not making the column beautiful and smooth.
8:05 possibly the most epic jump I’ve seen
Sorry Mark but I don't think there is anything more explosive than this belly flop. 8:18
7:18 he should probably give the drone operator a raise
6:29 😳
The definition of a snot rocket
It’s so sad that mark can’t bring his son to these events like this. He gets to make everyone’s children happy even though his son won’t be able to enjoy things like this because of ASD
You've conquered the elephant tooth paste. I can't wait to see what science/surprise you can come up with next time.
👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I drafted Alvin Kamara this season
Dammit, Mark!  If you're going to keep coming up here, PLEASE get in touch!  :)  I'm just 20 mins away!
welcome back
i am quite envious of these kids but they deserve it
HOLYYYYYYY that was big
Hello
THE FOAM DADDY
Finally after years the milestone has been made....
This was so fun!
Hey Mark, the possibity that you`ll read this is small, but I`m interested how much force did you exactly measure in the giant bottle ? P.S. You and youre team are doing a great job and creating great videos, I`d love to see more of those crazy experiments.
Awesome video mark this is what friends and cool experimrnts and party is all about specily when a young kid has have canser witch no kid ever should have
Lol nuts! You’re absolutely nuts!
5 years later mark:i gonna make a volcano
1:30 in and I'm already sobbing fjwoiejf
he 22 sec  me 30
My friend is friends with Gavin and he lives here in Illinois with us
4:42 Looks like a SpaceX launch site
As a Broadway fan used to 👢🦵 i was quite confused by the title and I really struggled to understand what was the actual title of the musical
I love how the community came together, great stuff Mark!
I love the drone shots
Hello
You are so close to 20 mil. You can make it
Pog
The best video in YouTube 🤯👍
Any time I see a vid from Mark, and my teacher sees me watching the vid, I get the “smartest kid in the class” award. I love ur vids Mark!!
Its about time you've posted a video!!! So excited
the faaild bro shake at the end tho
mark wont see this comment🥲
Mark is great and all, but drone pilot Nirk is 🔥🔥 in this
16:10 now that there is awkward
That sounded like elephants when it shot out
Meow
Oops I did it again I made more elephant toothpaste
11:28 Lethamyr's intro music
Hi
Imagine doing that with Devil's toothpaste
Mark Rober, you are a national treasure.
This guy is just the best. Period
I know they deserve this because they went through a lot but I can’t help but be jealous
What a great guy
Content!
how come its ALL white americans back to back years?
I wanna use it as toothpaste
"by the way i told my friend Mr Beast" i was confused for a minuet since i thought Mark was also Mr Beast since y'know 💀
very cool
Mark Rober is a gift
MrBeast and Mark rober are the best youtubers in the planet and you cant change my mind :)
I love fletcher, he got the unc shorts
Great to see a life guard at the pool.
wow why is there the lethamyr intro song in the orbeez pool part of the video xD
I literally just watched the previous video yesterday, perfect timing.
Mark Rober is the best and most wholesome person on this planet change my mind
Him in every vedeo   .I sped 200 years making a toothpaste . I spend 3000 years making kids happut    🌐
Why did you didn’t bring me there
This is kinda weird to watch when it's my birthday today as well!
can I brush my teeth with it?
Amazing
Hiiiii
OMG MARK SO TALL
Incredible work done with the heart and mind. You're an incredible human being and people like you are paragons of faith in humanity.
Early!
The filming work on this was knocked outta the park
I give infinite respect points to mark for spending his own time and money to make other people happy 😊
"...50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football." What a weird analogy. 😆 Definitely stick with engineering. Great video. Love what your doing for the kids.
at 8:38 isnt that hydrogen dioxide not peroxide because there isnt 1 oxygen?
im claping in real life
wow late! !! :D
The next time you do that bring me in there along with my family
MRBEAST WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Mother Nature thanks you.
I’d go to school on the weekends if he was a science teacher ngl
Nice
thank you.
After seeing this videos you start thinking asking for a ps5 isn't much
I love your videos
1 hr late😬😬
I wish I can be there
a compilation video where you show every cleanup for all your videos.   I guess is a nightmare the after cleanup
so cool how science can be! love ur vids btw :D
Next time see if you are able to have a person seated in a working elephant toothpaste rocket
I bet the secret ingredient is Bromine
Bravo sir, bravo.
It's been a year already!?!?!?!
Epic!
No doubt the best-est channel in the world 🌎, you just can't get through the video not smiling and being happy. Amazing work Mark👍👏🎉🥰
Amazing
And this only took 17 minutes
Yeah... Showing that safety equipment blurb on the devil's toothpaste, gave away what it is....
ahh yes its perfectly normal to take a private jet on a 12 minute ride
ok this is a great video but rip the flowers in the devils toothpaste thing
"Generous Benefactor", that's Mr Beast
YAYY
Lava
I really do like watching them have fun, but I don’t like thinking about how much this costed….
Love the way you show love to everyone else! 🙏 ur so awesome!
10:03 page time
Bro you said 20 second montage it was 30 secs whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Wow 🥺
GG
Best time of the month :)
A private jet is out of my budget … 20 mio Subscribers
The delves toothpaste looks like the other dimension from big hero 6
This is the best video I have ever seen
Now I'm starting to wonder how a elephant toothpaste powered rocket would look like; I think it would look awesome!
I watched when it was 1 hour after it was made
Imagine your just driving by and you see this
Pog
Now that's a worthy sequel.
now im curious how high can structure itself go
Your are basically the starship rocket scientist
if there is one thing we can all take away from this it’s that mark rober throws THE BEST parties
Yesss
3:46 they probably stole the Portal 2 sploshing Propulsion Gel effect
3:00 can't help but notice their channel icon is the CPUSA's emblem.
I want to go to a mark rober party just once in my life
Ever since the day he made that video I wondered of How high would it be if ut didnt come out the bottom
Mark’s the type of guy who buys 10 cartons of lemons in a math word problem
This is so wholesome 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Imagine Mark Rober and Elon Musk working together...
Imagine if your "Make a wish" would be to own Make a Wish...
Can you do this for my birthday
He doesn’t want Mr beast to beat him
Not only is the coolest science ever, it's also he most wholesome thing I've ever seen
That was cool
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
wholesome
Now for the rocket powered by elephant toothpaste or devils toothpaste?
What’s your montage music?
I will love to have a teacher like mark Rober
Oo
Amazing video ...gets better every time I watch one of ur videos
I love you
How do you know what force I push on fully inflated footballs with?
ok yeah Mark is one of the  BEST youtubers on the platform
H2O2 is a catalyst so after the reaction, does the catalyst burn everything it touches?
Imagine at the last second they had to move it.
the lethamyr intro song hittin
I’m never disappointed in a Mark Rober video!
iroshima has gone higher
YAY NEW VIDEO
Mark Rober never fails to make me happy
Fun + kindness = Mark Rober
Mark Rober is amazing
idk why but brody didnt rlly seem that happy lol
You are one of the nicest person on YouTube
There is no compliment that I can give you that is sufficient enough even as a watcher to fully give back for what you have presented to us. Thank you.
I know the "secret ingredient".
This is literally so awesome! So proud of Mark getting his record!
Scale that flask a 'little' bit more and we will have an actual volcano at our hands...
Child labour lets goo!!
My OCD has been waiting anxiously for this video.
just wanted to say that you're a ganuinely nice human being, thats all.
Thanks Mark for making my day :P
E
Road to 20 million
Imagine Mark Rober making his own theme park with stuff like this. That would be so epic!
Oh my gosh 🤯
Mark is Mr beast 2
What monster gives this video a thumbs down?  Great job Mark and all who helped make this a reality.
Your a great person🥳
Dude, you are a STUD!    Big THANKS to all those volunteers who donated their time, effort, materials, and airplanes to help make this possible.
Sheesh I wish I had this in my back yard!  😢 anyways nice 👍🏻 vid!
mark makes chemistry and physics fun idk how he does that lol
Beautiful job Mr. Rober! Fun watching mixed with some tears of joy for Brody! That was epic!! 🙂👍
FPV drone is the highlight you can’t miss
All his epic video in just one 17 minute video.
next time use orange or blue 😄
I love that Mark, at the end of the video, sounds like he has given absolutely everything, he sounds tired and hoarse. I'm glad that Mark is making these kids wildest dreams come true. Keep it up Mark!
Thanks, Mark, for making the world a better place.
imagine how much people got sunburnt
I was here
Imagine if the tiio had been a rocket nozzle
E
Now that's a video
Guys, why aren't you talking about Flirt Invest? It blows the roof off!
This guy really works hard
Is he still trying to be the best uncle or did he get that title
2:40 is that... colt 45? remixed?
Mark Rober you are inspiring us
kids choice awards has been really quiet after this
Imagine there was something called Heavens shaving cream which is made to go even higher
How do I get so excited, knowing the slo-mo is coming....👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Science is so cool
i cried
Mark rober can you make a nuclear bunker
Dave the town master looks like Ragnar from Vikings
WERE'S THE LIQUID SAND POOL
😲
12:57 pov you go to Yellowstone to see a gizer
.
Mark you never cease to surprise me
This was so amazing. I could've watched an hour video about everything you guys did!
That was GREAT 👑
Holy these drone shots are crazy
0:03 mark hits the roof in excitement
Less than 2 minutes into the video and I'm already preparing to cry...
Yooooooooooooooo
Im curious as too the environmental impact on the clean up?! Like did the grass survive?! Or was there any damage to the house. How does one clean up millions of orbiz
I don't mean to sound rude but that kid did not seemed impressed by anything
I thought this was the first video lol
These guys can't say that mark isn't the best ever uncle in the world
Nice
now this is a vlog
"the force pushing the elephant toothpaste out the top is about 50 times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football"   smh...these American units are really getting out of control.
12:52 HOLY SH
Yooo
Wow!!! That is an engineer!!!
Thank you Mark for making the world a better place, wish there would be more of you. Inspirational
👍👍👍👍
I‘m happy to be your 100‘000th like💜
Ok listen why do you not use a spherical  giant flask because pressure reason I can’t explain but I think it would be better
Omg
damm nice
Wholesome
This video is just really wholesome.
12:53 is where the slime volcano erupts
Alright, so next year a proper devil's toothpaste powered flask rocket?
I think I wanna see a behind the scenes of a day in the life of mark !!
Mark talk slowly next time
Lets just appreciate mark always powering through everything even if things go wrong!
12:46 is what you are here for.
I wonder what would have happened if you use devils toothpaste instead of elephants toothpaste and the giant flask.
great video mark
Mark looks like a real doctor
A new video YESSSS
very dum
this will be the video that pushes him to 20 million
Omg hi mr maker rover I love your video’s ❤️😝🤟😎
elephant/ devils toothphaste rocker? anyone
What an amazing child. We all need faith like that.
13:45 Kann er nicht einfach eine Einheit sagen?
My phone was on 1% for the whole video, and somehow, it let me watch the whole thing without dying until the very end. It must be a sign
Talk about VANITY.
Hi you are my faviorate youtuber
Who's gonna clean this?
Hi I’m a big fan
And when the world needed him the most he came back
It been 5 minutes
Cool
How FLIPPING COOL is this.  Quite possibly the coolest thing I've seen all year.
Wo
Mark is just to nice
human interaction...  how I miss it
Did he say 'My friend MrBeef'? 😂 1:22
cool
Well lets just not expect anything for kindness
12:44 tell me what you guys hear
My birthday was 2 weeks ago and now I'm jealous 😅
Let’s gooo always love a successful project!!! Keep it up Mark!
Love everything about it. (Change the title to [We] Finally did it!!)
💖💖💖
This guy is in my top 5 humans
ah i feel so bad the views are not the worth of the thing he did he deserves more
Yooo he’s got the snowbird shirt!!
If life gives you lemons make pineapple juice
next you should either make an actual rocket-type elephant toothpaste thing, or you should try and go for the largest area by making it so it shoots out on all sides instead of top, which might be hard to do, because the pressure would spread out instead of one place
Jaw dropping wow It was my birthday a few days ago
Once a month I get very excited. The rest, I'm depressed.   Thanks Mark!
When everyone leaves Mark to do whatever he wants
W !
This video is amazing, I'm so happy for brody
Will this be in the rewind? I think the last one was also in mrbeast rewind
Mr beast did 100 M Orbeez .  Plz do 200 M next time
We love you Brody
I know you guys are having a blast,everything's fine, But is this environment friendly?? Just asking,I know you wont even see this
Mark is the hero we don't deserve
And he broke the internet. Again.
Mark outdoes himself every video I swear, like I look forward to his videos so much
I really love alot of youtubers who do influences like this for fun like mark rova :)
Ok the ending got me. Who is cutting onions on YouTube?
Mark ask mrbeast to help you make like a Real Working Robot
That was truly amazing!
Hey Mark, wanna be my uncle?
Next video: how I made a nuke out of elephant toothpaste
Bigger
Should have put a mannequin at the top
Well, there is always something that will go wrong, and only when we test it we see what went wrong.  Love your videos, the process is fun and enjoyable, easy to understand, I especially like it when you leave in the "things that went wrong" part, teaches us that not matter how much we plan, there are still some things we don't take into consideration.  Hope to see you break another world record!
Congrats!
Nurk FPV! Lets get it broo
Incredible!!! So sad it turned into confetti.
Most wholesome thing of 2021
How do you stop an elephant toothpaste explostion?
1h ago
Ok
Imagine just taking a walk then saw this
This is nice, but if you ever do a video about the climate or environment, I won't be able to take you seriously. Sure, we shouldn't all be living in caves or whatever, we can indulge within reason, but the private jet was excessive.
Nice 👍
12:58 two birds flying over this be like: Bird 1: hey bro did you see that new elephant toothpaste video Bird 2: yeah I would love to swim in it Bird 1: uh oh
Nifty
The coolest Uncle on the planet.
Dale who?
Reasons why Red and Orange are an underrated color combo: 10:06
HECK YEAH, NEW MAKR ROBER VIDEO!!!,
Mark Rober is just the nicest guy there is. Watching this makes my heart warm.
7:20 can someone give me the music please!
😂😂😂😂😂
I shouldn’t eat it… but I want too
Incredible! But I am lost as to why Fletcher was there. I mean it's awesome just a little confused on that aspect.
Another world record!!!!! Yeshhhh he did it again🎉
OMG YOU ACSHELLY DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
You make the world better everyday mark!
Kudos to people that help you have our respect
12:54 look at Mark's reaction he was so proud of what he did , I mean who wouldn't be?
Next record: how high can you launch something with elephants toothpaste
Would look even gobsmacked if done in midair... I don't know how but sure Mark can figure it out.
Amazing
My wish for my birthday I would love to see you
13:47 "50 times the force you feel when pushing against a football" Americans will use anything but proper scientific units to express numbers.
Imagine seeing this randomly from a city 5 miles away lmao!!!!
20 mil subscriber special?
your so smart
Thank me for watching? Nah.. thank YOU for making such an awesome video.
Mark has blesssed us
Awesome science, awesome cause, awesome ideas, and awesome cinematics!
Thanks to YOOUU Mark Rober for making this video.
Yeah a true Elephant Toothpaste Volcano!
❤️
Beautiful to see those kids so happy.  Excellent work, Mark and team!  ❤️
Big flask
Hale mark rober
What volcano do you want to do next??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video made me cry. It's really moving when you recognise how mark's channel has grown and evolved from a science channel to one that touches lives. Thank you Mark!
turn it upside down and sent it to space
Cool
1 hour 500 thousand views 🤯
Mark rober, more like best party thrower
THIS IS INSANE!!!
Mark, when are we going to get our Color The Spectrum T-shirts?
Imagine trying to compete to be a better uncle than mark rober
Not just engineering masterpieces but also film masterpieces
Mark lost his Abs rip abs
epic!
Can you make a movie? A 17 minute video is just too short :)
The entire video was just pure wholesomeness
6969 comments🔥🔥🔥🔥
faze rug vs mark rober? first to 20 MIL
Er
His videos make up for him posting once a month
ermm got me crying at the end ffs
Yooo! BIG M
Now do that with ACID, and not the burning kind hehehe
I thought 60 feet was insane but that was 200 feet whats next 1000 feet
I like you Mark I billed with my dad we built  a volcano and it worked and my dad worked at the same nasa as   you did
1 hour 556k views 👁️👄👁️
Mark Rober 4 president
Here before 30+ million views
Yay
How th did you clean that xD
so awesome, these kids will remember this the rest of their lives.. well done
Cool
1:57 child labor is the best! Until they fight back.
10:10 best scene ever
can't wait for next year's gridley make a wish suprise
I just realized this is marks 100th video
Hi Mark, love the videos but I'm curious what you do with the resources used once the filming is complete and also whether you take into account the emissions produced when creating your videos? Concrete and private jets are two of the highest emitting industries in the world.
Which country does Mark Rober live i gotta go there LOL
I love your videos ❤️❤️❤️ They amaze me every time!
meanwhile in 2030: "So i spent the last 10 years designing a nuke out of elephant toothpaste"
Sep 4, 2040: Mark Rober makes a slime volcano reaching the moon
thats alot of damage
Lethamyr?
“I even have child labor to do some work” Everyone “What”  Mark “Nothing”
Next step, devils toothpastetoothpaste into space
Plot twist: The flask had Taco bell for breakfast, lunch and dinner
Meeting mark Rober is like winning the lottery
Happy 100th video
Or charge a car...
Like for slime
Hiiiiiiiii
Mark Rober is the stranger that everyone wants to meet on the internet
Please feed me
I alway love your video’s and always look forward for the next one. You are a great person!!!
I only got to experience the non-working one with my dog, not the working one :(
Holy cow, the orbeez pool camera edit was phenomenal! It looked like it came out of a movie!
To easy
Mark Rober How much pressure is 50 times the Force you pressing a fully inflated fotball? Love your videos!
EPIK, 11/10
I love how mark is still a child
Ah yes mark blows are mind again
omg the ultimate combo MrBeast and Mark Rober, now all you need is jimmy darts
Mark’s kindness is a world record for humanity.
wow 1 hour
Hi
Now that was cool.
He did it again folks
great video mark ..fully enjoyed
Mark rober would probably be the coolest uncle ever
These are the hardest flexes but non flexes at the same time
I love how Mark takes the time to make such awesome high quality videos
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW 😮
YOUR WORK IS AMAZING i feel you should hear that
Imagine cleaning this all up 😂
So many Smiles in this video you are awesome Mark Rober!!!!!
It looks like an atomic
Hey big fan you really help me out when i have bad days with your great videos.
Well guys, we'll see next year, by then we'll probably have the hight of the Burj Khalifa
Wow! These videos take so much effort Mark Rober is by far the best youtuber there is!
He called the former world record holder to witness Fletcher take his record (in the former video), now he called Fletcher to witness his own record being destroyed. Classic Mark Rober.
Next you should go to space and bulid that on the moon
You should save a wall for your Guinness world records
Told you the last one was a fail
Mark do you like mashed potatoes
Great stuff Mark!
Mark rober and party legend
Ok just an idea but what if you make it glow in the dark and do it at night👍
Omg the prívate get mark
Mark Rober, I think your record is officially..........unbeatable
yeah only if i had mark as an uncle
*Casually says* “so I told my friend mr. beast this story”
11:29 Lethamyr's intro
The thing I love most about Mark Rober: He goes out of his way all the time to help people happy, whilst also doing some amazing science! This everyone is an amazing quality, Well done Mark Rober
Can we just take a moment and appreciate mark’s golden editing
How high can it be launched into space?                        *S P A C E*                    That's how high.
You are the Walt Disney of YouTube. Thank you for this. Im still suprised that Mark doesn't have his own TV show yet. Epic landmark.
Bruh you so nice keep being nice and never stop making contents like this oke :)
Not really environmentally friendly
Amazing vid
Danm boiiiii
Mark you are a saint
yeessss  finally
Did anyone else notice that he used the same music as Lethamyr for the orbeez pool?
Alright, remember to invite me next time! just kidding, love your vids, keep up what you're doing to the community!
This is crazy, i just this morning wondered when a new video would drop
2:32 - ♪ J'me promène dans mon avion, parce que c'est super cool ! ♫
I really enjoyed this video, but this had to be noticed 16:11 Just like the smash tourneys
mark this was amazing and ur channel doesent have the best upload schedule but its because your videos are so amazing
I have a feeling that devils toothpaste contains gasoline
FINALLYYYYYY
Funny I saw the original video yesterfay
The 3D view was awesome
Greta is gonna cry next friday      (stolen from GerThunderlord)
Yay
Well Mark, you absolutely win the Cool Dad Award this year!
I just love how you make people whom you don't know so happy, 😊😊🥰

Hey bud where’s the outro….?🙄
I love how it’s been so long since watching this mans channel, but the algorithm knows I need to see this.
Incredible
If everybody had an uncle like mark, let's just say there would be alot of elephant toothpaste
Mark why
If only I had a uncle like you.
If we were friends in real life, i think i would be in prison lol
PERFECT
Anyone else realize he used Lethamyr’s intro during the Orbeez
this guy is the true mrbeast
Cool its nught for me
Hiiii
Just as Bill Nye would say "Science Rules"
the World Record: Again, really
Biggest F for respect bro!
I really like your videos...BUT what about the environment? I mean 26 thousand plastic balls? + All the soap?
This is what the environment needs..
At the moment I saw the title and the preview, I thought to my-self "Oh no, what did he do now?" xD
Kindness 100
6,876th
that drone pilot is insane!
Respect
💯Where is all the people of color is Marks videos??
I guess child labor is the answer
thanks, videos like this one are rare gems and make you want to believe in humanity again
You gave it a Splat!

I am curious about the reinforcement used to keep the pressure from creating its own exits.
You're awesome Mark!
Niiiiice
I am here at half a million views
Those orbeez are an environmental disaster…

Thanks for the smile Mark.... great video as always!
Mark and mr beast are the best ppl on this planet
What? I'm not crying.... But really, amazing job. Great video. You and your team are amazing. Thank you for everything you do.
Thanks for making the world a better place Mark(:
Kingdom come next level
I dont think it was so smart to show that the oxidizer sets gloves on fire, there are not many brown oxidizing liquids who do this...
So sweet
Holy mother of slime...
I just like every Mark Rober and MrBeast  video before watching it.
I wonder how are they gonna clean it
Hey Mark, I want to be some sort of scientist some day, but I don’t know where to start. Anyone can answer but I just don’t know where to start.
YES I WAS SOOOOO DEPRESSSED BECAUSE THE FLOOR GAVE OUT LAST TIMEE
It must be great having Mark as your uncle
You have such a big heart!
Most wholesome video 2021 but why call it slime volcano?
I hope whoever stole that kids ATV suffers internal bleeding
This was a blast (pun intended). Thanks and admiration to all involved.
Next make gods toothpaste.
These children's happiness is off the charts, and so is Mark's.
Hear me out, a rocket powered purely on devil's toothpaste
Mark is that really cool uncle that every kid wants to hangout with because he’s always do awesome stuff
That is crazy I go to the same school as broady
A great one, thank you :)
If only more people used social media platforms like this. the world would be a better place!    Makes me wish I was in a position to do this for others... Well done sir.
epic drone shot
Still wild to me he did this in Gridley, i drove through there all the time when i lived in Chico.
On this day, you have bested your arch enemy, the upscaled flask of elephants toothpaste.
3:30 been talking to Captain D again i see
Last year? It fells like last month!
Can you do the monthly program please I got interested in engineering please
Really sustainable use of resources for this party eh?
The work is complete
Mark I love you!!!!!!!
@møğüş
When I watch your videos i dont know if i should feel inspired or happy
Okay ... 1.000 Dolans for the guy or gal that brings me that formula!
Oooooooooo ;)
Hi
Would be nuts to see non-white kids get this type of attention from youtubers when it comes to fun stuff
what i would really like to see is the cleanup video afterwards :D
Let's just appricate how mark goes above what we think is possible 😃
Wonder how much the construction cost not including labor
Who’s  House is this
The production quality on this video is just another level

Mark you are most definitely a deeply amazing human being. Thanks for being a light in dark times.
What a great story and video extremely well done this is a type of thing we should see on the news positive things that are uplifting and make others motivated to do the same well done mates
Question what happened if you freeze elephant toothpaste with dry ice
seeing a kid smile with joy! that's priceless...
7:35 HEY flat earthers explain this... LOL
😍😍♥️♥️
If you where in the vulcano, you would've died so hard
cant wait to see the amazing science tricks he is about to pull off!
Dude there are so many perfect things about this video that I can’t even describe in one comment, like I said I swear the camera movement is so amazing and at the house in one of the shots look like an alien planet and it was just gorgeous
E
Insane
4:18 totally me 🤣
Awesome!
This is actually so cool!
mark should do this every year
This is the best video ever!
Just when you thought Mark couldn't get any more wholesome.... Hes got me crying in the first minute of the video.
Before this was in trending
eArLy
You are crazy li genius
Is your Orbie Pool is the 2 years ago Jellow Pool?
Can we just appreciate how he didn't just do things for views and when he doesn't do things for himself but does this for some else to make their day
Wth, can't believe it's been years since the last elephant toothpaste video
Cool
Lol this was the last thing I was expecting
Great
new video less go
Mark plays with world record 😆
I love your vids
Mark is clever if the formula got out gender reveal parties would be even more chaotic
Internet randomness - I was born in Gridley in 1950.
Congrats, an upload on a stressful day, thank
When I grow up I want to be Mark Rober :)
Missed the upload cause watching shang-chi anyway so glad this is uploaded
Based
Yeesss! A new video!
Hi

It's amazing but the titale is cluckbaot
What a great guy
Every video is more than the last! You are truly one of the greatest content creators of youtube!
I'm so jealous

I love mark rober he is one of my idols
11:15, if you watch rl yourube then you know
How do you clean that up?
Watching this an hour after uploaded
Nice
This channel is one of, if not the most wholesome channel on Youtube. Great job Mark.
why is lethamyrs intro on in the orbi part
This is so epic!
Hmmm foam flies higher than a mountain one day? You might be able to pull it off
Amazing video, Mark is such a great dude.
What a video
J e e z
He finally did it
We need more!
The dad in the sleeveless shirt is a jerk
New video idea  coke and mentos vs elephant toothpaste
As if breaking the world record for the world's largest Devils toothpaste experiment wasn't enough.
Okay, how much thrust did that produce?  :-)
reset
love how the dude is flipping the camera off @7:30 as soon as he is under the water.
honestly, Mark Rober might be the best person on youtube. i realise it for a video, but that's just, ridiculous. i love everything about the channel and person.
Imagine having Mark as a science teacher
What a selfless kid. We need more like him.
Definitely worth every penny. One of your best videos and that’s saying something. I’m so happy you could do something nice for a boy like him.
The flask looks like the gemini capsule that launched 2 people into space at a time
Yo huge shout out to the locals who helped put this together. Vote red
Hi
this is very wholesome
I. Want. That. Walnut-farm. 😊😆
Brody giving away his wish to another kid, and then the community coming together to throw him the party he deserves is just too wholesome 😭❤️
i know this song 6:00 it is called dizzy.
Not even kidding I just saw slime or something and a guy running away, and I was thinking “Is that Mark Rober video?”
What can I comment? I can just say one word. Extraordinarily Brilliant🎉      P.S. Two words actually😅
Mark is for sure the best scientist ever
Early!!
These are my favorite videos on YouTube
when he put lethamyr's intro in the orbee pool it was pretty neat
I love watching Mark using his fame and expertise to make kids who don't have much the time of there lives he's awesome
Why do you take so long to post a video. I am excited very much for your up coming videos
Dude I love this mans videos there so cool!
Its so cool how Mark Rober does so much to make people feel happy. He got together with this community to throw a party for someone he barely knows.
Mark make a back rooms esc like place for the squirrels so once they enter they cannot get out unless they get to the end
the internet is indeed a powerful force
Woah
wasp
Amazing lol
Yay for 20 sec build montages!
Mark is the best uncle you could ever wish for
leave and rejoin so we can get stuff pls
This dude knows how to throw parties
The way the toothpaste spews out is so sastifiying
I like how Mark competes for best uncle like what do the others do buy best Christmas gifts?
Bruh that made me so mad when he stole Brodie’s atv
The world needs more humans like you and all the folks that made this possible
This is yet another S tier YouTube video from Mark Rober!
omg mark roba
I love science!!!!
Marks comment section should just be called the “compliment section” at this point haha
Mark Rober uploaded? This must be my lucky day!
I gotta say Mark, you truly are a remarkable person no cap
MOM GET THE REMOTE… MARK ROBER POSTED!!
Or make elephant toothpaste out of them
E
If Mark Rober did a collab with Bill Nye it would break the internet, Like if you agree
5:34 a whole film crew????
11:25 - 12:07 is Lethamyrs intro music
2:33 MONTAGE TIME
yep mark rover i love your vids and i have my on scince chanle called bigbrainbros
best channel ever!!
This brings up the question can it get higher 20 ton flask or even bigger would be intense but this was incredible
This is so awesome!! Props to all the engineering and ppl who assembled and planned 🥰
How does he keep out doing himself, next time it will be "Last time it was a bit small so this time we decided to make one the size of a house"
If only I were smart enough to do this
This is like a collection of all my dreams come true. I really wish I was that kid but I am happy for him😅😅
Wow that’s really cool
This is truly one of the best surprises ever!
E
when you take the baking soda volcano to the next next next level
Mark interacts with teenagers far better than I did, even when I _was_ a teenager.
I love your videos keep going !!
its full
now put it upside down and make a rocket
This is genuinely so sweet and so cool?
but how does elephant toothepaste disappear? lol
1 like = 1 uncle point
Go pack go
If everyone was only a little bit like Mark, we could be harvesting the energy from a sun in 1840.
Hi
get your before 1M views ticket here!
I absolutely love the videos your create Mark Rober. You make science and engineering an absolute blast. : )
Great video, only slightly marred by the predatory sponsor
E agora Ibere?
Beautiful
Can u try to make a worlds biggest bed or house?
He is just doing this because Mr. Beat beast his record and he is jealous
I love how you’re just kinda taken on Fletcher as your epic science party sidekick!
after what feels like a year,it feels like it is all worth it after watching
wow, thats taller than the building i live in.
If i was him id be passed out
Oh yeah, this is going big. Awesome!
Is it possible to make a rocket powered by elephant toothpaste?
When mark's gone for a long time....      You know he's making a BANGER!
Thank you for everything you're doing!
Imagine being lucky enough to see Mark in person
Exactly what I’d been waiting for. Thank you for completing your journey.
Gg
*This is probably one of the most wholesome things you can find on the internet*  Great job mark!!!!
This is exactly why I love Mark! Scientific but entertaining and WHOLESOME content! A great mind and a great heart, keep it up Mark!
Thank you!
The level of jealously that the other fellows had for brody was heigher than that of the toothpaste
Hiiii
Never expected mark to talk about Alvin Kamara, 🤪🤠
Mark Rober is the best dad anyone can have lol
Salute to mark rober
Imagine Mark Rober as your uncle that would be so cool!
And you said you over engineered the flask last time lol
Bro howwwww
Awsome video 🔥 but driving a Tesla and flying on a private jet seams kind a ironic xD
And then everyone got the virus.
Devils with the super flask
I can believe he did me like that at the end when he was plugging his sponsor I was expecting him to just onto the logo and so I listened to the whole plug and then didn’t jump into it
Someone having to much with that foam gun
You my sir, are the best form of insane.
What if you actually did make a rocket propelled my the toothpaste?
fun video, but seems hugely wasteful
Why is nobody talking about the foreshadowing at the begging of the video 🧐 20 million trees part 2 ?
1990s Nickelodeon would be proud.
Hiii
Impressive 😉
YESSSSSS HE DID ITTTTTTTT CONGRATS TO YOU AND EVERYONE WHO HELPED

I love your projects soooooo much!!!

Ok mr.beast it ur turn
Insane
Brody is a bloody legend
"One who is kind is sympathetic and gentle with others. He is considerate of others’ feelings and courteous in his behaviour. He has a helpful nature. Kindness pardons others’ weaknesses and faults. Kindness is extended to all – to the aged and the young, to animals, to those low of station as well as the high."  – Ezra Taft Benson
I wannna be your friend lol that was epic
am I the only nerd who heard rocket league music
Mans is a birthday clown on steroids
AMAZING mark rober YOU DO THE IMPOSSIBLE EVERY VIDEO I GET SHOCKED
OMG THAT IS SO SO SO SO SO SO AWESOME LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO SO SO SO SO SO SO MUCH!
Is it just me or does devil’s toothpaste look like something some twisted batman villain would use
The video is too short. Behind the scenes?
11:27 Mark Rober gets sucked into abyss
Finally a mark Robert video
Ah yes, the best way to make a wooden flask stronger: METAL
Watching the kids have such an epic day was really fun.  Thanks Mark, you're awesome.  I love seeing community in action.
I think we all need to make a giant surprise party for mark rober

Awesome to see Fletcher here a year later.

Anyone else notice the song lethamyr uses for his intro during the orbeez pool scene? 🤯
That drone footage and camera work was on point!! Great video mark and glad you were not bested by that pesky flask twice.
Hi hope everyone is safe and happy
Dude, serious shout out to your camera editor my goodness!!  Quality all the way!
Mark every video just impresses me more and more and I love supporting you because unlike showing off money or doing things for clout, you and your team are very nice :> keep it up <33
now turn it upside down and you go to space
It seems like it was a week ago how has it been a year????
The return of Fletcher makes me happy.
This is amazing keep up the great science work lol
only in america
1/4” bolts?
This comment was made exactly 58 minutes after he posted the video :)
Bruhhhh try to make a rocket fly using devil's toothpaste!!!
Hi
This video is legendary, editing is amazing and such a heartwarming story :)
Finally I love it More dt experiments please Maybe a rocket or something so
Can we all just apriciate the camera angles and editing on this video this is one of marks best to date
I didn't even care what the experiment was after seeing what you were doing for those kids. Big hearts win in my book all day!
11:19 👀 kinda built ngl
Hi
:D
1:39 WHY ARE YOU WEARING SANDALS WHILE DIGGING A GIANT HOLE?! PUT TENNIS SHOES ON! YOUR GONNA HURT YOURSELF....
This guy seems to be the best friend to everyone

Never change your building montage music
If that don’t return your Faith in humanity I don’t know what will. That was fantastic
This is pretty freaking amazing! The whole video, all of it.
mark .... you're obsessed ... stop ... get some help...
Ooh this is soo much 🤣😝
What happens when you set a former NASA engineer rouge
Mark was the most excited through out the whole video
when life gives you
we love you mark
what if you used the same physics as a volcano so everything went out at once
Mark loves this toothpaste
6.1k comment less go im soooo early
PLEASE DO MY BRITHDAY
woah i REALLY love your videos (i am sibscribed)
gg
Not only is this video amazing to watch for all the cool experiments and all the awesome people that put in the work to do it all but then to see that it’s all done not for the fame and glory for himself but for such a deserving kid that has already gone through enough hardships in his few short years then a lot of us will go through in a lifetime. Selfless kind and caring= Mark Rober and team! Thank you Mark for always bringing a little bit of happiness and kindness for all of us to enjoy too! ❤️❤️❤️
Early
Hi
Yeeeessss new mark rober vid
i thought there were rel people filming
I saw you at Walmart!!!
Mark you are the best person ever
How many nephews does this guy have, literally in each video there is a different one
.
Imagine if they chose to drive in the tesla😂
Bro this is amazing
.
Outstanding! Huge kudos to you and all those who contributed their time and resources. What a fine thing to do!
step one: kidnap the children
I am so happy this party happened but I just hope they had a lifeguard! Foam on a pool surface makes it hard to keep track of everybody!
Ur a top 10 human being mark! Thank you
I love how this video was edited, props to your editor.
Neighbors- I guess there's some  volcano spewing green lava
thank you for making people happy! great video
you should putt a gopro in the slime so you see it from the slimes prospective
Love this dude so much, he plans everything so well, and makes everything fun to watch, and usually breaks a world record while doing so.
Hey! This is insane!!!!
Poggers
Fantastic
pog
Only mark can pull off such quality contents
I'm one of the first 500k to watch!
Noice, really liked the video
Now do this with devils toothpaste
These videos never fail to make me smile
nice
So he didn’t know about the party but he also brought a friend along for the doctors appointment?
When one of your followers is a generous benefactor with a private jet, it's time to tell your Grandmama that you made it.
6969
Hey bro
That is significantly higher than I ever thought it would go. Far out (pun intended)
it took u 1 month to make this video yet this is so epik so useful
Nice, Mark!
I was about to go to bed now I have reason not to stay I'm very tired
Captain Magma! Get him angry and he's bound to erupt! *"KRAKATOA!"*
devil's toothpaste part two
hello
Fino señores🧐🥂
When did this channel go from science to onion cutting episode after episode...
That deserves a world record just for the joke
i really hope this becomes a tradition
Thats nurk.....
This video made my day. You're an amazing person, Mark.
Yess
Mark Robert in 2025 launching elephant toothpaste out of a 100  foot flask
Mark hits his mark yet again.
It’s been six years and he still uses the same music
1:40 he used lethamyrs intro
how do you clean something like that? :D
Thank you
This is freaking awesome!
Doctor:  Ok you have a serious illness, try to get some rest.  Mark Rober:  I'll pretend i didn't hear that :)    Btw it was a really cool video!!!
I'm not crying, you are!
Next year: Mark Rober builds a volcano
this is why we should explode more nuclear bombs. Nothings more beautiful than a tsar bomba
Dude that is insane!!!!!
Sheesh :D
How can I get in one of those videos
13:58 looks so cool
Bruh, even the drone sounded in shock to see that
Faith in Humanity restored.
Mark Rober makes bangers. Great video Mark :)
Mark Rober. Restoring faith in humanity one world record devil's toothpaste at a time.
I love ur vids 😎
Why did u leave it at the end we didn't need to see u build that thing and then u explaining it
i mean it's cool, but at the same time I have a split opinion.
I knew you would do it again
YOU DID IT
Here before 20+ views
Mark, thank you for providing us a constant source of smiles and happiness in these crappy times.
Mark, you are one special guy... I have many reasons for saying so.... but, I will say... as one special needs parent to another...you are awesome... second... it looked like the color of the dye also might make a difference... such as that red color box went higher than the other colors...
It’s so sad that mark can’t bring his son 🥲
I wish Mark would build a full-scale amusement park like Disneyland!
IT made me so emotional i have cried😢
Haha, i love this. You got youtubers salting the f outta make a wish.
Mark Rober‘s probably just the coolest dad on earth.
These are the kind of videos we need. These are the kind of videos that restores your faith in humanity (even with all that sh*t going around for some time now).  This is simply breathtaking. Thank you Mark and thank you people of Gridley, you made this masterpiece.
Aweeeee we need more people like Brody ❤️ kid deserves it 🤗
You ruined the surprise at the hospital by shaking their hands lul
Imagine your in your house chilling and you hear air raid sirens You look out the window… A massive green mushroom cloud covers the morning sky Blazing hot green foam covers everything civilians are covered and burnt Cell towers disabled Everyone scarred forever
If aliens come to earth and ask for our leader... we have to send mark. This dude single handedly makes me restore my faith in humanity
Aww MrBeast, you made it the perfect ending.... ❤
Mark, you are amazing, bud. You're a great dude, a smart guy, and a great video creator.
wow
The best Youtuber = Mark Rober
I like how in that one shot the drones motors are like OH SHI AAAAA
Why the f is the foam gun named f o a m   d a d d y
this is so beautiful
Is it just me or everyone was smiling during the whole video?? I was just having a normal day and I clicked on the video and it just got much better like 100x.
I can argue Mark rober is the most high quality youtuber on the planet, this is why he only posts once a month, to give the beta content you can watch, he is such an amazing guy and greta uncle as well, he is one of the modern day pioneers of humanity.
mark really did bill nye proud with "science rules"
11:29 Leths intro, anyone?
Project X²  -director markrober
Mark Rober makes everybody's day better
Nurk is the best drone pilot ever.
Thats the sickest thing ive ever seen
I'm crying
that was cool. would to see it go off with a dumby inside with a go pro
Mark IS THE GOAT
Imagine that one guy in the town that couldn't come because he had to get milk
Nothings better then a explosive party
guys next time he will make a life size valcano made of elefent tooth past
I love All the shots!! Wow !
Early!
I was more surprised than the children when I heard that they could ride on a private jet.
Yyaaaaayyyy congrats about the world record and yay for Brody
That was crazy
I wish i could of came o much
All I can think of is little Nikki saying “get in the flask”
the force was 50 times the force you feel pushing againsg a fully blown football... that's the most american mark rober quote ever
1:56 as yes child labor
I wish i was marks neighbour
Im 100% very sure, mark is still not content with the result (because it sprays like a confetti which he does not want). We will see elephant toothpaste part 3
Real life Superman
Mark will probably never reply to this lol.
Have a nice day
I’m so jelly
Whats the song when they were in the pool of orbees
These are my favorite videos!!
9:48 rip camera

What a beautiful story. You sure understand a young persons mind Mark!
Mark is my Uncle
Most people stop at what if, but Rober makes it reality
Wow!
+1000 uncle points, dude!
Mark you inspire me! Thank you :D

By Far your Best Video Ever.
Mark Rober "50 x the force of a fully inflated football" Tom Brady "what?"

The amount of effort to make these Videos is unbelievably realistic
The food coloring company did that exclusively to prank mark

Gem
Pause at 7:44 😂
Pleeeeease
Maybe try to make a rocket👀
Mark Rober's doctor accent sounds so mature.

Mark is winning the internet!!!
He's like if david dobrik was actually sensitive and sincere.
Wow

11:29 Lethamyr, anyone?
Mark finally back after 1 month
Most surprising sponsor ever
This is so cool
The real question you need to answer next, @Mark Rober, is how high can you launch a flask with elephant toothpaste?
Mark always makes my day better,and more entertaining
Did you take your son? Looks like something he'd like.
Amazing
Can we just appreciate the locals helping with this project?
Yo devils toothpaste reminds me of napalm shee
Can we appreciate all the little details that go into this
Mark keeping the formula for devil's toothpaste to himself sounds like he has some government secrets or something
Wish he could just make lovely videos like this every day.
Mark is that uncle in your society, with whom everybody wanna be friends
Faidherbe square for days
these videos are always insane, well done as always mark
I’m starting to wonder what mark can’t do?
Fallaly
NurkFPV representing! Awesome job

Best science YouTuber in history.

This is how many people want him to be his uncle     |   v
The slowmo of the orange(or yellow) devil's toothpaste looked like cheese puffs drenched in caramel.
Imagine mark being your uncle and helps you for the Science fair at school🤣
Is devils toothpaste napalm!?

Yay new video!

Ok what
Coooooooooooool
Well done
Nobody: Mark in literally every video: a year out of my life
When he said 20 secs build montage i just string seeing the timer to see if it was 20 secs rather than the build montage LOL (it was 1 sec off)
Omg
I don't love the association with mr.beast and I liked the video.
WOW
next up worlds largest divels toothpast rocket engine
I love the fact that it actually sounded like an elephant when it exploded 🐘
And then devil's toothpaste was adopted by the U.S. military...
the experiments are so amazing, and it’s so wholesome that it’s physically impossible to not love him
este comentario esta en otro idioma, y espero mucha mas gente lo vea
A-MA-ZING!!! We need more people like you in the world, Mark. This was trully a masterpiece.

Mark Robers video in 20 years: We made a slime volcano past the Karman line.
Next time flip it over and see how how you can make the flask go
11:29 *Lethamyr wants to know your location*

Mark Rober is the king of making people happy. 😃
early on Mark Rober video no way!
Let's give the people of Gridely some love. They helped so much in 2 videos. They need so much more love.
That video bit at the end reminded me of slowmo guy...
1000ft?
e
Volcano Brody   Aka mtn Brody
insane
Put a football on top of the big flask
Always such wholesome and positive energy to enjoy this nice warm weekend. Inspiring!
Now do it with devils toothpaste
This is Brody roberts he goes to my school I know him
Mark that is not a basic question
Like a Tom Brady inflated football?
Mark Rober and MrBeast are my fav collabs and videos
Ok mark rober
Im pretty sure someone, called Integza, has made a 'rocket' with a form a elephant's or devil's toothpaste
OMG HOW DO YOU DO ALL THESE THING THE BIRTHDAY THE POOL NOW SLIME!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW 🤩
Could probably be one of the greatest things that perhaps didn't "save a life" but made such a dang difference that I consider this to be one of the greatest uses of money and manpower I have ever seen. The joy these kids had. That instantly made it worth it. Then how everything unfolded and the message. Very much in AWE 👏👏👏
he have david dobrek type of hair lol
This is so crazy
I love this so much!! Honestly makes me cry with how nice everyone is 😭
I regret that I only have one like to give.  But give it I do, and wholeheartedly.  What a story.
Fun Fact.. this was Mark's 100th video!
[everybody liked that]
You should had been on Bezos rocket engineering team It looks like a Big.....
The nicest human in history
Crazy how they did all this in 17 minutes and 8 seconds
At the point im commenting i paused at 2:38 i kinda feel like it gonna blast off again
Monster flask but upside down which is just a rocket but devils toothpaste rocket?
The stale propane hooghly analyse because arm classically time notwithstanding a tart brow. windy, violet look
Sometimes he really seems to be Phil Dunphy
Nice video Mark!
Nickelodeon gonna hire mark at this point 😂
Is it me or mrbeast ,is that red!😁😁⏩ 15:20
With all the foam, how you yall clean all that??
i can open a tostitos jar
11:52 foottalitly
Awesome video as always
Nice… return of the same thing XD
Yes
👋🏻
Now that is the live time supply of thooth phase
I can do the same thing when I eat taco bell
You can solve world hunger with a 20 second build montage
Great viddie, thank you for making this, really fun to watch!✌🏼🤙🏽
Another amazing video 😀😀😁
The most sweetest word I ever heard in my life. 15:53 😔
Wouldn't have it been easier to just say the pressure inside the flask in bars, or MPa or atmospheres? I don't know what's the pressure inside a football ball to do that calculation without having to google it 1-st, while I could've just gotten the exact number straight from the video.
First
HECK YE GG
omG NeW vIDEo?!?
Just a great vid
This guy is all of our ideas when we were kids but he actually does it, lucky him
I have faith in humans again
The videography is awesome! Please make a skillshare class on videography.
LETS SEE THAT WITH DEVILS TOOTHPASTE PLEASEEE
dont be shy, tell me how much pressure there was in the toothpaste chamber
Theres no way he can ever top that
Always so excited when Mark posts.
Can't believe you got nurk to film, he's one of the best drone pilots in the world, wow
Who whould win Mrbeast vs Mark robber
Wooo
The videography is getting SO much better!  Awesome video Mark 👏
yay first hour
3:40 Mark lets out his inner Captain Disillusion🤗
Best video
Next video: I made a rocket and send myself to the moon!!!
Yay
That’s so cool
Now you need to flip it upside down and make it an actual rocket.
His voice, summer, and the music hits different caues everything you see you won't be able to do
So that's why you didn't upload for six years
Can I please met you IV watched all of your videos and I’d love to meet you
There is one one Mark Rober and Mark nor his experiments can be duplicated.👍🙂❤
You should have the step by step process of what you did to build all of this. Awesome vid by the way!
Mark is literally my childhood
I feel sorry for fletcher that he thought he was special and got a world record as birthday gift,  just so basically the same happens one year later.    Dont get me wrong its stil Lauch an awesome Feature for brody   Edit: okay fletcher even joined,  i take it back its awesome
Can you make a squirrel 🐿 obstacle course 3.0
here before 1m views
So 1 dio punch
But you did give out the directions to make devil's tooth-paste last year. It had something to do with Oprah Winfrey. She's a great sport for coming out again this year for another special party.
My dream but I’m in uae 🙂
Imagine if u wake up and mark's just like "YOu ReADY tO havE SOmE FUN"
Nice
I think mark is the cool uncle
I can already hear it:   Hello everyone this is *YOUR* daily dose of internet
If you ever don’t want to do YouTube no more you could do some epic party planning lol
Wait is that an actual human?!?!?!  Or is it an alien 👽
Mr beast will comment
Absolute bliss
His job... is finished
everyone talks about mrbeast giving away the entirety of france in 2050 but mark rober gonna probably be riding elephant toothpaste to get to mars in 2050
Every kids Dream

See you next month mark
Wait a minute won’t it burn down the baby saplings

A bit sad that there's never any representation of non white/disabled people in these videos
Mark’s voice sounds a bit raspy, is it ok?
16:00 this message is so important!

Mark Rober will never give up to anything until he perfects it. Huge respect.
Definitely not jealous...
Just wow
Early on a mark rober vid!

Hi, great 👍 you are the coolest engineer I have seen

Faith in humanity... restored! Thank you Mark & friends!

"I even had child labor to do the work"  Everyone: what? Mark: nothing
the amount of effort this dude puts into each video is amazing
This is life’s greatest question nag what the meaning of life is like if you agree
Hi
I wish I could make all the kids happy like Mark and Mr. Beast does. Kids are helpless against some adults and some sicknesses, etc. But they are our future so they need to be cherished!!!
When the comment comes earlier than the vid

That song around 11 min is one of my fav youtubers intro leth
ok but this is crazy
Mark, you are way too nice to be real. I wonder, is he secretly an a-hole? I mean everything he does emanates benevolence.
Aren't we in a pandemic? Why are you having a party?
Mark is definitely the birthday planing king
Lets just appreciate mark always powering through everything even if things go wrong!
51 Minutes ago! I love your Videos

Nice content, surprised it was posted 51 mins ago
Props to the drone pilot, really hitting some awesome shots

Hi
Once Mark is gone we might well stop using YouTube
Wow Nurk almost died 😱
Just imagine if they’d decided to still ride in the tesla
He used a dirty trick called a red arrow
The video direction, the camera work, everything is so professional and so cool. Love this video, ❤️✨🔥
On of life’s most basic questions????????
*What the heck…*
"out of my budget" lol
Holy crap, this video probably costed million dollars or more, its 5 tons of steel, bruh. You are awesome.
Lol I wish he was my party planner
Mark you are an amazing person
12:45

Do you wanna go on a tesla or a...        PRIVATE JET?
That must take a while to clean up
Less living life and making friends and spending time with your family, more breaking your own record.

I love Mark Rober! We all love Mark Rober. He inspires so many of us to keep trying. And having fun is important for kids and adults alike. Kindness is the truest gift you can give, and there is so much here.
Hi mark I love your videos
New world record!!! 🤯🌋
In this video mark is messing with Fletcher feeling
I love the genorosity of large YouTubers like Mark and Jimmy, it take alot to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for someone who was at the darkest time in their lives.
What a video!!!
My guy is actually so cool. He does such wholesome things and breaks world records. Mark Rober could not be more awesome.
MRBEAST FRIEND WITH MARK            LEGENDARY
REALLY COOL....LOVE YOU
I am jealous
Lethymrs' intro track really messed me up looking for an open tab.
Hi, could you put devils toothpaste in the flask?
Wow
Cool new vid
On small step for Mark Rober, one giant step for elephant toothpaste kind
Can I buy devil’s toothpaste?
Big
Wow mark is one of the best humans on this planet
what was the pressure in PSI? cause 50 times harder then a football when you push it is hard to understand....
This kid looked like he had the best day ever
Now we need him to do the same thing but with devils toothpast
“i’m doctor fletcher” 😂😂😂
Always quality not quantity
His videos just keep getting better!
Heartfelt ending 👍
You are freaindly
You should make a video with hockey. Like make the worlds best hockey stick. Or a robot goalie that you can’t score on.
He really pushed this experiment to it's lengths...great job buddy 👏
Hey y'all, remember when orbeez pool, devils toothpaste, and massive waterslide were all different videos?
20M soon ❤️
Imagine begin Marks nearest friend.
Mark, if you EVER need someone to help swim in 26m Orbeez i am the guy for the job
MARK STOP COMING TO MY HOME TOWN WITHOUT DOING A MEETUP PLEASE.
EU - Pascals US - psi Mark Rober - 50 times the force you fill when pushing against fully inflated football
Taller?
Idk what to say
Mark: let’s make the biggest thing ever Me:how do u play Minecraft
It’s so cool
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔮
:3
World record part II: Redemption
This is a really large project. I have to ask (and I've been meaning to for a long time), what is the general budget/spending on these videos? Especially the large scale ones like this.
Mark literally lost his voice during this video 😂
Let's goooo
This is why your my favorite youtuber and role model
Did you used red fuming nitric acid?
OMG AMAZING
Holy crap, this is awesome
If I was fletcher, I would expect not to see Mark again, but this shows his integrity and actual care for him. Mark is a great guy.
..... Wow
Incredible Video such an emotional Video:)
That went soooooo high
I always tear up seeing your vids like this one. You are an amazing human being and everyone in your reach is brightened by your presence. We need more Mark Robers in this world.
I subbed after watching your squirrel vids, then my phone died.  Then I got a tablet and came across your last video of this kind of event.  So I subbed again.  Of course your last video with the massive domino automated show was very cool.    I have enjoyed all of these and more, but have kept wondering to myself why I'm attracted to your channel.  Was it humor, crazy stuff, being young of heart or what? After watching this video it came to me.  I am attracted to your generous spirit of helping others.  Squirrels are funny, strange pool parties, slime fountains, etc, but behind your best videos is often a person in need whom you've chosen to help.  That's a trait I admire.
the fact that there were no shots that showed the very top (besides 1) means you know it's high
ur crazy
I love Marks videos, but what are these american units "50 times the force you feel pushing against a fully inflated football". Would like to hear the true value. Just a funny thing i registered. But maybe i am the only one that finds this unusual.
i love this guy
Big Fan Bro 🇵🇰
is no one else waiting for him to actually make a rocket using devils toothpaste????
Best unlce from cartoons:        Uncle Iroh Best uncle from real life : Mark Rober
I love your monthly class! Now I understand alot more what you say! Yhanks?!
Imagine if you did the flask with devil's toothpaste instead of elephant's toothpaste, what I think would happen is it would probably have gone at least 2x higher.
hey mark loki ienstien
This guy living life
Do a collaboration  with jk studios
Mark Rober is the definition of a legend
This was so much better than I could have ever imagined.
Next video be like: Can we launch a space shuttle using elephants toothpaste.
Rip house
It looks like a big Gemini space capsule!
AMAZING VIDEOOOOOOOO
I’m not crying you are.
gg
He's about to cover a whole island for part 4 at this point 0_0
yesterday was my birthday...
Mark’s videos never disappoint. Fantastic video :)
Since when is pressure you feel when pushing on a football a unit for pressure?
MORE PHAT GUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Child labor part lamo

I love how you use entertaining kids as an excuse to be a kid yourself. Well done ;-)

I would like to have a buddy like mr.beast...😋🤩
Pokkkk
Thank you Mark for the advice. I will be sure to check the ingredients of the dye next time when trying to launch a mixture of H2O2 and yeast into space from a 5 ton metal flask.
He finally did it
Wow
Why can I see you trying this again and again until you get a perfect single stream?  Yeah, I remember all those ratio tests you did, and I know you're not completely satisfied with this attempt.  ;-)
The slowdown is so satisfying
You can tell the editing got much better
WOW
Early
I love how he puts others in front of him and does all of these crazy experiments.
HUMAN

Congratulations Mark! You're such an inspiration!!
awsome best vid
Yay he's back
11:20 any Lethamyr fans in the comments?
*Another world record?*
Everyone who sees this is like: I wish I had a uncle who was so cool and for me to have way to much fun
imagine being related to mark rober
Hi
You can tell Mark got new camera gear from those 🔥 shots
Hi, what do you use for normal elephant toothpaste? Whenever I try it, it takes a very long time to turn into foam and there isn’t much foam. It would help a lot if you replied to this with the type of hydrogen peroxide, the soap, the potassium iodide and the food coloring. Thanks!
Meow
Even tho the flask didnt come off the ground u can still see the elephant toothpaste leaking at 13:04, kinda scary
You’re such a role model and inspiration. Thank you for the video Mark Rober!
e
ok, this is the ultimate video, world record, doing something nice for a kid, mr beast, pool, orbeezs, this is mark's greatest creation
*perfection.*
Everytime Mark uploads my life gets so much better
This makes me feel better
Mark Rober and Mr Beast, changing the world one video at a time
great vid
Where do you get the money for this?
"Hey remember that world record I got you last year? Well I'm giving it to another kid."
eat ur heart out nickelodeon

J4j4
Absolutely amazing
MrBeast and Chris better apologize lol
Happiness has a worth that can be bought but can never be sold
Huge shoutout to everyone who helped and worked late on this in the burning heat for weeks. Too under recognized
This made me cry
hulk when scarlett johansen
Would also love to see how the cleanup process went.
I love your videos I’ve been watching your videos since I was seven and now 11 that’s actually not my real age I started watching you when I was seven and now a couple of yearsI came back
so high that was aswom
FINALLY A NEW ATTEMPT.
Society if Mark was the every school teacher and Jimmy(AKA MrBeast) was the head of every government:
Mark is basically mr.beast  brother but with university certificate 😂
Got a idea try to make a non nuclear mushroom cloud out of anything
I love these types of videos, and my whole family does too. They are always so heartwarming and I also almost always learn something new! Thank you some much for making these videos to entertain us all! You don’t know how much this means to us and we thank you!
Posted again!!!
You had a few leaks when the toothpaste flew out. Imagine if there were no leaks?
Now calculate how many bubbles is in the foam u made in this video
Hi
Really nice editing and camera work on this one my dude  👍
He doesn’t upload that much anymore
Yessir congratulations
Mark is the cool uncle everyone needs
Mark is that uncle that always gives you a hundred bucks everytine you leave his house after a visit
I hope this becomes a yearly thing love these videos.
wow, i've never had a birthday party before, cool
Thank you guys for this surprise party! It was so fun, I can't thank you enough mark!
Here before it hits _Trending_ 👍
Is Fletcher's sister single?
Child labor is awesome 😎
Noice
w o a h -
dang you looooooev elephant toothpaste
This video fills me with such joy :)
Woah lethamyr just came out of no where
Hey I’ve seen this one before What do you mean it’s brand new (Btw Ik this one is higher and better but still)
I did the same thing with a house
early!
so we're doing uncle points? -all of them
I love Mark Rober content but all this thing about devils toothpaste looks very polluting
Always inspiring not just thru science but thru your genuine love
Why does Brody kinda look like Bugha
Wow
Brody definitely deserved this
You should do this but with coke and mentos that would be so cool
This is basically science on YouTube at its finest.
This dude and some town bros could build a rocket to Mars in a 20 second building Montage.
So happy it  worked out this time :D
and this is why I love Mark Rober, always trying to improve his engineering
We love you, Mark.
Nice
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
The world deserves a reunion. Mark,r Beast and ZHC
I wonder why his building montach is always 20 seconds
13:45 what a weird way to describe pressure. Could you just tell me how many Pa that is?
What if you put it upside down?
Wholesomeness is off the charts.....my faith in humanity has finally been restored.
At this point Mark's vids are getting as many views as Mr Beast vids.
Mark and Mr beast are the ultimate duo
Ooga booga
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hello I love your videos keep it up
Slimestravaganza video!
When YouTube doesn't send you a notification of Mark Rober's videos.
4 mins ago😈
10:00 is that the sun?
So we've seen what happens when elephant tooth paste accidentally makes a rocket. So I wonder, what would happen if someone were to say, intentionally make a rocket of it?
Such Legends.... 🥲🥲
Whoa... literally brought tears at the end🥲
16:11 no one saw the handshake attempt 👀👀
Yzf450🥵😭😭
Jimmy very down to earth guy
Nice to see another elephant toothpaste video
I love this
okokok Hear me out Mark rober should be apart of the school science curriculum.
My guy has replay mod
Was that an electro-swing version of Let My People Go?
I'm thrilled to see you had lifeguards on duty. That's so fantastic of you!!
Comment for the algorithims!
A moment of silence for all the cameras that fought bravely and sacrificed themselves for our entertainment
this is so amazing your a great person Mark
I think this is becoming a series
It just makes you happy😃✌
Please use your large follower base to produce better earth sustainable content as an example.
Noice
great video!
Freaking awesome!
We need the devils toothpaste as a screen saver
Mans also built a house
If you had a flask with devil’s toothpaste so the reaction would be instant and have all that gourde go into height… and it could be on fire…
Wholesome
I’m really early
Epic
Can we ratio mark rober ?       Also      Get rickrolled
Amazing ❣️
Mark Rober loves children.
So you took away the others kids record
i wish that i have party like that :[
This stuff deserves #1 trending
HE NEVER QUITS
I wish he was my teacher
Mark and odd1sout uploaded crazy awesome
Mark Rober is the reason i live on this earth. he restore's my faith in humanity
hey today is my birthday i feel happy that mark uploaded on my birthday
im going to try to catch a disease myself so that mark does something like this for me lmao
It’s my favorite color green
I love that he has these ‘what if’s’ and just makes them happen. Most people stop at ‘what if’.
I wish I could meet you because you are my idol
This vid cheered me up. Thanks, mark.
This channel just makes me smile.
It's stuff like this that makes you want to become an engineer
You guys are legends, thank you so much!!
this was inhevitable.
Sup mark
wow, this is crazy, also really nice. I love watching these types of things. Really cool video
w
Remember how high up the elephant toothpaste went in this video? This is how high Mark is in our hearts.
Remember he spends more time cleaning than working on this video
very cool bro
❤️❤️❤️
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
all the time we waited for this was worth it.
oh
This time he didn't miss the mark
Welcome to another episode of  *Making kids jealous* . Enjoy!
finally a new video
You did it again
“And some say Mark Rober blasted a lot of stuff into orbit for 100,000 years.” -some random guy, probably

“Ashante”
Beautiful video
pog
Awesome video like always.
Bro Your Awesome I’ve been a fan for so long.
Everyone when the devils thoothpaste went off: yayyyyyy  The drone: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
That was super cool
I like how you make people happy.
Best YOUTUBER EVER
🙂
Now blast a car into the air!
It'll be so fun if Mark Rober was your uncle
Mark: I will never give u guys the recipe for devils toothpaste  Later in the video Mark: (tells us the recipe)
4:25 don't want to give formula  8:40 give formula  BTW, great vid
Wow
The worst part is it came out a little bit from a side
OMG so wholesome, you're doing god's work Mark.         Pls squirell maze V.3
I am the only one that is disgusted of seeing elephant thootpaste ?
*cuts off leg so mark robber  leets me meet him*
We all wish we had Mark as our science teacher.
Im watching this before it gets number 1 on trending lol.
Amazing mark 😂
hi
So he basically made Earth into a rocket by putting an engine on it
A g a i n ?  No protesting but that's a lotta toothpaste
Hii
5 tons dam
Lol
17:00 "Thanks to the monster mega flask for not taking off like a rocket this time" But... what if you actually made a devil's toothpaste powered rocket???
Legend
Yes
Imagine having a cool uncle like mark rober
Wholesome af
Wow. Mark. Just wow
How much higher can you go? Ask mark
Everyones wish: (blah blah blah) My wish: Mark rober to be my dad
I love and care about each and every one of you all, my amazing friends and family
Very wholesome science
Next step is a rocket nozzle on top of the flask to shape and optimise the exhaust so it doesn't break up so much.
Next year the Rekord wif diwel tufpast
Wait wait wait, hold up, did mark just non-ironically leak the ingredients to devils toothpaste? At 8:42 he says what the mixture in the troughs is.
Everyday you upload is a great day Also I like that you don't upload that often so whenever you upload is even more special
This is epic!
Egg
I wonder if adding fins in the barrel could get it to spin, I think that could keep it from breaking up at the top and potentially make it go higher.
.
imagane be his son
THIS IS THE TRUE MEANING OF LEGIT CONTENT 💯
bruh insane
This restores my faith in humanity
HOW MUCH DID THIS COST TO MAKE?!? pls notice this comment
Next year Mark teams up with Elon at SpaceX to launch Elephant toothpaste into orbit.
epic
How are you NOT on a watchlist
First time i see a mark rober upload in the first hour
watching this makes my day 100000000000000000000000000000000000 times better
Dude…..
Yay we did it
HIIII
So true
Mark rober :- i built this mega Structure   People of earth :- how much time did you take to build it   Mark:- not much just 20 seconds
never been so early
I love your vids
So cool
Best person on earth
Also Tesla GIGAfactory
You all are freaking awesome and amazing. Thank you very much for everything, including for sharing your journeys with us

15:22 mark has a IPhone 12 pro but merbeast has a iPhone 11
Me too Mark, I’m from New Orleans. Alvin Kamala is the best.
My jaw dropped with the Hight of the slime volcano Truly a fun amazing achievement Cant wait to see what is in store next year.
AWW MY GOSH THIS IS SO WHOLESOME This gives me hope for humanity I wish everyone long happy lives <3
Huh I’m earlier than normal

The voiceover hitting different 🧐

Mark: Uploads My day is made
Godly boy. U hav to show me how you do it
I love you Mark
how many uncle points you built up so far?
My question, how do you clean this all up? Hehehe....
I think you should just give up on engineering and do experiments on elephant toothpaste
This is amazing
When life gives you lemons you give 2 kids a dream and you make it come true,
Does devils toothpast count as a bio weapon
Me when a girl brushes against my leg:
a
I feel like if the world is ever gonna end from a serious threat, Mark Rober would be called up by the US Government and just be like "Hey uhhhh we kinda need you to save the world. no biggie."
YEES
bro if you were my teacher i would actually want to go to school
This is the ultimate crossover of all the mark rober builds
This is what i can call "Hell's Volcanic froth"
mind blowing video!!!!
mark would be the best science teacher
Mark Rober, the 2nd coolest person on the Internet
What ingredients do I need to do this in my apartment?
He is Genius omgg 🥺❤️

Hats off to you mark !!
Mark Rober, the king of elephant toothpaste, is back at it.
The elephant toothpaste looks like a geyser in Yellowstone lol
This pog

My guy becoming Random Acts :)
Anyone else got goosebumps when the mission got completed

We have here the REAL hero
mark you're my hero
ITS SCIENCE TIME!
Thanks
Not in the rude way because I love this channel but when he said I finally did it in the title I was like “He finally uploaded”
You are making this world a little better with every video you post
What kids want school to be like:
Omg that’s so cool
I was just wondering that orbeez pool is just water at a macro level  and so all the orbeez act as an individual water molecules thus it would seem as if human are in a small bowl of water. Pretty facinating, I am kinda curious, I think it kinda feel like a crystal of sugar dropped in glass of water
Thank you for doing this to people how have been suffering with different diseases
He deserves every second of that party he is such a hero <3 you did an amazing job and gave him the best party of his life.
What was the pressure in ATMs?
how am i so early
Best way to start my day was by watching this video!
No matter want mark makes suprise with every vid
10:20 was an insane camera shot! Shout out to the drone controller for that one.
Next thing we know the titles gonna be “Volcano that hits the moon!”
yay mark rober
We are so lucky to have the internet, to allow us to see and support Mark.
Do it visit space x and interview Elon musk trust me it’s worth it
3:17 HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I just canttttttt lollll HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4754th  comment
We love Mark Rober
9:56 looks like a scene from an alien movie
Dang the filming for this vid is amazing!!!!!!
This is like a thing out of a Terraria/Stardew Valley fan-fiction. I love it. Edit: and the reason coke and mentos works is because the texture picks up things to make the coke erupt. I don’t really remember, I may look it up and put in a link to it if anyone asks. It’s something along those lines.
New mark rober video day instantly better
This is both wholesome and epic!
You’re almost at 20 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS MARK!!! KEEP ON GOING🙌🙌🙌🤟
"I told my friend Mr. Beast."   That's a flex.

Wow

It's a mashup of all of the coolest things hes done on his channel
You are SOOO cool

2:33 Upgrades people, upgrades
Colin Furze. Collab. Begin!
Fully inflated football is not a unit of measurement
No the outro music
Mark can you be my uncle?
Great editing on the bullet time scenes. Also just saying this is kind of becoming an annual event type thing so. (If you are going to do anything else it doesn’t need to be the same basis. It can be completely different)
*secret formula destroys organic gloves* well duh the secret ingredient is fuming nitric acid
I love u mawrk wrobor🥺
I love how this channel has shifted to Mark becoming world's best party planner
Best part about it was that he always helped those who couldn't help themselves.
Holy sh*t
What is YouTube’s fascination with orbeez??  I’ve never even heard of them in any context other than “we put millions of orbeez in a pool”
<3
Just normal florida news, you know
Ayo mark tell me what music 🎶 ur using because that is da best song and can adopt those children 👶 because they are so cute
I love how Mark acts like a kid and has so much fun with every video he makes. Its so wholesome ❤
I watched this 1.15 minutes after it’s release and I just want to say
Just Awesome.

Well worth watching every second!!!!!!

Nice 🤩
FIRST COMMENT YEAH!!
I think you can make it go higher next time by reducing the diameter of the neck by just a little bit
I am at 0:01 and already hit the “thumbs up” !    (Just saving the time it takes at the end , since you’ve yet to disappoint with your content!).    I wish you and your family the best and have a wonderful rest of 2021 & beyond :)
Yay! Mark Rober posted!
this time it was the purpose to not make the flask take of. Maybe next time do the opposite. btw love the vid amazing that you're willing to spend so much time and money for someone. respect.
4:13 that scream though
Love u buddy i hope u do more
Mark Rober, never dissapoints!
So you rented a limo, threw an awesome party, broke some records, and drastically increased your property value... all for a hefty tax write-off...  Bravo Mr. Rober, Bravo.
Me: Watched domino video No one: Me: Has it been a month yet??  1 month later...  Mark Rober: Uploads Me: LETS GO
Mark, anytime you feel the need to bring on of these builds, ‘down under’, to Australia, rest assured you’ll have no issues in getting people to help you out. Love your videos!
Oof youtube's compression didnt like all that foam/detail.

You are amazing!
Hi

that is a life i always dreamed of to have when i was younger. i screwed up so many things i just wait for death to come sooner, bassicly. at least there is someone like Mark instead of me.
Coolio
If only many teachers could learn from you and make science and math so much interesting and fun.
12:46  Your welcome
That looks so fun
Thanks for making the world a better place

Such an amazing video
He returns.
Mark Rober is one of the best people to ever exist.
WOW

What if you make it really light and try to make a elephants toothpaste rocket
Mark just seems so genuine
When the flask exploded it actually sounded like a elephant whistling
Absolutely loved the video! Once again pleased and happy to have watched another!
You were 15 minutes away from my home town recently?! I drive past here every day for work. How crazy! Great video as always!

The 26 million Orbeez just gave most of us flash backs. Amazing video as always
You are just so smart and amazing you take your time with work  and then you show the world and  I like it.
Mark: Look at the house! You can’t even see it!!  Me: then how are we supposed to look at is LOL 😆
“I even harnessed some child labor” - Mark Rober 2021
Mark robe r is at it again
Mark needed to sacrifice a cheap camera drone so we could see what it would be like to be engulfed in the Ariel toothpaste.
33 minuets thats pretty early
Anyone else stressed out thinking about cleaning this up? 😩
I wish i could go on a jet i want to see carpet
Bro Love From India  Hope U visit here after Pandemic 👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
This year mark rover stole world records. I want to eat devils toothpaste now
I like how Mark showed all the construction process in a few seconds, that actually might have take a few months.
bro thats legit taller than the colosal titan
He's so wholesome and his experiments like these are bonkers, that's why I like them
Like your content
The uncle we all wish we had
gg also wow 4,444 comments
Hi Mark
Waited a few weeks but it was worth it

if mark was a teacher in a school, i would sell my house to go in that school
you are the best and make learning so fun
Sheeeeeeeesh
Get mark to 20 mil
Mark is so kind to his viewers
Im supposed to be doing homework, 😭😭😭
This comment serves no justice, You are breathtaking!
You need to make one that actually is a giant elephant toothpaste rocket now
Hi I like your videos
I'm glad Mr Beast and Rover are friends. They can do so much together!
so cool!!!!!;@![!
a bit early
You're a cool dude Mark Rober
Hi
Amazing
yooooo
It's nice to see nice people do nice things for nice causes and nice people
Mark Rober doesn’t dissapoint
My salute to the new drone pilot 🖖🖖
Feels like Christmas
Mark Rober is the perfect balance of hard science, exciting our inner kid, and teaching life lessons :)
What a perfect example of wasting earths' resources... Why not spend your energy and actively do something positive to this planet and entice your multi million audience to live more sustainable rather than using up all resources just for the fun of it before we run out?
That orbees shot at 2:44 was the sickest thing I’ve ever seen
Flecher is back babay
Mark Robert is very BIG brain!
what a diverse neighborhood
MY BROTHER SIAD YOU WERE PREGNANT!  WHERE IS THE HOSPITAL!?!?
Nice vi
wholesome
hi i love you🙃
I don’t know what went the furthest the elephant toothpaste or the people screaming
hi mark
In just a few hours 300k views shows how far you have come
excellent very nice keep going
This is so cool
Great shoutout to Alvin Kamara! Geaux Saints!
I love watching other people havin fun
Can we just appreciate how much mark rober does to entertain us for a solid 17 minutes
Child labor LOL I am dead.🤣🤣
What an amazing video ❤️
can you do this upside down so you can launch  a rocket?
I didntneven realise a year has passed
Mark did it again
Next year: "We built a slime volcano and launched it into space"
When it says 40 mins ago…
And this is why Mark Rober is a BAMF!  Seriously, if I ever win the lottery expect a large check to keep doing awesome stuff like this for kids
Noice.
Mark tries to be the greatest uncle ever but i mean who is he competing with?
Mark Rober is literally the nicest person on Earth. We seriously do not deserve him. He’s an inspiration to me and many others. Keep it up mark
Building things like this is every engineer’s dream. You’re a master of party creation mark.
He is not a quitter and I love that about him
Dammmm
Yay!
what's The resson from this Video,,,,😐
When the queit kid makes a science volcano  The volcano:

Best youtuber
This attempt blows his last flask out of the elephant toothpaste
Eyy I'm Early
It would be so fun to see a video where Mark Rober makes the flask purposely fly like a rocket, or even become a rocket.
Could devil's toothpaste actually work as toothpaste?
Mark never fails to amaze us

Now put Devils Toothpaste in a giant flask and actually send something into orbit.
“What the Science teacher  sees when doing a lab”
As soon as I saw that Mark Rober is answering some comments. I tried to write one, as quickly as I can but I know it is very hard to get replied by him (thousands of comments in his video every day)
.
Hello mark
After I saw that video and it all came out the bottom I knew you weren't satisfied and you were gonna do it again. Great Job Mark!
This was awesome!!! Congrats on making the tallest Slime Volcano!!!

Hello
I wish they put someone on top of the flask when it went off

Hello
Mark Robert is my favorite YouTuber, but. He posts monthly so I'm waiting everyday and I'm like, Did he post yet. I love your content.
You are so famous that you can get 24k like in 22 minutes
pls im desperate
Fresh video out of the oven
gwgsw
Every Mark new video Is just like a random mass release of one of my favourite Mangas: Unexpected,Mood changer and make the day a lot Better.
Why did it make the noise of a kitten yelling
Let me explain mark rober. Look, he is a gifted born scientist, even though he makes weird things like a orbie pool, he still works hard to do what he does. I know he has friends to help him but honestly in my opinion, he could do this by himself, just longer. Still, he is a hard worker, and I don’t know who is a better scientist and engeiner than he is
hello I watch your videos and it makes me happy when I'm feeling down thank you :)
I love mark's videos 🥺🥺🥺I love him.
thats a cool town!
hello random person scrolling through the comments
Mark Rober congratulations on your achievement and for making these kids day. My only question is what are you planning for next year to top this one!
Imagine being some random person walking their dog or something and seeing that green monstrosity lmao
16:10 Handshake.. SIKE! Hug instead!   Once again, Mark, you've managed to inspire us all, while giving Brody, and all involved, an incredible memory to last a lifetime!! 👏 👏
Uh 4,100.comment
This guy is living in Minecraft creative mode
The ending was enough to make a grown cry. Amazing Video.❤️

This Video gave me hope in humanity again.
my whole week is made better when Mark uploads
I wonder how awkward it would be for the people in the party because everything they did was filmed
Way to go, Draft Kings, by the way.  This was a cool video.
Mark : Dedicates an entire year of his life to preparing a surprise birthday party for someone he’s never met Me : Gives my bro a hug and ignores him the rest of the day
The foam at the end looks like the Rick and Morty portal
Mark is awesome for giving people so much fun.
Amazing work my dude. You spread so much joy with this, bravo
My respect when he brought back fletcher:📈📈📈📈
It's amazing how much work you put into everything
This video will be #1 trending

Your videos always remind that humanity could be worse <33 whata lad
the elephant toothpaste, when it shot up, actually sounded like an elephant
He’s so nice!
YOOOO 22 MINUTES NEW
Dead channel
Mark Rober is so kind, and is a very intelligent scientist who knows how to make surprises, but not necessarily act
This would be great if i had *new shoes* but then they’d be ruined by the *cereal killa*
I had no idea anyone was working on this...but I'm oddly satisfied they were...
Wait what
mark rober rlly said run it back
We should obviously take some time to appreciate the camera angle and of course mark's effort. possibly one of his best birthday parties ever...
Hello
Hello!!
I feel like in 2050 marks going to make a video called “I made an elephant’s toothpaste experiment with more force than a nuke”!!!!!
Mark rober is a legend🔥
waited for that video for a lot of time
This is so cool
Mark rober uploads 15 minutes ago Mrbeast comment : 47 minutes a go

This is insane! Thank you mark for helping people and bringing joy to this world
Mark You inspire me to have interest in science love your vids

NASA: *launches rockets into space*  Mark: *launches toothpaste into space*
I like the many drone shots
Simply put the world needs more folks like you in it!
There was no need to make me cry tears of joy at the end
Im just curious that this is a social gathering. We're they all quarantined before they made a social gathering?
It's really satisfying seeing all those colors getting mixed together
He is a legend
It’s sad that you don’t post more often because I love your videos and learn a lot of them❤️🔥
kids cost too much money ;-;
Yay
Mrbeast+mark rober=awesome

Heyy Mark Shoutout pleaseee <3
another quality content from mark Robert!!
Great video, but I think the elephant toothpaste idea has been a bit exhausted now
The orbeez pool is fun but there’s no footage of me and Miguel having to pull everyone out. Gotta say, it’s cool to be able to say we were the first people to ever lifeguard an orbeez pool.
Another Great Video Mark! Great Job!
A hero nobody asked for, but everyone wanted!
This is going isbgoingto be epic
Aside from the tallest slime volcano, he also deserves the world record for the best uncle.

Helloark
"Fifty times the force you feel when pushing against a fully inflated football."  What does that even mean? American football football? Association football football? Rugby football? And fully inflated by whom?  Any chance you'd tell us the units are in normal language? PSI, atmospheres etc?

Mother Nature:that looks cool
Hey mark, I just wanted to say that I love your vids but I think there are aspects that could be more environmentally cautious, I believe (I’m not at all an expert so take my word with a grain of salt) that or bees can be environmentally devastating, is there a way you could negate the issue?   Love your videos seriously! Please keep making more

Hello Mark. From the bottom of our hearts, my wife and I would like to express our gratitude for bringing so much joy to our two children (Oli, 7 and Izi, 10). Thank you for sharing your time and love for science with my children. Olie definitely loves your videos.
