If Putin wanted security he could have just take Luhansk, Donbas and Crimea. Instead he wanted to take over the whole of Ukraine. Putin is killing civilians using banned weapons cluster bombs, thermobaric bombs, missiles on civilian population destroying water, electricity, sanitation, hospitals, schools infrastructure and not military targets to terrorize civilian population. If Putin's objective is take eastern Ukraine fir Russian security than why the  push on Kyiv. Putin could have easily met his objective by simply occupying Donbas, Luhansk and Crimea instead of a costly war with huge loss of life to take over all of Ukraine. The arguments presented does not make any sense unless seen through the lens of a dictator with grandiose plans of conquest as Napoleon, Hitler.
In any way, the name of the Russian state must be destroyed by the USA, NATO, EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA. Because it has been proven that Russia is building a power block to compete with the USA, NATO, EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, and all friendly countries.
You got them young man USE THEM🇺🇸🇺🇦🇨🇱🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
You are all fucking hypocrites. You do not know anything about what happened before that, who led Ukraine to this. You didn't care when Ukraine killed its own citizens. You only see one side
It is better if the US, NATO EUROPE and all friendly countries should not normalize relations with Russia, because it has been proven that Russia is trying to build a power bloc to compete with the US, NATO, Europe and all friendly countries. .so that it can be said that the US, NATO, EUROPE and all friendly countries are hostile to Russia.Therefore, if the US, NATO, EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and all friendly countries build economic cooperation with Russia, Russia can gain financial benefits to build military power to attack the US, NATO, EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and all friendly countries.
I recommend (especially to those who are commenting here and are pretending to be VERY BIG EXPERTS) to read this article: Military situation in Ukraine, by By Jacques Baud (Colonel of the General Staff, former member of Swiss strategic intelligence), as part of NATO in he trained Army in Ukraine for several years, preparing them fight with Russia. His quote: "The war did not start on February 24, with the begin of the Russian “special military operation”, but already on February 16, when the Ukrainian forces started to attack the Donbass Region / with Ethnic Russians/. Since the 16th, the artillery shelling of the populations of Donbass has increased dramatically , as shown by the daily reports of OSCE observers. Neither the media, nor the European Union, nor NATO, nor any Western government reacts and intervenes. We will say later that this is Russian DISINFORMATION. In fact, it seems that the European Union and some countries purposely glossed over the massacre of the people of Donbass, knowing that it would provoke Russian intervention. In order to make the Russian intervention totally illegal in the eyes of the public we DELIBERATELY obscure the fact that the war actually started on February 16th." In his article he says that US & Britain key goal is to weaken Russia.
Arms purchase loans. Do you think it's free? 😂
LOL..... Ukraine, The MOST CORRUPT country in Europe as per Trading Economics (Corruption  Index—Europe), and The Ukrainian Gov wants to join the EU ?!   What a JOKE !!!!
🌨🌨🌨
The actor is leading the Ukrainian people to death..Ukrainian mothers do not give their sons to NATO to test weapons on Orthodox sons..America has not flooded millions of children in the world..Whoever sows with them will die ..
We must bring this genocidal maniac to justice. Zelensky must stand trial in the international criminal court for his war crimes.
Stay strong Russia you’ll win this war ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
The Americans or NATO will most likely go to war somewhere after a while, then Russia will give them a real hell!💤💤💤
God told me that tell my people to repent 😭 please urge the world to repent,if they don't repent they will die forever the fire 🔥is coming Ezekiel 33:1-9,James 1:5, Isaiah 59:7,Nahum 1:7 and Hebrews 13:5 share the message tell everyone to get physical bibles
Чтобы США назуй взорвалась бедная украина воюет с Россией которая на 40 млрд голов выше. ДА МАДЫ ШИЗЫ АМЕРИКА!!!!!
It is very sad that the US and UK are treating Zelesky like a puppet.    The Ukrainian people do not want war and the USA sending weapons. The USA sends weapons and UKRAINE puts the dead's [ Soldiers and civilians ] and battlefield [ Destroyed infrastructure and economy ].     In this war, there is no way for Ukraine to win.   Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians dying, even many do not want to fight.   If Ukraine dealt directly with Russia they would reach a peace agreement, as they were achieving a few days ago, but the USA does not want to, that is why it is manipulating Zelensky.   Where does Zelensky get that with weapons they won the war?  If one of the disadvantages is that he is fighting on his territory.   Perhaps the only thing that would gain is that the war lasts a little longer, which would lead to greater loss of soldiers and more intense destruction of Ukraine.   The truth does not make sense for Ukraine to continue to resist and it would be better for Ukraine and Russia to settle things directly.   The USA is only harassing this war for its own political convenience and wants the world to look down on Russia.   But I don't think it will work for it, because most of the world is already well informed and is aware of the intentions behind this harassment of the war by the USA.    It is an extreme absurdity that the USA is sending weapons so that soldiers, mostly from Ukraine, are killed instead of trying to induce Ukraine and Russia to reach a peace agreement  Love for Ukraine   💛💙💛💙💛
The shifts took too long and we all know what  the ramifications of that was and is.
The time we all finally unite
To those who support Zelenskyy... Stop supporting that cocaine addicted puppet. You people have no idea what you're saying.  https://youtu.be/8X7Ng75e5gQ https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4 those aren't media or biased opinion links. Those are links from Yale University  and The University of Chicago. Educated facts from educated people.  May Zelenskyy be dealt a swift and wicked death for being the spokesman for WW3🙏
AND THANK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WELL , THE PRESENT ONE, NOT #45
NOW, JUST WIN BABY!!

Mending ngelawak saja. Politikus gila. Coba pikirkan..kalau NATO terima uni soviet atau NATO mengajak rusia gabung dengan NATO..rakyat tak perlu khawatir dengan konflik seperti ini.   Itu salah politikus AS juga yang menjadikan uni soviet hingga rusia sebagai musuh.
ukraine will not prevail in the war!!
Zelensky is in deniel
Stay strong Moscow 💪and tnx for standing against the fuck/ing western terrorists
who will guarantee that in the next aggression of the Western countries, the weapons delivered to Ukraine will not destroy the NATO military itself.
Ukraine will defend its freedom. Putin is a horrific war criminal who must be stopped.
Must be paid back in full with 80% interest.
Congratulations, you've created another super terrorist. Elinsky!  Bloody fools. 💀💀💀🤭🙁 What next? Nukes? ☢☢☢
Your welcome Ukraine God be with you
Thank you for bringing ww3 in Europe
Supplying Ukraine with more weapons is pushing for world war 3 , Russia is being pushed to the edge of fighting the war dirty

zelensky provoquing WW3
I dond t understand people, Zelensky provoqued this war by non respect des acoords de Minsk, he is killing his people and he is considered as a hero, the world en envers !!!
if peace is wanted don 't send weapons to Zelensky, he is it who provoqued this War by non respect des acoords de Minsk, he kills his people and creates WW3, dangirous killer
Zelensky C’est un idiot vraiment save lives after many of your people have died
Stop ukranian nazism and rusdophobia!
Where is the Pope? I am Christian but I would be asking myself why he has not been a  counselor, to Putin it very hard to believe a man with such religious conviction has not reached out to a man of power with the same convictions to have a talk on peace and love. No matter what Bible you read God is forgiving and you should fear him before all else
Zelenskyy: One of the worst criminals in the world! He could save his people when he shows the white flag...! Once a comedian, always a comedian.
For the record, and just as a reminder, it’s okay to be pro-Russian on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Just sayin’.
Wonder if he will sell them weapons for more cocaine and high heels.
VOA funded by the US Government 👀   YALL SPELLED TAXPAYERS WRONG IN DESCRIPTION 😂😂😂
Donbass
Don’t worry Mr. President Stay Strong if Putin doesn’t stop soon I will come help you.
Russia never stated they want to destroy of capture Ukraine. They have repeatedly stated they want to Demilitarize, Denazify Ukraine. Civilians remain trapped by the war criminals of Ukraine who publicly stated they will kill anyone who surrender. Russia states publicly anyone can leave in peace and not be harmed. Who is the criminals…Zelensky?
Why is America doing just enough to create a facade of helping Ukraine but not enough to actually help Ukraine. See they can't piss off Russia to much because when they take over Ukraine professor Biden doesn't want the barisma gas company records in the hands of Putin. Syria and India have been fighting for years . Why no aid there for innocent people? Because that's not where all the corruption. This a war to protect the corrupt. It's unfortunate that the Ukrainian people don't see this.
It must be an  unbearable odor in the house of white press room with all the feces in there.
FORZA RUSSIA! FORZA PUTIN! UCRAINI VIGLIACCHI NAZISTI MALEDETTI! Scemeschi tanto ti fanno il culo come il Colosseo lo stesso! sei un morto che parla!
GOD save us from usa.
Crooked SOB
Man, this guy is an incompetent baffoon.
💛💙
My favorite part is where Zelenskyy gives civilians weapons so we can justify mowing them down. Surely the audience of this network supports a little population reduction to meet their crazy green goals. You wouldn't want to be hypocrites again, would you?

USA is fighting  this War
Zelenskyy is a warmongering puppet who is making things worse for the Ukrainian people. And only stupid people cheer on World War Three.
Dont worry it will be Russian's .
Russia thinks they're fighting Nato because we sold our weapons to Ukraine, bruh Russia wouldn't last a year if we had boots on ground fighting those dumbasses

Nuke Russia and kill as many civilians as they have
armed coup in Ukraine in 2014, the Nazis and fascists seized power - this power is illegal
30 Nations helped Ukraine stand for democratic freedom against Putins criminal aggression..
It would be better if nato help Ucraine instead of sending weapons, It sounds a cowards cheering "here there aré the weapons go ucranians you can!"
About time !!👍👍👍
Ukraine should target Russian military airports near Ukraine
Yep keep flooding weopeons into Ukraine fck diplomacy well done Mr zelensky

So sick of the Western liars n criminals, and their alleged freedom, which is based on other nations bloodshed and Political manipulation, economic pressure and creating wars,You all are murderers even the people because you encourage this.
WE WILL SEE IF NOW UKRAINE WINS.....
Ukraine country will really step up their force.  The Russians are pitiful fools. The the Ukraine 🇺🇦are fighting for their rightful freedom from oppression.   They would rather die.   They never did anything to deserve this  horrendous genocide treatment.  Putin should be treated as a War Criminal....and should be Isolated from any trade or banking privileges along with his oligarchs....
The evil will be defeated soon, stay strong Ukraine !!!!!!!!
What happened to no taxation without representation we did not approve war has been a thing for thousands of years and people die everyday what about the millions killed in the middle east it's only important when war happens in Europe the Pacific and North America i don't support either side most of you are sheep to this proxy war in reality most of us don't even know who's actually winning or losing
My back is paying for you're war WHERES MY MONEY?
We been armed you tf u mean
Cheeky fucke rbuy your own weapons if you don't like the way other countries have helped.
Zelenskyy agradece a los socios por "finalmente" proporcionar las armas que Ucrania necesita 9556 Me gusta 787.182 visualizaciones 23 de abril 2022 El comandante militar adjunto de Rusia dijo que el objetivo de Moscú es controlar Donbass y el sur de Ucrania, lo que le daría acceso a Rusia al enclave separatista moldavo de Transnistria y bloquearía el acceso de Kiev al Mar Negro. Pero los funcionarios estadounidenses prometen ayudar a Ucrania a defenderse, como informa Cindy Saine, corresponsal diplomática sénior de la VOA.  Mientras continúa el asalto de Rusia a Ucrania en la ciudad de Kharkiv, el secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos, Antony Blinken, dio la bienvenida al primer ministro de Ucrania, Denys Shmyhal, al Departamento de Estado el viernes. Blinken volvió a expresar su confianza en que Ucrania prevalecerá en la guerra.  Antony Blinken, Secretario de Estado:  “Creo que esta es la primera visita desde la agresión rusa de un alto funcionario del gobierno ucraniano, una prueba más de que una Ucrania independiente y soberana va a durar mucho más que Vladimir Putin”.  Tanto el primer ministro Shmyhal como el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy agradecieron a Estados Unidos y otros socios occidentales por "finalmente" proporcionar las armas que Ucrania necesita para luchar contra la ofensiva de Rusia en Donbass y el sur de Ucrania.  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, presidente de Ucrania:  “Y estoy agradecido con todos nuestros socios que finalmente nos escucharon, que nos brindan exactamente lo que pedimos. Porque sabemos con certeza que con estas armas podremos salvar la vida de miles de personas”.  En el Pentágono, se le preguntó al secretario de prensa John Kirby si las fuerzas de Ucrania, ahora que están recibiendo armas pesadas, podrían hacer retroceder a los invasores rusos.  John Kirby, secretario de prensa del Pentágono  “Creo que esa es una pregunta que solo las fuerzas armadas de Ucrania pueden responder, no el ejército de los Estados Unidos. Lo que puedo decirles es que nosotros, junto con otras más de 30 naciones, estamos haciendo todo lo posible para brindarles las herramientas que necesitan para defenderse y expulsar a los rusos. “  Algunos observadores dicen que la evaluación de Estados Unidos sobre la capacidad de Ucrania para ganar ha cambiado en las últimas dos semanas.  Anne Applebaum, historiadora:  "Hasta la última semana más o menos, creo que los estadounidenses todavía no estaban completamente convencidos de que Ucrania pudiera ganar. Y había algunas dudas sobre si, ya sabes, estas armas pesadas eran necesarias y demás. Como dije, me parece como si hubiera habido un cambio en la última semana, y ahora se han tomado las decisiones de dar armas mucho más serias”.  Antes de la Pascua ortodoxa de este domingo, el presidente del Consejo Europeo, Charles Michel, dijo que apeló enérgicamente al presidente ruso Vladimir Putin durante una llamada telefónica el viernes para permitir el acceso humanitario a la ciudad sitiada de Mariupol, donde los civiles siguen atrapados.
AMERICA IS GETTING SCAMMED OVER THIS WAR!!!!
DOOOM UKRAINE DOOM EROUPE !!!
What an idiot, you dont have any partners. He still dont get it. He was used like socks.
So Russia is fighting with Ukraine and USA along with other 30+ nations. Russia are simply bad ass.

Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🇬🇧
RIP Mr Z
after all the rottenness of ukraine and america had been dismantled, russia finally shamelessly met again. may god destroy the demons. ha ha ha
If Joe Biden were presidential material he would have been training Ukrainian pilots how to fly A10s WHILE Russia was massing troops on their border.  What did Joe Biden do instead?  He cackled like chicken little "The Russians are coming".  There wasn't a plan hatching in  Joe Biden's brain.
Sure hope no none connects the corruption between Biden and the Ukraine….. just concentrate on the war.
now watch Russia drop a nuke on them... there is NO way Ukraine can win that war...

World War III Has Begun; How It Unfolds Depends on Us We think of the Russia-Ukraine war as a local conflict, but it is much more than that; it is a global war on multiple fronts. The war is not only a military conflict; it is also an economic war of attrition. With skyrocketing gas prices and shortage of staples, people all over the world are feeling the consequences of the war. This war is transforming the entire modus operandi of humanity. Since the dawn of time, we have been accustomed to living by the motto, “survival of the fittest.” By and large, the rule was that the strong determined the rules, and the rules were often abusive toward the weak. Now, it seems like a new mindset has set in: Wanting something and being strong enough to take it does not mean that the world will accept it. The war, therefore, is being fought on the inside no less, and perhaps more than on the outside. Our very makeup is changing from abusive to cooperative, from narcissistic to altruistic. It hurts, and it will not happen without a struggle, but it is irreversible. This is the path of our evolution toward the purpose of our creation—to encompass within us all of creation. To do that, we must come to care for it, just as a mother encompasses her child through her maternal love. The struggle to transition from our current uncaring and mean approach to all creations but ourselves, into wise and compassionate beings is called “the war of Gog and Magog” or Armageddon. Since the war is about our inner makeup, we can fight it within us. If we object to struggling with ourselves over who will rule—the ego or love—the physical reality will force us to choose love nonetheless. However, it will do so by hurting us in a very physical way. The war in Eastern Europe is nothing compared to what we might have to endure if we resist the process. The horrific descriptions of our sages and prophets hint at it, and we would not want to live through it. Alternatively, we can fight this war within us without firing a single bullet. The choice is in our hands. All we need is to continue in the same direction that nature is already leading us: toward connection. If we make an effort to care for one another, even though initially we don’t, then we are moving in the right direction. If we try to resolve conflicts not with guns or even legal battles, but by strengthening the care and friendship between us, then we are saving lives and sparing torments from countless people. In conclusion, let us try to rise above the hatred and see the human on the other side, who suffers too. Let us think that this war was given to us so we would think about each other more than we have so far. After all, were it not for this war, we would not notice one another. Now that it is here, we are no longer indifferent. Although our feelings our currently negative, now that we are aware of them, we can work on them together and turn them around. These are the wars of the Messiah who moshech [Hebrew: pulls] us out of the ego, and into mutual love..
Ukraine loosing so hard lol long live Russia Z

I would donate my savings just to help our brothers in sisters in Ukraine to fight the war against Russians... love and respect from Philippines!!!
Rússia would need to feel the taste of war in the midlle of their own territory, in their own towns to understand what the Ucranians are passing threw
No , you don’t give them tools they needed. You encourage the war to continue , more weapons , longer war! Financing the u.s industry! Money laundring that’s all it is. Just like it was in Iran and Iraq.
ZZZZ
more weapon more death
This is how you know that everything  about news from Ukraine and supporters of Ukraine is fake because they blocked opposing view media stations  to continue to post lies and misinformation to people around the globle.The Ukrainans leadership should understand that they are been use and abuse to fightg the war of NATO and west because Ukraine can't never wine this war.YoU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE WEAPONS WILL ALSO FALL IN THE HANDS OF THE RUSSIANS
You gotta wonder what zelinsky has on the Biden administration, with all this aid and support we're sending them. If you ask me, the more we send them, it just drags out the inevitable demise of the Ukrainian forces. Maybe if they hadn't been shelling the Donbas region for the last 8 years, they would've had enough munitions to fight for themselves. Billions of dollars,  when its a war that has nothing to do with us. Billions of dollars, when we have our own problems of crime, homelessness, homeless vets, and a wide open southern border. It's disgusting how little, former vice president Biden cares for his own country.
This is all Elensky knows about: weapons, and then some more weapons. He doesn’t know where 5million civilians left, he knows less what damage had been done to his country, he is clueless when his puppet master will finish the war.
Yes Ukraine has done nothing to the world or Russia you can't lie to we the people
Ukraine is not going to win. Providing more weapons is a false hope that will prolong the war and result in more dead. But the US military industrial complex is clearly winning huge contracts.
Biden left ours in Afghanistan. Zelensky can go there and get them if he wants.
Let's go Russia let the carpet bombing begin
I’m all for this but sure hope the US is making new and more weapons to protect ourselves in the US, faster than fast! The bear is angry.
I’m all for this but sure hope the US is making new and more weapons to protect ourselves in the US, faster than fast! The bear is angry.

Good news for world peace when Russia burns all those weapons, the more the better!
Praise The Lord. God Bless Ukraine, US, EU, UK, NATO and other countries which have been supporting Ukraine. By the will of God, Ukraine will win this war against evil Putin's aggression. God Bless democracy.
Respect to the brave guy for press in the beginning.. Pulled the elderly guy around the corner..
Steel plant putin no last warning,they going to war fully ukrein;zelensky need talk he is not for peace,this usa made a war for fools eu
Ukraine president is an actor and a puppet... I heard since the war began,  he has been so sad he hasn't been able to maintain an erection long enough to play the piano... or so upset he doesn't eve  feel like dressing up in drag with his mates
God will bless all the supporters of Ukraine. expecially the USA
Why the USA is not doing nothing to stop this war? Because it’s not good for businesses dear,because you don’t provoke,trigger,incite,promote,organize a war to create a financial European/Russian crisis and stop before your goals are done,because in this war USA/Rusia the Ukrainians and Russians put the deads because,because,because. This war should never have happened in the first place and blaming just Putin it’s not enough if we want to live in a better world This is not a war of good vs evil , it’s a war of evil vs evil and the rest of the world we have to paid the price looking impotent,tired,disgusted. The EEUU are dangerous for the balance of the peace in world and they would be the trigger of the III world war and blame somebody else like always sad nonetheless true.
Kermit looks more real
The muppet show 3.0
this weapons are taken by russians :) it will be used against ukraine now, well done Zelenskyy
Kirby needs to be in Gitmo with the rest of the Russia Russia Russia Lies.
UrrrRRaaaaa
so the partners are just pushing for a nuke war and than there will be no winners just dead people and a waste land,
Why is all this on YouTube American Policy revealed to much information stop it. Always flex talk to much.
Useless war for Ukraine even if they lost to Russia or win with USA they are are economically socially and culturally will be  enslave to either one.
why is a country which apparently produced 40% of the worlds wheat , as well as oil  etc  so broke ? and why is  uk going into iraq ignored almost applauded  and yet when putin does it he is the devil in diguise ? why have people been shouting racist for 2 years now supporting real right wing racists in ukraine ? and why has the uk spent 320 BILLION a year protecting us from a russia which cant even get a few hundred vehicles into a neigbouring country . let alone attack a coutry 4000 miles away across a channel of water.
Now let them crush the red army...Slava Ukraine !  Putin is a representative of a medieval state thats based on oppression and violence. Shame on that little gremlin in the Kremlin. Russia once had a rich culture but is now nothing but a parasitic agressor. No high tech industry, but warfare. Shame on Kremlin and their victimhood that justifies their murdering and raping. Shame on Kremlin. Shame on oligarchs who are vampires that suck the blood out of Russian ordinary good people. No democracy but ruled as a third world islamic country, with a classical dictator who actually decapitates his opponents if he is not being adored. This country also has a space programm, like, modern and medieval times coexisting. How odd....but then you realize this lunatic also have access to Abombs....better take him out today. Slava Ukraine !
This is a disaster, USA is making it worse.. nobody  can see
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦✊✊✊✊❤️💋🇦🇺
Awesome, GOD help Ukrainia.
Weapons are secondary but courage is first.
https://youtu.be/aLv-W9eeJsE Multi-billionaire mob boss Vlad Putin and his inner circle Oliargh gang members build luxury 500+ milion dollar yachts in the West because they want the best and party in Monaco or Dubai. Money that as we now know was stolen from Russia and luckely not spend on the banckrupt Russian army.
Thank you, God!

May the Good Lord Brave you Ukranians, feel powered, feel extraordinarily stronger, the heavens are watching you shall win, we shall win. Thanks to NATO and its allies for doing the necessary, do not tire up giving the support needed by our Brothers and sisters in Ukraine. Sorry for losing the lives of the innocent citizens, sorry once more. Putin is running his last lap on this earth, he shall never win this war, he is a friend to satan, the devil, shame on him and big shame on all those who are in support to this course.

Olaf Scholz und Gerhard Schröder, zwei Bundeskanzler die unserem Land und der Welt schweren Schaden zufügen.  Scholz spielt das Putin-Spiel. Wladimir bedrohe mich und ich bleibe im Gebüsch, denn die anderen werden es schon machen. Schröder bereut nicht, dass er mit Putin befreundet ist und Deutschland so abhängig von russischem Gas gemacht hat.  Beide glauben, dass die Ukraine der Preis sind unseren weiteren Wohlstand zu sichernund für warme Wohnungen. In Syrien und Georgien hat Putin Zehntausende Menschen töten lassen, um die Kriege zu gewinnen. Stehen uns die Toten in der Ukraine kulturell näher?  Die Putin-Freunde argumentieren, dass die Ukraine tausende von Russen in der Ukraine getötet hat. Jetzt töten die Russen tausende Ukrainer. 15.000 Russen sollen in der Ukraine getötet worden sein. Wird Putin den Krieg beenden, wenn 15.000 Ukrainer gestorben sind?  Putin teilte mit, dass jeder Russe zehn Mal wertvoller sei. 150.000 tote Ukrainer. Kinder, Frauen und Mütter.   Heute zum orthodoxen Osterfest hat sich Putin im Gottesdienst noch einmal segnen lassen. Ein Sohn Satans hat einen anderen Sohn Satans gesegnet.   Keinem Mörder und Kinderschänder vergibt Gott. Wie mag es den Russen gehen, die sich freiwillig dem Satan hingeben?
Putin has to be taken out of power completely. He's been crossed that line once his me started killing women, children, defenseless Ukrainian people and even rapping women which is a no-no. Those Russians who decided to kill anyone deserve to be behind bars for the rest of their lives. And as for Putin, he should be in front of a firing squad.
I’m sure Trustfund Trudeau provided garden hoses, picnic tables and traffic cones. Non- lethal aid……….. beating up protesters at home while he virtue signals peace and non violence!!!!!
get them russia
Hope Zelenskyy sees  the reason(s)why it had to take this long..understand he felt he may never get what he asked for unless he showed he was going to give his best to kick the Russians' asses with or without help if it had to come to that... The Afghanies didn't put any effort at all in using all the help they  were given when the chips were down... sorry about all your countrymen that perished...
Its because midterm elections are coming up and Bidens Numbers are Down, Biden stopped the flow of weapons into Ukraine, Trump sent them(javlins and stingers) when he was still in office. Biden stopped because he didnt want to escalate tensions with Russia. 2024 cant come soon enough
Tuhan memberkati seluruh pejuang ukraine🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Fake
Maybe with all these new weapons, Ukraine will invade Russia.
I've seen Zolensky's name spelled four different ways. Which is it??
GOD BLESS ZELENSKY HIS COURAGE AND ALL UKRAINE SOLDIERS AND FOREIGN MERCENARIES TO FIGHT EVIL BUTCHER AND PSYCHOTIC PUTIN
Yeah keep pour oil.. On fire
Biden is reacting instead of acting! Always one step behind! Heavy weapons should have been sent a long time ago.
You people are so damn dumb.
Yes.  Finally and Godspeed President Zelensky and the lions of Ukraine.  When Putin started this "WAR", the world did not believe that Ukraine could resist them.  The world only offered to evacuate and retreat.  Later, they expected to condemn Russian aggression.  But in a demonstration of selflessness, resilience and a courage not demonstrated in generations, the Ukrainian Armed Forces not only resisted, but repelled Russian aggression.  The world is taken aback by this demonstration and the tide has turned.  The dogs in Moscow can only threaten nuclear war because the petulant child isn't having his way.  It's pathetic.  More weapons are coming into Ukraine because the free world knows that Ukrainians have the stones to use them.  This paper tiger, trash army that Moscow sent to tyrannize Ukraine is in shambles and even the Russian people know it.  They are led by a thug, mob boss who has tyrannized them.  The world knows it.  The Russian people know it and enough is enough.  It's time for little Vlad to step down and accept his comeuppance.  I'd feel sorry for this pathetic, little man if he hadn't slaughtered thousands of innocent people.  Die Vlad.  Your army is pathetic and so are you.  You know what you are.  Now, the west is gonna see you get what you earned.  Thank President Zelensky you scumbag.   Long live Ukraine!
God bless everyone supporting Ukraine. God bless the people of Ukraine   God speed
What Putin is doing is not good at all! Killing of even children and pregnant women, one day Putin will regret for what he has done to Ukrainians.
F..king idiots.
Peace and Glory to Ukraine!
I suggest watching Ukrainian Agony. Great documentary to show zelenskys Ukraine. How the people of the east have had to live for 8 miserable years. Then journalists who actually report from Ukraine & actually speak to the people. Like Patrick Lancaster, Graham Phillips or badvolf. I pray for the people of Ukraine. Specifically those in the east. That Putin is able to rid Ukraine of Nazis since zelensky can, or will, not. And I pray the nationalists & military within Azovstal plant let the people go. Safely. Do not harm them if they choose to surrender or accept aid. So many opportunities to avoid this. I wish Putin never stepped foot in Ukraine. I wish Ukraine had a strong leader who can’t be bought & able to demilitarize his country for his people’s lives 🇺🇦🙏🇷🇺
Hope everything will be okay
Ukraine has been defending herself against Russian attacks for far too long. Ukraine should now be on the offensive. Attack is the best form of defence.
Ukraine HAS TO prevail in the war. Period. It’s that important to the civilized world.
Flag sex is fine. Stop tip toeing around the issue and give them what they need,
"Proof that an independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin". Veiled threat or what?
keep all these thank you vids in your minds.  in a year we will be seeing GTFO out of our country and a couple of US flag burning.  however they will happily keep all those that were given without any financial recuperation.
Congratulations Present Zelensky  for winning the battle God be with you always
"Freedom must be armed better than tyranny" -Zelensky
FROM WAR MONGERS    TO   EXTEND THE KILLING    THIS WAR WILL END AS RUSSIA VICTORIOUS
Good that good... Money for free.. Weapons for free.... Good NATO and allies... Good... Send more money for Ukraine.. Again again and again... Until your own country poor and get a high inflation.... 😂 😂 😂... Good send again and again

Let's see how far Biden and the west are willing to risk the world, in order to push their agenda...
Little does he know that they are providing weapons to elongate the war
Zelensky net worth 1.5 billion us dollars plus property in Florida and Italy. Maybe he could toss in a couple bucks ya know a couple of shotguns some of those Koch pistols those are pretty nice ya know something
Stop this war  and talk
*WORLD WAR 3 IN 2022?*  I believe WW3 kicks of this year.  This is how I draw that conclusion:  Jesus is the Word of God and all scripture testifies if Him:  Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. John 5:39 KJV  Moses is a prototype of Jesus and returned to save his nation at 80:  And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.  Exodus 7:7 KJV  The Moses story is the Jesus story and God requires a repeat:  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. Ecclesiastes 3:15 KJV   God teaches us to number our days:  So teach us to number our days, That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. Return, O LORD, how long? Psalm 90:12‭-‬13(a) KJV  But if you're not watching you will not know the hour of His coming:  If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. Revelation 3:3(b) KJV   80 - 7 years tribulation = 73 Israel is 73 now Wisdom in Hebrew = 73 (chokmah) I believe WW3 starts this year  *WW1 START DATE* 28/7/1914 28+7+19+14 = 68  *WW2 START DATE* 1/9/1939 1+9+19+39 = 68  *WW3 START DATE?* = 24/2/2022  24+2+20+22 = 68  *ATOMIC RAPTURE* https://youtu.be/yImoFzFWcI4 ATOMOS = 1 COR. 15:52🔥  For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3 KJV   1 Thessalonians 5:3 = 153 Great catch (John 21.11) = 153 73 (rapture) + 80 (return) = 153 Isaiah 53 = 153   God bless you ❤
Not enough more more more, he needs more more more.
MAKE RUSSIA PAY FOR REBUILDING UKRAINE.
Try invading the USA . Russia , where America is the gun.
Get ready for more Ukraine, if not actual NATO involvement , fuk Russia.
Asking Putin to spare civilians is like asking a snake to give up it's prey after starting to swallow part of it. Putin wants some of them to fill in for Russians fleeing his country to the west rather than live through another failed Soviet era. Almost a new slave trade again.
FINALLY !!!! THANK GOD !!!
Western governments have no balls. They're scared?
Even if Russia goes back its isnt worth a penny for Ukraine
Now technically this thw whole of west vs Russia.
HE  got weapons and more weapons but at the cost of 1000 of innocent lives and damage costing Billions
Thank God. Be strong Ukraine.
I LOVE YOU JOHN - KEEP UP THE GREAT STRAIGHT FORWARD REPORTING OF THE FACTS AND KEEPING US PROPERLY INFORMED!
Puck Futin.
let's annhilate the orcs.
If you want to see the other side of this conflict you  need to go to Intel  Slava Z on telegraph and  Patrick Lancaster on telegraph who films from eastern  Ukraine in places like Mariupol.
All Democratic Countries must join The Democratic Block and turn our backs on doing business with any regime that is communist,  authoritarian and dictatorship. A Democratic Block of Countries together can support our own oil and gas , Food, services, Climate and build together a Mega Super Military to protect the Block where no threat,  bullying or attack on a Democratic member will be tolerated.
Thanks President Biden for helping Ukraine. But at what cost? Ukraine is being obliterated. It's real sad.
THE WAY THING HAVE BEEN GOING IT SEEM THE WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE THROWN UKRAINE AND ITS PEOPLE TO HUNGRY MONSTER THE RUSSIAN WOLF AS DAILY FEED FOR LAST 60 days. GERMANY IS SITTING CHANCELLOR OLAFT SCHOLZ IS "WORRIED THAT RUSSIAN WILL THROWN NUCLEAR BOMB ON HIS HEAD" ALL NONE SENSE > GERMANY FRANCE ITLAY AND 10 other EUROPEAN NATO COUNTRIES HAVE SOLD MODERN WEAPON TO RUSSIAN AFTER 2015 BAN ON RUSSIA > DOUBKE STANDARD BY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SHEDDING CROCODILE TEARS FOR UKRAINE BUT REFUSES TOSEND MORDERN HEAVY WEAPONS TO UKRAINE . THEY WILL TO SEND OLD DISCARDED WEAPONS AS SPARE PARTS > WONDER IF EUROPEAN SOLDIERS WILL REPAIR OLD TANKS OR PLANE WHILE WAR IS GOING ON FULL SWING> NOT A G+SINGLE WESTERN COUNTRY HAS SENT MORDERN PLANE TANKS MISSILES HEAVY ARMOUR BUT CRAPS FROM DISCARDED BIN TO UKRAINE SHAMEFUL
Now give them cruise missiles to take out the longest bridge in Europe, then you can really see Putin's hand shake.
Easter florals looking for a social group to support you .. what's wronge with independence
CUT THE CRAP WHY CANNOT GERMANY FRANCE AND ITALY these are the countries who send MORDERN HEAVY WEAPONS TO SUPER POWER RUSSIAN DESPITE THE BAN IN 2015 SUCH HYPOCRITES> GERMANY UNDER OLAF SCHOLZ IS GIVE DAM EXCUSES "WORRIED OF NUCLEAR WAR" from Russian after sleeping with the eniMY  RUSSIAN HE SEEM TO BE WORRIED ALL THESE COOK AND BULL EXCUSES > GERMANY IS WORKING VERY HARD TO DESTROY UKRAINE  BY SITTING AND DOING ZERO TO HELP UKRAINE . WORSE THAN ADOLF HITLER  ALMOST THE SAME CRIME LEAVING UKRAINE TO BE EXTERMINATED BY RUSSIAN> SHAMELESS .
Thank you to all the countries that have helped Ukraine fight off a these monsters invading there country.  Gos be with Ukraine! 💛🇺🇦💛🇨🇦💛
Globalist bringing “Democracy” to dictatorship(Russia, Sri Lanka) and “Tyranny” to Democracies( Canada, Australia,etc)The Great Reset is global as the Bible has accurately predicted. The New World Order will be a “benevolent- for those that submit in the name of (what’s best for you)”.  When you see this things- Jesus told His disciples “ lift up your head, for your redemption draweth nigh”.
Save the Heros from Mariupol and any Trapped Ukranian soldiers and Freedom fighters.  My Dearest Ukranian Comrades, Dig the well into the ground where you stand on, to get water. Dig the tunnels to one or more suitable direction/s to get out from the trapped surrounded by invader Putin's Armies.  Continue Guerilla Warfare. Don't make a group or unit more than 3 fighters at one place to reduce impact of Air strike or Heavy artillery.  Ukrainian Comrades outside from those traps must help focusing to help them out the trapped heros from Mariupol and other region to regroup and lead the Ukrainian People Defense Force, PDFs.  Continue to fight Guerilla Warfare. Avoid Conversational war style to fight against big Nations and it's Armies. Try not to stay more than 3 at a place to reduce impact of Heavy Artillery, missiles and Air strikes.  Be Brave...Be Save.. Fight to Live.. Don't waste any live in vain. May Gods Bless You All freedom fighters. You are the Heros of our Democratic World. 🇻🇳🇺🇦🇻🇳

Putin must be defeated totally. Russia can't be allowed to gain any thing from Ukraine. And sadly the troops of Russia must be given as massive a casualty count as is humanly possible. Russia only understands blood and death and history shows even then they often continue with their conquest plans. Till the cost in equipment, men, and prestige is more than they can bare Russia will continue to take lands from any countries they choose.
UN intervention now! Stop that inhuman war from Russia in the Ukraine. Stop Putin! Close the skies! End Putins reign of terror!
American propaganda will not change the military map.
Ukraine got some nice hardware from the US 🇺🇸 Looks like Putin got his answer to his threats 😆🤣😂
Azov battalion neo nazis hope they lose evil scum on earth they are using their own people as shields shameful evil scummy behaviour isn't that what the UK and US fought against in WW2 against hitler now they support neo nazis Lol everything gone backwards I am ashamed that UK and US is supporting this evil act by giving them weapons I just feel sorry for the innocent civilians that are stuck there in Ukraine they should evacuate all civilians immediately but unfortunately they dont want to SMH 🤔🤦🏻‍♂️
Chechs gave them 100 tanks and 17 planes romania gave tanks as well .they got over 55 helicopters too. GLORY TO UKRAINE
The relentless resistance of the Ukrainian forces against Russians is amazing. We are with you to the core of our being. Thanks to God..!
meanwhile there are many video shown Russian troops give food to Ukrainian how ironic
The President of Ukraine, Zelenskiy, is hero in difficult times
Get the dumbski third world army kicked in the ass SLAVA Ukraine
WW3, here we come.  How did a corrupt government in Kyiv, beholden to Nazis, convince NATO and the US to join this disaster?  Destroying the next generation of Ukrainians wasn't enough?   I don't see how central and western europe recover from what is coming their way financially, demographically, economically, or politically.  The US is just lucky it has the oceans on either side.
A former comic winning in Ukraines battle against Russia and a clown in the Oval Office just losing his mind .
The West need Neo Nazis 😅😅😅😅
Fire of hell for Ukraine
Russian army and terrorist militias around the world are very thankful to receive American weapons LMAOOO    https://youtu.be/W5y_PedSufA
Now,  if we could finally support our own border from the constant killing by invasion of drugs, human trafficking, and terrorists crossing our border daily....Hmmmmm🤔 is that not worthwhile for us to protect our country???
Darn! Can we trade presidents? Biden for Ukraines 🇺🇦  president
Putin just💩shit💩on his pants!!
We are also thankful all countries support Ukraine this war against Russia God bless all of you here 🙏💯❤️
Ukranine is being destroyed. Zelenksy is a disgrace. Blinken is a Soros affiliate. Zelenksy I feel so ashamed for him. Peace Not more weapons .
Russia will prevail! The Nazis shall not win!
As soon as I saw that VOA is funded in part of whole by the American government, I stopped watching. Anything coming from our government is suspect so if you're in a country other than the U.S., please fact check and don't take anything they say at face value.
peace+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bravo Amen 🙏
Anybody can win if your provided the weapons.  Besides the Ukraine is not NATOs partner. To many criminals in the Ukraine coming to the US.
Finally
Warning, Putin bots in the comments section!
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦  I love Ukraine 🇺🇦  Can’t wait for the day I return to beautiful Ukraine 🇺🇦
What are Americans were douting  Ukraine would will? Politicians?  U.S. politicians right now are clounds.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
There is and has been a very constant flow of aid going into ukraine. Good to see
if its victory, send the usa pepeol home ,and start building.
The hesitation to provide certain weapons did relate to Zelensky's seemingly disrespectful, demanding attitude. Then I reposted his face when 45 caused said attitude, it went viral& he got his arms. Let's run Zelensky 2024, call it an exile if you want to he can heal US& unite... in my humble opinion. If not he may takeover Russia ( has 70 year old Vlad picked a successor?)& US& THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BOTH THEIR PLAN ALL ALONG.
we dont see the comedien around the table, where is the comic, in  israel.
SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦❤️😍
president god With you
Good progress. Pray and work for peace.
Sorry our leaders are such as assholes ukraine but they finally woke up to the Russian Nazi Government
PUTIN has alzeimers he is attacking Ukraine as a way of taking the focus off how weak he is. Only the Ukrainian's were stronger than his feeble mind realized😂

Good luck for Ukrainian soldiers where receive the arms and ammunition via NATO,
Good support for Ukrainian thankful to NATO
God will help Ukraine thru US ANG UK AND OTHER FRIENDLY NATION. THANKS GOD
Why did Blinken and Austin secretly  meet the Ukraine president in Kyiv in the middle of night!
Biden's team weakness foreign policy made the most dangerous world enemies in much better condition! - After Biden team rejected the 'no air fly zone' request and they did not deliver air defense missiles,  jets and Heavy artillery with a range of 40 miles to the Ukraine, Russian jets freely fly anywhere they like and drop their heavy bombs over innocents! The War criminals fired rockets even in Easter to kill Ukrainian civilians!  - China signed an agreement with Solomon Islands to control ships and carry out logistical operations and stop and transit in the Solomon Islands according to its needs. Chinese security forces could  establish "social order" in these islands and also have the authority to protect the safety of Chinese employees and large projects! - April 20, during a telephone conversation of Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Feng with Lloyd Austin, he stressed that Taiwan is part of China and that the Chinese military will resolutely defend its sovereignty and territory!!
Ukraine vs Afghanistan. What a big contrast in the people wanting to fight.
And the Ukrainian president is right for saying don't come empty handed, lip service isn't gonna keep innocent people from getting killed and drive the russians out, its about time they're finally getting the heavier firepower and it needs to keep coming just as if the united states is directly fighting the russians.
Russia can only win this war by using a Nuclear weapon, and I belief they will eventually use it.
I guess NATO and the UN got exactly what they wanted.
My government arming Nazi, personally I find it appalling and probably a war crime.
I will say it. Yes Ukraine will push Russia back across. the boarder.   Biden people just are not much help.
If Russia loses this then Putin knows he will go the way of Hitler or Mussolini. Slava Ukraine ... Kia Kaha.
God is with you!!
First time they said thank you   So that good thing maybe we are all getting on the same page
Slava Ukraine💙💛
These weapons should have supplied weeks ago, Biden is always ten steps behind.
🤡🤡 Give me more guns so I can keep shooting so I can get shot back instead of reactivating talks of peace.
And then Russia said Thanks to USA and Ukraine because russia found them 😆😂😂
Dont worry Ukraine,  I sent you a Bramastra to use on Putin.
GOOD!
Take these weapons Ukraine 💪 and get a buffer zone into Belarus and Russia
Yes i'm happy for  the US to helping in President in Ukraine Country God always protect all of you
HOORAY !!!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸❤❤🙏🙏💪💪💪
How can any European official think that talking to Putin would help? Thes people are seriously deluded, and are helping the Russia not any movement for peace. What is need are far more heavy weapons including fighter jets ad taks from the European who support Putin war on terror with their constant purchase of Russian energy th Germans have given a million times more aid to  the Russias than to the Ukrainians how are they allies? Same with Switzerland who are supporting Putin and his billions.
🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇦💕👍👌
All talk from this politicians! Why don’t they shut up and grab a riffle or tank go to the front line and see them cry for mommy! Warmongering idiots!
Con el suministro de armamento, Ucrania se está convirtiendo en parte de la OTAN. A quien menos le conviene una guerra nuclear es a Moscú. La reacción de los moscovitas debe ser en este momento enérgica y crucial. 👥⚕️👥
Putin lay down your arms  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEQoDN-IWR0
Where ever tere is a war , The USA is there to provide weapons to nazis , terrorists , isis , mujahideen  Sudam , or they need wars . Keeps the arms business going .

UN should be dissolved they are impotent they become the problem not the solution. Many killers and corrupt members who runs the show.
Dementia Joe kept insisting Putin was afraid of him and did nothing while they watched Putin amass troops at the border.
Finaly some great news, thank you America for providing the help Ukraine desperatly needed to defend their country & save their people...Bravo
Will the nukeuler warheads now at the bottom of the black sea cause any harm if they axadently go off ?    Could this turn our to be a blessing for the refugees?      Could this be the statement in Revelations,  and the seas will boil ?
Its about time now lets hop its not to late
Uk, USA and European countries keep proving more and more deadly weapons to Ukraine to drag this war as far as possible to weaken Russia and they are Absolutely not doing anything to stop this war, this war will not stop until the whole Ukraine turned in to a graveyard.
#PutPutinDown

комик слишком много мечтает понятно что украинское государство предало Россию как друга а Украина больше поддерживает лицемерных США  Free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
What a pile of crap for a army Russia  , all they can do is wreck the buildings, execute  by standards and rape Ukrainian women. Pathetic army
American news channel?  Glory to Russia... I hope Russia wins
Slava Ukraine!
Awesome!  Good to know they got the weapons to defend the occupiers.
Zelensky is Ukraine's Dave!
Americans think 💭 Ukrainians can win…said that about Vietnam…Iraq…Afghanistan & Syria 🇸🇾…get their intelligence wrong again
Russian Commandments:  believe in Putin.  make idols out of liars and murderers.  stick the symbols of your faith everywhere.  kill.  commit adultery.  steal.  bear false witness against your neighbor.  desire your neighbor's wife, desire your neighbor's house, desire everything that your neighbor and your far away have.  deny everything.  run.
Nato and west are guilty for this bloodbath.. no help will stop Russia and damn sure nobody will get involved directly to help ukraine. Hope war ends soon.
Putin is losing war anyway.
Zelensky reminds me of King David in the Bible who  slained the philistine Giant Goliath..( Putin the giant will fall
how long does America has to spoon feed Ukraine?
I'm glad you finally got some of the weapons you need from us and others. Not sure about France and Germany. If not shame on them.
Disabled Russian military for good
Rusia se convierte en el nuevo país Paría del mundo, su recuperación llevará décadas, así que el pueblo Ruso va a sufrir por generaciones el daño causado a la valiente Ucrania. El pueblo Ruso debe sacar a Putin del Poder YA, los arruinara a la miseria de la antigua URSS. Todos los países vecinos de Rusia van a solicitar su ingreso a la OTAN y UE, esto va a fortalecer a la UE y a la OTAN en su radio de protección a Europa y el mundo. Putin y Rusia son Criminales de Guerra, cobardes y mentirosos, se han ensañado contra un.pais indefenso y pequeño como Ucrania. Putin es el nuevo HITLER, su Fin será igual. La OTAN  EEUU y UE deben parar a Putin y Rusia YA, o los invadirá a todos, No respeta las leyes internacionales, Ni la soberanía e Integridad Territorial de ningún pais. Si Putin y Rusia se sienten tan.poderosos por qué no atacan e invaden a Japón.o EEUU, a ver qué les pasaría en sus vidas y sus familias. Dios, San Miguel Arcángel, La Virgen de Fátima con la PAZ, Proteccion, Justicia, Libertad, Integridad, Territorial, Soberanía y Vida de Ucrania. Amen
wonderful, keep up the good works..God bless Ukrain
They should help stop this war, not put more fuel into it. The people are suffering while the politicians are getting richer
Zelensky is not that smart. You want US soldiers to be in the frontline. Ukrainian soldiers are getting killed and Us is not helping at all.
send all the Russian orcs to hell, for freedom and liberty and for alle the civilian victims
Russia is trying to stop the Nato threat on its border as Nato keeps funding the war.
What about Palestine the inversion by Israel ?.
I never doubted they wouldn't win..
Военные действия должны быть остановлены https://youtu.be/Pv4yvjabs_0
Thank you US and Allied Nations for supporting Ukraine. Victory for Ukraine! God bless  Ukraine and Allied Nations.
Stay Strong Ukraine!!! 🇺🇦💪
With USA on board, Ukraine has a chance. The big EU Countries have failed badly. Combined and all on board the EU could have made a much bigger difference. My Country is doing it's bit, but it doesn't have the large inventory to change the tide like a combined effort from Europe or the US..
Thank USA 🇺🇸 🙏
Denys Shmyhal is pronounced: De-NIS, the letter 'i' as in the words fit, hit, bit, with  the accent on the second syllable.  SHMI-hal. The letter 'i' as in the words hit, lit, fit and the letter 'a' as in mama or father.  The accent on the first syllable.  This isn't astrophysics.  Please make the effort.
Zelensky is a puppet
Kharkiv is pronounced: KHAR-keev. The letter 'a' as the 'a' in the words mama, father. The letter ''i" is pronounced like the  letter 'e' in the word 'eve'.  The accent is on the first syllable.
That's bulshit the Ukrainian have been getting weapons constantly from the start so don't fucken make out there only just getting them
I bet Russia wish they had Ukrainian fighters on their side,  lol
A Ukrainian lead a small country (22) to fight against world  no. 2nd  A russian over excited over small land destroyed what was built 50 yrs invasion of south Ukraine war damage all buildinds that they wanted to occupation A chinese oversees but over excited over COVID zero destroyed a country built 30 years with covid zero reset every things he oversees A Germany chicken was so selfish but excited to send old weapons to Ukraine to reduce ammo stock kept many years back that to stingy to scrap, A  French  like to talk to Nazi russian only one w/o Intel in the world A US man old but wise  giving weapons each week to Ukraine to fight the Ukraine invasion A hk butcher was banned using the  youtube johnlee2022 banned after China's central government imposed a sweeping security law aimed at snuffing out dissent. A taiwan who track extreme closely lost control of omicron spread wasting resources daily
American hippocrates of the world , America will stab you in the back eventually,  megalomania country run by power hungry corrupt hippocrates,  Go Russia 🇷🇺
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
The US needs to be sending observers with every shipment, to verify where all our weapons go, and which are destroyed, etc.  That's nice that we rushed them out the door in the early days, now we need to make sure they all go to fighting the war, and aren't sold off to foreign govts or end up in private hands.
Fight to the last Ukraine
Too much talk and slow action !
NATO should come up stand aside Ukraine in terms of combat weapons
VIVA UKRANIA!!!
Still no use Zelensky.  It's full NATO vs Russia but Russia will still conquer Donbass
nský už nepotrebuje jednať o mieri. Moderátor
What about the thousands of humans killed in Ukraine. Are they going to give rebirth ?
If Putin kills everyone in that steel factory... The repercussions and consequences will be his undoing. Every Ukrainian will fight to the death for revenge. Tens of Millions relentlessly grinding a guerilla insurgence for years cannot be defeated. It cannot.
I love the dirty flag behind Zelenski. Terrific showmanship.
You are welcome Mr President
Putin is war criminals who are thief invasions on Ukraine
Nothing's free in this world rember that
Russia won't stop till all them little country's fight it
Americans and zelensky have already killed millions of innocent ukrainians. Fruit of having a comedian president

If they gave him these weapons in the first place Ukraine would have already won. Just think about how much they're doing without these weapons and how much more can be done with them
PUTLER = enemy of FREEDOM and democracy, enemy of the World. The evil dictator must be removed from power and jailed for ever.👹👹👹👹👹
PUTLER = enemy of FREEDOM and democracy, enemy of the World. The evil dictator must be removed from power and jailed for ever.👹👹👹👹👹
Look at Nuland how exciting she is giving weapons to his puppets to keep the war going just for US interests 😁
Good,  Ukraine  with God

War for business!

USA begging to be nuked
there's probably a need for long range missile systems and torpedoes against these seven submarines from Sebastopol that are shooting all these cruise missiles too.
Give the ukrainians what they need not a little here not a little there establish a supply train and keep it running 24/7. Just don't let the Americans be in charge of it, our leaders don't have any idea of what a supply train is and how to establish one or keep one going. Slava Ukraine!🤠
This never would have happened to begin if Biden wasn't such a pussy
Hopefully the whole world continues to support and supply all they needs may God bless and protect Ukraine
Ask Georgia😂
Hoorah.
Even with the west supplying weapons, Ukraine isn't going to win. Which simply means prolonging the agony and more deaths. Let Russia destroy the Nazi militias and keep NATO  from its borders which is what all this was about in the first place.
Russians made them selves liars...Putin is losing credibility...God save the Ukrainian people 💙💛💙💛
Little is getting to the eastern front, US tax payers now paying $500 Million for the Ukrain federal workers. WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR THEIR SECRETARYS and Janitors?  Most the videos coming out are of them using their own weapons not the BILLIONS in munitions we sent.
Sad to hear our help will save thousands, when 45 million ppl have been affected. The plant alone has ove 1,000 I read.
Time to be a LEADER now Mr Zelensky.  There's factions in your country you need to get rid of. This is what the Cuban missle crisis was going to look like... history this time didn't repeat itself.

For 8 years Ukraine is bombing Donbas killing allot off villagers and Azov Nazis was committing war crimes against them , now we give them more guns ? Diss is crazy
Crap news channel.
MESSAGE TO JOE BIDEN AND ALL LEADERS AND MINISTERS REPUBLICANISMS THAT OCCUPY TRUSTED POSTS.  A sword ⚔️ Unsoncreen has been left to the American people in two Vosos. On the one hand, the United States is very concerned about the internal affairs of countries that do not submit: but on the other side we are seeing them the rest of their lives under the great imminent crisis created by these terrorists commercially speaking so that the dollar 🇺🇸 has become da And it has undertook the United States 🇺🇸 in an abyss which no wealthy can solve this scareful and terrible crisis. Floods, massacres, shootings, fires 🔥 Natural disasters, increasing debts, the great defeat of the United States 🇺🇸 in Afghanistan 🇦🇫, the Great River of Immigrants, the crises of unemployment and Tor To the blame of who all this? No doubt that it is completely caused by Nazi republicanisms under global warming through Fraking. This must be reported to all people around the world 🌎. We understand very well because rivers of immigrants in the United States 🇺🇸 is because the United States does not cease to grow to the countries supposedly allied of them, they have them violated, restricted, friz, cloud And the world should be released from the coin that ulives the Wachington D.C elite. Which has blackmailed and has attacked the peoples of the world to make economic damage. However, as immigrants do not agree with their open internedist politicians have become against immigrants, and have trampled the vote of US citizens, their votes have been denied and invalid from Joe B They are the republicanisms who will impose presidents and leaders at their cravings. This issue is in the hands of Joe Biden if this finite human being precede the voton of the third world war will upload the price of oil which we have never seen from then. Gasoline, natural gas and electric light; These three main ones will be severely affected. The devil is at home and has tormented Washington DC, with earthquake and disgusting political storm. Each one devestant for his right according to the law. The most violent and rebellious nation on our planet Earth is without a doubt; The United States of North America. To understand this we have to return to investigate the emergence and stories of that nation. The committed and threats of the previous republicanisms.  (Carter) and his threats; 1 El Salvador, Guatemala, Angola, Afghanistan. (Clinton) Iraq, Sudan, Rwanda, Balkans. (George H W Buch) Soviet Union, Somalia, Panama. (George W BUCH) Iraq, Afghanistan. (Obama) Libya Syrya Yemen Afghanistan Ukrania.  Can the United States unite those who have divided? Oven not. Who is isolated to who? Who is dividing who? Who is tasting who? Can the United States remain standing at this crisis? Oviously no. What is the result of all this? The Great River of Immigrants who enter the United States No one can stop; Neither wall, or migration, nor military with all its elements, nor any other human being can stop this, besides the United States has become slaves of China and Russia. The current moment is of overwhelming interest for all republicanisms that occupy trusted posts, the republicanisms have chosen the most violent man that had never been since the foundation of the United States of North America. Thinkers of all classes and groupings as (www.LouchePac.com) (Larouche Pac in Spanish.) They have a fixed attention in the events that they themselves have produced in our thing. They observe the relationships that exist between the nations, they observe the intention that seizes all earthly element and recognize that this crisis rapidly evil worse, one after another and never cease until the time of the end. I ask: How do we know? For its fruits we will know them. Republicanisms have violated the freedom of election and freedom of conscience and human rights: Joe Biden has never won since by his attitude we identify him and his spirit of hatred and war against all; He is a hypocrite and dual-morable dictator and has passed through this world's judge and has tried to trample the OAS and all those who do not submit; Joe Biden is Adolf Hitler himself in our days called Nazi. Republicans never and never recognize their carriages as rebels and transgressors of all laws that are the fundamental basis of the nation. In the White House there is no democracy, I confirm it and denounced it. American democracy is completely erroneous and false, we have to be stupid and foolish to believe those leaders called "republicans" who are sitting within Washington DC. The United States represents ancient Babylonians, the nation of confusion. "Woe to the United States because it has a short time." One asks: When did this crisis began? On September 11, 2001, will this crisis recover in any time to come? Nooo ... !!! On the contrary, I will go from bad to worse, how do we know? For his attitude and the questions that make the candidates "there is no doubt". The United States of North America are judged by the world itself. The world knows very well that the United States is the one that generates all kinds of criminal group and Protestants who oppose violating all laws should be understood that they are used as a shield and cannon meat for American republicanisms As well as Americans have violated, not only the amendments of the Constitution, but also, international laws. This is the typical US policy and its recipes. It comes the worst scary and terrible crisis; Increasing debts, shootings, fires, war, killings, unemployment, criminal groups, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, natural desatures, floods, droughts, diseases as a result of hydra fracture These must be denounced to every human being around the world, the guilty and transgressors must be denounced and judged by Haver contaminated to our planet Earth, and by their acts and crimes and violation of laws. Republicanisms are a shame to everyone which we call interventionists, double moral, protectionism, separatists, fackey, genocidal, racist and have unleashed an economical gerra everywhere and this is against themselves their own sanc I ask, will these go wells all over the world? According to the Law Joe Biden is sentenced to death for averting the laws and for award past average of the law. That says the law. Copy and paste.
Ultimately , Ukraine will be reunited with the motherland , whether we like it or not !
Putin  Ufortently, next 100 years world will hait russians. Dont think it was smart.
The voice narrating drives me nuts
War salesman to help Naziland! Perfect US scenario as usual.
Ukraina 👍👍💪💪💪
The weapons and money flows to Ukraine but time is not on their side.  We hear that the Russian troops are short on training and supplies.  Think of this.  They can't just quit and go home.  If they did they would end up killed or in prison.  Also, it sure looks like Putin has a good hold on the eastern coast.  As time goes on and Putin wears (or kills)the Ukrainians out, he will gain even more territory and probably turn to neighboring countries, who will surrender simply because they do not have the means or will to carry out the war Ukraine has.  If things come to a standstill, Putin can always pollute the earth and turn to his nukes.  This as NATO and the rest of the world stand back and watch.  This could have been ended before it started, but like now, no one wanted to stand up to Putin.  Now, thousands of lives, billions of dollars, and destruction of a beautiful peace loving country later, we still stand back and refuse to stand up to Putin.
we belong a poor country we can only give the WEAPON OF PRAYER TO PROTECT UKRAINE'S COUNTRY AND TO WIN THE WAR..

I can't believe evil Putin is a Christian guy how can he killed innocent peoples
Before  accepting the next news report, perhaps we would be better off to question the motives behind the news report.  Is it really the truth that is being reported, or could this information benefit the billionaires and governments who are sharing it with us?  https://youtu.be/Uv_WWzjrUrI                   🖕🤠🖕
Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Thank Partners for "Finally" Purchasing over 2 billion dollars worth of weapons that they personally lobbied to make sure Ukraine needs.
I hear his still looking for more Weapons
This war is costing the American tax payers dearly...we'll be paying for this for years......let alone how much it cost us to rebuild Ukraine.
for a THRID time, weapons were immediately destroyed as soon as they got to the battle field. Yup..it happened AGAIN
Than an independent, sovereign Ukraine.
Meanwhile in reality Russia is moving forward with more strategic  territory secured in slow motion. And  currently achieving all its objectives whether you like it or not, those are facts.  But ofcouse you all have a right to exercise ignorance. And just stay in your echo Chambers of false western propaganda. The only people dying more will be the Ukrainians not you "arm chair keyboard warrior  generals".
West have been doing less for long time, act now or never
I can not help but notice the difference between Afghanistan and the Ukraine. One nation would not  fight, and the other is fighting fiercely to remain independent.  Be glad we left Afghanistan. The Ukraine has earned our respect and assistance
Finaly
Finally???  He has been getting them all along.  They wouldn't have lasted this long if it wasn't for American weapons. Billions of dollars worth
Live free and survive 💯💯🙏
"REMOVE ALL ORCS" 👍 🚀   🇺🇦 FREEDOM BROTHERS of USA
And they will be destroyed by the Russians before they can be used . Bravo Poutine ! Biden to be sent to a asylum !
WE ARE PROUD OF PRES BIDEN, BORIS JOHNSON AND OTHER GOOD LEADERS HELPING UKRAINE, PRES ZELENSKY
And they are going to end up just like the first $800M sent https://youtu.be/yc5zB92sfUA
GOD BLESS UKRAINE, USA, CANADA, FRANCE, AUSTRALIA, GERMANY, JAPAN, UK, TURKEY, EU, UN, NATO, G7, G20 AND ALL GOOD ALLIED COUNTRIES
Who's in command off the military there?
France is not asking for permission  to send humanitarian aid at all  , just fake news
The Russian armed forces have been depleted now. Even though they changed the war plan it is too late. Putin can’t survive this and he is to blame. He is the cause of the corruption and incompetence.
I read people rejoycing, saying "Glory do God". Guys, the true evil of this war is the US and it's western allies. I'm sure that God will never end this war for their true goal is not to end this war in order to profit from it and test Russia's real capabilities and drag it to an endless war that will bankrupt it.
Zelenski Western puppet blood on his hands
Russia will not let the Azov fighters get out of there a live. Because they are too good. If they gets out, they will help their army a lot. Also Azov destruction can play a key role in Ukranian force morale. I'm pretty sure, that russia will never let them go and Ukraine must help them get out. Those soldiers are worth more than any other soldiers around Ukraine. For morale boost and also with knowledge they got in fight against russia all this time.
Que Dieu bénisse l’Ukraine ! Que Poutine aille en enfer !
The world is getting late to help on Ukraine.
While the Americans watch the war with popcorn 🤣
Wonder where those weapons are going to end up?? Remember  Stand with Afghanistan in 1979? How’d that work for you….
Cool points for the old man im press vest in the beginning of the video was kneeling down come like a true soldier wouldn't be surprised if he's in veteran
More weapons means more deaths, good luck Ukraine 👍😃
The USA are bad dreamers. All of you will leave Ukraine in the hands of the owners. USA should stop encouraging conflicts around the world.
Thank You America. Thank You to all Americans. Thank You President Biden and his Administration.
We pray for you guys 😭
Ukrainians are the bravest people in galaxy.   Great work USA in getting weapons to Ukraine.  John Quinn, Glasgow, UK.
The ,,Partners"  of zelinski must make another bussines with their army...america do not try to made an war in europe...east europe is not the america afganisthan....gooo brandon
The Donbast people need to feel free and secure from Ukrainian cruel killings. Americans journalists who have lived in Ukraine have videos about all those cruelty from Mariopol and Donbast civilians
America doesn't want to part from Ukrain. It's not going to save more lives. It's going to kill more soldiers, more civilians . That's the reason millions have been killed because of America's and Zelenski's dreams. Zelensk doesn't seem to care about all the innocent civilians killed in the last 8 years I Ukrain. It's stupidity against reality.
Give Ukrainian all the fucking tools they need and end this nonsense. Damn it.
Biden:  Send Ukraine more weapons and do not let them stop.  KILL, KILL, KILL !
Great more weapons will only prolong this war, the west must be mad not to see this, or do they want Ukraine to be obliterated for their own evil gains. These gains will be weapons sales boosting they’re own economy’s and the thought they may weaken Russia’s military. Well I hope everyone is happy that Ukraine will eventually be wiped of the map.
Anthony Blinkin A Blinkin Abe Lincoln. The world's truly a stage.
Next up hand them a few AC-130 gunships. Any convoy is doomed!
Viva ucrania su gente y todos los muertos que a matado este loco de Putin loco
Do you even know how to use it, you are always so high that you can’t even remember what you said each day nor can your eyes stay focus when you aren’t talking. Does the usa accidentally send you the drugs along with the weapons, so that’s why you are so happy about it
We are all behind you Ukraine, a big 🤞 you sendvthe Russians packing and Russia give up on this pointless horror of a war!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇬🇧🇺🇦
Gusta Meyer! Boochtie!!
Support from everyone but the Germans. People fought and died to hand Germany its democracy but they won't help their neighbours.
World War is coming come to Jesus
FINALLY the Biden Administration gets off it's @$$ and gives them heavy weapons.  Just think what they could have done with them four weeks ago.
Fuk this selenzky ! Let your people die everyday for waiting for arms instead going into negozation to end the conflict! We, here in europe is suffering for your stupidity! Your war is not our war!
Been waiting on this from the start. Good job on Biden and his team. On the whole US gov't. Glad to see the Ukrainians getting what they need. Let's keep it up!
Bunch of corrupt criminals
Great time for US MIC!
And here we go again.
'We could end US homelessness tomorrow  but we fuel the military-industrial complex'.  Why the US can’t solve homelessness?  Homelessness is costing taxpayers a lot of money.  In 2019, New York City spent a record-breaking $3 billion  to support its homeless population.  California is expected to break its record,  allocating $4.8 billion to the same issue over the next two years.   Despite the rising budget,  overall homelessness in the US  has improved by only 10% compared with 2007.
Why medical bills in the US are so expensive and out of control?  Medical bills are reported  to be the number one cause of US bankruptcies.  Over 2 million people are adversely affected by their medical expenses.  It’s an open secret in America  that calling for an ambulance  can be a financial gamble because of surprise bills.  There’s no way for patients to know  how much an ambulance will cost  before they get inside the vehicle,  and the final bill can be thousands of dollars with and without insurance.   The US spends about twice as much on health care  than other large and wealthy countries do.  But the US health care system is not as effective  when it comes to controlling costs  compared to systems in other countries.  And it’s a cure driven system, not a prevention driven system.   The US spends more per person on health care  than other high income countries,  but still has a lower life expectancy.  ‘We have poor outcomes relative to other countries.  We pay twice as much as any other country,  we pay more and get less.’
UK's Johnson admits 'Russia may win in Ukraine' EU capitulates and agrees to gas for Roubles.   Sanctions on Russian energy  do more harm than good to the West. US Treasury Secretary said.   ‘A total embargo on Russian energy imports  may do little to hinder Russia’s economy  while crippling US/Europe with staggering price increases.’
Why 90% of foreign military bases are American?  Do those bases actually represent US imperialism?   There are over 5,000 US military bases total,  with 750 bases overseas, in 80 countries and colonies,  the US has more foreign military bases  than any empire or country in world history.  More than 100 people from New Jersey high school diagnosed with brain tumors. Over the past 30 years, experts suspect  that a potential cancer cluster in New Jersey  may have an underlying cause.  'Forever chemicals' detected in water systems of 2,800 US cities. Growing concern over PFAS contamination  and pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the chemicals in drinking water.  But we’re expected to believe  China and Russia are the real threat for the world the US intends to defend the "rules-based order"  that Russia and China are posing a challenge to.
US goal is an endless war,  not a successful war' Who got rich of arming Ukraine and the Taliban/ Afghanistan?  Hasn’t the US military-industrial complex quietly made in billions of dollars from arm sales  while the US/EU taxpayers footed the bill?  The US not only paid US soldiers to go over there  but they also paid the Afghan soldiers MORE than US soldiers to fight there?  Total cost was 2.26 trillion dollars  300 million dollars per day  spent on this war for 20 years.  800 billion direct war fighting 269 billion US veterans  85 billion train the Afghan army  5 billion a year per in aid for Afghanistan  750 million for the Afghan soldier payroll   So the US finds that it was cheaper  to pay the Afghan army  then actually send US soldiers there.
Zelenskyy now found out that deadly offensive weapons can save thousands of lives?? Very nice comedy.!!!
We have faith in you Ukraine, you will prevail. Like Zelenskyy said, "you don't need a ride, you need ammo".....!!!!! Keep it comin, USA. 🎯
War is so destructive.  The best, young, strong, smart are always the first to be sacrificed
Putin thanks US for weapons they will have soon.......

He’s right, its up to the people of Ukraine to continued fight and win the war. It’s great that so many countries are coming together to help Ukraine fight the Russian military. I feel that the help will certainly make a big difference, and hopefully Ukraine will take back what the Russian military hold and come out victorious.
Hahaha keep sending arms , cause the Russian have captured tens of millions of donated weapons and destroyed millions more in the Ukrainian supply dumps . Hahaha
Putin will be judged by the things that he does!, God has no patients for fools!
Go get them Ukraine!
That's horrible. Instead of ending the war, they are just supporting it. The US and Zelensky both need to be removed from their positions. They are the definition of doomed.
Finally?  Your heartfelt thanks warms me down to my toes
It’s about  f in time!!!  UNDER THIS WEAK INCOMPETENT COWARD administration SO MANY UKRAINIANS NEEDLESSLY DIED BECAUSE PUTIN WAS ALLOWED BY BIDEN BLINKEN AUSTIN AND THE REST OF THESE USELESS PIECES OF 💩 TO DO SO.  FJBIDEN AND K | |_ |_  Putin
If Russia will destroy your country the thanks should be addressed to Zelensky & US & NATO and all countries supplied weapons to Ukraine for they own destruction where already many places are in ruin, and millions are refugees. ALL the Glory should be given only to GOD not to criminals and sinful people. IT IS EASTER.... CHRIST IS RISEN !! GOD BLESS YOU ALL. !!
Too much talking just give them the darn arms.. n man power with no insignia  Russia did karma a bitch right
HERE THREE GOD'S OUT THERE SPACE COME BACK SHORTLY NEED A HANDLE ON TAKING OUT THY BULLIES INVADING UKRAINIANS THANKS A MILLION! ⏰
The war is almost over! The Russians are fully in control. Why does the West continue to send weapons, they should encourage peace and negotiate terms with the Putin, stop sending weapons! it s going to achieve nothing but kill more Ukrainian people; I believe the West should keep out of it and allow Ukraine Govt to negotiate peace with Russia. I honestly believe soon Russia will expand their operations, and Russia will soon control ports (Black Sea), which I believe have happened, and soon, the Russians will want to take control over the country natural resources. Therefore, Ukarine will be isolated from the rest of the world.
Zelensky will be remembered as the UKRAINE PRESIDENT who destroy his country like GORBACHEV. 😢😢😢
Putin might think it is time to use nuke..shit not gona stop anything. Negotiations is the only way..
Putin needs a military defeat, otherwise he definitely will push onto Odessa to get to Moldova
Russia must respect ukraine as independent country
Destroy the Russia bridge , take back Crimea.
Send more long range heavy artillers UAV attack Drones and air defence system there will really helpful to ukrainian armed force 👌🏼👍💙💛💪🙏🏼
go Russia.
He wouldn't have begged for more and more weapons if he wanted peace. But at the end of the day, we all know who will win the war if things keep going this way. Negotiation is the way out
Zalensky thanks usa for sending that Booga suga 👃 https://youtu.be/_zD2U53ZtOQ
us and nato war criminals getting more Ukrainians killed. Disgusting
God bless ukania family and volunteers
He will keep asking and begging for more.  He is a good actor.
Putin criminal
Will not make a difference🤣🤣🤣
Zelensky is in Washington
Volodor thesneakski is not to be trusted. This guy is full of shit.
Heard that they have more tanks than Russia now... So .. good time for talks...
Fascist Putin has ordered to kill everyone in Mariupol, 'Not a fly should get out'.  Never trust any thing dictator Putin said on T.V.   He said one thing and do another.  Putin is setting up his Generals to be the fall guy.  Is he NOT in control of this war ???  This a game that Putin plays.   Sent more weapons to Odesa for defense against missiles.
Joe slept on this one smh.
Slava #Ukraine great #Cossack nation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOckE6ILUA 🐎 💙💛
No help from Isreal. Coalition government is very close to Putin. Something twisted I  see there as a militiary historian since 1974.
the nukes say they aint wining shit
It should have been done weeks ago.
3 billion plus to fight Ukraine's war while schools have bake sales to fund schools, hundreds of thousands sleep on the streets, our bridges fall apart, and we have mass shootings. Why?
If done earlier no major lost on people… but… NATO need to make Ukraine to be destructed with many life in order to make bad picture Russia… evil 👿
The main problem of the Ukrainian troops today is the lack of shells for artillery. As soon as the occupiers notice the weakening of corrected fire, they immediately try to strike their blows precisely at these sections of the front.
Partners except greed cowards from Germany.
Lol the cope is real.
SLAVA UKRAINI💙💛 🙏
Why can't we give them more advanced weaponry and then the Ukrainians can hire some conveniently available private contractors to do "on the job training", lol ;?)
A month too late.

God bless Ukraine please stay safe xxx
If you don't know what's going on in Palestine ➡️https://youtu.be/CoFjbnvkmQ0
Don't know one Ukrainian but my tax dollar are killing people there. What a terrible place men have made the world. Curse Putin to Hell. What a crazed lunatic in this day and age and then to call all them fellow Catholic Nazi's. Curse him. Pit of Hell for that crazed lunatic.
Stand strong.. Force out the Russian aggressors.. Fight for your independence.. The world is with you and you people..  As for Putin and your cronies..  May you murderous thugs be brought to justice.
look at all of those dislikes, the russian bots are doing a fine job.
All we can do is watch and see what happens... I hope them the best
At this rate Ukraine will be the next European superpower. Another brilliant move by Putin. No wonder Trump admires him so much. 🙄
Russia took them https://youtu.be/JFpF4Kr0Fls At 1:12.47
More Russian soldiers will die coz next month we'll be seeing Ukraine soldiers ambushing Russian soldiers in marupal
Fight on. Death to Putin and Russia. Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦. Glory to the heroes 🇺🇦.
Nonsense.   no us troops along the polish  border Putin would  have shouted louder than you
Slava Ukraini!!  💙💛💙💛💙💛Thank you America!!
GREAT JOB EVERYONE< NOW ZELENSKY CAN GO BACK TO COMMITTING GENOCIDE WITH NATO WEAPONS LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR PAST 8 YEARS WITH POROCHENKO BEFORE HIM!!!!
I support the current thing 🇺🇦💪
fucking retards thinking this is legit
Push the Russian troops out of Ukraine
In his very own pit of destruction Putin shall fall. In Jesus name amen and amen! 🙏
GO UKRAINE!!!
END CLOWN ZELENSKY, END THE WAR, simples really....
Imagine being a Ukrainian! Those people are suffering. We need to stand with them, and assist them against Putin the evil one!
Well earned and responsible , better than handing our best to the Talaband.
Do you know the amount of coverage of this special operation by Russia has been covered MORE THAN all the conflicts combined over the last 30 years! But yet they never show any live action nor do we hear anything regarding the loss to the Ukrainian military. I know why, do you?
I have to say it was very smart on Putin’s part for attacking after the US president let office and the kid sniffing dementia patient took office. A president that takes action versus a stuttering loud speaking old fart that can’t even open his eyes. Great military strategy comrade
Z
Wait! In couple of days he's going to say it's not enough need more. Greedy and ungrateful.
SoState A. Blinken!
you just keep this WAR on GOING why Zelenskij dint follow MINSK AGREEMENT? why ? why He asking for weapons that war ll bring only more DEATHS stupid people dont understand that or what? fight agaist Russia Ukrane do not have army only Batalions... WERE IS AMERICA THERE IS A WAR FACT, CHeck the history 2014 Americans helped to do revolution in UKRANE theres no russians that time.. US f..ked up Cuntries..

Great news... WW3 will prevail in the war: "Fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity ... The *survivors will find themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead."* Death will win with Russia in 2nd.
Thank you for helping Ukraine 🙏
Không tấn công thẳng vào nước Nga thì thằng Nga sê không quay đầu đâu
can somebody tell me WHY ultra-nationalist AZOV fighters not letting civilians leave Mariupol steel plant they are keeping them as shields?
Partners?!! Haha, we are your king, America will never hold you a partner. Haha, everything you have is because of us and our U.N. subordinates. You're welcome
It’s helping they show down 15 aircraft I’m sure the majority was drones but regardless they hitting helos n jets to

Your welcome happy late earth day. We are figuring out who’s who and what’s what. I have a request arrest and detain the Chechnya guy he has made threats for the future of that area. He is no good!!!
You're welcome douchebag.   Stay hiding.    Such a brave man.  I'm sure you'll ask for more free 💩 soon
Tomorrow, 24 April 2022, Eastern Christianity will celebrate Easter. Putin, a Christian, has been murdering children, women, and men since 24 February. Hypocrite! Only God can stop this joyless, evil little Hitler. Sadly there is no God. 💕 ☮ 🌎 🌌
‘With these weapons we will save thousands’ anyone els on bored with giving away billions to a nation with a a neo nazi platoon?
Zelensky the nationalist clown
Very good.  Very very good.... This Was on critical time.....
Just another US war. Ukraine is their victim.
Oh god, Kirby is so mealymouthed.
Wow the burden must have been so hard on begging the world for modern weapons and "finally" receiving them, so glad my tax dollars go to people who don't even appreciate aid.
🐂 poop 💩💩💩💩

Go, Putin, go! Kick those Nazi assholes out of Ukraine, and keep freeing those human sex slaves!  Kick Nato off your borders! Uphold the treaties signed and sealed!
great, cuz ww3 is fucking sanity right u dumbshit leftist morons
OK, so Russian soldiers said they have NO CLUE that Putin put them up to kill Ukrainians... Now it's starting to seem like a big fat lie! Why are there still sooo many new dead innocent bodies on the ground? Can the Russian soldiers explain that? 🤦🏽
No one cares about Ukraine and Zelensky is stupid comedian
You can always trust the Americans to do the right thing… after they have tried everything else! Winston Churchill
We should have provided food and aid and no weapons stop the blood shed
NATO (north atlantic terrorist organizations,  who killed .5M innocent people in Iraq )  provoked this war now they prolonging the war. Ukraine is just a tool for USA to confront Russia. how dump, stupid Ukraine belive they can fight with Russia ??? if Russia want and become so aggressive like USA (in Iraq) it will not take more than 6 hours to complete wipe out Ukraine. thanks God chaina support Russia.

it's just so damn sad, that a lot of people died already, especially civilians...the way the Russians killed innocent people, they deserved to be stop, much earlier...
Every country in the region should all come together and hit Russia with an overpowering offense pushing deep into Russia until the Russian people disappear Vladimir Putin in the most extreme prejudice ever.
By the way, the motto of the Soviet Army is translated: With us the maniacal rage, after us the deluge!....so you know what you will get when they appear. It was like that in 1945 and still is. Klingons, but without honor!!!
WW3 began with a virus attack on mankind.
Support Legislation in NJ S1551 and NY A8546 to BAN COURT ORDERED RAPE.
Yep, enough weapons to prolong the death of Ukraine. Way to go Brandon!
Oh Russian tanks with "Z"ero function...
What???  Questioned if Ukrainia could win?  You do not understand the will to be free?
PUTIN does not want Ukraine , he is taking the ports ,leveling land , creating space between russia and united states of ukraine  and the global dictators of america and england bankers.
I can't believe it took so long.  Gosh, we should all have such...uh...friends.
Took you long enough, wait till they are practically demolished.  Demo are looking for votes in November, who are you kidding Demo.
Propaganda supporting Azov Nazis
Biden ordered the fascist Zelensky to stage a provocation using chemical, bacteriological and nuclear weapons in order to blame the Russian army for this. To do this, the United States has already delivered all the necessary substances to Ukraine. Ukraine and the whole of Europe will suffer from this. But your host Biden doesn't feel sorry for you.
John mark dougan..utube.....the truth
Screw Ukraine, screw the SBU, screw Azov and screw those neonazi too.
INFOS RU Depuis sept semaines, quelques 54. 000 ukrainiens sionistes ont débarqué dans le sud d'Israël à quoi il faut ajouter quelques 10. 000 oligarques russes qui eux aussi, surfant sur la vague créé par les sanctions ont claqué la porte au "régime de zelensky" pour venir porter leur tribu à l'occupation de la bande de gaza et de la Palestine. Les États-Unis ont probablement cédé environ un tiers de leur stock de missiles Javelin à l’Ukraine. Ainsi, les États-Unis approchent du point où ils doivent réduire la livraison de ce missile pour maintenir des stocks de réserves suffisantes pour leurs propres plans de negres et de guerres d’autant plus que la production de nouveaux missiles est lente et il faudra des années pour reconstituer les stocks »,  La Russie a rendu publics les faits qui ont été révélés à ce jour à l'ONU et à d'autres organisations internationales et a appelé les autorités américaines à fournir des explications détaillées, mais, comme on pouvait s'y attendre, Washington ne semble pas prêt à partager avec le public toute information significative sur son programme biologique militaire en Ukraine. En outre, il est clair que la Maison Blanche pense que l'offensive est la meilleure défense et a lancé une nouvelle campagne de propagande centrée sur la fausse affirmation selon laquelle les efforts de notre pays pour attirer l'attention de la communauté internationale sur les activités des biologistes militaires américains en Ukraine ne seraient rien plus qu'un écran de fumée, que, disent-ils, Moscou tentera d'utiliser pour dissimuler l'utilisation potentielle d'armes biologiques ou chimiques lors de l'opération militaire spéciale menée par les forces armées russes.Cette tentative grossière des États-Unis de détourner l'attention du public de cette question dangereusement explosive des laboratoires biologiques contrôlés par les États-Unis en Ukraine et de la noyer dans cette "sensation apocalyptique" a été - à première vue attendue - et fortement evidente.
1:16 that's not completely true John Kirby...come on
To little to late! No thanks to Biden and NATO.....
There is only one solution for the Russians, it is to hydrogen bomb Ukraine so that only dust remains
A waste of money. Russian won't stop until every building is down.
Pay us back you freeloader Zalensky.
The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation possesses the information related to the preparation of provocations by the United States of America in order to accuse the Russian Armed Forces of using chemical, biological or tactical nuclear weapons. This plan has already been developed and represents a response to the success of Russia in conducting the special military operation.
Why are ppl acctually happy about zelloutlinsky being able to kill even more of the civilians in these areas, why are ppl acting like this civilwar just broke out 2 months ago? Why cant we just accept the votes from 2014 and make these areas independent from Kiev? Why is it so wildly okay with ppl that Ukraine wants these civilians dead instead of free to trade independent of Kiev and their US ties? If we didnt have NATO and EU, we could all trade freely, this is all about money and the US egoism “leaders of the free world”, what free world? We are in EU, and somehow with Russia in our view, we seemed to be more free then now where Ukraine/ Kiev wants a reason for NATO forces to play battleground here. NATO stay out, EU keep rejecting Ukraine till they stop the racist genocide and start taking prober Care of their special need population!! This is insane, only in America it is okay how Ukraine treats it’s ppl!
Big mistake,  instead of fixing our borders and protecting Americans,  we are minding someone else's business
Antony Brinkley. Esta. En privado. En. Esto. Lio
When shi like this happens santions need to start at max and help out when requested
Putin finish them off....  I've had enough of funding nazis of Ukraine.
Zelenskyy is honest.  It is Much too late.   Too many Ukrainians have died.
Ya   send zelensky more drugs of whatever hes on....  more money   send more   more more  at the midnight hour he cried more more more
They expected Ukraine to fall within 36 hours, knew it was coming and did nothing to stop it this administration nearly two months later expects gratitude for doing the least they can do. The inspiration here is the leader that will humble themselves before a band of idiots for the survival their country and people. Glory to Ukraine and to Zelenskyy.
If it didn't took so long to divers the weapons mariapul wouldn't have fallen in Russian hands and the  brave heroic Ukrainian soldiers not  trapped ...leaders have to take well decided decisive decision in hostile situation like this where a agressors is on the loose and stop being members of a  talkshow club      ..it saves lifes
Blinken is a liar, he knows Ukraine cannot win.
So how many more civilians have been killed, women raped and people torture will Biden and his train wreck of an administration have procrastinated on all of this?   But did we expect anything else given the Afghanistan debacle!
It’s finally out in the open. The left in the west are Nazi supporters.
Good, might aswell go all together and bend them all over
This is who Putin is trying to kill and who is hiding in the steel mill and other places around the city of Mariupol.  The soldiers fighting to keep them alive are the Azov Battalion, whom Putin calls Nazis.  No where in the world would this kind of genocide be allowed to continue, but because Putin is so powerful it has the Ukrainians fighting this alone.   https://youtu.be/0xtxEPBMQu8
Can your let me  in..
That's disgusting. They wait until they decide Ukraine might be able to win the war before they send the heavy duty weapons. Look how many lives could have been saved if they had done it sooner. And Mariupol might also be in a better position. Blood on Bi dean's hands.
UKRAINE WAKE UP  send RUSSIA Country a few good Missile Blasts  - - Why does Ukraine not bomb Russia they are at war so Ukraine should fire some missiles at Russia give them some treatment right back at Russia TAKE SOME RUSSIA LAND Enjoy their destruction
https://youtu.be/7jHoL3Vr9zQ, guys check out the gifts of American weaponry to Russian chechen soldiers.
Give them the MiGs!!!  Let's fuck some shit up
Well, heading for an atomic WWIII. Thanks to all supporters....
Corrupted Ukraine and USA government, non-of the citizens have a voice in their country ,
The way it's been looking since NATO was started, US is NATO
LONG LIVE UKRAINE 🇺🇦.                        May their needs rise up from the earth. May they have the strength of ten thousand suns.                                  DEATH TO TYRANTS
*Don't believe the hype.* This is more of our tax dollars down the drain,not spent on helping America but instead given to neo-nazi backed Ukranian forces that are killing their own citizens to get more money and sympathy from around the world.
seeing the streets of Mariupol it looks like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya after the US CARPET bombed the crap out of them
lol 😂
lol 😂
Don't give Trump too much credit. He will just say whatever is convent at the moment, once he became president it was a different story. He was the one who started arming Ukrainians after Obama refused to do it.
Zelensky is not an Ukranian he has American citizenship as well.Well, if Ukrainian troops were fighting for Mariupol for 2 months, it’s not surprising 20000 Ukrainian troops were killed and buried. It’s war. Had they surrendered, they wouldn’t have been killed
PEOPLE ignoreD the fact that Nazis ARE FASCIST AND NOT RATIONAL PEOPLE and they've been committing genocide / ethnic cleansing for 8 long years while Russia patiently attempted diplomacy
When Trump was in the White House Nazi Battalions became part of the Ukranian Army, first heavy armaments arrived from NATO, NATO trained Ukranian soldiers,  Biolabs worked and Donbass was shelled. So Trump prepared Ukraine's disaster similarly to other US presidents. His words now is just for the coming presidential election campaign.
Putin crime.
I’ve been saying that the Ukrainians would win from the beginning. Did no one see how they kicked out the Russian puppet government in in the Maidan, without armaments, in 2014? And the bankruptcy of the Russian armed forces was exposed by investigative journalism years ago.  Why was our intelligence surprised?
Putin pleaded with the Ukrainian solders to surrender in Mariupol but they refused   All knew what the consequences could be but they all refused.Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko "evacuated himself" from Mariupol 6 weeks ago without organizing ANY evacuation for the civilians.
Trump has a lot of nerve. He armed the Kiev junta. "Obama sent blankets, I sent javelins".Trump should remember that there is an agreement sitting on the table that nobody wanted to know about including himself when he was president , it`s called " The Minsk Agreement " !
The worst humanitarian crisis was in Iraq when america invaded, not in ukrain.MSM never talk about the Ukranian shelling of towns and cities in the Donbas region.
Great now we’re closer to nuclear war. And for what another commie country. Biden regime and the lefties do not stand with democracy but y’all fall for the propaganda. Don’t believe me see how fast you get silenced for stating a simple fact that there’s only 2 genders. This is not the America our soldiers have fought and died for. Ukraine is just as bad and corrupt as Russia and the Biden regime this isn’t Américas war.
Please! The people on here with their "I stand with Ukraine" and "My heart is with Ukraine" and your "Glory to Ukraine." Try having your own opinion instead of following the trend to get likes. Lame!
Russian nukes incoming

Applebaum is wrong - we ARE with them, she may not understand the magnitude of the logistics problems in getting those pieces to the front.
Good for UKRAINE 🥳
Send it back in burnt pieces
Zelensky is a nazi thug.
God Bless all those who helped Ukraina. We pray that Putin grants cease fire and safe passage for the Ukraininan trapped in Mariupol or that at least for the love of God gives them food water and medicine is orhodox Easter Mercy. We pray God Allmighty that this war ends soon and that peace follows!
Send in the B2’s. Send them right to Moscow.
St. Michael the Archangel; defend Ukraine and Pres. Zelensky in their battle  with Russia. Be their protection against the wickedness of Putin and snares of the devil. May GOD rebuke them, we humbly pray; and do thou oh Prince of the Heavenly Hosts; by the Power of GOD, cast into Hell, Satan and all other evil spirits; who prowl about the world, seeking the ruin of lives and souls; AMEN !!!!!!!
Ukrainian War Crimes!
It's becoming more than clear that any vote for any republican ever is a vote against democracy
The difference between Republicans and Ukrainians is that Ukrainians defend their Capitol
Russia’s  losses till Apr 23th : 21600 troops, 20 generals death (¼ of total), 177 planes, 154 helicopters,  854 tanks, 403 artillery pieces,  2205 armored personnel carriers,  143 MLRs,  8 boats, 1543 vehicles,  76 fuel tanks, 182 UAV , 69 anti-aircraft warfares, 4 mobile SRBM system, 27 special equipment.!  These were serious losses in this evil war and the losses keep deteriorating!  Such bad news has been hidden using fate news by the fascist Russia government from his people.  Since the whole world is supplying weapons to Ukraine unlimitedly, Ukrainian won this war at last definitely. All Russian soldiers were dead for nothing now !! The Devil Putin army and his employed Wagner soldier animals have been losing control with brain disorder to randomly slaughter humans. Such war criminals shall be killed without a pity to save human lives. God bless Ukrainians.
What does prevail mean in this context lol....They have lost 1/3 of their country already.....
What Devil Putin doing is exactly what Nazi Germany did in World War II. Selfishly intended to stay away from current war would lead to self destruction later.  Those who fear to die and lose benefits from Russia would love to tell you to surrender.  History would be repeated. Wake up NATO.  Obviously Ukraine falls, then NATO falls!!!
F$ck Ukraine! The people in America did not vote for this $hit! Blinkin is an unknown little beeeaaach who is spending Americans Tax money. Putin warned everyone and now your feeling the bulls horns.
The US invaded Afghanistan - why can't they help UKRAINE?
Beggars be begging.
If Zelensky spent more time running his country instead of all these TV interviews, he'd probably be able to stop blaming the U.S for there own war!!! I say the next time they complain about the aid, we send one final aid that's simple a note that says "far-well learn to be grateful". We could happily use OUR MONEY ON OUR OWN PEOPLE AND COUNTRY
🙏🙏🙏God will help protect bless Ukraine (🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦) safe from the 👹👺👹& finish the dirty & bloody war from Russia 🇷🇺 crazy President Vladimir Putin 🙏🙏🙏
Just Neo Nazi Propaganda!
They not winning at all. Russia just lost some old milirary equipment .  Ukr lost whole cities. Only thing they won is western news media.
I wonder who he works for?
Fuck you if you agree with or encourage these pathological activities or actions!!
Viva La Ukraine  🇺🇦♥
Great to see all the people backing the Ukrainian effort, to all trump supporters who think the same , you people are f#cking hypocritical a#sholes  by supporting someone who calls putin a genius.
I salute each and everyone who is fighting on the is front line,may God be with you and your loves ones at this HARDEST TRYING TIME. UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
We're sending them more 133mm ammo than the barles can even handle. Our so called leaders are trying to bankrupt our country it seems. That's one of a million examples.
Ukraine is having shityy verry poor brain leader... You are dog of nato/us..!! You only gets death and destruction..! It is you started then there will be no turning back...! End the end, you got nothing but destruction... A playing chezzboard of nato/us...! Be freind with your bloody neighboor rather than be a dog of far away continent..!! Really..!!  But because war  already started.. you ukraine must finish it until end..!  My comment opinion.. you have verryy veryyy veryy poor leader..!! Coconut brain leader..
Russia fighting all of nato on there solo. Some real John wick ish if u ask me
BS!  Heavy weapons were always going to be sent, when the military battlefield demanded it, and when it fit the political battlefield.
Embarrassing Disgusting Fecal matter for you
Pootin is sick so no matter what, Ukraine will win. Once gone his regime will fall apart. Until then kick his ass. VICTORY 💙💛✌✌
Thankyou America for ALL your Support for your support
“Guns to defend themselves “ Sounds like our precious 2nd Amendment. I pray everyday that President Zelensky and his people find the strength and strategies to hold and keep grinding the Russian invaders. The US is doing what it can with what it has ( as President). If Trump were in charge neither this or Afghanistan would had happened 😞.
❤️🙏💪🛡️
i loved hearing, "An independent sovereign Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin."
Good! Give them more!
SENDING PRAYERS TO ALL THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE.  WE ALL STAND BEHIND YOU ALL.  DO NOT TRUST PUTIN OR HIS MILITARY.
TELL US AGAIN HOW ZELENSKI ORDERED THE INVASION OF CRIMEA A FEW YEARS BACK.AND HOW LOCAL RUSSIANS NOT RUSSIAN PERSONNEL BUT LOCALS HAD TO DISARM THE UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS BEFORE THEY COULD PROCEED. FIRING PINS ANYONE!!!
Well if you didn't need the other stuff we don't need to keep helping
Another blood bath like Afghanistan $9 billion a month. Get out of one war and jump into another never ending with our country USA always involved. Just keep printing more money over and over and over. Hopefully we don’t have to wait for reelection and we can impeach our government.
giving these figures more weapons is horrible for the world
elenskyy is a monster
It would have been cheaper and more successful to drill our own oil. At this rate we are giving Ukraine a few weapons and Russia billions. The math doesn’t add up. Quit following the children, they are confused.
They have more weapons this will kill many many more of his people when you give someone weapons don’t know how to use them they will kill their own people corruption Will never win they all will fall
How will they get all those heavy armord east after Russia destroyed majority of fuel stations between east and West? I think Ukrainians will have issues with logistics to transfer heavy equipment east.

UA was ranked 6th in Europe (only after UK, France, Italy, Germany and Spain, in that order) according to Global Firepower and 11th arms exporter in the World (thus strong military-industrial complex) according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. UA ground forces had cca3000 MBTs, cca2500 IFVs, another cca3500 armoured vehicles. Artillery included 500+ MLRSs, 1200+ selfpropelled artillery and 2200+ towed artillery. Air defence was organized in 4 air defence missile brigades and 7 (11 according to some sources) independent air defence missile regiments with 250 S-300PT/PS/V1 SAMs, 72 9K37 Buk SAMs, 100 9K330 Tor SAMs, 125 9K33 OSA-AKM SAMs, 150+ 9K35 Strela-10 SAMs, 70 2K22 Tunguska SPAAGMs, 300+ ZSU-23-4 Shilka SPAAGs and hundreds of S-2/S-3 Strela, Igla, Piorun and Stinger MANPADS.

Hey Putin... F.U.
Zelenskyy, the world is willing to help you with this Russian aggression but understand that the status quo in Ukraine must change forever. Corruption and graft need to be rooted out and destroyed if you hope to provide the necessary defense for your own country going forward. If you do not, Ukraine will remain weak and dependent.
Bomb the heck out of the gremlin and the Kremlin.  Do it now!
Weapons is not enough. Two days ago Zelensky requested $7 bln each month from the West for his 'defending of democracy'. But the fact is that Zelensky banned all opposition parties & TV channels, many people in Ukraine are publicly abused 'for treason' & some were executed by SBU security service without trial even in the center of Kyiv
puta won't stop  , puta MUST BE STOPPED............amen
We are going to be in a world war thanks to this selfish President of Ukraine. Look at all of the Ukrainian people that have died because of this selfish president with his foolish pride.  And now he want America to suffer the consequences of war. What do Americans get out of this war? Nothing but, Death.. we got nothing out of the Vietnam war! We got nothing out of the Iraq war. We got nothing out of the Afghan war.  We lost billions of dollars, many American lives. All those resources could have been used in America. All America got was a bunch of refugees that want to overthrow America..
Now the troops to use the equipment
So sick of zelenski and Biden
Jeez-us... Stop arming, funding and fomenting the war. We all are NOT getting rich off of it. And, lots are dying. And, we have NO business there.
Daily prayers for Ukraine, especially for Mariupol, President Zelensky, his family and Administration.   Please continue to stay strong and well...All things will pass, including nightmares.
John Kirby (DEMOCRAT) says "We are giving Ukraine the weapons they need to push Russians out of their place of origin". Imagine if he would have said "We are giving Ukraine weapons to push Africans/Muslims out of the country they illegally immigrated to".
Never believe  usa democrats woke wako freaks and everything they touch goes to shit and the European union with van Der layan that evil demon
Please send effective aid to Ukraine ASAP to enable them to defeat the Russian aggression.  Too many innocent lives has already lost already because of this senseless war.  Also it's so costly to the world regarding several other aspects if this brutal war lingers much longer.
Cant put a bunch of stuff in there if Russia is gonna capture it.  We didnt know how this was gonna work out.  Cant do it all at once anyway.
Why is Joe Biden letting Ukraine pull America into a war????? They are not part of NATO! America makes rules and then they don't follow them.... Joe Biden you are a one-term president...
Yes, FINALLY❗️ Took US long enough to 💩 or get off the pot!  🇺🇸🇺🇦☦️
Blinken and Kirby must be as high as Elenskyy.
When will America start taking care of Americans?!?!?!
This guy's a clown. Zelensky is worth $596 million, why can't he use some of that dirty money to help his country? He rather beg on his knees
https://youtu.be/x5Uf7aooxvE

Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦 ♥️  God bless USA 🇺🇸
11YEARS FORCED AMERICAN PUBLIC PRISONSCHOOL SYSTEM TAUGHT ME FALSE INFO-- NOW IM PIST!! 11YRS WASTED! FORCED! to CONVINCE MEEE to BELIEV U.S.'s involvement was justified. BoyOBoy, STUDYING STUDYING STUDYING
He sounds a little ungrateful. No one is required to do anything to help.
i been studying TRUTH ABT WW1.  SOON I'LL KNOWWWW "WHO'S" FULL OF CHIT-- SO FAR its been my OWN GOVT.
Go Russia
Kick the invasors a** out of Ukraine land including Dombas and Crimea. God bless Selensky and the military forces.!!!!!
Ukrainian are brave but was it worth the prize join nato
In the next 2 weeks we'll see how good the robbing Chechens are  Gory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
Now go Offensive starting with Belarus next to you and CLAIM your Victory over it.
The EU are also sending  arms to Russia.🤦😅🥴
This is Russian Terrorism. This is the democracy of fascist empirical terrorist state known as Russia.
I will not fight there fight
Its still to little and to late. All they absoutely NEEDED more during the build up was the full lethal supply set they were being sent and they could have stopped Russia from setting up camp within the first week, saving tens of thousands of soldiers and only God knows how many civilians now alongside billions in armenant
Ukrainians are out of this world.
Hopefully its not to late
If he was a true American he would know that Ukrainian will win. As an American we are raised knowing that a patriotic civilian population can destroy any standing army.    When we the people stand together with arms our land can never be taken and Ukrainians have the same fight we are raised with. And they will never lay down their Arms till all the invaders are gone🤘🏼  That guy at the podium is how not to raise your kids.
Nazi deep state Ukraine fucks !
More weapons are being,sent.   Hopefully soon Ukraine switches to the F-16 or F-15 and American smart weapons, being limited to Russian equipment is not a good idea
GM PRAISE GOD.

God bless Russia a d The Ukraine Civilians Who Are Fighting The Corrupt Ukrainian Government.   Kick NATO Out your Country For good 👍😊
You might as well give the Ukrainian ,everything they need since the West don’t have no balls’ to fight the Russians.
Ukraine will win, God Bless them!
Is this the same Anne Applebaum that recently dismissed the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop as not of any interest? Her opinion's worth a lot then, is it?
There is no winner in war situation, both side got damages  that's the bad of war. But Russian in mouth bluffing has been silence that's proof to zero by Ukraine sanctions is an undesirable evil bring down everything to zero Pres Putin makes a lifetime mistake to fight Ukraine. That destruction was not worth the effort.
What a load of BS
He can thank us when he pays it back. ☝🏻🤓🇺🇸👍🏻
Ukraine in the membrane. Support Ukraine with your washed brain
Now it’s time for the Ukrainian military to take a giant dump 💩 on Russia.
More help coming too 🤫
Stay strong Ukrainian. Don’t let the crazy man destroy everything your country had.
So bullets and missiles for Ukraine and its civilians. Nobody sees the irony in this. Does “proxy war” mean nothing to anybody. We provide the weapons for war and they provide the bodies. Of course Ukraine has no problem paying off its debts to financial blocs the last few months.
Begging Gremlin Zelinskyy. More more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
buy your own defenses.  i hear burisma has some aid to give
Russia thanks the West for  the future trophies!
Fuck usa Politics
Man, if they are listening  to Blinken they are pretty much doomed.
Comments are flooded with first name last name bot accounts. Fake
LORD JESUS IS PURE LOVE. MAY YOU GO BACK TO HIM. PRAY AND REPENT HEARTILY TO HIM. THE LORD IS WAITING FOR YOU ❤  MAY GOD BLESS US ALL  ❤

Russia needs to do something because Joe Biden is bleeding Americans dry to fund this war...hurry up and take it or quit putin
This is about imagd otherwise they are poor.
great USA help
Provide the same to PALESTINE
Fuck nato for arming these scum. Nazi bastards.
Blinking is delusional.
Now they will use new weapons in Ukraine to use and test I guess they used a lot of weapons in Afghanistan and tested them pretty well. God help end the war all over the world and Punish those who are behind the war. LoL hope that helps WAR is Money for some countries I won’t mention!!!! you all guess??????………. I am Afghan and we had war for 20 years. Taliban was fighting US and NATO and Talibans in control after 20 years so what  happened to all the  weapons that was used in this country to get rid of Taliban. how come Taliban took over the country. it seems Afghan government and US and NATO  Lost the war or they just left it and walked away.
Glory to ukraine take the terrorist war criminial out youre land
Kiev does not have too much longer. Ukraine is not that innocent in this conflict. Zelensky is a comedian in chief. All Kiev’s atrocities will come to light soon enough. I guess selling your country to the West is beneficial for a short time. Ukraine is going to Yugoslavia’s history.
praying for World peace, & end of the war
Supply them more heavy weapons and jet fighters for heavy support and to target Russian logistics and artillery.
Châu chấu, những dòng sông nước chảy như máu, bệnh dịch, hạn han, lủ lụt, các điềm lạ, động đất.. là báo hiệu tận thế  Phản Kito là ĐGH  Sắp tận thế lúc 15 giờ
I would like my shipments of javelins, stingers, lmgs, drones and armored vehicles as well... I am interested in keeping an invading army back. . .😇
Why is America working with these racist!!!!
Gotta stop the madd man
Just asking , what in Ukraine would be worse if it is part of Russia  ? Seems Ukraine has always been extremely poor and very corrupt with many young women offering to marry men in America . Isn't Zelensky worth $ 596.000.000  as stated by Forbes  in 2022 . Who do you think would be likely to lose the most by a Russian takeover , the people of Ukraine or Zelensky ?
🌻🇺🇦🇺🇲🌻
Slow.......
SS Azov Nazi zelenskyy wants all Ukraine to die. More guns more killing. More killing more destruction.
STOP GIVING UKRAINE WEAPONS.
Too late . Way too late !
Press loves playing dress up and playing war
SAVE Mariupol! RISE UP!
Weapons will be used to destroy more the Ukraine and to kill civilians
If Ukraine doesn't win after getting these weapons, a lot of people will be pissed. I strongly believe Ukraine will be in Ukrainians control and putin will die a pussy getting f.cked in hell by devil's.
About time he thanked someone he has done nothing but moan that he isn't getting enough help may every bullet or missile his a russian target
#putinMUSTpay
I hope Russia and china wins this war . i wish Ukrainians become like Palestinians
I hope the Russians do a good job fertilizing the fields with their corpses. The whole thing is disgusting but I can't say surprising.
American weapons killing russias army!  🇺🇸 we don’t even have to do the work.
He really wanted those planes!
Cool the highest inflation for Americans in forty years but hey let's send weapons to another country that wouldn't piss on us if we were on fire and celebrate nasis. Amazing how the the coof vanished about the time the Russians invaded.
Corruption feeding corruption. Down with the NWO! Down with NATO!
"Finally"?   Bitch, you are not my child -- learn how to appreciate whatever you can't seem to get to yourself.  And never forget it's because of your government corruption why your NATO application was not approved.
Debesu Augstāko Debesu Tēvs, lūdzu, piedod man visus manus grēkus.  Radi manī jaunu sirdi, jaunu radīšanu, jaunu dzimšanu.  Lūdzu, paliec manā sirdī, ieraksti savus likumus un gribu manā sirdī.  Palīdzi man iet tavus svētuma un taisnības ceļus.  (Ej un iegremdējies ūdens dīķī un pazemīgi pasludini tos Kungam Dievam Jēzum, un Kungs Jēzus tev sūtīs dāvanu, Svēto Garu) Svētais Gars tevi mācīs, vadīs pa Kunga Jēzus ceļiem.  Lai slavēts Kungs Dievs Jēzus.
The evil canival club
About time...they should have had this in February when the Orcs we're stacking up at the border. 🇺🇲🇺🇦
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
No sanctions should ever be lifted until ever square inch of Ukraine is returned. Putin or no Putin.
❗"The United States is preparing provocations to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine" - Igor Kirillov, head of the RCBZ troops of the Russian Armed Forces "The Russian Ministry of Defense has information that the United States is preparing provocations to accuse the Russian armed forces of using chemical, biological or tactical nuclear weapons."
thanks for the united states
This is getting right up there with the fake moon landings.
It's disgusting that TILL NOW they're getting the proper stuff to fend off against the invaders. How many dead soldiers and people did it take to finally realize the invaders are systematicly removing Ukrainian identification?
What that heck is happening to all the weapons ever week Ukraine is begging for weapons, makes me think they auction them soon as they get them, they say their trap by Russia, we need another 600 million dollar package.
Slava Ukraina!
Salvages killing each other fine with me.
1st weapons for defense 2nd weapons for offense 3rd defense offense.
From vietnam, my greatest respect for Ukrainian heroes because of your bravery.Thank you heroes.🧒🧒👦👦👦👦👦👦
I beg the world to do more with this barbaric fascist Putin. Stop doing business with fascist Russia Putin now. supplying more and more weapons to Ukraine⏩⏩⏩🙏🙏🙏🙏
Yea,  let’s send help and arms a “day late and a dollar short”, after the country already has been devastated ????  This should have been done as soon as Russia stepped over the boarder !!!
Brainwashed into thinking that this war is actually helping you 😂… they will not stop Putin, because he’s a white man. He’s not broke, he never will be… You guys are really slow for thinking that this war is helping you 😂
More air defence systems to shoot down Russian fighter jets. More long-range artillery and missiles to wipe out Russian artillery sites. Don't worry about Putin's complaints about supplying weapons to Ukraine. Why do you like to listen to PUTIN while PUTIN never wants to listen to anyone? He can't use nuclear weapons as Biden is so scared of. He enjoys currently the best life with his young beautiful wife and billion $$ assets and why does he want to have a risk losing a wonderful life due to a nuclear war as he can live around 10~20 years only? (The Russian male life span is only 73. He is 69. He is highly like to die within 4 years naturally)
Another 800 million dollars coming next week
Let’s give them the shirt off our backs as our own people go without. That’s called being a hypocrite. I’m sure they’ll help us by protecting the Bidens and the secret Covid Labs. I think they’ll be better under Russian rule. Ukraine should surrender already and save the US tax payers money.
How about we load up the fleet of B2s with 80X 500 pound smartbombs back them up with F35 & F22s and let them make  1 run then send in the A10 & AC130's to mopup the scumbags. The Ukrainians can collect the survivors as they scurry like rats for cover and try to make it back home.
Russia will kill yu if yu mess with it , they are not fighting with the civilians of Ukraine but Ukraine army make civilian shield to get surport from the world  saying the Russian are killing innocent civilians.
80 billion dollars better do something
when liars  lie, and  when liars  arm  nazi  death squads,  who  rape  and right  graffiti  in blood on the Dead  woman's body  is  ignored  by  western media  then  WESTERN MEDIA  IS   TO   THE  BITCH  SLAVE  TO THE USA.   CIA  RMS THE  NAZIS =  GAME OVER  FOR  USA  GLOBAL HEGEMONY..  LAY  WITH  NAZI=  GET  FINISHED  BY  CHECHENS
Defend Ukraine  Defend All of our Freedom 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤️
MOŽDA VLADIMIR NE POMAŽE RUSIJI, MOŽDA POMAŽE SVOM STRAHU.
Thanks for putting more fuel on this war, more life to be lost
Zelensky war room got the memo that the White House's press is looking Jnky
So.. about Putin.. and about these soldiers who performed these atrocities... And about the damn politicians who sat on their asses and did not hear Zelensky clearly the many times before these thousands of innocent civilians were murdered.  The reality reality is that nothing now can make up for what has been done, although there need to start being very big and serious discussions about how to make things as right as possible and do everything possible to prevent this from happening again.
Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukraine) is the future of Humanity, Putin (Russia) is the horrible past that we want to leave behind.
This will cause Putin to use nuclear weapons! Stop poking the bear!
It's disgusting that it is only now that these weapons are given! Why so late? Support Ukraine 🇺🇦 support freedom
🇺🇦 Commanders: 🐧utin's General  is in        Crimea ....look for a communication s         tower...
Let us pray the weapons make safely to the region and Putin is able to capture and use those weapons.  God Bless Putin.
They're are bringing more weapons for your burial whylist their arm manufacturing company are making money 🤑🤑
I think those Mig-29's Poland has been trying to give Ukraine finally happened. Poland couldn't just give them as they were fully converted to be used by NATO BLOCK and avionics/comms would not be compatible with what Ukraines pilots can use, basically they had to be converted/retooled so that very little training will be needed by Ukraines pilots. Originally the plan was quashed but I think they finally did it. Other Nato members with Russian planes also pitched it for sure too, as long as replacement planes of equal capabilities were given as replacements.
Please provide more weapons n other needful things to Ukraine  .this is the high time to help fully to  democracy country like Ukraine ,to fight back n achieve their land back ,god bless
How do we call Vladimir Putin a stupid man or a crazy man? He needs to learn a lesson.
The timing is interesting.  The Azov brigade is about to be wiped out in Mariupol. Given that batallion's ties io far-right ideology, I'm sure many Western leaders and even Ukranian democrats are not entirely upset that Azov is effectively eliminated.  It solves a problem for them.  Any postwar Ukranian government will have to be democratic and far right elements would not be welcome.
The Ukraine needs to give US citizens mineral and land rights to pay for all the money and equipment they receive. The USA isn't a free tit to suck dry.
Hahaha, Ukraine will prevail. Zelensky can keep making videos, bopping his head up and down, left and right, and round and round all he wants, and the west can give him all the weapons in the world, but in the end, he is gonna have to sit with the man, Putin, and do as he is told. Something he could have done before a single shot was fired to save Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. History will never forgive that little narcissistic, self-centered, clown, Nether should the Ukrainian people.
Thanks, thanks a million times for helping ucrania with what they need.Bless the people of ucrania 🇺🇦🙏
Well done 👍🏽 all countries involved supporting Ukraine 🇺🇦 I hope we can all keep supporting Ukraine 🇺🇦 for as long as needed slava Ukraine 💙💛💙🌻💙🌟💙🌼✊🏽👍🏽👏🏽💪🏽🙌🏽🇦🇺
Your prayers have power. 💙💛🙏🙏🙏
I'm happy watching this , america, france, and european countries walk the talk ....but german is afraid
What a fake war , fuck I laugh 😂
Lennin historically criticised western imperialism and spoke of workers rights and now the Russians are conducting a violent imperialistic land grab in Ukraine. Power to Ukrainian people for standing up to the evil aggressor..
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
We need to send them long range rockets 🚀  Loads of them and more radar systems to shot long range bombers out the sky and there rockets
that Kirby looks like a real honest guy ..
You wouldnt think the US would have many weapons left after Biden gave them all to the Taliban for free
KICK THEIR BOLSHEVIK TEETH OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS
How🤷🏾‍♂️
US should stay out of it.  Still wondering what the real deal is.  There’s been other countries in the same position as the Ukraine and the US didn’t provide manpower, money or assistance.  So what’s the US and Nato getting out of the deal?
Putin ✌️
GO ON SELENSKY, GO ON UKRAINE.
Thousands dead..win?? Pfftttt more will die. RIP to those who have lost their lives and those thousands to come. May peace come soon.
Well thank goodness they finally got some weapons to defend themselves. It's just sickening that president Joe Biden and his administration waited to the very last minute. So many lives could have been saved. If he had gone out of his basement Wash his bloody little hands and put down his sippy cup. He should have done this 6 weeks ago. We would not and the world would not and the Ukrainians would not be in the situation now.
GLORY TO UKRAINE!!! Love from Canada!
God bless Okraine.🇺🇦💪🇧🇷🙏😔
More, more, more heavy weapons!
I'm just hoping they're not too late with these weapons saving the whole Ukraine
Have read that until recently Germany and France also selling weapons to Russia. Well done. Money is GOD.
SLAVA UKRAINE GLORY WILL BE TO UKRAINE FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM
Yes finally ! Thanks for helping Ukraine ! Prayers are always with them !
What kind of evil person asks you for your last weapon? Zelensky that's who. And what kind of selfless idiot does so??? We are about to find out.
Pres. Putin's(or modern-day Emperor) paranoia or imagined threat is getting wider.   Finland(and Sweden) are considering joining NATO also.   They are "pushed" by the recent invasion of Ukraine.   If Putin can do this to his "brothers & sisters"(as what he thinks) in Ukraine,  the more he can do it elsewhere.   So,  Finland is getting swarmed by Russian troops in her border lately.   If we are going to follow the pattern,  it's worrisome to be a neighbor of Russia.   You are immediately perceived as an enemy once you show intention of joining NATO.   So,  Finland,  Norway,  Estonia,   Latvia,  Georgia,  Azerbaijan, etc. are all in danger of being invaded once they copy what Ukrainians did.   This is serious.   Pres. Putin is entertaining an "empty threat" in his mind.
ukrena became a victim of the ambitions of nato and USA policies, only the destruction and suffering experienced by the ukrean people where the president was jokingly sacrificing his people
glory to Ukraine 🙌 💙 💛  Ukrain can win this battle... just give them all they need to fight the evils... you helped them already at first  then help the Ukrainians until the end...thanks to America in supporting the  Ukraine... glory to Ukraine 🙌 💙 💛  glory to America
Now you gotta smoke em like hell
Jets and tanks.not only beat back but use the jets to attack Russian spots that are not too far from the border,give them a taste of death and suffering
The greatest thing I can do right now is to share my best friend's story with you.   Family Story Little did our family of six know that Friday evening, September 24th, 2021, would be the last night our family would be complete. We laughed together, played games, sang, and enjoyed listening as our 16-year-old son, Ethan, played the piano for us. I packed a lunch for Ethan for a church mountain hike he was going on the following day.  My mother (who was visiting from out of state) and I woke early with Ethan on Saturday morning.  He hugged me and smiled, never pulling away or rushing me. He got in the car, waved, said he'd see me later and he loved me. It was hard to watch my "new driver" heading out on his own that morning.  As Ethan pulled out of the gate, I turned to my mother and said, "It's just so hard letting go." Little did I know how much "letting go" I was really doing. That was the last time I saw Ethan. He did not make it home that evening.          That afternoon, a friend tried to contact my husband, leaving an urgent message to call him back.  He tried several times to return the call to no avail. As we were preparing supper, an overwhelming feeling of deep concern for Ethan filled my heart. I quietly blinked back tears. I glanced out the window, half expecting to see a police officer pull up to the house, but no one arrived.  However, within a few minutes, a patrol car DID pull into the driveway.  In my heart, I feared the worst. My husband and I went out to meet the officer, who confirmed our fears.  Hesitantly, he told us our son had fallen off of  a bluff and had succumbed to his injuries.  Our hearts were crushed; they still are.          Yet, in all of our brokenness, deep, continual grief and loneliness, our family has such a blessed Hope and assurance that we will see our dear son and brother again. You see, when Ethan was a young boy, he was saved; he put his faith in Jesus alone to forgive his sins and to take him to Heaven when he died.  He realized some very important truths from the Bible that he would want to share with you.  His Story      Everyone is a sinner.  Sin is any violation of God’s Law. God is holy, just and righteous, and He cannot allow sin in His presence.  Ethan realized that he – like all of us – had sinned; and his sin separated Him from God.  “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; ” (Romans 3:23)   “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:” (Romans 5:12)      He understood that, because of his sin, he deserved to spend eternity in Hell.   “For the wages of sin is death;”  (Romans 6:23a)  [Wages: price]  “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” (Revelation 21:8) Ethan believed that Jesus, God’s Son, paid the price for all sin when He died on the cross – because His sinless sacrifice was the only thing that could satisfy the just demands of a righteous, holy God. Jesus was buried in a borrowed tomb, but He arose the third day, triumphant over sin, death, and Hell. Jesus is alive today!        “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”  (John 3:16)  “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9) Ethan was sorry for his sin, repented (turned), and received by faith the free gift that God offered to him.  “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  (Romans 10:13)  “...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23b) Because of this great salvation, Ethan lived his life serving Jesus.  He worked hard to spread this Good News to the world.  He is alive in Heaven with Jesus today; and because of this great HOPE in Christ, we know we will see him again soon – not because he was a great kid, but because of his faith in the great Saviour!        “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.”  (John 10:28)  Your Story What about you?  What if you had fallen to your death that day – What if you were to die today?     Where will you spend eternity – Heaven or the Lake of Fire? There will not be any parties in the Lake of Fire.  It is a place of eternal torment for those who reject God's Son.      The Word of God is very clear that there is only One Way to Heaven.   “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”  (John 14:6)      We did not know that Ethan would step into eternity that day; however, because he put his faith in Jesus alone for his salvation, Ethan was ready to go. Some day – perhaps today – you will take your last breath here on earth, and you will step into eternity. Where you spend eternity is determined by what you do with Jesus Christ. Will you accept Him or reject Him?  You are not promised another day or another breath. Eternity begins soon – Are you ready?  “...Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved…”  (Acts 16:31b)   “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  (Romans 10:13) “(...behold, now is the day of salvation.)”  (2 Corinthians 6:2c) ******************************  Tribute to Ethan Lakey https://youtu.be/EhobcQZ6Qb8
God bless  Ukraine and those who help.🙏❤ Putin must  be expelled
i want to know this guys smoke
💖
Its claimed by western propaganda media that Putin has NO friends. Well his better of then Zelensky with the kind of NATO/West/American friends that will see you being destroyed and watching from the side.
its only become scrap metal..
May the Russia shots miss and may the Ukrainian shots hit their mark.
You still not gonna win the war Zelensky. The Russians will continue to kick your ass.
A message from the President of Russia Vladimir Putin to all the nations of the world: Dear citizens of our wonderful planet Earth! I, the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, decided to address all of you directly, bypassing diplomats, your rulers and journalists. In Russia, there is such a thing as "the time of surrender", where you cannot lie, deceive and play. That's why I'm going to be honest so everyone can check the truth of my words. Russia is a great and rich country. The main value is more than 150 peoples who live on a territory where justice is above all. We don't need new territories. We have plenty of energy and all other resources. Since the time of the Great Tartaria and the Great Mogul, the peoples of northern European have evolved not because of looting in the crusade wars and colonization of America, Africa, India, drug addiction in China, but thanks to their hard work and peacekeeping. Those who know Russian understand that "Russian" is an adjective for all the peoples of our country. Russian Slovenians, Russian Tatars, Russian Jews, Russian Evenkas and so on are Russians in the soul, although their culture, language, lifestyle may differ. We salute this diversity of unity. Once again, the Russian people of Russia are forced to sacrifice their lives, protecting the world from Nazism and fascism. We exchanged 50 of our prisoners of war for 50 Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian soldiers received medical assistance in our hospitals, ate three large meals a day and returned home. We received Russian soldiers with their fingers cut off and reproductive organs. Not even the Nazis did this during the last war. We will present these evidence in a future court. Shame on anyone who supports these scoundrels now. Your rulers in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and other countries have stood on the side of these subhumans, who have put civilians, pregnant women and children in front of them, intentionally harming prisoners of war. It’s hard for me to imagine a healthy, healthy person supporting these monsters. And your Bidens, Scholars, Macron and other dark-fashioned Democrats not only protect criminals, but also actively arm them, supply them with money, which is not enough to keep prices in your countries low. Prices are rising, the world is collapsing, but not because the Russians are cleansing Europe of Nazis evil spirits, but because you don't watch and actually support a new wave of Nazism. This time we are not going to Berlin. We will stand on our historical borders, and all the Nazis evil spirits, to whom your rulers wide open, will arrange a new "crystal" life, as the Nazis did, adding reproductive organs circumcised. I appeal to all who want to live and work in peace, to raise children and to be friends with the nations of the world. Help Russia fight the new cancer - Ukrainian Nazism. Not Ukraine where peaceful and valuable people live, but Nazism, fed by hawks from the USA and NATO for your taxes. If your rulers support Nazism, chase them out three doors, take power into your own hands. Ukrainian Nazis protect themselves from bullets of civilians, their rulers, under the pretext of terrible Russia, also decided to transfer the burden of high prices and upcoming troubles to the population. Both in Ukraine and in you, Nazis live well behind the backs of ordinary citizens, and ordinary people should suffer - these are identical crimes in both Ukraine and the West. If we unite, then in another week there will be no Nazis in Ukraine, normal life will return to Europe, the USA and other countries, and together we will judge Ukrainian Nazis and all the rulers who support Nazism in the new tribunal. Our goal is the right one. We will defeat the nazism. I would like to share this win with everyone together as soon as possible. Our goal is the right one.
Slava Ukrani ✌️ Independent Ukraine. Great to see US support arriving &  Australia is with Ukraine too . We have to kick Putin's ass &  put he dictator/& his cronies on trial for War Crimes! Heroiam Slava Glory to the Heroes ✌️🤘🇦🇺🇺🇦 Hell awaits Putin ☠️
The situation is not optimistic for Ukrainian soldiers. Russian soldiers are in a strategically advantageous position.  In the previous phase, Russian attacked Ukraine's Urban areas. But after liberated Maripol (I said Mariopul is occupied by Russia, bcoz there are no Azov soldiers left to fight, they are run-out of the battlefield and hid in an underground tunnel, even they are not on the ground as brave soldiers) Russian soldiers are in the defensive position and Ukrainian soldiers are in attacking mode if they will get the USA and Western arms and weapons. Moreover, the current phase of the war comes into the flat land of the Donbas area. Therefore Ukraine will face terrible experiences and lose more land to Russia.
🇺🇦🇺🇸🇩🇴🙏❤️
It shoud be rather, NATO or perhaps US appreciate Ukraine providing soldiers to use their weapons.  Those weapons are manufactured, if unused they will degrade and be unusable in time. Unfortunately zelensky has to provide those soldiers for 2 more years, because NATO wants the war to Las that long
Weapons weren’t given to "save thousands of people."  They were given to win this war so other European countries and NATO countries don’t have to fight Russia. I hate how in public leaders talk about the dying children and dying citizens when Zelenskyy just wants to save the country and his name not go down in history as the one who lost the first war that led to ww3.  The rest of the leaders just want what’s best for their own countries. I’ve wondered lately if they’re letting it linger on to wear down PUTIN’S supplies, weapons,  and soldiers so he’ll have less to fight other countries. Also, I disagree with her assessment that leaders now think Ukraine has a chance of winning.
The eatable methane weekly play because skirt particularly bomb athwart a hot huge bar. aberrant, lively neck
It don't matter if they get tanks all the rusian forces ere in donbas  ukrain will have two travel 3 hundred miles two donbas Rusia will pick them of like fish in a barall  they wipe them out be four they even get there
More sanctions are neede to stop Putin's war machine...
Ukraine Prime Minister Shmyhal is a trunnion of stability maintaining composure, calm in a human crisis situation.  Just the facts nearly without emotional display.  Прем’єр-міністр України Шмигаль – це стрижень стабільності, який зберігає спокій, спокій у людській кризовій ситуації. Просто факти майже без емоційного прояву.
What game are some of Ukraine's allies playing?  Give them EVERYTHING they need and then some!
May the Ukrainian Easter bring blessings to all of Ukraine - especially Mariupol and Kharkiv - and the demise of Putin. May the Miraculous Mother of God Kursk Root icon intervene to make this a reality.
the people of Mariupol have started returning back home  civilians have begun a coordinated "clean up"  it's safe for them to do so now that the Russians have control finally relief from being bombed and shelled for the past eight years
Even if  zelnsk is quiet . The west will send weapons and secrets Soldiers .  Honestly , Zel is just a puppet. He opens his mouth when his master tells him to.
I hope we get plenty of bang for the bucks…
Phuk this bs this isn’t the peoples war !! Putin Biden and zelenskyy belong in prison!! Tell zelenskyy to get equipment from Afghanistan, Biden gave them 80b dollars of our hardware get it from them
DEAR G💙D, PR💛TECT & BLESS UKRAINE
I am horrified this is still going on, it literally makes no sense. So many lives lost, so much culture destroyed, so many brave people that no long walk amongst us.  For Christ sake, can’t some just drop a dozen bunker busters on the Kremlin and kill that MF? He was at a parade the other day, just carpet bomb the entire area from 70,000’
why is it our job to give weapons and money Ukraine needs to do this alone we need to stop sticking our dumbass noses into thing and calling Putin evil yet we invaded and held a country just a few years ago over nukes that didn't exist we killed thousands of innocent civilians too yet we have the gall to call another evil we are hypocritical
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Don't like Afghanistan the Taliban takes over the weapons...
Hurry, they need to defend!
I’m a 1/4 Ukrainian & The corrupt US government is pushing the world into WW3 along with our “ allies”!!!  This was a coup d’état started over eight years ago when President Obama was in office, & Biden was vice president!!! This is not about Russia versus Ukraine, this is a much much deeper issue than people realize, & yet they (ignorant people who listen to mass state run media) will virtue signal till the cows come home, & tell you that if you don’t support Ukraine you are a horrible person who deserves to die!!! It’s insane to me how ignorant people are, on top of the fact that they are willing to threaten others whom they know nothing about!!! Let alone knowing the truth behind the situation, and how we got to this place!!!   In case you are not aware, the United States government needs war in order to make money, and justify the budget for the military industrial complex!!! Not to mention and maintain their delusion of being the “leader of the free world”, which is not free!!! I could go on and on and on and on for weeks about how deep this goes, so if you think you know everything, you might wanna continue doing your own research before they censor all information they don’t want you to know! They have already basically declared war on Americans via censorship, not to mention Covid restrictions that have done way more harm than good for the majority of the population!!! That’s by looking at the science and the data!!!! I am well-versed in that subject as well & could also go on & on & on about everything I know about that situation as well, which is all connected to United Nations agenda 21/2030! That agenda that has been official since at least 1992 is all about the total control of every person, place, thing, resource, Drop of water, animal, as well as our food supply etc. etc. etc. etc.!!! Basically control of everything on the entire planet!!! As the world economic forum, as well as the billionaires of “Davos” have already told you, “in the future, you will own nothing, and (supposedly) be happy” about it!!!! These are the people who have planned “the great reset“ that just so happens to coincide with the pandemic, which they call an “opportunity“!!!! this is all while they get richer & richer & richer, & the rest of us get poorer & poorer!!! This is all while they think that they have the right to tell you what to do with your life, because they believe that they are not only elite in terms of money, but they literally believe that they are better than you in every single way!!!! I suggest you all wake up before it’s too late!!!!! 😈😈😈
Criminal versus war mongers.
Great!
god bless you america.god bless you ukrain.god bless you blinken sir.
Invade russia Ukrainian! FOOK PUTIN! FREE THERE PEOPLE ONCE AN FOOKING FOR ALL!!
So, is it now ‘NeoNazi Lives Matter’ ?  They are nasty, nasty racist pukes that YOU support. Does that not make you one also ? Do a spit of research on these mf’ers. Rarely is war for a good cause. This is one. Support it if you wish humans to Evolve and no to Devolve, please.
We are with you Zelensky & all Ukrainians, we love you, pray 4 you daily.  Slava Ukraini
Ukraine should just surrender and save lives. That's all that matters. All of these are needless.  All countries supplying them with weapons are perpetrators of war and are responsible for the loss of lives in the country. Headless leaders in the world right now. Come back MR TRUMP.
i like John he is president material, straight talking and trustworthy
NATO could have solved this war in 1-2 weeks, now it will take 1+ year i think, let's hope the russians are worse than i expect. The cost will be like 10 times higher like this ...  All because being affraid of Putin's (NK threats )!
Ukraine needs to take the fight back to ruzzia ! give them a taste of their own medicie.
Viva Ucrania 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
Why Biden?? We might as well have just attacked Russia. At least we'd have the element of surprise instead of him. Our chance of Nuclear war being a probability is pretty much a given now thanks. See you guys in Hell
Never give Putin an inch from Donbass to Odessa. Making such mistake will cripple Ukraine's economy making you landlocked.
It’s an insult to NATO & the US if putin wins his unprovoked war. Slava Ukraini!
🇺🇦❤️🇺🇸💪👍
🇺🇦❤️🇺🇸💪👍
May God bless the countries that helped Ukraine
Ok now stop talking too much and crying all time,now fight is that what u wanted
Ukranians are brave people
This MF Zelinsky is fucked up what for he needs weapons for, his People are dying his country is destroyed, stop fucking fight NATO is evil and the father is USA  they send weapon for their interest and Zelinsky is an idiot
Thank them also when you get a nuclear weapon on your roof.
Hey biden cash in the 100 billion seized cash from Russia sotting in the USA  get Russia to pay the Ukranians
Russia will never lose against ukraine no matter how big the military aid is flowing to ukr.just like the US will never lose a war against Mexico no matter how big the military aid Russia or china might give to mexico.same.to scotland against britain.etc etc.the rest is being delusional."
Just as "The pen is mightier than the sword" Edward Bulwer Lytton so, a meal is mightier than a missile for it brings us together rather than blowing us apart. Life is about relationship - Unity amidst diversity.
Blink on the warmonger
They just going to get thousands of Ukrainians killed. There is no way Ukraine can win against Russia. Fighting Russia using Ukraine as a proxy is evil
It’s so heart-breaking to see the plight of the Ukraine's brave soldiers taking their last stand in Mariupol. These heroes are determined to fight till to their last drop of blood. Like the heroic people of Ukraine, the people of Burma are also taking their last stand to stamp out the military dictators from the land, once and for all. The National Unity Government (NUG) which is formed in the liberated areas by the elected members of the parliament by the people in 2020 general election has declared to begin an “offensive war” from now on against the military regime, from the previous defensive positions. Loads of junta forces’ wives and children are now fleeing the city of Yangon, to the military stronghold city of Naypidaw in droves, in fear of attacks from the guerrilla forces. On 19 April 33 junta’s soldiers were killed and 42 wounded in a 15 days battle with the KNU. In other news, 5 police and 50 soldiers were killed by mines and attacks near Hteelin (ထီးလင်း) by the People’s Defence Forces - PDF (Democratic Voices of Burma DVB in Burmese 19 Apr 2022). For revenge, soldiers burned villages along the way. Students, who were protesting peacefully on the streets before, are now becoming PDFs and have trained systematically to fight back the military regime. At the beginning, they started with catapults and hunting rifles, but they now have some automatic weapons bought by donations from the people through black markets. They will not stop until they get the victory. They have trained well and are now gaining momentum (BBC in English 22 Apr 2022 “Myanmar - Young rebels fighting for democracy” & 01 Feb 2022 “The deadly battles that tipped Myanmar into civil war”).  Fight on heroes of Ukraine till you defeat the Russian invaders! We will also fight on till we get our freedom and democracy! May the hero President Zelenskyy and the heroic people of Ukraine defeat the cruel Russian invaders!
These weapons will not help Ukraine....... They will just cause much more deaths........ And the outcome will be just the same. The total destruction of Ukraine.
Thank you for assisting and helping Ukraine... May GOD continue to bless and protect all the countries for the sake of freedom peace and democracy... glory to UKRAINE..
Civilians remain trapped by who? You know well
Can Palestinians have the same weapons to defend themselves??
I am from the United States. And I know that Ukraine will repel Russia. The weapons we provided will really put a dent Into russias military.  They have took out 8 generals and how many tanks? Hundreds....what your providing them will be used to not only protect civilians but blow up Russian equipment.  That also helps protect Poland or other nearby countries. The less stuff Russia has the better off everyone else is..... process of elimination.
You're just impossible. Warming up war, not piece and negotiation
The shift in US opinion has possibly not been so much related to their opinion on whether Ukraine can win but rather whether or to what extent Russia may escalate. The allies have probably reached the conclusion that Russian threats have limited substances and to cower in the face of this perceived thread risks allowing an un deserved victory by Russia that history will describe as one of the greatest ruse de guerre of all time.
2 months after the war started (again)
Finally providing weapons? Wtf was EU and US doing before than? Where did the Javelins,NLAWs, and Stingers come from? That is ungrateful altitude
Yessss TYJ NAH UKRAIN GETEM GETEM ALL EVEN PUTIN

Free Ukrainian civilians. Slava Ukraine
The NAZIS are now directly in place in our country the propagandist is unprecedented is this why BERNIE was smeared and cow towed for the Biden crime family
Zellenskyy must ask himself .... What kind of "victory" is he going to achieve? His country is being razed to the ground ...his people ... and soldiers ... are dying.   It's going to be an empty victory ... IF he is "victorious".
Next debate where to find the funds for a universal healthcare plan in the united states.
GOD help you. brave and courageous UKRAINIAN
Rescue your comrades in Mariupol. God is with you .
GOD help you. brave and courageous UKRAINIAN
Thank You for support with weapons.God bless.🇺🇦💪
i would imagine they decided to send them as soon as the original news story broke, but we're on a need to know basis :)
Giving weapon and continue war not peace and love... what will be affected are the people who have no voice for their government.
Slava ukraine  🇺🇦
I'm DEFINITELY not familiar with warfare, but I don't know if Ukrainians being in these steel things will make them safer,  or if  it's a higher chance that Ukrainians will suffer burning like the invader?  Someone with expertise share something please, thanks.
Ukraine will be around longer than Putin? Is that code for assassination? World could only hope.
Thank you Lord 🙏 you hear our prayers to save Ukrainians soldiers and civilians 🙏 the whole world send their help to Ukraine 🙏
Give them the tanks Germany!
Great job go home russians enjoy your life as it is to short.
One soldier that's fighting for his country and family is worth 10 soldiers being told to fight from a dictator 🇺🇦
I wonder if God is on side  Russia's influential  church leader..  or Ukraines breakaway church?
Putin the killer
👍👍👍👍👍
Russia is winning the war, you only need to look at a map to see that. Ukraine needs all the help it can get from the West to resist.
Notice calling out ( partners ) That's what Zelenskiy tries to get other countries involved with his war. A simple thank you would have been enough.
God be with the Ukrainians 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Russia will destroy all of it. I hope Prussia will hit the warehouse using cruse missiles.
💪💙🙏💛💪
A small message to all the innocent and suffering Ukrainian, my dear loving Ukrainian the love of the people of the world is with you Ukrainian, all the peace loving people people's and nations/countries are with you, and you will not be left alone at this time of trouble, stay United, stand up tall and fight against the merciless invaders Russian armies, Glory to Ukraine🇺🇦👍👍👍
Why won't  West give weapons  yo Palestine.  This is hog wash. Hope putin wins we tired of  Nato thinking they are kings
Putin is closet homosexual.
Ukraine will kick Russian out of their Country
😂😂its funny how Putin put a travel ban santion on John the speaker and other media and Harris😂 like if his sanctions mean anything, noone wants to go to Russia anyways.
Zelensky Is a terrorists funded by Biden if Ukraine told nato to fuk off if Russia only wanted peace why is usa funding this from both sides
I hope people aren't too hard on Zelenskiy. He has been vocal, demanding, pushy, and dramatic, but could there possibly be a time where such behavior is more necessary? He gets a pass from me on manners. He's doing an amazing job, and I hope we give him absolutely everything he needs. I'm ashamed the US didn't send the fighter jets, or outright join the fight. The people running this country are a lot more afraid of WW3 than I am.
People of Ukraine waiting to be liberated from Kiev junta by Russian army...
Zelensky has no support of Ukrainian people... Zelensky is doomed
Russians:thank you Biden, we will destroy all your weapons, we will experiment our other hypersonic missiles so the west can watch that...
GET UM BOYS!
All them years while afraid of your neighbors,Maybe you should have invested in war And death to defend yourselves.Humans are fuking terrible.
Zelensky is not going to survive
Zelensky is a war criminal...
Mistake compounded by larger mistakes.
Western weapons can only prolong the war but it can't stop Russia from taking Ukraine. US would have to start WW3 and confront Russia using nuclear weapons in order to stop Putin, but the West is wise enough not to do so. Sending military aid to Ukraine is a just a way for US to saved its face internationally. Ukraine must start being friendly to Russia and make concessions in its territory. Russia will eventually defeat Ukraine. If the US can't stop the Taliban, how much more the Russians. Pride is the root cause of this War. First, Nato fails to respond to Russia's Ukaine no Nato status. Second, Ukraine fails to befriend Russia. Third, Russia does not want anymore NATO expansion.
Give Ukraine all the weapons it needs. Ukrainian s are doing the fighting,dying to preserve freedom
''We are sure, with this weapons, we will save the lifes of thousands of people'' Zelensky !?
Sure Zelenskyy, this is why you look so miserable! Putin is draining the swamp in Ukraine and he is doing an amazing job! Otherwise Dementia Joe, the EU and NATO officials, and the MSM would not be so f---desperate!
More weapons for Russia to collect.
Great Satan will not change its ways .
Give them Hell!! Slava Ukraine
it is so shame to watch how western world keep to delay the most necessary help to Ukraine..
https://youtu.be/bN68OfFKaWs
it doesnt appear as if moscows actual ambitions are identical to how american expectations want to define them. with ukraine as an allied interest, the american level of support is limited by how concerned the regional commitments actually are. theyre on their third cup of coffee now, debating the pros and cons. with ukraine as the next best distraction for saint josephs corruption dementia amnesia and fraudulent election authority, an unconstitutional ballot box clinton clubhouse scam, the american level of support is somewhere between an oscar slap and hunters missing laptops. the ones with the diplomacy extortion proposition schemes, and russian hookers being briefed by the biden oligarchy.
What a joke 😂😂😂 these Ukrainian soilders, waiting inside their trenches for their death, They are waiting for super power to fight, it's not bravery it's a suicide, US & NATO using Ukrainian blood to fight against Russia, Zelensky is the puppet of US, they are sending heavy weapons to Ukraine it doesn't work there is  no infra structure in war zone and Russian have Air superiority they will have easy target for Russian, US & NATO laughing how we make fool's to Ukrainian fighting our war, such a Brian less fool 🤭🤭
My prayers go to the Palestinians
Thanked them for making him rich
Thank goodness, Slava Ukraine, fight them back back to their frontier X
Well thank God Zelensky was so persistent in all most begging for more powerful military equipment  as in tanks and Jets (I mean Jet parts wink 😉 wink) It's definitely about time. It's to bad Germany is still sitting on the fence when it comes to these matters but at least they have broken there old ways and have given some supplies. For the future of this planet we really need to keep giving the Ukraine Army constantly more ammo and equipment of all types to keep there momentum up so they will indeed be able to deplete Russia's army down to a minimal amount so that Putin can be over thrown and a diplomatic government be put in place by the people of Russia.  Go 🇺🇦 Ukraine 🇺🇦 Go !!!
Sarmat is Russia's answer to military aid and nuke is Russia's ultimate answer.
What a relief for them to get what they need.
Applebaum said about Hunter Biden's laptop that that is "irrelevant"?
Thank you allies for supporting Ukranine but they need more money.. give them all until you ruin yourself
There is no civilians trapped in Mariupol! Trapped civilians are in Kramatorsk and Kharkiv, trapped by Ukrainian authorities
Zelensky is the biggest threat to humanity and Ukraine in particular, he's willing to sacrifice lives and his country just to hold on to power, and USA is helping cause it has a chance to finally fight off the biggest adversary. All the past years Ukraine remained neutral now the sudden change resulting in war is frightening considering that it had no threat and no one can invade Ukraine even Russia couldn't, for godsake I thr poorest country in Europe, absorption of it will create financial instability for any developed country
#ukraine #biden #nato #eu #uk  West: In WWF voice "in this corner, we have Putin standing 5'0" weight in at 120#" AND in that corner we have Z-z-z-elensky standing 5'11" weight in at a buff 195#....  "get ready to rumble"!  USA: kick butt Zelensky UK: get em mate NATO: use diplomacy Zelensky Russia: hold up a blank paper  (I like WWF, do I had to announce the fight)
Yah President Zelensky its a circle of life or Geopolitics the Western alliances buys Russians oil n gas to Russia in order for them to produce and sell arms to the whole wide world and make money and give and donated some to you to defend Ukraine from Russians invasion and Russia in turn gets money from selling oil n gas to prompt and finance their war efforts against Ukraine! Life goes on and on! K
Puppetlenskyy and his thugs should surrender and face the music.
About  time. Tx
save lives of thousands people?? are you kidding me?? you killed them in Bucha, train station, Mariupol.... you re joke... clown
Wonderful escalation from the West. Very good. I'm sure this will end the war....
People want to look into Ukraine's human rights record before all this happened and you might not be so sympathetic,it's appalling and Russia isn't the only place with oligarchs,the Ukraine is corrupt as hell
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Panoramic is the beautiful ♥. https://youtu.be/Xr5jkfDGZm4 🇮🇩🇵🇸🇷🇺💪
Russia, now u cannot stop USA for supplying weapons to Ukraine....hhhh if u try to, oh thats the end of u Putin
ukuraina to tatakau
Sounds like he is kind of ungrateful. We didn't have to give you anything, ever.
Push back  russian soldiers from Ukraine  ! .. Slava Ukraine ! ..
honestly, the only way to stop all of these problems is to invade russia.
next time spice up your defense unit
Ukraine will PREVAIL in the war  ! .. Slava Ukraine !
Proverbs 16:25  There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
There has been a shift. Assesments are base on information. We over assessed the Russian strength and down played their weaknesses. Ukraine has shown that Russia is far weaker than we thought.
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.   (1 Corinthians 15:20-23)
Proverbs 16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
Bout fuking time.
Urrraaa Ukraini 👊👊👊 kick out those aggressors !!
Putin and his army are garbage 🗑
Take back all your losses and some from Stalingrad!
Bring em on! More weapons for Russia!!
We're all gonna fuckin die in a nuclear war very soon all cause of a few men

War Monger America, Its Puppet and Blind Followers in EU, and Stupid President of Ukraine are main culprits who pushed innocent ukrainians into this bloody War.
pray for Ukraine protection from Russian agression
Push the Russians back then take some land from them see how they cope with war on their land
Thank you to all countries helping Ukrainian people may God bless you all
SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦 ♥️ ❤️ 💖 😍 ✨️ WE R PRAYING FOR  U ALL💯🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🕊💜🏜🌍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I would love to see the "tables" of the war turned against Russia. Are we the people of the rest of the world, going to just let this Atrocity fall on the way side, or are we going to make Russia pay? Sanction are soft, retreats are not much harder than soft sanctions. What we need is to chop the HEAD off of Russia, starting with the Kremlin. Like a RODS FROM GOD into the Kremlin kind of thing. The Russians, and Putin, are a crazy barbarian state, that only understands violence. We has a global community must insure that PUTIN loses both limbs and is effectively neutralized, so that He can never do this again for 50 years. AMPTUTATION and the TRAUMA of that, would give PUTIN the food for thought that he needs.

Weapons will only prolong the war and that is what the west want to weaken Russia and they don't care about Ukrainians suffering 😣😣....Why don't NEGOTIATE?  Putin is targeting hospitals and clinics and buildings but America don't care they like to turn with place into  a battleground  fighting "the good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun".
Ukraine kick those Russian  asses back to Russia....
The Chirches should be telling Putin to withdraw and stop the Genocide, not asking him nicely to let Civilians out!!!!! Their failure to stand up and condemn the war is an act of cowardice and moral failure.
Ukraine never independent. The Current inllegal goverment just choose to be American bitch rather than their Brother in blood Russia. What a disgusting betrayal.
Finally? FINALLY? We have been providing weapons since week 1. How F'n disrespectful.
We MUST stop Putin or face global consequences for generations to come.
These people have shown they have the courage, will, determination and ability to fight.  Give them the proper tools and they will win, no doubt about it!
Ukraine should have never been put in a position where they have to kill as many Russian soldiers as humanly possible. Death to Putin and his failed army.
Your welcome ! [from US tax payers] please try to refrain from requesting anymore munitions or weaponary for like,  2 days?!  Lastly,  Kirby,  calling heavy weapons, "TOOLS" is pathetic..
Russia will not fall. Russia will succeed!
should invent a missile that only homes in on tyrants, well i dont think its a bad idea
Mariupol has been denazified
Biden,a flinken eu nato,eu don't talk much

Without President Biden, Ukraine would be lost
form a United Nation expeditionary force of volunteers to thwart the Russian invasion.  Russia's ultimate goal is to make Ukraine landlocked and in the coming years, ultimately choke Ukraine into accepting union with Russia (unless the free world gets boots on the ground now).
Don't worry ... The West will fight till last Ukrainan..
😂😂😂Russia is still gonna fuck em Nazis in the arse
fuk ukraine and fuk the war mongering nato
PLECASE HELPS THEM    HAS YUO CAN  BECUSE THEY HELPLESS
I know it has taken some time, but let´s think of the alternative. If the world had supplied the arms before the invasion, given Kiev´s reluctance to believe Putin would invade, a large amount of modern weapons would now be in the hands of the Russians, thus making them stronger. Nobody knew what way the invasion would happen, and that has an effect on the decision of which arms and tactics the defence would need. Now that we can see how things are happening, the correct tools can be sent to do the correct job. The final nail in Putin´s coffin will be to get Germany a new oil/gas supply or a doable alternative. When/if that happens, and Germany start to pull their own weight, the conflict will be over within weeks, and Russia will have no choice but to leave Ukrainia and start paying the bill for the damages.
Glória a Deus a grande ajuda dos EUA a Ucrânia nessa luta contra o invasor russo que ataca a humanidade. Amém 🙌🙏
The 9th of May will be a worldwide ANTI-PUTIN DAY!! The Russian revolution will begin!! LET'S GO PHOO'TIN!!!
Now lock down the air space
Victory for Ukraine. Shame and death to Russia.
What a smuck, Azov has been crushed! Thier last stronghold position is now in the control of the DPR!
No way for Ukraine to win only more young men to die for western banks
Great to hear Ukrainians are finally given a real chance to defend what’s theirs by birthright. Go Ukraine 🇺🇦. Greetings from Australia 🇦🇺
There already beating back the Russians
Russia will put the neo nazies back in the cage.  Finally the world will see the true colors of the usa uk eu. Stand strong and keep going Russia!
Putin doesn't want to let nobody in because he still needs to cover up all his war crimes and get rid of bodies anybody into the city
Wouldnt it be just Karma that Putin loses Crimea while bogged down in the Dumbas
More donations to go to the hands of Russia.. I saw Russia parading the javelins, vehicles donated by NATO
They made their choice long time ago... Fight till the last ukrainian..
Soon enough all of this will be in Russia hands and Ukraine will cry again for more weapons lol
Slava Ukraini 🇬🇧🇺🇦🌻💪 Victory For Ukraine 🍾🍺
I just wish they had moved quicker . Lots of needless civilian deaths .
Finally? Fuck him. I'd rather not 1 American dollar go to this assholes war.
Couple that with critical  intelligence...
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Its about time!!!!!   Once France is done with their elections, and Germany with its PM Partying During COVID19 issues, they can focus on helping more with weapons that will make #PutinaRunToTheMexicanBorder for some Hot flaming Tacos, as he awaits political assylum
I think the u.s is helping Russia to destroy Ukraine
May God give victory and glory to Ukraine ✊🇺🇦
HAHAHAHA " A sovereign Ukrain will be around longer than Putin". ZINGGGG. Russian army is a paper tiger. Time to topple a dicktatershit!
Good news Sending love to the Ukrainian people and army
Lord pls. Help ukraine
THATS WORD HELP A REAL HELP TO SEND TANKS AND OTHERS MILITARY HELP THEY NEED FOR IT IS NOT TOO LATE YET GLORY TO UKRAIN
The World owes you  everything Ukraine to resist brutal Russian attack from War Criminal Adolf Putin Hitler. We have to wait till the russian Population understands why they are losing Their Sons and husbands becaouse of one mans criminal behaiviour and stealing their money for more than 20 years with the Oligarchgs so gangster Putin can stay in power and stealing  more  and more money for luxury from the russian state, and take the little gangster to task. Мир обязан вам всем, Украина, чтобы противостоять жестокой российской атаке военного преступника Адольфа Путина Гитлера. Мы должны дождаться, пока российское население поймет, почему они теряют своих сыновей и мужей из-за преступного поведения одного человека и более 20 лет воруют их деньги с олигархами, чтобы гангстер Путин мог оставаться у власти и воровать все больше и больше денег для роскоши. из российского государства, и поймать маленького гангстера
Obviously Ukraine is not gonna win, it's day 59 in this war, in all that time shipments of weapons have lead to more Russian advances and with an already crippled Ukrainian army,  at this point they're not looking to win, they're looking to taking out as many Russian soldiers or tanks as possible before they loose.
He guarantees more of his civilians dying,and he hopes the russians will kill all banderas righr sector and azovs,as they have directly threatened the cocaine comedian
American nazis arm and support their ukrainian nazi puppets all american funded nazi war criminals will never win shame on them all
Very Nice Poutine l’homme fort 💪 pour toujours
Thanks to USA and God bless 🙏
People have no idea what Ukraine is. But it is funny to watch the Western Europeans crying crocodile tears over Ukraine that they all looked down on until a couple of months ago. LOL
Trying to make sense of this situation that the European and USA 🇺🇸 baited Putin to invade Ukraine 🇺🇦 as of 2008, 2014  and now full scale 2022. Here it would seem the world 🌎 has an unique opportunity to bleed Putin's Russia 🇷🇺 to become a failed state where nothing, absolutely nothing leaves or enters  Russia 🇷🇺. Where Russia 🇷🇺 is excluded from every organisation across the world expelled from the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. Where the only way back into the global community and global economy is the total nuclear disarmament of Russia 🇷🇺. Importantly where Putin and his oligarchs are jailed or otherwise, and where the Russian people take control of a democratic Russia 🇷🇺. It would seem this is once in a century opportunity for eternal peace across Europe; to get rid once and for all, the Russian 🇷🇺 threat. Sadly at the expense of the Ukrainian 🇺🇦 people and property. But all of Russia external assets; gold,  cash, oligarchs billions; Yachts, pays for every death, every building. The European 🇪🇺 leaders and previous USA 🇺🇸 Obama and now Biden it would seem; given how quickly these world 🌎 leaders got organised, basically over night, have already planned Russia's demise. Let's hope they keep the faith where they get rid of this evil 😈 Dictator to the hell fire 🔥 he deserves.
ALL  UKRAINIANS USE EVERYTHING  IN GOOD HEALTH AND KICK ASS AND TAKE YOUR COUNTRY  BACK SLAVA UKRAINI 💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙
Grande Putin continua così fino in fondo poi radi tutto al suolo e abbatti Biden che è il cancro del mondo e non fare prigionieri specialmente mercenari bruciali tutti poi faremo festa per una settimana
Russia va neo nazi. URA 🇲🇨🤝🏽🇷🇺
LOL suckers!
First time zenlesky said thank you. Now he has plenty of weapons and  he will provide it to civilian to fight. So when civilian hurt, he can still says.. they kill civilian :))
God bless our USA and Ukraine !
I was very critical of my government, now so PROUD of it and the administration. In 1776 we started a fight for our freedom and independence. We had help in that struggle, now in another part of world an smaller force is fighting valiantly for the same experience and outcome. It is just and proper we support the brave Ukrainians in their struggle. Freedom is never free. It's flame must be tended to and paid for in blood and treasure. Some of our efforts, such as Afghanistan were a failure, but you don't give up the ideal our support of those willing to make such sacrifice for their liberty. Ukraine's victory over tyranny will be Biden's legacy of foreign policy.
Now began real drama. Come on, Ukraine let's get back independence and freedom territory.
Russia is an evil empire. They should get rid of Putin before it is too late.
😂 those weapons won't be there for long, Russia will destroy these weapons and the luciferian agenda against humanity
Should’ve provided they months ago!!!
Let the bums arm themselves
Far too little and far too late. Biden is weak, senile, and completely incompetent.
hes gonna keep begging watch at the end we all know russia is going to win is just going to be bloodier
Lavrov: These are lethal weapons
Far too little, far too late. Bide is weak, senile, and completely incompetent.
Why don’t they ever show blown up Ukrainian tanks planes and military assets. They only show the blown up Ukrainian buildings and Russian losses. Ukraine aren’t Losing any military assets? Ever? Always wins?
We just saw a Russian tank, lol...are they stealing them...hahahaha Ukraine will be severely beaten by the Russian army
Seems like the western community are so unintelligent that they don’t know critical thinking…the media tells them what’s good for them and they end up supporting anything with zero knowledge.
*Zelensky: daddy,  Russia took my city and kick my soldiers out  😭* *US/Biden: don't cry son, I will give you "new toys" to beat Russia*  😤
YOU HAVE  THE  WEAPONS  OF  MASS DISTRUCTION NOW   SAVE THE  PEOPLE  I  KNOW  THAT U ALL ARE EXAUSETED  MAY GOD GIVE  U  EXTRA STRENGTH  GOD  BLESS
COMEDIAN leaders demolished the country. Ukraine is almost destroyed and the citizens are being killed. More civilian  death is a head as they beg for more weapons.
Out of USD600 million of weapons provided to Ukraine, 550 million will disappeared into someone's pocket. Zelenskyy and partners comes into mind.
This is getting more interesting.
No one asked me if I wanted to fund weapons for Ukraine.   Of course, no one asked me if I wanted to fund ANY of the wars that I'm helping to pay for, and would go to jail if I didn't. What a wonderful world it is...
If ukraine prevails; (with all the tactically weapons that much needed and  provided by American & NATO) nato prevails;  a defeat of ukraine, will be a defeat of us & nato morally on many grounds..whether it is america hegemony or its geo-political foreign policy particularly in europe.. american politics is all about continuing the war for a longer period to weaken russia strategically, it is the sole aim of US..
Aah!That channel  VOA is back to feed propaganda.
when we see the ruskies being forced back out of the eastern areas..then we will know its working
💙 G-D BLESS UKRAINE! 💛 An American Jew.
Fxxx you Agents of Death
Yes!
Ukraine is more than qualified to be a NATO member than other Europeans nation because they are capable of defeating the powerful mighty of Russian Communists and Terrorists.
Thank god the world got it together with the dang weapons request!
After the war, the thing Putin can say is... "At least I tried my best" while thousands shed blood.
John Kirby seems to be a very astute person,  he knows the correct words, phrases .. and how to say it..
I HOPE RUSSIA DESTROYS THE SHIT OUT OF UKRAINE. I hope all that money the US is sending goes straight into putin's hands besides all of it that biden is funneling to his own banks.
I TOLD U  THEY  WERE  PROVIDINGTOY  WEAPO NS  THAT IS  WHY  SO MANY    PEOPLE  HAVE  BEEN  SLAUGHTED       SO  MANY  LIVES   COULD  HAVE BEEN  SAVE  U The  suppliers  off toy  weapons  These WEAPONSNOW  COULD  HAVE  BEEN  SUPPLIED EARLIER AND  THE  SOLDIERS WOULD  NOT HAVE  BEEN  EXAUHTED
Imagine the the lives saved with weapons 😍
Garbage propaganda network report. Full of dog sh      pure lying. This lunatic is going  to be arrested  soon
GOD BLESS  UKRAINIANS Soldiers fighting for PEACE FREEDOM DEMOCRACY & JUSTICE
USA vs Russia  Battle Ground: Ukraine
God bless and protect Ukriane

YEAH GOOD ARMS BUSINESS... WHAT'S YOUR CUT?
'Finally'...nope..wait for a week or two, he will be asking for more.
Zelensky;a foolish comedy; shame on you for your unlimited dependency on  world's #1 enemies who are assisting your nations death for their hidden agenda! Please weak up from your deep sedation!!!!!!! Great victory to Russia and Ukraine against the proxy war Merchants!!!
Putin needs to call it off and send his people home. P.S thanks for the weapons and things they need to fight. Send help to Mariupol now please.
El derecho ajeno es la pazadmiro el presidente  Zenlezky esa valentia y Lo mas importante que todos estan unidos y asi hacen la fuerza y gracias a todos los paises que estan apollando a Ukraine  Dios los bendiga  a todos
Nice...Russia won't know what hit them now 💛💙
Ukraine win??? They've lost already...the civilians are pawns to their leaders. Oh well...
The end shall tell. More arms more deaths and distructions no USA and UK army will die
Thanks for the great USA🇺🇸 and the great NATO for the best help of Ukraine🇺🇦 because the Plan of Putin with a lot of Musalmaan was the capturing so many countries and spreading the Islamic terrorism but Islam and terrorism cannot live in a house because the house of Islam is in Jannat and the house of terrorism is in Jahannam through like Putin, Firon Iblees etc. But the baddest Putin government have showed the terrorism of Islam and again I am saying Islam and terrorism cannot go as friends but only enemy. So the Allah Rabbul Aaleminl Rabbul Izzat is saying in Quran that terrorism cannot accept in the religion IslamIslam and the Shaitan Iblees is open enemy of human beings.
All of us who manufacture weapons would like to thank Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelinskyy for provoking this war and for not surrendering after it was effectively lost in the first two days of fighting. We were really worried about our jobs with Trump but no more, we can't thank you enough, Thank You
🇺🇸 We stand by you, We stand with you 🇺🇦.  We Are The "Military Warriors Prayer"  UKRAINE SHALL PREVAIL
God blessed Ukraine 🇺🇦 after you pushed all the Russian out from Ukraine 🇺🇦 used their tank to throw missile on their country so they know how it feels to be bombarded by their missilery shoot all their tank back to Russia 🇷🇺 sank all their war ship 🚢 under the Black Sea that way they cannot harm any country ever again
Zelensky has the courage and wisdom of Winston Churchhill..That evil currupt souls as Puten must be stopped.sooner the better.
Next thing you going to read about is: "China provides weapons to Russia"  This buffed up war is going to end up bad..
GO R U S S I A ! ! !
Zelensky wanted WAR not peace from day zero onwards , USA 🇺🇸 supports WAR Not peace in Globe 🌎 every 2 years USA makes Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan. Yemen , Vietnam ……etc
Military assistance will not help as has been proven thus far. The west is fooling the Ukranians by this kind of support.
Yes! Long live Ukraine! ❣❣❣💙💛💙💛 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 fr PH 🇵🇭
But what he really wants is some more of that good coke.
Point of notice to all countries nowadays..Bitta hardware is essential
Russia can use china use nuclear weapons on Ukrainian us NATO worth shit anyway
Ukraine /Zelinsky is holding onto friends NATO/West/America that is watching them being killed and country destroyed. How crazy is this Zelensky then people still call him a hero. He belong in a madhouse. His seriously something wrong upstairs
We love Ukraine but unfortunately, this is what Biafrans are going through for over a decade now, What the west did is supply weapons to the Nigerians Government to continue the ethnic cleansing going on in Biafraland many other parts of Southern Nigeria. Congrats to Russians on Mariupols.
Well done NATO etc but no thanks to  the UN.
how does a highly educated ukraine end up in the toilet...zelensky/nuland/usa/nato/eu god bless you if you want more of that
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦♥
Little by little comedian Zelensky and gang are selling all this free weapons in the black market and this weapons start to appear in Africa and other places. Hypocrisy and war will get paid with my tax money. Sanctions just hurt the economy. This is the WORSE president America ever had elected after second worse one: Donald Trump. At least Trump won't bring us to the brink of WW3
Sounds like a declaration of world war to me
They should not be telling anyone what type weapons just like Canada did
We want peace talk not weapons! Let's give peace a chance!. The US is making billions and the Ukraine have to pay this in years to come!  The longer this conflict the more lives are going to be lost!
This  is war beetwin  Rosja  and USA..like III WW...  After many  ather  like Wietnam..Irak....Syria...Yugoslawia...and whu  will be nekst..??

Apabila benar Rusia ( putin dan sekutunya menang perang di sebagian wilayah Negara Ukraina yg Merdeka dan berdaulat Penuh),Sy sangat2 Yakin dan percaya muncul lagi Model baru,bentuk penjajahan moderen dan sdh kembali kepada hukum Rimbah,Hukum Padang Pasir,Hukum Tantangan dan jawaban artinya Siapa saja negara yg kuat dan berani melakukan Invasi Militer kenegara2 merdeka dan berdaulat penuh,Negata itulah yg menang.Martabat,Harga Diri,Nama bersar dan diagungkan oleh seluruh dunia terhadap PBB,NATO,AS dan Sekutunya.Jatuh,hancur memalukan.Implikasi perang ini sangat berpengaruh besar dan tdk bisa dibendung terhadap Negara2 sedang berkembang dan negara dunia ketiga/ belum maju utk bergabung dg Negara Agresor Rusia dan sekutunya,apalagi Rusia sdh berhasil menarik para terorisme dunia utk bergabung dgnya (perang melawan Ukraina).PBB,NATO,AS dan Sekutu sudah didikte secara nyata oleh Preiden Putin dan Sekutunya Perang Dunia ke 3 dan menggunakan NUKLIR.PBB,NATO,AS dan sekutu menjadi manusia mati Rasa,mati syuri,mental krupuk sunggu2 memalukan.sangat2 prihatin sekali dg para pemimpin NATO,US,PBB dan sekutu pada saat ini sangat rendah integritas sebagai seorang pejuang membela kebenara,keadilan dllnya sangat jauh berbeda dg para pemimpin NATO,AS dan sekutu dan PBB  pada masa dahulu mereka tegas,bijaksana dan langsung mengambil sikap yg tegas,terukur dan pada akhirnya menciptakan pedamaian.sy kritik anda semua kr merasa prihatin sekali melihat di berita TV,media masa diseluruh dunia betepa keji dan biadabnya Rusia dan sekutunya melakukan perang membabibuta terhadap umat manusia Ukraina dan infrsmastuktur mereka hancur tdk keruhan.Saatnya harus serangan balik dan mematikan,supaya tdk terjadi lagi Invasi kenegara2 lain kedepannya.maaf apabia saya salah.
The Ukraine war is NATO's dirty play to achieve its ambition of becoming a monster, the Sole Ruler of the World. Russia is the main obstacle to these ambitions, therefore Russia must be isolated and weakened by sanctions until it becomes a weak Pariah state, as Biden said.
The US promised many years ago to defend Ukraine provided they disarm nuclear arsenal.  So they did.  Biden needs to uphold that and not too late!  POS!  I loathe Biden!  Please know the US ppl stand with you and are trying to push this “president Biden” to do the responsible thing!
SLAVA UKRAINI...HEROYAM SLAVA  !!!! Long live Ukraine and the West !!! The mighty Ukrainian bravehearts will prevail and be victorious. Putin must call an unconditional to stop this war and avoid an upcoming rout from the Ukrainians.
Zelenskyy's folly is that he doesn't realize that he has been used by NATO as a pawn to provoke and frame Russia, to go to war. The US and UK will do everything they can to keep the war going, with the hope that the longer the war, the weaker Russia will be.
Zelensky is a criminal.
Very proud of Ukraine. Love and peace to all Ukrainian people.
In addition, to achieve NATO's ambitions, without shame and respect for the freedom of independent countries, the US and UK as NATO controllers, actively suppress, intimidate, and threaten other peace-loving countries that do not implement  sanctions .
GOD bless Russia 🇷🇺 🙏...... don't be afraid of anything 🙏 do as you planned to do God bless Russia
Mr. Zelensky if you really want to save lives of the ukranians you should resign
You will cry with your poisoned donation from NATO / USA.
What a clown to sell out Ukraine to zionist
slava cocaine, glory heroin
SLAVA UKRAINI
USA is the number one country in the world that you cant trust
The CLOWNS ALWAYS  like weapons!!!  They peoples are starving!! You cannot defeat the RUSSIAN!!!  AMERICA IS LOOSE HIS MONEY TO UKRAINE WITHOUT BENEFITS!!! 🇺🇲👎👎👎👎👎
Thank God..Ukrainian really needs the help from friends God bless you..we kept on praying for for the Ukrainian people...
Blah blah bunch of hypocrites
Your country is d battle grand and u are receiving more arms to destroy it more Ukraine go for dialogue let be a round table talk between Ukraine and Russia for the sake of civilians
Send more weapons to ukraine so that ukraine will destroyed!!
one thing you can count on Ukrainians , you are not alone
It took Ukraine to lock horns with the devil? Putin's Russia has been practicing evil for a long time and everyone gave him the freedom to do so until Ukraine said "No more!"
I am very happy the America leaders helped Mr President Zelenskyy with the requested weapons. Thank you very much to USA and EU. Please also donate food, water n medical supplies to Ukraine soldiers. There are female Ukraine soldiers please also donate the things that women need like pad.
Just the most recent two $800M aid packages will deliver 90 Howitzers, 188,000 rounds of ammo, 120 classified drones (allegedly tailored for use in terrain like eastern Ukraine, hundreds more Javelin missiles, new ''Switchblade' drones (considered a 'loitering munition', probably more stingers, along with LOTS more items not publicly itemized. While the U.S. is by far the largest supplier, many other countries are supplying jets, tanks, anti tank weapons, armored vehicles.  Given this is collectively, far more firepower than Ukraine had when they routed the Russians from Kiev, the Russians in the Donbas and Crimea are in for some serious 'hurt'. I almost feel sorry for them (just kidding)
It's a little late but better than nothing. The west didn't trust Ukrainian army' s abilities until the Ukrianian show their morale now. They should supplied those weapons at the beginnings of the war, the outcome would have been different.
GLORY ALWAYS TO THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE UKRAINE, U SOLDIERS, GURL'S AND GUY'S ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY GREAT FIGHTING FOR YOUR  COUNTRY.🙏💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙🙏.

Stay Strong Ukraine, at last the world is acting after so many deaths of innocent Ukrainian people and young soldiers who are sent to their deaths.
About time, should of gave them immediately but God willing this will make a difference
GOD BLESS UKRAINE AND ALL GOOD ALLIED COUNTRIES
The USA needs to train about 50 Ukrainian military on underwater demolition to blow up the Crimea 🌉.
Why is Europe still buying $850 million dollars of Russian oil per day?
crossdresser, drunk, drug abuser..............
Providing weapon for more casulties for both parties... Why not be a bridge for peacetalk of this two parties. Do they have a lot of profit by giving more weapon to ukraine. Pay later?🤥🤥🤥

Yay the war can go on - and more humans can die for no reason at all woohoo!! and we the good boyz support a corrupt country thats neither in NATO nor in EU lets gooo!! braindead sheep...
It’s alright being given weapons logistics etc and thanking all the governments and people’s of nations supplying! Now try and keep hold of them I see the Russians have captured another huge warehouse storing them 🤬
Thank you America!
Still people's are in illusion and fantasy provided by mainstream scumbags 💩 Give them some food and shelter along with medicine... You f'king idiots

Viva Ucrania. Vivan todos colaboradores Viva su ejército/////_/
Amen Glory to be God  thanks lots countrys to help ukrain🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤❤❤❤❤❤🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Ukraine has lost, they just don't know it yet. Once Russia destroys the Azov Nazis there will be nothing stopping them. Don't count on the US to do anything, they lost a war to goat farmers.
Amen Glory to be God  thanks lots countrys to help ukrain🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤❤❤❤❤❤🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Where're the  Weapons ,that was supplied by US to Ukraine for 7yrs ? They're corruptions took place needed to be investigated thoroughly before supply the current lethal.
I thought DEMONCRATS were anti war? Peace and love 🧐
PARA QUE EL EJÉRCITO RUSO SE RETIRE DE UCRANIA, LOS UCRANIANOS DEBEN AFILIARSE RÁPIDAMENTE A LA OTAN. DE NO HABER DESOCUPACIÓN RUSA, ENTONCES SERÁN EXPULSADOS POR LA VÍA MILITAR.  👥⚕️👥
USA will have to up its donations if it is even going to match the €1Bn A DAY that the EU supplies to Russia in the form of oil and gas payments.
Finally?  We didn't owe them weapons in the first place.  They're not even a NATO nation and weren't a member of the EU.  He should be grateful for our help, not critical of when and how much of it he gets.  We're risking WW3 helping him.  And since Biden saw fit to purchase oil from Russia, we're now experiencing skyrocketing gas prices because we're helping them.  And nobody is even addressing the issue that China and India are both backing Russia right now instead of us, and now China is eyeballing Taiwan.  People were so eager to "stand with Ukraine" and dump out all their Russian vodka in a virtue signalling show of support.  If China invades Taiwan, will those same people toss out 95% of their household items that were made in China?  I'm not in favor of this invasion but I also don't want us dragged into WW3 over it, especially a nuclear war with Russia.  I find it very strange that the US is so invested in Ukraine that they're willing to risk a nuclear war over it.
Send them russians back in body bags🤩
0:29
Take back all your territory. Don't give an inch to the invaders. Go Ukraine !
Ukraini 🇵🇰🇺🇦😭💓

Boots on the ground will end this war sooner with less life lost.
I am curious how many army man Ukraine army have in total whose fighting on frontline if someone can answer?
God bless Ukraine President military people and foreign volunteer 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏
It's the time to directly n openly attack usa bcz usa indirectly help in this war frm behind

Thank you all for everything you have done to help Ukraine , it's highly appreciated,the Lord will do the rest,
Keep supplying weapons to ukraine
Not cool for putin not to truce during Easter, now that new arsenals are available to Ukraine, it's time to get this done! Slava Ukraine ua
Meanwhile in the real world: 1 UK waives sanctions on key Russian banks - British authorities are allowing payments to a Russian financial institution to safeguard the European Union gas supply. 2 UN refuses to back Ukrainian “genocide” claims -The international body says it hasn’t documented such patterns during the Ukrainian crises.  3 German Government is evicting Afghan refugees from their homes to make room for Ukrainians.  4 Cuba thanks Russia for 19,526 tons of wheat donation 5 Chechens give a big Thank You to NATO for another big batch of beautiful weapons  Ukraine doesn't need more weapons. Ukraine needs an anti-extremism legislation, anti-corruption laws, and an external court of appeal. But why pass these legislations when you can keep getting money from the US.
more weapons to prolong the bloodshed..
May God be with you  President Zelenskyy and all the freedom fighters.
Here they come RUSSIA, UKRAINE is gonna get y'all and revenge is best served cold. #🇺🇦VICTORYFORUKRAINE🇺🇦

This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.
🙏🙏🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦ขอให้พระเจ้าคุ้มครอง และชงปกป้องประเทศ UKraine 🇺🇦 พ้นขีดอันตราย มารร้ายรุกราน ของ Russia 🇷🇺
more stingers and javelins for ukraine at least 10000 of each.
Glory to Ukraine from SA.
As an American I’m sorry you don’t have the support you need to negotiate peace. That you’re stuck surrounded by warmongers & not brave enough on your own to stand against Nazis. I’m saddened how many of your own people have been killed under your watch by nationalists. I pray one day soon you realize the importance of demilitarizing your country & protecting ALL of your people. Until then, I suggest others watch Ukrainian Agony to see how the people of the east have been forced to live for 8 yrs. I think 14,000 deaths is enough. I think anyone who fights along side or condones Nazis is wrong. 🇺🇦🙏🇷🇺 watch Patrick Lancaster. Listen to the people
Glory to Ukraine soldier and country people 💪
...🇿🇦🕊🇺🇦
Fellow Americans, Get prepared! A war like our country has never seen is approaching our doorstep. Pray fervently for peace.
actually you are not a victim of Russia but a victim of Zelenski's stupidity who wants to be America's puppet, so that sacrificing his country and his own people is Zelenski's stupidity...... The fact is that America itself is afraid to fight Russia directly, so Ukraine is made into a puppet of America and used as a test of American weapons.... then what are you proud of..?? you should have demanded Zelenski resign from the President because of his stupidity, the Ukrainian state and people were destroyed....😀😃😄😁😆😅🤣😂
Propaganda news which will led more fight more death more distraction more infrastructure damage.  How many weapons western nation can provide but these weapons will never enter in to the Ukraine because Russian will hit them in border.  These all western leaders drinking in the wheels together to thinks that Ukrainian will win the war against Russian mighty army !
I thought Russia was a Christian nation. Do you really know what this fight is about?
Will see where this go
How much land will Ukraine have to give up to end war?  This is what was planned all along.  Russia will get the port cities which the free world planned to give Putin all along.   The United States, European Union, and NATO, behind the scenes were letting Putin get the Southern Port cities to keep the pouting child from using nuclear weapons.  Why?  Why are they finally giving Ukraine what they need after soooo much begging?  Why did it take so long, with delays, delays, delays.   This should of happened up front when the war begin, and the intelligence agencies of these organizations should have been on top of all this.  But they failed miserably.   I hope this isn't to little to late, that Ukraine has to give up it's southern lands to end the war.  I am totally ashamed and at awe of the "Western Free Nations".  If this is their kind of performance for all the nations, there will not be a free world to much longer.  The thinktanks that are so prevalent among these nations should have a plan for this kind of invasion such that the united free countries act like a swat team upon any actions like this.
Trump held back help because Ukraine could not give dirt on Hunter Biden. had he gave Ukraine what was needed then Putin would have stayed in his palace.
This is not new one, Nato, Ukhraine can't able to defeating Russia.
They are delirious to think they will win 😂😂
Praying for UKR
Slava UKR
Lol dislikes from Russki bot accounts again.
More arms to continue the war.. good business for US weapons industry...
Grory to Russia
I get zero money?
God Bless Ukraine  God Bless all who are helping and praying for Ukraine
Ukraine has proven it uses NATO supplied weapons well. We can see all the tanks and planes that have been destroyed. It's time to supply them with not just defensive weapons. Ukraine needs to go on the offense if it is to reclaim any territory that Russia claims. Slava Ukraina! The world stands by UKRAINE!
God bless Ukraine
More like with these weapons your gonna get yourself nuked
A leader who hide  behind cameras
The West’s response was sluggish. Many lives could have been saved if they had helped earlier.
The us can only so much before it starts effecting us more
FINALLY!!!
Devil's own country precipitating, enabling & encouraging fratricide between Ukraine and Russia.  This time will surely pass and this irresponsible & evil nation will come to judgement.  We pray that these scums and scorn of a nation will not prosper and their peace ceased.
Good and evil people Ukraine will prevail 👈😁
Man born and die ,we must do something to our mother nation
🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦👊👊👊🔥🔥🔥
Ukraine will be Victorious in this fight 🇺🇦🇯🇲

As an American, I'm glad you have the stronger weapons you needed, but apologize you got them so late...💔. Now kick some a**!! Yay!! Go UKRAINE🇺🇦!!
The world needs to be there for Ukraine and it's people.
Go Ukraine.  Slava Ukraine.  Get all of your Country back.  All of it - every inch back.
I am just so sorry that you were forced to wait so long. God Speed and God Bless Ukraine. 💖
I think everybody knows nuclear war is coming
Glory to Ending Ukraine government. Get that Zelensky out of politics and end the Azov battalion. Save the people. Not Zelensky.
The mega queen of war effort Victoria Nuland is sitting right by Blinkin. This Biden administration is 100% dedicated to the war in Ukraine while they are elected to serve/help US population.
John you need to give Ukraine some fighter jets please 🙏 Russian can't do anything they trying to let ever county afraid of them
