3:19 “they had more rabbits” *proceeds to show guinea pigs*
Tubbo shows himself holding a Guinea pig:   “ and they had more rabbits”
Was it just me that saw a bug on tubbos shirt moving when he talked about sleeping for 14 hours? 😭
Why did you say yeah it is as though you were offended at the mere suggestion that it was not unhealthy
Did anyone notice the "alrigth"? 😂
1,075th🥹
Tubbo is the type of guy to stream for 27 days and make it into a 12 minute video

stegi ist besser
A Dutch streamer streamt for 9 months or something like that his name is Serpent gameplay
nobody cares
Hi tubby how your friends doing
6:43 was that a bug on the bottom of tubbos shirt??
hi
We enjoyed the time we spent with you for 27 days. Thank You Tubbo.
Tubbo's dyslexia was really showing in this video (not to shame!!)
You cook what?
Imagine sleeping for 14 hours in front of thousands of people. LOL
There is: Tommy: spider-man Ranboo: spider-Gwen Tubbo: also spider-man😊❤
No you streamed 27 days of your life gay…
8:02 THE FACT THEY WERE USING HIS STREAM IN HIS PICTURE LMAO
2:16 tubbo was known as a really buff guy in his friend group and blood runs in the family
the bg music is giving me flashbacks to when it was in a fairy scavenger hunt game that got taken down when i was 9
11:02 rip Ranboo
I need the whole thing someone give it to me id like to watch a 648 hour videos
Oh boy, oh gee. 11:03 Tubbo just slaughters Ranboo, did anyone else notice?
6:41 did anyone else notice the bug(?) falling down his shirt? 😭
Tube you are the best ❤🎉
So you can stream 27 days of your life but not upload even 28 videos (edit) I’m joking
Me who chatted Dobby or creacher 😭
Havent really consumed any dsmp member content in a while, because.. you know..👑, but this makes me wanna watch the whole 27 day stream lol is it saved as a vod or something
you wanna say hi? no oh ok🥲
Lani has such a glow up i remember watching Tommy playing w her
Bro I can't find the vid😢
7:30 Im laughing so much when he said dude
worst youtber
Cool :)
Cheater
YOUR AMAZING
I ate a tomato. It was disgusting .
if technoblad was in mcc he would dominate
I love how he looks more deranged as the video goes on
Aww I love that dream is wearing a crown in honour of technoblade🥺
dang... u've done more things in a month than i have in my life...
God I needed him so bad😢
😊
Thumbnail of this vid is the face you make when you bouta sneeze
Anytime I’d log onto stream he was sleeping lol :(
Pov. Ur America.
a german streamer called LetsHugo streamed for 73 days straight.
His hair alone proves it's been a long 27 days
I’m the thumb nail he looked sickly…………..tubbo please take care of yourself
You’d think he’d have learned for Ludwig’s like month long subathon
Bro the electric bill
I dont know how u could have done that for as long as u did
Plants vs zombies music
i thought amsiy was tubbos sister?
aweseom editing C: the subathon was so fun
the tubbathon was really fun
That is wild man
Tubbo, dont forget that 1 day has 24 hours and if I remember in 100hrs there are 4days and 2 hrs
Looks sick 😂
maniac
Turbo how's was your date with Tommy
That’s crazy 💀
those are guinea pigs not rabbits 😭
I was confused why Tubbo live every day every hour and i check, and still don't know what's going on
I want Ranboo, Tubbo, Tommy and Wilbur to go actually ghost hunting like Ryan and Shane. Ranboo because he'd initiate it, Tubbo because he'd be forced to come along, Wilbur because he would love it, and Tommy because he would hate it
Not tubbo calling a Guinea pig a rabbit💀
yo after one year.
I thought it said "For 27 days, I was straight." 😭🖐
Bro called a Guinea Pig a Rabbit lol  (No hate just found it funny to me)
1:56 "people are dying, the fault is our own" (south park put it down refference)
Tubbo plays splatoon 3 ?
bro literally copied ludwig
I got sick and got to just watch the subathon for four days. :)
the first time I used twitch I watched the tubathon
Hi this is Jude axes are dangerous
Lets make this popular TUBBO Remember when you married Tommy?
Wow a life full of streaming must be real tough.
Me who was at school when the Sabaton ended, me now seeing the end, 👁👄👁
the pvz music he used for the video is so nostalgic
x = input() if x=Hi then print ("Hello!") else print ("no intro? rude.")
@PointCrow
cool music from plants vs zombie on start
"Streamed My Life" Which Life? 😂
Tubbo cuando volveras a cantar 😁

Fundy said you lost your hand

Get this man to 3mil
The end haha loved and you<3
Tubbo, we know your insane. Also what the fuc-
I remember being sick and so happy i couldn't go to school because I got to watch Tubbo sneak the stream onto the plane. I also loved falling alseep to late night mod chats, and then waking up at around the same time Tubbo would.
Whats the song at 11:18 ?
Still cant beat Point Crow though.
Oh boy was it a good 27 days
ur amazing!

okay but did he not shower in 27 days 💀 /j
If Tubbo wanted to copy Ludwig's idea I'm genuinely pissed
I was there... for the sleeping... for the second year in a row...
Your almost 3-m sub tubbo congrats
I didn't even watch the video and started liking and subscribing I am at the hospital center right now.
I don’t think it will be possible for anyone else to break 27 days of streaming so you did an amazing job Tubbo!❤
Can we be friends Tubbo? I've always wondered what it's like to be friends with a twitch streamer?
This was an awsome Tubabathon it was so much fun, the modcast was one of my favorite parts
Yo he actually made a video
Was the 640+ hours of editing worth it
Leave it up to Tubbo to go away for 2 years then post a video about him going live for 27 days straight
tubbathon
I do something like this every year because im insane, more like because i need money
Bro I’ve seen that fucking fortune teller machine before, its like 2 hours away from my house istg

hi tubbo
I WANT BENSON🐥🐥🐥💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛🖤🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜🧡🧡❤❤❤💌💯💯💯😍😍😍😍🤩😍
I remember i left the stream with like 8 minutes on the clock and came back a day later to 30+ hours.... multiple times.
Bro fit a whole month in 12 minutes
i'm never able to sit through a full stream but for some reason i made it my mission to watch as much of the subothon as possible and when it ended i actually cried
Good job!!!🎉🎉🎉
I genuinely want to know, did anyone stay for the whole 27 day period? Like did seriously anyone never miss like a single minute of the stream? I feel like someone would do that fr
Every Month of a Twitch Live Streamer hear me out
greg ruxton
"Oh hey ummm, it's been a while since my last upload."  Me - OH REALLY!?

I could never do that, I would just get bored and go do something else lol
TUBBO YOU NEED TO BECOME NEW SPIDERMAN
I honestly just loved waking up every day and seeing that he’s asleep with 5-10mins on the clock and like 5 hours later he woke up and it was at about 15-20mins almost every day ❤❤❤
Glad you found your password.
6:50 prince zam?
I remember the Tubbathan last year when Tubbo started sleep talking 😂
I was wondering what the timer was for lmao
I was there for most of the days of the tubbathon and it was so much fun, it's always one of the best times of the year when it happens:]
8:32 the GTA 5 Beach

Ay!, I was there for all of them.
I Subscribed to you what is your twich
Hiiiii
i would suffocate and die if i were him
Not even a month smh
;)
it was the perfect stream to promote tubnet                he played mcc instead
Tubbo: *Doing intro* Me: *FUCK YEAH PLANTS VS ZOMBIES MUSIC*
Holy moly I saw printzam!
Its amazing that it took him 1 year to remember his password what a great day
i was on the subathon  the whole time
NO DEMON IN MY HOUSE YT
You should really do this again, it was so fun to watch!
A video
Hi tubbo (please please reply to my message’)  Will you be my bff forever 😭👍🏻
All I gotta say is why
I remember when chat was like "YOU NEVER UPLOAD ON YT" and he was like _"IM WORKING ON MY SINGULAR VIDEO RIGHT NOW"_
Finally! Bro posted on his main after one year🎉
He’s back
Tubbathons will forever be my favorite streams
I remember Tommy posting about this
Very entertaining!
It’s a good year when Tubbo uploads
TUBBO FOUND THE UPLOAD BUTTON NO WAY
Petition for Tubbo to be the next Spider-Man in the movies:
hes gonna hit 3 mil
Me who was there for most of it💀 o7 to ykk kings who were there the whole time
Please post more on YouTube! Think of your monthly ad revenue!
He still knows the password to his YouTube? This is something new he has posted I thought he lost the password. I thought he would never come back
I remember falling asleep watching this subathon when I was supposed to be asleep and then I woke up the stream still streaming on my charging Nintendo and then when my mom came to wake me up she was so confused what the noise was and I was just leaning back on top of my Nintendo so she wouldn't see it or hear it as well, she wild me to put my head back on my bed but I said I was comfortable. I wasn't
Omg I remember on day to you we're sleeping and i was like what is going on and no one answered me
It’s been 1 year…                     He’s back y’all. It’s gonna be great.
This channel is like me and tubbo is like my dad, he only comes once in awhile
verified tubbo content
He forgot to mention that 1 minute that got it up like 50 hours. I wasn't there bc I was sleeping I think, but time had been more than tripled if you were to donate a certain amount, and my god it was insane. It got past 100 hours
I really thought he was going to put in the bit were chat got the timer up to 100 hours. That bit was really funny. :3 good vid.
This was amazing to watch over the few days I was able to watch. I apologize to the mods for the weird questions I ended up asking them. Yes, I was the person who asked them if they like Miraculous Ladybug and if they had seen S5 yet. I talked to them a couple times. This was just the best tho. Getting to talk with other chatters at times was amazing. Thank you tubbo for what I should say, 'babysitting' me without even realizing. Thank you Tubbo!
I thought you quit Yt😅
Which is insane if you asked me.
I love the PvZ theme in the background....🤣❤
It looks like Tubbo just got out of bed in every stream and video he makes, and I absolutely love it. Pop off king!
GET THIS MAN TO 3M RIGHT NOW
If the stream whent on for 2 more days it would of been a world record, Amazing none the less.
i’m so glad i was in the chat for that whole 27 days thank you for doing the subathon and making my that 27 days amazing love you tubbo <3 (i was shitting when it ended 😭)
That was a mistake.  - Thanos
I had the best month, was sooo much fun tubbs
can't believe Tubbo learned how to log into YouTube, this is revolutionary.
imagine playing Minecraft for this long...
HE HAS A RISEN FROM THE DEAD (but seriously though he legitimately put so much effort for him can we get a pog for him??)
is it bad that i forgot tubbo had a YouTube channel
2024 Tubbo-athon will be even Longer!
yayyyy our yearly upload 😍
missed u tubs
5:03 you inspired me to paint, almost nobody can inspire or give me ideas for any kind of art,I’m happy to be painting again✌️
its always a great year when Tubbo uploads
My phone is always on do not disturb so I didn’t know it exitsted till like day 12 and loved it and watched it every day from when I wake up to when I feel asleep and it worked because i don’t go to bed till like 3 and your 4 hours ahead of me and you would sleep about 4-7 my time if I’m remembering correctly.  What really sold me on it was when there was 7 minutes left and we all thought it would end then the hour ended with 30 hours on day 19 I believe so you could imagine your disappointment when I came home from school and the sunbathon ended
This is what you upload? It’s good, but why can’t you do more?
watching the tubbathon really helped remind me that i am a person and that the world keeps turning and there is life outside my everyday routine which felt AMAZING like i could just hop on stream and see what a real breathing human being was doing halfway across the world it was extremely grounding
This was the best thing to watch live lol 😂
Tubbo is indeed awesome! <3
I like your playlist
3millonth  subbbbb🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I WAS IN THE STREAM WHEN TUBBO SHOWED THE THUMNAIL
It's been a year, but Tubbo has returned to his main channel. GOD SAVE THE KING.
When us chatters didn't think we would make it to mcc, but then end up making it to a week later
When we needed him the most,he came back
I'm not proud of the amount of hours I watched live
YAYAYAYAYYAAYY THE TUBBO VIDEO this was insane
tbh i find subathons a bit creepy almost. like i could understand u gettin a load of views while ur asleep, if they're chatting, hanging etc.... but when u wake up and have way more subs and follows.... like what? is u sleeping rly just the best content on twitch? idk. huge respect to u tho for your commitment as a content creator, earned a long-time-coming sub from me :)  also i love how ur hair gets progressively more crazy as it goes on, i can empathize
When he finally posts ❤
this is my favourite of your videos
the tubman has posteddddd :D                finally.......
seeing my name pop up in chat is the best
Hey Tubbo
not the plants vd. zombies music in the start
Love the editing
FINALLY HES BACK ON YT
I can't believe i missed ALL OF THIS D:<
tubbo finally remembered his password
"clear their schedule for an extended period of time" tubbo:(clears schedule and fills it with stuff)
forgot you had yt
I remember when it kept on getting to less then a minute and chat kept it up, they were dedicated lmao.
I remember there was a part of the tubbathon during the final days where someone said they would smash chaz lmao
TUBBOOOO WE MISSED YOU IM GLAD YOUR BACK! BEEN ENNOYING THE STREAMS :]
Bro set up all these mod cast features and all that stream obs shenanigans so at the end he does absolutely nothing, like not even music or confetti, nothing bro
Hi tubbo remember when you married tommy
Bro made a 10 minute vid out of 27 days 😂
calling the female reporter dude and man
Ok that's it. I'm blowing up this entire planet if Tubbo doesn't win best Minecraft streamer next streamer awards.

I can just imagine how salty Jack was when you killed him in MCC
I THOUGHT U DIED ON THIS CHANNEL, DONT LEAVE US TUBBO

I remember how I would wake up everyday and check the timer and I would update my family on it and my mother was so shocked + the amount of times the timer nearly ended but went back up
Yess! You're back :D
Tubo
I saw some of these moments live
I would really be interested in a video about your experience with TubbNet!
He had tricks up his sleeve. In a shirt with no sleeves. Respect+

TUBBO's SUBATHON  in a NUTSHELL!!

Tubbo is the type of person to look at his password and ask "Is anyone gonna eat that?" and not wait for an answer

You made so much money you could get people to actually edit your video
Nearly a year and a half tubbo
loved the subbathon pal!
I am a new subscriber and love your story! You have got to be so proud and you have your sights on bigger and better, way to go! I live all the way in Florida by Disney World and love watching all your videos and the fun you and your friends all have. Thank you for being awesome!
I was there for all of it and it was so much fun! You are one of the hardest working streamers around and this video came out fantastic. Well done King!
I am happy you comed back
I loved it, can't really sub on twitch BCS i have no money on my card but your so good
After a year, our king has finally decided not to leave us in the dark
bro has 2.99M SUBS right now lol. it would change soon
i’ve never clicked a video this fast
Tubbathon
Tubbo.... posted a video? 😯
Hello king
I love how we were predicting that the days will double every year 😭✨
Am I the only one who recognises the back ground voices????? I heard Ranboo and  more creators, like George, when watching the candy apple bit.
See You After A Year🎉
It was truly a great journey. I'll come back in a year for the next video :D
GREAT RECAP BRO! After a year,  Tubbo returned!!!!
Tubbo, I watched and liked it, like you said to do :)
This video makes me want to work hard for being a streamer
What was the cooking show?
Finally, Tubbo has returned home with the milk. The milk of content.
GREAT RECAP BRO! The subathon was actually so fun to watch/be a part of, cannot believe how much content you fit into just 27 days lmao. Welcome back to youtube!
I was there😊❤ and here
WE ALL NEEDED THIS VIDEO BRO
YOOOO HES ALIVE
U know its a good day when tubbo uploads
MONTHS LATER AND WE GET A VIDEO WOO !
wait was that prince zam with you ?
6:27 fligth
He's alive 😆finally he aploaded
The last interaction of ranboo and tubbo was tubbo killing ranboo in Mcc
I watched Tubbo for 27 days straight
Tubbothon was so fun, I can’t wait for the next one
Those days were just insane!  waking up? watching tubbo. getting ready? watching tubbo. in school? watching tubbo. at home? watching tubbo. eating? watching tubbo. falling asleep? watching tubbo.  I watched almost every minute, it was amazing!!!
NO WAY U WENT ROCK CLIMBING AT MY OLD SCHOOL HELL NAW 😂
You did amazing
The YouTube fans probably thought you quit
"I slept for 14 hours...." Sounds like my normal life on holidays
Did anyone notice the "Plants vs Zombies" song in the background? 😶 In the beginning of the video?😶🤌🏻 That was one of my favorite games before 🥲🤌🏻 Now it's Genshin Impact 😅
fly high tubbo! This video is our last memory of him! I cant believe hes gone </3
Tubbo is the type of person to look at 27 days and ask is anyone gonna stream that? and not wait for an answer
I forgot how long it’s been since you’ve uploaded lol
FINALLY A YEAR LATER HE HAS DONE IT
I saw the 27 day stream on Twitch, I enjoyed every bit of it, glad to see you come back on Youtube, Tubbo. Congrats on your 27 day stream
I'm surprised tubbo remembered he had a yt account
Yeyy he's back❤🎉
the subathon got me from 80k points all th way to 160k
i had the most amazing time watching the subbathon. Also Micheal called me fake gay for being math, thought i would mention that
When the world needed him most... he came back
I loved it!
Its been so long since you last uploaded that when i finally got am account meaning i can finally sub to people on yt it means that i was not actually subbed (i am now though!)
I'm so grateful that he remembered his password
Truly an interesting journey, loved watching it!
I love the editing of this video. The Tubathon was so much fun!
This video was made purely to make people without Twitch feel bad
He returns after a year off YouTube! Welcome back
"We Despacito" Georgenotfound - 2022
Ah, this subathon has so many memories! It was honestly a great way to break up my day during one of the busiest months of my LIFE! What a vibe.
I loved watching the Tubbathon live, and this video was so well edited to encapsulate the vibe of the live experience, amazing video Tubbo!
When everyone was worried and hopeless after 1 year... He showed up! He is one of the best streamers ever NGL. But everyone I think that Tubbo did great for that long. Love ya Tubbs!
I’m so proud of you tubbo

it was such a good month, and i'm so glad i spent 581h watching the stream non stop xD
i really loved waking up each morning and checking the timer before uni lectures, and then spending the evenings chilling w chat and whatever game tubbo was playing. the modcast had the best vibes, and watching chat keep the timer so close to zero for so long was hilarious! was a v cool and wholesome 27 days. thank you king!!!
