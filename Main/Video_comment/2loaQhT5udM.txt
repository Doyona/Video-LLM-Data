“You sussy sussy Devs”  -Nano 2022
This Shi was so hypeee
Insane to think it’s already been 3 years since their release.
whose here after they released agl ssj4 gogeta with the best animations we've ever seen
Even in 2025 SSJ4 gogeta still has the best animation in the game
Just imagine, this could've been the legend's 7th anni...
Here in 2025 and lowkey these animations are better than recent releases 😂
This video got recommended to me in april 2025 and my dumbass thought ts was for golden week  💀💀💀💀
LETS GO CAN’T WAIT FOR THEM TO RELEASE
peak dokkan
The kings are back on their rightful thrones and we could not be more happier. 😭
One of the all time best Ani's in Dokkan history. Glad they are back on top with the new eza's.
It’s time
I can't believe they're finally gonna eza 🥹🥹
Whos back here after reading the details of their eza...LESS FUCKING GOO THEY ARE BACKKKK
Who's here waiting for the EZA details?
Can't believe they're EZA ing this week 🔥🔥🔥good times. please god let them be the kings of dokkan again
Work 100%
Congrats on the 1mil view on this goated ani reaction and the best ani in my opinion
LETS GOOOO NANO IM SO HYPED FOR THE REST OF THE 10 YEAR CELEBRATION 🎉😊😊😊
This video will never be beaten, best part 1 anni LRS double gogeta is unbeatable 🔥🔥
The fact that this was3 years ago is insane
One of the greatest nano moments in history, literally shedding happy tears from my eyes. Leave it to Nano to brighten your day with excitement and good vibes.
Can't wait for this vid in a few days 😊
3 years later they still give me chills
W 1 mil views to one of the hypest releases in dokkan
Here before they EZA 🎉🎉🎉
Don't mind me. Just here rewatching this fifteen times to get pumped for the EZA's and re-emergance OF PEAK DOKKAN
I need these EZAs now. Can't believe it's about to be 3 years since they came out.
Crazy to think theyre gonna eza this time next month
It's so funny seeing nano's mind blown in real time at the ssj4 gogeta active
God I can’t wait for these units to EZA
This is db legends 6th anniversary except gogeta blue has fusion mechanic and ssj4 gogeta has the fusion intro. Then they also added super vegito with potato fusion mechanic.
Who's here in 2024 in anticipation of the greatest EZAs that are gonna release in January 🔥🔥🔥
No Idea why the F I was recommended this video even though I watched it when it was posted 2+ years ago, but hey. Imma watch it again :)))
In 4 months we will be enjoying their EZAs. Time flies doesn't it
The ssj4s are still one of my favorites
1 MILLION VIEWS
11:47 NEURON ACTIVATION
5th……, 6th, 7th, 9th, ALL PEAK
111 MORE VIEWS UNTIL 1M
This was still, Peak Dokkan imo. As much hype as the 9th anni was/will be, nothing has top the 7th
we need to get this to 1m views
日本のゲームでこんなに喜んでいるのを見ると自分が開発したわけではないけど凄く嬉しく感じる。この反応は何回でも見れる
Me coming back to this video wondering how they'll handle their eza's next year after the monsters that are the 6th year ezas
Still my fav unit that SS4 Gogeta ost always hype me
Peak Dokkan
I want find Goku and Vegeta 4 LR🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I always come back to this video every once in a while to relive the absolute hype that was Year 7
I feel like the ssj4s fusing into gogeta theme is the best theme for gogeta, at least in this game
after rewatching this, nano definitely got erect at 10:01 lol
The SSJ 4 intro fits so well considering how dark the show was, and shows powerful their forms are. And god damn the ost intro is sooo good.
未だにこれを超える衝撃、感動は存在しない
i just got this UNIT from zamasu banner damn the animations look good :D
7th anniversary still has the best animations in dokkan.
After a year I keep returning to see this card from the 7th anniversary
For the next gogeta we need the budokai 3 animation big bang kamehameha
i come back here evEry now again just for the hype bro. ITS SO GOOD!!!
As someone who just started Dokkan 5 days ago, I’m hyped for SSJ4 Gogeta to come back around. I want him so bad.
i like how funny it is when goku and vegeta ssjb use active and fuse when they are about to start attacking someone just dodge it and they unfuse
Still the best.
11:15
I love how the ssj4 gogeta animations are based on dbfz
Dokkan peaked here, we´re only going to see something more hype than that if the anime returns.
What the crap
Booooooooooooooooy what do you mean
And the intro
active skills are the best
Dokkan!
Dokkan battle!
What the crap
Wwwwwwwwwwwwwhhhaaaaaaaatttt 🎉 that's awesome
Hands down the best part of this video was when the Devs let Gogeta EAT BRUHHHH mans was speechless😂
Were intros never a thing before this?
I m crying
One day away from a year from this video
Not me rewatching all ur anni vids until 8th anni
me watching this a week before the 8th anniversarry be like:
Idk how it's almost already been a year since these units released
crazy how this was a year ago
W nano
Coming back to watch these reactions a year later..man we gonna cook for 8 year
bro i am seehimg this vid 1 million times u love you raction
I gotta get back here again after 10 months to see this reaction it gives me goosebumps everytime, damn never get tired of it.
11:57 you know that's from the anime right
No way this 765k damn
ssj4 gogeta's active gave me chills
Super late but I found all the references and will list them down:  Starting with LR Gods  1. Their entrance animation is very much based on when Goku is about to fight Broly, but Vegeta chiming in. And their transformation into Super Saiyan God is right out the movie.  2. Their 12ki starts with when they feel the breeze generated from Broly and they charge forward. Vegeta does his ki blast he does in Super Saiyan when Broly starts to adapt to his power. Goku comes in and does a few punches into a forward body slam, courtesy of Broly breaking out his God Bind.  3. Their 18ki has Goku dodge/slam the opponent into the ground just like in the movie, but their combined beam attacks are actually ripped from the DBZ Game, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, in the first DLC.  4. Their blue transformation is literally right from the movie, save for Vegeta.  5. Their 12 ki is a combo into Goku's Super God Bash.  6. Their 18 ki is also ripped from the movie, from start to finish.  7. Active Skill is Self explanatory.   LR Monkes Entrance: Vegeta had finally gone Super Saiyan 4 and joins Goku in his battle against Omega Shenron.  12 ki: Afterimages they use to attempt to trip up Omega and try to use Fusion, but instead their use their respective Beam Attacks. (Fun Fact: Vegeta never actually uses Final Flash in Super Saiyan 4 in the anime)  18 ki: Vegeta does a Ki blast smokescreen? Goku does his iconic headbutt and Vegeta uses Final Shine Attack. Goku uses his Dragon Fist (used against Eis Shenron).  Fusion is self explanatory, except they aren't interrupted like normal.  LR Monke Gogeta 12: only reference is the clones. Instead of party poppers shooting out confetti, Kamehamehas come out their hands.  18 ki: Literally uses Gogeta's backflip kick from FighterZ into his Ultimate from DB Legends. (Minus the elbow to the face)  Active Skill is mostly unique, but the ending explosion is from his FighterZ Dramatic Finish against himself in Super Saiyan Blue, when they clash with their Kamehamehas and it ruptures the Sun.
You have the best reaction to🔥 Keep on going What you doin Nano💪
Gods eating good rn  Monke down bad  🗿
Its been a while since I'd managed to roll PHY LR Gogeta and every single time he whips out the Active Skill, its just victory. Its just victory.
ULTRA BIG BANG KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAA
Team SSJ4's!  GOGETA SS4 CRAZY.  ~  Not gonna say it huh Nano?  Maybe you the Sussy one.  ~~  In my opinion Gogeta has the better SA's.  SS4 specifically.  Truth MESSAGED YOU?  ~~~  I've liked the vid already.  ~~~~  THE GREATEST!
Marketing Department: Okay Devs, anniversary is coiming up so you gotta release some bomb ass units. So which side of the fandom are you guys gonna lean towards this time? Goku fans, Vegeta fans, SSG fans, SSB fans, SS4 fans, or Fusion fans?  Dokkan Devs: ....yes
My favorite reaction video
“I’m sorry is this Dokkan Battle?”
If u do 10 sec from 11:54 back to back it’s funni
To think i was so desperate for both LRs i lost count of how much summons i did. The 1st wave of summons was outstanding whit back-to-back LRs of STR Goku & Vegeta (angel), STR SSJ4 Vegeta, INT Goku & Vegeta, and 2 AGL full power Frieza. The 2nd wave (in tickets) was something similar, like fully rainbow Frieza, INT SSJ Goku x2, PHY SSJ Goku (angel) & Vegeta (angel) and AGL SSJ 4 Goku... But not the featured ones yet. So i was doing EZA battles like crazy to farm dragon stones just for a chance, and so TEQ SSG Goku & Vegeta arrives, whit the new DBS Broly in the same multi. And so, before the ticket promotion ends i'll go all out for PHY SSJ 4 Goku & Vegeta. I was about to give up when in the last summon Whis & Berus pop up in my screen before release and i said loudly "I F@#$&ING DID IT!!!" i coudn't get Sin Shenron but the fact that a f2p like me get not only the 7th anniversary, but also the 6th anniversary units (yes i got them as well) was the craziest week since i started play dokkan
I always like to think what do nanos neighbors thing of him lol when he screams 😂 much love nano!
Phy ssj4 Gogeta is the whole reason why I’m back. Favorite character of all DBZ. When I first heard Gogeta active skill ost, I just knew I had to comeback to this incredible game
11:24 without a doubt the most hype "lets go" ive ever heard
This is so late but revisiting this video. I love the Gogeta 4's active skill. I love how it shows Goku and Vegeta combining. You legit can see both Goku and Vegeta in their fusion.
Bruh SSJ4 Gogetas Active literally felt like I got blasted into the next universe over
team super saiyan 4 maaaaaaan
Gogeta 4s super attack evasion animation is my favorite tho
Am I the only one who noticed that they didn't add the red pigment around Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta's eyes
Back to this after summoning on 7th anni glb Bro that goku warm up fire
moment of silence for the saibamen that were killed in the clips.
4:30 C O O M ? NANO U NAUGHTY BOY
Gogeta 4 the best animations
the theme in the ssg event caught me so off guard
Overreacting
Anyone else coming every day since countdown to get unbelievably hyped?
i really dislike GT but im going for gogeta ssj4 in this anniversary
DOKKAN IS KING AGAIN!! #No.1H3@dB@nd
Here 3 days before the global anniversary begins, just waiting and building hype
11:45 nano processing the overwhelming hype
7 dragon ball years, 7 anniversary, Dokkan has come a long way
Dokkan:giving bangers after bangers every anniversary..... Me to legends:Cmon......do something
Anyone see that SSJ4 Gogeta did his auto combo from fighterZ too
Does anyone know when these guys will return on a banner???
waiting for these on global rn, they still make me cry
I can't imagine being the dev team and having people react to your work like this. They work so hard to put out the best content for us and I hope they know how much we love the game
we always get a vegeta ass shot cause he has the best ass in the show obviously lol.
I know it’s all opinions but I can’t believe that you think that trashy ass SSB’s 12 Ki looks better than SSJ4 Gogeta’s 12 Ki
P
For SSJ4 Gogeta's active when he splits they should have had Goku be blue and vegeta be red when they combine they should be purple and they go back to Gogeta
SSJ 4 bro
So are just gonna ignore Vegeta blue's break dancing
it’s tradition to come back to this video
Too bad he never has reactions like this when stuff comes to global lmao
Can't wait for global realese!
i want both but ssgs more
Wish you all luck on global summons! It's time!
This just makes me more hype for July anni on global HYPE
Every time the anniversary comes around for global I always watch nanos reaction video to the unit and pretend that we are reacting to it coming to global already :)
What if they do this for a new Broly
Fun fact the ssg duo active is from fighterz. Well the voicing is at least
want this on global NOW
These animations are top tier. Idk, I don’t think any animation can top lr blue gogeta active skill and 18 ki. Still legendary.
we know where all the budget went to ------> GT
10:37 "So.. all I have to do to shoot super powerful blue laser beams out of my hands is go 'Aghaghaghaghagha'?"
I can't wait for this on the english version, I've been craving a ssj4 gogeta LR
Gotta come back to this every so often, it just makes me so happy
Subtitles: ”You sassy saucy devs”
７周年は強すぎたんだ こっからどんどんインフレが加速 していく…
now i wish i been saving stones i want both these units for main team
I think... for the first time... I do not know which of the anniversary units I want to go for :O
7th Year Anniversary.   .   .
I absolutely love the minimalist artstyle of DBS:Broly.
bubble popping game btw.
I want them on global so bad …
Nano nutted and i cant blame him we all did.
Only thing that’s sucks is that 4gogeta’s fusion animation looks goofy, especially since the amazing blue gogeta one is right there
Half a mil 💀 ☠ 💀
let go build hype
I'm so lucky I got both of them rainbow without having to spend money
I only aim to the screaming epic
team monekey for life
SSJ4 Gogeta's Ultra Big Bang Kamehameha OST and it's animation is ON POINT!
I swear this is the 5th youtube recommend me this and my 6th time watching it and idk why
Year 7 = Gogetas are seen Year 8 = Could we possibly see potaras
WHAT ARE THESE OST'S
Here again after 2 months because I’m on global and I NEED these units now
chill get me chill
I think this goku and vegeta lrs havent come to global i guess i have got the free lr goku and vegeta jr
Bro the ssg active looks awful lol considering how clean goku’s transformation into ssb looked in the movie you’d think they would keep the same energy they had for their SA’s but nope, looks like it was from year 5 😂
im team super gods i like them more in my opinion i like blue gogeta more than ssj4 gogeta
Guys who looks better Goku and Vegeta or Goku and Vegeta?
Dokkan in 9th anniversary double vegito
I don’t want to sound like douche but i feel like some of his reactions are not genuine
日本語での演出でも伝わるこのかっこよさは海外の方も一緒だったんだなぁ
Whens globals?!?!?
Gotta love how they have their own distinctive art styles   The SSJ4’s are done in the GT art style (albeit updated to look better with current Dokkan graphics and standards), which obviously suits them best.  And the God Bois are done in the DBS Broly Movie art style.   They could’ve just done both in the generic Dokkan art style, but they went the extra mile and did them properly.
I will use my 2000 stones to pull these both, hopefully will rainbow them
best reaction vid still, lets go yr 8!
Fuc* I miss this event Damm it
Team Gods
I can’t keep doing this my wallets going to run out man I all I want right now is a LR broly that can be in base form then transform to SSJ and Full power SSJ
Now all I can think of is lr god gogeta and Vegito into blue gogeta and Vegito (I know these units will never come to Dokkan)
i dont play this on jp just global atm at almost 1k stones within a month been buying sells like crazy cant wait for july! i understand how nano feels to these animations.
That poor saibaman😂😂
なんか嬉しい
Who's best goku and vegeta ssj4 lr or goku ultra instinct lr 🤔🤔🤔🤔???????
Respect to you!!! You desperately need Promo`SM!
Why was his reaction seeming so fake
Nanos Reactions be like: during the animation: 🤯😱🔥 OH MY GOOOOOD🤯🤯🔥, THEY ACTUALLY DID, YEEEEESSSSSS  After the animation: very interesting 😐
Bro im team blue nothing against ssj4 but the broly movie had me hype and out of my chair that shit looks amazing
So the Super duo starts with God and become Blue, then can become Gogeta for their Active Skill and turn back, while the 4s turn into Gogeta and stay that way for the duration of the battle. Did I get that right?
Ssjg
OK... I goddamn hope the units come to global because I'm gonna be saving the stones for em
You can't hear pictures or muted videos: Me:* hears Nano screaming, even if it's muted
11:45 I love that one
Hey nano what if they make LR revival super Saiyen bardock for the son family
OH HELL YEAH I ENJOYED THAT,  what has become of Dokkan
"Im not ready for these - have you liked the video yet? Have you liked and subscribed and all that good stuff?"
Feels bad to be global man :(
I come here daily just to see the views keeping going up by around 1,000 a day. Hoping for the 400k eventually 👊
このクオリティはこんなリアクションになる笑
Totally going to pull for the ssj4s on global those animations are WAY too fuckin clean!!!!
“That was clic-clickl- that click- that kick was clean”   - Inspirational quotes by Nano 2022
ここまでドラゴンボールで喜んでるとこっちまで嬉しくなる
Weeeeeee
I refuse to spend a single dragon stone until this comes to global in about half a year.
こいつうるさ
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxVPakMpe_W8GZbuZc3X9PPPrtq0E_B9Ak  How SSJ4 Gogeta fans reacted when he was revealed. Got Goosebumps from this moment.
Is it normal to watch this reaction  so many times?
Bro this just makes me wonder how godly the 8 year anni units are gonna look
How did they transform mid battle like that? How do you even do that.
なんか嬉しい
And this Sir is why Gogeta is better than Vegito XD
These animations are dope! Nano's new "Are you serious?" reactions are annoying. What happened guy
Yes those osts 🤯
So when are these coming out in NA
最高だぜベジータ！！ 本当に最高だよ泣くよ？俺😭
I understand how hype this is but being that dramatic is annoying with that yelling
imma just start saving now
Ok these are better than dbl i swear
Yo the end of the God Duo's 18Ki is a reference to the last attacks they use against Beerus in Kakarot DLC 1 Story
This gonna be in global or no?
I'm going to shoot for the blue bros... Seriously love the blue gogeta more than GT but GT one is still fire 🔥
こんなに驚かれんの日本人からしたらすっげぇ嬉しい ドッカンバトル凄いわww
I like goku and Vegeta's over goku and Vegeta's
They had me at that LR Gogeta SSJ4 12ki, I paused the video I was like "OOOOOOO WTF THAT SO FIRE." I'm super hyped now.
DOOOOKKKKAAAANNNNN!!!!!!
This is the hardest decision of all time…  Do i choose the gods with GREAT OSTS?!? AND  THE 360 CRAZY SHENANIGANS?!?  Or the SSJ4 Goku and Vegeta with mediocre animations then it becomes the best CRAP IVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE?!? WHAT DO I CHOOSE?!?!?!??
プレイ画面が小さい
I love your reaction hahaha I can feel how much you love Dragonball lol
10:09 it’s so satisfying when Gogeta says this
反応が万国共通でうれしいｗ
It Sucks That they used animations from Dragonball Fighters und from the Movie. at some Point they will Use only references… BUT the animations are NICE
2:30 parallax
Does anyone know the ost that’s playing during the super attacks?
13 minutes of pure cringe fake reactions - nearly killed myself watching this shit
Was never a dokkan battle guy but wow this is crazy
My fusion team is already full of gogeta 😭
perfection.
Very nice to fuse with Gogeta Blue and Gogeta 4 is too good
Damn this is spicy.
Lr ssj4 gogeta gibe me goosebumps 😨
Aye nah I wonder how insane the 14 year anniversary is gonna look in the future 😳
日本の作品でここまで喜んでもらえて、嬉しくなっちゃう
I'm Japanese. I'm not good at English so I don't know what he's saying,his reaction is  fun to watch.
Is it me or did anyone else noticed on 5:09 goku is looking up doing a Kamehameha, but 2 secs afterwards it hits straight down,? Like if he was in the sky doing it, but you can clearly see he is on the ground. This a mistake or intended?
Ssj4 is just way cooler than blue
We finally got lr ssj4 gogeta but no lr buu 😔
Hell yes those look amazing. SSGB All day
Summoned for both got both downloaded jp just Bc of the monkey that got his LR finally
when they showed the scene fron fighters z and the level 7 bar big bang kamehameha it got me hyped same with gogeta blue
The SSJ4s.... Thats what my eyes are on!
Dokkan really just stealing animations from fighterz 🤦‍♂️
Im not spending a single stone until these hit global. Im at 300 currently. Lets hope i can get both 😭
vegito in the back: i-i'm also c..cool
Well... time to download again.
This is making me mad that I stopped playing Dokkan 6 months ago
When they will come ??
TEAM SSJ4
Really tough so much good beautiful hell damn. First time never before this like beautiful so much
めちゃくちゃ嬉しいし見てるこっちが楽しくなる！
schauspieler der typ kriegst ein daumen aber nach unten men freund
Been saving my festival coin for LR gogeta blue, then suddenly they introduce another gogeta with epic BGM.. And now this?
It's not in summons rn am i right?
Just realized goku and vegeta could split into multiple copies and just win all fights
Yo did they improve the sprites? I feel like they did and it makes these look better, which is an understatement these are epic
“I don’t even want to know what gogeta’s looks like”  *Video outro plays*
Him saying “let’s goooo” with the OST was super hype
The SSJ4 Gogeta active skill may be better than STR Gogeta Blue. I have strong bias towards Gogeta blue, bc I have him rainbowed.
DUDE GOGETA HAS INSANE ANIMATION…. DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE SSJB UNIT
18 ki for the blue bois is just the greatest high for me ssj4 guys are good but that rush attacks is just extreme
When is the 7th anni celebration coming to global?
I will be spending an unholy amount on this
I NEED these characters but me when i got no luck
Db legends better xd
HOW DO I GET THEM
I have to admit, the ssj blue units lose some hype when you realize that they are running away from a saibamen in their 18 ki
Didn't even get Janemba, I know for sure I'm not pulling any of them
That moment when a mobile game has better animation than the entire dragon ball super anime
wgy is such a big difference i nquality betwen ssj4 and gods ? i dont get it...... whyyyy
I haven’t even got the teq gogeta yet smh We all know you’re gonna pull these when they come out Nano😂
BEAUTIFUL that’s all I can say.
They are gonna have to throw in some 3D when these next anniversaries hit bc WHOO BOY BRUH HOW DO THEY KEEP DOING IT?! LEGIT SPEECHLESS I MIGHT HAVE TO BECOME PAY TO WIN AFTER BEING FOR 7 YEARS FREE TO PLAY GODDAMN :O
you`re awesome nano, men i can`t wait till the 7th. btw your facial expressions are priceless haha
I had 500 stones on JP and sum told me not to summon and I did and used em… and now I see this, I’m in extreme pain rn
I want both, but I gotta say gokus dragon fist really sold me for the ssj4s, sucks I gotta wait for July but that’s means I can save all my stones for that
Ima summon for gogeta lol
Dokkan battle>dragon ball legends
0:00
I can hear my bank account crying now
I'm coming back to dokkan for this card specifically
Those animations are fucking BOMB! hope i get one copy of each of those 2 units
Goku's face low key looks like a potato before the go get a fusion
At this point the 8th year animations might as well be clips from the actual fight in the show
I saved 1k stones
Kid: I wanna watch gt and dbs broly  Mom: we have a gt and dbs broly at home What we actually have:
I love the FighterZ inspired parts of SSJ4 Gogeta
That SS4 Gogeta's active skill has literally the best Bigbang Kamehameha I've ever seen.
I’ve had a gogeta team for a bit now, I’ve haven’t gotten the less new tech gogeta yet(sad). If I don’t get at least one of these new gogetas I’m going to cry
Well mom I’m sorry but your gonna loose about 100$  this year 🌚🌚🌚🌚
11:53 that kamehameha scream was the cherry on top for me.
ssj4 gogeta...is going to be top1 unit for sure LOL.. and again ssj4 > blue .... always favorite by bandai both animation is from anime, and yet... the GT sure is updated animation, and tbh a little disappointed with gogeta blue
You gotta watch gt to know why gogeta ssj4 splits
A moment of silence for the poor saibamen
I didn't know the gods fused on this unit
Gogeata not an actual unit that blows
I like the ssj4 transformations better tbh They bring out slot if references and unique stuff to see on the table with each new unit, with the god unit tho I like how they did the ssg units up until blue But tbh, I wasn't too Impressed with gogeta blue It's was mainly some reused stuff, Which I don't have any hate against and yea I Kno it's mainly from what the movie had but still I just think they're just milking the train with him tbh. I think they mainly should've went all out with ssj4 and yea I guess it's a bias opinion but ik some ppl would agree.
I’m going ss4 when they come to global. Fuck SSJG and ssj blue when ssj4 looks so much better
Im coming back lol
Vegeto fans crying
18 ki on the blues is kind of weak imo
What I love the most is the super attack counter from ssj4 gogeta, its just the best😂
Rhyme missing out
09:10 aww hell nawww 😭😭😭 why did they make Vegeta shorter
I stopped playing long ago but looking awesome
both gogetas are absolutely godly
And my friend thinks this game is bad SMH
i love both units but ssj4 gogeta just has something special (even tho i didnd't watch gt), the animations are so much cooler in my oppinion and i fancy that dmg reduction on rainbow ki sphere's more than the dodge
I know what I'm saving for now
SS4
I've always been team SSJ4 and back when Year 5 dropped. I predicted units like these, and Gee Zus!
Bro whats the ssb gogeta 18 ki ? That cant be it
Wow
gonna have to come back to this everytime I want to summon on glb.
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
I’m def going for both no matter what. When do they drop?

Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
My legs are hurting from nu-
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I've been watching different reactions to these supers, and I still haven't seen anyone acknowledge that the Super Saiyan God 18ki uses the DBZ Kakarot Beerus finishers.
These animations literally want you to take off x2 speed.
GOGETA HAS THE BEST ANIMATIONS BRO!!! AND THE OST MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE!! I'M SO HYPED!
That SSJ4 Gogeta active ultimate attack is the first one I have seen thus far that has gave my body chills. That-is-good-shit my boys
Holly fuck that ssj4 gogeta Big Bang kamehameha x100 is so cleannnnnn
Me who doesnt play dokkan:That looks like it did alot of damage
Gogeta Superamacy Boyz ❤️.
Can't wait for Vegito's remake if they get us a new one that is but it's likely we will be getting one because they've already given us Gogeta
2:30 The animation style you're talking about is 2D-traced 3D animation. So, if I were to animate a scene in 3D, then draw over that scene, I'd get the affect you're speaking of. Also, these units are so damn good. Finally an LR SSJ4 Gogeta, and finally they've included the Dragon Fist Goku used against Eis Shenron like I've been begging. Gonna have to pull the whale card when it comes to glb, because no way am I settling for anything under 79% for both of these units.
Im sorry but these animations just game me the chills and some stuff in my pants.
Dokken battle is garbage. Multiple years with no update to the story. Bunch of greedy fucks who only care about people spending money on the same characters. Haven't touched the shit game in months.
I remind you that they can do sa more than 1 time. This looks like one in a year. How all this possibly can't destroy a enemy in one sa?
This is on trending holy cow
What did truth message him?
How about a dokkanfest base vegeta that transforms into Super Saiyan, One of my favorite Transformations from all of dbs
Wow I havent played in over a year but after seeing those I might have to come back lol
Your on trending lets go!!!
Bro this shit is trending congrats bro
We’re on trending bois, this is ABSOLUTELY the most hype celebration on Dokkan ever.

Good morning everyone 🙇 Today I share you a nice Japanese song, the melody and vocals allow you to enjoy the song, but there are also translations available in comments Originally this song is intended to thank the person/persons who support you all the time Acid Black Cherry  Kimi ga iru kara "Because of you". Cover https://youtu.be/Du4XAs3KwxM
Omfg these OST's combined with the animations give me the heaviest chills ever, this is just crazy
HOLY CRAP!
Devs letting Vegeta stay all cheeked up on a thursday afternoon
BLUFF KAMEHAMEHA FINALLY
THE GT's are HYPE AF
The technology/techniques in the SSB animations is insane. It looks like they actually put CGI in the SA But I can't deny how fucking good the SSJ4 GOGETA ACTIVE IS
Dokkan. Take my money.
IM NOT SPENDING A SINGLE STONE U TIL THIS COMES OUT ON GLOBAL
EVERYONE IS LIKE "WAH ANIMATION TRASH THIS ONE SUCKS OTHER IS BETTER" they are both awesome and we got Vegeta Booty so that's a Plus for the Anniversary in my Book so I know what I'm pulling for
That grafic is like the broly movie maybe dokkan is paying who make the caracter
Hands down blue goku n vegeta have the best 18 key idc
10 out of 10! Best game! Best game!
When do this come out so i can re download it and waste my time again?
What are these units?!?!?! I need these in my life
ok dokkan took me down with this update
Saving my stone
For global
Thats it saving my stone
I never get anywhere near as hyped as Nano when I see new unit animations... These left me stunned... While I was watching I kept thinking... "Oh boy, I can't wait to see Nano's reactions" lmao.
nano exploded when gogeta ssj4 did his active talk about timing😂😂😂
Wow. That's all I have to say.
Bro… they have like 3 OSTs each almost this is INSANE
Sometimes I wish I was a JP main but im not
Bruhhhhhhh...... 7th Anniversary making me wanna unretire now😂😂. I was a OG player, but I stopped around 5th Anniversary. Got scammed selling my account. But GOD DAYUM! Them animations, Gogeta Blue Active is literally the movie scene lmao that shit too cleeeaaannn😭😭
Poor vegito
global player crying rn including me
BROOOOO
The SSB Goku and Vegeta 18 ki literally looks better than the movie it's insane.
Team monke ofc
#43 TRENDING ON GAMING LETTSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOO NANO‼️‼️‼️🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾 NOTHING BUT HEAT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ssj4 all the way
I think if they had the UI fake out for Goku at 9:00 the active skill would have been 100x times better. Active skill is still amazing regardless.
I'm worried how there gana do the 8 year anniversary now that there is no 8th dragon ball unless there just gana get two 4 star dragon balls or something
Omg I have never had my mouth dropped open for so long in a video lol. These are literally THE BEST animations ever created🤧.
Nano's reaction doesn't get old!!! It is really funny watching him look at these incredible cards.
The Lr ssj4 gogeta active skill is from fighter 12:20
Yoooo congrats on trending! Also team gogeta all the way.
SSJ 4 Gogeta K.O. screen should have been him sitting cross legged and arms crossed with a smirking face (but that's my opinion) Blue Gogeta has a better K.O. screen. Besides that i'm exited for these units when they come to global.
Im just shocked bro and at the same time crying like you. Jesus Christ 😭
Bro… DOKKAN IS TRENDING RIGHT NOWWWWWW!!!!! LETS GO!! 7 YEAR HYPEEEEEEE
this ine time is jellous of jp getting them first not gonna lie ;0
Nano deadass having an out of body experience watching these animations. Man's arms were about to go high-five God
ima say team SSG, because i’ve always found goku to look so clean in that form, but vegeta… vegeta looks absolutely stunning in SSG
Every 12ki I was like wait that's his 12?
When is the global anniversary
Team SSJ4
SO HYPED UP FOR THE SSJ4 GOKU AND VEGETA LEZZ GOOOOOO
team ssj4
I glanced at nano mid animation and he’s sitting there like 😳 staring at my soul
i love ssg and SS4 but the new SS4s win this no contest.
These 2 units set a new bar and make any other card art laughable
Fuck i wish rhyme still enjoyed dokkan....imagine the shirt rips
Does that count to fusions then
Like always best one yet. I think I’m going for the ssj 4s since we already have an Lr blue gogeta.
ITS A FULL 7 BARR
hands down best looking unit in the game
You’re acting needs work
How about team both
1:58 - I know!! I had same your reaction!! I was like I thought they said "Kamehame-April-Fool!"
I'll say it for nano since he couldn't because of monetization, but MY BOY AND EVERY CREAMED AT THESE ANIMATIONS
I’m wondering if Dokkan is just adding them cause dragon ball legends added them…
I do believe rhymestyle needs to make a return.
Holy smokes
I’m throwing all my dragon stones at the god goku and vegeta
11:44 this gave me fucking chills
time to farm, have come, good luck my komrads
Do you like ever close your mouth ever?
Gods
YOOOO MY MAN FOR REAL MADE IT ON TRENDING CONGRATS
Well done dokkan you've brought me back out from retirement with these gogetas, these made me so happy
Who else getting prodigy adds?
4:07 💀💀💀
just a question, is this for global or the japan version one
God Loves You Remember That ✝️🙏🏾❤️
Imso happy i saved up 300 dragon stones
RIGHT BACK HERE WITH SUMMONS
BROOO I WANT A STANDALONE SSGSS GOGETA SO BADLY
Even though I’m not a huge Dokkan fan I love the animation and I think the got the Goku and Vegeta idea from Legends
Ngl, I legit had a tear fall down with how next fucking level these animations are
I thought nano was gonna fall out of his chair when he saw ssj4 gogetas active lmfao
Dude this 7 year is gonna be awesome
Well here they are, the literal best animations of all time. Can you imagine 3 years ago seeing these?
im a little upset that they don't stay fused in to gogeta blue but my god its all better then the show/movie
WHO NEEDS AN NFT WHEN YOU HAVE A DOKKAN BATTLE WTF THIS SHIT IS SO SO SO SO BEAUTIFUL I CANT. IT BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE. dokkan animators are on a whole different fucking level.
Oh my god, those animations are AMAZING
Japan mfs winning rn but what about global man :(
Gogeta ssj4 active skill be like : let me make you cry of emotion
someone get nano some new underwear,
With super attacks like these I might just take speedup off the battle animations Lmaoo  Edit: I’m about to drop and insanely high amount of money on these
Yup, saving all my stones from now until the anniversary (global player)
I might be in the minority on this, but this anniversary has an air of finality to it. I’m not saying “end Dokkan”, obviously. I’m saying that maybe in the next anniversary, Goku and Vegeta pass the torch. I think Gohan should spearhead the 8th Anniversary.
We made it to trending 😍🐐🐐🐐🐐
When are they comming out
im really tempted to go the the JP side just to summon for these
The DBS Goku and Vegeta are hot and all but this just cemented my desire for the SSJ4's, I never imagined they would be able to do this much with them and I'm all for it. I'm so excited, not spending a single stone until they come and that's saying something considering how stupidly I spend my stones most of the time. This makes me wonder what in the world is going to come out for the LR Banner in part 2, how can they even start to make a unit that you would want more then these guys.
The thing is they actually look even better in game. They literally could not have done a better job.
Nano: dokkan literally won Me in my brain: as it should
I'm personally a legends player over dokhan, and even tho legends did amazing last year with the likes of lf ssj4 gogeta, SOH Trunks, and SSGSS Goku and Vegeta as well as ultra Super Gogeta, Legends have a lot to work for this year especially with this MASTERPIECE dokhan has put out
As cool as the SSJ4s are, I’m goin for God Goku and Vegeta. That was NUTTY
SSJ4 Gogeta’s SAs are the best of the bunch, they look so stupidly fluid
LR blue Gogeta used recycled animation from the all TUR... disappointing
THE SSJ4 THO
Bro tell me ssj4 Gogeta isn’t the best form and isn’t the best fusion
is  it only on jp? im confused?
I started playing since 2015 and I gotta say seeing how amazing these animations got just feel soo amazing
Trendinggg
No cap this made me want to cry! YES I know it’s a mobile game but just the legacy of Dragonball and how it’s impacted us as a community and the love and care they put into these units is just perfect
SS4 Gogeta to this day is still the best character in all of Dragon Ball. And to see Dokkan/Legends handle the character so well and to give him such beautiful animations and give him the MOST *_BUSTED_* abilities in both games is just the chief's kiss cherry on top.
I see the vision, since this year is double gogeta, next year will be double vegito.
Post the video of you summoning bro
Team SSJ4 all the wayyy babyyyyyy letssss gooooooo!!!!!
I’m actually speechless bro, I need these units in my life😭🔥
this is worth returning to dokkan  i"VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD GET 2 GOGETAS AT THE SAME TIME
You forgot to show the counter
If they didnt have the SSB Gogeta animation i would've been SSj4 but sheeeeeeeeeeesh no shot
Man, I got WHUET watching those. AND I DON'T MEAN JUST WET, I MEANT WHUET! DUDE!
Dude I 100% called the reference for Fighterz for Ssj4. Literally ain't no way they could've made the unit without having those hype Big Bang Kamehameha animations
NANO TRENDING
Imagine if they make the Lr broly sorrow and rage where then he transform to full power that would be history!
5:04 goku really said “hold on I’ll catch ‘em, actually nah”
The SSJ4 Intro is probably my favorite theme, man.
4:31 Nano Tripping for that one 😭🤣🤣
Im team ssj4 who with me ?
ill say this SSJ4 Goku&Vegeta (without the fusion) 12 & 18 ki looks better than SSG Goku&Vegeta 12 & 18 ki super attacks. But I like SSB Goku&Vegeta 12 & 18 ki super attacks animation better than SSJ4 Gogeta super attack animations i think. But ill say this, I do like SSJ4 Gogeta 12 ki super attack a lot.
NANO WHERES THE VID LET ME SEE YOUR HYPE WHERE IS IT
10:03 nice
This is better animation than 95% of Super, and I’d argue better than some of DBS Broly. These are AMAZING.
See I feel like y'all are the problem y'all just take whatever at this point these animations were just reused and shaded darker
Yes I’m back in the comments simping for Ssj4 Gogeta, he deserved these animations because he had such a limited screen time
Ggoooooooodddddddddddd lorrrrrrrrrrrrrdddddddddddddddddd these Dokkan animations just keep on getting better and better each year It’s so beautiful 🥲
I pulled them both!!! Got the Gods first summon
10 hours 152 k views wow
Omfg these r beautiful next year better be a year of vegito
Haven’t seen nano this excited since LR teq and str gogeta blue and vegito blue lol
Guys can anyone explain to why everyone gets so hyped over dokkan animations? Like i see that they look good and all, but they are just the exact animations from the anime or from db fighters. Like im confused cuz i gave dokkan a try and i was really bored. Compared to legends where the animations are 3d and you get you actually control your character. Can anyone explain what makes you guys enjoy dokkan so much?
We're getting a sparking ssj4 gogea n gogeta blue in the next upcoming months btw
#44 in gaming? Let’s gooooo
BRO WHAT IS THIS GAME NOW
Dokkan = "So, nano we gave all the powers to create this masterpiece so how much money do u want to spend on both of these lrs?" Nano = "Whatever it takes."
I dont know what to say other than holy shit
今までLRの速属性悟飯の必殺演出が一番好きだったけど今回で塗り替えられた。今回のこの演出は全てにおいて素晴らしすぎる
There is no way they can top any of this stuff unless they use stuff from the new movie next year
This anniversary is going to be bussin🥵
Will dbs broly still somewhat sorta fresh in my head of things that are hype af in the last couple years I'm gonna have to side with team blue but holy shit I also want the ssj4 stuff too! I love that they incorporated fighterz supers into there animations can wait to see what other units will get this treatment!
I'm guessing for global we have to wait till July for these?
Never... In my life... Have I seen anything as cool as this... Just take my wallet...
These 12 ki attacks look way better than some of the 18 ki attacks of other LRs they really went all out this anniversary
Not a JP main, so there's virtually no chance of me pulling these guys within my stone count....saving stone on my global from here on though!!
What did I just watch, God this is hype. Dokkan just pulled tfs vegeta "I am the hype!"
ssg gang
They both look amazing but God Goku and Vegeta look they just came from DBS Broly.
44 TRENDING ON GAMING
Nano def had to go to a laundromat to clean his shorts after watching this
I’m excited for July now I’m saving up now for ssj4 gogeta
So happy I pulled both lr’s with 100 stones
Yea in terms of animation dokkan shitting on legends😭😭
Dokkan litterally went overboard this time! this is tho crazy to be good!
Man as someone who’s been playing since year 1 the journey this game has made and the change it’s made in Litterally everything from content to animation like holy fuck sometimes I look at this shit and I’m like wow this is Dokkan battle how is this the same game
Buh then saibamen got lfed
This is such an amazing anniversary, I’m speechless, I really want both, ssj4 is first though, and this may be the first banner I spend money on
I’m going for gods but ssj4 looks fire 2 (best year ever? )
God dang, SSJ4 stole the show! The animations are sooooo damn good! All of the SSJ4 Animations look INSANE! Though I that SSJ4 Goku on the active before they fuse looks REALLY off model! The face is so weird! Other than that, absolute fantastic xD
When you think the animations can’t get any better
He trending lol
Wow just wow
I kept clicking the LIVING SHIIII OUT OF THAT LIKE BUTTON 😂 😂 😂
Yo, what are the part 2 Units going to look like?
Team GT here
Nano you are the main definition of flabbergasted😂
When do they drop
Team SSj4!
"Pump this Gogeta into my veins"  Newest covid vaccine of 2022 has been discovered. Thank you doctor nano
I like how they used animations from legends and fighterz for ss4 gogeta
11:35 bro this legit gave me chills the transition was so nice goku n vegeta going into gogeta
What’ll ever top this? Animation wise?
The death of nanogenix
God and the 5th ani gogeta and vegito still hold up against these animations but still it easily blows everything else out of the park including int ssj4 gogeta
I think the goku and vegeta ssb 12 ki animation is a little weird because of the 3D moments, and the LR is a little too forced because its literally the same animation at the movie...they dont even reanimated🙁
bruh i wish i was on jp
#TeamFuckingBoth
No words
I will probably never get one of them that’s the sad part😔
Lol imagine Dokkan adds LF
SSJ4 gogeta blows that out of the water.
Every God Damn year I think "we've reached peak hype" and Every Got Damb year, Dokkan makes me look like a fool. WHY-NO. HOW DID THEY SNAP THIS HAARRD?!?!?
Man fuck the blue boys im going for gogeta ssj4
So this is where dokkan breaks the game again i like it i like it i like it i will give my best in this summons
That Ultra Big Bang Kamehameha animation bro..😱
My hand is shaking from the super attacks
ssj4's are the best as always
Yoooo both units stack atk and def before transformation, theyre cracked bro
Gt units imo always have better themes than their super counterparts
Big Bang kamehameha
I am speechless
video tldr:  "That's their 12 ki?!" XD
As a global player, this is the first time that I'll skip every single banner just to pull these goddamn astonishing flabbergasting units!
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS THIS IS SICK!!
Yeah imma just wait 6 months so can be sure I'll have enough stones for when they come to global
I spoke to soon Dokkan is killing it
When is this gonna come to global? All of this looks sooooo goood.
Ss4 is better
For the first time ever the anni units are close in hype. I'm still trying to decide who to go for when they come to global.
This is gonna hurt when I inevitably get shafted and pull neither of them...
4:31 "It better make me.... I'm not gonna say it but it better do it" 4:53 It did it
If you've seen the video then I'm only gonna say this once. You better subscribe *Now!* ⚡ Cuz there's Nobody else on this dokkansphere who can do reactions like this.
I Got The Goku&Vegeta SSBSJ
I just realized that the god heat flash and the Kamehameha animations when Goku and Vegeta fired were from the kakarot DLC.
Nano you forgot ssj4 Gogeta's counter animations!!!
Gogeta >>>>>>>>>>>Vegito hands down
Team SS4 bro and I didn’t even watch the whole video yet Edit: watched the whole video now I’m here for gods there attacks are so fire
SHIT have to wait on global :(
2:02 is supposed to be a Trick Kamehameha iirc
Yeah… I think I’ll save my stones
this unit i must have ............ dokkan team pov: ohh you must have that well evil Laugh good luck.. (well nano get this in first pull ofc ) XD
Both teams 😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Personally, I like ssj4 Gogeta more, cause I feel like they improve so much on what gt had, while the ssb Goku and Vegeta isn't that different from the reference
This had me in and out of my seat like I was having a spasm. These animations were INSANE
https://youtu.be/uj-rFZtDZ0I good
Bro I like the ssj4 ost the best in my opinion it makes me so hype just like agl lr super sayian 2 gohan
im calling it right here right now. There will be an lr syn shenron and broly
Nano is trending
11:44 litteraly my reaction
If you arent ss4 side you arnet a true db fan. You are jusst a new wanna be super boy.
This is y dokkan will never die their making movies now
Oh you presaw that, what a shame. You presaid it's dragon fist before it showed up :(
11:53 the moment Nano fused with Truth
Gogeta ssj 4 18 ki attack is a mix of  LF finish and fighterz
All SSJ4 Goku and Vegeta's animations and Gogeta's animations are really good. But when it comes to god Goku and Vegeta a bit wonky. Because for their animations they have fit Vegeta into the super attacks thats is not in the movie, That's why. But really good animations too. My favourite is SSJ4 Goku and Vegeta's 18 ki and SSJ4 Gogeta's active skill. And SSB Goku and Vegeta's 18 ki...
Alrightttttt!!!! i think i am gonna make my return to dokkan
NANO! Zeno first multi lets goooooo!!!!
Dang man, now I have no clue who I wanna summon on
SS4 ARE SO FKING BOMB
That was a new level of excitement from nano, got me smiling for real
SSJ4 are insane! I can’t wait for them to come to global, imma start saving now😆
There is no way there getting topped next year no change 🤣 too much 🔥
So when do these guys become summonable?
Just like that Nano gonna spend thousands for these units
Ss4 Gogeta's Active skill should be 100X Big Bang Kamehameha.
im def going for ssj4 first reject godhood become monke
I see better than the movie
Now we gotta wait 6months for them to drop😐
I cannot believe my eyes
BEST LRS EVER!!!!
I'm f2p and I just pulled both of em with evolution vegeta namek goku 3rd ani vegito
SA Animation:  Monke >>> SSG
These unit animations are freaking amazing, my god. Best animations of all time so far
I will never get 1k sub
I dont care what else comes out on global. Im saving for this.
Gogeta supremacy😳🥵🥵
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need to start playing more for stones…
“That’s their 12 ki” Nano during this whole video 😂
they can oficially declare me bankrupt after when this hits global
Dude, Cooler's SA was just a tracing, frame by frame, from Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru's scene in the movie, there's no 3D or Rotoscoping in it, it's just his insane talent, he was the best animator, so much so, he became the character designer for the Buu saga and GT.
Utter disrespect to vegito , not only this is double gogeta anniversary , ssj4 is the actual go to 200 leader whos gonna lead even potara rather than vegito lmao
i hope i get them and i hope you get them too without spending many dragon stones
Dragon ball legends move lol
ITS SO CLEAN!
Team Gods, because that red is just too damn smexy. Also fingers crossed for other God units to get some EZA so I can actually start using them on teams
SSJ4 gogeta da goat
@Nanogenix you missed the Gogeta Counter xD hope yall enjoying the aniversary
I'm sorry but I'm summoning for the SSGs bruh that vegeta ass shot way too good to pass up  Also got em in 100 stones lets goooooo
I don't even play this Game anymore but i still enjoy watching these Super attacks
In dokkan jp ssg goku and vegeta and ssj4 goku and vegeta is already there
I like GT but damn that Vegeta ass and Breakdance tho
I might... I might just switch to Dokkan.
Ssj4 goku and vegata are always  the best big fan of your work nano
They put the ending of the best dramatic finish In the game with that active
I honestly have no clue who I'm gonna summon for when this comes to global. I thought it was gonna be easy with the god boys but holy crap are the ssj4s super attacks on the same level!
Oh wow.. I’m hyped for year 7!! Those animations are amazing !! Saving now for those stones!!
I thought we weren't gonna get ssb gogeta? Or is that for a super attack only? Or does he stay for the duration of the battle?
This gon be the one time I say I'm jealous of global being behind. I need these guys
red chrome 😐
Nahh I saving till they drop on global no more future Gohan for me
Aight i'm fucking drooling over here...
I loved ssb 12 ki. The fight looked so different and actually made it seem like it was in cgi like in the movie. Not to mention that 18 kii. They killed it. All hands down murdered it.
Toei: releases no new source material Dokkan: fine then, I'll do it myself.
Gunna be a Lil saucy and say I'd wish they'd stop just copy paste things from other games and give us something new
I cant decide which i want over the other. I want both. I wont get either (unless they are red coin lrs, then ill just save mine)  I really like gogeta ssj4, but the godku and vegeets is dope too
Team ssj4's
Sup Nano
THE POOR SAIBAMEN :(
This year dokkan going all out, can't wait global 7th anniv
ssj4 gogeta has a sick counter too
Any idea when will that come to the global version?
Wait Double Active Skill activation, The Dokkan Devs really outdid these cards
I have to throw away my Mui fanboy shit, THAT SSG GOKU VEGETA IS THE COOLEST SHIT IN THE GAME
All am saying their should be a super attack with gogeta using the fake kamehameha he does in GT
Time to get my wallet ready,   Falcor, mr luck dragon.... Help me through these summons
This make me wanna play jp lol
Aight I ain’t using any stones till anni on global. This looks insane.
I like how God Goku and vegeta have 3 fucking osts
I have become stone saver. Put on my stone chastity belt and we blue Ballin till anniversary on global fellas.
Where does the J fall off when going from SSG to SSJ4 :-?
The 7ds anime could only dream of this animation holy fuck
As an dbfz fan i Can legally say The ssj4s are nut- i mean quite delightful.
omg gogeta ssj 4 talking gives me chills
BEST THING IN DOKKAN EVER
I am speechless
Yoooo, theres 1k comments already, that goku entrance looks like MaStar Media's Akumo father of Saiyans movie that he made
rip my wallet when this comes to global... and rip to nanos wallet when it comes to jp
Well I'm lucky to get both on the 2nd multi lol
Just shut up and take my money XD
Pure saiyans and Kamehameha are eating like kings this anniversary
Unbelievable, isn’t it? But you’ve missed the gogeta ssj4’s counter i think ^^
Not spending a single dragon stone until their banner drops on global
I am very excited broooooooo
0:30 ssj4 duo 12 ki 0:58 ssj4 duo 18 ki 1:47 ssj4 Gogeta 12 ki 2:46 ssj4 Gogeta 18 ki 3:45 ssg duo 12 ki 4:33 ssg duo 18 ki 5:16 ssb duo 12 ki 6:14 ssb duo 18 ki 7:23 ssj4 duo entrance 7:53 ssg duo entrance 8:54 ssg duo transformation  9:55 ssb duo fusion 10:59 ssj4 duo fusion 11:34 ssj4 Gogeta active skill
I dont beliveeeeeeeee with my fuckingg eyessss i cnattt beliveee this gogeta ssj4 active skill and all i cant i am not ready for thisss......
You're the reason why my inner child resonate....the reaction WoW
these summons are gonna be hype asf
I'm a legends fanboy but Jesus Christ did dokkan come out to play
God Goku and Vegeta took 2 rotations 300 stones. SSJ4 Goku and Vegeta 5 rotations 750 stones.   Not too bad I guess.
The Super Saiyan God unit is my favorite card in Dokkan. Just from the animations alone
SSJ4 Gogetas active showing Goku and Vegeta flash together is the most beautiful active and animation in the whole game in my opinion.
Poor saibamen just getting abused out here
Vegito fans been real quiet ever since these released  Holy moly that Gogeta Blue ost makes me feel like Nanogenix
Yo I'm so jealous of the jp version can't wait till this comes out on global I'm save all my stones from now on until the banners come out
Ok... what the heck are they doing eight year anny... you cant top this...
I thought NNN wasn’t for another 9 months
We were not ready for this!!
This is what it should feel like when a mobile game uses the god damn money we give them on a monthly basis,  good fricking job dokkan bring the hype. Leeetttsss!!!! Gooooooo!!!!
Yeah im going for the ssgs its not even a competition with these animations
That’s it saving my coins and stones
11:54 same reaction omg ahahahaha
wait technically arent these the first new LR's of version Z ? what if most LR's start at this level of animation
Broooooooooo shout out to the animators seriously my god they were god tier. Great vid nano
These animations brought me to tears. WTF! Let's go!!!! I want both but definitely team super Saiyan 4
Watching these animations just made me NUT🗿
Ok i feel like the best link partner for lr ss4 gogeta would be int ss4 gogeta  As for the blue bois, maybe SSBE vegeta and SSBKK goku
Only sad thing about this is we didnt see gogetas fake kamehameha
NANO: "This better not make me....... you know what." Watches 18 Ki SSG Goku & Vegeta animation: Does it anyway
Nano over here literally eyegasming all over his screen
Considering the lack of reference material they have for SSJ4  I think they’ve done really good with the card. the blue bros are also good but considering the amount of reference material they have it doesn’t impress me as much #TeamSSJ4
Ssj4 looks way better im sorry both top 2 in the game if you disagree youre just wrong
Dokkan just evolved again
Vegito after watching these animations: "Am I a joke to you?"
11:08 gokus face
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!! This made me not summoning on any banners till they arrive! 0_0
They really did it this time.
ssj4 gogetas active skill litterally had my jaw hit the floor for like 10 straight seconds.
NGL, the reaction was kind of forced and cringe. Ill go see Rhymestyle now.
Going to say it now:  ;Breathes in slowly;  ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLRIGHT GUYS!  J/k. THESE UNITS ARE FIRE, HUGE NOD TO DOKKAN!
Eh.. Kinda an easy skip for me. Which is kinda good actually. Dokkan is as much a game with strong units as it is simply a card collector for me, and GT and SUPER do less than nothing for me as a DB fan. 7 years in and Kid Buu still can't get an LR? We can't get a good LR Piccolo from Namek saga? We can't get a good LR Trunks from the fight with Cell after Vegeta checked out? How about a worthwhile LR Ultimate Gohan?  I love Gogeta as much as the next guy, Fusion Reborn is my favorite movie. But it's getting silly now. And all this has done is told me Year 8 it's going to be all Vegito's, and I'm already asleep for that too.  Good luck to everyone that is going to summon though, hope you get your units!
Db legends: makes the first every tag team duo ssgss goku and vegeta in db legends                                                                           Dokkan: sees the ssgss tag team goku and vegeta from db legends also sees there performance then immediately starts playing the next 7 anniversary character from db legends
That poor saibaman always getting beat in ult previews
This is NOT dokkan this is just dbs broly clips
Can we appreciate the face of Complete Amazement from Nano at 12:12 :D
I love all these animations but ssj4 gogetas are so phenomenal they make GT as a whole drool with how good it could look and I can't wait for this anniversary I haven't been this excited for a anniversary in a long time. That's saying something because last year was my favorite anniversary and this one hasn't even started yet and it's already looking sooo gooooood
#TeamGogetassjblue but ssj4 is still good
11:54 meme’d 😂
Not only are they top tier in animations and kits, but they have 3 OST’s each!  Also, I could feel the pure joy from Nano
I have him got him first summon the gogeta ssj4
Well I'm not summoning on anything until anniversary now haha
Take my money
Why did Dokan copy ssj blue goku and Vegeta
Wtf!!!!
O.M.G The fluent animation movement The ost The sheer power from the moves they picked and how they had them play out  These devs are impossible, they keep leveling up
Ultra ssj4 gogeta in Dragon Ball legends will be soooo fkin nice I can tell
Dokkan sure knows how to rob us right 😭
My dudeeee!!!! I got so hype like nano!!! What in the world are this animations 🔥🔥🔥my heart is about to explode 😂why I’m so hype lol
Vegeta and Goku best rivals / team mates , duo looks so good
ssj4 all day i dont like re colors so....
i have a bad account and i'm lvl 245  restarting the game will give a lot of crystals or is it better to restart on the anniversary.   the only LR i have are vegito red. goku black purple, MJ Vegeta blue Cell purple, Defence gogeta Brown
U didnt saw.ssj4 gogetas counter
Bro Im speechless. My jaw hurts from having my mouth open to how good these animations right now. Im legit gonna finally grind every event and save all the stones to pull these units. I needed something to bring me back to play dokkan casually and this is it.
Guess I’ll start grinding global and saving for these absolute beasts 😅
GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE GOGETA BLUE
Why did I spend my 300 stones In the 77 multi first?? Omg what are these animations???
7 is really a lucky number just like dragon balls, 7th anniversary with 7 animation: intro, sa , ultra sa, active skill, sa, ultra sa and active skill
7th anniversary and they already done shit like this imagine 10th anniversary or something like that
god damn that gogeta active skill is above god tier animations lol
I loved the reactions NANO! But next time I would recommend watching DOKKANWORLD's videos because he reveals all the animations and OST's much more smoothly than the ones you watch on twitter, they're  much better. Also I think you missed Gogeta's counter animation.
Finally they added screaming
Ive already died from A RAW LEVEL 7
I LOVE THIS REACTION VIDEOS!!!!!
Let's PULLLL~~!
Legit redownloaded jp dokkan for this anniversary and first multi on blue bros I get Zeno summon and get them.
Dokkan is eating good this year better than Yr 6 anni and the teq super gogeta banners
I got blue boys first multi I put 1050 into Monke boys and haven't got them yet
im team ssj4...amazing
I thought the animations wouldn’t get any better after the 5th year active skills.. BOY WAS I SO WRONG 🤯
I’ll tell my kids 7th anniversary was peak Dokkan. Pffft 350 mill dl who???
i realy shed some tears of happiness :"D
If you showed me these animations without the context of the 7th anniversary, I would honestly think they are just clips from the anime
parallax may be the word you were looking for with the rotational effect
Ok, they're perfect. Nothing else to say. I was worried but they laid everything to bare.
Bro this SSJ4 Gogeta is the best unit in the entire game like…I’m so damn jealous of JP 😖 A leader skill that supports 4 categories, can guarantee crit for a turn, 2 active skills both voiced btw like Dokkan said “you want the best LRs ever crafted here you go!” 😩 There’s absolutely no way to top these two LRs. Even for Saiyan Day or Goku, Gohan & Goten day. These two are the pinnacle of hype like fuck man 🥴 Good luck to those of you summoning which should be everyone, I wouldn’t be surprised if cup noodles is your dinner for the next few months lmao I will rainbow both of these monsters mark my words…
The active skill took the LF SS4 in legends and fighterZ animations
When you thought the previous anniversary units have the best animation of all time, the dev proves you wrong.
Global main yeaaaa in saving and buying stones lmao shit was way to hard
When will 7th dokkan anniversary come for indian players plz tell me i am waiting for these characters🤔🤔🤔
Global main here and Rip all other banners till Global 7 year and then rip my bank account lol do i go for both
Monke power
nano looks like a child on Christmas morning
omfg those are the best animated cards that i ever see in my life
My favorite are ssg goku and vegeta
WOW  O.O
Legends dev: cool here a New yamcha
My ftp self knows damn well I’m not going to get lucky enough to get either of these units. Yet I feel so excited.
Team ssj4
OH MY GOD, these animations are SO GOOD! It's actually just crazy to see how far dokkan has come. From copy pasted beam attacks to actually anime/fighterz style attacks. I just can't believe it
Team ssj4's
LR Gogeta ssj4 has the best super attacks for me
I'm entirely F2P. That might change for these. What the FUCK.
That battlestance into spinning shoryuken into godflash & kamehameha is so friggin awesome.
I wonder whats the eta on them coming to global
team ssj4
TEAM BOTH, I NEED BOTH
Best animation in have seen in my life. I can Rest In peace now.
Both are sick af, but ssj4 gogeta was on another level, ngl
Team SSJ4 all day
it took them 4+ years to Give us an LR SSJ4 Gogeta (and 2 years to give us the Promotional Art from The DBS Broly movie)
This anniversary should be called Monke Vs Godhood
OH MY GOOOOD
When I summon I’m probably going for ssj4 gogeta since I need someone on my gt team
Im pissed stop cucking  us on Gogeta Blue dokkan standalone unit when? Seriously Vegito has 3 standalone Blue units no transformations no fusing actives, straight gogeta blue unit needs to happen
Bro, you should have seen the Ssj4 gogeta's counter, it look so good!
When is this coming out?
These two are insane INSANE UNITS OMDS the attacks are so crisp ssj4 units I like better by a bit they just seem so omg especially ssj4 gogeta the blue units and otherworldly though amazing the only thing is the blue gogeta is good until the blasts it’s the same animation so it wasn’t as hype but still amazing these units 😮‍💨😮‍💨omg this gonna be the best anniversary so far
Fusion team would be broken
Ngl the 18ki for the SSG Goku and Vegeta reminds me of they're attacks against Beerus on DBZ Kakarot. I want both so bad now, can't wait for year 7 now on global.
Prolly the only one that felt the ssjbs are right at the mark of being perfection but just stops mid way every time. Shows goku's best ssjb transformation sequence only to skip the best part(yeah ik it's to save time but man what a waste), ssjb 18 ki feels empty in the middle with them doing like 2 attacks before galick kamehameha instead of adding an additional combo like legends, gogeta fusion for him to only do one attack and that's it. Still amazing but man they was soooo close with them, ssj4s hit the mark perfectly
Team ssj4 all day
#TeamSSG
Oh please, both LR Gogeta are awesome!!! Personally I like SSJ4 Gogeta but might as well pull on SSG banner too XD
I see alot of animations referencing other db game, legends mainly for the ssb ones
Just got the hoodie Nano!! Thank you soooooooo very much!
the year is 2022, and I am here in my bedroom/office screaming to png's BECAUSE THE HYPE NEVER BEEN MORE REAL
No one:  Dev: let's make these units have the best animation
As someone who plays in Global...I feel jealous as fuck right now....I’ll save prob a thousand Dragon stones for these two
These units are absolutely gorgeous
Ss4 gogeta looks better
What could be the part 2 lrs, im guessing broly and shenron
I'm pretty sure that ssj blue gogeta is gonna be like the ssj gt goku and vegeta that came out. With how they went ssj 4 with their actives with one attack and what not.
Bro i dont play dokkan but after watching these animations i am considering
also you missed the gogeta ssj4 counter
Team SSJ4 all the way.  The gods look great too
500 stones and got 2 fp frieza 😔
i was kinda doubting when i saw the ssj4 goku/vegeta but wow these animations really are the best in game
Problem is Nano has luck and money to buy a lot of stones. i need wait for 50 stones about 2 months. So sad.
Animation got my lil dude perked up 🤤
Hey guys, we all hype about the animations. But what about the the way the characters look when they take the super attack. Like, when is that changing
I zeno animationed (My first ever since it's release) the blue bois first multi. I can't stop crying....
Guys, we'd better start grinding stones😤
This is a 7 year old mobile game ... this came out literally in 2015 and it looks THAT GOOD ? just wow !!!
How are they even gonna top this? This is insane.
Now we all need to be ready for the 4th anniversary for legends and guys I’m serious save your cc Ik there was speculation for the Black Friday banners for legends festival ppl thinking it was gonna be a ultra Mui or gogeta blue or lf full power jiren but guys I truly believe it will come in due time #4thanniversarylegends #dokkan7anniversary
High chance standalone blue gogeta and vegito are now heroes exclusives
i almost got in trouble for screaming so damn loud because of how good these look
I think I get it now  Gogeta animations = based from fighterz Vegito animations = based from kakarot  Now I’m hyped for a vegito unit
overreacting much lmao
Now to wait 6 months
Monke monke monke monke time!!!!!
Team super sayjian god all day
SSJ4. . .
SSJ4 GOKU/VEGETA 18 KI is my fave bro
Ok guys gogeta is cool and all but I need that god goku and vegeta
THIS IS SO FUCKING HYPE BOYSS, LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO. Im so sad ima global main😭😭😭😭😭
Beeeessssst units in the games dude
So damn clean man. They really do keep improving on the animations.
DUDE GOGETA SUPREMACY. SSJ4 GOGETA 18KI AND ACTIVE IS THE BEST!!!!
Nano I pulled every new unit in my summon video!!!
When will this come to global? I always forget-
Omg I’ve waited 7 years for this!!!! Finally the best character ever created finally gets an LR let’s go SSJ4 GOGETA FOR THE WIN!!!!!
Gt went sooooo much harder then dbs
Yooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I am going straight for the ssj4 boys
Soooo uh, I guess I'm saving and grinding stones It looks like
Alright redownloading Dokkan
Gods do not beat the 4's, that final shine into the dragon fist? SICKEST THING EVER
Ssj4 gojeta was way cooler in my opinion both were dope tho
Am I watching the anime in 4k or dokkan battle?
Nano is literally breaking apart XD
Dude those aftershock effects on the explosions and the dragon fist? Got me acting up.  Interesting that the blue units don’t have many aftershocks to end off the animations.
So the new thing is multiple active skills?
str cooler who?
This is the first time new animations have left me speechless
The blue bros super attacks are the most insane thing dokkan has ever put out
Idk what left me more speechless  The sheer quality of the animations or you saying “you sussy sussy devs”
its one thing to watch the new animations - but i always prefer watching the new animations via a live reaction =)
I think ssj4 gogeta wins on this one if they made blue goku and vegeta fused to gogeta blue  it would've been better but ill go for gt on this one
mate his got me hyped up so much lets gooooooo
What did I just witness?! OMG JULY NEEDS TO HURRY UP FOR GLOBAL! WOW.
God bless everyone and have a good day
Nano seems drunk with how much excitement he has and I’m right there with him!
ONCE THESE UNITS GET TO GLOBAL, IMA USE ALL MY DS BROOO
I got shafted 😞
5:34 they put some respect on “the glare”
Speechless beyond comprehension! Bro I can't NOT get ova how fire these animations are!!!!! Both of these  mothafucking duo characters/units are fokin' mental yeah! Also I and someone that I know noticed that there is an apparent theme being played out. And theme that is PRIMAL VS DIVINE or DIVINE VS PRIMAL if you will. But, I wanted to say,  we ain't done yet bruv because if this is part one of the anniversary then I cannot even IMAGINE!!!!! How sculpted & structured ( same thing ) the next characters coming fo' Dokkan Anniversary Part 2! Oh also I and possibly other people, may have an inkling/inquiry of an idea on who's coming to da game. So, please don't quote me on this but, since the Dokkan game creators showcased Base Broly and Syn Shenron I think the next people's ( I know "people's" is not the right dialect or word to use but, whateva I'm hyped) coming to Dokkan JP ( Japan for those who don't know ) who are about to be LR'S is possibly  LR Base Broly form transforming into, Ikari/Wrathful form into, Super Saiyan Broly into, finally woo, excuse me, is anyone else sweating because it feels like Broly is about to GO INTO THAT BAH MINDSTATE AND TRANSFORM INTO THE  FULL POWA LEGENDARY SUPA SAIYAJIN BROLI!!!!!! RAWRRRR! Woo sorry about go off track I just really fux with Broly LET'S GO DOKKAN!  Anyhow, the next LR is maybe gonna be Syn Shenron morphing into Omega Shenron with all da BLACK SHADOW DRAGON BALLS TEARING SHIT UP AHAAAA! Ahem yo, all in all now that I got that out Dokkan I remember being 13  year's old downloading you on my phone seeing AGL Super Saiyan God, STR Beerus and I think INT Whis being the first banner I saw and I was like " Oh I like this Dragon Ball y'all know what y'all's doing". And from there on I and a whole heck alot of other people loved you since then, whether it be: Goku Black coming to the game, Jiren coming, LR Goku and Frieza coming to the game and Super Saiyan Blue Evolution Vegeta traverse to the game you have been there wowing us and with that thank you very I'm so excited to see what you can do next so, take your time Dokkan let those fire art animations flourish and grow for us players to see and with that said I can't wait for the next anniversary and the next one and so on, and so on,. Alright that's enough someone's eyes are gonna strain from reading this if they do so my apologies but, I'M FUCKING HYPED MANG! LET'S GOOOO YEAR 7! Amazing, Awe-inspiring, Hype vid as always Nano I, no we love the energy bro. And if you got this far down into reading this, I don't usually say this but, you the real MVP  ( Most Valuable Person ) how you are doing? Cíao rock on. 😎🤟
Dokkan is going to make me poor again
Team ssj4 for the win🥰
bro i kid you not nano i got chills and the same reactions as you man, I'm mad hype for those animations
I was expecting the character models for gogeta to be better, god duo looks better and clean af
YO BOTH HAS SUCH GODLY ANIMATIONS
so how long till they on global
Wait, what about the SSJ4 Gogeta counter???
I wish legends Ssj4 Gogeta had The aura
Why they gotta make me cry bro. Im such a fucking nerd.
Bro the DBS Broly movie made me loves the blue forms simply because the aura looks so sick and the shading makes it look badass, so great that dokkan managed to capture that and more.
Okay best animations ever
When I don’t feel my phone in my pocket 5:11
Omg! I’m so hyped for LR GOGETA SSJ4!
Well just take my money then
Ummmmmmm!! I am not even Jp dokkan player and I'll be hyped as heck all the way to global 7 year. Nothing but a master piece for both units super animations 😍👌🏽
fun fact that wasnt the Z bar animation from fighterz its just the normal level 3 with the goku and vegeta in the back so they kinda combined them
Sorry but I’m full on team supah saiyajin fourdah
My eyes have been blessed and probably blinded by the greatness that I just saw with these units animations
aaahh ooooo aaaaah oooooo   Nano 2022
That means fusing vegito blue for wwc HYPE
welp, how many months do i have left, doesnt matter actually, gonna start savin up for global
Just did the 300 dragon stone summon and git 5 LRs
Yo can someone please explain what ost and eza mean please?
You missed Gogeta’s counterrrrrr!!!!
bro omg I'm crying at Walmart right now TvT
They beating that saibaman’s ass
I lasted 6 years. 6 arduous fun and challenging year. I declare. That I am F2P no longer. They WILL BE RAINBOWED.
Goku and Vegeta blue animations are way better I love them
Team ssjg
“Dragon ball legends who?”
Team SSG 🔥
Dead ass these are the best animations in any dragon ball game! I was so taken aback on how good they look!
YEAR 7 BE CRAZY!!!! GOGETA FTW!!!!
Is this global cuz I’m on iPhone and I can’t get jp
Nano: "WHAT IS THIS" it's animations from DBZ Broly three years ago that you're going to watch once and then auto battle through, Nano 🙃
OHHHHHHHHHHHH nano spoiler ataca JAJAJAJA
They rly just let me skip Gohan and Teqdroids just to get them both
Community: no gogeta blue thank god  Gogeta blue : get revavled Communist: why are you here
Whew… that’s all I can say 😰
Me being a global player, I got a heck of a lot of time to save stones for this event
4:31 it better IT BETTER MAKE YOU WHAT NANO⁉️⁉️⁉️🤨  📸
Pulled bluebois second multi. Life is good.
Damn now us global players gotta wait 6 months 😭
SHEEESH YYOOOOOOOOOO

as soon as he said rotary efftect from cooler I was thinking  he's gonna have his mind blown with the the blue goku vegeta
im a simple man i see ssj4, i save stones for ssj4
Y i wonder your reaction was fake on ssj4 card🙄👍🏻
Umm when are they coming
Day 2 of requesting a Dokkan Battle OST Reaction series
My god these animations... THESE ANIMATIONS...
4:31 PUH LEEZ💀
Those SSJ4s is pulling me back into this game.
MOM i;m watching Dragon BALL MOVIE AND GT ON MY PHONE SHUT UP!
Ok the team went in way too hard this time wtf
THIS GAME IS ON A DIFFERENT LVL
Goku and vegeta got the best 12ki and 18ki
We need rhyme back in Dokkan
CANT WAIT FOR IT TO HIT GLOBAL REEEEEE SAVING STARTING TODAY SKIPPING ALL THE BANNERS
They have so much to offer that we will never get bored of using them!
Ssj4 gogeta 18k animation looks straight from fighterz same goes for active skill
Ok guys Vegeta's real name is "Begeta" confirmed.
Bro... Best LRs in the game.
Bruh, I remember when Cooler dropped, thinking it could never be topped.
Gogeta's animations are soo good, but I like Gogeta's even better! 😁
Wait when does the anniversary launch for global (plz awnser)
Goresh has the translations up - if you thought the animations were good just wait until you see their kits.
Dude I was screaming in joy after seeing Ssj4 goku and vegeta animations and when I saw Ssj4 Gogeta I threw my wallet at the screen I NEED HIM
LETTSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO THIS HAS ME SOO HYPE
*Somebody get Nano some water. Dudes gonna pass out from too much excitement.* 😂😂😂
SSJ4 all the way!!!
The ssgss's ost had me so hype I woke up my neighbors
*Thumbnail* Me: OH SH#! : OH SH#! : OH SH#! : OH SH#!  NO WAY!!
Bro is this fucking dokkan wtf are we playing on
Been watching you for awhile and i havent commented on a video before but your reactions and these animations were so hype! this was amazing!
Idk Goku Vegeta SSB 18ki doesn't hit for me
People coming back to dokkan for this
I legitimately went through so many emotions, left speechless and in tears after these animations. Holy Fucking Shit
Yup, spending like $50 for just 1 copy of each. PLZ
You miss the counter attack from gogeta ssj4 but anyway its always nice to see ur reaction nano🔥🔥
W unit’s
Yes
bro you didn't see the counter
SS4 Gogeta has the better animations personally, because we’ve seen Gogeta’s before
I’m on global, was going to summon for Janemba… looks like I’m saving starting today
I GOT SSJ4 GOGETA FIRST MULTI I JUST CAN'T LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
LR fused warriors team finna go crazy
This might be inaccurate but have to do it for this nano you looked like you had the greatest nut your life watching this animation
What makes it crazy is that bardock took those active skills with a smile on his face
Just wanted to tell banners up didnt pull either of new lr's so make me salty.
I'm gonna save a lot of stones for the 7th anniversary for Dokkan Global version! I want both Gogetas! I'm a huge fan of Gogeta
okay, considering that anni units get better and better every year, and this is lowkey the pinnacle of animations, I just won't be ready for next year.
Im already rewatching it lol
I’d sell my soul for that ssj4 Goku and vegeta
im going broke
Just downloaded dokkan and my first summon was ssj 4 gogeta     I wanted this at legends and i got it dokkan bruh
this just looks like a DIFFERENT VIDEO GAME at this point
This year I might actually become a full P2P player 😨
Dokkan won 2022
SSJ4 GOGETA THE GOAT
Ssj4 gogeta 18ki isnt from fighters, its from legends legendary finish
Fuck me I'm definitely not spending a single stone on global. That ssj4 gogeta is gonna be me no matter what going all in for him.
The gods could look a bit wonky at some parts but they’re made too look good in x2 I’m pretty sure
I've watched this video about ten times, i can't believe they pulled it off
Man im boutta cry
It’s crazy how far dokkan animations have come from
I got the LR SS4
Jesus fucking Christ im speech less
Alright. Alright so.  In order from worst to best.  SSG’s 12 and 18 ki SA  SS4’s 12 and 18 ki SA  SSB’s SA’s and their Active SSB Gogeta  And SS4 Gogeta’s SA and Active.   I’m sorry but they did SSB Gogeta dirty by having him be an active Skill instead of a transformation because SS4 Gogeta is both a transformation and an active so I’m sorry but yea SS4 wins I’m not even going for the Blue’s anymore.
Bro Ssj4 Gogeta 4 12ki Is freaking fire bro like damn maybe I should get dokkan on jp
At first I thought the Bluebros were winning, then SSJ4 Gogetas active skill reminded me of why he was my favorite character in all of DB.
THE GOGETA ACTIVE OST IS NUTS
As a gt Stan myself I have to admit those god ki actives gave me chiiiiilllllls
global player here hype cant even express how I feel for these characters
These units are hype af!!! No idea who I'm going to summon for first yet
Counter tho
Can anyone confirm that they stay fused after its used??
There’s only one thing I can say for these   *HOLY SHIT*
Nano, stand up. Don't be afraid, stand up
Bro i cannot even comprehend the hype  This is so amazing 🤩
Ssj4 won
First time commenting on Nano's videos,   I nutted.
Devs: "How many animations can we put in one unit?"
When can people do the summons
I love Nano's reactions 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The ssg god ost fire but the ssj4 gogeta active is got me wanting to summon for him instead
nano the units are out can u summon on them i wanna see the video
i love all these animations but the SSG 12 Ki is probably my favorite, its so smooth and feels straight outta the movie
Saibaman never asked for all this smoke
I hate how they don't release the summons when the anniversary starts
18ki: Punch in the face? Nonono take this ad in the face
This characters are straight heat!!! One questions I have is for the ssb goku and vegeta, will the active skill where they fuse into ssb gogeta let them stay in that form or do they only transform for the stardust breaker and then after they un-fuse?
Ssj4 gogeta also has a dodge counter :)
Ayo, can you really complain about the butt shot tho. Thank you devs 😩
i think its about time they update the enemys so they dont look like a 5 year olds drawings and raise the card art from 240p to 1080p and i think they should cut older phones like iphone 5 for example so they can do more with the game
The SSJ4s easily have the best looking super attacks in the game fr fr my man aye fr fr man aye These Lr animations are easily the best fr fr my man aye fr fr my man aye Team SSJ4s
ready for tmr afternoon.🔥🔥🔥🔥 this game better get 1st place in the app store bc we gonna need some crystals for these banners
The SSG lrs animation was taken from kakarot🔥🔥
Gogeta ssj4 is literally the best ever both in Dokkan and Fighterz
Ssj4’s all the way im really surprised because i thought with all the really good animations from dbs broly that the ssg’s sa animations would’ve been better but they both are incredible
These are absolutely crazy but say goodbye to your phone storage💀💀🤣🤣
Goddammit now I have to come back to game
The animations are so trash 🤮🤮🤮
FINALLY. My Anticipation was killing me LOL
This is the year of Gogeta my dudes and as a Gogeta fanboy I am freaking hype I can’t wait for 5 months. No offense to all of the Vegito fans probably 8th year anniversary. Also #teamSSj4 all the way my dude also I need them now too my dude  But… one thing is for certain who ever says that Dokkan is dying is a freakin LIAR.
THE OSTSSSSSSSSS BRROOOOOOOO! I’m a global main, which is not ideal but I’ll grind the crap out of Dokkan and be ready!
Holllyyy shit this gave me the chills 🔥🔥 These are incredible I was screaming right along with you 😳
Ayo ima cry for bout 9000 years if I don’t get at least one of these units
I want whatever the animators are taking
I will have to say team Super Saiyan four all the way. I am so hype thanks nano!
“You sussy sussy Devs”  -Nano 2022

god bros is hard af,  those ssj4s hard too
the duo blues is cool and all, but could you imagine a revamped version of agl gogeta blue's SA on top of the dramatic finish from fighterz if they made it gogeta blue
That GOGETA ssj4 active skill had me cryin brooooooo!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Two types of people here, Those who like gogeta blue And those who are wrong

The super saiyan into god is hype 🔥 definitely summoning on them first
At this point i don't mind dropping 20$ on a celebration like this of they always keep this up!
Holy shit.

HOLY SHIT! THIS IS NUT WORTHY ANIMATIONS!!! LETS GO SON!!!
I've been on and off of Dokkan since Day 1. They did that. I can see they not wastin the money
The counter is amazing. He does the party hat pop fake kamehameha thing and his LAUGHING ANIMATION. AMAZING.
Yeoooo what is that SSJ4 card😧😧😧😧
They took ssj4 gogeta's 18 ki from legends and fighterz that's just lazy
12:03 THE DRAMATIC FINISH ENDING TOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These animations are insane!!! They look so good bro.
this literaly left me speechless
I got the SSJ gods in my second rotation :D
nano just ascended to the heavens.  note:not dead, just super hyped
you forgot the gogeta counter
I was literally just like man there’s no way they can do more than what they did for reps of universe 7 and they pull up with this
Ik Rhymestyle punching the air rn😂😂
SOOO HYPED!!!!! DOUBLE GOGETA!!! 😆🤩
I’m shaking bro I’m going all out for ssj4 goku and vegeta
YOU MISSED THE NULLIFICATION FROM SSJ4 party popper
one this is right double gogeta
I knew they were doing the entrance animations from ultras in legends
Shut up and take my money dokkan!!
those poor saibamen
Ssg team fasho
IT IS TIME BUDDIESSSSSSSSSSSS LETS DO THIIIS
im convinced, gotta save to try to pull one of these bad boys
I already know truth is going to cream. Gogeta SSJ4 are better imo
Man missed the ssj4 gogeta counter
Blue Gogeta has the best animation in the game
The amount of nutting that happened as I watched these animations is innumerable
I'm definitely summoning on monkey
6:38 The way Vegeta swung his foot in 360 during the camera movement was DOPE 👍💪😆😁
Holy shit I’m so hyped, time to save up stones till July
Oh my poor wallet
“They even gave us the vegeta ass pick”  Nano- 2021
Gogeta fans WE RISEEE!
YO GLOBAL FOR THE LOVE A GOD BRO PLEAAASE DO THESE VOICE ANIMATIONS JUSTICE FOR THIS ONE THIS IS TOOO CLEAN
These animation make me crying bro idk why
LITERALLY IN FUCKING TEARS MAN
you miss the counter animation for gogeta
Wallets will become empty for sure
I was screaming after every super attack I haven't been this hyped in so long. Of course, two Gogetas would be the most exciting thing for a Gogeta fan.
Reject Godhood return and embrace the monkeys,  of course team ssj4s
Bro time to save all my dragon stones bro I said wow wow so many times I woke up my family I wad legit screaming 🤯 I am so glad I decided  to start playing  the game again 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They trynna get rhymestyle to come back😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
bro i can't wait 6 months to get my hands on these
Nah fuck it i love gogeta man but the goku and vegeta god looking so fire
The moment i saw those animations i could already hear nano screaming
Now, everyone on global will be saving until the anniversary lol. If the games were caught up, there wouldn't be this issue!
And just like that we can still get a new blue Gogeta from the movie
so im just saying we should get LR truth of sword trunks and LR zamasu
This is the fattest and fastest I have ever busted in my life
Imma be honest super takes the animation but that gogeta ssj4 got the best active skill
God damn I want the SSJ4’s for that dragon fist but I the SSJ Blue’s 18 Ki is fucking insane.
Omfg I cannon wait
Im bumped out they dont have a KO screen 😢 Other then that great LRs
Bro they have to do a part two with vegito with these animations
That was beautiful dokan animations put legends to rest and I’m a legends player
Legends take note
I’m cooming
We bouttta whale out 🐋 🦍
TEAM SSJ4
10:33 I like how dbz: Db just took gogeta transformation from dbz fighters then the broly movie.
Well this explains why the Goku and hit animations looked like garbage
I’m going for gt all the way
Vegito fans 🥲
You can't change my opinion. Ssj4 gogeta looks better than ssb gogeta
Letsgoooo their animations are so GODLY AND of course... MONKE
got gogeta first summon
I pulled the Gods LR on my third summon with the good ole Zeno animation and pulled the SSJ4 on the first summon on the banner. Both units in 200 stones yes please.
The beginning of LR Gogeta SS4 18Ki animation is when he enters the battle in DBFZ when the previous character is defeated.
Lucky for me I'm on global so I have months to save Stones but now I got to try harder cause AIN'T NO WAY I'M MISSING OUT ON BOTH THESE UNITS 🔥🔥🔥
BRO THE 12 KI FOR THE SSJ BLUES IS THEIR POSES FROM THEIR FIRST FIGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER IN Z AHHHHHHH
This isn't a mobile game anymore
When both ssj4 combined into that gogeta Kamehemaha I SCREAMED
That's real overacting
i told people blue boys had a gogeta super attack
Just pulled the ss4s in three multi
He missed the counter ss4 had lol
This for global or JP
missed Gogeta's party popper
Got the ssg’s already lol
SSJ4 ALL THE WAY
I cannot tell you how happy I am that the Goku screcth from broly is in this game
I bordello don't get hyped for things but both are awesome I prefer Ssj4
The SSJ 4's I've been waiting for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow you didn't wait for the actual stream, weak.
Gotta wait 6 months for these 2 duos
you didnt look at the counter?
Team GOATGETA hands down. Start saving on Global NOW.
G DAMN IT THAT SS4!!! ARE U SERIOUS!!!
Literally just went to look this up but didn’t know you dropped 30 mins ago😀-
He didn't react to gogetas evasion 😔
Ssj4 Gogeta's active IS SO GOD DAMN BEAUTIFUL THE BEST ANIMATION IN DOKLAMKAN HISTORY LETS GOOOOO
When are they coming to jp i NEED them
BROOOO!!!! I called the active into Gogeta on one of truths videos, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
BRO THE OST, HOLY F*CK!!!!!
LET’S GO DUDE I AM SO _HYPED_ RIGHT NOW!! Ssj4 Gogeta looked so clean and beautiful and GOGETA BLUE MADE IT IN. We actually got double Gogetas and while at first I didn’t want this year to be fusions again, they did it in such a way that is breathtaking and I am absolutely here for it, LET’S GOOOO
All 400 of my stones and and didn’t get a single featured unit. I can’t keep playing this shit
Naw bruh the ssj4’s ost got me floating my guy
Uhhh... I'll be honest here, these videos make me feel like we aren't even playing the same game from 6 years ago.  Just blown away at how far these animations have come.  Pretty much just the movie scenes in Dokkan. 🔥🔥  Great video Nano!
Good luck on your summons bois 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Team SSJ4 all the way
Dokkan outdid themselves again man.... Can't wait for it to be on global.
Oh my god bro they both look so amazing I can’t imagine what they’re gonna do with a dbs broly
Definitely going for SSJ4s first
This hands down the best characters with the best Everything and Especially Animations
This is the best Nano reaction is the last 7 years by far and that's saying A LOT.  Incredible reaction 💯
I DONT EVEN PLAY DOKKAN ANYMORE BUT IM HYPEDDDDD
2:27 what you’re trying to say is rotoscope Also fun fact:Gogeta has a blast counter
Ssj4 reigns Supreme
The intro animations are so cool. It would be nice if they were limited to anniversary and world download celebration units tho
Come on bro you should've waited
Im shitting bricks rn, holy fuck
THE 2 GOGETAS ARE HERE FOR THE ANNIVERSARY YESSSSSS
I love the combination of animations from different dragon ball games 👍🏾🔥
Time to save for global man...hahaha
if this doesn't get you off the hub i don't know what will
ITS TIME
Where can I download jp dokkan cuz that was fire
7 years… 7 years of development and here we are guys.
Does this also go on global or only JP
I’m Srry whatttttt
WHAT THE HELL AM I MEANT TO SUMMON ON
HOLY        $@#$%^&*( I NEED THESE UNITS AND I HAVENT PLAYED THIS GAME IN FOREVER
Kinda sad this wont come to global for a long time im not a jp player
BRO THE WIND FLOWING FOR THE LEVEL 7 fight active skill ITS TOOO MUCH 🔥
Bro u missed out on SSJ4 Gogeta . Fake Kamehameha counter attack
You know the best part about the SSB's active skill? They left out Gogeta naming himself so theres room for at least one more SSB Goku and Vegeta that fuse into Gogeta
Ok third and last comment,but rip us global players who have to wait forever
I am saving now for global idgaf
#DokkanBattletothemoon
Nanos wife and kid did not get any sleep tonight
Blue gogeta really made me think I was watching the movie
YO I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THE ULTRA BIG BANG KAMEHAMEHA EXTRA AS HELLA
Best animations in the game bruh 😭
so do they *stay* Gogeta Blue or is that just for the one move?
Banners are live!
Does each unit have 2 osts???!!!
The New OSTs Are Sooooooooo Good!!!!!!
Those devs were on something man
SSJ4 ALL THE WAYYYYY BABAABABABABABABYYYYYYYYYYYYY
You know, for every anniversary, I was always so damn sure on who to pick first. This is the first time ever, that I can't choose between the two...I want them bothhhh  (Also them using up the leftover animations of gogeta blue for a small active skill is really dumb, they should've saved it for standalone GB)
Got both of them, so happy!
i hope intro's dont play every single time or thats gonna get annoying. also watch their active skill conditions be so absolutely bonefuckingly hard to pull off that it wont even matter they have them
rip to old phones, that 18 ki on the blue LRs is never gonna load
DUDE I NEED SSG DUO AND SSJ4 DUO I NEED ALL OF THEM THE ANIMATIONS HAVE LEVELED UP BY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
Reject Godhood,return to MONKE
Fuck it imma skip EVERY banner in Global until the 7th anniversary
Nano can i give u my acc for these units you should make me a alt with just them on it
Legit loving watching these with your reactions. Makes them 100x better. Keep up that grind my guy!
when did dokkan evolve this much, from the first lr the ssj goku to this?
nothing wins ssj4
I guess no counters for ss4 gogeta. That's a shame
Man everybody's freaking out about Gogeta but I'm going to be honest the gods are so cool dude so my favorite animations in dokkan
I'm a global player, but when year 7 hits on global I'm 100% chasing the God boys first
My hype is rising my hype is overflowing!!!
I’m bricked, nothing else needs to be said about these animations 😭
What is this i was not expecting this.this is crazy i don't even know what to say i
Hear me out part 2 LR is the Z fighters from the Omega shenron fight that revive into spirit bomb kid goku
きた
I LOVE THE SSJ4S OMG YO WTF IS THIS BOTH ARE AMAZING BUT TBH GT GOT IT BEST
proud to be a dragonball fan
I feel you seen them ahead of time reaction seemed a bit forced … dope units nonetheless
Just got to say, went in 800 stones so far, been BLESSED with the summons, already got 3 copies of the units, gonna use my 500 more to get a dupe for godku and god vegeta. Best anni by far for me, hope you all have as good of luck as I've had!
Man forget the 3 guaranteed LRs, all my stones are going to these bad boyssss. As Nano said, "LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
SSG Veget-ASSsSsSsSsS.....
gogeta > vegito
Imagine legends taking a massive L
Ayo I actually got ssj4 goku and vegeta  in the second multi summon
I'm so glad I wasn't the only one saying "That's their 12 ki?!?"
Probably only my gripes but 1. Blue Goku doesn't do the whole square up combo he did on ssj broly, only the final hit. 2. Don't know why they decided to waste a blue gogeta animation
Dang he missed the counter attack animation for Ssj4 gogeta
We don't deserve these!!!!! I wanna cry
The transition from ssj4 Goku and vegeta charging their moves to form gogeta will be the hypest thing on dokkan
THOSE ACTIVES BROOOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
For anyone curious about their calculations immediately without stacking (They both do like 3 supers a turn so the numbers are likely higher if you delay the transformations/fusions):  LR Super Saiyan Gods (unsupported, 24 Ki, w/ LR Blues): 21,734,210 LR Super Saiyan Gods (40% support, 24 Ki, w/ LR Blues): 24,661,371 24 ki (unsupported): 26,411,996 24 ki (40% support): 29,969,161 LR Super Saiyan Blues (unsupported, 24 Ki, w/ LR Blues): 32,013,696 LR Super Saiyan Blues (40% support, 24 Ki, w/ LR Blues): 36,636,592 active turn (unsupported, turn 4): 48,381,498 active turn (40% support, turn 6): 55,367,956   LR Super Saiyans 4s (unsupported, 23 Ki, w/ LR SSJ4 Goku): 21,730,407 LR Super Saiyans 4s (40% support, 23 Ki, w/ LR SSJ4 Goku): 24,657,081 24 ki (unsupported): 26,054,628 24 ki (40% support): 29,563,693  LR Super Saiyans 4 Gogeta (unsupported, 24 Ki, w/ LR SSJ4 Goku): 27,668,735 LR Super Saiyans 4 Gogeta (40% support, 24 Ki, w/ LR SSJ4 Goku): 31,664,259 counter turn (unsupported): 44,957,035 counter turn (40% support): 51,449,085 active turn (unsupported): 47,772,848 active turn (40% support): 54,671,519  LR Super Saiyan Gods (pre-super): 205,336 LR Super Saiyan Gods (post-super): 287,470  LR Super Saiyan Blues (pre-super): 268,112 LR Super Saiyan Blues (post-super): 517,074 LR Super Saiyans 4s (pre-super): 214,285 LR Super Saiyans 4s (post-super): 299,999  LR Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta (pre-super): 279,797 LR Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta (post-super): 539,609    For reference, the previous best card was LR SSJ Goku from 350 Mil, his APT was less than half of the maxed out SSJ4 Gogetta and SSBs(Roughly 20 mil APT)......And that is with his own best circumstances mind you, which aren't easy to obtain either since that is only considering Extreme Class (It's nearly 4 times as strong as Goku when facing Super Class enemies btw)  Even if you do not care about calculations, you have to keep in mind that both of these cards are potentially twice, if not 4 times as strong as strong as the previous best LR in the game...TWICE. AS. STRONG.  There is only one card that can out-damages these guys when transforming immediately and that is STR SV on rotation with TEQ Vegetto (The previous best rotation in the game) and under the 200% lead when getting a *lot* of crit counters, though it is a lot more situational than these new cards
sheeesh bro
Roto scoping is what you were talking about coolers animation
They really out here giving the strongest Monkey the Best animations of all time
Its the movie & non-cannon DBGT vibe with those two
6:39 nano, to answer your question. It is FIRE🔥🔥🔥, that’s what it is
They're okay I expected them to come out of my phone, but I guess this will do.
Gogeta blue active skill 🔥🔥🔥🔥fire
it seems like both units have 2 osts
_9:25__ THE FUCKING OST I NEED IT!_
I wish I could like more than once
These literally left me speechless, RIP my wallet come global anni 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They have multiple osts and they are all godly.
SS4 Gogeta  zig zag they got from legends and the 100x big bang Kamehameha they got from fighterz
IT'S GOGETA SEASON BABYYYYYYY!!!!!!! GOGETA FANS EATING GOOD!!!!!!
Team ssjg
I’ve been waiting for this one!
Best animations in the game!!!!!!!!!
I like to imagine that blue Goku and Vegeta in the 18 ki super are so battle damaged and injured from a saibamen and that they needed to do a galick kamehameha
dude i think a bad thing is too that not only do they look absolutely amazing but theyrr snappy too unbelievably awesome  on a side note im saving ALLmy gems for these 2
Imma start saving my stones for Global🤯
Both of these units are just so insane they leave you speechless these animations are so fireeeee I'm kinda sad that gogeta blue is only an active attack but other than that his active is so clean
I’m all #TeamSSG
These are actually the cleanest fucking animations to date, god I can’t wait for them to come to global
Im ready to skip all the banner. 😂
OMG It's on FIRE 🔥
Ok, I was originally going to say Team SSJ4 because Gogeta (duh), but that active to Gogeta Blue has me switching teams to Team Dontmakemechoose
SHEEEEEEEEEESH
both monke's and God dudes have 3 ost's, all of them is banger
I can’t wait for the full ost’s to released🔥🔥🔥
SSJ 4 has the better animations but I’m going to try to get both just because when the anniversary comes on global
Bro. I’m actually in tears from excitement I’m goin crazy right now.🔥 HYPE 🔥
I’m early what the frick
INJECT THIS INTO EVERY SINGLE PART OF MY BODY! FUCK IT, I'M MAKING A JP DOKKAN ACCOUNT FOR THESE TWO! BRUH, IMAGINE THE PART 2 LRS! THIS ANNIVERSARY IS GOING TO BE THE BEST ONE EVER!
I WANT BOTH
I I’m speechless 😶 🤯
i just got the lr goku and vegeta ssg in 2 summons lol
INSANE
I’m going for ssj4 goku and vegeta when it’s global turn
WHAT ARE THESE ANIMATIONS?, IS THIS REAL LIFE RIGHT NOW?
SSG Vegeta: "This is Dokkans Ass!" 🤣🤣🤣
don't mind me I'm just going to go change my underwear really quick
Nano ssj4 has a counter
I'm trynna see the wins screens
So for super attacks the Gods easily take it. Transformations are pretty even with a slight edge to the Gods again. The active skill however definitely goes to the SSJ4s.
I legit thought they would add intros.
Me: i'm pick The blue boy "Me see the ssj4 goku and vegeta active skill" Me: shit what i'm gonna choose THEY TO GOOD
Nano! GOGETA ALSO HAS COUNTER ANIMATION
Even expecting the best from Dokkan, I still ended up being blown away. What an incredible pair of units my lord.
GOGETA LITERALLY JUST WALKED UP AND RAW LEVEL 7d HIM
BRO THIS SHIT IS INSANE IVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPED FOR A ANNIVERSARY
i only have one thing to say. Dokkan, how the actual FUCK do you plan on topping this?
I just pulled ssg goku & ssg vegeta second multi
I haven't been this excited in years... Brings tears to my eyes of how much dokkan evolved.
Finally also i like how there is so much going on that i don't know what's the active skill or 12 ki :) Also people who don't know that last part i'm being sarcastic. Also love the ost though and the animatinos look great and to top it all of the unit banners will have a different mono unit summonable other then your regular str and agl and stuff as its rare to get hyped for a teq and phy unit and let alone int. But i realize heading towards 2022 we haven't gotten any STR units which is good actually we got to many str units.
This really is peak dokkan it’s been one hell of ride to get here
Crazy how there’s so many animations, btw you actually missed one bc ssj4 gogeta has a super attack counter
BRO THESE ARE ON AN OTHER LEVEL MAN , I LITERALLY WANT BOTH FUSIONS  DAMN BRO WHAT THE HELL DOKKAN JUST WON , EASILY !!!
Yo I wanted goku and vegeta but now I want goku and vegeta omg bro
Bro the blues are the best animations in the game
I'm suddenly glad my phone cnt handle this game and now I'm saving for BLU GOKU AND VEGETA
Gogeta SSJ4 can counter super attack
TIME FOR SHAFT
Just to remind Y'all THIS IS STILL SPRITE ANIMATION
The intros gonna mess me up when attempting speedruns lmaoo
you know I'm surprised nanos trout isn't bleeding
Nano The Whole Video: 0_0    Vegito: When?
HOLY SHIT THESE ANIMATIONS ARE FUCKING 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥. AND I THOUGHT LEGENDS WAS GOOD DOKKAN SENT THIS OUT OF THIS FUCKING WORLD!!! YOU CAN HAVE MY MONEY AND MY SOUL JUST LET ME PULL THESE!!!!! LESSSSSSSSSSS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don’t wanna get my hopes up but I cant wait to see a double vegito celebration
Dokkan over throw legends
Every year, I wonder how they're gonna top the anniversary units from the year before. And then they do something like this. This literally has me speechless.
I'm Team SSJ4 all the way bro. Monke Supremacy is real.
I don't even play Dokkan but this looks way too good
There’s also a counter for ss4 gogeta
TEAM MONKE ALL THE WAY
IM ABOUT TO SCREAM WITHOUT THE S 😤🥵
Epic things are coming, so save up
LORD PLZ HELP ME, I WAS TEAM SSJ4 BUT ARRRRGHHH IM TEAM GOGETA THATS ITS THEY DID BOTH OF THEM JUSTICE
TEAM SSJ4 all the way !
Sweet christ they look so good
Wth😭 is there a point summoning on Global anymore im saving all the way up for these these are fire😭😭🔥
TEAM MONKE
Gogeta blues active skill got me moist🥵🥵
Where's Gogeta's counter animation nano???
4 new osts?
Why does he got Willem Dafoe up in the corner?
I AM SO OUT OF BREATH RIGHT NOW
Dude the blue boys fuse!!
Yay slide shows
The fighterz dramatic finish screen fits well god damn
SSJ4 all the way!
Ssj4 Gogeta will always be my GOATGETA
It’s the fire cracking the ice into the lava scene for me man
Im team ssgss gogeta as cool as ssj4 monke gogeta is i like ssgss gogeta more cause the movie looks so good
Omg Im Just imagining the blue vegito variant with this  blue Gogeta and it’s going to be awesome
Bro….🔥
I'm a Global player
I NEED BOTH OF THEM AS SOON AS THEY COME OUT! THESE ANIMATIONS ARE INSAAAANE
I’m definitely going all out for both of these banners the look so clean💯💯 and also I would say to skip some banners for global so ya can save up stones for their 7th anni. Either way that I hope everyone gets good units and have summon good pulls
NO ONE CAN EVEN PAY ME TO SAY MONKEYS LOOK BETTER THEN GOD AND BLUE!
They straight up put in all the budget into ssj4 Gogeta and I am not even mad
If i want to start to play dokkan, wich version do you recommend, jp or global?
Gods gang
Ssj4gogeta reminds me of str gogeta
the animations are so good im speechless holy
10:40While I don’t mind it that’s just a better version  of the agl gogeta from like 3 years ago.
Usually I scream and shout watching new Dokkan animations. But I teared up seeing these.. can’t believe I’ve been playing this game for 7 years. Since I was a child no less.. god I love Dokkan so much!! 🥺❤️
Literally THE biggest W in Dokkan history these animations are extremely clean slick and just top notch
YEAH ALREADY THE REACTION AND I SHOULD HAVE SLEPT BECAUSE HERE IT'S 6AM BUT F* THAT
They gave these dudes intros😩
I JUST PULLED TWO COPIES OF THE GOKU AND VEGETA SSJG AND A STR BROLY IN ONE MULTIIII
IM DOWN TREMENDOUS I NEED THESE UNITS
Dokkan has been popping off with the animations for a minute now. And it just keeps getting better
This god goku/vegeta card has more effort put into it than some entire shows. Holy hell this is incredible. Can't wait for the release on global!
THE SSJ4 GOGETA ANIMATIONS. EASILY THE BEST IN THE GAME. SAVING EVERY STONE IN GLOBAL NOW
Peak
I don’t say anything but…  HYPE !!!!!!!!!
My money after the banner comes out: good bye, my old friend.
OMG IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS REACT, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
It SUCKS to be a Global player rn
I ain't gonna lie. I think ssb is cooler in the show and everything but they SNAPPED on the SSJ4s
Bro I summoned 2 times and got phy xeno trunks and that's it both times bro I've been grinding all day and that's what I get 😑
Nano: “ThAts ThEir 12 kI??”
Dokkan beats legends all the time
HOLY SHIT
reject godhood return to monke
My jaw hurts from being dropped
When I heard the animations came out Ive been avoiding to watch it until I saw ur reaction Nano Ur reaction just adds more hype!!
Saving for global commences now
You missed ssj4 gogeta counter
Mayne bump super GIVE ME GT
Dokkan has made my mind blown into a million pieces
Im all for team ssj4 monke men
Beyond building different
Dang, animations are absolute fire…but it kinda does hurt to me when it’s a Gogeta only celebration. I know I know, I’m here kinda just bringing down the mood but I’m still hyped nonetheless
Keep in mind that it took reference from a high Quality high budget movie to be better than Gogeta FROM GT. Gogeta is still comparable in animation without having that kind of high tier reference
Why they hold is too good make crying
Dokkan is one of the gacha game that still evolving
Are u sure this is dokkan?
“fusions are boring” damn the silence is real loud rn
Bruh, I stayed up just to see your reaction lmao.
Ss4s for me easily best animations
Monke
SSJ4 Gogeta continuing to be the GOAT mascot for the entirety of GT
I’m team ssg
I believe in MONKE KING supremacy
So ssb gogeta isn't a transformation just an active attack but it's still HYPE!!!!!
Let’s gooooooooo so hyped!!!
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!
I’m too hyped!!
This Actually got me tearing up
broo  I held out on watching them so I could wait for nano
The Road too July has begun boys lets get it!!!!!!!
wait a minute, are we still watching dokkan?
I refreshed this channel 5 times for this
Team monke 🙊
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SUMMON FOR PLS BRO MY HEART CANT TAKE THIS😩😩😩😩
Guys we are litterally back in the OG Gogeta days of dokkan. If your account doesnt have either of these units, your account is garbage
Yeahhh I’m gonna need these units. For sure.
TEAM BOTH
That was incredible. Honestly. They even gave ssj4 gogeta the dramatic finish ending.
O...M...G that all I gotta say nano has said it for us
THE OST          IM GONNNAAA        NNNNNNNNUUUUUUUTTTTTTT
Man i really hate being a global player rn
Sad it’s on JP but good luck to you nano on pulling them!
ssg for life
Put it in my fucking hands right now.
Dude they incorporated Legends SSJ4 Gogeta ult animation into his ultra super, he's the best. I literally don't think they can do better on his animations. he's perfect.
“You sussy sussy devs” 😂😂😂
I literally had chills watching these super attacks
I creamed like 12 times man         🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ngl I came  But more then that I screamed while doing it Idk what to summon for because  LR Brolys animations are probably gonna go wild just like these😭😭😭😭
My jaw open the entire time
This is the first video that I've seen from a minute ago
NANO WHY WOULD YOU SPOIL YOURSELF INSTEAD OF WAITING 😭
Nano The OST is 🔥💯
These units are snapped and look so amazing but I still can't play it Caz I have no money to buy a new tablet to play it again sucks not having a job or income
121 stones wish me luck when they drop lmao. Going for SSJ4’s
STR Gogeta Blue has finally been surpassed in animation
Team ssj4 all the way bro
Damn all Look so goood
Team ssj4
Imma be summoning for Gogeta.
Dokkan has the best animation
Well the lr ssj 4s are better animations then most of dragon ball super
The best celebration needed the best animations
NANO THEY FINALLY DID THE SSJ4 JUSTICE AFTER YEAR 4
I’ll admit is super Saiyan four Goku and Vegeta look amazing but super Saiyan god Goku and Vegeta look immaculate they transform twice this is the first time we ever seen an LR do this it looks so beautiful i’m lost for words
2:30 roto-scoping
I just summon and just got LR God in my 2 summon
Stone check: I am at 510
Lets goooo!!!
Gogeta’s 18 KI is so stunning
Global players crying in the club rn
Finally been waiting for him to see his reaction to this when it released.
THEY REALLY OUT DONE THEMSELVES
These animations are fire! Was waiting for the Nano reaction!
I have no words to describe these animations and I can't wait for you to use them!!!
Don't worry nano, we couldn't wait either.
7 years of Dokkan battle and I’m glad I’m still able to see you react to these 😭
LET'S GOOOOOOOO!!! TEAM BOOOOOOTH!! I WANTED SAIYAN SAGA AND COMPLAINED ABOUT FUSIONS BUT THEY MADE A BELIEVER OUT OF ME!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THAT DRAGON FIST IS CLEAN AS FLIIIIIIIIP!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   Just finished seeing all the attacks and animations..... This is the best anniversary in Dokkan history. EASILY.
Daam they fire
No one has finishing this video but since I'm here #teamssg
Fierro pariente nanogenix
We technically got double Gogeta big W
Anni making me redownload, also  Team Cherry Bois!
You love to see it, your wallet however does not
I don't know how dokkan keeps doing it but at certain points I somehow forget that I'm not watching an anime with parts of the super attacks. Just think back in the day all we had were basic Kamehameha waves and look now. Full blown anime cutscenes in a mobile game
Also team God I’m sorry Ik ssj4 animations look better but I gotta stay loyal to my red and blue boys
I'm not gonna cap. I can't decide who to go for😭
#TeamSsj4
This is The BEST ANNIVERSARY IN DOKKAN HISTORY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉 WHEN I SAW THE SA ATTACKS ,ACTIVES  ....I Cried 😭
difficult choice, but in this case ssj4
Never been this early before, what’s up nano! Been watching your stuff since 2016, love it bro keep up the good energy! ✊🏼💪🏼
DOUBLE GOGETA THIS ANIVERSIARRY IS BUSTED
Hypeeeee
GOGETA BLUE WHATTTTTTT
here early
Can I honestly say they absolutely popped off like this is not dokkan this is honestly GT but better DBS Broly but just on the point of animation
LETSS GOOOOOO
:))
Let's go
GOGETA HAS THE BEST ANIMATIONS BRO!!! AND THE OST MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE!! I'M SO HYPED! 😍😍😍
The super attacks of both are just crazy and amazing good luck to everyone on Jp summoning for both of them 🔥🔥🔥😤
