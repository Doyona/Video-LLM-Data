THANK YOU FOR HELPING US FEED PEOPLE!
0:47 did anyone see the turky crying???
As of 0:20AM on November 27 I got recommended  this video we are familiar with.
This is so important right now, people in America are suffering. Snap and WIC. Now our government is making people reapply for benefits. It's really sad that so much food insecurity is in the USA right now. It has never been this bad In our country. Taking food away from the poor.
Your generosity and humanitarian work are truly inspiring.Thank you, MrBeast, for standing beside those in need. May your actions continue to inspire many others best wishes to you.
Amazing job, keep it up.

Que lindo video, labores y Proyectos,,, 💛💛💛🦃🦃🦃
Mr. Beast has released a total of 1,352 videos across his 5 channels so far today! I am so fascinated by these videos that I've decided to start watching all of Mr. Beast's videos from last 19–08–2024 and I hope to finish watching all of them within the next 3 months! I've set a target to watch 20+ videos per day and this is my 506th video since starting the journey!  Today's date: 22–08–2024
Фільм цікавий.Але оця людська жадність до багатства,брехні просто вбиває.Актори красиві,море,природа.Дякуютим,хто створив цей фільм.
I Think Mr.beast Makes $100,000 Look like ¢00.01 Who Agrees! 👇

I saw video and it's the dumbest way to cancel Mr. Beast and one of the vegetarians wants to cancel him for For not giving everyone a veggies that's the stupidest way to cancel mister beast not everyone is a vegetarian 🙄😒
The vegand he like: disgusting mr.beast give them vegetables instead
hate how greedy people are, but great job Jim
Thank you Milad
Disgusting 🤮 🤮 🤮  At one point you seem to care so much about animals, making sure so many dogs live a good life. Yet here you are making 10,000 animal lives a misery. might be giving a 30 minute meal to people, but you are taking the _lives_ of those who did nothing wrong. Throughout a turkey's life they are veiwed as a mere object. They have nothing, nothing except for their life which even so, is taken from them via a roticary blade which is brought across their neck. To most it seems as if you have "given" 10,000 things, however they don't know that you have _taken_ 10,000 lives that were never yours to give...😪
🦃🦃Happy Thanksgiving 🍽️ 🦃🦃

Mr Beast my husband needs your help!!! We live in Oregon and he ended up in a wheelchair because of COVID-19. He had to go into a coma in 2019 and it lasted 3 months and then he woke up completely paralyzed!! Please Mr Beast I just want to help him walk again!!! He needs help to find the right doctors and facilities to help treat him on his journey to recovery. It might take 10 years before he can walk again, but with your help he could walk in 5 years!!! I've messaged this channel on Instagram before, and I've made a comment a while back. I'm going to keep trying to get your attention!!! Please Mr Beast! Help my husband @JonathanVanVlietOregon

It’s awesome that jimmy can do this. one thing i noticed was that almost all the cars coming through the food drive are way nicer than any car my parents ever owned. my mom bought her first “new” car 2 years ago and it’s a 2010 volvo suv, yet 60% of these ppl are driving 2015 and newer cars…how?
So good mrbeast team very nice work
Amazing God bless 💕

Thank you millan ❤️
THANK YOU  MILAD!!!!!!
imagine how turkeys died
I totally respect Jimmy , Mrbeast and what every one of his organisations do so this is not aimed at MrBeast but the people driving expensive cars waiting to get 5 Turkeys... .. Jimmy mentions at the start giving away to "people in Need" the people who truly needed a decent Turkey or Thanks giving dinner are the ones that could not get to their Turkey Giveaway Stations , the ones that don't drive or have transport those who can't afford a car... .
Why does everyone in my school say bad things about jimmy
vegan be like: AJWJAKDJAHODNADAODAUHD ???? AKKANDNAK *full of complaint*
I love your videos they are so good
10000 turkey died 😢
I regularly watch your YouTube - Facebook posts from the small country of South Asia, Bangladesh 🇧🇩 I am a big fan of your teams generosity.  May God grant you long life, Ameen. Lets changed the World.
COOL VIDEO MRBEAST!! 😃
I have a question, how are this people 'in need',[all of them have cars] , I literally saw a mercedes at 2:34
Funny that it can also be named as brutally  I killed 10000 innocent animals for Thanksgiving
Thank you Jimmy and MILAD ❤❤❤❤
Thank you Milad!!!
Msterbest ven a colombias😊
What are they doing in the end?
Thank you Milad and Mr Beast and the all volunteer team
Lol the thamnail kina looks the other way around
5 turkeys duh blackkkkk anything free they’re there
MrBeast is so kind to those people need she will help them when they’re homeless build 10 houses it’s just so nice there’s nothing bigger than his money but his heart is
Thank you Milad !!!
Thank you  Milad
This is disgusting, killing innocent animals for food and festival... but coming to sense , thanksgiving is a festival of remembering mass homicide by white men of scotland and england.. so allz good
Vegan teacher is NOT gonna be happy about this one lol

Thankyou Milad!!
It's great to help out, however, when you just announce IT'S FREE and Mr Beast is there you'll more likely to have people turn up who don't really need a free turkey. Let's face it the guy who asked for five is eating one and selling the other 4 for $20's each.
Ay love you mrbeast ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Vegan Teacher: 😧😧 😤😤😤😤 😠😠😠😠 🤬🤬🤬🤬 👿👿 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀

Thx Milad
Thank you milad
I don't get it (I mean I do but for arguments sake). A turkey costs what like $10, you would spend more or equivalent on petrol especially with the wait. The are waiting for a 20k pay out their not hungry people, look at the cars. Kids these days (:P) need to THINK, why is he doing this, is it actually helping. To be fair I was once young and stupid
Thank you Millad
Watching these videos makes me happy. Thank you.

I know I’m probably looking like a fool. And I know you’ll never see this but I’m behind on rent and feel like dying it really sucks. I was in the hospital and my girlfriends the only one who works and it really really sucks and I feel like a coward. If you do happen to see this it would mean the world to me. I only need 1,700. I know I’m stupid for even trying this.

Thank you so much for.what you do. I am sorry but in 2023 no one in this world.should be going to bed hungry or working families still struggling to feed their kids. I personally work 50 hrs a week and many nights go without myself to be sure my kids bellies are full. Their school district is also shaming kids for "owed accounts" in front of other kids. The system in which society operates is disgusting. But people like you keep my faith in humanity!

It is common knowledge that a typical Thanksgiving dinner is sometimes far from cheap and this uplifting youtube video shows a multiple number of people obviously enjoying what they are being given.

Mr Beast I love you very much, you are my idol I don't know where you came from but you help many people (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)
Hello, I live in turkey, my country is shaking with a very bad earthquake intensity right now, there are a lot of homeless and a lot of hungry people, there are people outside, I can't help these people, at least if I can convey this to you, maybe you can help. I know you won't see my yes or not message but I still want to try my luck. I'm fine, my family is good, my relatives are fine, but my friends are in a very bad situation, I feel very sorry for them, I want to help them. Please see this message of mine.

I am now homeless on account of unfortunate circumstances... my kids had to go live elsewhere and I'm on the street PLEASE HELP ME DUDE
Growing up my dad's work always gave each employee a turkey. When my step mom got the job she has currently she started getting a turkey every year. We'd normally give one turkey to a local family in need and make the other for Thanksgiving.  Now my boyfriend's job gives vouchers for 20lb turkeys. They don't expire, we lost ours last year but had Thanksgiving with his family and his mom also had a 20lb turkey voucher from work. We get another voucher this year. The plan is to make a turkey and donate a turkey.

Jennie-O and its mother company Hormel Foods Corporation donated as much money as they would have used for a tv ad.  Let's not forget that they have been tried in court for price fixing. This is the same bullshit that rockefeller did.  Do some public stunts so that no one thinks about that workers are  exploited and worker friendly  regulations are abolished.
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!!!!! 🗣🗣
This video is disgusting as being a vegan I cannot believe that this man is giving away 10,000 turkeys this is a animal Holocaust you are disgusting

Thank You Milad!
Lol be the first to abolish the lame ars “charity” system and exchange it with permanent solutions , like: open some type of factory, hire the people in need , let them run it. Take 10% of the profit and let them take the rest. Start with one in every state. Then if it works  start doing it in every town that needs the help. and No matter what business it is. as long as it’s run by the people and for the people it’ll work out. Keep doing that until we get everyone on this planet to middle class. You’ll be a trillionair by 40 and have the peeps backin’ 🤣
i hope the vegan teacher dont watch this vid
"people in need" XD people in need don't have such cars...
I'm a bit late but maybe this year Jimmy should recreate the ending to the muppets Christmas Carol So instead of raiding places with a hundred dinosaurs he raids places with a hundred muppets whilest giving away food

Me just  causey dressed up as a turkey looking at turkey *meat*:My FAMILY everyone just eating us:MMm mmm mmmmm! Juicy turkei
ehm if you drive a new truck with an ATV loaded onto it, I don't think you should line up for a food bank @0:30
i think getting 5 turkeys is just bad. i don't care if you don't have the money its just using other peoples good will for your benefit. just take 1 and leave
Goodbye nolan we will miss you😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The veagen teacher:😟😨😠
I like turkey/chicken with gravy. Well done for feeding the nation with turkey mrbeast, thats another very nice thing you've done with donations and stuff :) . EVERYONE LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU LIKE GRAVY!!!!!!

Do you ever get the feeling that branding everything you do, posting it on YouTube, etc does more harm than good?  It doesn't take long for your videos to look like advertising for your brand as opposed to doing the most good without shamelessly plugging that fact.

The poor 10,000 turkeys
Everyone watching this video is going to die at some point and each of you will answer to God for every idle word spoken, deed done by your hands and the motivation behind it.  Now, the evidence for this is that even if you say you don't believe me, your conscience bears witness that I speak the truth and you know there is a creator to whom you will answer to one day. Are you ready? Your "good actions" you rely on are detestable to God, lest you try to negotiate your way into Heaven. Only by grace and through faith shall you receive salvation.  Seek Christ while you still can, only He can forgive your sins. Repent and be born again, of water and the Holy Spirit. I say this without judgement and in absolute love when I tell you that Jesus is the light of the world, in Him there is no darkness...
Very Awesome

I volunteer for a food bank, and if you’ve never done it, you might think that this is easy. But keep in mind, you’re doing this for hours, you’re constantly moving crates and all that, stocking up, bringing people stuff, it’s not easy work. You gotta have a certain level of fitness.

Hi Mr Beast , I am Tashrique Benjamin a subscriber to your channel and I really love your videos and see all the good that you are doing and think that it's amazing that somebody actually has the heart that you do .  I'm a College Student an unemployed one might I add and I've recently been robbed of my smartphone and laptop and it's been hard try to get the money or a job in order to get back what I lost. I know these few things might sound like dumb stuff , but I actually seriously do need it because like I said I'm a college student and it's very essential.  I just wanted to know I there was anything I could do , a job or anything, that would help me with this please .
Feed them!!!

Commenting to trick YouTube so you can give more money away!
times the word “turkey” was said in the vid: 33
3:22 I thought it was a monster in there
Someone: *Says turkey in theyre sentence* Me: Turkey and turkey the country????
The idea is good but 10,000 turkeys is a lot.. and not in a good way. One moment you plant 20 million trees and the ne t killing 10,000 turkeys for a video? This doesn’t seem very ethical, and this is a charity. Why not give food  less harmful to the environment insead?

hello mrbeast It is a pleasure to greet you, I hope you are well, I hope I do not bother you I am sending you this message to offer you some images inspired by you, perhaps they are not the great images that your designers can make, but I made them with dedication and, at the same time, you can give them a use since they were also designed with the intention of serving you in some of your projects in some of your t-shirts, mugs or any product that you want to use them and if you don't use them you can keep them as a souvenir that with the acquisition of these images you support a Mexican family to be able to move forward. Hoping not to cause you any inconvenience, I wish you and your team a great day, keep making great videos, take care And keep it up you are great mrbeast. We are in contact and thank you for the time you took to answer please support me Thanks   For plis

I love the thought of Mr beast help  with turkeys for about 10,000 families but the fact that a huge amount of the animal is being killed to feed the family makes me feel bad for the animal I really love mr beast but please try focusing on feeding people by giving some vegan food  And if you think of it that way, you will be seen as a person who doesn't only care about human's lives but even animal's lives kind of   I hope you think about this Mr beast with lots of love,I hope you will find a better version of yourself  All the best and thanks a lot for thinking about the poor and the needy one's (P.S idk which animal a Turkey is, im a vegetarian)
Jimmy I like you and you save humanity but I noticed you've murdered 10,000 animal lives

Hello Mr. Beast (Jimmy) I am from Russia, I started watching you with and without subtitles for a very long time, I have one request for you: my dad works 11 hours all day and even on weekends we want to save up for a house, but dad has a big loan and he needs money, if you don't mind help us, we are happy for every penny
Thank you milad 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Si me dieras un reto , de viajar hasta el programa de Mr. Beast ,  no importa el reto que me ponga Jimmy Donaldson , lo cumpliré así como lo hacen Chadler , Chris , Karl (me gustan sus videos y estoy suscrito a todas sus redes de YouTube y quisiera probar el nuevo  " Feastables de Mr Beast -Bar- ") Mí sueño sería conocerlos y salir en uno de sus videos , Soy de Perú , tengo 30 años y parezco de  25 años , cuando veo sus videos digo cómo quisiera estar allí , me supongo que otros suscriptores también se sienten igual , ojalá que mí mensaje les pueda llegar , Un Fuerte Abrazo  desde Perú , lo queremos muchos y suscribanse a Mr Beast.

Day 167 watching the entire channel. 1/25/22
good stuff
THANK U MILLAD U LEGEND
Videos like this feel bittersweet. Because its purely amazing how much is accomplished here. But i wish everyone out there was focused on more then entertainment on youtube. My parents and grandmother work tirelessly at a nonprofit called school connect that works with kids-but rarely get more than 10 views on a video. I just wish it was possible for everyone to overcome the want to just relax, and spend that couple minutes helping people who truly need it.
😂😂 No entiendo el ingles pero me encanta el video 😂😂
Such a nice guy

I like Mr. beast because he cares about so many people and he gets food for the charity
Jimmy/mrbeast is a good person because he started as all the other youtubers but he was sad he said that has roommate chis left and he was stuck in his room editing his videos so he stop making videos than started giving out my money but he is a little Harsh with his challenges but he still gives money to who win and loses than he started with the Charity and help people in need like the gave a homeless guy a house and all the stuff jimmy/mrbeast gives like a private island a tesla a mansion jimmy pays the tax’s for all of it and you think that people can Pay for a private island a private jet a Tesla and a mansions no jimmy pays for it So don’t put the negatives on Jimmy’s /Mr. beast he does everything that no you YouTuber does

I was a kid in a starving family when I was young, trust me, our only food concerns was getting food, we didn't give a damn what it was as long as it was edible. Thank you for helping the unfortunate. Trust me when I say, they couldn't give a damn what it was. Only half of one percent of the USA population — or 1.62 million, is Vegan, that's .05% the other 99.5% is ecstatic and not whining about it.
F all this vegans I be eating chickens nd cows and all that yummy
Thank you Mald！！

Ty malad ldk if l said it right
GUYS i think we should cancel Mr beast i can't believe he would dare BRUTALLY AND HORRIBLY MURDER 10k turkeys with HIS OWN BEAR HANDS we should cancel him then move on to only eating vegetables like baked potat-
There is a lot of vegans out there that hate Mr beast for this but some vegans are nice and are proud of this work
I'm watching the entire channel. 1/5/22 D;150
im sure im gonna get alot of hate for this.  but if you are such a good person, why do you need to post it online? i would have alot more respect for you  and your actions if you didn't feel the need to post a 100 videos bragging about giving money to people.  let me read it from a journalist who on their own found out.

hi mrbeast I introduce myself I am Jean Christler a teenager who lives in the only less developed countrie of america I really like watching your videos they make me laugh a lot and give me hope that one day I will have a hundredth of your kindness. Sometimes it's extremely hard for me not to stop myself from crying because a few months ago I allowed my father to leave and in the country where I find myself it doesn't help. I ask you just for the idea of ​​a video if could come to help the hundreds of thousands of children in my country who cannot eat or drink as they should even though they are only 1 to 17 years old even though you do not help them all at least a small number of them would be good because the tears in the eyes as only defense I beg you to give them a tiny part of your time which will save a lot of them sincerely and from the bottom of the thank you for giving me a little bit of hope and good continuity in what you do. Her children live in Haiti. I hope you will read this message and think about it thank you very much peace, health and love for this new year cordially one of your fans of Haiti.
Happy New Year Mr Beast 🎉

Thanks Milad
I really don’t get why Jimmy gets so much hate it’s as if people think he’s worshiping the devil or something and anyone hating on him for helping people should really stop to think of how Jimmy is helping all these people during thanksgiving and the rest of the year whereas any of you haters reading this are complaining about the kindness of other people in the world all while doing absolutely nothing with your life. I know I should have kept out of this drama but it breaks my heart seeing that such a nice person is receiving all of this hate for giving people food. Anyways sorry this comment is late I kinda struggled to find a device which let me comment and if your seeing this Jimmy keep up the good work!

such a waste he could have given it all to people in need
thank you miladddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
Milad thx so much
Thank you malad
Thank you mlad

Screw the Karens! Do what you do best all of us believe in you!
I don't think those people really need those turkey... Except them, they would have helped to the homeless people..😑🙄
i watched this vid 100 times becouse it feed people :)
Why in the hell are people mad that he did this, like sure 10k is a lot of turkeys, but it’s not like mans had this company slaughter 10k turkeys on the spot. These turkeys were probably already dead. And idgaf if I get hate. It’s just my opinion
Don't know why people don't like him giving away turkeys he still did more goods deeds then bad in fact he did no bad

No hate but isn't 10,000 turkeys 10,000 brids right
all you vegan haters straight🤡🤡🤡🤡
If animals weren't meant to be eaten by humans..  *Then why are they made out of food?*
Vegans litteraly are monsters they want people to starve and eat veggies like a peasant but that wont stop Mr.Beast from being a good person.I mean do you know why he planted trees for each dollar in the first place?I mean like do vegans want earth to die thanks to global warming?Vegans just dont understand Jimmy isn't just a youtuber and gives money away.         HE IS GOD
To the annoying vegans: The world doesn't revolve around your ideas. Other people aren't vegans and have the right to do things you might disagree with. Turkey is a tradition and families eating the veggies which you said could feed more families would still be a miserable thanksgiving for them.
Their happiness is Jimmy happiness

Thank you milard !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thx milad
To be honest I thought he said turnips 😂
Thanks Milad
Your so kind
You ARE AMAZING and my favourite YouTuber of all time.
Thank you so much for using your situation to help people in need. Beautiful to see again and again that there's so much good in the world. However, giving away 10'000 Turkeys is pretty stupid. You're trying to help animals in need in one video, then in the next video you get 10'000 animals killed. 10000 turkeys eat so much food in their lifetime, 100'000 people could be fed with it (wild guess but it's an optimistic one, since with chicken you lose 87% of the calories in the farming-process). So either this hasn't crossed you're mind, or you've got a pretty dumb excuse for helping a company killing our environment and calling it philanthrophy... ^^  This is not meant rude or so! It's just my perspective with the information I got.
Thank you milad
Thank u Milad!!!!
Thank you Jimmy to give away food to people
yay
Turkies prob ran out abt Mr.Beast loves

Bro can you stop looking like your ready to take one in the mouth in every thumb?
What a saaaaad day for turkeys
Thank you milaad
Amazing
damn lol, there is alot of conflict between vegans and the community, personnaly i dont believe in the vegans statements. jesus fed thousands of people birds and fish. the majority of the globe is still on a meat and plant based diet as well.
Thank you milad
Thank you millad
You slaughtered 10 thousand birds you homophobe
you are awesome!
get mlad in a challenge
Thanks milad how did u donate that much??
People saying ten thousand corpses for like ten thousand family's fed
thank u milad
Thanck you millllaaassssssdddddsssss
Thank you Milad!
My uncle is in the vid !!!!! 😱😱😱
Hope he doesn’t get hate form Twitter stans ;-;
Can you show me your income vs spending spreadsheet??? What is the RATIO of what you give out compared to what you earn?? I'm not accusing you of anything, but I would REALLY like to make sure you ARE a nice guy, and not just a good marketer.  Usually. A certain ratio of admin fees to actual help given is expected. I<m hoping you are a decent person., BUT, since you are doing this PUBLICLY and surely making SOME profits. It's understandable to want to check the ACTUAL help you give.  You SHOULD have zero worries and be very happy to oblige, UNLESS...  You COULD try to do a Jim Jordan and say you have nothing to hide, but refuse to give the facts. But then your reputation and future earning potential COULD be affected. It only takes ONE bad thing to wreck a good scam. SO COME ON!!! How much do you MAKE out of those things you GIVE? Show us how GOOD HEARTED you are...  I'm REALLY hoping you ARE a great guy that thinks OTHERS before himself. Nothing would make me happier. But you DO realize why I ask, right? So many bad people out there.
Funny number
Thank you Milad!!

Thank you Mr Beast, you are a blessing to these people. Also thanks volunteers and Mlad.
Thank you milad
I wish I got a Turkey but I live in California
good boi :)
Thank you millad
I love that you have fed so many people, but the mass-farming of animals needs to stop. Factory farming is horrific. I'm not vegan, but even a little bit of research into factory farming is enough to make anyone cry for days. Watch a few videos...
Poor turkeys. Doubt they lived a decent life if they were farmed on that scale. Probably crammed into small pens or cages... all for what?
RIP nolen
Vegan teacher is fuming with rage by now But really why cant she just say thank you for helping 10000 people?
🙂
i REALLY hope that vegan teacher doesnt see this
I’m a farmer myself and for all you vegans most turkeys will die before 1 month without medicine and most turkeys would be painfully torn apart by a coyote with his is less painful than being shot with a high caliber rifle.
Thank you Millard
Please can you gift me a PS  as christmas gift😪😪
This guy fed 1 million people ---> https://youtu.be/BBJa32lCaaY
Thanks Millán
:D
Like I only came to this video because another video popped up in my recommendations about how "Vegans are trying to cancel Mr. Beast for giving away turkey".  ……………………………………………………………. WHY THE FUDGE IS EVERYONE OF THOSE VEGANS BEING STUPID?!?!?  It is not like Mr. beast drove around giving 10,000 people horse manure to eat. Not everyone in the world is vegan so at the end of the day I doubt much of that Turkey found itself inside a vegans home. So it was all most likely enjoyed and eaten by a meat lover family who really do not need Vegans stepping in to Try to cancel the big bad Mr. Beast who gave them food for the holiday.  When you consider the fact of how nice Mr. Beast is, any vegan he approached with a Turkey could of politely declined and he would of walked away.
thank you milad
Thanks Milan
Great great job guys. God Bless you, but persons in need with a F150 truck…. I dont know rick

I respect Jimmy he killed 10k turkeys  and gave them away
it's great that he's feeding people but did he really have to do it with turkeys? does nobody give a crap about animals? they were abused and murdered so people could eat them and didn't deserve it.
Wow

Honestly Jimmy what you are doing is really amazing! I know you are getting some hate from alot of vegans or vegetarians. But I say this that God made those turkeys to be eaten. And I assure you that those turkeys are not going to waste. Honestly I wish we had someone like you around when times were tough for our family. So it honestly makes me smile seeing people who need it. Get some food for the holidays. God bless and keep being kind

So where were the vegan jokes? Didn’t not hear one. Any of you vegans who will lie & try to harass Mr. Beast because he gave out turkeys on Thanksgiving & not vegan edible food, you are sick, you are self-centered only seeking attention & the justification to be able to harass people into accepting & submitting into your individual reality & set of beliefs. To who this may concern, You’re an awful person.
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy thanks giving

God bless everyone in need!
This. This is what should be done with success and fame. Noblesse oblige, it is the responsibility of those with to help those less fortunate. You are a king Mr. Beast, and a man amongst men.
Jimmy is just out here being so kind but yet he still gets hate for what? Giving away free turkeys? 🤨
Thank You Milad!!!!!
thank you jimmy for helping tons of people in need\

Thank you Milad
Thank you matle
Thank you for feeding people in need. That's awesome!
Ok to those hating on Mr beast about how he killed 10, 000 turkeys and everything else.  It gonna be a long one but. Mr beast is a kind person. How does someone become famous by giving away money and free things and being kind to everyone around him. You vegans think its rude to kill an animal well what if i told you its literally impossible to be fully vegan your ancestors killed an animal so how are you gonna hate on someone that killed 10k turkeys when your ancestors did worst. Im not saying im better or anything but my ancestors definetly killed turkeys but its not like they wanted them dead its simple us humans need food to survive so we need to get our nutrients. In conclusion Mr beast is awesome🗣🤘👍
This is legit one of the coolest challenges Jimmy has done ✅ this was very good of Jimmy
Thank you Milad!!  rip Nolan 2021

You know im not a vegan but all i can think about is that hes just casually giving out 10,000 turkeys. Like wtf does that even look like if they were alive.
Thank you Milad ❤
Some people just don't get how nice you are don't even worry about the bad comments
iuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
PLEASE GIVE ME SHOUT-OUT😭😭
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is amazing, thank you Mr Beast! And certainly thank you Milad and everyone who helped. <33
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You and Milad, as well as all the volunteers, did an incredible job for people this year!  I love that philanthropy has become your sustained passion, and you now have a channel dedicated to working w/ various brands to assist you in helping others in need.  Being of service to others is truly work that only certain people are capable of doing, and I'm really glad that someone w/ your platform and reach is one of those people.  You inspire a lot of others, as well, which is incredibly important for making these efforts sustainable.  Thank you for the work you do and the difference you make in so many lives.
this is sad R.I.P nolan
Sorry @MrBeast but this video isn't s good statement for the planet when a lot of (big) cars comming for free turkeys. Plant based would have been better. Instead he could have organised a huge dinner for thousend of thousend homeless people...
RIP TURKEYS
THANK YOU MILAD
THANK YOU MILAD
“cancel him all those turkeys were killed for this video 🤓🤓🤓🤓”
Being vegan is Worst
Thank you Millad! Thank you Mr. beast! Thank you to all of the people that helped and donated and good people in the world that make things like this happen!
Thank you MILADD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MrBeast is a good guy in general, but in this video he gives 10,000 turkeys to families  which means 10,000 sentient deaths.  He could have fed them a plant based alternative he couldve fed them a soy based alternative he coudve also gotten a vegan turkey which is healthier  So my idea is that you fed 10,000 families but paid for the killing of 10,000 more turkeys  Would you rather kill 10,000 turkeys, feed 10,000 poor families, or feed 10,000 families without killing 10,000 turkeys Tough question? NOW I am not trying to be annoying but to explain the basic idea here.
Thank you miladin
thank u mlad
Imagining being a kid and going to school and being able to say I got a Thanksgiving dinner from Mr beast
This channel just got 6.9 million subs. Funny number
HOW DARE HE GIVE PEOPLE FREE FOOD! THE AUDACITY!!!

Thank You Milad!!!!!!!!!!

I love you Jimmy but 10000 turkeys isn’t that just killing turkeys alit of them
CANT WAIT FOR VEGANS TO GET MAD AT THIS BRO
To the vegans that are mad at Jimmy for this, F@$& em
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It’s so dumb how jimmy can feed a city and the whiny vegans get mad it wasn’t tofu 🙄.
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!!!
Thank you Makand
This is amazing!!!
Thank you milad!!!!!
Wow dis mrs vegan teacher is going to cry so much she would die
He didn't make even close to the amount of money he spent on this video. He deserves likes, subs and views. So PLEASE share, like, and subscribe. I'm just saying he deserves it. It's free.
Ok
Thank u millaad
Milad is super cool for donating, props to him 👏🏻👏🏻
Bye bye nolan rip

Rip nolan lol
Thank you mead!,!!!
Thank you Milad!
lol vegans are so mad
Thank you Milaaaad
Of course the intention was good but those turkeys suffered for the entirety of their short life-span before they were brutally killed... you wouldn't pay for cats or dogs to be hung up and have their throats slit so why do so for other animals who can also feel pain..?
Thank you 🙏🏻 Millad
Watching every video 50 times so he can help out people
tnk u milad
Yoru is very big hart sir ❤️❤️❤️❤️
People can’t even say thank you in this generation. Everything Jimmy did was donate tons of money that no one would ever do.
all vegans will unite
thank you Milad

Hi
Jimmy, do you get more money when people watch the adds through? Or is it the same if I skip at 5seconds?  Want to contribute as much as possible.. but I hate ads lol
Thank you Malachi!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!
The thing the world should be thankful for is Mr. Beast.  And Milad. Thank you, Milad
Thank you mr beast, thank you milad
A lot of people say that people like him use their benevolent activities just to make more money, and while it is not necessarily wrong, just look at the outcome. The world would be a much better place if we had more people like him doing this stuff, even if it was solely for the money.

My country needs a mr beast
Well done Team Beast! That's a lot of bellies filled with good food 🤗 Wish we had people like you in our country though (The Netherlands). But no one cares here sadly. One day, if I become fitlhy rich, I'm definitely gonna give stuff away to people in need 🤪 The happiness and gratefulness from all the people is so awesome!  Anyway, loved watching it again. Keep up the good work my guy!
thankiuu milad !!!!
I love you brother good evening
huge , so much respect 🙏
Vigan be like '' this is murder ''
People that can have cars are not in poverty. A car is a luxury still right 🤔 I was raised in poverty and I can tell you these people on Camera maybe in 'Poverty' but they just think they are and believe their own sob story and the ones that really need the help don't have cars
thank you malad
Mr beast is the kindesss human being in the world
CAN ANYONE PLEASE DONATE ME MONEY FOR MY EDUCATION 😔😭 MAYBE MY FUTURE DEPENDS ON YOU 😔🙏🙏

Mrbeast am from albania but I like your videos
Generally I don’t think he can run for president, the reason being is he’s probably to nice to fund any campaigns that discourage voting for the opposition.

السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ  Mr beast
SOME people waited for hours in line, wasting dollars in petrol just to get a cheap turkey. Logic of todays 'poor' people with cars.
Nice friends
I hate the idea of comparing a human to a turkey because you can't say they are the same. Humans are intelligent creatures who build skyscrapers and figure out secrets of the universe, and how are you gonna say that our lives are just as important as 10k turkeys.  1 person in the comments related Mr beast "killing" the turkeys (which missed the point of the video, he's giving out the turkeys to save people from buying one, and being easier to feed their families) to the holocaust, which is horrific because how you going to compare humans to turkeys when like 6 million innocent people were killed in the holocaust, and compare that to 10 thousand birds.   at the end of the day, we are at the top of the food chain, and we can decide what's moral and immoral. we decided that killing and eating dogs is not ok (in most parts of the world) because we form emotional connections with the dogs, people can have emotional connections with chickens but never as strong as more normal pets. the difference between killing a bird is that it's a bird that is ok to eat, and no one is gonna stop up because that's what we like to eat, and we can because we're on the top of the food chain.   I do agree that we should be killing fewer animals, but not stop eating them. the only reason I'm saying to slow down the killing of those animals is my human reaction (along with most people) we like to empathize with others, not with singular turkeys, but when you think about millions being killed without lives to live it's just sad to think about  TLDR: we should continue to eat animals (because we're on the top of the food chain), because they are not the same as humans, but should slow down and moralise the system in which we get that meat; because of our empathetic human nature.
I will donate 10,000

From what my roommate told me we were actually really close to not getting a thanksgiving turkey this year and we live in North Carolina near where you do this stuff. Apparently we got lucky and someone sent her the money to get a turkey, and it fed a house of 3 adults and 1 kid for 3 or 4 days. Imagine how long you just fed everyone in those cars.
This is just awesome.

Bravo 👏👏👏👏
ok hear me out, guest hosts! watching some of my favourite youtubers shift boxes would actually be pretty entertaining, it would also mean mr beast himself doesnt have to be in the video to drive traction giving him more time to pay the bills. like imagen critikal, someordanry gamer or one of the paul brothers? i dont even like logan or jake but I'd watch them on this channel. FUCK IT ELON MUSK GET DOWN HERE WITH THE BILL NAMETAG!
Why doesn't MrBeast set this up like a charity giving organisation, he already has merch and revenue going to charity he may as well accept donations just constantly from subscribers, like an open charity, but instead he holds the money to donate to specific charities at specific times. When they most need it.
Thank you Millad!!!!!!!!!And you are doing a great job Jimmy 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏and happy thanksgiving to you also
More than 10k souls died because of you
I love what u r doing I almost cryed in the last video and this 1 did not disappoint
New sub 10,000 for me right yahh
Hey Mrs beast I have a suggestion can you visit other countries that would be great content I haven't seen you travel ! 🎥✨
Thank you Milad!!!
I did not join and ur maniac
I just watch the ads fully
THANK YOU MILLAD
To all the goddam vegans who are complaining that he could have gave the people vegetables instead of turkeys  BE HAPPY THAT HE ATLEAST FED 10K PEOPLE ( he probably has done more charity than all of yall combined)
The fact that this channel doesn't have as much subscribers as the other chan else is almost heartbreaking. It's amazing that Jimmy is doing all these wonderful and caring things for others and it needs more *positive* attention <that's right, I'm looking at you, Twitter 🗿>
My man Milad tho! 👏👏
Thank you Millard
Can you give me a laptop pls
Nice
No Turkeys we’re harmed while making this video
thankyou milad!
Sir if you have extra iphone please give me one.
Thank you man you do inspire people
Jimmy actually is making the right use of YouTube
He does such a good job helping people, and I love it. but imagine getting a free raw turkey for Thanksgiving but you're so pour that you have nothing to cook it with, so you're either stuck with wasted food or free salmonella 😂😂😂
AWWWWW TUCKER SO CUTE
What about vegans?
Come to pakistan  there are many poor people
At the end of the day, if you were starving to death, you would probably eat a Turkey. Be happy he’s actually doing something for these people
Help me beast
Fun fact: Did you know Minnesota makes the most turkeys out of every state in the U.S.  I live in Minneosta ;)
I WANT TO EAT BELUGAS SUB
Thanks Milad! :)

Remember that episode in family guy where Peter couldn’t find a turkey?
you did the right thing for the people Beast Philanthropy they will be happy and thankful
ñ
I don't think everyone who's taking turkeys 🦃 are in need, pls give the turkeys to the people really in need, all the people taking turkeys can afford a car and obviously afford a 5$ turkeys, THINK 🧐.
Thank you Milad!!!!  God Bless you All
thank you milad! :)
Mr beast is the BEST & he wanted to make the earth a best place before he dies.

American people sitting in a car and crying that they can now feed their family....okay.If you cant feed your family then why the fuck you aint selling the car....!!!  So, this guys bacially dont even know what real poverty is. Sometimes they need to see africans,asians that how they live a life in poverty.they should be thankful for what they have.
You are such a wonderful guy

vegan teacher
Was Nolan cooked by them?
Yey Milad 👏

I need support guys😞
Milad for the win thank u milad
Thank you Milad!!!
Thanks Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The vegan teacher be like “ you evil souls”
Good afternoon, dear MR Beast, I think you won't even read this, I want to ask you for help, I'm from Ukraine, we have a war going on and my house was destroyed, and now we live on the street with my wife and small child, I want to ask you for help. I think you are a very good person and can help with finances). Write me please...
Thank you Milad!!!
Wow look at how people who have the privilege of being able to choose and pay for a specific diet are getting upset for him giving away food. People who are suffering don’t want “veggies” they want something that’s actually going to fill them and their family’s up.
I imagine at some point Jimmy's credit will be so good he will pull off the South Park episode where he puts everyone on Earth's debt on his no limit credit card and single handily saves humanity.  God speed Mr.beast
❤️❤️❤️
Go try to win be the next winner  https://youtu.be/_P6eaZYgAxE
What if he gave away 10,000 cakes for his birthday
Thank you Milad!
That woman said 5 turkeys…fuckin greedy ass people
Don’t worry no birds were hurt in this process 😉
New subscriber
I hope he does on Christmas
We never saw nolan again after that
Can you help Mexico plz
Jimmy: let's help people by giving people turkeys Community: no, I'm going to hate you know Like ok but there's people in war who oof thousands innocent people and the community don't care about those guys
thank you milad!!!
big fan from Nepal lots of love ❤️🥺
Cuz haters gonna hate
Fu** the haters
Hopefully Nolan is ok
mr beast checklist  Planted 20 million trees:Check Donated millions:Check Saved the oceans;Check Fed thousand of families:Check Twitter mad at him for feeding people and doing expensive things:Check Mr beast hate channels dumb:Check Mr beast nicest human on earth:correct
My parents and I helped deliver and serve 1,000 people on thanksgiving in our little city! We set up a thanksgiving dining room in our local college and it was really nice. I see why Mr. Beast does this stuff becsuse it always feels so amazing to give
This is a legend
Vegans hates jimmy    Me:bruh

nice going Milad
You make life changes in people. You are a ANGEL in people's life's. I'm new at YouTube and internet like this. I'm 41. But I had to leave comments. You are a blessing to everyone you meet...you are a inspiration to normal average people To help people less fortunate..I live check to check..but I help people..not like you..but I try
I swear if hear anything about vegan
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your an inspiration and amazing role model for the youth today !! Sad to see this channels following isn’t as big as the main channel 🎁🎁
No wonder there was a turkey shortage lmao
I cried a lot hope I'm there to help to volunteer ..even in small help..they are so lucky that they have Mr beast like you .I promise even I don't have money I will continued to help people here in UAE especially for those people who have bad experience here..
me when i fed family, like children, fathers mothers etc to the old:
Yay, finally getting no dislikes in his vids, this man deserves it so much
Lol waste so much money on the costume, cupboard box, people just to put on the car and god knows how much they waste on the venue. The oil and greenhouse gases they waste when the car waiting for their turn.
To every vegan: -meat has very good minerals, some vitamins -meat makes you grow bigger and get more muscle mass -meat is good in tastes -if not meat you would probably have too small amount of proteins And i would say happy thanksgiving but in my country we don't really celebrate thanks giving
ThatVeganTeacher: He should be spending money on people in need  MrBeast: has given millions of dollars to people in need
We need more youtuber like this one
Mr.Beast and milard. Best collab???
Ah yes my normal day just literally giving away 10k turkies its nothin
Me and my kids love you mrbeast  https://youtu.be/GHYAeweqn_U

Thank you @Milad Mirg that eas so generous…
I always am wanting for more of your videos… so inspiring… truly one in a million or even billion individuals
vegans when they see the then thousand turkeys:
That is so kind but vegans hate you so i hate them
pick some random people and ask their age and give them that number of gifts and for example if one person age is 20 years give 20 things to him or if some person age is 56 years give her 56 gifts
Sheesh
Vegan watching this be like:noooo the turkeys
Mr beast u should invite homeless people
Thank you milad!!!!!!!!!
don’t give up mrbeast ❤️❤️❤️ ignore the haters, they are just jealous
I have two Jennie-O turkeys in my freezer just waiting for my boys leave to be approved. We're doing one for a Thanksgiving meal and one for a Christmas meal. Hopefully, they can come home this year. Haven't seen them since 2018. Merry Christmas, everyone.
10.000 corps
My uncle got 3 turkeys there, they were really good actually, thanks Mr Beast!!!!
Thankyou Milad!!!!
These vegan communities are just weirdos
Real nice, but.. You should look to those who are realy in need of food, and dying of hunger instead of giving to those who are stable and eats what they want, I promise you will feel soo blessed if you atleast able to give them a single bite of bread.
Happy Thanksgiving everyone🍖🍗🥩🥓
Thats so nice of you Mr Beast! :D Glad that there are still people that are nice as you in this world! Keep it up! 😇
I'm only gonna say this once I always watch your videos no matter what anyone says its my best move tbh

Man I wish you would come over to haylakes in Alberta and helped the people in need you are such a grateful person and I wish we got donated some stuff but I understand  this kinda stuff costs a crud ton of money. But I still wish it would be here because me and my family are struggling with money because our uncle won't pay my dad. But I understand if you don't come over I'm just being a bit selfish and jealous seeing all these people get things
Mr Beast, of you want to make a big difference this Christmas, donate to Toys for Tots. Just an idea. Huge fan.
I got my turkey from this company called the wildlife and it is filled with trees

I am vegan and i must say... The turkey at 1:19 looks pretty damn good
Hi Mr Beast, love your amazon videos, recently I was visiting Wikipedia, they always have a banner on top asking for donations to keep the site running, I wondering if you could do an episode to help them out.
Thank you to Jennie-O and Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!!
Wait in line for hours, burn $5-10 worth of gas, for a $10-20 turkey! People are STUPID!
Thanks you milad
I can smell those stupid vegan ppl hating on mr beast😐while he is feeding hungry and poor families...Mr beast will always be a LEGEND🔥😈👑🐐
Run away from the vegan teacher
I fell bad for vegans
Definitely not the most avid Mr Beast watcher these days, but seeing Jimmy and Darren do these things makes me respect them so much. Best dude on YouTube, if not the entertainment industry as a whole! Will always be here for these videos!
Charity is the drowning of the right in the crap hole of grace  Heinrich Pestalozzi, 1746-1827  but better charity than nothing i suppose, we all should work together on a world where cherity is not needed anymore. hope you all had a happy thanksgiving
Why is your video 3 minutes long😭
Thank you Milad
Killer
Ty milad
Dude if i could make anyone the world leader mrbeast would be one of my too picks
Rip turkey 😞😞😞
Gg the only YouTube who really helps on a massive skill. And he still got people who hate on him.smh Jesus had people hate on him n turn thier backs on him and he keept going
Thank you Millad?????!!!
I think turkey are now extinct
Mr beast is fine he gave something to people something that’s popular to thanksgiving not vegetables and he has to make videos about this stuff to make more money to find more videos. The vegan community should shut the fuck up and go eat their veggies in the corner P.s. I don’t mean to offend good vegans who didn’t comment bad stuff about mr beast
Thank you milad
Thank you milad
Help me too all the way here in Aftica.4000 dollars would really go along way here for this bussiness am doing or even investors that can just come to my rescue .Thank you
Thank you milad!!!!
Thx millad
I don't understand about vegan eating veg is their wish and eating non veg is our wish if Mr beast didn't by 10000 turkey these people buy turkey with their money and that is equal right
Milad will become next MrBeast, trust me

Thank you Milad!!!!!!
Bruh I swear TWITTER needs to get deleted....and I'm serious I don't like people hating him this much JUST SHUT THE HELL UP NO ONE CARES I know it's your opinion so don't rub it in people's faces you animal abusers / dumb vegans...    fun fact: Humans count as animals  If you want to hate a person its fine but hating this much to the point you want them to die is just ANIMAL ABUSE keep this in mind vegan teacher... Keep it in yo mind.
He is the reason why the inflation is rising ⬆️ 🤣
THAN YOU MILAD YOU LEGEND
Thank you miladddd
Ty
I really like him helping the people but think about the Turkey the speechless Anima 🥺🥺
Tu és brasileiro
It's hard to hate on this guy, because he has been so kind to so many ppl... But I have a feeling alot of those who showed up there didn't really need it. And there are probably alot that didn't show up that do.... That's my only drawback of this video.
May i get your attention for a min?  "Jesus Christ is Coming Soon" Repent for all your sins, And accept JESUS in your heart and In your life as your GOD. DO IT NOW. BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! Thanks for the minute, Godblessyou :)
What the fuck why are you guys against Mr. B’s because he killed 10,000 of turkeys that’s really stupid I don’t know why you guys are against him he’s been helping us for many years
All countries government can also do that but they want only money that's why mrbeast born in this world
I don't Thanksgiving in Spain but I wood go to meet him and since I have turkey on Christmas I would go love you jimm
Nooooooooo Nolan! lol
meanwhile twitter be like : omg i cant believe he's using his money to make videos that inturn will make him able to donate even more money to people in need, and not just giving people the money and not making videos, eventho he cant make money without making videos.  twitter is such a toxic platform
I fed 10k family to turkeys XD
I don’t know why peta didn’t talk about this=))) Ps:Thank you Milad

Thank you so much for feeding people every time when I go somewhere I see hungry an poor people I really wanna help them out so thankyou for for things you did for others even tho that I am not from your country thank you so much! love you Mr. beast :) <3  I will subscribe every of your channel love you so much bye have a great day Mr. beast! <3 also join ur discord if I can <3
thank you milad
Thank you Millad!!!!!!!!!!
When Mr beast passes away 🥺 the hole world will go to his grave and people will go crazy the people that got things from Jimmy is going to have a heart attach from crying too much 🥺😢
Help me brother
You should visit native reservations and surprise kids that need help! Wouldn't that make a good video? Spend a few days with elders living off nature and help those less fortunate. I'm sure there would be awesome hospitality and awesome things you can learn from them to impart on your audience!   I hope they see this
Thank you miladddddde
pretty fancy cars, sure they need help?
Imagine someone who already has a turkey and he gets another one DOUBLE TURKEY
👍👍👍👍
Mr beast is such a kind person I don’t get why ppl hate on him
This is amazing.
Thank you Milad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you !
I just subscribed to this channel and I will be going through and liking every single video 🙂
thank you milad
Man it's nice to see Jimmy helping so many people going through the hardest times. Brings me light and joy, and helps me feel better after my grandma's passing.
Thanks milad
Me beast is on a another level
I feel so mad that vegans are shaming and trash-talking MrBeast. Everybody has their own food opinion, if u are a vegan then u are one, nobody will hate on u. But now some vegans are shaming MrBeast, same like being vegan it is just a food choice and opinion of someone. It is like vegans that hate on him wants to be shamed for being vegans.  Edit: Someone even say giving away 10,000 corpses for thanksgiving in the vegan reddit which makes me hate him even more. Besides he is literally doing a good deed on thanksgiving day. U should respect and not hate him.  Thank You to MrBeast, Mylad and any other people who donated, helped and are involved in this project.
Thank you Millard!!!!!!!!!
Covid?
10,000 turkey deaths
What about turkey 🦃 you kill 10,000
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!!!
Hi mrBeast hope you can also help us from philippines god bless
Thanks mlad
Why is no one talking about the 10 thousand turkey lives were lost in this video R.I.P (Rest in Pieces) Turkeys.
Thank you Miladddd!!!!
I hope you feed the homeless people and the people that need help FOR XMAS >:(
Thank you MIlad!!
That's amazing 😲... sharing is caring indeed!....👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
All vegan on vegan Reddit : this guy just kill a animals
People in need lol. Look at the cars they are pulling up in. Anyone in need wouldn't have been able to make the trip there at all.
loved the ending lol
Wow! Great job... what drives you to do good?
Thats why I love your video😍
Tek you milan
boi im waiting for that vegen teacher
Well new sub I didn't know Mr beast had this channel lol
Thank you Malid
Jimmy is giving food to people, that good but the turkey population has decreased by -10,000
He saved the seas, recreated squid game, and fed 10k families,  all in the same month, he is just epic. (Edit: WHY IS IT ALWAYS ARGUMENTS IN THE REPLIES?! CAN'T WE JUST APPRECIATE HIS WORK?!)
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!

People on twitter: *Saying that Mr Beast is wasting money and he should have donate it* Mr Beast casually gives thousands of turkey for free: Hey yall hear somethin?
The vegan teacher is very disappointed
ty mlad

thank you milad
Thank you mladddd
Thank you, Milad and Team MrBeast & Teamseas...
Thanks Milad!
Good job milad and beast bro
He is just trying to help people 😔
Many of these people are driving newer vehicles........ Many of them are in freaking gas guzzling trucks.... And I'm supposed to sympathize with "the poor"? Dude I work my butt off 12 hr days average as a trucker and unloading heavy things all day. I drive a Corolla and own a $100k condo... Like, if you don't have that much money then don't make stupid choices financially...
Chirst bro your baby IS SO CUTE😭
I am already imagining thatveganteacher on a rant about him.
That’s dope 💯
10,000 dead turkeys 😭
thank u milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!! You're amazing

Jimmy you're a king thanks for making people smile! I'm a big fan from the Philippines stay awesome!
Darren is soo cool love seeing him in video with you
this should be for poor people but most those high end car rich people come to get the turkey makes no sense to me
The ad at the end of the video is lit about KFC
Thanks Milad, Rip Nolan.
Eow
Hi. Have a wonderfull day!
Thank you Malad!!!!!!!!!
I'm not becoming vegan teacher but there's a holy mountain of turkeys they might go extinct jokingly
Yes yes ,use the unfortunate condition of people to collect likes, If you want to do something nice to people turn off the camera first.
jimmy were glad we have someone like you
Thank you milad
Jimmy basically feeds 10000 families a bunch of people this is offending
I'm watching the entire channel. My school vacation is coming, will it be nice to watch I don't know, 50 ads in each video ?? 12/1/2021 Day 115 🎄Ads 1354
Can afford suv's [x] can afford food for a major domestic hollyday[  ]. 🤔 I think a lot of this people just wanted free shit. (Not hating on Jimmy or the idea)
Milad da baba beast
Why is everyone have thanksgiving in November I had my Thanksgiving in September but who cares because some people do it in November sometimes I do it in November

Who ever has the audacity to say bad stuff about Jimmy even after this is a cruel person
6,69 Million Subscribers I WAS HERE

Thank you Milad
"Thank you Milad"
Hi
Thank you Milad!
your work is amazing, would you donate a house to as single mom of 2 here in Athy, Co. Kildare Ireland? ^_^
Yeah, it's nice helping people eat, but you do realize that buying 10,000 turkeys is TERRIBLE for the environment, right? Not only do meat factories severely abuse the animals, but it's also a know fact that those factories play a significant part in climate change. Research it if you don't believe me. Since I thought you were someone who wants to help the environment, it's upsetting seeing you carry around 10,000 carcasses that helped destroy the environment.
I sort get why the vegans are so mad just ignore the video Jimmy is the nicest man alive and doesn't deserve criticism
It’s hilarious that vegans and vegetarians are trying to cancel me beast about this
Ñ
thanks you milad
Thank you milad. Thank you all of you guys.
Vegetarians be like so you have chosen war
Thanks milad!!
❤️❤️❤️🇳🇬🇳🇬
Love your vids mr beast
Mr beast is a true beast he helps sooo many people
Imagine getting canceled on vegan reddit for this, couldnt be me
Thank you
Moana Moana Moana land
Tank You Milad
It’s hard watching people just take stuff for free. When you have money to spend on fingernails and hair. And if you come to take 5 turkeys you’re just greedy and taking advantage of the situation. There’s actually people in need and then theres people selling their food stamps and still heading to the food line.
Thank you miland!
Thank you mylad
Thank you Milad :)
Thank you Milad Mirg. I love your tiktoks.
Funny how you give away a 10 dollar turkey but every here uses like 20 dollar in petrol
I’d like to help feed 120,000 families with You next year, I will produce Art to create money towards that goal, if your team can help sell the Art. Each year we can add to that number of families feed.  Peace and Laughter Always
that vegan teacher is typing...

Thank you Milad!!!
You killed 10000 turkey you could have give us pizza or other food
In heaven for Jimmy jesus will be building a golden and diamond house for his good deeds yeah he  still going to enjoy in heaven too ✌️
This is what we need more of.  People helping people.   Much respect Mr. Beast.❤❤👍
Vegan teacher be like:you ruined 10,000 turkeys lives just for people to enjoy a meal
Thank you milad!
thank you milad!!!!
Thx milad
Thx millad
hello
Mr. Beast and his team are extraordinary.
Vegans on their way to make a video about this: 🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
Look this vegan. U love it? We love eat chicken, cow,and another. Why u just eat grass? we kill cow because they eat ur food, we kill fish because ur cat want to eat. Dont be vegan. Thanks milad
Here's how you pronounce Milad Jimmy. Mil- odd your welcome
Thank you Milad
There is too many fucking vegans angry at Mr beast because of this video in Reddit I saw a comment saying "he's giving 10k Corpses"
vegan nightmare
a family is a city
JIMMY IS THE BEST
Wow💕
what happened to Nolan
Todo se devuelve amigo, Everything is returned the same way ... <3
Mr. Beast is basically bat man but way nicer
Thank you Milad!!!
What if you eat 🦃 turkey in country of Turkey🇹🇷?
All vegans his giving 10000 turkeys to people who need.. that's amazing
I think mr beast is doing such a good thing he really is a good person he deserves more fans and more views so he can make more videos
Vegan Teacher : 😡😡
The besttt❤
God bless you sir❤️
Hey Jimmy can you help my school
🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
man i wish there will be 1 person in every country like him except north korea cuz you know
Thank you subway man
good for vegan teacher 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Thanks jim jim
Man is too buisy being the richest and nicest person alive
you think people need a free turkey when they can afford a car? I dont even have a cycle and I dont even consider myself as poor. Millions of people cant even afford bread to eat and yet you call yourself a philanthropist. Just sayin.
If one man can change the word imagine what some of the richest could do if they weren't evil
It’s sad how people are mad at mrbeast even if he’s just trying to help the community 😕
Thank you Milan.
i aspire to do this in future
MILARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Whatz up mr beast, from phillipines
Thank you milad
Thank you milan
Thank u milad:0*
Thankyou milardian
The only thing bigger than his wallet is his heart❤❤❤❤

THANK U BRAD!!!!!!!!!
LOL THE DANCING AT THE END
Thank you milad
Vegan do not whact this
thank you mlad
Requests to help me immigrate to the United States 😔😪
Mr.Beast I hope you could visit Philippines someday, and make Filipinos happy this Christmas.. I'm glad you're willing to help others without expecting anything in return... You're my inspiration Mr.Beast Godbless🤟 ALL THE WAY FROM THE PHILIPPINES 🇵🇭
I fw you Mr beast💪#milwuakee
This video is very interesting and I was bored this entertained me more than I expected
How is Nolan doing now?
MY TURKEYS
hahaha imagine vegans crying being like mueee murder
Thank u milad
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!!
Vegan teacher be like: MRBEAST SHALL DIE, HE KILLED SO MANY TURKEYS AND GAVE THEM TO OTHERS !!
i have no words really appreciate @MrBeast @Beast Philanthropy  and thanks thanks for HELPING HUMANITY
Thank you mmmmmmlad
Thank you Milad❤
Thank you MR Beast. Love from IRAN
I hope mrbeast will make a video about he 1v1 dream
I hate all those vegans saying that he should give people something vegan instead of "killing turkeys" like bitch those turkeys are already dead
WOW EEEeEEEEeEEEeEEE
Pov:Vegan teachers
Not tryna hate but only gave away turkeys to people who can afford cars, which are the people who can afford turkeys easiest. Giving away $10,000 of cooked Turkey to homeless people would’ve been a lot better. Love you’re channel m8
Them 10,000 turkeys be dead af tho
Oh darn! I wish my family could’ve gone there to get free turkeys instead of buying it but I’m glad that people got what they need.
If mr beast will be president he will help all people in the worlf
vegan teacher is not happy
vegan teacher is coming
Quick question is turkey taste like chicken? If not what’s it taste like? My country doesn’t celebrate so I’m asking you guys.
10,000 turkeys ._. Is fine.....
now turkeys are going to dislike the video :D
Thank you milad
Poor people coming from car 😂😂😂 for food

MrBeast I’ve literally been binge watching your videos for an entire week from all channels you created.  I heard about you when you counted to 100,000 and that was the only video I watched from you. Your videos have been recommended to me again last week and I literally cannot stop watching you. Everyone says they’re a big fan of you, but like everyone else, I am a super big fan. I can’t show it through purchasing your merch since I don’t have enough money right now, but I will continue to watch and like your videos. Keep it up MrBeast and your team!!!!
he sure is gonna have a lot of stories to tell his grandchildren....
He puts it online to make more money to give more money
Legend 👏
Thank you milad
thank you milan!!!!!! 💕💕
I want a turkey too (for..... myself)
This is how you win elections.
thx malad
Thank you milad
Thantyou Utan
Yay I will feed people and kill animals instead of feeddling them something vegetarian
Why is the dislike button removed!? 😫
Vegans: crying on twitter        Mrbeast: helping people have a good Thanksgiving                Oh yeah if your a vegan stop crying, people are getting free turkeys for thanksgiving and that helps the community in that part of town also stop saying that eating animals are bad but that's the food chain and that's how it will always work in nature so you should keep your own fucking opinion to yourself
Feed the abandoned dogs in georgia tibbilisi
Thank you Milad!!!
Much love from South Africa.. I love what you do to people.
Love

Jimmy is the person we need in this desperate world.
Thank You Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have seen many of your videos, I know you have a lot of money, don't waste this money that you have, you give the needy people in your country and there are many needy people in other countries who need this money. I have such an amazing idea, we can help the needy.
Jesus he is such a good man
I wish I would of knew about this because turkey is my favorite and I wasn’t able to get some
This man must have been sent by (insert what kind of religion you believe in) themselves
Mrbeast calling 500 turkeys some like its not alot
You’re crazy bro
Even tho vegans are against him, he did a lot of shit and contribute to society while the vegans just fucking complain and didn't even contribute to society
Thanks Milad.
Giving away the turkey was a good thing, plus the turkey were all ready pass away when mrbeast bought them so it’s not like he killed them alive.
THANK U MILAD
Man, I really wanted to eat nolan :(
Vegans be like
You do realise if these videos weren’t posted he wouldn’t be able to help all these people

Amazing ! ❤️ I wish I lived in the USA lol would to see this first hand , you have a heart of gold!

mrbeast: helping people have food during thanksgiving. Vegans: hating on him for helping people get food that people need
thank you milad
thank you milad and i am your biggest fan
Thank you Milad
These videos make you feel better about yourself, saying this is great and these guys are doing what I should be doing.  Think about it.  Can you actually go to help without the theater?   And really help people close to you?   It’s slacktivism
Hi
For all that hate on him for giving away 10,000 turkeys rather then giving away 10,000 pounds or whatever meals of tofu is because if you think about it he's doing good for the community that aren't choosers there beggars beggars can't be choosers if you lived on the street and all you had to choose from was this freshly thrown out turkey dinner vs a fungi you found on the floor that may or may not make you hallucinate and if you eat it I'm assuming you'd say you have research in good and bad mushrooms but did you know there's bad and good ones that actually look alot alike eachother and in some families of fungi some are edible and some aren't just because it has a little white spec on it or something like that shows the dead giveaway if spotted or known of besides the fact he's feeding people who are thankful for things if you aren't thankful for these people that could have been starving or in a hard time being fed think of the people who don't have anything at all man that's just selfish you want something of your kind to be given for free rather then something someone already has like the 10,000 turkeys there already gone so what are you going to do get mad at him until Christmas when he actually does drop of veggies to people it's called wait for another video to come out don't just get mad because this time there no veggies when next time there could be
YouTube be like: OMG I LOVE YOU MR BEAST YOUR SO AWESOME Vegan redditors: EWW more like thousands of corpses go commit sudoku. Honestly I think your great and awesome I wish tons of people were as cool as you.
You are truly an amazing person !
THANK YOU MILAD 💓💘💞💗

Dont Kill turkeys just eat vegtable its murdering

think how many turkeys you killed in the process ( go veg / not vegan)\
Repent for your sins thank and pray to God.
We don't have Thanksgiving here in the Philippines, but thank you everyone who donated so that those families that were given the Turkeys will have something to prepare on Thanksgiving! Bless your hearts!
Love the videos
MRBEAST THE LEGEND FEEDING A WHOLE CITY IS A MANS DREAM AND HE MADE IT COME TRUE
He is a legend
This is totally nonsense.  These people are not poor so why feed them. If your a true philanthropist feed  people in real need outside the USA in other countries that are really starving to death. Your just a fake show man.
This is irrelevant for this channel, but your a clout chaser!!!!
And vegan said why turkey
Thanks for helping everyone. i just saw ppl hating on mr beast cuz he "'killed"' 10.000 turkeys BRUH
Where are all the vegans??
Thanks milargmarg
i have a feeling that the vegan community doesnt appreciate this...
Thank you, Beast. Without you we wouldn't have good content and good people like you.
People in twitter saying that he do not give money but atleast he give stuffs,thats my MAN!
THANK YOU MILAD!🖤🖤🖤
We don't have thanks giving Turkey:,>
What whud the vegan teacher think
Sir I am from India I do not have money to study and I have to study but I am forced to work if you support me then i can do something for my family on youtube because i love my family very much
That’s not 10,000 turkeys though lmao g😂😂😂
Thank you milad🥵
r.i.p nolan, we miss you
Oh wow. Your doing an amazing job. Your good deeds are changing people's lives as some don't even have a single thing to eat. May God bless you ✨💗
Thank you malad lol!!!
That day was my birthday and im very happy you gave people in need food and honestle R.I.P Turkeys i hope that there will be no extinction
Jst realized that milad guy is from the cookie giveaway vid°0°
Thank you milad
Gow many Turkeys killed
Thank you mulad
I appreciate the possible good intentions, but think of the poor people who had to kill those turkeys and get PSTD/PITS and now get panic attacks and violent outbursts. Many even commit suicide. Animal agriculture is not good for anything but taste buds. That food high is a nice buzz, but everything else about animal agriculture is bad - no matter how much TV and commercials paint it in a positive light, and try to suggest it is macho. For the workers, the animals, the environment, and our health, help spread awareness.
Love you 🤍 so proud we have YouTubers like you
Stop killing  10000 birds are you crazy and THAT'S  SO MANY JUST GIVE US VEGETABLES
Ok you must of AT LEAST once thought of vegans
Ya know what?    …Read more
Anh ất làm việc tốt như vậy mà các nhà ăn chay học lại chê bai lên án anh ấy ủng hộ việc giết hại động vật ,thực vật cũng là sinh vật vậy thì cũng giết hại thực vật,hơn nữa vào mỗi dịp lễ tạ ơn,ở các bữa ăn của gia đình không thể thiếu món gà tây,anh ấy chỉ tặng gà tây cho những gia đình thiếu gà tây trong dịp tạ ơn này

How nice he is giving so much food to people who can afford a car  But not giving it to people who can't afford everyday meal  🙂  If you don't know about how youtube and sponsorship work than let me tell you if you influence rich people than you get more money on youtube per views and sponsorship pay you more cause rich people can spend more money and vice versa

I want to be an acter nd  is not it so sad and worst that u can't work for ur dreams..u know acting alone feels so pleased nd hearing nd watching movies star's work nd expecting..nd dreaming ur self in there place is so much close nd a true feeling..but when we see we can't follow our dreams now nd never ..then this life seems so worthless..tears rolls down everytime we realise that..I want to be an acter..I'm good looking but not so much..ihve insecurities too..the world is so cheap nd selfish either I act ..but is it enough ..no I need practice..but I'm poor..I can't afford good acting classes with my studies..do I hve enough time..no I hve to support my family financial too..am I talented no..I hve to learn nd be skilled but after that too the people in this industry give more rejection than The test of God...it's hilarious nd sad too..it's sarcastic but it's true nd I can't find .. what ese is for me but acting nd dancing.. I love doing it..I'm now 18nd soon I will be turning into 30..life is so short..nd dream is so big..
THE VEGANS ARE LITERALLY ANGRY LOLL
Great work. Keep it up....

People only see that he's feeding 10,000 people but they don't see how many animals and birds he had killed. Shame.
Wait HOW DOES HE MANAGE ALL HIS CHANNELS AT THE SAME TIME 😭
Mrbeast is awesome
Rhur
Commenting to support with community engagement numbers
Why you kill 10,000 tarkey 🤬
This is the video where the vegan community and Peta tried to cancel Jimmy?!? No wonder the whole world hates them 😅
Poor people:Food pls pls...? Mrbeast: *Giving away 10,000 Turkeys* Poor people: *Gasp*
people thinks this is bad on Twitter,like is thanksgiving what did you expected?

Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!
Yay
Amazing videos love your content!
Thank You Milad!!!!!
Great Video Jimmy Well Done
vegans:
Why this video has only 4 million view????
who said there must be a turkey for thanksgiving? these ppl think high about themselves bc they fed someone. giving someone unconditionally will only do something good to you than expecting back. plus those ppl killed 10,000 turkeys for you. Which means its a sin for both of you.
Thank you milad!!!
Thank you Milad
Good job mr beast good job
Vegan teacher ain’t gonna like this one        (THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING PEOPLE IN NEED MR BEAST!!)

THANK YOU MILAD!!!!
Good job Mr Beast
Thank you  Mailad
Thx 🙏😊 you 🇺🇸💕💯
😍
and then there are those deadass people on reddit saying hesa mass murderer
Rip Turkeys Lol
Mr Beast I have an idea for you!!! You and your friends should find an Angel tree, adopt all the kids on it and get everything and more on their wish lists!! I know we can't get to see the kids open the stuff, I don't think, but that would be an awesome Christmas for a bunch of kids!! And you guys would have a blast shopping for them. I hope you see this🥰
Veganteacher: why you killed and give all the turkey to someone thats horrible ur gonna get x mark with that Me: bro were hungry i dont like vegan anyways
Wow .. good heart 😮
Thank you milad I am a big fan
Even if I would have gotten a turkey I still would have been alone

Didn't expect milad to come
Dude imagine that vegan teacher saw this. she'd go crazy haha
Mr.beast donate 1000 diet food and no one will come
Imagine how that vegan teacher would react to this
Mr.Beast: does squid game that costs 3 mill       Also Mr.Beast gives away 10k turkeys 🦃
I am news subscriber
There could've been a turkey army by the number. Lol just like China has chicken army.🤣
Current like to dislike ratio: 👍401K  👎2K
Can't wait for That Vegan Teacher to react to this. She would be screaming obnoxiously loud while exclaiming how malicious Mr. Beast is for supporting animal cruelty.  Kudos to Mr. Beast for doing this honorable and noble act and helping all these people!
Hey mrbeast can u pls buy me 3 mc accounts and a new gaming laptop
Man He's A Pretty Good Man But He Killed Alot Of Animals Like 10k Turkeys Dude

Vegans are mad at him for no reason 😔
Thanks Milad

You killed the vegan teacher
To all u dumb vegans criticizing him stop. He posts this on social media’s to make money so he can donate more! And even tho it wasn’t vegan stuff, I don’t think ppl who are starving will care what type of food they were eating.mrbeast is awesome
Hi

Try fixing the issue at your beast burger In Utah what a waste of hard earned money

Mr. Beast isn't even a YouTube channel anymore, he's an entire company
Well done Jimmy have a good thanksgiving
Hahhahhahaaaa suck it vegans
Thank you for the turkeys
What's funny is that the car they put nolon in could have well been an actual kidnappers car 🤣
Thank you malad
I think this is the small is video on mrbeast
Thank you Milad
Most want free turkey maybe
RIP the entire turkey population of whatever that county was.
Dude you really need to be more careful with your money you don’t want to file bankruptcy. I’m not trying to be a hater against your goodwill
Thank you milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just wanted to say hi I’m Izzy your videos are so cool I’ve watched most of them and I think it’s so nice that you give so much away to people I’m going to start saving up for merch but it might take a while I just so badly want to meet you 😁 -Izzy and almost merry Christmas
Thank you milad!!!!!!
The people that got 5 Turkey's there really smart
Mr beast *cleans ocean and plants trees*  Also mr beast *buys 10,000 turkeys*
Thanks a ton Milad!
Thanks for the gurney it was amazing
I LOVE YOU BESTEY
AWESOME JONATHON!
Thank you Miland
Thank you MILAD!!!
Thank you Milad!
Thanks, Milad!
Jennie-O deserves a shout out too!
The pinnacle of Mr. Beast: Nolan in a turkey suit. Oh and also the food, but mostly turkey nolan
These dude is amazing!
I heard of Vegans getting pissed mad at this. I like the vegans who mind their business and don't try to force their life choices on anyone. Like seriously, if you're a vegan and keep complaining about animal abuse, shut the fuck up. Please.
What is Mr. Beast without his channel? Genius, millionaire, playboy philanthropist.
Mr Beast is actually a saint, he is from jesus
I cannot believe mr beasr would do something like this, it's discussing. The title says "I fed 10,000 families" when he gave some families more then one, which means he didn't feed 10,000. more like 9800 something.
thank you milad!!!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!!!!!
Y'all haters are just so ungrateful he's helping people
He should have given out vegetables Bc he is killing many endangered species of turkey ,committing to a turkey hollacost is bad    Edit: this is a joke
TYSM MILAD!!
Twitter haters gotta feel stupid now.
ALSO THANK YOU MILAD
thank you milad
this is so heartwarming
Jimmy need to find something else to do im srry i like his content and everything he does but hey now glass generation is a thing vegan ppl will make a frickin cult to find you the unsuffurable ppl critisizes him for doing squid game and the other videos when u give almost billions of dollar are just dead now? This is why humanity need to die
Vegans will complain that "Oh, Is 10000 TuRkYs Ded1111!11!1!" But like, hes giving to the people lol, free ranged food is probably gonna be the way stuff goes on from now on in a few years
This channel is great.
This man is feeding 10k people who have nothing and sensitive Reddit mf’s have the nerve to say that he’s doing wrong
Its healthy to your heart in helping other people....😍
Marladahanreh is a great guy
Humildad puls que bueno es mr beast suscribanse para que pueda seguir haciendo estas cosas increibles   suscribe so he can continue doing amazing things like this ;)
Can we just say that Mrbeast edits can sometimes Be super funny?
This is crazy and amazing omg Chris baby chucker cute 🥰
thank you for everything you've done Mr.Beast!! and thanks to all the donaters too!!
Very good am proud of you Jimmy
The vegan teacher going insane right now
To all those people hating on me beast mainly the vegans for giving turkeys to family first of all he didn’t kill the turkeys he bought them they were already dead and btw vegans us humans need to eat animals because if we didn’t this world would be overpopulated and the people in need might not be vegan and might really need the turkey so stop hating because he’s helping people that need food and not giving them vegetables to satisfy your guys needs that don’t need any food and to all those that are saying he’s not nice cause he wouldn’t put these videos out if he really was YouTube is his only source of Income so if he didn’t give people stuff and post it he wouldn’t get any money and wouldn’t be able to help the homeless or give people money
Thanks Malid and Mr beast crew your a legend :D
thank you McDonalds, so awesome
Ho so mr beast made the shortage of turkeys
These are my goals. Humanitarian
U are the most amazing human in the world HANDS DOWN!!!!
Now let's wait for the reaction of the vegan teacher 🤣
D
Thank you Milan!!!!!!!!!!
THANK YOU MILAD

Thank you Milan.MrBeast was so kind of feeding that many family.
Hi
Millad the mad lad
Vegans crying in horror
“This is 10000 turkeys” proceeds to point at a couple of hundred if that 😂
YOU ARE GIVING AVEY TO MUCH!😅😭
New subscriber here can I help some time I would love that
Thank you
I keep forgetting that mrbeast only runs the main channel😂
DON'T LISTEN TO THESE STUPID IDIOT VEGANS. YOU ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD DEED AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
Mr beast you are a great man and ur for sure going to heaven NO DOUBT
Milad you mad man
Million was in this video!!! That's so cool
Not sure the exact location but I'm sure this made a lot of fellow North Carolinians Thanksgiving a lot better.  Thanks as always for giving back to our community.
If you ever feel dumb, remember that some people said Mrbeast did a bad thing here.
Why are people taking more than two per car?
thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!
Milad the subway worker😂
You're the best
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ESTÁ BUENA LA IDEA DE REGALAR COSAS... PERO  LA GENTE QUE VEO AHI TIENE CAMIONETAS 4X4 Y BIEN ECONÓMICAMENTE.  UNA CRITICA CONSTRUCTIVA....  ●SI VAN A REGALAR COSAS  QUE SEA A LAS PERSONAS QUE MAS NECESITAN O EN SITUACION DE CALLE...SE LO VAN A AGREDECER MUCHO MAS QUE LOS QUE YA TIENEN .  SALUDOS DESDE ARGENTINA.   GRACIAS!!
Thank you milad
Yo okay think if mr beast has a child that kid has a lot to live up to. Hope that’s not for a long time though because mr beast is the beast.

Cool 😎
Thank you Mr Beast, Milad and all the volunteers!
Thanks milad
Why are the vegans mad, like bruh, he dead people??? What’s wrong with that…
for some reason I just remembered vegan teacher
vegan teacher ARE THOSE VEGAN TURKEYS
People who who are thinking that he made 10000 turkeys die to make the food no he purchased that all from hotel or something but hotels make turkeys dishes and they breed turkeys
It's not recommending you videos :( even if I search Mr. Beast, brings up all you other content and not this channel
Why are vegans out here getting mad that mr.beast just fed families only because it’s meat. To all the vegans not everyone has to go along with you life style.
The people that said five turkeys is what’s wrong with the world.
Sorry I didn’t buy a Turkey brand I raised my own
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!
Thank you milad!!
Those vegans are just mad because you're a good guy and that ain't right
When you come to think of it , All of the turkeys are dead 😂😭
Damnn I Wish I could come to America...I'm really amazed with what you do for people keep doing it really proud 😊
its kinda weird thinking that there legit gaving away free dead turkey meat and they enjoy doing it
Yet people on Twitter are saying that Mr beast doesn't do good things for people
Jimmy, you and your crew, you change the world to a better place :)
We didn't need Nolan anyways.
Thank you milad!
Thank you mallad
I am 100% positive GOD has a special place for you in Heaven
Thank you mallad sorry if I didn’t write your name right!
Get a car and take it to a random person lol
Thank you milad
I guess you could call him.... mr feast
Thank you so much

THANK YOU MILARD!!!
Thank youuu Milad!!!!! MrsBeast your a Beast !!!
Good job to Jimmy and his crew
I ate ramen noodles for Thanksgiving, nice to see other people were able to enjoy a Tasty Turkey on The day of Thanks
Hey mr beast I’m from Dallas and wanted to see if you could do a video over here where we build a community garden. I’m a local gardener and can manage the garden. It’s the best way to give something to the community that gives healthy food every year. If it’s successful we can open gardens in other major cities to help with hunger. All we need is a plot of land, a shed for tools and a greenhouse
Thank you Milad!!!!
Mrbeast goving 10000 turkeys=canceled by vegand
Thank you milad and Mr beast
Thus man’s heart is bigger than the universe
Your amazing ohh and people who are saying he is feeding dead animals don’t have a mind like what do you want us to eat grass? Like grow up and get a mind and a life
Love wat u are  doing for people mr beast god bless u n family and all those who volunteered and donated ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Poor turkeys

You can't see it now because they removed it, but the dislikes on this video were 0 anyways.
i mean they all have cars ,why did'nt they just serve it to homeless people?? it's just like rich serving rich.      thank you lol
❤️
Nobody gives things away for free, cause if they do so, how can they keep doing it? By spreading the word and earning money from your deed allows for more good deeds to be made, disappointed with the ignorant community about how they dont know about the perpetuity of giving and earning
Thank you Milano!!!!!!
Thank u milad.
Idk why he is receiving backlash if he is feeding ppl and having fun putting smiles on their faces
Thank you Milad!111
Thx mallaidd!!!
Heyyyy I slithered those turkeys makein fun of my work

In a time when life is so depressing and miserable, this guy is a light to all. Thank you MrBeast and team!
So that's why I had a hard time finding turkeys for Thanksgiving
Yummy turkey
Bro I don't know why everyone is hating on him, even though it's not Vegan it's a push to save world hunger, everyone just takes it differently

why are there dislikes here
cmon tucker 2:52
can Mr,beast do anything wrong i swear everytime I watch his videos my heart warms what a guy
thank you Milad!
My uncle does this for our city every year 🥺❤️ and most people, I wouldn’t say are unappreciative, but they don’t know the work and pride and just how much love he puts into his work. He enjoys and gets so much out from helping other people, sometimes he can forget to even worry about himself. I thank people like you guys so much, you’re truly needed and such important human beings ‼️🙏🏼❤️ Thank you!!
And like your ever video
I love your video and attitude. I gonna comment every video you post trust me I'm gonna do for the entire live. *I'm done*
Thank u Malan
Rest in peace nolan
Can we talk about the fact that 10k turkeys is around 300-500k dollars? Because 1 large Turkey sells for $50 usualy, but he bought them from the farm so I expect that he bought them with a discount but still
Thanx Milad
Thank you Milad !!
This is nice. But judging by the cars..those are not all people in need..
Thank u milad
so they can't afford turkeys but they can afford a big car?
ty milad
Thank you Milard
I feel like that one lad Yvonne taking 5 was a little greedy idk
thats alot of deAD turkeys
This is awesome! 👏🎉 Thank you, MrBeast, Milad, Darren, and everyone! May God bless you all and keep you safe so you can continue doing what you do! 🙌
Trying to save the ocean while promoting and supporting unnecessary slaughter of turkeys 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Vegan people in the comments 🤡😭💀
Fun fact: Other than MrBeast 2 (MrBeast doesn’t upload on it) this MrBeast channel unfortunately has the least subs.
vegan teacher be like: thats evil those turkeys died  then makes a tiktok about it breh
sad that the vegans do not understand what he did
Guys, do not give deslike for this sacred thing
Hello mr. Beast soy de centro america me donarias $2,000 pleaseeeee......
I somehow didn't know about this video until I saw a bunch of Vegans complaining about it on Twitter. Ironic.

Props to Jennie-O. They might make money from the publicity, or they might take a small hit from the donation. Either way, they're doing a shit ton of good with this donation.
Team seas is good for the sushi markets because the fish is fresher.
Thanks for donating 25 000dollars milad. Thank you Jimmy for doing this
Keep it up mr beast you’re killing it :)
WHAT YALL DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I WAS HOMELESS THREE YEARS AGO FOR TWO YEARS. I WAS IN NEED OF A TURKEY AND MEAL AND NO WAY TO COOK TURKEY. SO I STARED AT IT ON THE HOLIDAY ALONG WITH MY CHILDREN. WE ATE OUT OF CANS. SO PLEASE COOK THEM, THEN DELIVER. YOU WILL DEFT MAKE SOMEONES HOLIDAY.

Hi
The dislikes are the jealous people that can't be rich and successful like him and can't donate to charity because they're selfish
I never skip ads on this channel.
Thank u malan!!!!!!!!
Vegans go mad
God : create the animal to feed human Vegan: guest im a sinners
Idk why this got alot of backlash
still mill-add? bruhhh
Thank you milad!
Dude YOU'VE PROVEN YOUR SELF AGAIN AND AGAIN SQUID GAME IRL TEAM SEAS TEAM TREES TO NAME A FEW DUDE YOU ARE A LEGEND
mall can i have a cookie
No hate to Mrbeast, I'm a big fan of yours, you are doing really great. But you know I feel bad for the 10000 lives (I'm not a vegan but still). It's not just about the lives, you have so much influence on people and by promoting real meat you're actually somehow affecting the environment, there are alternatives like plant based meats which is much healthier, prevents animal abuse and is environment friendly. I would really appreciate if you promote them next time instead of real meat 😊.  To all the fans who are gonna fight me in the reply section: Bro I'm also a huge fan of him, but it doesn't mean I can't criticize him, there is a huge gap between critisism and hate, and you need to understand that.
keep it up guys! i hope you can help some people here in philippines 😊
That millad guy was really nice for what he did bless him
i came from video saying that mr beast backlash from vegan, dont listen to them  u did great jimmy what important is what ur heart intention is
Nice! Keep killing innocent birds!
Gen C trying to cancel Mr.Beast. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Can u post more videos in this channel
I hate How Reddit litteraly makes this video terrible          But this video Is Still wholesome
Thank you milad and all of you guys
Mr.Beast and his friends are sooo generous enough to give away free turkeys to people in need for Thanksgiving, that's amazing. Keep up the good work😇👌👍
Seriously? You do a good deed and then splash it all over the internet to get views, likes and subscriptions for your channel..? Nah, That's not how kindness works. Kindness comes from the heart; and not with the need to advertise what you've done to help someone.
Everyone pulling up trucks and 30k+ cars 😂 where’s all the run down rusty trucks that actually need the turkeys? Or the homeless people without a car at all?
I love you jimmy....
Thank you Milad🥰🥰🥰!!!! From: Philippines
Or it's just me but I wonder where is nolan or he actually get cooked or not=))😁😁😁
And some people hate and whines about why jimmy isn't using the money to help people instead in his main channel lmao
And the vegans ruining it
Thank you milad
The vegan community is mad at him but true fans love him for helping people
So those 10,000 turkeys got killed? And got cooked?
vegan teacher watching this video be like
And some people had the nerve to question him by saying he murdered 10000 lives  I didn't wanna say this but vegan you suck ( only those who force others to be vegan)
He had been receiving backlash of people on reddit  Saying he need to introduce vegetarian food and even tho it good but do you know how annoying it is for mr beast to buy this much turkey and how much it cost
🇹🇷 be like : wait theres 10,000 of me?
Thank you mald
vegen teacher: you dare test my power >:p
Thank you Mitochondria
Thank you Milad!!!
Yo turkeys got to be extinc at this point, but props to mr beast the most beautiful human being.💗

When turkeys don't even exist in my entire country  Oh and thank you Milad, Jimmy, Chris, Chandler and Nolan for pretty much changing the world for the better in the most you can do.
You are  actually  not helping the people who really need .there are  people who literally  eat sand in madagascer and africa because they don't  have food to eat and you are saying this is philanthropy by giving turkeys to people who  have  everything they need to survive
Thank You Milad

I hate people who say Mr. Beast is a bad person because he “IsNt VeGaN.” He’s literally saving human lives! Sure turkeys are animals, but they aren’t humans. Humans are more important than turkeys. Mr. Beast is saving lives while entertaining ours. He is amazing, and deserves no hate!

Some vegan person be like: If he is a great guy he wouldn’t post this to his social media (it’s okay to be vegan , but don’t take it too seriously like when mr beast post a picture of him beside the turkeys on his social medias)  Me: he is making more money from youtube by giving away foods and money, technically he is a great guy, he post this video so people can watch the video and get more money then he can give away more MONEY OR FOODS TO people in need
Mister beast you are  amazing

Thank you milan!
Mr best is the best YouTube
He has been getting hate from vegans for this video when it was called I gave away 10000 turkeys for thanksgiving. Now he has changed the title I hope the vegan community realise that they were gonna be eaten by other people anyway and he is giving them to people who will really appreciate it.
instead of giving them to people in need he should have gave them to those who are in need
Thank you milad
Thank you milda
I’m sorry, anyone else think it isn’t normal that all these people are relying on a YouTuber to survive thanksgiving? Maybe that the system is broken?
Mrbeast, gosh I could go on, a great bf, a funny dude, kind, isnt a cocky rich dude, shares his wealth in big portions, cleaned beaches, planted 1 million trees, has a literal philanthropy channel!?! Like what a great man, i want to meet him in real life one day.
Thank you, Milad
What you do is commendable
One small thing can make a huge difference happy Thanksgiving everyone

:)) I saw that Mr.Beast made this video, and there were people from the Vegan association (Vegetarian Association). Declare Mr.Beast as a barbarian for killing 10k turkeys :)) So that means the people from the vegan association think that the meat eaters are all barbarians, with no right to live on this earth. So funny . Sorry for my words affecting Mr.beast .0
Thank you milad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you too Milad!!
10000 dead body’s*
I just watched all of the videos on this channel to help out 😊
I like that see what I did we raised and ate our own turkeys The turkeys you buy in the store or what Mr. beast is giving out our boat 14 pounds at the most my turkeys were 38 pounds

Thank you milad

Next thanksgiving Mr. beast I just gave everyone in the world a turkey.
Mans just gave away 10000 turkeys, which are more expensive than ever now, and made a 4 minute video out of it. He could have made like a 10 minute video or more but he doesn't care about that, he just wants to inspire people.
You’re amazing, as always ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you milad!!!!
:( the lives of the turkeys u took
:)
He's the next Santa claus
The vegan community is mad at him but really why? They are mad because they fed people with meat? That's not a good reason to be angry at him.
Animal cruelty 😢
TY MILLAD!!
1.7k dislikes??? Why????
Everyone: *thanking jimmy for doing this  act of kindness* Vegans: *"AVENGERS LET'S FUCKING ASSEMBLE"*

It’s so nice seeing mrbeast helping the world, people, and the planet he helped raise money for plant 20 mil trees just like the Lorax, he helped give money to people who don’t have money and stuff, he’s helping the sea now which is good for animals, and helping families. I wish there were more people like Mrbeast. Instead of selfish people
Everyone is talking about how generous mr.beast is witch don't get wrong he is but I think the really generous one is Malid for donating a 25,000 dollars
i need a turkey can u give me 1? XD

Poor turkeys :( but respect for feeding ppl.
I grown my turkey. Jimmy better respond if I got the right type of turkeys.

Vegans 💀💀💀
for mr beast this is basicly doing nothing
Por gentileza coloca legendas em todas os seus canais pf
It’s so great to have reminder that there are people that are trying to make the world better. You see so many YouTubers that just make videos to get popularity and money and fame, and Jimmy isn’t one of those. You can tell that he actually cares about others, and is making a difference. It’s inspiring. It really is. It makes you want to get up, and go do something to serve other people. And we really do need a whole lot more of that. ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Milad!
Vegans be like: BRUH
MAKE THESE VIDS LONGER OR IMA CANCLE YOU
Thanks Millad!!!!!!!
JESUS loves you
Dude you literally bought all the Jennie-O turkeys lmao. I work in a retail store and they only sent us one pallet of them for the entirety of thanksgiving and shorted us like 30 cases. Now I see why lol
100% he is going to give gift to people for Christmas
10,000 kill streak
I bought a Jennie-o turkey this year :) how kind this was a fun video!!
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!! You are a good person and me beast is so good for this he needs to keep it up
THANK YOU MILAD!
The only thing I’m thinking about is those turkeys😢.   #R.I.P turkeys
I love you, keep going🌸❤️
I wonder if the gas spent waiting in that long of a line barely moving is worth the cost of a 20lb turkey
Thank you Milad,Jimmy,Chris,Chandler,Nolan for  every thing you have done for the world and the seas #teamseas
Imagine the vegan teacher see this 😂 LOL

For those vegans who are cancelling this video Hell you At least the turkey helped a lot if people
I just can’t belive that some people think that it is ok to cancle this man for helping SO MUCH people. You guys do and eat what you want but if you wanna step to your phone/keyboard/xbox controler idk something else and you go shame this man for giving away free food you are cray cray in a not good way. I mean what the f**k do you think will happen with the turkeys when they die???? Be surrounded by there family? Jesus
You are cool mr beast
Vegans I hope you know you’ll never cancel me beast for feeding people
Let’s just respect for the turkeys who gave their life for us
Vegans will be hunting team beast down
I’m happy for you
Okey, can someone tell me, as I am not American, why people who need food drive a car? So they are poor enough to dont have money for food, but have enough to own a car and fill the gas tank? Im not a hater, cheers Jimmy for this help, but I do not understand that.
Vegan teacher’s gonna be mad😂
Take it outside aswell brother...people who really needs food to survive um talking about outside of america...may Allah bless you for your kindness
Thanks Milad!!!

Thank you milad
an average day for an absolute sigma male
How many people do you think came just to see mr.beast
Mrbeast have you ever thought of giving away turkeys to peoples who really need it….
The entitled vegans need to realize that humans need to eat whether that means eating meat or leaves like y’all need to get the fuck out of here trying to make this man look bad he’s one of the only people actually trying to do good and ofc these sensitive and entitled ass people gotta make it about them we eat meat animals eat other animals it’s how the world goes round the fact that people r so entitled to the point that you have to hate on people because they dont do the same thing as you is seriously ridiculous let this man help people in peace and stop making it about you not everything is about you there r people dying of cancer and y’all out here trying to bully a grown man for helping people that need the help it’s how humans survive since when has a wild animal not killed another animal to SURVIVE like get off the internet and actually do something besides bullying someone who is doing the right thing whether you agree with the way hes doing it or not honestly it doesn’t matter because the world does not revolve around you the world will NEVER get better as long as these ignorant ass people keep causing an irrelevant war between humans we are all humans and all should choose how we live our life we shouldn’t get bullied into to doing anything else
haters are vegan
Only had turkey once :(

This makes me so happy. I’m so excited to see this channel blow up the way the others have.

I actually wonder wherr does all city spending go towards? Seems like every city/state has raised their taxes but feels like Americans are getting less and less in return, from medical care to housing, safety and etc. Would love to see a bill passed where does every cent goes towards. If one man such as mrbeast with limited amount of money, how much he changing the world

I just don't understand how people are attacking them for feeding those who are in need.
quickest mr beast video

I bet those turkeys tasted great, everything tastes better when it's free
Thank you Milad!!!!!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤
Them vegans are so disgusting there literally hating MrBeast for feeding the poor. And donating Millon's. Whilst them vegans sit around and complain at people.
This video remembers me on the video when mrbeast opens beastburger
Thank you Milad!

Hey beast takuto the shiba and I would love an opportunity to earn a better life working for you helping make the world a better place. We're hard workers and won't let you down. Please consider giving us a chance to earn a new and better life. We lost our home and our business recently and are struggling to recover. Love and light
THANK YOU MILAD
Thank you Milad, you are a great person
THANKS MILAD!!!
I wish that he could’ve been here for thanksgiving because our house flooded and destroyed our kitchen so we couldn’t have a thanksgiving meal and we don’t have very much food rn and I also have to sleep on the couch because my room got destroyed by the flood
Thank you Milad! Amazing work.
Jimmy does more for people and the country then our own government
vegans: HE IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE HE IS NOT GIVING VEGGIES TO ALL. mrbeast: i literally gave free food to 10000 people, is that not enough. ok A MILLION IT IS
Why would someone dislike this video??
So this is why we had a turkey shortage
That Milad guy looks like he’s make some good subway sandwiches
idol I hope you notice my comment I idolize you I'm from here in the Philippines even if it's just a Lamborghin for Christmas because that's my dream thank you godbless Idol
Yo those turkeys was like 25-30 dollars when I saw them in store. If you times that by 10000 that’s a minimum of 300,000 dollars on just turkey.
Thank u Milad
What a nice video I'm sure a subreddit wont mald over it
Thx Milan
Thank you milad!!!!!!!
Mr Beast is a legend and so is Milad!
Feels like I want to volunteer... Beast is awesome man... 💯❤️
thank you milad
we all appreciate you jimmy keep it up
Bruh the Reddit vegans a really mad about this he’s helping people
some vegans are complaining that mr beast should've feed a 10,000 with veggies and saying that he is a fake nice guy but deep down he helped so many people.. and vegans just says to feed them with veggies well it healthy to eat it but. it was thanks giving. and for that they cannot eat veggies on thanks giving.
Idk how to say this but Jimmy deserves money he knows how money works and is very responsible with it especially with his age. I love this man. Idk what I'm going with it but I love this man to much to care!
THANKS MILAD!!
Stop hating on MrBeast!

The vegan teacher is about to end the world the next time mr.beast gives away 100,000 turkeys

Normal people: This is so great!  Vegans: This is horrible. Disgusting. Revolting.
Yaay
America where people have cars but not food
Great this is amazing ❣️
I have a message for all of you vegans out there: Veganism sucks + dnc about the animals + we're also animals + imagine hating on jimmy + ratio + L
Thank you Mr Beast for everything you do for these people
S
There is no proof that mr beast is actually rich, Mr Beast could be giving away all his money to make other peoples lives exist
Instead of giving this to people waiting inside their CARS, why not give food to homeless people, who actually benefit more from it? Smh
Thank you macroscopic
Thank you Milad for your donation
RIP turkeys. . Will miss you :(
Thank you mitochondria
So many vegans hated mr beast for doing this. SCREW THOSE VEGANS!! and that lady wanted 5 turkey?? what a greedy lady. they will be having turkey for 5 weeks!

A moment of silence for Nolan who sacrificed himself to feed a family
Milad the goat
I'm amazed how the haters don't have the balls to tell their opinion here because they know how wrong they are. Jimmy doing his part in being a part of humanity. Keep up the good work man, with love from Malaysia.
I couldn't stop smiling this video is so wholesome! :) Jimmy is literally the most sensible person ever!  he's a millionaire and doesn't buy himself a big fancy house or car etc he spends it on others in need :)
Thank you Milad!
The best youtuber
Thank u Milad
Thank you Mailad!!!!
Rip nolin

If y’all wanna boost Jeannie O next year release this video early November if you can, second week, that’ll help boost their sales a little more since that’s about when people are buying their turkeys  Sincerely, an exhausted meat dept employee.
Thanks milad

People are saying if he actually cares for them he wouldn’t post videos and just do it but how does he make the money to donate to people do you think it comes out of thin air
Thank you Mila

Mr. Beast is a whole superhero at this point.
I think he’s the one making America great again joe Biden and Donald trump have nothing on jimmy
Anyone seen the vegans shaming mr beast for giving 10,000 "corpse"
mrbeast is the only one i know i can click like on before i watch the video :o
Ohhhhh so that’s why turkeys are so expensive this year
Thank young Milan!
This is my idol Mr. Beast so generous
And people still think he is a bad person
Wtf is this guy
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!

Thats A 10K Animals And Delicios Foods
Yo I’m from North Carolina and I’m a big fan!
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!
thank you milad
i cant belive sum1 said that mr beast never helps people since he made the squid game irl😂
Vegan racist 🤭🤭
Thank you Milad!!!!
0:48 and 3:50 Dodge RAM in the background and between 3:35 and 3:36 is another RAM if yall are interested by the way this is an amazing thing you are doing Jimmy keep it up
Nolan will be missed. 🍗👏🏼
It’s bs that people are hating on him for this.  I may be vegan but I volunteer at a food pantry and give everyone all the chicken and tuna and stuff. These people just need food and don’t care normally about it being or not being vegan.
Thank you miladand
Thank you milad
Damn this man should get a Novel Prize
Thank you mr.beast and everyone who volunteer to do this charity  People on twitter have 0 brains
“I’ll do it myself” Thanos/Mr.Beast

THANK YOU MILAD!!
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!
for all the vegans grass lives matter🌿🌿 mr beast helped by killing the animals that eat you food 😇😈
MrBeast: Mi-Lad
thank u mild :)
Who eversaid thank-you melied in the comments actually watched the video
Thank
and they say he shouldn't waste money on some pointless squid game events... sike he fed 10k famillies... what did you do? shout out the that person on twitter with an "ANIME profile"
Thank you Milad for giving 25k!
Love you!?
so many people (vegans especially), are talking so bad to Jimmy. saying that you should’ve fed people veggies and healthy foods and not turkey is just insane. he is feeding people who need the food so their families can have a meal to feast together with. he is the most caring person i’ve ever seen, he is cleaning oceans, growing trees, and giving people money and making people happy. i can’t be more proud of the guy as a fan
Not the vegans trying to cancel him 🗿
Imagine being so entitled to be angry at someone giving away free food  People who are angry at this video are either stupid,vegan or people who say that mr Beast are doing it for cloud/content
Thank you milad
Thank you, Milad! Thank you, Mr. Beast! I was one of the many that received a turkey from you. God Bless!
Tank you milad and me beast

THAT VEGAN TEACHER WATCH THIS
Why are vegans on Twitter trying to cancel this man
Thank u Milad
Mr beast:feeds 10k people  Golden temple (which feeds 50k PPL every day): laughs in corner
F all the haters their not the ones helping the community
Vegan teacher: Oh, that’s another X in the nonvegan box for giving away another turkey
I blows my mind that vegans are trying to cancel him over this. Since when are turkeys who can’t solve 2+2 more important than feeding hungry human beings?
Thankyou milad! We love you!
Good job Jimmy

The vegan community is very unsuccessful even if you eat vegan nothing will change people will eat meat
#livelongjimmy
Thank you milad!!
I hate that thanksgiving isnt a thing in england
I'm surprised he fed almost a whole city 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯.
All these dumb vegans, humans are supposed to eat meat, we are omnivores. You can't argue that, if you eat strictly vegetables you will lack essential vitamins and minerals such as b12 which is only obtainable through meat egg and dairy. You can argue all you want about multivitamins and fortified foods. But at the end of the day it is not a natural source which is supposed to be obtained from meat. But you do you, doesnt effect me.
Turkey monster👹
Thank you Milad!
To bad I saw this after thanksgiving, I got a 20 pound Costco turkey lol
No one does it like the beast 👊🏻🇬🇧

You know, theres this funny aspect of capitalism, where it costs all those people more money in vehicle operation, sitting in line for over an hour, etc. than the free turkey is worth, if they only make minimum wage.

Amazing! I love your way bro. Using Money = More Money Made
You might wanna make the video a bit longer and put some ads in. I don’t think anyone would mind watching an ad for such a noble cause.  Love you Mr. Beast Keep up the good work! 👍
Karens
Thank u milad👍👍
This guy is feeding people and some people are getting mad at him for that 🤦

Thank you milad🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is a nightmare for Vegans
Man is litteraly getting hate for helping people by vegans Smh what has this world become
Did u killed 20000 turkey nice good job
LOL Turkeys are going extinct
*The Vegan Teacher Would Be Upset If She See This*
*The Vegan Teacher Would Be Upset If She See This*
I hope Nolan's still alive XDDD
vegans be mad
you dont deserve all those hate from vegas jimmy
Please give me some money
"why are you wasting money on recreating a tv show, you should spend it on charity"   Mr beast:
Ha lol the vegans
Honestly I've seen people say Jimmy just wants clout and isn't actually a good person, as much as I think that's a total lie, I would also like to point out that the motive doesn't matter as long as people are being fed like this.
Forcing others to being vegan is a piece of sheet
What ever vegans at least he helps a city
Hello Mr beast I'm a subscriber and I am from Philippines and I want u to come to Philippines I hope u see this comment
F cancel culture, he is actually helping people. Thats all that matters.
Thank you Milad!!
Thank you milad
Thanky MInlad
W beast!!!
Gave 5 turkeys to one family?!   That only means 4 families didn't get a turkey..   If you are going to give, at least be responsible.
Noice
Fck the vegans bro they would trade a humans life for a chicken to live
People who dislike this video is a vegan -_-
I can't believe the vegans on redit are angry on mrbeast for feeding families birds
good stuff Milad
To be fair, if he wants to help the world, don’t make the need for animals and agriculture increase because that increases greenhouse gases.
Vegans now : áaaaaahhhhhh not mr beast he was such a good guy and now hes a murderer me: f of vegans. Btw I dont hate all vegans not all vegans are bad
Screw the haters, Jimmy is literally his own charity giving away turkeys to people in need and making peoples thanksgiving
❤️
What about all those poor turkeys though? They had rights! RIP turkeys…  You should have given them Tofurky…
Thank you milad
Thank you milad

We sure he took many souls but the souls helped homeless peoples
Thank you Milad
Thank you milad :)
It's all good and nice.. but running the engine in line for hours would cost more than a turkey.. or 10.. and btw what is the definition of people in "need"? does someone, who drives a HUGE car actually need that turkey? (just basic american thing, drive a 5000cc car, alone, even if your destination is at footwalk distance) And no, i'm not criticizing Jimmy, but the mentality of american people, sue me And Jimmy, thanks for the effort in everyone's name!
Thank u millad

God bless you all.
Man I wouldn't be surprised if one day Mr beast starts putting on a costume and fighting crime at this point
I wish I was there because I am in dubai sooooooo sad .....
Sorry Mr. Beast, I bought a ham.
I never tried turkey does it taste like chicken

Thank you milad ❤️
vegan teacher reacting to this video be like:
Amazing
Jimmy is awesome
No turkeys were harm in making this video :D
What state do you live in?
He's an angel 😇
As well as the event is wonderful, and helping the poor is always the nicest gesture, but - I am seeing those Ford pick-ups, Toyota SUVs, Cryslers, <5 year cars. Do they really in a  need to accept the offered free.. ...turkey?
NOTE: No nolans were cooked in the making of this video.
Is vegans actually gonna cancel Mr beast?
Thank you miladdd!!!!
I’m mad i didn’t see an ad
Hey Milad is that subway tiktoker guy lol
Did only the people who has a car get a turkey?
spspspspp
All I am sad about is that 1000s of turkeys died 😭
Stay mad vigans
Rip Nolan
Thank you Milad
thx milad!!!!!!!!!!!!
Commenting so this gets more traffic
People who say this is bad well shut up he's feeding people and stop saying 'he's paying for murder' because they were already dead so they weren't killed after they said they were gonna do it
Thank you Milad
Thank u milad!!!!
Who is ur fav mrbeast crew member Everybody ; Chris, chandelier, or Karl Me :nolan
Yas
To think some vegans complained about this..💆🏻‍♂️at least he's doing something to help..
and people says he’s wasting money on useless stuff
Watching all the ads at the end to do my part
This hit me... Mr Beast Is truly a good Person.
MrBeast is a super human! Biggest fan from west Africa Liberia 🇱🇷
You’re the best
Reddit and TikTok is slowly turning into Twitter
Idk why some people hate Mr beast when he did all this for us
Thank you milad
We miss chandler🥲
mate what mr beast is doing is better than anyone else, not only is he providing us with entertainment with his stupid idea but he is also making money from it and giving it away
This is the guy people on Twitter we’re going off on for not helping people enough.
It's funny mr beast you feeding them who have 40k dollar car you have to donate food to Country like Africa
Thank you milad
All Turkey’s right now watching this: 😦
watching from the Philippines
Thank you Milad!
To all the people who say he isn't a good person because he killed 10000 turkeys, why don't you stop complaining unless your gonna make a change. Mr.Beast just wants to make everyone have a good Thanksgiving
Rip all turkey's imagine how many turkey's were killed rip
Vegans be like: 10.000 CoRpSeS !!!     (Lol)
Thank you milard
if vegans get mad its because they hate humans
I thought him spending 2m on making the 21m dollar squid game set was awesome..
Thank u Milad!!!

You guys are the best :)
I think he is Jesus's successor.
The vegans always have to ruin everything

Thank you Milad
milad is a chad
Yeah they can wait hours on a queue and  spend litres of fuel, but cant buy a turkey… probably 70 % of those people weren’t in need at all. Just greedy bastards

To those Vegans canceling mr beast for giving away Turkey instead of vegetables, let me tell you this Turkey is the symbol of American Thanksgiving and NOT A F-ING CABBAGE.

i mean people who have the money for a car don't really need turkey for dinner right? won't it be better to give them to some of the poorer who couldn't reach the place in their own cars?
Tank you Milad!
I wish I could help but I don’t have money of my own
Mr.beast can you help me please I’m unemployed and lost in a foreign country?

People make me sick🙄 imagine being such a horrible person you feel proud to post something like this😒 I hope you sleep well in your bungalow you modest jerk🦑 don’t listen to the crayon eaters cause people like you make the world go around

Why a lot of vegans hating in this like bro mrbeast literally fed   10.000 people
Thank you Milad
And of course, Reddit users throw a temper tantrum...for example, one person said: "wow Mr.Beast murder much." 😑 like really people need to get a life. and do something, but no all they can do is bitch about it......he's feeding thousands of familys.
thanks Milad!
The family who ask 5 are greedy, i hope they get diabetes
The massacre of turkeys tho
RIP Turkey's   ~2021

Thank you for helping people
Vegan be like nooooooooooooooooooo
Tod dressing up as a turkey man man on the billboard.
aight this the best person too bad I can't participate
Vegans seem to not realize that all these turkeys were already dead, it’s not like they were specially killed just for this video. Plus, complaining isn’t going to stop people from eating meat
Sorry to interrupt Jimmy, you are known to save lives. You are working to clean seas to save marine lives. You planted a lot of trees. And now you're giving away turkey, like a lot. You're killing them. Doesn't it sound a little hypocrite.?
Thank u Malad
Thank you Milad!
Thank you my lad
Thank you Milan !
Three minutes of a few hours, mostly giving is what this guy does. Well done Mr. Feast
Always love seeing such amazingly wholesome content from this channel. The main channel vids are great, but this is the highest quality stuff out there. Doing good one view (and large corporate sponsorship) at a time.
Vegans what is your problem? Why cant you eat your vegetables in peace?
Mr.Beast... you are truly a Beast
Mr beast fed approximately 58,000 people🙏
Anyone who is complaining that it’s turkey and not other vegetarian foods stfu he is helping everyone so much and if they need it you shouldn’t be complaining as long as they can eat
This is the proof why twitter is a toxic place.
2.9m
A turkey is like 20 bucks why wait in line for one
Thank you Milad.  Hahahahahahahha
Arigat
Thank you mill add!!!!!!!!
Thank You Jimmy and Jennie-o
COULD YOU STOP BEING A GOOD HUMAN FOR 5 MINUTES!!!
Thank You Milad For Helping Save The Seas!
Thank You, Milad!
Seeing this get blown up by the vegan reddit community for such a bad reason hurt me.
i dont understand how vegans can try to cancel a guy for giving away food to familys in need
Thank u Milad!! 😊
You Mean Turkey the Country ha?
Jimmy saving us from inflation

Thanks mr beast 😌🙏
The chicken will extinct cuz they keep eating them and killing them and we are not taking care of them😭😢😥
You vegans disgust me. A turkey can give a family a nice meal for thanksgiving for those who can’t afford big meals. Don’t be mad that you can have a big feast like the rest of us on thanksgiving. Just leave us alone and enjoy our meals
Thank you Milad!!!!!
Thank u malnd
vegan teacher: how about 100,000 begetables give away
Rest and peace to the chicken😢

People: Mrbeast should use his fortune to help people instead of making squid game! Mrbeast:
Come help us in Los Angeles !!

I think vegan people is going to be mad

Thanks for milad

Thankyou MILAD.
Thank you Mlad

Thank you milad!!!!!

Thank you Mr. Beast and Milad
Thanks ya Mr Beast, I'm not from United States but I feel good for the people there, I wish you the best kiddo and for your amazing team too
People trying to cancel mr beast come on now🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Are we all gonna skip over how fast Tucker has grown? We remember the island video and how he was just a newborn and now he's a whole toddler! 🥰
Milad is a madlad
thankyou malad
Just don’t let vegan teacher see this or it’s gonna be another rant 🙄
Thank you Milad!!!!!!
You are a YouTube genius and a great person. I admire and love you Jimmy
Its almost as if food prices going through the roof are not a good thing for the lower and middle class.... who would have guessed?
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!
nice
Apple
R.I.P for all 10,000 turkey
The turkey massacre
If he wins the powerball he could end world hunger
Not enough people are thanking the volunteers
And people say he doesn’t use his money for good 💀
and yet people are trying to cancel mr beast just cuz of squid game
Thank you milad
Imagine that vegan teacher rn.😂
Pls don't hate mr beast he is not waisting money he is spending it to help people
3:28 rip
Thanks musterd
Hlnzpq
Mulan Mirg is a legend. Thanks for featuring him in the video.
Thank you Mliad
thanks milad and everyone else who did this, just wish i could help do something like this in the future.
"Mr Beast isn't doing enough." -People who saw how much the Squid Game set-up cost. Mr Beast is literally the most helpful YouTuber as of now or at least he is better than Gretta Wordberg. Jimmy is the "Action speaks louder than voice." in human form. Ps. I love that Darren-Turkey in that food truck.
what thanksgiving im british
I swear those people on Twitter complaining about him not donating money and “wasting” money on the Squid Game video better have been joking
𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐝!!!
You did a good thing
Thankyou malllaat
And twitter users say that he doesnt give things for anyone in need
Thank you Milad
❤❤❤
Thank you Malik.
lmao nolan
Thank you milad
im a turkey…..
This is why I watch and like everything Jimmy puts out
Veagans’ boutta rage
Thank you Miladd
I just watched on shorts that mr.beast is having backlashes but i gotta say the reason he is being good and posting it online is for him to earn money to use for other people in other videos again stop saying if his good he should not post it online
Thank you Milad!!! And Mrbeast for feeding people for thanksgiving god bless all of you!! ❤️
You are a good man🤝
thank you milard
Thank you Mlad
Its good to see that although the childrens familys are poor, they still know who MrBeast is
Never had thanksgiving 🙁
Thank you milad
THANK YOU MILLAD!!!
@Beast Philanthropy No thank you for helping all these people!
Thankyou Milad!!
If anyone tried to hurt or cancel this man I'll personally single you out.
man your way too kind. for me. your group is the most epic group ever lol
Thank you Milad
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
How do I get in on these events how do I get notified my man
Thank you Milad!!!
funny enough before watching this video my family bought a jennie turkey anyways
To the vegans being toxic gtfo
RIP to all the turkeys that has been killed for this😢
God knows that family didn't need 5 fucking turkeys that's actually just greedy and ridiculous
Thank you milad☺️🦃
🤍🤍🤍
No way i thought in the thumbnail she was queen elizabeth
Honestly add more ads to these videos
u didnt feed my family
3:40 Nolan in da back XD
Why a lot vegan talking bad to the legend itself? First of all he didn't knew of other people opinion so don't be mean with him
of course the one time i'm in north carolina I miss something as massive as this :( ah but you love to see it done
Happy late Thanksgiving everyone 🍗🦃🐔
Thank you Milad!
You have to know the fact that the poor people will not have a car so the turkeys are never going to be given to them😅
🐐🐐🐐🐐
As someone from the Philippines would say....."SANA ALL"
Vegans are going to far. Like I'm starting to hate them and I don't even care that all vegans aren't the same they are causing problems. People can eat whatever they want you can't stop them.
Danke milad
Thank you Milad God for donating 25,000$

Mr Beasts bought 10000 turkeys to feed people. Employee:sorry we are all out of turkeys  Other people:
How much are they
I just came across this this channel while looking at MrBeast's main channel. I didn't know it existed.

Thank you Milad 🙌🏽
RIP Nolan. He was a real one

F in the chat for all vegans
the vegans are trying to cancel him they say he should have give vegies
Should've donated to homeless shelters
vegans on reddit MR BEAST IS A ANIMAL MURDER  me:nope he's just a cool guy with lots of money
Still laughing at the fact that the vegan subreddit are talking shit about Jimmy because he wasn’t feeding these people vegan food.
I feel bad for the people who had to kill and package 10,000 turkeys
Imagine trying to cancel Mr beast 😂
Thank you milorg
Vegan teachers not gonna like this.
who disliked this??
Thanks Milan your a great person. MrBeast is a awesome person to do this why hate?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Love to see it
ERTEW FFDTR

THX MLAD!
Mr. Beast is a person who only appears once in real history. A person who enjoys giving gifts to others. It is an honor to be living in the same era. If there is a chance, I would like to hold an event in Asia where your close friends are. I will become a YouTuber who spreads good influence like you. Thank you always. I wish you good health.
Hoping to help me for my needs  ....iam in a dialysis for kidney right now and has two tubes in my side of my waist......iam here from the phillipines . .....
Thank you Millad :)
Vegans be like...

This is why I love the mrbeast channels
2:49 Tucker was giving the man the Death stare when he was Walking away.😂😂
f2p player : giving us 20 gems in brawl stars   instead of 456 is better then feeding people 🤣

Omg, no wonder there was a turkey shortage.
R.I.P Nolan
not the vegans hating on him like stfu
the fact that people are trying to cancel him because this involved people eating meat is actually insane
Vegan teacher Belike:
"I DoN't LiKE mRbEaSt hE dID a SqUid GamE sO hE BaD"  Also Mrbeast:
The people that say he killed 10,000 animals suck
I WAS JUST WATCHING MILAD'S TIKTOK
And people have the audacity to bitch about Jimmy spending millions to make a replica of Squid Game.
Yet people still try to cancel this man...
Comment for the YT algorithm
Is this channel actually mr. Beasts or is it a fan account?
The fact that people are mad at you for recreating squid games when you do thing like this regularly makes no sense. You are one of the kindest and best creators ever and I hope that someday the world can repay everything that you have done for the world
People REALLY in need dont drive cars! and all these cars look sick and are worth allot more than anything i ever had in my life so good job mr beast . You saved the world 💋🌹
Guys keep your opinion to your self stop hating because he gave turkey away gosh
People are stupid. Mr.Beast donated 10k turkeys to people in need and yet that somehow makes him a bad person because turkey isn't a vegan food.
And this was how turkeys went extinct          Jk you are such. Wonderful and kind hearted person, keep up the good work<3
I'm watching the entire channel. 11/27/2021 Day 111 Ads  1326
I bet the vegan teacher will be mad
Thank you Milard!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Milad

Tucker: give me that dam pato
Why are people disliking the video?!!!! This is a good video for 2 reasons   1: he is giving away turkeys to people in need.  2: This is the guy who has given away so much to the community   Mrbeast keep it up man.
Thank you and God bless

Also thank you malin!!
But bc you buy all the turkey what will happen when a person did not come there?
😂💪🏼❤💪🏼
3:23 R.I.P Nolan
The fact is that he has a big heart and wants to help others. It shows that he cares. He isn't faking stuff he actually does stuff to help and feed others. He wants to help others whenever he can. He isn't other YouTubers who act like they care on camera. Y'all know the YouTubers I'm talking about. I hope.
All the turkeys watching this vid  👁👄👁 😢
So that’s why my local Wegmans had no turkeys...
Un vegano va a ver esto y se le va a safar ilumina tornillo
Anyone heard from Nolan yet? 👀
W human W life W everything W friends
thank you phil
Rip all the vegans watching this video
Philantrophy?????Its joke!!!????😣😣😣

Thank you Milad and Jimmy!
RIP nolan
Thank you milad
BRRRRUUUUUUHHH THANKSGIVING WAS 1 MONTH AGO!!!!
Thank you Milad!!
“I forbid you from buying from any other brand this thanksgiving” By that single quote you know that some turkey selling businesses lost money.
Yall the shit for this
thank you milard
Ty for the turkey
If you hate mrbeast, i will steal your human rights.
Thanks to milad and everyone else helping feed 10,000 people
Thank you malad
hey mr.  Beast are you sure that they were people with needs, well, many of them have very good cars, I do not think that if they go in cars, they are people with needs.   For me, it was rather people who do not want to pay or do the turkey and they pretended to be low-income people so he cant have turkey for free jajaja. free turkey even the mayor of the city will go.
He the guy Twitter wants yet they complain
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good job
thank you milad
Thank you milad!!! And thank you mr beast for letting us have a place to donate knowing it will go to good. A kind soul ❤️
Thank you milad
Thank you Milad for helping people !!!!!!

Thank you to Milad
Thank you Milad!!

Image vegan teacher reaction
I heard there was a turkey shortage this year 🧍🏻‍♀️ 3 days later i find this im so dead LOL
vegetarians left the chat
Mr beast is just a good human being why can't we all be like this
lmaooo that guy did not donate 25 k his face told a lie
Thank you milad!!!
Kinda makes you want to move to Jimmys town to get these awesome gifts.
The dislikes are from pissed vegans
Those people who are giving mrbeast crap about feeding people don't know what good is
That's dope 😎
Thank you Milad!!
Vegan: >:(
some poeple will not be happy with this lol
Wow! Nice
Thank you Millad
like who the f dislike the video SMH
I think I figured out why there was a turkey shortage
Thank you to Milad,
Thank you milad
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful video
Thank you milad mirg
This mans is super nice yet people are saying to not make the squid game video bc its a waste of money when mr beast already spent like 3 yrs helping earth
Honestly Nolan about to be sent home with a random family to be cooked was the best wind down ending. I laughed so hard and realized I really needed that reason to smile.  Thanks Mr Beast Crew!! RIP Turkey Nolan
thx milad!
if my channel reaches 1k I will make a music to mrbeast  si mi canal llega a 1k le hago una musica a mrbeast
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!!!! (I just realized he donated to mrbeast this man did the impossible)
Thank you mllad
pov: you are that vegan teacher
Where the f is the people who wants to cancel mrbeast again because of the Squid game controversy?
Please come to Vegas we need those blessings too
Hi
Thank you Milad!!!
Milad should do a video giving away free subway sandwiches.
thank you milad
Mr Beasts helping people  Vegan teacher thats what monsters do  Love you man<3
Im still shocked that people were saying how ungrateful he was for wasting 3 million on squid games, this guy is literally the rich person people want and it’s still not enough to those assholes
If you fed more, they'd be grateful more (joke)
10,000 families guys that in the average size of a family 3/4 ppl 40,000 ppl, and vegans are hating on this man. Jesus man what’s wrong with people. Mr. Beast and team keep it up guys.
Thank you Milad :)
No wonder I could not find a turkey this thanksgiving
Hes always loves to help people and everyone thinks that he is just doing it for money and other vids are scripted. He is not  same other youtuber who only spends 10k bucks and doing the pyramid investment. Mr.Beast spends millions duhhhhhh.
boost im boosting boost helping people love that give back what you can go green make a change boost like and subscribe
Thx Milad
thanksss millllaaadd!!!!!
Picking up food in a new model  4x4 truck is quite sus
Thanks Milan ur poggers
Jimmy, you are so nice to give away free turkeys and also thank you
🥰
I am disappointed that they left Nolan in the video after they 'gave' him away to be cooked. should have just cut him out of the rest of video. like yep he got cooked and eaten. also thanks Milad for donating and all the volunteers for going out and helping.
Jimmy chad
Is this video vegan friendly?
Next you should learn how to not buy your friends.  And tbh…tons of people think you are amazing but don’t watch your content because you make it for little children. It’s obviously because they way you exaggerate EVERYTHING (like your facial expressions)  And your tumbnails…. So maybe make it more…normal? So it will be enjoyable by regular people aswel-
bruh
Thank you Milad!
Thank you Milad! And MrBeast for being so generous!
Damn, the US is lucky to have Jimmy
Poor turkeys. Couldnt you have bought like tofu instead? :-)
This is his penance for blowing up a hospital.
And nolan was never seen ever again lol
Thank you Milad!!!
this man is just dumping piles of money into fire 1 to entertain people 2 to help millions of people and I rSpEkT tHaT
Thank you milad

Thanks Milad, Keep up with the good work, Mr Beast i can see a huge amount of effort here.

How did that little kid say philanthropy correctly
The fact that people (aka vegans) are mad at him for feeding people who need this are honestly just selfish, not everyone is vegan and they need to suck it up
why did they have to get rid of dis like btw i love jime
Thank You Milad
Thanks milad

This is why Mr. Beast it's the best youtuber around here. We must protect Jimmy qt all costs.
Thank you Milad!!!
THHAAANKK YOOOOU MAILLLAADD 🙌🏽 💯
It makes absolutely zero sense how people hate on Jimmy. Their reasoning is because 'he doesn't need to spend all that money on videos', but that's his whole business plan. He said he doesn't want a dollar in his account when he dies. This man is changing the world and it's happening during our lifetime. Be thankful for him ❤️ and stay awesome Jimmy 💪👍
On thanks giving my mom choked on a Turkey   Oh and if ur wondering she’s fine
Milad the cookie man.
thank you milard the subway man
Love it
thank you milad!!!
Rip Nolan in chat

Thank you milad!!!
Happy Thanksgiving
Thanks Milad!!!
My eyes honestly read the title as “I ate 10,000 families on Thanksgiving”
Mr beast the first YouTube to give away 10 thousand turkeys spend an insane amount of money and put it into a 4 minute video
thank you milad !!!!!!!!
Thank You Milad!!!!
People complaining about squid game, and they don't talk about this channel. Men I didn't even had chicken and Ms beast is incredible for doing this. Thank you Milad
so these people came in their 20k dollars car to get a free turkies?
Thank you Milad :)
MILARD WAS IN THIS
cancel him, not enough turkeys
Nolan has escaped solitary but is now inprisoned again XD
I'd love to get more videos where we got to learn more about Darren  and how he's doing working for beast philanthropy!
Why this people need help? They drive the best cars...
THANK YOU MILAD !1111111111111!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!!!!!!!!11
LMAO Nolan is a clown lol
A moment of silent for all the 10,000 turkeys who gave their lives to feed 10,000 toxic humans

thank u milad!
Boost
Thank you Milad
Thank you milad
stupid vegans getting mad about this lmao
Thank you to Milad
Thanks Milad!!
Thank you milad so much!!
This is a very amazing thing he is doing and people are trying to take him down. People really don't have a brain. People have brains for a reason. who tf cares if he is donating meat or animals?? Thanksgiving is a day of enjoying a feast and giving thanks not harrass someone for eating meat or supporting a cause.
Its weird to think that actually more then 10k turkeys got murderd just for a diner
thank you milad
Nice vid
TO MUCH!! OMG! WOW
Where are those saying mr beast wadting his money
Vegan Teacher typing…
I have been watching his content for so long and everything he does still gives me a warm feeling.
This is so sad that he still calls him mill add not milad
is this a legit MrBeast channel?
Hey comment bots, please don ' t spam the comment section please, it ' s not worth it, i did for a day and i don ' t recommend it.
Mom: go get a turkey from the store Son: ok mom  Son: mom there are no turkeys… MrBeast took em Mom: WHAT!!!
So that's where all of the turkey's gone to
That vegan teacher NOoOOOoOOOOOOOoO!!!🤣
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!
Who doesn't admire Mr beast on his doings.....
Mr beast don’t listen to those vegan people they think that eating animals is murder but eating animals is what we were born of and forever will be
Vegan techear complaning about turkey
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!
Wasn't thanksgiving last month?
Would no one talk about animal killing??
🐐🐐🐐
Thank you milad
r/vegan Having a meltdown
Thank U MILAD
Thank you millad
MILADDD
THANK YOU MILAD

Thank you milad
Hey everyone! :D I hope you stay safe and have a nice day, God bless you! <3
This is the most amazing Thanksgiving gift that Mrbeast has given to this city.
Thank you Milad
Bruh that vegan teacher is MAD now
what will the vegan teacher think of this xD
Bro vegans getting mad he killed 10,000 Turkeys like this man is helping people in need
We can help by not skipping any ads on this video 👍
Man people don’t like you giveing people turkey just beacuase they are vegan like bru? You literally are helping people! Any way god bless you;)❣️💞💓💗💕❤️
This video deserves millions more views.
The only thing is I feel like making it a car driven event like ppl needing a car to load the turkeys is limiting the number of ppl who get them. Since a lot of ppl who can't afford food most likely won't be able to afford a car either
At this point it's just natural!
I mean thats not good for the climate better to give them some vegetarian food
Thank you millard
Thank u millard
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖

bro can these dream stan bots please stop replying to everything, all of them say the same thing like "tommy init secret channel" or "tommy init new channel" bro no one cares about tommy init especially since your trying to get fame from the comments of a charity video
What’s sad is ppl will still try to find ways to bash MrBeast
I think it’s amazing what you all are doing but did that person really need 5 turkeys?
Darren the GOAT
Your videos are phenomenal and my family and I love watching them especially seeing the smiles on people's faces. Also how you have become a blessing to many. HOPEFULLY some day we are able to be in one of your challenges before we move across seas
Oh lol miles is crazy lol giving away cookies and other stuff I would not expect anything less also thanks
I don't wanna be that guy... But there are people who can't even afford normal food in this world... Why give away food to people who can afford a car... Still good tho nice job.. I'm sorry... I'm just that guy
What if Mr. Beast is Jesus that came back down
E

Thank you milad
You are a great man
THANK YOU SIR MILAD..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

PETA is after you man
Thank you maled
not even kidding when there’s a certain group of people that would much rather you not feed anyone at all because you gave out meat
It’s just so f***ked that MrBeast is doing more for this community on Thanksgiving than their own government lol
and people say he should have spent the squid game money to help people
WHER DID NOLAN GO
1.2k dislikes, oh dear vegans
Thank You Milad!!!
Any other ways I can help
wait that not good since 10k turkeys died :(
mr beast is litterally the incarnation of jesus and im not even joking
Bro vegans are mad at Jimmy for killing so many turkeys like bto aint no way that vegans arent mad at people the get the turkeys and kill them and thwn putting it in store and not mad but as soon as Jimmy gives out turkeys the vegans are mad like bro aint no way Jimmy bout spend money on bill boards for free grass like bro what
Is this why there’s a turkey shortage

This is kinda messed up. A lot of these cars are really good cars. It is a shame people are taking advantage of your kindness when there’s going to be actual poor people who cant afford it who would love to have one. Shame of those guys.
Thank you Milad
Wow Ur an amazing person Jimmy
THANK YOU MILAD
I just misread the title and thought it said “I Just Fed a Family 10,000 Thanksgiving Meals!”
That vegan teacher is going to hate you more
Thanks for feeding the people in need because some poeple do not have nice and fancy thanksgivings like us! THANK YOU MILAD!!!
0:00
Thank u Milad !!!!!!
Thank you milad
people: angry because mr beast ""wastes"" money on recreating squid game in real life also mr beast: casually giving away free turkey to 10k families, planting an immense number of trees and cleaning the oceans
I'm surprised there are no angry vegans in the comments.
LITERALLY THE BEST YOUTUBER I HAVE EVER SEEN😄😄😄😄
1:03 Literally exactly what I was thinking
Do people with cars really need turkeys for help?
Thank u milad
Thank you Milad!

Thank You Malid!!!!!!!!!
thank you milad!
THANK  YOU MILAD MIRG!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jimmy you're real. I don't give comments about the people's say it's marketing cover for video. But feeding 10k people's is really not a easy one. Keep up your good work #teammrbeast
Respect all the turkeys who got slaughtered 😖❤️
POV:mr beast is hated by vegans  lol
That vegan teacher is unhappy for sure  Vegan teacher - it's about view it's about money we vegan we devour youtube (not taken for the rock)

Thankyou Milad!!❤️❤️
Thank you Malad!!!!
THANK YOU MILADDD!!!!!
Thank you Millad!
Thank u milad
This is the side all the narrow minded folks on Twitter never get to see when they talk about the MrBeast Squid Games without any point of reference to Jimmy and his amazing giving to those in need. The most important day, I think, was when Jimmy met Darren, the real MVP, and his help in making the MrBeast Philanthropy thrive together.
Thank you Milad!!!! .
The facts he’s put this on a channel with 1%  of the amount of subscribers on his main channel shows how much this guy just wants to help people
Lady said 5 turkeys lmaooo  Well she reselling
We have two Jennie O turkey factories in my town and when I was in high school the turkey that got pardoned one year was from my area and I think FFA kids from my school got to go present it. So yeah, turkeys are kinda big where I live
i like how people from twitter tells him to use the money for squid game to help other people while he’s just casually doing this…
Vegan teacher be like- EXPELLED
And ppl have the audacity to say "He isnt doing enough for the ppl with his money" after his squid game video , bruh , he does way too much , he can spend some for his channel !
Thank u milad
Thank you malad
thank you milad
Jennie-O came in hella clutch. great donation, great publicity, and it made for a great video, all around big W.
Thank you Milad!
10000 lives ...
Send this to a vegan
Alot of those people looked like they would have no issue affording their own turkey...
This is one of the first newer mr beast videos without a honey sponsor
Thanks for helpping people milad!!!!!!
thanks milan
This man is unbelievable! I hope and pray that he continues to do such great things as long as forever. Such a heartwarming fellow.....
Thank you milad!!!!!
We need more people like Mr beast, he's an amazing guy who actually thinks about the people in need. We have so many people in society that don't give a f about others, they have everything they need while let others suffer. Thanks Mr beast and have an amazing thanksgiving(sorry I'm late lol I don't celebrate this event)
Thank you milad
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The vegan teacher not gonna be happy bout this one
Let's goo Milad!!
wow
I’m sad my friend couldn’t have his thanksgiving because both his parents had COVID Sad to see people not do thanksgiving cause of things that happened
Imagine the world without jimmy
I'm never disappointed with Mr Beast videos ❤️
"WhY WouLd YoU SPEnD sO mUcH mOnEY on SqUId GamE 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Thank you Milad!
thank you malfanzo for your donation.
Just came back from r/vegans… don’t listen to them please turkeys is nutritious food not corpses ok
Not everyone seems to need help for thanksgiving . Waiting in line with a Mercedes SUV doesn’t make you person in need.
wait, is that milad mirg?
mrbeast: I killed 10000 turkeys for thanksgiving
Rip thatveganteacher
Mrbeast should deserve a thank you to the president
Caussally just feeding 10,000 families for Thanksgiving
Thank you Milad!
Thank you My Lad!!!!
I hate adds but always make sure to watch them trough on this channel, it's the least I can do
Every vegan be like 😱
Thank you Miladd!!
Thank you Milad!
twitter haters: "why is mr beast making a multi-million dollar squid game instead of donating to the poor its a waste of money and ignoring the plot of squid game"  hope these dumb people who just comment hate in twitter be satisfied now with this video.
ty milad!!!!
poor turkeys :(
Thank You Milad
Thank you Milad ❤️
Thank you milad

Thank you Milad! Thank you MrBeast! This is amazing!!!
Thank you for helping the people a giving turkey to the people in need I would love to meet a nice person
Thank you Milad!!!!!!  You are an amazing person.
Karen: "Oh my Gosh when you reach this level of rich maybe you should use that money for good"  Mr Beast: I Fed 10,000 Families For Thanksgiving! Litterly buying out grocery stores and donating to homeless shelters I bought a Homelessman  A house Dedicating a chanel to donations ...   Smh the nonsense ppl say
It would be cool if you would.. go to a poorer country
Mr.Beast is such an amazing person
Bruh every single moron in r/vegan (not targeted against every vegan it's just the people there) is literally hating you rn
Thx Milad
Thank you Milad and Mr. Beast for blessing so many people this thanksgiving!!!
1:16 *My man chewing that turkey for days*

This is so awesome, I did this and it was exactly like this only we only had 400 people and 45 volunteers, how you even organized this is a miracle
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!
Salute to you Mr Beast!! Nice to see there's still some great people in this cold 🌎!!!

The Vegan Teacher is typing........

Thankyou milad i
I like how jimmy pins his own comment yet Milad casually gets 3 times the likes
Cancel culture : Let’s cancel Mr.beast for not using his money to help people  Mr.Beast : Gives away 10,000 turkeys 👁👄👁
no one wrote "Thank you Milad"😂 but I am gonna write it...Thank you Milad.
ty milad!!!!!
They picked it up in cars!!! Do they really need it??!! Those who really needs are in Indian street : 'beggers'. Btw appreciate your good deeds
You should have made it a little bit longer.
Did u get Nolan back?
Milad you have a massive scholng
Engine dance op

Thank you millad

Now That Vegan Teacher can't say he doesn't give food to others.
Thankyou MILAD
Why did I read the title as "I fried 10,000 familys"
Thank you Milad
Thank u malad
Mr beast for president
Thank you Mlad
Thank you milad!!!!!!!!
Jimmy's generosity is incredible, but honestly this doesn't seem like the best way to help those who are actually in need. It's more like a regular Mr.Beast video. Many of those cars don't exactly scream "in need", maybe what they actually need is a lesson in personal finance.
All the dislikes are from PETA communities.
Mr beast humilde como siempre 😎
Hope the vegan teacher doesn't see this.
Thank you Milad👍🏼
Thank you Milad
i cant believe theres still people saying that he is bad
If thatveganteacher saw this😳
Im convinced that God couldn't create a better person than mr. beast, long live jimmy!!!
Nolahn is being cooked
THANK YOU FOR HELPING
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you milad
It Is going to be hard FOR VEGAN PEOPLE {:

Milad*
Thank you Milan!!!!!!
Go to hell if you think beast is because he is feeding people in need
I don't think Nolan will taste good
Mr Beast is the revolution. No one has ever done things like this in the world.

Thank you Milad!
These vegan mofos really insulting him for feeding people
Here’s a suggestion,! Since ZHC’s instant influencer just recently ended, they are customising an entire city with the winner! You should help them buy furniture and gather people who really need the houses :D ( of course, this is just a suggestion! You don’t have to do it <3 )
⚜️⚜️⚜️⚜️
Send turkey and video games clothes, tennis money thanks santa hahaha 🤣 joke that good content
So this is why vegans hate him lol
Thank you Miladdd

I think you should make longer videos. You would get more revenue and I think we all do enjoy wathcing these videos.
sometimes it feels like removing dislike button is ok.
I love how you just helped 10,000 people and you have fed countless others and people still say you need to not spend your money on the squid games project which was an amazing video btw

Yt:this is good Twitter:Noooo dont waste your money you dummy
THANK MILADDDDDDDDD I RESPEECT HIM
I dont get it. Shoutout to Mrbeast and all for this setup and the giveaway of food. But people in those kinda cars are really in need. I think homeless poeple and people on the streets or slums deserve the food.
I subscribed just now, give me my free turkey 🦃
And people are still complaining that he doesn’t do enough for charity
Thank you milad
And they said you weren’t generous
Thank you Milad!!!
Thank you milar!!!
Thank you Milad !!1
It is kindda sad that this channel only have 7 videos. Give aways are entertaining but giving away to people in need instead of people in greed is better. Hoping to see more on this channel. keep up the work man.
Are people seriously mad at him for this? If they were vegan or vegetarian they would’ve said no wtf?
THANK YOU MILAD!
thank you malad
#teamseas dont stop the giving
This video is so good it doesn't even have dislikes!
Verry gud
Poor turkeys😭
Thank you milad
1 million people feed??
Thank you
O
Thank you my lad!!!! ❤️
these videos to be longer beasty!
Some bish actually told him that instead of spending money on mrbeast squid game, he should help the impoverished.  You call this not helping the impoverished?!
Thank you Milad for donating to beast philanthropy
I subscribed boss beast, you are so kind sir
Wow mrbeast makes the world so much kinder! That vegan teacher is going to be like: nOoO aNiMaL aBuSe
I would love to just help them giving stuff away
He should make a 10 hour video with lots of ads in it just black screen and all the ad money goes to people in need, and the 10 hour video is suggested to watch on like a second tab on mute
THANK U MILAD (idk if i spelled it correct but yeah thank you for donating)
Thank you Mr. Beast!!
imagine being in poverty and can afford a car
THANK YOU MILADDD!!!!!
cool vid
Thank you Milad❤️lol
Thankyou Milad ❤️❤️
Thank you Millad!!!!!
THANK YOU MILADDDDDD YOUR THE BEST PERSONN
Vegans watching this 😢
so they are rich enough to drive cars but not to buy a turkey? what in the america is this
Mr Beast . Please come in India and do the donations. Unlike USA, the needy and poor people of India don't have a car to collect free food. They even don't have a pair of slippers. Then you will get the satisfaction of actual Thanksgiving. ❤️
Mrbeast goat🐐🔥
The vegan community is literally hwting on this legend for *killing* all the turkeys when its literally just frozen bouht turket
Turkey lives matter
Thank you Subway boy
Padayon lang JIMPAL.💜
Thank you malad
Quote from twitter "He should help people instead of spending money, he doesnt even give it to people who need it"🤣
That Vegan Teacher could probably make a video about this because of how many turkeys are there! and Mr. Beast is still the legend of mankind!

Thank you milad!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!
It's realy funny how 2 million views in 3 days dose no longer impress me for mrbeast ...
Reasons why there are haters on mr beast channel.  1.Jealous of his money 2.want him to fail  3.mad cuz they didn’t get any turkey from him
I don't understand how in america people who can afford cars can still be hungry
I LIVE IN TURKEY (the country turkey)
THANK YOU MILAD!!!!

At least mrbeast is giving food for people who need it, those haters suck
Thank you milad
Mr.beast giving free turkey to 10,000 people.   Vegans: why did you kill 10,000 poor animal😠😠 and if he is doing good why is he posting it in YouTube why not help them and don't post in yt  Me: Bruh his posting it in YT to get more money to give that money to people who needs
*vegans are typing*
Why would someone dislike this video
3:48  Mrbeast: subscribe for free Turkey  Me: *still waiting for my free cookie*
Thank you milad

Everyone: says something random Me: Uhhhh, Thanks you Milad
thank you milad.....
Mr. Beast 💖
We Love You Jimmy
Good going guys (shame about losing Nolan but he went out for a good course) 😂
Thank you Milad!!!!!!
Thank u Millad
I can already hear the vegans coming    Also Mr beast casually making the world a better place
we really appreciate it you making so much effort and giving charity but from my opinion as a vegan eater just try to make it vegetarian so no animals get harmed or killed but still keep up the great effort and i know for sure you will reach the #TeamSeas goal even before 2021 ends
Thank you midis
The vegan teacher watching be like 😮 😡 🦃
Vegan teacher found dead in her room
Beast is making this world a better place for sure.❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love Mr Beast and all he does but this was hard to watch. Tossing dead turkey bodies like they are nothing is heart breaking. I don't get all the people making of vegans. If you love Jimmy's videos so much for helping, why does you compassion suddenly stop now? It doesn't make sence.
Thank you milad
Ty maild
How do people dislike this content
Notice Mr. Beast holding an imaginary microphone? If u noticed reply!

Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you milad
Love u Mr beast and thanks for giving that staff
Thank you milad!!!
Imagine if Tucker is the main antagonist
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!
For the people saying that he should’ve given people vegan crap. You think that’s actual food? Because it’s actually classified has junk food :/
Jimmy Chris chandler Karl and their entire team  you have the best job anyone could wish for. Besides a paycheck that will make you weak at the knees each month. You get satisfaction that you genuinely help people
Thank you Millad!!!!!!

Reject state sponsored welfare system, give the richest of the rich tax cut, privatize everything, and let youtubers feed the whole city: this is America.
Good thing my bully is not right there 😃  Her name is rosey so ask her name to give her turkeys 😀
What an OG

I thought you gonna give turkey🇹🇷
remember we just fed 10k people with only our eyes...😍
Everyone: Wow jimmy did such a nice thing Me: What about those 10,000 turkeys they all died
It's just insane the many kind acts that Mr.Beast does so often, I'm glad this world has a man like Jimmy because he is endlessly nice.
The need for turkey just increase but the need for food just deceased
Thank you Milad!!!!!!!
Imagine being the guy who used to sell turkeys in this town every Thanksgiving.  He can't feed his family this month . Thanks mr beast
Sorry Jimmy I already bought my 6 kg turkey from another brand; this video wasn’t made yet :(
People in need of Turkey got nice cars ..how does that make sense ?
I'm just here to like and say thank you for being such a great person
Jimmy gives 10000 turkeys so hundreds of thousands of people have a nice Thanksgiving
Beast ❣️ millad is anyway a cutie
bro you gotta give Darren some rewards i just love him and i wanna see a video where you could surprise him with something nice because of all the work that he puts in :D
Just found out about this channel, literaly changing the world
I have a question how can they afford cars but cant afford food
thank you mail man
Milad

Thank you milad!!!!!
Superb man.. helping poor peoples

Thank you Milad!!!!!!!!
The b e s T part 3:48
Thonks Milan!1!!  Lol
The Haters Who Hated Him For Wasting Money For The Squid Game Project, Now What Would You Call This -_-
very nice mrbeast
Jimmy spend millions on squid game, 3 days later TURKEY GIVEAWAY
Nolan is better than Karl
they all have cars they cant be poor
Man spent a minimum of 20k on this video to make it 3:53 seconds long, now that is a good person, he doesnt do it for the ad revenue no he actually did it to help people and ofc put a smile on millions of others faces
why didn't you feed me? I've never had a Thanksgiving meal oh wait you don't feed anyone, these are just staged to make you look like a great person, ofc you can do that if you have money to throw around gg can't wait to see you get exposed for all this one day
thanks Milord
Thank you Milad
thanks Milord
MILADS A LEGEND
thank you miladd!!!!!!!!!!!

MrBeast is pretty much my most favourite youtuber no cap
Thank you Milad
thanks millllaaaadd
It’s kinda crazy how on his main channel, mr beast gave away close to 4 mil. But on his secondary channel, he basically took the same amount, he gave away, and gave it away to those who have none. Dude is an inspiration.
i subscribed where's my turkey?
"feeding 10,000 families with 10,000 turkeys"  *gives 1 family 5 turkeys"
Thank you milad!!!
YOUR Awesome
I’ve been part of these food drives, you meet some amazing people, honestly anyone out there, get some friends, and volunteer. Most places do the same thing during Christmas. It’s a huge help, and it’s honestly a lot of fun to be a part of. Overall it’s a win win
vegans watching this 😦
Thank you milad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you Malid
Thank you milad!!!
With a line that long, it is truly mind blowing that a YouTuber has done more for people in need than many governments or organizations. Look how many people really needed this food. It makes me feel sad for how many are in desperate need with no safety net at all.
Thank you milad👍☺️
People hating him for being good, bruhhh💀💀💀. Guess some people never changed, they did the same with Martin Luther King, Jesus and probably more.
thank you mladddd

Rules when watching mrbeast 1: watch the whole vid OR ELSE  2: Like NO MATTER WHAT    3: Enjoy✓
The amount of backlash he is receiving is absolutely fucking disgusting. They are all hating on him telling him to do this or that but they themselves don't even do it. Mr beast, don't mind the haters just remember that there are people supporting you
This is cool mrbeast do this
Thank youu!!!!❤️

Hi
Hi milad mirg!!!!!
That's what I always say, he helps people even though people complain about him doing squid game. Now they won't complain because people are getting food
thanks Milad and Mr Beast!
Your amazing and who cares about the haters at least your helping people out unlike all those haters
Lets pray so the the vegan teacher wont watch this vid lmao
I feel like the people hating on this video are the haters hating on his squid game video, which I think was a really good video and Jimmy needed to have fun. He’s still the best YouTuber in the world
Thank you Milad
Where are the Jennie-O's turkey's coming from other than their factory
THANK YOU MILAD!!
If you ever feel dumb just remember 1k idiots disliked this video

Hey jimmy iwanna to translate your videos in hindi on my another channel can i have your permission ?
That not 10k
The dance at the end is actually so smooth wtf
hi
Vegan people be like: ......
Thank you Miyagi for donated 25k $ to charity.
Just remember that Jimmy is one of our blessings even though he didn’t help me or other ppl, we shouldn’t be greedy and just be grateful and appreciate he has done for 4 years

When you see milad coming. YAY. Milard is here
To all of those vegans hating on Mr. Beast for giving out non-vegan turkeys: shut up.
Heard about people talking shit about this video on r/Vegans on Reddit and honestly it’s sickening to think that Jimmy is faking what he does, or that he’s a horrible person for giving away “non-vegan meals”, he’s literally such a kind soul who does so much for his community and the planet that the fact that people can’t even be happy that thousands of families are getting fed this thanksgiving is upsetting
Thank you Milad!!!!!!
Thank you Milad!!!
This is freaking amazing.
Vegan teacher is gonna be so mad once she sees this video
How was chris enjoying his turkey
I guess you can call him mr feast
THANK U MILLAD
i disliked the video and no one will never know
THONKS MILAD
I love you slim jim
I really respect all the work you put in to helping others, but I can also see why we haven't been getting any turkeys to sell at my work, which bites. I appreciate all the hard work and effort you put in, I just wish Jenie-Os was spreading to love to us up in Alaska, the turkey shortages made some families pretty sad for Thanksgiving.
Well I don't celebrate Thanksgiving but im happy that u are giving foods :)
Thank you Milad!!
how can my family receive your help
Rip the turkeys
Vegans: raging
Imagine vegans watching dis
Thank you milad!

Happy Thanksgiving Jimmy. You blessed these people, you will be blessed more. ♥️♥️♥️
"I forbid you from buying any other brand..."  Me, a vegetarian: Oh no. Now I can't buy any fake turkey this year...guess I'm just having side dishes.
Thankyou Mr Beast!!!!!

Thank you to everyone who put their time into this, it is absolutely lovely and heart warming to see us come together no matter whom is what and where their situation stands. Thank you to Mr.Beast for dedicating your time, and your wealth to things such as this. Thank you to Jenni-O for providing families with a wonderful meal to spend time around, For putting in a hand to the pile. And of course, Thank you Milad for being a team player. It takes a village to raise a child, but it takes a community to make a village, you are the guidance.(Probably doesn’t make sense but my grandpa would say it lol.)This was a hard holiday for me, but the spirits ive seen everywhere have kept my heart warm to it. Thank you.

Love you so much Jimmy! 💜💜💜💜💜  I made a change to my username, I can’t believe I didn’t think of doing it sooner as a really big fan with me loving you just as much as BTS as people and Ellen, what the heck. I made a sacrifice of replacing Pokémon with MrBeast, but it was worth it! 💜 There’s not enough available characters left for me to use both with BTS and Ellen Degeneres in the name.

O boi cant wait for that vegan teacher
Thanks millad
Hi Milad.
..
3:02
mr beast you are so amaaaaaaaaaaaazing, you paid for the slaughter of so many birds, gave people turkeys who already bought turkeys , with your money you can probably end world hunger for human beings! keep up the great job.... 00:42 doesn't even know what he'd do with so many dead bodies in his trunk, he might as well donate some just like you did. oh 1:58 I FELT SO SORRY FOR THIS WOMAN IN THE CAR, now she can feed her family too. I also hope tucker grows up and realizes how good Mr Beast is cause ya'll underappreciate him.
I can't belive Jimmy you really give 10,000 people an turky they gona be happy for this christmass and stay safe Jimmy and take care of your self.
Can i have some turkey Mr. Beast! Hehehe
Milad, such a nice guy :)
thank you mr beast and milad too
THANKS Milad!
That's crazy . He is doing all that while filming arguably one of the biggest if not the biggest youtube videos ever. GREAT GUY
I would never skip the ad in any Beast philanthropy video, idc if it was the whole music video ad
Mr beast in thanksgiving next year: I Fed 100,000 Families For Thanksgiving just add another zero after every year
Thank you Milad

Thank you  Milad!
Im going to miss Nolan, he was a .....................
it's annoying when you're from Turkey and they constantly say turkeys.
thank you Milad
THANKS MILAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!    Who donate that much ur amazing!!!
At this point what can Jimmy can't do to help
Thank you, Mr. Beast! Thank you, Milad!
Someone: who’s the nicest person? Me: EASY, MRBEAST!
I’m subscribed to all your channels
poggers
thank you mustard
Why do we praise a brand which perpetuates  the animal holocaust?  These birds come from FACTORY FARMS where birds suffer immensely, and murdered at a fraction of their lifespan SO WE CAN EAT THEIR DEAD BODIES RATHER THAN VEGAN FOOD.  Shame on you, Mr Beast, shame on all of you.
Thank you Milad!
Love from Nepal.  Big fan sir.
Kind NEVER ENDS
Thank you mailed
This is for the people who said  That jimmy is wasting not spending his money on the homeless
Shout out to Darren. Nice work, that was a big undertaking and it went smoothly as it seem. GJ
Sending good wishes to you this Thanksgiving! Good food that fills your table, good health as you work hard, and good times with family and friends. May you have all the best delights in life. Happy Thanksgiving! 😀😀😀❤

Thank you milad

THANK YOU MILAD
"Mr Beast should do good stuff with his money  and not do Squid Games"

I will not be surprised if jimmy will be the president of usa in the near future.
Thank you Milad!!!
"omg mr beast why would you 'waste' millions of dollars to make a squid game youtube video" *angry emote*, this, this is why jimmy makes his ridiculous videos
Mr Beast is a absolute chad
the fact he really didn't even put this on his main channel really shows he just wants to help
Boo
imagine what could elon musk do with his money if he was generous
So, people showing up in big new trucks to get a free turkey....  Most people in need here in Norway can't afford anything other then an old beat up piece of shit car.... Just imagine all the gas/diesel used in that big line, and with bidens gas prices, jebus!
The vegan teacher well cry 😂😂😂😂
Thank you Mlad!!!
Thank you Milard
Thank you milad and jimmy!
The vegan teacher 🌱: he’s the animal hitler
search John 3 16 and Romans 6 23 pls repent Jesus is coming soon pls repent and accept Jesus as your savior and lord pls he loves you all pls repent
Thank you Milad!!!!!!
I love you mr beast

Bragging about your good deeds cancels it out. Its sad when people praise themselves for doing  good deeds. We understand you helped a massive amount of people. But does everyone need to thank you for it? Be a silent hero.
crying for gettin a free turkey inspite of having a car
I didnt hear one 'thank you' at the beginning lol
Let's see vegans taking shit and trying to cancel MrBeast on Twitter or their Facebook group
I see Twitter has dropped silent since this banger came in...

WHERES THE VEGAN TEACHER LOL
I have a silly question? Don't want to be negative, but people that own cars and dress in warm clothes? They are taking advantage of you.. Instead you should give the food to the True Homeless.. And African American bludgers where 2 to 1.. There where 5 Brand New Kias in the line-up.. Typical yanks.. bludgers..
Thank you Milad !!!
Why is no one saying Thank you to Milad I'm the only one. Thank you Milad

Mashed potatoes and potatoes matter more  Steamed
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Thank you milad

PFTT AND PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING HE WASNT DOING ANYTHING GOOD WITH HIS MONEY- LITTLE DID THEY KNOW HE WAS.  Also how tf are you going to control what someone does with their money.

Thank you Milad!!
This guy is a money shredder
Bro I was literally driving back home from eating out for thanksgiving and was thinking, on the car ride "Would MrBeast post "I fed 1,000,000 families for thanksgiving for mrbeast philanthropy?" This is my second time predicting the future, I also predicted TeamSeas
Your a good guy, Mr. Beast

I feel like at least one of those turkeys went bad
Thank you Mr beast and Milad!
Wait ok so it cost you nothing to do this and yet you are comfortable making thousands of dollars off of this ... and you think this is kindness... true kindness goes unseen, not shown off for the world to see so that people will like you. How about a real challenge for Christmas this year go out and pay out of YOUR pocket to supply blankets and socks for homeless people or if that is to much how about taking your squad to a homeless soup kitchen and feed some people that ACTUALLY HAVE NOTHING
Thank you Milad
I might be stupid but how can people that are 'in need' afford a car
Twitter: yOu sHouLdE be UsinG thAT moNeY fOr thE pOOr...  Mr.Beast philanthropy channel:
You shall not skip ads on this channel 🤘
I can't understand why you claim to give to the needy and yet haven't actually seen you give to someone that was legit homeless
I love this! It’s been the third thanksgiving I’ve missed now living in Costa Rica and miss my family thanksgivings!
Neat, exploiting the poor for your personal gain. Definitely not a disgusting act at all! :P
thank you milad
If I was a big YouTubed with this money this is exactly what I’d be doing..!

Thank you mlad!
thank you milad!
WOW eso es algo muy dulce para las otras personas ☺️😸 desearía vivir en en Estados Unidos que yo vivo en México ☹️😝
Good day for people but bad day for turkeys
thank you millad
Thank you Milad💕🙏
So when we getting the Nolan redemption arc?
That is so nice
You have to be dedicated and motivated to constantly put in ton of effort for making videos like MrBeast and his team do. I wonder how long it took for them to build the set for Squid Game while giving to the less fortunate.
Thanks Milad! For the donation and your time!
Milad is a fantastic person. Thank you!!
Mr. beast legit committed genocide on the turkeys 😳 .
The goat
What a guy !!
Dude I know your doing great, but it says a lot about the US that you have to give away 10 k turkeys
Happy thanksgiving everyone
Thank you milad!
thank you milad

Jennie-O understands the value of public good will.
People need to work and earn their living. You help create socialism. Thanks.

I feel bad for the 10,000 turkeys that sacrificed their lives
just how much money do you spend every month? Lol
:)
Btw what do people in new ass cars need free food
I watch it
Mr Beast is what people with that status should aspire to be. We love you man and the rest of the squad!!!
Thank you milad! Happy Thanksgiving!
thanks milad
Hopefully  the vegan teacher doesn't find this video.
Nice done ✅😊 thank you so much for helping so many people:)
Don't thank Jimmy, thank the thousands of turkeys who died to feed these people.
Thank you Millad!!!
Thank you Milad!
Thanks Malad!
Thank you milad

You should open a very cheap hotel👍
Thank you Milad!!!
The sad thing is Jimmy it's God that does everything good Jim is just a reason does people ate but the almighty is the source
Thank you Meru
Thank you milad
.
Thank you Milad!! Ps. Potatoes already have dirt on them, that's where they grow. Also why you wash them before cooking them.

I swear if a vegan dislikes this video…
Thank u milad
Black SUV: We gonna eat him Nolan: LET ME OUT
God bless you and your team
what the heck this guy is amazing
MrBeast the 🐐
Thank Milad!!!!!!!!!!
Thank u mailad

You had to do this on camera didn't you 🙄
SUBSCRIBE OR ELSE!!! No Turkey for you!
Sponsored by thatveganteacher
Thank you milad
Don't worry I ain't buying no turkey cuz i have no money and 2 wk old leftovers are still edible.
Rip Nolan  Thanksgiving 2021
THANK YOU MILAD
Thank you milad
Thank you Milad!
obviously all minorities abusing the freebies. I have yet to see a minority actually be generous with their money like mr beast is.
Thank you malid
Mr beast should have 100 M subscribers right now.
Yea
And people tried to cancel him for not using his money to help people…
thank you miglard
Vegans: *Dies*
I speak for the turkey population and I wanna say:we are not happy 🦃😠
THANKS MILAD!!!!
Mándame tu WhatsApp mándame tu WhatsApp porfi soy tu fan
When the vegan teacher sees this
Thank you Milad!!!!!
U must try to help in India too we love u here
Thank you Milad!!!
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES THIS MAN HAVE XD
MILAD IS BEST
Teamo❤️
Wow 💜💜
you are insane
Don’t do it to get attention, do it because it’s the right thing.
Thank you millad
why did almost a thousand people dislike this? im just curious on the reasoning
Nolan looks like bill nye
T pain gives away 1000 and it makes the news, jimmy gives 10000 and you'll only see it here. Would really like to see Jimmy partner with someone big to expand his reach
THANK YOU MILAD
How about feeding 10,000 families without video recording it? Without doing it for likes on youtube? Doing good deeds for social attention means nothing
This man is too nice, like he just spent 3.5 million dollars on squid game and this for people in need! Hats off to you Jimmy.
Thank you Milard, your contributions are much appreciated
Thank you Milad!!!!
THANK YOU JIMMY JENNIEO AND MUSTANG(Milad)
A good day for the people, but a massacre for the turkeys
Mrbeast fake bots comment on other videos but not on mrbeast's videoss
And people are here saying “why are u spending 3.5 million dollars when u could help others with that” like omggg he’s doing the very very VERY most any one could ever do lol (exaggerating but he’s amazing)
Milard*
Thanks Mild!❤️

Mr Beast doing Mr Beast things
Ah yes, giving 10,000 dead animals because of a "tradition" that most Americans don't know the history to. People in the comments calling vegans weird when you're the ones eating stale bread directly from the butthole of a dead bird.

Happy thanksgiving
Thank you milad!!!!!!
Thanks mallaran
🔥
The people that are disliking this video aren't humans, just keep up the great work Mr. Beast💪
Dont get me wrong, giving away is great, and giving to people in need is amazing. But men, so many people in nice cars getting free stuff…. I don’t know if its because im from a developing country or what, but if you got enough for a really nice car or suv you are not really in need.
And then weirdos on Twitter kept saying he doesn't " Give " lmao 😆
Imagine hating this guy for holding a Squid Game video yet he does kind things like this. Couldn't be me.
Thank you so much Milad!!! bless you.
thank you milad!!!!!!!!!
Cool
I'm so excited for turkey day
It's feeding people but it also supported the horrible lifes and sad endings of thousands of individual animals

Vegans be like
Yay me watching this is helping people yay
Thanksgiving, being a festival built upon the mass killings of innocent women & children, & millions of the Native American people, that's the same as celebrating the Jewish Holocaust every year. Furthermore, the US land grabs of Native American territory laid the basis for the cotton kingdom, the slave plantations. In short, with such a sinister past on their plate, it’s no wonder US mythmakers prefer to focus on pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce. It’s pretty clear, then, that a lot of people in the United States won’t have much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But at least there’s Black Friday to look forward to: the ode to gross over consumption that directly follows the supposed day of gratitude (and that has been known to result in news headlines like “Wal-Mart worker killed in Black Friday shopping stampede”). To be sure, the Black Friday phenomenon only befits a nation built on predatory capitalism – where material excess is rendered sacred, obscene inequality is the name of the game, and communal bonds are systematically obliterated along with any remaining potential for human symbiosis with the physical environment.  In the end, you don’t need to gorge yourself on turkey and stuffing to see that the United States itself is positively sick.
its about time lol
Look you helped a lot of people in this video but... giving nolan? THATS EVEN BETTER
this is the proof that all superheros dont wear capes

I can smell the vegan teachers anger
Lmao I was there
Thank you Millad!!!!!! From to VietNam
This is so awesome and heartwarming. My son and I used to always do something special for Thanksgiving, we'd have a jar for change and spare dollars throughout the year we'd feed and clip coupons in November and we'd find families in need and buy them groceries for a complete dinner-- turkey, sweet potatoes, green beans, cranberries, stuffing mix, and some extras like a couple of onions and seasoning packet and cans of broth. oh, and of course we'd make pies, can't not have pies for Thanksgiving lol. We could only do it for 2 or 3 families a year but shopping for it and packing it up and delivering it was the highlight of our holiday. Last year we didn't do it because of covid and this year we just moved and I'm injured so we couldn't do it, but this reminded me how great it felt and I miss that tradition. I wanna start doing it again next year. What you've done is just amazing, hats off to you and happy Thanksgiving.
all from factory farms...
should've given vegan turkeys
I bet the crybabies on Twitter would still find a reason to cry about how Jimmy is still not doing enough or something. Smh.
This video soo adorable all the turkeys running around d giving away turkeys aww
vegetarians belike: 🥳😭🥳😭🥳😭🥳😭
*let's change the world*             *together*
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Thank you millad!!!!
Thank you mladd
He has such a big heart!
When you get to the point where you have to wait for new videos everyday because youve seen every video on every channel ;-;
Im guessing that 700 dislikes is vegetarians 😂
Thank you Milad!
Have brand new cars, can't pay for food :)
Beautiful
help others and achieve great entertainment.  I really like this clip.  thank you for sharing
Squid game was awesome
You are the destine Savour Of World
Instead of putting this on a separate channel, I'd like to see this on the main channel. It's more representative of what made MrBeast great in the first place. Separating this from the main channel means fewer people will see it and appreciate the effort. I'd also like to see MrBeast do a Secret Santa for individuals and families in real need. Those are the videos I like best. Squid Games and such are fun, but I prefer these. Happy Thanksgiving!
True angel, caught on camera
Thank to person how donated 25,000$ to feed people in need and people how are Struggling
thank you Milad

Thank you mellad
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Thank you Milad!!

the vegan teacher 👁👄👁
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:16‭-‬17 KJV

When your a Canadian and I takes you a minute to remember American thanksgiving is in November
Legend says Nolan was never seen again..
Thanks Milad!
Were most of the people that showed up just going there to see mr. beast in case he would give out money? I feel like less than half of them actually needed a turkey
Thank you Milad!!!!!
Imagine If someone waited in that entire line just to tell Jimmy that they’re vegan 💀
Thank you Miland!

Even bangalore got a turkey, 3:15
please stop killing the turkeys. they have done nothing wrong and we treat them worse than the worst criminals that have ever existed. you can help others without causing harm to innocent beings. if you truly want to help then go vegan

THANK YOU MILAD
Thank you milaffdddddd im drunk af
Honestly, you are one of the only youtubers that can surpass pewdipie in terms of subscribers and not make anyone sad. You're a legend, and we hope that you continue doing things like these
There aren't even 10,000 people in my county! We have less than 3,000... most remote town in the country!
The Bible prophecies that one day without the mark ( in hand or forehead) you cannot buy or sell.  Does this seem similar to anything going on now? Will you believe in Jesus Christ when you see with your eyes this prophesy come to pass?
Mr Beast Makes The World A Better Place ❤️
Thanks Milad👍...great job...keep on donating....
the vegan teacher wachting:    no,no,NO Simply NOOOOOOO
Quite literally the most amazing people on the planet. Mr. Beast and his crew have helped so many people. You guys are amazing and kind.
I can’t even believe how charitable mrbeast is.
Thank you Milad!!!!
I'm impressed.  Keep up the amazing work!
thank you Milad!!!!!!
pretty funny, that as a meat company this probably is the best bang for your buck advertising possible and none of the big corps. appreciate youtubers. 250k isnt that much for a huge meat supplier and i bet a bunch of kids are telling their parents, they better buy Jeanie o
Thank you Miland!!!!!

I think we can all say Milad is a certified cool kid.
You are awesome great human

Him: you can only buy this brand.   Me who's about to eat a kfc deep fried turkey: welp time to eat two turkeys.
milad is cool
I mean, it’s nice of him to give all that turkeys, but personally I don’t think people who are really needed and who is poor can get there by car since they can’t afford one, so it isn’t well made
Milan the legend

It would be really cool if mr.beast partnered with like a 3d house printing company and printed house and shelters for homeless people. They've started doing this in severely poor and poverty stricken areas of California.
I thought for a second this was sponsored by Jennie-O
Thank you Milad!!!
Don't think of this through a vegans eyes 😓
Mr beast in the shower: how about I give 10,000 turkeys to people in need

Thanks Milad!  - The people of Illinois
Greetings from Turkey. not turkey 🦃 :)) Blessing in your purse mrbeast and his friends
If you're reading this, keep safe, healthy and stay strong. This 2021 can be endured with kindness, positivity, and resilience. During these turbulent times there is still hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news, God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free. Give your cares to him, for he cares for you. If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a waymaker If you need freedom or saving  He's a prison shaking savior  If you're got chains  He's a chain breaker.  Don't let your heart be troubled. I wish everyone the best day
Thank you milad
This is one of the best videos on YouTube! ❤️

The baby is so cute
Killing On Demand Many prisoners of conscience have been detained in China, including Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs, who are treated as if they are organ farms, Lin explained. By collecting blood type, organ and tissue information from detainees, the CCP has built a large database for organ transplant centers. When there is a need for a particular organ, officials could search the database, locate a specific detainee, and kill the person for the organ to make a profit.  Such a supply chain is made possible by the Chinese police, procuratorate, court, and justice system, as well as the healthcare network. According to a judgment by the independent China Tribunal in London, Falun Gong practitioners are the main source of organ harvesting. Evidence shows that CCP officials could go to a practitioner’s home–citing any excuse or no excuse–to arrest that individual and extract his or her organs during detention.  A Crime Against Numerous Groups The suppression of Falun Gong started in July 1999. Since then, practitioners have been subjected to arrest, torture, forced labor, intense brainwashing, as well as organ harvesting. Unfortunately, the CCP has further extended its persecution of Falun Gong practitioners to other religious groups, while some international organizations have remained silent and even acted as accomplices, added Lin.  The United Nations, in particular, has not taken concrete actions to stop the tragedy. Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), for example, submitted millions of petition signatures to the United Nations Human Rights Council several years ago, urging the body to address the CCP’s forced organ harvesting, but no response was ever received from the UN. The World Health Organization (WHO) even worked with the CCP to form a special task force on organ harvesting, with Huang Jiefu, former Vice Minister of Health in China, serving on the task force.  Destro said the CCP initially supported Falun Gong for its physical and spiritual benefits. It also promoted the practice through Chinese embassies. But as Falun Gong became more popular and attracted many practitioners, the regime began to suppress it.  More specifically, once the CCP discovered that the number of practitioners exceeded that of CCP members, it exhausted the country’s police forces to suppress Falun Gong, claiming the lives of many practitioners. Even today, the regime views Falun Gong as an existential threat. To help inform Chinese people of what’s going on, Falun Gong practitioners have developed tools to help people overcome the CCP’s internet blockade and access uncensored information.  According to Minghui.org, at least 674 Falun Gong practitioners were sentenced for their faith in the first six months of 2021. In July and August alone, 24 practitioners died as a result of the persecution.

🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 Warning‼️ Judgement is coming! The sins of the people have been very great , the land is full of bloodshed and full of perversity. The Lord will recompense their deeds on their own heads. Let at the people tremble for the day of the Lord is coming, a day of darkness and gloominess.   Anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see— repent of your lack of faith and spiritual understanding!  Come out from under Babylonia so that you will not be partakes of her sins. Separate yourselves because judgement is coming!!  REPENT‼️ For the kingdom of God is at hand.   Those who are sealed with the Lords name will be spared. He does not wish for anyone to perish. Repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. The Lord has no pleasure in death. For why will you die? Turn yourselves and live!!!   Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬  “Blow the trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly; Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing room. Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, Weep between the porch and the altar; Let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord, And do not give Your heritage to reproach, That the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’ ” Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, And pity His people.” ‭‭Joel‬ ‭2:15-18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

Thank you millad!!!!!
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! please take it serious what he spoken of is coming to pass right before our eyes.. it’s not a joke,so  y’all need to know the saving salvation of ur soul..that is in Jesus Christ who bore our sins He’s the way the truth and the life He brutality died on the cross to pay the penalty for all of our sins so that if you acknowledge you’re a sinner that’s sinned against His law and you turn to Him by confessing with your mouth that Jesus Lord and believe that he was raised from the dead and call upon his name and repent of ur sins you would be forgiven and saved spared from damnation and Heaven bound God bless you❤️
Thank you

Oh dear vegan teacher gone be pissed at this😂😂😂😂
What's with the short video? Make it longer and put in more ads so you can donate more
Out of curiosity, I assume not all these families need a free turkey and would have purchased their own. Does the local food market cry now that they aren’t selling their stocked turkey to these families? Is the company helping MrBeast the local store?
Thank you milad
It feels weird because we really had Thanksgiving in Canada so it’s a little weird for me
Tomorrow is a big day 🎟
I want to give and to help and to volunteer with you and I will cook the Turkey, what do you think!?
I bet i could eat that in one sitting. Change my Mind.

Sill can't believe my favorite YouTuber is the nicest guy ever. Most people would be like woo I have a large channel so I can save more for retirement and retire early or they'd spend their extra cash on extravagant things but Mr beast is like I'm gonna invest in making my impact larger. Even his squid game video is going to help charity because it will draw more people here. This man never ceases to amaze me. Only YouTuber to deserve to surpass PewDiePie when he chooses to retire
Anyone ganna talk about how many turkeys got killed
Thank you millad
Thank you Millard
Thank you malid
Jimmy: did they tell you to say that Chris: yeah and they gave me 3 bucks  🤣🤣🤣

Please tell do u like AMOGUS :D?????
All this fool did was feed his ego... all that food is fake like the money he gave...
Lets go miladin!!!
I look up to you but videos like this make me question the subscription to your channels. You have the money to do whatever you’d like to help people and in that “help” that you provide in this video and similar ones, you are actually causing misfortune and pain on the animals and on humans. Keep being you but these types of videos are disgusting.
Thank you milad
Thanks milad
What time jimmy

Mr beast I want to participate in the SQUID game, I'm from 🇪🇨 ECUADOR

Waiting for my Thanksgiving turkey.
Thank you Milad.
Veganteacher isnt happy
When you think about it, the title is a lie here, since some family took more than one, there's no way he fed 10 000 families. Maybe he fed like 9 368 families or something, but not 10 000... :-P (which is nonetheless highly commendable hahaha 😂)
Alpha Phi Omega reppin??? 👀
I'm from Turkey and when every time u say "turkey" this video getting weird

Milad the subway guy thanks
Thank you  milad
THANK YOU MiLad!!!
Great cause, but to give free turkey to some of those cars like they couldn't afford a turkey in their new GMC Yukon; I wouldn't call smart philanthropy.  Part of the problem you see in food drives though.  One I was at, a guy came up in his new Mercedes for free food. Zero Vetting
As long as mr beast and his team are doing stuff like this, I will still have a little hope for this world 🤩👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thank you Milad!!!
I'd love to see That Vegan -Teacher- Karen come at Jimmy for this. And if she does Jimmy has some of the most powerful stans ever so she will get harrased to no end. Thank you for all the good you've done to this world, Jimmy.
Thanks ma lad!!!!
Thank you Milad
"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day." John 6:40 Jesus Christ is God manifest in the Flesh, he created all things and Died for your sins on the cross, he rose again on the 3rd day so that all who believe in him as Lord and savior shall be saved and receive Eternal Life. My Friends, Jesus Christ is Returning soon, please Repent and Believe in Jesus so that you may be saved and Receive Eternal Life. God Bless you all

mrbeast is releasing his squid game TOMMORROW keep your eyes ready for the vid and you are all legends, and if mrbeast reacts to this in his squid game, hello mrbeast, hello Chris, hello Chandler, and finally hello kArL. hope everyone has an fantastic day and lets get mrbeast to 100M subs by 2023, that is all I ask. and goodbye! <3 <3 <3

Thank you Milad

Yay! I’ve been missing videoes on this channel. These are my favorite videoes
Pog Milad!
Thank you Milad
people in need got big cars lol
Thanks mario for helping mrbeast and so many other people
!!!Thank you milladd!!! And dear Mr beast for making this beautiful content of video you are such a good man that give away a 10000 $ to a stranger
Yessir
Yessir
Thank you to all the turkeys who lost their lives.      Where’s my turkey
Pog
Hey Budd I Was So Devastated Of YOu Not LAunching New Videos I Can't Wait To See It Tommorow!!!
Thank you milad
Thank you milad
It’s easy to see just a load of packaged food “products” being given away here - but that was actually 10,000 lives that have been taken from innocent beings that didn’t want to die. Most people are just disconnected from it all. Don’t get me wrong I think Mr.Beast is amazing, but there’s really no need for a mass murder of birds just because a tradition says it should be that way. Enjoy a meat alternative or plant based turkey this year. Save the animals, your health and the environment while doing so!
thank you m'lad
Thank you Milad
Bro I want I phone please 🥺🥺

Thank you Milad!!!!!!
Thanks milad
He’s literally so rich he can make the squid game video AND help the people in need, I’m sure if he wanted to give that money to people he would because he’s already proven he would and has but decided he wanted to make a sick, entertaining video for us to watch for FREE, it’s quite literally his job to make these big entertaining videos so he’s able to do the things people want him to do. Does nobody think anymore?
The vegan teacher is going to be soooooo mad about this 😂😂😂😁

Mr. Beast, you are one of the best people in the world and thank you. You do great things and I love it. I hope you can start to get more of these videos up because they bring a smile to my face every time
everyone thinking that he is working on squid game video no my mans giving away free turkeys Mr beast is so kind
I just don’t get it people driving nice cars and cannot afford food this can only happen in usa
When you just realized...they are giving away 10,00p dead bodies for thanksgiving
why Milad didn't donate subway sandwitches?
Thank you Milad!!!!
We should show the hardcore vegans this video
As an eastern European it’s kinda hard to comprehend how “people in need” arrived by (good looking) cars on the charity site. Isn’t the gasoline to take the trip cost almost as much as the turkey? ((Don’t take this offensive, it’s just weird for me))
#savetheturkeys
nice
Thank you miladl ❤️
Thanks Milad. You did a good service.

Mr beast give something veg
Subscribe so Mr beast can keep doing stuff like this!
I love how, today, he gives away so many turkeys to people in need for Thanksgiving and then he pins his comment, which says, “ Squid Game tomorrow is tomorrow on main channel!” The fact that he went from helping people so much on one channel to recreating a Death Game and snatching millions of dollars in another channel is truly wondrous and amazing.  But anyway, I really appreciate your work and help for the better of the world. I won't be surprised if your name and your crew's name appears in history books sometime in the future. Also, thank you Millad! Keep up your brilliant work, Mr. Beast, we will always stand by and support you!
Please help me sir

Jimmy is probably the kindest person in the world. He seems genuinely happy to take selfies with people as well as giving away all this food to people in need. He needs the Presidential Medal of Freedom!
MrBeast and chlander is my fev

Look at all the those chickens (I mean turkeys)
People underestimate how big of an operation something like this is. I did a thanksgiving drive like this and it took a week to prepare and we only helped 3,000 which is less than a third of what Jimmy accomplished that day. I love seeing things like this.
Turkey time
mr.beast for global president
Thanks milard
Way too late to tell us to buy from Jennie-O, most people probably bought their turkey already
Imagine if he was giving away free turkeys in adopt me Mr beast, u need to start giving away free items/pets in adopt me lol

Thank you very much Sir Beast❤ It's really amazing to see your team always helping the needy and desperate.  I know how hard it is to live in this competitive world.

i always make sure to watch the video and then replay and read the comments for serotonin 🤠 gives the video 2 views everytime
Vegan teacher watching this...😳😳.   I love what you guys do. Keep at it☺️

how about you skip the turkey this year and save 10,000 lives. ever thought about that? and most people throw away half the turkey anyways because it's so big.
My dad used to get hives from driving two jennie-o semi trailers through Minneapolis/St. Paul. Because of this, I don't get jennie-o anymore.
Milad
Thanks Milad
I was part of a food drive at a small local church last Sunday.  We stood out in the cold Michigan drizzle and gave out about 300 Thanksgiving dinners!  I was helping with the turkey section.  I will second that frozen turkeys really are VERY heavy, especially when we had 4 per crate!  And it's hard to rip open the cardboard when your fingers are numb from the cold!  Glad that others are doing the same around the country.  I love it when people come together to help each other.  It's so heartwarming!
Who else cannot wait for "squid game in real life" video i am really excited
Thank you MIlad

Every new year i always eat turkeys beacause i like them so much
Awesome! This is so kind! Love what you do, MrBeast :)
Good job guys!
Thanks milad your a king
Fun fact: Turkeys are called turkeys because the English though all exotic goods coming into the British Isles were from the extremely rich and powerful Ottoman Empire and also a bird extremely similar to turkey, the fowl, was being imported into the British Isles from the Ottoman Empire, which first came from India. Even though foods like maize and potatoes did come from the new world, it was still thought that these foods came from Turkey! Of course in the Ottoman Empire or modern Turkey, the bird turkey is called Hindi, and in Russian it's called the "indian bird", it's the same with Portugeuse.
e
Just a couple of great individuals doing great things!

Teacher: Why are you late to class? Jimmy/MrBeast: oh sorry, I was giving away 10,000 turkeys  Good job Jimmy, I love that you are helping out the people In need keep up the good work!
Okay nice thing your giving away turkeys but give them to people who actually need it you should give them to homeless or poor people what I'm saying is if they can afford a car they can probably afford a turkey right
The outro though.

You always do such amazing things Mr Beast. May you continue to do amazing things forever ♥️
You guys are the best
I'm just imagining the legends that will be told about Mr. Beast. In 70 years I'll be showing my grandkids Minecraft and telling them how Mr. Beast wasn't like Jake Paul Jr. he used his fame for good and revitalized his entire town, then county and State. He became legend, a hero.   It must feel great to be the famous hero of the your hometown, taking a risk and coming from nothing different then you and showing everyone your true potential and kindness.
Thank You Milad. You are very kind.
wow
Nolan😔😔
Thank you Milad!!! Your a legend!

Thank you MILAD!!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
thank you mírgó
Vegans bouta go crazy😂

this video was sponsored by peta
As cool as the giveaways on the other cannels are, and how much many of them really help people, I am so glad Jimmy started Beast Philanthropy. I've helped with food drives before and there is nothing more nourishing to the soul to know people are getting help they need. This is leaving the world better than you found it; one of many examples of Jimmy and the team doing so. I wish the world had more Mr. Beasts.
Op
tank you milad
God bless Mrbeast
I don’t care about anything what happened to Nolan.
Nice work Milad!  Thanks!

I find it kinda disappointing that I didn't see one old crappy car or anyone who looked poor. I'm not saying nobody in the video needed help but too many people take advantage that don't need help and just want a free turkey

Anyone who dislikes this video hates helping people. Wait yt removed the dislike count.

Thanks Milad! You are one of the good ones ^_^   Really happy to see you be happy for donating so much money! :3
The dise likes are from the vegetarians 🤣🤣😂

If only people on Twitter were as nice as Mr Beast
And people in Twitter say that he doesn't give enough money to the people in need because he "wasted" it on a Squid Game replica. Thank you Milad!!
You really change a lot of people’s lives. Your work is remarkable and is a blessing to a lot of people. Thanks Jimmy for all that you do!

Only minutes later already got tens of thousands, incredible.... absolutely incredible this big boi is a hero
I feel like a lot of people don't realize that Jimmy does absolutely great things every day. People cancelling him for remaking Squid Game when that's literally what everyone wanted. Jimmy isn't just a charity, he's a creator, he entertains. If he doesn't make good content, how can he make more money for more bigger stuff?
Also thank you malady
Guess how my views mr beast squid game video will get tomorrow for the first 24 hours ------------>  My guess is 30m views
Of course we gotta thank everyone who participated, but also thank the turkeys that sacrificed themselves. R.I.P 🦃🍗
Thank you milad
RIP Nolan thanksgiving 2021

This is such an awesome idea! So many go hungry on thanksgiving who shouldn’t have to. I actually met someone on Reddit who was on the verge of committing suicide because she couldn’t  afford food. I gave her a gift card to Walmart to get some food and thank goodness she will be spending thanksgiving with a friend.
Cant wait for the squid games tomorrow!
My birthday is in two more days
