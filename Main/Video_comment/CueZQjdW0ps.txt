This is sad. No one can lie about how wavy frenzo is but we know end of the day your still a muslim brother - this tune was out of line. Think about the longer term vision its not worth it wallah. Your following is always there you don't have to go this low to make a good tune
What's the indian song in the back please
Sirra
Frenzo has no filter so all you puddis can suck out
Feel sorry for the aki walahi
Wah harami wah

Astagfirullah man this guy give Islam a bad name and not give a good example to the youth man I pray Allah guides u to the right path frenzo can’t believe the stuff u say in ur songs man we supposed to be setting a good example to the ummah, u obviously don’t care what ur creator Allah thinks of u, wow. It’s not too late delete ur dirty filthy songs and keep on repenting. U want all these songs still here even when u die?!
Does anyone know background tune?
