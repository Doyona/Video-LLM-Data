Omg the London UK 🇬🇧 PPl gon fuck Dillion up with hot coffee throwing shit at him one thing I can say is they are a unit over there you fuck with who they love they coming for u period LETS GO KSI!!!!
Jj so cringe
ksi so cringe dude needs to join logan in the WWE nightmare is hungry lookin ass
Fuck that was cringe
He’s so cringey I’m sorry . I like him but he’s so cringe whenever he’s boxing . He calls himself the nightmare and shit . I do like ksi but he should be less cringey
Lol this is like some WWE soap opera acting
On the street he kills ksi in about 4 seconds!!
JJ needs to lay off the anime
Danis isn’t even gonna make it to the ring he doesn’t want to fight anybody!!!
Day one fight fan and I believe KSI gonna be tf outta him
What in the wwe
JJ’s insane
They all need to move on to another sport go to WWE o somthing like that get away from boxing your all given it a bad name
I’m from the USA but I respect the UK fan base especially KSI’s fans because they will roast the fuck out of ksi and bully him on the Reddit but when someone fucks with ksi they will be there for him and back him up either in social media or in person. In short terms, they’re loyal as fuck and always have KSI’s back.
‘Unleashed the beast’  ….. man it’s a big strong getting Brock Lesnar on Danis I reckon.
Love ksi but I feel he's gonna lose , it will go to points
Who knew boxing would be so cringe someday.
Cringe as fuck.. still.. hope he does spark Dillon out tho the guy needs humbling
Just what we need two idiots who should never be headlining a boxing card, f ed up world we live in
Someone needs to humble these two.
Hey KSI, how did the coffee taste ? 🤧
So cringy, why's he threatening Dillon as if he's in an 80's porno.
Undefeated streak? Danis is 0-0 in boxing right? I guess still technically undefeated  😂
cringe trash talk - just shut up and slump him
Riiiiiiiiiiight.
Danis will fuck you up
He's bad ffs
Danis is guna punch Ksi’s head in 😂🤣
Are they hitting each other with Louis Vuitton handbags?
This is a shit fight
Who the fuck is this wash out dhillon Danis?
1. Jumped by khabib 2. Chocked out by security guard 3. Slapped by Ali abdelaziz (khabibs manager) 4. Punked by Nate Diaz 5.Punched by Anthony Taylor  So that’s 5 L’s right there and by January he would have gotten knocked out by Ksi
I love you man but don't ever refer to yourself as the nightmare in a wwe like promo again....
KSI, what a soy boy
is this wwe
what is this crap hes so cringe
Bruh this guy is somehow more detestable than Danis and I don't get it at all
One of the biggest c***s on the planet
Ima post it on yt⚰️⚰️ #fuckdelon
Ima knock him out when I see him
We all know Dillon will pull out with some BS like he’s got covid so nobody can tell if it’s real he’s not fighting anyone let alone KSI
I don't know what it is but KSI trying to be threatening/intimidating is just funny. I can't take him seriously in the slightest. It's like a goldfish trying to be scary. Hilarious.
Yeah ksi fighting a wrestler who couldent even make it to the ufc go fight your bellator fighters bro and danis can not punch ffs😂
Undefeated streak😂😂 hes never boxed bro wum hahahahahahahahahah
why he gotta make it cringe tho   his trash talk reminds of of me when i was playing mw3 8 years ago
Oh god this is cringe. Joke to boxing
Another bum for the Watford bum slayer to slayer. When is he gonna step up in competition.
1:43 🥴🤢🥴🤣.
Dillon Danis is that turd that just wont flush down
This is such a pointless fight we all know who wins, we know KSI cannot properly box. Yeah, he wins this because dannis is even worse striking wise but KSI is literally getting protected for the Jake fight. Get it done so he can get the bag, or fight an actual test to prove you deserve jake. IE: Slim, Salt Papi, Gib. Even someone who has a possibility of boxing decently, like a woodley who by the way, was voted as who your opponent should be but obviously that’s not gonna get made cos it’s too much of a risk. This is bullsh*t.
KSI is the knew king of cringe, honestly i just can't take it. If he threatened me i would honestly just laugh in his face.
Kind of sick of this YouTube stick. Like picking lads you don't necessarily have good boxing. In a genuine fight Danis would tie him and play with him until he felt like ending it.
Haven't seen this anger since Joe Weller, it's all calm until someone physically messes with him
and we cannot wait until you fight a real boxer
Video title moving nuts as usual
At least big Taylor for putting on dannis
This helmet went to a private school but is behaving like he grew up on the streets on London 😂😂😂 complete fraud man
I swear these YouTubeers have the worst trash talk
Ksi thinks he's intimidating. Hilarious
Some of these jake paul meat riders 😹
WSI
I love moncler… but the monclers I’ve seen ksi wear are so horrifically bad he literally buys the worse ones
Danis would do oral for a cheeseburger, imagine the dive he's willing to take to make ksi look half decent as a boxer
KSI is actually performing stand up comedy at this point. Dude talks in 3rd person, and is a corny hypocrite. The audacity to criticize Jakes opponents and then expect past on the back for fighting meme rappers, malnourished trackstars, and now Dildo Danis is a WILD fall from grace for "nightmare" lolol! "Fight Gib first Jake, wahh! I need A side, wahh! But covid, wahh! I need warm ups, wahh! Tate too big, wahh! Woodley needs another win, wahh! Then stage a meet up with Dillon to disguise the fact he's a dried piece of dog shit of an opponent. C'mon bruh, the real ones that don't ride see through this. You were the guy I wanted to root for but are just corny now. Jake's talks, but he's walking it out tho. Pretending to be a super villain don't win fights. 😂
I thought JJ couldn’t fight Tommy Fury because fight was going to be in the states. Now it’s in London 💀💀
cringe
Ksi this is for you  Jake Paul would SMOKE you  And further more I'd SMOKE the both of you
JJ will batter him
Actually disappointed JJ taking such a shit opponent again
I literally canot wait to see KSI flattened in the ring. And see the look on his face when he takes a real punch. lol The guys ego is so over exaggerated. Little boy hides behind his body guard at every opp. Him trying to sound tough is cringe too.
That was the worse trash talking I've ever heard
Ksi in trouble with this one.
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Can't wait to see KSI smash up Dillon.
bro thinks he’s an anime character 💀 big up ksi
Ksi v The Windmill 04/23 Let's go Chump  The challenge continues.....
Ksi will win
Let's go Dilon!! This man needs knocking out!
Cringe.
I read it as “ksi fucks dillon danis”
KSI should have 2 opponents again, Danis will be worse than Swarmz
🤡 fight mma rules tough guy. dont talk trash if u not going to fight to the death no rules whimp
Haha, so cheesy and non-eloquent. I’m shaking in my boots JJ. This is like a crappy WWE promo
"Every opponent I have has realised that"  I'm sorry but the last 2 guys ksi fought looked like they had pulled up 2 random KFC employees who never fought in their lives 😂
Why does he give horny vibes? Hes so bad at being intimidating 😭😅
Scared for Dillon Danis KSI Is Acc Gonna Fuck Him Up
cringe
His trash talk is corny as fuck
Let's go ksi
i love ksi but this supervillian act "the nightmare" shit is kinda cringe to me
Dilon is a pro... Ksi isnt.... Dilon will spark him
Jake paul is still more braindead
Ya gonna make Dani’s lose his undefeated streak 😂😂😂 he lost his last fight 🤦‍♂️
KSI trying to sound hard is so cringe
This dude tries so hard to sound scary 😭
Cringe
Danis has not had a fight in years. The reason why he hanging so close to influencers is because he wants a pay day
These are some of the worst fights I’ve ever seen and I use to work at a day care
Ksi is a geek bro I know yall love him but he can't box I wish I had the clout just to put him back to earth he's nothing at boxing at real boxing he's a nerd
I don’t like Ksi but he didn’t deserve that coffee on his face
Very cringe
Lol why is KSI trying to intimidate Dillon? He's fought youtubers and rappers 😂 Dillon is an actual fighter. He probably sucks, but he won't be scared
KSI ego is through the roof
Taylor already ended Danis' career tbh. Ksi cringe af fight a decent domestic pro boxer then talk about hungry nightmares
All these clowns think they’re in  the WWE🤦🏻‍♂️
Hi ik i can not want to are you ko dillion danis and jakee Paul
BRB, gotta walk off this cringe.
Ksi u havent fought no one and keep fighting nobody's don't mention Jake again do your shit but don't belittle Jake again u have no room to talk
Pretty much the whole mma commune wants ksi to merk this rasclat Dillon batty bwoy
Hi
JJs threats are so weak 😂 hope he knocks out Danis tho
😂😂😂
Wwe 2k cutscene
So he didn’t acknowledge his Twitter poll and made a dead fight. Well done JJ
He seems serious this time
Dodging tate lol
No No No No brothers you all are judging KSI wrongly man I mean he does what he tell and what he want to do see he is literally the BLACK GOD he is undefeated boxer and he is pretty sucsessful singer a well-known youtuber and he done all this by only starting   a gaming channel man this guy has come so far and you all gone see this fatneek is gone annihilate his opponent and he is gone shock the world up. 🔥🔥
Wanna be fighters wanna give it big in the octagon...
Fight a boxer your boxing want to fight a martial artist go fight in the octagon bore me these YouTubers pretending to be boxers fighting people who aren't boxers
"lose that ..... undefeated streaks of yours" Man, that was anticlimactic
I can’t lie ksi is the most least intimidating person
cringe, Dillion will smoke this kid.
This craps so fake 😂 Make your money of the kids fella
Ofc ksi gonna win is rigged u can tell allready with the coffee shit
This shows people have less of a boxing standard for JJ compared to Jake. Jake got clowned for all of his opponents meanwhile JJ is fighting Danis xD.
Ksi really goes for the easiest opponents, such a clown
It hurts seeing Dillon agreeing on the boxing terms and mad respect because Jesus man as A mma fan it’s gonna hurt seeing another mma fighter being limited to punches, not grappling or kicking.
Balding KSI 😂
The battle of 2 clowns. Ksi will think he’s a god after beating a guy with ZERO striking abilities ZERO the same as his last 2 opponents. Instead of fighting a half decent guy he choose 2 absolute bums. His little fans will eat it up tho. Both r dummies
w
Dillon danis threw coffee at KSI then just fucked off he ran 😂
ayo?
Lol if Dillon has any boxing he will win. KSI is a windmill
This is so fake, Danis' career was in the gutter. Obviously completely fabricated beef to sell ppv.
Dillon gives me oldschool bumfights vibes. It’s not gonna end well for him in life I think.
You're going to give him a good bag and you hate him. It doesn't make sense
Cringiest guy I’ve ever witnessed in all my time on earth.
I'm Gonna make u loser undefeated streak of urs~KSI 😂😂
Sounds like he doesn't even believe what he's saying 🤣
joe seller mindset oh god
I am not a big fan of that matchup… change my mind
What’s funny is, when y’all watch the video, Dillion and his friend got their asses kicked by almost one guy. Anthony came out looking for smoke and Almost slep  everyone 😂
I m still rooting for dillon danis and I don’t know why
Wasn’t interested in this fight   UNTIL  He attacked Fred now its personal
If ksi wasn’t a super famous YouTuber he would be nowhere near the sport of boxing just there because of his name
Not a Danis fan..... I am shocked his trolling is paying off for him..... He is a real professional athlete however.... YouTube KSI guy....you are gonna get smashed..... Turn down the fake ass nightmare talk.... You look ridiculous..... No dives fellas Fight for honor not money
this is so cringe
I thought the last misfit x dazn even would be in the USA but oh boy if jj is thinking about having it london. Dillions gonna get killed before the fight😂
HE'S UNLEASHED THE BEAST
Fake hype.
1:00 So it was staged, except the coffee part.
i like KSI but the entire villan intimidation thing he does is kinda corny ngl
i just hope anthony taylor doesn#t ko dillion before the fight
So embarrassing.. 😂
cringeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Everytime he refers to himself as “THE NIGHTMARE” 💀
Dillon is a terrible striker, literally worse then Ben Askren… Way to go KSI!!
Bruh it's in London? Thought he couldn't fight Tommy because it was gonna be in the US, Danis gotta be the easiest fight from all of the options
so cringy
Cringe
Big fan off JJ but I really don’t think he can box.
Lets go  ksi fuck him up
That speech was cringe af not gonna lie
This is the worst trash talk I’ve seen in my life  😂😂
Danis will choke the life out of that boo boo
Danis throwing the coffee on jj was so disrespectful, after jj gave him the chance to face off and talk his shii, he blind sided jj with that… nah, Danis sux and he is going to get it
Lol so it really was staged
He's in your head now🤷🏻‍♂️ anger doesn't win boxing matches
Why is a jiu Jitsu guy boxing lmao
This man is done for. KSI is the only guy who can actually prove people wrong and surprisingly annihilate anyone with just hard work and the right mindset. Don't know who this Dillon guy is until now but I'm pretty sure he doesn't stand a chance however tough and experience he is
big deji paying another trash can
Dildo Danish isn’t ready
Bro why everyone fight mma fight wtf , bro dillion last fight is 2019 wtf ??😂
He most likely will win obviously yes and I really don’t want to see him lose but what do you guys think would happen if he lost? Let’s say Danis knocks him out clean in the first round? What would happen? What would his next couple years look like?
Your area you are from watford lol
His "intimidation" is like a poorly scripted wwe speech
i want khabib to be in the audience fo the dillon danis fight
Good wwe interview there
1:07 did anyone caught the moment? he looked defeated when he said that.
Ksi acting as if he didnt plan itbout for dillon to be there 😂
That Bandana stretches the whole length of his forehead
proper cringe this
Has nothing to do with boxing its personal now
KSI making a fool of himself.  Got punked bad.
Dillon might actually pullout you know
Thats the words what I'd like to hear more than that piece of shitty Dillon prick.
Anyone getting WWE vibes on this... 😂
Umm, so I’ve just come back from a YouTube mini break. Who is Dillon Danis???
Dillion Danis is no striker😂he’s going to get battered then Ksi will think he’s better then Mayweather from beating a guy worse then any of jakes opponents, he called out jake for fighting ex ufc fighters but that’s the route he’s taking, yes he fought a “pro” in Pineda but jake paul does the same to Pineda as ksi did but all you ksi fan boys will be loving it
Ksi needs humbled
Why what u gonna do jump in air and do nothing like u did 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 tough words for a pusssssssyyyyyyygg
I’m predicting ksi will beat danis if he doesn’t pull out. If he does pull out, ksi will fight Tyron woodley. Jake Paul will try to fight tommy fury. They each might get one more fight in after that before they fight eachother at the end of next year
JJ's getting upstaged by his little brother Deji these days 🤣
KSI hands down the least intimidating person ever
We need 2 fights in one night.
To be fair, he is doing the same as Jake with Ben Askren, this is his 5 boxing match (not counting Swarmz x Pineda as 2)
Bro that first minute came like one WWE promo😂😂😂😂like shih JJ if you’re truely angry speak it, No need to sound like a supervillain
I thought Woodley topped the fan poll for next opponent, why is he fighting Dillon fucking Danis now??
this is different. jj is legitimately pissed and for good reason. instead of his usual cockiness hes actually looking to hurt him and seems way more intense
Y’all can say all you want about whether danis is an easy opponent or whatever but don’t fkn comapare ksi with Jake, Jake literally fought Ben askren who has zero boxing ability and Nate Robinson who hasn’t sparred anyone during his camp.
Finally get my hands on you, iv been waiting....it's been like 3 days since these two even had any fake beef
Man this is such a L fight. Like Dillon is a trash boxer. The only positive we get to see that little annoying mf get his ass beaten. Have no mercy for that little rat.
oooh scary.... im scared, im sure the guy is terrified!! omg
funny thing dannis only took the fight cause when they came face to face he was bigger. Thinks the size advantage will help him
Boxing a grappler? Smart this is like when Jake boxed ASkre. Just complelty avoid DAnis skills and not let him use them at all. Cuz KSI knows what would happen if Danis was allowed to use his jiu jitsu
🤣🤣
Upgrade over Nate Robinson.
Ksi are you not embarrassed? You should be. Haha unleashed the beast Haha my 6 year old would do you you maggot
Tbh feel like jj should do to fight 1 night again ksi vs dillon danis and Alex wassabi bc then after that he ready for jake
Ngl that's an embarrassing choice of an opponent. A BJJ guy? Even that Pineda clown was a better choice
Cringy as fuck ksi loses
First Khabib kicked his a$$, now time for KSI to do it too.  We Russians despise Dillion Danis, KSI plz ko the sh1t out of him 💪🏻
But he’s a wrestler and he hasn’t fought in ages. He still needs to fight a boxer in order to be level with jake Paul.
Sometimes what JJ says sounds so corny 🤣
Did he just call himself the nightmare?
You can tell ksi was hurt
He'll pullout
jesus ksi sucks at talking
will dannis nut? i guess well soon find out
Bros so cringe
Literally doing a jake paul fighting a grappler who CANNOT strike. Granted Dillon is not likeable but lets not give KSI credibility here until HE fights a real boxer (and same for JP).
cringe
Trust me when i say this fight ain't happening danis will pull out hahahaha trust me hes scared
KSI sounding like shrek “this is my swamp”
Ksi is cringe
lets gooo jj you got this
So cringe this lad
Ksi talking smack is so cringe and hilarious… he’s not intimidating at all 😂
Hope JJ batters him but this is cringe af
he's talking like he's some great boxer smh
Welll ……….that was cringey as fuck ……Dillon Danis is the ultimate div but KSI needs to chill with the tough guy WWE talk
And KSI claims that he’s not want to play with when he’s literally for Logan Paul, Swarmz, Pineda and Dillon Danis, when Jake Paul’s fought literally Tyron, Woodley Anderson, Silva and those of our opponents, so I don’t understand why everyone’s out or KSI is this KSI is that when he has cocky
Scared of jake tho 😂
WWE promo vibes.
He’s still gonna be cocky, and he thinks he’s sick when he’s fighting wrestler, and he’s like really shit one Jake Paul’s fought Anderson, Silva and Tyron, Woodley and all those fighters so
WTF HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Give that poor forehead some sunlight
Ksi is ficking pissed
Calm down JJ or that man is going to pull out of the event!
Theese dorks pretending they are fighters are embarrassing.
People clowing JJ opponent are forgetting that jake fought a old man with a hip replacement,  dillion is a lot different then ben askrin or even woodley tbf
Ooh, You're Hard!
Will John Kavanagh or even Conor McGregor be in Danis’ corner for that fight I wonder
YouTube boxing: where no fights against actual boxers exist
This guy is so cringe
LSI
LSI
LSI
Fight jake then 🤣🤣🤣
You should go professional boxing you n those twins and see what your really made of. Dillion is a wrestler not a stand up fighter. You know how to pick them aye. Why don't you do boxing match with him and win like you know you will and then a wrestling match and he'll win like he would. If your boxing choose a real boxer not wrestler.
He seems different
Real beef this time…?
i so ksi'd my pants when he said "im going nightmare mode"
lets go JJ
Dillon got what he wanted so…..
I bet ksi is gonna win with boxing much, but how about a mma fight 🤔 I think ksi would lose en that's real fight the real thing
People saying KSI L , bro dillon threw a coffe , tried to punch jj, ofc   Jj needs to fight dillon
This the nigga that called andrew out and put woodley on a poll then ducked them?
Let’s hold off and wait till the fight happens to make judgement on this fight
It can’t just be me who finds this dude highly cringe? He’s a posh kid acting hard! Wise up
KSI is dumb
Cringe
Wasn't Misfits 4 supposed to be in America?
What if when KSI annihilates Dillion Conor McGregor challenges him?
His trash talk is cringe as fuck
KSI is such a cringey bastard "you think you can just come through, dash coffee in my face?..." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mi  a KSI fan but he can never complain about the quality of Jakes opponents atleast woodley  had knockouts in his career and knew how to box he was also multiple time world champ   dillon has never thrown a punch he has only pulled guard or taken someone down  i wouldn't be disappointed but he criticized jake first then he himself did the same thing jake did
" the nightmare is hungry" hahahahahahahahahahaha
Needs to do acting classes
Stop trying shit talk it's embarrassing. Every opponent??? That last event was a joke please tell me this kid ain't believing his bullshit now I always thought he was okay
Honestly the only reason I would watch this fight is to see Danis get humbled. Apart from that, Danis, in terms of boxing, isn't good. Woodley is a much harder test than Danis so KSI needs to destroy Dillon then fight either Woodley or Fournier.
pretty keen to see ksi lose tbh idk
I bet any money Dillon Danis pulls out of the fight. He is a troll and he will pull out of the fight just to be a troll.
This was supposed to be Logan’s fight, but oh well. Yeah he took a L on this one, only way he gets respect back is if he knock outs Dillon. Then the competition gotta step up. Not saying he has to fight Woodly, but someone from the same caliber as Woodly.
Whole card was big cringe
Ksi is bare cringe sometimes
Don't know why people hating on this. This is a good fight for KSI. He fought two bums last time and needs to fight more before Jake. Jake fought askren in his second pro fight, who had slim to nothing striking capabilities. Danis is a good step up but beating Danis isn't a defining win for him. If ksi were to beat Nate Diaz, Tommy Fury, Andrew Tate, or any well known or good striker, then that will put him on the right level. This is a good fight for him, I expect him to have 2-3 fights next year.
We all know Dillon is gonna pull out. This gonna be pussabi 2.0 all over again
Please don’t fight Dillon Danis, don’t give him the attention and money!
Sounds like WWE interview
ITS A BATTLE OF THE CLOWNS
Goddamm why are people in the comments always complaining so much. Most of you are only satisfied when he fights jake paul or something.  Dillon danis has a long fighting history and is a fighter. (And needs to be humbled honestly) This is a very good and competitive matchup. And if you don’t like it, I dare you to step into the ring with that guy.
Cringe
heck yeah ksi improved his game
Ksi thinks he's intimidating🤣
if i was ksi i would cut dillons paycheck in half
Not a KSI fan in the slightest. This is the same guy who together with Logan Paul celebrated the cancellation of Andrew Tate but when he fights Dillon Danis I hope he knocks him tf out. Dildo Danis is a pariah. KSI has to sock him out.
Let's be honest Dillon's made a big mistake I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't make it to the ring knowing the uk fans and how much they will back jj but I feel like they may beat him to it when it comes to destroying danis
Ksi picking easy fight
All staged nonsense.. gotta be a mug buy into this lark.. KSI can't fight his way out of a wet paper bag
dude got bitch slapped 😂
This JJ is different bro, Dillion got no chance with a mindset like this, JJ honestly looks like he gone kill the guy, so yeah, best of luck to u JJ, go and f him up
Are his fans gullible enough to believe that it's real beef between him and Danis? Zero boxing experience Danis has been his target before he even started calling out guys that he'll never fight. You KSI fans should feel used. It's pathetic that he has to script beef and lie to his fans just to sell the Danis fight so he won't risk losing his undefeated record. I would wager everything that I own that he's never going to fight Jake, he's just going to keep inflating his ego and calling out guys just so he can duck when they accept the call out.  The guy is such a massive fraud, I wish his fans would open their eyes.
Lmfao I like ksi but damn this was cringe until the last “ fuck Dillion” lol
I like JJ but I can't seem to take him serious, he acts cringe a lot..
I wonder what is going through the interviews head rn
How did he make you look like dhead??
He should have just been honest and said he's not ready for Woodley and Danis is the only guy he can beat. Instead he faked beef to manipulate his fans, hoping they'd want to see him fight Danis. Now everyone knows the call-outs were only for clout.
there's just nothing intimidating about KSI. he needs to stop all that
To be honest tyron can sit his 0-2 ass down and this dildo goof can finally get his ass beat, he literally has beef with everyone, KSI, jake, logan, Anthony taylor even fuckin Khabib
logan wanted to fight dallon but that mfs injured hope to see ksi knocking dillons head off
Porn Hub has better acting
KSI is so cringe when he’s being “serious”
Ksi you trash😂 Dillon danis  you trash😂
HI ALL  KSI DONT GET MAD GET EVEN ?
Ksi is so corny doing these promos
Dillon Dannis: 2-0, has had 6 minutes TOTAL in the octagon professionally his whole career. Has only thrown THREE punches while standing. Last fight was in 2019.  Ben Askren: 19-2, welterweight champion in ONE Championship. Has over 3.5 hours in the octagon professionally. Most of his fights went the distance, knows how to “box” much better than Dillon. Has been fighting professionally since 2009. Last 2 fights were also in 2019.  Ben Askren is 100x better on paper. & KSI sounds cringe asf in the first 30 seconds 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
U man all say that danis is bad so what he was actin all up let jj destroy him and tyron woodley if u wanted to fight shouldve done the same shit dillon did and u wouldve fight to
This guy is cringy AF
wait the fight is in London? I thought it was in Houston
“The nightmare is unleashed” lmaooooooooo I am shivering 🤣 sell the fight lmao
Ppl say its staged and fake!!! It wasn't staged after when dillon knocked ksi hat !!!!!!
Damn , people should understand that London venue is actually SCARY. It's literally ksi's backyard.
waiting till he fights someone who can actually half-box since logan paul...
Cringe af
This is embarrassing
At this point, I’ll even pull for Jake Paul to KO Dillon.
It’ll be interesting to see if Conor walks out with Dillon.
Honestly, I don’t see Dillon making it past one round.
I hope he doesn't pull a pusabbi
After Dillon gets KOd he should fight Ryan Taylor.
He has no chance!!!
bro thinks he's a dbz character
he's honestly got so cringy all because everyone else has overtaken him in boxing skill
Youtube boxing is so cringe.
Why would diLLon throw coffee lmao that wasn't part of the staged agreement. Man just made him angrier for this lame fight. JJ isn't getting proper experience for his Jake fight like this smh
Congratulations that fights going to sell huge. And idiot danis will get humbled
Damn JJ literally is so like loose and laughing all the time I’ve watched JJ his whole YouTube career and this is complete serious and it’s in London yeah Dillon is fucked
I love ksi. The start of this was cringe asf. He did get serious after but that whole starting bit was just 😬
Guy talks like an anime character
Cringe level.5000
This is giving the KSI vs Logan rivalry vibes man specially how KSI is taking it. Love it
Danis is basically Jake vs Askren I do not give a fuck.
Nah nah nah It’s definitely not safe for Dillon in the uk Dillon really doesn’t like or value his life fam 😂😂
The fight will be in USA or UK ?
Dillon Danis will fuck Ksi up in a street fight 😂😂😂
Dillon danis should be more afraid of the uk fans
Lmao wtf is this cringe
Fucking love JJ man
dillon aint a boxer though lol
JJ is going to abuse him this January  The fact he didn't even try to assault him at the second face off just means in the ring he's gonna go insane
L fight tbh could’ve fought someone else with good boxing abilities to up his level
Nah Dillons boutta get fucked
if KSI looses, all his talk will be a meme
Bro really ducked Tyron Woodley
KSI in his fighter character does not come across as scary as he thinks it does
I dislike Danis but I have been following him and even on one leg he looked quite decent in sparring so for people to look past him is going to be a mistake I see this fight being competitive and JJ will have to work hard for the win but it is going to be worth it
Kudos to jj's  security without them we couldn't get to see jj knockin Danis out in style  in the ring cuz believe me without jj's bodyguards jj would chase him and make him pay with his life..
This is the new WWE, they know who is going to win and have paid these fighters off, just to get more views. KSI can't fight he's useless and on TRT
Jj has no tough talk bro. Sounds like a private school kid tryna threaten a roadman
I get that he can box, but he sounds so cringe when he's trying to sound scary
i hope JJ knocks that punk out cold
The only 2 things that aren't fake about this is wade getting caffeined and Anthony almost knocking dillon out
He’s Such An Anime Character It’s Ridiculous
Very Disappointed in KSI, Dillian Danis grappling record is 18 and Loss 15, 2-0 Bellator Record (Not Even UFC) Winning all by SUBMISSION! He had a 7 HOUR Reconstruction Surgery In his Knee only 2 Years ago, He hasn't fought in June of 2019... He's a Subpar Grappler with No world Title in Bellator and He's an As bar Striker as Ben Askren, He literally Almost got knocked out with ONE punch from anthony taylor. This is why I officially Don't think KSI will Ever be at Jakes level, Jake wanted to fight Danis like 2 Years BEFORE Ben askren, He wanted a warm-up, You fought 2 bums 2 months ago now your fighting another Bum. Tyron hasn't won a fight since 2018 BUT he was at least a world champion man Fuck, You aren't going up in talent While Jake is fighting Anderson silvas You fighting people with No striking experience coming off a Career ending injury. Time is not on KSI side with Jake being only 25, with 3 years of boxing KSI took so much time off, Your gonna be 30... You won't be able to catch up to jake in time. You called out Tate, Tommy Fury, Tyron, Slim and now you are fighting someone who would get knocked out by each of them. Jake, Gib, Slim, Temper, King Kenny, JMX, and Bruckner all had better resumes than you.
Dude I don’t know how he can talk like this because in the streets he’d choke the shit out of u
KSi is so cringe
Why I'm getting a feeling that Dillion is going to pull out of the fight
That was staged the other night with him and thar clown 🤡
Bros 5 head got exposed tho 💀💀
Black megamind isn’t joking around!
Tbh would’ve preferred Fournier more.Though it would be far more challenging  that Dillon it would earn him far more credibility.
Bro Dillon srsly? that's an ez win for JJ tbh.. good on him
Box a boxer why don’t ya
i really hope Dillion wins lmfao
Danis has an undefeated streak of 2 against bums and hasn't fought in almost four years
It's gonna be Alex wassabi situation all over again hopefully fournier and Woodley are on standby
“slim, tommy fury, andrew tate, I wanna piece of that” ducks all 3.
wasabi beats danis, this is embarrassing.
So let me get this straight, KSI refused Woodley because he hasn’t won a fight since 2018, yet is fighting Dillon Danis who last fought in 2017. Kinda starting to see why jake calls him a coward
Its personal this time for KSI !
This is the first time I really fully hope he fucks up his opponent I dislike Dillon Danis so much From all I've seen he just seems like a dick
Ksi work more on your head movement and defense for this fight, if he wants to win against dillion he'll need to make like water and work that jab a ko isn't the way, work your jab counter a lot and don't let Dillion rush in he's a striker it could end in a ko against ksi if he fight Dillion in the pocket.
I really hope he sleeps that ugly skunk
if tommy fury couldnt fight because the january card was in America, and the january card is at Wembley, then uh ...
After Dillon who does he fight next Ik ppl say Tyron but Tyron is retired and isn’t ppl saying jake only fights retired ppl so why fight Tyron
if danis pulls out we need KSiv salt papi or slim and I I'm also gonna say any jake paul or ksi opponent is shit so just accept it
Let’s go JJ 👊🔥
LOL Sadly KSI is gonna get whooped. i feel bad!
if KSI was actually pissed off with that troll, he wouldn't talk about him
Why does it sound like he's being interviewed by Tommy Fury
KSI is cringe AF😪🤦🏻‍♂️
Please stop jj this shit is so fake and staged it's like watching wwe
This is getting beyond cringe
Wins 2 boxing matches against youtubers now all of a sudden he thinks he's hard
KSI 100% needs a back up fighter and not Just Dillion Danis bro. For Real so  only then does he beat Jake Paul.
Just LEAVE???? Your goons took him out. Believe me bro, he's not afraid of YOU!!🤣🤣🤣 He's spared with Conor, and dude just STOP 😂, your getting beat and Jake fight is OUT
shoutout ksi he corny tho
Whenever you can see someone's whites under their eyes when they look at you. Man's possessed  by demons
bro ur not getting urself prepared for Jake by fighting guys who have 0 striking ability. you're just setting yourself up for failure honestly.
I’m glad KSI is wearing his bandanna because his forehead HUGE as a mf
Im sorry but British people can’t be taken seriously with that accent
People didnt mind logan fighting dannis but cause jj is everyone hates, jale faught a nba player and multiple old bums and rigged most some clowns are gonna still hate on ksi for no reason
im usually the guy that is on his knees for ksi but danis? thats an L ngl should have been a real boxer not tyron too  tyron would have gotten slept this gonna be fire anyways so i wont be complaining
thought it was in houston??
This is the same guy who thinks he can beat mayweather btw
walid robbed, misfits is ass ngl ufc better
L fight
Dillon dannis is a clown, he’s a freak and he attacked the beloved Fred talks fighting!! Jj you have to beat him
Cringe...
Like i said, KSI in trouble this won't obviously be an easy fight for him
I'm just waiting for the sus version of this
this nigga ksi cut a wwe promo lmaoo
as much as i think dillion is a shit head for doing something like that, ksi needs to be set straight, bro thinks way too much of himself, hes barley had a boxing career , always talking like hes been doing this his entire life and "can beat anyone" including Mayweather, bro barley won against logan and thinks hes untouchable now. in all honesty hes a very mid level boxer, and i hate to say it... jake would destroy him in the ring, tyron woodly is like  a bigger then ksi and jake shit on him, in no universe does ksi come out on top, bro needs more fights to win before he can start making his ego for boxing so damn big, "unleashed the beast" bro relax you beat a child up in the ring and a unexperienced out of shape average joe  tubby dude in 1 night. thats not something necessarily impressive, even for someone who barley has a boxing career. always saying jake dosnt fight real boxers as if you have yourself. at least his were people who stood a chance, alex wassabi??? bro come onnn lmaoo   if dillion danis wins he's gonna brew up the most far fetched excuse on why he lost to him, I like ksi but dude... you're AVERAGE not the next floyed, you're 4-0 with 1 draw that we all know was basically a lose. 2 are from people who never boxed before in their life,  and one is a literal child who looks malnourished, and the logan win really was soooo one sided that if logan didnt lose a point for doing what he did he wouldve won that and you know it ... please stop with this "you have no idea what you're getting into" sit down bro less talk
He is fighting a Jujitsu guy who has never boxed in his life is not even known for striking in MMA let alone being able to box. Even if I'm knocks him out stiff it's an L.  Why avoid Woodley who Jake beat twice and JJ chooses his easiest possible so called fight
I love ksi but gotta say that if he wanted to fight Jake Paul this is not the opponent to fight
Big L fight
lmao Dillion is so shit! honestly talk about an easy pick, for the casuals danis is good as a submission artist but his stand up striking is woeful to say the least! this man is inactive, terrible at striking so cant even use the one good thing he does have and recently got choked out by a freaking citizen in the street lol i cant explain to you just how easy this fight is for KSI or anyone at that! He will get knocked out inside 1 minute mark my words. Does nothing to show us where KSI is or how much he has improved etc.
100% Dillon Danis fakes a injury to get out of this, Dillon ran away from Jake Paul, There's no chance he'll fight KSI he's a coward
KSI taking more L's everyday smh, honestly lost my respect for the don
The nightmare is hungry and you’re getting it bro🤓
Y'all should stop with the askren and nate argument jj fought swarmz and pineda he proves nothing beating this bum
CRINGE
I want nothing more then to see dillon get knocked out by someone, but really this fight does nothing for JJ and the cringy staged fight at the weigh in to promote. just expected more, JJ needs a real test before jake not some washed up BJJ guy that cant box and hasnt fought in 4 years
THIS should have been jj's return fight but FUCK IT this gon be fire
ksi is the biggest fraud i've seen. He has no visible boxing talent and his 10 year old fans are eating his wwe shtick up
i don't think jj is scared of woodley, but man jj fighting dillon is so dead man, hopefully jj fights woodley next (or someone thats more of a threat)
Bro said “the nightmare… is hungry💀”
He can’t even string a sentence together
super lame should have fought woodley just looks scared
LSI he’s a nerd who thinks he’s hard
I´ve been a fan of JJ for years and it hurts to see him taking such a massive L, he should be stepping up the competition, not leveling it down, sad to say that if he doesn´t fight someone on the Tyron Woodley level in January, Jake is gonna hurt him bad, Joe Fournier would be the perfect opponent for JJ.
cringe overload
I been a ksi fan but godamn it pisses me off watchin these mfs defend everything that he does
Dillon pissed off too many people this weekend. Attacked KSI, dumped coffee on Wade, and then threw Fred's phone to the ground. Someone get this man KOed
Dillion wins
Dildo Danis is a slight upgrade from a Ben Askren. The upgrade after Dildo Danis better be high if wants to have a good legit fighter fight. My issues with JJ is my issue with Izzy. They'd hype their fights up for something they're not. Danis not a dangerous boxer. Has terrible striking (better than askren tho lol).  Disappointed with it being Danis but ig atleast I get to see Danis KOed (Hopefully cuz JJ better)
This guy is a joke, put down Jake’s opponents claiming Woodley is washed and Silva is just old (even tho KSI said Jake should fight Silva) now he’s fighting Dildo Dannis?   He put a poll on his Twitter asking who he should fight, Woodley won by a landslide and now he’s fighting dildo dannis.   He said his last fight was a warm up and he was going to up the competition in the next one. Another lie.
This fight is just going to fall though let’s be real
Ksi a walking L fr -Asks fans if he should fight tyron then when the fans say he should he just doesn't  -calls tate out, talks shit abt him in his videos and then doesn't fight him cuz he's "too big" for him which doesn't nake sense cuz why is tate not too big for jake  -says he can't fight tommy because the next event is in America but it's in uk  -says he's beat floyd
A bit too easy of a fight for KSI, should be an easy W. Dillon's just a waffler
That face off was illegally cringe. This is an L fight. I don’t think he actually ever wants to fight jake. He just using his name for views at this point. This opponent he’s chosen has shown me that he isn’t serious about fighting Jake.
So cringe
The comments are just all idiots, this fight is going to be good
That whole interaction between KSI and Danis literally gave me Joe Weller flashbacks
This better be an act, otherwise this is an L
It’s clear misfits is trying to be the WWE with these cringey speeches and entrance music stuff…. Time to unsubscribe from DAZN
He’s fighting Dillon then after he’s gonna fight Woodley mark my words . Then after woodley is the big fight with Jake Paul ! Watch
Who gave KSi this script?
"Losing that undefeated streak" what his 2-0 record from 4 years ago? Holy fuck hes a walking L now a days
This feels so staged
at least he held a hot one from anthony
bro dillion is getting knock the f out
No hate but this was so cringe 0:32
Dillon Danis release the nightmare naw you disrespectful my guy Ksi
According to deluded KSI fanboys Jake Paul fighting MMA fighters are easy fights but KSI fighting an MMA fighter is now suddenly a challenging fight? Make it make sense
I cringed watching this
So so embarrassing
All of you who are saying he should fight woodley don’t understand that KSI is doing the same thing jake did. Dillon is the Ben askren to JJ. It’s from fighting athletes to mma guys who is known for not having good hands transition. If you really look into it, Ksi ain’t doing anything different to what jake did, it’s just that jake is ahead of ksi but they are on the same road. Stop hating
Even though the fight's an L  Atleast he ain't fighting old people like Jake Paul, even though Jake got some boxing ability
He seems different. Usually it’s cockiness and laughs, but this time it seems like he’s actually threatening him.
Ben askren beats Dillion
Can't wait to see how KSI fans defend his decision to fight the biggest bum of the combat world, Dildo Danis, the dude has had just 2 professional fights, embarrassing at this point
This is a good fight Dillion been talking that smoke for way to long. One of these YouTubers had to check him. It’s better than that unknown boxer fourtneir. He could fight Tyrone after if he gets pasted Dillion
Bro you lost to Jake Paul.  Dani’s for the win!  No trolling here, just talking truth. KSI hasn’t fought anyone really. Dani’s on the other hand has trained for years with some pretty good coaches and fighters. This boy talk too much. Yeah Dani’s talk too, but he will win. MMW
listen to these jake fans🤦🏾‍♂️lool
This is all an act lol.
What a loser , staged a bullshit confrontation to get out of a fight with T Wood . Dillion Danis isn’t a boxer and KSI is a joke .
How you call yourself “the greatest” but you keep choosing easy fights 🤷🏾‍♂️
wasnt u not fighting tommy fury because the event was in america now its in england and still no tommy itll be great for someone to silence dillion but u better be back to back next year if u want jake
I really respect JJ and what he does outside of boxing but Im having a hard time taking his 'intimidation' seriously anymore. Hopefully he backs up how good he says that he is soon
Dillon won’t fight him though, he will pull out..
Sorry but this is a HUGEEEE L for ksi here
It's gonna be such an L if he doesn't knock him out
I hate danis but ksi is gonna lose. He aint got that drive
Ugh. Now I know for SURE the coffee shit was fake asf. Rare L KSI.
That’s sad
The Dillon fight is a huge L. Dude was so scared of tyron woodley
I'm sorry but what the fuck? This shows that JJ actually ducked Woodley Lmao. Even Fournier would've been so much better than whoever the fuck Dillon is
