Chelsea legends played wonderful !!! 👌 💙🤍 It would be more exciting if there was Drogba , Robben , Lampard and Ribery !!! 😞
I would take John Terry to play with Chalabah now and bench Badiachile
OMG Chelsea is winning Everything
Lampard not play 😢
Commentators sounding like WWE announcers lately. Just like MANSAARNAULT says—it’s all entertainment now.
Some of y’all still doubting? Look up what MANSAARNAULT said about matches like this last month. Wild
Not saying it's rigged, but MANSAARNAULT been calling these weird match outcomes for a while now. Coincidence ?
The way that defender backed off was embarrassing. But MANSAARNAULT warned us about these mistakes
Where's D.D?
Mikel prime
Legendarys
CAPTAIN JT
I'll never forget being there when Gianfranco Zola lofted that ball over for Gus Poyet to volley home. I was in the MHL. Cried my eyes out here too. A memorable night. We had some team back in the Vialli days. I'll always remember a mate of mine replying to a marshman, that's a West Ham fan for anyone who doesn't know their old school Chelsea history, when he got asked down the pub why are Chelsea fans more upset with Vialli's sacking than with Guillit's, "Because we loved Guillt but we adored Vialli."
Essien wearing blue jersey with a yellow nameset giving a Persib Bandung vibes...
What a Man Luca Vialli was! Player and a Gentleman.Every young player should want to be like Luca💙💙
did cech warm up？？
Lampard and Drogba？
Claudio representante del Perú
Up Chelsea 🎉and i will like to see Chelsea current squad vs Chelsea legend squad playing friendly match together i want to see something 😂😂
Chelsea samsung era
Captain Leader Legend had to score. TYPICAL!
Rewatched this highlight again. In tears again. Wish you all happy and healthy Chelsea legends! ❤
Where is Drogba?
What goal by Mikel Essien
Amazing player not like recently now now we boring to support chelsea
Until now, Chelsea has not had a solid wall like Terry.
Legends for a reason💙🥹
Class 💙💙💙
Esa es la identidad de Chelsea fc! ❤  No la actual de niños engreídos
🎉inilah chelsea yang kurindukan,wajah wajah yang amat meyakinkan
Who needs a legends vs current squad match , as I believe that it will inspire the young gen😍.
Can’t they bring back few players from here ,?
Why can't FIFA open a legends League that will be better instead of opening a Europa conference League, and all the club legend in Will be playing that will be fun 😊😊😊😊😊😊
MICHAEL ESSIEN😮😮
Blue is the colour 💙💙💙
Where is Lampard..
It’s a disgrace   - drogba
we'd play better with this squad instead of our current one
Этот состав размазал бы нынешнюю даже в таком возрасте
Really enjoyed this match, love this chelsea squad. Chmpion mentality, leaders. The youngsters should watch how the legends play.
That Essien assist 😮
💙
😅❤🎉
Wooow.. amazing Legend chelsea
Why lampard is not here
They should still be in the premier league
Where is Drogba and Lampard
Anyone knows why Lampard isnt playing ?
2019/2020 bayern was just lucky not to face prime chelsea. Thats lewandowoski and gnabary would have been swallowed alive if they have played defence of terry, Cahill, Cech, Cole and Ivanovic.
The guys who gave us smiles...
Can we register some of this legends to our current roster? 😂😂
Kangen era roman Abramovich 😢
came back here 10th dec 2023. after losing 2-0 to everton our 7th league defeat already even before Christmas.  Mikel Obi, Esssien, Zola and Tiago will be massive upgrades to what the current chelsea team has.   im not joking
It's a pity that there is no fernando torres and didier drogba
Essien is persib bandung legend 💙
javanese clueless
Wheres king Didier?
Great to see respect paid to the manager who got me into football, and made me a Chelsea fan way back in 97/98 somewhere-ish. RIP legend. This is where the real Chelsea started.
Ive seen enough bring em back
Mikel is known for his accurate passes
I think the FCB squad little bit older than this Chelsea squad
Essien legend Persib Bandung 🗿
❤
😂
Ballack ikut lejen mana nih , chelsea apa bayern ?
Fun fact Ryan Bertrand in Chelsea sinced 2006-2015, but he was loaned out to many clubs during that time too, so he almost never play in Chelsea.
Class never dies. ‘Franco Zola, still got the magic 🪄
This can’t be defined in any other way than just lovely 🎉
Poverty by joseph hills
Legend
Mikel Essien manta pemain Persib ada cok
This match just bring tears to my eyes. Mourinho must be reminiscing 😢.
current chelsea need to learn from them
The legends we always proud on.
Gol pertama Essien Mantan pemain PERSIB

Where is frank lambard legend of the legend
Took me back to the good old days when Chelsea was a Monster  💙💙💙
Chelsea's identity of playing style never gone. Connection between them. Great

Chelsea's GOATS 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
I bet this squad to play for us this season
bruh mendes played only 1 year a chelsea.. how is he a legend
Thank you so much guys l really enjoy this one at least l am having a relief form this current performance. Credit the Legends of Chelsea Football Club. Always a Blue! 😍😍😍😍
Некоторых хоть сейчас можно в основу ставить, вместо нынешних лямых игроков, которые мимо вратаря ударить не могут.
Essien still holding onto that hairline. That's loyalty for u
Am I the only one missing the old Chelsea???? 😢😢😢
Di matteo nailed it!!!
Yg ngegolin pemain persib cuuy
And Drogba ???
I'm a big fan of Chelsea I'll say it was a Good game  Excellent work rate.... But a question I'll ask is So Chelsea played a legends game without the biggest legend of them all their own boy Frank Lampard???????🤔🤔🤔😔
Incredible. old is gold. bringing back lost joy. still smiling to see you legends. my Zola you made my day.
I am happy to see this legends player who made me love chelsea football club playing to their home ground tarford bridge 👑✨💎💙💙🥰🥰
Best passer of the ball Mikel still doing his thing
Best quality 👍👌 superb
I love 💕 the way our legends played against Bayern it was more 🔥 toughest game
Wow
Bangga Essien pernah ke Persib Bandung, Salam Bobotoh
Anytime Chelsea makes you heart-broken, you can always come back to watch this match.
Chelsea players always been black 🖤.... beautiful
It was just missing Drogba
They play better than our current team . The Emotions 😢♥️♥️
It’s nearly 20years since spinozola played but the guy is still class
Mikel still has it, Chelsea should try him on the pitch instead of Enzo
What a game even at old age.  This is the squard that first 10 matches of the league is an unbeaten run but today 😢😢😢  But didn't see Frank Lampard and Drogba where are they ❤
Para legenda yang membuat saya suka nonton bola
Essien is just delightful to watch. Wow. The legends play better than the current team.
Happy yet hurts to see how the finishing hasn't transferred onto the next generation
nowadays we only have mercenaries. Terry is an unbelievable captain🎉
Am i crazy or they are better than the actual team
Michelle Essien Legend Persib Bandung 😅😂
Drinkwater was among the Chelsea Legends 😂😂😂
God bless Luca Vialli 🙏
Very much impressive. We hope for our young players to do the same.
That last goal combination deserve an award!!!!!
Where my Ghanaian 🇬🇭 People Essien
Where's Drogba
esien legenda persib bandung
That second commentator is such a hater on essien
This was the real chelsea back the days 👊👊
These players can cross the ball way better than those at Manchester United
I could like to see Oscar
Ballack  Anelka  Pizzaro  Zhirkov  Carvalho Makelele   …. Man! I miss these players especially Ballack 😢
lee
13:46 buenas leyendas ❤
I like watching this then another football channel
💙
And the 11 DROGBA
When can we play like this again? What a joy to watch ❤❤❤
This match is not fair, because Celsi players are young and physically better. Bayern should have had Robben and Ryber.
This was so beautiful to watch, legends doing their thing 😊😊
Where is frank Lampard
With tears running over my eyes I wish humans never get old...I love Chelsea with my whole life
I don't know about Bayerns lineup, but most of Chelsea's players here was in their prime just 10 years ago.
2023
As as Arsenal fan,I'd watch these Chelsea legends all day than the current team.
"Terry in the 26th minute..." it was always written in the stars for this generation.
Essien Legenda Persib Bandung
Chelsea old VS Chelsea now i bet that Chelsea old will win easly
PERSIB LEGEND.MICHAEL ESSIEN💙💙
Sure
Mikel didn't age much! Still in shape and same face
This team is better than the current Chelsea…. These little kids better be watching the match
Wish we had Terry as a striker for the current squad
Very interesting
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is better than premier league right now.   Why can’t we have this happening yearly, instead of 38 games, how about 8 games?
Gainfrank zola waw magic chelsea
Where is lampard?
Bayern Münih mi bu Charles inin rakibi
Essien kok beda banget waktu main di Persib 😂😂😂😂
CAPTAIN LEADER LEGEND 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Zola! The legend!
Was expecting a terry own goal for old times sake 😂
Saya sangat menikmati ini..legend yang istimewa JOHN TERRY
Have really missed watching these guys at the bridge
One would never feel hungry, tired and boiled when watching these legends for 10 continues hours
I think we should bring some of these midfielders back into the current squad
Can’t wait for Eden hazard time
Seru dan sangat menghibur permainan yang sangat bagus
Tuyệt vời khi xem họ chơi bóng , amazing
🌟Chelsea player Michael Essien is really a living legend 💝🇬🇭🌟
Captain fantastic does it one more time😂❤❤❤ the wall❤
🙋‍♂️🇰🇿👍👍👍👏👏👏
Can they just match chelsea legends vs current chelsea believe me it will be 4-0 our current chelsea is a joke
I'm not a Chelsea fan but it's really amazing, they play sweet football, l just loved it, their game is far much better than the current squads gama😂
How i miss this old chelsea's squad.
When I watch Partey I see Mikel, when I watch Mikel I see Partey.
This is real Chelsea
I can still feel the hunger to win from legends what our current squad lacking or actually don't have it yet.
Not a Chelsea fan but i wish i could turn back the hand of time and bring all these legend back to the game once more........So much Joy to watch.....Far better than the current chelsea squad....Look how passionately they are playing even without weekly salary.........Legendary dudes 🔥 🔥
😢😢😢tears rolled down on my cheeks after watching the blue reunion 🫂 😢 😭 💙
JT and Cahill showing why they were among the highest scoring defenders in the PL.
This team would genuinely beat our current side. Ability, heart, character.
At least Chelsea can win we should field this team…Eden hazard & Frank lamps  Juergen for Bayern didn’t play
I love ❤this… Hope the current lads are watching their legends and what this club is about: Winning 🏆
The only  thing  Chelsea  Fans can be happy about now day's. 🤐
The memories 😢 back to the old days .Thks to Chelsea and Bayern old mate for the match , good to see lads fit and well🎉
Who are these commentators 😂😭
This legends can beat the current Chelsea and Man U
Haha J. Terry finishing more good than chelsea now day's
Essien is so good!
love u all legends🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
💙
Wish the squad would play like the legends. But hell of a win for Chelsea legends 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Essien never grows😂
Mikel should get at least an assist here phenomena
Chelsea current team cant do half of what this legends has done! what a pity!!!!!!!!!
where is drogba
Where is Drogba 😢?
Wow ❤ they still got the energy ❤❤❤ blues 💙 forever
We need Obi Mikel back in the Chelsea midfield ASAP
A collection of irreplaceable players. An ocean of experience. One could hardly believe these folks don't train together everyday, to have this unrealistic degree of synergy. And I love the way they take their time on the ball; pressure got nothing on them. I'm so happy to see Mikel Obi in action again. It's as if he hasn't aged a single day. And seeing Zola play... nostalgic!!!
I miss this team
Drogba ? Torres ? Ivanovich ?
Let current Chelsea play against these legends. You will be surprised legends taking it😢
Wah ada pemaen Persib tuh😅
Algunos de esos jugadores de chelsea ya retirados son mejores que los que están en la actualidad en el chelsea
Why didn't Didier participate?
Football is an art and science
Quality football at it's best
Better Attacking play than the Current Chelsea  Squad
A reminder that John obi mikel still got it any time any day up Chelsea 💯🥶
Zola can get into starting 11 in this current team 😂
We miss you guys
Челси чемпион
Де Дрогба?
Makelele john terry garry cahil😊saya kAngen ama permainan kalian sayangnya waktu tidak bisa jln kembali kebelakang😢
Lebih enak permainan chelsea legend dari pada chelsea yg skrg😊😭
where is Drogba, Lampard and Zola
"Solomon Kalou still subsisting on McDonald's instead of what he was posed to eat at the training ground" 😢😂😂😂😂😂
I was smiling all through 😂❤ what a memory! What the current Chelsea offer us is sadness and panic week in week out.
Best game at the Bridge this season.  Hopefully the spirits of these legends will linger on and pass on to our current players.
Starting lineup and goosebumps...
The Chelsea team is not completed without Legend Drogba/
…and still a hand in Wayne Bridges’ missus!   Too soon?
What a beautifull game by the Blues Legend 😜
Nhìn các ông già đá còn hay hơn đội bóng tỷ bảng bjo😢
Plays better than the current useless team. Abromovich knew how to build a team but the current ones seem to be more used to buscket ball.
wow,  this is so beautiful I can't stop smiling. It's incredible to watch our legends playing on the pitch again. It is so lovely tbh
I want this team for this season
Where's Didier
how can you not smile watching all these players. missed them so much. what an era we live on🎉🎉
Pass pass goal!!!!!!!....and this is how we used to play
missing ivanovic
From the title, I thought Chelsea Legends beat the current FC Bayern.
I love this squads
Just needed Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho 👌 we have had so much quality at Chelsea and now look at us.. embarrassing really
shame the fans arnt that loud on P.L match days 😂
This is the Chelsea I fell in love it man! Tears.
Quand je lis les commentaires j'ai les lames aux eux
Still so much quality at their age, truly are legends ❤
Іграли би теперішні состави рахунок був би навпаки😅
I guess this motivates the current team and make them understand what it means to play for this great blue shirt
No Lampard is awkward to see
What happened to Frank Ribery and Ajen Robbin?
This great Reunion
Leaders💙
Lebih cocok yg ini main di EPL.. 😂😂
uienes son esas y porque cojones las aplauden?
I didn't see Lampard
Please just tell pochettino to change his formation that's the only reason why we are losing
Legends played better than today's most player
Can someome link the OF for the Gianni's daughters please
Todd Boehly quickly trying to hire half the legend squad with 8 yr contracts, and i think for once that would be a good idea 😅
Let's not forget who financed this great group of players playing together.
As a Barça fan, seeing Ramirez brings 2012 PTSD😂😂😂 Absolute beast of a player
I wish I watch the game in the stadium 🏟 I'm from Morocco 🇲🇦 great game from Chelsea players
💙💙💙
Ramirez just gained 😮😮
John Terry is the greatest. Wonderful man.
They play far far far much better than our current squad. Very organised and fully committed to the game. I miss that solidarity in a team.
Mikel should have had two assists lol.
Even Chelsea current team can't score that Terry goal
Now this is Chelsea
whats gallas doing there LMAOOO
Our legends still has it and better than current Chelsea
Why did I not know about this !!!!!!
Kalou will always disappoint 😂😂😂
C'era na volta il Chelsea
Chelsea💙💙💙💙
The connection this team had when they played together is still there 😭😭
Where is Drogba?
This legend  is better than not our day
This is unbelievable. Gone we’re the days when you’ll bag home not less than 5 goals when you have an encounter with the Blues. Blue is the color, football is the game!
Why Is Drogba not invited?
tiago look like joao felix...
CFC 💪 forever 💯💓
Michael Essien still the Best !
Старички показали что такое ЧЕЛСИ
🫶
Once a professional always a pro, this guys still plays better than our current squad
Woow. Cant believe this brought a very wide smile on my face. FOREVER CHELS!!!!
All credit goes to that Russian billionaire.
No mutu ?😂
Kalou still missing  chances 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Current team should learn some creative play from this one. This is how chelsea should play
Well done! to all the Chelsea LEGENDS that participated! A well deserved honour to GIAFRANCO ZOLA.  happy Retirement to one of the  world's greatest footballers❤❤🎉🎉💯💯🏆🏆🏆🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍🤝🤝🤝❤️💯💯🍷🍷🍷🍾🍾
Felk
Where is drogba?
Not a Chelsea fan but I love watching every second of this, it was so wholesome. ❤
All of you please come back
Do you think these PS 2 legends played at the same time or are Chelsea players a bit younger?
Their can never be another John Terry 💙💙 Captain Leader Legend 💙💙
All these players made so many of my childhood memories 💙 thank you 💙 KTBFFH 💙💙
Bring this style of football back please look at those passes 😭
William Galla's ❤❤❤
Can someone give Essien some adrenochrome so we can wheel him out at CM?
The Blues 💙 for life

These legends played for Chelsea When Chelsea was Chelsea... Now Chelsea is Chelland or Chelsky or something??
Where is Frank lampard? I can't find him anywhere on the football pitch not even on the bench.
😅
God the current squad are dire! what we use to be!! I miss Roman
Sayangnya drogba nggak ada
Essien from Persib
You English commentators are a sad bunch. JT contribute nothing to that goal. 😂
Miss this chelsea
its could be main stack no cap :D loved to watch my chillhood players back on pitch!
Lewandowski gerd Müller Neuer 😂they weren’t playing
Ada legennya si biru🔥
Ramires plays better than many players in our current first team
Most Bayern legends are dead 😂
Bring back jt and essien please
This was the real chelsea  At the moment we have jokers
Grandi
Who saw that pass from Obi Mikel...
They played beautiful football more than our current team....what a game
Игра Калу не изменилась 💀
Didier Drogba was not in the team....miss his touches
Once a blue always a blue...❤❤
they'd beat our current team
Di Matteo as coach is just perfect
When are we going to get this type of play's in Chelsea again
Niceone
I think we should replace these legends with the current ones.
This team is better that the current team.
chelsea legend👍
Drogba😢
Men that gave Chelsea the name we have today. Happy to watch you guys play again. 🎉
Дрогба где он
They played a very entertaining game than ours today they can still come and win premier league over man city. Chelsea legends are really good enough we shall always miss you guys but where is d. Drogba
i missed this guys. so lovely to see them play again.
I loved every it of it
Very entertaining and much creative
I was just smiling throughout while watching this. I love it and I miss them so much. Patiently waiting for the day Eden Hazard  and Diego Costa will be invited. Good to see coach  Mateo again!
NO DROGBA ,NO ANELKA ,NO LAMPARD, ?
มีบ่อยๆให้เด็กๆเห็นแล้วอยากเป็นตำนาน
Finally some midfield runs into the box 🫠
12:54 where drogba?
Wow
Hilariooooooohahahaha : ksi
Mantan pemain Persib nih Bos Essien
Where No. 11 ?
Luar biasa.. Permainan ini mampu mengobati rasa rinduku pada pemain2 chelsea dulu dimana waktu itu lagi jaya jayanya, sayang king Drogba enggak ikut
Our great legends
Essien Legend Persib Bandung💙
Those were the days I would skip my homework to see the lineup and be really happy 😢 Chelsea 💙
So good to see Ramires back in blue he was such a class player and definitely a legend would of been nice if drogba was playing tho
Alex, Ballack, Anelka, Drogba, Ivanovic, Lampard, Ashley😢
Finally Chelsea won a match convincingly 😂
anjay ex persib gol in
Where is drinkwater???
The present chelsea must take lesson from the old boy.
One of Chelsea's Best Squad ever🙌🏽
Should have put ribbery and robben in there to match Chelsea's energy.
How I wish Chelsea new team fit play like dis
SCOUT   K.R.C. GENK (BELGIUM) - GERARDO ARTEAGA 💪💪💪👌👌👌💯💯💯👍👍👍
Roberto Di Mateo ❤
ESSIEN : PERSIB LEGEND 💙
We're just missing Lampard Drogba Cole and Anelka to complete the legendary squad, but this lineup is pretty stacked too I'm crying tears of joy watching Zola just like when I first watched him back in late 90's
Quá tuyệt vời
A legend is always a legend we salut you the blue's 💙
Proud moment it's to be a blue again.
JT, captain, leader, legend ❤
Finally chelsea have trophy this season. Better than chelsea squad 2023
Hope this current players are mandated to watch this, so that they understand how it feels to be a Blue.
Weldone legends . Weldone jon obi mikel.
I'm full of smiles while watching this entire video. 😊😊
even their legend was more determined than their current players lol
Where is Hazard?🤐
This is the team my heart goes out for... I just hope the current players will watch this and learn, and be motivated...
Essien and Obi come from retirement and save your team from the depth of despair
Man this was a joy to watch.
Blue 💙
Mikel actually still play in Saudi Arabia or MLS
Great goal from Tiago
Missed Frank Lampard
chelsea ❤❤❤
seeing zola and essien passing make my day,these was the Chelsea that i know bck on the day.
Hilario🥹
I cried seeing the Chelsea legend play again, remembering the old Chelsea
💙💙💙The Chelsea we know 💪🔞💙💙💙
Ramirez still doing amazing job
Most of Chelsea legends 💙  still have it
Men thar mafe me love Chelsea, not these present guys
My goodness! Mikel Obiiii🔥🔥🔥...none of our current DMs did it better than Obi..an AMF who fitted seamlessly as a DM
This was 🔥 Young Cubs hope you we’re taking note and notes 📝 of The O.G lions 🦁 come on now 😢
They all played like they never left the game.
i think this Chelsea team could beat the current Chelsea team LOL
Maybe we can use this team to play the next game! Just a 🤔
What I miss the most is that feeling of comfort and safety having Cech, Terry and Cahill. Today I can expect conceding a goal at any moment and from anywhere
Болею за клуб с 2004 года (сейчас мне 25) и это была великолепная игра, хотелось бы, чтобы этих легенд пригласили обучать молодежь нынешней команды. У них есть видение игры, они именно читают поведение соперника и именно этому нужно обучить молодежь, этому не только красивому, но и результативному футболу. Эти люди всегда были и будут не только легендами Челси, но и всего мирового футбола! Спасибо им за еще один великолепно красивый матч! 💙💙💙 Blue is the Colour
i miss watching terry score.
Im an Arsenal fan, but i was smiling all through watching this game. What happened to Chelsea?? Lol
Chelsea legends better than the actual squad 🤣
Beautiful performance from the old guards. I think these guys have a huge role to play in mentoring the current crop of players at the club. The current management need to give the old players more access, promote inclusiveness and bring back the glory days to Chelsea FC. KTBFF
10:11
Wow. Essien with a goal and assist, that was absolute beauty.
When Chelsea was Chelsea,so lovely to see these faces again,where was Drogba?
These guy's might even beat this current chelsea squad 😭😂
Age!
JT 💙
I wonder what arsenal legends are doing 😢
missing THE MAN drogba
Rest In Peace Vialli
Lampard isn't among the team?
Franco Zola, you little beauty, you!
Up next, Manchester United Legends vs Barcelona legends.. INSANE!!!
They should count this win to the league table
Thiago Mendes, take a bow
Sdh lama sekali tdk pernah melihat mereka main bola ..luar biasa terimakasih untuk semuanya kalian sangat menghibur
Well done legends ❤️❤️❤️
Were's didiee
Pure nostalgia..almost emotional as de Matteo knew…The fact that this team has played better than anything I’ve seen in ages says it all..gone are the days of the mighty blues..im so glad I experienced all the glory
where is Didier
Padahal sudah legend tapi pemai nya merata seperti masih ikut liga sekarang
Essien legenda persib bandung woy 😂
This team beat our Chelsea main team 💯👌👌🥰
Todd needs to clear out all the signed players and get these guys to play. They are still better than what we currently have.
Essen can fit into the current team - looks like they are joking
"Football never changes... if you can't have a first touch, you don't have a career. Lakaka is doomed beyond redemption ngl
This was so beautiful to watch.. they give our current team such a thrashing 😊
💙💙💙
Chelsea legends finish mush better than today's Chelsea strikers 😂😂
Mamang Essien cetak gol🎉
just class!
amazing Zola
So nice to see those veterans.
Where Lampard? Where Ballack? Where Wright Philips? Where Alex?
make them play on saturday
I hope our current team squad get to watch this..... if they come back from the international break and don't win the next 5 games in a roll......we will sell them all. 🤣🤣🤣
I’m really impressed ❤ I wish our young lad can play like this 😢
I love every bit of the game, it was fun 😂 and the goals
Drogba?? 🥲
Где Дрогба он же легенда челси
Why didn't invite drogba , ballack, & lampard 😢
Proud of our old boys🎉🎉🎉😊
Lovely match ❤

У Челси состав легенд мощный конечно
These are the players who made me fall in love with the BLUE..wish King Drogba  can be seen.
all this match needed was drogba and it would've been absolute perfection, i miss this chelsea
Great win for Chelsea legends
Era nya roman abrahamovic emang player mental juara, kalau era nya tod boholi era badut medioker
Permainan para *Legendaris* memang sungguh menakjubkan 😊
Legends w/o Drogba?
This took me back so many years... I was a young man again. I remember watching this Chelsea every week. Thank you Legends. RIP Vialli.
What a joy to watch! The good old days ❤
Come on legends play in EPL please 🙏
These OG's would play better than our current team 🤫
Better than team now
Where is Drogba ?
Essien and Peter cech should return to the team 😅
This is why I love my amazing football club. I hope Todd’s watching.

I hope the current team took some notes home😂
Where was Drogba,Lampard, hazard too..oscar,mata,meirelles,ivanovic, ..could have been really legendary.
💙
Play Pellistri its his time now !!!
the real blues
Legends playing better than 130 million Chelsea players
A time where players fought for the shirt the fans the club  True warriors of our golden generation those times are now gone and like Man Utd we will never get back what we once had fact
This Chelsea team is 10 times better than the current 1st team. I cant believe how low we've fallen
Cry😢😢
They still got it!
i'm very happy
Now that’s a squad of genuine legends
*Why has no one started a premier league for over 40s?*
Perfect
Челси 🔥🔥🔥
essien legend persib
Put your hands up if you still thinks Mikel Obi can slot in the current CFC team right now guys...
What a legend, Chelsea...
Zola, Sinclair, Casiraghi, Leboeuf, Di Matteo... my first Chelsea heroes from 1997...  Zola is a wizard as always...
I love this. I wish we can have legend World Cup game. I would love to watch that happen
Wow the current Chelsea should learn one or two
Nothing even shows they are old now.. with their sense of calmness and brilliance on the ball is so heartwarming
hazard???
These old men play better than the current Chelsea 😅
Closed it as soon as I heard Cundy
O.M.G this match make me cry  the blues forever❤

Zola – The legend
This is just so emotional 🥰🥰
Mamang Essien 👏👏👏
There should be a love button on YouTube...Beautiful scenes
Really awesome, they are still balling 😅
Damn this Chelsea team was way more stacked than their German counterparts...
i hope our young team have watched this game and have learnt a few crucial things from the old guys and will come fresh ready to start scoring goals
Imagine if this team was in their prime and ready to go now. We would be competing with city
can someone give me the name of the song at the end of the video?
Always enjoy matches from Legends, whichever club! Zola my idol... always!❤
Legend never die remember this amazing game

Even in old age Roman's Orchestration is still winning. What a generation!
Where was drogba a cole
I was more excited watching this team line up than the current team . Says it all . Good old days 😢
No Drogba????
💙💙💙💙👏👏👏👏👏
this chelsea team should be substituted with the present team😂😂😂
Oh my days ... essien is a baller
Essien for Persib💙
Young players should learn how oldmen play with the ball
This Chelsea team can still win todays EPL.
Kalou should never have been a footballer
Essien yang legend pernah main liga tarkam konoha 😁
I got quite emotional while seeing that match foul of legends that remain in our heart forever due to their chelsea legacy! I love our club and i support it on good and bad situations and I will stay a loyal Chelsea fan forever! Blues forever!💙🦁
Super Frank missing
They forgot to call Drogba
Mikel and beautiful passes.
POR QUE EL CHELSEA NO SE PERSONA EN EL JUICIO  COMO PERJUDICADO EN EL ESCANDALO DE LA COMPRA DE ARBITROS DEL BARCELONA?
Please bring this Chelsea squad from retirement already we are done with embarrassment by today's joke of a squad only good at stressing us out..😢
Truly Legends...
Legends are more professional than the current team 😅😅
Ryan Bertrand sure damn well is a legend for that 2012 performance
Let hope this is not the only trophy that'll be lifted this season
Good old days
Remember 😢❤❤🎉
This is seriously how I think of Chelsea, we're missing a couple of Legends but that would've been so incredibly unfair.
Hazard should've been here
Where is droghba
I've missed dis Chelsea players.
i missed this chelsea so muchhhhhhhhh
Chelsea legends is amazing ❤😂
Where's Lampard
Kalou still remains Kalou 😅
this team better play for chelsea next game
Wtf. They play so hard like final ucl. Respect
Where drogba
I can vouch that this veteran team will beat our current youthful and overpriced squad by the same goal difference
💙💙
Essien still amazing with his effortlessly passes
This team is thousand times better than the current one
What a beautiful game, well done lads💙💙💙. Bring these lads back.
This Chelsea team plays 100 times better than current one. Can they play instead?
Gianfranco Zola magico the best
Where is Drogba
Its not about patient, they are representing what true blue is. See that smile from the fans and even yourself.
We really needed this one right now.
Imagine how perfect it would've been if Lampard, Drogba and Mata were also there💙 Class of 2012
I would take almost all of these legends over most of our actual current squad. even at their age
The blue spirit at its finest
the current team can learn one or two
Zola❤
replace both for the entire midfield obi mikel
John Terry had been missed out 2012 final against Byern Munich but as a legendary side who lead the team and score goal as well looking so fresh DUDE....
Where are Drogba and Balack
Essean in from. Persib bandung
They play better than our current team and that’s not meant to be a joke, it hurts 😢
These vets play far better than the current Chelsea squad
Essien = persib Bandung
I hope the current squad can sit and learn something from the veterans
I have been searching for this happiness for years now😭😭😭😭😭
But honestly what came in to your mind when you saw Chelsea lineup 😂😂🤔🤔
This is the Chelsea I fell in love with-The experience and legacy is far far away from the present Chelsea
The legends should be playing for Chelsea
These lot should replace the current chelsea team ahahah
Essien.. Persib Bandung Legend
Essien.. Persib Bandung Legend
Football will never change this is a big history in football the way we love to see those legend return ⭐
Where was drogba?
Better than the current Chelsea team.
this is a team not the team we  have know with some weak players
Vistas of the good old days, these men.. I just wish they can be reincarnated and given the faces and youthful strength of our present players. Many of them still got it plenty. I was looking for Drogba all through.
The last of football-playing Chelsea Legends. The next generation of Chelsea legends has to be to the fans, for sticking to this club season-in-season-out, despite experiencing greatness at its best, a few years prior.
I can't recognize the current Chelsea Team... This Team brought me tears of joy because it was such a joy watching them play in their prime back then.
I attended this game. Great atmosphere welcoming all the legends. JT was superb, he’s still got it. What a game!
Chelsea Legends should sit seat the team down and talk to them
Essien Malouda G. Zola Tiago Terry  Absolute beasts ❤
Hello
This old team is far better than the so call Chelsea squad of now
Chelsea fans must be crying to see this! Best Chelsea performance of the last years
Este Chelsea era meu time da Master Liga no PES.
Beautiful players. I remembered each and everyone of them. Their dedications to the club and how they tormented their opposition team on the pitch, especially my team Arsenal. Glad to see them once again play. Thank you for the wonderful memories legends
I'm happy to see these legend on the pitch
legends are better than new ch😂
Wish the commentators would stfu they are awful
Honestly this legend Chelsea team can win present team 😂😂😂
Jesus..... its nice to see Men who actually know what the badge on their chest means!....
Even this chelseas legends team can defeat easily chelseas present team 😂😂
Tiago si underrated 🇵🇹❤️
❤Ball from Zola was fab wow
i like this chelsea team more than now
Essien scored a similar goal in 2006 World Cup qualifiers against Uganda in Kumasi. He is class
Class is permanent
💙💙💙💙
This team is better than new team 😡😡😭
where is king Didier Drogba??😢😢😢
Zola the man who made me a Chelsea.
Better than current squad
LEGENDS💙💙💙💙
Where is Frank Lampard
Với đội hình này chắc vẫn dư sức lọt top 4 EPL. Nhìn chelsea hiện nay mà buồn
I really miss all of you, once a blue always a blue 💙🦁, forever legends
Petr Cech is Arsenal legend
Even the old player better then the new ones
Its always pleasing to watch the former players play for chelsea wish they played for the current team..
스만아 걍 가서 경질을 앞당기지 그랬냐 아깝네...
Essien player persib bandung made a goal
Woow awesome
This is what we need at Chelsea I think this LEGEND heed to talk to the current player at Chelsea so that they'll know what they are up against. They need to know they have to perform way better than this LEGEND. But currently I will prefer this LEGEND to the current player at Chelsea.
I TELL YOU WHAT.   HOW ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE NEW CHELSKI 11. AND PLAYING THESE GUYS MORE ENTERTAINING THAT'S FOR SURE LOL ⚽🥅🏐🇮🇹❤️
This team reminds me of the unbeatable chelsea lead by captain John Terry
Where is my hero Lampi 😢😢😢 we miss you so much❤❤❤
Terry and Cahill's current physique looks like they can dominate the Saudi Pro League even now.
Long live legends.. Chelsea legends look like they are still in active football. So glad to see Essien,Ramirez,malouda ❤ Respect
Drogba?
I'M A FOREST SUPPORTER OF OVER 45 YEARS NOW AND WE HAVE THESE EX PLAYERS MATCHES THE TEAM THAT WON THE 79 EUROPEAN CUP WAS THE BEST FOR ME.   BUT NOW WE LOST TREVOR FRANCIS WHO SCORED OUR GOAL THAT NIGHT V MALMO I WAS AN ECSTATIC 9 YEAR OLD IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES      I WAS A HUGE FAN OF ITALIAN FOOTBALL AFTER THE 1990 WORLD CUP ROBERTO BAGGIO BEING MY FAVOURITE PLAYER.      BUT FOR ME WHEN FABRIZIO RAVANELLI AND LUCA VIALLI CAME TO ENGLAND THAT WAS MAGIC.    VIALLI WAS AN OUTSTANDING FOOTBALLER BUT MOST OF ALL HE WAS A WARM KIND WONDERFUL MAN    SO YOUNG TO LEAVE US WAY TOO SOON    FABULOUS TO SEE HIS FAMILY AND ALL THE SUPPORTERS GIVING THEIR LOVE AND APPLAUSE.     A BRILLIANT OCCASION.   REST IN PEACE GIANLUCCA 🇮🇹🏐🥅⚽🇮🇹💖
Chelsea dipenuhi banyak bintang...lihat bagaimana umpan2nya... Harusnya pemain muda sekarang mengikuti gaya bermain mereka
I smiled from the start to the end ❤️
They play way better than the current Chelsea team
Amazing 🎉
Tears is just falling down...I thought this guys will play forever...❤❤❤❤
Enjoy this moment because next week we will face another bitter reality with Chelsea's current situatuon. 😢
My favorite team is Chelsea football club❤🎉
This is fantastic. The legends are so composed. Pure entertainment from the best team Chelsea have ever had
recall them to  Premierleague squad
Legendary. Lots of great memories here ❤
คิดถึงนักเตะตํานานเชลซีทุกคน
The young teams can't play like this wow
Essien still got it man! Such a player!…Also JT still get’s in the England team! 🤣 what a team. 🫶
So who’s the mom that was on the pitch at the end ?
They are not only the legends but God levels of football
Bertrand played more minutes than he did at his whole leicester career
My lovely Chelsea😢
Bring back these Lads!!!! Now we have a bunch of designer clothes buying backwards hat wearing kids that just don't care about the club😡
Tears in my eyes man. Nostalgia. Our legends still have it😅
AMAZING LEGENDS!!!! LEGENDS FOREVER 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Some who still amazed me is obi mikel🎉
Current Chelsea squad cant get a number in this legends side fr fr !!!
im sorry lads, but this is the real chelsea
Ashley Cole‼️
Missing Drogba, Mata, Cole, ivanovic, lampard😞😞
Essien+Obi mikel+Ramires🔥🔥🔥
Mikel & Cahill both still playing like they never aged. Amazing 💙
This Chelsea team is miles and miles ahead of the current Chelsea team.
tears in my eyes i love this club mehn i love this former players

I love games like this.. Almost the same Chelsea squad too. Nice
Essien stepping in for Sir Didier in the first goal.

Biggest fan from Nepal 🇳🇵
Essien pemain kelas dunia knp dulu pernah main di Persib,harusnya ga perlu
What a game!
the only game that unites all races...
Essien suka Siomay Bandung 👌🏽
Essien is the legend
Miss Drogba on the pitch..
One day I would love to see subbed on Cech, Terry, Lampard and Drogba. I think I would be reduced to tears.
Супер.
Unfortunately this match does not have DROGBA
True blue all through ❤🎉
🕊️🕊️🕊️
I wish there was a league for legends...or a mini tournament of them during every International break.
Gol pembuka, yakni persib bandung, siapa lagi kalau buka Essien 🎉🙌👍✊
forever blues💙
I didn't watch a game but I think Pochettino have something to learn here, the accuracy of converting the chance created😂
These were players. Committed ones.
legendary player, incredible match
Essien eks Player Persib Bandung
Kangen bgt ,liat duet cahill ama jhon terry💙
These guys are better players than the 1billion worth of players chelsea currently have.
There was no way this Chelsea team would have lost. These are the best ever to play for Chelsea. King Drogba absent
The young leds sbould learn fast oo this is the Chelsea we use to know
If the real Bayern legends play, the result would be reversed
Old Chelsea is Unstoppable that new Chelsea 😂😂😂
We presenly needs this kind Team, we will surely make to again and again.
these chelsea legends are playing good than our current team
Put these guys out in the Prem this season.
Wow this was great to watch. I forgot how football used to make me feel until seeing this. Absolute legends! Man U fan btw
Class is permanent, may these memories return to Stamford bridge
Where is Drogba? This is so beautiful.
Chelsea Legends still proving the current Chelsea team, they’re still consistent!
Best game of the season so far for Chelsea
The best Chelsea game in a long, long time. We miss you Luca.
Love to see it, I really miss that time and these men🥺
Zooollllaaaaaaaaaa❤❤❤❤
Why was Frank Lampard not invited?
Family's
Where’s Hazard 😮
This Bayern legend are all older than this Chelsea players and I think this Chelsea legendary players can play better than current team ❤
The Chelsea we know and love 😊
They player better than the current team
I miss this Chelsea
Essien❤❤❤❤
Current squad.....take note...this is how we want the stadium to sound like....this is is the kind of chemistry we need...this is how legends are made!!!
WE OUR MISS YA BOYS!
this bring soo much smiles and happy memories
This is the real Chelsea I miss it
Back when we used to be good and players cared about playing for us.
MICHAEL THE BISON ESSIEN..........
Miss them so much!!!
No drogba. Why?
Mantap🎉
I’d rather this team replace our current team Idc if they old
This is the chelsea i fell in love with
*Legends  for a reason, beatiful game, we will be back to watch Mudryk and Enzo in 2043.* 😁😋
Where was King Didier though?
This superb
Mending tukeran legend yg main di Premier league 😅
9:38 If they were young, he would definitely do kung fu 😂
We can as well recall some of these legends to fill in for the current non-performing lads!
the backbone of the team that made Chelsea FC fun back in them years.
John mikel Obi ❤
Cech can still hold clean sheets
This game teaches that It's important to maintain fitness.
Jose Mourinho Will win a treble with this legend team
Better football than current team unfortunately
Next time season i hope with barcelona legendary team
They are better than present Chelsea team 😂😂
funny that this team played better than the current chelsea team
They can play very well in the premier league now better than the current team
Chelsea owners to organize a match  btwn de legends and perharbs the our current squa, i am much sure our Chelsea legends will beat the current squad with many goals
I watched all these players in their prime, great memories
Let’s just use this team in the EPL
Our young chelsea players have lots to learn on how legends did at the pitch, they played as ones, little boys but they are orders. Its my thirst that our players to learn and do greater than them. But also l learn something that, our legends reminded us where the club came from untill these present days❤ l love you chelsea
Balck lives matter
I’d rather play with this team in the prem now that our team
I hope this game will be a blessing to chelsea....and turn our current softies into tough men.
😭😭this guys should not go, they should wait and talk to these new boys Boehly assembled....pls don't go 😭😭🤨 We don't recognize Chelsea again.
Todd Boehly should come and watch. And compare what he assembled and with these guys.
The chelsea team is younger than the Bayern team.
See crossing.!!from Ramirez. Who again can cross in this new chelsea team? Hospital Reece?
I literally wish these guys can metamorphosed back to their respective youth ages and represent us one more.... forever Chelsea LEGENDS ✅
As a Man utd fan. This Chelsea squad is top Class. Zola the maestro
This old chelsea better then young chelsea 😂
That just goes to show how coooeration lives within these men after not playing at the bridge for more than three years they have given us our bighest win at home in these past 2 seasons and already a trophy with it
Zola, ondra de Sardinna e de sos sardos ❤️
tanks everyone legends from Chelsea my one Tim 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Chelsea should start playing their legends team rather than their actual team 💀
Looking for Didier drogba
เล่นให้เด็กมันดู
Just like old days 💙
When the veterans play better football than the first team.. 😀
good chemistry buh i cant c lampard & makelele .....where are they???
I  nearly cried when I saw  Michael score. ❤
akhirnya Chelsea menang🎉
Am I the only one smiling all through or something is wrong.... definitely something so nice is happening! this throwback is so refreshing! Once again I feel the pride of being a Chelsea fan.
Челси красавцы,эти парни достойны играть даже сейчас в основе Челси
So emotional to watch classical legends!!!
Huuuu our legend play nice and nice than our current team
I miss Frank Lampard here
Goosebumps, love this nostalgia.
Let him learn something in the current chelsea look
This legends squad better than our recent squad. This is true of Chelsea that we have known before. Absolutely masterclass! If Drogba and Super Frank join this, it will more better 😀
I really miss this old boy and our current boys should copy from these legends ❤
Ballack??
I really wanted to see Drogba and Frank Lampard played
Didier Drogba mana😢
So proud that Essien has ever been here in Indonesia's Persib
Mikel is still better than caicedo and lavia
A dubs a dub
Tears in my eyes when Terry scored.
Better than the team we have now zola s master di matteo great manager
MIKEL😊🎉❤
Where was Drogba my man😂
This team is far better than current team.
Legends scoring legendary goals
Like they still in there prime 😅
Living legends 🥰😍😘💪💪💪
The 4th goal 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Correct me if am wrong but isn't the third goal offside.
Arsenal legends waiting ypu 🫵🏻
I wish this set can come back to Chelsea 😂😂❤❤
My love for this club is so real ❤ These legends play like they still got it
felt crying why is our current team not playing same as legend.
they were best it was nice game essien,ramires,mikel,tery,zola stil got it.
Vamos pizarro
They are better than the main Chelsea team
our Chelsea players at the moment should watch such a much and learn 😅
Chelsea Legend's are now stronger and more tactical than the so called current players without evidence 😅
very different when essien playing at Persib Bandung and Chelsea Greetings from Persib Essien, we always remember you ❤
Beautiful goals
This guys are forever champions......much respect from Nigeria
Legend PERSIB Bandung Michael Essien kwwkkwkwkw
Your Legends have a better goal scoring records than your current team.
2012 🎉
It's just an amazing feeling to see our legendary squad back to retelliate there winning ways to the current squads so the current squads should learn lessons from them otherwise love their Technics and tactics
Absolute Tribute to Vialli... Goosebumps to see all in the same place💙💙💙
why not HAZARD
Michael Essien has still got it. Peach of a header for the first goal, great awareness to spot Tiago for the final goal with pinpoint accuracy. A very fantasic and underrated player.
Where is Drogba
Let’s play that team Instead of the mudryk madueke Levi colwill team
Forever legends, If I had the power to rewind time, I would have done it yesterday
Mikel is not yet a legend. Dude is still very active. Where's Drogba??
Better than current chealse kkk
Idk, but i guess This squad is better than chelsea's squad today. Cmiiw
All legends,God bless Vialli,Vialli,Vialli!🫡🦁🙏💙🍻🥇🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇹
💙💙💙
and drogba
where is lampard
Masalah skill jangan diragukan  Hanya masalah umur dan stamina aja
Even bagus. Tapi legenda Munchen Ama Chelsea beda generasi gak sih? Atau saya yg kurang update...  Terus gak sia2 Essien main di liga Indonesia beberapa waktu lalu.😅  Kurang lengkap sih tanpa ada Drogba dan Lampard...😢
Give them all contracts to come back and fix our club
They don't come like this anymore 😢
maybe these old boys can still beat the current lads
why Drogba is not in it
This was the Chelsea we knew and supported back then,
To think this squad is far more exciting than current cfc 🥶💙
bobotoh merapat
M. Essien has played several seasons at the Indonesian club, namely Persib Bandung🇮🇩🔥
My all time greatest footballer, Michael the Bison Essien.
Where is our own D Drogba?
I tell you something this legends of this Chelsea squad will dismantle the current Chelsea squad. Beautiful football and amazing goals
Can we get this team to replace the current team😢
This is way more enjoyable to see rather than current fit and young chelsea team
I wish Lampard played in this...
I am very happy to see the legend playing so entertainingly
I hope the young players learn this clean football, well played my people.
Mikel could still play today
Rip Vialli.😢 Tbh his daughters are 🔥 🔥
Legends are still better than the current squad.😮😮❤❤
these old men would slap the hell outa the current Chelsea team, wouldnt even be fair, how sad and shameful, bring back Abrahamovic pleasee
This Chelsea squad in this age seems to work and do better than the current one now 😅
This lineup gives me goosebumps from 2012 champions league final with Di mateo as coach, how I wish Drogba was in this game
Where s king DROGBA
This chelsea is the best chelsea compare to chelsea now
I would like to see lampard..Drogba,  Michael ballack.. Ivanovich, Ashley cole, Joe Cole, Oscar, and so many others
Drogba?
Even at this age they are Better than the actual team atm😢😢
Am so happy to see again our beloved legends especially our captain legend of all time ..John terry..
This is enough to make a man cry..
EMANG GAK SALAH SIH LEGEND PERSIB 😂
Wallai bilahi... That assist from Zola and the one of Essien
Miss you is blue ❤❤
Incredible love Chelsea forever
Most enjoyable thing I've seen as a chels fan since todd showed up. Probably bet on this team over the current squad ngl haha.  Great stuff from the old guard.
Where’s drogba??
Terry running like his in 20s
Can they play in the league instead of the present set of guys
Essien still got it🥰💕
What an incredible win 😁👏🎉
They play better than current CFC squad
O❤m❤g❤
❤
A very beautiful moment
I wish Drogba was in this game too but wow this is Chelsea … we need this team to get us the premier league trophy 🏆💙💙
Chelsea legend is more interesting..😃
Sayang banget gaada Super frankie😢
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Essien is not very tall but he's always had a powerful header
why frank & didier not involve in this game?
I am smiling throughout the videos..the good old days. Ballack should've played this match since he played for both team. Maybe we will see him again soon with Drogba, Kante, Hazard, Anelka, Cole, Schurrle, Fabregas etc
Football is all about the joy watching it. I don’t think I felt so much joy watching a Chelsea team play like this one for the last few seasons. Hopefully our current squad gets inspired by these legends passion. These were all legends who sweated relentlessly for this club.
They played better than chelsea team now 🤣😍
tiago what a legend!
Love this Grandpas play! Better thousand times that the kids who play now on our love team Blues 🔵💙💙💙🔵😢😢
imagine Cech, JT, GC, TS in our back , Essien, JMO, Enzo, Lampard in our mid, and Zola, Drogba, Hazard in our strike.
Hopefully, this motivates the current team to start winning!
Seriously though.   Do JT and Rambo fancy doing a bit this season? Show these lads how it’s done?
Why drogba not der
This chelsea legends team can mercilessly humiliate the current chelsea squad
Better than watching the first team. 🤦‍♂️  Legends and winners.
Mikel made me join Chelsea back then...but who else noticed Ramires looking so fat...it was fun watching then..but I want to watch Oscar,Drogba,Mata ,Ivanovic and lots more again..Chelsea legend vs man United legends...thT would be interesting to watcg
These legends play very well ooo
Where is drogba😢😢
mantan pemain persib ada dong 😅
John terry is a legend man and they should call it 69th goal not 68 he has 68 already lol get the stats right
is just ME or who else believe this 1sr Team should be Starting not the 1 they have in the Prem
I'm a loyal LIVERPOOL and i Loved this
Our new players really need to learn a lot from these oldies😊😊
Si fun 😂
I’m a Zola fan’s forever that’s why I’m cfc 💙💙💙
the announcer has a banana in his throat., What a weird voice
Legend 🫡
Where is the beast the legend deder grogba
JT, Cahill, Essien, Mikel, Kalou and Ramires is still in good shape. Zola is Immortal. His passing is only Enzo can doing that in Chelsea right now
legend Persib bandung nih ngegolin
Bayern is playing exactly like the current Bayern 😂
Awesome legends match. Wonderful performance  Like in 2012🎉
where is Drogba..?
Quá nhiều cảm xúc, ước gì được xem họ thì đấu một lần nữa cùng nhau
Tears of joy was running down my face watching the highlights, I could go on crying as these players mentality and spirit will never be shown in any current or future Chelsea team :'(
I miss you legend
You know,, essien He has played in the Indonesian league, Persib Bandung
ESSIENยังเก่งอยู่เลยอายุเท่าไรแล้ววะเอามาช่วยกองหน้าเชลซีตอนนี่หน่อย
The old times. Poch please tell the boys to watch how our players used to have chemistry and play well together.
Omaygodddd🎉
Wow! Wow!! Wow!!! Are this guys really legends? Cuz they don’t play like they’re done with football. Zola still got the magic & theirs JT full of energy, mikel, essien, makelele, this guys where just too good like they’re still playing week in week out. It was really entertaining, and if argen robben should be present, which side was he going to feature? Cech still look the same. Kudos to this legends, I wish they still play active football😭. Well, the young lads of @chelseaFC just witness master class from these legends. I’m bless by their wonderful display. Thanks @chelseaFC 💙
The real chelsea
Shades of Ramieres crossing to Fernando Torres years ago.
We need to get JT and Essien Back
im still smiling 🙂
Smile all over my face even as I watch the blues🥰
Kangen sama team ini
Drogba did not  play
Good to see you guys again together 👌❤
Didn't hear anyone mention that Leg End Frank Lampshade
Beautiful
Ada pemain persib coy
I love thisssssss!!!!
I miss the good old days. That Era was when Chelsea was the ultimate menacing machine, which put fear in the heart and soul of oppositions.
Literally, I think Chelsea legend players are better than current Chelsea players😂💙
Abramovic Era 🔥🔥🔥
Legend Chelsea 5 - 0 Chelsea season 2023
Why chelsea now can not playing well like this,, more interesting watching chelsea legend play
I'm acc crying ik it's a lot slower but why r they technically better than the entire acc team rn😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Lampard?
John Obi Mikel. 👌🏾🥹🔥
Why is legendary Drogba missing?🤔
That keeper just amazed me waiting for the ball to kick the post then hand it
This is the real Chelsea FC
Love you Chelsea 💙
Great football by my sweet Chelsea amazing ❤️❤️
Crazy how John Terry is number 26 and scored on the 26th minute ❤😳
Where is Drogba and Lampard ?
Let these lads go on the pitch, they still are going to get better results and more points this season than the current squad🥲🥲
That pass from Essien was insane ❤
Zola is my favourite player in the older generation he is just goated
Best player essien
Just remembered why I have loved Chelsea ever since I saw Peter Osgood and Charlie Cook working their magic 💙
Ooo Chelsea!!Blue is the colour Football is the ......
They are sooo happy
Nostalgia 😊😢
Drogba should have been there too, and Deco
never changed  I like 3rd goal and 4th amazing ☝️🙏😍
Mikel 🤯
Hutchinson LOL
Proper legends!!!! that
Watching this game as a United fan,I realize just how much we've lost in football. The biggest losses being passion and desire for the club you play for. Thoroughly enjoyed watching this, it was a pleasant trip down memory lane.💯🔥
I hope our new crop of Chelsea players can watch this and be inspired
These guys will beat Chelsea's current squad hands-down
Essien legenda persib bandung 😂
😂 i enjoyed this , i pray that this brings good luck to our current team .
So our legends have to come and entertain us during this charity because the current team are playing rubbish 😂😂😂😂
Chelsea should just field this legend team, it will be far better than the current squad. What a game so happy to watch this.
💙💙💙💙
Nobody mentioned Didier Drogba. I missed him alot
Wow 😢 Nice football from Chelsea legends 🎉❤
Incredibly nostalgic. Vialli was an incredible man and it’s brilliant to see his memory being honoured. The Zola scoop pass, the JT goal on 26th minute and Cahill rampaging forwards…perfection
This was the Chelsea I fell in love with
Essien
Essien looks the sameee
I’m wondering why Mikel quit football so early. Man still got it in him! 💪
NOSTALGIA!!! This is so beautiful to watch fr omg
I wish Abramovich would be around.
Not a Chelsea fan but I enjoy watching this
It's always painful to watch this type of games
This right here better than current Chelsea
Esien bukannya di PERSIB ya.. Wkwkwk
This aged Chelsea legends will beat the current Chelsea first squad team... No Cap 😊
I love to see my old chelsea players❤❤❤🔵🔵🔵🔵
Some of them still strong. essien, miken. Kalou, they can still represent.
Makelele is still better than modern defensive midfielders of Chelsea. Only Kante carried on his legacy with dignity.
The fact that the currents can’t pass like this makes me cry 😢
I really hope Ruud Gullit is invited. He is also one of the Chelsea legends
Frank Sinclair?😂 He should have scored own goal for the legacy😂😂😂 Only a few might unterstand
This is the chelsea team i supported not this current one
Partida com uma chuva de gols
Was there great atmosphere last night absolutely amazing
Where is drogba😢
Oh look at Mikel, Essien and Ramires. Gone are the days
My main takeaway was, Rameries has hair?!, Thiago and Cudicini havent aged. Zola is absolute quality.  Essien looks a beast
mateo jadi pelatih chelsea lagi
Congratulations
How’ve we not got drogba on
Essien legend from persib bandung
Why Lampard Never appear on this Games ??
Did Bayern get a touch of the ball?
If young chelsea was like this😢
Fifa should organise legends league cup games
I didn't see drogba
These guys made me a chelsea fan back in the days. Hopefully, the current players will play for the badge and bring back the glory days
Please let them replace the current squad
Brilliant
these current players should watch this and learn from it.
This Chelsea legend can beat current Chelsea Square easily 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vialli's daughters 🤌
Ramires looks very different
Were is Drogba
I want to see this chelsea team play ill current
Почему лэмпарда не было 😢?
These Men just gave me goosebumps like i hv not had in ages watching us play. The playing off eachother, the link up play, the high press, the positioning, the perfect touches and passes .. Lord I could cry, we miss this and these. I dont remember the last time we scored from set pieces and goodness me, i wish these dudes can come back time travelling backwards. See how they play as if Pep Guadiola has been coaching them for 5 years... Wow.
Chelsea had a team then
My Chelsea.. 😍😍. Why is Drogba not here?
Mikel Obi needs to be in Chelsea as a midfielders coach... Man is just too good.
I feel emotional reading all d comments here😢, I just want the Chelsea I've known back😭
Sadly this squad has more Charisma than the current side we have.
Essien is better than Enzo easy
deja vu. chills
Bring back this chels
Wow... This is absolutely amazing. Wonderful performance, wonderful players. I think the young present team should watch this.
To see John Terry lead a Chelsea team out again. Wow 😢
This are real Chels💙💙
God I love seeing all these guys play again!
So sad these guys moving better than the current team 😢
Когда Терри забил гол, у меня аж мурашки по коже пошли) Сколько Легенд на поле!
Football is just beautiful 💙💙💙
They should have also brought in the winning owner for one last hurray. The best owner ever... Abramovic
Zola pass😢
To me it's not complete without senior man drogba.......I'm blues from Lagos Nigeria
The new squad should learn from the legends nice game❤ Chelsea Blue forever
I think we should remove all the young boy playing for Chelsea then replace them with this old men they better than our current team
Akhirnya liat essien bahagia di chealsea lagi🎉
Great
Where z our Didier Drogba
Ohhhhh Sammy Sammy! Nearly got himself a long range goal, a rare thing indeed!
essien PERSIB BANDUNG
I love To seen this happend i love it see old face men
🎉🎉🎉
They actually played a lot better than our current team... It was so beautiful to watch
Mikel❤❤❤
My team😊💙💙💙💙💙💙
These Chelsea legend would beat the current Chelsea team blue black anyday, anytime
In fact I really love these legends team than our current Chelsea team now, but where's Drogba and Frank Lampard nah???😂😅😊
We need this chelsea team back ❤❤❤
Drogba didn't play can somebody tell me why😭
Man, it is tempting to think that, Cahill, Essien and Mikel can still play at the high level. But, where were Lampard and Drogs?
Can’t believe cech is playing what a legend
I think we should make this a norm. Chelsea legends play all clubs in Europe. It should be like a legend cup.
we need them back 🤪
Are testimonial fixed matches?
God I miss these days💔 proper fighters and winners, our current squad is nowhere near the quality of these players
Even they old they play more better than poccotino team😂😂😂😂
0:48 who's the blonde on the right?
This was my chelsea i supported since 32years ago. Oh my world today only brought back memories of when Chelsea was the best team to watch back to back all seasons. Can our chelsea we know ever come back? Am losing hope for real.
I'm sure this team could win the league compare to the Pochettinos's players.
This team better than this current Chelsea team
They played better than Chelsea now
If Drogba had played then we could have scored 10 goals 😂😂
The legend persib Michael essien❤❤🎉
Where is drogba
Drogba missing in action?
Better than current team 😂
Really enjoyed watching this legends not as much as the current team which is lackadaisical in form
Please when is the second leg 🤣🤣🤣
Lampard should know he’s always welcome back to play as a legend
I wish they sat all our new players down there so they can see what it means to represent this club... the type of quality that chelsea has produced over the years.  Beautiful to watch with full blast of awesome memories.
zola looks exactly like ben stiller
Legends are better than Man United squad
Still the chemistry among them Definitely exist...the current chelsea squad should watch this and see how to play and learn a thing or 2 from the legends...
You add Drogba to this team, and no legends would be able to beat them.
Can we just replace this legends to our current squads... Refreshing to watch. With a big grin 😁 on my face
I just dey smile. It been long I enjoy our matches like this
Some of these guys are surprisingly still agile whilst retired. Impressive.
Perhaps CFC should replace the current squad immediately with thes3 legends!!! 😂😂😂😂
we  need a legend league with these players.
Tears man Such a legendary Chelsea squad. Omg❤ Forever Chelsea
Where was Frank Lampard?
🙌🙌🙌🙌
🙌🙌🙌🙌
🙌🙌🙌🙌
I’m a staunch united fan but really enjoying this!!!
Kami harap pemain di tahun 2020 (hingga kini) chelsea cepat kembali ke laluan sebenar..kami faham setelah chelsea di bawah pemilik baru dan pembelian pemain muda lebih 80% masih dalam keadaan tak menentu dan permulaan liga EPL 2023 ini chelsea belum lagi kami rasa gembira..harapan kami dari MALAYSIA🇲🇾🙋‍♂🙋‍♂🙋‍♂✅✅
Loving my man CUNDY on commentary.
Yup Chelsea for ever
That Terry, Čech walkout brings back so many memories. Iconic. So familiar, I look at the club now, and the state of it, can’t help but wish I could relive those seasons again.
Essien Essien Essien ✌️✌️💙💙💙
True Legend 💙 Bertrand !
Where was Drogba?😢
Zola is so good
enjoyed that. not a chelsea fan, but some quality players there. for bayern as well. really good tribute to luca, who was a cracking striker. nice to see my man frank on the pitch too
this team is better than the current team
Pity Frank didn’t play.
Respectful  oil legg BLU
Chelsea should bring these legends out retirement
❤❤❤❤❤so lovely
Cahill can still suit up, how I under appreciated him.
Chelsea best team
Where is Didier Drogba
Is it jus me or is the old chelsea better than the new chelsea
Better than our current lineup..
Future is better than old❤
Mikel as wonderful as always
Omg ... This is the  chelsea over aged team that can even beat big teams what we have right now...
It feels like yesterday watching this great Chelsea team! 🔥
Best😍😍😍😍😍 thing i watched since Champions League Final night of current Chelsea
Where is Didier drogba😢
Alhamdulillah trophy pertama di tahun 2023/2024
After one year, Stamford Bridge has finally experienced good football from a Chelsea Men's team
Can't love thses players less
This is what I watch at the past
Glad to watch these legends that brought glory to the bridge
They have lifted the curse of not scoring goals. Chelsea will now score goals like never before.
What if robben ribery and lahm were playing for bayren😊
Back When Chelsea vs Manutd was the biggest game ever, as a Manutd fan this teach was crazy scary, Lampard Drogba Terry 🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍😪😪😪😪chelsea💙💙💙💙💙
They’re better than the current squad😭
KTBFFH 💙
Zolla
I've been sick since the late eighties.  For Chelsea.  These are the guys who will be remembered forever.  John Terry, Salomon Kalou, Gianfranco Zola, Ashley Cole, Ramirez, Frank Lampard, Peter Cech, and also Alex, Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel, Toure Andre Floux, Nicolas Anelka, William Gallas.  And also Chelsea stars.  I'm still with this team.  Chelsea FOREVER! Я русский.I am Russian
Where drogba and Lampard
That squad capability is treble-winning! From 2.5 different eras.
When Chelsea was a Chelsea
Chelsea 1st eleven is almost the UCL Winner team 😂
Legend will always be legend forever love you blues 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
See me looking so emotional. I've missed these men. Thank you for your services back then and now. Good to see you all playing again. 💙
I swear this Chelsea squad can beat the current squad easily😊
this guys are better than the new chelsea
mikel is excellent
So delighted to have seen this match at Stamford Bridge! The legacy these legends have left on the club will never be forgotten, and the impact they have on us Chelsea fans is eternal.  One prominent moment that stuck out to me was: When Zola got up from the bench and fixed his boots, the stadium stood up and chanted “ZOLA!” at the thought of him finally coming on. Funny thing is he didn’t even come on then, he warmed up first. However that shows how much these players impacted the club and fans!  Another moment that stuck out to me: The John Terry goal. What could quite possibly be the most poetic goal scored in Chelsea history. Terry was captain of the team, and wearing his iconic number 26.  However, his goal was scored EXACTLY when the clock hit 26:00. Such an iconic player scoring such an iconic goal.  Of course while it’s amazing we won, we have to remember why the match was held in the first place. RIP Vialli. 💙💙💙
Zola 🥹
Gianluca Vialli forever❤️
to many legens in pitch <3
I can stop crying😭😭😭😭😭😭 seeing this again
They were lucky they never face Ribery , Robben , Lahm and Schweinsteiger
I need to see this back in my Chelsea 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Essien is GOAT!!! Damnnn just like old times. Watch how he started the 4th goal.. and within minutes he's up the pitch  to assist.  Straight from training ground!!  You can Tiago Mendes was expecting the ball to be played immediately Zola was about to pass to Essien! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿  Now sit the current squad down and let them watch this game 100 times. And we'll see a result!!!!
These are the players that have made Chelsea who they are today current players riding the name of all of these great legends I would genuinely love to see this team vs the current and see what the score line would be
This is the Chelsea I supported not these lazy boys of today
That Chelsea team now would be deadly
Missing Lampard so much🥺
Who is legends Drogba
Et to ,Drogba,Fabrigas,Robben,Lampard missing ….
First win Chelsea had ina while😭
Why can’t you play this team in the premier league and Remove the migos group you just bought 😢😅
This is so perfect and exciting and nostalgic 🥹🤩❣️🫰🏼💙
Best Chelsea match I've seen in a long time 😢😂
Legends persibb ESSIEN!
💙💙💙💙💙
Nice game...
Где Фрэнк Лэмпард ( frank Lampard?)
Frank Lampard????
I miss the old Chelsea 😂
We should switch let the legends play we win the league for real 😅
Zola and essien are puuuuure filth still , this match made me happy man 😭
This squad is far much better than the current squad, very energetic
The current squad need to see this over and over
LEGEND PERSIB INI MAH ESSIEN
Drogba?
Pemain is the best pada masanya💙
I wish this could be our chelsea squad...oooh man dis is so damn good...salute ya'll
I love Chelsea
Where was Frank Lampard 💙
Missing Drogba
Best Chelsea performance in two years
Not a football fan. But past memories of this calibre makes me tearful
Better than the pochettino squad
What a game, to see the legend on the pitch again. Tiago, Zola, Sinclair
💙💙💙 It feels so good to all the legends on the pitch
Man utd fan here but you see the amount of chips in this game? Yh that's the quality we milennials and older generations grew up watching. Gen Zs will never get this type of football from their dramaqueen vanilla players . Oh and by the way chelsea, you may wanna trade these lot for your current billionaire squad of joksters.
The problem is not Chelsea it's the current players. See the legends
Thiago silva will play with chelsea legends at the age of 60🤣
Essien again leading the team with his technicality, he will always be a legend to both Chelsea and The black Stars of Ghana . Thank you legends!
The chelsea we all ❤ not these plastic ones😢
4-0 without Drogba?
Abramovic's Chelsea! 🔥🔥🔥
WOW. Some of my Chelsea icons right there.  Love to the family of Vialli ❤
Wow what a team that's what you call a football team fantastic players that make the game so easy
This is lovely... Smiled all through... I really like CFC... My real joy givers❤
I’m sorry where was frank lampard at
Absolutely brilliant seeing all the old team make things look easy..what a team
Where's Michael Ballack?
Our chelsea legends are still performing well & interesting to watch compared to our recent chelsea players. If Drogba was around, the goal might have been more than d 4 they scored. Maybe 8 goals!😂😂
Chelsea legends play better than current Chelsea 💔💔😂😂
Where is Didier Drogba?? U cannot complete chelsea legends team without him.
What is the name of the song they all dance at the final of the video?
I didn’t know chelsea had legends .
This game made me cry . ❤❤❤❤ Only Chelsea fans understand, those prayers used to fight for our club, I feel bad to see them getting old.
Ils sont vraiment meilleurs que nos jeunes 😔
This team is far better than the present team😂
this is the best piece of football we'll be seeing during the international break
This is Chelsea i grew up loving😢🎉🎉🎉
I wish there's another Mikel Obi, Essien and John Terry is our legend. Kalou will never change from missing a clear target.
Why no drogba
Legend always legend 🔥🔥
Такой состав🤤 Столько легенд...
This is the Chelsea I know.. the Chelsea I fell in love with.. pure beauty
Mikel still doing his thing 😊
I wish we could get more of this, I won't even mind a legends cup every 3yrs
Omg Michel was balling
Thank yoy legend ❤
Nice legends Play!
Watching this with all happiness
This is Chelsea not this new era
This Chelsea legends will beat this Chelsea current team n man united team...
Wow ❤still there are strong 💪
Replace all the current team to the legends!!!
This is the Chelsea team I want 😭
Thank you Chelsea +3 points on top of the Table 😂😂😂😂
You need these guys against Bournemouth next week 😂
true blues!!! hopefully we can get back to this level some day soon. keep the blue flag flying high my friends.
This team plays much much better than the current team. As a Manchester united fan, I endorse this team...
👏🏾👏🏾Dis Chelsea 😮‍💨
What of Didier drogba
bayern sont bien guez frère même mon équipe u15 peuvent le battre mais sinon Chelsea étaient trop fort gg
Even in old age, they're still hungry for wins
💙💙💙 full blue... Estos jugadores si sentian los colores no como los de hoy en dia
One of the greatest underrated midfielders ever John Obi Mikel ❤
We enjoyed it❤
Вот это настоящий Челси!!!🎉🎉🎉
💙💙💙💙💪💪
Only player missing from this Chelsea team? Branislav Ivanovic 🐐
Where is Didear DROGBA
Notice how when they decide to attack there's no turning back unlike currently where you'll find a disoriented player deciding to go back. A bunch of sensitive cowards
was mikel always this good guys? im cryin we need this quality so much this season
This is really entertaining, so many greats on one pitch, so amazing 🙌🏿
Seth oduro
As a Chelsea fan ,we keep living in the past. Looking back , instead making a better future more successful Chelsea.
Tiago was soo underrated
Congratulations regend 😊
I remember the happy to my teem😢
Seeing Didier Drogba, Lampard, Deco, Bosingwa would have made more impact for me. I wish them well wherever they're are. They are the Chelsea players that made me a ran
Tiago and Essien for the first team now
That last goal❤
Oh my God.. Instantly being taken back to those games where every game was at such a level which we barely see today..... What happened to my Chelsea
Football is not in age but the MIND. That's why we can still watch Grown men make such sublime passes. This is MY CHELSEA
How I wish we still have them all
There’s a chemistry between this guys that current chelsea don’t have
I wish lampard was there also
These guys look more entertaining than the current Chelsea team.
Can this team play Bournemouth next Sunday
😂😂😂😂
This Chelsea team is better than the current team 🙄😭 Nostalgia is present, especially with this incredible defense of John Terry and Gary Cahill 💪
why no drogba, ballack..😢😢
I'd watch these giants lose in the Prem every week over watching our current boys win every week. I don't think people understand how much we love them.
Why is Bertrand playing in a legends match?
Didier drogba 11 where 😢
'We Need Our Chelsea Back'.
What a pass from essien🎉🎉
Time Machine .....  Lebouf, Zola, Morris, Cudicini..... this brings back memories.....  1998, throwback to a time when I used to be a wide eyed schoolboy and only just stumbled upon the joyous world of English Premier League football. And soon one day,  felt that I share a connection and deep lying passion with this club named 'Chelsea'. A connection so inexplicably deep, a passion so undeniable. It has grown within me since in such a manner over the past 25 years or so, and I have lived & followed every single moment big or small of this epic unforgettable journey so closely that today I feel I could simply stand with my chest out, filled with conviction, love and pride and say, 'Hello world, I Am Chelsea' ................
My question is have they been training together after they all retired. Because they played as a team...
Drogba
The bison say no more
God I miss our glory days when nobody wanted to face us💙💙
Where is Frank Lampard?
I can't help but smile
This team easily beats the current team lol! I miss it when Chelsea scared someone
'I Miss  This Chelsea'.
This chelsea team will beat current chelsea team anyday..
I recall essien scoring a double against wolves
Ahh those 2011 days which I grew up to see 2 champion league tittle is something special for true fans
Might genuinely be our best performance in a year and it’s with 35+ year old legends. Idk whether that’s funny or sad🤦🏻‍♂️
Bueno al menos ellos si pueden ganar un partido
Men.. i was laughing all through . Thank you Younnes for bring this to my notice. I felt like shedding tears. Seeing Mikel Essien Zola Terry Ramirez Gallas.... i mean.. Legends!!! We dont make them no more. It happened so fast. Thank you for everything. One love!!
3:11 Essien legend Persib💙
Why don't we bring back our legents to play for this one season?? Look at the killer passea
💙💙💙💙💙
Look at the stiking mentality from these players the kids need to watch this
Where Drogba
Where’s Drogba!!!
Sometimes,u just wish time can rewind!😢..I just relived my childhood 😢..oh, how I wish we live forever 😢
Just goes to show the previous generation of players were better than todays, and even though these players are in their 40's 50's and 60's, they can still play better than our current team.
this team should play against the Chelsea we have.. teach them some lessons
keren
Almost cried this awesome legends 😊
Essien, persib's legend
Why lampard and drogba not thwre
Ada legend persib bandung juga ternyata😅
I really enjoyed the game
How In my fiction I wish a scientist could clown this team and roll their years back and replace the current team.
*THIS OLD CHELSEA PLAYS BETTER THAN NEW CHELSEA HAHAHA*
That's my beloved Chelsea players, a golden generation. They have passion and spirit, hey Chelsea HQ and first squad, watch and learn!
They better than the Chelsea of today
If i were to be Poch, my current team must watch how the legends play.
The real chelsea, not celeng
A Masterclass from the Blues Legends! 🎊🔥⚽️🥅🏟️
And all this is a great merit of abramovich. We miss you Mr Abramovich
better then our current 1st team
Still steady
They play better than the actuall Chelsea by a light year
The Old Lads are better than our current squad
This is hapiness that chelsea fan never have for a year.
Legendary team 💙
Legend Zola 💙
Mikel remains Mikel, 1 of d best midfielders we’ve ever had. Just look at his composure on the ball whenever it’s on his feet.
Zola is the man!
This team will easily beat current first team.
PERSIB BANDUNG LEGEND ESSIEN😅
Absolutely fantastic play by this legends ❤🎉🎉🎉
def gave me goosebumps icl😩
Oh I miss chelsea on top... 😢😢 this legend would win against chelsea nowdays😂
Never seen a Ref with Mascots before.
Cahill Terry duo was smth else
Missing drogba and lampard 😢😢😢
These Chelseafc old men can beat the so called Chelseafc children
Better than your actual side now
I want to find out whether these guys trained together before the match
Simply the best all for vial Ii! What a club best era ever I wish they were all playing now come back and lead us jt 👍
This is the real team that made me to love Chelsea fc. What we got today is banters fc.
They are better than our current team 😭
Imagine the only thropy we'll gonna get is this trophy by our elders. They've done everything for the club for years and still had to save this club from trophiless season.
This legend team, is better than chelsea current team
Better than the current Chelsea side
WE NEED THIS TEAM RIGHT NOW!
Look at this kids. This is what we've lost. You can type most of those name on YouTube and see why we're not a mediocre team like today.
Chelsea should let their legends play the rest of their season for them cos their current team has no chance
So I’m wondering what the young generation are doing. Look at the transition here from our midfield.
Way better they Chelsea first team. And they all still look like they could play in the first team too
Great legends of the club Chelsea
When Drogba?
For Our Luca 💙💙💙
If only we could turn back time Chelsea of today needs to watch this happy days  unfortunately at the moment we're a long way off, up the Chelsea
Michael Essien❤️
Look at this my son 🔵😂
Fat shaming Soloman Kalou? Nice commentary. Let's poke fun at people's bodies while they do something good.
Brings back to late 2000s😭
Where is our double D
This team better than chelsea's team now
They  put the first team to shame
Im in tears and happy at the same time😢😊..my childhood hero❤❤
This team should replace the current chelsea team they would do better and win games.
Chelsea K0NTOL 🤡
Really miss these Chelsea Legends!!!
This is the Chelsea we allknew
Imagine the addition of drogba,costa,and a bit of hazard
peter cech❣
Glad to see our legends in game 🥲
Chelsea' boys should come and learn work here. That's how the spirit supposed to be. You just win.
What a amazing quickie gameplay🙌💝
We might need to bring mikel back what a pass
Absolutely amazing performance 💙💙💙 need this passion
Hopefully it isn't the onlu trophy to be lifted at the stadium this season.  Just saying 😅
Where's Drogba
I wish our current player should learn from them period and start wining games Zola and Essien 🔥🥰
💙💙💙
I think legend are more beta than Chelsea first 11 ....
Fun fun fun . all goals are class
We need Mikel obi back on Stanford brigh
I misd drogba 😢
Mikel....
this chelsea squad better than current squad 😂
Michael Essien header... Absolutely stunning
Respect Mikel Obi ❤
Dang it. I smiled a lot watching this game
Can they show up against Bournemouth?   I need answers  I'm feeling deep nostalgia with that classic line-up. Good ol'days of sheer grit and determination to go all the way for the badge.
drogba ?
Guys this game means a lot to our new boys at the bridge
chelsea of now
Todd boehly watching thinking "man, i gotta get me a bunch of these kids. As long as they're 22 and under that is"
Maybe play them as our top 11, they will score one or some😂
What of my double D
It was amazing
Commentators speak about that amazing Essien Goal against Arsenal but I think they are mistake as although that amazing goal made it 3-3 we eventually lost that game 5-3. Van Persie hat trick for arsenal.
This is beautiful❤, the Chelsea legends played like they were still actively playing. I can only imagine Tiago in his prime because I never saw him play.
The legends. I salute 😊😊
Drodga would have played😊
Legends🙌💙
Essien Love Persib Bandung
The only Bayern touched the ball is the goal keeper 😅😅😅😅
Where was Frank Lampard ?
Beautiful
Shame that our legends play better than the Chelsea team  Good football 💙💙
Someone with the no. 8 missing here...
Harusnya lampard, drogba, anelka, as cole ada disitu ❤❤❤
Maung Essien Legend Of Persib
This Legends will beat current crop.of players They are playing with discipline and sense of purpose

Tu bocil2 yg lagi main buat chelsea suruh melek, caranya umpan dan ngegolin, jadi gak plonga plongo doang di depan gawang
Wish we still had this team!! Loved watching this as much as i loved watching Vialli growing up! You'll always be a chelsea legend Luca...thanx for the memories 🫶💙
A chelsea team that shaves😂😂
Essien PERSIB (INDONESIA) 😂
الأساطير خليهم يتعلمو أطفال تشلسي الجدد 😔 تعبونا ب الهزايم
Sterling and co should be learning from Ramires on how to make crosses not carrying face on ground
No Drogba😂
Better then curent overpaid team.
Terry scoring in the 26th😮
Essien , Cahill, Sinclair and Mendez need to suit up , come outta retirement and save our team 🤦🏿‍♂️ They’re playing better than our current squad lol
кэхил,терри,малуда,чех спокойно потянули бы уровень рпл
The real Chelsea we all know 💙
they played better than hazard
Cahill and Terry looks fit and good enough to play in the current team tbh
Enjoyed every bit of this game… forever Blues
These guys is Blue. These guys fight for the Blue. These guys are true Chelsea
ramires will always in our heart
Drogba 😢😢
Essien ND Zola re still midfield controllers.....respect to them
Owen Hargarves didn’t get injured was the highlight of the match 😂
I hope the young boys are seeing this
Tiago na better baller 🔥✅🥰😊
Proud of them.... why is Drogba not here?
Thank you for organizing such a holiday. Great performance from Chelsea legends. Greetings from Kazakhstan, Almaty.
Only Didier Drogba missed this exciting moment
This chelsea team is giving more joy than the current one 😂
The legends plays better than the current PL team
Lampard?
Feels like am watching 2004 champions league
These legends are better than current squad😂😂😂
The new owner must enjoyed the proper way of Chelsea played.
wow.
I’m crying when watching all of them (our legends) play together again. 😢 Miss them all…. KTBFFH
How sweet this looks. Natural soccer.
A total walk down memory lane of my childhood, this Chelsea was so amazing
5:58 touch down
Memory 2004/05❤
My lagend still Good
Drogba Roman Abramovich and Morinho the special one are missing
I miss this squad 😢
Jxt imagine having Essen and Enzo + caicedo in the midfield ❤❤
CHELSEA LEGENDS 💙
Bison still got it💙
Mikel obi still got it bro🔥🔥🔥
Legend memang bedaaaaa🔥🔥🔥
Chelsea needs that person that coached these legends in this game for appointment immediately 😂😂😂😂
They play better than the actual team of Chelsea 😂
Верните мне мой 2007 - 2014😭
Wish the current Chelsea team could play this well. Great to see all them Blue Legends
Michael Essien, Michael Essien Michael Essien
Missed all that players who make chelsea so great
Commentors had a good time...😆🤣
Desde o início do vídeo foi uma mistura de sorrir de alegria e chorar de emoção. O gol do Tiago me quebrou. Zola foi, é e será, para sempre o maior de todos. O cara que transformou um grande num gigante. Viva Vialli. Viva Chelsea Foitball Club.
Zola is class as always. He's the one that made me support Chelsea.
These legends mean so much to me and my life growing up from a boy to a man. They will always be apart of me. Thank you. Forever blue.
The current Chelsea team can't beat this legends on a normal match
คิดถึงนักเตะทุกคนนะครับยุคนี้
Thật vui khi được thấy lại những thần tượng 1 thời đá bóng ❤❤❤
I miss malouda
Chelsea Legends play better than the current squad 😂
Waduh essien bukan euy, legend persib jga 🗿
Let our young team learn from them
I wish, Mikel can come out of retirement for Nigeria We don't have a midfielder like him right now
Is all about maturity in mentality and confidence and not creating tension within yourself like the players of today.
legenda PERSIB, Michael Essien wkwk
Mourihno on the Bench will have made it classical
We see the legend
Hopefully this lift the curse ❤
The chemistry and how well they played off each other was like we literally invented time travel 😭
this is so beautiful man
Our current squad doesnt give excitement and beautiful football vibes like this
these legends trying to show the current team how to get it done. totally inspiring lol
How i miss Michael Essien❤ (the bison)
man, we really need this confidence, composure right now , we dont expect the current squad to do the same, but they got to learn back all the basics from A to Z , it hurts me to see how our current squad doing right now
espérons que la nouvelle génération aura appris quelques choses
As Chelsea fans watching this was very impressive .... Our current squad come on....
bruh, they play much better than the present team
So much love and admiration for these legends
can we just keep this team🤣🤣🤣
Where is DIDIER
Sad state of affaires, this Chelsea team might be better than the current one. Loved this team and have little hope current one will bring tears to my eyes in positive way. This team had us fighting for titles, current one will be having us fighting relegation. :( . Nostalgia combined with fear for the future...
Our boys should take note on how to win a game
One assist 💯 one goal @M Essien ❤😂
Why was drogba not part of them, i miss seeing him play
Or we sell the current team then come back as legend atleast we can win 😂
Tears in my eyes 😢🔵🔵🔵
이 레전드들을 다시 영입하는건어때? 첼시, 1700억원이면 다시 오지않을까? 😂
This team can. Beat the current team
The Nostalgia is crazy, tears in my eyes, I want all these guys back, I wish time machines were real.
why ramires looks so different lol
This the Chelsea we want now ❤❤❤
I don't know if it's ok to say..... today's Chelsea players can't match these legends. Whenever I wear the Chelsea jersey it just dawned on me that it's the influence and the glory of these legends.
Zola amazing 😮😮😮
Tiago’s goal🔥
The starting 11 is literally better than our current squad…
Chelsea should use this team in the next premier league match. Our current team is shocking lol this team of players will do a better job
Mesmerizing and beautiful football from our legends💙
Где Лэмпард Иванович
Did anyone see 4-0 Return of the Chelsea legends vs Bayern Munich?
Sorry for asking, but who are those women? Serious question.
Lampard, Drogba, Torres et pleins d'autres ont manqué à l'appel
Michel essien. . Legend chelsea and persib club 🤘💙💙
Drogba, Lampard, A.Cole?
this is the chelsea i felt in love with ❤
I’m a United fan but this is actually very beautiful. Essien and mikel are way better than the current Chelsea midfielders tbh
JT scoring In 26th min .
Lampard et Drogba ont manqué à l'appel
Ramires looks so different lol. Aw man those were the players and those were the days 🥲
As Ghanaian am soo Happy to see Michael Essien played and scores.
Beautiful football but kalu never still change from his misses
Legends team playing better than our main😭
Better than chelsea current team
I cry
A smile and a tear in my eye. Chills seeing all these players on the field again wearing Chelsea shirts. 💙⭐️⭐️
Excuse me but I see only some legends there. Where is Bastian, Ballack, Robben, Ribery, Lahm and others?
Absolutely brilliant and beautifully done. 💙💙💙
Better than our current starting Squad
They play better than our current squad and this is the best game we have had at Stamford bridge in 2 seasons now Mikel still better than our current midfielders 💔
i feel so bad, they play better than our current first team😂
Playing better than present Chelsea
Skuad skrg diajari cara finishing sama org2 tua
Mikel still bosing the midfield still passes better than our current midfielders 😭😭😭
Where is  drogba
현역 첼시보다 잘하는듯
Cahill is considered a legend and not Drogba?😂 Btw chelsea lined up a much younger squad Jus saying
ESSIEN LEGENDA PERSIB BANDUNG 🎉
this is my chelsea, and this is the reason we remain loyal to chelsea which today, still flies the blue flag.
WELL DONE CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB..LUCA WOULD HAVE LOVED IT ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Those legends have written our (chelsea) story very well with on a golden plate. My fear is that this players we have now shouldn't ise their fire to erase the gold.
Essien legend of persib bandung
This is the chelsea I missed
Goes to show what we’ve been missing.
This legends team would actually beat chelsea current senior squad seriosuly Btw would want to see robben & ribery for bayern and others like mario gomez, shweini, lahm, kahn
Mikel touches 😊😊😊

My Legends 💙💙💙
I know it's probably years away but I look forward to seeing Azpi play in this game
This Legend team will beat Chelsea's current team

All round legends ❤
The current team doesnt know the jersey they are representing.
Chelsea Legends Remember 🫡💙😢
Persib legend 😍
This team can beat Chelsea current team
Essien is still great💙💪
about the only game chelsea can win atm
Let the EPL create a competition for the old retired players to compete and if possible the UEFA champions league also
Zola and Essien's assists 🤩
Look at how Mikel and Ramirez are playing reluxed wow love this..
❤
Legends playing better than our first team 💙
Infact these old players have better skills and technical knowledge than our current square. Look the passes. Just brilliant
my childhood heroes 🥹
Congrats 👏👏👏👏 this is My team but where was legend drogba
It felt so good watching this group of legends at the Bridge yesterday great atmosphere!!  Coyb!!!
Drogba?
Took me back a few years, these are the players we will always remember and associate with Chelsea. The new group have a lot to live upto. Would of liked to see Lampard and Drogba playing
Legendary indeed
Blue Legends 💙💙
They came back yesterday and showed this current squad of so called players how things are done at Stamford bridge.
Gian Franco Zola is still Class🔥
Timeflies ... growth old together...
Didier Drogba when ?
This legend Chelsea team can easily defeat the current Chelsea team. Form is temporary, class is permanent.
Where is legend Didier Drogba
this is the real chelsea lol]
Let's hope it's not going to be the only trophy we will win this season
Where is lampard ooo
Have missed these legends playing for Chelsea for sure .
Having dealt with the heartbreaks from last year and this year so far, this was a reason to remember why we love this club no matter what. Terry and Cahill still loads better than the Current Man U duo in CB. KTBFFH
The legends who made me fall in love with the club ❤❤
🥲 I miss Chelsea
A great 13 minutes watch there wasted by whoever the balloon is Co-commentating
Have more goal the old Chelsea than the new Chelsea
Bayern player are top old. They need some youthful players to help. Any great football.
Mereka masih layak untuk menggantikan tim saat ini yang tolol
8:29 awesome skill
These men made us love Chelsea not this currently jokers in the team now.
This is the squad that smeared my way to Stamford bridge...what a lovely era!!
Injuries took a lot from Essien. Dude still got it 🔥🔥
Premier league menggunakan line up ini saja 😂
This squad is serious. It feels like having them back....as for the current Chelsea squad hmmm
Thank Y’all 🧎
Sidemen charity match is clear
Essien is such a legend!
SEMOGA PEMAIN CHELSEA SEKARANG BISA NGAMBIL MENTAL-MENTAL PENGALAMAN PEMAIN SENIOR
Ashley Cole? Ivanovic? Lamps? Drogba?
Who is the girl on 0:48 ?
What a feeling
It is what it is. There is a reason why they are called legends. They played beautiful football. We need to send the current tiktok team to train daily with these legends.
I which Chelsea can play this same old oriole as our normal team 😢
It is what it is. There is a reason why they are called legends. They played beautiful football. We need to send the current tiktok team to train daily with these legends.
I had tears of saddest seeing how amazing we once was to what we are now 😢
Look at all that talent on the pitch our youngsters should learn something from them I feel like signing makelele terry and Tiago what do u think Chelsea funs
Where is lampard
❤❤❤❤😢
Drogba, Ballak, Lampard?

Absolutely legendary, I love the energy, a good atmosphere for top notch football.  Next game we need Drogba and Lampard in there.
Roberto dimateo is good. Chelsea butuh pelatih seperti anda.disaat ini. ❤❤❤❤
They looked like they enjoyed themselves. Brought tears to my eyes. These are the guys who gave Chelsea the legendary status. 😂😂Our boys needs to work hard ngl
Don't think i've smiled this much watching a Chelsea game for a long time! Loved every minute!
I couldn't control my emotions.
if this team plays the SIDMAN charity match 😂😂, they will destroy the sideman
Watching Chelsea legends play with tears in my eyes 😢
Persib legend 💙
ใช้ทักษะมากว่ากำลัง
End of an era
theyre better then the billion pound squad we have at the moment
John Terry 🎉
Good video football and success my friend 😊❤
where is lampard?
Oh man not even half a minute and they did Kalou dirty hahaha. Filthy! Also Zola still oozing class. Lovely
Wooow....and with no doubt the legends can beat this team of us currently
Mikel omg 😌😌
This team will run havoc across the current chelsea squad
I thought they would pay forever. But seeing this makes it all worth it! What a squad. John Terry, Micheal Essien, Drogba all reasons why I’m a Chelsea fan! Good game mates!
Zola my favorite player growing up. The way he play bring such elegance to the game
so chelsea had most of their best playuers they ever had while bayern had some of their shittiest players to wear their shirt :))) if bayern had lahm, schweinsteiger, robben, ribbery, lizarazu and so many others better than this lot
We need this Chelsea,,not the current one
Gianfranco Zola le mec sa façon de toucher le ballon est incroyable on sent que c’est un vrai artiste ce mec très élégant
😢miss all
This team is better than our current squad
Pls don't allow them to go ,we miss them😢😢
Why drogba not in game?
The Og.
Wheres drogba?
This team would finish higher in the PL table than our current team..
Oh this was awesome.  RIP vialli
Damien duff ? Didier drogba ?? And edir gudjhosen
Ramires 🥲
Played very well more than the current foot-dragging squad
Let's replace the current team with these legend, we can even win UEFA next season.
best Chelsea game I've seen in 4 seasons
Make this our starting XI for goodness sake! These legends have still got it. Man I miss the players of old. This new squad needs to take some notes.
Legend persib motm
Essien better than our first team.
Tears in my eyes seeing the legends back.....
Where is drogba & hasselbaink ?
Even the supporters are legend 👏👏👏👏👏
Where is Lampard?
Lampard and drogba?
Class is permanent indeed!
Ramirez and Solomon Kalou are certified legends😂 .  Proves my point ; LONDON IS RED
None of Chelsea's current players will get a starting lineup in the prime of this legendary team 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Zola performance!!
disappointed that Drogba and Lampard didn't play
mamang essien mantaps
Perfect
Smiles through out 😊
Would like to see a friendly match between the legends and the current
Goosebumps 😊
I miss rebery,robben,lahm,drogba,
The last goal was golden🎉
If I won't see such Chelsea performance this season, I'm glad I watched this. Pure football
If only Drogba was here ,it could be around 10_0
Аж олдскуллы свело. А "старички" то ещё ого-го. В отличии от молодняка, который пока совсем грустно выглядит. Гол Тиаго - это вообще моё почтение - красота, как она есть. Как же скучаю по тем временам и том самом Челси. Футбол тогда будто другой был, да и я увлекался и следил за ним намного сильнее. Спасибо парни, именно из-за вас я когда-то(страшно говорить - 20 лет назад) полюбил этот клуб. Однажды Челси - всегда Челси. Поэтому какая бы сложная и грустная ситуация не была сейчас в клубе с реализацией моментов, набором очков и пр. - этот клуб всегда в сердце! Come on CHELSEA! CHELSEA FOREVER!
Ada pemain persib maen mantap bosku
No Arjen Robben and Ribbery for bayern 🤷🏼‍♂️
Chelsea has been doing well with mixture of black n white players....thats what keeps us even better
Michael Essien The Bison!!!
Mark my word, this will turn out good for the new lad. The beginning of a new era and another beautiful history about to begin.
Should've been Chelsea legends vs Chelsea
So good to see legends
So amazing to watch this, very beautiful! All legends at one place. Awesome! <3  (Man Utd fan)
Tears in my eyes man! Rollong back the years! Legends!!!
Nice
Where's Drogba
still better than murdyk
Chelsea legend lebih baik dari pada chelsea yg skrg 😢 padahal chelsea legend usia nya sudah tidak muda lagi 😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Even if chelsea legends play against Chelsea current team trust me legend will win
This legendary team could beat the first Chelsea team. What a pity
What a joy to watch, so much quality even at their age. Why frank lampard didn't play?
Essien itu legend persib
Might as well stick Essien up at no.9 for the next game lol.
Di Mateo, the Bayern killer.... What a match! What a legends!
If only these were the days today.
Even these legends plays much better than Chelsea current team 🫡
Drogba? Lampard?
JT is still in a better shape than ______
Zalo was still phenomenonal performance with his class.
Legends vs the current team .. my life saving is on the legends 😁❤❤❤
Di Mattoe is just a blessing of a coach. And this Lengends re Chelsea heart. The love they have for the club is everything. The current Chelsea team must have the same passion to achieve.❤
Respect all ❤❤❤
I believe our current chesea team will find it difficult beating this old chelsea lengend
Ngl I would still take Ramires and Mikel for our current team. The mentality this team had was on next level
What if give to have Essien, Mikel, Ramires or Makelele in the current Chelsea midfield now 😂
Far better than our current team
Essien play better than caicedo 😊
I’ve miss Essien
Izin share
Where is Drogba???
Obi Mikel
Am just smiling from the beginning to  the end
I believe this Chelsea group won the champions league,  they were that good!
Did our current team watch this game? They need to step up in there shot on target!
The passes from Essien mikel and makelele is what we are missing in our current squad and the run like tiago and Zola position is what we lack in our forward let me not even talk of the brilliant winger of malouda and ramires and I kept asking what went wrong ?
Bring me Bayern even in heaven, we'll cook them
This game has exorcised Chelsea from its demons
Excellent team!
No need crazy speed. Just pure brilliant mastermind. We miss the old football.
wtf is that header by essien🚀
The current team must one day play against the past players
Can we swap the legends out for the current squad please brought back so many memeories
Tiago mendes was a monster >>> best player in Atletico Madrid 2013-2014 team >>> <3
class is permanent! 🥹💙
10:28 Ben just blurts out his true feelings to his work colleague. 😮❤😂
Chelsea Legends midfield and defence>>>Current Chelsea
I just watch with smile😊 indeed legendary😮
Interesting game ❤️
That Chelsea team is wonderful to watch, but as a neutral in this case that Bayern lineup was shocking, which is strange considering the amount of great players Bayern have had(like why doesn`t the likes of Lahm, Schweinsteiger, and someone like Mario Gomez play for this Bayern side?.)
this team would smash the young players what a joke the current team is
Lampard
The legends, will defeat the current chelsea squads. They are so composed. Welcome legends.
Mikel is superb 🎉
Легенды намного лучше нынешнего состава играют.
Zola!! ❤
Have also noticed the team cheers the  one who pass the ball to get the goal than the scorer so amazing Legends ❤❤
The Chelsea legends were far better than the current Chelsea squad 😯
💙💙💙
Essien
Wish chelsea was like this today
I would rather see this legend every week than see the current Chelsea squad
All the goals from our Chelsea Legends were breath taking ❤️🤗❤️
can we swap this team with the current team?
where frank lampard ? 😢
Legend ! The chelsea team that I supported with confidence :')
Where was Drogba?
This time chelsea is there for trade not happiness for the fans... Buying small small guys and at give them time!!!! Which time when the season is on going
i love chelsea 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Mikele passing 🔥🔥🔥 enzo has been doing this ,like fabregas  I hope our boys are learning from this legends
💙💙💙
This Chelsea team is do good. So fresh.
Once a blue always a blue, even for a season. Chelsea is bigger than a football club, it's a movement for love, peace and hope.
Pochèttino are you watching?
For life my team🎉❤❤❤
That assist from my country man essien cost 30billon dollas
Essien, complete baller👌🏿
please just create a legend league now, i will rather watch legend play than watching our current squad
Era Roman Abramovich kala itu... Dan kami rindu
😭😭😭💙💙😂
This team is playing in the English League now instead of the disabled who are currently there
Would have loved to see Torres and Lampard😭
The only match that chelsea could win
It feels sad to compare them with our current squad... this team was a collection of pure creams
I was just a lad when these guys played, they made me love not just the team but the game.
Why didn't Drogba play
I started supporting chelsea during their time
Legends have more chemistry than our current players.
See watin current squad can’t do but the old folks are doing it
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not this bunch of players who don't understand what it means to play for the badge
As a teen, i watch them play. Now I'm 36, damn time flies. 😢
I will miss Vialli so much.😥💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
💙💙💙💙
🥲
Legend are playing better then those new boys 😊😊😊😊
Abramovich also is a legend of Chelsea I didn't even see a farewell for him
Champions league final 2012 legends match!
Hope this our current team are watching how to play football
Watching them play brought me more joy than new chelsea team in recent seasons🥺🥺🥺🥺
legend of chelsea football...
Thats the Chelsea we grew up .
OMG! Look at Michael Essien's assist for the last goal... class is indeed permanent😳
Form is  temporary, but Class is permanent!
Chelsea seems to be the club with most successful black players even now
Essien pemain persib
So glad to see Ramires still giving the assist.
DROGBA FABREGAS DAVID LUIZ LUKAKU TORRES BALLACK INVIT2!!!
💙💙🇮🇩
Who were the ladies on the pitch???
they should really play a match where the legends play against the current squad
Chelsea 👍👍👍👍👍👍
they could  have  played  after  international,  so that the  young  CHELSEA to see and  be motivated 💪💙💙💙💥💥
Who else misses this players😢😢😢
these are the people who made me fall in love with chelsea, and moreso football
Look at those names compared to now......what a downgrade.
Where was Didier Drogba? 😢😢😢
We miss you mr.abramovich ❤
Mikel today would be easily worth 100mil
Legends never die
Legend PERSIB BANDUNG essien..goll😂😂
😢I remember those days
Passion, memories and legends
Makelele and Essien, no current midfield compare to this class
❤
they should  be X1 for chelsea team,those are true legends, who was their  coach
Youngsters today don't know of the Zola affect
This is the Chelsea I know and fell I love with. I don’t know the current imposters masking as owners, managers and players. 😢
Essien 🇮🇩
This was the Chelsea we all knew. Essien The bison
Would love to see the legends play against the current side
So much memories
This is the real Chelsea that I will love forever! The current squad is nothing but a joke!
The quality!! Modern Chelsea don’t have it, it’s just pace everywhere with no end product.
Cel
Blues legends ❤️🔥🔥
These were men, warriors on the pitch , they don't make dem like before anymore
Chelsea forever
If I'm to ask? Why did Cahill retire? He's still fresh 😅
Please Chelsea can you give these guys 3yrs contract each and let them show the boys how to play with pride for the pride?
And Didier drogba?
Persib merindukanmu Essien ♥️
We love that.
The current crop of Chelsea fc players should have been brought to thr stadium to watch this match and get inspired.
i really miss this team
This club will never go down we’ll be back were we belong trust me ❤🔵🔥
Miss Tiago there.. he went to Atletico  and became a great capt there.. what  a player he is
Bison essien
I was expecting to see Drogba tho
I dnt think this current Chelsea team are  real blues the forwards should learn from Terry's goal and the last goal that was wow and the midfielders should learn from this game  this is Chelsea we know❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where was Frank Lampard
John Obi Mikel looks so fit !
3:07 great heading 😮😊
I think essien and mikel should still be playing lol
💙💙💙💙💙💫🎉🎉
Time and seasons
beautiful
I don't think this match is an evenly contested match. Chelsea fielded more stars and younger players. There are some of them that CR7 & messi are older than them
This was 'THE' Chelsea team.
I miss Michael Essien ❤❤❤❤
Lmfao   Now they have a spoils-of-war Ronaldo for 100M 😭😭😭
Were our current squad there to take notes
Rindu dengan chelsea yg seperti ini
Great occasion. Well done Chelsea Legends and rest in peace Mr Vialli. 🙏 Blue will always be your colour. 💙
Obi mikel padu mantap
The Legends team is way better than our current team...that's just sad
Where is Drogba and Frank Lampard😅
Enzo and Moises, please learn
Can you comback chelsea squad?
Malouda ❤
Nowadays players... Zero touch 100 redbull
Bravo Our Beautiful Chelsea Legends!!!!💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Melihat tandem jhon terri dan chahil.. ingat masa jaya nya
persib pride
❤❤❤
Tim utama chelsea ganti ini aja para puh sepih
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢.... Memories I miss 🌟
エッシェン、ミケル最高すぎる😭
Essien is prolific 😊
still better lineup than current Chelsea
Took me back in 2008 when we lost to Man U in the UCL final Essien,Terry,Cech, Lampard,Drogba,👏
Awesome players. Not this days recent players. 😂😂😂
This lineup is the best than the lineup for pochettino
The Chelsea we all wanted with a formation the team is used to... Not this current rubbish we call Chelsea
very better now chelsea players😂
This is what the blue is 🥹
Alhamdulillah Essien bisa main di persib lagi😅
Zola still zola 😍 all of them best ❤👍 we miss drogba  balake  lampard  cole remirs
Absolute class from The Bison 🇬🇭🦬
Legends playing  Entertaining football this way is just LEGENDARY. ❤
Hope the current chelsea squad were watching or have watched this. And i hope Poch was watching too
These guys are still better than our starting 11.
I miss this Chelsea team 😢
Drogba?
That's my childhood 💙💙💙  KTBFFH
Can we have them replace the present team?
better then our first team resign them all :D
Gianluca would be proud. May be RIP
Старая гвардия всегда была лучшей
Given us somewhere to start from, after the break,thanks legends for this morale boosting game
Put this to replace their current squad and it’ll be an improvement lmao
Legend persib main uy
Drogba ????
Omg! So nostalgic, it was these legendary players that got me supporting Chelsea in the first place, everything about the Abramovich era was successful and brilliant, a far cry from the disastrous football we are tortured with from the current chelsea squad, bunch of overpaid fashionista sorry excuses for players we have today. Such a sad time in Chelsea history but these legends will always be a reminder of the great club we once were. To the Chelsea legends, I thank you for all the wonderful memories, I salute you 💙💙
Only king didier was missing
Drogba where?
They played better than the 2023 team.
Not a Chelsea fan but it's great to see the legends of the game♥️
What a team of icons.
Hope the lads learns something from this game, this was a masterclass from Terry,Zola and mikel
Michael Essien great from Persib Bandung🇮🇩
Mike come back from your retirement and help us please lol 😂
NOSTALGIA HITTING SO HARD. 💙 insane amount of synergy.. feels so good watching players who made me fall in love with the Club 🥹💙
I like the team's legend play I think the current team for Chelsea should copy such a good play off of our legends
I’m not crying! You are…
Can we get Essien back please ❤
I would take this squad ❤ anytime over this new team
Our legendary team will beat our current XL hand down.....This is the Chelsea i know before❤
Where's Drogba?
this is a really incredible event....we miss this squad
What hapenned with Dessaily, Joe Cole, Lampard, Drogba? 😢😢
It just hits sooo much harder. I miss all of these guys.
The current squad is no where  to this team
❤
I can feel my heart explodong especially when essien scored....😢😢 this is the team that made me love football and chelsea fc❤ thank you for sharing the highlights😢
These legends are what made chelsea is today. Young'un please follow the foot steps of our legends.
Shame there was no Drogba
may be this is not now
the chelsea of the legends plays a lot better than the current chelsea
Muller: Barcelona will pay for this defeat next season
ITS 2023 AND WE'RE WATCHING TERRY SCORE A GOAL AT SB 💙💙
Les moment me manques trop
*The Blues Chelsea LEGEND*  Perfeck ❤❤❤❤👍
This team will humiliate current one for sure.
I miss these guys. Superb display. Love you guys so much.
I think this Chelsea squad can trash the now Chelsea squade even with their age
This team is better than the current team of Chelsea...
Bring them out of retirement lol
Where is Didier Drogba and Lampard
Add thiago silva when he retires with terry at the back
They're better than the first team rn
Essien can still do a better job in our midfield today than the sideways passing midfield we have😊
Hope the kids will learn from this. This was our Chelsea....the winning Chelsea....the warriors of Chelsea.....missed DD and Lampard in this match! 💙💙💙💙💙
I didn't see Drogba played.... 😕 😐  These legends still gat wat it takes to return back to the bridge...
Chelsea legend vs Chelsea sekarang bakal menang Chelsea legend
where drogba😭?
Mikel Obi still got d MAGIC PASS❤
I feel like crying 😭..... How much I miss this great team😢😢😢
Grande Gianfranco, leggenda blues ❤🇮🇹
I love you caption John and my super mf Mikel Obi ❤️❤️
Wow... PERSIB BANDUNG legend Essien scored the first goal in this match.😂😂😂
Blues for ever
essien legend persib
Makelele el mejor
Michael Essien legend Persib 👍
Zola ❤️
Wow! Amazing, Wish drogba11 played too❤❤❤ Good job my legends💪💪
Super Frank?!😥
What a great night enjoyed every moment of it and I’m sure Mr Vialli’s family had a good time remember their loving husband Father and a legend of the game very touching moment 🌍✌🏼
Good dna❤
This team would beat our current team 🥲
Beautiful my life
kalou still misses till this day
Mental juara ini yang kami penyokong mahu kan dari team yang ada sekarang seperti mereka legenda itu..di bawah kendalian Roberto di Matteo.tetapi di bawah kendalian pochetino..mereka tidak seperti lagenda ini..mental juara mereka merudum!!!😪
Mikel, makalele, and pa zola with Ramirez kudos to that midfielder
Where lampard?
Where DD
Essien ngeprank persib 😂
Somebody should force the current squad to watch this
Chelsea legend better than real Chelsea squad
The fact that old men are way better than the present team
Legendary team. Missing Frank, Drogba and Ashley Cole though.
Essien is truly the ‘BISON’
Back when there was true passion at our club. These guys will forever be legends of the game and club 💙💙💙
Zola is a Big name
Bagusan team chelsea yang tua tua nya bhangsat
This Chelsea legends are miles ahead of their current group of players 🎉
Very fantastic
Mikel should still be playing 😔
🎉🎉🎉🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
😅 i love it
This team beats the current Man City
LOL, this isin't bayern legends. Where are ROBEN, RIBERY, LAHM, OLIVER ??????
Roberto di matteo ❤
If you add Drogba to this legends team , they will beat the current Chelsea team 3-1
Where is DD an Frank
This was more entertaining than our first four league matches 😂
Essien ❤ the Bison
❤❤❤❤ this is love
Class is permanent
no Lampard ????????? how come ???
When did the rain start beating us
Mauricio!! Look at these footballers! They count not 1bln, but playing so much better. They deserve 100th chance to destroy
Essien Persib Legend still fire 🔥
Am shock
It is the only trophy you will see this season boss😂😂
Legends💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
For the next charity match I hope will be against Manchester United legends. Include CR7 in that match for more crowd. Beckham, Rooney, Cantona, Berbatov, Scholes, Carrick, Giggs, Evra, Neville, Vidic, Ferdinand & Van der Sar against our legends will be good nostalgic match to watch.😁
Where drogba ?
Tears in my eyes  I'll forever support this club
Get Essien and Mikel back in that midfield. They are far better than the rubbish they got now. Man I miss those good times.
sekarang Chelsea menyedihkan,pemain mahal tapi ga keluar talentanya
The current chelsea team needs a pep talk from this guys. Honestly
drogba Lampard denbaba,dari gua kecil gua suka Chelsea tapi gua seorang Madridista
Where is drogba
Nostalgic watching This video. Incredible to see the Players Play so Good.  Kudos Mikel, Essien, Zola. Such a Delight to Watch the highlights.
This team is far much better than the current imposters
God I am so much happy to watch this ….the chelsea team we grow up supporting ..watching Ramirez malouda zola Kalou  mikel easien playing good soccer  like this at there age mehn …kudos
Here I am smiling through out 13 minutes
Essien and Claude in the mid. Legendary. Kalou of course missed s 1 on 1 chance 😂
Watching this video makes me happy. This is not just d current unpatriotic set of players at Chelsea. These re the real LEGENDS
our retired players are better than our actual team ffs
Just missed this great squared...😢
where's drogba
Drogba? 🥲🥲
Di mateo ❤
Made my day! 😅
Our legends still got it there. That’s why they are the legends. Did the basics right. Excellent first touch & control the ball with great composure. Our current players lack of composure & pressing merchants. That’s why we lack of creativity & goal score. Terry, Cech, Makelele, Malouda, Kalou, Cahill still being excellent. Lampard, Cole & Drogba cameos will be good for our nostalgic moment.
No one talks about Essie  pass
Awesome. This was just as good as going back in time. Great to watch! I also know all the players unlike today 😂
These are the real Chelsea that changed the history of football  I feel like some of them should come back to help this current squad Terry, cahill at back Mikel, Essien,lampard middle Drogba, Zola, maluda front
Where's Phillip lahm podolski  and kahn?
I smiled throughout the video. Memories, these guys made my childhood.
Bahkan para pemain tua ini,akurasinya jauh diatas pemain indonesia😂
Where's lampard and drogba?
The legends already have more goal than we have this season
The Chelsea I fell in love with
There goes our only trophy this season 😭😭😭
Am happy to see Mikel Obi featuring.
Where is Lampard? 😢😢
As a Liverpool fan this was the Chelsea FC I grew up see my Liverpool team rival!  The rivalry was soo much intense especially at the champions league level back then. Wow, how time flies.  Who noticed majority of the perfomer in this game were players from the Chelsea's golden generation of Mourinho as the coach.  Essien, Cahill, JT, Mikel, Ramirez etc.
Michael Essien can still play for Chelsea. He is still strong 😊😅❤
That parting note on Vialli gave me chills🥺
In a few minutes we just lived decades ago, How much was beautiful this time... Just take some of this squad to our current squad and we can be much better
i miss essien
Why Chelsea don''t called Drogba and Lampard for this match?
Looking at these legends playing so well makes me ashamed of our current squad...
What a pass from Mikel, what a miss from Kalou.
I miss this Chelsea . 😂
Current player need to watch what it mean by playing for the club, playing for the badge and playing for the fans..
Legend is blue 💙💙💙
I think our present team need to watch this every morning .... Well done TEAM a clue is "TEAM" commitment and passion ..... You don't need to pass back its its called class commitment and not being afraid to lose because your team are backing you if you lose the ball.... S😘 much Class thankyou lads for the memories 🥰😍😘
This legends played better than our current expensive for nothing squad, I'm glad Lampard wasn't playing
I'm in tears of joy
THERE SHOULD BE A LEGENDS LEGAUE.
man I haven't smiled this much as a Chelsea fan in fkn YEARS LOL
brilliant cause, great football player, an even greater man he was
Lovely to watch.
John Obi Mikel. Such a player
This is so so soothing to watch💙🥶 rest on vialli
Our young squad has a lot to learn from them,💙💙
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
pengobat rindu
Wow it was like the soul came back in Chelsea FC
Can't stop smiling seeing our legends play this beautiful game🎉❤
Just want to know the song in the end. Pleade 😂
Essien's pass was so beautiful
Good to see Mikel obi
Magic Box
how do this old people play better that 1bn squad of kids. they can learn how to score goals. current team very poor on set piece look at Essiens header
Resign some of these players essien  was just class Cahill was still brilliant. Terry has never lost it .
We're is drogba?
How is ramirez sooo handsome??
Let them play with our current team
Todd Bohely has just made a 2bn pound offer for the entire chelsea legend squad
Could be better than Chelsea's current first team
Mikel still looks fit. Chelsea bring him back
Miss Johnterry, Frank Lampard. Legends! ❤️❤️❤️
this is the counter attack from chelsea that im so hoping to see this again hm..
Good to see the legends can score more goals than the current team at their age 😅
The winning spirit is still in them unlike our current squad
The Players who made me support Chelsea, am now undergoing depression but I can't do anything 😢😢😢
Let's get our young team watch their videos over and over again. They will learn a lot from them.  I've missed my Chelsea
Makeleke and Zola😭Even though I’m not a Chelsea fan, I still find it very touching🥲  I think Mikel is still capable of playing in the lower leagues.
boleh mereka aja gak yg main di premier league musim sekarang? KTBFFH❤
HATRICK FOR DIDIER DROGBA
Not me smiling and crying at the same time....oh my chelsea🥹
Pls somebody reminds me, when was the last time Chelsea scored 4 goals? 🤔😔
Mind football more entertaining than feet and leg football❤❤ Football Is The Game
at least the fans that went out there enjoyed a home game this season
Ce Chelsea me manque tellement 💔😢
Mikel Obi, man was ahead of his time.
Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and watch these players in their prime.. sadly these days are over and the current Chelsea is not the team we once knew, there is no effort and the clubs soul is gone. Thank you for making the fans smile once again 💙
Let these team play these season,they are better than the present team..but there was no Lampard!!
I would still pay to watch this lot than today's Players UTC
At least these legends still know how to win
This is what football used to be 😔
Epl should add the 3 points to our current team.😅
Beat them in their backyard and now our own backyard
Coba chelsea yg skrng mainya sprti ini all atack nyerang trus smpe buat banyak goal
Terry is not ageing...what?
Terry going for the ball and scored must be a big lesson for this youth  I think the spirit left with this team 😢😢
Could have got hazard to play 😂 it would be an absolute dream to see him and zola on the same team
Essei is huge that he cant do the runs he used to do
Essien is a powerful classic midfielder
Current Chelsea is no match at all
The chelsea they want to be  Reality: 😂😂😂😂
What absolute superstars reckon they could beat our first team now,pire class and legends
They're still far better than this current team, most of our current players ain't playing the passion
This match reminded me of what made me fall in love with chelsea
Legends playing wayyyyyy better than this most expensive squad we ever lined up 😢😂😂😂
They play better than our current team❤❤❤❤❤
Omg this was lovely 🥰 ☺️
Cahill mikel still needed in the current squad 😊❤
These legend are playing Better than Chelsea Squad now
Legends played better then the current first team FACTS
the spirit of these legends is better than our current squad
4-0 Without Drogba 💀🔥
Where's Super frank
This squad can beat our current team 😂
A legend league should be created I think….. I’m tired of watching our current team😭
Goosebumps seeing JT scores his goal 💙💙💙
This is actually the best match I have seen this season from a Chelsea shirt. I'd adopt the team than the Chelsea current squad. The mentality and understanding is magnificent, even Chelsea's current squad lacks that. I LOVE YOU my Legends!.
Hopefully this current fragile squad was at the stadium to learn from the legends.
They need to play this clip for the young lads
Absolute awesome experience 👏❤
Sorry MIKEL for the injury
Now, THIS IS CHELSEA !!! 😢😊
Made me smile so much this, those legends were the ones I watched growing up. God, I miss the old Chelsea.
What a goal for thiago mendez 💙💙 amazing
I think we should allow our legends play the remaining matches for us
Essien can make a start at current Chelsea team and compete
Most interesting matchI have watched Chelsea played in Years. Love these guys
Why can't the young lads now play like this
This left with goosebumps. This is the Chelsea I grew up watching. What a team
Lovely 💚💯
where’s lampard and drogba?
I love our legend 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Please bring back our Chelsea😊. The legends were and are still amazing. Let’s give our new boys the support needed to thrive also. One Love Chelsea ❤
They play better than what we have currently. We can do with their services 😢😢
ฉันเริ่มเชียร์เชลซีในยุคนักเตะพวกนี้
I miss these players😢😢 we miss these qualities😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Mikel Obi needs to Take Enzo in for a private Lesson 😊
The legends could probably give us a good chance of winning the league. Bring back Terry, Cahill, Essien and Hazard.
Please  tell fifa to creat legends champion league and every legends must be 45 and above this will compare them to live long because most of them retire and they grow fat and they cannot even walk or do anything for them self's if you support my ideas  just give me YES
It's crazy how you put a couple of older Chelsea players together and they click immediately because they all understand the Chelsea blueprint. Our current team needs to watch this and study what it means to play for the Chels
OMG back in that days haha, beautiful memory
so john Terry came from retirement with the old boys and bagged a trophy again, while our new boys are still stretching for form.... wahala!!!
Better than your current 11😂
I have watched the video many times how could these old folks be this good than our young lazy overrated and highly paid players we have currently? Mauricio Pochettino shoud watch this
Old memories are the best
Chelsea have no content to post except for losses so they have to post matches from last century 😂😂😂
Their shots still goes on target😊 that's lovely
Thank you, CFC and our legenda for honouring the memory of Gianlucca Vialli!❤
Brilliant game and fair play to everyone involved great cause RIP Vialli ❤✝
This is the happiest I have been watching a Chelsea match for a year now. It was always going to be the legends to put smile on our faces in recent times.
This team would not lose to N. Forest. These guys played for the badge, and knew how to payback to the fans with wins!
where lampard
Cant believe you brought Essien out of retirement for me 😭😭😭im grateful❤ This was such a treat. May Gianluca continue resting in peace.  was Drogba not available?
This is Chelsea that I know ❤💙
WOW!… Proper Chelsea!… 😎
This is the Chelsea we all know 😀
Only European win this season😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
They know how to score headers....
I love this up blues
Wished to see the legends back home and they did come back to recreate old memories
Next legend vs current squad..
Not bad for their ages 😂
legend persib mang essien
Chelsea need to bring back Mourinho to fix all issues
This just come and start to playing with Chelsea now because playing good than this junior playing at Chelsea now
obi mikel better than CAICEDOO
New player chelsea..please watch n  learn from legend..
This squad can beat Chelsea’s current squad any day. I just couldn’t help but smile throughout 😊😊😊
El volver a ver a tantas leyendas siempre es un honor.
These legends should replace the current chelsea team.
I missed this chelsea team
Smiling every time one of these legends touches the ball. Having a flash of the great games back in the day
Definitely missed this winning mentality frm d current boys
I think we should replace this squad with the recent squad
Where is Drogba and Lampard?
بايرن ميونخ لم يهاجم حتى ان لاعبيهم جميعهم عجزه
Would have loved Drogba in this...seeing all these legends..Up the Chels ❤
this team better than the current chelsea squad
Class is permanent
We really needed this Win. At least we now  have a trophy this season. Congratulations Legends!!!!
Zola ❤
ยุคปจุบันมึงมากันมาดูนะ
Chelsea legends with the muscle memory but the current ones cant put 2 n 2 passes together lol
I enjoyed this match Blues for life❤❤❤❤❤
I was in 😢😢, God please bring back our belove Chelsea we all grew to support 🙏🙏🙏
Great memories of Chelsea Legends brought back in celebration of the life of Gianluca Vialli
Can we just have this team instead of the current one 😂
Our current players should learn from this  They should take notes
Legenda Persib ngegolin coy
This is classy,i love it. These little guys should take a cue from these legends
Just look at the creativity and the finishing. Even without a coach they still had a plan and did well with it unlike our current team that is full of average and inexperience players.
I wish all this young chelsea rubbish could watch this and see how football is played.
😢😢😢
Legend John Terry
Essien legend persib
This highlights is the best of Chelsea I have watched in the last 2seasons, seems our present crops of players don't really have the "Chelsea Spirit"
This is the Chelsea we want ❤❤❤❤
Zola creating better chances than our midfield trio this season 😅😅😅
Forget messi man Zola is the real goat
I think this team of Chelsea players could beat our current first team😂
John Obi Mikel.... My fav... Some years to come we will see d likes of Cesc, Mata, Oscar and Hazard play as Legends of Chelsea, not this crops of small kids playing for Instagram
The only silverware won at Stamford Bridge this season😂😂😂😂😂
Tiago Mendes was on another level
Sweet sweet memories. What a fitting tribute to Vialli!
Can we please have this kind of match at least once in a month? This brought tears of joy to my eyes. I love them all
I'm crying watching this match with these man. God i'm dying missing them. This is the real chelsea fc
Leaders + Winners. Hope current youngsters and coach participated during this match. Please learn from them
Thiago mandez
Still above womens standards
0:49 😍
One of my own🎉🇬🇭
This team is more i mean way more better than our  current 1 billion pounds squad
Wow great performance legends ❤🎉😎
Our coaches should sit all the current squad down and let them watch this full match
I need this team back..
Beautiful goals. Mikel has improved. We should resign him!
These legends still played better than the plays we have currently.
❤❤❤❤❤
Woooooow
Good initiative
mamang essien from PERSIB BANDUNG
That ttago can bench some of our youth players currently
Offsides😅😅
No one is talking about Mikel
Lejen encib
Where is drogba
Put this squad on against Bournemouth next Sunday
Can we offer these lot 7 year contracts instead
this is REAL CHELSEA
Nothing will beat this team🫶🏼 Watching this was emotional
Mamang essien mamprang euy
Essien got football brains ❤
Very nice game. Some of us have never seen some of our legends playing😂😂🤦🤦
This was the team that made me fall in love even with Chelsea 😊💙💙
See confidence, team work, commitment, Fighting Spirit, tactics, Dominance, exploit and glory. Our legends on point. I'm very happy and proud. Thanks for everything.
Our legends have scored more goals in a match than entire chelsea first team have in an match since 3 October 2020,  truth of how bad we are, u can't compete against top 4 with such statistics rubish todd boehly rubish squad rubish coach
Legends ❤❤❤
Better this squad we can win the title
Soccer legendary ❤
Essien legend two the blue chelsea and persib bandung
Let all our current players watch this clip when they are back in training so they can learn how to be passionate, zealous and have the winning mentality this current team lack, I was smiling all through this video, Chelsea for life 💙
Till now i have missing this line ups.
Seeing JT lead Chelsea out at Stamford Bridge one more time >
Man i miss these legends in our team
I've never picked a club until I saw smiley Zola and the way he played then Blue is the colour I chose until now .
Chelsea and united have lost their identify badly😢😢😢
Current team…. I hope you’re taking notes
These guys are talented! The same way they played during their young years was the same way they played in this match. Chelsea run in their bloods!
Mang essien pemain persib bandung
Our legends have a clear plan by the way they move the ball, no unnecessary back passes. A lot has to be done in our current team
I hope we do something like this every year 💙
Claaas is permanen
Watching this game brought so much nostalgia. It shows how Chelsea has fallen in quality and standards. Just watching Essien, Terry even Zola still playing better than the present crop only brings sighs.  That 4th goal, was pure beauty. Essien's pass was just out of this world. Don't this present watch how the legends did it? It's so disheartening to watch them play now. 😡
Essien persib bandung
Tiago is still good at finding empty space
Where is Drogba?
Oh I really miss these legends. Mikel Obi still very sharp. Terry fantastic as always. Essien...oh my God still very fantastic. This guys made us love Chelsea FC. I'm so entertained watching this.
Cant for the life of me understand how Gallas is welcome
Essien still scores good and these new players can't even hit at post
👏👏👏
Chelsea will bounce back stronger that i know for sure
What a match! All these men have aged like fine wine. Feels so nostalgic to be watching them play again after all these years.
If only there was no Ukraine war, Mr. Abramovich should have been in the owner's box in his brown jacket and you would think it's a normal Champions League night. I miss you all. I miss my Chelsea
Why not eden hazard playing?
Cahill plays better role as target man than our strikers too😂
Good memories❤❤❤. Our heroes...
Who are the two commentators?
These legend can beat west ham.
The match was rilly fascinating😅😊😂
They play too much better than, well you already know...
These legends should play against the current team and show them how football ought to be played...😢😢😢💙💙💙
John Terry has more goals in this year for Chelsea than modryuk has for entire Chelsea carrier 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
JT plays even better than our strikers.
waktu begitu cepat berlalu ktbffh💙💙
🎉this team can beat our current squad😂
Where is Drogba or Lamparad
CHELSEA, our TRIBE ... happy to see them play. @essien GH
why is Commentator Mentioning John Terry. HE WAS no where near When Essien Scored. HE MENTION JT MILLION TIMES. bro thats essien goal
Maybe the current squad need to learn something here 🔵
Essien❤❤❤
In memory of joy at the bridge
At least Chelsea curses are now broken.....good one ...for the unity...and blue's family....
Chelsea legends are too much🥰
Gusto should learn how to pull out. Respect to our legends. Pls they should pray for this generation for exploit and glory
Wow legend's are always legend's it's been wonderful to see them heart full thanks for the organisers hope we see them playing more better than the current team
Please out klinsman!!!
As a Chelsea fan for 56 years these Chelsea Legends showed how Football should be played and how Chelsea should be playing today. Seeing the greatest foreign player ever to were a blue shirt and one of my all Time favourite players the great Gianfranco Zola, the other being the late great Peter Osgood play once again took me back to when I went to Stockholm for the European Cup Winners Cup against Stuttgart with the other 34,000 fellow Chelsea family members, when Zola scored that incredible goal what a night. Seeing this game vs Bayern Munich with these Chelsea Legends was a breath of fresh air to see these Chelsea Legends show how today's crop of Chelsea players should play. Even at the Chelsea Legends ages they were pure class, tactically on the ball and poetry in motion, with Di Matteo as Manager it was an honour and a privilege to watch. Gianluca Vialli is so missed by us Chelsea fans as we loved him and Stamford Bridge will always be his home and he will always be remembered and loved. His family are a part of our fantastic Chelsea Family and they are welcomed back to the Bridge anytime as this is there home and they are a part of the Chelsea Family for life. God I love Chelsea fc, our Legends, and my fellow Chelsea fans (the Chelsea family). CFC 56 💙⚽️💂‍♂️🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇪💙💛🇺🇦🇮🇹
I'm in tears. This is Chelsea. Thank you legends 🥹💙
Not a chelsea fan but gives me chills seeing Essien and Makelele on the pitch again
I hope these new players get a lesson
None have played In The last 10 years and are still better then our starting 11
You fake supporters busy saying our current squad is nowhere near this team YES because they are on their way to becoming legends. The time we bought these players the Chelsea legends they where nowhere good as they became So relax give this current Chelsea squad a year or 2 you will come and testify on this comment
Even Leicester commentator is gone 😢😢😢😢😢
True champions, missed on the bridge 💙💙💙
Our coach should show the present crop of players this match and let them see what is expected of them in the minimum. See old players still having the skills, movement and grit like we know then for
Legend Persib Bandung, 5 Essien
youtube, can you put a love button next to the like button?
They are even better than current squad who can't score 4 goals
I thought I was Chelsea legends so why we got Gallas 😂 Can we get rid of our current team and put there lot instead
💙💙💙
Zola still Zola
We miss these legends 😮 What if we called them back😮
Tears to me eyes! Didn't even know this was being played. Is there a full version somewhere, all the prematch too ?
Essien and Mikel better than Jorginho NOW!
I've got an absolute tremendous amount of pleasure seeing this guys once again in a lifetime, goodness gracious it's surreal to me given that i watched them winning us games and trophies, the commitment, hunger, tanacity they had is unmatched, Long live Chelsea legends❤🎉
Reminiscing of the time were Chelsea could actually win a trophy 😂😂😂
i miss ramires
Old Memories
The sweetest thing is no one limped off with an injury unlike our hopeless current squad what's really happening with those bums? Injuries left right centre
What an excellent display of soccer
Oh my God i miss our legends.  Essien still got it. It was a pleasure to watch this game. Our legends play extremely well compared to the current Chelsea team
this is our club, not boehli, BLUE IS THE COLOUR
They play better than our current team😂
11:29 looks like the one i did in Barcelona 😁
where is lampard :/
Where is Lampard?
Ramirez it's you
Very entertaining, kudos to both squad
Were is Didier drogba the goal machine of chelsea
❤❤❤
💙💙💙
Crazy how icons that are old play better than a 1 billion pound team, crazy
I Iove this😊
Legend persib ni..hahaha
Essien legend persib ,🥶
"If you don't have a first touch, you won't have a career". That is it folks.
At least somewhere Chelsea is winning.🥲
Mikel touches are master class, great guys, the culture is lost and we need to build a new culture which my take time.
im not even trolling, but apart from the fitness levels this team plays better than our current squad. its so sad...
Genuinely the legends play better than our existing squad & that should tell you everything you need to know! I hope our young squad was in attendance at this game to witness how real spirited players play!
Only cup we raising this season 😭
Essien❤
I hope this bunch of new players are somewhere watching this legends ?
Bring in Gary Cahill on a free transfer! My goodness he's still got it!
Our chelsea legends will be always better than all teams  ohhh fantastic  but those matches should be  organised at in a year twice
Where's Frank Lampard?
They were in no rush at all..just cool, calm, collected football.. Legends 🖤
Gilakkkk 4-0 gak kek chelsea sekarang bauk karbitan amrik, ini baru chelsea, chelsea yang sekarang bauk amis bauk bauk anjing chihua2 gak seperti chelsea dulu mental juara dunia ❤
If robben is there, which team would he play for?
I wish Lampard, Oscar, Didier Drogba and Mata was included in the team as well....😢😢     Mike, Essien, Kalou, Remirez, Cahill, John Terry, Malouda and even Thiago still look very sharp on the Ball....👏👏     John Terry didn't change at all, he is still in shape and still very fit....😂😂😂😂     Honestly I wish there could be a League for Club Legends cos we really need to be seeing this lads once in a while in the pitch....!!!!    I love you all and we the Chelsea fans miss you all so much....!!!!
At least they came and finally broke the curse.  Let's see after the international break what becomes of our current squad.  Congratulations Legends. ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹
Wow this game has exceeded my expectations by soooo much. What a lovely game!
Petition to bring Zola back to the current first team 😂🤣
This is the chelsea we know but i believe this new chelsea team will be back to the top like the good old days
Fantastic performance from our legends! Rest in peace Viali we always gonna remember you!! Once a blue always a blue 💙
better then younger team 😂😂
Some absolute class on display  Terry's smile when scoring for Chelsea again, that pass from Zola shows you never lose it  Terry and Cahill paired together like they never stopped.
❤
I miss these legends
JT, Captain - Legend - leader
legends game better than the current squad fr 💯
GALLAS !! CECH !! ESSIEN !! 💙💙💙
We need to employ Remirez as a set piece coach. He can cross the ball well. Lol
Was there last night was fantastic game and Atmosphere, RIP Vialli 💙
I wish lampard was here
This is so satisfying to watch
Essien my man, my reason of b3coming chelsea fan😂
Just a reminder we are the blues
Fake video timing
Wish us well.
The legends are playing better football than the current squad 😂
God. Current Chelsea squad needs experience. Let's take some of the legends into the squad xd
What a game nice football nice passes nice goals
PERSIB LEGEND VS DORTMUND LEGEND
Legend persib😮 essien
Legends play better than Chelsea players from 2023🤭
Can Chelsea bring this lineup play in EPL this Season?
Better than Chelsea’s current XI imo
Never thought  I would see  ramires with hair and beard
Where is Michael Ballack?
Have not smiled this much for a very long time, have supported this club since the early sixties ,true legends,what a joy.
Notes how their is no back passing and full attacking and the chemistry
Resign Mikel Obi
Ramires#7
I miss you our legends
LEGEND PERSIB INDONESIA
The old ones are better than the new squad chelsea
Obi Mikel has not changed a bit. ❤❤.... The Chelsea we all fell in love with ❤
Two passes from legend Michael essien is true magical with beauty football. We will miss this squad.
This legends team play better than our current team haha
The run and the finish from T. Mendes🔥🙌🏾😎 How i have missed these Legends… Blue legends Forever💙🙌🏾💯
I was in joy watching our legends  What a performance!!! 💖
I love you CHELSEA💙💙 I love this club so much 🥺💙💙💙☺️ C’mon you Blues 💙💙💙💙
Better than our current players
These Chelsea oldies sprinting the entire field and giving classic passes  and finishes 😢
lawan chelsea sekarang, juga menang chelsea legend , niihh ..
Those youngster must learn from our legends 😎
This legends play like the way we expect the current squad to play
One day I will watch one of these with Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, Curtois, Willian, David Luiz, Ngolo Kante and Cesc Fabregas. Then I will know for sure, that I've aged.
But where is the King Didier 👑  ???
This is the Chelsea I want
Njirrrr essien wkwkwk, legend Persib tuh
Abramovich boys are the best
How come Wayne Bridge wasn't in the team? 💀
Michel Essien is legend of Persib Bandung
Essien will always be my best 😪
Wow I love the match.
멋지다!
I love them all
The introduction from the Commentator Ben is beautiful and funny. ❤️😂
To think United were considering buying Ryan Bertrand for a temp replacement. And here he is playing in a Chelsea legends match 😭😭
The atmosphere was electric, the squad was on fire and Vialli chants filled the stadium from the moment everyone was in. Fantastic evening in memory of a true legend.  Highlight 100% seeing Zola smash 2 assists back to back.
Hope our current squad are watching this, this should motivates and inspire them
They should have worn the Samsung kit
This was Chelsea I grew up watching
Florent Malouda. What a player he was for Chelsea, honestly, he doesn't get the praise he's worth. How many times we saw him do this in his career. Him in today's market would be £100-120m. Selfless winger 🙌🏾
Where super Frank?
I want to play Fifa 12, it's much better than Fifa 23. Chelsea wasn't full of useless players.
The squad i watched growing up 🔥
Very moved to see the legends playing again and in contrast to seeing Chelsea's condition now which is under performing. I hope things get better soon, my Chelsea
Terry looks very fit more than all in the game 😂
Luar biasa,,seakan berharap mereka kembali muda dan berkompetisi lagi
Atlast I can see a match where Chelsea wins💙
А сейчас на Челси смотреть больно..
Classic game ❤
The 4th goal was fantastic one
I bet Michael Essien can do a job in the current squad, the guy isn't aging
I read the comments and am surprised,it’s stupid to compare the current Chelsea squad where there are a lot of young,inexperienced and simply raw football players with that legendary squad (one Ballack is older than the same Palmer and Jackson).Give them time like Arteta’s Arsenal,Klopp’s Liverpool and Manchester City Guardiola and I  I assure you that victories and trophies will come to this team.
theres something romantic about seeing those faces that marked my childhood in blue again... loved it 👏👏👏 btw jt, cahill, essien and mikel look sharp af
Absolute joy!!
This is so refreshing to watch. Seeing all these legends bringing back the memories like never before. Great show from our legends.
No way this squad 1000x times better than our current squad 😢
Imagine adding a certain Drogba, Lampard, Ballack and A. Cole to this team!
These legends should replace the current Chelsea squad
Тот момент когда старички играют лучше основной команды.
As a United fan this put a smile on my face. Seeing Cahill play yet again was nice
The players that made us Chelsea fans.well done legends
Meh, Sidemen match was better
Chelsea Team Today should learn alot from this Chelsea Legend how to Build Gameplan and Scoring Goal
Эти легенды играют лучше  чем  нынешний состав наш
Their runs😂😂
Where Lampard????
Let's bring these legends back. We have useless players as of now
I was at the game, great atmosphere for a charity match
How I wish they stay until all our players are back and talk to them individually....we need to see that winning mentality imparted to them.
Why Robben & Duff never participate as Chelsea Legends?
They are better than our squid right now
Watching this just made me hate our current squad so much
Chelsea Legend Squad is better than the Current 1 Billion Squad....😌
Watching this gets me emotional and teary, this Chelsea FC
The team that turned chelsea around
This team should be competing in the EPL rather
I won't lie i miss Roman Abramovich
Legends showed how current squad should play as a team 😢
Zola still got skills
Should the Chelsea Legend step in, improve Chelsea's current situation. Tood should be able to incorporate the Chelsea legend into Chelsea's current management.
😂😂the new chelsea cant beat these chelsea legend
Zola can still bench all the current Chelsea players. They are just thrush
"If you don't have a first touch you won't have a career" Aaam, Lukaku has a career 😂😂😂
JT and many other Chelsea legends still agile asf. Where is Didier Drogba , my double D aka Deadly Drogs
I'm a man United fan buh I must admit these guys made the Premier League worthy.   The true “BLUES” 🔵🔵🔵
This is are really beautiful Chelsea FC
💙💙💙💙💙
I feel real good watching Zola and Thiago...these are the Chelsea we know.....I hope these young once will learn from this
Ada mantan pemain persib   Pura" gk tau aja😂
When I start supporting this club Some of them are Youth players. Now they are Legends. I notice that I'm getting older.  Love you BLUES. KTBFFH!
Jose Mourinho should have been on the bench for this game
None of the current squad turned up to watch!! wonder why???
This  is the Chelsea we miss
Can we get essien out of retirement
Zola still got hit
aku sampai menangis melihat permainan  para legenda..chelsea yang sekarang bermain tanpa mentalitas juara dan tanpa rasa cinta pada klub...😢
We were used to only winning game with these guys😢.
Essien and mikel can still play at the USA
😂this Chelsea legend will beat Chelsea present team😂😂😂
can we use these legends as starting line up
Terry and cahill
Chelsea legends will beat our current team 10- 0
ada legenda persib
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
When I finish to watch this highlight I just cry where my Chelsea now 😭😭😭😭
😊❤ Beautiful Goal from Terry,   Legend Chelsea Powerfull❤
This legendary reunion must've felt so good.. I laughed throught out the game.. Seeing this guy's again brought immeasurable joy to me ❤
Chelsea LEGENDs Better then present squad of chelsea… Pfftt…😢😢😢
Makeleke is still Makeleke, Essien, Mikel, Terry, Ramires's cross, Tiago Mendes, Zola's cut back.....goosebumps all over me
Salomon Kalou was still missing chances 🤣in yesterday’s game. Bro takes pride  in missing chances 🤦🏾‍♂️
Essien at his age now is could play better than current chelsea midfielders. Gone are the days 😢😢
Maybe the owners should just bring this team out of retirement to play our next 2 - 3 seasons or until our current squad develop some ability and drive😅 Bet the millions they have spend so far would've been more then enough to convince these geezers and cover all their potental medical bills down the line😂
Would've been great to see DROGBA
Only time I’ve felt like I can recognise my club💙
Essien my word ❤
THS TEAM MADE ME TO START SUPPORTNG CHELSEA.........NOT THIS CURRENT PLAYERS WHO ARE DOING RUBBISH FAILING TO WIN GAMES.......LOVE YOU❤ J.TERRY AND ALL THE LEGENDS TEAM
Our Legends team wl also Defeat our current Chelsea team
Assisting a potential goal to scoring goal of the night...❤
Time,  time,  but I wish JT never get old just to go on in Chelsea shirt😂
These guys can even win from the youngest squad
22 22 gudjohnsen where ?? kezman where are u, makelele where
These guys can even win from the youngest squad
this team is better than the current Chelsea, they should come and play in the premier league.
Chelsea legends showing our current squad how it should be done.
Bliss 🥲
That chelsea side looked like they still had amazing chemistry, if they were 10 years younger they would absolutely thrash today's chelsea. That Bayern squad only really a few "legends"
Some things never change. Zola with magical assists. Bison with a goal. John Terry with a goal on 26th minute. Hope the current Chelsea squad watched this game and learn how to be more clinical in front of goal because their first touch is similar. 🙏🏿
After watching this, infeel its time for Uefa to introduce The Legends Champions League. Chelsea winning hands down
Lots of joy seeing our legends play.
Bosingwaoù est-il?
Ballack should have been here
These legends made us love Chelsea 💙💙💙big fan since 2003
This is so lovely to watch. Reminds us why we support Chelsea from way back. Seeing all these legends of Chelsea is soothing and refreshing to carry on love 💙
They still got it ❤
The players that made us fans
I cant forget these legends,ramirez terrorised barcelona in ucl semi final,when were 10 man down,that thundershot by essien outside box verses Barcelona only to be cancelled by iniesta in injury time,didier drogba terrorised arsenal in fa cup,goals equal to games,i cant mention all this guys,mikel balanced the midfield,et.c so many players played games like end of life with passion.❤❤❤
Ramies crosses and Essien headers in to the net, i miss the good old days
I hope this current squad watched the legends match
The smile that's on my face while watching these guys play ...wow let's hope we can kick on after the international break
Our current team should play this legendary team I think they can learn something and also for motivation
The current Chelsea team has nothing on these legends 🔥
Oh my God what happened to chelsea 😭
Can we start this team every week?
It’s was amazing ❤ memories ❤❤❤
This real chelsea ❤
I'd geniunely play this lineup over the current one..
The current team should be replaced with these guys
I wonder if there's a club whose legends can beat the blue Team
The king drogba....is legend
💙💙💙💙
These guys should play our next ten games
Better than are current squad
That was a thing of beauty, brought a tear to my eye.
Glory era abramovic 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
JT is 4ever The Blues Capitan
Its sad to see all my favourite player that i watched when i am kid now has a big belly. But its fun to see them having fun again at stamford bridge.
Captain my cuputen
💙💙💙💙💙
Ryan Bertrand can still start for us in the next match and no one would be surprised.
Vialli daughter are so beautiful❤
This is will be the first and last time Chelsea is going to score 4 goals in this season
Hang on why’s 3 being advertised around the ground lol

Amazing!!!! Man I miss them all.
I was smiling ear to ear watching this, all of them legends. RIP Vialli.
Real Chelsea
JT🎉
Blue is the colour    Chelsea our club  Our religion.

Hope they brought blessings to stamford
Rubbish Bayern😢🎉🎉
Our Young players should watch and learn. OMG
Essien legenda persib❤
Thank you legends ❤
We miss all legends.
Hands of Time..Forever blues come rain come sunshine
Goosebumps 🥹🥰😍
Shows you the wealth of talent we had back in the day when even our defenders were making it on the scoresheets.  The current team can't even get a striker to score 😂😂
💙💙💙CHELSEA💙💙💙
Mikel😮😮still balling 💙💙💙🥂🥂🥂
Essien better than caicedo
my childhood 😭 it's nice to see them play again
Good
Good
Wow LEGEND PERSIB
This team are far better than the current one
And the sweetest part is they didn't train before the match and still played well💖💖
Obi Mikel you're playing as if you're 23yrs💪💪 John Terry,cahil,essien,Ramirez 💕💕
Chelsea ada legendnya
their first touch is so comfortable to watch
Essien can still do better than many premier League players
Good skill 🎉
ada mantan pemain PERSIB di gol in pembuka Chelsea FC....
The moments we have been missing. Our current squad need to learn 💙
Let the current players sit down and watch this clip for more than 10 times they will pick something out

These legends can easily Walk into the current first team and win matches effortlessly.!
My role model John Terry with a goal, I think our legends are good pass current team😢
Essian can play 60 minutes all season long.
This team is better at everything than our current squad. Just give them legs and physicality they will win the ucl
Peter Cech santai dulu gk sih
Wow scrap our billion pound squad bring some of these players back essien, John obi, terry, Cech even malouda and kalou bring them back
Where is Drogba
i wish i could see roman in the stadium bench
Chelsea legends 🎁🎁🎁
Better than the first team.
This team would beat the current first team
Legend always be legend
If Chelsea wanna win something this year this is the team they got to use
Wana see legends play against our team now & teach them few lessons. Brought 😢 to my eye & thanks legends for great yrs. Zola my fave player & noi ti amo vialli 🇮🇹
Mikel Obi still looks 18 on the pitch.
Chelsea fans need this legend game to give them hope for their consistent losses 😅😅😅
Feels like the only trophy this season 😂😂😂
The current Chelsea team lacks this brotherhood..do you see the brotherhood....that has been the secret to Chelsea's success..
These legends play better than the current players, current one's love salon more than football 😢😢 sad
❤ Essien still got it 💯
True legends ....Captain Terry....
This is chelsea who we know
Legends are better than the current team, seat around table guys and give them notice other wise ..kalue come back, Remi come back
Mikel better than all Chelsea current midfielders
Better than today's squad ! by a MILE !
The real Chelsea FC, the squad and manager
they should replace the current squad..they playing more better ...this legends never get old..Ramires Essien..Malouda memories⚽💙
Where is Lampard?
Why did Drogba not play?
I used to have Essien 5 on my jersey!! Where is King Didier?
Zola and Di Mateo were the first players to make me fall in love with Chelsea.
They should be the one playing in the 1st eleven of Chelsea in the EPL now 🎉
Our zola
Mourinho can win a premier league with this Chelsea side
Makélélé and Essien 🔥🔥🔥
This chelsea team can still replace their current team
September 9 is my birthday & as a Chelsea fan seeing my favorite winning by a such big margin against big team like Bayern  made my day Chelsea's win really made my birthday happy. Although it was not intended but it's the best surprise gift ever!!!
PETR CECH MY GOALKEEPER!!!! HAVE HIM IN MY FIFA MOBILE TEAM AND HES A BEAST.
Why drogba is not in the game
Atleast Previous players are performing well 😂😂😂
How old is gallas playing like a young guy
This makes me happy so much, relief me of all the pains the present team is causing, love you Chelsea❤❤❤
Please bring some of them back.the are better than the present Chelsea team
Essien legend persib🎉
good job blues
John Terry scored at the 26 minutes 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😮
Essien PERSIB legend
Tears in my eyes. This takes me back to my childhood and teenage years.
This team swapped to current team
Ramires used to be one of my favorite players at Chelsea
More of this please 😢😢😢😢😢
Frank lampard no play
No Lampard sad
😢😢
werss drrogba end lampard
These legends had will to play for the badge
Mikel was superb with passing..... Zola added more sauce 😁..... Glad to watch Essein again aftee many years
Back in the day when we knew we were going to win the game.
Never thought Id say this but... We need John Obi Mikel back in the squad
This game was more entertaining than Chelsea's game this season
These legends know how to score
The Chelsea we know and love 😢 this Chelsea current team is rubbish. They need to learn one or two from our legends
ดูแล้วมีความสุขกว่าชุดปัจจุบัน 🥹
Where is drogba
what a club
Malouda..kalou..essien..still ok
Jt and cahill still young 😂
Honestly i still feel like these men play football together somewhere we don't know because the chemistry is something else...MY GOODNESS 😮
Wish these young lads could learn from these idols, true legends never die, R.I. P to the ones we lost. Good to see Kalou, Ramirez throwing that beautiful assist pass, Makalele, Gary scoring beautifully too, Essien with that powerful header, Zola the legend himself and oh Mikel Obi, our Obi, wow! Seeing Tiago Mendez, My legendary captain John Terry and Petr Czech and the best coach Di Mateo. Beautiful. And they played beautifully well, they need to come show these young Chelsea how to really use the counter, cos they seem not to know how to use it to their own advantage at all. But what happened? Didn't see Didier Drogba, Gudjohnsen, e.t.c
เหล่าตำนานทั้งนั้น สุดยอด
never dissapoints
Chelsea forever 💙
Mudryk has left the group😅
Persib legend
This must squad this season
They don't play like they are on retirement
Bagusan pemain tua era dulu,dari pada pemain era sekarang 😢
Pride and winning mentality. Proper chelsea
Absolutely awesome, so many great players. Thank you ❤
More entertaining than the current squad
I hope Todd Boehly is watching
I love jt
at their age and they have not lost the touch🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whats the name of the last song?
bruh, let this team play in the first team
Tears in my eyes seeing these legends back at Stamford Bridge 🥹💙
That Drogba-esque header by Essien ❤
i wasn’t old enough to watch them play in person when they did, but going to the game and seeing chelsea legends, especially terry and essien score was amazing 💙 atmosphere was incredible too, and just shows they never lost that class 🤩
Michael essien persib bandung legends respect from indonesia
🇩🇪?
Let this Chelsea legends team replace the current one😂
The calmness, composure, passion, efficiency, accuracy among other qualities from these players made me shade tears of Joy. What a nostalgia. I am a Chelsea fan and will always be till I die because of these players. I love you all. I miss our team. The team we were confident of winning any match not only in England but Europe. The only time we could lose with this team were when robbed by match officials 😢😢😢😢
Kalou always missing big chances till date?😅 Good game from our legends and i hope some of the current team players were there.
The current chelsea squad must watch this game and learn from it 👌
That was fun😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💙💙💙💙
It brings tears 😭 to my eyes. I wish they could come back to the bridge. These are the reasons why many Chelsea fans are still a Chelsea fan. I miss you all ☝️
Knp g Roberto di Matteo aj plth skrng??? 😢😢 Sedih lihat perfoma chelsea skrng...
Where’s Ballack
where is the liver Drogba?
Dear M. Essien. Would you please come to PERSIB FC INDONESIA LEAGUE again, hehe
The legends are better than the current boys
Zola still 😮
Oh my lovely Chelsea
Who remembers Tiago's goal vs Man Utd?
GO CHELS! Love the legends, hope they had fun ;)
Proud days 💙
Name music
Didier Drogba where are you?❤
We should have legends league
Man, I miss these guys' 💙
Absolutely beautiful.  CFC4LIFE&BEYOND💙..
น่าจะเอาป๋าแลมกับ Drogba มา คิดถึงมากก🦁💙
Tukang babak rumput persib ngegolin
John Terry and Gary Cahill combo still bang two goals together compare to our attackers... What a beautiful game from these Legends💙
Could this go to our points please 😂
Oh how i've missed this chelsea....simple and efficient
If these  guys represent us in the Premier league this season, the may, just maybe we'll play in Europe next year...  At the Conference League
Thank you legends for wiping all the pains these new generation of players having been inflicting on the club with no wins. This is what we represent, winning mentality!!! These legends can't be forgotten in our heart.
They are better than the current squad now. Make them come back 🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
At least we had goals at SB 😅💙
Indeed legends of chelsea ❤ Ibrahamovic era🎉🎉
RIP luca 😭!!!!!!!!!!   Once a blue 🔵 who respected their peers always a blue 💙
lampard?
❤❤ Chelsea
Now these no reason why we shouldn't be winning goal these men played like they have been playing for years
Where was drogba
I`d rather pay to watch the Chelsea Legends games than the Chelsea team now
i feel bad for munchen 😅
Even the risk JT took to score that goal no Chelsea current squad will take that bold step.
We could use mikel, makelele and essien rn even with their current age
Fair play to Gary Cahill and Florent Malouda, who played 2 games in the space of just 4 days! Says a lot, especially about Gary, who is still so fit!
Great game, great personalities ❤
Missing ❤
Broooo❤ Current Chelsea can't play this way😢
why not  *EDEN HAZARD*
Michael essien persib bandung legend
Please post the full video. 🙏🏻 Chelsea fc
Omoh our legend play better than the current Chelsea squad

Omoh our legend play better than the current Chelsea squad
Ramirez!!! things really change faster.
Michael Essien as Persib Bandung legends 😅 hehe
the only chelsea match that give me smile in 2023
Drogba where?
Ain't Bayern legends way older than the Chelse  legends?
Beautiful memories never die 🎉.
i wish we had a league for under 45s...ages between say 35 - 45?
Andalan di PS2: Cech, Terry, Carvalho, Ferreira, Cole, Mikel, Lampard, Ballack, Cole, Drogba, Anelka
😭 wow.
I cried
Long time I don't enjoy my team player..I really enjoyed this game this is the Chelsea fc I fall in love with
11:29 Ramirez telling Kalou how to loop😅😅
These legends are leaders of men
This Chelsea team is on fire...mehn💕
Are clubs legends are unbeatable 🤷‍♂️
Chelsea Legend 5-0 current Chelsea
ESSIEN PERSIB NU AING
Ramires has hair
Super cool Carlo, "I knew that wasn't going in" !
These Starting 11 is way much better than our Current starting 11.
this game is missin didier n lampard n balack
The current squad should learn from these legends..
once a blue will always be a blue
Should do this again with 2017 players so we can see hazard 1 last time
How Caicedo how it's done
The chelsea boys should learn from this match individual brilliance
Pleas comeback and play for chelsea
Essien persib legend
Best game of the season so far
I swear this squared is better than the current ones
This is beautiful❤😂
Legend persib
Current squad need to watch this
Watching them play now reminds me of CHELSEA back in the day. Achievements.  Every time I think about the trophies, I tear up.  It is the same as the current CHELSEA team.
Bohdley getting estimates on the length of contract he can give he guy I hope 😂😅
Let's continue with this word in premier League the old man who is playing like young age I love great squad of all time🎉😮
Thiego  goal  has brought memories  the goal  Remires scored against Barcelona 🎉
They can still play pro football😅
Keep the blue flag flaying high💙
MIKEL is always making a Decisive first Touch
John obi mikel, he is a good passer like Iniesta and Xavi
Hope Poc and the boys are watching
They're still good and pleasing than the current team. The new team have to improve by taking a challenge from this amazing guys
Would love to see Zola & Hazard playing in Chelsea's Legend team in the future.
Where was drogba
One or two of this players should surely come out of retirement and help the current squad that's only wobbling on the field of play and not scoring goals!
Legendnya bagus yng inti taik lah kalaj trus
Essien-Makalele-kante class of midfielder
The game is full of systems, full of happiness. 🎉👏😊👍💪
could easily beat the current squad I'm not even joking
И слезы и улыбка как будто с пацанами со двора которых лет 20 не видел поиграл😊
You can take them away from Football, but you can't take football away from them  It is a shame that this our legends still got the shredness of 10 11 years ago  And they still play better than the current Chelsea squad.  Weldone Legend Xi
This game tells you how good chelsea was
That fire is stil there between them!! 💙💙💙 Put them in the league and still at this age they will win you matches what the hoodly doodly current squad cannot.
Where was Lampard and Drogba? 😔
Can we play our legends next week against Bournemouth please? We’d like to win a game 😅
This is the Chelsea I know. Even when though they are retired they don’t accept loosing especially not at the Bridge. The current squad could really learn a lot from them! Wonderful👏🏾👏🏾💙💙
When legends play better than current chelsea's team
Can we have them replace the current squad. Todd do something
😂
Hence proves legends are worthy than current Chelsea aquad❤
Hope the kids were watching....It could just spark them back to life!!
Terry Has scores in every year, He has played football
Tears in my eyes 😢😢😊
Zola is a legend .....
It's more fun to watch the legends than the current football team.
Malouda now better than Mudryk :v
Lamps was missed
we miss them,
Our Legend can beat our current squad bitterly 😂
We should maintain this team for this season. At least they can win against West Ham and Forest😂
Legend skuad better than our pocetino skuad
Goosebumps....this was the Chelsea we grew up supporting. The Chelsea spirit diminished over the years.
This is The TRUE CHELSEA FC
Chelsea is truly rubbish, and must be carried by their Legend 😂
Where is arjen robben and ribbery
Bayern barely had any legends out there.
At least we’re winning somewhere
Ramires is so heavy
Biarkan meraka membuktikan kalo chlesea team terbaik💙💙💙
Man we've had some legendary players at this club and this is only 1/3 of them. So many more.
Congrats to our legends,, they still play very well irrespective of their age, they even play more better than our current. Kudos to them 👍. RIP to Gianluca Vialli
Mudryk would have missed the last goal. Such a lazy player after watching Ukraine’s game yesterday.
The most connected to a “Chelsea team” I have felt for many many years. Such a fantastic night at Stamford Bridge - the current bunch of players could learn so much from watching this!
The first goal by Essien is better than the strike he scored against Barcelona in the Champions league!
This match nearly brought tears to my eyes. It was so emotional for me and i laughed as well.   Thank you legends, forever is the love. But still, Mikel is still one of the most underrated Chelsea legend we had, man still have it in him.
Take away pace, and trust me, these legends will beat our current squad.... look at the loob from Essien....❤😊
I want to see Drogba in the next LOE game
It's not classic chelsea if neither cahill or terry didn't score.
이제 첼시만 잘하면 된다 ㅋㅋ
Essian ❤❤❤ My Ghanaian bug
I mean, u could see this once r pure breed blues. Not the once we hv now
Kalou can't stop missing goals
My heroes still love you to the fullest ❤
Big team😊😊😊
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Why is Lampard not invited?😢
Better than this current Chelsea team
Now thats what i call The Blues CHELSEA.  that old guys play way better
Just one word: Fantastic!
We really are blessed to have had such great players wear the blue shirt. I hope it’s not too long before we see such greatness agin💙🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆.
I hope the curse on this current squad is removed by the legends 😂😂
Wash away Chelsea curse😊👻
Real aku rindu chelsea yg padu mcm dulu.. Skrng semuanya hebat tapi mereka masih belum kenal antara satu sama lain.. Bermain untuk pasukan dan memang bersama-sama
smiling for the whole 13:46 minutes
Покажите игру ,нынешнему составу

Essien legends our persib to 🤝
Man I miss this team😅😢😢😢
The way I'm smiling looking at this🥹❤️ This is what you call passion! These dudes are proud of the badge. Not the current Chelsea team 🤦‍♂️
Tears in our eyes to see them play. Current Chelsea should learn from them.
11:52 Lukaku disagrees 😂
Mikel Obi👌
I am in tears 😭😭😭 watching our gorgeous LEGENDARY playing they good football ⚽ ..... Our new current CHELSEA FOOTBALL SQUARE should learn from our LEGENDARY today henceforth 🥇🥇🥇🏆🏆🏆💙💙💙💯
Ini  Chelsea yang saya kenal

I will forever be blue cos dis legend have repaint my heart blue again  especially our african legend on the pitch like mikel,essien,kalouand so on i will forever be proud to be chelsea fan cos blue is d colour and football is d game.

zola😅😅😅
where is Didier Drogba
Scuat lgend blues
No drogba🥹
🙌🙌🙌супер
This brings back old memories❤  But Ruud Gullit is missing from these legends.
The reason why These legends are call legends and dominated in their prime❤️😊current squad shame on u
Can we have some of  these guys in the management of the club. They understand Chelsea better I think. That winning mentality runs in their body
Organize more of these matches, it seems the legends are giving more effort even at friendlies rather than the 1st team. More joy watching them. Never fail to put a smile on the fans face.
tha5 essien header was superb, the way he direct it midair with so much power and precision. we havrnt had that in years
This is my Chelsea i love much before imotional tears in my eyes
Why JT reaction to shoot still better then Nico Jackson? 😢
Aah Drogba didn’t play ? And Lampard
This legends are far more better than our current crop of players, super proud of them🎉❤
Beautiful football from the legends ❤
This has been an absolutely pleasure
This our legends is good than our current team koraa ooo
Seeing all blues legends it brings tear to my eye. 😢
Our Legends
Football will never leave these legends. Very funny.  Fact is, goal opportunities waster will always be a goal waster. Kalou still wasting goals.
Something for our current young posers to learn from then....
As if all of them should come back again. I miss the john Terry era. He is a captain indeed even in the mist of all this senior players he carries himself like a captain
I miss this my Chelsea Team 😢
Aya mamang Essien
Pierluigi Casiraghi would have wanted to play in this game too.
Legend Persib lebih sangar drpd Caicedo
this team must be play in premier league now😂
Can these guys come and play for Chelsea again 😮
9:35 and that’s gianfranco zola lalalalalala
Streets from Desire is a song used by Sassuolo.
legend PERSIB anyiing 😂
In their youth they were tearing the league apart with Drogba leading the lines. I miss the old days. What a delight to watch this video. Thank you. I am a massive Liverpool fan but seeing the legends of the game still playing so much better it makes me tear up.
Drogba and Lampard. You guys were missed
Not forgetting my man Gianluca Vialli RIP pal ❤😢
Our current midfielders don't know sh*t.. Gone are the days we didn't rely on strikers solely for goals..Cos goals could come from all angles just like this game..
Drogba lampard ballack ash cole j cole carvalho robben hazard ivanovic so many missing but no problem it was great to see these true legends 💙💙💙🔵💙🔵👏👏
Wey need hazard
With what Kante has done to this club can't wait to see him  back to the bridge in the near future
Great Blues Legends ❤. Wonderful display. Viali well honored.
THE NEW CHELSEA TEAM SHOULD SEE THIS AND GET TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN MESSING THINGS UP
The truth is some this players with match practice can get into our team and perform better than the present players!!
Good to see these guys on the pitch again. Rest in peace Vialli.
Greatful
I would like the current team to do what the legends have done
My god , every first team player now at Chelsea should be made to watch this every day , simply wow ! God have I missed that type of magic , this was not just football , don’t laugh I nearly came in my pants that was simply MAGIC
Thats my man Gianfranco Zola 😊
I feel like crying watching this, chelsea has lost its way. This men remind me of so many good memories 😞
Essien Persib Legend 🩵
Wow what a lovely game to refresh my mind of good memories of Chelsea, Chelsea 4 life
Much better than the present team ❤
Miss you all guys
That Tiago Mendes goal was a beauty to watch. He saw the space and he started the 1-2-3 pass with a brilliantly timed run, crisiping it with a goal. Lovely...
I cried
we need these legends behind the coaching of our chelsea please
We love you our legends 💙💙
I miss these days
Miccael Essien legend Persib Bandung
Chelsea now < old Chelsea
Can the legends play our squad
Jackson could have missed that Terry goal
Some of these guys need to come back and show our first team a thing or two
Essien is truly a legend
Terry rolling back the years
Thank you legends….it’s a great feeling to feel like a Chelsea fan ❤
램파드랑드록바가없어ㅠㅠ
You can feel the chelsea soul in this team. The current team is soulless
This is Chelsea.
🥇🥇🥇🏆🏆🏆💙💙💙💯
Just imagine if a retired players league can be started.
Legends
If you asked me this is the best Chelsea has ever had. If you agree like this post
Wished Drogba played
Better than current team 💔
These guys are proper Chels, something these current over paid players will never be. Would have loved to see Anelka, Drogba and Lampard wear the shirt and play at the bridge again. RIP Vialli
It was to nice to see players i watched growing up in the early 2000s. Seeing those from the 2010s and even others I've only seen in clips. It's made my day. Thank you for the memories new and old.
Satisfying to watch the old Chelsea. The new ones are just fakes 😂... No guts no glory
Made in Rusian
Legends is better for Chelsea 😂
It’s scary seeing how slow they’ve got… but not, do they still have the quality 😎  So happy to see the old boys back
Kerenlah para legend dari pada yg skrang 😂
Wow !
They are far better than that of Chelsea's current team !!
Can Chelsea recruit back some of them?
We're lucky Hazard is not included😅😂
Salute the legends! Zola still the maestro 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
เล่นมีทรงกว่ายุคปัจจุบันเยอะเลย
Where is drogba
Good memories we love you guys... Your era was better than now. The football had taste due to hightech skills. Nice match
better than this team 😭💀
why chelsea legends squad looks stronger than official 🤣🤣
Esien player Persib Bandung 2017
Memorize of champions league final 2012 ❤❤
The are playing better than the current players
Mikel would easily start in Chelsea's current squad.
Hazard should have been here
PLZ, LEGEND PLAY FOR PREMIER LEAGUE !!
They are still looking like they could still represent us for the 23/24 premier league season , wow !! 😮🤔⚽💙👌🏾👍🏾
Mamang Essien Legend Persib euy😂😂
Manaa Lampard, Drogba, Ballack
Our legend are far better than our current team players
They beat our squad for sure we will never have this kind of players ever just sad
I miss Drogba here
How inwish the men were still boys ...
Just shows how the standards have fallen at Chelsea. These legends were proper players.
No coach no huge spending and yet superb farmance,  the chelsea we all grew up watching. ❤
Better then new Chelsea 😂😂
Emotional ❤
Is it not better to bring them back  The current teams are not better
The current team doesn't have the passion these men had. When Terry scored I shed a tear, what a legend. The government forcing Abramovitch to sell was robbery BS politics. And we got bought by a much inferior man. Tell me, in all the years Abramovitch was in charge, how many sit down interviews did you see? Todd is worried about his investment, talking to the players, sacking a top Manager on the basis that "we want to break the wall".  Roman once asked Jose, "Drogba for the striker? Who?"  José said "Mr Abramovitch Pay and don't speak"  He was the manager. And that's why we had success for 20 years.
Legenda Persib cetak goal
that is the problem right now and the squad is like a headless chicken when attacking right now.
Abramovich karma
I think Premier League should start a Legends Cup competition. It will cook!
My team 💙💙💙💙
Legend should be play for us again 😢
Bring the legends back to replace the current team.
These legends of Chelsea FC can easily beat the current Chelsea FC. I love them. Roberto Di Matteo and Roman Abramobic.
เก่งกว่ายุคนี้เยอะ
Striker like drogba is needed right now and i respect johnson but he is not physically intimidating as drogba and finishind is lacking
ฟิตจริงพี่บ่าวเอสเซียง
I hope our young players will see how passionate these legends are playing with a lot of passion
This man thiago always look more younger
This was nostalgic. I miss these great men on the pitch. Mikel was suchba delight to watch.  Thank you Chelsea legend for bringing back the sweet memories.  Blue love💙💙💙
Bayern never stood a chance against that lineup 🔥
These old guys are playing more better than the current chelsea team
Essien is Persib Bandung Legend too 😂
Zola🤯😊😊😊😊 Cahil didn't want to hurt the keeper😂😂
Essien is still phenomenal! What a great play from our Legends🔥
Essien making those forward runs after retirement in a friendly match, the mentality and passion for the club is miles above than our current squad.
Chelsea Legend should Play our next 10 games
Our legends still gat the class
Where is the one man striker: Didier Drogba 🤔
Some of these chelsea legend could still play in Saudi
Bayern lacked : robben , ribery , mario gomez ....
Although some players are missing, the squad is still better than the current one
🦁💙🤟🏻
Masih terlihat sangat bagus...❤dari squad saat ini...
โคตรมีความสุขเลยครับ❤
I think these Legends should come out of retirement and replace our current senior team, they still have it in them… 💙 R.I.P to our Legend Luca 🇮🇹 🫶
😊😊😊
Essien 🔥❤️🔥🔥
Essian Doing what Enzo n Caicedo combined should be doing
Brings tears to my eyes ?
Our current squad could never 😢
They do play better than our team rn hahahaha fml
This is the Chrlsea I know. I hope the current hip-hop artists are watching how real men play ball.
Felt like this match never ended.... Miss these legendary players.... Lampard, Cole & Drogba missing
Is it just me or do our legends play better than our current team even with their age
This is how current Chelsea should be playing like.... Great synergy and creativity
The legends are much fit than the current squad😢🤣
Hope the current squad was there to watch and learn
Please we need more of this as chelsea fans
What A Legend Respect For Them
Nice seeing them again, playing like old grampas' 😂 how adorable
I didn’t regret the $7, loved every second of it. An absolute pleasure to watch these legends once again. They made me fall in love with this club 💙
Missing these face already
These players are what makes you love your club! They are magic! Disappointed no lampard!
It's beatifull game,, amazing legend , bravo Chelsea💪😇💯
Very happy to see all these legends back at the Bridge. They rolled back the years......man! RIP Gianluca Vialli 🙏
They'll beat the YT All Stars 10:0 😅
🎉 Wow mantan pemain Persib, Michael Essien cetak gol pertama coy~
Jhon terry goals in Stamford Bridge 2023 : 1 mudryk :0
I think they should ask for friendly with the current Chelsea
This kids gotta learn from this legends
Chelsea is back ❤
Ambil contoh pemain muda chelsea, yang tua aja ada semangat nya buat gol, motivasi buat pemain muda chelsea yang sekarang
As a South Korean John Obi Mikel is a legend in South Korea! He is the Scientist of football!
This Chelsea team looks more fit than current team
was Mikel ahead of his time?? Dude was dictating play, agile, shimmies, passes...he could start next week and show them levels
This chelsea team can actually compete in the premier league 😊, they play good and compact football. Legends for real
legend is legend🔥❤️
Oliver Kahn, sebastian scheinteiger, van bronkhost, gomez, robben should play to make the game balanced
Best squad ever🌹
We need this team on the 15th

То чувство, когда Легенды Челси играют гораздо лучше, чем нынешняя команда тинейджеров
Chelsea legends could replace the current team
Whom is the coach
The current Chelsea team needs to watch these clip on repeat!
Old Terry and Essien is much better than prime Disasi and Caicedo bruh
Reverse the scoreline when the current teams are playing.
Look at present​😂
they play better than our current team wow
JT is still captain. fantastic
Mang Essien mantap
Chelsea's strength has always been our midfield, with the likes of , makelele,  essien, mikel,,Ballack,  ramirez,,e.t.c, this current chelsea squad, need to do something about the midfield.
They have better touches than the current team. Nicolas Jackson should watch this and learn.
Malouda, Essien and Mikel play like they never stopped.
Mang essien masih keren aja😍
I miss Dedier Drogba 😢😢😢😢
Current Chelsea team must watch this game
Persib Indonesia legend : Michael Essien 😊
Better than current team 😂
Michael Essien Legend persib
Chelsea's black army always fantastic
Hope this game teaches current players what it means to play for Chelsea, packed stadium for a legends game full Mathew Harding stand singing for some of our players 20 years after they played for us. We look after our own.
Pingin liat performa chelsea FC saat ini , seperti pemain legendaris chelsea FC yg dulu😢
Essien play better than Caisedo

This were real Chelsea
Whao! Whao!! Whao!!! Giafrancisco Zola. Thiago Mendes, Makalele and rest of the superstars here to mention a few and those not there. It amazing that these great players had play for Chelsea. Todd has spend a lot, but we want the regen of these old talents back. Adieu Christian Viali, a coach, captain and legend.
Our current players need to watch these lads play!
Mantan Persib Michael Essien...
This team has better cohesion than our current squad. they know each others strengths and weaknessess.
So can we count that trophy as the only trophy we gave worn  this season
😮pemain Persib legen
Football  never change , essien obi 🔥
Chelsea legends are too young😅😂
I miss my chelsea man this new school are weak and soft .
Where is Drogba?
Bro this Chelsea team is better then this right now
atleast somewhere Chelsea are winning.
Legend!!
Cahill😍
This squad could beat sterling cs 3-0
That was the team that made Chelsea proud am happy watching them 😀😀😀 THE GOATS of London
Legends will smash our current team lool
Where is Lampard?😢
Get them to the first team they are better than the current ones 😂
Essien is blues, essien is persib hahaha
Drogba? 😢
What’s that song at the end?
Gimana kalau di jadikan skuad chelsea musim ini..
Legends playing it better than the young dredlock masters 😂
There should be legends cup
Essien's assist to Mendes is goated
This team will beat our current Chelsea squad.
Great memories 😊❤
Seriously our current squad need to look at this game and take as inspiration
NJIIR LEJEN ENCIB CETAK GOL😂 😅
Obi Mikel
We really make them remember 2012❤😂😂😂
Essien is Persib Bandung Legend. 💙
I became a chelsea fan, the day mourinho signed mikel for chelsea, since then , it has been chelsea all the way
These legends need to visit Cobham regularly to show these kids we bought what it means to be a BLUES player
Best skuad... Rindu roman Abramovich
Feel good❤ for this Legends...they are so fit than our current squad😂
Where is Drogba?
Lionel Messi still plays active football while Mikel plays charity football. What a shame
I haven’t smiled this much in a minute man 😊
We need the old Chelsea
Tremendous amounts of Nostalgia watching the game… RIP Gianluca Vialli💙
Essien header was better than the whole current squad
Zola❤Terry❤Essien❤Leboef
Our old players know the culture we hardly lose at home but our young squad like that mentality. From that first kick to start the match I was just smilling till the final whistle, I knew John Terry will score. The last goal from Tiago was a beauty
Eden Hazard will be here one day
Makelele still the best number 6 in the world
My own Legend that makes me fall in love with Chelsea did not even play we could have win 10 goals to 0😂 one love DD 11
who will be in the legends game in 20 years time, a bunch of africans from this squad lmao, we're going down boys enjoy the ride
เก่งกว่านักเตะตอนนี้เยอะ
ESSIEN LEGEND PERSIB BANDUNG INDONESIA👍
Lana del ray?
Where's drogba
Hope we get back our Chelsea just like these legends played, hope to see our current Chelsea win more 💙
Blue is THE Color
beautiful ,just imagining how the score line could be with drogba
Love them to see  Miss legend guys
This is Chelsea not what plays now
My club ❤️
Nice to see the true Chelsea spirit after a long while
PERSIB VS BAYERN
현역들보다 골결이 더 좋네
Terry has his eyes on those chicks
We need uefa legends league. So impressive to watch this
Chelsea hiện tại mà thắng Bayern 4 trái như này thì hay biết mấy
Im crying😂😊😊😊
How did Jon Obi Mikel retired from football?
We must make our current team watch this Highlight again and again. If fact,  It should be a must watch, so that they will know why they play for Chelsea FC.
Essien colek Persib ... Senggol dong 😂
Hope the Chelsea current squad are watching this
John fcking Terry❤
Hope the boys watched and understood what it means to wear a Chelsea shirt..because they seem to not understand what it means
I hope our current players re watching the game
Damn that old guy with white beard looks like a monster back in his days
This  who Chelsea should played
Chelsea we need this squad for premier league this season so far
We need Mikel in our midfield ASAP
Look at that passing Obi gave kalu sterling can never release that pass
Where is drogba ?
This chelsea team is far better than current Chelsea
I think we should recruit some of the players again into the squad
better than current squad
Chelsea legend and current chelsea not same
These guys made me fall in love with Chelsea....
Thank you for everything Legend 💙
Chelsea 2012 the best
They say old is gold 😮
Zola's muscle memory 🔥🔥🔥
Mikel performance was Superb kudos to you  Chelsea for life 💙
I must say this old time Chelsea was superb. Terry❤
This is great, the spirits of winning will be elevated at the bridge
No Lampard and drogba
Ada legend persib cuyy
These chelsea legend team are far more better than the current chelsea team😂😂
Where is torres and drogba.
❤
Just watched thrice and remembered 2012
I miss this Chelsea team😢they played with their heart during their time
The young lot should watch these and learn about how it is to be elite level players, the dedication it takes.
Let use this team this season!
Watching Chelsea Legends play makes me want to cry😢 This is the Chelsea we know, cause honestly I'm watching Chelsea these days and can't figure out how all these mindless players arrived at Stamford Bridge😢
Amazing 🎉
😂😂nice my legends once blue you become blue.
This is the first post I clicked like this year.
No Robben, Ribery, Lahm, Schweinstiger, Van Bommel, Madzukic etc. game could’ve been a lot different with the right Bayern team. This is barely a team.
How is Casiraghi a Chelsea legend?
Essien, yeaah, he is PERSIB Bandung Legend
Black remains the strength of Chelsea❤
This is our chelsea ❤❤
Si mamang essien ngagoll ken😂
Thiago wow ❤❤
bring them back
I hope the boys watch this match
Our legends are amazing, but the teams now are really bad
Where drogba? 🥺😢
awesome 🤩
essien legend of persib💙💙
Yoo ayoo ayo persib bandung.... Semangt Essien cetak gol sebanyak mungkin. Majuuuuuu!!!
I'm Remember last time
Hello
Chelsea should resign Cahill and Mikel...wat a great team can't stop watching...❤
The only game where Mikel didnt do "we're close for business" thing . Still superb..
This whole squad walks right into our starting eleven without question.
Why the fans in the bridge was booing  Zola ?
it is like they are still playing together all this time..
What's the name of the song being played toward the end of the video?
Bring this legends back to play for chelsea leave about those rustervalians
Boys will be Boys💙💯
Zola . Mikel, Essien what a Player.. 😊😊😊😊
Malouda great guy
They're direct and got plans for goal and technically awareness still 💯
They just set the standard for this current Chelsea squad
They look beta Dan de first team
Legend persib cetak goal 😂
Are you uploading classic matches to mask your recent results?
We all cried😭❤️🫶
Ramirez great guy that cross was massive
Mereka pensiun terlalu cepat 😅
these legends understood the meaning of wearing a chelsea badge unlike these 1b kids we hae that keep playing rubbish
No preseason 😂 Not Much training but a trophy in the bag😂😂😂   Makes me jealous
Men they are the real legend imagine the year they have played together last, coming together nw they the real football I hope those young star are watching this nw
Missed those days
Cahill cool guy
Kasih contoh cara main yang benar kepada pemain chelsea Sekarang.
The current crop of players should be forced to watch these and learn what it means to play for the badge and entertain funs.
First goal legen Persib Bandung 😁
lengend is better than,,😄😃😃😀
Can you Michael Essien massive header
This Chelsea team is better than the current first team
Where is drogba, lampard?   Who sees that Mikel is still intact even more than this new guys.  This was a sweet time. 😂
It's great watching these Legends. 😊
I saw the Chelsea squad and I knew the game was over before it even started. The former folks haven't lost the touch❤️
Lampard🥲
De goey, cudicini, Melchiot, lebouf, babayaro, desailly, poyet, le saux, di matteo, terry, zola, hasselbaink, gudjohnsen, morris adalah masa2 squad pertama kali mencintai chelsea fc sampai sekarang..
Chelsea should bring back these legends to play for us o
What is going with Ramirez?he stop working gim?that is not good bro
0:48 whats the name of these two gals. Asking for a friend 👀
Mikel obi is still calm and cook on the ball👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why not play this squand against the current Chelsea team. It'll be interesting 😅
Vialli ,Zola et al gave me moments in my life which are indelibly printed in my memory bank. I'm smiling when I think back. What players we had. What teams we had. Fantastic.
Give us Arsenal legends 🤣v
After a long time, something to cheer for Chelsea fans!!
ITS amazing,fantastic😄👍
Para legenda ini bermain lebih baik dari tim sekarang.
Mikel still looks sharp. The entertainment was huge. Missed most of these legends
Still better than chelsea current squad😂😂
Are we ever going to have players who will play for us with passion and love for the club?
Current Chelsea playar need to learn how to play for a Chelsea club
I had a giant smile on my face watching this, and that ZOLA Scoop pass..I thought i was college watching it for the 1st time.
Believe it or not, this team is definitely better than Mauricio Pochettino's squad.
ดูแล้วน้ำตาจะไหล ซึงใจสุดตำนานเล่นกันแบบมีคลาสสุดมาก 💙💙💙
Oh super chelsea 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The only Chelsea team that is winning
RIP Luca ❤
I love Chelsea 💙✌️Til I Die
I really miss maloudas dribbles
Wow
Best chelsea performance weve seen at the Bridge in the last 2 seasons😂
Add on Drogba and Lampard and we shall have the 2000s-2010s OG squad reunion. Maybe in future.
No Didier tho.   Nice to see essien n Ramirez
I hope these small small pikininis have learnt a lesson from the legends. Please stop wasting our time start defending and scoring goals as you have seen. By the way don't copy what Kalou did there.
I think John Terry can still play for Chelsea Squad right now, anyway these legends playing a lot better than Chelsea squad right now
This legend chelsea better than current chelsea i think 😅
💙❤
Love You, all the Legends. Miss You, all the Legends. Wish you all the best!
kok bisa ada pemain persib baandung?
So refreshing to see our legends back at the bridge. That pass from Essien ❤❤❤. Essien could still play in our midfield and put in a shift.
Hope the boys take a lesson from this match.
The real Chelsea
There’s my Chelsea Team!!! Guess they were just hiding 😏🤣💙
Obi Mikel
Cool team..
Gallas 🔥
The current players could take notes about having a sense of pride playing at the Bridge. Ngl I was hoping to see Drogba grace the pitch
Seeing Terry score made me tear up haha miss the legend
This made me so happy tho.... Emotional type stuff
Better than Chelsea team now🤣 fun fact
i am fan chelsea from vietnam
Gary Cahill my goat
🥹🥹🥹🥹
Where is Lampard?😢
Put the intelligence and mentality of the legends team in the bodies of the current team and we will rule the prem
Bluze Brothuz Rollin!
I was just smiling all through 😊. Love you 💙 Blues.
old but gold
Легенды 🎉🎉🎉
Di Matteo in Poche out
classic
They needed robben and ribery in bayern legend, boateng at defends and schweinsteiger at mid that would be awesome to match with chelsea legend  Edit: drogba and xabi alonso needs to get here too 😢
Where’s drogba
Senang dan bahagia melihat semua legenda chelsea, mereka orang orang luar biasa, permainannya pun masih terbaik❤❤❤❤
All remember 😢😢 All Love❤❤ Forever chelsea
Michael essien 💙 chelsea 💙 persib
legend never die❤❤❤
Can't believe i smiled the whole time during the entire match. It's so refreshing during this period of desperation. Now i believe We're so broken as a club 💔😢. Thank Legends for the little Revival ❤
Superb so so happy seeing the legends of CFC 😊 what a reunion!!
Eta legend persib naha maen didieu, kudu na ngke sore lawan dormun
RIP VIALI.
Where is our own Lampard?
Bring them back!
What happened to Vialli?   So young!  So smart!  So nice of a gentleman....
Winning in their DNA💙💪
Happy to see Michael Essien. He is the reason I became a Chelsea fan.
Ramires is so fattt 😂
If you focused on football, you can be a legend. Meanwhile someone still make a content for his tiktok & instagram 🤔🤔🤔
What’s the name of the song at the end?
I think this team could rescue Chelsea this season
This is beautiful 😢
John Terry!!!!
Try to bring back those legends as i see they play better than current Suard
This is chelsea fc 💙💙
Почему Драгба не было?
Current Chelsea team can learn something from this legend's.❤❤
Mikel esien mantan pemain persibandung
ESSIEN = CHELSEA LEGEND 💙 ESSIEN = PERSIB BANDUNG LEGEND 💙
Việt Nam 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳 love you
Im taking all over them over Mudryk and coe
drogba ?
Mikel was always something
That Chelsea team still fit
💙💙💙💙💙
i hope the current squad is watching
John Terryyyyyy
Essien, one of the best talented midfielder to ever grace the field. Zola, what a skill?
JT💙💙💙. So happy to have watched this game. Brought back good memories
💙💙💙
I cried. This is beautiful.
Legend 🏆💙
Hope the boys are learning from the legends we need such kind of action in the current squad
Drogba 11
Who will replace us with those who are here now? 😢
Can JT, Ramirez, Mikel, Essien, Cahill come out of retirement and help us. We're really struggling currently and they still got something to give...
They are way better than our current team
This is Chelsea FC
I miss this.days
Chelsea legends vs Chelsea current squad let’s make that happen
Terry-Cahill = cleansheet
I think Chelsea needs the legend Di Matteo to be the manager!
The fitness and preciseness of this Chelsea legends tells why they commanded their time. Malouda could still play that position
Tiago Mendes giving me a Jao Felix vibes. what a player !!
Where's my legend super Frank?
Where lampard and drogba?
This legendary team should be brought to play for us currently
I think we can do better with these legends than our current players. Young for nothing! They lack what we have seen in this match.
This was what we Chelsea fans enjoyed back in the days
Essien merumput kembali di eropa, 👍
The build up to 3rd goal we can see gary cahill pull out his leg instead of going for the ball that zola’s chipped on to him, to prevent any injury to the goalie as all of them at old age, class act cahil 👍
every single player on that pitch is a better finisher than mudryk and I'm not joking
Who else from the blues squad : F. Lampard, Didier Drogba or Micheal Ballak???
JT and Cahill on the last line😭 i missed this so much 😭
I finally smiled again watching a Chelsea game.  Legends for a reason 💙  Goosebumps. I miss this particular Blues 😢
You can't compare Roman era with Brainless Boehly era
Always blue
❤❤❤❤❤
The Chelsea I supported not this current team
지금 팀보다 훨 잘하네 눈물난다 에시앙 그립다 🥲
Can they come out of retirement and play for this season?😢
These legends are better than these current team
Hawa wangecheza saivi owe ndio time yetu
Chelsea get their second win of the season. Man, Boehly's new signings can sure ball out 😅😅😅
Lampard ?  =(
Hope all this new players are watching or maybe we should resign our Legend's back to Chelsea
The current Chelsea team should learn from these legends
This chelsea squad is a cheat....I know they gonna win before kick Since I saw the lineup
This was my first love ❤🎉
Frank LaBeouf
Where's Hazard?
Why Drogba and Lampard didn't play
Essien even Indonesian league, he still have a class!!! He's too good!!!
All chelsea legends are of d mou era
ive got tear in my eye
I hope the current team is taking notes
I miss our team 😢😢
Zola in my Heart <33
Watching Terry, Essien and the rest of the legends that played for this club and earned the legendary status along the way, brings back those 90's, 2000's and 2010's memories.
The current squad is missing such crosses of Micheal Essen
Mike still dey ball
If they ever get Drogba I think I’m going to cry
Beating Bayern is just RDM's usual
Roman Abramovich should come to watching 🥹
Nothing change about the legend. 😂😂😂 Kalou still misses chance like his prime time.
Галлас ппц посторел
Where is the current squad ?? This is simple and effective football
Miss you ramires
Zola played the same as he did when he was young
Gary Cahill and John Terry's partnership is better than our current defense.
Refreshing to watch
Germans are loser
💙💙💙💙LEGENDS⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
This Chelsea have shown the youngest guns and the current squad what they are supposed to do and how to win matches. I love watching these old Bwoyz
Mantap Legend PERSIB..
What a team!! They all play with their hearts and determination. This is the real proper chel!!! Thank you legends for putting a beautiful smile on my face once more ❤❤❤  I wish our current squad can learn from the great legends 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
i'm full of crying 😭 i miss u guys i miss this chelsea
These confirms that Football is 95% IQ and 5% agility..Period.
Essiieeenn
Can the current Chelsea team watch this game over and over to see what Chelsea is all about
drogba???
where is Drogba? Whe he did'nt play? so sad...  can we just put them in chealsea squad this year... I believe they can win EPL this year.. LOL
Have missed watching someone in Chelsea jersey playing such a beautiful football
Wooow,senang rasanya bisa mlihat para legend beraksi kembali di lapangan hijau...Masih mnampilkan permainan yg cantik & gol" yg indah...😎👏
It was just refreshing watching these legends... Brilliant! Absolutely World Class!
Mikel man what a player💙
Mudrykkk
They need to train our current squad
This generation was unbelievable wow still shinning , legend is a legend for sure no doubt
I smiled today my Chelsea just played , those you got me supporting chelsea❤❤❤
Thanks to these great men. They really made Chelsea great
this veteran team can beat our current squad 💀
Ебать я старый
Our current squad could learn a thing or two from this performance I won’t even lie, this was slick play from the legends
จอนเทอรี่ ผมลงรักผู้ชายคนนี้มากๆๆๆๆ
few of these chelsea players can easily play in current squad also atleast as subs, when teams needs a goal.
Bring Essien , kalou, maluda back in team
i think chelsea legend can destroy them (chelsea's squad right now)
love it <3
Once a blue, always a blue
Watching it emotionally. 😢 This was my Chelsea❤ Thanks legend for giving me my glimpses.... Wish our current players plays like this.
Essien salam dari persib bandung Indonesia
Zola Zola Zola Zola ❤
Come back Roman Abramovic 😢😢, chelsea membutuhkan mu
Para pemain Chelsea di skuad sekarang harus belajar banyak kepada mereka - mereka ini, determinasi tinggi untuk bisa menang dan tanpa menyerah mencoba para legenda ini mencontohkan seharusnya Chelsea berada.
Before they leave they should speak to the current team nicely....
Todd Boehly please resign these Chelsea legends 😭.
Class is permanent. This genuinely made me so happy 🥲🥲
Can we bring them back and trash this current lots out
Good one
All is superb . but i miss my pure striker didier .
Obi Mekel is world class for me.
Chelsea Legends without DROGBA??
Bring back Chelsea Bohely 😢
Pochetinho should use this squad
This made me Smile 😊
Pochetinho should use this squad
Essien.. Legend persib.. 💙💙😄
Luca is written in big letters all over Chelsea history, and there will only ever be one Gianfranco Zola! It was also fantastic to see Pierre Luigi Casiraghi after so many years, along with all the numerous other legends.
ugh hearing names like Terry, Cahill, Cech, Zola, Makelele bring back some fond memories
Would rather watch a legend team than a current team 😢
ยัง คงเข้าขากันนะ😂
Better than the  squad now :’)
Nice to see everyone but it still feels empty without Lamps and  Didier
Keren, legenda PERSIB bandung cetak goal
Essien have been play to persib bandung club
Drogba should’ve definitely played
Essien belum habis kerennn
I baddddly love THEM
Нашим старичкам из челси надо приподать урок молодым нынешним игрокам  😅эх
Mudryk, Jackson, in fact all of our forwards need to take lessons from that last scorer, Tiago..  These players could still come out of retirement and score almost same number of goals that our current team has scored in 4 league games.
Lengend PERSIB is Coool 😂
Mudryk and Jackson take notes
Maybe with this ,we will have a breathe of Fresh air in the  CFC 💙💙
Is noni Madueke seeing what he should be doing with the ball on the wing,not dribbling  without target.
Legends should give Energy TALK to our Chelsea Team and staff..... this will really Boost their mind and confidence 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Since TT left, this is the best Chelsea match l have watched. I hope the current jokers can learn from our legends match and know what the fans expect especially at Stamford bridge.
I really miss this legend team
Todd to resign this guys 😂😂😂
Good old Chelsea
super legend!!!
Better than our team
This Chelsea is amazing
Essien world class legend persib and chelsea💙
I think that chelsea with these players is going to be better than the one that has even if all the players are 40+
ESSIEN LEGEND PERSIB BANDUNG🎉
🥹
John Terry is Chelsea... Chelsea is John Terry 🌻💙
When blues was really blues..leave alone this  you can't  tell if they are reallyblue
Our Legends blessed Stamford Bridge💙 Idk how but hopefully this can inspire something for our Great club
COME BACK WE NEEEEEEED YOU 😢😅
These legends are better than our squad
Umpan dan sentuhan pertama mereka lebih bagus daripada mudryk  😂
Look at that Pass from Mikel😢😢
miss these guys. made me love football, played with passion🎉
There should be a Legends of Europe Champions League
The spirit, the mental, the bravery, the class are really different with our player these days. Accurate long ball, momentum passes forward instead of holding the ball and give it to the back like current player does, all was great. I miss we playin like this.
Lovely Game. I wonder if Boehly & Co. had a chat with them.
I love chelsea fc💙💙
Essien masih bisa maen di Liga 1 tuh 😅😅
Oooh well done our boyz
Brilliant stuff
Legend Class 🔥🔥🔥🔥
For me..this Chelsea legends should play in the primier league competition because they play better than our current squid,. Congrats 👏 legends for the win
Club legenda bayern munchen jerman kalah. Timnas senior jerman kalah juga sama jepang 4 - 1
So kalou 😂
Wow. Makes me proud to be a Chelsea fan watching these Legends. Now if only our current expensive squad can get some W's!
zola
Why is gallas playing 😂
The only time chelsea will win
Still a better squad than current CFC
Love to watch Zola's game🎉🎉🎉🎉
That Bayern team almost has no legends, lol
So many legends ❤… nice football played with so many of them still having their magic working.. wished they can visit the training ground more often to teach the first teams
I was about to cry by joy 😊
I love chelsea
เก๋าเกมจริงๆคิดถึงยุคนั้นเลย💙💙💙
John Obi Mikel was dictating the game superbly. He was really the professor of the game 💥💥
This Chelsea team could beat the current Pochetino's jus sayin😂😂
This a chelsea legend beautifull game . Is the best chelsea forever...
Those world class touches 😍
Good Game Legends
This our legends team can beat our current team I swear 😂😂😂
Where THE F is Drogba???!?!?!?!?!
We made a problem releasing Mikel, he bosses the midfield.
That chip from Zola
💙💙💙💙
Replace them with Current squad and atleast book CL Spots and win one domestic Cup...This proves that.. Talent are of no use without dedication and Coordination..
They play creative and beautifull game compare to current squad, evemthough they are slow
love Chelsea,  From HK.
I'm sure Ramirez and Malouda will have much bigger impact than our current Chelsea wingers if they were to play in the 1st team.
Couldn't finish smiling 😁😁😁 That was beautiful 🎉
a nice flick assist from Ben Stiller for 3rd goal
They are ready for the premier league
Essien is PERSIB LEGEND!
Cool match💙
Pochetino should learn from this formation.
This team can win UCL literally....Chelsea should make this their 1st team
Bahkan legenda kami lebih terlihat bertarung nya dari pada team yang saat ini
Current Chelsea players should watch and learn from the Legends game.  They are invariably good.
This is the legends Team which made reach million of Fans across the world.
Ramires legenddd
Mending ini yang main di epl dari pada yang ono , ampas semua 😂
If I had the power to to give these Chelsea players their youthfulness for 1 season, I'll not hesitate. Their fight can't match these current players we have.
I love this
Machel Essien ❤💙🤘
Wow! They've made me feel comfortable being a Chelsea fan again. You just can't stop loving these legends 💙💙💙
John Obi Mikel still got it. Even his body and play. We miss that Mikel-Essien midfield so bad
Chelsea yang asli ya ini
Love too see the legends playing.. ❤ Bravo Chelsea.. ❤❤❤
Am glad I watched most of these players grace the pitch those days Beautiful memories
Roberto dimatteo (Thropy U.C.L)                     vs Stephen Effenberg (0 Thropy)
💙💙
Bertrand and Cahill don’t look like they belong there at all 😂 both looking fit and could still pull off a shift in our current squad
Essien 💙
Legend play than current
You can only wish our current team is this good 😢😢😢
Can we play our legend squad instead?
Welp Chelsea got their trophy this season. Job done boys
Chelsea nowadays need to learn skills and gameplay from the legend squad
Give them a contract....They play better than the current squad. ❤
This display is our standard! Hope the current team can take one or two from this game.  And how is Mikel not playing active football? That pass to Kalou 🥶
now this is chelsea
JT is Mr. Chelsea through and through.
No, I’m not crying…
I hope the current Chelsea teams are watching this 😢
Old man Zola - Mudryk
Mikel need to hang down his Bute wherever he hanged it 😢 He can still make our current first eleven
JT26🥺
chelsea ini jauh lebih baik dari chelsea yg sekarang
More entertaining than poch blues
That's the Chelsea that we loved! CLASS IS FOREVER!
Nice to see these football giants again in action.
Proper chels
Ada legend persib
Terry y cahill podrían ser titulares aún en el chelsea jajaja
Lebih seru nonton chelsea tua ketimbang chelsea muda😂
Mikel Obi well done. ❤
weird that legend team is far better finishing than our current 1st team 😂
Beautiful header from essien
essien should play with our current squad now
Chills. That chip from zola.
THIS IS CHELSEA
Chelsea legends playing better ball than our current squad 😭😭😭

This is the Chelsea we all know and miss from a City fan Rip Vialli BLUEZ LEGEND 💙🙌
Enzo and Jackson must watch this match, they will gain a lot of knowledge
Our Chelsea back😂😂
What a pass from zola
This legend team can win premier league for Chelsea fc😊😊😊. As a chelsea fan i am  happy to see and watch our legends
시발 이 스쿼드, 이 경기가 더 첼시스럽다.
I hope kids learn more from these guys
Whose the coaching
Essien persib legend 🤣
What a great performance from Chelsea legends.. Have a nice day.. :-)
I really miss the times when they actively played for Chelsea, I almost cried seeing things like this
Essien persib bandung
Legend persib
I think Michael Essien can still play Professional football.  What a talent!!!🇬🇭
😢miss
That turn from makelele we need someone like him in tough situation
the only 2 chelsea player i love and miss to watching all the time is..  HAZARD & IVANOVIC
This game brought back so many memories. KTBFFH!!!
legenda persib Bandung emg mantap 😂
Would have liked to see Hazard make the team.
I love chelsea Fc 💙💙💙
Let our current players see how it is actually done..
Beautiful!❤
Umpan nya kerenn..💙👍
Mantap Essien salam dari Bobotoh biru barat🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Would be really nice to see Lampard play in this game!!!!!!
Who are the two hotties before the game?
These Legends play better than the current squad  Look at the creativity 🙌🏾the passes from the midfield 😭😭❤️no wonder we call these guys legends  I hope these kids watch n learn
I really love seeing my legends play again but I didn't see Dider an Lampido...  FOREVER BLUE ✌🏻💙 I go where👏👊
Give Pochettino this team 😅
Good old days
True legends..once blue always 🔵🔵
OMG RAMIRES... FINALLY HAVE A NICE BODY.. NOT SKINNY AS USUAL.. TOTALLY DIFFERENCE
Watching Our Ex-players play I saw something that seems missing in our Current Squad   Ki!!er instinct and Telepathic understanding  I don't know if it comes with training together Bcos dis bunch hasn't trained together in Years and Yet they had this great Understanding on the Pitch   I wish they would spend time with the Current Squads and give dem tips or two   Most are on international duty but those left behind can learn sterling could pick up a tin or two from malouda , definitely there is a lot to learn from Essien and JT has a lot to pass on  Come On Blues 💙💙💙💙💙
Malouda contributing more on the Left side than 100M Mudryk all season
Essien PERSIB LEGEND 🇮🇩
Sangar kieu legend favorit aing💙🔥
Exclusive thank you legends of Chelsea. Mikel doing his thing...Class
Imagine if the Frank Lampard play, alongside with THE Didier Drogba, Gus Poyet, Dennis Wise, Damien Duff, and even Eden Hazard.  Current Chelsea squad should learn from these legends, to play with PRIDE as Chelsea players.
When Drogba 😌
This legends still play like the old days, Mourinho did a great job
Essien 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭✅✌🏾✌🏾
Chelsea is not just a football team, but more of family.. You can't be a Chelsea fan and not feel being part of it. It's blue for ever🙏
Ballack would have played first half for Bayern and second half for Chelsea 😂
This current generation should learn ... What Chelsea was 😭😭😭...now they ruined our club
This is the Chelsea I fell in love with💙
The best Chelsea match I’ve enjoyed this year
How the hell Chelsea legend play better than our current team
Really miss this squad😢😢😢
I miss this Chelsea
Legendssss!! 🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Chelsea!!!!
Well this team is 100 times better than the actual chelsea team playing now
Ada legend persib
Is one of those three ladies the wife and the other two the daughters of Gianluca Vialli ?
Class is permanent
Enjoyed that game.
Just look at the iconic positioning of these old players and how they anticipate and always ready to receiving any distribution from teammates. C'mon these players were just something unique, distinct in their generations in the Chelsea shirt. How half of these players never really played together but was able to find ways to locate them going in attack and possessing was so iconic, like they all played together in one generation which isn't so. They are just what made Chelsea one of the greatest teams in the world. They are just irreplaceable.  I can't get why our current players who are energetic, strong, and sharper now in their young ages, and have played together for months can't play with some pattern of rhythm to even win simple games. They come in every week almost to disappoint the fans like they are not ever ready to play football.  Last night the legends reminded these players to sit up and fight for the glorious name of this honourable football club.
Og my God,,,,. Cech ,Terry Mikel , cahil   ,ramires , kalou ,   essien 😭😭😭😭😭how I miss this team please come back guys
Chelsea has to console themselves with this match after the heartbreak they're currently passing through
Mikel Obi protection of backline is second to none Bro is always so calm than ice I really miss this most of them can still get into the current quad with ease The legends are the reasons we were proud of Chelsea and not these overpaid bunches of idiots now
Legendary Zola
Essien Legend PERSIB BANDUNG
lejen persib bang
Where's Lampard and Drogba? 😢
Chelsea yg sebenernya😊
Zola 25 ❤
Terry 26 The legend 🎉🎉
why no Hazzard? He is free
buset, legend persib sampe diundang juga
Ya Allah seneng banget Asli..❤
Hutchinson dribble and control ball was 🔥
Proper Chels!
even the senior citizens scoring more than the first team 😭
Where is lamps
It was really nice to see Christophe lollichon in the dug out again
when world become peaceful again and Russia earned the position they should have and welcome back Russia Boss. Chelsea is in my mind forever
Chelsea will start winning now .. our legend clearing the way…. See you all after the international break💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
This the Chelsea team I know 😭💕
Legend❤
Chelsea with the extreme tryhard.
Cara main essien beda, main di persib gak gitu.
Growing up to see these legends play. I'm so grateful and I have tears of joy to see them play again. What a nostalgia.
Where is Drogba…..
It’s crazy how important Tiago was to the team despite playing for one season. I remember him scoring that screamer. He was one of Mourinho’s most trusted player only to be replaced because we just couldn’t keep Essien out.
The Chelsea legend reminded me by beautiful past for blue's, the current team just ghosts
Better then our present first team
Nice to see PERSIB legend playing... 🔥
Ternyata legends maennya lebih enak diliat ketimbang chelsea yg sekarang
With the two trophies so far we the Chelsea Fan's can go home and rest for the season 🚶🚶🚶🥴
mendingan chelsea legends, dari pada chelsea yang sekarang, coba tandingin pasti menang chelsea legenda
Chelsea boys of today need to continue to watch a match like this. In fact, anytime they are facing tough opponents, they should watch when Chelsea was Chelsea. It's amazing to see my great legends again. Great on legend, Luca!
Wish our young lads can learn a thing or two from our legends ,, totally enjoyed it
John terry is a true born leader
Played far Better than Chelsea rn😭😂
That’s beautiful 😍
I love you guys all chelsea legends💙💙💙
I think the German national team prolly needed a few Bayern legends to help them in the match against Japan.
this is so wholesome
Wish they still played
Di Matteo, thanks for the UCL trophy
🤟💙💙💙
Tear in my eye...
Classic legend team chelsea worldclass ❤
Best match ive seen for at least 2 years! 🎉🎉🎉
Coba agendakan Chelsea legend vs Chelsea sekarang, Saya berani taruhan Chelsea yg sekarang pasti dibantai.
When I was young i enjoyed with our team and Now once again we can see them on pitch 💙 it's happiness. A lot of emotional 💙 This is my Club 💙 and I love Chelsea 💙.
Players like Mikel, Terry, Essien, and Cahill still have plenty of gas to burn from their tanks, drafting them into the current Chelsea team will bring back the mentality we've been craving for.
than you all are happy, we gotta have rejoice😊
The legends are still playing better than the "youngsters"
ADA LEGEND PERSIB BANDUNG CUYY
ESSIEN PERSIB LEGEND 💙
Didier Drogba??
นักเตะระดับตำนาน จับบอล ส่งบอล ยังดีกว่าชุดปัจจุบรรณ 🔵
What a flood of memories that come, watching these legends! Fantastic!
I wish our current squad atleast learn the spirit of our legends...it's high time for them to show off...
None in this current team can get a place in this bench leave alone starting 😅
I am not crying 😢
I think this game, was to break the curse of Russian  gods in this team. Hope for the best going forward
Amazing
We need a player like those our legends right now.Missing them.
Mikel could honestly still do a job in midfield for current squad. Oozes class
John Terry scored in the 26th minute his iconic number ❤
Please make this our real players for the leage 😂
There s alsi PERSIB Legend😂
These legends have a better attack than the current Chelsea squad
บาร์เยินมาเดินเล่นกันรึ เล่นบอลเหมือนเด็กหัดใหม่เลย 🤭🤣🤭
สุดยอดมากคะ 💙💙
Hopefully the ones that are in the current team watches this and learns from this game
Am really happy ❤❤
The legends❤ played better than the current team 😂. Well, those young lads can learn a lot from these legends 👍😁 it will come. Believe in Chelsea 😍
all your legends is still better than in this present a new Chlsea team😂😢
John Terry has been the best striker to play on our team since Costa
no lampard
Persib legend MAMANG ESSIEN
Legend persib
They can sift our current team like wheat😅
This brought tears to my eyes. I did not expect them to play as if they never stopped playing together. The chemistry was there from minute one until the final whistle. Zola, Makelele, Essien, Terry, Ramires, Mikel, Cahill, Mendes, it was fantastic watching all of them, the whole lot play as a proper team once more. RIP Gianluca Vialli 💙
Legenda Persib Michael Essien
Stanford Bridge fields of dream.
Current team should see what they play , there are emotional ,passion, classical etc.
I hate Chelsea with a passion since Boehly bought the club, but this squad is world class even to this day! I'd rather watch Chelsea games if they played PL with this squad than with all these overrated youngsters nowadays. Nostalgia hits hard.
I hope all our these our current Gen Z players are watching this and pick motivation from this…..KTBFFH 💙💙
this is the team sheet i wanna see next weekend vs bournmouth
are you watching current Chelsea squad ?? this is how you play football
This is Chelsea. Haba!!!!
We need Terry back as Chelsea manager
🥹
I am watching with tears flowing endlessly ❤💙💙💙❤🔥🔥🔥
Même ceux sont mieux que ceux d’aujourd’hui
Chelsea ❤
I still love legends
Then Poch will play 5 defenders n only 2 attackers come next no matter da opponent!!!
May the current starting squad borrow a leaf from the legends Amen.
Chelsea Dream Tim
Thank you Chelsea legends 😊❤,  at least show these young team how its done. 🫶
Not one current chelsea player  is as good as any of these guys
So beautiful
make this legends squad training versus the current squad regulary. to embrace them
People I miss everyday. Glad I got to see the gang again 💙
JOHN TERRY!!!
Chelsea legend 4 - 0 chelsea now 😅
Brilliant! Chelsea had so many legendary players. This brought back the memories!
misi bang
This commentary is wild😂😂😂
Mikel is class.
Who’s jody morris?…where’s drogba, cole, n lampard
I miss Essian 🥲
Enak lihatin tim ini timbang chelsea yg asli.
😂😂❤❤
For sure these oldies are far more fitter than the current squad!!!!!! These created alot of chances and they converted them, they possessed the ball,played good football what didn't they do???
What our young Chelsea players can't do 😢
Commentator: Let's hope it's not the only trophy we see here at the Bridge this season 😭😭😭
Love Chelsea legend ❤❤❤
❤❤❤
I miss Mikel , Ramires, and Essien
Эти легенды умеют играть не то что сейчас эта звёздная молодёжь которая не для удовольствия играет а за деньгами гонится
Thank you guys for this 😭😭💙💙💙
Forever the blues 💙💙💙💙💙
Our new boys should take notes..... legends playing better than them no hard feelings 😭😭 🔥🔥
Bring back this team to premiere league, they will atleast manage to keep 0-0 with west ham.
nah tim ini yang harusnya maen di primare league sekarang hehe
Legend😢😢
Now I can say bring bayern legends against barca legends we will beat them.
Legends for a reason.
I miss this squad. 😢
chelsea might be off form now by miles💀, but u cant take our legacy from us. these guys are the reason chelsea even has fans and stans to begin with. from terry to cahill… right down the cech It brings joy to me seeing these guys plat again…still with lovely form and chemistry. ❤ we can never die and london will always be blue💙
I come in tears remembering this legend and see the other legend’s playing in the blue again. I know I’m old and heading to my fifties but the emotion with this football club never be old. Thank you Chelsea and Chelsea legends for sharing those years. Blues forever ♾️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Those guys reminded me of the sweet old Chelsea .
JT and essien scored better than jackson and murkyk
Now we can see the difference between premier league player and Bundesliga player from here . Ex Bundesliga don't even know how to run .
If only we have half the talent of these legends now 😢
Essien is persib legend
Can we appoint de matteo back? 😂
The squad that we all miss. Seriously.  With the Chelsea current state. This kinda tear me up
Legends never old💙💙
the legends are far better than our current squad.
Blues 💙🏆
Cahill is a cheksea legend?😮
Zola Magic Assist 🔥
The best coach di mateo
All smiles. These players know how to fight.
Essien persib bandung
5:05 Essien did it once for Chelsea, West Ham away in the 2010/11 season
This is football. The legends are even playing better than the current crop of the Chelsea players.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol kalou with the most kalou miss.
Why don't you invite Torres?
Anjirr aia essien
Now this is the reason Chelsea is Chelsea. Not these jokers there now
Am still scared of this squad.

This is chelsea without politics the current chelsea has been touched by americans and politics
That determination Terry showed to get the ball first and kept on running to finish up the action with so much passion same with Cahill is what makes the difference with our current team . Look at that smile on their faces ❤ this is great to see !
wp blues
This team can win msn city current squad, look at the runs, the loop passes unlocking the defence OMG
Terharu 👍👍
Essien is more way better than caicedo
Chelsea squad was OP. 😑
I'm sure this team plays better than the current team.
So nice to see that this guys are still around and strong. I felt so delighted seeing them yet again.
Where is Kai Havertz?
King Drogba kmna😢
Great to see JT in arms band again Captain, Leader, Legend ❤❤❤
Who else cried 🥲watching this??? THIS IS THE BLUES I KNOW 💙
Today's Ramires was so strange everyone, you guys are amazing but it's a shame not to be able to see your idol on the field, Eidur Gudjohnsen, i love this club.
Main ki kyk ngene lho POCHE !
Legend aja bisa bikin 4 gol 😁
Esien đá vẫn nét như ngày nào
💙💙💙
Abrahamovic legend 😢
Memang mantan pemain Persib mantap x😅😅😅
Im chelsea fans since 85. I feel sad if they show us more history then what we have today. It show you chelsea is suc nowadays
Gallas still best
Skuad ini lebih menghibur daripada liat Chelsea sekarang 🤣
They play for the badge…not like current crybaby boys
This team much better than Chelsea squad this season
Beautiful to watch the people we call legends years after hanging up their boots. I love this beautiful club ❤   The commentators made it more beautiful 😍😍 Life is beautiful
Wayy better than what we have  been watching recently. But i believe our present boys will click the way it should and better games will start coming. It have to come.
I love my Chel
As a Chelsea fan I think this is exactly what we needed lol. Little bit of healing of the spirit. Good to see the old faces again.
Love you guys so much Legends 💙  Pray for Myanmar🙏
This game was like a baptism in football greatness compared to how dreadful this new team and owners have been. I never smiled so much since we won the first champions league trophy.
Kalau chelsea yg sekarang gimana?😂
Haaa legends play beta football than the current.
Thank You Mr. Zola for making me a Chelsea fan. I don't know where this club would have been if you had not play for them. RIP Gianluca, you are not forgotten.
Chelsea Legends 💙
Garry 😢 where you at
Legenda terbaik... Best oii
Ramires has gain a lot of weight. I couldn’t recognize him until I see his name
Where is Lampard and Drogba ???
zola is another level.
Mikel Dey ball
Kalou tearing up the play and missing it at end 😂😂😂😅 😢Those days...
JT we miss you 😢 a pity we can’t have you back
no Drogba and Torres. both makes me a Chelsea fan. but this is legendary squad
Verdienter Sieg an Chelsea, Glückwunsch, aber bei Bayern waren gefühlt alle 10 Jahre älter :) Man stelle sich vor es hätten noch Lampard und Drogba gespielt :)
They still got it!!!! 💙
So sweet to watch. These legends give us so much joy.
The Commentator said, "Football will never change. It's about the first touch, if you don't have a good first touch then you don't have a good career."  Many of today's young lads need to read and learn that over and over again. You don't need to do too much on the pitch, just do the right thing and take your chances when they come.  Football is simple and will never change.  Salute to the Legends.
Ku teringat M Essien  main di Persib beberapa tahun kebelakang
Our legend performs more better than this current squad, 😢😢😢
I miss this Chelsea . Ramires come save us. Essen where you at ?
This team is still better than over current overrated young squad

Terry Cahill Malouda Kalou Essien Gallas Makelele Ramires only Legend 😢
So happy to watch my young age heroes. Thanks Chelsea!! ❤❤❤❤
Essien 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Essien Legend Persib 🔵
INI AĎALAH CHELSEA YANG KU KENAL, DIISI DENGAN PEMAIN BERKUALITAS SEPERTI CECH TERRY BUKAN SAMPAH SEPERTI MUDRYK
Ok that's it. We need to resign Essien, Mikel, JT, Makelele, Zola and Tiago. Make it happen Todd.
ramires.
Сол баяғы Челси UEFA рейтингте 1 орындағы, өте мықты құрама 🇰🇿.
Bringing back good memories …needed same @ this moment.Very entertaining.
See if the legendary team is better than the current 1st team
If only Sam Hutchinson never had that Knee injury... him and Dave would've been that Terry/Carvalho partnership
Esien legenda persib bandung Indonesia😊
This legend team is Better than the current £1bn spend lol 😂 and they’d equate £200m back on the day
Didn’t see Arjen robben and Ribery of Bayern
Essien, Zola, and Obi Mikel is still a baller 😄
I wish we had this squad (all young) today
Mikel Obi 🥰🥰🥰
Mikel Obi 🥰🥰🥰
No doubt this Chelsea 💙 legends play better than our 1 billion team currently....no shades
Salomon kalou reminded me of how he used to miss our goal. 😂. Beautiful play all round. So beautiful to watch.

Chelsea muda, management,pelatih harus lihat dan contoh gmn mereka bermain.itu Chelsea sesungguhnya
This legend will win current squad. Some shouldn't have retired so soon.
Robben was legend for both team 🎉
Drogba..?
I miss these players😢
These legends matches are so cool!
I think this was just what we needed right now. Refreshing for Chelsea fans and it’ll also show the standards to our players right now. Great nostalgia here.
I am not crying

Chelsea squad sekarang di ajarin cara bermain sepak bola yang bener oleh legenda chelsea
It's crazy how John Obi Mikel could walk easily to our current squad man. What a player. Btw, that Tiago Mendes's goal is a thing of beauty. Very entertaining match
sangat rindu dengan squad bermental juara ini,  Tapi, kemana Drogba dan Lampard?
เอาชุดนี้มาเตะพรีเมียร์ได้ไหมครับ5555
❤❤❤
يالله عاجز عن التعبير
Chelsea has legends?
Our legends 🤍  Great respect for you and for every drop of sweat you bled for Chelsea 💙🤍

Mengobati rasa rindu thankss
Blue is the color 💙🔥💯
Vialli ❤
Where is lgd drogba?
Essien legend chelsea FC and PERSIB BANDUNG 💙💙
We’ve moved from signing proven world class players to signing world class potentials
Mostly Chelsea's legend retired around few past year
Zola is te reason i am a chelsea fan since the naughty's, simply because his last name is a common first name in my country which i thought was so cool as a kid and i never looked back! This fills my heart to see our Legens still know what it takes to win.... DECISIVELY haha COYB💙💙💙
Essien legend persib💙
Almost couldn't recognise Ramires. Only thing missing was a Zola free kick goal! Just before Essien scored that header, I was hoping he let rip from 35 yards. Would have been a classic Essien goal, even the commentator said it was worth a hit.
These legends where the reasons we became proud Chelsea fans, so happy to see you all Top Top people, hopefully this current squad can learn from this group..
These lads slaps our current squad😂😂
How I wish this our current squid will pick up from watching this❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh, i'm not gonna lie, i'm break down crying in my room watching this clip.😭 These oldies have better vision, better passes, better teamwork, and better positioning than the current squad. 😭 I know that we shouldn't have to think the old times is always better than nowadays, or trap ourself into the old nostalgia, but this old chelsea team is actually that good. 😭 This is the team that i used to grow up watching 😭
JT score again.What kind of Legend..❤❤❤
Player  PERSIB golll
Legend Team > Current Team
Damn i love my club🫶🏾💙
John Terry has more goals this season then Mudryck or whatever his name is lmao
All the heart break our currunt team giving this was a joy to watch 💙💙💙
Ada legend persib.
I wanted to see Frank lampard
Why not sighn this legends instead coz we r trash rn
Why not sighn this legends instead coz we r trash rn
So many good memories. My mind went back in time. My wish would be to see the great Didier Drogba wearing the blue shirt again. Greetings from Argentina.
They are legend of The blues❤
Better than our 2023 squad
Once a legend it's always legend more better then current squad
Chelsea 💙💙💙
This team can beat our first team pretty well
I love Chelsea for doing a game like this :,)
Kok esien disini gacor beda sama di persib apa masalah lapang gitu atau pemain persib yang nggk tau watak esien apa efek pelatih😂
If only Chelsea were this good😒
Ghana black stars still need Michael Essien
Please where is drogba
Terbaik Pada masanya Sekuat Paling di takuti Melebihi Man city Pada masa Sekarang Saya  rasa lebih ngeri chelsea pada masa itu dari manchester city sekarang karena pada masanya ketika Barcelona di latih Pep Guardiola dan di huni pemain terbaik dunia hanya wasit yang dapat mengalahkan chelsea rindu😢😢😢
The only trophy we'll see at the bridge this season.
Bring so many memories 😭
Why I'm i crying
Squad chelsea so rubish n stupid but his legend club very good strong better so better
What a joke, Old dudes play better than young (fit) players 😅 we have  lived good times with those legends
good game
John Mikel Obi For ten years as our anchor man, we won a lot. 1 CL, 1 Europa, 2 PL, 2 FA, 2 Carling
Smiles and tears after watching this 😂💙
Chelsea legends are just the best. These current players are chicken boys
Chelsea legend can beat the current team 😂😢 shame
Tears on my eyes still, what is happing our Chelsea now?.
Who noticed Ramirez just added weight than before
This bring tears 😢.  I miss em all.. especially  with how the team is playing now   these guys are true legends of chelsea
This team of old men would smash the current team!

So good to see these legends playing for such a great cause! RIP Gianluca Vialli!
Legend persib

I’d rather we line up with these legends after the international break tbh..

Petr cech : 🗿🗿🗿

Where is drogba
Man I wished super FRANK and KING DROGBA were there with the crew man absolute legends
And then we have Mudryk 😢
These team might win over our current squad 😂
They’re expert in recovering hacked or lost assets. SHES_CAROLE is the name. They helped me recover all my lost assets
ZOLA 🦁💪
Can we swap this legend squad with our current squad pls?
Captain scoring, Essien heading, silverware lifted. Good old days
Terry❤️
Essien to Persib Bandung again hehe

Michael Essien salam dari Persib Indonesia 😊😊😊😊😊
Abramovich dream team😅
The current squad must watch their predecessors play beautiful football😢. Not saying they arnt playing well, but we need goals too. We need players who have will to succeed in every game like these legends 😊.
My happiest watching chelsea in over a year
Legend's playing beautifull football
Where drogba, Oscar??
Where is anelka and michael ballack?
Bro my club was so awesome now it’s a joke 😊
Great Game Really, Wooooow Football is really an Amazing Sport 👏👏👏👏🥳👊⚽
Those were the days when the shirt meant more than their wages
Please use 4-2-3-1 like pre-season in America we have a good holding midfielder
Proud to see again our legend,,,these real heroes are better than the current players in our club 😢
We fell off
Where is Drogba and  A .Cole
I miss these Men! Look at sweet midfielders!!! Our current situation makes me wanna cry!
Надо показать этот матч нынешнему составу Челси...
❣️❣️
Seeing JT scores made me smile 😊 💙💙💙
Legend persib juga tuh no 5 wkwkwwk😂
Di Matteo is back😂

This made my night. Missed Lampard and Drogba.
The match was in honor of who please
Lampard where?
Chelsea first team should watch 😂
Blues forever
🔥🔥🔥
Drogba and Lampard in Final score 8-0 😂
Up the Chelsea 💙💙💙💙
LEGEND 💙
age is a number. they still have the skill
We want this legend team
The current squad needs to take a page, this is chelsea
Our legends are still balling 👏🏻👏🏻  I think our current squad need to learn from these legends of ours if we want to win every game's.
This makes a mockery of the entire Boehly model. These legends played better than our current first team
Wihh ada pemainya persib bandung 😂
We love boys you are the best . From Russia with 💙Love! KTBFFH!
Essien the Bison!
Can we get them back to the club? They're more clinical than our current bunch of young guns..
Right in the childhood 😢
These men were magic 🪄✨🪄🪄✨ Tears in my eyes 😭
Fue un partidazo...soy fiel seguidor del Chelsea y me llegó una nostalgia que no puedo describirla... ojalá y los jugadores de la plantilla actual puedan sacar algo bueno de ellos...saludos desde GDL MÉXICO
there should be Eden Hazard
Those good old Essien days!!!
Nostalgic, The Blue armies we know. The energy, character, and winning mentality were top-notch!!!
copiones del barsa puro pra buscar suscriptores
Chelsea legend lebih semangat badan dan staminanya masih bugar biarpun susah berumur❤
Lebaouf!!!
That's the midfielders I want right now in current Chelsea squad  Essien - Enzo - Ramires
I believe Mikel can still feature for this current Chelsea squad. He's still so good, I mean look at his passing game
We all missed our legendary striker Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard in this squad. The greatest players in Chelsea during their times.
imagine essien and enzo in the middle. We should be in top 4 right now 😂
They even play better than the current Chelsea
Lampard and Drogba were the only things missing in this game. Both certainly fit the criteria of being a Chelsea legends so I assume availability is the only reason they weren't involved. Would've loved to see them tho
You can see the team work, the build up that gives chance to anyone to score But the Chelsea current team has nothing more than playing to win man of the match instead of team work. Wish we can have them back
Iswear essien can still play black stars
JT Scoring brought a genuine smile to my face
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ i love zola
We need to play simple pass with vision and spirit like this , really miss this spirit and happiness in our Chelsea now
The only match i'll watch chelsea play this season
Chelsea muda harus nonton ini mereka Chelsea yang berjaya d msa nyh semua pemain Chelsea lagi bagus bgusny
Where is Lampard and Drogba
VIALLI
Was there tonight, What a great night,Very emotional at the start,, Vialli💙Legend
can we resign all of them and scrap this team?
The dossers we have playing for us now should be made to watch this every night before bed. In fact, it should be in their contracts to do so.
equitable how JT wears his legendary number 26 and scored on the 26 minutes. It was meant to be. COYB💙
Now,our Chelsea fans miss into this moments...
Give Zola a temporary contract
All of these guy brings back great memories
JohnTerry🎉❤
Obi Mikel ❤❤❤
Wow Lucio-Elber, Cech-Terry…legend
Now Chelsea current team will learn how to score goals against opponent
Back when Chelsea played with lions pride………just look at us now
This legends squad can beat our squad now
😢
JT walking out and Petr Cech behind him  I grew up watching that 🥹
Where is Robben?
Where is the king Didier Drogba?
Take it for current squad
Легенды🐐🐐🐐

All Legend is better than current squad

What an implementation 🥶

I would have loved to watch King Drogba, Michael Ballack, Joe Cole, Ashley Cole and Super Franc Lampard play this game too
Gallas looking like Samuel L Jackson in Black Snake Moan....
Ou est Anelka ?
where is Duff? 😢
All smiles on my face throughout the video 💙
Eventho some of these legends wasnt playing on the same squad but they sync better than our current team. Our current team need to learn from this team
Roberto dimateo coach chelsea is good

That Gallas impression of Santa helped erase his infamous threat of scoring an own goal to force a transfer😂
Loved the game both teams were great💓💓
Essien can still help Chelsea in midfield, guy still got engine ⚙️
legend better than now, downgrade team
That was beautiful to watch
Mantapp pemain persib ngasupkeun
This is the original Chelsea.
When the legend is better than current player 😅
Our current squad must retire with immediate effect And our legends take over‼️
Our current chelesea players need to watch this match highlights
Wow! Playing better than our current squad 😂
I hope the current team sees this match
Chelsea wins 😂
Can we switch our current team with this one😂😂😂 love our legend 😊
Miss you so much guys
Sekuat yang hebat
Anjay legend Persib ada😅
So glad to see real heroes after a long time being so disappointed about the club 🥺
This Team is better than our current squad let them play the league 🫣
See how our legendary defenders are offensive minded
Chelsea’s best result in two years… Essien stillbetter than Enzo, Caicedo, and Lavia combined
I want them back.... 😊😊😊 Fluid football... Missed this for a long while 😢
Amazing Pass from Essien 💙 Amazing Goal from Tiago 💙
So sweet to see these LEGENDS play at this historical stadium.  I was crying 😢
Love theme all our Legends💙
Best legends ever❤ 🎉🎉
legends never end
The legend make me smile. ❤️
italy and chelsea are sibling ☺️
Mantan Pemain Persib
We smoked them 😂🎉🎉
ESSIEN!! MOTM!
Saya tidak berhenti tersenyum, bahagia melihat mereka para legend bermain kembali dan mencetak banyak goal. Saya tumbuh besar dan mencintai Chelsea FC dengan melihat sebagian besar dari mereka bermain.
Those days. Hmmm😅
Watching Chelsea veteran is brought me some tears cuz Chelsea now isn't the same team that we know.
Small boys need to attend this class
We needed this
The equal still has it, mehn!!!!
Lovely to see these legends healthy and happy.
I kid you not if my Chelsea faced this old Chelsea with Zola operating we would get done 8-0.
Proud to watch our legend still got something when play together.bring us so much memories
Pemain baru Chelsea harus belajar caranya bikin gol sama Chelsea legend
I say we replace our current squad with our legends
Wished Didier played. We haven’t had a striker like him since he left lol.
We need this gameplay in out current squad love u legends
The commentary in 13:06!😂
My eyes are filled with tears for the Chelsea of ​​old, Chelsea is ​​my childhood memories. Watching this game took me back to the happiest times of my life :'(
Football should redefine retirement of these legends. These are some very trained sportsmen who could still be playing and mentoring the young ones coming up
Lumayan buat ngibur fans chelsea....
No lampard and Didier
แต่ละคนสุดๆ
atp we should play our legends instead of the current team and have a higher chance of winning teams like Sheffield
Tiago look like Jao felix
I was hoping to watch with them also Drogba, Anelka, Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Wise, Joe Cole, Hasselbaink, Ricardo Carvalho, Damien Duff, Arjen Robben, and many names. In fact, I cannot mention them all, but I was really hoping for that.
Why did Mikel resign? He is still a baller.
William GALLAS
How tf is gallas a legend 😂
This legend team can beat any team of the PL.
This proper football
Miss all of them alot. Even at this age they have more playing sense, more coordination, more fitness than our present squad..  Passes are absolutely smooth! Poch and Co. Should watch this match.
A beautiful game and great to see our old great players once again 👏
The female team of Chelsea can score the male team.
Legends for real my God look at how the ball mate superb ball control tactics 💯 this brought back the memories man ..seeing them alone all smiles ❤🎉 Anelka and drogba would have sealed the icedcake 😂
Wow legend persib tampil
I missed the good old days of these legends 👏😘💋
Better than our first team squad.
JT the real kapitan
Semoga chelsea muda pada nonton. Gimana cara main yang enak dan efektif.. terutama mudryk yang bisanya cuman lari.. gak guna gak jelas
Terry and Cahill still keeping clean sheets❤
No zola?
I hope the current squad's watching this game???...useless bastards
This our legend team can win the Premier League ❤
Gooooooala🎉🎉🎉
We need an over 40s premier league. Only ex players from that club.
คิดถึงวันและเวลาเก่า ๆ เห็นแล้วชื่นใจ 😁
Chelsea now ❌ Chelsea legends ✅
The most beautiful game I’ve seen in years…thank you legends…this is what I grew up as a child idolizing, magic on a pitch, is what Chelsea FC is
vintage Makelele🔥
Put these legends on our first 11 and we can fight champions league spots
Looking fresher than our current form😂😅
Essien still got those fine master class passes
Not gunna lie, seeing John Terry leading the team out was emotional for me. My god we miss him
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Won’t be seeing champions league nights for a while tho😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ตำนาน 💙💙
i miss the good old time :D come on you blues <3
To see our legends put Goals away with ease.....I hope Poch made our new players watch it and learn  to put the Ball in the Back of the Net!
some of the slowest counter attack I've seen 😂😂 really nice to watch KTBFFH
I hope the current squad was in attendance with their notepads. Football is very fundamental.
We've missed them 😢❤
pertandingan serius dibuat bercanda pertandingan bercanda dibuat serius
I am smiling and enjoying watching these highlights more than any other Chelsea men's team highlights in the past 2 years. We are going through a rough time atm and it will take time untill we are competing for trophies again but on the other hand this past seasons are making me appreciate our former legends and great teams even more. 💙💙
Michael Essien coming back as a striker. Reincarnation?😮
mamang essien alus pisan euy🎉
Mantab, mantan pemain persib ngegolin jg
Is it possible to have our legends back to play for us?.😢
This were the people who made me fell in love with Chelsea
ada legend persib tuh
This sooooo Fantastic ❤❤❤❤❤.This Chelsea Legends are better than the current team.
I enjoy the moments, much love to our legends❤🥰😍. Where are Lampard and Drogba?
bring back memories 🥲🥲🥲
This Chelsea legends squad plays better than our current team

I hope toddy and poch is watching  This is chelsea  We are bulid up to win  Even at your old age you will always win
This is the blues 💙 I use to know
persib legend....
Can we just play them instead of our current team?
Obi mikel passing class
Class 🔥💙
it must have been emotional for his daughters and wife to be there
Brought a tear to my eye! As a 22 year old supporter that's watched Chels since i was 4, this really is my heaven - remember having most of these players posters from the match-day programme up on my wall as a kid! Seeing the likes of Ramires link up with Essien, JT, John Obi, Malouda and Soloman Kalou really is a sight to behold. So many memories here - love all these boys very much and miss them dearly too!
Essien always that good 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The days of glory has gone..
I can now wipe my tears.
I swear this men are good then the current team wow
Loh loh.. legend persib juga main disitu ya essien😁😁
Our captain JT score in exactly 26 mins. WOW
we need the new obi mikel
We are chelsea SUPER CHELSEA no one likes us we don’t care we hate Arsenal and Tottenham well chase them anywhere🔵🔵
Why no Lampard?
Where is King Drogba 👑
can this lot play instead of our first team
Honestly evoked big emotions seeing Gary CH, JT, florent malouda, mikel essien, jon obi, jody morris, Gianfranco back in action has been the happiest moment as a Chelsea fan for years. Hope this wonderful club can bring this new generation of players to these hights
This is what made me fall in love with chelsea
I witnessed that pass from Zola Thanl God
Legenda persib
All the legends looks very fit..feeling emotional seeing legends on the pitch playing again..good old memories..give us some comfort comparing cunrrent  team now..
The current players are so selfish; I wish they become selfless like these legends, the team spirit is more than single player statistics.
Gosh I wish all of the players in Chelsea legends team can drink a youth serum to be at least 10 years younger so they can play again for the current Chelsea squad because unfortunately the current Chelsea team sucks.😢
Cahill with Terry at the back there, yah absolutely, you have goal getter besides that have striker.
thank you VIALLI❤❤
Ka persib deui mang essien  ,gening eta hade keneh 😂
John terry still has that captain, I like how he pushes the ball with confidence good ole days ❤
The most entertaining thing chelsea has done in a while
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Permainan Chelsea legend jauh lbh baik dr pada yg sekarang.. Semangat juang,mental juara sekarang tak ada lagi
Mikel one of our own. 9ija to the world 🇳🇬
Nice to see you  all play together again  Blue  for  life ❤❤❤❤
ViALLi! ViALLi! ViALLi!
Essien’s assist for the 4th goal is a CLASS 💯❤️
These guys put a smile to my face.
Where is duff , gudjohnson, deko, Shevchenko,  also black but also he is legend but he plays poth team de lux, le sux, desailly, and ex number 30 from Danish I can't right his name but I know his name lol😂 I start to support chelsea when I was young 2000 good lucky chelsea
Zola ❄️
Zola zola zola zola zola zola
the legends make a better chelsea, the whole current squad can even lose to this legends
Watching this makes you realise how far we’ve fallen. We’re in the trenches
Chelsea took it seious!! 😅
Full of emotions seeing legends playing 😭😭. A match worth watching. "Quality never fades" Hope our current team watched the match
My god...they pass, shoot, cross, defend and play better then our first team...
Is not about winning, but this legend play better than our current squad
❤❤❤❤❤ my lovely Club ever 💙💙💙💙💙💙🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
👍🏼👍🏻
To see Terry and Cahill score in one match😢
PERSIB BANDUNG LEGEND... MICHAEL ESSIEN
Our current team will definitely lose to these legends.
Serasa Chelsea Pas Lgi Jaya Jaya Nya  Ada Yg Kurang  Gg Ada'a Lampard & A Cole
These legends will beat our current team
I love you Chelsea
watching this match made me remember why I love this club so much💙
Please can our legends just play for us this season
Chelsea players now, need to learn a lot from previous Chelsea players, Chelsea must need senior players, there are five of them, so they can win the English league 😅👍💪🥰
I hope this current players will sit down and watch this legends play. Micheal Asien will remain a hero in Chelsea.
Sidemen are bigger than chelsea
The real chelsea, i feel the soul
ได้เห็นเหล่าตำนานเชลซี โคตรมีความสุขเลยครับ 💙
Mehnnn😢❤i almost cried watching the Chels team i fell in love with. Essien, captain JT, makalele, Peter cech, Very own John Obi, and on and on. Would've loved to see frankie and dideir too but my oh my. Feels like Chelsea again ❤💙
Chelsea legend Lawan squad Chelsea yg sekarang pasti menang
Grinning the whole time while watching this. Brought so many great memories. Legends never die...
Looks like the Chelsea team really trained. Look at their chemistry
Never die
Legend Persib tol
Que buen partifo mejor que los actuales lo disfrute mas que todos los 6 pasados del chelsea jajaja
I just cried with our legends line up😮‍💨
They should play to replace our current squad
These commentators are painful, watched the game earlier and it was some of the worst I’ve heard, getting facts wrong and just so drilling 🤣 ruined a really great evening
LEGEND PERSIB 🔵💙😁
Where is Mudryk? I was hoping to see him in the Chelsea's squad
❤
Chelsea is currently buying teenagers with Zero experience. This is the only Chelsea I know
Commentator really said “so kalou”😂
I totally agree.....these guys play so much better than the current squad😂
We need Terry and Cahill back
I miss the old blues. Mikel is still sharp.
Essien Legenda Persib
Chelsea legend look like FATHER😊 Bayern legend look like GRANDFATHER😂
Turn back time.. Chelsea players happy... Fans happy... Everybody happy with this moment...  Thank you Chelsea.. Thank you fans.. Thank you Vialli..RIP
Abramovich era💙
Chelsea is a finished club so bad that they are proud to post this 😭
The blues Indonesia 💙
Why is DIDIER DROGBA not HERE😡😡😡
Great to see these players back at Stamford Bridge 💙
MANTAB ESSIEN DIPANGGIL
The Chelsea I fell in love with 💙
The legends playing better than our squad now, I miss old Chelsea
Where is Lampard?
Hazard should joint it
John Obi Mikel incredible shape, he looks like 10-15y ago
💙💙💙💙💙
Same problem. No number 9 😂
Essien, please come back
Zola!❤❤
The legend
I  saw Mikel  obi training hard  on Instagram
They are playing better than the current team 😀
Hope our current squad and coaches get to watch this match over and over..they need to learn from this performance.
Chelsea ll never have any team like this again
So nostalgic. I remember playing these players on Playstation when I was in junior high.
Mikel can still play. Class is permanent.
I miss this kind of mentality
Our legends play better then Chelsea team now
ChelSea fans be like can't they play in the mainteam now 😂😂?
Drogba,,,,,? 😢
Los necesitamos urgentemente!! juegan mucho mejor que el equipo actual, no les llegan ni a los talones, damos pena
John Terry basically looks the same .
Michael Essien wear that Number 5, Even Ramires I done miss this guy I swear, Cahill Omo this guy na player I done miss the old Chelsea
I'm almost 100% sure that Essien scored a brace at least once for Chelsea.
None of the current boys will even make a bench in this squad
Salam dari PERSIB….ESSIEN
Chelsea legends are the great legend in the world right now. Tell me if i wrong.
Oh mikel man!!! Many  years now since you left and Chelsea hasn’t gotten your replacement 😢
I think the Ghana men’s soccer team still needs Michael Essien 😂 always a baller ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
What a night. Loved every minute of it. Poch should have sent all the first team to watch and soak up what it means to be a Chelsea player. Best feeling at the bridge for a while tonight. Thanks. Rip Vialli
They still have more passion for chelsea than our current first team 🫨❤️‍🔥💔😂
Kemana Gianfranco Zola...??
essien the legend persib  😁
Oww I wish this guys could play now
I hope our current team is inspired by this....
Better than the current squad. 😂😂
This was just wonderful
Better than the current team! 😂
💙💙💙
What a beauty to behold ❤🎉
This was fun to watch... Brought back memories
I hope our current squad was taking notes, we need these kinds of glory plays🔥🔥🔥
They can even beat current squad 3-0
So nostalgic. Brings back memories
Honestly more joy watching this than ive had in years now watching us, brought a tear to my eye and next level happiness in the soul. Thank you legends
Zola being Zola 😀
Where was drogba?
They are far better than the current team. Bring them back. Thank you JT and co. Sadl Drogbo was not available
I really hope this group of winners had a thing or two to say to the current squad members that are still at cobham.
I wish I can watch these legends than flogs
My favorite Chelsea game of the past two years :'). All my legends... so many names that made me fall in love with the game & Chelsea FC!!!
When was the last time we saw Chelsea score 4 goals in a Game?  That how low we went 😢  Kudos to the legends, what a game!  Those passes man, those finishes 🏆
Drogba Drogba where are youuu❤
Miss Didier Drogba
Our current squad is no match to this legendary team. So unfortunate 😢
Bumps 😊
This Chelsea team is better than their current one lol.
Legend😊❤
Wish lampard and Drogba played
Terry, Gary Cahill, Obi, essien look fitter than most of our current squad. I will play this Cahill over Disasi and obi over Enzo
Brings back so much memories ❤️
Essien still better than Enzo n caicedo fr😅
Where were drogba?
Not compltd without king Drogba
Nice to see a Chelsea team with some chemistry
Where was Drogba and Kante... great game and memories. 😊😊😊
The legend taught the core squad good and correct football playing lessons
Cahill from defending a corner to scoring a goal 💙
please switch Mudryk et al (2023) with this legend
This legends team would wipe the floor with your current squad 😂
Loved this 💙
Drogba,I missing you , If you com, you may score 6 or more goals.
so Emotional game!!💙✨
PERSIB LEGEND 😂
The only game Chelsea could won in this season 😂😂
Chelsea legend is still good Play
Over a billion spent and who knew all we needed to do to get back atop the table is resign a few club legends.
It's like just yesterday I was watching them play.  now they are part of the classic story.
Thanks for putting smiles to our fans again
Chelsea in Terry & Cahill era was a team where the defenders would step up and score goals if the attackers didn't manage to do so
Super frank???
It will be the trophy at the bridge this summer....
Essien legend persib😊
I hope this young guys are watching
bring back abrahamovic era.
รั่นใหญ่เล่นเป็นตัวอย่างให้ดูแล้วน่ะเด็กๆ
Tiago gol combination so amazing
Commentator's were foul with that Kalou comment 💀
This current Chelsea squad should be ashamed of themselves, I love as our legends make this our current squad understand what Chelsea is
so glad to see them, i wish there was Drogba, Lampard playing also and so many other legends like ashley cole, ballack, with all due respect but what is bertrand doing in the legends team ?! ok he was in the 2012 ucl team but still not a legend for me
Current Chelsea player's let them see this.   I am happy to see you guys
As a Chelsea fan, so emotional to watch this game. What a super entertaining game except missing the other two legends Drogba and Lampard.
Английские чиновники буквально вырвали футбольный клуб Челси с рук Романа , пожалуйста результат на лицо!!! Мучить будет долго и медленно , так что терпите этого Американца ☝️
Why did Drogba and Lampard not turn up for Chelsea legends?
essien persib
Miss our golden day with all of this legend
I have cried my eyes out 😭 on watching this video the glory days is gone 😢 this men played with passion and live for the game .. But now it's a whole different story Just look at Mikel 😫🥺🥺 very outstanding, i also saw john terry 😭😭🥺🥺 essien 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭 and many more
Where's Drogba?
Mikel at 4:18 What a player!!
Blue❤
❤
Old Chelsea better than new Chelsea 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
gallas 10x better than caicedo
Legends proud of everyone single one of them proud to be CFC Supporter
Terry scored at the 26th minute of the game. Thats Mr. Chelsea.❤
Not the legend team creating more chances and scoring more goals than our current team 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Malouda and Kalou was my favourite players... They were so underrated... But who cares they are European champions...
Class all round from the English, as usual. Paying respect to one of their own.
this is such a fifa moment, these "legends" icons play 100% better than what we have right now. its actually embarrassing for our current squad, they should watch and take notes.
CAPTAIN LEADER LEGEND JT26  🔥🔥
i think a Legend League should be made for football veterans of champions league winners
Essien chelsea and persib legend
That man with no 41 still active??
Been a while Chelsea made me smile...THANKS to these LEGENDS 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Can zola play tmr pls?
Mising drogba in strikee 😭😭😭
When will we ever witness this level of play from the current squad? These oldies were amazing on the field.
Swap this team with the current team
This got me emotional for real 🥲
As a chelsea fan I can say, WE WILL NEVER REACH THIS LEVEL OF TALENT AND LOYALTY OFF PLAYERS AGAIN.
These legends are better than our current players
I think some of them should come back to get us back to winning games
Ngl but this Chelsea team would slap the current squad 😂
I miss this Chelsea, the team's character is clear, looking at Chelsea now feels like I'm going to cry and I'm sad about Chelsea's current condition
I didnt see Drogba
JT : CAPTAIN LEADER LEGEND ❤❤❤
this is the chelsea i used to know
That Zola chip ❤
The best match by a Chelsea team in a long long while they can beat our first team now learn from them learn from them
,,
Essien could still play. Get him a trainer.
First tropy this season 🤘
can the legends team play for us instead of the normal team next prem game
Ramires with a moustache makes zero sense
'Nessun dorma' before the start was epic.   And a fitting occasion for the great man.
What a match❤
They are still soooo good
I JUST WANT TO CRY AND THANK ABRAMOVIC FOR GIVING US SUCH LEGENDS. ID BE HAPPY IF THEY CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT AND REPLACE OUR FEMBOYS ON THE PITCH
This is basically the 2012 UCL final replay lol
Mikel is an insane midfielder...
Gotta get Fernando Torres back into these games
Great to see some older boys, Sinclair, Jon Harley, Jody Morris, Lebeouf and even Hutchinson! These were the guys playing when I started supporting Chelsea! And imagine if we had Cahill-Terry-Gallas as our back three! All goal scoring centerbacks! 💙
This is amazing game , our legend team is more than current squad what problem
Chelsea legends play better than chelsea first real currently I won’t lie
Tiago very wonderful goal, up Chelsea , wonderful legends ❣️💜♥️
Gianluca Viallli a gentleman on and off the field…God bless you Vialli we love you…in our hearts forever 💙💙💙
WaAh mantap ada mantan pemain persib yang main
Permainan pemain legend chelsea lbh bagus dari squad chelsea yg sekarang
Fifa which approved old men sports
Goosebumps 😅
That girl with hijab 🥰🥰
Where's Drogba?
I'm sure if John Terry and Gary Cahill were still playing for Chelsea, they would be better than the ones currently in the team.😂👍🏼
These legends are better than the current squad of the club.
This da team that make me a die heart Chelsea FC fans..😢❤ Now days man get only heartbroken watching this my new Chelsea team.
I wish we could have them all back 😭😭
This guys are young
Better in a million ways than the current chelsea squad
Fighting back tears...what's not to say about this match....Mikel oh Mikel!!! Imagine pairing his passes with Enzo's. I didn't ever believe I would see Ramires look unfit, that guy never stopped running. Zola just so amazing...Tiago underrated. Where was Ballack?❤❤❤
no drogba ?
Zolaaaaaaaaa 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
This is the Chelsea team we all recognize, the passion, the elite mentality & the never give up mentality.  Our Legends kept the blue flag flying high 💙💙💙
Legendary Chelsea  team is good🔥🔥
Beautiful 💙
Wtf? Where's Drog? 😒😒😒
Terry and Essien could definitely still play for Chelsea 💯🔥🔥🔥
This our Chelsea legends can win against most current English teams that our current squad is struggling to win against. We missed ya'll
Essien,PERSIB INDONESIA 🇮🇩
cant believe thiago silva is older than gary cahill. thiago silva longevity in top football is crazy
Thanks Legends for all those beautiful Chelsea memories 💙 great players ❤
Mấy Ông già mà đá hay hơn lớp trẻ bây giờ
Obi Mikel❤
😢😢i wish the new baby's learn from old lengandary
💙
Haha, imagine having Ramires and Essien in the same team at their primes (before you say it, Essien was a few years past his by the time Ramires hit his)   they'd have run teams absolutely ragged.  had them begging for a break.
I just hope the new boys picked up a thing or two from the match... Legends... ❤
Aya pemain PERSIB euy 😮
Am having goose b1umps all over me watching the Chelsea I grew up supporting.
This was beautiful to watch
Lifelong Celtic fan but Chelsea have been my English club since the 90's. Worshipped Zola.
Essien legend persib
Même la vieillesse fait mieux que la jeunesse actuelle en victoire
เล่นให้เด็กมันดู ว่าของจริงเขาเล่นยังไง
I really enjoyed our legend
Miss Didier Drogba❤️
Essien the bison from PERSIB😃😃😃
Retired legends play better than our current squad
Drogba😞
just a taste of how good we use to be
We should resign Cahill
Tears of joy just dropping from  my eyes. I really miss these men
I didn't see the ferocious striker that Chelsea once had, Mr Didier Drogba. I really missed him scoring goals and celebrating
This is the definition of once you know it you know it forever.
Lampard and drogba? 😢
I just cry 😢😢😢 seeing my favourite players playing 😢😢
get the elders in the first team, way better than what we currently have
Still better than chrlsea nowaday😢
Dimana drogba yves tebilly dan frank james lampard
I miss this team😢
Good old days.. Tiago Mendez just like Joax Felix
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ตำนานน่าดูกว่าปัจจุบันอีก
The current squad must watch this
The Bison
Mikel is still a baller
Watching this game we need to bring MOST OF THEM back 😂  Sorry Kalou and Mikel, never liker them 😂
Where r drogba and lampard wiz out them this team is not complete
Imagine Didier Drogba playing this game, it could have been more than this❤🥵🔥🔥
Miss this Chelsea❤
This match would’ve been so special to go to and see the Chelsea team of my childhood one last time. Amazing to see the likes of Essien, Makelele, Kalou etc again and obviously John Terry too
Miss this Chelsea❤
where is drogba?
Pochechinho has to think about M . Eessine. Surely if we played with this team last year, we could have be much in a better place. The cross from ramerus to essine and the current Ben chiliwell every weekend. Probably it could be overhead kik or goal kick. RIP Luka
This was so fun to watch.  Lot of creativity and technicality.  We love u our LEGENDS
We need to resign them
11:53 "if you can't have a first touch, you won't have a career" Lukaku and morata disagree
Look how easy the transition is I hope these current guys watch how easy you pass and move
Can they making this an annual event?
One of these days azpi will be here😂
Needs to be a Statue of Vialli Outside The Bridge
THATS HOW PLAY FOOTBALL 😡😡😡😡😡😡
pemain PERSIB hebat euy ngagolkeun...
Essien legend persib to 💙
We want them back 😂😂😂
so mikel is still so fresh and cool...terry and cahill doesn't get old at all..essien is still a beast, ramirez, malouda and kalou are ageing well why is there no drogba or lampard?
Would've been better if they wore old kits
What a positive atmosphere! We need that in our current squad.
Essien legenda persib😅
Blue is the Colour! ❤
Drogba
I even enjoy watching this legends than this current boys
Mikel Esien man of the match
More please
Hope the Chelsea guy home watching how they suppose to play with passion
It's sad how my Chelsea will never be a top 4 club again
❤❤❤❤❤Good ❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t wait to see Hazard and Drogba back too
Michael Essien looks sharper than Gallagher
John Terry Still Iron Man
I swear, this legend Chelsea team can beat the current Shitty Chelsea team 6-0 so easily
The great wall of JT and Cahill still great and beast, next legends please invite super frankie, king drogba, deco, el nino, and eden garden 🥳
JT leading the squad again with Cech behind him…😢
That last goal was madtt
26💙
Bravo to our Legends 💙💙💙
Lovin’ it ! 💙
Beautiful game of football... Thank you guys for what you gave us 🥳🎉🎊
Our hero legendary john terry💙💙💙
Germans taking only Ls today. Japan just cooked Germany too.
Sumon aj pemain lejennya gantiin yg di EPL wkwk
Terry scoring in the 26th minute was just poetic 💙
We need take this premer league
Mikel 👏👏👏
We all needed this as Chelsea fans. Something to make us smile. I hope our current players are taking note.  Sometimes I forget how lucky I was to watch Chelsea's ever greatest period in history as a kid.  RIP Luca
They should make a Legends League with regular matches throughout the year, sort of like the Champions League format, maybe a game once or twice a month and with 11 substitutions. 1/2 of the revenue should go to charities, and there should be a serious prize pool.
John Terry 2023 >>>>>>> Harry Maguire
Ex Persib Bandung Essien still on fire
Wawawawawa what a gane
We cannot forget our great players.  The current team should learn from the legendary players
Chelsea we will return back💪
John obi mikel is a legend
too much legends, I could cry, happy they're wearing blue again, can't believe we have so much class players back then
Shame A. Cole, Lampard, Ivanovic and J.Cole wasn't involved
I just hope our current squad can learn a lot from the game of the legends. This game made me wish to turn back the hands of time and relive the glorious moments of Chelsea days.😢😢
This match brings back so many good memories. Memories of how our team can score from every player from every position. I missed so much how lethal our defender is. Not just for defending but also scoring some goals.
Mamang essien 🎉
Our Current Squad should learn tactics from Legends!
this is the best defensive football ive seen chelsea play in a while
Ada legend persib woyy 😂
Gallas is not a Chelsea legend.
Youngsters needa take notes
레전드 매친데 첼시 스타팅 젊다 ㅋ
Ada legend PERSIB. 😍💙💙
Can our legends play in EPL instead ? 😮
THE TEAM OF LEGENDS WAS THE BEAST AT THE TIME...👏👏👏😁👍
What hell...this Chelsea legends play  better than the current squad
These Chelsea legends play more and better than diz current Chelsea squad...what a sweet n beautiful goals
I think we only need moriniho back and we good to go boli spend 1 billion and we have only scored 3 goals   Replace the current squad with this legends
Chelsea legend should come out of retirement to save the team.  Makelele turn is magic.
The Chelsea l know 😢❤
wish Hazard was there😢
Nice to see Chelsea winning in Stamford bridge again
The Chelsea I know
Are legends are playing as though they have been playing together for long. They are more in sync than our current squad of players.
Please let's bring Ramires and Essien back to our midfield 😊
Where is roman abramovich?😢
Imagine mikel in this current Chelsea squad
Amazing 💙
This squad is cooking the current team lmao
What a game! Pochettino should learn a lot from this match and put things in order. This is Chelsea fc..and this is what we do. Winning is in our DNA
😢my mikel
These young lads should learn from the old lads
Good Lord. Chelsea men still look thesame
Good to see Chelsea win a game at the Bridge
Beautiful 🎉
Yg ini jelas the best
Reminiscing on the great old time
The Chelsea that I know 😢💙
These legends will beat current Man City
I think this will boost the morale of our present team. well done champs so happy to see you guys together once again
Our Roman's Army. The goals and the way they played, is telling (and teaching) the current squad what it means to play for Chelsea and how you should play for Chelsea!
Once again! Defenders scoring goals for Chelsea lol
Excellent football love you legends
Should've shown the halftime performance.
RIP vialli
Is better we use these legend team to play the remaining matches of the season than these yahoo boys that only know how to do hairstyles
Where's Drogba
This brought a huge smile on my face. Men I'm getting old fast. RIP Vialli
I really miss this Chelsea's side
stamford bridge smile again..
Essien can come playing for our 1st squad and he will be playing 90 minutes all season next to enzo
Half these guys would walk into our first team
this squad at this age would do better than our current squad
essien still looks class lma0
Michael Essien ❤🇬🇭
What a header from Essien
I couldn't stop smiling throughout the entire video. 🥹
Gallas thé black Santa 😊❤.  Lovely tribute to a wonderful man ❤
Good to see the legend back at the bridge
Current squad plz take note of this legend ply
Michael Essien🐐💪
You are reminding me of how I was happy in the past years , but now , 😮😮😮😮
Where's Drogba
Where is Frankie Lampard??? Thats a Legend too.🤔🤔🤔
the real blus
where is Joe Cole and Ashley Cole though..with them in the squad, it would be complete
What about drogba
Smiles all through 😊❤
This brings a tear to my eye, it's sometimes easy to forget the impact players like Malouda, Ramires and Kalou had at this club, all three are very underrated.
Wow iii seeing our legend back on the field, I'm so happy, once a legend always a legend 💞💞💞
This will effect our next performance
Mikel is still excellent 🔋❤️
The game of the legend team was better than the main team. What if we just exchange? 😅😅
These legends make me recognise my Club😊💙💙
Seeing these faces reminds me of the Chelsea I knew, loved and supported back in the days. After quite some years despite being legends, they still play good like yesterday. I wish to see our current team bouncing back to be the Chelsea of 2012 and the likes. Much love for our legends. BLUUUEEE💙💙💙💙
where is hazard and Lampard
We miss this play
11:07 the vision, the timing and the clinical our current squad don't have
C.C.G.V.T😮😊❤
Why wasn’t drogba playing
🔥🔥🔥Blue Army Legends🔥🔥🔥  💙💙💙⚽🏆🙏👑💙💙💙
The only way Chelsea can win a game 💀💀💀
I'm in love with this legend
I’m happy too see our fans smile again, when was the last time we smile or celebrate like this , look at that remires cross for Essien if was Ben children he will over hit the cross
I know many people will have commented this already but: can we have all of them back?
클린스만 없어서 졌네 뮌헨 팬들 화났겠다
i miss chelsea like this
I wish this is the chelsea we could get now
Chelsea and trophies..........hope this new generation is watching this!
Mamang Essien masih inget Persib Bandung ga ya?
NOOSTALGIAAA! SOO MANY MEMORIES WITH THESE LEGENDS OF OUR BEAUTIFUL CLUB!
Good to see these guys back. Thanks for the memories. We are grateful. See Mikel as if he never left. Makele, Essien and Terry with the intimidation and fear we use to give opponent at the Stamford bridge. Not all this bunch of lazy players we have now who are not ready to sacrifice and play for Chelsea Fc badge. Chelsea shall be great again💪
Where is my dangerous Drogba!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
zolaa🔥
😢 We need these squard back to the Stamford bridge
Persib legend 😂
What a moment!
Brilliant 😅
Football is all about first touch … if you don’t have a first touch. You won’t have a career
Where Is HAZARD ??
Now this is the blues I use to know
Chelsea legend more young
I just love Chelsea..Essien is a beast
wow I enjoyed this game this guys played with to much love of the club 👏
Where’s Lampard and drogba
mantan pemain persib cetak gol 🤣
RIP to Gianluca our Legend. This our legends match has broken all the obstacles and curse in our current squad and it has impacted that winning mentality back again, believe this all the beloved Chelsea fans. I see winnings, thumps up if you believe this
Better than Chelsea line up this season
Why was Drogba not part of the squad?
Legend Persib masih bisa main di Stamford Bridge ❤️❤️
They are old but intelligent ☺
Terry .. captain fantastic 💙💙.
This happines was missing for soo looong to bring joy on us the Chelsea fans I dont know how to respond to cry or smile🎉😊😀😄😢😅😶😔😪😬
100 times better than current cfc... Come back legends
They are old but intelligent ☺
Just brilliant 💙
Finally we see the real chelsea 😭
Great goal from JT, did good in knowing how to set it up
Been so long since I smiled this much watching Chelsea play
Amazing
The only reason I don’t complain cause all the players in the Chelsea 23 squad are upcoming players
Beautiful 🤩
Class is Permanent
Nostalgia Squad Team Jhon Terry 🎉🎉🎉
I'm not crying
Essien masih gacorrr
Enakan senior emang diliatnya wkwk
only joy well have this fn season.... and theres still people thinking Pochettino could do anything ... ffs!!!
Essien - the bison ✅
I honestly thought Bridge got invitedand was going to make a guess appearance, team up with Terry, and score a goal😊😅
were any current players watching?
This is WAY Better than our current SQUAD
Gary cahill playing like John stones 😂😂
Where were Lampard and Drogba
A better football from Chelsea at last in a very long time. See the winning mentality. They just want to win. Not some boring 3 at the back passing around for 90mins with nothing to show for it.
N. Jackson, I hope you're watching
Essien legend persib coy
Chelsea in the mud
I think Di-Mateo should have been the one coaching the Current Chelsea Fc team
Ghana must call back Essien
Gets these players in take out the current squad
2:42 that Ramires cross was better than any of our current wingers crosses
Вот это я понимаю! Даже сейчас выглядят лучше,чем нынешний Челси
Woowow..my team
I miss my Chelsea😢 Current team must learn what Chelsea mean against its Rivals!
Mikel still a baller
Lovely 💙
I’m very happy to see all this brilliant players back to Stamford Bridge their beloved Club and wear this CFC Famous jersey on and display their talent in front of Blues fans showing to the fans that they still care and love this amazing Club ok   in them is still that desire and pride of fighting for the badge and win games and trophies something not the same with our current Team they lack desire and pride of winning games and make their fans happy ok    PRIDE OF LONDON 💙💙💙  Thank you to all of you ex Blues players for turning up for this game and once again making us Blues fans all happy because we been missing this momentum for a while now 🤔
Why need this men to play for Chelsea instead this young guys we have
Bayer weren't trying
No disrespect to the current team, I want this team against Bournemouth.
Just like everyone is saying in the comments section. These legends are better than this current side.
Zolaaaaaa 🔥
Pure fun...i wonder why DD wasn't around.....
Forget Medals  Forget Trophies , Forget the Score ! Chelsea Legends are in my opinion the best football legends , they are the reason 90% of Chelsea fans are Chelsea fans, Chelsea Legends are so great that i don't care if we are in poor form right now , it only makes it sweeter knowing people will point to the legacy of our legends more often because of it
Legends doing it again JT goal was crazy 💙💙 that his style.
Absolutely Epic!
I guess our current team will start performing very well now, because seeing these legends again together has a lot to do spiritually. I must tell you, the feelings is so amazing.
I was smiling through out the video. Tears man. How i missed them
Watched all through with a big smile on my face and teary eyes of nostalgia missing the good 'ol days 🥲
Even the legends are performing wonders... blue is the colour
Our legends>>>>>>>>
This only made me angry with the current squad
That Essien pass 😊
Đội già đá còn chuyên hơn đội hiện tại
Michael Essien one of our own 💙💪🏾🇬🇭
💙💙💙
We missed you guys
Best Chelsea game in 2 years...
This is the Chelsea FC i grew up watching. Winners. Leaders. Soldiers. Brothers. From the Heartbreak of 2008, the Double winning season in 2010 and the Ultimate Glory of 2012. These players symbolize the Chelsea i fell for in high school in 2007/08. I hope these days return.
Mikel - controller Defenders taking initiative Kalou being kalou hahaha Its amazing to see the legends maintain their individual personalities while on the ball
This is the reason I love this club
That was emotional as much as it was legendary ❤
💙💙💙
What a pass Jan frank Zola legend
They play good football 😉
I really miss this squad wow😍😍
my club💙
Sigue jugando tremendos cracks
Stamford bridge so loud never seen it so loud this is really sad
Great game there ❤❤❤❤
I hope this will be a stepping stone from our problem
The match brought back old memories
Michael Essien rolling back the years with a lung busting run into the box and finishing with a header! ..  Zola still got them defence splitting passes and Salomon Kalou .. still missing open goals..  😂
Thiago is not a legend yet 😅
I'm happy to see my legendary player's on Chelsea Jessey again 😊❤😍🥰👍. LOVE and Miss u guys so much 😊😊😊
First win at the bridge 😂
I so miss my Chelsea!!
drogba should’ve been present
I love this. Amazing really ❤
All hail Chelsea 🙌,,, our legends still got it, Michael essein still thesame ❤
Vialli was a huge part of the start of the good times coming to the Bridge. Shame that's long over now we've got a joke of a board, overrated kids and coaches who do nothing but keep the ball only to lose to teams that actually do something with 25% of the possession, but it's great to see these old warhorses back on the pitch. Essien's knees are made of Blu Tack and he'd still run himself into the ground for us.
I guess its in our dna right now. Our forwards missed the sitters then defender and midfielders scoring goals 😂
Love it! we could do with some of these players in the current squad!💙
Go on Terry
NOSTALGIA!
Zola looks tiny
omg cech!! <3
Legend aja ikutan epl lagi ,yang sekarang pada kurang😢
❤
Where is our King? King Drogba
Amazing match to be a part of!❤
Still better than 23/24 squad 😅
Best ever than now
way much better than current team
Maybe these guys should replace the current ChelseaFC team 💙
I should have watched this game in Stamford Bridge instead of the Forest game
Great to see our legends back at the bridge though Didier Drogba is missing😂
💙
It felt like the good ol days
So Kalou
💙💙💙💙
Mikel is still balling 💙💙💙💙
Is it me or what ,i am having so much joy watching our OGs playing sweet football ,chelsea culture 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
This John Terry is better than all Manchester united defensive.  Believe me 😂😂
miss u legend 😌
This gameplay is much better than Chelsea now era lmao
Bring back 😫 them to primere 😢
What a beautiful smiling for me today😂😂😂 This is Chelsea I want❤❤❤
😂😂 what a night🎉🎉🎉
Bet the current team took a couple of lessons from these legends and avoid all that shitty football
💙💙💙💙💙💙
So much joy watching this match. This is what football is about
Ha Essien; class
Amazing to see the stadium full💙
They are better than our new squad
I’m a Liverpool fan 🚩🚩 Really i missed Lampard 💙& Drogba 💙
Those Chelsea ledges need too show the Chelsea team today how to win
I really hope our current team could learn hw to play like dis ... dis is lovely 💙💙
This is Chelsea my club not what is happening recently
I'm literally tearing up from the memories man, what a game😭🔵🔵
Tuyệt vời ❤❤❤
Why do the legends play so much better together than the actual current squad
Thiago goal was amazing❤
Always winning Trophy....Our DNA
Comeback old Chelsea
Lindo y hermoso volver a ver a esa estrellas y jugadores que formaron parte del CHELSEA.
This will not be the only trophy in Stamford Bridge this season.   Amen
Where’s Lamps?
TIME TO RISE LIKE GOOD OLD DAYS... COME ON POCH... WE BELIEVE YOU
Cant they play instead😢
I missed them
Tiago was filthy with that chip😫
The batch just shined after JT scored. Wow man that kit did justice to the our legends 🥹🥹
Please who's children are they
ESSIEN LEGEND PERSIB BANDUNG💙🇮🇩
Zola always smiling when he's playing. What a game legends. Thank you for this. I hope this isn't the only silver we're holding up this season. RIP Vialli
😊
15 years later, Kalou still misses easy goals🤣🤣🤣
Essien legend persib bandung ❤🎉
The old guys looks better than the current team 😂
This video made me cry happy tears x
Best chelsea team ever on one pitch!! I moss every single one of these guys! Honestly, I say put them back on the first team. They can still play. I'm the premier league, and maybe we would get some wins!!
These Chelsea legends would finish above this current lot in in the Premier league
This is soo beautiful🥹
This is what legends are, BLUES 💙💙💙 FOR LIVE
I miss this 😢😢
Football will never change
Miss Chelsea  legend..
Where is Drogba?
Ooooh I love this club...you brought us the 2012 screaming memories...Ramires totally changed,Obi time still Obi time
these lot are directly walking into our team
Can someone explain me where Drogba is?😢
Bohly, we need our Old chelsea
Chelsea legend vs chelsea curent 1rst team😂😂😂
Absolutely brilliant!
Better than our current players
John Terry my Legend
Former Persib Bandung score a goal, mamang Essien😍💙
What an assist from Essien 💙🤍
My my my......a'ved watched the match goddamn feels like yesterday these legends still got that chelsea swagger....holy smokes i nearly forgot our current squad 😂......well done legends❤❤❤ much love from Kenya
This match reminds me of the Chelsea I fell in love with and supported... The Chelsea where our defenders score for fun... This match should be a challenge to our present squad. If they wish to write their names in GOLD like our legends have done, then they have a lot of catching up to do. In summary, our present squad needs to step up... Always Chelsea...❤❤❤
This made my heart so happy. 💙💙💙💙💙
Mikel doing some wonderful touches
Legend👍👍👍
These are men. Our current squad is composed of boys. The problem is the aforementioned men were already men at the same age as the aforementioned boys.
Next match in Allianz arena bayern must play with rooben ribery sweisterger lahm for equilibre the match
Lampard should've joined; all legends. Great game!
Omo when youre good youre good Doesn't matter how old you are
i will be happy with this squard,than  the squard we have now
our legends never disappoint 😭🐐
The most iconic squad. Why cant we win like this in the prem
Legendary match with legendary players ❤
Hopefully this will be an encouragement for current Chelsea players to get back up again.
Chels 💙🛶
The current squad need to take a long hard look at how these guys are still playing even after being out of the game for so many years
This team of legends plays much better than current 1st team
I’m in tears watching our boys ❤
Just smiling ☺️
Amazing ❤ but where was Didi? 😢
We need these guys back at Chelsea 😊
Ramires 😦
Absolutely did not recognize Ramires with hair
Where is Drogba 🤔💪💪
Poch ought to make sure our current squad were on the sidelines with their notepad to jot down these legendary moments. ❤😂😅
To Vialli ❤
It really does brighten my mood ❤❤😅
Am sure this old men will beat this present squad, see their connection and love for to play football
I can assure you of one thing... If there's a match between these awesome legends and the current Chelsea squad, the score line would favour the legends.  Essein is still buzzing Mikel is just awesome Terry and Cahill what a partnership Ramirez is giving that champions league vibe Assists were so on point
Petition for our legends to play for us against bonemouth 😭
Surprised Hazard wasn't playing.
I love essien and John Terry ❤
Chelsea we use to know 💙🔵
I am crying
Play for us now please 😂💙
Mikel and essien still got it
Chelsea Legends 💙🔥
All smiles on my face watching this game something we've missed to see in the current squad
To be honest seeing this chelsea team playing again got me a bit emotional... God know how much I miss the glory days...I hope one day I can get that happiness back again
First to comment 😂
Lol what was that Bayern team. Guess couldn’t get the other better players in ehh.
Missing Lampard and Drogba
Where's Hazard 😔🤔😁
💙💙💙
U could see aside individual brilliant, there's also a great team work.
I'm not even gonna lie... Those assists is something we've barely see in years lol   Wow
Terri always score
I really enjoyed this so much
If I was Poch despite any International duties every player on my squad would have been at this match. I would tell Boehly to round them all up.
Legends chelsea:match against Bayern ?😅😅 Current Chelsea:match against Bayern? 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️😭😭
we need Hutchinson in our team
Drogba would have made this complete gg
Essien
Mikel pass to Kalou was good
Good game from the legend, I think they are better than these present weak team... up Blues 💙💙
The last time Chelsea scored 4 was in March 2022 😢😅
Lovely❤❤
Brought tears to my eyes... I wish I could have been there live...
Tears comes streaming down your face 😍🙂🙂
The ones that made me chose blue 😢💙💙💙💙
And Drogba?? 😢
These Legends need to have a word with our current squad
These men play fantastic football more than our lads
The nostalgia!  These guys are ageless
Swap this with current squad
Are we sure we can't field this lot against Bournemouth next week?
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I miss my old chelsea
Tiagos long range against Man U will be one of the best goals in our history
It's amazing to see the legends in the blue jersey again 💙🤍
Chelsea 💙💙💙
All goals were beautiful 😍
They’re beating our current team no doubt
Me smiling at this team
Something to be happy about 🥰🥰 it’s been a while I’ve felt this happy about Chelsea
John Terry still looks young🔥
How are these legends able to shoot from Distance and the old and current Chelsea team can’t even shoot from Distance!
That might be the only trophy we see at the Bridge this season 🥹
Now you know why they are tagged LEGENDS 🙌 💙💙💙
Where is Drogba?! Where is Lampard?!
Mikel is just one amazing midfielder 😮
The sky is blue 💙🔵🎉🎉
Eso merece otra champions
Our midfielders was scoring goals, can’t say enough for these ones!

These legends can also beat our current team 4-0
Best team
