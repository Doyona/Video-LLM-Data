See the name Heathcliff and my ass thinks of the mandela catalogue 😭😭 I LOVE THE DOLL THO 😍😍
am i the only one who thinks he looks like karkat vantas
I’ve not watched dollightful since about 2021 and Oml I loved coming back to watch her again
This video was two years ago!? I feel like it came out this year god time really went fast
He needs a girlfriend
"How long have you been 17?"  "A year and a half."  All the art in the end credits is commission
Is it weird that I kind of ship him and Ember? 😅
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HEATHCLIFF!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
His mouth does not make him look like a vampire it makes him look awkward 😢 like he is about to eat a sandwich
Oh my spookiest tales of Halloween night, Heathgliff the vampire looks AWESOME! He is one awesome supernatural vampire! Also I love his outfit, at first the concept outfit's you design would look great on him, 1:14 even the other jacket's, but I was like no, too modern, as for the other jackets, no it would make him famous pop vampire guy, so the jacket you made takes the bleeding heart cake.❣🍰  Maybe next year if you want to make a Pumpkin Witch doll, Hazariel Costumes made a complete costume that looks all pumpkin, have a safe & happy Halloween Dollightful.
Maybe he's already got a good dose of lore, but I think it would be pretty cute if the original outfit got repurposed- and Heathcliff got a little brother? Since he's got the biker jacket, maybe he rides a motorcycle and his younger brother rides a regular bike, cause he wants to be like his big brother. They're so cute
bro looks like a Karkat, darkmode-Jackfrost and mashal lee lovechild and i say this with the most love an early tumblr girlie can muster
you know you did a good job with the faceup when you think he's handsome while he's still bald
The doll looks like the type to say “where my hug at?”
OMG I USED TO WATCH YOU WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE GHOST DOLL VID IM SO GLAD I FOUND YOUR CHANNEL
I have three vampire characters: Valentina, Augustine, and Evie. Val and August are besties and coworkers; Val is a supermodel while August is her photographer. Both of them are what I like to call "traditional" vampires, meaning they drink blood to survive. Val uses her job to lure the creeps from her profession and drains them dry, storing blood in casks like wine. Augustine goes to gay bars and targets the creepy guys trying to hit on the girls. Valentina can transform into a vine snake (judgmental shoelace) and August goes for a classic vampire bat.  Evie is an oddball. She's a Fruitpire- a subspecies that are derived from fruit bats. They are seen as "lesser" by the Traditional vampires and she believes she's the last of her kind. Memory and Light vampires are also ostracized, but not to the same degree as Fruit. She's cheerful, sweet, and so very optimistic, and will happily share her bag of lemon slices with you! Her bat form is, of course, a small fluffy fruit bat!
This is the manicure of a killer Bella
Honestly, if Dollightful made a comic about these characters in their own universe, just doing what ever. I'd absolutely read it
10:11 JUSTICE FOR THE 80’S POOF
Gosh seeing the Banshee is so nostalgic. Heathcliff turned out so well
Halloween doll requests:  Frankenstein’s monster from all the discarded limbs or a giant spider/snake monster!
So following a comment I just saw, we need a hunter boyfriend/girlfriend/bestie for Heathcliff! At one point, they were trying to kill each other, but now they’re friend/lovers!
8:58 In hindsight: he is so kpop demon hunter coded
You could make the worlds best David Bowie goblin king doll
I could watch and listen to you all day not like most off the others  they are so annoying   you are my favorite ❤❤❤❤❤
She should make k-pop demon hunters!!!!! Edit: And she should make her own cartoon with then and make a series with the Halloween dolls, and then one with the candy dolls that she’s making and then one like with summer dolls.
Is it just me or I ship Heathcliff and the demon girl [I forgot her name ] they look so cute together in the drawing
Katherine he looks so much like like B-Negative I swear-
He’s amazing 🔥Do you have patterns for the outfit?
The mouth look so cool
You should lowkey design for Fortnite
He honestly reminds me of vampire Pete Wentz, from the music video of A Little Less Sixteen Candles A Little More “Touch Me” lol
You really nailed the 'cute boy' look. I was TWEAKING OUT when I saw the finished doll and all the art 😫
Heh. Nips   9:26
i got gender envy from this doll
hes lowk fine
I know this video is old but he looks a lot like gerard way during 2004/2005😭
Jason dean
I feel like him and Amber would be a cute couple
Ik this is from a year ago but hear me out all the Halloween dolls
You are so funny, Dollightful!
So cool!! I love these videos   I think he needs a sister
I have ocd so yes,the line does bother me
Bro would be perfect for draculora vampire theme lol
Katherine hasn't done a male doll in so long I thought this was an old video, how am I only seeing this now????
I would give my soul to see you make him a chupacabra partner for him next year 😭 that would be such a cute couple
Katherine I don't know if you have a plan yet for this year's Halloween doll, but I think you should make another cryptid! Perhaps...the mothman🪰🪰🪰
ik this vid is old but like every time i see/watch this video, all i can think of is… huening kai. why does he kind of look like him PLSS ITS SO SILLY I LOVE IT
you could've made the line a scar
Currently binge watching your videos! Love it.
omg.. this year he should receive a zombie lover
I miss wendigo ;((
I have a suggestion. What if you made a zombie character  or a Frankstein's monster next? I would love to see what you come up with if you choose those character suggestions.  😁
6:52 not a criticism at all, this just triggered the nerd in me.  skin is actually semi translucent, it’s not like glass, but you’re able to see someone blood flow through it, this is why when you cut off blood flow your skin appears more pale and yellowish, and why you can clearly see bruises which are essentially just small pools of blood caused by small blood vessels being bursted.  another thing, still not a criticism, especially since it wasn’t even an intended design element, but just for anyone who may be interested, post-mortem, skin gets more gray and cool toned because of the lack of blood flow, so a vampire would really be either gray or necrotic (fully black/purplish), since they’re not necessarily rotting. even zombies would actually just be a very cool and dark gray. but, of course, the appearance of a corpse majorly depends on the environment, the person and how they died.  again, this isn’t a criticism, i’m just a nerd and wanted to share.
1:36 gave me Ezra vibes from Friday night Funkin , I don't know why I think it was the outfit.
"i vant to shoot sum hoops" (i vant to suck your blood)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤣🤣🤣🤣
He needs a normie nerd boyfriend NOWWWWW 😭😭😭🙏🙏
That grab was a jump scare
i would have LOVED to play with this doll as a kid
I want her to do a vampire lord like in Skyrim. She showed it in the video too. Ugh that’d be so cool
17:07 ok Can we just have like a shorts story with this trio of friends I feel like it would be really cool and silly to see them just hanging out
9:27 lmao i didnt knew it had nipples painted too
13:04, I love this pose because it looks like he's showing off his new outfit. 🧥🦇
I love him! he's so cheeky it's awesome! I picture him voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch haha!
Why am I in love with a doll...
Valentine from monster high g1 actually would've been a perfect base for this, but the doll is so gorgeous
I love him he gives me Marshall Lee from adventure time vibes!!
I’m half way through and I LOVE it already.
Your doll vampire heathcliff so handsome. 😍😍😍
And Frank is also a classic monster and you wouldn't love to see
y'all think he was emo in the 2000s
HE LOOKS LIKE KARKAT VANTAS I LOVE HIM <3333
The second she started glueing on the hair-wefts I was like-  ''Oh my god, she's made muzan!!!'' Lol
Kinda reminds me of Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians 😅
I feel like he now needs a boyfriend who is the opposite of him
10:08 its funny how much he looks like me at this moment
It would be so cool if he got a Christmas boyfriend this year 😢
I know i am a year late but does anyone else think he kinda works as Ember’s boyfriend?
I think for Easter you could make him a human boyfriend that wears pastel clothes and cutesy fashion style
Why does it look like he's dating Ember? Oh my God, I love it. Even if they're not dating, that is amazing. Looking friendship too oh my God, I love it.❤❤❤❤
for 2025s or 2026s halloween video maybe you can do a zombie doll, i feel like youd be able to create something amazing!!
Missing wendigo
I think this might’ve been the first time I’ve ever seen a doll and went “would”
It’s giving emo Jack Frost 🖤
Maybe in your next Halloween project, how about do a Frankenstein character. U have Gen 3 frankie so I was curious to see what u will use her for. Maybe this?
I loved the first design just without the cape. It would be cool to make multiple outfits for photoshoots.
I feel like Heathcliff and Amber would date or smth
Ngl he kinda hot don’t judge me that’s what you were going for right? He looks totally like a Vampric Badboy ❤
Don't know if anyone else has mentioned this, but he's giving be modern Hanako-Kun vibes from Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun
Why am I getting the pokemon you make nerdycrafter vide
Headcannoning that hes into ember but lowkey scared of her dad so he doesng say anything
It's Jack Frost's goth twin 😂 i love his design ackh
do you perhaps know a novel that goes by wuthering heights? just curious about something
Exactly what this world needs: A vampire frat boy named after 2 candy bars. I love him!
He needs a plague doctor bf
Heh, there are 666k views
He's for the gays i can just tell
This artist really got me swooning over a doll damn
OH NO HES HOT
I CLICKED THE THUMBNAIL BECAUSE THE VAMPIRE LOOKS LIKE MY TYPE LOL
Hear me out…….
3:15 It looks like grandpa escaped from the home again
Ember x Heathcliff when?
Okay but ripping off the head snakes right next to open razor blades was hard core
Hear me out.
I came back to watch this, but if you want to harden up a doll head without shrinking it much if at all use alcohol, the typing used on wounds.
I don't know where this idea came from, but Heathcliff would be Ember boyfriend
Maybe you could make your own interpretation of Frankenstein next?
Amazing!🤩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What about Frankenstein’s monster?
I can’t be the only one who thought that Heathcliff and Ember would make a great couple or just be amazing friends.
Why he kinda......
This will go on my hear me out cake, thank you very much 😜
😢i miss the  windigo I understand why there gone but I still miss it
This doll is one of my hear me outs and I will not apologize for that
11:49 he kinda looks like a Halloween version JD from Heathers here
The paint line on his face would have been a good scar
Ugh I need him
Ok is it wrong for me to add him to my heart me out cake I will most definitely be making art of him, I love him
okay guys hear me out🫣
Its cool revisiting this after watching the banshee video, seeing how you used similar techniques for the open mouth sculpts feels like coming full circle. Your halloween dolls are some of my favourites of yours, always gets me in the spooky spirit ^.^
I love rewatching all the Halloween customs in Spooky season😍 and I'm still hoping for the day were she makes a Krampus Doll based on the austrian traditon😊
oh my goodness the 4 pics at the end with his buddies remind me so MUCH of karkat T^T
Idk why i rewatched this and though bout Eryi
NAWHH HE LOOKS LIKE YUJI GUYS IM SCARED
i can definitely see him being embers bf 😂
I still love this project. It’s one of my favorites just because of the modifications and art concept. Never will get tired of this
I love this doll ❤! Also as a clarinetist, I got distracted by that one song in the background for a second lol.
16:43 this one’s giving Tom Riddle tbh. Love him tho. I’m so excited to see what you have in store for Halloween 2025! Keep up the amazing work Kathrine!
Did you paint nipples on him.
Not me simping for a doll 🤦‍♀️
...*sigh*  Juwon would collect the vampire. He already has a goth boyfriend. Now a vampire bestie.  I have a problem. Trust me  I know.
Re-watching all your vids cause Im really in a creative mood rn, aaaaaaand as I get to this one... I get reminded of a painful truth x) You know how you're a raging lover of pink, cute and pastel? I'm like that about all black and gothic stuff. And, gentle reminder, the only actually proper goth dolls youve made is this sweet boi and Tatsuo (and Lilith, but I wanna see em in aaaall your style!) x3 And I'm just like "but nooooooooo where are the badass like, vampire/goth lolita/punk-rock MODERN-ish ladies!? D: I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that next time you're to make a gothic-ish doll, you go full out making a GIRL x3 Could be a cool like reaper goddess for halloween some year with some badass piercings and accessories!  I know its not your usual style, but if you want a like "backwards" challenge, to make your typical lolita but make her GOTH ;3
I haven’t seen her channel in so long I’ve missed watching her I’ve been here since Iggy the fairy I think she’s a fairy atleast Edit: I just looked and it’s been 3 years since I’ve watched her the first vid I watched was posted 6 years ago……..I’m not even 20 yet and I already feel old
I'm really enjoying your Halloween doll videos are the Banshee, Ember the Red Demon, the Goatman (Ember's Dad), a Werewolf, the Raven, Kay Wren the Witch in training, Zura the Succubus (Ember's Mum & Goatman's wife) and Heathcliff the Vampire. 🦇💀🎃👻😈
Bro no way I'm down bad for a doll rn ong 😍So articulate and ambitious! The lore and cute comics with all of them are splendid. Like their own universe!
1:51 anyone else notice he took a leaf with him? 😂
as a k pop fan the only thing i see is kai from txt XD , love the mouth sculpting
If I had a nickel for every time I had a crush on a dollightful doll, I’d have two nickels.
please tell me im not the only one who totally ships heathcliff and ember in my own secret mind this carries on the three-part demon family Halloween thing katherines been doing it may not be cannon but its my own personal mental fanfic ☺
You should make a siren❤
Yes ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤p
a bit off topic, but that's not deuce, that's ice. WHERE IS HIS SNAKE BABIES ON HIS HEAD WAAKJAWUGFKJAWN (very cute boy vampire though)
That short film at the end 😢✨️
This is reminding me about muzon from kny
close enough, welcome back kibutsuji muzan!
Okay, you Really nailed the "arrogant anime boy" character look, bc i thought from the thumbnail that this was a specific anime guy and i didnt watch this for so long because i didnt know what anime he was from and didnt feel attached enough to watch 😅
Maybe you could use the other outfit on a dinosaur themed character?
He looks fang-tastic (hehe,vampire pun)
the fact that it could also be kieran Valentine.......
I’m literally in love with that outfit. ❤️
You could've made the line a scar!! 💕💕 It looks awesome tho
He’s such a pretty doll and I loooove how you did his face❤️❤️❤️
I love how he’s a cool and mysterious vampire with the outfit and face, but then when you look down at the shoes you get reminded he’s just a teenage boy😭
You should really think about selling your dolls their cool.
His the guy that the girls start screaming for when he comes on screen
Its giving Buffy The vampire slayer from the 90’s, am I wrong? Lol, Heathcliff reminds me of Spike!!!
If I’m honest he gives arrogant younger brother vibes or cool older brother vibes
His smirk reminds me of Hanako-kun
Giving him a werewolf friend/partner for Halloween this year would be perfect. I love his cheeky smirk! It makes him look very handsome :]
Next Halloween thing, can you repost the Wendigo? I really wanna know how you made it and I think you might’ve took it down.
Anyone else watching these videos so much through out the years
I WAS SHIPPING HIM WITH EMBER THE END MADE ME SO HAPPY
he would have looked 1000 times better with long hair. also, the shoes and nail shape are awful ;/
that boy is trans. To Me
he gives off manhwa ml vibes😭
DEAR GOD 🙏🙏🙏
OH MY GODDDDDDD AGAJAGAGGAJA
He’s lovely!! Reminds me of this vampire manga I read.. mm devils line?
When he has his arms open/stretched out he kinda looks like he's reaching for a hug. And with that grin he looks like he's sayin "where my hug at?" 😭😭  Still he came out amazing and I love his design so much. Katherine needs to make more vampire dolls
The trainers really add to the forever teen vampire aesthetic.  Edit: Forgive my Bri'ish I mean sneakers 😅
would
I want him
would
The Sneakers were the perfect touch in my opinion! XD Really adds to his boyish personality hahaha
AAAA HE’S SO HOT DADDY LUNCHY BOO-BOO BEAR❤❤❤
Karkat what are you doing here
You could make a pretty amazing comic of all your Halloween dolls
Anytime i see an imperfection in the plastic/paint of a doll, i just think "SCARS!" cause scars are super cool and add a ton of character and backstory 😊
I love Halloween every year but I REALLY love Halloween every year for the Halloween dolls! Maybe a cute zombie of some kind could be fun? Love always!!
omg yay another male doll, i always love their designs!!
Ooh when hes hanging upside down his coattails kinda look like bat wings!
the vampire looks like the vampire from the little vampire movie
AAHHH I cant's wait for halloween 2024!!! It's been so long since I last watched and I've missed you!!
I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll I'm not attracted to a doll
The montage at the end was so detailed and came as a pleasant surprise but…how did you make a peace of plastic look so fine??😂
He kinda looks like an albino vampire, which is absolutely cool
Sir, this is a Wendy's, please take off your shirt.
You should do a zombie-werewolf
You made removing that snake headcap look easy, i just spent an hour taking mine off, and now he has a small hole in the top of his head because the glue wouldnt budge. Had to use a pair of scissors to remove the rest of it. I am sad about the hole but at least I can give mine hair now 😅  Do you think that that hole will get worse over time? I plan to hot glue hair onto him so maybe that will prevent anything from getting worse?
With the crazy hair he reminded me of 2000s bill kaulitz
he kinda looks like my cousin lmao  which is very funny
That’s not deuce that’s bruce 💀 (not me simping over a custom doll or just a doll in general lol)
Kind of gives me this Marshall lee from adventure time vibe.
What happened to Windego Chan?
heathcliff and emeziel from Just Roll With It: The Suckening give off the same vibes
guys is he not hueningkai in doll form
Re-watched this video and was like, love how technically Dollightfuls doll avatar is like a goddess that looks like a pastel woman among a bunch of powerful supposed to be scary dolls. Are all the other dolls just like, "oh yea that's dollightful, she's our creator and goddess but she's chill"
From some angles he looks a little brain dead
I kinda like the crack in his face. It makes me think he's made of porcelain, like the vampires in twilight. Which, love or hate the series, is a cool concept. Honestly, you could have emphasized it into a full on scar or crack, but I understand if that didn't vibe with the pretty boy thing you were going for.
I'm still really sad about the wendigo, it was one of my favorite designs.
Is it bad that I lowkey ship him and the goat and daughter? They were sooo cute in the Photo Booth 🤭
Seriously, I love her male customs SM. They’re all so handsome.
Why do you make all the Halloween people look hot ?
"This is the manicure of a killer bella."  [thought of this silly joke at around 13:30 -- 13:40 of the video]
I feel like he would have a crush on Ember 😅
9:00 why is he giving Hyunjin from StrayKids vibes 😂
17:05 bro im sorry but he kinda looks like karkat in these photos LMAO
You should do a pjo doll recreation please
Why is it always the head that is getting attacked with the Halloween dolls
I love the little scenes at the end of your videos. Would love a short film ❤
10:03 should've kept it and made him a trad goth vampire! XD
I love that zura and goat dad are holding hands in the intro!so cute!!☺️
Zombie would be so cool
I adore your videos 😭 they're so relaxing to me, i use them like asmr <3 plus the dolls???? AMAZING ! the talent is astronomical fr
The teeth are so impressive. 😮
went well you do for 2024?
he looks like a little anime villain 15:17 ♥♥
Awesome 🖤
Does anyone else see a striking resemblance to hueningkai?
Looking like the vampire from baldur gate very nice
I love the story line the characters have made throughout the process, like Goat man and succubus having a child demon who is friends with a very old yet young looking vampire and a ghost  Ahhh, I love it so much it ads lore to the doll for us lore freaks out there (Also, the way succubus and goat man are staring at each other at the end is sooo cuteeee)
Make him a zombie bf🙏
For your next doll Can you make it a Male werecat that just came back from a haunted forest Because male are not quite represented in the channel
13:04 "Where my hug at"
PLEEEEEEEAAAAASEEEE MAKE A FEMALE MOTHMAN THIS HALLOWEEN SO EMBER CAN HAVE A SASSY AUNTIE 😭😭😭
(Aka muzan from demon slayer)
When it got to the hair part I said Michael Jackson that u? 😂
I can totally hear him with Johnny Depp's voice as Wade Walker's from Crybaby.
He reminds me of the animated The Little Vampire
…Anyone else seeing Karkat Homestuck?
OH NO HES HOOOOOOTTTT
why is he hot?
It would be so cute if you used those spike pants for a dinosaur lover character! (Hint hint us transmen love Dino’s)
Gosh, he's  so cool! I'm in love 😍 We really need more Boy Dolls ❤❤❤
I’m just praying for the day Katherine decides to make a Mothman doll.
GUYS HEAR ME OUT.
Katherine I know what you are doing wrong with your dolls hair. You need small sizers not big ones.
His overall character would be great for a dating sim.
Oh, that grin of Astarion. 😏
tbh you’ve done wayyy better but this is still impressive ig
I LOVE THIS!!!!!! im a veryyy pale person, and my family is often called vampires! (some allergies to garlic, lots allergic to the sun, and weirdly long lives) so im so happy one of my favourite creators made such a cool vampire!!
Love Heathcliff!! And the photo booth pictures were absolutely adorable, I love your characters so much 😭🩵
he needs a werewolf boyfriend that matches his vibe 🐺🌒🦇🩸

7:36  i know it wasnt really ment to happen but an idea for the future if it happens again on another doll is maybe to make it a scar? Its an amazing doll tho very handsome and pretty 😃
Шедевр👍
not me realizing hella late this was posted on my birthday😭😭
i'd love to see even more vampires!
13:03 “where my hug at?” Stance.
Ember and Heathcliff my OTP 💖
I THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER CUTE IF NEXT HALLOWEEN KATHERINE MAKE HIM AN IRRESPONSIBLE LITTLE SISTER WHO'S AROUND 16-14 YEARS OLD AND THEIR PARENTS MAKE HIM TAKE CARE OF HER
Can 2025 Halloween just be giving Heathcliff a skrunkly ass "traditional vampire" boyfriend lmao
I love how she didn't bother to paint his legs, but DID bother to paint his nipples. Honestly girl, same priorities.
ok but all i can see is roderick (diary of a wimpy kid) dressing up for Halloween 😂❤
STOP WHY IS HE SO HOT HE'S LITERALLY A DOLL?????!
Maybe next Halloween make a zombie or ghost but only boys because you got lots of girls and I see two boys.
the concept art looks like if kaido from saiki k cosplayed as a jojos bizarre adventures character
the second I heard "arrogant looking anime boy" I knew we were in for a treat
he got that Rodrick hair
WHY DOES BROSKI LOOK LIKE JOSH HUTCHERSON 😭🙏🏽
I love how Heathcliff's been bunched with the "teens" of the lineup, Lol it really fits the cheeky smirk you've given him
Heathcliffe looks like he would fit right in to Ateez's Black Cat Nero MV 😁 And i love the artwork in his gallery at the end - did you do them all yourself? I recognize leyendecker, pop art, and a few others i can't place names on at the moment
I’m gonna make my own vampire higher second queen Castlevania
His hair is kinda giving me Bakugou vibes and I’m absolutely living for it!! These dolls just keep getting better and better!!🖤
I finally found your channel again! I've been searching for Dollicious thinking that was ur name 🥲  You were my childhood, I used to (and frankly, still do) love all your repaints. I remember being obsessed with the idea of trying it out for myself. I bought a used Clawdeen doll, but I never really got around to repainting her.  Today's the day I will be giving her a makeover! Thank you for inspiring so many people to be creative. Keep making videos. ❤
*In squidward voice* Oh no he's hot 😫
This is like actually my favorite original doll you’ve done
He kinda looks like marshal lee the genderbend of marcaline in adventure time
I wish monster high would make good boy dolls like this. Then maybe I’d buy one 😂
I love, love LOVE the shoes. It really elevates his outfit and gives a much more modern feel to the design. Its like a young adult vampire from the 18th or even 19th century discovered Nike and is like "hey, these match my clothes!"
why do i find a doll attractive? /j
i know it's not really your style but nex year you should make a goth doll
he looks like hueningkai from txt im obsessed
vampire in js is incredible
oo maybe next year a zombie with exposed bones? missing eye?
I like how the name is the same as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, I think it fits.
I need him in an unholy way
I would like a custom monster high line up
smash
I wonder if freezing the vinyl heads would make them easier to work with while sculpting on them? maybe temporarily harden the vinyl enough to stop being so squishy :0, then again once it goes back to room temperature the clay could crack.
At 10:05 he’s giving Johnnie Guilbert vibes and I’m SO here for it
Why hes kinda….
Not gonna lie I kind of simping the doll idk why I'm just am
He looks like a Lost Boys vampire before she cut his hair omg
The end was so cute 😭 he’s definitely my fave doll so far!!
Why did you use varnish on the body and Mr.SuperClear?
Biker Jacket wearing vampire?   The Lost Boys (1987) anyone?
Honestly I feel like Heathcliff would have a little sister that is the complete opposite of him 😂
You are so talented and skilled! It's literally a joy watching you work 🥰 So inspiring 🤩
foe 2024 you should do a zombie!!
I just had an idea about what if Katherine someday did a doll with braces? Lol.
THE JORDANS!!! oh my god. i love it. he's such a classic gothy biker vampire with a sinister pretty boy look and then BAM. he's got jays on. what a nerd!!
WAIT WHY HE KINDA….😋🤭
Heck I never played with dolls really as a kid but I love these dolls. Art dolls are Amazing and I would love to one day have a work of art like these one day. the love that goes into Art dolls is beautiful and I appreciate that.
Question: why did you make him hot
okay here's an idea for halloween 2024 idk if you like doing character redesigns like hextian but if you do you should sooo search up cerise hood from ever after high's 'cerise wolf' doll and work on a concept from that. the premise of eah is basically that the characters are children of fairytale characters, in cerise's case the daughter of red riding hood, however her father is the big bad wolf and in the aforementioned doll she leans more into the 'daughter of the big bad wolf' aspect. i think it'd look rlly cool in ur style :p just a thought!!
I have a challenge for you dollightful!! I have a doll I want you to make!!
I love healthcliff he's spooky but mischievous. And to be honest I could so see him as a student at monster high. And totally crushing on Frankie 😊
hes so cool!
Ok.. Ngl.. Why does this doll remind me of corpse husband 😭😭
He looks like how a girl would invision a book boyfriend vampire
Heathcliff has such a fun design!!!!!! I love him!!!
I think this has to be my favorite doll of yours!! Absolutely ADORE the expression, he’s just so!! Feelings!!! He’s incredibly silly
I think I like it a lot more  He looks cool
Why he kinda fi-       nvm
Not sure if I love the idea of doll dentures or vampire dentures more lol. ❤
I definitely think him and ember would be an immaculate couple
The uneven paint on his face makes me think his skin is more stone like- like he was injured and because he’s undead the scar doesn’t look like a traditional scar- like his skin was cracked instead of gashes
why he kinda..
Does he have nipples
Make him a girlfriend
isss he single??
what happened to windy chan
Duce? I expected Valentine. But oh well, it turned out great in the end 😊
The accidental line just looks like a vein or scar! And I think the first outfit idea would really fit fot a dino or dragon!!
He reminds me of a playboy but when you actually date him he is just obsessed with you
He definitely has Rhys from ACOTAR vibes
When I first saw him I thought of Twilight😭 Anyways It's looks really good!
SKETCHED UP
HIS NIKE SHOES... I love this guy he's wonderful. Great work as always!!!!
did I watch this a day after Christmas...maybe ;)
He kinda looks like JD from Heathers the musical😂 but I really love this doll, I’m a goth and this is what my soul needed. Your a really good artist too, and I love your attitude throughout the video as well!!
I feel like Ember and Heathcliff are gonna be the close besties that gossip on the daily. ^u^
My dumbass was waiting for an orange cat 90s cartoon based on doll when heard the name Heathcliff 😅😅😅
ik this be late but what if you add Mark Infront of Heathcliff? 🤔
This chanel has helped me throughout many hard times, i love her so much
What happened to the wendigo doll???!?
[squidward voice] OH NO HE’S HOTTTT
7:13 with most of the audio being voiceover, cutting the dub-over so we can hear the shaking in the footage reminded me of a thunder clap in  horror movie :D
with the way you’ve cut into so many dolls, i’m surprised you haven’t done your own take on frankenstein’s monster :O i love watching the fine line you balance between your fine sculpting (like the mouth + teeth) and your move-fast-break-things solutions (like carving a big ol hole in the skull)
hes the type of guy to say wheres my hug at
This repaint was cool but I wanna see something more complicated next year like maybe you could make a cryptid or even a Dokkaebi? Would love to see it!
Why’s he kinda….
Honestly I'd love to have that exact jacket for myself. LMFAO!
I think it would've been cool if you had turned the line down his face into a battle scar.😂
Reminds me of hell sing
honestly, just kinda give us off Bad vibes no hate but like he’s wearing Jordans just like modern I guess just looks like the average boy in the high school with vampire fang doesn’t really feel that Halloweenie just feels like a normal with Pointy teeth
Who also listens to Redacted and sees Adam like this. I mean this lovingly as I love Dollighfull’s work and have been watching her longer than I have Redacted this is just how I imagine that character
Why do I have a crush on a doll
He serves big Bakugo Katsuki energy.
The "I-don't-have-a-pattern- but-I-believe-in-myself brute force approach" is how I learn any craft, honestly.
This is just an idea, but You should totally make a series based off the different rings of hell! Just like the dragon, and eevee evolution series! For example; sloth, envy, pride, gluttony, greed, lust and wrath ?
I’m currently reading withering heights so his name made me quite happy
i think the painting mishap on the face actually helps with his mouth sculpt, like the skin moving around an open mouth. i feel like it could look intentional if you added a dimple on that cheek
The Hair!!! OMG I'm dying - love this doll!
Can I buy him?
I thought it was gonna look like Edward Cullen
You remind me of the one guy from Toy story Who cleans up and fix the dolls
Why does he kinna look like Heuning Kai 😍
heathcliff and werewolf girl are definitely dating, he seems like the only one who wouldn't be scared of her and they understand each other since they both morph into animalistic creatures while living mostly as anthro beings
Looking on his basic hair, HELL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE VENEER FROM TROLLS 3!!
Love it. Ya did great. The witch is still my favorite. She is just so cute. Your work is great as always
Love how he has the classic vampire look but then BOOM! Nikes (Also him and Ember are totally dating)
For your next dollar could you please do a paralysed Christmas doll with a cute wheelchair with all of the colours of the rainbow even pastel and dark rainbow
I love the pictures with him and the demon girl and ghost girl
the designs are so cute. 🥹
A mini series or something of all the dolls you've made like interacting or hanging out would be interesting
The line down his face could be his scar that has healed through time imagine him with the mullet
I can’t believe I never saw this video on Halloween!! 🥲 Tragic   Great project as always Katherine!! :) Love all your Halloween Dolls!!
How she set it up, scares me- fr sacrifising-1:56
I LOST IT at the mini Jordans, they’re so cute omg 😭❤️❤️   I adore your videos so much, they’re just so passionate and fun, and seeing you work is amazing!! Obsessed with his coat too 😭😭
What airbrushing ,gotta love that Russian af grey
I would love to see you make a Mothman inspried doll
Next year Halloween 👻 doll the headless horseman (dullahan Irish ☘️ folklore)
I think he needs a werewolf boyfriend
Why didn’t you paint the mouth before u put it in ?
He reminds me of olivia rodrigos song 'vampire'. Also i love your channel and all ur dolls.
Okay your art is.... 1:11
I have a doll series idea!! Seven deadly sins!!🫶
He looks like a fluffy little e-boy and I just think that's adorable
When will you'd next video be? Bc I am dying to see what you come up with!😊 I also think he should be with ember😊
I can't be the only one that sings him in the demon girl would make a great couple
i hope next year she will make an Frankenstein doll out if different dolls parts.
I wonder if you could make a little brother for him using the cute modern clothes you've already made?
I loved that the grey paint was "russian af grey" lol
Literally haven't seen you in so long I remember ruining my dolls trying to replicate you😭😭💀 your improvement is so insane I love it so much❤❤❤❤
VAMPIRE BOY YIPPPEEEEEE
You should make a visual kei doll!! I would literally die
Damn, those drawings amazing
He looks incredible! Vampires are my favourite and i love your design
Random thought can you do a doll of Moriah Elizabeth she kinda does the same thing as you do but she re-makes squishes I think it would be cool
15:58  GIRL I ALMOST PASS OUT I THINK HE FELL 😭😭
I think that's easily one of your best faces, well done!
genuine question: I’m an artist wanting to get into the doll customizing hobby and I have no idea where to get dolls to work on (monster high specifically) any help?
Ember x Heathcliff????!!😂
you are so talented I am always in awe of your projects <3
this is so off topic to the video but i’m DYING to see her make maybe like a 2000’s inspired doll. like with the low rise jeans/leggings or the very unnecessary cropped jackets in winter with pink/bebe leggings and maybe like some cute uggs 😭🤍
I can't stop imagining his smirk as he just told a joke and is like "Heheh, get it?" He looks amazing but I can't unsee it 🤣🤣🤣
Can you please make kanna for me  &  send me it but I live in france 🇫🇷  montauban 😢
I think the line from his mouth to the head gave it like a scar like thing
He fr fr needs a human boyfriend wink wink nudge nudge.                           (This is a twilight reference)
Next year’s Halloween, you should do a clown
Give him a werewolf boyfriend 🙌🎉
He looks like if Bakugo for my hero academia was a vampire

I always love your doll customizations, however with the peeled paint on the side of Heathcliffs head from when you were sanding could have possibly turned into a really sick scar instead of covering it up. Vampires live a really long life, and with that comes lots of hunters, enemies, or accidents. That face long scar could have been from a vampire hunter, whatever enemy you want Heathcliff to have, or just an embarrassing story. Not only that, but a scar from before he became a vampire. It is just a thought. Anyways, I loved the video!
The line down the face was a missed opportunity of a battle scar
fab job as always... but... i have a question....... what's up with his lil skirt during the early work? you dont usually cover up your dolls... are there mods we don't know about on this one?! lol 😂 also, why didn't you paint the mouth BEFORE installing it???
why is he kinda fine??? like, vampire dude knows what he’s doing help me.
Not me simping for a doll
he’s so cute 😭 angsty teen boy
All I'm saying if it was a real person 100% smash 😅
May we morn the windago
Cute❤ vampire
You should get yourself a pencil extender. You can hold onto your super tiny pencils without your hands cramping!
100/10, lowkey have a crush on him lol. I was definitely having to trust the process but the mouth turned out so well! And the ending drawing was super cute.
He came out wonderfully.  He does look boyish and then super creepy. How fun.
I kept thinking of the little vampire movie throughout the entire video😭 maybe it's the spikeyish hair, but he reminds me of Rudy
O my Goshhhhhhhhhhhhhh I wanna merry him so bad😭🙌🏼🙌🏼 He's gorgeous!!!💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
Dollightful for next Halloween how about making gorgone siblings brother and sister like Medusa please keep up the great work with your doll making skills 😊😊
I actually like his paper white skin, it definitely gives him the " I haven't been out in the sun for while" look, which makes sense since he's a vampire, and vampires are pretty well known for their very pale completion.
Babe you made Marshal lee!!!! Here for it
A little tip from an amateur animator for making stop motion of your dolls walking look more realistic 🤭😉.... Instead of just having the doll bob up and down, have the doll's torso alternate between facing left and facing right with each step, while keeping the head facing forward. Doing this while also bobbing the doll up and down will dramatically strengthen the illusion of the doll walking.  Amazing work as always, Dollightful.... Not only is he incredible, and the TEETH holy cow.... I also think this is the best photo shoot of your dolls yet 👀
You should do a cyclops
I can see Heathcliff being Ember’s boyfriend ❤️‍🔥
I love how he looks and sounds like he'd be a Monster High character
This guy, just DEFINITELY rocks 80s PUNK. Greas lighting and all.
HE LOOKS AMAZING
Idk why but he reminds me of I.N from stray kids
He looks like jd from the heathers musical I think it's the jacket that makes him look like jd
I imagine the dolls voice to sound smooth, a little scratchy, and like that deep tone teen boys have. Just me? ✨‼️
the first clothed design reeeaaally reminds me of kaido from the disastrous life of saiki k
I love the concept, although the smile Is not giving me vampire, sorry.
Great face up and hair. This is one the best dolls you have created in a while! Dolightful is back!! Nice job!
Random suggestion although I doubt my comment will be noticed since my comments rarely are. I think it would be cool if one year instead of just making a doll we could instead get some extra story of everyone's relationships especially since Goatman and Heathcliff are the only boys in this yearly series and well I want to see the interactions between the dolls especially after seeing that picture like what's the story behind it? I think that would be really cool to see. Also maybe we could see some crossovers between the different series you have done like the dragons interacting with the Halloween dolls?
I hope you find something to use the spike pants for! They’re super cute 🥰
I'd love to see a cyberpunk style doll from you, you always have such wonderful designs and creativity when it comes to doll prosthetics
I love the line on his face in fact I think it gives him character. Like he’s been through stuff lol. 😊
"This is the manicure of a killer"
i love his mouth; he looks like a claymation face plate
This is my favorite doll followed by Sirena
I love it and Keep up the good work
You should make a Japanese zombie one- (I forgot what there called but like Qiqi from genshin)
Ok hear me out….
Man I think it could've been rlly cool if you made the line down his face from the paint peeling a scar! He looks soooo great though I love him!
he's so smug i love him
obsessed with the modern pants, i need them
I was almost expecting a mention of Heathcliff being Ember's boyfriend or something  Like we made Zura and Goatman her parents, she's clearly besties with Banshee, Heathcliff's her boyfriend, it all makes sense
The Spooky Family grows <3
"We already have a toothy one and a monstrous one, so let's go the cute boy route!" hit so close to home for my design process lmaooo
Day 1 of asking Katherine to make a custom lol doll
Love!!❤️‍🔥
Wow, now that's how to make dolls hair https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3TFHCZgaxY&t=3s&ab_channel=ViralVideoUK
Katherine I just have to say that I absolutely ADORE how accessible you make your crafting process !! Love it so much and it's super eco-friendly too !!
Spoopi
CAN YOU MAKE A 2000s SCENE KID MONSTER HIGH DOLL I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO COOL
This has to be my most favorite one you've done so far!
He’s giving off rin okumura vibes
I remember watching dollightful years ago and thinking I could do it in elementary so somewhere in this house there’s a bald monster high doll with yarn in its head with a poorly painted face
My first comment disappeared, so I'm going to say it again: His outfit reminds me a lot of my babygirl Mikhail Jirov from Sirius the Jaeger!
Hey can you make a fnaf doll ?
The pictures are such a nice touch in the final montage🥺💗
He gives me CBBC’s ‘young Dracula’ vibes  Also magical girls with sneakers  would be cool
omg you ate that uppppp!! literally the best in the game lol he looks so good!! i love your work!
the line left from the paint peeling looks like a scar!! maybe he had an epic battle centuries ago and was left with that scar
He looked very Eddie Munson before his hair cut
17:05 ahhh, i love that art so much!! I really want it as a sticker!❤
I love him❤ I think you should do a zombie next year
You should totally make him a werewolf boyfriend! They can be forbidden loverssss :D
As a fellow subscriber..why don't you ...m..ak..e a real human..
Can you make him a Partner ❤❤❤ I mean a lover
He reminds me a lot of Rin Okumura from Blue Exorcist and I love it!!
The next boy doll should be clawden wolfs brother as a emo scene doll
when you were installing the mouth I was like ‘why don’t you just paint it now so you don’t have to reach in later’
I LOVE how smug he looks. He seems like he'd be very annoying at first, but was a sweetheart when you meet him
Vampire characters always seem so cool, heathcliff really reminds me Alucard from castlevania from the Netflix series in aesthetic
He is GORGEOUS, the teeth especially are super impressive. What a shame he is named after the funny ham helmet garbage ape cartoon cat.
let me tell you, when i saw the deuce doll i literally screamed "WHAT THE F IS THAT??????" what have the done in gen 3????? 😭😭
He looks so freakin’ cool!!! I’d love to cosplay this doll character!
That ain't a smirk, thats basically a chesire grin.
Um... would you consider, for pride month at least, making a ftm doll...?
You should have painted the mouth bits before putting it in the head. That would probably have been much easier tbh. Other than this, I really enjoyed the video. Keep up the good work.
Not deus😭😢😱
❤🤍🖤🩶💜
I can imagine him sounding like Jax from Digital Circus.
it would've been totally cool to turn the weird mark from the peeled paint into a face scar. i know in some mythologies vampires don't/ can't scar because mortal injuries go away but it could've been like a cool story where he got into a fight with a vampire hunter or something. idk, just would have been a really cool fix for something that happened accidentally. in the end the doll turned out really cool regardless!!
Upon second watch it has come to my attention that heathcliff looks like a younger/modern/edgier Alucard
It be awesome if she made kandyland Suzy doll
why he so hot. damn
every time I will always love the little interaction your dolls have at the end of each dool customizing videos🤩🤩
The photo booth pics are adorable!!! Also obsessed with the 3D fangs
Hes obv not my fav bc he looks alot like Bakugou from mha (I don't like him or the anime itself) but he still turned out really good!
I have an idea for your next doll. You should do your cats as dolls.
MAAAAN the things id do for his jacket
Head cannon: Uvie & Heathcliff go to the same shoe story, & they ran into each other, & that be how they become friends. (& I think the two of them would just pester the heck out of Ember! 😂)
It’s sick! He looks kinda like the cover art on Demon Days (like 2D)
I love the design! But I have to say, he looks like he has a very punchable personality
The nikes were an excellent choice, it makes him look like a hypebeast
HES SO PRETTY (also, the accidental line on his face reminds me of how vampires from Twilight are killed, so it works!)
He reminds me of Rudolph from the little vampire if he. Was grown
17:02 would love it if you make this a merch😭😭😭😭
I always look forward to these halloween videos every year! I just love the spooky dolls, and this year may be one of my favs
this is so amazing !!!! creative and innovative
I'M OBSESSED OH MY GOSH
You should make lady rainicorn from adventure time as a human into a doll! I think you’d really like her 😁
I LOVE THIS FUCKBOY VAMPIRE GOD BLESS
Heathcliff reminds me of the little vampire movie (specifically more the 2017 version then the 2000s version)  That to say he looks fantastic!
I love all your drawings and concept art, maybe you can drop the speedpaint sometimes!
Make a rockstar sometime!
Im surprised you haven’t done a ‘Frankensteins Monster’ esc doll, I have a feeling it would look awesome!
Hear me out, ember x him they would look cool
Ok but at 6:05 the pumpkin in the background starts moving
Heathcliff needs a boyfriend
Heathcliff looks sooo handsome
Ok i cant with the grin it kinda looks like hes got something stuffed in his cheek 😂, overall a great custom tho
I LOVE him 😍 gotta be my fav of your Halloween dolls. But I’m biased because I always loved vampires 😂
I can’t be the only one who is obsessed with rewatching her videos over and over right
I love him, you did amazing on the design, keep the amazing vids going
Him and the demon girl would be so cute as a couple!
is he the demon brother
I ❤ it but it would’ve been better if you did pointy er but i like it
make a zombie next halloween
I love the way you do masculine features, he looks so sarcastic and kind of rude 😭. He has such popular vampire features yet still looks unique
I miss windego
love his smirk, but i felt like it was missing something my first watchthrough; after some thinking i realized his smile is a bit off. one thing most people don't notice is that a smile affects much more than your mouth, which is why you can usually tell between a fake and genuine smile. genuine smiles tend to exaggerate your crows feet, and lifts the lower lid as well as exaggerating the crease in the eyelid that marks the bottomof the eyeball. there's also a fold in the skin that stretches from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth. i feel like adding this would make his smirk more realistic and believable. but he's otherwise a fantastic doll, very charming! :]
Did you make all the picture gallery artwork? The styles vary so much i couldnt tell! Your painterly style w the 1st Castlevania-esque vampire and then ur cute 60s greaser print shows such a range. Again you're so cool! ❤
I've been watching your channel for a few years now and you never cease to amaze me! I was from the back picture for some reason getting cyber punk edge runner vibes.. anyone else?
I Love it , I Love it, I LOVE IT !!!
He remind me your Litten a little !
Hiya Dollightful! I was just wondering, have you ever thought about making a cyberpunk/cybercore doll? Kinda like an AI girl or something? I've seen many good references on Pinterest, and I'm curious to see how you would do it! :)
I adore the art at the end omg!!
Why can I imagine Heathcliff being the bad boy Ember brings home and her parents just absolutely adore him?
You could have tourned the line down his face in a bis scar
so luo binghe coded..... beautiful beautiful beautiful
Love your ideas❤
Am your biggest fan and I love your doll it’s so good am a subscriber I like your videos❤️😀
every year i'm so excited to see your halloween specials. we're getting so much LORE 😩🤌 and i loooove heathcliff!!! he looks so cool yet very cheeky. very cute but also handsome, just like how an anime boy should be. you did a perfect job katherine, as always 🥰
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like hyung Kai from txt from the thumbnail
I can't explain it, he's just *so* Dollightful. This dude is like PEAK Dollightful. I love him. Keep "em coming at your convenience, you're doin' great 😙🤌
I think it’d be cool if you did a five nights at Freddy’s series!!
Honestly watching the mouth being cut open reminded me of the scene of the little doll being repurposed at the beginnging of the movie Coraline.
RIP Wendy the Wendigo, hello Heathcliff the Vampire
I love him
Another great video, and those cute Lantern lights are perfectly sized for doll shoots. It looks awesome!
The slight  paint line down his face looks like a scar
I cant stop looking at the teeth - they were so well made - In love!
I think the eyes lack expression, the right one should be a little more squished. Appart from that wow never seen this technique! Amazing
He needs a boyfriend now. Make it a werewolf to stray from the “vampires hate werewolves” or even better enemies to lovers 👁️👁️
"I just sketched up something" - the drawing's better than something I could do in 50 years
i love your dolls and the art is so MWAH fr
Like I have a really good idea for a doll.Its a scarecrow or pirate ghost
He looks like he is going to ask you out on a date and he is a bad boy so I will just follow him 😊
Its giving the lost boys! An iconic 80s vampire flick.  He a mix of david and Dwayne. In style imo
the 80s poof was too good
I'm so sorry but I would absolutely love @dollightful to make human versions of the five nights at Freddy's security breach animatronics or some from the books
If u would have made him blonde u made Ban from sds my favorite character I need a Ban doll 🥰
He reminds me of Staz Blood from Blood Lad
Heathcliff turned out so good!!! I love the teeth! (he's an old vampire and needed some dentures, lol!) and the art at the end was amazing!! I'd love a jacket like that too..! An amazing doll as always!🤩
Now you gotta make a vampire hunter
Also, your lining trick is the exact same one I used on my 2nd Halloween doll on my channel! (Same idea with the black coat and red lining too!) Heathcliff's coat is so epic!
Not me already shipping him with the demon girl 😀
He looks like the protag from "Devils Line"
The resin apoxie nails look way better than the paper ones!
This is quality, thank you Katherine!!
This is great!  And I love the ending video.  You are so creative!
He looks so cool and very hansom btw I think G3 Frankie would make a great non binary friend for Iren oxide and Ti-taniom just an ideab
Oh my, I love him dearly. I have to admit, I was partial to his 80's poofy hair myself, but I do see your vision and still adore it as well. I would absolutely LOVE to see you do an 80's glam/hair metal boy, though! Metal is one of my major hyperfixations, and 80's glam/hair metal just doesn't get the representation and appreciation that it deserves  ALSO OMG THE ART GALLERY OF HIM AT THE END IS THE BEST THING EVER! It does definitely hammer home to me my personal bias and love for long hair though LOL. Instead of a cool kid in the 80's I would've gone with metalhead instead XD
FAVORITE DOLL YET
"unnecessary amount of collars" I think you mean "necessary amount"
Now, I don't want it.... I need that jacket!
Covid has gone to my brain. When you reached for the doll I wasn't expecting big Katherine even though I know you aren't the doll I've watched this channel for years😂
Ykw, I just realized- "Heathcliff" the Halloween vampire doll....shares a name with a Halloween candy, the Heath bar. Granted, a generally discarded type of candy, something you'd trade with other kids for something, ANY other kind of candy- but a funny coincidence nonetheless XD
I think you nailed his outfit, it fits the doll really well and is a nice mix of modern ideas and typical vampire looks
The fact that you made doll dentures is amazing
I kind of want a show out this character it looks so good!. Amazing job.
He kind of reminds me of Robin from Young Dracula if anyone knows what that is 😂
Thank you for this video! 😀🌻
I can’t be the only one who kinda wants Ember and Heathclif to date?😅
He's so pretty. Love that expression you gave him!
OH NO!! SHE MADE A DOLL I'M ATTRACTED TO!!
heathcliffe's giant smirk make sme feel better about my own wonky grin, honestly
at 6:01 when the black and white filter came on i almost expected the Monster Mash to start playing
Can he be both scary and adorable??? Also, I love Wuthering Heights and I approve the name so much
I'm so used to the colourful skin tones that it's a little weird seeing her working with a mostly natural skin tone, but I like it anyway.
He reminds me so much of Mr Hyde from the game coffee talk when he's walking through the gallery
ah mah gah he's so cute
Have you ever tried to cut a dolls original hair? I think it would be a good idea on a long hair doll. Just a idea!
I think he needs a vampire, Hunter, boyfriend!!
Ngl, i gotta crush on yo' doll Chief.
I think u should make a jack frost for Christmas but like a hot version
Next Halloween doll should be based off of 🍬 🍫 🍭  candy
im gonna be honest this was kinda lame, all the other halloween dolls were really accurate to the source matierial and this is just a cringe emo guy with ugly shoes
Went into this with no expectation of finding the vampire boy attractive. Then the concept art of the final outfit design appeared. I guess monster high really did set my standards at "pretty boy with good fashion sense"
We seriously need a complication of the shorts from the ending of the Halloweeen episodes
i NEED TO KNOW IF HEATH CLIFF AND THAT RED EMON GIRL ARE DATING!
Idk if you’ll see this but I thought I’d try lol! Come Christmas time do you think you could do Jesus? I know that sounds weird but I was thinking it would be cool to have the Holy Trinity as dolls, plus it would be really interesting to try and do the Holy Ghost lol. Anyway I love your work!🤍
im sorry but your concept art for heathcliff just looks like karkat vantas (from homestuck) im so sorry i cant unsee it </3
The face up is insane! I can't believe how well the new set of teeth came out and the cut mouth part. It looks seemless!
i love him omg, you never fail to
I like the idea that he has his own style carefully crafted from cherry picked trends over the centuries
He looks so good! I love how you did the teeth!
A future project as suggestion  What if you make like an angel that could be his brother or sister, that would probably not match but I just got the idea well watching you make him
I know people like the girl dolls more than the guys, but every time I see Katherine make another guy doll it just makes me so dang happy. This one especially, because man, that jacket is so cool! I really need something like this in my wardrobe... ^^;
*Squidward voice* Oh no, he's hot 😩
Awe that last shot of him walking past the paintings and then adding a new picture was so cute
he turned out great and the portraits at the end in all the different styles were so fun!
if you were going for a "lost boys" style vampire you could have left the hair unstyled lol
RIP wendi-chan gone but never forgotten 😔🤍
16:27 good lord almighty
Next year you should a series of the Zodiac signs
15:25 oh wow i really like that pic 16:48 and omg that is really cool that u did all that 0-0
i had a thought, what if you painted the underside of his nails or tips of his fingers red or is that unnecessary effort?
the vibes remind me of alucard from hellsing 👀
I'd love to see kathrines take on diffrent types of ghosts!
HE NEEDS A ZOMBIE BOYFRIENDDDD
He legit looks like how Lio would look like in modern era.  . . . You know…from Blood Mercy? The book? 😅
This character reminds me of Pokémon themed doll that was created for Nerd-E Crafter.  Maybe they’re cousins 😊
HEAR ME OUT...
THE ART IS SO????   (im a simp)
Cute!
HELP I CAN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY HE'S SO GOOFY SDGJKGHDJSHGDKS  i love his design though, very silly man!!! 10/10
The level of DETAIL you are able to get on these tiny clothes! T---T I am in adoring envy! I don't think I'm at the level to do it yet but I can't wait to customize a Deuce and I'm so happy to have seen you do it!!! <3
Can we talk about that scene at the end??? Like ok production! I would so watch a dollightful movie   with the dolls as actors
AHHH HES SI ADORBZZ
Anyone else want more lore on the characters??!
The angling and lighting for his expression at 15:43 made me instantly think of the phrase "Aww come on, don't tell me you're scared?" Then his eyes did the glow thing right on "scared". Like the timing was immaculate!!! I love your vids Katherine, theyve helped get me through college and this difficult transition part of my life.
It’s always refreshing to see you customize a boy doll. Great job, he looks fang-tabulous! 🦇
Kathryn why did you make it look so hot 😳
Awesome Halloween doll & end video - but I don’t expect any less!  You rock!! (Steve watched too!). ❤❤❤
maybe for next year you could do a zombie or frankenstein's monster with some exposed brain ? i think that would be a fun modification !!
I love him! He's giving me Lost Boys vibes lol
bro im simping over a doll 😫
It was feeling like a dapper Marshal Lee vibe from him😘
He reminds me of Roderick heftly
Oh I love this man. I can just tell he's a chaotic bisexual who flirts with everyone but gets super flustered when someone returns that same energy.
I have a charector that looks alost exactally like him but has hedderocromia
13:51 looks like a kid trying on his dads clothes
Oooh! I have an idea for a doll! LGBTQ doll (ik you did it but remake one!)
Does this want you wanted your husband to be like dollightfut
The art gallery!!! The doll is absolutely great, especially that delightful smirk, but that gallery is PERFECT!!!
He looks like the kind of guy I'd date. As in, definitely a red flag and he'd treat me terribly but he's attractive so I'd forgive him a little too easily.
Amazing doll but I kinda wished that the vamp teeth were bigger
I like him in only shorts xd I would of loved if that was the final design x
He’s super cuteeee! I absolutely love this doll, I’m a huge fan of vampires so I really enjoyed this video ♥️♥️
MaeKE MmMA BBbB !,,
I already knew I would love this doll given my track record (I may or may not have an obsession with vampires) but he turned out SO good. I cannot expalin to you how badly i want his coat for myself. The assymetrical collars, the belts across his stomach and the COATTAILS ugh  It's just so good. You just never fail to impress with your designs <3
Well I kinda feel like he need a wintery(?) partner like to match
How ironic that you would do a vampire now that I’m obsessed with astarion from bg3
I donno why but he kinda reminds me of muzan from demon slayer lol but honestly it’s an amazing doll
Ok, vampire boy is really hot
He's giving Alucard,
As an avid fan of vampires, I absolutely adore him!! I've been waiting for you to make a vampire and he turned out fangtastic! Love your work, keep it up! :)
This generation of Deuce would make such a good Beast Boy customization!
I love this video!! She puts so much care into each doll ❤
These are all so cute I admire how much passion she always puts on not only the dolls but the pictures and stories and art
Hey!! Ive been a silent viewer for a few years now and i just wanted to say that i love your videos like so much and they made little me so happy and they still do!! Thabks for these super cool vidoes :)
Good Job Katherine♡ NOW GIVE HIM A BOYFRIEND!!!
Love Heathcliff <3
i think this is one of my fave dolls you’ve ever made!! omg!!
oh no, he's hot
Oh next Halloween you should do the pumpkin king! That would be cool 😎
Idc this is Litten's long distance boyfriend and anyone who says otherwise is lying
Oh no he's hooot Hahaha This is always my favorite time of year on your channel. I LOVE how you do the extra little show at the end and the adorable art that accompanies it
omg I would kill for a print of the photo booth photo!!!! it's so cute and you could do a whole series with the other dolls and thier friends omg i would kill for it
He reminds me of Dabi from My hero academia so much. Great work as always ♥
I love how much be gives off the "I'm Chuck Bass" look
THEM NAILS WAS BLUGHT IN BULK (no hate just a joke I love this creatore and her videos)
im trying so hard not to call him karkat vantas but im so sorry. i need to be cured </3
Why does he look like marasha lea from adventure time
He’s so fun!
Ok but why do I ship him with the demon girl🤭
He almost looks like hero from big hero 6
genuinely want a webcomic with your spooky characters because pf that last scene!! praying you draw it or collab with an artist because i would pay to see that 🙏
he's... actually kinda... hot
He looks like he’d say “where my hug at?” in the halls when a girl passes by 😭 He looks amazing
SO SICK I LOVE THIS
He’s a twink, in a good way
He's my favorite male doll ever, i love him😭
vampires are flexible, but always, ALWAYS queer, even when they dont know it
I love how he’s just a anime boy
the portaits from different eras at the end are so good!! it's a such a good story telling device and each era is done so well, really grabbing the essence of the styles!!
"Bring him to life": Very true on Halloween dolls!
He gives Marshall Lee energy!
Ahhh girl cover up you windows people can find your house with that kinda stuff😭
You totally should've made that line down his face into a scar
KATHERINE RESPECTFULLY HES SO HOT
I LOVE HIM! I LOOOOVE HIM!! HES JUST LIKE MEEEEEE
he looks amazing, and oddly enough I get older brother vibes from him, I don't know if its because of his face or looks in general but I will say, he'd probably be the one annoying older brother that cares a lot about his younger sibling(s)
aaa he's so pretty!! And I love the art at the end 🥺 so cute
I still miss Wendy..
Have you created people size clothing from your doll outfit pattern because in my mind I can imagine a runway show with the doll and yourself modeling the clothing
❤ my daughter also loves it, we agree that the smile gives him wonderful charm
Emo Astarion
Imagining getting turned at like age 18 and you’re just a Twink forever
Perfect couple 👌
He needs to be member's bf!
Shiiiiiiiiip demon girl and vampy boy
I know this sounds weird. But I've never seen such a sexy doll in my life 👀😅
❤❤❤love your work's
honestly the 80s poof looked really cool! would love to see a doll with it someday
Omg! He look soooo cool!!
I actually loved the 80s poof. It’d be cool to see a ‘through the ages’ doll line
STOP NO HES HOT AHHHH CAN HE BE GAY OR SMTH LOL
why did you name him after two candy bars?
i literally love these just to look at the concept art, her art is actually so cool and has really developed over time
i looooooooove your videos sooooooooooooooooo much
I love how the mouth sculpt came out! It was so cool and clever that you placed it inside the skull instead of sculpting it on the outside!! It really elevated the doll from production line to OOAK without having to do as much body modifications! The paint line looks like a cool scar, as well. I would love to see a little brother in the modern outfit that was discarded!
LOL I love that you included Edward Cullen with all the vampires. :D I love the teeth! That is epic! He looks great!!! The perfect combination of modern and traditional! I love him! And those nails, wow! Outstanding!
She said a classic Halloween monster YET WE HAVENT GOTTEN A PROPPER ZOMBIE YET😭
he looks great but the shoes kinda ruin it 😭
13:03 Why does it look like hes doing the MR BEAAASST Pose.
Ah this may be my favorite male doll of yours yet! Heathcliff reminds me a bit of Zagreus from the game Hades by supergiant games, something about his tossed black hair and the cheeky smirk gives him a bit of similarity to the character. I love how he draws a bit from the old fashioned vampire look and a more modern day streetwear kind of aesthetic, i think the shoes really bring the two aesthetics together I'm so happy you decided to go with those!
he's a cutie for sure!!
Had me at seductive 💋
Please tell me that outfit of his is gonna be in your Etsy shop I need to make it!!!  Love Heathcliff so much!!!
heathcliff is SO marshall lee from fionna and cake. i love him
idk guys i want him in evil ways
I saw the thumbnail before reading the title and I thought you were making an Hellsing Alucard for an sec😅😂
The face up looks like joo jaekyung from jinx
He is so Handsome.. almost like a KPop boyband star
Now all he needs is that blood in a wine glass like in the concept art❤❤
The sequence with the paintings is giving me what we do in the shadows intro vibes
He's so cuuuteee!!!! The slick kicks were definitely the right choice for him!
May I just say, he is so fine
I like to think that Heath and Ember and a cute demonic couple >:] Goat Father doesn’t fully approve tho😅
everyone's talking about the craftsmanship & the scar (and don't get me wrong I love it and you have the hands of a goddess to make him) but my favorite part is that he has a little loincloth throughout the entire process
Kathrine really made doll dentures 😭
next year you should make the vintage black cat with the witch's hat.
I feel like Katherine needs to make herself. A mad scientist costume for her character so that she has a reason to perform these experiments. Ps. I love this doll and I think he turned out so handsome but I think I would have liked to see a menacing grin or smile rather than a smirk. But that's personal preference.
i absolutely love this guy. the jacket is so cool and the nikes look absolutely stupid in the best way possible. also holy shit the gallery at the end???? so awesome
So cool, I love this vampire, he is so expressive ! I'm very amazed about your talent. You're amazing Katherine ! :D
Wow Catherine, this doll is amazing. I love his vampire details. It definitely screams vampire teenage boy The details in his mouth absolutely amazing to the boots to the pants everything about this doll dreams vampire
He gives me Danny Phantom vibes
Is the design maybe a tad cliché? Maybe. But to I absolutely adore him? Absolutely!! He might be my favorite of the year so far! I love his smirk, his outfit is so cool, I love him
Here's an idea for next year: you could do a pair of dolls and make them doctor Frankenstein and your own take one the creation‼️ THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL TO SEE 🤩
the mouth technique you used is so gorgeous you should defo use it more!! a zombie doll would look so good with a ripped mouth using that technique!!
His smirk reminds me of Jack from An American Werewolf In London 🤣
i feel like you should have colored the mouth pieces before putting them on lol
That smirk is the the best. He's one of my all time favorites!
Oh my God, that art at the end m
The Art At the End. I LOVED THAT!!!
Umm! I need his jacket, but in me size!! Haha.
Really impressed that you went the extra mile with that smile!!! Great work!!
You should make one that is inspired by a jack o lantern I think that would be really cute
Kinda gives MJ thriller vibes… almost.
such a fun doll and always great to use more male dolls. the teeth modification has to be one of my favourites you have done. turned out amazing.
i feel like him and ember would have a thing😂😂
i could take him (not in a fight)
I want to see the doll version of the paintings!
I'm so in love with all of your work <3 <3
Im going so crazy over this doll, of all years to do a biker vampire boy its the year I got super obsessed with vampires. he looks incredible T-T
I hope you take this as the immense compliment I mean it as: His design is very Genshin, very Honkai Star Rail. He is the most in the best way and I am watching this the second time now because I like his design so much.
This vampire would mix modern day slang from multiple eras of slang. Man would say “radical” unironically.
I love him
WHY IS HE SO HOT
I really like the idea of a vampire who picks and chooses their favorite fashion aesthetics to keep up with the times; like we’ve got the Victorian Gothic inspired look, combined with a little bit of a modern punk vibe, and of course the fresh kicks. It’s fun to see a unique coord come together, and the classic color palette really unifies things!🧛🏻
Adored the little goosebumps moment with the red eyes lol♡
I looked for a good bit for the wendigo doll then I remembered her video was deleted little sad but I understand reasons
I love him, he looks particularly annoying in a "he thinks he is really hot" way
your character designs always go so insanely hard
Next year zombie!!! When I saw you cut out the mouth for some reason all I could see in my head was a zombie!
this is one of my favourite face-ups youve done tbh, what a silly guy
HE LOOKS SO SICK. I love how he turned out, I was getting increasingly hyped through the whole process!!
I would love to see u make cute creepy dolls!:)
he looks like he's got the not-so-sweet temperament of peter pan and the boyish charm of jack frost from _rise of the guardians._ noice!
as always i love watching you redo the dolls they always rock!
I bet if you made an anime about your characters he would be the one with the most simps
what a beautiful doll! i love him😭
Hey Dollightful! I know Halloween has already passed but my fiance and I watch your channel all the time, and we both came up for a suggestion. Maybe for next Halloween, you coukd make a zombie doll? It'd be really cool too see!
the true monster is definitely the air brush.
Hahahaha which monster repaint did you first join Katherine?
LOVE IT!!!!   I have wanted a Male vampire Monster High doll since the beginning!  I'm thinking of transforming the G3 Clawd doll into a vampire named "Drak"...anything to make him look a little more manly.
AGH!!! I think this is my favourite Halloween doll yet!!! I love the lore he has in the hallway!!! It's so cool!!!! I also mean this in the most complimentary way possible, but he seems like one of the options you'd get in a monster otome dating game. His design is so goooood!!!!
Anyone shipping amber and heathcliff? 😅
OBSESSED with the individual mini paintings you did for him
chop chop dollightful its been 3 days time for a Christmas doll
looks like Eugene Lee Yang!
As soon as I saw the jays my brain was like   "That's right, Spiderman. I'm gonna crease your jays."
I feel like hes about five seconds from telling me hes walkin 'ere!
your dolls get better each time! he has so much expression and personality just from his face
Plsssss do a monster high doll repaint
ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE YOUVE MADE A MALE DOLL!! :D
HOLY MOLY HE LOOKS DOPE ASF!!!!!!!§ UUAJAJAKAOMOLDP
WHAT IF HE HAD A BOYFRIEND WHO WAS A ZOMBIE..
i-is he s-s-single...
I am absolutely in love with this doll, every halloween doll you make is incredible, but I'm especially happy to see such a cool and handsome vampire man join the line up!! 😍😍😍
Dollightful I think I have a crush on him now 😅 plus his giving Korean vides😅
Gasp 😲its a rare boy doll done by katherine and its a hot vampire boy doll.😍🤣
So cool that you made a vampire doll the same year I decided to be a vampire for halloween ❤🧛🏼
Make a cute little brother for him 😁 you can use the cute outfits
i love him 😭 i want to watch an anime about him
The sets you make are amazing and I would love an entire movie one day with all your dolls as characters I know you’d never have the time but I for one would pay to see it!!
I loved seeing this boy doll customisation! I think it would be so so cool if you took a male doll and transformed them into a drag queen! You get all the joy of designing a feminine character but with the twist of seeing it on a male doll!
Next year he should get a boyfriend
Im in love😍
the hairstyle before you trimmed the wefts was unironically amazing lol, it would be cool to see a doll with that style in the future!! as always, amazing job. :) he looks great
Love him and his name is just perfect
Ok but like...why do I get the vibe he is Draculaura's brother or something lol
I understand why Katherine removed Wendy the wendigo from future videos, but this opening shot just really made me miss her for some reason.
i love the face up so much!!! and heck yeah he's definitely got a big personality!!! lovely! he might be my new fave halloween doll now
He looks like a teenaged vampire, lost in rebellion but has to conform to the Clan Elders' command.🧛🏻‍♂
he looks just like @drawyu
ele ficou IGUAL ao @drawyu
Amazing as always!! The dolls you make are always so unique and beautiful,, I would love to see your take on ouji fashion someday! I'm a sucker for vampire related stuff and Heathcliff turned out AWESOME
Why is he kinda😏…
I never thought id say this but i have been seduced by a doll, DAMN HES HANDSOME. I need him to have either a cute sad zombie as a boyfriend or an easterbunny themed boyfriend THATD BE SO CUTEE
I love the accident line! He has a scar!!!!
That is awesome ❤❤❤❤
IM OBSESSED WITH HIMMMM he came out so good he's a joy to look at!! I also love everything about the ending mini film, it looks wonderful!!! I'm always absolutely delighted to see you create an actual universe with your dolls as characters. Fantastic job as always!!
Giving bi
you HAVE to do a pirate doll!!
It would be very cool if she makes a female vampire with dusty gold eyes for his partner!
No one: That one friend group 17:04
How kind of Katherine to craft us all a boyfriend
1:36 he just reminds me of Valentine from Monster High Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love he  reminds me of him so much
I love him so much. Honestly always get so happy when i see a new dolightfull video!
TEN OUTTA TEN for doll And I would SO READ A COMIC of those three at the end! THAT WOULD BE SO GOOD
OH NO HE'S HOT
I was thinking of him as a boyfriend to Ember and that last picture makes me want that even more
I looooove the Halloween series! Her videos are so fun I've watched every customization video at least once and the old ones for the nostalgia even thrice or more😂❤ i can only remember how i found her account years ago and began to try and fix all the hairless dolls but never had the patience to finish the project so now i just have a massive amount of beheaded barbies lying in my basement😅
He is such a cutie!!
Love this doll and ADORE the little art gallery at the end?! Amazing
not me immediately thinking Heathcliff could be the demons boyfriend😭
Oh it’s all so good!! The drawings especially were so amazing! So much detail and effort. Thank you so much Katherine and Happy Halloween 🎃🩸👹😈!!
Oml I'm such a sucker for Vampires
Dollightfull: I do love the artists who sculpt the heads. There just so pretty.  Also dollightfull: *brings out knife and starts cutting*
its giving vampire knight and a little bit of blue exorcist. definitely nailed the cheeky dark anime boy look
why does he remind me of jack frost?
love this doll and his toothy grin
I think I need to see a zombie rock star boy now lol
He looks like a goth Jack Frost. I love him!
He reminds me of the singing boys from turning red
I will not simp for a doll. I will not simp for a doll. I will not simp for a doll. I will not simp for a doll. I am simping for a doll.
this fully reinforces the vampire obsession/researching i had in like July was absolutely worth it. my favorite vampire trait is arithmomania aka "i have to pick up/count the tiny things you've thrown at me and i can't stop until I'm done or someone gets me to stop." so, living on the beach is probably your best vampire prevention method. :)
saved this vid for halloween! 🎃 wonderful work as always, hope to see the next project ✨
You shoud make carrie white from carrie
heathcliff reminds me SO MUCH of nct's Jaehyun HAHAHAHA
I just wanted to come back to this vid and say happy Halloween to everyone! 👻 🎃 🧡
Wow incredible!! the 3D teeth and the entire outfit!! so amazing!!!
KATHERINE YOU ABSOLUTE MAD WOMAN YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!!! Made a character I'm completely in love with!!! Of course that could be said about all the characters you create, but snarky characters and vampires in general have a soft spot in my heart, so Heathcliff is totally one of my new favorites of yours!!! I adore the bat detail on the jacket, and the big ole shoes help balance out the Monster Hear big ole head!! I also looooove all the art you made for him!!! I just gotta see them up close, I hope you post them on your instagram at some point!! Happy Halloween!!!
That mouth smirk is incredible i am in awe omg
man!!! he reminds me so much of one of the characters from the little vampire! probs the animated one tho
Heathcliff looks at home in the The Last Bloodline webtoon and I love that so much
Why does he look like Eugene from the Try guys?
10:06 BILL KAULITZ?!!
He's giving Katsuki Bakugo, and I'm here for it. XD
that’s just Karkat vantas I love him
Katherine saying how she has never made a vampire before forgetting about her collaboration with hexton and how his design was a vampire
Me, seeing the concept art: oh…oh…what if…what if I just. Made that. For me. To wear. Full size….
He looks like he’s about to hand sanitizer hands at me (I do love him though very nice)
This is probably one of my favorite of Katherine’s! Love it ❤
I loove him. The 3d smile is genius
Did she do a zombie? Is it just me? Also, HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃 :>
KATHRINE, HE LOOKS LIKE KARKAT- XD  Edit; Also, I saw Zura and GoatDad holding hands! ❤
He got that jack frost smirk 😏
watching that painting gums and I'm thinking...did you ever try to paint so small areas with nail art brushes?
He’s so cool! 😎
He kinda looks like Marshall lee ~ which is not a bad thing 😎
your attention to detail is always so impressive. i love the photo of him hanging upside down, and all the amazing illustrations in the sequence at the end of the video! so awesome, thanks Katherine!
this doll is so cute and i love his nails!!
she's done it again! amazing work katherine!
i think the faint line on the cheek would've looked cool as a faded scar- also this outfit is rad, biker vest with tails and puffy sleeves and sneakers works so well
Love the art at the end!!!
omg he’s such a cutie 😭😭 really giving Edward Cullen a run for his money! great work katherine!!
What happened to the windigo I miss that video and I try to search for it
I love how your design could totally be a pic that corpse husband would use for his songs/profile picture
What a cutie! I love him! Especially his mouth and clothes turned out so well! 😍😍😍
Watching this Cast of Halloween Doll Characters grow over the years is amazing!!!! I’m really excited when you customize male dolls because it’s a rarity. Heathcliff has a lot of personality. And Lore…!! 🥹🥹🥹
i’m obsessed with the “ma!! look at my new kicks” pose
The art at the end was such a treat 😍😍😍😍 you’re so inspirational to me
Not to be that guy…. But it pained me to think when she showed the first concept art “Is that Karkat?”  The final product and definitely did not look like that anymore though. I love this lil stinker!
he really got that "it's ya boy, Guzma" pose at 13:08
I really looking forward for moth doll. I remember u already have done one, but she’s so bright and lovely. We need dark and deadly one😈
I love him! He is the perfect inspo I needed ^^  Question: will the drawings at the end be posted on instagram? They look so nice, especially the last ones^^
Katherine arent u scared about the black staining?
Meh
I love this doll and that ending was perfect!
Just think of the line on his face as a scar or even a vain due to him being a vampire. Its the tiny imperfections that give a lot of character.
Heatcliff is a great name😍it reminded me of a character from the book wuthering heights, also named heatcliff, who was very rough and sadistic, kinda twisted, but also battling for a girls heart, so it suits him so much😍
Is this a homestuck reference..?
PLEASE that vampire is SO my type. Too bad he isnt real
OMG Heathcliff Is Cute, I'm Obsessed With Vampires, I Love Vampires, Now I Want To Make My Vampire Doll^-^
Wow! Those mods are awesome and I love all the artwork too!
I feel like hes the kind of dude who watches incomprehensible old japanese horror movies and talks about them like hes patrick bateman
He looks like he was turned to a vampire when he was a teen, since vampires dont age he’s probably stayed like that for a few hundred years
Oh no he’s hot
Is Heath single? Asking for...reasons👉👈
PLEASEEEE MORE CUTE BOYS I CANT THAT SMILE AND THICK EYEBROWS ARE SO YUMMY
He gives off a Kpop or Kdrama vampire feel.
He’s a perfect fit in your awesome Halloween family.
Me simping for a doll? Could never 👀
17:02 grey sweater... red eyes... curly hair... horns... karkat.......... homestuck jokes aside, such a great doll! you did heathcliff's teeth perfect! btw, do you plan on posting the illustrations you made for his gallery wall online? id love to see them up close!
ngl the concept art kinda looks like k9kuro
biker fashion and pirate fashion have surprising overlap
Its sad she had to get rid of wendigo..
It's really giving off Alucard and young Walter's (Hellsing) secret lovechild, and as someone who had a crush on both as a teen it really hits
Match the shoes! But he’s hella cute
Katherine, I know you're thrifty, but you need some new gloves to protect your hands when you're using Apoxie Sculpt! It's really bad for you. Also, here's something I saw on Ace of Clay's channel that might help with the open mouth situation next time: he paints interior things (like mouths) before he sculpts over them, so maybe you could do that before you put in the teeth! You could probably prime/paint them separately and put them in after the airbrush step. Don't know if this will help, but I thought it was neat! Love the final result! My favorite touch was the hall of paintings of this character!
With how much you cut up dolls to modify them, I'm surprised you haven't done a Frankenstein by now!
I looooooooove Heathcliff! He's so cool!
idea for halloween doll - sheet ghost but make them wear super cute legwarmers and mary janes.
He looks like a demon slayer character!
This was so close to being Astarion. ;-;
getting gender envy from a doll sure is something
OH MY GOSH you just keep getting better and better I LOVE THE MOUTH and TEETH and such COOL OUTFIT the eyes look 2 dimentional. Any one know how to stop clay coming away from head if you squish it, it tends to come away from the plastic head of doll?
to keep the Traditional Halloween Aesthetic maybe Next year is a Zombie?! LOL JK JK
He's so cool! But his teeth kinda sets me off ngl...
I honestly didn’t notice the line on his face until you mentioned that it was there and then I thought it was a cool scar
i never thought i’d have a crush on a doll as an adult but here i am
10:07 i think this means we need a glamrock vampire now!! ✨
you’ve outdone yourself with that mouth and teeth set!!! Well done, as always.
I adore how the teeth came out, this is wonderful.
he kinda looks like wriothesely from genshin if he was a vampire
I LOVE HIM. this is exactly how i look and dress but i WISH i was a vampire xDD well done again katherine 🫶
Looks so good!  I think you would be able to make an amazing series based on mythology/folklore.
Okay he's fine ASF though😔
He ended up having such a personality!!! Really cool.. also after those pics at the end, I am shipping him with Ember now 😅
....why he kinda hot tho..... ummm... what?....who said that?
The line on the face doesn't really bother me, if anything it looks like a scar that he earned in battle. Which kinda gives him a cool backstory.  💚🤟
this doll looks so cool! he is so stylish
He looks like the boy from the little vampire movie😊
I think he’s wonderful. But he kind of looks like a member of Enhypen. 😂 Especially after seeing Criminal Love. Either way he’s a masterpiece as always.
You could've made that line into a scare
Am I the only one who totally ships Ember and Heathcliff?
Give it up for a dollightful rarity: A MALE DOLL 👏👏👏👏👏  (all jokes! The doll is absolutely beautiful! ❤)
Moonlight jewel uses hot glue for nails once!
He reminds me of Dorian Gray. (Maybe it's because I just finished that book or because they are both immortal beings.)
Holy Rabies!!!, I'm crushing on this Vampire Doll😅❤, he's just so devilishly handsome😳😍
How did you make the belt buckles out of paper clips
You just made a goth kid 😂😂
Как же это шикарно!  Люблю Ваше творчество всем сердцем!
He gives off ringleader vibes somehow? I'd love to see spooky clown vampires to go with him
Wow I love the doll, but can we just appreciate the artwork on the hallway walls! That's amazing, I mean the time spent on these alone. 💕✨😵😵‍💫
Geez, Barb!
Mikey Way vibes
It’s not very good. Honestly, it doesn’t even have fangs. It’s not really a vampire. It’s just a ugly boy.
I love how he looks more "classic vampire" but then hes got the big nike shoes-
I get that at the end of the day, the final product will never 100% resemble the concept art, but to me, the final look of the doll reads a little bit younger than what the concept art showed. Like, his eyes looked a little bigger or more open than what the concept art showed. I don't hate it or think its bad at all, it just gives me the vibe that Heathcliff became a vampire a little but younger than what we typically think.   In my headcannon thoughts, i would like to imagine that Heathcliff was around 15 when he became a vampire. When he was human, he was a little bit of a crappy and cocky kid and when he became a vampire, the powers he gained went straight to his head and the immortality didn't let him age out of his immaturity, despite being a couple hundred years old at this point.  This kid was probably voted most likely to seriously suggest committing a crime (in a creepy way) to solve a problem and loves showing off his sneakers every chance he gets event though they're really an off brand pair from Wal-Mart and his mom never had the heart to tell him.  Thanks for reading. Like i said, this is just my headcannon of this character, so take what you will. Happy Halloween, everyone. Stay safe if you're heading out. 🎃
I like to see a zombie one
i have a crush on him
i think you shouldve run with that crack on his face and turned it into a wicked scar! it wouldve looked great on a vampire!
he rlly said  “it’s you n me in this worrrll~🧛🏻🩸💋”
I was so nervous when you were cutting up his face but OMG the toothy grin came out SO CUTE. Also love the photo booth pictures from the end!!
The smirk and wavy hair reminds me of Jasper from Twilight!
I know and love vampires more than the back of my hand and I absolutely love all of this!
He looks like he got his wisdom teeth removed and he has the cotton things in his mouth lmao
I lost it at “JEEZ BARB!”
bruh all I can think about at 13:04 was the "All this is here for youuuuuu" memes
LOVED this video Katherine !!!!!!
Katherine!  You made art of Heathcliff in different eras and you DIDN'T make an 80's version with insane hair? What were you thinking?  Lol, seriously though, I love him.
OH NO HES HOOOOT
I miss Wendy
Why he kinda….
Seeing the smirk, the very first thing I thought of was fruity Dracula from the Dracula: a comedy of terrors play.
whats the brand of those shoes ? wondering if i can find something similar online ^w^ would be awfully helpful and love the spoopy doll he came out cool and adorable ^w^
Why do i see emo bakugo😂😅
The ending photos 😭 I want to read a webtoon about those 3 so bad! Your art is so pretty and cute
You did not just catch me simping for the concept art of a DOLL- 😭
u should make the line across his face a stitch mark orsmthn idk
i LOVE him! instant favourite and probably the best masculine doll katherine's made yet. he's bold, stylistic and fashionable!  though, one thing, can't help but wonder why kath didn't paint the teeth BEFORE they were put in the face. woooouldn't that have been a bit easier?
He’s amazing Katherine! You never disappoint! ❤❤❤ We can just say the line is a “battle scar” from like the 1700’s or something 👀😂 He kinda reminds me of Rudolph from The Little Vampire but just older and modern 😭🖤
Why not paint the teeth before putting Them in?
He bad🤞🏾
He came out so cute!! And the art at the end!!! The whole hallway was so cute- the style range you have is fantastic!
PLEASE make the PhotoBooth pictures a print we can buy, I'll take ten!!!
I'm sorry, the whole dark and brooding asthetic falls abart when I see his nikies It ruins the whole vibe for me, and I just can't take him seriously😂
I was anticipating something incredible at the end, but an entire art gallery showcased as his different eras. I’m so hyped for his relationship with the ghouls despite it only being a Photo Booth drawing that we get. It’s fitting but now I’m obsessed with how the characters would’ve interacted. Beautiful little piece of story for the viewers! The editing of him transforming was sick too ❤
HE!!!! I love him Holy crap!
punk vampire!
I want him to have his own comic book! He has so much character
He’s so versatile! Mind you I am a Gen X person, so I’m bouncing between what its is that he reminds me of… is he a Sid Vicious vampire? Is he a beautiful k-pop boy?  Is he Popular Anime Character? I love his design, I love the stop-motion animation, and all in all you knocked this out of the park! Love it!!!
have you ever considered making an art book? I know I for one would buy that so fast! it could include concept art for dolls and maybe the sketches that don't make it in to the videos and all the drawings you did for this video and zura's video. along with thumbnails for things like the ending skits for your Halloween videos. I don't know if you always do them but I remember you sharing some a couple years back for ember's video I think. also behind the scenes things like the sets you build for the Halloween videos, work in progress shots of the dolls and of coarse any of your non doll related art because its all beautiful!
He's pretty hot for a dead guy
GAHH i love the art of him so much!! please sell prints of that little comic at the end!
I watch for the dolls, my kids watch for the last minute of cats 😂
I was kinda hoping for a new bony character to take the place of the doll that was removed from the Halloween line-up. Maybe next year!
The line on the face looks like a scar so I don't mind it
I would actually die to see the character from that Arrow Collar and Shirts advert turned into a doll
He has such an older brother vibe and I think he deserves a little sister
Your attention to details, arts and backstories for every charachter gives me SO much creative joy! That is just so heartwarming and inspireing, thank you for making those videos!)
At  9:35 I was like Michael Jackson?!
This made me think of Alucard from Hellsing!!! I think you could TOTALLY pull that off!!
I kinda LOVE the crack on his face! It fits so well!! Also he looks seductive from EVERY ANGLE KATHERINE THIS MAN HAS FANFICS ABOUT HIM
I don't think it works with the lore-- Heathcliff seems like a loner who just wandered into the group-- but because you used former Goatman yarn for his hair,  I've kind of been imagining he's Goatman's nephew/Ember's annoying cousin. Also, I'm sure you never hear the end of the Halloween video requests, but if I can put my two cents in regardless, I would LOVE to see a headless horseman doll someday!!
His face is SO adorable and full of personality. Love this take on a vampire. Happy Halloween!
He's giving big Asterian vibes from baulders gate 3
from the concept art alone - he looks like what you'd get if you combined all 4 members of revenge era my chemical romance
Incredible as always
omg stop i love him
Do I see a bit of a relationship with him and ember 😍
I can picture Heathcliff flirting with Ember and Goat Dad going chasing him away with a crucifix and garlic
I don't like him, he looks creepy like he wants to kill me... Mission accomplished i guess, kathrine.😅
Remember this doll that was canceled ? I miss this video so much, this doll was my favorite ! This halloween video give me so much memories of this doll, I wish I could rewatch it. 😔 I love those halloween doll !
I don't know why, but I like him even just in shorts XD
Maybe some day an 80s poof glam werewolf 😊
Can't wait for the zombie next year! Lol ❤❤❤
Can u do a a white and black greyish doll 🖤🤍🩶
he looks so much like Oliver Sykes' vampire character in the CODE MISTAKE vid by CORPSE and Bring Me The Horizon I love it so, so much!!
the end AGHHH IS SO COOL!!
He looks so BoyFailure and i love him so much
Katherine has such a lovely artstyle, I love seeing her art come to life!! I also wish she shared more of her art! it’s amazing ❤😊
He's giving cocky prince of the night vibes, like, there a bit more he has to learn before becoming KING of the night
with the streak on the face you could turn it into a scar to make it look purposeful
PIRATE SHIRT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN PIRATE SHIRT
Ah yes the spooky time is here, and the Halloween doll videos are here too!!!
RIN FROM BLUE EXORCIST VIBES I love him
Despite being a Halloween doll, I 100 percent believe him and Guinevere go clubbing together and will bring the others, hallowen or not, to join
that isn’t much of a defect to me, cuz it makes his cheek bones look more define and like more vampire like? Idk if that makes sense and it’s js my opinion
This is a great doll and I really love his design, but I do have one small critique. His smirk doesn't reach his eye, (I'm sure you know but) when people genuinely smile you can see it in their eyes, their eyes squint, and the skin around them crinkles (you yourself have a beautiful smile, and when you are happy, the whole world can see it in your eyes), the same is true for when people smirk. At least one of the eyes is affected by the half-smile of a smirk, and to put it simply, he looks like he's forcing it. Even a droop of his right eyebrow would help fix this, but his eyes are lifeless (haha get it?). Half of his face looks serious but then you look at his mouth and he's got a goofy smirk on that, admittedly, looks fake. Still, it's a really cool smirk and despite this minor flaw, this is a 10/10 doll.
If doll, why hot hehe
Ngl he kinda reminds me of shinra from fire force, but in a good way.
Can you make a girl vampire please?
*shaking and vibrating in an attempt to not simp for a literal doll*
He turned out so handsome!! I love the teeth, amazing work as always. I look forward to your Halloween video each year :-) Also, he's kind of giving Dante DMC vibes and I LOVE it
This is definitely my favorite doll of yours, omg I love him so much
He reminds me of your husbands doll! Probably why he ended up so super cute 🥰
This gives Scooby Doo meets Lost Boys meets Monster High vibes
I have no clue about the world of doll modification, or any intention of getting into it, and I'm such a fan of your content! This video was one of the best you've ever made, and really highlights your imagination, creativity and production values, making something so many people can enjoy 🎉 I'm awed by what must be so much time and effort you put into making such high quality videos, thank you! Happy Halloween, and looking forward to future creations 😊
Wowww the gallery of him in different types of art and eras was so awesome! I especially loved the “immigrant arriving” one it looks so cool ^^ I would definitely buy it as a print !
Every time one of your videos drops, I have to watch it immediately. Thanks for making A+ content!
Dollightful: Surgeon, semestress, and...orthodontist?
astarion vibes , love it
Ahh! I love his grin so much it really can look cheeky and mischievous or sinister depending on the shot! There's so much personality in it  Also that ending animation is so cute with all the pictures of him through the years especially the one with him and the girls! adorable!
New vampire heartthrob
It’s @nikkisixx there for a minute
The little end scene is so cute!!! It really shows just how much she cares about every single doll that she makes. I’ve been watching her since childhood and it never gets old 💛💛
13:50 bro is rocking Jordans in the 1700s LMAO
Every video. Every doll. Every detail. You are an incredible artist Katherine. Thank you for always putting a smile on my face and sharing your talent with all of us. Love ya, Happy Halloween!💜🎃👻
those string lights would make great trick or treat buckets, by just cutting the top off and adding a handle
he looks like marshall lee from adventure time
Can you do a FNAF inspired doll?
i love him!
Heathcliff totally needs a lil brother with the cute outfit pieces you made!
Finally!!! I was waiting sooo long for this years especial😍😍😍
Where’s his glass of blood please do the cup!
hes so silly i love him
The paint mess up on his face looks like it’s a really cool scar. Maybe a fight he had in the past!
I love it, and he look amazing. Keep up with the work and keep it amazing. And HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!🎃👻
Booktok has enter the chat
he looks like a cross between kiri from bnha and valentine fron why do gouls fall inlove
Why do I kinda ship Ember and Heathcliff now?
He's just the cutest little troublemaker!!! I love the way you made the teeth 3d! ❤❤❤
Can someone explain to me why the video of the wendigo was taken down and the doll itself is no longer shown? what happened?
the crack that happened you should make it a scar :)
He looks... He looks... Like he needs .... A bf
Amazing work! I love the jacket so much, and would absolutely wear it myself. I always look forward to the Halloween dolls and seeing their cast/story build with each new year. The paintings in the hall were so cool and ending on the photobooth pictures was soooooo cute!
I love the little mini movies you make at the end of ur Halloween videos
everytime katherine mentions the unstyled hair i wish she’d make a crazy, colorful, fabulous disco doll already! 🪩
So spooky 😮  I love it and 10 out of 10 for this doll. 😊😄
I think he looks little like anzai from devils line 🥰
He is so cool. The mouth you gave him gives him so much personality. Congratulations on another awesome Halloween character!!! 👏
I saw the open mouth in the thumbnail and was SO EXCITED to see how you'd pull it off! He looks amazing and his faceup turned out fabulous!
He's literally looks like he'd ask me "How's it fanging?"
Aaah I love him 😭❤‍🩹 The arts at the end are so cute!!
I am so OBSESSED with him! He looks so smug and sassy
Immaculate vibes
The crack looks cool, like maybe it’s a scar from being burnt in the sun?
he looks like one of those annoying edgy v-tuber guys QvQ still, you did great job on making him. the clothes and the makeup are very pretty
You should make a humanoid pumpkin doll next but make two heads one the pumpkin and a regular head or make it a mask,also take the concept from the head less horse man and Cinderella but make them cute
okay im gonna say this to all of you. if you ever mess up on something but its small and doesn't ruin the entire doll then pretend it was intended, like with that line on his face you could pretend he got into a fight and got scratched!
Always love when you make a boy doll they're always so Gender™ to me, as a goth transguy this one particularly gave me some gender envy, absolutely love him!!
He reminds me of boy band members in "spooky" monster videos.
If anyone asks me my gender ill show them this
I'm going to be honest, those canines could've been bigger. Go cartoonishly big! :D
Love the face!!!
OH NO HE'S HAAAWWWWTTT
oh my god, your work with the mouth reconstructions was incredible. Once again you did an amazing job!!!
Amazing, I wish I could look at him all day haha
Beautiful work as always, Katherine! ❤
overly dramatic immortal edgelord who is slowly being worn down by his two annoying friends
I ship Heathcliff and the Demon
Your Halloween dolls make my Halloween special every year
The traditional final touch of the stop motion clip of the new doll is exquisite as always. Just one of the many things that makes your videos top notch and one mark above the rest. Thank you so much for your attention to details, K.
He’s gore-geous! Happy Halloween!  🎃
With the line you could have made it into a small like scare it add to the astatic. As well as I imagine the little sucubis girl and him like somewhat I think or like really great friends
He looks like Jack Frost gone spooky 👻
He’s such a red flag, I’m in love. The video was wonderful ❤️
Dollightful Halloween video my beloved... He came out looking spooktacular 🧛‍♂️
The concept art had more of a "Akin strongboy" aesthetic and I would have gladly watched such a heavy mod design... But if we're talking pretty boy, Heathcliff fits it perfectly. also I ship Ember+Heathcliff.
Suddenly have the urge to read a vampire romance comic❤
He's giving Kingdom Hearts vibes, and I'm here for it.
You could've made the line down his face like a scar of something 🤷
Omggg I love watching your whole process in YouTube videos (been watching them ever since sylveon was made) it always makes me happy when I get to watch you make another doll. I think it would tie everything together if u made a monster hunter doll for next Halloween.
Im sorry but his mouth is so funny to me. I can't get over it. 😂😂😅
Im actually kind of obsessed with the mark on his face, gives an imperfect quality that makes him more alive!
That’s a really attractive piece of plastic, paint, and fabric. 😳
I lowkey feel that Heathcliff looks like Edward Zo
Love the jack-o-lantern dress on dollylightful, and adore this vampy boys mischievous smirk. I also really love his ears and coat! Your Halloween series are always some of my favorites!
I know this is the Halloween video but my comment is about the rainbow girls to make it not such a jump from pastel to that bright rainbow maybe making a doll that's between those color palettes would make it a little less of a jump
Oh man, I love the modern pants,, I'd nab em myself if they'd fit. Hope they show up again sometime, maybe.  The teeth are so cool. He's so adorable, lol.
I'd invite this dude inside anytime! You did amazing work on his face.
even tho that design wasn t used I HAVE to say that I absolutely LOVE that tiny romanian flag pin on the jacket <3
Love love love all the little details you added! 🥰
My one year old daughter has taken a liking to your videos and even clapped at the reveal 😂 awesome job!
Oh my golly gosh he is attractive
astarion and gortash’s love child makes an appearance
Heathcliff is an excellent name for a bratty teenage vampire.
i like the mark on his face, it reminds me of an old scar
Please make more videos please I love them ❤
For the literature nerds, HEATHCLIFF AND KATHERINE??? (Catherine)
Why does he remind me of a Emo Bakugo?
Sometimes I think you were meant to be a fashion designer but you got off at the wrong stop but ended up doing something better
VAMPIRE WITH THE NIKES😲
Omg he looks so much like Rodrick from diary of a wimpy kid!!? Love him!!
NOOOOOOOO WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE KARKAT IN THE DRAWINGS  😭😭😭
i really thought that thumbnail was huening kai 😭
I swear they made the hairpiece easier to take off *just* for doll customizers. Love that.  At 10:10 he reached the 'cropped michael jackson phase' as my brother, who was in the living room at the time, decided to call it 😭
Well this one holds a special place in my heart, I was a scare actor being a vampire this year so I really like this :3
Not me simping the moment the concept art was shown
You should use that more modern coat you made to give him a gothic punk little vampire sister! - I also think he should have a were-cat boyfriend named Garfield lol
In the ending artwork he literally looks like karkat vantas im 😭
you could of incorporated the line down his face as a cool looking scar!! would of hidden the actual line while making a pretty cool looking 3D scar!
Such a handsome one too. Great job Katherine! It's good to see ya back in the fray! We all hope all is well at home and can't wait for your first Halloween as a family! Congratulations and good luck!
AAAAAAAAA THE PORTAITS AND THE PHOTOBOOTH PICTURE!!!! I want that photobooth picture as a print or my phone wallpaper it's TOO CUTE
THIS FACEUP!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I kinda want some of those posters on his wall
Next Halloween he should bite a doll and get a girlfriend
Me simping for a doll 🖐️💀 I gotta quit simping just because the character happens to be a vampire 😂 (also, good job on this! Awesome as usual! 😎)
Oh i love him
your worldbuilding for your dolls is always amazing
I avoided this video all day bc I simp for enough fictional characters but your work is sooo amazing! I had to watch 🥲☺️
I'm so sorry, I'm gonna have to go against the public opinion 🙈it doesn't give me vampire vibes. I love the clothes and that is vampire style but the face... When I saw it I thought joker-like maniac that cut his own face. The fangs aren't even fangs, just slightly longer teath. If this guy walked up to me I wouldn't think he could possibly bite me, just that he's a crazy person 🤷🏻‍♀️  I do love you videos and still enjoyed watching ❤
Bro is alluringly attractive. Lord help me I need help.😂
could say the line down his face was a scratch from a warewolf  he looks awesome he looks a little like staz from the bloodlad anime
I live fot Kat Halloween dolls and short films, speacially the later. Watching how your different dolls meet each other every Halloween, the stories and details you come up with, ohhh how much I love them🧡🧡🧡 Thanks for always spoiling us in this spooky season!!!!🔥🎃🔥
the pictures and paintings at the end add so much more to him!! He looks so cool with the smirk🫶🫶🥹
Been here since 2017 and.. wow, it's been a while since I've visited this channel, I never understood how good you were at art and now that I look at it, it's really impressive, I absolutely love the rendering style
I really like him also, he kind a looks like Charlie from heartstopper’s
Glow in the dark paint on the eyes would have been cool, would have given the glowing vampiric eyes
the music for the photoshoot matches so well with his vibes!!
honestly the line across his face from the paint can be a scar :O
7:38 you could have made it into a scar ^^
It's giving beast boy vibes
is there a reason why you didn't paint the mouth before putting it in place? it just feels like it would've been easier to do, even though it still turned out amazing haha
"Depending on the angle and lighting, he can look friendly, seductive or sinister..." Or stoned. The red, half-lidded eyes and silly grin make him look stoned out of his mind. He looks very cool, and I love the design, but...I just can't unsee it. Vampire boy is baked.
I LOVE jaw surgery Halloween edition !! The 3D teeth are insane. Heathcliff is so cool and I love the absurd number of belts and collars, especially how they pop with the stripes ❤️‍🔥
Veeeery My Chemical Romance, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge vibes (especially the jacket) and I LOVE IT 😍❤️
the mouth sculpting portion reminding me a lot of the banshee's video! made me realise just how much more confident Katherine's been getting with her sculpting <3 (not that it wasn't already amazing back then but it's just amazing what she can do now :00)  Not only that but from the absolutely adorable eeveelutions series to the amazing dragon series, Katherine is truly someone i look up to because she's always pushing herself bit by bit and improving so much! I'm not sure if she'll ever see this, but I just wanted to say a huge thank you to her for helping me gain more courage to try more with my own art <33
Idk why but he gives he gay vibes,  but anyways amezing doll
dudeee I love him he's so cool
I soooooo ship Heathcliff and Ember! <3 They look so good together 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Surprised no one's said this yet, but he totally gives me Marshall Lee vibes from Adventure Time! Love this custom so much, great job!
The line on his face from peeling the paint could’ve been turned into a scar!!
Doll crush unlocked
Love him but something about the mouth feels off
The crack on his face is actually perfect it looks like a scar, maybe he got hurt while trying to hunt his prey!
THE PICTURES OHMIGOSH THEY WERE SO CUTE HE'S A PART OF THEIR GIANT FAMILY I LOVE IT
I feel like he is good friends with Tatsuo, having meet one random night.
He’s freakin adorable. ❤❤❤
Please make a black vampire doll
I would love to see someone make an animated series around Katherine’s characters or just like a book would be so adorable.
Zombie next!
I like your dolls but this doll hits different 😁
Next year you should do a Frankenstein or Zombie character!!! We need some green in this bunch lol
I'm not sure if this was intentional, but he totally looks like he could be a vamp character in Castlevania !
Sorry, Ik this is a doll customising video but how did he show up in the photo?
10:06 lookin like an extra from Lost Boys
I think he needs a crease on the side of his face that is upturned.
Heathcliff gives me the Count Dracula’s bratty/spoiled son I love it 😂
Love his expression, XD mischievous as hell
that face. THAT FACE. so SO so well done. he looks incredible!
it alright! it not subtle or nuanced, it tasteless and lukewarm but it alright... reminds me of me beer! Which is same beer, more or less...
this is probably my favorite face-up and face modification you've ever done. given, its more simple than a lot of your other dolls, but still the smirk and the way you drew his eyes and his brows are just so good I am absolutely in love with him. the open mouthed smirk and the teeth really just complete it.
I can’t be the only one who misses Wendy :(
I can't wait for another Halloween repaint I love the name I would have went with Dominic for the vampire have pleasant dreams ^-^
Youtube... why did I need to go LOOKING for this video.   I've been a fan since the beginning, I like every video and watch multiple times. WHY DID I HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR THIS VIDEO
I alsways enjoy seeing what new character you create as you always are sure to add a lot of personality to each one and make them feel like real people!! Keep up the great work but also make sure to take time for yourself when you need!!
Yeah... I would have had a crush on this character in high school >.>
Love it! I find myself excited for the end of the video. I get to see the characters come to life with the scenes! Have you thought of perhaps making a series of the characters living their day to day life?? 😮
Oh, Marshall Lee, the Vampire King, fancy seeing you here! :P Gorgeous doll <3
Smash.
so glad you made a new video. He is soo cute and beutyful. I have discovered your channel recently an I lovit so much that I watch every old video you had made!
It gives Marshall Lee from Adventure time
OMG the whole time I was like ahhh I hope he's embers boyfriend 😂
He looks like my ex boyfriend 😅
Have you ever thought about making a design for a doll out of already made clothes, wigs, and accessories
I love your videos, I love your process, I love your work, but the tea strainer over the paint cup for the airbrush paint makes me scream with the need to get a time machine and go back to high school and tell Previous Me to try that next time. And I had one like that, too. Future Me says thank you
OMG THE ART, THE DOLL, IT WAS MORE THAN MARVELOUS!!!
"I don't have a pattern but I believe in myself" as a cosplayer that's so relatable honestly
The spikey pants make me think of dinosaurs. We need a paleontologist dinosaur doll now with those pants
I love his design!
Im sorry Kat, but those are still 2 sifferent shoes 😭
I swear it was yesterday you did the werewolf doll. Am I getting old now that it feels like Halloween’s are passing by super fast?
marshall.. lee..
It's kind of surprising how* much of the vibe changes from flipping the concept art horizontally.  Wine in right hand: chilling socializing, partying.  Wine in left hand: "I'm pretending to be a party boy, but will claw your throat out without a second thought."
wow, this design especially looks like he could just up and start talking at any moment! he gives off such character
zAAAMNNNN He can get in this cooch whenever he wants😍🙏
I love him, he reminds me of marshall lee.
Katherine your always slaying. You left no crumbs with this doll.
HE LOOKS LIKE MARSHALL-LEE!!!
why he hot!
The artwork in the ending montage REALLY made it
Im ngl. Hes so hot. You did a great job with him. Cant wait to see what you pull up with next year !! 😁
I’m weirdly surprised you didn’t try to shrink his head
but when you expanded the mouth he lost his chin
1:39 it’s giving bloodborne protagonist!
He looks SO COOL!              His smile kind of reminds me of golem though ಡ⁠ ͜⁠ ⁠ʖ⁠ ⁠ಡ
i will never get over your art. i’ve been here for YEARS (since the first episode!) and i really love how much you’ve done and all the effort and absolute love. your work is so inspiring and delicately crafted. seriously adore you girl
What i actually mean when I say i want my man to look like a doll:  If you dont look like this doll dont even..just dont
YESSSS!!!!! ICONIC!!!!
Anyone else getting CORPSE vibes? I’m loving it!
He looks amazing! Great job!
I feel ur dolls could be their own show I love it
I think this is one of your best dolls yet
It almost looks like you are giving the doll a glascow smile, or a joker smile or Cheshire smile as some call it.
OMG HE SO CUTA, HANDSOME, BAD N COOL VAMP I CAN'T 🥺😭😭💞💕
Katherine are your gloves okay 😭 they have seen better days
Oh god the face-up does not fit the mouth well :( the smirk is so exaggerated and expressive it looks just silly with absolutely normal unexpressive eyes, maybe it could look better with more cunning eyes, more squinted? Man this is one unsexy smile
This goth is LIVING for the vampire 😫😍
He looks awesome! And the final clip was extremely good
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay Dollightful hallweem doll again!!!! Happiness!
the unintentionally / hilariously macabre nature of carving up a doll for body modification fits so well during the halloween season!! wonderful doll, i love him so much!!
17:05 HE LOOKS LIKE KARKAT IM SDRFGOBIG
I love this doll
Ahhh I adore this vampire, so cute! I hope that the artwork you shared at the end will eventually be on your zazzle to purchase? Would love a group illustration of all the halloween characters you done. Always love watching your videos Dollightful.
This reminds me of the vampire from the mine the little vampire ❤😂
hes embers boyfriend. i cant stop thinking about this.
It would be cute if you made him a little sister.
I adore the detail about his eyes. Using the gray really did make his catch lights stand out!
I don't know if I want him, his jacket or both 😂
I feel like hes giving JD from heathers vibe and i love it. I also think he wouldve looked so good with gauges!!!! Stretch ears and piercings wouldve been so cool
I’m the best way possible he looks like if hero from big hero six was a vampire and it’s adorable!
Glad to know my 11 year old self's tastes have remained even as my 30 year old self, pretty boy vampires will forever hold a place in my heart 😌♥️
I like the cartoon drawing of Heathcliff and the others characters at the end. You should make mangas!
Definitely love a vampire 🦇 currently reading a teen vampire novel series so I'm on a vampire kick lately
Еее, я долго ждал когда же ты наконец-то выпустишь видео 😊
he needed more fang for me but as always a 10/10
I ship him with ember they make such an adorable pair !!!!
I gasped aloud when I saw this was out! Halloween custom HYYYYPE!
I know you're not into sneaker culture but MAN I wish i could be a bug in your ear to tell you there's a pair of nike shoes called the "coffin dunks" They're a different model but so close to the Jordan 1 keychains you've been used for, you could've defs made an inspired pair. but then again, this colourblocking likely works a bit better, haha
The way you painted on the jacket reminds me of the artstyle that Oblivion Tears (a webtoon) has
holy crap i love him so much LOL what a handsome doll >< and the drawings at the end are so cool man
EMBERS BOYFRIEND!!!
Please make a kid for Heathcliff And ember
I LOVE this doll so much omg, its amazing. Always a treat to see you make another male doll ^^
He looks like Joker from Persona 5!
dollightful halloween doll lore >>>>>
He's giving me flashbacks to Adam Ant! Stand and deliver your money or your life!! Great job as always!!!!!
Matt Berry: "BAATTT" 🦇
I think you should still go back and give him some rings! :D
He reminds me of "roudolph sackvilbag" from the movie "the little vampire" and i think thats awesome. The expression turned out really great and reminds me a lot of that character, so cool
I don't want cute,  I want scary
I love him he’s so cute!!! Through the whole video I was just saying “I love hiiim 🥺🥺”
Whenever you gave a piece tgat requires some paint but will be in a hard to reach spot, always paint it before hand as if you airbrush later you can use painters/masking tape to block it off
OMG the animation at the end with all the paintings and comics so cuuuute I wanna be part of their gang 😭❤
I'm getting some real Lost Boys vibes here (the vampire movie, not Peter Pan), mixed with a bit of What We Do In the Shadows. I loved the bit in the end where Ember and Banshee were doing a photoshoot together, that was very cute!
ya know, i feel like he'd fit in pretty well in the animated version of The Little Vampire.
Please give him some sick rings! Love him so much!
Omg I don’t think I ever comment but Katherine!!! This video is so excellent and Heathcliffe looks so fantastic!!! I love the art at the end when he’s walking through the hall, all of the pieces are so fantastic. I’m in awe of the effort and detail you always put in your videos, especially this one.  Whenever I see you’ve posted I get so excited, keep it up!!
Katherine really got me simping for a vampire doll. huh.   (Also those left over vapire clothes could be for a red dragon character, Heathcliffs brother perhaps?)
We need a Cathy for Heathcliff now! 😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤
Can I just say this doll kinda looks like me 😅 I have the same style I’m just missing the same outfit and red eyes haha!
It kinda reminds me of the cartoon version of Rudolph from The Little Vampire 😁🤩 it's amazing tho
oh my god im catching feelings for a doll
The ASMR the airbrush bit gave me was UNREALLLLLLLL 😩😩
I'm so sorry, but, he looks like an Emo Jack Frost! But the thing is, i love it so much! that smirk!!
I am speachless🙌🙌🙌🙌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🫶
I look forward to the Halloween episode every year!!
"Is that Brandon Lee from the movie "The Crow"? " I said jokingly when you were doing his hair. Then made my self sad.
his collars looks very rushed but still i love this ome
This is very convenient because I’m going as a vampire for Halloween.🎃👻💀
Your halloween dolls are always so ambitious but I always love how they turn out!
One of my favorite costumes yet!❤
He looks like a heart breaker for both men and women.
MAKE A DILF ALREADY 🗣🗣
*Altered Beast voice* RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE! Good balance of modern Goth and K-pop boy band vibe, Miss Katherine, he looks great as usual!
I think this is the most respectfully I've ever had to look at a dollightful doll 😅 Wonderful work!
Had to pause the video to really take in that first sketch 😮‍💨🤭
14:23 You're sooo right! He's like the new mona lisa!
Why didn’t you pair his legs 😂
I'm in love with this channel! When I'm sad I watch it when I'm happy I watch it, when I'm anxious like this is the cure for everything!! And I've been waiting so long for this!! Plus today's the best time it got uploaded as I was feeling particularly down aaahhhhh Love you!!! ♥️
okay so love the doll, love all the work she put into him, but am i the only one who dosent love the smile? the teeth are impressive, but something about that smirk is too unnatural it hits right in the uncanny valley and not in a good way. i think its bc the edges are too rounded, he kinda looks like his mouth is being pulled open by those things dentists use? i wish the edges came to a shaper point so to speak, the sketch at the start looked *amazing*
Why im i thinking of marrying a doll-
oohh I think this is my new favourite!! That grin is just so cooolll
What a Hearth-throb XD Amazing job on his look!!
Not me thinking this was marshall lee, Katherine really did a great on every dolla that she made 😍
Love it! 😁😁 💋👌
1:25 I love that jacket! I hope you save that idea for a future project!
❤❤❤
CAN WE ALL JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE HOW GOOD AT ART KATHERINE IS?!?
10:08 he looked like akira from devilman crybaby when she pushed his hair back lol
He reminds me of Liam from Monster Prom.  They have the same smirk and eye shape... And are both vampires.😅
OMG I WAS JUST THINKING AB HOW I NEEDED TO SEE U MAKE A BOY VAMPIRE DOLL
you can always say the line on his face from the airbrush error is a scar
You should totally make a mummy next year
The gallery at the end!!!!! So cute and incredible I love it
I love the paintings at the end!! So fun and clever ❤
you made this man a whole gosh dang MOUTH
Awwwwh the end comic
I know it was probably much simpler to do Almond nails, but it was also a horribly missed oppurtunity to give him Coffin Cut nails
I love him
I LOVE HIMMMMMM ❤️✨️❤️✨️❤️
Can you make Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club Pls 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
She needs to make an anime or scene core doll 😭 she’d totally pull it off!!!!
Im a vampier this hallowen its perfict
I absolutely love this doll but OH MY GOODNESS! He looks like a persona character
Heathcliff’s name reminded me of a cliff bar and now I can’t stop thinking about it 😂
I love male dolls, and this is definitely my favorite custom you've done yet! My gosh he's amazing! X3
Well done, Katherine!
omg I love him so muuuchh, your boy dolls always end up being my faves
hes so cute <3 i love the inset teeth mod, what a cool idea, it gives him such attitude ^_^
tbh if Katherine hadn't said anything about the line on his cheek, i would have just assumed he had a long scar and she just forgot to film/mention it
I miss the wendigo, I know the controversy and such so I understand why. But man was it still a sick doll
*deep breath* MAKE HIM A BEEFY GENTLE GIANT CYCLOPS THEYFRIEND!!!! THAT BOY IS *NOT* STRAIGHT!!
I miss Wendi, I know there was some controversy about her but she was so cool. Surely there could be some way she’d come back
😳😳😳 what you tryna do to me huh👀👀
the way i gasped at the sketch. wasnt expecting him to be that attractive
I’ve been WAITING for mother to release her yearly spooky doll repaint i cannot wait :3
The instant I saw the final concept art, my brain screamed 'HAIR BACK, COLLAR UP, JET BLACK, SO COOL! SING IT LIKE THE KIDS THAT ARE MEAN TO YOU!'
Someone might have already commented this. But I thought of a great idea. What if the mark down the side of his face be a scar. Got when he turned into a vampire. It will never heal. He loves to show it off.
his mouth makes me uncomfortable… 😭😭
My toxic trait is I fell in love w him the second you put his teeth in. Crooked grins like they always get me at first sight lmao
I love him so much!!! he looks so cool!
7:34 that line down his face is obviously an rad wicked scar!
We NEED a animated series of everything!!!
You should make him a pair of head phones
I’ve known this tiny little doll man for less than 20 minutes and I love him
He reminds me of Marshall Lee from Adventure Time with Fionna and cake
G3 Valentine ❤🖤
It would be really awesome if you sold a print of that last little comic 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Ember🤝Heathcliff🤝Bansee  THIS TRIO ON TOP FR
STOP THE JC LEYENDECKER REFERENCE WAS SO GOOD
the "brute force'' aproach is how i make my dragon dolls.
Next year you should make a mad scientist.
I love it as always ❤❤
Heathcliff would 200% flex on the other vampires at a vampire gathering. I'm sorry he looks like he would.
I soooo thought he was just going to be naked ngl.... Just nothing but boxers lol
He looks like the type that would be low key of a dick at first but the instant things go down, he's the surprise ride or die lol
As soon as you went hot anime boy I went YESSSS like i was watching a football game AHSGSHSHGSH
I was trying to figure out why such a well sculpted smirk looked off to me... I think it might be the absence of a visible naso-labial fold on the upturned side. No idea how one would sculpt that, but it's something to think about.
aaaaaaah he's so cute!!
Ahh the hallway!! All the different art styles!! SO COOL!!!!!
I aspire to be him.
HE'S EMBER AND BANSHEES BOYFRIEND AND DADDY GOATMAN HATES HIM!
YAAAAAAAAAS I legit didn't notice she never made a vampire doll and this one looks so cute and cool!
Id love to see her make a rock star collection❤ with a bunch of bling and shirts with unnecessary holes
sees Ember and Heathcliff getting a little too close  Goatdad : *so you have chosen death*
All I can see... Is a black haired Bakugo Katsuki 😅 But he looks great! The mouth especially looks amazing!
YEEEEES I've been waiting for a hot vampire doll for YEARS
I love him. You never fail to amaze me!
i hope you go back to making long videos and detailing every single part of the process, as an old fan its always a treat to get a 30min long video
he should be my wife
No, because tell me I'm not the only one over here simping for this doll-
beautiful!!
I love how much effort Dollightful puts into make her dolls. I especially love the photo shoots and mini movies after making the dolls, it just give them extra character and you love the characters that much more.
This doll is sooo awesome! I think you've just started a fangirl club 😂🎉❤
I know the boy dolls are never as popular, but I must say I adore the way you have crafted him. I love all your doll styles, from cute, to masculine, to feminine, to monstrous. And I just need to comment to hopefully push the alogrythm
Not gonna lie, with how his smirked cheek isn't puffed up, he looks kind of like a stroke victim;;;;;;;;;; But it's still an amazing build and I adooooooore his outfit!!!
That ending scene made me want to know so much more about Heathcliff as a character!! It was so cool! Also amazing doll as always <3
u shpuldve made the line on his face a scar
Hes giving me very much Gregory from the Little vampire. i love it
The way I was crying out "Don't set the teeth, you didn't paint them yet!!! You're making things harder than needed!!!" But alas, Heathcliff looks phenomenal as all your projects do.
I love the way he turned out, but not gonna lie I love the monstrous dolls and kinda disappointed he went the cute boy look 😭 but I’m just obsessed with inhumane characters that really push the boundaries of the human body so that might have something to do with it
WOW. without a doubt, Katherine NEVER fails to impress me!!!! all these designs are so creative and well thought out! amazing!!! can't wait to see what she'll bring out for us next...
😳 oh jeez. Be still my beating heart  Also, 80s dolls!! They would be so fun!
I actually screamed when I saw that there was a new video I was so excited and it did not disappoint❤ Honestly he kind of reminds me of hanako
gen3 deuce deserved this
Hey dollightful! Whenever you post a video it always brings a smile to my face! Keep up the good work!
Very Vampire Knights aesthetic!  Love it.
hes giving jaehyun from nct
I’m ngl I kinda want to steal his fit
Starting to ship Ember and Heathcliff ❤
This is so Cute!  Tbh, his face reminds me of Rin Okumura lol!
I actually wrote my final paper on vampires and the differences in lore (among other related vampire things, such as the tendency of vampire writers to take potshots at OTHER vampire writers because of the aforementioned lore differences), so this video is perfectly suited for me akdkfkksf
Such a cute group picture at the end! I would love to see more of those drawn ones. Such a cool character! Happy Halloween!
i feel like ember and heathcliff are bf/gf even tho her mom doesn’t approve cuz he’s not technically a demon
I think the fangs could've had a more sharp shape but otherwise this vampire looks amazing!! I loove the expression and the clothes
something tells me he would either sound like kevin from steven universe or marshall lee from adventure time..
You make embers a boyfriend since you made most of her family
HES AMAZING!!!💋💋💋
My boyfriend was watching this with me and his exact words was “wtf”
You should make a zombies with chunks of flesh missing and blood dripping
The thumbnail, the doll, THE AESTHETIC. I squealed!!! ٩( ๑•ω•๑)۶
obsessed with all the different style paintings, the Leyendecker one has to be my favorite
Hii I'm so happy your back
Imo, the black shoes looked better to me. Or if you have painted the new ones black, I think that would've looked good too, the amount of red on the shoes feels too distracting for me. But I really liked the design overall! Always love watching another Dollightful video! 💕
Perhaps the face damage is a scar from some Halloween shenanigans gone wrong.
Yaaay happy halloween!!
We need a series with Heathcliff.
Okay but that photo at the end is SUPER cute and I want a copy of the Halloween dolls hanging out XD Heathcliff's lil devil horns <3  This was a great Halloween doll! Looking at the thumbnail, I wasn't sure how you were gonna managed to make the mouth that shape. But you delivered, as usual :3 Thanks for your hard work! Happy Halloween!
I look forward to the halloween skit at the end of these videos every year and this years was so cuuuuttteeee. All the paintings and photos of him and then the photobooth one!!!! Such a great concept and fantastic execution. You continue to amaze. Happy Halloween!
Im so happy you made this!! I just started a vampire fixation :)
he gives me dabi from mha but if he were a vampire, didn't have his burns and never went outside  Edit: i love the lore we've got going on with all of these dolls
Heathcliff turned out awesome, I like how his sneakers give him a bit of a juvenile personality.
Make him a Frankenstein boyfriend PLEASE
I want that outfit irl!
Your Halloween dolls are my FAVORITES!!! I’ve been rewatching them for that last week before going to sleep so happy to get a new one today 😍♥️
He reminds me of the vampire form blood lad
It’s been 1 month and now she posted!!!!
Woahhh it turned out so cool
Omg, a gay vampire! 🧛‍♂️🏳️‍🌈               (Just a suggestion-)
maybe the big poofy hair was his actual hairstyle in the 80s… since he’s a vampire lolol
I love it!!!
Dude, your artwork in all the styles at the end was so cool
vamp boy highkey drippppyyyy
I honestly want his outfit
The teeth look great. It might've been better to add a little bit of definition to his cheek as the grin lifts it, bc otherwise he kinda looks like he has a swollen mouth 😅
He is so handsome !!
Boy doll! Boy doll! Boy doll!
You better get him a bride before he gets swarmed by fangirls😍
Just throwing this out there but I would really like to see what you come up whit for a Kelpie :D
The shape of the mouth makes it Look like it had a stroke.
im freaking out hes so hot
Idk why but he reminds me of Staz from Blood Lad and I love him
I really liked the animation at the end,  it's always nice to have friends as a monster.
i love the doll!b also love how kay wren looked like she was about to charge us and hex us at the end with everyone standing lol
Zesty
He’s the kind of guy that would be like “Oh? You thought I was gonna bite you??? Na I was just joking around I promise!!! Or maybe I wasn’t we will have to see tonight, won’t we?”
OBSESSED with this vampire guy who seems like he wants to be goth and spooky but also has sick ass nike kicks like he has these nice shoes and he'll be damned if he doesn't wear them
he reminders me of Rudolph from My Little Vampire
Very cool 😀
He looks like a dating sim character and I adore him!!! I still wanna see him in his modern spike pants outfit tho 😂
The concept is awesome, however I don't like how the mouth turned out when the doll is finished, I don't know it looks weird to me, the concept art mouth looked amazing however... yeah it looks like it is out of place somehow. Don't get me wrong the doll is amazing, it was high time Dollightfull did a vampire. Also it would have been awesome if she had added as an accessory the wine glass full of blood
He looks like one of those characters I'd both love and want to punch at the same time, like you love him bc he's funny and reads people brutally but also has a big ego or something
Heathcliff is incredible! I'd totally invite him for a cup of tea (or whatever he wants, maybe some bloodred orange juice! :P). His outfit is amazing and I think he rocks the mashup of handsome Victorian Vampire and spooky glam rock. Another totally wicked and awesome doll from you!!

He is my new favorite male doll of yours!! Like him and the sillvally are just my faves of all time
I was literally driving home after my Halloween plans last night thinking, "I hope dollightful made a Halloween video this year," I was so happy to see this uploaded ^^
Anime = pathetic, vampires and not meant to look like this 🗑 .
One day you should do an angel inspired doll
Are you kidding? That crack on the side of his face tells a story from his past. One we don't know, but we can see it's there. I'd have loved for you to accent it. Love his shoes. Awesome design & execution. The teeth are fangtastic. 😉 Also, love the kitty as always. 😊
Is it just me, or would Heathcliff make a cute couple with Ember? Goatman might get all protective again, but I’m sure Momma Zura will keep him from going all demon on the hot vampire boy!
Missed opportunity to give him his whine glass of blood
heathcliff is a victim of no top lip
Honestly I think my teeth are sharper than his for him being a vampire but he still looks cool
i’ve been in my vampire era so this is SO perfect
Oh My God YES!! I thought you weren't going to do a Halloween doll this year🥺🔥🖤
Awwh he's so adorable 😭reminds me of a Royale High butler!
rip of us seeing the "zombie deer" she made
We. Need. More. Boy Dolls.
Dollightful  should make comic about all her dolls. I would definitely read it.
I LOVE THE ART AT THE END AAAAAAA  Also that extra jacket is SO COOL you HAVE to use it for someone else, or even just to give Heathcliff another outfit!   (Also those pants made me think of a dinosaur, dinosaur character perhaps? 😮)
Ok but HOLY CRAP WHY AM I IN LOVE WITH HIM YOU DID IT AGAIN KATHERINE, LOVE YOUUUU
He's so cute 😊
The art at the end went crazy😂❤ keep up the good work
He could be a vampire that's unaffected by the sun
We need more dude dolls I swear. ❤❤❤
His design is so cool! I never would’ve thought to combine a traditional vampire costume with a leather jacket
GUYS WHY IS THE VAMPIRE MAN LOWKEY FINE I THINK IM IN LOVE
I love Heathcliff's outfit, it reminds me a lot of Panic at the Disco.
I’m still mad y’all made her get rid of Wendi. She was my favorite
HES HOT OMG
9:14  Count Derpsmirk
Heathcliff and werewolf girl enemies to lovers
That toothy green is amazing! I look forward to your dolls every year! Stunning! And all the art at the end! So great! Amazing!
He's awesome! I want that doll! I must add, I love all the artwork in his gallery. That was a really nice touch.
He looks like the mc from an anime blood lad i think thats the name. N the irony is that, this is the type of fashion style he usualy would wear too😂
MOTHER IS BACK!!!! WE MISSED YOU!!!!
I love him, he reminds me of Kieran valentine from monster high lol
That last picture makes Heathcliff look like Karkat
if heathcliff was a real person id probably be the gayest of men
wheres his upper lips?
he gives me idol vibes...even so far as, dare I say it, Enhypen vibes?
I think it would be nice to give this handsome vampire a beautiful and elegant sister
From the front I think the mouth looks a bit too goofy and kinda makes him seem like a middle schooler who thinks he’s a vampire. Other then that I think he’s a cute design
Probably one of my fav dolls you made Katherine! Your concept art is always so pretty and has so much personality I want to see them all combines😭
There is no way Heathcliff and Ember arnt dateing ain't no way
What a nice early birthday gift 🤭 lmao  I love him so much! He's so edgy and charming. The open toothed smirk is just 🤌
Imagine having a mom like Katherine???? Like you have school friends over and them saying "wow those toys are so cool! Where did you get them?" And you being like "my mom made them! 😊"
How can I put this respectfully ….   I would pay good money to have dollightfull sketch or draw me some « seasoned » art
THIS IS SO GOOD!! My favorite monster is the vampire and you did him SO WELL! I’m really happy with this! Thank you 😭
This is my new favorite doooollll omg. I need that jacket. Imma make one
Love this video!❤❤❤
me and my recently developped astarion obsession were so happy you did a vampire with pointy ears for this year's doll. as always, the doll is absolutelly perfect, and the line on his face (before it became unnoticeable) looks elegant and i kinda like it
How I love him
He's so Mikey Way circa 2004, ah! I love it! He has to be my favorite of the Halloween lineup so far!
i have so much to learn about doll customizing because i made my own astarion a while back and did NOT think to do any of those mouth modifications. absolutely love heathcliff! and his very modern sneakers
I LOVE HIM!! but i cant shake the feeling that he'd be the type to go "where my hug at?" 😭😭
This fella is so handsome!!! I love this doll SOOOO much!!!!
At first I was sure Heathcliff was going to be Ember’s rebellious boyfriend, but then I saw the photo booth pictures at the end and TwT Nope, he’s a dork and they’re all adorable
He turned out wicked cool! Now he just needs his lovely bride to be ☺️💗. The selfies at the end is so cute the banshee is so adorable in the photos💗. Can you do a custom using a Disney doll such as Elsa from frozen?
My most fav time is always halloweeen😭😭😭💖💖 WISKSJDOSKDHDIDK
OOooh! The airbrush line on his face could be a scar! Nice idea, I'd say
Not me simping for a doll  goddammit
Watching you paint the inside of the mouth was *stressful* to watch, but they turned out well. I was just holding my breath the whole time.
He looks absolutely marvelous, and I absolutely love him!! You did a fantastic job with Heathcliff.
Love how he turned out!! He’s so cool!! ❤️🩸
Why do I ship him with Ember? Kind of like a secret „Romeo and Juliet-Balcony-Romance“ since Ember is practically the princess of hell? And her Dad is not amused while her Mom is actually shipping it too😂
omg i love him!! and the part at the end with him walking down the hall and showing all the art was amazing!!
karkat…?
13:21 Barb is insane but we love her. And we love you too!!
Is it just me or does anyone else REALLY want to make his jacket human sized???
Corpse husband vibes
IKEMEN DOLL
As soon as I saw the mark on his face, I created a little story about him getting caught by vampire hunters at some point of his endless life (I like to think it was when he was really young) and ended up with him been alive but severely injured, so that mark it's a scar for that unforgettable day and battle for his life. He's pretty much proud of it, so for him it's kinda of a shame that vampire healing abilities make it look so subtle.
ngl he kinda looks how I do when I have my mouth propped open at the dentist. I don't think the "smirk" came through well at all :(
I love the idea that Ember and Heathcliff have something like a sibling relationship. They play pranks on each other and can be mean, but they will go to the end of the word for each other
i love the whole “who says i can’t wear my converse with my dress” thing going on with him
the teeth came out so well!!! i must say G3 really suits your style xD it looks right at home on any g3 doll~
Heathcliff looks like someone I'd steal lunch money from (I say this with great affection)
oh i’m obsessed with him
with his face and the background music, can't help but be reminded of astarion from bg3 haha
Love your videos tho and this is a me this never like vampires the blood sucking creature was always uncomfortable,unsettling and grotesque for me was just never a fan of them but still great videos nonetheless
Its giving rei sakuma vives I love it
Fantastic repaint! Just love your talent and joy for what you do. 😀
You sure made a cute vampire guy. Yet another work of art. Just needs a glass of wine
Love him so much!
Katherine keeps making such pretty dolls to the point where I'm in love and start drawing them myself, I am not ok
Absolutely love this look! It’s giving Enhypen Bite Me vibes 😍🔥
I’m not trying to be rude but as you were making him he looked like a zombie that got punched in the jaw but I love the doll and I have watched almost all of your I love your work
Wow, what a cold-blooded hottie! This doll is proof you dont need to go big on the concept and design to create a charater with loads of personality, it's all in the details!
❤❤❤ I am loving this doll! Best one yet!
His smile makes him look like he farted and is trying to hide it, but failed. I love it SO MUCHH ❤❤
loving the vibe and the amazing dolls that you make.
The bell-bottom pants with the spiky spine on 10:55 is soooo cute! I hope you use them for a future project sometime ✨
you HAVE to keep those clothes  that weren’t used for another doll they’re so good
THE PICTURE AT THE END OMG I LOVE HIM SOOSOSOS MUCH HES SO COOL AND THAT TRIO LOOKS LIKE THE BEST OF FRIENDS DEFINITELY THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF A MONSTER HIGH TYPE OF MOVIE ❤😍
I LOVE HIM!!! reminds me of wriothesley from genshin impact!!!! hes so fufufufuu~
Finally a male doll!!!!! I'm so happy! I've been waiting for a guy to join the ranks for ages!
He's fabulous! He's got that classic goth street fashion vibe going too! His face mods are brilliant ❤
It's the shoes that don't quite match that make him super cheeky! ❤
I absolutory love how he came out!! such an awesome doll and you did incredible work as always, BUT if it starts to bother you, you could always try and turn that line into a scar! just an idea :3 but I love him so much, honestly he's gender envy for me haha
Him being paper white makes sense. Vampires don't have blood, that's why they drink from other's. Adding pinks and reds would mean they have blood flow which defeats the purpose of a vampire. Just an FYI for anyone who was curious
You need to give him a human friend for the other clothes ☺️
It's amazing
The fangs!!! He looks really good!
For the next one u could do Zombie or A daughter of the vampires and demon ?
For some reason his face reminds me of Jack Frost lol, but it still looks awesome! Maybe my favorite Halloween doll you’ve made!
I think Heathcliff took some inspiration from Katherine's husband in his looks lol
I love it so much
heathcliff and ember are totally dating
I can't tell if its your subtle Texan accent shining through or if you're saying "parameter" when you mean "perimeter." (Love the videos and the work regardless)
He has such strong little shit energy I love it
He really looks like an original Monster High doll! I love him
I actually love the line you pointed out. It looks like an old scar! Like maybe in his "younger" days, he had a tussle with a vampire hunter and managed to save himself, and now him and the hunter are like bffs and have coffee outings every Thursday ^-^
This may be a strange concept for a doll but I wanna list it here since I’m not a sculptor but loved the idea in my head. You see monsters like Frankenstein’s monster who came from books and Dracula is a go to when talking vampires but what if someone did something based of Kafka’s metamorphosis. A bug monster with lots of ways to interpret it
awwww love him. he looks super cute *:*
This was adorable!  My kids thought Heathcliff was handsome
I love him!!!! It might be that im too obsessed with Baldur's gate 3 rn but he looks as he could be the son of Astarion and the Player!! ❤❤❤❤
Love the concept art! He turned out so sassy!
You should definitely use that first outfit on another doll. Maybe give Heathcliff a younger sibling?
Where did she give the doll shoe from
I love him so much!! Btw did you switched the banshee's hands?
Why oh, why do i see Heathcliff as the frat brother of the Goatman that became adopted cool uncle for Ember?
The first set of clothes would work great for a dragon
sigh… *adds him to the list of fictional boys i have a crush on*
he's so HOT omg
i love heathcliff! he's a total cutie- and he feels like a charming goofball to me! He leans into the vampire aesthetic but has fun with it. The nike Air Force 1s are taking me out 😂
So cool! The ending was so cute too! ♥ Amazing work as always!
you outdid yourself with this photoshoot!!!
Omg I never thought of filtering paint before airbrushing! That's genius! I haven't used my air brush in years but still helpful to know lol
He looks like a big dork at heart. Love those shoes with the rest of his outfit.
He needs a lover ❤ now to follow the classic vampire love story 😢
I love him! You killed it (pun intended)
HELPPPPP IM DOING MY FINALS and my literature final is on Wuthering heights… I’m so sick of this book!!! But heathcliff looks so gorgeous.
im so happy you finally made a vampire!! he is just so adorable
“Where my hug at?” 13:02 😭😭😭
I’m obsessed with how you make the outfits so complex and layered on so small a scale! It’s something I always struggle with when making custom doll clothes. As someone who is professionally trained in garment construction and alterations (for human sizes lol) “lining clothes is hard and I’m not good at it” at 11:27 is a whole mood trust me none of us want to line sleeves either lol. Lining the sleeves for my kitsune doll made me want to throw my sewing machine out of the window
am I the only one who thinks that Heathcliff and Ember are dating or is it just me?
if its okay can you post the full concept art of heathcliff and the art on the hallway walls? i would love to have the concept art as my phone background!
I feel like the crack adds a bit of personality to it honestly
I love Heathcliff he's such a nice doll!! The only thing... Is it just me or does the smirk look slightly off putting to anybody else? I feel like his bottom teeth is lost to the shadows giving him an almost goofy open mouthed look rather than a cheesy smirk... I dunno maybe its just me? I LIVE for his outfit though it's definitely a beautiful cross between Gothic Victorian and Modern and his faceup is just perfect
why isn't a vampire called a werebat...
marshal lee from adventure time? lol, i love him tho
I am loving this. I think he's gorgeous. Though I think, (and please don't take this to heart, this is just my opinion.), his mouth is a little wonky and his nails are a little blobby. I love the overall design. I just think that the mouth and nails need a little bit of a touch up. But he's very good.
Is it just me or does the smile kind of end up looking like one of those cartoony claymation smiles? Getting a little uncanny valley from this doll.
I think the line on his face works perfectly with his big ol smirk. It looks like a Glasgow smile.
Count Von Count is not officially a vampire! He's "vampire-like"
He totally fits the vibe of the song "Rivers a Vampire" by the band Bear Ghost!
He gives the vibes of "I'm a freshman in highschool and my dad's the history professor" lol
First of all, I have to point out that when he hangs upside down, the coattails frame his body in such a way that they look like wings. Unintentional? If so, what a perfect coincidence! I love that this year you decided to do a male doll, just to keep things fresh, and he fits right in with the other girls, especially Kay Wren and her spooky-whimsy outfit. Also, those portraits from the end are so cool and an amazing way to show his character! Another knock-out doll!
HANDSOME MANNNN
Anime Boy + Alt faction style = me think is arsthicly cute
It's giving teen-punk-Alucard from Hellsing, especially with the wide, toothy grin.
You planning anything with that snake head and the cuter bat clothes? Future dolls or something for next year maybe?
I just know he's such a lovable loser
i want to kiss and smooch him
i have to admit this is the first doll i've had this big of a crush on;;; thank you katherine
Hottest Dollightful doll fr
Why did you cover his crouch area? You don't do this for the female dolls
I'm just gonna say it... I would NOT mind at ALL if Heathcliff wanted to suck my blood😍😂
Wow! Awesome!
No moth man…..😢
The art at the end with the other dolls was ADORABLE <3
This might be one of my favourite dolls! The characterdesign is so interesting and I really like the shoes in particular since they kinda pop out from the rest of his clothing style and gives him a ton of personality alongside the smirk!
You were about four design choices away from making a Black Parade doll so now in my head Heathcliff discovered emo in the 2000s and hasn't listened to any genre since
My mind went straight to Wuthering Heights with his name! I love that a Katherine made a Heathcliff. He’s absolutely amazing
Your Halloween dolls are always ones to look forward to, and this one is no exception! Thank you for sharing your craftsmanship with us!!
Thanks for your Using My Music // Keep up the fresh & Spacey content ✊🏽✨🙏🛸
aaahh that little skit at the end was amazing -- so cute! would you consider making prints of some of the posters you made for it?
This guy looks like Marshall Lee from Adventure Time's gender swapped AU! He looks so cool! Like a total punk!
oh im a homosexual, got it

im lowkey sad we didnt get to see him keep the wild mullet but the illustrations of him throughout the decades totally made up for it, he slays every style But i love this doll, so cute! Its totally a random headcanon but i love the idea of him and the werewolf beast girl being close :(! not only a twist on the werewolves vs vampires thing, but also a twist on like a pretty girl and a beast man, and instead its a pretty boy and a beast girl! I just love the image of Heathcliff as this cheeky guy whos way sweeter and friendlier than youd expect from a vampire and the way he talks so animated and casually with the wolf girl who everyone else is scared of lmao!!
I love him! The face up turned out amazing *chefs kiss*. He gives me Jhonny Goth vibes!
Im kind of a backwards person so Heathcliff doesn't really give me that "cool kid" vibe that others may get from him. Popular yes just not cool. No, he seems like he would be shy (awkwardly smills at people he doesn't know, has small friend group), tired (vamps. Don't get enough sleep, bed head not styled), and a nerd (amazing at math and has lots of random history facts). Sorry for the long comment just had to put my thoughts out there.
Honestly, with the mistakes like the line down his cheek, use it to your advantage and turn it into a scar.
i love him. ID LET HIM HAVE MY BLOOD ANYDAY
omg u know who he reminds me of the older brother from the little vampire 😂
Hear me out...🤭
WOOOOO DOLLIGHTFUL HALLOWEEN EPISODE!!!!!
The line on his face honestly looks like a vein and it suits him
i'm sure there's a bunch of goth men who would die for that jacket you designed
he is just my kind of character ugh 😭❤️ love the gallery walk at the end!! you always deliver when it comes to halloween!!!
I would pay money to see the misadventures of Heathcliff, Ember and the Banshee
his fangy little mouth and fuzzy head im in love 🥹
Aaah! He’s adorable! I think he would’ve looked precious with bat like sleeves that connect to the torso, although I love the way he looks now!
FINALLY ANOTHER PRETTY BOY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR FOREVERRRR
0:55 is the best second from any youtube video ever
Random idea, what if you gave him a shy ghost girl he teased?
Hiii
Looking at all the dolls you did over the years always makes me smile. I’ve been watching you ever since elementary, now I finished college.
I'm just amused by the doll sized dentures and the fact no one has done that lmao
omg yes!!! Been waiting for this years Halloween doll!! I love him😭💚💚💚
From the thumb nail I honestly thought you were using a doll that already had the open mouth expression! Great job and Happy Halloween🎃🍁🍂
Thank you so much for doing a custom with the new Deuce, I was really hoping the gen 3 male dolls would be good. I've been wanting to try my hand at making a custom Gregor Eisenhorn doll for a long time and I'm happy to see that this one might be a good fit.
I LOVE the idea of him trying to scare people but he ends up being adorable instead. Like imagine if some cute vampire boy was gassing up his deadly creature of night under his control aho has the power to suck the fear out of anyone that lays eyes on it and it ends up being an adorable dog sized fluffy bat with some adorable spooky name like hes a disney protagonists 😭❤  Or if he accidentally bumps into a kid and makes them cry and nervously tries to calm the kid down in a panic yhgfhrhr I love him so much! I love the contrast of your terrifying monstrous dolls and hes there with his cute smile and comically large shoes
Gostei muito, muito legal
can you please add the 3D files from Khepri feet to Thingverse
Okay, idea: what if there was a series about Ember and how she goes on her daily life with her wacky family and friends? I can sooo see her, heatcliff, the banshee and Kay wren being monster friends getting into all sorts of shenanigans
the jordans are SENDING ME dollightfuk ily he had to have his nikes on
This doll is my aesthetic oh my god I'm in love!!! You do amazing work of darker creepier dolls you should definitely do them more!
omg i love hiimmmmm
it’s my favorite time of the year: dollightful skits season!
Omg I love him 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 the goblin king who?? I wish you kept it lol
I love the idea that he changes appearances every now and then. He's probably this several centuries old dude who constantly keep up with the latest fashion trend. And the coat is the just the coolest thing, I want one in my size. Fantastic project!
Katherine: *talking about her concept art* “Well he needs clothes…”  Me: *eyebrow shoots up* “I mean… does he though??” Hehehe 🤭  But no I loved the clothing design you settled on! I’m just a sucker for an anime boy vampire with a nice chest 😆
I. ADORE. that outfit. SO MUCH. 👌
All I gotta say…        GAWD D A M N
this vid is a literal perfect birthday present for me (it’s my 21st)
ive never been attracted to a doll before...
What a handsome fella!
I thought you were going to make a  zombie doll when you started this series nope.
amazing 🤩🤩
I wonder have you ever thought of making a scary clown❤🤡
I totally ship Heathcliff and Ember, absolutely adorable 😭💖
she should totally date ember they would be so cute together!
I find it always so nice and refreshing when a doll gets an open mouth like this one. Makes them look so much more life like
I usually always agree with ALL of your design choices but I really wish you kept the 80s wolf cut on him! It was so cool and trendy. The end product is still amazing though :)
I’ve always wanted to see U make a Vampire doll, and that was the first time I saw Banshee Smile :”0
amazing I love boy dolls sm!! Your channel gives me life
the fact that he's a pretty boy vampire with a bat symbol makes him seem like you combined Robert Pattinson as Edward with Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne
The doll looks sooo cool. I am screaming! He is like a Vulturi but in 2023 bc of the nikes😂
Dang, what a cutie😍! Kinda reminds me of Staz from the manga ‘blood lad’… Amazing work as always and thank you for another amazing Halloween doll!❤
Embers boyfriend? Sounds like a cute idea and extends the family
Every single time when I see your drawings, it always inspires me to draw an original character because your art is always so beautiful! ❤❤❤
He looks like somebody who says "Well, well, well," when walking into rooms and that is 10/10 chefs kiss for me
He's perfect and reminds me of the vampire in blood lad😂❤
he's kinda...
I'm qlways amazed at how you make everything a masterpiece
I love the coattails, i can imagine them flowing in the wind very anime-like.
Mrs Katherine with the line on his face you could have made it a scar it would have made him look more cool!! Love you videos btw❤
He reminds me Bakugou from my My Hero Academia, has the same vibes ❤
Ah, yes. The most terrifying thing of all: the airbrush😱
Heathcliff is fabulous.
Love the new doll!
ember and  heathcliff  i ship
I love this so much, I can totally see this doll being the main character of an anime. You are so incredibly talented ❤ your videos are always so relaxing after a long day i look forward to them.
The bat flying away made laugh out loud 😂
Mark Heathcliff alternate
That faux Picasso has me ROLLING. If you put that on your shop, I would buy it!
Gods your videos are like a warm hot chocolate for the soul. I look forwards to then every time you release new content. Thank you for continuing to share your amazing talent with us all!!!
Quick question, just started watchin the vid, But Does anyone know where you could get some of those gloves she wears? 3:21 i've tried buying disposable gloves, but i unfortunately have incredibly and weirdly small hands and no matter what gloves i buy they always seem to be too big and loose. it makes it really difficult to sculpt with the apoxie when the gloves are sliding everywhere lol. If anyone has any ideas it would be much appreciated! but if not, thanks for reading anyway!
I really, really liked him! Wow!!!
Looking at that sketch at the beginning… did you basically (accidentally) draw Marshall Lee (vampire version) from Adventure Time/Fionna and Cake?
Heathcliff reminds me of the Enhypen vampires,  Very cool.
Maybe a zombie for next year since you've never made one before
The accidental line gives him more character. Like he has a scar! I love your creativity when it comes to making dolls. They are all so unique. Keep up the amazing work <3
I love the addition of the art gallery walls
I want to marry him so bad... Like I dont know how you managed to make exactly my type of boy as a doll, u are so talented! (no but for real, either my future husband looks like him or I wont accept him)
Ughh he’s so hot and cool!! Younger me would’ve gone crazy over this guy, I just know it. His face up is amazing, but still very cartoony and in your style, which I love. I prefer the face ups to be cartoony, rather than realistic. The jacket is so awesome. I just really hate the shoes 😖 I wish he had some sexy kicks to go with his outfit. But I’m otherwise in love with him lol!!
7:48 that texan twang slipped out hehe "dudn't bother ye" much love fellow doll obsessed Texan ๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑
Heathcliff looks so awesome and the sculpted teeth are so cool and I looove the illustrations at the end!!! All the different styles! And the last one with the banshee and Ember are so cute!
i live in a tent in a national park in africa atm, and i was interrupted by a lion walking through camp (he was making himself heard) while watching this video. still had to go back and finish the video an hour later😆 anyways i love the 3D mouth and the smirk! that combined with the inherent emo-vibe of vampires really makes me feel like he’d be a rawr xd kind of guy (but that might just be the lions talking)
Love all the portraits in his gallery!! ❤❤
I love the Halloween ones because there are always a little story at the end and she even draws/makes the background and props 😭😭 you're my idol girl 👏👏👏
I want to buy those photos of them together so bad its so cute
He looks like the type of guy to show up to human Halloween parties uninvited, win best costume for just existing, and then leave everyone extremely confused the next day. Like omg who was that guy???
SO COOL!!! I love the anime villain vibe he gives! and the art of him at the end is so cute!
I totally understand why she took down the Wendigo and removed her from the line up but damn do I miss her, she was such a cool doll and always my favorite of the spooky series
I know the reason why the wendigo dool was removed but I still find it sad cause it was such a piece of hard work and craftsmanship
so cool!!! :D
Dam it… now I can’t help but ship him with ember
I love the line thing it's almost like a scar!
He's hot. Can i marry him? :))
The aesthetic and paint job style reminds me of Hellsing which is perfect!
Okay but he looks like the worst love interest (affectionate) in a supernatural anime. Absolutely amazing and those are killer
Was SO waiting for a vampire doll! Heathcliff has so much sass, I love him! Would love to see some Dollightful merch of him like you have for Ember!
holy sh*t he's hot as f*ck.😍❤ I love his face and outfit. I love the photo collage at the end.
He is extremely fruity /pos
Love him, gives me goth bakugo vibes
He kinda looks like a cooler Valentine 😅 Which is a compliment. Don't get me wrong, cause that old Valentine I end up getting him and draculauras dad mixed up. Love the spooky vampire lad :]
New husbando unlocked 😭🫶🏻
Oh wow he looks so great!! Especially in the low light photoshoot, the open moth and 3d teeth really sell everything!!! Great job 🤸🏾
OMG IS HE EMBERS BF?? THAT WOULD BE SO COOL!
he looks so good! i will admit i laughed when the name heathcliff popped up though, it just makes me think of the comics of cat heathcliff 😂 edit: oh my god the ending just made me realize he looks like karkat homestuck ahsbsbdb double whamy
I love Heathcliff's design! Though I hope I'm not the only one that thought he looked a bit like a certain homestuck character in the picture at 17:01
I would 100% simp for him
Idk how to made a doll look so attractive but u did and I’m in love 😂❤ so animeeee he’s giving vampire knight vibes ❤
Your boy is missing some bling💍⛓️
As someone who owns a tea house and uses the exact same tea balls, it was hilarious seeing you use one to filter your paint for the airbrush
10:05 He must be friends with the vampire Lestat
Much as I love him I think he might have benefited from some time in the head shrinking juice. The big head is cartoonish and cute. He looks like the asshole you love to hate in a show like shera, a smaller head I think would have made him look more Serious and spooky. But also might have made the open mouth impossible
danmm, bro got the jordans 🔥🔥
He turned out amazing! Reminds me of the guy from Blood Lad. Exactly the kind of anime boys 12yo me would've died for
He is so handsome and adorable! His expression is perfect too. Another amazing Halloween doll added to the collection.🎃
Amber got a possibble boyfiend? :D  Gen3 dolls made me think on modifying them into BJDs. Very nice sculps + a bit beefier than our favorite scrawny Gen1 boys.
He kinda looks like Junji Ito's Souichi
he looks like a Danganronpa character I love it
I love the process, but why not paint the inside bits of the mouth before inserting them?
Smash
I think Ember and Heathcliff would be a cute couple
MISS MAAM YOU GRABBED DEUCE SO VIOLENTLY 😭😭😭😭
I feel that his silly little smirk gives me the impression that he has so many bad puns and jokes waiting for you and something tells me if marshal lee was a doll him Heathcliff and him would be the sarcastic duo we all need and love 😅
probably my favorite doll to date. i love your male dolls and heathcliff is my brothers nickname!
Heathcliff looks like he’d sing bad little boy lol!
I'm not joking when I say that I wait all year for Dollightful's halloween skits. This was amazing! I love Heathcliff so much
Why is the doll rizzing me up with that smirk?? 😳😩 He looks fantastic, great job!
I love him omg! Also the little picture at the end with the banshee and demon girl omgggggg! I ship Heathcliff and the demon girl now😊😂
His feet are green because he has diabetes
If you ever made an art book with your concept art and overall art from your dolls just know I’d be the first to buy ❤
How is he so handsome!!
Everytime she sculpts a mouth and paints it AFTER putting it inside the head... Catherine please, just paint them before putting it inside the head 😭😭
tbh it looks like the little vampire from both the recent netflix animated version and the original live action version and i cant unsee it
i love men
Maybe change the shoes
I personally don’t think the line on his face is that noticeable but if you wanted you could add it to his backstory like a scar from childhood or something
The fact that I’m dressed as a bit of a modern vampire the day Kathrine posts her vampire video is amazing and hilarious. I also couldn’t help but laugh when you hear Heathcliff’s heavy and spooky footsteps but then you just see a pair of Nikes lol
Its always a treat to see you make male dolls. When browsing I see your videos and find myself watching them, your attitude is always uplifting and sweet. I don't make any dolls but sometimes I like to (then I see all the work it takes and just go back to video edits haha... 😂💦)   The title in the video caught my attention as I was very confused on why you was making "Heathcliff" a doll then I realized it wasn't the cartoon cat back in the day (I'm old). 😂  At the end, he reminds me a lot of Belial from GranBlue (which means I have to share this lovely video with a friend of mine that loves that man 😂 ) He turned out amazingly well! Well done!
The rest is kinda hot though
But I hate how the grin looks lopsided. I miss when you added loads of detail
Very stiles lol 😊
Omg I LOVE the artwork at the end!!!!!
I love this doll so much. I have a soft spot for the classic frilly Victorian vampire looks, but this modern spin is so nice. Also, the illustrations at the end were just adorable
ok this one is my favorite now. the teeth, the hair, the sneakers??!?!?!,!, amazing
I love the newest edition to the Spooky Doll Gang. Also wanted to say that your creativity in video production just gets better and better each video. I think this was my favorite after scene. So inspiring!
Small question, whered the wendigo go?
Wow! You just keep outdoing yourself! It's not just the doll either, though sculpting a mouth with a tongue and teeth is amazing, but also the details on the clothing, the little character skits, and the hallway with portraits through the ages all in different art styles...holy crap Catherine, it's so much extra work and I absolutely LOVE it all! ❤❤❤ I look forward to your Halloween videos all year! 😅 It is one of my favorite holidays, but the personalities and character of each of the dolls are over the top fantastic! How you can keep doing these amazing things while also being a mom to a little one blows me away! Oh, and don't worry about comparing yourself to Barb, she did say she's been doing her own nails like that for a long time, so it's just a different skill set.  One thing I will mention in case you find it interesting is that other non-doll makers I watch use translucent Sculpey to make teeth and it looks really good. I dunno if you can get Sculpey over there as I think there's some concern over the safety, or perhaps it's just due to the lack of ovens to bake it (I imagine the fish grill would char the clay and perhaps not fully cure it because the burners are so close), I dunno. I do know that traditional polymer clays can be cured with a heat gun too, so that's also an option. I honestly don't think it's necessary, even with the open mouth on Heathcliff, but I think it never hurts to share information.   Now, a bit of critique: The upper lip could have used some more shaping, and the bottom lip could be raised on that side, and a bit of cheek sculpting or shading and a little squint to the eye on that side, BUT that's just me being overly picky. Don't take this too hard as again, it's just me being picky. I'm not trying to pick apart your work because it's amazing, and I do mean that! I always rush to watch your videos as soon as I see them. Much love from the Carolinas! ❤❤❤
Heathcliff and Ember should be boyfriend and girlfriend ❤ they be so cute tougher
EEKK!! gosh I waited so long for this 😭😭😭 he looks so good! I swear Katherine never fails to empress 😭
I am now FASCINATED and OBSESSED with Katherine having art FOR her dolls- Zura's family photo album, and now Heathcliff's vast gallery of art featuring him in different periods!
I love love LOVE the aesthetic choice! It reminds me of early My Chemical Romance in the BEST way possible!
It would've been cool if you used the crack to make a faded battle scar since vampires can't help but pick fights often with their eternal life.  I love this doll and and all your other Halloween dolls this is my favorite part of October is when you and other custom doll makers make Halloween dolls
Hextians hot glue nail hack could be easier for next time.  I love the epoxy nails but I know it can be a lot of work to file them. I believe he shows the technique in his most recent videos (as of 10/2023).
Dollightful understood the assignment!! 👏👏👏
YOU NEED TO SELL THOSE PORTRAITS AT THE END PLEEEEEEASE
woooooooooo another dude!!!
The open mouth is INCREDIBLE
I'm so sorry but he looks sorta like karkat
He came out so well! I was fascinated by sculpting his palate and teeth! Ingenious! I also really liked the family portrait gallery!
OHMYYGODDDD I LOVE HIM!!!!! in terms of how babygirl ur monster boys are i'd say the goatman really wins in that regard, but there's something about this handsome boyish vampire that sets off my cute aggression in a different way than other dolls you've done. ^_^
I love this doll so much!!! The faceup is my fav part!!!! He looks awesome!!!!
The mini stop-action after the reveal was adorbs, Katherine! I love how you took several real artists' work and turned them into vampires ❤
Okay i love this doll but i am gonna say this  PLS MAKE A ICE DRAGON DOLL😢
I love that this gives SAO Vibes.
I LOVE the vampire paintings you made in the end sequence!! Is there any chance you’d consider selling them as posters, or even just posting them online to admire?
My heart rate increased exponentially as soon as I saw the thumbnail and I gasped when I saw the final concept art. I wish I owned his outfit in my size, it is exactly my aesthetic. He is SO GORGEOUS, a wonderful mix of classic vampire, punk, and a little cute smirk ❤️ I want to try the tooth technique myself now. I also want to design a messy 80s vampire. And the pictures of him and Ember would be such an adorable print!!!!
Gosh, another amazing doll and i loveeeddd the ending! Very amazingly done! 🖤❤
I love that 1920/30 look for him sooo much
He gives me Rin Okumura's vibe
I LOVE this boy! What an awesome design for a vampire!
ive never seen a doll with custom teeth! so cool!
I love 😍 when I see male doll repaint please make more male repaint 🙏🥺
Accidental Karkat
Heathcliff looks like a cooler vampire version of Bakugo and I love it!
I saw the concept art and LITERALLY gasped. I'M SO EXCITED FOR HIM, HES SOOO CUTE EDIT: oh he's HOT hot EDIT EDIT: OH MY GOD THE END CUTSCEEEEENE would you be willing to share some of those heathcliff paintings as wallpapers? They're just uGH SO CUTE
Whaoo
How much!? Take my money! TAKE IT!!!
I love Heathcliff's smirk! You did amazing work! Loved the video!!
Do more male dolls
He’s really cute but his teeth could have been a little more pointy… and the Nike shoes just really doesn’t give the vampire vibes… maybe if it was painted all black… also the straight hair could have better suited him. Just details, but he’s adorable anyway.
Awesome!! He looks like he could easily be a high school BFF of the other Monster High dolls!
He's amazing I love this doll so much😍
Poof hair made him look like a vampy eddie munson
I especially loved all of those paintings in the end. Heath in these many different art styles and time periods is just immaculate
He turned out so cool!! I love all your girl dolls, but the boy dolls deserve just as much love. And the paintings at the end made the art history nerd in me so very happy! Happy Halloween everyone!! 🦇❤
Ahhh! he's so cool!  I loved the ending with all the different images of him made through history.  I love that detail!
Stop it you can't have me crushing on a doll what have you done 😭💖🫣😳💖
Oh he is the QUEEN of the night, looks fabulus and he knows it
Happy Halloween everyone! 👻🎃 This year I’m going as the pope for silly stuff :P
I feel like he and the werewolf girl would fight and pick eachother alot but its only because they like eachother and are 1. Too stubborn to admit it or 2. Idiots.
it looks really good but im a little disappointed a vampire character doesnt have very prominent sharp fangs. i know its hard to work with such little details but they honestly look like normal teeth! already looking forward to next year, i love the halloween doll set so much.
Ahhh he is so good. I love your aesthetic and his sculpted mouth. How good is that jacket as well!
I love the spiky pants, they're like dinosaur pants, i hope she uses them for a future project cause they're really cute!
I can't believe it's been a year since you made Zura?! It feels like a few months ago... But Heathcliff looks amazing! You did such a good job with his smirk.
WHY KATHRINE?! WHY WOULD YOU MAKE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VAMPIRE DOLL 😭everything about heathcliff is the perfect vampire aesthetic, im obsessed....
I feel like heathcliff and Ember would be a good couple 😅
i love when you do stop motion with your dolls!
So coolllllll
Now I'm voting for Heathcliff to have a off/on vampire girlfriend lol one who doesn't stick closely to that classic vampire esthetic- I'm imaging blonde hair, icy blue eyes, and lots of purple and green, rather than black and red!
i just kept on saying "GYAAT" the entire video XD I have a thing for vampire boys you did amazingg!!! i love itt!!!!! X33
It's giving Cirque du Freak and I'm living for it
Love it.
I'm looking forward to your halloween doll each year, it's just part of spooky season!
I love him sooooooo much! He's awesome!
Heathcliff, don't you know that it is me? It's Cathy. Now come on over. So cold! Let me in on your window.
I need him 😍😍🥵🥵🥴🥴
It's amazing how skillfull you are in so many different areas, the amount of work you put into your dolls is incredible! I don't do doll customizing myself, but watching your videos always brings me joy, this one is no exception. Love how Heathcliff turned out :)
Oh my God that final photoshoot was awesome
i was wondering why he seemed so familiar, and i figured out why just at the end during the photoshoot. he really really reminds me of rin from blue exorcist, i might be the only one that kinda sees it though
Honestly, I thought something looked off when I saw the finished mouth, and I know what it is : you don’t see his cheek « scrunch » on the side where he smirks. It’s as flat as the other side and there’s nota single wrinkle.
Reminds me of Marshall lee from Fiona and cake
Damn he's the victim of 2016 box brows
Vampire Knight Vibes
i love this doll but these shoes are so ugly ❤️‍🩹
I love your little stop animation clips at the end.
thats such a good cinematic i love it so much
Thank you for the new video! :)
He reminds me of bakugo in a nice way. Awesome job! such a handsome vampire and those pictures at the end are so cute!!
omg he reminds me of alucard ><
idk if pathologic completely rotted through my brain but that's Bachelor
All the paintings at the end where great
I think he should have had a puttle epoxy put on his cheeks to resemble the muscle and fat that gets squished up in your face when you smirk like he is. But the expression still comes off very clearly and is well done! I love how he came out and this is one of my favorites of your Halloween series now. :)
I do love this doll, but my brain has been tainted so I only think of the lame orange cat when I see the name Heathcliff. Sorry!
Simply incredible, the effect of the 3D teeth is so cool and I’ve never seen anything like it before!
Is there anyone going as one of Katherine’s characters? I’m going as yulia and was wondering if any other people had the same idea
I love how the lighting also plays well into Heathcliffe. It works so well for him! And yes, can’t refuse the old classic hues for his kind. Oddly, I’m also getting some 'boy band' or biker vibes from his design. I guess I blame a little bit on "The Lost Boys" since they were a biker vampire gang.😅
5 HOURS? HI KATHERINE!
WHAT AARE YOU DOING TO ME HES SO PERFECT??????
I would love to make that jacket in human scale it’s so cool 😯
tell me this isn't a kpop idol fitting into a concept for halloween
He's super cute. I love his outfit. We need him in the MH G3 universe.
10:06 😮 💕💕💕 10:11 😔💔💔💔
Heathcliff reminds me of Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians and Charles from the Webtoon Vampire Husband. This might be my favorite custom of yours yet!!
No one:   Me: *actually jumps when her hand comes in*
He looks like he would wear a fedora and be obsessed with being a gentleman, but still being safe enough to let him watch your drink at a party. And my man is KILLING IT in that pompadour!
Heathcliff as in the main character of Wuthering Heights? Even if its not, the name still fits him beautifully!
he is SO CUTE!! And the art at the end!! Love it
YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE BROTHER VAMP TOO OMG
ik u wanted him to look cool but hes just too cute, i wanna pinch his cheeks! great job, love the coat especially its such a great piece
what if you made a doll of your cats? it'd be sooo cute! love your vids btw all of em are bangers!
Maybe it's my own aesthetic talking- but that line of paint layers could have made a cool scar! He's got the whole biker look, and is who knows how many hundreds of years old. Why not give his face a bit of his story?  He's a beautiful doll! Welcome Heathcliff!
Can I just say Senpai~ 👉👈
You should make a version of Medusa next time!!!
It’s so good, wish his teeth were sharper
I think the wavy hair last-second choice was a very good call for giving his hair a slightly wild yet styled look.
Love this!! I think he's super fun as a character concept and I adore his jacket.
He’s darling, my dear.
I am so stoked for these every year!! 🎃❤️
Amazing as always 🥰❤️✨
Who else noticed the pumpkin moving at 6:03 😱 hope it was from the vibrations from the air brush lol
Whoops, nice vampire, you did more than okay, he is unique
The trad vampire with Nike kicks is sending me (in the best way)😂
he could be my edward cullen
A PRETTY BOY VAMPIRE ❤
He’s so good! Wish his canines were sharper!
I think I just drooled
I loved all the versions of Heathcliff throughout the decades. Really cool touch. But since Heathcliff is a British name does that mean he’s British?
Oh my god stooooppppp he’s so cool!!!!! I think this is my new favourite
Omg I feel like him and ember should be a couple they would be so cute together
My favorite part of these custom doll videos is your wonderful concept art and your art style!! It’s so fun and pretty :)
Im in a huge vampire vibe because of Astarion of Bg3 and this boy made me happy! Great job as always ❤❤❤
Please tell me you’re selling prints of those final pictures, I’m obsessed with that old timey immigration one
Oh. My. GOODNESS!!! This is FANTASTIC!!! I am- heh- DECEASED!! Heathcliff is SO CUTE!! The absolute most adorable!!! Omg!!! And all that art at the end WOW what a beautiful touch!! I'm a huge fan of Vampires just chillin' through the ages, havin a blast and all that LOL! Gosh Katherine you never miss- i think this is one of your best dolls yet! Design wise, technically with the OUTFIT OMG it is the CUTEST LITTLE JACKET AAAA I'm sure Heathcliff is such a sweet vamp!  I do think it woulda been cool to also see him in the other outfit you made him tho lol! I'm sure Heathcliff has had his phases....
love the handsome sporty goth boy and love the art at the end, what a cute friend group
i love it
im a sucker for vampire lore and looks and this was no difrent! probably one of my favorites but i am bias. very well done!
Maybe he should date the werewolf /hj
Wait, did you paint all of those pictures in the hall??????? They were so cool!!!!!!!
I love him! He’s very much a anime pretty boy vampire. Love it!
Katherine you have somehow captured my ideal boyfriend from middle school, he is perfect
Aaah, love him! He looks like someone out of the manga/anime Hellsing ❤
He kinda looks live the kid vampire from little vampire but grown up.❤
Are Heathcliff and Ember a couple?
I have a cat-vampire OC named Ricky and have wanted to make an OOAK doll of him so bad. But unfortunately I don’t have the time or skill to make him. Or the money currently to pay someone else to, rip.
I love how he's always smiling for the camera😈
I saw the video and went >:O i was so excited i almost flung my mouse across the room (computer mouse)
I DID A DOUBLE TAKE UPON SEEING THE THUMBNAIL!!! So excited!
Kinda reminds me of Astarion from Baldurs gate 3 😍✨🖤
First of all. I'm OBSESSED with the skit at the end.   Second, have you considered finding voice claims for your characters? Existing voice acting work, actors, songs, etc?
He looks like a mix of a persona 5 character and a vampire and I love it!
He looks like such a cocky loveable jerk haha i love it
He looks like roderick from the doawk movies (the first few)
Yours such a good doll customizer!!!!😊🎉❤ i wish i could be as good as you one day....Im trying tho!!! I wanna be able to use your simplistic but cutsy style with a touch of anime and impliment it in my own work!! ❤
Oh, I love him!!! Heathcliff is wonderful!!
Missed opportunity to make the line on his face a cool scar!! Otherwise he looks amazing!!!! 🫶
He reminds me of the movie "The Little Vampire" but all grown up. But  I remember you making a vampire for HeXtian a few years back. Anyway, this was awesome.
My only complaint is that I just think he needs a dangly earring
okay but why do i want an actual 15145834545 episode dorky "teenage vampire king who does everything absolutely wrong but in a confident cool way" anime of him now please explain, thank you QuQ <3
I love him! Great work as always. Out of curiosity, is there a reason you didn’t paint his mouth before gluing it in?
Heathcliff just strengthened my monster boy attraction!🤣 he’s so handsome. 🥰   Anyway I have some suggestions for next year’s Halloween custom if you wanna hear them! (You don’t have to do them of course!)  I would really wanna see a sea monster like a Leviathan creature from you! I know it’s similar to your mermaid and sea dragon customs, but you can make them horror themed like your werewolf to set them apart!   Also I’d love to see a zombie! Either horror themed, or cute boy or girl themed. I love zombies and I think they’re perfect for Halloween!  You could also do a ghost using any of the haunted dolls, or your own Frankenstein’s monster doll (with differences from Frankie of course) that way you can complete the classic monster trio with that one and the werewolf and vampire!   Really I’d love for you to continue the classic monsters for Halloween, I know you’d be using the same concepts as the actual MH dolls but you could still make them your own characters! But really it’s up to you. Happy Halloween Cathrine!!
Wow, he turned out so amazing! And all the art for the ending skit this year was truly incredible, hats off to you!! The Leyendecker style portrait is especially gorgeous ❤
He's really cool but the mouth seems very stiff. Like he's forcing his lower jaw to the side. Also, I really think you should get nail art brushes. If you find good quality brushes they're made to last and with stand harsh chemicals like acetone. And they come in tiny sizes for nail details.
Reading heathcliff in the title definitely made me think of the orange comic cat! Still I love this doll hes super cool and the smirking mouth really worked out!!
Wake up babe dollightful just posted😎 WAAA HE LOOOS SO COOL
The walk down the hallway and then pinning up the photo booth pic with Ember and the banshee was so cute. He’s like the hip younger brother of Nadja from What We Do In The Shadows. I love this!
I love his mischievous smile it reminds me of someone I know I was thinking maybe he could have a little sister doll that wears the other set of clothes? Since they’re made for a male doll they would be over sized and it would look like his little sister is borrowing his clothes? I just think that would be cute
I think the smirk could have been a touch thinner (bringing in where the bottom lip curves out) but I do remember your comment about vinyl being "bouncy" so I imagine that's not an easy thing to do precisely (and I've never chiseled away at vinyl). So all that being said, it's not a bad shout :)  Future potential suggestion for if that "peeling" that happened during the airbrushing. You could always turn that into a scar. Depending on the character, it could add a cool battle tale, into their backstory.  He is pretty cool though, always excited when a video pops into my feed :)
He is damn hot and cute same time ❤
the nike runners are perfect for dolls!!
As a good cover-up for the missing paint on the face, it could've been guickly changed into a scar of some kind. It's just the first thing I thought of!
Oh my god, he gives me so much Jack Frost vibe!!! He's the guardian of Halloween for sure 😂
He's so handsome! I love his devilish smirk, he's such a sexy bad boy ;) Those teeth are absolutely amazing!
That jacket is just amazing- the whole thing came together so well and every detail is perfect!
You would love Astarion from bg3
This doll was finalized with all the right choices. The kicks, the modern coat with old school touches, the smirk. It's perfect.
HUSBAND
Bro he looks like a twilight character as an anime!
Im scraming HE IS GENUINELY VERY HANDSOME MDMD The shoes and the smirk and wavy hair rlly does it fr hes perfect
He looks straight out of Lost Boys 🖤🖤🖤
the way i GASPED at seeing you in my recommended!!!!! Youtube you did GOOD!
Him hanging from the light by his Nikes 😭😂 I love him, hes my new blorbo for sure
Still can't get over the loss of the Wendigo doll, it's such a shame so much work and such a great design was left in the dust...
The face up look good but the clothes  do not match the character ❤
OMGGG U SHOULDVE WENT MMORE IN DEPRH WITH THE MOTORCYCLIST JACKET AND GAVE HIM A HELMET
This guy looks like a piece of shit I love him
interesting thing you did with the mouth to show off the fangs
Omg I’m in love with ALL THE PHOTOS AT THE END. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BOOK❤❤❤❤❤
absolutely killer doll design and i also loved the hall of his past portraits! the photo booth thing is also very cute (but am i fuckin stupid or does he look like karkat vantas exclusively in those photos pls god)
Such calming yet spooky atmosphere! I already adore the toothy boy ❤🖤🧡🤍
Detailing is very nice, steady hands for sure!
I love his jacket!!! Gosh, I want a life size one!!
I think the line on his face looks like a scar! Which is neat :]
HIS NAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN AZREAL LIKE GARGAMELS CAT
i LOVE him!! love the mix of street clothes and historical kinda fashion. love the nails. and esp love teeth!! i know the line on his cheek was an accident, but i love it because it reminds me of my favorite vampire feature: appearing human but having a secretly monsterous jaw that can open ear from ear. big fan of it all! great work as always!! ❤
I always love the little skits that the Halloween dolls get at the end!
You made my DREAM VAMP BOY ❤❤❤❤❤
"WHEN I WAS, A YOUNG BOY "
This vampire looks like Hueningkai !
he’s so cute and cool omg!! i love that you went ahead and made his hair wavy at the end
Hii!! I am a fan ^^
I love when you do Halloween or creepy dolls  (it's my favorite holiday) also he looks so cool TT
I love him, he totally looks like the mysterious, dark and edgy love interest of a Korean romance comic. The 3D teeth look awesome!
He’s giving Jack Frost but if he somehow ended up in Halloween town instead of with the guardians and I am here for it
Level UP! This design is amazing!
Love this doll! you should toltally make him a ghost/paranormal hunter bf for him next year!!
The name of the paint on the second paint bottle at 6:28  "Russian AF Grey" 😭What's up with that name?? 💀💀💀
This turned out so cool!! I love the design and the nikes are SUCH a fun touch.
Its giving Enhypen :D lol, good job
He is so handsome and bad ass looking I love him he is in my top ten of the dolls you have made.
The picture at the end gives me so much joy
he the typa guy to ask " where my hug at "
GAHHH I LOVE WHEB YOY DO MASC DOLLS 🥹🥹
The mark with the paint actually looks like an interesting scar of sorts! Also how fitting for his name to be Heathcliff with the maker being Katherine! (Wuthering Heights ref)
He's so prettyyyyyyyyy😭
Would you consider making a pattern for the jacket for the Etsy store?? He’s awesome!!
The grey sclera is a really neat idea and it really made the eye highlights pop!  That face up is masterful, well done!  (Also an idea for next year’s spooky doll- a girl vampire buddy for this dude!  You’d have a chance to develop some wicked cool gothic inspired clothing too 🎶 it’s just an idea but I’d think a vampire couple would rock the Halloween scene ❤❤❤ Thank you for going through all the trouble to film your artistic process!  I’ve always wanted to do the same for my creations but I’m always too focused on the project plans themselves rather than filming them… maybe someday I’ll get to it.   And I’ve always gotten super inspired to turn my dolls into new characters from your videos! So thank you so much Katherine!  (My fave episode is still Terra the Earth Dragon I’ve watched it like 8 times lol) Also- greetings from Texas!
this js really different than usual ! you used some fun techniques here that i didnt know until now
He looks like my older brother 😭👍
"Russian af grey" i need me colours like this🦾🦾
Well now I ship heathcliff and ember
Oh no he's hot
He is so… so… he’s just… he’s… him <3
Before the hair was trimmed, it reminded me so much of Eddie Munson from Stranger Things 4. I hope we get to see a Kas Eddie that looks like that! Wonderful work. ♡
OMGGGG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS!!! TYYY!!!
i'm suprised that you still haven't made a zombie or a frankenstein's monster. But still of all your projects heathcliff is my favorite!!!❤
Im a MASSIVE Dracula lover, and in my opinion the best "ancient vampire in modern times" adaptation was Netflix's "Dracula" when youre around for centuries, you arent suprised as much by new advancements, and to stay hidden, you need to adapt so easily (not mentioning that draclua just needs to drink the blood of someone to gain MEMORIES, and their understanding of a language, including slang) The more modern outfits you picked wouldve been perfect! I hope that maybe next year or some Halloween in the future you bring them back for another vamp!!
I will never make a doll bit watching Katherine do it just makes me do happy because they always look so good    Edit: i honestly thought he and the witch girl were gonna be best friends but hey, the others work too
Ahhhh another wonderful Halloween doll! Love it!  Hmm wonder if you can combine the unused outfit with the unused body from Uvie? Eh but maybe those colors wouldn't work together
I looove that you completely leaned into the Emo Boy Aesthetic I think it’s so fun when these scary monsters look like regular teens, it’s what monster high is all about!
Me: hehe i'm 1th! You: what do you mean "1th?" Me: 1,384th....
Bro he’s literally so cutie patootie I love him so much 😭😭🙏🏾💕
Amazing doll creation dollightful, I love the name too, Heathcliff, he also reminds me of the vampire rudolph from the movie, A Little Vampire such a good movie also, keep up the good work dollightful your imagination is always great and amazing❤
he looks a bit like anaesthetic is wearing off from the dentist 😅
my fav. parts of the makeover is the end photoshoot and the showing of the end doll.
oh my god im in love with him??? the sculping on the mouth looks SO good, its really crazy. it really elevates the faceup you did. also the jacket is incredible. i love the red satin and the myriad of buckles. he's very final fantasy to me
God I love this doll so much!! He’s so cheeky lol  So much personality <33
i want him
Heathcliff looks like he could be a member of Gorillaz
heathcliff and kathy??? just like wuthering heights
All the artwork at the end is amazing! I especially love the photobooth set ❤ Those teeth were so impressive!
Seeing your videos always brings me such joy, thank you so much, Katherine. :)
Him hanging upside down at the end killed me, I love it 😆
Yes a male doll.❤❤❤
I SWEAR UR HALLOWEEN VIDEOS GIVE ME LIFE!!!!!
He looks like he is just waiting to flirt with the monster demon girl
He reminds me of Rudolph from The Little Vampire.
i love him he's so edgy
He’s kinda…
He reminds me of a teen Rudolph from little vampire
Lmao why does he remind me of Warm Bodies 😂
Love him! His outfit and face turned out so good! May I suggest making a grim reaper or jack-o-person next? (Just a suggestion! I'm sure whatever you choose to do next will look fantastic!)
That is a toxic eboy and you did a fantastic job
I was waiting for this one! Your Halloween doll customs are among my favorites! I love this little guy! His eyes and grin along with his outfit are so cool! I think he's my favorite so far! 💖
I love it!!! He is friends with Banshee and Ember!!! I adore him, with all my heart~ Halloween dolls are some of the most incredible of the season and I adore them! They really brighten my day!
Katherine is the only person who could make me attracted to a doll
He’s baby
I this Heathcliff is my new favourite Halloween doll of yours. I love him!
Heathcliff and Ember look really cute ❤
A BOOOOOOOOY!!!!! I love seeing your girl dolls the faces are breathtaking but getting to see a boy every now and again is definitely a treat. He's adorable lol
the hanging back peace of the jacket is so cool, and i thought if you add wire inside that in the shape of the cape u can modify it so it looks like its swaying in the wind
The fact that his fangs are not long enough kinda throws me off as he’s a vampire but nonetheless cool project!! Having him hang upside down like a bat! Hahahah genius!!!🙌💜 Ps. Please please get a small scissor for hair cutting specifically, or small razor! It’d help your dolls not having rough cuts showing!! Your clothes on the other hand are TOP! Wonderful!! With love!❤️❤️❤️
nooo i loved the 80s hair 😆 he looked like a lost boy !
Next Halloween I would love to see a 구미호
I love your Halloween customs! The vampire is kind of a classic, isn’t it? 😅 But I think you didn’t REALLY lean into clichés, which I love!
love this one a lot! I always enjoy your face sculpts. and the skit at the end! so cute!
i love the family of monsters and spooky creatures that grows every year! the way each character is so different but still fit in their own way is so cute! the collage with heathcliff and the others at the end was absolutely adorable!!!! 😭💕💕 i love the subtle story telling thru your artwork! keep up the amazing work!!!
I used to have a black cat named Heathcliff. He was such a good boy and this heathcliff reamind me of him. ❤
Your art is incredible in both 2d and 3d! I love the way you shade !
i love love love him !!! something about his look makes me want to see a denji from csm doll from you 😍🤩
I don't know if there's a reason for this but it seemed as though he was wearing wedges in the concept art. I can come up with too many theoretical reasons as to why. I'd love to know the actual one.
Katherine is making her own Monster High school and I’m loving it!🥰. He also looks someone Valentine would date!
Uuuuhh he’s hot. Why is he so hot ❤😂😅
He's incredible!! Your massive projects has always been a delight but seeing you do such great small detail work like the smirk, teeth and nails is downright incredible! I haven't missed an upload since you've been back and I am so grateful for the time you take to produce these videos for us. I think its amazing that you can create such beautiful art dolls, produce a video for us, and be a mom on top of it. You rock Katherine!!!
I'm so crazy impressed by the work you did with his mouth. You sculpted him entirely new gums!!! And it turned out so great, his whole face looks amazing. The art at the end is also an adorable touch, you put so much love into these videos
I LOVE HIM OMG ‼❣
This is my favourite doll you’ve ever made! It looks super cool. He kinda reminds me of kuzuhas black hair outfits from Nijisanji :)
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS HALLOWEEN IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A VAMPIRE Great work as always dollightful!!
Woooo!!!! New video!!!!!!!
With the ending photos of him and Ember, it feels like they're dating 🤭🤭
He looks like a Korean vampire and I'm here for it
Can you make him a twin brother with an 80s poof? 😂
Omggggg he’s so handsome!! And I love all the art you did of him in different eras! Such a nice touch!!
The way you got his mouth to look open and natural is so impressive! Dollightful is literally a wizard in REAL life lol
You did a great job! The smirk looks a little off, but i see the vision. Great doll once again!
I, really don't like his mouth. To me, it takes away from the... Idk, vibe
I love when Katherine posts ❤️  And I love the idea of a vampire doll.  When It comes to my favorite version or vampires or other supernatural creatures, I love TVD- The Vampire Diaries.
YESSS another Dollightful Halloween 😆😆🎃🎃!!
Its giving rodrick hefley
The drawings at the end omg, theyre so cute !
The doll itself is great, but i honestly think my favourite part is all the art you did for his private gallery - the evolving styles over time are so fun!
Heck yeah I’ve been hoping for a Dollightful vampire! He looks great Kathrine!
I love the way you made his clothes this time! Your trial and error approach yielded excellent results. I never use patterns to sew, but it also never seems to go so well.😂
He came out awesome! I love the smirk and how well the sculpted fangs came out!
I cannot take this man seriously when his name is heathcliff-which is also the name of the cat in a garfeild rip off cartoon. He shares a name with a goofy orange cat.
16:44 JC Leyendecker reference!!!!
He reminds me of a handsome version of Alucard of the Hellsing series 😍😍
I NEVER THOUGHT IS SIMO FOR ONE OF DOLLIGHTFULS CHARACTERS BUT OMG HERE WE ARE
Where is the Wendigo doll in the halloweeen lineup? I miss her
Okay he is pretty cute ngl
🦇🧛🏼🧛🏼‍♀️🪄🎃🖤🕸️🕷️🕸️🕷️🔮✨🧙‍♀️✨🧙‍♀️🔮🖤🕸️🕷️🖤🕸️🕷️🔮✨🧙‍♀️🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼🪄🕸️🕷️🧙‍♀️🦇🧛🏼🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼🧛🏼🦇🧛🏼‍♀️🪄🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼🧛🏼🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼‍♀️🦇🧛🏼🧛🏼‍♀️🪄⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️🧛‍♂️🧛‍♂️🧛‍♂️🧛‍♂️🧛🏽‍♂️🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸

I love the group pictires at the end. So cute!
Me simping for a doll neverrrrrrrrrrrrrr
He looks so cute! Amazing job as usual ❤
i think he would be cute as a boy friend for demon girl i forgot her name
He looks great! I love the smirk as well. 10/10 for sure 😄😄
Ok but i am in love with him and we're gonna run away together now
I really hope you post all the drawings you did for that final scene on Instagram.  I want to look at them more closely! I love Heathcliff, he's so cheeky!
There's just something about the smile and hair that reminds me so much of Rin Okumura in Blue Exorcist!
Ember's new boyfriend!!
OMG FOR MONTHS I BEEN THINKING OF WHO UR VOICE REMINDS ME OF. BUT I FINALLY GOR IT, U SOUND LIKE THE WIFE FROM AMERICAN DAD
I love the lore and life u give to each doll. I love the dollightful universe <3
i think your interpretation of traditional goth style could look really cool! a goth doll would also be perfect for next spooky season
The hair is giving Shigeo Kageyama I love it
hes handdsome nice job
Heathcliffs mouth is just a smidge to wide for me. It hits a little bit uncanny but maybe that’s a good thing! And you did such a fantastic job on the doll. He looks so great!
im so excited you're using g3 sculpts! theyre so great
im so obsessed with this guy 😭 next to all the girls he looks like the transguy friend in a group of sapphics, and i mean that with both affection and experience
it’s amazing! (as always) i look forward to your halloween videos every year and this was another banger. he reminds me of marshall lee from adventure time but more anime!
I Love him so much. And the Foto und the end was so smart and cool❤
Those photos are incredible!!
HAPPY Halloween 🦇 great job Katherine and lol yeah Barb really knows how to set the bar really high
he's so cute!!! i love his fluffy hair
this is my favourite custom of yours by far! I don't even know what it is but he just drags me into him
He’s got the Leon Kennedy Re4 Remake smile! 😂❤
This has to be my new favorite 😍 😤
Anyone else giggle and kick their feet the whole time 😅❤❤
the photo booth pics where so cute. He looks like he could walk out of a kdrama.
Omg he’s veeeery handsome!
He looks amazing! I love him! his cheeky grin deffinatly adds character! I also LOVE how the outfit and just everything turned out!
I love him so much he's the exact kind of cute anime boy character that I adore
the airbrush is the real monster🤣
💕💕💕💕💕💕💞💞💞 8:05
That first design resembled Astarion from Baldur's Gate 3 so much! I'm so happy you decided to create a vampire for this year, very fitting :)
One of your best videos and dolls yet!!!! So amazing!!!🎃🧛🏻♥️
something about this expression (especially with the lips) reminds me of studio laika! i love it!! ❤
"Lets take the cute boy approach!" *Dissapointed noise*
Omg I loveeeeee him. The design is so cute, and the smirk really gives him charm. Love it. I can't wait for more dolls
Love the rest but his teeth remind me more of an ogre. And his mouth in general makes him look braindead but not in a halloweeny way.
omg. when you started airbrushing I went "oh no! Katherine didn't give him pointy ears!" out loud, and when you mentioned it and fixed it before painting him, I squealed with happiness! I've been a massive fan of your videos for years now, and was always hoping you'd do a vampire someday! I love vamps and they're my absolute favorite so this video was such a treat! I don't comment often but I just had to for this. Happy Halloween everyone!!
I love him so much! But those shoes..
Could he have a little sister or little brother or even a partner!! ✨  (I just had a small idea for some reason 😅💦 and I love you video they are the best ✨)
WEED NEED A ZOMBIE
Is it just me or is this doll hot
You could make a mini series out of stories with your dolls
oh HELL yes i love this
Man…I love vampires. Especially this one
Thank you for showing the movies/show names I needed it
I love the spooky fantasy vibes! Have you ever considered doing a fantasy or dungeons and dragons themed character, or even a group of characters? I think it would look so cool!
W RIZZLER VAMPIRE 😶😶😶✨✨
I really want to see her take on a kelpie-inspired doll sometime...
Omg I love his design, he looks like Rin Okumura 😅 more in the art than the doll. Great doll as always and I love all the art in the end. Especially the 50s vamp reminds me of Space Dandy but wouldn't a 50s vampire concept be so fun? I imagine the darkness contrasting the bubbly vibe well - I'd watch it!
He is handsome and very cute, as they would say at MH he is fangtastic! (Plus, I like to imagine that before you cut his hair that maybe he just woke up from a many decades long slumber during the rock star era and that he woke up thinking it was still in style and having to cut it off to blend in better today... 😅)
Im so impressed by the mouth. Good job!
I still think Wendy, long may she reign, is my favorite Dollightful doll 😢. All of her Halloween dolls are great, and I’m glad she’s got two boy Halloween dolls now!
SUCH a fan of those teeth!! also the little details in the editing to make the whole video feel spookier, the transitions, the music… I’m in love!!
THE ENDING SHOT WAS SO CUTEE AHHHHH! I want a comic about our monster teens so badly now
IM DROOLING- HELP WHY IS HE SO FINE 😭😭😭😭😶😶😶😶
... did I just catch feelings for an anime boy vampire doll?
You HAVE to make a killer clown next year then you'll have all the classic
Oh I love him. He gives me Lost Boys vibes.
The shoes with the gothic vibe are iconic 😂
YES I WAS SO HOPING FOR A HALLOWEEN COLLAB !!
the amount of gender envy im getting from heathcliff is CRAZY AAAFGghr
oh he's very handsome! i'm a sucker (haha) for vampires.
the cool jacket covered in belts with the big chunky sneakers is giving such Asuka Kreutz (Guilty Gear) vibes! I love this doll soooooo much tho!!!!
He's so freaking CUTE! The smirk is so good, I love him ❤
This mod is cool!! G3 dolls are great canvas for your to explore!!! ❤
oh he’s so fine
Does the ending comic imply that Ember and Heathcliff are just friends… or something more…?
Soooo cool! Love these Halloween videos
Alright, where's his boyfriend.. He looks so zesty..
I thought the crack on his face was a hair in my screen 😂
Just fixed the clasp on one of my hooded cloaks last night.
You can never go wrong with a longcoat for maximum Cool Factor
The line on his cheek is cool!! It's like a leftover duel scar from before he was turned!!
gay little wet cat of a man (complimentary)
Omg! I’m in love 😍
aint NO business making a doll this good looking.......absolutely love it (AHHH AND THE PICTRES AT THE END SO CUTEEE!!!)
The whole video i was hoping you would say he’s ember’s boyfriend
You could say that line down his face is a scar he got after something happened maybe after running from human or he fell of his motorcycle when he was human and it just stuck, also I love Vampires and he looks amazing
Love it
he’s a where my hug at guy
* new fictional crush unlocked *
the fact that the skin tone is a mix of dead white, pale flesh and "Russian af gray"
I love heathcliff! He looks great I think it would be so cool if one year you made a human version of your werewolf girl! Love your videos Katherine!
I love him so much omg omg
I WOULD LET HIM BITE ME
this has gotta be my favorite doll you have ever made 🤩🤩🤩
such a great halloween video this year! i especially love the ending sequence, your editing skills really level up more and more with every video :) i love seeing what you and hubby create together!
WOWW HELLO?? THE SKIT AT THE END WITH ALL THE REFERENCES TO CLASSICAL PAINTINGS AND STYLES? THAT WAS AMAZING, every year I think "this si the peak of the channel" and every year you come up with a new exciting way to make halloween your time to *shine*
His expression is SO WELL DONE; he totally looks like he just jumpscared a protagonist, and then made a cheeky teasing comment at them. I LOVE IT!!!
Oh whoa, this is very brilliantly genius, mysterious, and cool work on creating a new custom doll for Halloween 2023.
Giving Corpse Husband realness
i miss the wendigo.... :´(
He has the same energy as staz from bloodlad but heathcliff is cooler lol I love him
Just say the line on his face is an old scar from when a monster hunter tried to challenge him and lost.
Don’t worry Cathrine, I also happen to look paper white in black clothing lol
i literally squeal everytime i see a dollightful post (especially halloween omg!!)
oh he’s got that T boy swag i love him so much
Visually in the concepts, he gave me a bit of Valentine from Monster High vibes! He’s very cute
You are so good at what you do! The fact that you alternate your styling and use different techniques always make your creations so unique. He is actually really cute and I love the styling and the details in the paintings. Well done Catherine.😊
This really inspired me to create my own drawings for Halloween! Amazing work as always Katherine, thank you for inspiring me! <33
These halloween dolls are always incredible, and heathcliff is no exception
You're hitting all my weaknesses with this one, even the name! My own precious BJD is called Heathlynn, Heathcliff is such a cool name. And a vampire boy, mwah 💖
X: how are you going to fall in love with a doll??  THE DOLL:
i love how heathcliff has different looks and personalities as katherine pointed out, at first i thought he was a kpop vampire star,the thought he was like a cool skateboarder dude or something like that,another thing ive noticed is that in the last few videos she utilises G3 monster high dolls,could this be a new era?i love it!!!!!! i wonder if she would make a series like life on the shelf by myfroggystuff <3
ALL I CAN SEE IS KUZUHA FROM NIJI
He looks awesome! Id love to see you play Frankenstein and put different loose doll parts together for a Kathrinstein Monster!
RAAAAH THIS IS SO GOOD!!! THE SHOES ADD SUCH A FRESH VIBE, AND I LOVE IT!!!
That poofy 80s rock star hair made me realize, what if you made an 80s style doll? Doesn't have to be a rock star, could be anything really!
Love it, Katherine!  You did a great job!:)  He came out awesomely cute and yet very vampy in a semi-creepy sense but not overly creepy:)  you found a great balance here;)♥
HEATHCLIFF MORE LIKE HEATCLIT CAYSE THATS ME RIGHT NOW!! DAAAADDYYY!
i love how he came out! that toothy smirk is so cute, love his face and hes very fashionable lol
Not me simping for the character design drawing at 1:07😭
Getting teenage animals vampire vibes love him❤
Tatsuo better keep an eye on this new gothic hottie. Juwon might get hypnotized and taken for dinner 🫢
This is so awesome!!!! I'm obsessed 😁💜💜💜
THE PUNS YES
I’ve been watching your Chanel for years           (╥ ‿ ╥) I love all your work, and seeing your personality and creative ideas SHINE through your wonderfully produced videos has made me so happy lately 😊 I’m so proud of  and happy for you girl <33
So air dry clay won't crack or deteriorate if you are just gluing hair wefts? Asking bc I want to find a way to fill in g1 heaths head and haven't had good experience with air dry clay before
You're the best doll whisperer! Everything you do is sooooo coooooolll 🥰😍😍
I absolutely adore this doll! Also! The ending skit with all those different portraits (and the end cute photo) were fantastic! What a sweet touch!
Basically Marhall Lee
YAYYY!!! It’s HALLOWEEN 🎃 in Dollightful! Happy Halloween 2023  🎃 👻
HES SO BABYGIRL
Don’t ask why, but I think he would make a good couple with Prince Eri Frostborn.
Not represented on your channel, other than every time you rip apart a draculara
This is so adorable!
He is soooo cute! It'd be fun to see you give him a sibling or romantic partner who channels his aesthetic with the other outfit you had made. Maybe theyre not a vampire themself but are really into the aesthetic and try to emulate his? Just an idea!
I don't comment often but I _have_ to now, because the art student in me is reeling over how you were able to paint him in all those different styles and not only have the time periods all be recognizable but also still have him be totally recognizable every time?? The absolute mastery. Amazing. Love your artwork.
I love it <3   it kind of looks like Sandman + Gorillaz
He is so cute, he deserves a very festive partner, for a little nightmare before christmas
I like your male dolls more than i do your female dolls. Personally for me, male characters are fun for me to create. Female characters for me are harder to create.
he kinda looks like Jack Frost's evil twin but im all for it
I miss the wendigo
I love how bulky his jacket makes his top half look, because I like to imagine just a tiny little stick of a boy under there 😂
I had Bell’s palsy a month ago and my mouth looks like that everytime I laugh 😂😂😂.
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I love him 🦇❤️❤️ he looks like a fun guy
He gives "Little Vampire" movie vibes and I'm here for it! Great work as per usual!
Ohh I looove him! I would totally try to make him my best friend xD
Can you make a albino character please?
For the past years this has been my Halloween plans, watch dollightful
I woke up and saw that you posted and I was like "YES HALLOWEEN DOLL!!!!"
I WANT TO BE HIM
him and his friends at the end ☹️☹️❤️
he’s giving zuko from avatar and i love it
For some reason, the entire time I was watching, my brain could only see Jack Frost gone goth. That impression got stronger each step.   Anyway, great doll as always 🤗
The line down his face would've made an awesome scar
I just love all of these so much!
I love seeing doll equivalents of  cowlicks
Seeing him hung upside down like a bat really killed me
I love him very much 😍🧛 Great job! 🖤
I love him so much! Now give him a 1950’s style S/O 😳
Dollightful im begging you make more male dolls, they always look really cool😭😭
The collars and belts is giving him big digimon vibes and I love it
I just had a crazy thought, what if she made heathcliff embers boyfriend!
You are such a incredible artist and I hope you never stop to show the world your talent 🥹💙 xoxo from Brazil 🇧🇷 (by the way I would love to see you make a doll inspired in Brazil's culture 😊)
ember and heathcliff would be such a cute couple and I don't know why
OMG I'm obsessed with him!!! He looks amazing!!!!
He looks amazing!! and such a great addition to the lineup!
The line on his face is like a faded scar, so he's extra cool.
It makes me so sad to not see the wendigo doll anymore 😢. She was my favorite…
He looks amazing! Does anyone else think that Heathcliff andand Ember would make such a great couple? So sassy and cheeky!❤
its so tempting to make some of your dolls clothes into human scale
OH NO HES HOTTT
i know the reason why the wendigo got removed from the halloween lineup but it just kinda feels odd to not see her since the explanation video
I love him so much he is so handsome! 😍He's my new favorite boy after Umbreon and Jolteon!🖤♥️💛
Call me Bella Swan, the way I am IN LOVE with this vampire man 😭🫶🏽I’ll get Tatsuo to be my wingman😂
i actually really like the line down his face, it gives him character and could maybe even be a scar. theres usually always work around for mistakes!
Heath cliff is the perfect name. Were you thinking Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights?
I saw his face in the thumbnail and instantly knew this one would be fantastic as usual! Awesome creativity!!
Before she trimmed his hair it looked like Mike from stranger things season 4
would.
I live for your work. You are my favorite doll customizer.😊❤
Holy shit!  He's PERFECT!!!  There really needs to be alot more male customs...set the standard Katherine!! 🖤❤🖤❤
If you sold prints of the photobooth I would soooo buy one. thatwas soooo cute!
Weird how the female monster high dolls all get traditional doll hair rooted into them yet the males have all their hair molded onto their scalp.
3:08 he really said :D
The modern shoes add so much personality
I love him! He might be one of my Dollightful favorites!
I LOVE how at the end theres photos of him, Ember, and Aisling (thats my unofficial name for your Banshee lol). Im loving this monster lore
Half of the time I was like “OMG it’s Dream from The Sandman” Beautiful face up though
I genuinely thought you were making Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights 💀💀💀
Я просто не могу отделаться от мысли, что лицо Хитклифы получился похожим на Александра Рыбака, скрипача-певца из Норвегии, что победил на Евровидение-2009🤭  От причёски до наряда, как мне всё это нравится! Стильный современный образ вампира🖤 Замена обуви только добавила красок и крутости. А какая сложная зубная трансплантология была проведена🤯 Клиент совершенно точно должен был остаться доволен🧛
OMG!!!!!!! Definate smash!!!!!!!!
1:29 is that the Romanian flag I see on the second concept👀
everything about this doll is fantastic but the name heathcliff is definitely always gonna make me think of the cartoon cat. get this vampire a helmet with a nonsensical label on it.
Looks so good, and this photo shoot is seriously killer! Can we get a photo of him next to draculora? Also how old is he supposed to be , being a vampire and all?
RIP paper nails… you will be missed 😢
I absolutely loved the little comic strip thing that you showed at the end there it looked adorable
This is the best faceup ever!!! 🤩 I love the final results 😍
I need one of these in my collection 🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕 he came out so good!!!
AAAAA THIS A FANTASTIC VAMP BOY. I love how he looks like he'd be the kind of character to annoy someone and be smug that he got under their skin but if someone tried to do the same to that same person he'd get mad "Nuh-uh, you don't play with someone's elses toy"
Wait omg the photo at the end, I might be reading too much into this but- Is he demon girl’s boyfriend!!?
OH NO HE'S HOT
you could still use the morden vampire fit for like a vampire fangirl / boy. maybe a heathcilff friend who has no idea his friends with a vampire. like a fan to a celebity.
He is definetly Embers kinda stupid best friend thats way too endearing to stop being friends with

I feel like u should either make him embers bf or make him a bf
2 hours ago, and there’s already 47 thousand views!!
I was looking forward to this years halloween doll and you did not disappoint, I love the outfit and how the skin and eyes turned out! The doll is such a vibe! But to be perfectly honest I can't get behind the mouth, the teeth look great but the fact that his mouth is open with the teeth apart instead of the teeth together looks really goofy to me, less of a smirk and more like someones pulling the corner of his mouth to make him smile lol
Kathrine.. Care to explain why he has nipples..??
DOLLIGHTFUL HAS CREATED ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DOLL YET AGAIN!!!
Vampire Jack Frost vibes for sure. I love him!
I LOVE HIMM!! And I love the little animation thing this year!
I literally fan girl squealed when I saw the new vid post on Insta!! Love him!
As usual, the doll is absolutely gorgeous! I absolutely love your art and you inspire me so much! Heathcliff looks like that middle sibling who refuses to NOT be mischievous even when all his jokes and pranks aren’t actually funny and can probably also be found on a scroll prank page from the 2000 years ago in the Library!
Why he kinda look like if bakugo was a vampire lmao
While she was carving out the teeth with the file my teeth started to hurt 😅 what an odd coincidence
I hope next year we get a stockbox Frankenstein's monster with all the stray doll parts in the box
I love the halloween vidssss❤❤❤❤
happy halloween ive been a fan for a long time im always happy when you post a video ,your my inspo to do doll customs actualy
9:12 battle schars
I love this man, he gives me that impression of the one character everyone simps for, thinking he's hot and mysterious right up until he opens his mouth and reveals he's an absolute dork
Thank you for this Halloween treat! He fits right in with the gang. He's totally plopping down and playing video games, lol.
Oh he's perfect lmao
Damn. He looks awesome. I think about Gorillaz when I see him. Amazing job as always!
Omg I cannot get over the pictures in the hallway during the ending skit. So creative!!
You are the reason why I love Halloween. Thank you for share the repaint process! I love all of your Halloween dolls 🥰
_Me crying because he's not real_ 😢💔  Lmao he turned out great, I love his smile!
oooooo next time you could do either a headless rider or a scarecrow with a jack-o-lantern for a head
Why does Heathcliff kinda look like Alucard from hellsing, but also Rick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid?
I love this design and you executed the faceup sculpt SO well! But let me also say the fact that you made a bunch of full color illustrations from different time periods to show his life throughout history is the wonderful icing on the cake of this video! I'm always blown away by how much versatility you have as an artist. Fabulous job!
Nice to wake up and see this master piece
This has to be one of your best male makeovers to date! What you did with his sinister smile and the coat is beyond stellar! Keep up the great work!!
he looks a little goofy and i love it .
Looks great!
So happy to see another male doll, and a vampire too! I'll look forward to seeing him in the Halloween line-up each year.
the photo booth pictures were so cute, especially because he hung them up with all his other portraits :) they have to be his favorite. i saw another comment saying it'd be cute if he had a younger sibling so the modern clothes wouldn't go to waste, i think that's a great idea!
He’s so… HE’S SO HOOOOOT‼️‼️‼️‼️
He reminds me of Staz from Blood Lad.😊
The face line could be scar from a vampire hunter!
I think im getting feelings for a doll
Thanks to the ending photo, between him, Ember, and the Banshee. Now i have this headcannon that Heathcliff and Ember are the type of friends who share some tea between them/always knows the newest gossip the strated on the block. And im here for it! And lastly amazing doll! ❤
I’M HIM SHIPPING WITH EMBER ❤❤❤!!! He look too good btw I gotta he would also look good beside ember 😊
Now I'm just waiting for mothman ❤
The hall of paintings was perfect, I got so excited by the Layendecker reference.who knew the Arrow Man was a vampire this whole time? 😂
i love the jackolantern motif at the end, because some fables say that if you leave a pumpkin out during the full moon it will grow into a vampire
What about Lilith von Croix?
BACK WITH A BANGER VIDEO ❤❤❤❤thank you for your hardwork as always! he is gorgeous!!!!
the art is absolutely adorable!!!
Please! Please! Please! Make him a coffin!!! I don't want him to turn to dust in sunlight!!! LOL.
Katherine I KNOW you been eaten up What We Do in the Shadows 😭 the vibes are all over this video!!! The little bit at the end with the art of his eras was so coded and so good!!  Ya really outdid yourself with this one. He’s so animated, I’m obsessed! I feel like that art block you mentioned might have worn off, because damn girl! Slayed 💅
Wonder what he'd look like with fingerless gloves?  He's wickedly cool
People who went to the comments (edit: I liked my own comment)  👇
Awesome and cool! ^_^
I was half prepared for something terrible to happen that offset the entire process! Tis almost tradition for a Dollightful video at this point haha.   Love how he came out! Wonderful job :)
Definitely my favorite Halloween doll of yours yet! I love him and you did an amazing job on all parts of him!!! ✨
You could have turned the mistake on his cheek into a scar. That would have been cool!
omg heathcliff might just enter one of my favourite dolls from you ❤ his expression really catches you, AAAA im in love this is baddd
I LOVE HIMMM
If this isnt Embers bad boy boyfriend i swear XD
yayayayayayyayayaaa yasss yay
When i noticed that big line across his face, i was honestly hoping you'd embrace it and turn it into a scar. Oh well, he looks marvelous regardless! Excellent sculpting job, i thought you used a new doll brand with that thumbnail!
I love last set of paintings/photos with Demon and Banshee! I like to imagine Goat Man and Succubus wanting to have a romantic Halloween date and then their daughter invited her chaotic friends.XDI love the doll, face customization is GREAT, but especialy all little details showing characters personalities!
She could have made the line on the face a scar:0
Can we appreciate how goofy he looked with his mouth just carved and has no teeth
I mean this as a compliment but he looks like those vampires that only got turned into vampires really recently and are just adopting the aesthetic because they finally have the excuse to wear leather jackets with bat motifs
Your concept art is one of my favorite parts of your videos! Your art style is so cute and I love how much personality exudes from the illustration alone!
You should do a spooky scary skeleton next halloween, that would be pretty cool
He's giving me mcr vibes and I love it
Don’t let tumblr get their hands on him 💀
marshell lee
I love this character so much! Something about his looks remind me of Alucard from Hellsing, not sure if it’s wicked grin or just because most vampires have that similar dark brooding look to them though haha
He reminds me of the members of fhe kpop band BOYFRIEND in their Witch video😏
he looks like what my dumbass would choose in an otome game
Love you vid!   He reminded me of Valentine I don't know haha
Dollightful has developed to the point of making doll-sized dental implants. This character is such a perfect blend of scary yet cute! ❤
I love how the doll looks like a Kieran Valentine Redesign  But with “Dolligthful energy”✨
I notice all of the doll customizers on YouTube always shout out others talents (which is so sweet). For example, you commented on how another creator does acrylic nails opposed to you doing paper nails. I shouted at my screen: “GIRL! You just carved out that dolls head and gave him entirely new lips and tongue AND TEETH!” You all have amazing strengths in your fields and the way you work with dolls with creating new parts for them always ALWAYS impresses me.
I love his throughout history portraits, especially the one in the style of Leyendecker looks incredible ❤
I can't get over her maiking tiny doll sized dentures or would they be considered veneers. The point is tiny teeth set with pallete for mouth so cool
I could see him just being a really awkward vampire jokester guy that does finger guns to try to save his jokes
at first i wasn't feeling this doll, that was until YOU PULLED OUT THE NIKE JORDANS OH MY GOODNESS 😭😭😭 I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
I have no idea why but when i saw his face i was immediately reminded of Huening Kai! I love it!!! He’s stunning, as usual when it comes to your dolls Edit: he also reminds me of Heeseung from Enhypen! Enhypen has a very vapire esc style so it probably has to do with that haha😂
“But what about clothes?” Nahhhh
Always my highlight of the season! You never disappoint with a good halloween custom!❤❤
Love the new addition to the halloween family!!  But I will always miss Wendy 🥹 she was one of my favorites
I have such a weak spot for vampires, and you knocked it out of the park with Heathcliff! I adore him and his winsome smirk Edit: omg all the art at the end, that's incredible!! I'm especially fond of the Arrow ad one
Ok I love him but holly frick he would have rocked that Mullet👏
me seeing the final concept art: omg…. joker persona 5  in all seriousness though, the doll looks great in the end!
He reminds me of a love child between Spike and Angel from Buffy❤❤❤
Kathrine you never cease to amaze me. Heathcliff is absolutely fangtastic!
how many times have those gloves been reused? they are just shredded
Rin Okumura and Bakugo's love child
My only issue with this video is how short it is, I kinda wanted to see the process in more detail of both his clothes. Or maybe how he looked with his fist outfit
The face and expression lowkey reminds me of Astarion from BG3 xD
HELP HES SO ME!!!!
With this expression he look like the guy from King the land
He reminds me of Rudolph from and animated little vampire
Maybe for next year she can go for a classic mummy inspired ghoul or a cute scarecrow!
He looks wonderfully sassy and confident, I adore this design!
He stole my heart 😳 just- just take my blood. Its fine. I lived a decent life
I’ve been binging a lot over the past month, and the improvement is insane!! I’m always so in love with your male dolls, what cuties! I haven’t even gotten out of bed yet but I was too excited to watch.
He's really really awesome!!! ❣️🖤♥️
A VAMPIRE! He came out absolutely amazing, I love his poofy hair and cheeky grin, and the teeth look so good. For someone who doesn’t make boy dolls much, they still come out stunning when you do. And the clothes are incredible, so much detail and so striking. The only thing I’d say is maybe adding a bit of a wrinkle to the side of his mouth that’s smirking might make it look a bit more natural? Though for all I know maybe you tried this and it didn’t work. I still love his face so much though, it’s got such personality   Also was that a Lestat reference at the end?
I’m being a vampire for Halloween!
He reminds me of rodrick from diary of the wimpy kid
Oh no! He’s hot! 🥵
I love how all the artwork at the end were in frames except for the new one where he tapped it on the wall instead <33
I really love the hallway scene at the end! seeing his history!! Also that last artwork was really cute :3
I love all the homages to the artists throught time and space! I especailly wasnt expecting that J.C. Leyendecker one!
I always love the Halloween dolls! They just get better every year
It could have been Astarion! 😫
Oh no.. He’s hot!
Love your sculpting skills you're a pro and the face looks good
The art at the end! WOW!
Okay but the Photo Booth images at the end 😂 they seem like such an odd trio of freinds and I love it
Can you make a fnaf inspired doll please? I think it would look great!!!🌠🤞🍀
He turned out so good and very handsome too! Your overall skills have improved yet again, I also love how he looks like a "bad boy" type of vampire. Not many depict vampires as such, which gives him the worthy #OOAK tag!
He really hung Toilet-bound Hanako-kun vibes, I’m kinda loving it 🖤
The dollightful bug has claimed another! I've started trying to customize dolls too now! Maybe someday I can get a vampire boy who looks this good 🧛🏻‍♂️
Not me crying because the pics at the end are so wholesome and sweet
I love that you’ve been playing around more with the expressions of the dolls! It gives them so much personality!
NEVER IN MY LIFE WOULD I HAVE THOUGHT I WOULD BE THIS DOWN BAD FOR A DOLL..
The production was amazing on his presentation! Already one of my faves
Oh my goodness I LOVE all the artwork of him at the end! If these were prints I’d get them all 😱🥰
I always get so excited when you drop a video! You are my favorite doll YouTuber and you inspire me. I love how in most of your projects you try some new way of doing body modifications, the heavily modded projects are my fav to watch over and over 😍
Ah, another piece of joy delivered from my favorite artist!
The line on the face looks like a scar! It makes the smile look more exaggerated and extra spooky. A happy accident if you ask me!
Absolutely looovveee this!
MARK HEATHCLIFF IS THAT U!?-/j          yes I'm a fan of the Mandela catalogue -w-
Was anyone else screaming at the screen for her to paint the mouth parts before inserting them?
I'm sorry if it sounds rude, but He has such a punchable face 😅, that arrogance really came through in the final design.
I love how his expression looks like he thinks he’s super cool, but he’s actually a bit of a dork! Or he should be going AAYYEE like the Fonz!
babe wake up, dollightful is making twinks again
He looks so cool
I’m IN LOVE with the textured hair
Okay I'm shipping him with Ember 😅 Also I love how he have kinda of a storyline through the years 😊(that first portrait resembles a lot with castelvania style 😂😅)
Who else read  " Russian As Fk Grey" ?😂😂😂 Love the doll
holy actual f- he looks hot?! Send help-
HE’S FRIENDS WITH THE OTHERS OMGGG I love him EVEN MORE!! It’s so rare to see male dolls and I always LOVE them in your style!! Awesome job, this made my Halloween!!!
oh my goodness gracious
THE SQUEAL I LET OUT WHEN I SAW THAT THE HALLOWEEN VIDEO IS OUT
I love the shoe choice. He seems like he’d be one of those morally grey characters in a show where he’d first be the villain but eventually help the hero
1. I still miss Wendy! 2. I can imagine him being like Marceline/Marshall Lee from Adventure Time/Fionna and Cake. 3. I love him!
I'm absolutely OBSESSED with all the drawings and paintings in the end montage !
😍👍
That smile is amazing!  He turned out just perfect.  I think using G3 Deuce as the base helps the troublemaker teen aesthetic.  I didn't realize it until now but the G3 boy's proportions really help sell the teenager look.  That jacket is amazing, too bad there's no pattern for it.  I want to make one!  Happy Halloween!
I actually really love the layer line on the face, especially with the mouths design, looks like he has a scar across his cheek that impacts his mouth, which adds a really fun narrative to him. Vampires who have visible references to the long lifespan and what happened throughout that, like Jasper in twilight, are far more interesting than a perfect look to me :)
Now I really want to see someone transform Clawd Wolf. Guess I just gotta be patient lol
I can tell by the thumbnail this is going to be EPIC
I’m obsessed with how his hair almost looks like a goth batnest style
Dawww, what an adorable dude TuT The art in the ending is amazing!
The photoshoot for this particular doll went above and beyond, you brought out all his best features and kept the drama about it!
All the artwork at the end was so cool!!!
14:57 hahah how funny😂 and i love the ending photos of him and ember!! (and banshee haha)
Oh my gosh the art at the end!!! 🤩
This is the most amazing doll Halloween Vampire guy doll I ever seen! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
You named the vampire after Webb a cartoon cats who's also named Heathcliff  I love it
I own a jacket that looks so similar to his that it's insane! xD Love how he turned out ❤
He needs to be in an anime and be a ‘bad guy’ that sometimes helps out cuz that smirk would get me 😍
New skill unlocked!  ✨🦷THE DENTAL🦷✨😬
I love it when it’s Halloween because you post the most beautiful looking dolls ever😭❤️
In a way he reminds me of Marshall Lee from Fiona and cake
I love the fact all the halloween dolls have some sort of connection. Its super cute.
This doll looks like he'd break my heart and I'd be okay with it
I want this jacket IRL. It looks so cool!
Heathcliff you say?  I realize it's supposed to be an old-fashioned and eloquent name, but knowing the comic, all I can think of is that this is a vampire who prefers ham over blood.
Omg, all the art at the end is fantastic!! I would absolutely buy prints of like all of them!
am I the only one that wants to know the Lord between the vampire The Ghost and the demon
How can a doll steal my gender 🥲. I love this doll!! He’s so cool >:3
Katherine you absolutely killed this one! Love everything about him! 🧛
uuuuuuuhhh i want to draw him <3
I need little short comics with the dolls now THEY ARE SO CUTE
yippee new video
Oh wow I love the goofy modern clothes- maybe they could go to his much goofier boyfriend or something?
I don’t know why but the doll reminds me of rin from blue exorcist lol 😂
The smile kinda looks like the main character from Fire force
His mouth is a masterpiece, even more than usual! Really wonderful!
Is it just me or is dolls doll are getting realistic 😮
wow... i am so like NOOO don't ruin a Duce Gorgon... (took me several years to get one (gen1) and everytime see one get destroyed get nervious but this time i'm more than awesomely impressed. You should make him a Frankenstien or creature fro black lagoon style boy (or gurl) friend... no respectful vampire wanders alone! KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK!  congrats onn your return to doll making. You always bring joy to me someone who customized older actionfigures back when it wasn't cute/fun/trendy!
The talent!🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
15/10 on the editing! This is a nee type of halloween skit and i am in love with it!!
Your Halloween and pride dolls are always my favorite! And I'm seeing you strain your airbrush paint makes me feel less crazy for straining out my craft paints (because chunks of dry paint suuuucks)
The dolls you make are amazing and so wonderfully crafted!! I love the art you did of all of them you should totally do a comic of all of them or something it would be cool to so how they reacted with each other like not all the dolls you make but the dolls that make countless cameos lol yknow?? Idk just an idea love your work 💜💚💜💚💜💚
HIGH key Alucard of Hellsing vibes, I love him!
Ooooh i like it, hes cute too 😄
The photos with the pumpkin lights look incredible! And I love his art collection <3 honestly I would do the same if I was a vampire
I wonder if it wouldn't have been easier to paint the mouth pieces before sticking them in the head 😅either way though, he turned out absolutely amazing! He looks like he's be right at home at monster high. I love the little ending skit with him throughout the eras, and the little purikura pictures with the demon and banshee dolls!
Ok but he’s kinda hot
LOVE HIM ALREADY
I would wear the fuck out of that outfit omfg.... I might need to try recreating the jacket in human scale for an ouji look.
Love him! Might try something like this with my deuce! He is just collecting dust now.
Anyone else hoping for some Heathcliff x Ember 😂
It is with my deepest apologies to admit I am 100% down bad for Heathcliff I love his dumb little smirk
Perfect!  So glad to see a video from you!  And 'cause I can't resist: Vampire Rock Star  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I9jiXC9ANI&ab_channel=kamijoofficial  Enjoy!
*cries in goth* I wanna make this coat so badly, but the next best thing is adding a bat decal to the back of my jacket lol.
I wonder why she didnt paint the teeth before putting them in like she did with the banshee🤔
That line on his face looks like a scar, and makes him a bit more dashing.
ahhhh he’s so cute i love arrogant fashionable vampires
OH NO HE'S HOT
Why does he almost look like Bakugo Katsuki to me?!😂😂😂😂
I am totally making this outfit for myself
Love him! Also calling out Barb got me😂
13:04 was so perfect it was like he was saying “Eh? Eh? The shoes work so well on my fit right?” 😂❤
Idk if it’s feasible, but I’d love to see trans dolls. Like, using a male base, giving her boobies and long hair. Or a female base, give him top surgery and maybe more muscle and a stronger jawline
I love your videos 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I hope Heathcliff gets to hang out with the werewolf. It’s funny to think they have the same hair
Pretty boy vampire ‼️
I absolutely LOVE this doll!! But you can definitely see the difference in shoes from the little logo on the tongue unfortunately
damn, the first time I'm early to the video.
THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS!!! THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS!!! 16:59
You should do a zombie!!!!!!!!! (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)
he looks fruity     arent all vampires fruity lmao
I LOVE HIS FRESH KICKS. I don’t know why but they just complete the look
I'm simping for Heathcliff
Love him!!!! Also just like a small idea🤏 you should give him a little sister😢 i think it would be very precious but just an idea you dont need to obv.
I've been watching your channel for quite a few years and your Halloween videos are always amazing! I really enjoyed this one! :D
Loosing my mind over how much he looks like Staz from Blood Lad, a fellow vamp Incredible work as always!
A MAN?!
TUBERCULOSIS
Those photos of him with Ember and the Banshee at the end were SO ADORABLE
the drawings at the end of him and his spooky friends 🥺 so adorable
I love seeing how far you've come with your art this looks amazing. You get better every doll
THE LITTLE SET PIECES AT THE END MY GOD!!!!
Plot twist: he's Ember's boyfriend.
The entire time I was designing my Halloween costume (a deer-like nature spirit) I tried to think like Katherine does. "No I can't use green leaves because they would disappear into my green dress. How about I paint them all in fall tones? This would look nice, and could show an embracing of the cycle of life and death in nature."   "Should I put these gems on my face? No, with all the eye makeup and the white deer spots, my face would look too busy."   "Should I use this short wig or the long one? The long one's bangs cover my eyes, and would make all the time and effort of the makeup a waste, so I guess the long one. A blonde and brown hairstyle lends itself to the diversity of nature anyway."
I love him so much! You did a great job!
whys he kindaaaaa...like why do i wanna read a cliché wattpad story about him😩
eeeee I absolutely love him!!! you perfectly captured that cool/cheeky anime boy vibe with his outfit and face-up. And oh my goodness the little end sequence was pure perfection from start to finish! 🖤❤ probably my new favourite halloween doll of yours 💕
I love how he's turned out!!!
I love him 👁️👁️❤️
Goatman: Who is this smiley idiot Amber keeps bringing around Zura: ...Might be her boyfriend, she hasn't told us yet. Goatman: I should kill him. Zura: Darling the whole point of vampires is that you can't kill them.
slayed
Though im an hour late im sure this vid will be great and though vampires are flexible they can also become cringe at points so im excited to see how you tackle it .  P.s the open mouth and teeth were a nice touch especially bc I've never seen it in humanoid dolls!  P.p.s ill update u once im completely done with this!       P.p.p.s I finished it and am in love the cartoons shoes were truly better especially bc the previous shoes showed the green part of it and the artwork for him through the centuries is beautiful . I can see all the hardwork put into this vid thank you for making this vid for us !😊
This is incredible!! My favorite Halloween doll yet!
"Dead white" "Russian AF Grey"
AWW HES SO CUTEE 😭😭 I always look forward to the Halloween series it’s my favorite out of them all!! You always do such a good job and this years doll did not disappoint 🩷🩷
Anyone else wonder how Dollightful would tackle doing a Frankenstein?
that photoshoot is so cute!!! i love your halloween dolls
Idk why but he has the same vibe as Jack Frost from rise of the guardians but more evil and emo? Idk lol
Looking at him head-on he looks a little friendly, which could make people approach him out of curiosity. But I love how he turned out!
Okay but it can't just be me thinking his hair looks like Bakugous from mha  I probably spelled his name wrong tbh
This might me one of my favorite face ups on the channel!! I really love how the eyes look, and of course that GRIN! Such a fun, dynamic expression
He looks like a cute and sassy vampire boy straight out of a BL manga 😅.... I loved it
I love this doll so much! It’s amazing and I may or may not have a fictional crush on it 😅
The next Halloween doll should be Ember’s little brother!!!
Omg I love this!! He’s so cute but definitely still had the vampire vibe. His smirk is so creative as well! When you started cutting the face I was getting nervous 😭 but it turned out so weak and is almost exactly like the concept art!
I love your vampire doll that you made!! Also I was thinking if you can make a gremlins doll? In case if you don't know what a gremlin is there little mischievous and trouble maker monsters that were mogwai from the movie gremlins 1 and 2,and there a 3 rules to them don't shine at them with light especially sunlight or else they will die, 2 don't put them in water or else they would multiple, and 3 the most important rule of them all DON'T FEED THEM AFTER MIDNIGHT! I also think it would be cool if the gremlin doll would non binary or gender fluid 😁😁
I wish there was a second like button because one isn't enough❤❤❤
smash, i mean smash, i mean smash, i mean- wait hold old is he ._. he's such a pretty boy tho. He would catcall by telling them they could fold a fitted sheet.
I was literally just thinking how I was hoping Katherine would make another guy doll and/or a dark alt doll, and we got both in one video. He looks SO good omg. The teeth are so cool
Now the goatman isn’t the only man in the group :D
OH MY GOODNESS I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!  Also, I've been wanting to say: I watch your videos all the time with my little sisters, they love them all so much and we've rewatched your dragon series about five times!
those additional illustrations of him through the ages at the end is SO CUTE A DETAIL, i love your videos so much every single time
Heath's just giving me the GenderBent Marceline Vampire Queen vibes with the hair, skintone and smirk!  Maybe he could be Marceline's brother in an AU universe, if that's possible... But I really love how he turned out! ^^
The Nike Symbol is two different colors that’s funny
I LOVE HIM!!!❤️‍🔥🧛
I think this is my favorite face up!!!!!! Heathcliffe is awesome
I hate cute boy vampires mostly (i REALLLLy hate twilight) but i actuallly like this a lot!!
YO WHY DO I KINDA SHIP EMBER AND HEATHCLIFF, THOUGH????? 👀👀👀👀
Now give him a bf
I miss wendigo :(
heads up, no romanian boy would ever look this good coming from a romanian girl LOOL i love your dolls so much! you've inspired me to start customising my own :)
Watched this when I'm supposed to be asleep, totally worth it
I love this doll and the unique facial expression !!
okay but can we take a moment for THAT concept art bc damn, miss maam can also be a manhwa illustrator T_T
He looks like he is playfully up to something. I love Heathcliff's outfit and that smirk! Holy cow, that gallery of paintings at the end in varying art styles was chef's kiss!!!! Happy Halloween, Dollightful!
May i ask; why not paint the teeth and tongue before glueing them in the head? Anyway, lovely costume as always!! Missed dollightfull so much!
I think the smirk is equally funny and scary. When you see him from far away with the red eyes showing under the black hair, it looks like an evil grin. But closer it's a kind of awkward but indearing side smile. 😂 He looks great and I can imagine him goofing around with his other spooky friends.
HE LOOKS LIKE A DREAMWORKS BOY
what if ember and heathcliff are dating that would be so cute
Next should be a zombie and i love your videos :3
I must be honest, I miss the wendigo. Doesn’t feel like the full cast without them. I know why you don’t include them and took down the video, but man that doll was cool, ignoring anything mythological. It’s been one of my favourites since I found your channel, back when that doll was (fairly) new.
am i simping for a doll rn 😂😂
Im screamjng with how cute the pictures at the end were 😭💜 we need to have a whole video just explaining everyoned relationship to each other 👀 whos friends who doesnt get along with who etc 👀
ahh he looks so good!!
Dollightful representing the entire crafting community by saying, "I don't have a pattern, but I believe in myself and I can make it work".
Okay I really do love this doll but the smirk… I mean, don’t get me wrong it probably took a long while to sculpt, but I just feel as if it doesn’t work for me. Tbh I don’t know crap about doll customization but I feel the smirk extends a bit too wide. I can understand if you guys like it but it doesn’t work for me. Great doll despite it!
he's so ADORABLE i'm sobbing. i didn't realize it, but the spooky dolls absolutely needed a edgy cute anime boy in the lineup. his smirk!!! is so cool!!!!!!
BABE! WAKE UP! DOLLIGHTFUL POSTED
Aww I love it
SMASH,next one
I love him! Reminds me of Tom Hiddleston’s vampire character in Only Lovers Left Alive
Aww he’s so cute ❤
Ah both the outfis you made are adorable!! Always love your videos i go crazy whenever you upload HDHD Possibly you can make a doll for the unused outfit? Idk sounds like something you'd do
Love Heathcliffs design the bat on his jacket looks like a lil kid did it cuz it matches him like a younger him or a lil sister
I LOVE HIIIMMMMMM
he’s a cutieeeee! that smile is so devilish, love the 3D!
I love the design and how it turned out✨✨✨✨
Now we need a zombie lol
I feel like Heathcliff is such a mysterious bad-boy vampire name, I LOVE IT!!
hi, can you please  make futtakuchi onna from japanese folklore next year?
Nah why he kind uh 😏
I think you could've leaned into the line on his face and gave him a scar- who doesn't love a sexy scar? But you don't see it anyway! He looks AMAZING!!
Ngl I was lowkey disappointed that it wasn't a sexy vampire lady but tbh Heathcliff has stolen my heart ❤️ also I'm so bummed you didn't go with the modern biker jacket with flight tags bc I'm all about that aesthetic lol maybe I've been watching too much Tokyo Revengers!
AAA IVE MISSED U AND UR DOLLS
I will say, I miss seeing Wendy in the background, and going back to rewatch her video 😭 Though seeing you repaint more and more dolls does bring me joy :>  Oh, also! I adore the little paintings and such! They're such a great detail
Katherine, your work is fantastic! you leave me speechless every time i see your videos! i swear every few months i come back to this channel and get inspired to make dolls all over again!! ❤
I love his design! He reminds me so much of what I used to love about monster high (specifically Draculaura), combining classic Victorian clothing pieces with modern street fashion and giving the whole thing EDGE! I‘m in love with your vampire boy!
The art at the end WAS SO GOOD OMGGG
you’re so talented. i love you and your content so much
I think the shoes look just right. They might be bigger than the feet but they balance out the head.
It's nice to know that this snarky vampire has the same name as my fat orange cat-
So over the years Dollightful’s given us Flame Daughter, Goat Dad & Hot Mom, Cannibalism-is-In-Fact-Still-Bad-When-Brown-Folks-Do-It, Screaming Lady With the Best Reactions, Bad Dog, Little Witch and Her Birb, and now Pretty Boy Vampire. Someone make them a movie!!!
I feel the g3 molds are really matching your artstyle. He turned out great. Especially the expression 🖤💖
He's like a teenage modern vampire that wants to stick to tradition but can't help but wear the latest style
Oh my GOODNESS the TEETH!! HOW do you manage to work so tiny and make it come out so good?!?!?! Even zoomed really close it looks amazing! I was so nervous when you started cutting the mouth but you did AMAZING!!
Me and my sister love your videos, I'm currently sick and this video made my day. Thank you Dollightful! Your creations are SoUl-CaTcHiNg!  (That was horrible I'm sorry 😭)
Love that toothy smile!!!! Awesome
EVERYBODY STOP WHAT THEY’RE DOING DOLLIGHTFUL POSTED
Vampires are one of my favorite classic fictional monster's and. I love the mix of classy and punk in this one!
He's so cute T^T The mouth is amazing!! <33333
Not me shipping Ember and Heathcliff together! Vampires are my absolute favorite!! You really made my day🥹💕
My only criticism is that his fangs aren't as long and sharp as expected when you think about vampires but a great doll nonetheless. I love his expression! ❤
i love seeing your Halloween characters every year!! i hope the airbrush is giving you less grief 🤞
And now he is my new husbando
We love to see the skyrim art in your inspo.
the ending sequence was super cool! all the different styles of paintings and the beautiful 3d animation is really admirable <3 happy halloween 🦇
He's giving such mid-late 2000's vibes and I love and hate it. My teenage emo years are screaming back at me xD
Oomg hes hot
I’m obsessed with the vampire examples including Nosferatu, Blade, Edward Cullen, and Count Von Count
Heathcliff is my favourite You did so well!!❤
Why didn't you paint the teeth before putting them into the doll?
Aww he's so precious!!❤ It's interesting how the huge monster high head puts his vibe a little more on the cute side while your concept art is more on the cool side. Such a great doll, you can't go wrong with a cheeky vampire boy😈
I KNEW HED BE BESTIES WITH EMBER!!  Glad to see the Banshee (does she have a name?) in the friend group as well.  Hopefully next year we get a Korean   folk lore inspired doll?
Omg he is AMAZING! I love how you did the face the hair!!! You make hair styling look so easy, I may have to try your technique in how to do that short hair, looks AMAZING!!! He’s by far my fave that SMILE THE NAILS!!! He is so AMAZING!!!! ❤
I absolutely love Heathcliff!
Omg he’s soooooo cool I love him. He needs a zombie boyfriend like right now
aww i love him! he's definitely my favorite male doll you've made thus far <3 happy Halloween!
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH 🦇❤️
13:04 😭😭😭 hes giving 'where my hug at?' LMAOOOOOOO
Why is he low key kinda hot tho 🗿
LOVE ITTTT
May I ask-  One of theses days can we get a boy character in a dress🥺
Headcanon: he's amber boy friend
I love him so much 😭😭😭
I love him!!!!! It's great to have another masculine Halloween doll. The doll dentures are so funny, but they really turned out incredible! His face is so lively in the photos. He is very pale but I think it works-- being washed out by black happens to real goths, too 😂. I'm sure he thinks it looks cool. Also I love the art you make to support their backstories. It's so much work but obviously a labor of love
OK but the white outfit on the "portrait"??? Hello?!?!?! What a wonderful doll! Again a masterpiece
When I saw the thumbnail I thought it must have been an illustration, he looks so good!
Heathcliff the vampire looks cool and awesome his outfit kinda reminds of a what vampire character would look like in anime or what K-pop idol would wear on Halloween
Hello Sailor!!
The subtle bat on his back is his Clan's symbol, he told me himself.
He looks like Black parade chemical romance, to lost boys vampires to Edward Cullen 😍❤️
I can see the werewolf and Heathcliff getting into trouble since they’re said to be enemies
Okay but the combination of classic vampire ascetic and modern punk/goth vibes is immaculate. I feel like ancient vampires are played up to be these stuffy- stuck in their way characters - but if vampires are supposed to be apex predators they need to be able to adapt! Blend in. And all that jazz. A wonderful character! And I love the clip of him walk down the hall of many pictures! ❤❤❤
I'm sorry, but is anybody else seeing Hiccup cosplaying as a vampire? XD
OH MY GOD I LOVE HIMMMMMM!!!! 10/10 need a show about Heathcliff’s adventures. 😂💙
Honestly, Heathcliff feels like a mix of Staz from blood lad, Conte Dracula from Dracula 2000, Lestat from Queen of the Damned, and Rudolph from the 2017 animated version of the little vampire
The hair ended up great, but I almost wished you kept it that shaggy 80s cut it originally was. Reminded me of David Bowie as the goblin king in Labyrinth. RIP glampire
I love him, he looks like he'd be a tries-to-be-serious villain from an awesome cartoon but actually is kinda goofy and dorky and helps the heroes in the end (I adore him) 💅✨
This was at the top of my fyp, i’m so pumped for another dolightful vid!!
i would love to see your take on a zombie character!
I absolutley love all of the dolls you make!! their so creative. i myself am trying to customize a clawdeen for halloween!
I love him so much! Another great video 🦇 He really reminds me of Marshal Lee from Adventure Time and I imagine that Heathcliff plays bass just like him lol
Those portraits were so good! Also, love that Tsura and the Goatman were holding hands lol.
Oooh he looks like a real f[udge]boy... I wonder what Ember's parents think of him! :3 (*GoatDad voice*: "you're a thousand years too young to hang out with the likes of him!")
I’m begging you to make a baba yaga grandma for the demon family!
Oh my gosh he's amazing ^^ that smirk gives him cool but annoying older brother vibes xD with the outfit you made you should give him a little dorky brother xD   So happy to see the G3 Deuce get some love, the face sculpt is so sweet and gorgeous ❤
I love your holloween customs
He looks a bit like Hueningkai from TXT
OMGG He and ember would be such a cute couple! The loreee !!
i love at the end how the succubus, i think thats what she is, and the skull demon dad are looking at one another XD  like their having a conversation about their daughter ebign friends with a vampire XD
Gave him the most Trans man name and vibe 🤣
I love all your creations! I would love to see you make a pastel Frankenstein or zombie girl! I think it would be cute and spooky and right up your alley!
He looks great. Thank you for sharing your video. 👍💖
you made him so hot you can’t keep doing this to me katherine 😭😭
Goodness his expression is just immaculate!!!!
I think he would’ve looked soo cool with like one of those modern mullet hairstyles! I still like the hair but it feels almost a little too generic for this eccentric cool vampire guy. Also I think that crack in the face looks pretty cool. It’s almost like a scar from fighting or something?
I can't get over his grin! He's perfect!
One hour gang  👇🏽
The big face crack, you ckuld have 100% emphasized that as a scar from a battle with a hunter and I would have been all for it.   Could also add lore. Maybe vampires healing abilities can only work so far. Maybe the hunter blessed their blade with garlic and holy water. That way the scar was more permenate.
I love how smug he looks it’s delightful
Anyone else absolutely IN LOVE with his cheeky smile😂❤
"Geez,* BARB!*" Got me. Gave me a nice chuckle. Love the doll, especially the teeth! Great video to start the day off with a spooky vibe.
*Hes so cute! And handsome* ✨❤  He could totally be someone’s boyfriend.. ^COUGH COUGH^ Ember ^COUGH COUgh^   Like he looks like a tough guy but he’s a cheeky dude who loves strawberries 🍓
We're you inspired by Clive from ff16?
I think Heathcliff should date the werewolf doll in that classic enemies to lovers trope
I LOVE HIM!!! i adore the complicated monsterous dolls a lot but im a sucker for bishies haha. im all for a vampire prettyboy
Okay, but you make some really good stop motion stuff to! It's really impressive.
Heatcliff looks like a prankster that just goes around his family home leaving traps and pranks everywhere 😂
1 hour after post , im Comment 271
HES SO CUTE 😭😭 the drawing of him and the girls at the end is soooooo cuuuuute 🥹🥹🥹
He looks like a Gorillaz character in the beginning there lol
He looks like the vampire from the anime blood lad!
I love him! When you first cut into his face I was like 😨 but it turned out so great!
I recommend using hot glue for future doll manicures! HeXtian uses this technique and not only does it look life like, but kinda cartoony as well? Hope that helps💗
I want his jacket. Its so amazing.
I AM SIMPING SO HARD RIGHT NOW
WAKE UP BABE DOLLIGHTFUL HALLOWEEN VIDEO DROPPED
You could make a Venus flytrap boy so you can use those pants with the spikes
using grey for his eyes was such a great touch. u can really get kind of an evil vibe from his stare with the difference between his dark eyes and the pure white highlight :)
can you make a harry potter themed doll
7:36  .... It kinda looks like a scar...
With the other clothes you could make him like a younger brother
Girl u need new pencils omg they're so small lmao 😂
Next Halloween you should make him a boyfriend
15:20 this shot reminds me of a movie where the vampire appears really high up and says something sinister, then either jumps down or teleports to the center of the crowd of onlookers
why does he look like huening kai on the thumbnail tho 😭
HE LOOKS SO ZESTY OMG I LOVE HIM
always a joy to see another cute anime boy custom ☺️
You dear are one of the best doll customizers on YouTube. Your gift and eye for detail and customization that is all your own is amazing. Happy Halloween and ty for being YOU ❤
1:09 I'm sorry, he just reminds me so much of Cardan from The Cruel Prince book-
7:40 don't worry it just looks like a super cool scar!
I like the new ending screen style
He looks like me at the dentist when theyre jabbing my teeth at the back 😂
He's DEFINITELY constantly flirting with Ember while her dad looks threateningly in the background
I think at this point Katherine is creating her own Monster High lineup with her Halloween dolls and I love it.
A most Happy Halloween to the whole Dollightful family.
i love the massive amount of effort you go through for the absolutely adorable backstories and small details! another lovely video! i loved the ending so much!
Omg he’s a Leyendecker model!!! My headcanon is that he’s bisexual :3
he looks like a webtoon character its PERFECTTTTT <3
He is handsome as hell 😊
He looks so good!! I love all the art of him through the years!
First it was Tatsuo, now it’s Heathcliff… why am i attracted to dolls?
this fits right on time with my astarion obsession (baldur's gate 3) <3 thank you for another awesome video!!
I LOVE this look.. I want his outfit so bad!  He kinda reminds me of Gortash from Baldurs gate 3!
Friendly, Seductive, and Sinister are all qualities I’d want in a man❤
He’s a cute patootie 🫡🤭
hi can you do slipknot dolls 🥺
he looks like cameron boyce  R.I.P <3
NOOO THE BOWIE POOF! you totally should have kept it, it’s just too much lol  Edit: oh noooi just realized he’s making the troll face!!
Something about his smile is so dorky and cute like he’s trying to be edgy like his older brother or something and I absolutely love it
You say Heathcliff  I say Marshall Lee's Teen cousin! Love the 3d elements! Would love to see more designs like this!❤
I've been waiting for thisssssssss
i hate the teeth so much though their so crooked
I feel like painting the teeth and tongue before placing it in the mouth then covering it with paper or putty while spraying would have been easier. Regardless this doll is amazing
I dont know aboul dolls but i know in aircraft painting you use a one part paint with one part liquid to thin it (like my composite class we used a polyurethane paint then thin it down with acetone) put it in an air gun, use a fan shape instead of just shooting out. Then we just put coats on until its pigmented.
I... he reminds me a lot of Kuzuha, a japanese vampire vtuber. Is it the smirk, the cool kicks, the unorthodox fashion?! nah it's the black nails lmfao
0:45 That is so so true my favourite interpretation of vampires is that they are losers!!! i urge anyone reading this comment to watch both the movie and tv series called what we do in the shadows its so funny!!!
With the wavy hair texture, he honestly reminds me of Muzan from Demon Slayer 😅
Omg the portraits and art at the end were amazing! Did you draw all of them yourself?? I love how they showcase the different time periods, and the modern one definitely gave off Photo Booth vibes ❤
The discarded pants with spikes down the sides makes me really want to see you make a cute Dino doll! Amazing video!
Looks amazing like always 🎉
Just wow. I mean the concept had so much life in and the doll has a crazy amount of personality. That’s how you can tell you are a true artist at this craft. Well done, well done. 👏🏻
Something about the hair and face makes this doll look like a vampire version of Rodrick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid (as in the movie adaptation from 2010) to me. Not necessarily a bad thing, though? :D
It hadn’t even occurred to be that you haven’t done a vampire doll til now! He came out looking AMAZING!!! ❤❤❤❤
New vampiric twink just dropped.
1 hour gang :)
He looks so cute! I know you were going for scary, but I just look at that smile! It screams to me awkward teenager who’s maybe a bit misguided and takes on a golden gaurd like position in regards to Dracula (if you get the owl house reference)
Not finished, but I hope that big line on his face becomes a scar! It would be so perfect for an edgy but classy anime pretty boy scar
AHHHHH NEW VIDEOOOO
Didn't know you could have a crush on a doll, but here i am!
The grip that dollightful men have on me is strong.  I havent had a crush on your custom since tatsuo... now heathcliff ❤❤❤
He look like a teenager version of  Alucard from Hellings 😅😆
YESSS WHAT??🫶🏾🫶🏾 the growing confidence on your sculpts is so wonderful to see! new crush!😭😭
I’m literally obsessed with this doll omg!! You’ve outdone yourself this time!! ❤❤❤❤
He should be Embers boyfriend or some sort of relative/family member also that scar on his face could be a vain or something
Love it. You should definitely give him a wife/girlfriend
I love your videos man!!! Keep up the great work. I recently rediscovered your channel after not watching for a few years and you have been busy!!!! As an aspiring creative your videos always bring me so much joy and leave me I spread to try out a new medium while I still try to find my niche. Lately I’ve been getting really into the digital art world and you have been one of the main contributing factors of that, as you always motivate me to keep on trying. I love drawing but hate the messy aspects of it and digital art is a wonderful compromise. Anyway just thought I’d share. I love your videos dollightful!!!!
He looks like such a little shit lol. I love him
I NEED the jacket pattern ngl I to make it for myself
Oh no he's hot ;-;
Even if the line on his face was really noticeable on the final look, it could be made into a facial feature like a scar from a blessed blade or a really strange birth mark
It's always a good day when a new Dollightful video drops! 🎉🎉🎉
🫣😳😳 why is he hot
He looks like lucas from that one kpop group
He is sooooo cool! The shoes truly take him away from the stereotypical vampiric lord and right into it boy fashion icon and I love it for him!
Not me watching the view count going up
His eyes and smirk reminds me of Alucard from Hellsing. Maybe an unintentional inspiration, perhaps?
I hate to say it but I think he's cute.
Is it wrong to say "would"
You really managed to hit every one of my weaknesses with this doll 😅 Physically impossible for me not to love him ❤️
HES SO SILLY I LOVE HIM AND HUS CHEEKY LIL FACE
Heatcliff turned out fantastic, Totally in love with how he turned out, Happy Halloween my friend 😘😍❤🖤🤍
Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry. Daddy? Sorry.
YAAASSS A VAMPIREEE
Omg… can the devil girl ( I’m so sorry I can’t remember her name) be like… a thing?!?! 😮 also love ur vids x ❤
The doll looks super awesome! I may have not been a big fan of his smirk at first, but I feel it growing on me. And may I just say- Those end pictures of Heathcliff, the Banshee and Amber are GOLDEN! I love that they're friends and could even see Amber and Heathcliff be a couple or a poly with Banshee. They just have those *vibes*, y'know? But being besties is just as great, only more platonic than romantic :)
you should make the peel on his face a scar, it'd be super cool lol
I love all your illustrations at the end there! They’re so beautiful, I especially love the white tuxedo one, so beautiful🤍
OKAY BUT THE PORTRAITS AT THE END ARE SO COOL 100/10
One day I’d like to make a vampire doll with the same style as Felix from Argopro, you’ve given me motivation to! Hes very cool.
OMG FINALLY
Usually people who mostly do one gender or aesthetic of art suck at the other (ex: me XD I draw feminine mostly so masculine is harder) but she straight up nailed the more masculine aspects as per usual !
I think I’m in love with Heathcliff.
I love your Halloween dolls and vampires are one of my favorite monsters. Thank you for sharing.
Happy Halloween!! It's always a treat when you can the pretty boys hehe! watching the halloween dolls on screen made me realize i have watched each one's creation.. that's a lot of halloweens! how fun!!
He reminds me of a cool vampire from Adventure Time. Like he could be one of Marceline's friends
oh no he's hot
Lol I love the idea of Heathcliff, Ember, and the Banshee getting into all kinds of trouble together, Ember fr needs an angel girlfriend tho
Omfg I absolutely ADORE him!! 😍💕💕💕
You should definitely keep the outfit pieces, that were for the modern outfit, and maybe next year you could make a younger brother for Heathcliff, who is all about being cute.
Really loved the upside down pic! Amazing job on the mouth!
AAAA I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ILYSM❤
is there something wrong with me if I find a doll kinda hot? asking for a friend ofc
Aw!! I loved the photobooth art at the end! Did you draw that yourself or was it fanart?
Anyone else think this guy would have a cockney accent I love him either way when you said cute boy esthetic I was so happy to see it for the vampire
he kinda pretty boy now that im looking at him
He looks so cool. The classy coat paired with the nike sneakers is hilarious
Amazing work he looks frightening
I ASKED FOR A VAMPIRE AND I GOT ONE IM SOO HAPPYYYYY
If anything the line on his face looks like a cool scar XD still not that noticeable so I’m not mad about it lol
mf thinks everythings a game
I absolutely love him! And I think the coat was a good choice, because... er, the first trio of modern costumes? Kinda made him look like a Vampire Sora from Kingdom Hearts...
Heathcliff sumg smirk caught me off guard i thought his jaw was off then i watch the vid and i realise and had a better look my eyes are trash after starring at the sun for so long. But i won the starring contest the sun go out
he is like jack frost but spookier
I always wait for the skit every year🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
I'm so glad you're back!!! You are my favorite doll customizer, I am so happy you're posting again! Hope the family is well, thank you for taking the time to make dolls and share them with us!
Love the name, even more if it’s because you’ve read Wuthering Heights ❤️❤️
I really love this concept on this doll, looks so classic and modern at the same time, and your sculpting on dolls always get me its so good to see, Happy Halloween! 🎃💜💜
the spiky sweatpants could do for pajamas
He gives me twilight meets Lost Boys vibes. In a good way.
Looks like Ember got a new bf!
I can’t wait to see the next doll for Halloween already also I love the way he looks
the concept art? amazing the doll? immaculate the timeline art? in love am I thoroughly impressed?: yes Hotel? Trivago
I like how he looks, but his smile looks off  I think the eyebrows should have been angled more/ one of the eyes should have been squinted. Without that, it looks like he has a disfigurement (which isn’t bad, just not what I think you were going for 😂)
Ah I love him! He came out soooo good !! ☺️
THIS MAN??? GEEZE 😋😍😍😍
The final pics with the underlighting looks so GOOD, this is my fave boydoll you have made so far!!
Doll customizing is the one craft that scares me to death! Idk how she does it! Especially the sewing part!
OMG AMAZING
There's been a sudden influx of vampire content in my life this past year, but I really can't be mad about it :D
Yep, I totally ship Ember and Heathcliff now. Personal headcanon I imagine Banshee introduced them to each other.
This is super cool, but it's downright bizarre that you didn't paint the mouth before inserting. It really suffered because of it.
I absolutely adore him! The thought of an ancient vampire wearing Nike’s is hilarious but it totally works for him.   Also the name Heathcliff makes me think of the cat, so head canon that he has a cat familiar that’s been his one true companion throughout his undead life.
omg i love him! He's definitely my favorite you've ever made
This doll hit so many design details I love as a vampire girlie! I had a vampire boy oc back in middle school who also had a jacket with three buckles across the chest (because Aesthetic) so when I saw that same detail, I got so excited! I also REALLY loved all the artwork at the end, the JC Leyendecker-style advert will now be living rent free in my brain. Fantastic work as always!
Kathrine omg this boy is so amazing! He is such a heartthrob!!! My gosh I love the modern mix of hot and classic! And my gosh why do you not post your concept art and other art? Your art is just so beautiful as your doll customization work 😭💕   If there was a doll universe I swear all your dolls living around would be so fun!
Holy crap he looks so cool,❤ i loved the little story you did for him in the form of those photos brillianr job have a happy halloween with your little one
Is he gonna be friends with Lilith?
You could have made that long line on his face into a scar to make it look deliberate
I already love him so much, he's giving me hardcore gender envy
Obsessed with the cute group photo he taped on the wall
I love this doll! Is it bad that halfway into the vid I was like "Him and Ember dating tho. Ooooooo Papa Goatman, what would he think?"? XD
I love vampire boys. He is gorgeous.
He's awesome! I can totally imagine him hanging out with Ember and Goatman giving him the "I'm watching you" gesture while Zura's back is turned.
emo boyyyy i love him
Could you try making a doll for the outfit you didn’t end up using, because it’s a really cool outfit
i always see a cute design she could’ve used but she always uses a different design 😢
Omg you know what? He made me think of Litten, probably because of his style and colour-scheme. Her turned out equally as cool!! Happy Halloween 🖤
The concept art is hmmmhhh 🤌🤌🤌
50 minutes ago! He looks so good!!! Never fails to provide such gorgeous dolls
Ok now it's a true Halloween season, he look absolutely fangtastic I LOVE HIM 🤩 always a great job, and the ripped off paint on his face actually give the impression off each sides off his mouth can extand for bitting his prey, happy accident 😍really beautifull design
Also, can we take a minute to recognize all the art Katherine made of Heathcliff through the ages at the end?!?! Masterpieces, every one of them. And how cool that we know so much more about his long life because of that?? He was a model at one point, for goodness sakes!
If you'd left him with the long hair you would've just ended up with a doll of The Crow which would also be sufficiently spooky.
i may or may not have a crush on Heathcliff...  anyways he turned out amazing!! great job once again!
TO DIE FOR!!!
I miss the wendigo doll 😞 Ik why it was taken out but stilllll it looked so cool 😭
Ohhhhh I love those three as friends! Banshee looks so cute in those pictures!
I love him so so so much! Vampires have always been a secret love of mine (okay not so secret...). I loved to read mythology, folklore, urban legends, all that good stuff as a child, but when I found vampires man that was it. How could I not adore creepy yet alluring vampires! They will forever be my favorite monsters! Ahem, so when I saw the thumbnail and Heathcliff's cheeky but sharp grin I squealed out loud! I've always been amazed at how well you could replicate your own handdrawn art into a 3d model! And Heathcliff looks exactly like his drawing! I absolutely adore his mouth! Thank you so much for this video!
Obsessed with how you didn’t paint his legs because we’d never see them but made absolutely sure to give him nipples 😂
I love your work so much
His name's Heathcliff and I pun it for a Halloween vibe and make it Deathcliff cuz I can
Oh ny gosh, he should get a vampire hunter companion next year. Every good Dracula needs a Abraham Van Helsing after all. Or if you want to be more broad, a demon hunter because of all the spooky people in the Halloween crew.
I loved the doll and I REALLY loved the modern jacket design we didn’t get but maybe anoth time :)
As an artist and art student myself, I absolutely ADORE all the references in the ending skit. You're an absolute idol to me, Doll! ❤
so halloweeny
That little 'photoshoot' with the others at the end- that's sooo cute!!
Dude looks amazing :)
7:49 I actually like the faint marking on his face, it kinda looks like old battle scar or something like that. Have been waiting for the Halloween doll video, which was a pleasant surprise after watching a horror movie earlier today to get into the spooky vibe to see your video to pop up :3
I’d like to propose to heathcliff bar. He’s so awesome!,!!!!!! Fabulous job as always
He pretty different from your other dolls in my opinion, maybe he looks more anime, like really indulged anime aesthetic for him, but I’m a sucker for pretty anime boys so I love that for him lolz  Happy Halloween❤️❤️❤️❤️
his face up really reminds me of ban from the seven deadly sins
I love him so much!!
MARSHALL LEE?!
Do you still have Wendy
I can just imagine him being good friends with Kay Wren.
The choice to use grey for the sclera was SO CLEVER. It really gave him the right shadowy figure vibe. That's one of my favorite things about your work - the little choices and details that seem simple enough in isolation, but when put together give your dolls so much depth.
Someone else commented about astarion and vampires, and honestly I i completely relate lol
I feel like I've been waiting so loooong.
The shot of him hanging from the lamp got me good! AWESOME job!
I feel like people are going to ship Heathcliff and Amber together, but that’s probably cuz he’s the only male Halloween doll you made that’s a guy besides Amber’s dad-
Heathcliff could have a younger sibling who wears the other outfit because they don't want to scare any friends they want to make.
he turned out so cool  now i'm off to draw my own vampire oc XD
Edward Cullen who? I only know Heathcliff as my teenage vampire boy! Btw why didn't you paint the teeth before you glued them down? Would've made the whole painting process easier :D
He might have a fan club after this 😂. He is so cool. Nice work.
This is giving Vampire knight😳❤️ badass
I am forever in awe at this woman’s talent
He looks so cheeky, I love it!
I actually love how the crack on his face kind of looks like a scar. It's as if his victims fought back while he was trying to drink their blood and now he's got a battle scar and a lopsided smile.
He's so cute!!!!! I adore him! Edit! THAT ENDING SEQUENCE OH MY LORD THAT IS ADORABLE.
Omg I love him! He’s so cute and that grin is adorable! 10000/10 definitely a new favorite doll of mine
HES HOT OMG NICE WORK!
OUR QUEEN POSTED HORRAYYYY
the little tea ball / mini tea strainer thingy-ma-bob over the airbrush cup is genius! 🤯 i’m totally going to try that out
Spooky season truly hasn’t started until dollightful posts ❤️❤️
he reminds me of corpse husband?? its the hair i think!
AH!  IVE WAITED ALL YEAR FOR THIS!! HAPPY SPOOPY MONTH EVERYONE!
I absolutely love him AAH!! 10/10 would let him drink my blood  also the illustrations at the end look so amazing!! the last one is so cute too!
first vampire on the channel?! amazing!
He remind me of Rudolph on little vampire but he 16 not 12
he's giving anime mcr fan n I'm here for it
Heathcliff and your Beastwoman are totally exes.
I love watching your videos whenever i am drawing, always a great background noise and i love whenever i look up to see the step by step! Great videos <3
Day 1:can you make a ginger bread doll ❤
He looks like a dude that is a vampire but everyone would just assume he's really into the vampire aesthetic and just goes along with it so he's able to blend in.
This is the vinyl of a killer Bella
Now he needs a girlfriend named Cathy. 🙂 Awesome job!
I love him so much, I want to give you a million thumbs up!
I'm curious if in the future it would be possible to paint something like the teeth *before* you put it into the mouth so it would make it a lot easier? I know with some of my costume builds I'll do detailed pieces before I put everything together, so I'm curious if it would be possible in doll size. Maybe tape off the teeth after painting and putting them in to protect them?
14:57 ohhh the jacket pieces looking like bat wings when he’s upsidedown is genius!! I audibly gasped when that photo came on screen omg!  He looks incredible!! :D The 3D grin came out so good! Also I adore the pics with the lil pumpkin lights 🥺 cuuteee!
I NEED that end pic as a poster. It’s ADORABLE!
he looks like a what we do in the shadows character and I adore that for him 💘
Your my favourite customizer!!  ITS OFFICIALLY HALLOWEEN!! Im so excited.  I absolutely love its repaint!! Ive stuck around for years and LOVE last years halloween video too. Im really happy this came out right before halloween
YEAH IM EARLY!! Kinda….
Your dolls always blow me away! I mean you can paint, sculpt, sew and make amazing concept art. are you a literal god or what?🫶
i love ur art SO MUCH, i crave more art of your dolls also the teeth for the smile look sooooo good  awesome doll as usual
The production quality, especially for the end skit was just 👌🤌
It’s giving vampire jack frost XD I love it
is he single
HIS SHOE GAME SUPERNATURAL ‼️
He looks so good with bottom lighting! The shadows 😱 I feel like if I met him in person I would bully him. He looks to cocky
I love your videos ❤
Siempre espero con gran ilusión tus custom de Halloween❤!  Me ha encantado 😍
Awww, he's such a cute little bad boy! ❤
He looks great, happy Halloween
I was staring at my email waiting for the upload. Thank you Katherine!! 😄
I get it!! When its morning he looks like a friendly hyper guy, But when its dark his eyes are eery and scary, But if you push his bangs aside you see a handsome seductive face~ 😍😍
Ya Nailed It. Girl you never seek to Amaze Me. Also name Idea for this Vampire. Jackson I think would be nice name. It crossed my mind because you Said Biker Jacket at some point. Anyways Happy Halloween🎃!
Officially Halloween 🥰
Can it be Ember's boyfriend?
I know this isn’t exactly your usual content, but i’d absolutely adore to see a video about your process making the concept art! ❤
Amazing ❤❤
That matching shoe you made might be the most impressive thing I've ever seen from you! It looks stunning. I almost thought you were joking about making such an exact recreation!
As cute as the final doll is, what I really adore is the little character piece cinematic at the end, where he's walking through all these masterpieces of art in the corridor, yet value a 2x2 of selfie pictures just as much as those artworks. ^^
He looks like he could be a modern Castlevania character, i love him!
I love him, especially the line on his face for some reason. I know it was an accident, but it reminds me of an old, faded scar, I almost wish it was more visible
the editing on this video was out of this world and really added to the halloween-y vibe!! so much fun 👻
❤❤❤❤❤
You made it! Another fantastic doll. They jacket you made for looks fabulous. I also love all the little portrait motifs at the end as he walks through the halls. Really nice touch, and looked like so much fun.
He's got the Agust D side smile 😏
Omg, finally ❣️❣️ It is so pretty and handsome lol   Ps. He's kinda giving "i have a crush on succubus even thought she's married" 😂😂
Looks like Damien Haas
I was really excited when I saw the white blouse on the first concept art, it reminded me of traditional Romanian garments where vampires originated from and I wonder if there was any inspiration taken from that?
Am I the only one that is thinking him and ember are dating and her parents are arguing about him 🤣 lol
im in love with himmmmm. happy Halloween !!
the shoes ruin it, sorry 😭
I Love him. That face mod!!! So cool.
I've been waiting on this all month! I was starting to get worried you weren't going to do it this year! ❤❤❤❤❤
To not let the other outfit go to waste, it would be cool to see a younger sibling for the vampire! The more modern clothes would also fit well ♡
I don't care if anyone think it's cliche   I LOVE CUTE LOOKING VAMPIRES GIVE HIM TO ME
Yayyy! So hyped for this :D
You know she's good when your cat joins in watching the doll customizing
My favourite part of Halloween is the Dollightful video. It might be weird but I really want his coat but in adult human size. Haha.
literally loves him❤️ im so happy you posted for halloween 🎃 and i already know his friends with ember ❤
I've been following your channel for years and I never noticed that there wasn't a vampire yet. The fact that he is an anime boy was the charm of the design and I'm OBSESSED with the Jordans you gave him. So charming, so cute and mysterious! 1000/10 job
YEAHHHH NEW VID
this vampire got DRIP with those shoes goddamn
Hello Dollightfull, how are you, I haven’t watched your videos in a while so it feels good to be back 😂  Anyways, Heathcliff is so handsome and I’d definitely have a crush on him if he was a real person HAHAHAHA. Amazing work as usual 🩷
Is it just me but he looks like a green onion 7:10 😅
Having the open mouth made it come more alive! I'm loving your dolls this year! You always impress me ❤
Yass I love to see your concept art come to life in doll form. He’s so cool lol I love him
That ending photo is beyond adorable, I love how wholesome this spooky monster found family is!
The vibe of this dude is immaculate,  in a cheeky brat kinda way lol
his face definitely reminds me of a handsome male lead in a manhwa! amazing work as always 💗happy halloween!🎃🦇
AYAYYAYAYAYAYAY SHE POSTEDD!!! I LOVE YOUR CUSTOMIZED DOLLS 😍😍
Toothless Duce is the stuff of nightmares. Loved him in the end and the teeth are very impressive. I could never work with something that small 😂
HAPPY HALLOWEEN :D
Heathcliff is a cute Vampire anime inspires boy
yess!! such a classic halloween monster and seeing your take is as always a treat! I love the hairstyle and the modern but not too modern outfit, the colour choices are immeculate and that grin looks great! I do think you could've pushed the grin a little bit by making the expression more asymmetrical, similar to maple and her crooked smile - the grin feels a tad disconnected from the rest of the face. as for the line down his face I kinda imagine it as a handsome anime boy scar haha. could've leaned into it that way and made it a fun little detail too!  your cratmanship on the clothes in particular is always so much fun to see, and I think his cocky, sassy vibe is a great addition to the lineup <3 thanks as always for sharing your work with us!
11 MINUTES AGO?!
Katherine might be the queen of making amazing female characters but her male characters are a fantastic rare treat to treasure.
I really admire her when she uses those cute dollar store knives (which are less than 1 dollar for 4) to disassemble a doll like, I accidentally broke that exact knife trying to cut a plastic bottle and she can carve a doll using it
VAMPIRE HALLOWEEN DOLL YESSS
OMG so good ! Those too cute pants remind me of a dinosaure somehow... You didn't make a dino inspired doll yet ! That could be a cool idea !
Your halloween doll is always the best thing about spooktober. Heathcliff is so handsome! You really captured the vampire aesthetic but with a personal twist. Great work.
Wow seeing you build an entire set of teeth for a doll was so freaking cool. I love his expression. Great doll!
I love the ending skit, Ember and him being besties I love it
I love how almost all your videos have some new, inventive design detail in them. So much thought is put into your creations and it's so neat seeing the process. The mouth and teeth turned out spooktacular!
1:32 the moment I got the need for a fanfic about him
Why is he kinda..😍
it’s like if Alucard from hellsing and Edward had a baby I love him sm 😭💕
While the doll is an amazing piece of artwork (as usual), I'm exceptionally blown away by all the artwork in this video! The renderings are exquisite! You are such a talented visual artist while being great at customizing dolls as well, I'm so jealous!
Ahh! He looks so freaking cool!! I love watching your videos! your my all time favorite creator and i always look to see if youve posted! ❤❤
oh my days been following for 6 years and somehow i have never been this early
He looks amazing! I’ve been waiting to see a vampire doll and I’m so happy you’re the one who made him! ❤
THIS DOLL IS INCREDIBLE KATHRINE OMG
He's such a pretty boy and you really did give him personality in his new face up. I love him so much!
Still sad we don't see Wendy anymore but I can understand why you made that choice
You know what would be a cool doll to make for a Halloween special a Zombie boy with a cool 80s hairstyle and punk clothing
i think that she should do a ghost doll next because she has not done one yet
You've accidentally checked all my boxes with this one, it's so so gorgeous 😍 ✅ vampiric ✅ sexy ✅ goth ✅ cute ✅ playfully mischievous vibe ✅ boyish - just slightly femboy leaning 🥺
Love it great job👍
that last comic… i ship them
Aw I loved his longer hair! He’s an amazing doll!
he gives me joker from the persona games vibes!! i think it’s all the back white and red!
ANOTHER MAN UP UPON THE SACRIFICIAL DOLLTAR. YES. GOOD.
Did you draw ALL OF THOSE PAINTINGS in the hallway? Incredible.
I can practically hear the crazed anime laughter coming off this one, great job ❤
The concept art made my jaw drop, hes a cutie patootie :33
You know you're in for a wild ride when you see a doll smirking
i haven't watched the video yet and i already know this is gonna be good! the thumbnail omggggg!
He looks like he’d pull a bunch of pranks on people
Move out of the way Eddie boy, there's a new vamp in town 😏
Heathcliff looks like the type to absolutely break my heart and I would still dream about him, I love it so much
I absolutely love the portraits you made of him throughout the centuries! Such a cute touch ❤ and the photo booth pictures of his new friends!
I LOVE ITT❤❤❤❤❤❤
I feel like the wavy hair gives him a "Lestat, the Vampire" vibe
He looks like the arrogant vampire overlord in an iseka anime
why he kinda.....
I love that he already knew Ember and the Banshee and they're a little trio XD
He looks awesome! Gives me vampire Hiccup vibes, loooove him!
He feels like a Pokémon rival specialising in dark types. Like an older Gladion or Guzma. He'll work with you but exclusively on his terms. Idk though.
I look forward to the halloween custom all year every year 😭 im so excited!
loving the halloween background
You’re a freaking genius. You made doll dentures for a vampire and i love you for it. He’s my new favorite male doll
idk why but i imagine his voice sounding like corpse😳
I'm really wondering why he's wearing little shorts the entire time as opposed to other dolls??
Omg he looks like the hot version of the sesame street vampire !!!!!
Omg, the gallery is to die for.
I forgot you were not actually the doll so your hand appearing like that really scared me lol 😂 I love it, like always ❤
Before his teeth are added in, his gaping maw is the thing of nightmares. Kinda looked like Frankenstein at that part.  Teeth turned out fantastic!
I'm writing a vampire AU of a popular Netflix show, this makes me wish I'd have finished writing so that I could have put up the first chapter for halloween. Man, being in a creative rut sucks (hehe) but you always manage to inspire me to keep being creative! Thanks Dollightful! ❤
Not even halfway through the video and I already love him. Lopsided smiles are so fun on dolls.
🎃happy Halloween! everyone.  Heathcliff is drop dead gorgeous and has a smile to die for!
He looks like Count von Count’s teen son that just discovered My Chemical Romance 😂  I love the different fabric for the bat on the back, it adds an interesting shift. And his smirk is not seductive… he has a lot to learn before he can become the next Edward Cullen. Happy Halloween!!! 🎃
my headcanon is that he and ember are exes
The doll looks awesome, I loved the little art at the end of the three hanging out. If you would like an idea for next year, you could try The Headless Horseman.
I adore your halloweeny monster dolls so much!! what an exciting addition ♥♥♥♥
I love vampires! And that animatoon part this year was super cool
He’s very attractive 👌🏻
Heathcliff has that younger teen tween look to him almost like he goes to monster high
That face-up is gorgeous! and the fact that the teeth and mouth are 3d is so cool!
ok sooooo inspired, I'm for sure going to be drawing a line of modern versions of classic monsters now :)
Ah, we finally get a ML to a historical romance manhwa… I love him
Heath and tatsu definitely shop at the same store! Ha ha ha  I love this doll sm!✨️
I am not normal about this doll at all, in fact i am very much unhinged  The sound that came out of me seeing the concept art itself. I want to be him so bad. The gender envy I feel looking upon this DOLL is insane. Thank you for this💕
that hand grabbing him in the beginning was genuinely startling 😂
He turned out so cute! The art at the end with him in his different eras is such a nice touch🥰
10:10 you should totally make an 80s themed doll someday
Thanks for giving us this spooky lad!!! I full on assumed you weren’t gonna do a Halloween doll this year cause of all the set-backs in the dark rainbow one. Never been so happy to be wrong! He’s great!!
Alternative title: how to make doll dentures
Dollightful mentioning rockstar and 80's poof for Heathcliff's hair when I'm dressing up as Vampire Eddie Munson this Halloween...
The line down his cheek can just be a scar he got after a run-in with some vampire hunters! There are no mistakes, just happy accidents
Aahh what a fun project!
Honestly, I already loved the character design, but the surprise inclusion of the Nikes really sold this character for me. Now all I can imagine is him being a sneakerhead and having a massive shoe collection from all the centuries he's been alive 😂 even immortals need hobbies!
Ohhh I absolutely love him!! Gosh that mouth is such a cool technique. You did such a great job on him it's making me want a G3 Deuce now just for that pretty sculpt haha
Omgg I love him ❤
Those teeth 🤯
I'm so excited for the new video !!  and I'm so glad she is using gen3 a lot so theres a lot of fun variety from the base alone
He is so my new crush - I am off to wattpad😂
You know what I really like about this doll? He kind of looks Hispanic! Well done as always, Dollightful! You did him justice- especially the teeth, wowie!
I'm gonna cress your J's Heathcliff 13:06
I am very normal about this Doll, yes. I'm not insane or anything, Just a normal fan :))))
missed opportunity to turn the big paint crack into a nasty scar looks cool regardless tho, i always love your work!!!
What a beautiful vampire! Obsessed with the mouth modification it adds so much character! 😍🦇🖤
Yay! Halloween dollightful video! The doll looks absolutely amazing, you can see how much you’ve improved over the years.
Beautuful korean vampire ❤ love him 🙂
i loved all the art at the end! it was cool to see some background story for the character as well as him interacting with other dolls you've created! so cool :)
YES✨💜 amazing 👌
I absolutely LOVE HIM 😍😭 One of my favorite dolls you've made and that says a lot, cause all you do is spectacular ❤
He looks like such a little brat, and I love it! 🤣 definitely has ancient trickster vibes lol
A vampire how classic.  The doll is so cool.  I love watching you make dolls.  You are such a great artist and even new video brightens my day.   I wonder if he is Ember’s boyfriend.  Happy Halloween to you and your family and I am excited to see your next doll.
Omg the illustrations at the end!!! As usual, love the doll, you did a wonderful job sculpting the mouth!
The thing you did with the mouth was so unique, love this !!
Wow! Those teeth! You are truly talented!
Love the new addition to the Halloween line! Where did you get the Nike shoes, and do you know if they fit male barbie dolls?
YAYY i've been so excited to see what you do this year!! his teeth are so cool i love him >:00 amazing work as always <33
Your video really turned my day around💕 thank you for sharing your art with us! You come up with the most dynamic designs with so much thought and creativity!🧛🏻‍♂️
He gives "little vampire" vibes...i love it
the ending sequence was so cute !!
That would be cool with the photo you made of Em that you make a comic or a stop motion series with them
i’ve been waiting for this videooo
Gosh! He turned out great! So cool! And i love how cinematic your shots where! The little movie moments are so cool!!!
The art you added at the end was amazing! Always love seeing a JC Leyendecker reference :) Happy Halloween, Katherine! 🖤🖤🖤
You’re such a good character designer istg 😩😩 And the photo shoot illustration at the end? *Chef’s kiss*
I love vampires and he looks so cool! Also that artwork of him with the Banshee and Ember at the end is sending me it's so cute 🤩
Oh my gosh he's so handsome 💕 I can't believe how you can work with such short black pencil! And thanks for the mention, the black nails completed the look so well! 💙💚
Loved the 3D modeled hallway at the end—you always go the extra mile for your videos!!
I like it You could have said that the line down the side of his face was a scar and it was on purpose I mean vampires have scars sometimes!
Very Vampire Knight
He almost has dolly dentures, sorta, eh?
AH Katherine I live for your customs! The mouth mod on Heathcliff looks amazing! I'm so happy you've included another male doll to your line-up! Incredible work! The end sequence was also so perfect!! Team Dollightful are creative geniuses!! Happy Halloween!
he’s so cute!!! tbh that line on his face kinda looks like a cool, old scar to me. something mysterious from his past perhaps…
I love the little details like zips and belt buckles - they really add a lot of charm to your dolls! Also the teeth turned out AMAZING! I envy your patience and skill.
He looks like a young doll version of Damon Salvatore
dollightful male dolls>>>>>>>>
I'm early ish for once!!!!
The pictures of him throughout time are SO AMAZING CATHERINE!!!!! 🥰🥰💖
ishipitishipitishipit
it's always such a treat when you upload! a halloween treat this time, if you will
cant believe im so early! i can tell this halloween video is going to be awsome!
Earliest i have been so far! The video looks good already even though im barely a few minutes in hahah. Your concept art is stunning as always. :)
His coat is something i would wear in real life. Gosh i love this doll, he looks so cool.
At roughly 10 mins in, he was proper giving uncanny counter vibes with the wavey hair sticking up all over the place 😂❤
So is he Ember's boyfriend??? 👀💗
Yeahh!!  Boy boy boy!  I get so happy when i see custon male dolls!
His clothes remind me a bit of Joker form Persona 5 , loved it
if I could applaud your halloween dolls, someone would've gone deaf and I would also have to have bandages on my hands. THEY'RE JSUT SO AMAZING!!! >w<
he looks like a middle school boy💀
This has made me think of two things: 1. A 80s hair rock band 2. A super bubbly, pink, younger sister vampire.
HOT VAMPIRE MAN HOT VAMPIRE MAN HOT WAMPIRE MAN       can he have a werewolf boyfriend?
YAAAAAAHS! Spooky season wouldn't be the same without Katherine's spoopy doll makeovers! ❤🎃🎉
He's amazing!!! Awesome work with his teeth. He looks so handsome 🤩👏👏👏 I love all the artwork as well. 😁
The firm grab in the beginning was very funny haha
The line on his face is kind of like a cute anime boy sexy scar. It's so faint, but you know his love interest will worry, and there will be a tragic backstory coming later in the story  😍🥰😘
It looks like Marshall lee
hi happy Halloween soon
I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED AN EMO VAMPIRE CUSTOM BUT IM HAPPY HES HERE
This was so so fun!!! Love your videos
I think for next year you could do a neon zombie. That way you can do a monster but go crazy on the colors
Ah gosh, I really love how the coat came out -- I'm a sucker for crazy but cool biker jackets 😂 Also amazing job with the teeth, they look so cool and make that smirk work so well!!!
a jellyfish inspired doll would be so cute!! especially with the jellyfish cut!
Heathcliff's expression looks like he just told an awful joke and is waiting for the punchline to hit 😂 I love his cheeky smirk, it looks fantastic!!
I love that he looks super edgy, then just have a killer set of Nike's! Lol he looks amazing!!
Do you think rings would look good on him???
The dollightful halloween doll will always be my favourite part of the year lol!
Your dolls  amaze me every time! I'm so happy to see this year for halloween that you're doing a very classic vampire!
Ŵhat a gorgeous and mischevious looking bat boy. Wonder if he hangs out with Tatsuo and Juwon just to tease them XD   I love your creative process and design. You inspire me to try make my own characters and bring them to life! Keep up the wonderful work!!
Ah, Halloween, the time of the year were all the doll YouTubers come together and make greatness
Am I the only one who thought he could be a friend of your goth boy doll and he was turned when they were out one night before the goth boy met his boyfriend. Is it just me
He reminds me of Rudolph from The Little Vampire. It's so good.❤ I wish I was this talented to make such good art.
GYADDD THIS VIDEO WAS WORTH THE WAIT
*”Let’s bring him to life”* *Wait, but I thought vampires were supposed to be undea— /hj*
A cute vampire guy made by Dollightful? THAT'S A HALLOWEEN GIFT, if there's even such thing 😂😂😂😍😍😍
for some reason, his face really reminds me of Hueningkai from TXT and I love it,, he looks awesome!
HES MY LITTLE MEOW MEOW I LOVE HIMMMM
Now, that's one sexy doll 😏🌹
First
That jacket is so awesome!! And the line on his face looks cool, like a scar, maybe?  I'm a sucker for goth aesthetics, so thanks for playing it up with the red, white, and black!
He looks like an emo kpop idol and im living for it!
The line down the side of his face looks like a scar. An interesting part of his lore/backstory perhaps? 🤔
WAKE UP YALL DOLLIGHTFUL POSTED 🗣️
You could do frankistine but with different doll body parts like half mermaid half snake
I love how the concept looks like a 30 year old dude, and the doll looks like a 12 year old trying to have rizz 😭😭 (i really love the dall tho!!)
You should doll based off of H.P Lovecraft's stories. I would love to see your interpretation of characters like Wilbur Whateley, Yog-Sothoth, and Cthulhu.
The first pair of pants you made are so cute and hopefully they get reused in the future !!
He’s like Astarion’s hypebeast kid brother!
He looks SO COOL!!! Great job on this one =D
annual halloween doll !! i am so excited . i have been here for several several years of halloween dolls and this one and nyx might just be my favorite !!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SO LONG YESSS!!! AND IM SO EARLY ONLY 14 MINUTES AGO YAAA
I 💘
he looks like a vampire vampire hunter, like a vampire that hunts vampires
IM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU USE THE AIRBRUSH MORE!!!!!! I adore this doll too :3
My favorite dollightful video of the year! They are always beautiful, but Halloween is the best.
i loove the mouth being open and more 3D!! really gives the door a more lifelike appearance and makes him so cool!!
The line on his face is just a subtle scar , perhaps from when he became a vampire…. It’s a mystery.   But also accurate because he got it when you made him a vamp.
Oh yesss! The yearly Halloween video! Happy Halloween! :D
1:54 he really leaf-ed
I've been having the worst week every and seeing a new Dollightful video helped me so much more than I'd like to admir
Love your Halloween dolls as usual. 😊  Happy Halloween too! 👻 🎃 👻
I love the doll! Why does he kinda look like Damien from Monster Prom tho haha! You're seriously my favorite artist and I wish you the happiest and spookiest of Halloweens!
smash. next question.
Ahhh! I love him!! The face is so amazing and the 3D teeth are fantastic!!! A boy doll for Halloween is all I could have asked for!!!
Yay Halloween doll my favourite time of the year
i absolutely adoreee this series, you make every halloween iconic 🫶
Any Astarion girlies here? 😍 This feeds right into my obsession
Woooo! Spooky time!
🧛‍♂️❤️I Love and your customs 🧡🎃so much I look forward to it every year !  Too bad there wasn’t a Big Halloween Collabration with other fellow Doll Artists butI think  It’s mindful for you and for everyone to work in their own time. Love you❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤🧡🎃🧛‍♂️
I really love how that poor dude gets his head absoloutly demolished but still gets to have some undies on in the video😂😂
I'm so surprised you haven't done a vampire yet, but now looking back on all the dolls I've seen you do over the years, yeah!! you havent!!
This is unrelated but the sketches for the mouth are so beautiful
Posted on my birthday! The best gift I could ever ask for!! Love your stuff !!!??
OMG I AM SO EARLY!!! AAAHHHH I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS Next year can you do a frankenstein monster?
kind of reminds me of hanako kun
Kinda wished the eyebrows were more slanted so he doesnt look like hes so.. lazy? (Expression wise)
You could always make the face line into a scar!
The doll turned out so good 😍 I love it 😊
I like the line on the face❤... like a battle scar from a vampire slayer 😂
the few minutes he had no teeth were terrifying, but those teeth turned out incredible! worth tonight's nightmares
Do you also want to make a teenieping doll?
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the 3D teeth so much!! Well done!
❤great! As always!!
Yaaaaassssssss!!!!!!!!!!  HOT!!🔥 vampireeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!
That concept art is so yummy 🤤 💕 💞 ♥️  I laughed so hard when you aggressively grabbed him lol
oh, I'm really sorry that you didn't paint his legs, it's strange that it feels unfinished, even so, it looks super cute!
THE HALLOWEEN INTRO IS BACKK
i want a kitsune doll 😭
yayyyyyyy
Yesssssssssssssss…SHE MADE A VIDEOS OMGGGGG
I think for the smirk, you should have closed the right eye slightly to show the cheek coming up, rather than looking like he just has a cut mouth. 😊 Edit: omg the art wall was fantastic, I love the purikura ❤❤
wow omg the mouth is AMAZING
I adore vampires!!!!!! They are my number one favourite through all my life. the are so elegant, beautiful, sexy looking and have an awesome sense in fashion in ever era!!!!!! I am so happy you repaint a male vampire!!!!!! That will make my day even better keep up the awesome hard work you do!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🧛‍♀🧛‍♀🧛‍♀🧛‍♀🧛‍♀🧛🧛🧛🧛🧛🧛‍♂🧛‍♂🧛‍♂🧛‍♂🧛‍♂🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
