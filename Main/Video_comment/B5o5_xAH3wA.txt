Atfro
You gotta give this man his flowers 💐 and better mention his name in uk legends
Wait his he from Cambridge estate in Kingston?
Still not at a milli??? Wtf
Nah man the bars too mad. Bros subject matter is too relatable..
Another talented G failed because of his skin colour! Racism in the music industry is ridiculous man but something that just gets ignored!!
So underrated it's bs
This is actually a top five underrated ever. Not just UK rap like ever 😅
livin free but we dont know the true freedom-stuck up in these man made corporate systems, making our p but never founds our peace, damn this f* 'reality'
damn-this got the jazzy flow🔥
my favorite song honest to god
Damn 😎
Real bars there ain't a drug dealer who raps, I'm a rapper selling drugs 🔥
Proper grown man music
"Living free but we don't know freedom,  Follow you where ever you leave me, Love me atleast before you leave me, Had to burn these bridges down"😥💯❤️

7 months taking the piss now guy eager for a new song smh
Been banging Benny Banks music since I was 16 years old. I don’t listen to him as much as my younger years cos I’m more of an American rap fan but hands down he’s one of the best road rappers in the UK. I’m 30 now and every now and again still search up Benny Banks to have a listen to old plus new joints. 14 years of consistent classic and timeless music since you dropped “Drugs Pay The Bills” in 2009. Keep doing your thing bro 💯.
It's big to see benny perfect his craft man he used to over rap on the beats it's goodv he learned give them those elite bars in small doses 💯❄️❄️❄️
No cap I've gave this banger 2k views
Benny the landlord
I only need a few good benny banks tracks a year - and this is one of them
When the bars started coming out her mouth, I just thought wtf blud, this ain't workin
banks on the jazz is the one. new vibe
That was fucking awsome. Moved the fuck outta me. Thanks so much :)
Benny way to talented man and underrated fr
This is so hard! The visuals were sick
Why the Cambridge estate Benny?
Who prays to priests?
this ting need couple milly at least 🤣🎵🤙
Benny's back fuck yes I needed this rn 👌
Big up benny
Even though he may not be asking you to sell it, he works in mysterious ways and you seem to be avoiding him, keep pushing bro, even if you don’t sell you still changing lives and you know it. 💯
This song is such a beautiful vibe, Violet May’s part has been stuck in my head 🙌🏾✨
I-wear-a-mask-to-hide-my-face-not-to-hide-from-covid

Benny x Knucks !
Jheeez Benny The Bank Runner  💰 🏃🏼‍♂️
As most folks come out of their 20s into their mid thirties..depression and a mixture of losing their youth..if they are artists such as BB when it’s time to put pen to paper and write down your experience of getting older can be be very informative..depression isn’t all about negativity it’s also a way of learning about your inner self as hard as a reality shock it can be.
On god benny is one of the hardest in the UK atm
"I'm still learning how to be a parent, make sure you're present in their life don't just make an appearance." That bar hit different.  Hood Legend.
❤️❤️💚

You ain’t really free it’s like your on parole
🔥🔥🔥
“Screaming all lives matter , I guess that makes him cultured “😶‍🌫️ Take time and let that sink in !
Feature knucks on the remix???
We needed Knucks on this aswell that’s shit would’ve been mad bennys wordplay is mad the little words that fill in between rhymeschemes and how he executes it is a madness one of britains best but also one of britains underrated n underground rappers how do man listen to digga d or russ when u have tunes like this with flow rhythm lyrics story n wordplay mad any one of bennys tunes are better than most man’s full eps or albums that’s when u know u doing it right 💯

Great to hear more of BB on this vibe. Violet is a big talent too. 10/10 track.
dunno why but this really captures mad vibes from when i was in Croydon, listened from the start bro and never stopped. your music is fire.
The whole Burning Bridges EP is a masterpiece. This isn’t even the best off the EP in my opinion! Take a leaf is cold! Form is temporary! Tony Hawk!   Need videos for these tracks as well! They need to be heard!
Neeeeeeed the instrumentallllll🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cannot stop playing the new ep! Thank you!! Needed this right now to get me through this journey in life 🎉🫶🏼 Benny’s back with the new new 💥
BENNY LETS GOOOOOOO. YOU AND THESE JAZZ TYPE BEATS WORK SO WELL. THAT BASS THAT PAIN LETS GET IT
Benny always dropping fire man, been listening to this man for like 10years + .. never disappoints 🔥 🔥
Why's he on Cambridge estate for loool
Consistent 💪
Patiently waiting? bro you should no longer be waiting people need to realise. Sick tune keep doing you. 💯👌🏻🔥
Benny deserves recognition!!!!
Nice vibe benny, goes down well in the  motor pinging through London Boroughs of redbridge and havering  and sometimes tower hamlets if I fancy a salt beef bagel 🥯
fuck em all mate
Yess! Im glad you’re still persevering. Keep growing bro⚡️ life is all about the lessons you learn in life. “What’s your words worth if they worthless, sometimes even peace can be disturbing” hmm. 🙇🏽‍♂️ ..
I love these jazz blends. “DAMN” by Kendrick Lamar vibes bro. I love this. It's beautiful bruv.
Benny needs to start dropping every week or month. I quit music because I couldn't release every week. Consistency is key or failure is  right there.
benny coldest
Had the pleasure of meeting Benny and his pal on a ally way in Brighton "pride weekend" and I was slightly shocked "star struck" as silly as it sounds as we're the same age but listened to his music for 10years....as I told him we are all waiting for the new stuff his pal was agreeing with me saying "see see" the people need you...and I politely said my goodbye and went off to party....Benny if you read this "it's the balloon 🎈 man you meet in Brighton" keep going fella.
Hard! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know when the video compliments the song to a T 👏👏👏👏
🔥🔥🔥
☝️🤌🎤🎷🔥🔥🔥🔥
❄️❄️❄️

Top lyrics. I've never had to go to AA, but I'm reading 'Dr Sleep' - and the phrase 'I cant do it, God can - let Him'. so much of what we thought was a good idea was wrong. NEVER too late to change.
