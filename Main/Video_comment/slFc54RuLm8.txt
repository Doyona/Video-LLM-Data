You should be on a wall shoot web slinger and stick to the other wall

Mix all the glue together and that’s probably what the reason why you couldn’t do it cause you it makes the glue you need to do that? 3:09
Hi

The real web shooters are only from Peter Parker aka Bully Maguire and he can shoot spider webs directly from his wrists without any tools. 😊😊
Could you make something like a force field?
Sticks to building glasses😂
Do you have to string it because I found that exact web shooter for I think 20 bucks and I get it and it tangled around it’s self so much times I couldn’t use it if you could send me one all put together that would be amazing but I am still a minor so if you are reading this and will actually send me one put together I can get my mom to send you the loacation if she agrees

you should make a new webshooter with 4 suction cups (the big red ones) per one web shooter

I hope u help stop nosey
Try making thors hammer that actually summons lightning
Can you actually swing from buildings with web shooter ?
Bro, you just did what Marvel fans have been trying to do for centuries and you did it in one day
Now make one for your other hand 🔥
I wish you would show how to make the small capsule I would love that for around my property
Awesome bro 🕸️
2:26😭😭😭instantly got the reference
now make two of em and swing around
You should try using vacuum sealed suction cups
I respect the hustle
i think you should make a light saber that actually works
Could I possibly make a web shooter similar to yours?
12:53 this is Jlaser's version of the Captain America "audition" The Hacksmith dud in his electromagnetic captain america shield video. Where he used it to hold a truck, mimicing the Helicopter hold in Civil War.
Me sitting here thinking what he could accomplish using two web shooters. That would absolutely blow my mind!
ts is soo ahh vro
2:24 looks like the one scene from spiderman homecoming
In the future, combined all of your inventions and then use them and higher somebody to play electro please😊
Make miles morales electric power
Super man lazer ies
how much
2:24 that nilered part was personal 😂
Would be so cool if you could make the same, but for both hands! So you can shoot one swing, shoot with the other and cut the other rope. That way you can swing longer!
I want to train
Bro this was my dream when I was a kid
instead of working on the webs- we should work on the spider..
I think there are too many ropes involved
You should have pi little magnets on th big web so they were actually stuck
some undryable glue might help
Make  a spider man  mask with moving lenses
Can I have one for free
It's a nice design but why not make a pepper spray web shooter for people who are concerned about their safety. Pepper spray cans tend to be in pockets or bags and if you get humped on, chances are, you won't get to it. So, why not design a wearable pepper spray version so anyone walking home can feel a little bit safe knowing that they can just "web" someone who tries to attack them. That would be more practical and helpful.
Where to  we get  that  web shooter  my  friend
Hey bro just give me one tomorrow alright
in another life J would have been the most incredible live theater special effects designer
Spider man spider sense cana u make that plssssssssssss 🥺 i am subcribe
Now you just need to CRISPR some spider genes into yourself
Id honestly be pitching these inventions to the military.  (sure they might already have something similar) But i could see functionality for maybe small special ops use.
Super bro ❤❤❤❤
Need his other webs I fear
Everything is perfect but next time try to make it beautiful 😂 15:06
Can I have one of the Web shooters
NICE I LIKE THAT
Web Shooters❌ Batman's Grappling Hook Gun ✅
If bro gets 2 😂
Two questions can I buy it and if I can does the package come with both webs or do I have to buy two web shooters cuz I'm not rich
I’ve been thinking about why haven’t scientists don’t try to use the strongest web fluid from a spider and try to make it stronger I get it people get clowned on but I might go to college just to work on this project.
Can you build a lightsaber from StarWars.
Did I hear Nile red?
sell two for one so we can actually swing better
Imagine if he had two
COD work ahh  rope hero ahh
NT{}■♠︎¡♠︎■■■■

If you used vulgular word don’t use it.
You’ve together basically all of the different solid line web swinging stuff that people have been doing over the years. Now all that’s left is combining fluid web shooters with solid line webshooters
wheres the fluid it only says it comes with magnets
2:26  nile red jumpscare

Do you sell them, I’m willing to pay 6 figures for this
One day, this man is going to make some type of metallic accelerator to make his punches be as strong as Spidey's
2:25 💀 who said that bro
this would honestly be insane for emergency services like firefighters'
I'm just so crazy over this I can,t control my emotions
I’m a chemist, I made web fluid because I’m a huge Spider-Man fan. I want to collaborate with someone
could i gte a free webshooter shipped to england?
Watch him mix all of his creations together and become the one running the government 😂
2:26 was that Neilred
how you took hammer smaller?
amazing
Amazing work. It does remind me more, though, if I may, of Batman's gadgets and grappling gear than Spidey. Swinging from the "shooter" here would definitely look cool with a Batman costume!
awesome! now just dont miss
How much does the kevlar rope cost?
You should make it better I believe in you
You would make a great Peter Parker/spider Man for film. You actually look a lot like the Peter Parker from the McFarlane comics.

my guy is Spiderman now
We gonna have super hero’s and super villains in 2040
Build the same web shooter for your other hand
I want it
Where can i get it?
do you ship to europe cus i rlly want to buy one
Make the grappling arm from bionic commando
the question is: how to make the webshooters:  more compact  more "web" like in appearance but still having the capability of swinging  use 2 web shooters at once (like in the franchise. 2 web shooters are better than 1)
Now add a barrel that is a web net that catches people :D
*4:37* do the web shooters come in pairs when you hit the quantity of one?
Genius absolute Genius
2:26 not the NileRed sound
Dude this is so effing cool. 🤘🏽

You don’t need to do all this to make a web shooter just get bit by a science lab spider
I love it❤

2:28 is that Nile red I hear lol
I loved this video so much ❤
Iwantone
Why didnt he sell the kne at 6:40
im not a chemist or scientist of any kind but im thinking about the fact that spider webs are protein based so potentially a protein packed "web" with a reaction similar to elephants toothpaste on a smaller scale could have the web housing act as a reaction chamber
For the web like polymer, try adding xanthan gum to it.
can i please get it for free, im just a kid in ghana
6:31 spider man doesn’t kill
why not just have like a flexible thing (so it works on corners and edges) at the end of the web shooter thing like a circle and on the face of the circle the edges would have the rat trap thing which would hold for a little bit then have the super glue in the middle which would hold you for a lot longer
but it just works on wood
What if you try do this but with two hands i mean 2 web shooters?
INNER CHILDRENNNNN........ ASSEMBLE

and only 10$
i have a web shooter that u can use magnet and suction
What if you could somehow make it all more stringy like if you used oobleck for the swing and ferrofluid at the end to stick on to things. With the oobleck you could probably get on good swing out of it until it just melts away. (not a engineer nor scientist i am literally sitting in my bed and that came to mind)  Amazing creation thought great work
you need to make a mark 3 with an active technology vision inside
istg someday we'll see the title "I engineer my body in such a way to become spiderman"
Bat is tomaatch mani
Can you please make me one? 🙏
Make rockets gun
Yo idk you posted this a year ago but I just bought one for my birthday and it’d coming soon I’ll post a review when It comes in

Hey Jay, laser or anybody that’s in the comments if I could possibly get my hands on these, I would be very grateful I’m looking for something just like that. I’m talking about the one with four strands. That’s the one I need not the one with glue or the one you’re promoting, I need one with four strands. My Instagram is legacy8437
Kane you could make a lightsaber

Hey man, your webshooter toy has too many fakes, I got one last weekend and it broke after an hour and I got an official one today and it’s better quality, the fakes can never compete with the real JLaser! Keep up the good work on your products

Make a hoverboard please ❤
no
can u get one for free
Butt hole
what if you could fit the tip of the dart kinda thing with a harpoon-hook kinda type of thing which locks into place when shot at something and like make the tip of the harpoon hook thing have like a small mechanism which opens and closes the claw with either a small button and micro wiring running down rope which can extend the claw to hook into things and then fold back the claw when you need to detatch the web from an item, or either run a small rope pull mechanism throughout the web's rope separately and then like pulling it could either extend or fold the claw on the tip, like it could make the web reusable almost instanly instead of having just one attempt and then having to wedge the dart out of the wall, like how spiderman creates new web to use it. that could make the web shooter more like real spiderman and can be used for swinging over and over and having more attempts than just one, its a bit complicated, but i have a idea in mind but its just that like i dont have the materials or surroundings to do such a experiment...
Bro so getting close keep going jake🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cool vid
Bro is next Spider-Man
Neat
can those webshooters be sold to africa? more specifically morocco?
6:20 this can be actually used by the police or smthng for catching criminals 😂

where should we buy the web shooter from?
@JLazervideo Do you know how many pounds the toy web shooter can support?
I feel like we need to see this but with 2 web shooters, going from climbing on the wall, firing the first, and then firing the second while swinging from the first would be the ultimate Spider-Man feeling!
Couple of questions, how are you gonna make it so you can transport yourself by swing, and is that even possible?
BROS GONNA BE A HIGH TECH ENGNEER SOME DAY
make demon slayer  sword
casn i pls have real odm gear
He made the super shotgun from doom
Hi is it possible for the web shooter to look like venom web ? Idk if u have done that ps. By venom web I mean the web being black
Hacksmith can make one that actually works and a bulletproof suit, catch up already. Some of us are going to take up vigilantism and need reliable gear
Next Hacksmith?
You need to collaborate with built irl
I can't believe this man is still alive
Great creation although there still not organic
Hey i am a spider man fan and i found your web shooters and i just wondering can you web swing with the web shooters on wrist. Just imagine two web shooters on each wrist shoot it at a target 🎯🎯 and you let go in movies of Andrew and tobey Maguire spider man it makes looks so easy and so smooth on how they web swing but i come to you now jake to answer this question can you really web swing with the web shooters
2:26 he turned into a different  youtuber
No lie, this reminds me more of the grapple gun for Batman. The concept, design and execution.
😃Again Jake.. Genius.. and loved all the start of the video and everything , brainstorming , the builds , tests gosh.. incredible.. and, at 13:03 Oh. My.. Gosh. you actually pulled his Rav4. gosh.. that was wicked.. and when you walked away with the tire cover lol like Peter and the Lunch tray.. oh gosh.. lol loved that.. Amazing.. all what you do and make is I have no words just 🤯 That last part.. awwh.. gosh lol. 😊👌,, Loved everything and the wall climbers gosh.. I would say yes, 1 step closer and again.. amazing.. Bravo!!!🏆
Bro i am a child and i love Spiderman and this blown my inner spiderman spirit😅🎉❤
We got IRL spiderman before gta6 💀
My 8-year-old son thinks the web shooter is really cool. He wonders if you could make one that doesn’t make holes in buildings when you shoot, yet still allows for swinging.
How much do the web shooters cost😅
my name is Isaiah i think you made a pretty gnarly thing i was also thinking you should make storm breaker
Just need to reglue the piece of rope every time 😂
Now make a suit that is fire proof AND Bulletproof
2:24 nilered 💀
Make me one It’s awesome
u should make ODM gear from attack on titans
Make one where you can ascend and descend with the web and try using two webs in mid air
people need to hire this guy to make products for movies
you know you can really make web fluid all you need is salicylic acid, toluene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate and that's it
Could be a military application for that?
I listen to the Harry Potter audio books (the one read by Jim Dale) and I got 20/20!!!🎉🎉🎉

Dude make 2 of them so you can do 2 swings, start from that wall swing, swing again, hit the second wall
Please give me that😊
Bro 4:39
all it is is a leap of faith
I wanna see the WaffleBot, it is an animatronic character from the 2011 comedy film A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas. The bot appears in the film's commercial and in the final scene, where it saves the main characters, Harold and Kumar, from their kidnappers.
He needs to make a hulk serum next lol
I love how he is just fine with putting all this sh- on his wrist
love it bro, that's amazing!
im a little tad bit late but you should jump then shoot it and catch yourself instead of shooting then jumping
Shooters didn’t come with the part where it shoots out
This is peter parker irl . I mean, now we can imagine how Peter was working on his webs.
This is a very good web shooter but all the sudden after having it for a week the mechanism  stopped working and it broke so I think perhaps you could maybe fix the problem I said
can you make a video on how you made the web shooter at 6.25 minutes of the video?
Mom I need to go to the store   Why    To become spider man

Web shooter
Pov:when your Teacher wants you to make a web shooter in chemlisty class be like...
I'm sure can't make shaktiman suits I can bet bro 🤨
Connected to your waist really? And that helmet you look like the homecoming suit. And are you thanos? Why do you have 2 gauntlets? Spiderman uses web shooters not gauntlets. Just face it your not ready for this stuff.
I placed an order 5 months ago and my 2000 lira was withdrawn, the product still did not arrive, are you deceiving us?
YOYO
Hi I am your friend can you give me a web shooter I subscribe to your videos and I like your videos bye🎉❤

Spider-Man creates his own web fluid, in custom web cartridges, that he stores in his customized web shooters. Try that. If you're trying to be like Spider-Man? Then you should try doing what he did.
OMG 😮

Trying all the Spider-Man stuff at once
Try all the spider man item
I know this video is a little old, but I hope you watch it, because you don't do the same mechanism as in the grippers you made before, the only problem would be the grip time but I think it could work  Sorry if the writing is not understandable, use Google translator ^^"

Dude is the next Iron man 😂 making all that crazy stuff. Nice video 🔥
I think One day you will be spiderman
2:26 why did you use nile red's voice?
4:19 I’d take that one. Don’t even need to swing from it, I’ll just yank stuff
Will the finished product in this video ever be for sale?
Bro it's 59 bucks 😳
Oh, and your next invention should be a real life Thanos hand with the infinity stones, and with one snap someone will instantly disappear no I’m just kidding, but since there will have a sound and a hellion that will think someone will disappear
I know where you got it from you got it from spiders studio
Is this thing in India
I NEED IT
Show this to random people at the park. They will be astonished
does he sell these? im trying to be the irl spiderman hehehe, in all seriousness does he?

Make a Spider-Man Mask
Gonna be fighting crime but can't forget the wooden board that you will need 😂
Bro you gotta make another one and swing with two arms.
This is awesome! You should make another one for your other arm so that you can alternate arms and keep swinging
I wanna buy it! 😂😂😂😂
Wait can you make a grabpack
I see I'm not needed here
Bought your web shooter it’s so cool. I can get my stuff without walking standing anyhing
I have an idea for a web shooter: how about using a mechanism similar to a revolver, with a cylinder of 6 to 10 capsules that rotate as you shoot one of them. Imagine a capsule bracelet that rotates around your wrist.
Can you make spiderman ps4 gadgets
Spiderman? More like Scorpion.
I already bought one before i watch ur video. 💀
FFFFwhat is the name of Web shooter
Combined all the glue
I think the next spidy thing would put the web shooters on both hands and after you swing once you release another string and swing
"im not going to show you how i did this for your own safety"  sure buddy.. we all see through that bud
do you even shot web brop?
Get a little kid and he will literally be able to swing easily 😂
2:21 nilered
Bro actually might become the next spider man
£40
Great now we need the fluid😂
Living a dream, maybe make a second for the other hand and do a double swing :-)
Can u add Zambia support tho?
i got the webshooter that you are selling. it worked great until the countless times i had to untangle the string inside the reel. Eventually, the wire broke and the reel-in stopped working. 😬
NileRed: I was able to pull some white goo 😂😂
Spider man in real life 🕷 👨
Make a accurate jet pack
The frisbee would be so cool to have
Make the glue web shooter into a gun
Try to make vision’s mind stone as like a helmet similar to a lightsaber kinda laser
Make a Goblin Glider
I only have the web shooter that comes with a dart that just shoots but cannot make you swing around like Spider Man.
this guy is like every kids dream. even though he explains it i’m just so surprised he can do that
I wanna to ask if it is possible to create web shooter reusable. I mean when you release first web (rope), you could fire other web from your arsenal many times in a row.
Amazing work! Can you try swinging from a wall than ending on another wall with wall climbers?
I want a spider man web shooters please my address s 2203
Nah bro we need this to sell
Where's the link
i think you should make black panther shoes that don't emit sound
Now we need a full spiderman suit with all the spiderman things he done
what is your web site?
He needs a way to instantly release the rope
In your next video, can you put together every spider gadget you made and like do It on video a I guess
Spider-Man also detaches his web from his web shooters, so how are you gonna do that?
This Spider-Man is more captain America
Fun fact: in real life it would be impossible to swing from buildings like Spider-Man without ripping your arms off.
この人神様だ！ ありがとう❤
Do the flying disc for sale  Love the good work
Bro no shade to this guy, but I ordered these on Christmas with a gift card I got, and I still haven't gotten them on Jan 15 😭 Edit: they just started shipping!
But you need instant reload or you Will fall to your death
he should have made one for the other hand
I love how in the glue section he used Nile reds voice for a part of it
He's showing that becoming a spiderman is possible with the right equipments. 💎☀️
real life gorillatag
are you able to make some instructions for it
You should reload it with the use of canisters and use the formula to shoot webs in a cartridge space which lunks up to get what you want faster but could cost more
6:14 "Looks like he's in need of some help maybe."  *rips him in half*
Nice fish tank bro
rel spidrman👌👌👍
Put another on your other arm
What kind of charging does the webshooter need? I am in Austria and we have 220V. Only way i see that working is if it's USB or something?
You should build 2 for a multi swing thing
Ok in another dimension where all houses, bridges, ceilings are made from wood.... congratulations....U reached the real spiderman😂🎉
web shooter is sell on myanmar?
so awsome
“Who wants to kiss me!! Kiss me!!” He was really feeling the spidey roll 😂
I remember seeing these videos as a kid from trying to create my own web shooters 😂
Gass shouter
bro does no one notice that guy voice from nilered channel?😂
I am a 100 percent sure I heard Nile red
Hopefully in the future they can make something like this it will be fun to use
At this point he is already Spider-Man without the powers..
I want to bu y the webshooter but I need more information like does it come with two can it fit my small hands
if only you could do this without worrying about property damage lol
please make it cheaper 😢
>dude tries to swing like Spider-Man >dude accidentally manufactures retrieval tools for basically any stuck object in any context anywhere, and then a powder-actuated grappler(!!!) Nice.
12:58 spiderman 2 theme intensifies
That's a magnet on a rope or string shooter.. Why you calling it a web shooter?
it would have been better if you can make two shooter for both of your hand and shoot one after another and swing like Spider-Man. BTW i  loved it.
Do a real hulk serum
So you never have to grab the web it just comes out of the webshooter itself and you swing that way. Then you double click to release the web
If you ever watched Spider-Man into the SpiderVerse it a double click to release the web
That was crazy man.
Jlaser Parker
Jetpack
Really puts into perspective how fucking unrealistic a kid making those web shooters are. Like the super powers I can accept but how tf a kid with no money making those
I did not like how you used actual strings but I have an idea that you could mix the nylon and the quick drying super glue spray and before it drys contain it in an air tight space
This is not good, that web shooter throws glue
I want to talk to you Jake laser
It felt like how Peter Parker actually made his web shooters when you mixed the two chemicals..wonder if a chemist could formulate something like Spiderman web fluid. And he was a chemist...huh.
rope shooter duhh
why are you smart than me?😾😾😾😾🤛🤛🤛🤛✊✊👊👊👊
what?🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
😹😹😹😹😹😹✊✊✊✊🤛🤘
Its all fake!!!!

If you’ve ever read Wings of Fire you should make flamesilk and like flamesilk launchers for your wrist
i felt like maybe you could add a wood piece with glue and shoot that it wouldn't be that practical but i think maybe it would work
I would love to see you do a somewhat batman themed video where you design a cloak that has kevlar, can help slow a fall, and maybe make you invisible 👀 I know you can do it!!!
Send me one as a gift?
Yo JLaservideo try to do 2 web shooters and combien them with the climbers that will be crazy

You should make a video where you make a metal nanotech iron man suit
hey i have a queston? if i live in europe would it get delivered?
its good but if u use polymer and 1 million eletric volts u can actuelly make webs
То есть при конструировании подобных шутк мы приходим к двум концепциям. 1) В 21 веке не достаточно технологий, чтобы уместить приблуды человека паука компактно. 2) Нужна супер сила. Связки и мышцы среднего человека врядли выдержут постоянное качание на паутине, то есть нужен еще экзоскелет или сыворотка укрепляющая все ткани организма. То есть человек паук - это философия, а не тупой супергеройский фильм про технологии и медицину. Это философия, что при сильном мозге, должно быть сильное и тело. 2 лет прошло, а так ничего не изменилось)) только не смотрите наверх))   п.с. автоор канала, ты делаешь что то невероятное! Успехов и не останавливайся!
love
make miles morals claok power
Bro really used NileRed voice. So, genius. 😂
can i use them
bro i all ways dreamed about swinging around buildings
Can you do it that you can swing more than one time in the air like spidey I hope your‘re going to continue this project
Instead of making this bro can make a radioactive spider hehe😅
makes spider man wings
Next time when upgrading this thing you should make sure that if an insane guy got his hands on these and tried to jump from a building like the scene from into the spiderverse and wanted to swing like real, you should make sure that works by doing it yourself 😅😈, anyway good job and you are near to become the real spiderman, i think the only remaining things are like the iron spider legs from the back and quick websling ammo restoration time so you dont die mid-air, a helmet or something that detects your eye movements and has real spider since like real spiderman! And i think thats all to become the first real superhero, heck there could be a spiderman for each country with each with his suit creation (probably the one 5 y/o we made?)! So excited for whats next!
At  2:28 u sounded like nile red
Just make a radioactive spider and get bitten
I think he made more of Batmans grappling hook than anything that is amazing either way. He's making himself the first hero
Can you make a falcon suit
Your the forth spider man
I dont how you cam do this but your realy good at this keep up the good work
Bro  those web 🕸 shooters are amazing they top the movies you could be spider man 🕷you shouls show marvel this they woild love it
Cool

2:26 I can identify the voice ( Nile red )
Plz giv me 1
You know you can borrow one of those web pallets from Oscorp , they are really good. Also you can attach it in the dial of a 10$ watch and i guess it should work ? I wonder why you didn't think of that in the first place ?
I hear we need more power alot lol maybe collaborate with Tim the tool man Taylor aka Tim Allen
I want this so bad!
You need to play The Ultimate Spider Lair in VRCHAT if you want to feel the most like you’re swinging as Spider-Man   https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1983563546
uncle ben would be proud
I do not care if you do not like this comment i just hope you have a nice day
can I get one please for free
Parker eventually devised a formula to create his own custom webbing, consisting of salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate.
you should put all the spiderman gadgets you've made together and become spiderman
i would like you to make super man
I would be down to be your stunt man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCOonkQtoeQ REHEHEHE
nilered entered the video
Even if he isn't swinging, that is the coolest web shooter I have ever seen, because it can stick to anything really strong
I’m not much of a fan of Star Wars but make a light saber
So if spider man is made for movie i wish people could make web shooter real life and peoplr swing without any problem
Real life Spiderman
It would be cool if you did a redesign of the mini webshooters with the same technology in the climbers and have a strong enough rope to swing from, maybe even adding a button to the side that can reload the web with the same hand you shoot it with. For optimal swinging
Why dont you build a fire costume
That's not spiderman
*man is closer to the batman grappling hook than to anything else*
Bro i would buy it if you could do an aShipping method to pay at the door because my mom doesn't have card or any other things only cash u would have so much orders with this option ty.
Try swinging from a streat light
What if you become a real spiderman
imma buy those web shooters!
can i get one? please
just got my webshooter and it is SOOO AWESOME
That guy really said 3k of damages for the 2 little holes on that busted old car 😂😂
the price was raised to 54.99
The one and only spider man
Now if only we could find a real chemical solution to make the perfect polymer webing
Ok please sell these. Think of how much children hurt inside knowing your the only one with one of these
make a laser in the shape of a J then there would be two Jlasers
make a    sord
Cool origin story bro.
For the mini webshooter… I would buy it but I’m in Europe so I can’t..
Build a flying basketball
Bros making web serum
instead of using rope and nail use a 2mm thick carbon nanotube cuz that is stronger than steel and then add two buttons. 1 hold to shoot and swing release when u wanna stop using it and it will reload into for another use . 2nd button hold to shoot release to release the web leaving it there detached from the spider gloves and just attachted to the window requires manual reload tho.
Imagine if Spider-Man shoots you with his webs, and instead of your arms getting bound up or something you die of a punctured lung
clicked on the video just so I can block this channel
That is so awesome epic and cool
Respect
Bro you got the great power now do the great responsibility.
Fact: this is not spiderman web shooters but batman's grappling hook gun
in  india it is above 4k Rs.
Can you make it cheaper plsss
if he gives all this gear to hero hero's officially this worlds spiderman (hero's movement exactly like spiderman)
Now all he needs to do is figure out a way to put all his spiderman gadgets into one suit
Can you send me one?
HE MADE WEB FLUID
the next step to becoming spiderman
How fun is it
Great invention. Love the content If u can try and put the thing u use to climb walls on your feet
Does anyone know the original seller of the web shooter?
Can you make a iron man suit in an arc reactor
Make hulk
Ha tagi ko og web shooter
Maybe you should try getting mark Rober to help you
He even looks like peter
It’s cool until he’s gotta hit someone
Can you make the Spider-Man web shooter you make cheaper
is your web shooter on Amazon??? I want to buy it but dont know if its a scam
The spider man web slinging makes me hope Spider-Man may become a reality at this point(minus the legal issues)
if you gave a serial killer this they def would be on a killing spree
Instead of making a web slinger, he made a grappling gun lol
be real, instead of this being a web shooter turn it into the Arkham grapple hook gun, especially with the goal of miniaturizing without any loss in efficiency.
Stan lee would cry
At around 2:30, there was nilered’s voice
Spiderman is my favorite superhero and I have a lot of favorite horses but the mane hero is jeusess.but I really want to be spiderman can you tech me please.and I watch your videos it is amazing 🤩.
Bro is finding ways to make people escape prison
You surely earned a sub and like with this one can't wait to see more, also can't wait to see how good the mini version is.
We’re like 80% of the way there. We just need a few more exotic materials.
Tom Holland Need See this Video
can you the 2 hand pls
this was amazing i only recently got invested in spiderman (with the original movies) and now im thinking... spidy senses like sensors that tell you if theres smth behind you in a helmet combines with the wall climbers and web shooter your practically spiderman at that point
now you just need to chain multiple swings together by using another device on your other arm. Lol
What are the chemicals?
Tbh you couldn’t of mixed all the glue you got in it’ll be very strong
i need that NOW
🎉What are you an engineer in 😮
Iron man repulsor
2:24 amazing action lab reference
Яс Пармен син сонаааааа
try it on glass ;) nah jk this is very epic
If you were to give this man a million dollars he would build a flying car
Yo he should make spiderman 2099
Can you please make Hiccups Flame Sword from How To Train Your Dragon 2, add the flamable/exploding gas pellets, and also make it retractable, so you can just whip out, turn on the flames and go. If that isnt enough content for one video, please make the retractable wingsuit that folds into his leg pockets, would be cool if you could actually fly with them, but if its too hard then just make them for display, just like the falcon wings. Much thanks pls do! :)
jhhuybjp
Whay det You make 2
Can he shoot it in mid air
I have an idea with the web strength say you get 5 extruded tips have one in the center going straight and have the others angle where it will shoot and spin around the center web, I don’t know the full technicality’s of this yet I’m still trying to figure out what to do, any way like a rope they in theory spin around the center and create a rope like thing. Now with the sticking if you manage to make the reaction of the rope delay for long enough if should stick around anything that’s like a pole, this is as far as I’ve gotten with this idea but if you guys think this will help then please try it
He did not build the toy web shooter I bought it 1 year before this video was even released
More Batman than Spiderman but cool nonetheless
lmao
человек паук которого мы заслужили)) это шутка если что
Can you do it in public
It’s 11:40
From where did you get the 1 dollar webshooters
Main thing is we humans do not have the strenght to swing for too long and too high if we figure a way to swing like that for hours we are spider man
U would get 100 % accuracy if u just called it Batman's grappling hook 🤣
Bro thought he could use a NileRed line without us noticing
You made a harpoon gun. Theyre $200+ on Amazon.
Like your mom
You should make a harry potter wond that shoots fire
SPIDER-MAN WEB SHOUTER PLEASE GIVE ME PLEASE PLEASE
Wow I really want the net version to help climb trees.

I broke my leg after this video.
Next you need to do. Two shooter and your climb suit. Also, each shooter needs 2 shots so you have 4 shots in total allowing you to swing up to four times.
Bro nile red jump scared me😂
He made a grapple hook and people think this is inovation?... sad
My mom: I swear I just had 39 dollars in the savings account, I wonder where it went Me: sweating, IM IN DANGER
Me buy me buy right now

Just imagine some day we'll all be able to swing around like spider man, maybe everyone who is alive now will be dead by then but it'll be worth it
For anyone who bought JLasers webshooters, do you guys agree that it’s hard to do anything that involves putting your palm on the ground without setting it off? Lol scared a bunch of people by accident while doing flips
Try make a second one
Bro is the real spider man
Elytra from Minecraft lol
Impact also weakens the magnet
13:20 throwback to the cafeteria scene in Spider-Man 2002
u should make a working iron man repolser
I have a quick question. When you release the web how do you do itvagain and again ?
Plz make Grass web shooters
What's the website called
This is so cool OMG😮
I think that you should buy real webs from spider scientists and make a real web shoter
This is Orem thank you
How did you get the web back
you should try artificial gecko skin and make this again, it is uses vaderball effect to stick to  most things, without actually beng sticky. Veritasium has a video on this i think.
You should totally do deliveries on Mexico
a jetpack
I'd love to see this concept done in a batman style grappling gun
I just bought the web shooter from the shopify store
why are the webshooters so expensive i live in belgium and if i want to buy them i need to pay 81 dollars
Can I have it in India
HOW DID BRO DO THIS WITHOUT DISLOCATING HIS SHOULDER
Send a webshooter to Canada
Can I have that web chuter
make a venom suit
I will like theat for Christmas
that's really cool
how about when you real it in it pulls the grapple back to you so you can reload fast
Bro can become spider man
Now make another one for the other hand and swing from hand to hand.
I NEEEEEED IIIIIIITTTT!!!!!!  *insert SpongeBob meme here*
We are getting close to human super powers.
You should make electro powers or Miles venom blast with tasers and tazergun-like things in a glove
I can’t find it?!!
Make a donut that regens
You need a second one to swing more
I don't  have   those. Multirals😢
I want you to give out free money to every one
what about in indian rupees?
Fish catcher No other snswers
cool i kinda want these
This guy should be the next tony stark
The way you did this could also double for Batman's grappling hook. That thing is no mere hook and we all know it
Mythbusters dunk for good measure
I heard the NileRed bit😂
thars no way you can do this
Make an Iron Man with poster
you make an iron man helmet next
I ordered a couple of your web shooters…the wait for it to say “your order has been shipped” is killing me lol been a week since I placed that order.
So where to buy?😂 Lol
Dude should make it for both hands and swing web to web 😂 that be cool asf
Best vids man!!
This feels more like a Batman product
hey @marvel hire this guy
now he can say his job is to be spiderman
The spiderman in this universe
Dude is literally making fantasies as real as possible
Can you make a spider-Man mask  spider-Man senses
Lol RIP to your buddies spare tire
I could see SWAT and special forces using something like this in the future.
This is like if Batman and Iron man had a baby and that baby wanted to be Spider-man
fghgyjujyhhtgyuyuy i mean cool
itu itu beneran spider-man kah aku mau beli di mana tempatnya
How do you do that web shooter that you can actually swing from a tree in the spider man chapter
are we ignoring the glue sniffing reference at 2:03 😂😂
with great power comes great responsibility
make a holagrame
one of the best spidey things I have seen
Your should play Roblox 😢😊
Can you make one for kids/toddlers?
where to buy
Add everything you made. Like the wall climbers expandable suit and the webs, if it's even possible
Shut up right now. I wanted to peace.
make a dart lancher
Make a Red Hood suit please.
Can you also sell the web shooter from the end that took down the maniqiun for 39.99 dollars and cent it looks so cool but not the nail one the one before the nail one pleeeeaaaaaasssssseeeeeeee 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 🎉❤❤❤❤
😍
it would've been even more cool if you made two of the shooters so you could swing from one to another timing the release aswell!
Can you make a flying facon suit
Can i pls win your web shoter  pls
Make climers in finger tips and toes and you will be Spider-Man
you kinda look like Spider-Man Andrew Garfield not gonna lie
Do the small ones come in pairs
I’M FUCKING SPIDER-MAN
I would love to purchase some of your cool inventions from your webstore.  Lol webstore didn't even plan on that one.
Hearing Niles voice at 2:27 ;)
nile red reference goes crazy
L odateri + unsubbed
Can I buy one
Now make it on both hands 😂😂😂 👇❤❤❤
Holy craup
Where can I buy these?
He should connect the Spider-Man climber and the webs like how he did with the Iron Man suit like he can next them both so basically he can become Spider-Man
JLaser should make a thor hammer that only he could lift up
I don't know if we have the technology for this yet, but you might be able to take the net idea and put a mini screw thing on each of the corners and the middle. You could have sensors sense if you should make the nail go off or not. Also at each cross section of the net you could put some kind of robot that moves to get the net ustuck from trees and retract.
Only if he could find glue
What Tom Holland comment on the video lol
He tought we wouldn't notice Nile Red's voice
NENO TECH 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Ad for  shopify ? Unsubscribe right now... What a shame
Greg finally can get the remote
i nede it for my spid-man costom
put it in amaz
Dude this invention was so amazing❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Stan Lee said that our universe isn't capable of making heroes due to it's limiting physics.  This won't stop us from trying. He wouldn't want us to stop trying! Excelsior, true beliver!
Alternate title, crackhead shoots pipe bomb shaped blow dart to swing on stuff
There is one problem. How are you to get more web quickly? And, how do you remove the web?
BRO WHY WHEN HE SWING DOES IT LOOK LIKE HES JUST PELVICLY THRUSTING IN THE AIR
Stan would be so proud. Amazing!
You should add all of the Spider-Man stuff you made
Never mind
Can you please respond to this what is your website
If he can get it so he just needs to do the release and reel back in only 1 hand then he can get 2 and work as a spiderman
I ordered two and they only sent one, from this company tiny jumps. You cant email them or them. This sucks
The possibilities that could come from a refined version are insane
Bro you could become a irl superhero with youre gadgets
He casually tested it on his fish
please man, use them for good and don’t rebel and become bad.
You should add another one
"with this dart" That's literally a pipe bomb
Tobey Maguire my Spider-Man!! ❤
I need this for this Halloween!  Cuz imma be punk spiderman
bros the new peter parker
bro i loved spiderman as a kid i need this

Real life cw zoom costume please
Awesome dude try making black widows watch
Don’t at me, but I work at a grocery store in a cooler so I stock areas that needs to be stocked. And these pallets I get full of stuff for my cooler area is always wrapped up with plastic wraps, and they always like get in the way whether of how stringy it gets or sticky, but I’ve noticed how stick it can be which I was thinking of using for almost wall climbing (mostly glass) but if they were melted into liquid plastic, and the shooter shot it out wet then dry after it could completely stick to anything and make it thick enough to be swingable. 🤔
Certainly, let's provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide for building the advanced glue delivery device with all the components and features you've described, in the order you specified:  **Step 1: Conceptualization** - Begin with the idea of creating a multifunctional device combining a glue delivery system, cutting mechanism gloves, a retrieval system, and a string catapult for versatile applications.  **Step 2: Design and Blueprint** - Develop detailed blueprints that include all the components:   - A sturdy frame   - A compact web structure (web base)   - Cutting mechanism gloves with integrated buttons and sensors   - Glue reservoirs with precise release mechanisms   - A retrieval system inside the device   - A timer-controlled oil-release mechanism  **Step 3: Gathering Materials** - Collect necessary materials, including:   - Microcontrollers for sensor integration (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi)   - High-tensile strength string material   - Springs suitable for the web structure   - Heating elements, temperature sensors, and small pumps for glue and cohesive substance release   - Durable framework and gloves for integration   - Buttons for gloves and wiring components   - A tiny catapult mechanism with a long string   - Additional rolls of string for reloading  **Step 4: Building the Frame** - Construct a sturdy frame using lightweight and robust materials like aluminum or carbon fiber. - Add mounting points for various components, ensuring stability and durability.  **Step 5: String and Glue Delivery System with Chambering and Loading** - Integrate the strong string-like material into the device for weight distribution. - Design a glue chambering and loading system connected to glue reservoirs, allowing glue to ooze onto the string as it's being fired. - Create a web structure with springs that opens upon releasing the web. - Implement a combined heat mechanism within the web structure, connected to the drying mechanism. - Integrate a precise glue release mechanism into the web structure, including four nozzles for controlled glue distribution onto the string. - Incorporate an oil and rubbing alcohol release mechanism into the web structure, consisting of four nozzles for releasing cohesive substances.  **Step 6: Cutting Mechanism Gloves** - Create gloves with built-in buttons on each palm. - Integrate sensors into the gloves to detect string tension and angles. - Implement an electronically controlled cutting mechanism on each glove.  **Step 7: Retrieval Mechanism** - Integrate a retrieval system inside the device with a weight sensor. - Implement a timer-controlled oil-release mechanism within the device. - Include small pumps for controlled oil and rubbing alcohol release. - Ensure proper plumbing and tubing for cohesive substance release.  **Step 8: Software Logic** - Develop software to control the entire system, including sensors, microcontrollers, pumps, and timers. - Configure the software to recognize different button inputs on the gloves. - Utilize microcontroller libraries and programming languages suitable for the components used.  **Step 9: Swing Functionality** - Utilize the sensors in the gloves to detect swinging motion. - Configure the software to recognize peak swings and allow for the release of the string at the desired moment. - Enable double-tapping of the glove buttons to cut the string and initiate a swing. - Implement a feature that allows holding the button to retain the strings in place.  **Step 10: String Catapult and Loading Mechanism** - Include a tiny catapult mechanism with a long string that holds additional rolls of material. - Implement a loading mechanism for the catapult, allowing for easy insertion of more string. - Design compact and durable web-based bullets (WB bullets) that attach automatically to the string after the prior web base (WB) has detached. - Create a loading system for the web-based bullets to facilitate rapid reloading.  **Step 11: Final Product** - Successfully complete the advanced glue delivery device with cutting mechanism gloves, heat mechanism, web structure, and retrieval system. - Ensure that it fires glue webs with precision, applies hot air for rapid adhesion, and has a retrieval mechanism that operates as intended. - Allow for intuitive swinging, string cutting, string retention, glue delivery, and cohesive substance release functionalities as described.  This comprehensive guide outlines the construction of a multifunctional device that combines existing components and technologies to achieve the desired functionalities in the order specified, ensuring a versatile and precise multifunctional tool for various applications. Always prioritize safety and responsible use when working on such projects.
If you combine the catapult thing you made with the a strong string like material, you can create a web like mechanism that opens and releases glue instantly as its fire enough to stick, if you build something like how bullets are for it where it's a webbed look and allows for accuracy of the webst to hit, and instead of it being 1 string that attaches and detaches, the webs should have a mechanism that cuts the string, the super good that you made will ooze down each string that fired, a automatic loading system that loads the embed mechanism load onto the string as a motor pulls the string into it so when the string is cut, a new one is loaded onto the next line of string continuously like firing a gun, it should fire as hard as a paint ball gun a and there should be a air mechanism  that heat blow dries the glue allowing for extremely fast.

I have ordered the web shooter but why hasn't it arrived? It said it will arrive after 20 days and it still hasn't arrived?
Are you able to trying making actual sticky and strong webs using the nylon and rat trap glue?
Can I have your web shooter?😢❤
I have no doubt that this man will be spiderman 🕸
5:43
OMG its... its... Slipknot the man who can climb anything
Great job Batman!
Hi can you give us a 20% discount if you do thank you so much!
What Spidey uses in the comics it’s just some really thick string with some liquid concrete on the top
Excellent result! True, for now we are making holes in materials, in wood or maybe plastic beams. Of course, this method is not suitable for metal structures, as well as for brick and concrete walls. But the holding power is impressive! However, the true mechanism for shooting a rope or web still needs to be sought in the area of ​​gluing to any materials. Easy to say, hard to do 😂 In any case, you’re great! 👍💪
**Enhancements to the Spider-Man Suit:**  1. **Crazy Glue Pores:** Incorporate tiny pores on the robot's hands to serve as a controlled release mechanism for a specialized "crazy glue." This adhesive would be used for surface attachment.  2. **Concoction for Bond Release:** Integrate a storage system for a scientifically developed concoction designed to rapidly dissolve the glue. Upon activation, this concoction would allow the robot to detach quickly from surfaces.  3. **Hair-Based Adhesion:** Implement tiny hairs on the robot's fingertips to extend and push the glue from the pores, creating a strong bond when in contact with surfaces.  4. **Concoction Release:** Ensure that the tiny hairs retract after surface attachment, simultaneously releasing the bond-dissolving concoction. This process facilitates effortless detachment.  5. **Heating System:** Install a controlled heating system within the fingertips. This system can be activated when rapid detachment is required, expediting the release process.  6. **Cooling System:** Incorporate a cooling mechanism into the gloves to prevent overheating during rapid detachment, ensuring optimal temperature maintenance.  **Enhancements to the Spider-Man Gauntlet:**  1. **Flexible Metal Construction:** Construct the entire suit using flexible metal scales, similar to those on fish or snakes, to maintain both flexibility and strength.  2. **Sign Language Activation:** Program a sign language interface for web-shooting preferably the Spider-Man web firing signal he does in a movie, Specific finger positions trigger web release. Upon gripping the web, the cohesive claw remains attached until the user's hand fully opens, initiating glue dissolution based on feedback.  3. **Refilling Mechanism:** Include a gauntlet wrist section with a refilling mechanism. This system replenishes both super glue and unbinder components upon claw retraction.  4. **Ample Binding Fluid:** Ensure the gauntlet can store six times the amount of binding fluid for extended use.  **Enhancements to the Spider-Man Gauntlet:**  1. **Three-Point Claw:** Design a gauntlet with a three-point claw mechanism for secure surface attachment. The claw is fired using compressed CO2 air and is spring-loaded for trajectory.  2. **Automatic Spring Open Claw:** Develop a claw that automatically opens upon firing, resembling a web-like structure. This design enhances grip on surfaces.  3. **Crazy Glue Release:** Implement pores on the claw to dispense the specialized "crazy glue" upon impact, securing the attachment effectively.  4. **Unbinder Release:** Incorporate a mechanism for releasing the bond created by the glue, ensuring effortless detachment when needed.  5. **Braided String Combination:** Equip the gauntlet to launch a braided string combination consisting of three strong fishing lines. Each set of three lines is attached to one of the claw's points, resulting in a total of 18 durable fishing line strings for two gauntlets.  6. **Retraction Mechanism:** Integrate a powerful pulley system into the gauntlet for quick claw retraction. This system includes gears and pulleys and a strong motor inside the gauntlet the clock should be extremely skinny when closing through attract for rapid retrieval. each claw should be two inches long with a webbed design connecting the claws upon open, and strong material least on the claws perfectly so when it opens it has a better chance at connecting.  7. **Refill Components:** Include a compartment within the gauntlet for refilling the cohesive glue and unbinder components, ensuring readiness for future use.  8. **Web-like Design:** Opt for a web-like design for the claw to add aesthetics and functionality, allowing for multiple points of attachment and increasing stability.  These enhancements, combined with the flexible metal construction, create a versatile Spider-Man suit and gauntlet that enable controlled web-shooting, secure surface attachment, and effortless detachment. Builders can follow these instructions for successful construction.
Now do a double swing with both hands!
At 2:26 I hear Nile Reds voice😂
I have blueprints for working web shooters, but don’t have the supplies sadly. They aren’t as chunky, but might actually work really well.
I say make a video dedicated to trying to recreate Spiderman's web
Wait but if you use it on both hands it will literally work no?
You could make wolverine claws
Please can I have the  web shooters  and the wall climber I will pay 800
Just got the spider man web shooter on Amazon and let me tell you, it was worth every penny
What about two shooters
you should definitely start selling spring rings, ive wanted something like that for years
Now imagine sticking to a criminal
IDK, but that reminds me of the Batman trigger, so I would like you to do it please, I think it will be interesting.
Everything just perfect, except, we need a reporter that keep calling spiderman a menace
Returning thor hammer
Swing from a walk and then end the swing grabbing onto a wall
Try swinging across a gap
Try siwgin on a building and siwin inf times in a row
Your webshooters got severely ripped off on Amazon. There are so many copycats now on Amazon.
I want to become Spider-Man to
love the nile voice over gag
Please please please never lose your motivation, you could actually do this
POV: Gwen falling Peter Trina save her Peter “I got you” Gwen “aaaaaaaaaa”
Inspirational, truly if dedicated you can do what you love and be happy
Might need one
you can make it! soon you will become an actual spiderman!
Is it possible to make a car hovering at least a few inches off the ground. That'd be a cool video.
Send me the web shooters ❤😊
0:42 gotta love the edits
Can you send me the web shooter
Yo the bike red reference 😂😂
Great 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Plot twist, buildings are made of concrete…great video 😊
This is probably the closest real spiderman we actually get.
2:25 he turned into nilered for a second
Bro will actually be Spiderman if he comnines this with is spiderman climbing suit
What is the name of the chemicals
Make a full spider man suit with wll climb and swing and glue spurt
100% from fortnite 😂
Your my favorite youtuber!!
nvm i fixed it its awesome
(PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING WEBSHOOTER TOY) I thought the webshooter toy would be the perfect toy to play around with! Well I was terribly wrong I first off waited 2.5 weeks for this webshooter to ship to canada, reasonable shipping time but when I received this webshooter I was simply unamused by the packaging for it was crumbled and how it looked rushed. within the 2 minutes of me enjoying the web shooter the shooter jammed! I tried fixing the problem myself but was unseccesfull. I will say I am very dissapointed for spending 80$ for shipping and for the toy itself just for this flimsy piece of junk to break. I would not recomend to anyone to but this product by JLazervideo yet I am excited to see what you make in the future!
*freinds text him* what are you doing? Swinging around in my garage.
where do you get it
what if buy one
I cant help but be reminded of that material that imitates gecko skin somehow being used in a project like this, maybe have them release and grip on impact, although I don't know if that the material is readily available.  Edit: I looked it up and the material can be manufactured fairly inexpensively. I think a triad of gecko tape surfaces deployed on impact 120° apart could be able to hold a human weight if each pad made enough contact. Which could be further enabled by structuring with some sort of fractal grabbing design or something similar to achieve maximum contact.
2:25 nahhhh jit turned into NileRed THATS CRAZY
how much is this can i buy bro
Pls make a hulk buster suit
Nillered shows up
Silver Surfer
hahahaha 😍😓
I LOVE IT. but please dont make it $40.00 thats to exspenes
Make two of thease maybe swing around nee York after that..!
Someone actually trying to invent a spidider web it looks like a real web too i saw it on tikto
Where/how do I get more mini magnets for the web shooter he sells
This is batman tech. Cool as can be.
The "I was able to pull out some white goo" got me
Is thw one being sold on Amazon also yours? Or is it a copycat
I thought I heard nile red for a second
Hey can you tell how to build the edf's that you used to make iron man suit please I want to make the armour  with advancements , I will tag you and send you all videos
Please make a second one and swing from rope to rope! That would blow my mind completly i think. This is already fucking crazy though!!!
I love this
Dis no one notice the nilered cameo voice? 2:24
This guy is getting closer and closer to becoming a true irl superhero and in our hearts he already became that but will he master the power
If I remember my chemistry correctly, the propogation reaction of polycyanoacrylate (superglue) is terminated by the acidic monomer of nylon and the propogation reaction of nylon is terminated by the carbanion in the propogation intermediate of polycyanoacrylate, which is probably why they don't work the best together.
Your so close, next step is the Empire State Building!
I want some
cool
how would know that rat trap glue is what Spiderman used the whole time?
Nahhh bro made a grapple glove 💀💀💀💀
There is a channel with a website selling the web shooter on your website for a more expensive price of around $68 called WebXentral and they are saying they ,are it
🤔😮😱
It’s all fun and games until the damn warehouse roof falls😂
Dang u should build a time portal now
Spider man swings for real he just does it in a fake way in a fake universe
Make a thaonos infinitely gaulnt
Does anyone feel jealous wanting to hawe these stuff aswell 😂 its so cool it makes me jealous
Make a beyblade control with voice
Try to make it like a m1n!gun
medas un lanza telarañas de spider man  porfa Bor
Hi
I got the web shooter and I use it to get soda cans 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:25 did i just hear rile red there?
this is his Canon event
They could have made a Batman grapple gun the same way
Nope, just a glorified GRAPPLE SHOOTER ….. NOT A WEB SHOOTER but still good try. 😂😂😂 It’s the truth people, Web shooters shoot webs that stick and tie up enemies and more uses not ropes that tangle around objects. But thanks for inventing the shooter. But needs work with WEB FLUID AND PERFECT THE WEB FLUID FORMULA….. takes time but needs to be done or else give up this project….. That’s just me being Huge fan and perfectionist. Sorry but all this is true.
Seriously this looks SO much like Spiderman in real life.
Marvel is proud of you, my man 😂.
Who noticed Nilered words😂
you need Physics, Chemistry and Biology to understand, also technology will included !
We need pt 2
I really want one
I'm gonna show this video to anyone who says that comics and cartoons are for kids. Absolutely insane, dude
That's looks so much fun
YOU SHOULD MAKE A MOVIE
"we made a capsule" what a lovely euphemism for an enclosed sealed pipe with some explosive and a nail in it 😘
You ned to make two of them and swing from one to another!
Bro became NileRed for a sec 💀
I want to be like him spidey
I need this I love spidey
I would buy this 😊😊😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😂🌚🌞🌝🐽🐗🐗🐗🐗🐗🐗🐗
The new tony stark.... bro created everything
That’s deadass wild that you created this I’m so glad you did this you cured a child hood need
Máje two web Shooters Its ne cool
Jalaser can you please make a homade spiderman movie where make suits
how do you poop it off
“I’m literally covered in goo” Ayooooo
To really make web fluid you need nylon chemical and fiber and once it hits the air it turns into a strong compound
next project: weapon manipulation like angelina jolie's weapon in marvel eternals 🛐
Dude was literally moving an entire car
Do you have to take the nails, rope and magnets out of the roof each time or do you have spares on you
Make a web trap
i FEEL LIKE law enforcement would be interested in the projectile tangling net. They need this! NO MORE RUNNING CHASES OR GUNFIGHTS. WHEN IN range and they bolt .USE THE WEBNET! also the PROPER TERM for the "websack" is called the "spinneret". between you and the guys at hacksmith. its only a matter of time before someone becomes a super villain and you will all be forced to come together to beat them! and that shall be known as the dawn of the SUPERHERO!
Spidey shoots, then grabs on, then swings. He never releases half-way through the arc of the swing. Hes wlways holding it directly.
Wont that friggin pop the tire though?
The white goo was said by nilered
Im may be getting it do you need your own glue
😮😮😮😮😮😮
People are stealing your web shooters and selling them for an upped price on different websites😢😢
The moment I heard the way he spoke about the chemical mixture I was like "Nile Red?" And then Nile came on.
Now we just need to see if multiple webs can fit in the web shooter.
Yes it got insanely far 1:03
Hey spiderman can you please stop blowing holes into our buildings
can you make me a spider man
You should try to swing across two two story houses.
Hes sounded like Nile red
Make a grappling hook
With a few more years of engineering I thing spider man could actually be real.
I have an idea : swing with the swing thing to a wall and Then stick to the wall and Maybe if you make two swing things you can swing further
😮
❤
Yooo thought for a moment I saw George Russel as Spider-Man!
Imagine he had 2 swinger and those stickers
Kinda disappointed to see you becoming a drop shipper as well, that web shooter is the same one all over Taobao that you can get for around 24-25 USD, just without your logo on it. Come on dude, you're better than that...
Make claws that you can climb stuff with
Thats not web shoter thats just homemade grablinghook whit littlepit scorpione vibes. Dont get me wrong thats cool but its not webshooter
You should make real omni directional mobility gear from the anime attack on titan :)
Stuff like this is the whole reason I want to be an engineer
Wait how did you get that much money to buy those much things?
Is the strap adjustable on the “ after the mini version web shooter”Not the 4 shooter, the single one after
bro this is literally smt big hero 6 would do- that's craaazy dude
isnt it gonna make a dent in ur ceiling?
Hey this may be weird or Something but i think i have Something that can work the only thing is that i dont have materials or know how to construct this i have a plan and if you want to il give it im not sure if it is goin to work but if you have discord i can tell you how if you want and sorry if it doesnt work
LMAOOOOO
u can add the other web slinger (the one with the magnet or the suction cup) to the other hand. one hand for swinging and one for attacking.
2:27 was that yeah jaron?
I just want the dart lol
another on the left arm for a double swing... wouldn't that be amazing 😁
That Niall Red comeo was hilarious 😂
This is amazing! What do you need to study to be able to build stuff like this?
😢Thank you very much, I can now become Spider-Man. Please, but I only need a lot of equipment
It would be sick if he could add the same retract mechanism that the suction cup web shooter has from his website
search how to make the web fluid from spiderman homecoming then just make a web shooter that will hold the fluid
The NileRed reference was awesome 😂😂
Spider-Man have two web shooters not one i love the web shooter
Bro, your creating the avengers in real life, this is insane
Dam the determination it is amazing
Spectacular. This is why l like young innovative minds. They don't have old College Professors to tell them these things are impossible.
If you really think abt it, if ur smart enough u really could become spider man and I believe he would be able to achieve that goal
Pretty close to the 3D Maneuver gear from "Attack on Titan" you could try that one
"I was able to pull out white goo" 2:23
P
Can I have one😂
Please free Spider-Man Web shooter
Spiderman??.. .. U meant some real life AOT gear! That thing is sick! Nice!
there is a guy who seems like hes buying your mini web shooters then painting over your logo and reselling them for 65 and one of his shorts had your logo that he forgot to paint over and he dissembled comments on it so no one makes fun of him reselling your creation
Guys what if you put poison or peper spray in the lighter web shooter
Why don't you make a working green lantern ring
OMG YAAAS right at my Spiderman hype! Def going to get your webshooters!!! This is SO cool man!!
2 things you should do 1 make a way to reload fast 2 make an exoskeleton that will make you stronger so you can have the full power set
Epic! Ima get myself a couple of them
Ben10
Hey man please GET A PATENT I see so many other ones like the one you are selling on shorts so many people copied yoh
your should haved used magnet fishing equipment.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=slFc54RuLm8&feature=shareb 4:33 😐😐😐
But it only sticks to wood?
society: spiderman doesn't exist earth 1218 peter:
Make something that sticks on the wall
His parents must be proud
He’s the next spiderman🎉 of the spider verse
Bro secretly is Peter Parker
I do not have amazon but can you just give it to me for free
6:30 I think the police already use something similar to that
2:20 Unleashing his inner NileRed
When you buy it does it come with the net
Should I buy it I got 75$ rn
Nice web shooters i need some too
YOUR web shooter? Ah nah what did JlaserVideo do?
Where is the description ?
is there delivery to the uk?
bro transcended life
These are legit the retractable web shooters from jlaservideo but for 30 ish dollars more
oh my god... SPIDER-MAN IS REAL!
Where can I buy this?
vr
Btw man a guy ripped of your product
Your so cool I have a spider man web shooter is from Disneyland is cool but yours is more cooler than my 😢❤❤
White goo 🤤
U should have made 2 and so u could swing twice still cool tho
Plz plz plz can I have a web shooter
Yo I think they copied u https://youtube.com/shorts/BQ_8wM9Ugkg?feature=share
Someone made a video on July 4 2023 with the same web shooter’s selling it for 60-45 dollars they look and do the same thing this is the Channel https://youtube.com/@WebXentral
Now all it needs is a second one for your other arm and a way to store multiple shots. That was you would really be able to swing continuously.
Take my money!!!!!!!
Make hawk eye wings that Actually make you fly
Make Hockey wings that actually make you fly
Make  Hockey things that actually make you fly
Wait I think I saw the exact same version in jlaservideo video
are there 2 web shooters
@JLaservideo I know how you can get it out but it will cause damage   to the surrounding area  but you can retract it  you need a chemical reaction to expand from the hole  to open up to release and crack the stone and ir wood from there pull it out  and bam  you can retract there you can essentially chain the  shots  solimg as you have the  cast chemical mixture from drstone platnum. Where ms gorilla  used it
try it on high buildings
Jlaser has a better webshooter for $40
double it then swing consecutively
Neil read
This guy will assemble the avengers.
Can you do a video about the web shooters you sell?
i wish i was this smart and rich to afford all this equipment
Does the web shooter come with 2 or no
Bro showed us how to make a super powerful devils toothpaste which could probably make a bomb and bro won’t show us how he made that lil spider man tool
This guy belongs in the Spiderman movie. Not these pansies Hollywood people. 😆
I  am geting web shooter
Bro is gonna make the avengers irl
Could you make a tutorial on how to make one
bro is him
I have been seeing the same design on amazon for a higher price a the logo removed amazon explain
"The Greatest" invention of the human history
This dude is so close to become spider man
😮
that was so cool
You should make a Batman grappling gun
This is more like batman
Can u use anythig apart from magnets not everything is metal
So nobody noticed at 2:26 he used a nileRed Reference?
Uses for friend instinct was to climb on
Can you stick on walls
This is more like Batman's grappling hook than Spiderman's web. Still cool, nonetheless.
can you try to make the spider man wing suit? or a miles Morales invisibility cloak suit?
For the release mechanism, consider the three-ring release system from skydiving parachutes! Wouldn't wind up the rope but could be useful for very quickly and reliably disconnecting from it (since that's exactly what it's used for in skydiving)
try to swing with it from a scyscraper to scyscraper
wheres my drone
It would be cool to see him do laser vision that can melt metal
Make to web shooters
Bro took the "anyone can wear the mask" line in spider-verse too seriously
The moment you said "something really cool happens" I knew the reference was coming up lol
So our web shooter broke in the first week of using it. I can fix it myself but I need to know what wind-up motor and what gear to order. I have tried to contact someone multiple times and have not gotten a response. If anyone know what motor or gear I should order that would be great.
are the web shooters still on sale? sorry I watched this awhile ago and I think I might finally be able to get them if they're on sale- and the link is being weird
Next project make the toilet chair with proper flushing from the Simpsons 😂
❤cool
Woww
All he needs is 2k and he can make an almost exact replica
Make a vulture wing that can fly
What if we are new  and get it for free?
Now you got to make two
Hey are you gonna think about selling these?
Make rocket boots
Saving civilians with a webshooter with nails is not a good idea
Try a sniper gun😂
This is more of batman
Second Hand Second Video
IDEA CAN YOU MAKE A SPRING RING CAP SHEILD???
If someone tried to rob him they'd end up getting robbed
Can I grab my enemys legs and pull them down
venom was cooler
dude i got the web shooter its cracked
And yet there’s still people who wonder why women live longer then men
Spider man ✖ Attack on titan ✔
wow hes selling these
can you make the assassins creed hidden blade
you should sell a full package of swing and wallclimbers to the military lmao
The net shooter should totally be an essential tool for every police officer.
New Spider-Man in the spider verse I call you science Spider-Man bc you make a lot of science
The second prototype with the net would be an amazing self-defense tool. On the plus, you could market it towards police as an alternative to Tazers as well as a means to end foot chases with violent criminals. @JLaservideo
Blud thinks he's spiderman 😭😭🔥
Could you where all the spidey gear and use them
Our earth will finally get its own Spiderman soon.
I know make a sonic shoes
Does this count as a gun that shoots a smaller gun that shoots on hit?
What am I making next?
What weight capacity does the retail shooter have  Edit: nvm I looked it up
Now you need to make another one on ur other arm so u can ceep swinging
Anyone else wanna see him have a avengers styled battle where he uses his gadgets to beat someone stronger than him
We got Two Pioneers, TheHacksmith and JLaserVideo
Next video: Today I made a working infinity gauntlet!
that s lookin lika batman dude not spiderman
spring ring is needed
Bro needs to try it on a tree
12:57 casual spare tire pop
Is someone going to tell him he's Batman???
2:25 - 2:27   sounds A LOT LIKE nilered
It blows my mind how like he wouldve never been able to just get down that high, that easy, without the webshooters. Worlds first real life superhero in the making.
keep the homie that lets you shoot nails into their car around, man. Incredible!
You can web to a small building, possibly if you try
Can you make it for free please just for one day and see how many people can buy it please please please please please please please please I’m begging you and everybody else is who will subscribe and like if you do
Can I have it? I am 10 years old and I have been loving Spider-Man Spider-Man suit and yeah so if you could just help me the Spider-Man suit and the web shooters, that would be great❤😊
Spider man miles
The fact that he can now sell web shooters, who knows what else you could buy?
Bro sell captain America shield
Now you need to get one on your other hand
Try to make Ironman repulsors flying Gadget
NileRed Colab?
can you deliver to Brazil please web shooter
can you deliver to Brazil please web shooter
can you deliver to Brazil please web shooter
😢can you deliver to Brazil please web shooter
😢can you deliver to Brazil please
13:37 we all men think the  Exact same thing in mind
robot suit that can climb buildings
looks a lot like the aot final season odm gear
Next up: "I genetically modified myself with Spider-Man's powers."
Jason rrtgy lol afhhj vs f yuuu
He needs to work for the military
wow i also want it but sadly i dont live in your country
Is it just me or is this more like batman grappling hook shooter than spidermans webshooter? 🤣🤣
now just combine this with the wall climbers and the  iron spider suit
I heard the NileRed hahaha
Just like you made a iron man suit.. make something like transformers suit 😅idk what I'm saying at this point
Now you need another one on the ofher hand so you can swing the whole warehouse
Jlazer is almost becoming Spiderman. Back when he used to make web shooters back in the day. And the hacksmith is almost becoming a Jedi. Back from when he used to make lightsabers back in the day. SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING???????
If it grabs your balls... scary....
The idea of becoming a Jedi seems cool. If It's not too dangerous, could you try?
Please sell me I need two bodies my favorite marvel character is Spider-Man so please
thats insane now imagine a big wood warehouse two swingers the wall climbers alot of practice and a pro swinger
Bros the real spider man, a dream I've had for so long🕷
Bro, man is gonna start saving lives!!
Dude needs another on the other hand and while swinging shoot the second one and release the first
and 6:29
at 6:06 you cinda made a cacher insted of a wep slinger
can i have the one that's black and has a Butten
make two
please start delivering in romania i want to buy one but i live in romania :(
You should teach the sheild labs as to how to make it. I believe you're more spidey than any actors ever will be. You're genius enough to make web shooters and you have brown hair.
2:20 HE JUST LEAKED WHAT SPIDERMAN DID IN SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING!
I hope sometime soon we can see the spring ring on the shop as well
So tuff!!!!
Ayoo at the  start he shoots white sticky substances
8:31 that's what she said
imagine spiderman but instead of shooting webs at your hands he can crucify you
bro
Yo you should try to make the 3d maneuver gear from attack on titan 👀
Can you buy one of those web shooters please cause I wanna see if I can be Spider-Man because I have a Spider-Man suit which is for my swimming class but can you buy me this Spider-Man one too please
2:29 lmao Nile red
THIS IS SICK NOW ALL HE NEEDS ARE SPIDER SENSE AND SUPER STRENTGH BUT THATS ANOTHER STORY ANYWAYS GOOD JOD
Bro that would most definitely be his homemade suit lol
Hey, do you ship the web shooters to South Africa.
And try and make a quick way to reload
Odm gear thoughts
Pls we need it
Can u publish ths
i can imagen spies using this
sell these fs
Make a spider man webs that make a veonom ink
He made webshooters like Peter Parker in homecoming did...might've been a different movie but still.
Bro you can be a real super hero just do it
his videos are really disappointing
The tech can be used to also make real life ODM gears.
The rope was a it yellow, he could have spray painted it white to look more like a we other then that SUPER COOL
Can you order this in finland?
Can you make spider sense
This guy should definitely be on the FBI watchlist
Your hardwork is my motivation bro 🔥🔥
So cool! If possible you should try to add a quick release to the rope mechanism instead of letting it unravel all the way. Also you should make a second web shooter for the other hand, also find out a way to make the web shooter retract if you can
make a thing you can stick to your hands to stick to stuff, and you bouta be spiderman
If possible, try making this on both hands that way u can actually keep swinging!
Bro he’s pretty much just made ODM gear from attack on titan that’s so fucking cool
He quite literally made his own web fluid   We got Spider-Man #2 over hete
Dude you should make odm gear from Aot
I feel like Alan pan is gonna make an angry rebuttal video about this
2:23 Hope your voice gets better, sounds like you had Nile Red stuck in your throat
Just give this to Nick pro and we got spidey
I bought the web shooter and it’s SOOOOOO COOL 11/10
BRO MAKE TWO AND LITERRALLY BECOME SPIDER MAN YOU CAN SWING with one, detach and use the other repeat and ure spidey
imagine Hero Dw with these
You may not possess the speed of fictional heroes, but you still possess the power, hence making you OUR hero. Thanks dude, you've inspired me to change the world.
why dont you use like a extreeemely strong suction cup at the top of the rope, and be able to swing, detatch it quick, reload before you finish swinging with the other arm, yk, it wont put holes to anything and im pretty sure there would be some way for a suction cup to hold....   i found that there were self retracting lifelines, maybe that could be of use? (just a pitch)
Give this man NASA's Budget and we will conquer the star system in 10 years tops.
This proves that anything is possible, and you dreams can come true.
Imagine spider man using ur swinging web shooter on bad guys 😂
This is so Cool!
Nah that's more like batman's
Spider man earth-1218
I WANT  THAT 😮😮😮
At this point marvel should hire him to make their props
Spiderman ❌ Spider Ranger ✔️
Gause spike
Ima kid
Can you buy another web shooter so I can have one because I don't have that much money I only have 10 dollers
Next make… a iron spider suit
Make some more Marvel stuff! There’s lots of gadgets that I can’t think of right now that you should attempt to try
-10 years later- NEWS: Unknown superhero closely resembling spiderman emerged out of nowhere pulling a car from falling down.
How are you so good at making web shooters
Bro don't use the reel to it's full potential
hear me out, power prowler gloves
And marvel said this earth had no spider-man. As if
DOOM SHOULDER FLAMER
"Hahaha, Dance monkey" - Jake 2023
"When I grabbed it, I was able to make white goo" -Jlazervideo 2023
this is insane. in a good way tho :)
He could make a webshooter that has all of them in one webshooter so that he could activate the one he needs for the specific material he's attaching to or any situation
Put the net shooter on the other arm and you can swing into a wall and use your climbers to stick to it and then use the net shooter to grab something and retract it to you
Try making spider man’s web wings. Thank you.
Wow the first time I’ve actually been like on board with a functional web shooter, dude incredible job
If he attached the rope launcher anchor to the side of his hip he could make it look more of an intentional design by adding some under arm flaps like some of Stan Lee's wing suite design renditions.
he is HIM
this would actually make an amazing grappling hook
This is more like the Assassin's Creed Syndicate grappling gauntlet instead of Spidermans webshooter
just connect the sticky string to a nail then shoot the nail out of the nail shooters
This dude is gonna be the real spider man in a few years
Dude just also made Batman's grappling gun.
this is amazing.  it would be cool if you could shoot more than one time and the web maybe disoved after some time.  PLS dont leave it at this
@WebShooter
“I was able to pull out some white glue” 😂
Can you make a small impact grappling hooks to put on the spider man web slinger that you sell with cavalar cord so you can grab it to climb. I would do it my self but I’m not smart enough and I don’t have the money to buy the stuff please and if you do it could you send me one out please
this is to people who have bought the web shooters                 is it good quality?
him and hacksmith would survive a zombie apocalypse
The NileRed cameo
This man and I Did A Thing need to team up
Man made odm gear
when spider man shoots web it does not stays sipder man holds it so it doesn't fly
Grapple hook
how far does it go
You are silly
He took nilered's video
why did no one mention that this sounds like nile red 2:25
The strongest spider web belongs to the Darwin spark spider, and the spider weighs roughly .5 grams and can shoot its web roughly 80ft. If the proteins are isolated than it could possibly be recreated, and if it's scaled up to the weight of a person it could hold together well enough to swing from. All that would be needed is to create a webshooter that acts like the silk gland. I would love to see something like this irl
can i have free wep shooters plss i am saying this for 7 years:((
He might ACTUALLY be spider man   - climbing wall - making web fluid - shooting webs - swinging on webs - super strength - super speed (other gadgets) (He’s only got spider sense left and if he keeps this up he will be the new spider man)  It’s all coming together 🕸️
Use all your spidey gadgets and you are literally spider-man
make a thor hammer
ASSASSIN'S  CREED HIDDEN BLADE  !!!
the next tony stark
GRAPPLING GUNNNNN 🫨🫨🫨
Bro will you please ship your product to India please 😢 . There is no option for my country please
Do u sell this on ur shop?
Hey, I have an idea with the first design. Mix an activator agent and the super glue in each of the chemicals so that when they combine, it sprays out and activates.
Stop giving the U.S. military ideas. They have people for that.
Now a second double barrel webslinger
Bro is literally becoming every superhero
That is the COOLEST thing Ive ever seen!
jlazer i love you bro im getting your webshooter two but WHY CANT YOU TELL ME HOW TO DO FUN STUFF LIKE THIS
Damn i wish you guys were selling somme of these
You should do the thing where spidey hangs upside down and then lowers himself, kinda like the Mj kiss scene with toby maguire
Bro Spiderman is my favorite super hero ever if you can make more things for us to buy that would be great
😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😧🧐
Now make your hands and feet be able to stick on walls
If you are a scientist, why don’t you mix the chemicals that Spider-Man did in the movie to make webs and then put it in the web shooter is that possible?
My man went from web shooter to man catcher to gun real fast
Is this web shooter gonna be around at Christmas time
You should use every glue  mixed
now try to swing from a wall to a wall
Spider-Man wish version
You should make flyable falcon wings
It would be beautiful if he was able the get the stunt double and actual characters to try them
Webshooter not available in india 😢 plz make it available 😢 🙏
Thank you so much for making    the web shooters they are awesome,mine just came in this morning and I tested them out and it was worth the forty dollars they shoot pretty far and stick to well, so in the words of Tom Holland THANKYOU 😁
The net is the coolest thing I've ever seen
make a stormbreaker that (somehow) comes to you and does something with electricity  EDIT: you could probably put the webs to good use in the millitary
make a peace of paper that eraese right when you right on it
you should make  a desk what comes out of the wall
Has this guy met up with Jack smith yet? Cuz together they would be unstoppable bro
AW MAN i wish i could try this by any chancew
Make a peter quill mask
Hey, just ha a little idea about the idea, why didn't you put the rewind switch closer to the palm? Like so you could do it all with one hand. Might've been an engineering issue but I was wondering. Let me know if there was an issue with the design, which is why you didnt use it.
You should swing from a building with that
Is there anything that can be reused? Like how Spider-Man shoots multiple webs.
This is amazing, now all you need is a radioactive spider
try to make odm gear
Dude you NEED to make a second one and try a double swing!!!
2:25 is that NileRed I hear?
bruh used a NileRed video
3:33 that’s the exact same as a wad of chewing gum
When it’s done put It up for sale I wanna buy the finished thing
Can I get a free spider-man web shooter
OMG 🤯 that was incredible...
Everytime i watch this guy im beyond impressed. W engineer
💡 What if u didn't need to reel it in? Idk if it would work, but what if you used one of those lasers thst can measure the distance between ur hand and the wall, then u could make it code that measurement into the webshooter and it would shoot out  that distance of rope maybe plus an inch or 2 of slack so u can properly swing
combine your web shooters with your other spider man gagets
Nice use of NileRed too
Full iron man suit
You have to genuinely be one of the smartest people alive today
i cant bro your BRAIN IS TO SMARTTTTT *TRIGGER*
So we not gonna talk about the glue part ?
2:26 bro sounds like nile red, anyways keep up the work
Put all the marvel stuff on your store
Plz combine all your spider man stuff
stick to glass
My man you literally used this web swinger just like in the spiderman movies love it
That's a p1pe B0mb launcher
Now imagine him with Stark knowledge, budget and technology *Boom, we have Avengers*
Actually sticks  ^.             🕸️                             I
Now make another one and go web to web
This is amazing . we need MORE irl spider man content !
so i bought the web shooters that u were selling, shooting it alot of times at my magnet door, well..when i went to sit down and shoot...it got tangled or something, it was working just fine still i sat down, and i didnt even use force to sit, i just calmly sat down and it barely shoot, i tried fixing and it worked...kinda, but i think u should help me fix it if u can
at first i thought he meant the magnet was 600 pounds edit: fun fact; my friend put a literal rat trap in my hair
No joke they should make a comic book spiderman thats as close to our reality as possible just like this
I love the nile red reference when he mixes the chemicals 😂
Amazing!!!  Just as a side note, have you considered using something like artificial gecko skin? I have no idea whether it would actually work but it might be worth trying out. Possibly you could put strips of it in a cross formation with the rope attatched to the middle so that pulling on the rope also pulls the strips inwards and generates adhesion? idk
Legend
The nail sticking mechanism reminds me of I did a thing's bullet hammer
Bro literally sounds like mark rober and nile red
where did you get the mannequin?
Bros boutta battle the green goblin
"They sell it at a store. It can't be *that* dangerous." With reasoning like that, how can we lose? (Safety glasses *on*, Kids) 😂😂
He made me say this is awesome out loud
I need one!!
Can I get some
I think if you had two web shooter you could shoot attach swing shoot the second one and release the first one if you think it would work try it out ❤
An idea: make two of these get a warehouse with a large ball pit incase you fall and swing twice in one like spiderman
With the nails its more like ODM gear
did i hear nile red's voice for a sec? xd
im dissapointed that noone in the comments noticed this 2:25
ok but if i buy the web shooter can it hold my weight and if not how much can it hold
this dude is the first ever real life superhero!
Next time you should run and jump off a ledge AND THEN shoot it and swing+realease
Build Alladins flying carpet 🪽🪽!!!!
I am imagining the scene where gwen is falling and you do manage to grap on to her, but this is your web shooter
can u make it so the web pulls out after a click of a button and u can use it nonstop with a second web shooter
grappling hooks:
How long is the web shooter
I just bought the web shooter  like 2 days ago, and it arrived today, and it is so cool to use😅
where is the lip of faith?
you look and sound like jon hamm
I think it would be better to use flex glue
“One small step for man, One giant leap for mankind”  Edit: Defo deserves a sub
can you please lower the price
Use all of your Spider-Man stuff and show people please
imagine this is mini and we have it on 2 hands
its so cool
This is killing me bc I genuinely have repeatedly dreamed of engineering this sort of stuff!! I’ve always dreamed of doing a spider-man stunt where I show up to someplace crawling down a wall haha.
make the flash  suit
You're more of a Prowler than spider man
Yo where is the description
This is something Batman would use
this is one of those gadgets i want but would never practicly need
DUDE! You have GOT to get together with the guy that made "disposable web shooters." He used a hook and chain that wrapped around things, but the entire assembly was contained in a hand sized device. This allowed him to swing multiple times, and release the web by dropping the grip
Dude can u send me one for fre pleeeeeeeaaaaaaaase
I got the toy web shooter and it broke the first day I used it 20 times
at this point spiderman could be real in the next 10 years
We have Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man AND Dr. Octoptus. We just need a Thor and Iron Man villain and we can make a real half baked MCU
One step closer to reliable grappling hooks
You need to make another one so you can swing for longer
This is absolutely amazing. Well done spiderman!
Can you please send me one please😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I love your channels❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you send me the instructions of the web sooter
Can you send me the instructions? Of
Batman grapple hook
wow
I ordered the spider man web shooter with the 2 to 3 business day delivery and it hasn't come in like 5 days does it takenlik a week to make or smth btw nice vid
You Know what. You could have used the gooo with the super glue possibly. So the goo stuck straight away holding on until the super glue had time to set up and actually hold your weight.
Did no one really notice nile red at 2:25
Can you do 2 swings in a row?
took a little more than 2 weeks to ship
Wear to buy?
wow this is un real WOW
This is a great way into making your friends think your actually spiderman
Seems he forgot to patent it. There are tons of copies on Amazon.
Hey maybe u can make a real web y thing kind of like glue but that disintegrates in at least 5 min
Bro is living every five year old (and thirty year old) mans dreams swingin like spider man no flippen way >:0
now we need a working iron man arm cannon👍
Lighting spider webs
You should make another one,now that would be cool but this is cool too
Cool
6:41 bro just end the video here cause you're literally swinging from a tree 😂😂😂
make spmething that can let you fly
Make a skate board that flies
Make a working ant man suit
This is the best Peter Parker
Where the website
Honestly, it looks more like batman's weapon.😂
Doin yo mom doi doin yo mom😎😎😎
Now jump off a building with that, please?
Btw i dont know if youll use this but in spiderman ps4 spidey has four different outlets that shoots webs 1 main web and 3 smaller webs that wrap around the main one using a motor for tensile strength. Thats why when he swing it looks like there is loops and strings coming out of the web because it isnt only one web.
What is your favourite superhero
If the release was faster then you’re definitely Spider-Man
Bro this man has tony Stark brain👍
This dude is going to be real life tony stark
Thats crazy🎉🎉
Hack smith as Ironman and Jlazer as Spider-Man
Tutorials or future toys?????
Make a leviathan axe that come back from god of war
IT WOULD BE SO COOL IF YOU COMBINE WBE SHOOTERS,  AIR FORCE CLIMBERS, WALL CLIMBERS AND SPIDER MAN SUIT!!!
Thank you so much I bought one and im waiting for it to come this is gonna be cool!
please qive me a web shooter
The spiderverse has a new spider man i see 💀 "justa man" literally a man with engineering skills.
I dont know
Its fake right?
3:33 sounded like nile red
Hello can l plz have one of the spider man web shooter and plz tell me if you are selling than and tell me the prise
more like batman gadget which he uses to get ti high places the gun he uses
The thing is you can't shoot to catch people with this... What about a large "gecko like" sheet that spread on the wall on the moment of impact and hold your weight thanks to micro-friction fur (like gecko)
Bros gonna have his canon event
This is good but is it fine if you can made a easier one that can list people put safe for kids cuz I’m a kid and I like it
Pls I want this pls pls pls I’m begging you and yes I’m on my knees
Imagine two of these web shooters. Bro is gonna hit it. Keep it up til the end.
the net one could be really useful for things like on foot police chases
now you should become a vigilante
You should make a Spider-Man suit that combines all of your Spider-Man inventions into one and try to use it, it would be a very tall order. But I think with your technology and engineering knowledge you could do it if you tried, I’m rooting for you, along with everyone else
The web shooter is to much money 😢
rich people could do stuff like this but he's doing these projects with a budget
Could you make a graphene Batman suit
If actual scientists focus on experimenting to create the spider-man webs and web shooters, it'd probably be possible
Do attack on titan gear with this gadget you are almost done
I have a pair of his webshooters and the only problem with them is that they jam a lot
Spidermans origin story
Dawm I want one
In an alternate universe where Spider-Man’s web does extra damage to his enemies with nails…
Thanks for telling ❤️ 😊 I may get it. It sounds awesome ❤😊
How long do these videos take
This is kinda more like ODM gear in a way
Bro on your shop you should drop this and the wall climbers
Make real webs 🕸️ that you can hang on buildings
the location of the end of the sting though 💀lol. good job though
Do batman hook
Bager
He was moving a car 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I ordered the mini version nearly a month ago and it never arrived
His neighbors mist be pissed at all the noise.
If you get the wall climbers on you'll be more like Slipknot then spiderman😂
NileRed reference lol
it could be cool if he shoot the thing and he do a big jump and climb something
Make a arc reactor
Make a Spiderman web shooter that can pull you up
2:15 made me so happy, it reminds me of the amazing Spider-Man and mcu Spider-Man series and how they make their webs 🥹
I'm sure the military is watching you closely with great interest lol
Now every manufacturer ever is copying his web shooter
noone talking about nile rred
Please make a full vid on the frozone machine!
GIVE IT TO ME IM BEGGING HOW MUCH
8:48 Congrats, you just made a M1A2 Abrams KE-W APFS-DS kinetic dart tank round!
imagine spiderman having a bonre then the thing starts zipping.
The lizard: you know. I can give you a REAL make over.. Max: let me guess into a lizard? The lizard: No. into a spider
Make a Ben 10 watch
Make a throwing web
When you said “I was able to get some goo” it was actually Nile red voice,right?
imagine using the net as a self defense weapon
Hulk in man not man
I actually think I remember seeing this universe's spiderman in across the spiderverse. Him being spiderman is a canon event
You shoukd have 2 of webshooters so you can go from one to celling to another.
Where can I get me hands on one?
Bro is this universes spiderman
Spider man wow
jk dont give a dam
its my birthday in a couple weeks and im getting one of these
The reference 😂😂 I love it bro 😁
All he needs is a radioactive spider...
Now make the spot's holes
Bro, can I please get some
Can you swing with the toy web shooter?
7:51
Your mom
Every day i get closer to becoming a vigilante. I just needs to get my hands on these 😈. Legally of course, stealing aint good ladies and gents
bro is the real life batman AND spiderman!
He's been tryna get this done since 2016 I remember he made the Web spray shooters. Those were cool I even tried to make it but failed😔
Please make MORE web shooters, I would buy them and the idea of the web shooters and your amazing creativity Is just astonishing!
but im in panama😨
can u make a real spiderman suit hand made and his webshooters that are like his
black widow electric staff when
Did anyone else hear Nile Reds voice at 2:25
How do you fix your web shooter?
Can buy it?😂
He literally look like spider man trying to make a web shooter
as spider-man from earth 42069. I would like one of these
Up next is making a radioactive spider.
Unfortunately it is impossible to swing fluidly like spider man we would need super strength for that so it is basically impossible to be spider man and actually swing from a building
spooder man
All of the glue into one web shooter
this is cool but instead of wall climbers you should add wall runners.then ill admit that you are spider man
I’m buying one of them webshooters there so cool I’m so glad I clicked on this vid I cant wait to use it
A real life exo suit from cod
take care of ur uncle...
I bet it doesn't stick to water
Put the climber things on and the web shooter together
Maybe you could collab with NileRed and see if it's possible to synthesize an adhesive fast acting and strong enough to swing from.
Welp now the last gadget to make is the spidey sense then we just need to find a way to make all of it smaller
bro i have been waitng for my webshooter for 2 months now send it
Get me one
the most realistic spiderman
the Nilered reference ahaha
He should make another one and see if he can swing twice.
Use that net one for fishing
bro really turned into nile blue
Prowler be like:
This guy is gonna be the next spider man for sure
this is not even spider man anymore, just a gadget man
we are close to get a real spider man
alright, how much do I have to pay to buy this model
Spider-Man is the goal, but this feels a lot closer to ODM gear from Attack on Titan. Which, for the record, is still super cool. 🤩
I have to save up 257.02 dollars just to get ps4
2:16 the NileRed reference blew my mind.
thats amazing now you just gotta make one on your other hand so you can swing again after your first swing
Where can I get the mini web shooters
Left only thing to climb on buildings, ceiling, walls, and other things, only with adhesive/stinky gloves
My man is  Peter Parker jeez
bro could made not webslinging but a portable zip line system
The website for the webshooter isn't working for me so sad 😢
respect
this can lowkey allow you to make the AOT 3d movement device
Imagine a stunt guy seeing you wearing helmet just to drop off from 10 feet height having cushions under. millennials.
I'm so sad that isn't available in India
The music from 15.00 to 16.27 is from fallout 4
Can I buy this from you please?
i hope the web shooter have a lot in stock it almost my birthday and I really want it (January)
I want one 😭
I just bought one of their web shooters for my birthday and it was going really well until once I shoot it doesn't go the length it usually goes can anyone help me
I got it
The future spider man!
Send me a spider man shooters.
Will Bro or Bros Child gonna be the Spider man 2099
become spider-man
This Man is a LEGEND!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Bro about to be canon event in our world
2:26 NeilRed
Bro If he was a kid he would be going crazy using this
😎😏😎😏😮cool new stuff I like the full   Venom suit one more were could you get the venom stuff
2:25 shout out Neil
Funny enough, this is actually getting really close to Attack on Titan ODM gear in a way.
Is more like Miguel's claws
Jlaservideo with great power comes with great responsibility ❤
I think they can make you happy if your

Make something g that make you run 50 mph
Exposing comic book logic: This thing is a BAHEMOTH of a machine. Meanwhile Spidey can hold like... 6 of his web shooters in one pocket😂😂😂  One day. One day...😂
In ten years he will be irl spiderman
2:30 laser you could make a web cartridge lake some variations of spiderman and it just may work it is a powerful web just figure out a way to layer the webs or whatever to make it even more powerful and then you have web shooters for sticking to walls you can figure out how to make the fluid into a sticky fabric and make it into the gloves idk if you already thought of this and ran into an issue but I am just trying to give a suggestion
Jesus: HOW IS THIS POSSBLIE
hey you should make sucktion cup gloves or something like that to stick to walls i think that would be pretty cool
Looks like a guy at an obstacle course   "Looks super spidey." Uhhh.
2:26 why did he sound like Nile red lol
This is similar to bionic commando Nintendo video game
This is dope but I need to see an exact replica of spiderman swinging in NYC from buildings
Can you save the bank?
What about the other hand
Why doesn't he use the insta stick glue on his web shooter that quick reloads
the invention i suggest on the store is the self tightening suit in any size so some kids can live their dream of having the suit
I want the one that I can actually swing from
Hi I am new on the chanal
2:24 You Ok or did your voice change??🤣
Should this evolve into a Zelda hookshot?
if you had 1 shooter for each hand would actually be insane
there will be a day when real supervillains will exist thanks to science and technology. You wont be the hero we deserve, but rather the hero we need
now try shooting it at someone
Could make a grappling hook like Batman with this but just put it all into a gun
that “web goo” looked like a little something else..
I love how it just kept getting bigger and bigger 😂
Would love to see you have 2x and shoot another one in mid-swing then let go of the first.
Can I have a web shooter my parents don’t let me get one then please please if you give me one then can you be my friend in Roblox if you even have a bowl 23 even know and I’ll trade you stuff in❤❤❤❤ so please can I get a Web Siri can you deliver it to me tomorrow?       	give me a web shooter
You basically made 3D maneuver gear from AOT
Bros finna become The new main character in beyond the spiderverse
this man is tony stark without the money :O
smoke bombs like the ones batman uses please
I love your videos so much
i really really want those web shooters he sells but im too broke
Everybody gangster till he webs someone up 💀
this is more like attack on titan lol
The title has a pretty critical typo  he's not using webs anymore and he's actually batman, we're one step closer to being batman, he in no way furthered the genetic science required for spiderman
I want one but we don't have it
"Sticks to antything!" *has to screw a pallet to the ceiling for it to stick to*
Love the reference to that one science channel when you started mixing the chemicals lmfao
1 deep closer to being an irl spider man all we need now is a super soldier type serum
that batman
Swing release into another shot then swing mid air.
2:24 thought I was on crack but its just nile red, a crack dealer(?)
Parker Industries
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEÈEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAÉEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
U won't believe me but I made a some what of a web shooter with a rope and a speaker magnet when I was like 8 but the rope stuck so hard I was swinging in the same rope for almost 2 years 👾
6:12 he looks like Andrew Garfield/James Franco lol
vl
5:51
You guys should swing onto buildings! (With safety gear ofcourse)
Yall he could be the first spider man to exist💀
wow
dude please keep working on this!! if u can actually have one on each hand and a way to reload it's gonna be a dream come true
Can you make one that you can use multiple times
could you make a fold able marvel shield please
The suit he wears and the helmet is an actual cool design
This could work more as the odm gear in attack on titan
Can I please get one for free
you brought out your inner nile red
The thing that you made in first half in the video actually feels like the Web-Shooters, the later invention feels more like the grappling gauntlet from Assassin's Creed Syndicate.
you are not him blud
No disrespect to JLazer but he should design his own super hero suit and not just wear a Spider-Man costume but keep up the good work and love your videos
That's cool!
Bro turned into Nile Red 2:16
bro is the definition of spooderman.
next step: make a second one, so you can keep on swinging
make something to climb a wall
what if you put magnets to connect the net around an object
This is insanely impressive. I don’t think people even realize how difficult it is to create a web shooter that works this well.   This is truly better than any I’ve ever seen.
We are so close.
2:25 NileRed entered the chat😂
Could you make one that can be non lethal or non damaging to the item you’re sticking to
now attach a second one and make it be able to reload itself and it'll be perfect!
Is it just me or the camera man doesn’t get any surport
by 2030 we might have real mechanical spidermen and women swinging around nyc fighting crime
This system might be better suited for those things from Attack on Titan instead of spiderman. Every length of rope you swing on adds more weight. But if all you're doing is reeling it back in and then re-launching it you only need so much length to begin with.
Finally web shooters that are fairly priced You are doing amazing things though
What about glass
now you have to make somthing thats like spider senses
Para cuando el equipo de manibras 3D de attack on titan¿?
Make another one and swing from walk to wall
does it stick onm water
His livening all are dreams
have tought about doing this dual wield so you can actually go from one swing to another
I really want it
I really want it but my mom says it's dangerous
the idea of sticking bulk glue/rat trap glue on the toy version is a good idea that I want to see more of
He should play as a Spider-Man stunt double
this mf gonna make the avengers bro
PLS LET ME GET THE ONE I CAN SWING FROM PLS SELL IT I WANT IT SO BAD I WOULD PAY 155 BUXS FOR IT I WANTED TO BE SPIDER-MAN FOR AGES
Cool
How to make Spider-Mans web fluid. (Knowledge from Comics and Films. If this works, in any way do not try to swing. Your arms may be ripped of because you dont have the Strength of Spider-Man)  Step 1.  Get:  Salicylic Acid Methanol Toleune Carbon Tetrachloride Pottasium Carbonate Ethyl Acetate  Step 2. Mix  Step 3.  Store in 16 gram cartridges in empty Co2 cans  Step 4. (Peter Parker does this) Add 100 PSI
canon event incoming
You can swing, but i'm just scared about the G forces
This might be spider-man
You should’ve made two 18:27
Its all fun and games, til he takes a leap of faith
im getting your on sale webshooter next wednesday. Very happy bout it.
The catch rope u used on the mannequin has some actual real world applications and seemed to work great
You should try and have the YouTuber herodw try that because I think he’s a fan of Spider-Man and he’s a very talented person by what he does which is parkour
Hi can you please let people from lithuania buy the web shoter too?😅
Can I get what I need to make a spiderman web shooter
❤❤❤
make a flying ironman suit and a captain america shield that comes back?
Bros gonna be this universes spiderman
It's a Canon event
Big Engineras should hire You for Spiderman Develpment
Soon he’s going to make a spider sense and become Spider-Man
So basically... you just made a themed grapple gun?
yeah... webs 💀
POV me looking for the what am I making next comment
bouta dedicate my life to making web fluid and a web shooters
Now this is how you become a menace
Okay now upload a video where you slightly modify this to be Batman’s grapple gun😂
bro u can put peper spray inside and when someone try to fight u just sling ur spray
5-10 years later “becoming spiderman with REAL web shooters and saving the city!!!”
Dude. Actually really cool!
What is thatusic called I need to know
Imagine this with military tech, it’d be actually possible to mirror Spider-Man minus the super strength and actual webs
it also reminds me of the batman, with his bat hook or wathever
man you gotta change the screw thing when you acidentaly shoot a guy boom youre in a crime scene and pls try to make it smaller so it goes trough airport security
Wolverine's claws
" Hey guys today I'm going to make a working infinity gauntlet "
WOW❤
this is good spider man is real now u just need to color ur helment or get a spider man mask
Taking out the trash. Ahhh smart man, got the tarantula strength upgrade early.
s the web from the web shooter strong and stcky-does the web shooter come with the webs included
sit on the roof
the nile red reference
No one talking about the subtle nilered part at 2:24?
im not sure but i think he likes spider-man 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
When Mr beast makes the biggest game of 'the floor is lava' You already know he is going to win.
Spidey generating leaks wherever he goes
omg this is actually so cool i got goosebumps
This is revolutionary for man kind image what things you can do with this power
Welcome… SponderMoon
2:24 made me piss my pants bro
Y’all need to sell nvm
Another problem, you can't exactly use these. Something about property damage means these would quickly become illegal for anything public or not your's.
The government is coming for you
like how nile was on the video
Can I please get one for free please please please I’ll do anything almost anything🎉
Can I please the web shooter for free
Start an actual toy company or sell some of the ideas to manufacturers
makes a capinamerca Sheld
thats soo cool
What does Fais do do you?
Bro, what does it do to you?
Are these for sale? 😢
It’s more like a grappling hook than a webshooter
is the web shooters small enough to use on halloween for a cosplay?
Where is the link ?
Police:”So your saying a man in a spider suit robbed you?”
do the webshooters u sell let us swing cuh
All they did was make a retractable grappling hook
Man, you and Hacksmith should work together on a project like this. I always watch you and Hacksmith creat really awesome things and if you two worked together I feel like you guys could create something super awesome. My opinion at least
You fr gotta sell this man
This is so cool! I wish I could have one myself I can only imagine the possibilities. Also this thing would make a killer weapon.
Seal it pls!
Im probably gonna buy the black web shooters that retract faster or something. Idk but this looks amazingly epic my guy.
Make a second one and make it you can throw so much weeps without touching ground
hom tolland
make crosslink from decaying winter
You should make the suction cup gloves thy juney cortez has on spykids climbing up the ride
Are your shopify web shooters shipped worldwide or only around the US?
So you technically made the grappler from fortnite
You even have the look of Peter Parker.
I think it's much easier to just get bitten by a radioactive spider.
Nail launcher man
how much crime do you fight on a weekly basis?
Why not just use actual spider silk
SWING LIKE IN SPIDRMAN😀😄😃
2:16 bro turned into Nile red 😂😂
This is more of a Batman device. Still cool though
How do we buy that Walmart or touch?
"Aku pikir kau yang akan menjadi spiderman di masa depan" Translate this Indonesia to English
You've done more than enough to deserve the title of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man❤. I can't wait to see how far you take this
Try doing swing attacks or web attacks on test dummies or maniquens. Like Spidermans swing kick.
12:20 He's a menace!
During the video he mentioned selling a web shooter, if I ordered it which version would I get?
bro done made the thingamijig come to life by spiderman addition
This is more of batman that spidey
that is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool
You need to make 2 of them so you can start to lin’the swinging also have a way to re
How does he have less budget then Hacksmith but is ahead of them
16:48 spiderchad was born
Can you please give me that thing because I do want to become Spider-Man like you and Peter parker
This is every kids dream
next thing is getting a way to reuse the ropes to repeatedly launch and swing and stuff
You what else is white and sticks to everything?         Glue.
It’s all fun and games until he gets a cease and desist from disney
Do it with both hands will you can let go and and immediately shoe again
Does some1 know how to build this thing 00:13
He needs to make a Spider-Man suit that has the eyes that move
U need 1 for each arm so u can swing let go then swing again in mid air
I think it'd be easier just to be spiderman.
HES TURNING INTO NILERED
mandame los lansatelaraña  saludos desde venezuela
The nail is about as useful as the magnet, due to the limitations of materials that it's effective on.
you should make 2 for each hand to you know to the twip twip thing
Would have been nice if he had one in each hand so he can swing from one to the other
Cool
I have a suggestion  make a web shorter that retracts so it can swing over and over
Man’s hit a screw with a hammer Yet he makes literal webshooters This man is my idol
2:25 @nilered 🤣🤣 nice Easter egg
gives me John Ham vibes
This is soooo sick dude, but now it’s your duty to protect New York.
Now this is awesome
isnt this more like batman's graple ?
ironman blast
Be safe in all trials, if you use it commercially. Keep a lot of cartridges. Don’t wanna be mid swing then can’t make another web
just me or he should sell these items that he builds
Yo why was nilered in the vid
Make 2
He's in suite of Spider-Man but grappling his rope like The Batman. Literally....😂
It's so cool...🤩🤩..but can it be continuous like you don't need to recollect the dart n then shoot again..please try to give a thought to this too😄...
Action lab also did the chemical thing
If bro could make this watch sized, mass produced, a d sealed for 5 dollars   per web shooter, he'd probably be richer than elon musk
so basically, they made a grappling hook but its like a glove instead of a gun, but over all I like their invention
How to get bi***s 101
So, if anyone can see, on the mini version. Does it make a permanent mark on things?
I think if you used the same suction as the climbers you could stick without sticking holes in everything
Make 2 and make the rewind faster and does it shoot more than one time of it uses the rope jsut make it faster and get two of them and you would be 98.9 percent closer to be spider man I wanna see you actually swing onto a walls and clim that wall like spider man
Can you make this unlimited please :(
Omg this is amazing, you are a genius! I wish you luck for future project
bro made web fluid
He made ODM gear 🔥🔥🔥
Now wear two and shoot one mid air into a second swing
For anyone looking to become Spider-Man. Remember. You can’t stop canon events. So be emotionally prepared
i think it would be cool if you could keep swinging like you swing release and swing again
2:24 nile red????
Lethal weapon?!
bros finna be selling his stuff the the military
in earth ??? a man was hit by creativity and became the one and only spiderman
Why do I feel like this guy is gonna be the next mark Rober
You need to make another one so then when you swing you could shoot the other one from the other hand and you could release the one that you already shot first
Those mini nail guns must use some kind of gunpowder charge. And they don't want to tell you how to make them because of your safety. They don't want to tell you how to make them because of Money. They might patent this. and they also don't want people suing them because of their own stupidity. Make no mistake. these people don't give a single damn about your safety.
NileRed voice jumpscare
Can you guys send it to iceland? And just more countries because i live in iceland and i want the webshooter so much, thanks❤
Bro could sell them and become rich of it
the industrial revolution and its effects on spiderman
You should make a remote controled batarang
need to make one for both arms so you can swing without touching the ground
Now you need to make it so if I would jump off a building my arms would get ripped off
He’s to strong he must be stopped
Now you just need to make webshooters that will wrap around somebody for combat (great project btw)
can i buy one jk
that nylon thing actually looked like the things that peter parker makes in the mcu
This is like spiderman in slow motion, but probably the closest anyone has gotten! 😧😦😶
He is very smart good work!
2:35 bro literally just made kids
With big powers come big responsabilities
NOOOO MILES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
so cool!
We got our own Spider-Man baby!
Man is making it so Gwen has no chance to survive😂😭
WHAT THE HECK?!?!!?! PLZ CONTINUE!!! THIS IS SO FRIKEN AMAZING!!!!
I actually have a "web" shooter idea of my own... kinda. I lack the resources or engineering training to make it happen sadly, so it'll be a long time before i can actually make them
If only u have a second one to continue the swinging but it was still nuts g keep it up
Nile red literally replaced the guy at 2.26
for a second i thought you were nile red
Bro Nile red💀
he is actually VERY close here. all he really needs is a way to reload quickly and to shoot webs off both arms (also super strength but that’s a different story)
Make gloves that stick to WALLS
If you make two you could swing around and use your magnet to climb
this is the spiderverse but the main character do'nt get bitten by a radioactive spider
HE DID IT ! HE CREATED THE WAY ! FINALLY ! IM WAITING SINCE 20 years for that ! WHERE I CAN BUY IT ? I NEED 70 million pieces ! ONLY FOR ME !❤
If u make another one u can stick swing realest and then repeat
sooooo........ you made a grapple device ..... more like tenchu stealth assassin than spiderman..... which is cool in its own respect.
Hey  Vsauce Micheal here 2:16
real spiderman webs need two hours for them to disappear, you need two hours to remove them from the ceiling.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS MOVIE IT MEANS A LOT TO ME
Remember kids  Eavrything is possible  Mostly now in this time
Wth Great power, comes great responsibility
2:18 Bro is NOT nile red
I want some web shooters
Wow you are gieneus
BRO A GENIUS
Can you make a Time Machine so I can go back to June 21st 2023 and stop my car from being wrecked
Just add cutting mechanic to the web so its was instant when you realese the web
The thumbnail looked like a tv avatar
Where did you buy the chemicals for the web like fluid does anyone know
You could use the web shooter design for the lighters but put more pressure and put the liquid in a tubes above the mixture of web so when it gets shot out it goes into the insta dry liquid
This is so cool!!!
The hacksmith and this guy should work together for this as the biggest milestones in the world.
Post a video about saving people as spider-man
PLEASE YES
take away spider-man, and you could sell this to the military as repelling tech.
have you figured out how to counteract G forces? kinda the only reason spiderman cant exist irl, hed be dead every time he swung
😢
What is the website name?
Make light sabers
Spiderman: Made From Home
The "I was able to pull out some white goo." was nile red/blue which I think is hilarious that the editor/creator thought to add that in
Very very cool
You should see if you could swing retract the cord and hang on the wall
Committed lmao…. He putting holes in the patio roof/ceiling brah… sheeesh 🤣
yooo i love the nile red references lol
I want it how much u want it for????
This would be so helpful in construction stuff wouldn’t it?
Its the mini shooter worth it to buy?
Alex Turner?
Can you built another one and put it on your other hand?
Who else heard him say west
Don't break  break a window
2:21 u sure those are webs 😳😳😳😳
I bout some
You need a gymnast to test this out for you so they can swing better.
7:51 “dance monkey”
this has become less of spiderman and more of making rico's grappling hook from just cause 3 and 4 (because  2 and 1 suck)
2:23 yo what is that 😋
wow!
bro turned into nile red for a second
it's not what it pretends to be so...
get 2 of these
If u create another one for your left hand it merge it with ur climbing things, your official spider man. And if u make the ropes longer and paint them white🍒🔛🎩
spoooooder man
Great now do the leap of faith
What fell out of his but at 16:48
Make bird wings and please send them to me I have the dream of flying 👍🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
I hope he sees the immense potential in this, obviously it’s easier said than done but if he were to make a second one and make both capable of being retracted and reloaded in a short, and I mean short, amount of time, he could theoretically keep swinging.
You should make a hammer that never hits a nail
can kids use this
You have seen red Niles video to make the web he is a chemist 4:27
2:24 WWOOOOAH
You think you can shrink it all on your wrist?
instant buy. and for only $40!?!?!?!
hes swinging better than the marvel spider man game 💀
Can you please make more swinging web shooters and sell the around the world
Mark rober is crying rn
Bro is becoming spider man😂 can i be ur partner
Bro pls make Batman’s grapple gun and belt it would be soo sick
Make a war machine suit with a rocket on the shoulder if you can’t do that well just do the suit I’m sure it will look cool
Make Wolverine’s claws please😊
I love it dude awesome
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Ilove you

I NEED THE SPRING RING
The man trying to become spiderman actually invents the 3D Maneuver Gear from attack on titan.
This real cool carlos dad loves this
Awesome
This real nice my sons love spider man
I know this is supposed to be Spider-Man, but I feel like it can also double as the arm grapel gun from The Batman lol. Really “Amazing” either way
What if you bought it on Amazon
Now go find a spider!
This is amazing man. Just goes to show that technology has evolved and it is extremely advanced! You can do anything you put your mind to. And this is coming from a Buffalo who was given access to the internet. - TheBuffalo478 (Me).
Nile Red on the feature🤔

next is spidersense
At this point you're a superhero
you could use the same concept of the nail shooting into targets on impact to grip onto targets, and the motors reeling you in to make a really accurate Attack on Titan ODM gear
Man went from magnets to glue to a fucking nail gun
I want to see him go do this out in public😂
Please put the cap shield for sale😊
I am pretty sure that if he makes  another one like this for the other hand it would be great
Hi jlazer I bought the web shooters they are fun but thought I'd say my idea as I can't do it so basically with nylon you can make webs but a new thing called carbon nanotubes increases strength so maybe if you send carbon nanotubes with the nylon when making it it'd make the strength more so enough carbon nanotubes would make a strong enough web?
It's even better when you realise how much this guy looks like Tom Holland
Now they just need to find a way to make the webs have longer range and have more ability then just swinging
Why not use the compound of hair that makes it hold 2 elephant and mix it to in a liquid state that will be mixed on whatever the glue you made when interaction with the air it will harden to a stick and tough like web and becuese hair can hold 2 elephant it can hold human but or maybe this just A Theory A science theory thanks for reading
That's mad
That was pathetic
Grappling hook
Have you thought about mixing nylon with super glue and kind of braid it so it could be stronger am
men you could be batman
Hope I’m not late but bet I am lol
Thres a universe in the spiderverse series where this is cannon.
Hold on, I DARE you to swing from buildings and truely become spiderman
NileRed caught me REALLY off guard
no don’t be spiderman, you’ll have to go through a canon event
This vid reminds me of when peter was still adapting to his powers
Please selll it I wNt
Imagine turning into a red stain on the ground for the views
You’re better off being the prowler tbh
bru, I CANT BUY IT!! IM FROM BRAZIL LMAO
do the purchasable mini shooters you made come in pairs or single ones?
Do a jetpack next
pile bunker spider man
He could actually just be spider man if he tried
The nile red voice 😂
We need him to show up as an Easter egg spider person in beyond the spider verse
The fish 😭
expected more.
Make a robot
You didn’t even make the web shooter you have the audacity to sell for $40 you copied it I’ve seen two other Spider-Man web shooters with the same design. You just decided to put your logo on it oh and your newest video little rip off from Alan Chan
Bros gonna be the next spider man
Spider-Jlaser
This is his origin story
imagine he had two
Great. Now you are Rico Rodriguez from Just Cause
Lastly you need is a radioactive spider
He should make a goblin glider next
He is literally ready to become Spider-Man,he just has to make his suit,and combine the gadgets!
Could you put one of the webshooters that shoot nylon up on your website or even this one? (the nylon ones dont gotta come loaded)
YOU pour la mise en place des procédures en vigueur au 7e jour   yokkn
You should ad it on both hands
I want a web shooter but I don't have money I'm nine😭
This is AMAZING! If there is still any of these webshooters left i am gonna try to order one, and reverse engineer it so that way hopefully I can make a version of my own and maybe just maybe i could make some modifications *not that yours is bad which like i said it is amazing, but i wanna try something of my own*. If I do come up with any modifications I will make sure to let you know.
All that’s left is fighting crime :D
I am not lying when I say this. I’m an entrepreneur from Dubai and I will pay you 50 Million dollars to get that off you
"spider man what's with that buldge in your pants?!"
Or ropes that you can swing with?
Is this web shooter he is selling the one with nets
2:25 he turned into NileRed for a second there.
2:41 why dont you just put the spray on the liquid.
He's the real Peter Parker/Tony Stark in one
He should be in a movie
Every progress in this project’s seems to be like of becoming more of a BAT MAN stuff.
Power Ranger X Spider-man at the end😂
maybe he'll make our dream comes true one day. really hope
Someone finally did it. Finally.
Make something which can sefe us from zombies
Imagine swinging in the air and reloading like that to then swing again
\m/
now all you need to do in invent future seeing
Now go fishing with spider man webs
spider man 1999
Imagine using these on Halloween and pull the candy with the web
how about doing all your spider man projects together 😕
amazing video
Why don't we just try with spider webs 😂
Wait until someone has unlimited funds and a team behind this.
Next step... one for the left hand!
do you think you could rappel using that motor? like have it pull you to the ceiling or something?
He nailed it!!!
aint no way bro didnt put a laser on and just hoped his aim was a1
Can’t tell if that was AI or actually Nigel
The sky is the real life Spider-Man now
Awesome project perfect it ❤️❤️❤️
bro just invented a wrist grappling hook
Go with two hand and two target 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
I dare you to be spider man
bro's ready to fight the colossal titan
The nylon web fluid reminds me of Tom Holland's webs
Now  you just have to jump from 200FT building and latch on and you'd be swinging.
Holding your weight
imagine being a kid and looking out your window to see spider, only for him to proceed to blast a spike through your wall
that white goo like like c-
try and make a grappling hook
You should make a second one so when you are in mid air you can use your other one
combine that with spider sense mask(i think from hacksmith)
*Makes web shooters* *shows the one version of Spider-Man that doesnt have web shooters*
18:15 😵‍💫💀☠️☠️☠️?
make organic web that sticks to anything
M8 have you heard of attack on titan, this is literally like the odm gear in that show
just get bit by a radioactive spider
Closer to Valerie the Librarian
Imagine having one of these on both hands and swinging twice in one go
Nylon is the same thing Spider-Man used
He should sell it to marvel😮😮
Green Goblin:- WHO IS BEHIND THAT MASK!! Meanwhile this guy buying 500 miles of Kevlar Rope:-
What am i making next ❓❔
Where can I but them
Bro ive watched still countless times and just noticed NileRed... at 2:15
Bro became Nile red😂
dude i literally had a heart attack over the fact you can BUY webshooters
I want one
According to the 1986 official handbook thingy, his webs actually are made from a nylon like material.
we are inching closer to become aq true spiderman.
3:05  Your mom after I visit her
I'm 8 and Waiting for him  to make a Web shooter that i can swing from so I can sneak out at night and swing around my neighborhood.
At the Time 4:11 I have that
I got the web shooter he got it’s so cool I love it this guy will make ai one day
And if i think the NASA and the eeuu Can create a real web shooter XD
Any day Bro can be spiderman and we wouldn't know💀
can I have one please
But if I can ask can the web shooter pull you up like you click some thing to go up or no?
honestly incredible video.
The car bit was only a bit dangerous with the gas tank in the back of the vehicle and the nail being powered by a .22
You could fashion this into Batmans grapnel gun if you take the same idea of the Kevlar cord and firing mechanism and put it into a gun instead.
So does Spider-Man just leave gooey webs all over town wherever he goes?
Maybe some sort of velcro type thing instead of glue to keep it straight and break off easy for fast reseting?
But how am i going to buy one i am on the philippines
bro thinks he's like spider-man💀
Bro this man who needs the military they got him he funna create a hulk serum
You should try to start on the ground then shoot the web up then use the motor to swing up to the ceiling!!!!!!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
Rember,this tech is only gonna get more advanced 😳
You missed a oppurtunity to go for a double swing!!!
the thumbnail looks like a toy advertisement from the 90's lmao
give it 50 years. ppl will be swinging around soon lmao
Make a second arm and do a combo swing🤩🤩
Idont know why i didnt know you earlier, you are the most genius person i know. You are leterally creating everything what you have in idea as a human being. Real proud of you
At this rate, in 20 years we will have a spider-man swing attraction at theme parks 😂
Nile red cameo or impression?😂
GIVE ME THAT 10$ A BILLON DOLLERS I NEED THESE
4:11 where can I get it?
His new goal is now to jump off of a building like spoderman did and swig from the "web"
now he just needs to do a double swing, where he swings, and then uses the other hand to shoot another one and swing again without landing.
Can I get a webshooter
2:00 he turned in to Nile red
Studies engineering and trade school skills to....build web shooters KEKW
I just made octavius tentacle arms lol
This is his canon event
Military looking on with steepled fingers...."Keep going! This is Gold!"
bro you should do it with two web shooters and do it in city
Now all I need to witness is a functional ODM gear and my life is complete
Number one part of the vid 18:15  I wish that was me and seeks lil broth. :P
It's cool to see lightsabers and Spider-Man swings becoming more possible each day
ambatu-
5:50 no joke this could actually be usefull for police
So you should do on miles morales suit that can turn invisible
so you went back to the magents okay
Don't fall for this guys, West is trying to distract us from our main objective. Just keep focusing on becoming a super saijyan. If videl can learn how to fly we all definitely can too. 💪🏻
Instead of having Spider-Man with superpowers this would be a really good idea movie making more like Batman
make another one to continuously swing to a wall then climb it
I was thinking for you to be able to swing more you could look at maybe making a clutch on the ropes motor, this way at faster swings, you could let the rope unwind with almost no resistance. Idk tho.
Nile red reference
Nobody talking about how much strength you still need to pull a car?
Make a bat grapple hook
When nilereds voice said, "and I was able to pull out some white goo." I lost it because that's what I was thinking of
Perseverance on 1000 so motivating bro
More like AOT
let’s go I can be spooder-man
Hey JLaservideo do you still make the web shooters you have on your website?
Dudes gonna become real life spiderman
kai cenat crying rn
Bro really used someone else’s voice
You should make remote control slime
We're every day closer to have a real spiderman in this world thanks to people like you
seeing this after across the spider verse is cool
When the vigilantes are needed you'd better answer that call lol. The most realistic heroes well ever have are gonna be Mr House, Bruce Wayne, Some Version of Captain America and SpiderMan
Bro is becoming this universe Spiderman
Nile red voice over
imagine trying to break into this mans house just to get webbed out of the window 🐨
Does this ship to the UK?
technically hes a part of the spiderverse now. and his canon event will happen soon
Him an his team doing this on their own imagine if it got the attention of the military or some scientists that like in the movie. The spider verse is at hand.
He really wanted to at this point he could become spider man
the grapple and hip system makes it alot closer to attack on titan omni-directional mobility gear, so why don’t u try that next?
I think if he put his mind into this he would be a real spiderman for sure
mans got a big junk under that harness
With that motor that pulled you up you could literally be batman with his grappler gun
this is great but can you try with both hands like shoot, swing, shoot, release  before one and swing again
now just find a  way to be able to retract it back or be able to reloda or maybe just have more like how  a gun has a certian amount of shots
Can you make this again but instead of swinging make it like one individual web that can stick stuff to other things
at this point its easier to take a rope with a hook. it is nowhere near spider man.
No, Spider-Man uses real spiderwebs idiot
Spiderman: made at home literally 💀
make it so that when ever you swing it pushes you forward so you could really swing like spiderman
Omfg I can’t believe my eyes right now man. This is incredible
Can I have a huge
i bought one of your web shooters, can’t wait for it to arrive!
salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate. That is the web recipe you just need to invent web shooters that can hold it
This is so impressive, the fact that he was able to practice his swinging was astonishing
I need to know where you got the suit from, 1:50.
He looks more like spooderman than spiderman.
Bro is literally Spiderman
Now just use the same mechanism in both ands and u can swing twice
If you could Attach  the wall climbers with the webs and have 2 of each you'd be a surperior spiderman lol
That is Genuinely Awesome!... Imagine if this stuff gets commercialized... and then improved upon... and then keep being improved
Double it and give it to me
I think you should re visit the rat trap
You need to sell this
You should become a real superhero and I think I saw you in one of Brent Rivera's videos
6:17 "Spiderman doesnt kill"
I have an idea of how to make your invention better, and would like to talk to you about it. Respond so we can text please.
Closest thing to to spiderman? Just wait until I find that black widow in my garage 🗿
cool man! just need one for the other hand to compete it.
Could’ve used a wrist based crossbow since arrows already stick in things
Next step make another one for the other hand
2:15 NileRed reference!!
I feel like this is more like batmans grappling systems from the comics than like Spider-Man. Awesome job either way and amazing work.
Next video: "So you know how Spider-Man gets his powers from a radioactive Spider? Well today, I'm going to be genetically engineering this video so stay tuned!"
Well, if I ever look at the news one day and see a real life vigilante Spider-Man, I know who it is.
make spider man evri pawer tu geter
Brooo y isnt it available in india
“Dance monkey” Me: ok https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUxChessSEY
Every single day we become closer to people becoming spider msn
Utkin launcher
What are you going to be?😮😮
great vid
Bro with this mechanism you can easily make Batman grappling hook
GET OVER HERE!!! Oops wrong franchise.
make a spider from some lab bite you then you have become spiderman 🤯
Can you release this? 😭
One of these on ninja worrier and maybe I start watching it
Would it be possible to have the nails you shoot up in be cut with those cutters you showed, so that you could reel it back in and load another jail (Just a theory, I have no clue how those hammers work)
dude youre my hero
thats really cool but i want to know does it come with the web??
just get a faster motor that releases the string faster and make a second web shooter, and i think u have potential to literally become spiderman
bro just built odm gear
I WANT ONE BUT IT IS OUT OF STOCK 😭
this is not Spiderman web it is the ODM gear :>
Why the butt
This guy could actually be spidermand from this universe all he needs is his uncle and his aunt
spider wedgie
when can i buy it
he will probably make the ovm gear in the future
I want one
2:24 bro turned into nile red 💀
Anyways, say good bye to your family and friends, they are going to die.
Imagine he accidentally shoots a nail through one of his friends heads
Hey J parker
When will they be back in stock?
Thats less spider-man and more batman in my opinion. Still really cool!
i would pay to see this used as a prank where everyone is an actor except the people watching it happen to the actor
Shouldve uploaded this when spider man movie
That’s freakin awesome!
you made the price of the web shooter so expensive
Seeing this video is inspiring me to try and make my own webshooter to
If you do become spider-man one day remember With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility 👴🏻💥🔫
Next test do it in between two houses
Create an electroadhesive tool for hands and feet and be able to climb like spiderman
So I need to connect my own net to swing?
now make 2
Next step creat a reload able web shooter
do another and see if you can actually swing
Do you sell some of your inventions
Bro is literally Spider-Man
the unemployed friend on a wednesday afternoon:
Can you sell on to me pretty please
Use t like when tobbey first time
Seems like this would be better if you used this technology as like Batman’s grappling hook.
yo im spiderboy wit it
Thank you Jlaservideo for like your video
If spiderman had this web shooter he can just shoot his opponents 💀
You should be added as our universe's Spider-Man in the next Across the Spider-Verse movie. Would be a cool addition and appreciation to all your hard work.
Now you need one on the second arm and you can swing for ever
This looks more like AOT version
Next time you should try to climb something than swing to another wall and climb again
pov when ur table is metal magnet grabs the whole table
I'm sure Cia has something like this
Now you need one on each arm😂
make the flying falcon wings
Silk spider silk
this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life
you should  of made 2 web shooter
that was the smoothest ad ive ever seen. i didnt even know it was an ad at the start
“I was able to pull out some white goo”
2:25 🤓🤓🤓
You should do the same thing but with barbed nails or something similar with barbs
If he had two he’d be able to use the force of the second hand to pull the first hand out of the ceiling
so we are just going to ignore the fact that he shot at a helicopter
This guy REALLY loves spiderman
Swing over a ball pit
u better not disappear after this video :D
What’s the website called?
Man i want to buy one of those but theres nothing for colombia 😢
How much for this?
Make it faster, smaller and add quick release.
Can you do odm gear from attack on titan
Watch in 10 years he’s gonna make an actual web slinger
You look like peter parker
Magnetic wasn't going to work with 600lbs u forgetting basic physical equations
How about you? Add a suit to everything and look like Spider-Man.
He actually did it…
It is more like batman gun with spiderman concept😅
Crazy to think Peter made these in his bedroom in the 60s
How long does it take for the web shooter to come in
07:21 he has the same spidey chair as me! No way!
4:42
0:00 hello welcome to timed, if you want to make some webs and i don’t mean grappling hooks but a cool webbing that looks real and feels real then take some black spray paint and put a bunch of it in one area of a piece of styrofoam and sort of mix it together and you have some venom webbing try and experiment with it and different colors and make your own webs to make it more realistic, i was making a spider man mask and put the lenses on a piece of styrofoam to not make a mess and it made some web patterns in the stringy liquid styrofoam

now all he needs is a mechanism that allows him to travel inter dimensionally
I wanna buy this but y’all don’t ship to Greece FFS
bro im so happy to see its come true in the slightest bit
when you accidentally create a 3d maneuver gear
why does he sound like NileRed sometimes
Fun fact: If any normal human were to swing by the webs like spiderman without his enhanced durability and strength, younwould probably die from you musles ripping apart by the push down gravitational forces when younswing downwards.
You dont need any gadgets or tools, all you need is a radioactive spider and your done!  *Also let it nibble you*
Bros actually spiderman at this point
I need that blueprint
That would be insane if the web shooters were retractable.
You should sell the spring ring!
Mastrapeiece
You should have made two
Make a grappling gun plz
This guy is a fuckin genius, if anyone deserves to be Spider-Man it’s this man right here
Honestly feels more Batman than Spidey
It’s all fun in games until you miss a web shoot and fall
Batman wrist grapple
Bro yo are  really  spider man  in real life  😯💫💫
I feel like if people like this start popping up more on YouTube their gonna get drafted to make weapons
is it just me or does he sound and look a bit like Airrack lol
el va a ser spiderman
Bro turn your body into hulk!!!
Where the link
you should put one web shooter on each hand to you can swing two times after each other! Great job and Vid 😄
Imagine the next ten years later he will be building nano tech
Good job, this is beautiful in your future you be real  Spider-Man don’t give up just keep think and make to fly everywhere. Good job you make the web shooters 😄👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍🤘🕷️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️
2:25 nilered sneak
Bro needs to sell these
Holy mother you guys are awesome!!!🔥
Time for the military to invest
bro in like a few years the next spider man will be irl
hi JLaserVideo when will you upload it in spanish?
Now it's time to do it from a tall buliding!
That failed
Please give it to me😢
This actually crazy I hope he makes a more advanced one that we can buy
I bet only 2% of people heard nile reds voice in the vid
You should add a detaching mechanism, like it cuts the rope so you don't have to hold the reverse mechanism and its faster
You used vacuums to wall crawl, why not do that here?
I'm betting on all my money someone's going to use this project just to be Spider-Man
Do a Miles Morales related invention
great now swing release swing release from building to building and stop a mugging
Where do I buy??
you should implement this into another project where you try and recreate ODM gear from attack on titan ive seen like all the stuff needed for it in your videos but the one making me make this comment is this one because of the hooks and motor supporting your weight from another place instead of just your arms which is what they use in the anime so they dont have all the force pulling on one spot or so they can somewhat equalize it
Llllll
If people’s make this that can actually be used properly and hold 2 people it could save lives say the floor collapsed in a fire a fireman could use it to swing across and swing back to save innocents
Imagine trying to rob this guy and he webs you while flying an iron man suit 😂
PLEASE MAKE A SECOND ONE
That's very dope.  Love the passion & determination you have man
That's Batman utility belt actually
Bro looks like Toby Magiure aswell
Dude what's up that's amazing can i have for free pls man
so now put it with the spidey sense mask made by hacksmith
2:26 Is that Nile Red??
2:26, bro's voice turned into NileRed 💀
This is more like Batmans gadget
The final version reminds me alot of the omni directional gear from aot
man i really want one
2:24 love how he turns into Action Lab there for a second
Make two of them
8:58 if you hit glass with this you'll fall
Bought one and took my gf on a date and opened the door for her with it
Watching this video, I realized how similar your version of the web shooters are to ODM gear from Attack on Titan… maybe another video idea??
Attack on Titan, ODM gear or dragon ball scouter
you should make loki's staff
This is why i study To make stuff like this one day
Very good concept but our technology is still miles of from the real thing.
If you have a hexagon dart and barrel then the dart will fly straight and maybe you could use screws as well if it spun strong enough
What if you made a lot of really tiny versions of the hammers that were on the tip of the web and dispense spikes nails to hold off of, instead of 1 it would havr more surface area and hold stronger + look better, would be hard tho ngl
Make a carnage suit
now he just needs super strength
dope
My webshooter won’t fire at its full length what should I do
so tuff
bro andrew garfield
This dude really looks like the actor tho from spider man
Kai just got that web shooter 🤣 and he made it look like garbage  But forreal this is so dope i love when people take childhood fantasies and turn them into reality, imagine as a kid having something like this it would be insane
Now all you need is the proportional strength of a spider  not that hard
You should try to get to Tom Holland to wear these😅
The Web Spike
he just let out his inner nile red 2:23
Missed opportunity to scream Tally Ho! when swinging from the second story lmao
Next video: Making a radioactive spider! (Actually becoming Spider-Man!)
Making all things that shoot is my specialty
The reason a web swing never works is centered around the idea that when Spider-Man reaches the highest peak of the first swing, that is, just as he is about to break free of the web, he takes off and then he is ready to swing the second web, exactly as it is in the first swing, this happens because of the special powers it has (obviously). What I mean is that even if we humans had the ability to release webs, still swinging in the air would be something very difficult to achieve.
2:20 this is like what spiderman did
Less Spiderman, more Batman.
You should have this on one arm and the one that grapples onto people or branches on the other hand
The Nile red thing got me
I feel like if people gave hip proper funding and materials he would be every superhero
I have an idea to make this legit make the serum in (2:39) and add the rat trap glue to the mix and with enough glue you can make the thing sticky which also looks like the real this and (MIGHT) work take this to consideration if you want
I pray that within the next 60 years some scientist discovers an actual web fluid formula that works🤞
Did he use a nile red reference?
Whew to buy the mini version
bro is never losing the floor is lava again
This is not spider man it is attack on titan😂
I love spider-man can I have the iron spider man Suit it's is my favorite suit I have the suit just not with the claws
Thanks to these web shooters my parents will get me some
i remember thinking those toy web shooters actually worked like in the movie... I was not a smart kid
Make a second one for your other arm and make them have multiple rounds please
Tou should be in the next spider man movie so marvel doesn't get broke
Make the fire swords from the game god of war ❤️from india
Do you plan on putting all of your spiderman inventions into one suit to really feel like spiderman
this man is actually pioneering right now. this is amazing to witness in real time
bro what if you made 2 and then swung around the town
I bought one of those spider man things and bro it’s awesome thank you so much j lazer for offering this amazing experience
Freaking insane brilliantly done
Make iron man arc reactor from movie
If some youtuber could build this is his garage, imagine if the government actually tried to develop something like this?
I just ordered that web shooter after watching across the spider verse. This is every kids dream
Some ideas:   You could have an unstuck device on the blaster that you send down the rope, either with a wheel climber or just rolling it down/pulling yourself forwards, with a small piston that screws into grooves along the hammer, pressing agains the surface and unsticking with a button press/piston push.   Another idea would be making a moldable suction cup/plastic & fiber to stick to things instead, have it come out partially heated and then cool once it lands, then when you need it back send heat down a thin copper wire inside the mesh to make it malleable again.
I think you should build some wings Big big wings they try to modify them my flapping them and you can actual fly human powered trying to do that no helicopters are plays already that just human powered flying flesh large flapping wigs that you could actual
Introducing the iron spider
Bro, hit us with the NileRed references
This dude was like, "Im gonna be Spider-man when I grow up" an actually did it. On another note, I could totally see the CIA showing up at his house like, "We need you to show us how your invention works for....Stuff!"
How tf is that even possible 😮
How much
Мечта..
4:08 is when it shows the web shooter u can buy
Keep up the good work 🎉😊
Hello Jlaservideo I wanted to ask you  What was the green sticky material that you used to hold up the miles morales painting
Put the original web shooters for sale for the people that have less money please!
Try caulobacter crescentus
Or micro glue but it was like reusable glue
Wait what if you had reusable webs that pulls in really fast on both hands and put micro magnets in the webs.🧐
well if in world suddenly appear Spider-Man, we know who is gonna be
Make elucidator from SAO with working sword skills to slice faster or stronger of stuff.
Well I mean wish I could get one of those webshooters
wish I could get one
Make the spiderman wingsuit.
How do you get to the web shooter I've always wanted one in my life and I can never get one
may i have one pls its for my kid
Just watched the new Spider-Man animated movie. I’m buying this.
You should use that net on your other arm so when you swing you can grab other stuff or people to pull towards you.
Vr headset
You can make 10x stronger so you can shoot it and grapple up
make iron  giant
What if you had a mechanic that when you release the button the string somehow  cuts off?
You should of made the nails barbed
Definitely need one on each hand.
Vr headset how is your day
These guys are too good
Efforts like these need to be encouraged, this is how invention starts
What if you made the web bomb from the spiderman game using the net.😁
You should make another one on your other hand and you can do a double swing
w h y d i d y o u s a y "w h i t e g o o"
Hello from Mexico. My name is Jonatan, I follow all your videos. So I would like to suggest a new challenge for your channel! the blasters and the mask of Stard lord. Blessings!
Can you make a hologram pen.I will send    you a blue print .
Why do you look so much like airack?
Oh wow u guys are so smart I could never build stuff like that even if my dream is close to this (engineering). But that Thor hammer was out of this world I wish when I’m older ima make some Lightning rods and make the hammer better by maybe using magnets really strong magnets that are connected to each other so it can fly but it needs to be more stable probably
I’m no engineer but in theory it wouldn’t be too difficult to remodel this as Odm gear from aot
make spidey sensors for your neck
WE NEED MORE OF THIS BECOMING SPIDERMAN JOURNEY BRO
try with one on each hand, at least two shots
If you wear two of them you can literally just keep shooting and swinging 😭😭 I didn’t expect this to be so cool!!
spiderman but his webs actually kill
Now all he needs is to do is make it smaller and make one for the other hand
Odm gear next💀
Awesome
my brother when crazy
If you can somehow make two of these, you could start swinging like actually like Spider-Man like you can do it twice instead of just one time
I think I remember another YouTuber trying to replicate Spider-Man's swinging, and he had the great idea of using an exo-skeleton, so that when you swing you're safer and also the tension is distributed throughout your body. Could be a good idea to implement with your shooters!
i think the closest you could ever get to spiderman is to have a bulky suit like halo or doom to fit everything util in
Yo why’d you move my house
now its look like ODM gear from attack on titan not web shooter
PLEASE sell the bouncing frisby!
I want one.
make the wings spider man had when he saved people from an elevator
Please make attack on titan gear
so, not a WEB shooter.
spidermans spiderman
Just making a prediction here: this kind of innovation paired with a government budget would revolutionize search and rescue equipment
that was pretty cool ngl
You should make it retractable
The video nobody asked for, but we all needed
I know what you should do make rocket boots with sensors like when you get like close the the ground they activate for no fall damage
So how long do those take to desolve?
For the people saying he is getting close (which he is) it would he impossible for us to swing from building to building. Spiderman is able to do it because he has super strength which allows his arms not to tear off when he swings. While this is really cool and looks awesome, it wont actually let you swing from building to building.
thx to you I can finally become my favourite super hero you are a great person
So he made a grappling hook?
make your mum
Please make it available in India
maybe you should make fire blasters plz
Someone send this to Tom holland
Ive seen alot of web shooters but you my man are the closest I'm so getting one or twelve
I have an idea so you wouldn’t have to  reel it in. You could have a lever that you hold to shoot out the web which is on some sort of spindle that just spins and grips when you let go of the lever
A hulk hand that can smash through walls
PLEAS!!!
MAKE ODM GEAR FROM ATTACK ON TITAN
Lol put your iron man jets on it
Yo if u got the web shooter comment on this comment and rate it and tell me how it was.😊
Where do I buy this?
Naw homie finna be the real spiderman soon
You and hacksmith should join forces, both of your teams together with the right funding and manufacturing equipment could make any sci fi gadget and basically change the world. You guys are like the Étienne Lenoirs/ Joseph Swans/ Charles Babbages of the new era, attempting that which scientists and engineers claim impossible and slowly making it’s reality.
I found your web shooters on shop and man after seeing this I might have to get one they will go good with my miles morales Jordan’s
While I know this is all fun and games, there's actually scientists who's been working on graphene infused spider web. This is really the direction it has to go, if we're gonna get remotely close to having a material, that would be strong enough to carry a human. I read an article where they said, it could potentially have the strength to catch a falling plane.  But the next challenge would then be storage capacity and somehow generate more of it at a rapid rate - cause that's what spiders do by nature in their abdomen. Then a set of spinnerets would have to propel it with quite the velocity and stick to the desired target. But as I said, graphene infused spider web is where we should be looking 🙂
Fishing rod webshooter?
why don't you add one on each arm so you can swing from one place to another.
webs that taze like in far from home
all my dreams a kid just came back because of this guy.
the real spider man is laughing hard wathcing this😁
You know what im thinking to climb wall made if medal you could put really power full magnets but like fingers magnets and put It inside of a glove to climb wall and magnets in the spider man foot but only to climb metal
I’m buying the spider man web it’s cool
idea: add a mechanism into the hammer to push itself out of the wall its into at the push of a button so that you could reel it back in and reuse it
You need to make two for both arms so you can keep swinging
Omg
He's basically making a grappling hook with extra steps 😂
3:06  that's what she said  -Michael scott
2:26 *Vine boom* *vine boom*🤨
Making off things that shoot is kind of my specialty💀Yeah me too...
Yall do realize that ironman and spiderman (probbablly even batman) will become real in next houndred years? right!
how about you make another one to add another swing right after the first one?
Man I wanted to buy the web shooter but am from Saudi Arabia and it can’t come to Saudi pls reply I want this for my birthday pls:(
We might start seeing the first superheroes in history
all he need to do left is to climb the wall edit- i didnt watch it full yet back then
2:25 wait i know that voice😂
feel like making web shooters with the technology we have now won't be hard it's just people like this don't have the budget a company would need to do it
This made my day as a child I was a big fan of spider-man
is no one going to mention the nile red reference and voice🤣
You should make a fox hat that gives you super good hearing
I want one N.O.W
Now build one for the other arm so that you can chain two swings together
How does Spiderman does it?  Canonically he can lift a train car. That's how he does it.
In slightly earlier spider man movies, does he use peanut butter in his mixture.
🕸🕷
This is turning into Batman's tech.
just need to learn how to do tricks spiderman
Make a mandolorian suit or a lightsaber
This is the closes to a real life Spider-Man there is, now time to make something that improves/upgrades your jumping ability then you can officially be named The Spider-Man, also get your aunt to change her name to May...
Bro too afraid to make the infinity stones 💀
That’s a Batman gadget.
that hammer thing is a really dangerous weapon tho
Less Spider-Man and more Bionic Commando. Still very impressive.
This is going to actually e the world’s first spider man 👍🏿
This guy got some big brains 🧠 🎉
Next video is "Building doc-ocs suit"
0:17 I nut just like that
This would be a better batarang rope launcher
Make a transformer
He looks more like the Rope Hero than Spiderman
Just imagine like 20 years from now if he keeps improving on theses designs
try and make luffys long arms
This is like batman if im being honest
love the energy in the videos keep making some kind of videos everyone loves them especially me❤😊
You  lost me at magnet...
odm gear early stages
anyone else hear nile red during the vid?
this entire video i was running around going crazy about how cool this because i am a really big spider man fan
J Lazaro can you make actaul spider webs
Imagine this is getting better in the future and you can actually buy this and really swing like spider-man
Please turn me into Miles morales 😢💯💯💯💯
imagine u come to a bank robbery like that
who else heard nilered for a second
Broooo i would honestly buy 2 web shooters if you deliver to south Africa bro please this is my dream right here❤❤❤
Bro…..respect!💯😎
Youd need to make the webshooters bigger and basically support your whole arm so that if you are able to make ones that can swing your arms dont tear off
My brother bought the toy web shooter it worked great for a long time (12 hours) but it sort of broke. We would really like it if you could tell us how to fix it, we also love to watch your videos.
how do i shot web
and now the second hand
Bro used nile red over their lol😂
😂🤔🕸🕷🇦🇺
COOL BRO
I always wondered what would happen to Spiderman webs after he detached from them, wouldn't new York be covered in them over time.
Wasn’t expecting much but this is actually impressive. Way to go!
Can you please try this :  Run - jump - fall - swing
You from Spiderman (the net) to Batman (the grappling hook)
He could probably even adjust the net web and implement it into the design. Perhaps add a third tube that can launch the net. It wouldn't have to necessarily be able to pull something but spiderman uses his webs to detain bad guys so it could be as (relatively) simple as making a small net cannon that would be able to fire a net roughly the size of a person. Make it capable of the mobility function and the crime fighting function that immobilizes enemies without hurting them.
That man has no regard for ceiling maintanence
This is the only person worthy of wielding the suit.
What if you make two of them so you can double swing
Lame
bro make a two swings and swing with two and youl be the closest to be spider man
I think you should make another so you can chain a swing with another.
Dude, use another one in the other hand. It would give you more balance and you could go from one place to another more easily. And it is amazing, you have my same idea of magnents. You have a huge future on this.
So you’re saying that the military could eventually put together their own avengers with a Steroid man, this Spidey suit, the iron man suit they’re working on, an assassin and a man with a super bow and arrow
i like how you can see gas expul out of the firing mechanism, which means andrew garfield amazing spider-man is the most accurate to the real world version :) that steam puff!
there are silent grappers for years in existence, so being spider-man with sound of shots ? no wonder people would think he is a menace.
learn to fight and this is it u can becime spiderman
This is awesome
This is so cool
Bro wanted to be spider man Instead became BATMAN😂
This can be a grapling hook though
Those wall climbers put him in the most fruity position😂😂
this is insane, it could help emergency responders reach high places to rescue people if it's refined and enhanced to hold even more weight
chinese guns ripped you off
cool you created technology that has been around for centuries, the grappling hook.
its looks like it would be very usefull for swat or the military if you could up the psi an try make it a little smaller and get a stronger rope to support more weight like a smaller grappling hook for breaching. maybe try make it more quite too.
thats cool but spider man can jump high then he shoots webs so he dont rlly need to have the power to grab him self he just jump shoot stick and swing and try to make a hold button for the shooters like u when u hold the button that shoots webs and once u leave the button it release and catch the web fast when it release and I hope I helped and gave u some ideas
Finally a web shooters that actually sticks to stuff and doesn't rely on magnets or hooks. Ngl I didn't think it was possible
Awesome! But technically, it's more Batman then Spiderman)
Bro is the real life Tony Stark
the we net seems very practical for law enforcement in foot chases
a deadly murder weapon
I'm from Indonesia and spiderman fan... Can I buy it? 😅
What about trying to make the ODM gear from AoT? It has a pretty decent explanation on how it works.
He's still a bit away from actually having something like spiderman but he's practically made an exact functional replica of Batmans grapple
First video of yours I've seen. I'm a subscriber now too.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
super cool!!!
This whole system is basically batman's grappling hook too
what if there was a chemical thing which is liquid normally but when it touches the air it gets thick and sticks so strong and some systems to push it from the shooter with using pressure and something like that, that would be amazing
This piece of tech resembles more to one of those gun thingies that Batman shoots to the ceilings when he wants to ascend to the top and exit a building
Awesome
Predator
The Nile red refrence 😂😂😂
Now put a web shooter on the other hand and try to transfer and release to swing across the warehouse
Yes you are realy spider man  Fantastic
rl spider_man
Not impressed until i get a omnitrix
Nile red be like😮
With the thing on his waist holding him, it's more like ODM gear
Imagine in 2050 we have the technology to actually build a movie accurate size, functional web shooter with a discovery in chemical web fluid that could actually hold human weight. I guess the only problem would be our own strength.
Military or Nasa needs to get in on this, we can have a Spidey Unit
You could make a high voltage version, either one that shoots retractable electrodes, or one with a high voltage capacitor on the end instead of a magnet, which ideally could be charged again after retracting.
Bro is sounding smarter than Mark Rober.
Pete?
What if you made it so u could create a wire or sum for the web and make enough suction to stick to stuff like the wall climbers
Well I looked here to help but it doesn’t help with swinging through the city maybe you could make that
You thermal paste
This is super cool
I remember when i was some 9yrs or so, I kept searching for web shooters to build at home at yt. And after almost 10 yrs, this is what yt recommended and i clicked straight. Bud keep up the good work. Nc progress ppl r making
Too bad everyone knows your "secret identity"
Next Up : Man makes green flying wings and calls himself a “Vulture”
Let's all take a second to appreciate that our real-world spider-man is also tony stark
🥲
6:30 “That’s instant kill mode right there” perfect reference from homecoming😂
The Sonic Screwdriver?
Nows the time to get someone like Nilered to work with the chemical composition of real spiderwebs and casually make significant scientific/technological breakthroughs
If they can do this...what does the military have?
Neat! Would work better as a Batman grappling gun too ❤❤❤
On the road one give me the real Brunch I want to rope rob Shuter 6:55
This guys videos are so interesting and cool to watch how he just develops something that seems impossible
Why are half of the commenters trying to be poets or smth 😑
Give me for free
Chanel web shoter
YOU SHOULD MAKE ONE FOR UR OTHER ARM AND SWING TWICE
Last thing: exoskeleton for strenght.
Make second hand gun, shoot second web while swinging then detach first web, finish swing on second web and then detach second web.
He needed help just not from you 6:19
Although it's cool.but it kinda feels a Batman's grapple gun, but it's cool though. 16:32
Now you need another one and try for two swings
Can you build a real rocket but you can fit inside it Thank you
Now shoot someone with it I promise it won't hurt trust me
ftw attack on titan is more plausible than spider man.
If you build one for each hand and somehow make it so your able to shoot multiple times without having to stop swinging and reload you could swing multiple times and do flips and stuff like spiderman does.
Me when I was like 5 would b wanting this at Toys R Us
That video turned from making spiderman web shooters to making Rico Rodriguez grappling hook really quickly xD
This is actually closer to Batman’s grappling hook gun thing than Spider-Man’s webs, I love it regardless.
Nilered at 2:25 🎉😂
This is my child dream 😂😂😂 I love it
Is it just me or I think he actually created the Batman grapple gun?
yoooooooooooo you should make a hang glider setup that looks like falcon wings and have it fold up. then put on the iron man jetpack lol
I would like to see double it up one on each arm so you can swing across a distance, you already did double barrel haha
This isn't airack?
Please make watch car yousing chat gpt
So I started watching the spectacular spider man show again and I noticed the episode where chameleon imitates Spider-Man’s web slinging, his webs have spikes at the end of them. Made me think of this video lol
I want one too
Make two so you can swing from web line tow web line. If you can do that, you're officially Spider-Man.
make a real lightsaber
The only thing is if u wanna swing on buildings you can’t really use it 😅 since it could damage it but this is sick I love the content
I feel like most of these are knowingly a bad idea. Like using super glue or a screw. None of those things are even remotely good ideas for this. And the other “spider man webs” are not webs at all.
I think marvel should give this man a cameo 🔥
I can’t login
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy made  Spidey's webshooter
fab.....job guys
should add for another hand
Can I pay in person?
You should send a prototype to @hero
Make Shang chi working ten rings
Spiderman can't shoot web on people. Or spiderman have killed too many people
just cause grappling hook
I wanna see this with double so you can do chain swings 💯
I am genuinely impressed, about to buy one of those little ones right now so I can piss my gf off all weekend😌😌 with my harry potter fire wand and this, I will be half way complete, all I need now is a lightsaber and an actual hoverboard and I'll be complete of fulfilling my childhood dreams
You need a mechanism to retract and release the web
Hacksmiths are closer to Iron man , Jlaser is closer to Spiderman ❤
You should make the star lord retractable mask.
Spooder man
Need two gotta swing from one to the other!
Next thing ya need is spidey senses
It looks like a grappling gun more than a web shooter but your inventions are amazing. It will certainly be an inspiration to follow. Keep making things like this, We'll be there one day.
All you have to do is catch the leprechaun and then you can whisper Spider-Man powers
No one’s gonna talk about 2:24 ???? Like at all.
Hear me out... use this to make odm gear from attack on titan
I feel like you could make legit Attack on Titan gear
Mass produce this equipment to those who put their life to save others. Look useful in certain circumstances or for emergency escape like building on fire. Why wait for rescue when you can escape through the window by fire the rope shooter to something inside the room that can hold and climb down from your windows. Assuming the rope is customize to the length from the building height.
You should make another one for Ur other hand bro
It may not be the same with spiderman's web but you just made the best batman grappling gun in the internet
This guy is so good he’s not look other channels aswell he has a low budget and always manages to pull it off
Give me this articul  for 1.000.00 dollar's for you
This man is the real Spider-Man
sickk
Bro made ODM gear
You give Hacksmith Industries a run for their money- impressive!
Bro could literally get hired by the government
How is this guy so smart he’s smarter than me
Smaller version please
Real life spooder man
bruh....why shoot them at the fish tank though? Keep up the good work though
Need to do more than 2 consecutive swings to be Spiderman
You F'd up that roof in that warehouse with those shots...
This is so beautiful, hit me up if you're interested in forex
If we got this now, then there's no way we won't have better in the future
Useless if it can only shoot 1 rope
it would be so crazy if they added a costume like this 17:37  into the spider man games
But in the end you're not spiderman, you're batman with red costume
its a grappling gun
Literally just becomes scorpion dressed as spiderman
What’s your next move ? Spider ? Fly in the air?
Mix all spiderman things to make the unltimate spiderman suit
Yo..bro might really become spiderman he starting to convince me he right 😮🤣😂
one day this guy is going to make a real web shooter that actually shoots web
Shout out to Niles red...I peeped the voice
Irl super heros are in the near future who else agrees
Question? Why your Wrist?   Couldn't it have been more of a back harness? Then to the wrist so when you swing you have more control of your body and arm... Versus just your wrist?   I feel like the support on your back with the swing would be better 🤔🤔
I dare you to make a spider man mask that blinks, put it on, and use the web shooter, basically be Spider-Man irl, See what people think!
Dude doing what we all wanna do deep down, make gadgets that can turn us into our favourite super hero lol
He got grapple hook
can u have a full spiderman outfiit with the webshooter and try to convince people u r rlly the actual spjderman lol
Still meh 😂
why did he sniff during the glue section?!, also i feel like that's only an ammerican thing nail shooter
By swinging from buildings
Normal people: "Oh, this is awesome!" The Government: "How can we weaponize this??" >:/
Why’s this dude shooting his fish tank 💀
Hi
Ñ😂ññññññññ
Have you ever tried to reverse engineer, actual spider, silk And then create a mechanism that shoots it out with a thickness and with enough of intensity for an instant sticks, I can hold a human?…And then maybe even gather the fibers from the material to make a suit… Probably impossible but it’s an idea that I like to play with
Make a  web shooter very small and very parverful to swonk on
Can someone reply this: I am a kid. If I buy this web shooter, can it make me swing? I am a kid and I am only 20something kg heavy
Hey I hope I'm not lost in the crazy amount of comments, and I almost hope I'm not the first person to suggest this-  Did you play with the thought of using a rope with a conductive strand or 2? 2 being key because in my mind, when you put the blanks back in the nail shooter, you could also put in a new charge on a circuit to stop the rope with your grippy garden shears once the 'charge' of the nail goes off. Spidey usually releases or drops down hundreds of feet and grips it anyway. If Spidey wants to go up, he shoots, and yanks up with super strength. An auto reloadable web shooter won't get you there unless arm day is every day, or you combine it with some crazy exosuit (superhero level lbf).  Either way, kudos to your achievements and I can't wait to buy one of the magnet shooters for me and a friend. I haven't looked to see if it's available at this time, but I hope it is someday soon if not.
he tried to make a web shooter and accidentally made the best batclaw I've ever seen
Halobang
make a working nano tech suit.
You gotta make another then swing with both of them
Making dream comes true
spiderman would pretend to be impressed
Could you please make Shang chi ten rings totally understand if you can’t
More like batman staff
Please make green goblins helmet
Ever think you might's also just created Batman's Grappling Gun?
He’s building more of a Batman grappling gun.  Which is fantastic too
This is like iron man's first suit lol
4:33 Shut up and take my money!!!
Build a real webshooter with the nylon fluid let it heat up
This technology MUST be destroyed!…before it falls into the wrong hands!! lol
The guy in the background always hyping it up. “That was sick!” 😂 super cool
Make a cool James Bond car with gadgets if you have never made them
Put the suit u made with the spider arms and this
Don't know about web shooter. Might work better as a hook shot.
They gon use this for a mission imposible movie 😂
Make more and repetitive swing all while in air pls it will be so much cooler
4:11 whoever watched all of the Tobey maguire movies. Even the 3rd one when all of them were coming out deserves one of these
I recognised that voice when u were mixing the chemicals
Bought the webshooter… completely broke after not even an hour of use. Emailed and got nothing back
now I can use it to get beer from the fridge without getting up
thts not spiderman ..its mortal kombat scorpion
I remember stunt men turning down doing any webslinging stunts in the Raimi films because the g-force would literally tear your arms off.
This is so cool
wat is the neim of the  wevseit
Now all you need is a girlfriend
Pizza time!!!
When i saw him climb up the wall with the climbers and then swing from the ceiling i finally felt like we  are actually close to achieving spiderman. It would be so cool to have two different grapplers to chain the swing.
What is the first mini shooter that shoots anything in the intro called so I can buy it?
I got my web shooter yesterday. this is the coolest thing I have ever owned
2:26 NileRed using his voiceover cameo payments to sustain himself til his next video
Give this man Elon Musks kind of money and let’s see what happens 😮😁
now make a second one and go double swing XD
If this guy can do this I can’t imagine what the Government could have😅
does the shooters come with the magnets or stuff
what about glass
All of it at once
Hey Jake 4 days ago was my birthday i wanted to know if i could get one for free or discounted i can send proof of DOB
💩 poop poooooooooooooooop
Casually disses mythbusters 😆
Even though I’m typing this 1 month later YIU should hang upside down for a YouTube short
I want it :(
Loved the NileRed bit in there.
okay 2025 is gonna be wicked
Man goes to make a spider web shooter ends up making a working real life hook shot.
Make it two please
With so many youtubers that create stuff from fiction in 20 years people will swinging building to building to go to work
This mf WILL be the new spiderman
I can't belive that I life in a time where I get to see this become reality! My utmost respect!
Neat webshooters.
Its a huge achievement. This will defenetly get used in military soon.
Make me a web shooter
Where to buy web shooter ? And how much in Kenya shillings
can i put a stronger motor in the shooter i just want it to shoot a littler harder. how would i do it is the spring that give it the power
Thx a lot for ruining my birthday the swinging device I ordered its absolutely useless it was already destroyed Idk if this is just for me or for other people I just want you to know that you ruined a special event in someones life
Mates, the age of superheroes is not far away
at this rate ill be black suit spidey irl soon
It spider guy
I thought the pruning shears were going to be to cut the rope so you could quickly detach. Might not be a bad idea.
spiderman in realverse
13:18 that part in Spiderman 1 where Tobey walks away after throwing a tray full of food on Flash.
I don't love the movie but in the movie "after earth" with Will Smith and his son they have a really cool suit and weapon that can adapt based on the user's needs. I'm not sure if making the suit would be possible, but I would love to see you make the weapon!
Okay, it seems to me the next logical project is the thing they got in Attack on Titan that they use to swing around
Herodw needs this
translate in spanish this video please
My web shooter just arrived and it seems to not work, is it the battery? If it is how do i recharge it?
13:19 was a spider-man reference from the cafeteria scene when he drags his luch tray across the floor.🧐
Now you just have to find a way to shoot twice in quick succession, and you're basically Spiderman
Kinda reminds me of odm gear from snk
How to remove the web
Can you do odm gear form attack on titan next?
Wow it's very nice 😮😮😮😊
This is litteraly just the grapple hook from batman...
i got my webshooter today, and i noticed one huge flaw that, if you changed, would make it completly one handed. As of right now, the reel back and fire are 2 different switches. when the reel should be activated by pushing the shoot switch in the opposite direction. tap down to fire tap up to reel in. just my thoughts. to me, that would male it so much better.
this guy must give some amazing gifts
Can u make the web shooter cheaper because i am ordering from hong kong and its very expensive for me it costs me $460.7!!PLEASE and MAKE ANOTHER PAYMENT METHOD PUT CASH I DONT HAVE ANY OTHER METHOD TO PAY EXCEPT WESTERN UNION YOU THE CASH
Thats sick!
Maybe use something more organic if you know what i am saying 😏
Make thors hammer
I've got one of those.😂😂😂
Spiderman using darts is actually a terrifying concept
Ive been waiting for this video ever since the $2 web shooter vid
JLaser is trying to become spiderman, qnd the hacksmith is trying to be ironman, perfect pair
https://youtu.be/LOXDawfUS30
I thought you said IT ACTUALLY STINKS!
I don't know if it will be possible to create the retractable black panther claws but they would be very cool, give me a like to see if he can make them😅😅
I swear in 10 more year you'll see someone swinging around and it will be this guy
I wonder though if they did a jump then shoot experiment cuz that would be awesome since it can hold his weight, I wonder how it will handle the added weight when he is falling
Very reasonable price on the web shooter gotta say
now you can make a second web shooter and fly like spider-man?
Ik im super late but maybe you could make a nail release and when its locked in it reloads the nail, if you have one on each arm that would be 4 so the reload wouldn't even have to be super fast
"Dance monkey" is crazy 😂
You need two web shooter
Put together all your spider man stuff together pls (pin me)
YOSS FINALLYYYYYYYYYY
nilered don't hide from me I know I heard u
Bra accidentally made Batman’s grappling hook
If only Stan lee was here to see this
it is not much like the web-shooter but it's like the Graper gun and what about releasing it from the top not from the shooter
The last step will be to find a supervillain
This is awesome, however maybe not shoot projectiles at the side of a fishtank
Make a miles moralis electric punch
Nilered reference😂
When will these be back in stock?
he’s like the second mark rober
He looks like Elon Musk's son
Imagine he becomes a martial artists and chooses to fight actual crimes with this and genuinely swing just like spider man
Please attempt a real life version of odm gear from attack on titan nobody has done it yet and it’d be awesome
If you had 2 reload capable. You could legit swing across that entire building
I'm not an engineer, so I'd have no idea if this would have the same effect, but couldn't you just use a gun that shoots nails with ropes attached to them? I mean obviously you can't just shove a nail into a gun, but if you're using blank charges to hammer the nails into your target, wouldn't it be easier to just skip carrying around tanks of co2, and just fire the nails using high powered blanks?
and at this point just change the channel name to the Real Peter Parker
he should try to swing off of one wall and stick to another
Even if its not a total web wlunger we got a batman hook
So emotional to watch the entire process, you are a legend.
True hero here!
You should make the electric web shouters
So the Spring Ring is alive?!?! Really hope it gets released
6:51 pause here and you'll see that dude's been going at it with spider-man projects that he's starting to look like young Tobey Maguire
IRON  SPIDER❤
Imagine his progess if he only worked on webs for the next 20 years
The ones at 4:00 you should make those but wayy more pressurized and longer string
Can u tell me what kind of changer it is for the web shooters plz
Now you just need 2 of them so you can stay swinging in the air
Why is my roof leaking?  Oh, Spider-Man was here!
More like Batman's grappling gun.
All right I've been working on something like this myself for like 2 years on and off. The nylon solution that you had is the closest way to do it properly. I'm not a chemist myself but I've mixed around trying to have it combined with a type of adhesive to mixed results it either comes out clumpy or the nylon bonds don't essentially form so it like tears apart really easily. I tried mixing in nylon threads like tiny nylon like shavings to see if that would help with like rigidity but that ended up like clogging up the nozzle. Then my best results was a trying a composition that worked best under heat or pressure then you had the nylon form really well and then it would kind of go through an adhesive coating as it's coming out but getting an adhesive to stick really quickly is an issue I came across as well. My next version I'm going to try and combine some nylon fibers in the solution and the nylon fibers will have like the glue or glue like substance. Probably should use like a two part epoxy I works pretty fast. Anyways that's my my trial and error on this if you want I could send over my designs and stuff it's pretty compact a little smaller than the version that you have for the magnetic string toy. The nozzle system I have set up for mine though is very important it uses a dual nozzle. There's one nozzle inside another nozzle on an actuator that moves closer and further from the opening of the outside nozzle and that allows for either like a string or spray kind of like a net. I've been able to get like a pretty good solid string probably about like a meter or so before it breaks her has some issue or jams up and then the netting I can get it to spread about like a meter in a bit wide. It also has a web ball function but that doesn't really work properly I haven't got the electronics working on that.
That’s crazy, it’s the closest anybody has been to actually swinging like spiderman
Nile red
Now all you need is to make the same exact glove again si you could really swing ( get to , one exemple with the left and then in mid air swing with the right arm and release the left one and so one )
Bro your soo goooddd
Love the NileRed portion when mixing chemicals😂
Imagine if he can put a taser on the mini web shooter and also he can become an actual spiderman if he had the agility and fighting experience like wow just imagine
That net shooter looked promising - now, if only a groundbreaking chemist could make this their life's dream and team up with you lol.
This guys about to become a real life spiderman
2:25 bro really turned into nile red
make a cool flying toy
😂😂😂😂 carrying 50 kilos ....bro thats trash..
This is called a grappling hook
is it possible to reload them in the air and do concecutive swings? like with a shooter in each arm
Next you should make…
I applaud your efforts! At just shy of 53 years old I’ve had a fantasy of being able to swing and fire webs like Spider-Man ever since I was a little fella (I suspect like a lot of kids of all ages).
can i purchase the web shooter in India
yoooo theres something missing... as u see in the spiderman game you can see his webs twist and wraps together and makes it stronger
this is the one iv been waiting for love ur vids and just got one of ur web shooters
Now just throw 2 on and you’re swingin
Fair play for not ripping your fans off either you could of charges 100 pound and some people would of still brought it
steps in the right direction my friend
Make a gun with I did a thing
2:15
8:50 casual Ant-Man cameo
I saw the web shooters are limited for now but do you have a rough idea of when they will be back in stock?
Now I know your already thinking it, but you need another and try to swing twice in once jump. That is pretty sweet though.
I wish you were shipping globally, I was so ready to buy 2 but no shipping to Turkey
Pourrais-tu faire une vidéo pour dire comment😊😊😊😊❤❤❤
100% getting one of the mini version
2:25bro turned into nile red lol
Please
This looked so much more like batman😅
The Nile red shoutout
This is way closer to aot odm gear
Subscraibe
you're technically the og japanese spiderman now like everything (excpet the ak47)
I like it when Spider-Man shoots webs
I have an Idea why don't u build another one of that and swing continuously off both of them
If Russia was to kidnap him every russian soldier would be equipped to be super soldiers. Think about his expertise on the context of covert ops technician..
If you weren't so stuck on marvel that's batman!
you should use the net shooter as a self-defense weapon. they actually sell something like that
You need to duplicate it and swing from 2 without landing or something.
Where do you get that web shooter?
That net web shooter would be amazing for the police to use on suspects
I know I’m late,but this is amazing your definitely getting closer.
can you make the Kingsman's bulletproof umbrella
you sounded just like him XD 2:15
dude they could totally use your webshooter on the movies to save up some time on special effects IMO
make a attack on titan maneuver gear suit.
There is this silicone material that acts like gecko's feet that can stick to anything almost like an adhesive, but can be cleaned with water to make it stick better. I doubt it would work well for the more "full scale" version. But for the toy version I think it'd be ideal, about as strong or stronger than a suction cup but without the need for ideal contact or an airtight surface, and perfectly reusable. I ordered one of yours and plan on making an attachment that uses that material.
My man’s out here brainstorming looking like Superman 😂
bo ja uwielbiam spider mana
ja nawet sam to zrobiłem
mógłbyś to domenie przysłać plis
mayk a firebol bluster
More of a Batman grappling hook but dope asf
I can’t wait until his next video.
you should do one on miraculous.
Is it just me or does this dude sound weirdly like airrack
Isn't there a way to make a glue or smthing that gets really sticky on Impact For just 4 to 5 seconds and hardens out afterwards or smth If we had a material like that that could turn kinetic energy stick power, Real Life Materials in my Head that u could try  1. Building Foam sticks insanely good to almost anything and I think it's possible to modify it to get hard instantly, 1 Capsule with building Foam with the ends of a rope in it second Capsule behind it with a chemical to make the foam harden instantly Not absolutely sure about it but I think it's possible to modify building foam with Kevlar fiber to make it even stronger
bro became nilered
make the  Spiderman homecoming stark suit in the karen and web shooter
Where’s the link
I'm Sorry to disappoint you, but I fear you made an ODM Gear from Attack on Titan
If you mix fewi Kwik and water it wil make a substanse which sticks but it hardens quick
So awesome! Just need to use those garden shears to cut the rope for the release... Quicker, cleaner, better looking... Also more dangerous, so all pluses!
Every cop should have one of ‘em grabbers. So efficient in chases, just shoot a rope web and boom.
Am I to late for the giveaway ?
2:15 bro is making real life web fluid
The bouncing frisbee is a great idea for something to sell
Ngl this is something that the police could use to capture people
bro was looking "AMAZING"!
Dude a chemical that can be a bit stronger than rat glue and activated with electricity to stick not stick would be perfect for this. If that even exists.
bro went from lets use glue to if I hit someone ill kill them
What is your website called? My son wants it.
Man.. This is cool
Love the Nile Red vibes a 2:15! lol
nah that sniff that the glue
I ordered my webshooter bruh where's it at!
Anybody think he just basically built a batgrapple?
Before you get military contract, help me , I'm in need of more tech I can afford. Hard to be a batman with my limitations. I don't have a shop. I have tools but my landlord made me get rid of my outdoor toolbench. I need more tactical armor(light not heavy but efective) need more gadgets. I have to up grade. I'm limited by my budget. I will pay. Make me a head to tow full body stab proof Kevlar jump suit with steel plates to stop at leat a 9mm. How much would it cost. Also I have mimicked education but I'd love to be your janitor. Also skilled in all carpentry.
he said dance monkey
Deadshot wrist cannons
I swear that soon we're gonna all be spiderman 💀
Gotta say, this is very impressive and a really good way to imagine how it would work in real life. Except one funny problem is that the only reason you need a harness is because you just can't support your own body weight and funnily enough (with this entire thing being a mechanism) it legit just makes you seem more like Adam Beach's Slipknot from Suicide Squad, aka "the guy that can climb anything".
Would there be some sort of slightly elastic rope that gets shorter when it cools down to ambient temperature, that you could keep heated before shooting and would cool down as it flies thru the air, fast enough to pull you after hitting the target, but slowly enough to not shrink too much before hitting the target? Or how about the other way around, something that shrinks when heated, and have some sort of chemical or something braided into it, inside some fragile vials, sorta like the inside of glowsticks perhaps, or something like those oxidation-based or phase-change based heating pads, that when tugged would produce heat to make the rope shrink? Or how about braiding the rope with stretched shape-memory alloy springs and heating it with electricity or some other mean to pull you in?
make a full spider suit with the wall climbers and the wet shooters but make it less bulky please
Please don't tap on the glass
... 18:13 Sus
more like a batman stuffs..
You should make the king fu panda 3 jade blades
I'm buying the web shooter whenever my mum allows me
You can make web glue and dishwish mixed
2:20 bro became nilered

I swear, every video this guy makes he just slowly turns into every superhero ever. Now he needs to go back and make the falcons wings fly
Can you make a attack on titan video
I know it's a Spiderman video, but you have successfully became the world's first Batman.... you just need to switch customs
This is more Batman than Spiderman
He is the real life Tony start he is so genius
I have an idea use a spike at the end that is shot with psi/blanks and use cable.
Eventually he will be real spider man
can you make the Doctor's sonic screwdriver?

hey, would you be able to make the green goblin hoverboard from spiderman
Can you make a creeper from Minecraft out of clay?
Hey man this is great! I ordered a webshooter while they said they were still available and emailed and sent a DM regarding it too. If you get a moment could you check that out thank you!
IRON MAN ARM BLADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
meh its ok i guess but very unpractical.. its not even a web or sticky.. wont be able to wrap up enemies or shoot web in their eyes..
so is the sticky web idea out the window cant you find a more sticky substance by chemisty and put it in a capsule that explodes on impact attached to a rope and
this is give me more like a kind of grapple gun like some games and movies since has nails and strong ropes and it stlill awsome ı think like this because since spider man uses a liquid that can act as a exteremly stong rope or string whatere  ı think like this not because its bad   this is basicaly a superhero gadget its amazing  Reminds me of Batman more than Spider-Man, but it's 5 times better. only thing that you have to ignore 20 different holes on the fence,car,ceiling 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Realistically DARPA or some government agency has made something like this but I'm almost certain this is the first time the public has seen something like this. 2 million views is nothing compared to what this video deserves.
Nice

Can’t wait for the day for you or someone else to actually make real web shooters
Make a real life hook shot or claw shot

This glue on this video , we must use it for safety on daily crime use by simple for woman😂
Bro has a better chance at being batman
Legend

Nice vid but what did u pull out?🧐
Not sure what's up with you webshooter backorder, but it's still saying on shopify that the product will be available in two weeks despite the fact I purchased it over a month ago. What kind of scam is this?
9:53 he even looks like the amazing spiderman
2:24 It’s That Guy!!
Hey bro can you sell it for only 30 $ because o don't have that much money and I want it for my best friend's birthday PLEASE

is the spider man mini shooter is one size right adult
Can you make a light saver that can cut stuff and retract
does anyone notice the nile red's voice
Just ordered my webs!!! Can’t wait
Amazing.
Maybe what you should do is make one that can  hold objects.
Imaging making the same thing for other hand. So that you have both hands and you can swing continuously. Would’ve been so fun. Try it out bro
You should get a toy car and make it mind controlling no remotes or anything it is just mind controlling u can Aslong have a camera where u can see it if it was in first person make it mind controlling like what u did with the doctor octopus  arms😊
the only problem with these is that they are only one use
You should make bat-mans utility belt, with all of the functions!
Me thinking I'm already subscribed to Jay laser scene I'm not terrified
Do a hulk suit that increases your strength
Whereis your website
Omg this is so good, could you try to get the web shooters on both hands that way it would be so much cooler! Love you!
i think you should ad in a mechanism that can push you straight letting you swing further
Make a house
This is a top-tier reference to the (2002) Spider-Man movie at 13:20.
FOR ONLY FORTY DOLLARS????? WAIT WHAT?????
day 3 of asking for an ant man thing.
Please make ironman mark 85 suit
You're like the spiderbatman!
Please use the hammer technique from 8:29 and make the omni directional mobility gear from Attack on titan
i know you probably won’t see this but here are all the calculations needed to make a iron man suit without like all the equipment and that kinda stuff but i’m sure you can figure it out   - Mass (m) = 80 kg - Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2 - Drag coefficient (Cd) = 1.2 (Assuming the humanoid has a similar shape to a human) - Cross-sectional area (A) = 1.5 m^2 (Assuming the humanoid has a similar shape to a human) - Air density (rho) = 1.225 kg/m^3 (Assuming standard atmospheric conditions at sea level) - Velocity (v) = 20 m/s (Assuming a constant speed during flight) - Flight time (t) = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds  Equations:   Force of gravity:   F_gravity = m * g   F_gravity = 80 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 784.8 N  Air resistance force:   F_air = 0.5 * Cd * A * rho * v^2   F_air = 0.5 * 1.2 * 1.5 m^2 * 1.225 kg/m^3 * (20 m/s)^2 = 882 N  Total force:  F_total = F_gravity + F_air   F_total = 784.8 N + 882 N = 1666.8 N  Power:  P = F_total * v   P = 1666.8 N * 20 m/s = 33,336 W  Total energy required:  E_total = P * t   E_total = 33,336 W * 1800 s = 60,004,800 J  Therefore, the humanoid would need to generate approximately 60 million joules of energy to sustain flight for 30 minutes, assuming an efficient energy conversion and storage system  have fun dude
this is the most beautiful video i have ever seen on youtube
That’s dope bro. You should make another one for the other hand and attempt to swing twice in a row.
firstly, I wanna say this is so cool, but when he says I was able to pull out some white goo doesn’t sound like him
The nilered cameo😂😂😂
Bro used flex glue
I think it will look extremely cool when you can swing two times in a row, it can be done by wearing another shooter on your other hand.Good video though.
Bro you should make ODM gear
U made a lethal rope launcher
You know what doesnt need a web... Jumping spiders... Learn to jump!
Try doing batman's detective vision
At some point, Marvels going to have to draw you into one of the Spiderverse stories, as the Spider-man of Earth Prime.
Bro let out his inner NileRed
You need to release more web shooters I'm trying to buy one
Next project maybe Dr. Strange's flying cape?  Anyway awesome job. Love your content
Can we see a backpack hang glider, kinda like falcon but you can actually fly.
I had that we shooter toy but it broke😭
can you do a Collab with me      my Chanel is Trent The Sweat         you should do a socker ball that go's in a goal on its own
J Can you make a device that can control gravity
Could you consider doing that same thing but like mikasa's cables from AOT .... How it shoots and how large it was looks more like mikasa's thing...nvm
This is legit so awesome man!!! Great work
can you make a star lord mask? Pleas
day 3 of asking for an ant man thing
Is it for free web shooter
if only i had it
make a superhero suit
jlazervideo can u combine the web shooters with your wall climbers?? that would be sick
11:26 you made the thing from atack on titan
Hi J Laser  you next make real speace out small rocket please build🌞🌛🌜👽✨💫🚀🛸🌐🗺️🗾
The Nile red voice was halarious during the chemistry bit
As a humongous Spider-Man fan also this is so nostalgic and breathtakingly amazing, I feel for the real ease system you should perhaps have a fishing reel like system in which with the mechanical winch you are using to swing have a quick release button and the Motor goes into like a fishing reel in which it lets line out of the spool freely. A bit like a cars handbrake only the reverse, instead of it stoping the line it releases it
Make death swords from puss and boots
Can you please send me a Web shooter please
Dance money bruh
This would be like batman equipment.
Should’ve went the genetic manipulation route
Make Batman’s grapple gun
This is great but if u can make it even more compact it would be amazing
spider man in ohio  i love your vids, gg for the shooters
Why isn't there an Indonesian option on the website? Even though if there was, maybe Indonesians would buy it
Day 2 of asking for an ant man product
So sickk man im jealous
do an led holographic watch
Please make telekinesis gloves
Make assasian creed hiden sword
fly like super man
Its not just a web shooter its also a grappling hook for spy missions
I know it probably wouldn’t fit in one suit and be practical but it would be so cool to combine the climbing spiderman suit and the web shooters  Update: oh I didn’t realise you already did that
a lightsaber
wolverine claws that you control with your mind
a cyclops eye visor that shoots some kinda laser
next video: i saved new york city from all its criminals!!
I wish he tried swinging then sticking to a wall
can u make the Batman suit from Batman v Superman dawn of justice
Did you say dance monkey i don’t like that because people at my school be say that to me and my friends. N a racist way
free displate ad
Now you need to make ODM gear with this technology 😁
We had so much fun playing with the web shooter! 🕸️  https://youtube.com/shorts/6ec0gQmIWE8?feature=share
We need this to be completed
Now you just need two of them
Should do like American ninja warrior but with custom suits
This is so freaking awesome. Next video...a mechanism on each hand. Swing from one then shoot another and swing from that. You can probably make it across that building. You can do it! You're almost there!
Hey make a big robot you can pilot by going inside and make it have weapons like from the show.       Mech-X 4
There's only one problem... all the lawsuits your getting for permanent property damage.
You think web shooter, me think grappling gun
You need to make a Spiderman mask with moving lenses! Like they scan your eye lids to see if there open or closed lol
Could you make the call of duty black ops 2 wingsuit suit?
now what you need is to be able to alternate between two shooters so you can really swing. shooting one rope and let inertia carry you is fun and a great acomplishment but you are still far from home.  I would advice to make the device smaller since spiderman has always been about agility and that thing is too bulky. but, I won't deny it. it looks cool and promising.
build boots that make you FLY!!!basically iron man boots
I guess you swing all ways now👀
This guy has done it🤔👍👍👍👍👍👍
Dude please, make YuGiOh Reald Duele Disk possible 🙏🏻
4:09 I have the exact same one and I go to the park with the suit on and all the kids crowd around me
Day 1 of  asking for an ant man thing

Just imagine how useful his gadgets would be if a zombie apocalypse occurs...
imagine how spide with this gear will save Gwen from falling haha she will be killed by screw shot
Make full Spider-man suit…yk climb all kind of walls and shooting web were it can stick every where plus you can swing all in 1 suit plssss i want one like that
I know the one thing he can’t do: make an actual dark star jet that you can fly inside
One thing to learn from this video:           Everything works on the 2nd Try :)
And he was the one that told him to make Spider-Man
What is Spider-Man is real he just posted this video the wall climbing video few years after they made Spider-Man
I want to know how comfortable / uncomfortable that is
15:39 Ohio spider man🤣😂😂 (no offence love your vids)
A year from now he is gonna be fighting purple aliens
you should make GL power ring
You need one for each wrist sk then when you in the air you can shoot again release the first one and swing a further distance while looking like Spider-Man more
When he pulled the tire cover off and dragged it like Toby did in the first movie compliments to the chef 👌🏻👌🏻
You could totally go fight crime with that. Next time you see a j Walker you know exactly what to do😂
Dope reef tank!
Can't wait for my webshooters to get here!
❤
He almost has the main component of a Hookshot from Zelda. Or ODM gear from Attack on Titan
Está súper 👻💀
A Brazilian Channel did this First.
Can you make a full metal infinity gauntlet
I thought that he did a a actual spiderweb not a fake one
But Spider-Man’s web is just specific chemicals combined
Only thing left is the super strength you can really swing around the city when you cant pull 15 tons of force haha
Madame un saludo
Make a dark Vader suit with a real light saber
Make wonder women’s whip
OMG. With this, you could make the attack on titan gear!
Nah that plank he super glued is stuck there forever😭
Look up my name in the patent office to get just an idea of the transport tech involved. We will strive to contact you at a later date with the rest of the information if we get some reply from this post with the people
How about you use something like 3:07 but more stronger. Cuz what if i want to swing like spidey but i dont want to damage the roof? Plus can you so something so you can climb all kind of walls?
hmmm?
Next a time machine
Get a DARPA create tools for our special ops. Alpha sky will be hitting you up later with the transport vehicle straight out of avengers, with the right funding, we can make it all real for our special ops soldiers.
I mite ask y father
I don't know I'm kinda getting batman vibes from this.
Build nightwing escrima sticks
2:27 BRUHHHHHH this is Nile reds voice 😂😂😂😂
his man is tony stark in the making
As soon as I saw the one he’s selling I bought it
Could you do some sort of spider punk guitar weapon?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!
Amazing that's all I can say😮😮
Try making whiplash electric whips that could cut things in half like in iron man 2. 🤔🤔
Now make 2 of them and continuously swing 😉
soo close to becoming a reality
soo close to becoming a reality
Only way to see if it work is concrete
He’s going to be a real life super hero
If he actually makes this happen …. He’s the next billionaire
Try against walls Nxt
The funny thing was the tire case he was dragging it like spider man with his lunch tray lol
Try to make a working wand from Harry Potter
Can you do arm wings next
May be add something that can cut the 1st web and make anothe r web shooter on the left hand and do it ...now it would be the final product
This is awesome!   Would it be possible to somehow change the climbing part from your fore arms to a type of glove though? For practical use of the entire suit together, using your shins and palms for climbing would theoretically make it easier to switch between shooting "webs" and climbing. I 100% could be wrong, just brainstorming here.  I think gloves would give you more control in climbing and make it easier to commit to climbing tall structures like buildings, where as using your forearms would feel super unnatural and require a lot of trust in your engineering (which clearly, holds up when put to the test).  Edit: A perfect example of this would actually be Spiderman No Way Home where Andrew Garfield used his fingertips to hold on to the ceiling, though obviously instead of using your finger tips, you'd use the whole of your hand for more surface area.
God when the final version drops I am buying a version immediately
This makes me so happy
Could you try your hand at a version of daredevil’s Billy club that functions as an Eskrima fighting baton but that can also launch a 30 foot cable to swing from? His also transforms into Nunchuku btw.
Can you make ODM gear with the same mechanism?
Day 100 of asking him to make a green goblin bomd
He should have two websites. One for the toys and stuff, thats like 200 dollars or under, and sell the crazy cool expensive stuff by order, like his iron man suit
Hey, Use wet gummy bears to stick!
How about a car with no wheels
Bro is the closest person on the planet to being the real spiderman
how mucn😅?
AYO ,EMME GET ONE BRO
This guy is becoming too powerful 😮
A real flying green goblin glider Please!!!!!😶‍🌫
What I think You should do next is that you should make a blue beetle Suit
make mr. fantastic stretchy  arms
Why you don't make that free goblin that you snapped
2:23 nahhhh bro turned into nile red
Make a water bending glove from avatar or a water breathing sword from demon slayer also love your videos.

Please make storm breaker
Hello I'm santiago I have 11 years I follow your channel and seen several of your videos I would like you to try to make a project to make the flying skateboard to return to the future part 2 I hope and you achieve it greetings thanks
This is actually insane 🔥 would be one beefed up Spidey though 😂
this reminds me a lot more of odm gear and it makes me excited thinking about a project like that
Levi has joined the chat...
en español porfa
I think that it would be really cool if you made an obstacle course or just tried to make it from one place to another without touching the ground by using the wall climbers and web shooter
Bro you make a good andrew garfield spiderman!
Hey people from future just letting you know that If you ever see a Spiderman its probably this guy
You make Something stuff or something related to the New BlueBettle movie like maybe his armor or his weapons
It will be handy if the floors on lava
Day 1 of asking jake to make the ODM gear from attack on Titan
8:30 that was she said
I feel the next step will an exoskeleton type rig that allows the "webs" to anchor onto the wrists, rather than the crotch.  Got enough white, sticky loads coming from there.
This is more akin to Batman's grappling gun
Why don’t you make the scorpions tail that can stab and shoot venom (water etc)??
What if spiderman just got his sticky hands due to working with glues trying to make a web
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
You should change your name to peter
Attack on titan grapples
This is actually amazing, people like to give up on their dreams and not try, but look at you! You actually found a way to be SPIDERMAN!!! Go save lives buddy!
please man man attack on titans maneuver by using this concept. I feel like it will be most successful. you can create a whole space of wooden area and use the maneuver to swing
Marvel hire this dude for the next spiderman multiverse NOW
Just wait a military company is going like this
Idk if you stopped doing the building your ideas series but you should make gloves that can give you the ability to move objects with those gloves with like a magnet or something. Almost like telekinesis.
do the boat seen from homecoming
Helmet with AR integrated in the heads up display
You should make moon knights mummy wrap suit with the retractable wrappings🌙
Impresionante!! El mejor spiderman de la vida real !!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
make a frisbi thats tree resestant
The thing I like about JLaser is he puts his mind to something and he never let's go of it
MAKE MICRO BOTS FROM BIG HERO 6
Bet this would work really well to make the ODM gear from attack on titan if you figured out how to unhook from the surface
Hey, Jake you should make Kylo Ren’s the Skywalker saga helmet with voice changer
Man is pretty much just making the AoT 3DMG
I good idea I think would be like a black panther mask that senses people from behind and from the side
Not the Nile red reference
You really need to make a working suit of power armour from the fallout games
Just get a Spider that had been exposed to RadioActive to Bit you... Settle😂
I want you to make a iron man suit with the jets on your feet and arm even though it might be impossible

Hey I saw this looks just like yours https://youtube.com/shorts/Iv2mfKzPFl0?feature=share
I feel like I'm watching a real life spiderman origin story.  I hope nothing bad happens to his uncle.
You and "I did a thing" should make a collab
wow this is so cool but  your wall climbers could use an improvement. put the wall climbers under your suit on your fingers & toes
Try to make a crucible (doom eternal)
You should make a second web shooter for your other hand, and see if you can transfer from one web holding your entire weight to another. Btw, Stan Lee would be over the moon to see this!
Do raya and the last dragon sword
Pls make ben 10😊
ooey gooey
He is the Peter Parker of our universe... ❤
Hi, could you recreate the ring of the flash, with the suit inside and all, it would be very epic
I know you’re probably busy but it would be nice to see the pen sword from the Percy Jackson movies be recreated in real life! Imagine someone punches you down and you pull out a pen, they laugh at you, only to piss themselves when you click it and it transforms into a sword in your very hands
How do you get it
Can you like sell it
You should make some Batman gadgets
Y’all should create a time stone that actually controls time 👍
The U.S. Military wants to know your location
Can you make something hulk
You should make the master cycle from the legend of zelda breath of the wild!
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh im in uae
This makes me so happy man! You're putting so much effort into making something every child in existence has always wanted. It makes me happy and I had legitimately been thinking about making something like this too! I just couldn't find the right time to do so, I guess you actually beat me to it, I can't do chemistry as well as I would want to anyway.   I'm glad to see the success!!!
Do you ship the web shooters ship to the uk
This is cool, but it's more closer to batman than Spiderman 😅
Hey dude, what a great thing you built there, man this is just a suggestion for you but I think it’s a great idea to build something for spider-sense, like more into spider-man
Good job man you've come a long way. 🤟🤟🤟🤟
did I just hear Nile Red's voice in there?
I know what to do next for spider man a built in radar since spider man has spidey senses
make the big hero 6 robot 🤖 🤖 🤔
Build a thing that can make you use the force.
Te reto que hagas el Mark 1 de iron man
u should make a playlist for this spiderman project
Damn He is living my childhood dreams of what i wanted to do 😢
Amazing video! you're forgetting the part where spiderman has the proportionate weight of a spider
Make a doctor strange drone

Tune in next week for “Everyone. I’m Spider-Man”
You should make Batman’s grappling hook
Next up you need to bioengineer spidey senses
maybe you can mount two of these to actually swing like spiderman and like travel by sticking 1 and unsticking the other one
He needs to collab with airrack cause they look so alike
The next step would be to have 2 of those and swing from one rope to another.
khalil web swing
You should try and make the mini web shooters have an automatic retract and reload then you could redesign it (mainly cosmetic) to resemble the gauntlet from assassins creed syndicate
Does anybody told you, you looked and sounds like Airrack
Sorry bro cheaper in Amazon
You should definitely sell spring rings, they would probably sell so well
Make clarices electric spear
Spy kids
I was kinda thinking about this idea the whole week crazyyy I know😮 But can you please build those supper glaves from the movie spy midas I know that it's out of the marvel studio theme but how I'd love to see those come to life.... Seeing those gloves on the movie is what actually made me like inventing 😅
This is literally my childhood dream to stick to walls and swing like spiderman
love the nilered joke at 2:29
Cant find the Lenka
Now just make one for each hand. Swing, Like monkey bars.
Can you make a glider like the banshee from X man but instead of sound you can use jets. I think it will be a good idea for a video. Good luck on your next project.
It dosent stik on metal😢
Mandalorian wrist gauntlets
he is slowly becoming the irl spiderman, we just gotta kill his uncle👍
are you still working on the spring ring?
So an Iron-Spider suit is for sure possible 🕷️🕸️
WHAT about a flying suit without the iron man type
U should make the rasengan from Naruto I’m not sure how possible it would be but out of everyone I know u would be the guy to do it
Your getting really close
Can you do a suit that makes you go faster under water????😊😊😊
You and hacksmith have to collaborate it would be so epic
OMG!!!!! Super cool bro just the thought of seeing how hard you've come from making a prototype that shoots a web that works incredible like so amazing. But seeing the liquid turns into a web there has to be some type of research that could make it possible, besides that great work 🕷️ man
Next project how to get unlimited pressure so all projects can become more real. Use solar cell fabric  for any suite to generate electricity, charge the inbuild small batteries fitted across the suite. Turn that electric power to create a unlimited pressure for gadgets.
He should make a real life hulk buster mech
Please make a ant-man robot
You're gonna need something to break the sound barrier to get force to fire the web.
WHEN IS THE SPRING RING COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This man has the ability to actually become spiderman since he can shoot webs, swing, and climb walls. Huge round of applause for this man.
4:35  *Looks at my credit card*  I'm sorry little one

I have an idea so you don't have to tear holes in your in your suit why don't you guys make a belt that is adjustable and can hold the mechanism and then of course just painted to look like suit
do this on a building
what if you were trying to catch a person
The madalorian armun
Jlaser build idea: retractable grabpack from poppy playtime
It's good and you did a great job but what if it hits a person on accident or what if it all gets damaged by something or someone
Nah thats to complicated I will continue with getting bitten by every spider possible way less complicated         This is just a joke there is nothing to worry about
In what world can he not make stuff like that is amazing.😮
I got one of you’re shooters and I am having some trouble with it going it’s full length
Do that on both hands and add the wall climbers and climb a big building
Perfect for bank robbers for sure ,)
Nova helmet with heads up display
To make it work and be strong you will need spider silk. There are special goats who are modified genetically to give spider milk too. Hope that helps you.
Bussin
Bruh if you had 2 of those and could go from web to web without touching the ground 😲
Make a time machine
well, you are spider-man, Hacksmith is Iron man. it ALL FITS TOGETHER!
Best video I've ever watched ...
Does the small one lift a small person
2:14 NileRed?????

A shield that can turn into a hard sword
Awesome video brother!
You should also design a suit with all of them and make the rope come again to the mechanism after you swing
hellow Jalaser you next make speace out real rocket please build🙏🌌🌍🌎🌏🌕💫🚀🛸
Imagine making a thing that took like alot of months or years and you just made a one video.
The fact we could potentially be Spider-Man in the future is amazing
make a robot like megan from m3gan
Meke Ben 10 watch
bro wanted to be a superhero nice and creative
Imagine a special ops using this tech…
Ha hahahhahah aaaaaa..  your thumbnail
Make the disc from tron 1 It has to bounce 2 and have a hole in the middle It might be a modified design of your frisbee that you made. the one that bounces back
this looks like alot of work wouldnt finding a spider to bite you be easier
Literally chameleon’s gadgets from spectacular Spider-Man
Do a Harry Potter wand
Bro is probably so tired of putting that suit on 😂
Nvm
I swear, one day, Earth will be under attack by whatever, and we'll look to the skies and see this very man dressed like Spider-Man, swinging from building to building, looking like it was a movie.
Now to wait for someone to make a more portable version of it and watch everyone starting competing for who can make the best glove
Man I hope to see you swingiing around someday in that suit of yours
The glue option seems the most realistic and you can just cut it to release. Why didn't it work out?
Make a collaboration with Hero DW
Maybe your next project should be underground or it can take you underground. Just a suggestion
bro this is actually insane, seriously.
Barnacle glue. DOPA based. It also breaks down over time when drying(like spidey) Stronger than normal glues and works underwater or above on nearly anything. Mixing required to activate(which means you can just keep the liquids around like spidy in a cartridge). You may be able to mix that nylon and barnicle together to get sticky, liquid to solid web. Fired by a 22/9mm blank or something. Bang. Just have some kind of blade at the end of the launcher that you can flick like tape wheels have(bottom to avoid cutting while swinging). Instant release.  Spidey man. Spidey man. Does whatever a barnacle can?  Thats what I found in 5 mins of looking stuff up.
he should collab with hacksmith... they might both be able to come up with a more solid and perfected idea...
Um.... you could use bullet blanks and combine them with like a wrist mag that reloads. It would be able to actively FIRE with a LOT of force and reload. So that solves that. If you can find out how to melt and then fire stick glue, it would cool down in air and reharden on impact. Or pure rat trap glue.That would solve that. Pretty amazing build tho. And much like spidey. You are a menace if you use that in public. You are more like bat man tho. Which is still amazing. Add a stronger propulsion, attach a cape and a stronger real and bam. Dark knight.
Is it impossible to figure out how spiders create silk, like what molecules and proteins are used for spider silk?
You should make a Batman Arkham knight suit
That's really cool
Arack u you kind of look like James from unspeakable
What if he did a callab with hacksimth
dawg what’s next? a chronosapien time bomb or whatever it’s called
PLEASE PLEASE put those 2 chemicals in the original dual lighter web shooters, u might not be able to swing on them but if it worked it could still be sick.
He tried to be spider man and end up beeing batman. Amazing job
make the blue beetle suit
Make thor’s hammer that come back to you
Great now both hands and he spooder man
try make a retractable lightsaber!!
Bro should team up with Hacksmiths industries and use their spidey sense's while swinging and climbing..
Maybe make an array of baterangs like you did with the Hawkeye video. Normal, explosive, freezing, burning, electric, whatever else you can some up with
0:16 I know many people saw this coming 💀😨
spider-man real
واو
More like the ODM gear in ATtACK ON TITANS 👌🏾👍🏾 So cool
Do hulk busting arms
15:38 This is Ada Wong from Resident Evil 4 😅☂
12:42 Dude, you got the wrong superhero from the wrong franchise. That aint spiderman, that's Scorpion from Mortal Kombat by Sega. Get over here!! 😅 🦂
He is becoming a fulfiller of children's dreams and also of Marvel fans.
Make something from batman
How do I get to web shooters in Nigeria please tell me😢
Hi9
next step is too find a way to stick to glass
I know this will be pretty hard to build but I think that you should build the robot dog from AXL
If we compare this to Spider Man it seems like a fail, not really webs.  But, if you just compare it to an average man, he seems like a super hero still.  This is like military and rock climbing stuff all in one.
Been a while since I watched this channel kinda disappointed the step by step vibes are gone
Thats so cool , can you make the zorg ZF -1 of the fifth element
Now he needs to make Omni directional movement gear from attack on titan
Shock webs miles morals
i think that nail launcher is more of a ODM gear from Attack on Titan can you make an ODM gear version
A fist that comes back to you
This is literally 100% solved Batman's grapplin hook issue Well done)
You need one on each hand to traverse via "web slinging"
Also it should be retractable and super flexible and fast
You need to try and make Spiderman robotic spider arm next
This is giving me attack on titan vibes
spidy is that your winch or are you just happy to see me
Please make a yoyo you can use as a weapon
please make a dark saber.
I need it
Extremely impressive man, You are making a real life Spider- Man and   please do sandman next
Lol Sticks to anything...  Problem: Magnets only stick to thick  enough metal.  Solution: Use nails so you can only stick to thick enough wood!
Can you make a yoyo you can use as a weapon
Jay you should make the apex legends healing drone
i'll be spider man , just fallow my lead
Can you make a real life rasangon from Naruto  and you’ll get 1 billion  likes
Can you please make the ten rings
If you make two of them, you could shoot, then release, and then shoot again. That way you can get a cool Tarzan-like effect. Love your vids bro, keep going.
I didnt think this would be possible. I have seen too many kind of fake versions of web shooters that basically are just grappling hooks
Spider man is the best
Nice. Now do that without walls
You've been working on this for so long and putting a lot of effort into it, that k you so much you are an inspiration and have made tons of people interested in engineering
I have a bad idea, make ODM gear from Attack on Titan. Plz 🥲
Can you please do hulk 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
please sell the web shooter that you can swing from trees please i really want to buy it
Hey man, I have a project I want you to try. Can you try to make the hoverboard from the movie "Back to the Future"
@JLaservideo would there be any way to mod the product version so it shoots a net? I know it would be small but it would be super cool if it were a possibility
ODM gear ?
Stealth operative tactical applications...or something. This man's might get a government contract!
Please can you make a thing like jarvis or friday from iron man. Btw love your videos
Day 10 of asking for Wolverine
I ordered one on the 19th and the order says it's still pending. Is there a way to cancel cause I can't even get an email back when I sent one...
This guy can turn into both spiderman *and* nile red!
bro his awsome he can make anithing
All his darts must still be there
Ones we get into 2039 we will be flying in Ironman suits
Can you build the batman V8.03 suit in batman Arkham knight please
This is a good weapon not gonna lie, i mean u can shoot it at someone and their basicly dead
Bro is getting to close ❤
for your next project i was hoping you could make something like the ODM gear from Attack on Titan. it is really cool and quite similar to the spider man web shooters.
Can u make a dinosaur Robot  that will act like a dog aka it follows u around
I wonder if he could make real Shocker gauntlets
You should make something that makes u use telekinesis
This guy is an iron man but with a different super hero in mind
nice addition of @nilered
add another one and u will be even more like the amazing spidey
Now you need to build another for the other hand
Why find me some I'm so maps
Combine climbing and web swing
Congratulations....you're Batman.
Hi Jake! Can u make some extendable arm attachments with fingers that you can move on the end using hydraulics or smth?
What about  the other hand
In the end this is more similar to the 3D maneuver gear from Attack on Titan
If you had a second one of these for the other arm and somehow condensed and improved the speed of the detachment, you could achieve a double swing which would be sick. Biggest problem would be another arm means more equipment, motors, and weight
What if he missed and hit someone with that though O_O
bro is making my dream come true
This man cannot be told otherwise. You can say he can't do thr most unfathomable thing. And he'll still do it.
I like how your sponsor minutes is only 30 seconds long and others are five minutes
The neighbors when the nails are going through the fence   👁️👄👁️
it says no trash lol
💡 idea to not make holes in everything, answer: spider silk
lightsaber plz
lightsaber
lightsaber
lightsaber
lightsaber
Makes it look like web is coming from crotch which is just like a real spider! Great touch! 😀
I know the goal is to be spiderman, but have you ever considered being a grapple pilot from Titanfall 2? 🤔
This dude is straight up like a couple years away from becoming a real spiderman
Where to get the web shooter
hey jlaser can you make life size robot that can do chores?
I tried to look for the web shooter, but i can’t find link to it😮”
This was basically a grappling gun 😂
Can u make a water jetpack
For your next vid you should make a small robot that copy’s your movement
Assasins creed spider mans!!
This is dope, very well done. I had an idea regarding the climbers; I was thinking you could make them smaller like gloves while still retaining their strength and you could make some sort of flexible yet strong grip pads for the feet.
you know this sounds crazy but maybe something like a ben 10 watch like when you slam it you wont really be turnning into a alien but like a suit will cover you and you might get a little bit of powers like for four arms you might do something to make so your really stronge
*arive at heaven* God- how did you do  Me-I got me brother a Spider-Man web shooter God- *confused* Me- it stabbed me  God-*thinks I’m going insane* Me- it shoots nails
You can act like the nail-gun launcher is Spider-Man all you want, but all I can hear is, "Get over here!!!"
Bro where can i get that?
Governments calling….
The Spiderman we need is so close.
ngl, Nile red caught me off guard Lmao
Don't get me wrong, this is kinda ligit only thing it's missing is comic accuracy.
You should make ULTRAKILL's Knuckleblaster arm
Más bien los cables de ATACK ON TITAN son increibles
Make another one for yourleft hand so you can swing fluently
This guy is better than Hacksmith
This web shooter could have real-world applications. Like for police or military. Extremely Cool.
Are you ever gonna build a Mario Odyssey Cappy that comes back to you when you throw it at the air?
He’s is the super heroes combined
This man is gonna be a legend
I ordered this like 2 week ago when will it arrive we’ve got no shipping confirmation?
Rather than spiderman web it's more like gadget in mission impossible
Imagine if you shoot it at a tree then climb up during a hide and seek game
You should make a floating grogu basket with grogu
2:17 is where he starts to slowly transform into NileRed for a moment
Hey bro you had it down packed until you changed your formula holla at me 🤓
This is more of a weapon than a webshooter 😂
This comment will most likely get buried, but I think you should finish off the falcon suite, I'd love to see it be used for something cool
what to make next hmmmm make a  real life jet pack like jetpac aviation i am sure you can do that 😃😃
That is sooooo cool 😮😮😮😮
Make odm gear from attack in Titian
can you make batmans gliding cape
Can the black web shooter also in Amazon
You can take string and putt glue to end
This is the best Spider-Man gadget I've ever seen=)
I want to say good try...
i don't know about spiderman but i can tell that you can make all the batman  gadgets
why not use gum for web shooters
Why dont you make 2 and pretend youre holding a train
Dual wielding
He should swing himself through new york with the shooters
give this to police or security that would be dope
Your friendly neighborhood property destroying, lethal protecter Jlaser!
Spiderman spider Man Spiderman
Less of spiderman,more like batman
Imagine government agencies getting their hands on something like this and start raiding buildings with them
Do you have a hand cannons that can stick in the people and pull them towards you Now that is scary
The fuggn nilered clip lmaoo Love that yall have a friend group where you can meme on each other and appreciate each other's content
my man became spider man brotha you are insane
You did not even credit Nile red for the nylon clip
Bro how much is 4:25 i rlly want it
Next you need to find a way to swing, release, web another one on the other side, release, and repeat at least once more.
You should make those micro bots from big hero 6
You should make a flash costume that is able to shoot out of a ring or bracelet. You could also make like the iron spider suit you made where it appeared on your body...but make it look like it's coming out of the ring or bracelet......I have made flash rings before that actually held a mini version of my custom flash themed character. First one broke and second got water damaged.
Those poor fish
2:26 sounds exactly like Neilred
You should make the Leviathan Axe from God of War that has an actual recall function.
spider-man's web shooters are so cool
Webs are sticky You know what else is sticky?  *Read more*
You should make your own super hero suit, super hero name, powers and cool gadgets and become your own superhero with any cool powers you want, so you can be a real superhero
Can you make Jason’s coin sword from heroes of Olympus
Bro made a gun that has a web on it 😭😭😭 THAT THING FINNA KILL SOMEONE DOG
I’d like to see a ribbon dancer(the kind which suspends themselves) or an acrobat or a gymnast use the web slinger.
make a thore  hamer
Using rope and hook/nail turns it into a grapple gun like batman or bloodsport
bro if that hit a humon
I dare you to combine every most Spider-Man thing you ever made together for one video it would be so cool good luck with that one😅😅😂
Love how he keeps asking does it look cool?? Of course it looks cool dude!! You're frickin Spidey!!
10:24 it oddly looks like a pipe bomb but with small enough power so it won't just explode but instead launch the nail
Awesome
Shoot one swing shoot the second swing then land on wall or something
How to make 4:09 relodable web shooter??
When’s it restock
You should make a robotic car that folds to a plane
Hi this is a good video
You should def make your own version of a para motor... That would be sick af
😂😂😂 nile red  voice
When is this shipping I’m dying here
the hammer one is funny imagine spider-man shooting bad guys with nails 😭😂
While this is less of a spiderman gadget and more of a batman gadget, it doesn't make this any less impressive. I think if you add a way to reload and fire multiple "webs" quickly, I think this can be even more impressive. Keep up the amazing work!
Bro, I can see u making ODM gear from attack on titan based on this. That's so sick. Kudos!
This may go unnoticed but the overall design of the gear kinda looks too identical to the ODM gear from Attack On Titan. Maybe you could successfully create one of those as well
A drone with a scanner that can scan everything
You should make Spider-Mans web wings
Make a High Frequency Blade from MGRR
swing but not a spider so, we can call it swing shooter👍
amazinggg work
Link to that super glue. Thank you.
I wonder if you could make the ODM gear from attack on titan, just sayin.
14:47 Paging Matt Ferrell... Matt Ferrell to JLaserVideo please.
alright now make doom slayers sword
No way! You're a super genius!!!
broooo that's great, will you translate it into Spanish?
Imagine if he punched a guy with his right hand💀 instant death
2:23 colab
that was not the second try you can clearly see all the holes
He's slowly turning into spiderman. He's the closest person to the real Peter Parker is the whole world. Spider sense is all he needs besides improvement and miniaturization.
Stan lee would be proud
HAHAHAHA...That was awesome.
aot type stuff
One day this guy is gonna make a bed transformer
You so close !
2:25 Hey, that sounds like NileRed! He also made a video on how the plastic-web thing works here a year ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKFxIgBKRkk  Just wanted to give him some credit!
idc how shitty it is, anyone trying to be spiderman is a winner. keep going bro
And make your own costume😄
Man, you should definitely make your own weapons maybe you could be a superhero
Man's really tring to be peter parker, very nice work!
wow
SPRING RINGGGG
Bro, I love it. You should make fully functioning Boba Fett armor. Similar to how Hacksmith did the Mando armor. Though yours should have a working jetpack.
How much dollars are they
Wing gundam zero beam saber and beam rifle
I have an amazing idea! You should make two shooters, one for each arm so you can do 2 swings in a row by having it so you can detach the nail from the shooter. Then, since you can detach nails from the shooter you could make it so the shooter reloads nails automatically, basically giving you infinite swings in a row!
That wasn’t “glue”
I'm actually a college student that studies fiction to see if its possible to work in reality and I could calculate how to make proper webbing thats thick enough to hold you up
I love how he put Nile reds voice in 2:20, 😂 the legend
Can u stick to the sun?
Add another and do a second swing
you make such cool things,I wish i could meet you
منم دارم مثل تو امتحان میکنم ولی تا الان جواب نداره🥲🕷️
Can you make ADM gear fro AOT
Insane
now DOUBLEEE ITTT!!
Here is a idea use spider web shooter and the climb suit
Just build an ODM gear!
Bro I just had an crazy idea use gecko material on your suites to climb like spiderman
If only he could collab with the hacksmith
Bor i wanna see two hand
NEXT VIDEO: "I'm going to create the radioactive spider that bit Peter Parker to gain superhuman strength, speed, agility and most importantly the"Spider-Sense""  End of Video: MISSION COMPLETE 🕷🕸
loooool
Let's face it. The nail shooter was just a high pressure gun. You could kill someone.
This could actually be useful in the military
2:22 I heard nile red for a second there 😂
Cool
I wouldn't tell anyone about these I'd start hitting the gym learn multiple fighting styles stat working on upper body strength for climbing and then just got out in public obviously dressed like Spidey and blow mindes
Just bought two
The real life Inspector Gadget!!
i heard nile red
This is crazy cool stuff, man. Would be interesting to see a quick release mechanism integrated into this design to make the end of the swing a little smoother 🤔. Fantastic work!
Now you need one on the other hand so you can continuously swing.
Spiderman
Someday he will be spiderman
Id like to see the grab pack from Poppy Playtime
U should build the grandmasters melting staff
make a speed cube like when you must up the cube and solve it self and when it is solved it exploded
I feel like you should be famous for making stuff like this
Bros Wang from the Goonies
You should put some kind of laser pointer to see where you are shooting for better aim :) just saying
Dudes the beginning of either a hero or a villain arc and I don't want to know which one
Nice bungee cord 👌
how can did you learn to make things like this?
can you upload this video to spanish ples
The only thing stopping this dude from becoming Spiderman is super strength lol
What about making a sonic screwdriver from Doctor Who (maybe using some remote control outlets to control lights )
That NileRed audio clip gave me a bit of a chuckle
Can you please make boots that sticks to walls
Make a suit that can create clouds and be able to float around
I have an amazing idea! You should make two shooters, one for each arm so you can do 2 swings in a row by having it so you can detach the nail from the shooter. Then, since you can detach nails from the shooter you could make it so the shooter reloads nails automatically, basically giving you infinite swings in a row!
Please ship the shooter to norway!!!
Make a poke ball that enlarges and minimizes its self like the show shows it doing please  I feel like it would be a good cool and challenging project 😁
Hey I have a suggestion what if you tried to make something like the micro bots in big hero 6
Bro! You should make mechanical rhino suit from the amazing Spider-Man 2. It would keep with the Spider-Man theme
This man is making childhood dreams come true
idk about spiderman but this is pretty clearly the omni-directional mobility gear from Attack on Titan. You should make THAT video since you are like 80% there already. You collab with some acrobats and they could totally do some ecrazy high flying stuff with these lol.
Please give me the wed shooting Please 😂❤
Please make Wolverine claws and make it retractable

"Web sack"👀  < that's what she wanted😏 9:46

Forget about spiderman this man build and actual AOT ODM gear
maybe add to this another 2 shooters thats shoots weeb and you can handle things
JLazer you de BEST!
Do like aquman going under water
It's like watching tony stark make his suit effective every version please continue this spider man content till it's perfect and aesthetic
You should make Thor’s hammer that would be cool
Captain America’s new shield
HEY WHY DONT U INVENT A VERSION FOR ADULT WOMAN THAT SHOOTS MASE?!  lol
your the spider man
Why did he become nilered for a sec?
Super cool that something like this really works. I was doubting that there would be enough strength to be able to hang from it. I’ve been searching for someone who built the grappling hook from legend of Zelda. I really want to see someone take on the challenge. With this guys skill it would be super cool to see his approach on the build.
I love how close you're getting, unfortunately the whole nail idea doesn't stick with the non-vilolence of the best Spider-men. I look forward to seeing you put more effort into the instant stick chemistry webs.
Love this channel your final video will be a fully functional iornman suit.
I've had a theory before on how the Spiderman web shooter actually works in the past. In the cartoon, its always a single really thick cartridge, but I always thought that it can't be a single chemical, and it can't activate unless it comes in contact with the air as well, or it would clog the very shooter.  My guess is that the cartridge is separated into sections of liquids and fires them with extreme pressure through a very tight nozzle that mixes the liquids. Since Spidey says that his spider silk is biodegradable, I would think it is organic, which would lead me to believe it is made out of proteins and aminoacids, mainly Fibroin, Alanine, Glycine and Serine, just like the silk from both Spiders and Silkworms, possibly also starch and other thickening agents.  Under pressure, the liquids would be able to shoot for a HUGE distance, but as they are mixed they would already start to become a strand and when they come out from the nozzle and come in contact with the air, they would expand, thicken and become a rope like material, making for a even small amount of liquid mix would already have a considerable volume of rope that is both adhesive and can resist quite a bit of weight.
ODM gear attack on titan
Nice
I’ve got a Spider-Man web shooter like two weeks ago and they haven’t sent it or replied to any emails when is it coming?
Make make something anime pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Nile red cameo
Collab with hacksmith bro 😍
Can't wait for the oppressor Mk2
Bro loved this video keep up the amazing work
This also gives me ODM gear vibes from Attack on Titan, or the classic Burton Batman grappling hook. However you look at it, it’s insanely impressive
I bought your web shooter and I must say it is one of my favorite products I have ever purchased 11/10, btw love your videos.
Got my shooter. Good workmanship and shipped fast. Was a bit weak before I recharged but fun...until my cat, Groot, found out about it. Will need to order replacement soon.
Go to the town and swing around
Try a GRAVITY gun. with some sort of gravity factor
thats insane dude, my bday is coming up and i asked but my mom said no since she thinks its a toy plus they r getting me something for $105
You should create your own superhero and be him
Make the Percy Jackson riptide sword pen
Now make 2. One for each arm so you can swing twice before hitting the ground
Why did you test the web shooter on a person first instead of the dummy test dummy it’s way more safer to test it on the dummy it’s so unsafe to test it on him first Web shooter almost knocked the person over
Try capturing someone with the finished one just like spider man what could go wrong?
For the one shooter that shoots a net you could turn that into a shooter to capture things/people
I want Tom Hollander to watch this😂
you can be one or combine a motorcycle and a bicycle
Can you do the blue beetle mask, or do you just do marvel?
Venom web shooter
Dude invented just cause irl
make wolverine claws that can retract
Bro said I got all this gooe all over me.yooo kinda sus!
Absolute legend.
I know hacksmith, he's realy good
you should make one for the other hand to so you can swing further
U built a proper grappling gun
Thats amazing bro! Allaire look forward to seeing what you will come up with next.  Definitely gonna have to buy a web shooter if you still have some
Literally ordered it right from seeing this. It comes in soon. CANT WAIT
I'm not a smart guy but couldn't you just drill a hole into the dart and run the web line through it?
Try and swing on glass💀💀💀
imagine a VR headset that runs Windows 11 standalone but for games. If not that then do Big Hero 6 micro bots. and make them so they can stand on each other.
Bro is there anything you can’t accomplish??
I see Spiderman but I'm hearing "GET OVER HERE!!!"  Just me?
Try making Chuck E. Cheese animatronic
how our parents used to go to school
Build a working ridable space shuttle
Now try jumping then swinging it might be a lot harder but it will look very cool
Can you make a Jetpack???
I love your videos
I want web
If u can do spider man, can you please do the odm from attack on titan?
He’s literally the power ranger version of Spider-Man
Your next project, the mandolorian wrist grappling hook
DUUUUUUDE, I CAN ACTUALY BUY THIS THING!!!!!!! (someone made shame thing, just that it costs around 300$ and is not half that cool)
Hey loved it just a small request could you please have the glue Spider-Man all other hand and use the climbers and climb and jump with the net and use your other hand to take an object into your hand with the first spider that it that spider shooter that you should of and sewing again to the next place taken that person to a wall
I feel like this would make a better batman gadget tho, but this man be his own superhero.
This is Fantastic!!! But where is falcon wings v2??
Make ben 10 omnitrix
It’s the iron spider
make a fireproof glove that transforms into a blaster for the new transformer movie
i was about to say he sounds like nilered
You should make the microbots from big hero 6
Make a full black panther suit
next hacksmith vs jlaservideo
You could also do what you were doing before but instead of rat glue, you could use magnets that stick together, but press a button and it could negate the magnetic charge
Did anyone catch Nilered’s voice while he was talking about the two chemicals?
It will also give me an idea of how to make it
Hi Can you pleas make the powers of smoke fruit from blox fruit i am a creater like you exept im only a nine year old
Now you just need to practice with two!!
Your true design could be perfect for scorpion.
Kratos chaos blades
You should make The bird that comes from Falcons back
You've done Spider-Man, now what else to do beside making The goblins Glider
You should make one meant to swing and one to catch bad guys. have the net on the inverse side of your arm.
can u make a wall riding car or scooter or skateboard? that would be really cool!!
Now put the wall climbers and this together?
Is the web shooter order a scam? I placed my order about a week and a half ago now and I haven’t even gotten a confirmation that it shipped. I’ve contacted Jlaser personally multiple times and he finally responded and said that shop placed my order is fraudulent. That’s never happened before on any other order that I’ve made with Shop and I gave him 80 of my dollars. he said that my only option was to cancel and replace my order, but he hasn’t given me directions on how to cancel my order because it’s not available to do through the website or through Shop.
no as visto como tiene batman con sus pistola de soga es casi similar que espider man... no existe todavia la tela araña solo devemos enfocar de que esta hecho la tela de la araña eso es todo... brutos
Do this with ODM gear from Attack on Titan
oh my god
Did i was the only one who heard Nile red in there?
It seems way more complicated than the movie
Actually can you make working poki balls
I bought one of your web shooters, and I came back to say that this thing is so sick! It feels really good to use, there's a nice amount of inertia behind the projectile, and it does a solid job of sticking to things. I fire it over and over just at nothing, striking poses and seeing how organic I can get it to look. I'm way more entertained playing with this than I would've expected. On the off chance you see this, care to share where I could get additional magnets for it?
Can you make power ranger morphers
make black panthers suit coming out from a neckless.
Hey Mr. Laser :) I just got my shooter today, and I was wondering it would be “fine” or “realistic” to add a stronger spring and longer rope? My mind is racing with possibilities for mods :) thanks.
An you make robot that copys you
nile red voice 😂😂😂😂
Now you just need another one to continue the swing
Spider-Man: no way out of jail
HES THE TRUE SPIDER MAN
You should try and make the carnage glide thing look it up you will see what it looks like
Ur next challenge is to make a web shooter that can support your weight, but not damage the object that it attaches to
Were you ever able to get that superglued wood at 2:07 off?
Best vid i've seen in a while
Could you make Attack on Titans 3D stunt team?
awesome video and work!, can you make spider sense?
Pls do deku smash glove
Bro u should now try do 1 for the other hand that would be so fire
he be swinging
PLS make a machine nail gun!! Fire rate of 3nps+ PLZ
11:25 , "I mounted everyting to my wist 👉👈😆
I got my webshooter in 20 minutes ago! I’ve been playing with it non stop! Great quality. Love it
The adhesive you want is gecko tape! It’s insanely strong with something as thin as tape as long as it has enough surface area, and leaves no residue because it’s not actually glue.
You should sell your mom
I'm definitely buying one of those Web shooters when I can afford it 😂
Is everyone just ignoring the fact that he's punching holes in the frickin ceiling? LOL
Why Spider-Man instead the FU$&@ng BATMAN? 🦇
This could easily become a more realistic version of Spider-Man. (at least for this day and age)  Basically more like an Iron Man suit that can climb and shoot those ropes. And who knows, maybe even use those Jets from the other Iron Man suit
if he and the hacksmith combined they could make literally anything
is there anything this guy cant do he's practically a super hero, I'm definitely buying one or two
next time, you should do The Big Robocop Robot
Soooooooooooo would love to see you swing double with two Web shooters🥺,and you being airborne the whole time
Try to make a time travel machine next time 💀
what if instead of making another device from fiction, just let ur creativity out and build something that uses all the things u have learned along the way, kinda like a dream prohect, put ur own name and brand on it, go wild
🤙
Make a real hoverboard
Is this a power of a God......
WOWOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you should try to do batman's grapple gun next
make mecha bat suit
Wait I never seen someone that makes something cool and sells
Please make a harry potter wand that can make holograms as a form of a Patronus. p.s. - I really like your projects, it encouraged me a lot
You should combine every spider man thing you made in the past so then you will really be Spider-Man?
He did the impossible 'o'
You should climb up a wall and swing to another wall and grab the wall and climb back down
You need to research on a new element or substance that can replicate spider webs and hold human weight or else you're gonna just keep making fancy toys that actually are not even close to the real thing. It would be a cool science project but that's about it , its not going to revolutionize human movement. Good try tho, it's more a tactical military weapon rather than spider man
clean
Imagine if the police have this
@JLaservideo can u create the arm from sleight(please like it and see if he can see this comment)
In the process of trying to become Spiderman he created AoT 3d gear
Where can I get a spider helmet like that??????
now you just need one on each hand and make a whole swing course
How you about to casually pull a car with a webshooter
Have you considered making Moon Knight armor from the show?, like as it it self wraps around, puts the hood up and creates the cape?, idk if thats possible but i’d be dope
LETS GO NEW VID
A catch mid air would have made the whole thing
Is this safe
Just subscribed. You should make a working metal spider man suit. I will buy one
Can you make a very pour full Ironman gonglet with a big strong Lazer on it. Love your videos
Can you please make more videos
Hi love your content but I do have an idea for a next updated version but I don’t know if it will work but if you want to hear it just reply to this.  Edited: For the sticking method it may not work but that’s because it is with a rope.
this man should be working for the fucking spec ops engineering team
you need to collab with @hacksmith and become unstoppable
Can you please make a real life Batman grappling hook?
I’ve been watching your channel for an long time ever since that fist time you started working on a human flying drone.Now look were you have come. Good job. You should make a naruto rasengan or chidori with an actual ball of energy
you should upgrade your spiderman climbers with artificial geckoskin created with diffraction gratings and silicone
NILE RED
Bro… if we start seeing a man swinging through buildings in a red suit, that’s him. He will eventually become Spider-Man, dude. I’m 100% sure
You should make a thing that flies by fire
Can you try to build the rift from Gravity Falls?
Reminds me of attack on titan 😂
You should recreate The Scarlet Witch's powers irl!!!!!!! Great video btw! 👍
PLEASE MAKE A MAGICALLY RETURNING NINJA STAR WITH A MAGNET
you should make hoverboard which can fly
Cool
I know you wont see this but pls can you make idk hear from aot considering the new season recently came out pls
I'll be real, the latest version of the webshooters, while possibly more useful in more situations, is VERY lethal and causes extreme damage to whatever you use it on/with. This is very far, but I feel like there is still room for improvement in the design of how to make/use a webshooter.
Hacksmith got competition. In which is good
Apparently Spider-Man borrowed batmans grappling hook
Stan Lee would be proud
the transition from JLaser to Nile Red was amazing
bro just make that air gear from aot
Can You make a paraglider from DyingLight 2? Should be retractiong on command. (optional-not break your bones when jumping off buildings?)
No way bro this is sick!
get another on the other hand so when your about to release you swing to another piece of wood, releaase and go to second and then release and if you somehow figure out how to reload then itll be infinite swing glitch
Peter Parker IRL over here

He sounded like Nile red whilst making the polymer thing
I know a guy who knows you from Hanover
My review on his webshooter: https://youtu.be/ukJNL9ExSJU
You should make a green goblin surf thing and mask with bomb 💣 please do it

I have an idea why don’t u make a microgravity generator so u can float stuff like telekinesis
Cardboard-man

My grandma’s toffees would have sticked better than your web-shooter XD.
dude it sticks to everything even lava
you are best bulder
Isit just me or jlaser is smarter than hacksmith. Jlaser is like tony stark and hacksmith is like hammer industries
I bet Stan Lee would be so proud of you. Dream it and do it
That's Batman's grapling hook
My Thoughts: Why do I feel like JLaser is another Spider-Man in this universe? And if he meets the other Spider-Men, will they call him Spider-JLaser from Earth 6276? Now, why do I feel like this would be a great character to add to the Spider-Verse? If I were a professional comic book artist, it would be a great idea to create a comic book version of JLaser as Spider-Man in this universe where he is a YouTuber.
APETURE. LONGFALL. BOOTS.
JLazer Hands down one of the Best Engineers on the Planet. Every other creator who makes Inventions like this deserves millions to experiment and expand these kinds of technologies are making Super Heroes a Reality right now and NGL Ultron is inbound ChapGPT/AI and Tesla/Disney/Boston Dynamics Robots 😅
I wanna see you swing with two web shooters
You guys just made me realized the ODM gear in Attack on titans is possible
Thank you for make this,and another else fantasic video 😁
you should work with a group called hacksmith  they will help make your project even better  they do the same stuff as you
Bro the web shooter toy already exists 💀 Is jlaser dropshipping now?
ok... so, that first formula that made the liquid ropes... you made the star wars grapple tech
Hey JLaser, you should make a dragon ball radar that has a grid map that shows where things are that you want to track
Literally the definition of the Spider-Man homemade suit
Kinetic energy glue, when you hit it, it heats and sticks. Try it
♾️THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING INCREDIBLE ♾️
this dude is basically batman with all these gadgets
I put the web shooter in the cart for now until I have enough money lol😂
Next make some APFSDS tank rounds.
All you need is a second one and your THE Spider-Man
Please please please make Deku Upgraded shoes from My Hero.
can you remake Riptide the sword from Percy Jackson but actually shaped like a sword
Not the cia stolling your ideas 💀💀💀
Nobel Dude 🧼  🌎📈📈📈📈
Now imagine if u had 2 of them and u can let go of one and use the other one and constantly keep doing it
hey this is so cool i love your videos also i want to be a young inventor. and i am just wondering if you can go back and make easy projects and also break down the cords and electronics if it.preferably cheap cause i am in high school and hacksmith is responding to you dang   i want to start a youtube channel and maybe make money got any tips
Bro is Spiderman
You should turn this into attack on Titan ODM gear 💯
Bro, I think you should make   nuclear bomb, but it explodes into confetti
when he left it reminded me of tobey maguire when he webed the plate
Plz make two web shiiters in two hand
Make a umbrella that rains
If you think that leaving holes in everything you shoot at is a bad thing, just switch from Spiderman to attack on titan's ODM gear
Next video he is going to be swinging from buildings 😂
i want to see a remastered version of the wall climbers using artificial gecko skin! (great vid btw)
LONG SHOT  but  it'd be interesting to see a hoverboard  like  whatever can be done to be as close as a hoverboard, back to the future or Arcane's Ekko kinda deal  (actually the flying drone could be that imma give that project another spin)
My idea is a captain marvel photon blast mabey something around your wrist that blasts some energy.
Makes you wonder if Spiderman was real he would've probably started out on YouTube
What about a mechanism that releases just the nail then reloads a new nail
broooo thats CRAZY. Spider-Man is my favourie superhero. I think you should make  a second one (if its possible lol) so you can actually swing like Spider-Man
Again the real life Peter Parker!🤙
i agree
You should make a batter rang that comes back
Remember when you made that expanding shield that popped out from your wrist, make an expanding sword and sell it.
I'm gonna get web Shooters
Next u just need to make a Spider-Man suit and hide the harness and what not in the suit, would probably be very hard but hey that’s never stopped you
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
You totally should make the Mandalorian wrist gauntlet with the grapple function.
You will become a real life spiderman
u should do the doom guy arm saw
its ben a long tim
Try to swing the stik to the other wall

Bros gonna be the first IRL super hero💀🫡🤙

6:45 put strong neodymium magnets at the end so it can stick to metal walls as well
W
I have an idea, you should make rubik's cube bomb or yoyo with strings that heat to red-hot from gru dru and minions.
Nilered cameo
put another on the other wrist in order to join swings together to go longer distances
incoming mrbeast video. “I Payed a REAL vigilante to become spider-man and stop crime for $500,000”
The best thing about this, is his friend's support for him through it.
Is it still available?
You should try to add the wall climbers on the bottom
What happened to the flyable falcon wings?
interesting alibaba web shooters you’re selling
This could work so well as Mobility gear from attack on titan
can you make scorpions kunai spear
Make a Nanotech Helmet as well a Helmet that just pops out of nowhere
13:10 Spider-Man 4 Starring J Laser Video
Build a fully functional chainsaw man suit
I liked the collab with Nile Red 😂 2:23
jlaser,you should build a second one so you can shoot swing and shoot again then release
Great job as always, had an idea for a next video, perhaps you could make Chainsaw Man, or something from the series, it would be cool to see a real working chainsaw man helmet and arms
Make a dr strange sling ring
This stuf even at its early states can help the police and special forces so much
Hey jlaser ive been watching your channel for a few years now and I would really love if you make a bullet proof bat man suit
Flying dr strange cape
You sir, are making dreams come true.
Now he will need a second webshooter to actually swing and release
2:39 Yo this part literally reminds me of the web making scene in The Amazing Spider-Man. This dude is a MAD GENIUS.
U can be a real spider man in real life
U have to collaborate with hacksmith and finish the whole spider man suit !!!!
mack  a phone bome
Imagine if he made a real life hulk buster except he made it fold out from a chest plate so he could make every individual piece to make it easier like his real life iron man suit Or just team up with the hack-smith
we need odm gear
Try and implement this as the ODM gear from Attack on Titan. I think it suits that more
Hi how big is the web shooter
Is it possible to fully pull yourself all the way to the top of the rope when hanging on to it?
very good
so, did you put a hole in dudes spare tire? how long until you have them on both arms?  get that shoot swing shoot swing going
MAKE A WEB SHOOTER THAT SHOOTS A WEB BALL
I WANT A WEB SHOOTER
Duuuuuuuude!!! This is BEST Spiderman gadget ever made! And you showed up the Mythbusters to boot!
this guy became spidy, a year before he was jesus in his "i built shoes that can walk on water" video
Make a railgun
Request : plz upgrade that flying iron man suit and add wepons on that plz a very humble requst to you
i the back memer declare you the god of technology!!
amazing but next time try to swing on buildings n' stuff
I always find myself smiling so flipping hard watching the beautiful mess that invention is lol. I sincerely appreciate you and your awesome support group that keeps you pushing boundaries. Stay beautiful, my friend ❤
You are a genius
Spider-Man's webshooter is a quick fire type and also has a spinneret nozzle that allows all that thread hold together really well, only thing that's still a mystery is how to create a fluid that could turn to string when it gets contact with air, and able to hold tons of weight and also durable enough when outstretched. Only thing I can think of is Polymer basically.
Can't you just irradiate a spider and get bitten by it? Bam, instant Spider-Man powers.
They mention in lore that the reason the web fluid is so perfect is because of peters spider powers, he understands how to make it better than anyone else. Reed Richards, the smartest man in the entire marvel universe, called peters web fluid a work of genius.
More Batman than Spider-man
That voice looks like nile red.hahahahaha
Bro you should make the blades of chaos from god of war
Bro rely turned into nilered
bro Marvel should hire this guy
This is awesome. One big thing people don’t account for is that Spider-Man can bench press 10 tons as full strength adult level Spider-Man. So swinging around his body weight on his arms and joints is like child’s play and that’s also why he can launch himself through the air on human-sized stretchy web super far off of those huge momentum filled swings
Bro. The best collab ever is gonna be you, Hacksmith, and Built IRL making a spider man suit to try out and that actually works. Trust me.
We are closer then ever to having real super hero’s
Calisthenics would probably help swinging
Wonder what would happen if we had a web like fluid that could pull an airplane
God is good
anyone else realize he kinds made the pistol odm gear from aot which kenny and his gang used?
Falcon wings part two please 😢😢
Lot's of fan service in this week's episode, Jake.
Not the nile red collab
He's got the beckbrojack intr music
Try to create the izuku mydoriya smoke screen quirk that comes out from his body
I have sent you two emails.
Nahh more like the ODM gear from Attack on titan
One improvement I can think of would be to focus on the harness system to better hold your weight while swinging, and maybe have it under the suit if you wanted to make it look more flush later down the line. Definitely keep it up!
add like magnets inside the rope for you can tie people with it
remember, there are still lots of elements undiscovered. so whos to say there isnt one thats similar to spideys webs?
Can you make a lot more of the web shooters please I really want one😢 I don’t know how to get it so can you make a lot more and keep on doing it
8days
make a bong that grinds ur bud, packs your bowl, and sparks it for a 420 special
Bro turned into nilered💀💀💀💀💀
Do Goku's Kamehameha wave next please. P.S if it helps, it is said to be made out of plasma.
Can we get the falcons glider next?
ace the halo armor
You should try shooting a string with the long ends with those strong magnets on the tips and when it hits something the ends wrap around it and the magnets will attach together
Can u make a re mastered verison of the iron man ex o skeleton  plsssss
I want to see if he would be able to create either crescent rose, or Ruyi-bang and jingu-bang. From RWBY I think making either of these transforming weapons would be dope.
New idea you should make some wings from vulture in spider man home coming
You should totally make the shield from black panther!!!!
I've been following your spiderman journey for a while and... man you really did it. I can NOT wait to see what the future brings for you, and I can not wait for actually swinging letting go and swinging stage you will probably do in the future. Just freaking insane.
you should make one for both hand so you have two shots
13:20 cafeteria scene
now try to web up ur enemies 💀
Dude fr became spiderman, what a Legend
Image if u har two😮 Then you could swing release and swing again
This is actually exactly like the gear used in attack on titan, you should make that next!!!!
i love the nile red reference
U should make two
You know you could make a batman grappling gun with it.
Does nobody gonna talk about how NileRed’s voice just popped up at 2:25 ? 😂
Can you make chainsaw man's chainsaws and chainsaw head
can you make a real spiderman suit that actually talks to you, just like in spiderman : homecoming, and looks identical to it?
When he started to talk like NileRed I instantly noticed it but it was a shock when NileRed himself came out 😅
Yo I'm making a project kinda like this one but I'm stuck can we talk
Wouldn't surprise me if you perfected it next video like seriously
Bro made his childhood fantasy a real thing !
atp make ODM gear
Finish the iron man flying south
Let me be in a video please please please I've been working on a costume
Make  a folding   Bataran 😀
Please make a propeller power flying scooter
Me: just vibing  Also me: 2:24 REALLY NILE RED
Take money bro this is very cool
Where do you get custom suction cups from I’m trying to make an invention and I need suction cups
Hi, I'm your fan, you're the best, you inspire me a lot with everything you do and I'm also a mechatronics engineering student (I've only been studying for a year) and I want to do a project that is a robot that helps people with disabilities to walk and I'm based on a robot called ROBEAR and I would like you to give me an idea of ​​how to start doing it because I need an advance for my digital electronics subject but I have blocked myself and I don't know what to do to be able to give you an advance on the project
Now do it with 300 types of web like in a movie
The NileRed splice-in cracked me up!!
Spider-man blasts holes in the entire city. No wonder Jonah Jameson thinks Spidey is a menace.
"I was able to pull out some white goo"- That does sound known. Nile Red
the nilered voice got me
Can you give your camera man and say try please
I think it would of been easier to genetically modify a spider to give you spidey powers
Feels More Like Batman's  Grappling Hook I'd say.
Mad respect for your dedication ❤
You should make one for your left hand too
bro its cool but is it cool when leaving holes in where you shoot and you could shoot a person brutal death instant you should stick to the other one the glue except of that use gorilla glue its the strongest I can fine
Как всегда всё супер прикольно и смешно спасибо большое 👍👍👍
Man living our dream life
Request: can you make gloves that can give you the force from star wars using magnets
You should try using those sticky toys that stick to the walls and ceiling
Hey jake. Ya gotta make some attack on titan 3D manouver gear. That stuff moves people faster than spidey ever could.
Request, not sure if you're taking these anymore, but possibly the holographic screen glove controllers, from minority report???  also all you need for spider-man is spidey sense and practise.
I would say u would be Andrew Garfield Spiderman
The nile red bit is funny 😂
now you just need super strength and spider sense
You should make another one for the other arm and try to swing twice in a row
And they said money doesn't buy u happiness
its all fun and games till someone uses the wrong web shooter
This is getting too real xD. . ..moreeeeeee!!!
Pls make a diy charger because we struggle with blackouts
BRO that NileRed reference at 2:15 is just hilarious lol
what if instead 2 or more magnets could be shot out in like a net which could wrap around an object then stick to themselves. my cave man brain thinks it would be pretty cool
Here comes the rope hero
You should make a web grenade from spider man homecoming
Yo that’s sick, closest thing I’ve seen to real web shooters
that's similar to the ODM gear in attack on titan
Can you make a Batman suit?
more proof that we live in the best timeline. I'm just concerned about how you'd get those nails out conventionally, looks like you got it figured out, though.
I bought one
Looks like something the military would want
ok so now swing from a 10 foot thing into the ceiling, then release mid air onto a different 10 foot thing. just like spider man
🕸️ i
OMG That was amazing Jlaser. Great work!
But if you shoot you some one to rap him he will die
Hello
hey officers how about we stop shooting people in the back when they run away and use this instead?
Hey Jlaser! This isn’t a suggestion for a project but, I’ve always loved the inventions that your fans make! If it’s possible, would you be able to make a montage of your fans creations? Thanks, Liam Ford😁
My 5yo son says, "Make Gru's rocket bike from 'Minions: Rise of Gru."
bro i swear next video he bouta find some way to turn himself into the hulk
make microbots/Big hero 6
https://youtu.be/ugyehYT_Wt0 2:26 this might help for future models?
Hacksmith inc would be proud
what colors your buggatti
So basically he replicated the 3D ODM gear
Ok its settled, You are gonna be Spiderman and Hacksmith is gonna be Iron Man
Man is making holes in some random lady's house to make his childhood dream come true lol 😂  I liked the vid though 🙂
He even looks like spiderman dudeeee
Dude should go Batman instead of Spiderman.
next you need to make it so you can swing repetitively
Can you wear one on both wrists?
next time if you're going to improve it you should make two
Hello Bro that you stop if you make the hidden sheet of assassin's creed
Loved the nilered reference
this is insane
Can you make the foldable iron man Hand with the mine arc rector and make it out of metal
Your so close all you need now is a way to continue to swing web to web.
Can you make a lightSaber
[tries to invent Spider-Man's web shooter] [accidentally invents Scorpion's spear]
I just started watching this channel today and its awesome, But I have a question. Is this a how to build/ engineering Channel or a Origin Story of a Superhero channel? I'm thinking Origin Story.
i felt like we strayed from the spiderweb part as soon as there was too much mehanical part and less webb...but the result is still very satisfying. And as you said...you are one step closer to become spiderman. Now its to see how to handle two ''nail'' shooter and be able to do more than one swing
This could EASILY be pivoted a bit and make a working real Batman grapple gun
Make a ironman my 3 full suit and give it to me
The web shooter doesnt have the white line decals like on the store page. -_-
He should combine this with a Titanfall jump-kit to make a grapple pilot.   👇
After some research, canonically Spider-Man uses salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate. Maybe try it out?
2:25 NileRed reference😭
Now make the AoT ODM Gear
*repulsors*
make fricking a working iron man gauntlet which shoots lasers XD
It feels like This Spiderman is just one sad backstory away from becoming dc villain
Didn’t even take a second thought to order on of your shooters!
worlds best collaboration: mark rober and JLaser
Like 70% Spider-Man but market it as attack on titan ODM gear and it’s legit perfect
You should make a drone and the gloves to control it from the first Sonic movie dr. Robotnic
Will you be able to do full force testing for "web swinging"? Being able to hang or have a pendulum effect it fantastic, but I'd love to see some true swinging action from a high point, seeing the max potential as you would see in spiderman
4:10
Kickass would be so proud of you
Could you make big hero 6 big hero 6 microbots
Now you need 2
Nile red entered the chat
that nile red voice got me xD
i hope you ship in to czech because if yes i gonna buy it asap
You gotta make a second one and swing twice bro. That the official Spider-Man
Me: I'll just skip to the good part...  Also me literally every time: *watches entire video *
I don't think that would hold on the window of a skyscraper very well.
Please make more underwater gadgets!  Stuff you can use while scuba diving. Like an underwater sword with propeller motors. Or an underwater hammer with a motor at the back, or some rotating shield. Or an automatic shark feeder.
Man i will pay any amount of money in funding etc or prototypes for a spidey suit from u 😂💯
now supper strength
Put one on your other arm And swing twice!
put another one on your other hand
When cap said avengers assemble he just called him
Next plz make working odm gear from attack on titan plz
This is actually batman tas style grapple gun in most of the body.    can't wait for the next iteration
Will it be availeble again?
2:34 nilered 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do Sanji Diable Jambe
AHHH THE WHITE STUFF IS CUMMING OUT OF THE HOLE
Dude is crazy strong
You gotta try putting two grapples on and swing from one to another
bro pulled a vsauce reference
After this he will get rid of fall damage 😅
I think you need a “neutral” mode for the web-reel motors, so that when you want to let go, you can just let it freely pull itself out instead of having to rely on the motor.
This is very cool
I remember the old school days came so far from grapplers and magnets💯
Now we only need minor precognition in-order to tell what places are safe to swing from.
You know those slap toys that come in the bubble dispensers that stick to walls. Could you make the equivalent of that but with the hand being formed to mimic gecko grip.

You are a garage lab genius. Like.a Jimmy neutron.
Never stop please, all the grown kids that want to be spiderman since 4 are counting on you
How do you get a the web in again
12:45 That guy is in for a surprise when he goes to use his spare tire…
Now He just needs a suit where he can hold the ammo
Becoming spider won't just be a dream in the futer
Can you make the power ranger samurai fire smasher
Add super strength to it now!!!
sir these thing is so nice and i am big fan of spiderman , i want to buy the shooter but idont have money
Lets just reiterate the stuff this man has been able to experienced.  -He has climbed up skyscrapers -He has flown on a hoverboard -He has flown using arm thrusters -He has swung like Spiderman (twice) -He has walked on water
This is both the most jankist and most awesome thing I’ve ever seen love it . Keep on keeping on J👍
Add a grapple hook and you got yourself a real nice thing
My question is can it be shot on skyscrapers tho like isn't it made out of glass
We are literally watching this man become a superhero!!
You’re literally spider-man
Hear me out, attack on titan ODM gear with the same method?
Can you try making Scorpion's Spear from Mortal Kombat basing off of this concept?
9:07
If he built another replica of the other one he could go twice the difference 😮
2:25 Nile red????
You should do the hidden blade of assassin's creed
Why don't u use nanobots combined with an organic matter like polymer to strengthen the web while keeping its like properties
You should try and make something that mimics Mr Fantastic's elasticity. Bet ya can't!
🕷😍🎉 7:04
He is like Tony stark, this is his mark 1 web shooters probably mark 50 web shooters will be nano tech
Is the board you glued to the ceiling still there?
This is literally just like in the movies when spiderman is building and learning how to use his gadgets and abilities. You straight up the real life Peter Parker as well as Spider-Man dude!!
Now gotta make a second one for the other arm and have two shots that you can make to really make another step to spiderman
the future that elon mars doesn't talk about
This is some impressive stuff
Perfect! Now all you need is a way to have spider sense 😊
You can definitely perfect Batmans grappling gun from the new movie.
How has Marvel and Disney not got ahold of you yet for the flying bouncing Cap Shield?  That thing would sell millions every single year until the end of time. It looks like a very fun toy.
Broo i can’t wait to see what you are gona do with this in 10 years you are right there just a fast reloading system and have them on both hands and you can swing over and over🔥
That's really cool.But can you the Edith glasses?
Bro you can’t this stuff to yourself you gotta share this type of stuff so people can learn how to do it
2:26 NileRed 😂😂😂
IN A COUPLE YEARS HES GOING TO CRACK THE REAL DEAL
Am I the only one thinking this man accidentally created a real life Attack on Titan ODM Gear?! Please make a modified version of this for an AOT episode or something. You're already 90% there to the actual thing, except you need 1 more, and attached to the hip instead of your arm. That is sweet on it's own too btw, fantastic build.
He looks like Airrack.
Have you thought about making a EDF powered Wasp flying platform?
You should make one for your other hand
I'm happy and scared
Wouldn't it be better to use a exoskeleton that distribute the weight and allows you to move a little bit more freely?
what if he made a modified version of the wall climbers and made it so it could wrap around or stick to any type of rough surfaced object, then had that at the end of the rope and somehow had enough force to fire it. that would be really cool.
Only 40 bucks?!?! THANK YOU! ordered! 😎😎
Why did I hear nile red in the web making section
make sticky boots like spidy
Next you should make the little drone that comes off his suit in the newer Spider-Mans
bros gonna be the very first super hero or supervillian maybe even an anti hero. Get a suit now lol
But could you make one that you could do rapidly , like swing and  realize ,swing and realize( like if you were to almost do it in an actual city, sorry if that is a lot to ask 😅
You should make a fully retractable ant man helmet like from the movie. It’s like the iron man helmet but more complicated.
Para cuándo lo subes en español
This man has the ability to actually become spiderman since he can shoot webs, swing, and climb walls. Huge round of applause for this man.
Now build a second one and do multiple jumps. ANd then go full attack on titan
That moment at 2:25? You cannot tell me that's not a not a NileRed reference.
love it
Do Superman flying CAPE😊🎉!!!
I challenge you to make Thor’s Hammer that can come back to you when thrown.
have you thought about resolidifying the polymer after its been created and shot out, that way it keeps the tensile strength of the string or nylon and the stick still does the stick
What about mule tape rated for 5000 or 2500  pounds. I used for electrical and it comes on a 5000 plus foot real
as long as youre makin things that shoot and hook onto obects.....*ahem* odmgearfromattackontitan *coughcough*
What if he makes the real thing
You're probably not going to see this but if you do can you try and make batman's glider or something batman related
Ok ok is the best thing I see you creat right now
BROOOO THIS ONE OF THE RAWEST VIDEOS IVE SEEN INNA MINNN😭
Como cuando quieres matar a un enemigo
bro should use this to climb big trees
Make a hulk smasher
Make hulk smasher
Dude that suit with a few modifications like a faster and more responsive reel mechanism so it could tension the slack almost instantly and switch between foreword and revers really fast, set up a course with platforms that are durable and also replaceable once they are rendered unusable and get like 4 d’arts per arm that you can contrôle individually and you got yourself a new swinging racing sport and I would 100% want to do it
Turn it into a Batman grapple gun
So good bro how
Assassin's Creed hidden blade perhaps?
Am I the only one that noticed the transition of his voice to nile red's voice? XD
love how he keeps it real, hacksmith lost their spark, you're carrying
so less spiderman, more Attack on Titan. Yes please!
MAKE ODM GEAR PLEASEEEEE ❤🔥
i need to get one of thos so bad
In the future, people would say:  It’s like bringing a web shooter to a laser fight!
Double up multiple swings  🧪🕷️
legitimately watched him go from a few thousand views to millions. you are a genius man! 💯
Well done dude! Ever since seeing that Mythbusters episode I wondered if it could have been done better. I was thinking in terms of concrete walls but I'm amazed how well you've made it work with wood! Bet it's freaky to use though; it's basically a gun that shoots another gun haha
how about, jump from the cherry picker, then shoot, swing and release
He literally made a tank shell
How lonh to do the web shooters stay up
please
this is cool asf but if you could make it so that the nylon creating solution was in a tube similar to the original spiderman web shooters and the nylon itself has adhesive properties i think it'd be even cooler, although extremely complex to create. i think you can pull it off
Cria o jarvis
make a wooden sword
Was that a NIleRed voice clip?
8:58 spider menace has been destroying our cities windows with nails, another reason he should be  behind bars
lol he looks like Andrew Garfield
That was amazing now all that is left is a short film you are coming into action as Spiderman
Is the web shooter that you can buy at your website ever going to be back in stock?
My man made a batman gadget. Lmao
You made a grapple gun harpoon not a web shooter
another idea you the thing that you put on ur frind like a net you should add that on to it.
Awesome
it's inspiring to see people pushing the boundaries of what's possible with their imagination and creativity, and I hope that this kind of innovation will continue to inspire and motivate others to explore new ideas and possibilities.
Put one on both hands. Then make quick refillable carts to stick again
How's that spare tire with a hole in it? :D
The websooters are grate, there are on of if not the most advanced I have ever seen, and beaus of that I would love to see you make an ODM gear from attack on titan, witch has the same functionality, but with a larger design, to accomodate all the electronics, and the canisters for the air pressure, and the ODM gear by default has you supported from the hips and the legs, to leave your arms free
Can you make a Rhino suit from the PS4 game from 2018 by Insomniac Games?
Dude literally turnee into nilered
really want a spring ring
Yo could you build the microbots from "Big here 6" ?

It would be so cool if he did the green goblins glider
This reminds me of the Mirror's Edge Catalyst wrist grappling hooks. That's really cool! Definitely keep at it! This could really turn into a product line! Can't wait to see what you come up with next
We need Andrew Garfield Toby mcguire  and Tom holland to try these
impressive
At this point you could make your own original super suit
Same
Dude I would love to know how to make those spinning fan LED displays that can display images by spinning so they look like holograms. I know that I could just buy one but these things have so much potential imo
Your always the first to create such great ideas, keep on being awesome man
I’d have so much fun with this, childhood memories and dreams of being Spider-Man would be achieved 😩❤️
Don't shoot at the aquarium dude
Real question did they remove the spare before shooting a nail into it
Bro try ODM gear from Attack on Titan that's really cool , and somehow seems more practical than web shooters .
Titanfall. You have just created the grappling hook from Titanfall. 😲🤯 If you make a **jump kit** and find a pilot helmet replica you'll be the closest thing we have to Titanfall 2 technology, which is a dream come true.
Nicee but what about cement wall I'm not pointing your mistake but just asking about it plss don't mind it  Btw big fan fro India ❤❤
Pair it with a left gauntlet so u can traverse with 2 swings
Have confidence in you we believe that you cannot pull off a Tony Stark and build yourself a mechanized Spider-Man suit and even if it takes so long to where you can't be the hero you will find a worthy soul to take on the mantle and become our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Come on, this is clearly the beginning of ODM gear!
Have you actually thought of selling some of your web shooter designs so that kids could have a web shooter that actually is more web like in nature cuz you could use the funding from that the money coming from that from Sears selling all those stuff the money you'd be banking in order to fund more responsible adult child type toys cuz that's what you doing here   you're indulging your inner child but doing it at an adult level
Never stop what you're doing bro
cool now go spend another 2 years figuring out how to make a web that is strong enough to hold you and disolvable so you dont have to worry about getting those things out
i guess you should try making the ODM gear from attack on titans.........
Lol a magnet
I think this is more like the ODM gear from attack on titan you know still pretty awesome though
Make the big hero 6 flying fist
Wow what a thumbnail and tomorrow u will show us dinosaurs
Got a full Syndrome arc going on with the gadgets you’re building.
We might all be ignoring the fact this dude hits 315 on bench
Or to make everything simple u could just get bit by that spider like peter did duhh
Use two shooters on both hands!
Thanks for turning my childhood movie into reality
It's kinda closer to Batman's grapple hook with motor and stuff than it is to a web-shooter
the chosen one
That'll make a sweet Scorpion kunai!
I have the urge to say "GET OVER HEEERRRE!"
This is definitely more Batman then Spider-Man better watch out the government will be knocking on your door pretty soon
Imagine this being refined for rock climbing
This is great  MY idea at the start was to just send strong ropes but at the end of those r opes have super glue ejectors so that w hen they come in contact  the whole thing kind of bursts out superglue combining all of the rope and ceiling together, it is messy and i don't know  we eject the glue at the last moment but the end result of what you made was excellent.
bro is the next mark rober💀
15:18 gave me an attack on titan vibe cause of the odm gear
MAKE A ATTACK ON TITAN ODM GEAR IT WILL BE SO FUN
Tbh give it a redesign overhaul and he got 3D maneuvering gear
We are watching this dudes origin story to becoming spiderman
Alternative tittle: Teenager realises he can throw white sticky goo out of his body
Thought I recognised the Nile red type chemistry
Jake you are my new hero I’m trying to make something like this but without causing thousands of dollars in property damage, and I’m going to be sure to buy one of you webshooters the moment I can!!
can you make iron man mark 80 nanomachine
My childhood dream is coming true take all of my money
Just a few more years and he will be swinging 🕷🕷🕸🕸
Bro U R better than hacksmith ❤❤
NILE?
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Now is almost time for him to climb a building and b off and swing I estimate 5-15 years
anyone have a review of the web shooter you can buy?
I have a challenge for you make a real blue kamekameha  from dragon ball z plsssss
Bro just created spider-mans web fluids within the first 2 minutes of the video
make spiderman senses mask to complete the set of spiderman
Can you please 🙏 make a 🦇 batman style smoke bomb 💣
Make dr octopus arms
MAKE PERCY JACKSONS SWORD PEN
Bro is slowly turning into spiderman
Imagine if you could compact the magnets, the grapple and the net thing all in one gauntlet and have it on both arms!
8:48, Comment section: that looks like a pipe b.... Me: it is... it is a pipe b... JLASER: ITS A WEBSHOOTER
That glue joke😭
Dude my mans gonna become spider-man irl at this point...
Next video he’s gonna give himself spider sense
I'm waiting for this guy to accidentally shoot himself in the face with a web shooter
Make vision ❤❤❤
So this is a gas powered grappling gun...  i think batman did it first...
Make Spider-Man’s suits
well done
Duuude u need one on bouth arms
Shinzou wo sasageyo
Spooder man
I just ordered the webshooter. It looks sick! Can't wait for it to arrive, but I'm from the Netherlands so it will probably take a while😂 keep up the great work man!
You definitely wont be sticking to the sides of buildings tho xD
Hey can u make a Shazam Suit that will appear on you when something happens
U a fuking genus
Your tech is cool but I think you could probably do better about giving credit to the team behind your You Tube character.
dude literally made new odm gear
This feels more Batman than Spiderman actually
Bro u do not deserve to love in this planet....       Your too smart 👌✨
make them for the police and miltary they would probably have a use other than that could be useful in survival kits  mountain climbing and such
thats more attack on titan
Did anyone notice the Nilered reference when he said I was able pull off white goo
Awsome man, great job 👍
now you need two with automatic reloads and you're good to go!   Very impressed how you manage to put all those pieces together into a single functional tool. Very cool!
It's Nile Red&Blue
All i want to see in my life time is for someone to make actual working web-shooters.. seems like the fans are getting closer to making that a reality ❤
Nile red was there
Noice
If only my arms wouldn't rip off
impressive
Military Will be contacting you soon lol
Those single arm grapples from Halo might become a reality one day.
Nice....
Wow the web shooter costs $100 AUD cos of shipping that is steep
Wow, that's really amazing work u guys r doing
Trying to be spiderman, accidentally makes attack on titan's 3d maneuvering gear.
This guy is gonna do some great things 💯
Bro this is so sick so when can I buy this 😂
Bro it's more like attak on titan than Spiderman still pretty cool
make 2 of them, that would be sick
Get over your wierd anti-gun stuff.
The Nile red cameo was so unexpected but I was already thinking it before it happened 😂
Turned into Nile
In about 10 years bros gonna have one the size of a pocket watch swinging around like spidey
Make one more shooter for your left hand and do two simultaneous swings without stopping
Do next venom sticki shooter
Bro thinks he is him
Still waiting on the jlazer series finale where he puts all the gadgets together to defeat elon musk.
Making an accurate Nightwing gauntlets and his awesome electric escrima sticks
Wow holy smokes
Yo JLazer! You Should Try To Make The ODM Gear From Attack On Titan, It Think It Would Be Easier To Make Then The Web Shooter, Since The ODM Gear Is Bigger An Goes On Your Waist Then A Web Shooter That Goes On Your Wrist!
marvel should just hire you to make some of the gear that they use in their movies
Ok this is really cool but like are we going to ignore that he is basically just making a gun with a line attached to the bullet
Do a real flying falcon wings
Him does science turns into nilered
Spider-Man needs to see this video.
2:21 nile red's voice
Loved the NileRed reference hahaha 👏🏽👌🏽
You're not spiderman until you can swing at least twice. One on each arm!
I have a cool idea im not gonna say it ere but it could make web fluid you can put in cartridges
You should try telekinesis 👍🧠🧠〰️〰️
If there is a news about spiderman well this dude is the one.
This is awesome! Next step, dual wield and reload system next, you could also collaborate with the parkour youtube channels and make a parkour course that needs those to finish, also they might have more grip strengh so a motor might not be necessary who knows
Honestly, this looks more amazing if you see it as the grappling hook from Just cause 2!!!! Still, love the new toy one you selling can't wait to hopefully buy it.
Wait so the motor is strong enough to pull you up? This is amazing as web shooters, but that's 100% a Batman grappling hook right there!
he alwyas scees on 2nd try
Banger video
This dude can actually make whatever you ask
Hehe I see what you did there with that NyleRed Reference ;3
Small adjustments and its the Anti-Personnel ODM gear.
Didn’t know Spider-Man shot rope out his WEB SHOOTERS
Ave a vídeo of the mask the deadpol that move eyes
Dude that’s so awesome. Btw you should look into Caulobacter crescentus. It’s a bacteria that secretes a substance so sticky that just a bit can lift several cars.
Ayyy love this and ur stuff. Should make the odm gear from attack on titan its a lot like this actually I feel like u could actually make it! (Omni-directional mobility)
Now give it a revolver mechanism that allows it to shoot consecutively along with a rope cut switch to quickly release and shoot
I heard Nile red
Is it me or did you use  NileRed’s voice for 2 seconds around the 2.5 minute mark? LOLOL
NILERED
get rid of the waist band
I so desperately want to meet him bc he’s the future
nilered voice is in 2:34
its just a grappling hook
If you create a second one, you can get more than the one swing out of it, possibly use a method to cut away the web instead of unwind, like a parachute
Really good cgi
That warehouse is gonna be curious where all the leaks suddenly came from
Make a working halo
Love the nod to NileRed
brro is the closest thing we have to a real life spiderman
NileRed
My childhood wanting to be spiderman is happy while watching this
This is like the 3D Maneuvering Gear from AoT.
Rapport
Cool
Bro made the worlds best grapple gun
Could you use this same spool idea to make a functioning compact grappling hook gun? 🧐
Tries to make a web slinger, makes a grappling hook gun without the hook.  On the next episode J: I'm Batman  It looks great
2 years later……..  SPIDER MAN SAVES CITY……
THIS. IS. ENGINEERING!  Very nicely done, man!
2:20 I verbally said “who are you, NileBlue???”  When Nile started talking i freaken lost it😂😂😂
The one thing about the webshooters is the webs disintegrate because if the webs stayed there forever 😐
Bro is making odm gear
we need this in a video game D:
nah thats bust
More dc
The U.S. military wants to know your location.
bro i knew he sounded like Nile red before he even made the voice
Can you please make a IRL spring Bonnie suit it is my dream.
Next you guys should try to be sticked, swing and get sticked in the wall again
Bro is gonna invent an actual full iron man suit that can fly without revealing the jets
yoooooooooooo
Make batmans suit.
sooooo another grappling hook?
yo what if you shot the web while you were jumping off
I have a suggestion. You have made boots that increase your jump and speed, but what if you made some that allowed you to fall further? Aperture Science Long Fall Boots!
This is fantastic! I can feel myself really wanting to play with this, lol. Great job.
just imagine being able to walk through the woods and have a portable rope swing like thats what the funnest use is. i sound like a fucking child
You kinda look like spider man in the ps4 game
Next you should make a carnage suit
Bro made a speargun and is calling it webs
this and builtIRL are actually pretty close. the next step is going from 1 swing to another without dislocating your shoulder
"Hello Peter, you want to fight a real enemy?"
u should make to to swing multiple times in a row
When you finally becomes Spider-Man, we’re gonna need you in California, Chicago, Portland and New York to fight crimes because democrats and leftists have defunded all the police because democrats and leftists are pro-criminal that’s why they let criminals out of jail to commit more crimes.  I don’t know if you heard this but all the Walmart stores said they were closing down due to theft. Go look it up. Welcome to biden’s America.
I did not know that this man could become even more like Spider-Man. All I have to say is soon a dude on tv is gonna be yelling about you like your a menace to society
Unemployed friend activities
Trying to be Spider-Man is wayyy too complicated that’s why I rather be Batman, Deathstroke, Hawkeye, the Punisher and Assassin Creed all roll into one badass motherfucker.   For Batman, I got a Kevlar level3 bullet proof vest, shoulder pads, knee pads, boots, real forearms spike gauntlets, throwing ninja stars, police belt with a gun and a black Suzuki ninja motorcycle. So instead of wearing the batman cawl and the cape, I replaced them with a red hood helmet which I color it black, put a black recurve bow and a Katana sword on my back so I’m basically Batman/Hawkeye and Assassins Creed since I got two real Assassins creed hidden blades.
make 2 to go anywhere
Who else feels like if all the invention YouTubers teamed up they could make an irl Spider-Man
White goo 😳😳🤨🤨💀💀
“2nd try” 50 other holes in the tire cover thing 😂
A demon  slayer  sword  when you posh a button  it will make  flaws
He might be far from being Spider-Man but he's way closer being The Batman.
What happened. I bought the web shooters when they first came out and never got them???
did you add an alarm so you can tell when your abut to run out of rope?
that NileRed part sounded so real i thought i was actually learning something instead of wasting time and procrastinating
Next step : pair this with the wall climbers and make it super compact
lol You should make a link hookshot XD
Looks like he would have a function attack on the titan rig before he becomes spiderman. It's really close to that. It's crazy🤯
This man’s got a government contract waiting in his mailbox lmao
That is really good! Maybe you could make like a mandolorian suit with everything it has in the show
Honestly this fits perfectly with Attack on Titans ODM gear. You should attempt it.
Odm gear when
You are living EVERYBODYS dream. You make YouTube content and people love you, and your content is literally being spiderman.
So this is more like ODM gear from AOT than web shooters. Still mega cool tho
Do the mark 84 back repulsors that come out of his back on infinity war or mark 85 back repulsors
Make ODM gear please
The ultimate grab-the-TV-remote-without-getting-up gadget 📺🕸️
MAKE CAPTIN AMRICAS SHEILD
use the helmet as a H.U.D and route all the info to display your surroundings/spider-sense
This is amazing. Not sure if I’d want to switch to using a web to grab my spoon rather than getting up, but to each their own. Can’t wait to see this on the news eventually. 😎
This is the coolest thing ever, on the next episode of this you gotta do a clip of you reeling yourself closer to the ceiling upside down, that would be dope!!!
Hola puedes hacer un traje de max max steel
All u need now is to make your reaction speed quicker for the spidey senses
Imagine it doesn’t stick when he needs it and just flies off a building
2:26 Nile red?
Can you imagine the ways this could be utilised in emergency services or military!? Between him and Hacksmith we could actually have super heroes soon!?
maybe you can make a new black panther suit
the other hand two
It would be crazy if he made gravity shoes to straight up walk on walls
all we need now is 43billion$ worth of concentrated steroids pumped into a child from birth to be strong enough to have to hold back like spiderman
w nile red refrance
He may not be at Spiderman level yet, but he's almost at Prowler level.  And anyway, his helmet makes him a Spider Ranger!   Good job, this guy is trying to make a dream come true.
You should make a second one to do a continuios swing
you gatta add the spring ring in spring
Can you do the iron man suit
The NileRed audio was amazing!
Glorified grapple hook not webs 😔😭
Omg my inner child
I suggest you make the web shooter for both arms it would make it more efficient and more spidey
You should make ODM gear from AOT
make 2
Am I the only one who noticed the Nile Red cameo 😂
the gripper reminds me of the odm gear from attack on titan
he fr made web serum💀
New favorite channel right here. Let's see you make Finn's grass sword from adventure time. Bracelet that morphs into a sword in a snakelike manner.
You know what’s crazy, people have said that your “arms can rip off” but I see any of that here so myth busted!
you should put this on both your hands so that you can shoot , stick , swing and then shoot n stick the 2nd one and release the 1st one so it can look like a proper swinging motion . but this already is soo cool
Make a master chief grappler
This was one of the best videos i have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was funny, entertaining, educational, and just great!!! And i love how you made mistakes but learned from them to make something even better!!! How long did it take to fully finish making them?!
"he might need help"  Turns him into Anakin Skywalker
bruh just put a spider in the microwave then make it bite you
You and havksmith should collab and make the ultimate suit with their spidy sense mask and everything it could be close to real
arrow fletchings could help stabilize the hammer so it's more accuate
Test it on a ballistic gel dummy
Then there's the videos he didn't release on genetic manipulation/ super serums...
now get 2 shooters and move around the warehouses without touching the ground!!
Next videob ''i became spiderman''
I think this man might actually find the secret of becoming the first irl spider-man, he’s been so persistent with each video he makes involving this
Odm gear
You need one on each arm so you can start swinging from building to building
Could you please make the Omnidroid from the Incredibles as a real rc? Thanks
Do think Nano tape would work at the end of the webs to make it stick? I know people have tried climbing like spiderman, but I don't think anyone has used it for sticky webs.
This is everything I have been dreming about. THIS IS AMAZING!
i give you full rights  t beacome the irl spider man before me
I just got a idea an i needed you to try it please, can u use The Gravity Case for phones to climb like Spider-man if u have enough of them? They say it can stick to anything without glue
Please make something from Attack on titan
Proto-spiderman
The crazy cat lady after Spider-Man rescues her cat from a tree by shooting it with a wrist mounted nail gun and winch:👁️👄👁️
Bro just made the grapple from that Zelda game
I wonder how many years it’s gonna take to see people really swinging like Spider-Man
Make a second one and then chain swing. >:)
Next step getting bit by a radioactiv spider Then profit
Seeing the end product literature made me exclaim  “damn that’s so cool!” out loud
bros not nile red
Batman grappling hook.
I can see this being the perfect things for swat or military use. Instead of arm mounted have it as a separate hand held device.
I love this dude so much
Holy heck how AWESOME(R) this would be in like a decade or two!! This is insane!
I think the next step is a second one on the other arm. Web swing to another web swing
This will actually work significantly better as Batman's grappling gun than Spider-Man's web shooters
It's not for 🇦🇷 😢😢
I know what you should do next is you should combine all of the things you’ve done for Spider-Man together into one suit
All he needs to do now is bio-engineer and synthesize the dna sequence of a house spider for redistribution in our genetic template and BAM! we’ll finally have a real life spider-man
Bro you got the gadgets now if you decide to work your body to the percise level where your gadgets don’t drop you yet still be strong enough to move stuff like the trash bin, if possible, you legit can be Spider-Man.
false advertising, can't stick to glass
This needs a sub. Just make a second one on your other arm. That's 100% dope.
I really didnt like the project
What abt the jet flying suit are u ever going to bring that back
Day 12 of asking to recreate Big Hero 6's Microbots
now just do it without the belt and you’re literally spider-man
I wonder if the webshooter designed to grab would be enough to actually temporarily subdue someone and is resistant to knives. If so then you could potentially sell that blueprint for serious $$$ to the police.
Honestly that's the best we can get at this point and man that would be cool to just come swinging through the function out of nowhere. 😂
jlaservideo makes the most best things ever, but is underrated
This is the closest thing we have to odm gear from aot
solo falta q despues de balancearte te pegues a la pared con las ventosas!
docter who suit
This is crazy. Just think. Computers were once the size of ROOMS. And those computers aren’t as powerful as our handheld iPhones today. The point? You’ve figured this out on a large scale. And with modern technology, I’m confident that it won’t even take 5-10 years to make this the real thing on a small level
@JLaservideo please please please upload more
So cool
Make doctor stranges Cloke make it fly to you and fly on its own I think that would be a cool project
I'm guessing the next step is to have one on each hand and swing from one to another?
Turns out that japanese spiderman was real all along. All he needs to do now is learning japanese, get that mech in japan working and reskin it and we're good to go
Now all you need is a second one.
I feel bad for the neighbors 😭😭
Ok I was skeptical for most of the video but actually hanging upside down from a story up is pretty crazy
bro turned into nile green in 2:17
Try Styroporglue with medical alcohol, it should be the same like web fluid
I would love a Batman grapple, probably my favorite tool/gadget in any media
make the AOT ODM gear
Props for the Spider-Man poses because that would be quite hard to do
Seems more like Batman than Spiderman, but I love it!
love the nilered reference
you should make a go cart that has a bunch of your inventions on it
And big companies are investing millions to release the same fking phone every year… Imagine what they could do with half of that money
Can you make an A.I .like Friday
ONE step closer to real spiderman!
2:15 Nile Red reference
You should make a real life light saber that would be super cool
I love you for this man, my childhood nostalgia is making me cry.
This is one of the greatest things I have ever seen. It is unbelievable that every day you come a step closer to becoming spoodey. Btw can you do something to make you go faster because that will be  out of this world
I need a new group of friends 🤦‍♂️
Heck yeah!
Bro made Spider-Man odm gear
Challenge:  Climb up a wall, shoot the web and swing towards another wall, stick to second wall and climb down
Super bro you are really gorgeous
He went in Marvel's Spiderman but accidentally went DC's Batman
You are super smart my dude!!! Hope you succeed in life!!
It would be sooo nice if u did it on the other hand and could like swing more than ones
You should add speakers to it so when you shoot it makes the Spider-Man web sound
heyyy i heard nile red there at 2:25
How will you swing around the city with glass on the bulidings?
I swear to god in the next few years, I think we are gonna see Spider-Man really swinging through New York. The amount of work that has gone into developing this runs pretty damn deep. I honestly think if you can condense the reaction, I think you can get more out of it. And maybe research compounds in a spiders web.
Make something to make you swim fast  please 🙏
my dude you gotta patent this as fast as tyou can i can see so much practical application for this
Cool video and gadgets…… but 14:33 daddy
I know he was aiming for webshooters but that's basically a grappling hook.  With some modifications it could work like batman's grappling hook!
Plz lower the price of web shooter love from India ❤❤
This so much work why not just get bitten by a radio active spider
now you need one on each hand
Could you maybe not shoot things at a fish tank? Not cool to the fish, dude.
You should try to get a collab with hacksmith some time on a projekt
" super glue *sniff* seems to be the best"
You should combine all your best gadgets and become your own unique superhero with your own suit.
Is no one gonna mention the nile red sound byte lmao
i wonder.if a 360 cartridge system around the arm could be used to get more cartridges while the other reloads
love the nilered reference
So what Spiderman did was he made the nylon form inside his cuff so he had almost an endless supply. So I guess you would need 4 compartments. The third compartment being the sticky substance. One that dries quick enough after coating the rope but liquid enough for the rope to swim through. The 4th compartment being the one where the road forms. The other 2 compartments being the liquid that forms the nylon. Can you make your own glue that when introduced to air it turns dry yet sticky?
idea for gadget to try: remote controlled batarang
I'd actually own one
That thing is actually pretty cool
this man could be the best criminal if he was a bad person
batmans grapple hook that you can reel yourself up
we’re getting closer and closer from creating a real life superhero
Creasing he's dragging the spare wheel case like when peter was dragging his lunch tray
Now make one for your left arm so you can swing two times 18:27
Totally serious here bro how to I reach him I have the perfect idea it works too atleast kinda its quite big too but we can work ok it ig i am willing to share it with you
now u need one in each hand
If LA suddenly gets it's own spiderman in the next few years, we know who it is
wack
Bro ur god brained
This is Tony Stark for real
AYO 2:25
It’s like the red dead laso but with spider man 😂
finish the wimds
Try making the different kinds of webs from the spider man games
And if it doesn’t work it’s still be a cool toy which it probably won’t work
Can you take on a challenge of making a Zik Strom sword with all the features and make it look Realistic
The unemployed homie at 2 am on a Tuesday:
This guy knows me too well. Because I was legitimately thinking of trying to do this myself-
More like grappling hook
The more realist project is iron man Spider-Man will require a test tube child
I love your videos.. i wish I was like a consultant for some of your ideas... Would save you some time and money from what I've seen... Unless of course.. you're doing it for the fun of it and because you can. 😂😂😂
What if you put the liquid inside the web shooters and make it turn into a web when it goes out
shopify support is a myth
You should try building a edf rc car
I wonder if you could make a devil breaker from dmc5 like hardway or the buster arm that would be pretty cool honestly
Military might give him a call. We may have a platoon of web stingers in the future.
Maybe focus to really make one thing perfect
Absolutely love this, as a massive Spider-Man fan I can't wait to see where you take this next. Great video :)
wow that's good
Now we just need to combine both of them to make a web that can stick to anything without killing someone and use different chemicals that make a web like substance and works with glue probably good to use magnets as well
He's basically also made the Halo: Infinite grappling hook
What if you used a razor to cut the rope, instead of reversing the wheel. Kinda like how when tape rips off when when it comes in contact with the razor, or a button just to snip the rope.
Can you make a black panther suit
Rats are like little dogs🐀🐕
dock dock arms? then have a video after you make doc rock arms spider man vrs doc ock
microbots from big hero 6
Need any sensor and attach it on Spiderman mask like smart glasses in the eyes purpose to warn you if there something
Jesus Christ died for all of our sins. He died the death we all deserved. He was the perfect one who never sinned once, but he loved us so much he decided to die for us so our sins would be paid for and we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven before God the Father blamelessly. He is the living son of God who wants to know us and have a personal relationship with us. No matter  what you have done no matter how far gone you think you are Jesus can and will save you. All you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Believe that he died on the cross for your sins and had a bodily resurrection 3 days later. We cannot be saved by our works but by faith in Christ alone. Repent and turn to Christ. You will have joy, happiness, love, and peace beyond understanding.
Mcu needs to give him a cameo in the next spidey movie
2:26 he sound like nilered
Make it so you Just Cut To Release
This is really cool! You should build another one for the other arm so that you can release the first web while shooting another one and continue swinging!
Can you. Please please please tell me how did you made that human flying drone I want to make that but I don't know how to and where to start please
its not sticks though, clickbate
This is more batman than spiderman, but... Still. Amazing
im going crazy i herd nile red
This is honestly gonna be adapted by special operations and swat teams everywhere
patiently waiting for you to do a ben 10 video
US army should invite u
ur things can use for catch criminal lol
Congratulations and awesome video have a awsome day
Am I only one thinking "oh this could be a good tool to use to escape from heists"?? lol
dude he looks so freaking cool wish i could do that
Make 2 of them so u can swing infinitly.
Can't tell if he's Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne...
Next project: ARC REACTOR
@JLaservideo Why not use the artificial gecko skin veritasium made a video on recently? Use the string you have but have a few pads or strings at the end made of that skin stuff he talked about?
2:00, what was that sniff?
jacked
So now,  JLaser is  Spiderman Hacksmith is iron man Ididathing is clearly Thor or Hawkeye ... WHere do we find the rest of he team?
I love the part where spideman says Its comin time and comed all over harry because he's a little goblin junior gonna cry
Will you please stock your webshooters again
next step, one in each hand.
Dum ways to die
HOW DID NO ONE NOTICE THE NILERED REFERENCE AT 2:25 💀💀
Make grapple shoes
more like batman arpoon
Pls restock web shooters thank you
Make PYM PARTICALS this time 😂😂
I like that nilered cut at the start
Peak
u need one for each arm
now imagine what he can do when Elon finishes the Neuralink
This is also kinda similar to the Attack on titan Anti-personel ODM gear. Would love to see him make that
if senku had a youtube channel
Is the webshooter you're selling a single one or a pair?
How much can you bench?
He's pretty much entry level military scientist at this point😂
Need another one on the other arm to make it perfect
peter to miles: look what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power.
There is a formula for the web fluid in the movies and comics you can try and use.
Now imagine two of those in each hand + the wall climbers...
Wait this seems like it could be real
I want you to make a carnage ferrofluid suit
You should fly out one of the Spider-Man actors to use it
I like how it says attempt number two but there's about half a dozen holes in his tire holder that we weren't shown
You should sell that quickly reloading one to Hasbro kids would love it and you'd have a lot more money for invented
what about the reloading time
You sounded like NileRed for a sec
Bro why’d you morph into Nile blue in the middle of your video
Guess their is a neew piderverse and it's him lol
In a few years I'll bet you all we'll see a real .. spiderman swinging across the roads saving people and swinging away
Nile red hahahaha
What if you made an entire pokemon with coded ai to help it learn moves like In the game ideas could be a larion, metagross, or a room ai for the I phone and Samsung that you can sell to pokemon fans. I know I would buy it no matter what
So that's how they make nylon pretty much its for fishing ot stuff
Now u make 2 and try to transition from one to another.
2:26  oh no nile red
I did not expect nilered
Use teeth on the grippers like pilers
What happen if your pants fall off?
i recomend combining every single spiderman invention that u did
Did anyone else notice the Nile Red reference at 2:16 ??? @NileRed
Watch the next video be " Genetically modifying a radioactive spider to give me superpowers! "
You guys should get Ilram Choi (one of the Garfield Spidey stunt doubles) to have a go at this once you have perfected this
or gauntlets from which we can use the force
can u make a retractable lightsaber pls
use this with suction cups and have it less powerful. also have 2 options for using the nail or just the suction cup
I don’t want to be a party pooper, but how would you reload it really quickly if you like falling down from the building that’s just another idea to add onto it but really cool video❤❤❤❤❤❤
Scuft
The Nile red audio was nice
2:24 that NileRed impression was on point 😂
I heard NileRed's voice in there
Make a second one bro
Dope.
This is more of a scorpion's spear. Get over here hahaha ❤
Bro became nilered for a sec there😂
Think about it guys if he has one and is that effective image if he makes two for his other hand and shoots one then releases it then shoots the other one it’ll look insane
🔥🔥🔥
CRAZY. BUT Please longe rope :))))))))
Only thing you need now is “instant kill mode”
It would be interesting for you to make your own laboratory like Tony starks and you could also add that robot that knows anything
Nile Red voice 2:26
I find it funny that right when he said “bout to catch me a Zack” I played a fishing add
Best sold item if they were made!
Spider-man might be a bit beyond this, but this is practically a perfect grapnel gun system now for your alternate universe backyard Batman.
women: why do we live longer than men? men:
Get on other arm too so you can continuously swing;)
more akin to a grappling gun, but still very cool.
I know this is a Spiderman-themed gadget but it seems so much more like Scorpion's lethal kunai chain attack
Without a doubt, some sort of 3 letter agency somewhere is keeping tabs, I would also advise to start looking at patent potential.   As an example, think how useful that would be for search and rescue teams. Someone fell off a cliff, rescue team could just Ramset one right at their feet, have a belay system and lower themselves straight down
they called him.... nail man
2:26 like what my man just transformed into Nile gree
Build a Jurassic world gyrospere
Make anything that will help you go faster than your last World record
make a hoverboard
Make a foldable sword 🗡️
Imagine a live-action Spider-Man film with all realistic web shooters and no cgi. That would be amazing.
Awesome😮
Now make another and web swing
do you sell these
1:12 Mario: Yahoo! 😂
Bro casually made the website fluid
Now you can make it into like a taser
m
i love the little reference to that one scientist youtuber
Amazing what someone can do with imagination and ingenuity. I am showing this to everyone I know. 🕷
Damn bro, now u all u need is 2 of them and a way to reload ur off hand in the time it takes to swing and u would be irl spidy
gotta say, clicked the video cause i thought it was I did a thing… stayed because well Spiderman
Now you just gotta combine this with the venom…………..
Honestly this is more like the chainhook from Pacific Rim: The Black. But either way this is sick!!!!
feels like a modern version of the japanese spider-man
anyone else here nilered whennhe pulled out the goo ???
combine  the wall climbers with it
Sweet, you’ve gotta make two and do a double swing
Can you make sang chi rings next pls
At this point it’s basically a Batman grapple gun 😂
You should jump and swing
Ahahahahaaaaa !!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!! I LOVE THIS I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL I LOVE YOUR TEAM I LOVE YOU!!!!!
Pls make big hero six microbots
One day this guy will make a real omnitrix
JLaser, could you make an iron man hulk buster suit? Almost like a mech in real life. That would be awesome.
CAN YOU SELL IT THIS WOULD BE THE BEST GIFT also you should do a video where you usem the grapplwer AKA spidey webs and the sticky thins to climb walls on all hands
Our boy JLaser is now being backed by the big guns!! First Mr Beast now Hacksmith!!
Can this have any practical use for military? Climbing up buildings to rescue hostages? Upon further upgrades, a last means of escape from the top floors of a large building? Strap it to the front of authoritative vehicles to grab onto a fugitive’s moving vehicle?
Love this, also how about making a weapon from RWBY.
You will NEVER have the muscle required to swing you properly without wrenching your shoulder out of the socket *at best*. Which sucks. My dream is ruined.
So he actually ended up making ODM gear from AoT xD
I am thinking of you making next are you working Captain America shield the actually chop stings in half plz me sick
This is awesome, you need one on each hand so you can keep swinging
Videos like this bring the internet together lol. Thank you!
You should attach the harness to the web shooter on your wrist. Allen pan made a design that worked really well with a harness. You could also use clam cleats as a mechanism to hold your web in place on your wrist
Now you gotta build another one to double swing
You should make the prosthetic tools from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
bro turned into nile red for a seond
You should make a strong exoskeleton so you have the strength of spiderman too
Make a dragon suit that you can fly?
You basically recreated the Taser dart. Maybe you should have taken apart a cartridge to see how they loaded it to get the dart to fly straight. I did. It's actually kinda fascinating how they store the wire coils and how they routed the air channels for the best performance from a tiny compressed air canister.
Now make one for the other hand and swing twice in a row
@marvel wya
its cool but it dosnt compare to the Usopp aaaaaAAAaaaAAaaa
Does anyone know what kind of pneumatic valve he is using here at 9:10.  because I can't seem to find anything big enough to control a co2 cartridge.
The NileRed parody lol
Do you have a license for that
Gotta love that NileRed reference there
Put a second one on the other hand
You should make the AOT swords that shoot out and pull you
❤❤❤
Now just make one for the other arm and practice
Now he needs two of them. Give them to a Trampolinist or a Acrobat. Imagine seeing someone jump off a trampoline flipping into the air and swinging to another trampoline. Yes it would be dangerous.
I knew it from the beginning but I couldn’t believe he actually reference Nile red
Please make this man the next spiderman Amen
Dude you have to make one for each arm and like chain the shots together to swing across the whole warehouse🤩
This is an incredibly violent weapon
Crazy how you're getting pretty close to attack on titan's ODM gear
This is some incredible execution on an idea that defies physics and human strength. A serious step towards something actually reliable, wouldn't be surprised to hear of the US military having explored something similar (though they do have working fast-repel devices that the public is fully aware of, it's just not really used). Maybe next you could try to upscale the anchors to use enough explosive to hook into concrete walls!
What if you make an electric whip?
Cap shield
next time can you test if you could jump off something and then swing. like when spderman jumps off buildings and then shoots his web
At this point he made Attack On Titan maneuver gear, he should try that next.
PLEASE MAKE A HIDDEN BLADE AND SHARE THE 3D PRINT
ok now go out and fight crime!
Do batman
He made a web shooter he might as well make the odm gear from attack in titan
How do you get it back down?
GRAPPLING HOOK!!  6:45 idea you should make a motor that pulls you up the strand to you can climb easily
plz make a light saber which looks really looks like a lightsaber
Cool stuff. Makes me want to see a comic where an industrious kid is inspired by Spider-Man and basically just does this in the Spidey universe.
If anyone is Peter Parker, its this guy.
If anyone is Peter Parker, its this guy.
plz make a light saber
That’s the most Spider-man gadget I’ve ever seen. I want it, a cabin and 24hrs alone lol. #Spideysquad
Iron man hulk buster suit
This guy has 3.3 million subs, but he wo;nt pay someone to make his thumbnails XD
This guy literally makes the impossible seeming possible
can you make a video where you have web shooters on both hands and swing from one web, release and start swinging from another web before you land?
Have you tried adding PEG and a cross linking agent like divinylbenze in your solution? Maybe polyvinyl alcohol and PMMA as well to increase tensile strength?
Make a shooter that shoots a ring of string like a lasso then tightens itself when it catches something
you should make a trip chain that hooks around someones legs to trip them
ok...started on spidey and discovered batman❤
You could use the net strands ro make batman's grappling hook
I’d love to see you make two of them and try to swing twice in a row! Bonus points if you can create a reload system to go for a third
Swing into a wall grab and ill make a petition to replace tom holland with you lol
For those bigger webs, I've had the idea that you could have one type of shooter that you use to swing or pull things (a single strand), and then a bigger sort of web that would be used to web people up, releasing entirely from the shooter. You could likely achieve something like that with your current design.
Bro is slowly becoming a villain
Another serious year of this tech and thinking could bring about the technology of spider man... I'm absolutely rooting for this to be a success
make a hook that blows stuff up when u stab it
This is Spanish ya de tantas cosas crea un aparato para mover cosas con la mente
That nile red reference though
How did you make the mechanism that brings the “web” back to the gauntlet?
Sir, you’ve made one half of the Omni-Directional Gear from Attack On Titan. Please respond.
How long will the mini web shooters be out for? I really want one for my birthday but it is in June, when will it be gone?
Make something that lets you jump higher for Spider-Mans good jump
this can be used as a web shooter or a gun
Yo he is bad-A man. That's so freaking cool.
Would you be able to make the sword lightsaber thing fro the Adam project? Thank and great job!!
My guy this close to becoming a superhero
SAMTABOR
Man your a genius so cool
"Making odd things that shoot is kinda my specialty''- Jlaservideo
hearing nilered was crazy to me💀 like i turned my head to my computer screen completely
try it on glass
Stan Lee would randomly pop in the video and say something uplifting if he was still with us... He'd be very proud!
i want springlock suits next lol
Make another shooter so you can do 2 swings But seriuosly awsome man
No one is gonna mention the Nile Red cameo
make 2
What about anti gravity
I feel like fire fighters could use this. Kids on the second story of  building, just shoot upwards and release. If the kid is too far from you, just shoot at the kid and real them in. Maybe if you had one per arm. The industrial on left, and the sticky/ magnetic one on right.
If you could do the same thing using an electromagnet. You could fire while it's on, stick to metal, switch it off as the other sticks with the charge flipping from one to the other. Problem is energy and safety and very quickly retract the 1st line back to firing status to be used again. Just some ramblings...
SCIENCE!
Next time be super man
Make either another glove or multiple ammo on 1 glove and do double swing
Make the whips off of iron man 2
He took my dreams and made it real
Uh dude can you please apply this to use as a Batman grapple gun?
Customer: "hey do you have spiderman?" Seller: "no we have arachnid person"   His intelligence is bigger than my grades
W
so we are all just gonna ignore the fact he turned into NileRed for a second 💀
Do the spiderman web shooter with different mode like electro web or split web
Bro has a homemade grappling hook
It's more of a grappling hook
awesome vid Mr. laser! also just bought the web shooter! cant wait for it to arrive!
He’s gonna shoot for Spiderman and accidentally end up creating an iron man suit
anyone else catch the Nile Red reference at 2:16
Need more views for a great vid
I have a really and I mean REALLY expensive idea. When you finish get a professional gymnast to where a Spidey suit and videographer to record a skit of them doing spiderman tricks and at the end of the video show who Spidey is. Please let JL see this by liking or something like that. Edit: And yes I was the first like on this comment.
im not very smart so maybe ita not possible but if you got faster motors to wind the string you could actually swing pretty efficiently
How do you add different accessories like that rope?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
You did it spidey! With only $3000 in damage.. LOL 😂 😆😅
cool but you need 2. one on each arm then swing 1 to the other. and if possible, 2 charges with each, so u can go swing, swtich, x2
Yo just make ‘‘em so spidey doesn’t damage property while swinging!
amazing!
i tthink you should make a thors hammer
I’m impressed
NOOOOO! THE WEBSHOOTER IS ALREADY OUT OF STOCK! 😭😫
you have to figure out how to web people up now
Dude ... Impressive, best Spiderman tool I've seen until this day 😯😲😮😳
Make a better spider sense then Hacksmith!
Let me know when it’s $20 sold!
Don't know if I would call a nail "sticking" over impailing. How would this fare in a downtown on window covered skyscrapers? 🤣
now you just gotta find a way to get more rope inside of there
Suspension/Safety harnesses scare the heck out of me after I learned of the blood 🩸 clot dangers
Maybe make a thing that could basically just make something appear out of nowhere but it is still solid
Maybe a type of metal laced with an adhesive that like sticks when heats up and un sticks when cooled like some sort of temperature changer or it CD an stick once cold and unstick when heated just to put in it out there
i heard nile red in that chemistry section 😅
This is the scariest video I've seen on youtube. A gun that shoots powder actuated hammers is absolutely horrifying. I don't understand how you have the confidence to use this, but it's awesome.
I wish I could this smart
now get two, stop crime and save the city/friendly neighborhood   also where can i buy one
You should make modocks suite or shank si rings
credit 2 nile red (yw)
You look awesome with just one web shooter I can only how sick you would've been if you had a second one. you would've been the real spiderman
Haha I remember trying to make my own web shooters out of glue and lighters when you dropped those early videos, and even now I'm still geeking out lol Awesome video man!!
you should make 2 try to swing for from another
2:16 NileRed mf
Mister JLaser. Becoming spider man is hard. Do you know what’s harder? Your dedication! ❤ you rock!!!
Now all you need is some function refining and martial arts training and we can finally have real life spidey
You might want to try it with gecko tape next ;-)
When are you doing the next version  of falcon wings
Dude,  I used to love your cheeky sorta "fake it till you make it" style. But you are no longer faking it. Every project these days is fire 🔥 You are even starting to combine gadgets 🎉 you are epic
Bro next time fucking go climb a construction site and swing from one wall to the other
Could you try to make a pop up ant man suit?
Sheesh
Welcome to jlazer vs ramset
Cool I’m gonna go around trapping the people who do me wrong in webs
This is the smartest guy who can get it done. He has money and he knows how he can use it.
Pleeeease make another one for the other arm so you could get 2 swings in!
This is Batman if he liked spidey’s tech
You should make a working ghostface voice changer
You should see about adding like a mechanism that will hold ur weight for u like an exoskeleton on ur arm
You could swing 2 times whith one jump if you had two of those. Would be sick
Everyone should comment to help this blow up!
Can I have it for free PleaseRed shoulder spider-man dress
Awesome 👍
@nilered at 2:26
The Military has logged on and want to know your location
Wow, dude is literally doing it, unreal
Anything invisible
Cool
Make a second one and you can swing with two
I ordered one of those web shooters that he sells off of his website. That was three days ago. I haven’t gotten any updates. It literally has not changed since I ordered it and I gave him 80 of my dollars so that I can get it to him on my son’s birthday. I understand that running a business is hard because I have someone in my family that owns one and I work with them but the least you could do is like give an explanation.
This guy is the closest to a real life spiderman, and the Hacksmith is like a real life iron man❤
Now you just need to get bit by that radioactive spider
This might legitimately be useful with cave navigating lol
Crazy video
Damn you guys are awesome! Been watching your earlier vids for inspiration!
bro is genuinley bout to become spiderman
nine
It’s all fun and games until Spidey uses his .22 blank nail gun to stop criminals instead of the net
No way the Nile red moment
Look I’m a pro bare knuckle boxer you guys make awesome stuff let’s come together and make a real life super hero! 🤷‍♂️ just saying! There’s real villains but no super hero’s
bro became spider man
3:57
Make a real Thor hammer that can come back to you
I was watching a video about super hero gadgets and they said a millionaire made doctor octopus arms then i found your videos and you made it better than the millionaire
You should make Kamay Kamay haaa from dragon ball z
Please, please, please equip two shooters and try multiple swings from one dismount!
Bro became a Nile red for a minute
now you need two!
Are you still working on the metal falcon wings that can glide?
ügyes vagy
You should use that mind control stuff from the doctor octopus video to make something super cool
In its current state, the device reminds me of Batman’s wrist mounted grappling gun from The Batman!
Daam I really wanted to buy this it's sold out already 🫤
This guy out here trying to be Spider-Man when in reality he’s Batman 😂😂😂
Look how far spider tech has come! I remember trying to stick to walls with plunders as a kid and buying  one of those toy web shooters (the walls were a mess). Keep pushing to become a real Spider-Man!
to make getting those barbs out easier, maybe you could try a similar tactic to how you got them in, but instead of driving a nail into the wall or ceiling, you drive up a blunt bumper attached to the canister that pries it out.
Mans really did the Nile red impression at 2:30
Very veryyyyy hopeful thinking but maybe you could possibly make a Ghost rider bike? When you whistle it drives itself to you?
This is fucking crazy lmao
Closer and closer to become Batnan!
in a few years this man will reach the spidey at 100%
To think, I didn't have to search for this. My yt algorithm is that great. Now, I have been watching '67 Spiderman, and that probably helped me to be able to watch this.
Collab with the guy who’s learning to web swing fit his master’s thesis
how did he get the hammer thing down
Ok now what if you shoot somebody with it...
This is amazing... Now build two and go hand to hand!
The best part is he tell us what he uses so we could do it ourselfd
This man is gonna make a real hulk buster irl
When is the spider man shooter gonna be back in stock?
Batman but ur maining grapple
Now we just need to make the web shooters not deadly
Can u put the Spider-Man suction cups with the web shooters u made in this video
Nice nile red reference 2:25
This man is Peter Parker
Don't give up
you should make the dragon scale staff from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
No body notice the Nile red refrence
This is so badass! 😂🔥
What is those chemical  called
You should make scorpions giant tail that's squirts out poison obviously not real poison lol
This can also be used like Mortal kombats Scorpion hook.
Gretchen Video... a second one on the other hand and you can swing around. Really great
Marvel needs this for a new movie or something. Great work!
A under-rated concept of the webshooters is that the web has to travel hundreds of feet in less than a second to be practical. Imagine getting hit in the face with some web from point range. It'll be like a shovel to the face. Or a bullet. Then the surface you connect to has to be strong enough to support the weight you apply.
I NEED THIS
Spiderman can be in real life
now make another one for the other hand and try getting 2 swings in a row
you should put everything together and make full spider man gear
Bro might be the rl spiderman , I hope this comment age well...
You have no clue how happy this makes me; thank you for sharing!!
The nile red ref tho 🤣🤣🤣
Grapple gun
Grappling hook
Can you try making a springlock suit?
Genuinely crazy how far you’ve come. Will definitely be remembered for crazy progression and tech
Why is nobody talking about how he fully turned into Nile red for a minute there
Yo anyone know the cost of shipping to the UK?
You should try to swing into a wall and climb it with the wall climbers
if you add strong anouth pistons to it and make it push itself of you can make it ungrab hope you see this
What do you think about the material called artificial gecko skin?
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
If this was called Batman grappling gadget this would be even more mind blowing
nile red?
Mjolnir that comes back
Fun fact. The reason why we would never be able to swing like spidey is cuz of how our(humans) blood travels compared to spiders. Spiders can control where more blood should be sent to. So lets say you swing. All the blood would travel to your legs causing you to black out if u swing like spidey. But have the blood control like spiders. Then you're all set. Or swing slower and not as much.   A gud example can be. Take your arm and just swing it in a vertical motion from the shoulder and you will see your hand being more red.
This kid is going places..!
You should make two of them and if you do two of them you rlly become spider man
2:25 I love how Nile makes a cameo
thats sick!! now you need both hands with a release and reload mechanism
I swear I heard NileRed but maybe I’m tripping
This dude is the definition of the only limit is your imagination.
Yo Jake Laser let’s go!
Now you need 1 on each arm. So you can swing and release all at the same time as you shoot the web from the other arm.  Dude if you can pull that off you are really the closest to Spiderman anyone has ever got .  Please 🙏 make a video with u having one on each arm. So you can swing and as ur about to release shoot the other one then swing from that one.  Dude that would be epic. And ur already half way ther.  U have to do it at this point 😂
I’m so happy you made the nylon rope I’ve been trying to get some
Will I be able to buy the web shooter in Europe in the future? Looks like an amazing gadget!
2:25 was that nilered speaking?
THIS IS AMAZING WHAT IM GONNA GIVE YOU A IDEA so basically you could have a motor to pull you up like say you attach to the roof and your going up like the real spider man
Amazing as always haha keep doing you
I dead heard that one science guy on tik tok was n this video
Trying to order one but there’s no option for UK shipping?
That is so cool!
YouTube's finest
if only you had 2, for 2 hands, you'd do a combo !
Is that nile red/blue that i heard at 2:25
I’d really like to see real web fluid shooting
No delivery to EU? :( Web Shooter is amazing!
cool !!❤
this has to, this NEEDS to blow up I cannot even begin to comprehend how cool what this guy does is
2:15 copycat lol
Now please please please get this on the other arm to. I wanna see you swinging from one to another
The 4th SpiderMan cant wait for the 3rd part
2:25 not the @nilered voice 🤦‍♂️
Someone needs to get him into the next spiderman movie as our realities version of spiderman. He can complain that he had to invent everything himself without powers and with limitations of physics in our universe (no movie physics).
So cool. The swinging and climbing together is awesome. I would totally buy the net web shooters
Can anyone help with what to do if the string in the web shooter he sells gets tangled?
I love this man 😅 Also how come no one is mentioning NileRed's voice at 2:24
16:52 was epic
bro you should make a john wick’s bulletproof jacket
Hey jake i would like to give you an idea to make transformable watch using developable mechanism like in the following link Link:https://youtu.be/w-sn2ruLq8k
This is also the closest to a compact and functional Batman grapnel gun! Other ones have tended to be the size of grenade launchers 🤣. Next vid should be building a second one and trying to get two swings in tandem!
A REAL LIFE SPIDER MAN SHOW
The child-like joy I get from seeing someone actually shoot the web and swing from a wall is insane
You nailed it.....
Bro’s built like Spider-Man, and has the brains for it, if we ever have the technology for Spider-Man to exist, I vote for this guy to become him ✋
The contraption looks and acts almost like the one in the Japanese live action Spider-Man
Collab with hacksmith maybe
Why not just take a lot of spiders and keep them somewhere and wait until they make a lot of spider webs and then take it and hang from it
Now you just got to jump off something and swing
Hi jlaser I am your big fan and I always wanted to be spider man I cant afford the money to buy the web shooter and I get a free one ??????
You can make batman gadgets
cool
Man's becoming an avenger
Bros about to make so much money off this
Imma buy a web shooter
All I gotta do now is figure out how to swing off more then two by making a reverse pully thing like the toy
Damn your definitely getting close to becoming spider man
13:20 in Spider-Man 1 after Peter threw his lunch at Flash
Now make another one
Started with Spiderman, ended as Batman. Pretty cool gadget
I would say this is closer to Batmans grappling hook launcher
that's beautiful 💙🥺
do you think you could make suit that has like, motion cameras and can blend your clothing into the background of whatever your standing in front of so you have the ultimate camo? Is that even possible? Like use light bending fabric or something idk.
Is he a mechanical engineer background?
This is absolutely incredible!!! This is one of your coolest inventions yet, I can’t wait to see what you make next! And I can wait to see what you do with this project next, keep up the great work!
FANTASTIC VIDEO it was amazing but Any idea on how far back are the back orders on the web shooters are
On the second try of shooting the rav 4, you can see like 6 other holes in the tire carrier 😂.
3:43 Gwen wasn't hurt with that web
2:25 Where did Nile Red come from? 😭😭
now you need to get tom holland to test it out
with the self tightening suit you are the spiderman
This the best one!! Bro getting really close to being spider man 😂
Put another on the other hand lol and transfer to that hand
Nah nah nah we ain’t gon pass by that I heard nilred
do it as you jump into a foam pit or something it would be so cool!!!! love you videos!! keep up the good work
now no both hands and stick swing release stick swing release
Meanwhile this man living the dream of all spidy fans out there
next idea - microbots from big hero 6
Goosebumps… Amazing!
He should jump then shoot  Nah man am kidding
You should give it to police to give them a non-lethal way to capture a runner!
11:48 NAHH, THIS IS NOW THE DOOMSLAYER'S SUPER SHOTGUN MOD LMAO
Man with a second one you can even get another swing at the end of your first one.
Get this shi in prison
what if every youtuber who worked on spiderman gadget teamed up and make the ultimate spiderman setup? Just saying.
how
Do u think u could make Batman’s grappling gun??
That insane
Like the thumb nail shows you soitting a web, which you aren't doing.
It actually stick!!! To a pallet i need in place.... it doesn't "stick", it impales... like.... can you do it without wood? This is literally just a wrist mounted graple gun. So you are more like batman than spider-man. Still cool, but i feel like this are kind of click bait.
I think you could also could possibly shoot it into the top of a wall and use it to climb up with the motor and your legs against the wall. Like rappelling but up
I hope you realize how awesome that web shooter design you have for sale is. I could totally see these blowing off the shelves if you could somehow make them and sell them to the masses
The funniest part about this video to me, is that J is literally slowly assembling an entire suit of gadgets. He's legit building a super hero suit over here. I'd love to see a video where you combine a whole bunch of your gadgets into one suit.
Honestly I know spider man it’s science fiction and the webs and stuff, but with enough research and study, who knows if they manage to combine the spider DNA with the human being DNA.
now another arm
Imagine if he had one on each hand he could legit clear that entire warehouse without touching the ground. Great stuff man
It's more like a batman grappling hook at this point. But it's still really cool.
That NileRed homage *Chef's Kiss
I love that this guy is almost ready to start his superhero career.
I don’t remember Spider-Man impaling his enemies with a needle charge lol
Duuuuuuuude!!! This is BEST Spiderman gadget ever made! And you showed up the Mythbusters to boot!  Heck yeah man! Let's blow this video up!
I believe in the original sixties run of spiderman he used like a mix of concrete and adhesive on the tips of each web to give it the tensile strength
Next  Mr beast video video: “I hired Spider-Man to fight crime!”
This thumbnail does look better than the other one
Is it possible to make it from actually from webs Instead of string but using the same model using the formula from homecoming just because it actually shows it but if you can make the right adhesive but you might need a chemist to help but it is possible but is just a lot of work maybe worth a video because webs is more accurate than string or rope
the random Nigel voice fucked with my head for a second there
Stan Lee would be so proud
Awesome
Can You please buy me One Wheel?
that you can ride on
Bro you forgot to make a second one for the other hand  so that you could actually swing like spider man
hey could you make a hovering harry potter broom?
I know this is supposed to be a Spider-Man web shooter but this really feels like Batman’s grappling gun
NOW MAKE IT SO THAT YOU SHOOT THE WEB, SWING, RELEASE AND SHOOT ANOTHER WEB 😈😈
BRO Impressed!!!!
my 10 year old self loves this
Idea: now make one for the other arm so you can like double web maybe not infinite time swinging but atleast two times
Nile red????
Have you ever wonder: what if you put every single spiderman scientist people and put it in one room where mrbeast can pay for every single things they need to make an ACTUALL spiderman web…
i swear how do you even top this?? like whats next a fully functional iron man suit?
If Hacksmith is the real Tony Stark, then you've gotta be the real Peter Parker. May not have all the gigantic machinery, but you still get the job done
Sehr nice 👌
This is amazing but is it just me or would this idea work better with Batman’s bat claw
Finally
Basically made the harness from Attack on Titan
I love your videos but those web shooters have been out for years ypu just slapped your logo
Love the Nile Red reference at 2:15
Isn’t this a firearm
I need one of those those
Make a ka meha meha
You should make a luffy arm that can extends
We are getting closer and closer to being able to be Spider-Man irl and im loving it, maybe another 4 years but HEY!, we are getting the technology
You should make a second one and try to do a double swing
Wrong suit. Should have been Batman. 🤷‍♂️
Now imagine another one on second hand shooting it and then relesing first one, and then sticking to the wall
So, it fully holds your weight and reels you in....you have officially made Batman's grapple gun.....
You should make Gambit throwing cards based on Remy LeBeau, the X man(they blow up if you did not know)
That reminds me of attack on titans I love this😂❤❤❤❤
Now make another and swing two times
Add one to the other hand and we have continuous swinging
Does the web shooter come with goo?
ANyone gonna talk about Nile Red? LOL
😮😮
This is beautiful, dreams do come true!
Batman type glider  It's not easy, seems feasible and hopefully, fun😅
The Waffle House Has Spoken
This shooter could easily work for Batman!
Nailed that Nile Red impression 😂
Man I have a saying. We have how many billionaires in this world and not one of em is trying to be a super hero... this guy though. Hes trying to actually do something fun and cool!
should get one on your other hand and try for a double swing
This is like watching a supervillain in the making while he develops his technology and tools. Haha
And be able to make you a real life ghost rider
make dumby from iron man
Can you make a real life working flaming skull doesn't have to be a real skull but it does have to look real
Secret cameo with nile red
make an edge of tomorrow suit ( im asking from many months)
His fish were just like "WHAT IS HAPPENING!"
With the waist-mounted spool it's almost reminiscent of Attack on Titan
Just wait. He'll make an actual webshooter, but then he'll never be seen from again. Or at least that device.
HE'S GETTING STRONGER
Yesss. Another JLazer Video.
With great power,
People haven’t tried to do the simplest option… create a toxic spider to bite someone
It’s amazing how this thing starts from a shooting lighter. I salute your wits, willpower and consistency to make these creation became a reality!!!
Amazing
Was that a NileRed impression? LOL
It's weird and Not practical so 🥹😒😒
seeing you dress as spideman, create a web shooter, and then move a car with it. you're past your origin and into your year one sir. can't wait for the climax.
Those are not Spiderman's web-shooters... They are ODM gear from Attack on Titan... Shinzo wo sasageyo❤️🔥✊🏻
Should definitely make an entire spidey suit with two less bulky web shooters, and a more integrated design for the wall climbers.
Damn he killed this. I gotta work with him one day
you should put all of your spider man inventions to gather to make the ultimate spider suit
All he needs is a protective but light suit
Make a sonic screwdriver
Could you create a teleportation device
Make simple laser gun
Ok wow...just wow.
Every one here  Who agrees he should make a nuke
Can’t wait for this guy to make a pocket nuclear reactor
How long are they going to be for sell? I have been watching your Chanel for almost 2 years. I am very happy that you are doing this, even if it is just for limited time.
He became nilered 2:14
I think for the next project that you guys should work on the iron man suit, i know you have already made one but i think it would be cool if you could make it better and maybe add a weapon.
This could work very well as an attack on titan kit
Imagine the real word applications for this. The Military would dump millions into something like this if it were more reliable.
This man is about to make odm gear
please make a hulkbuster
Your imitation of Nile Red was on point try mark rober next time!
BRO IS THE BEST ENGINEER IN THE WORLD
DAMMMNNNNN THATS SO COOL AMAZING
That's a dream come true for so many people. Keep up the great work, can't wait to see how you progress!
Dream life this guy is living
You basically made odm gear swinger form Attack on Titan😭
Hope he understands though the first time he swings forreal forreal when he nails this with actual web that swing will dislocate his shoulder. Rooting for him though cause I’m a buy one lmao.
im glad to say im following the whole process since the beginning
Just put the same thing on the left arm too now so you can practice going from one swing straight into another!! Awesome video!
Stan Lee would be proud
Try Batman's Gadgets such as grapple gun
you could use that automatic hammer thing to make scorpions spear from mortal kombat
This is so cool!
marvel hire this man
bro is slowly turning into actual spiderman every year
Make a harry potter wand
You don't ship to Australia :(
WOW MAN BECAME THE MOST REALISTIC SPIDER MAN IRL
6:40 straight up created the nicholas Hammond webshooter without even knowing it
This is great congratulations  NOW DO IT IN FOREST!!
It’s almost like a nail taser
2:26 Nile Red?????
He tried to be Spiderman, turene into Rico Rodriguez
The NileRed audio 💀
This is amazing
The big question is who hero will be finished first spiderman or ironman
Looks more Batman. Than Spider-man. Like Batmans grappling gun. Awesome😊
This is amazing, I believe you could do the ODM gear from attack on titan with this concept. Hope you do the ODM gear, respect 🤜🤛
im still waiting on the spring ring
I'm not an engineer,but while I was looking at the thing that cuts the rope it's big,so what if you put a super sharp small knife in the finger part of the suit or like what's in Spider-Man *(Tobey Maguire)* finger,those little spider legs that grew while he's practicing to climb..
Bro you can use this as a starting design to eventually build a real life Batman batclaw
now days AI technologies are in trend how about Doraemon
Send me the plans of that thing. Please...
Can you make the drone from spider man this one on his suit pls?
Did I hear a Nile Red?
Bro casually made ODM gear
Your local hardware man has come to save you!
I hope there were no fish in that tank
i want the big one
It whould be rad if u can make a robot taco that craps ice cream
Ok but the thumbnail 💀
2:16 bro I was literally just thinking ‘huh he sounds like Nilered’ and then he literally made a reference
Make a spidey sense suit and pair it with the climbers and these web shooters
This proofs that Supaidaman is the most realistic portrayal so far
Could this also be a Batman grappler???
you should totally do a second episode where you have one on each arm and make a course for you to swing through with the aim of not touching the ground. It would be great practice!
ah, working progress.  can't make the formula that peter parker made mmm, as the webs are synthetic than organic to most comics
2:25 Nile red voice 🧐
He is the hero we need
you should make a short film by combining the wall climbers and the web shooter.
Now sell this concept to the military for major profit
You should make a glove that can float things like telekinesis pls
This honestly reminds me of the grapple hook from Just Cause 3
What if you used magnets to sort of wrap around a bar/branch? Then you could work around the issue of the magnets not sticking to something strong enough, as they would be sticking to other powerful magnets. Then you could use electromagnets so you could detach the magnets and swing off?
Where is part two of the falcon wings
Why don't you try batman rope gun 🔫 . Which loads him up during any fight .
So cool! But does anyone else think it’s more like Batmans grapple gun haha
I know it's spiderman. But it feels closer to Just Cause Grappling hook, though minus more functions. Love it keep up the great work ❤
the impact hammer set up reminds me more of the 3DMG (maneuver gear) from Attack on Titan rather than Spider-Man. I feel like by going for that setup you can justify adding more overt technological stuff compared to peter parker's supertech miniaturized web shooters
thats not legal for sure
2:34 bro turned into Nike red for a second😂
U gotta pair up with another person well known to try these things and work together because then I bet you could truly make a refined spider man suit and as technology grow s it will be less a less bulky and more like the suit in the movies
Having one on each hand, swinging twice and for the cherry on top, doing it from the wall would would be dope 👀
this video made me respect u . u have achieved the dream of every person
yo can you do an exoseletonish suit
I can't wait for the day he'll be swinging through my neighborhood saving people
The thing is that scientist matematician physician and all could spent time ont hing like that but and actually make a genuine thing,but since theyre busy yk making sur epur building dont colapse making sure that we get proper vaccine and all(which i am glad they are since its more important than web shooter) well theres the yt who spend time on those and actually get close to it.which is incredible 😊
Mad Respect
After all that the point is portable and small
bro u turned into blue nieal the guy who does since stuff
Wow
I love this   AND IT IS ONLY $40
He should test if it can stick to concrete since that’s what spider man swings from a lot
Please falcon wings
8:44 this reminds more of Star Wars Episode 1. The Grappling sticks that Padme Amedala and her team are using to skip some floors near the end of the movie.
Long time no seen
This man is legitimately getting so close to becoming the first real Spider-Man
9:19 "That worked pretty good."  "Really well"  Felt like he was simply correcting your grammar.
Next video: a hammer that shoots lightning
Whole Spiderman thing pretty much have been done already by Hacksmith few years ago
Wow. I’m sad I missed it by a few days but… wow is all I got I’m legit speechless
love to see how you solved the thing with the one that already exist in everyday tools
How about a real life netherite sword that has real fire aspect
Someone needs to get Tom Holland on this
Liked where you were going with the glue and nylon. Then you kinda went from Spider-Man to Scorpion
I was wondering could we use nulear physics to do something like this. In theory this might be possible though. As faras I've studied, I'll be glad to do my own research
2:24 Nice insert there
I notice that mixing liquid latex with a low ph liquid, typically vinegar, it hardest super quick. It isnt sticky, but its probably feasible to create a webshooter from them
I just thaught id say that after the last vid he did i went and git marvel snap and its awsome! Wouod recommend big time
Put one on each arm so you can swing from rope to rope.
need a hack smith collab
You should make a working black manta helmet
U Sud try to make 2 and swing from a 2 story to a 2 story
So sad this can’t ship to Canada :(
Eh.
What if you use slime as web...???
we need actual webs not a weaponized grappling gun 😭😭😭
It's kind of funny how you ended up with something that even though it works like spider man's webs, functions way more like Shingeki no Kyojin's 3DMG Awesome!
Where flex glue bro
spider man!!! That is more like batman good try though
Did anyone notice Nile reds voice?  2:25
spider-man or AOT?
This is awesome. Now you just need a second one. If you could alternate hands and start swinging from a second line before letting go of the first, you'd really be spiderman. It would be so awesome to see you climb one wall, swing across the warehouse then stick to the other wall.
More like Batman tho😂❤still loved it❤
I defenitely want to buy the bounce frisbee
What I’m out of America 😢
training arc
Hey I heard Nile in there 👀
that ain't Spider-Man, that's Arachnid-Boy lol. jokes aside this is amazing.  A way to potentially improve this, engineer the same system as the wall climbers and shrink it down, put it on a ball joint or something so that it has free swinging potential, dunno how tech really works but you are smart, you may be able to try and figure out how to do this.
Jake is Peter Parker IRL
Nah bro became nilered 2:24
he's literally developing budget superpowers and nobody is going crazy about it
Loving the Nile red audio track❤😂
He did it again, I thought the venom suit was impossible, I thought sticking to a wall was impossible, now he can swing, this dude is Spider-Man
You can maybe make a batman grapple with this?
Immediately bought 2 of them, thank you for making my dreams come true
Impressive 😮
But it's a DC's item, not Marvel's
I would wanna be bros neighbour😂
Could possibly use the same device for a "grenade" launcher seeing as how its effectively launching galvanized pipes
Why don't you build sever suffer skateboard that fly on air
Nile red easter egg🤣
J Jonah Jamason gonna be real angry at all the holes spiderman's leaving around the city.
That is the coolest thing ive seen oh my god please keep making things!
DARPA would like a word...
Really great work! I really hope the next phase is a second shooter so you can learn to shoot a second rope mid swing. Honestly if you fluently can go from one swing into the second that's going to be it. You're Spider-Man to me.
bro made odm gear
Wait.. That was it???
At 2:15 i thought i was watching nilered for a second
Did anyone hear nilered
"JLazer built it in a garage! With a bunch of scraps!"
I think Jake gave spider man a run for his money
This would make for an incredible R rated Spiderman spoof lmao. Instead of shooting webs, you kill people with the nail.
Try adding feathers or wings on the back to make it more stable and hopefully accurate
this is like a hand held version of the aot odm gear
I heard styropyro?
A gas powered mechanism that shoots hard enough to stick to walls and supports the human body weight AND lets them detach, reel in, and swing? I see AOT in the future
Starts to sound like NileRed* followed by the NileRed's voiceover 💀😂😂
Exceeded expectations again. Ive been waiting my whole life for this. Ive spent many hours searching and watching people created webshooters. This has to be the closest one I have seen to the actual movies. Great work!
Can you make shang chi 10 rings that can fly retractable and
Did anyone else catch the super subtle cameo @ 2:25?
Scientists proved that making web shooter are possible, we just need sum1 smart enough and has enough dedication to actually make sum
Bro turned into Nile red
17.30 Warehouse wall just says "dick."
Thats so sick
This is so sick!!
brainbots from megamind please!
thats is a real spy gadget......wow
why not do a batman grappling  gun
Attempting to be Spiderman, ended up being Batman.
2:18 Nile Red? edit: im a genius
No okay cool but now you need two of them
Bro just needs to tank 150+ feet falls and needs amazing fighting skills
Lotta web slingers out there, this one puts them all to shame!
add a more powerful motor and some computing and its really a spy gadget now
This is getting crazy close. Maybe if somehow in the future, chemists come up with a web-fluid like substance, then the thousands of property damage that your shooters would cause would go away. Like imagine hitting glass with that thing, not great.
13:20 This reminded of me of the 2002 spiderman movie 😢😢
The best way to test it is go to the nearest bad neighborhood or Downtown and Fight Crime as Spider-Man
I want to see a jump and mid air shoot web to swing !! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 REALLY GOOD JOB GUYS ! That looks like real super heros are just decades away from us
Respect for this one!  Well done.
I've always wondered if for some reason humanity was dedicated to making something in this case spider man webs would we be able to do it or is it 100% sci Fi and this makes me think we can cause if one man can do this in a year or two then I think we would have done it a long time ago
So to be a super hero you have to be rich af
What the heck, I heard Nile red when you were making the polymer
Halfway there to wrist shotguns
Do Attack on Titan ODM gear
yoo u might make marvel great again because then they won’t have to use so much cgi because you’ve created practical swinging equipment. you’re awesome 👏🏾
Yo government can you keep an eye on this guy😂i mean surely he is on the good side but just few steps away from world domination 😂😂
Suggestion: make an exo-armor to make old people walk better
Brobin 3 years gonna become ultron 💀
at this point they actually gonna become the actual spider-man!
Dude is bringing superheros in real life
These guys just did something professional engineers can’t do lol
I wish Adam Savage could see this
Please create a Spider sense mechanism
Bro Is getting closer to starting his own avengers squad to stop crime 😂
A lot of the time, I see this and it's laughably bullshit.  But this is GOING PLACES!  Actually being able to wall climb, swing to another wall has incredible applications.  Now we just need that super strength exo suit to be as strong as spiderman ;D .
2:20 nilred fans be like😳
Dude I tried buying the webshooter but they dont deliver to canada
Idk if your gonna see this but you should try to make a titanfall pilot jumpkit to help you wall run
That looks like Attack on Titan ODM gear
Love it!
just bought a webshooter,when u restocking bc it says its backordered
Bro, if you ever become Spider-Man, u gotta let me be Miles
I think you become the real Spider-Man marvel characters shoes to you to become the spider-man
The voice change
Now you need to make it so you can swing with more webs, and have another shooter on the other hand
Next up I made a multi use working spider web shooter that allows me to swing forever
This is incredible! It would be super cool if you can make it so that you can have one on each arm so you can swing and then shoot another one mid swing to swing even further before coming down. Awesome project! Love to see the creations! 🔥🫡
I saw the Spider-Man glove thing like that on Amazon
imagine he tries to swing on to a building with glass
Seems like cop cars could use something like that. 🤔
So your telling me that you van both climb and swing. All really need now is to make it reloadable and put on a exo suit.
You should try to swing from one side of the upper story to the other
The Nile Red clip got me.
Web liquid with alcohol and thermacol
is that nile red
Nah dude thatsss crazzzyyy
Please make Thor's hammer that comes back,and add it to you store that would be awesome
This Is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. Keep up the great work. This is truly amazing.
Make it smaller and better , you may be the next spidy
This is insane. Definitely need one for each hand so you can continuously swing! That would be crazy!
NOW RECREATE WHEN PETER SHOT A WEB AT HIS LAMP AND PULLED IT
It would be cool if you made a web shooter mark 2 to sell that not only includes the normal web shooter but also the net launcher I would definitely buy it and I think others would to.
You sure? it seems like something batman would do 😅
sick
i like that little NileRed voice clip when you were pulling out the goo 😭😭
Coulld you make a tron disc for sale? literally cannot find that anywhere
It's a Batman Gadget
He should try making ODM gear
this is Awesome..!!! well done JLaser & crew... :)
Bro I’m planning on buying one but I wish I could get the one he used in the end 😢  Ps. My G is going to be real spooderman meanwhile I play spiderman ps4 on my PlayStation 😂
You look more like power rangers Peter Parker
if spiderman fired a .22 everytime he swung I would probably call him a menace and demand that Peter Parker bring me pictures of him
I kind of feel like you invented a grappling hook rather than a web shooter.
Bro is 2 years and a budget from being an actual super hero, literally insane
You might could add an instant release so you could get that seamless fly off the rope feeling
oh wow
the web is the wire? 😂 I wanna see that catastrophe
Ngl with how well this went, I feel like you could easily make ODM gear from AOT (idk if you’ve tried before)
2:25 thats the guy from tiktok? I cant remember his name he does like mixing chemicals and stuff!!
the nile red refrence was hysterical!!
I wouldn't be surprised if he tomorrow uploaded a video saying fully working Iron Man suit
this is my only motivation to pay attention in school
it would insane if you made another one and made it where there were multiple "webs" and you could time it right you could literally swing  from hand to hand just like spider-man please make a part 2 to this it would be so cool!
Now you just need a second one to continue the swinging
man the nail thing works better as batman’s batclaw
Love it. :) a grappling gun.
Jlaser in 2030: *mimicking spidermans powers and becoming spiderman*
more like bruce playing  spiderman
NileRed’s voice at the nylon part?
The next step is to figure out how to give people superpowers
Imagine the fish tank shattering 😂
He looked like Spooder man 😂
Have 2 webshooters and do 2 consecutive swings
It's is crazy how good this works. JLaser is the closest thing to spiderman we have <3  P.s I love seeing the end product but what I would love to see more is watching the journey along the way and the challenges you had to overcome, it makes it seem less caked in makeup if you can watch the progress to the final product in more detail, your engineering creativity skills are legendary, I'd just love to see more of it :)
I would love to try this, because I weigh so little it will actually be like im spiderman
I can seriously see tech like this be super helpful in Fire fighting and search and rescue work! Fantastic work dude, it so cool to see how for you have goten
SPRING RING!!!!
That is so dope
Bro solved fall damage 💀
The dude actually looks like he could play peter parker
OMG DO EDITH V4 USING CHAT GPT!!!!
Broooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cool reference to nilered
The first gen reminds me of the goonies
Flying iron man
We need an artificial geckskin version now!
I just want to say what a cool things you have built, but I just want to added in order to add more accuracy you should make the tube in spiral just like in the gun barrel, that's all my suggestions
I mean, with the motor and spool you basically made your own grappling hook lmao
it seems like he likes to create spider man stuff. He should try to make superman's laser vision next
this reminded me more of the attack on titan grappling hooks than the spiderman web shooter
Doing the dreams of every child growing up with Spiderman! That's actually amazing!!
Next do running fast like flash in real iife
One day we’re gonna have robots that have excerption
bro imagine in testing if it went over his neighbors fence
That amazing
Have you tried looking into artificial gecko skin as the substance use to stick?
I don’t know if you’ve done this yet but if you can make a helmet or suit with motion detecting software then you’d have spider sense. I think that would officially make you Spider-Man
id really like one of those web shooters on the website but i live in the uk, is there a way i can get one? ill pay for shipping and extra
That nile red reference there lmao 2:24
All you need to do is make another one and you can swing from one web to another
bro turned into Nile Red for a second 😆😆🤣
Even if this doesn't lead to IRL Spider-Man capabilities, the real world applications for something like this (e.g., LE/Military/Emergency service/etc.) could be a game changer.
I have an idea.Have you watched Murder Drones?(If you haven’t you should watch it)You should make the murder drones acid tales
So all he has to do is shrink the technology while still keeping the same power
Is the Spider-Man web shooter still available
am I the only person thinking about militarizing this... no just me
dude you made attack on titan's special corps gear without even attempting to
Dude I ordered that web shooter instantly ☠️
this guy is the closest one to a real life spiderman , pretty cool tho
Superheros will be real one day
I love the Michael Reeves style edit
all thats left is one more and swing more than once
Here before this has millions of views
World: When you got a name like Jake Laser you gotta make good with that. Him:
i love how in the aim for a spiderman esque gadget, he has made actual batman level equipment  ofcourse unfortunately the goal is spiderman swinging, but just as a batman get away tool up an elevator shaft this is insane
1. 9:00 the .22 system sounds like it would be used for sci-fi grappling hooks, *and honestly it looks cool xd* 2. 11:00 if you can modify the “jackhammer”, you could also put some kind of “hook” or “ring” there so the rope stays
2:25 WHAT is that voice
Jizz shooter
Waw I remember those lighter videos
This is insane. Imagine if he made one for his other arm and managed to pair 2 swings together
I think we all know tge best superhero name for this guy  The Avenger
We just gonna skip over him benching 315????
Finally after 8 billion years
Maybe a more elastic rope/web. That way it absorbs the shock when you swing. Also a quicker release so you can swing off it smoothly. And yeah ik you already thought about both
I can't imagine how much time and work this took to make. This is awesome! The way it functions kinda resembles more of Batman's grappler than Spiderman's webs, but it'd be hard to do it any other way. Again, great work!
this idiot, now everyone knows spidermans secret identity
this is fucking insane keep it up you're the closest to Spider-Man anyone has ever gotten
Keep going with this dream. Your killing it
Hacksmith has nothing on this channel.
i'm not going to show for your own safety   sounds more like peter parker trying to hide his ways
how did bro do this before hacksmith lmao
and in the end it was even more instant-kill terrifying to think about hitting someone with that
This is super cool. Can you swing and catch urself on another wall with the wall climbers?
Bro really dropped the Nile red voice at 2:25
Little NileRed cameo?
Probably beyond any youtubers means but to help with the web strength, maybe if you used the polypropylene glycol solution that they used for body armor, where the polymer acts as a non Newtonian fluid and becomes super strong with sudden movement. so you could shoot it as a liquid, have it dry, then when ya swing from it it becomes stronger and then afterwards you could remove it gently.
I know that this is a duh statement, but if you make tow you could swing from one to another  lol
You should put the net on the other arm to take out goons.
I would love to be able to buy the spring frisbee
Up next: becoming strong enough to lift a bank
ive been waiting for this vid for years
Make spidey senses with a 360 camera and an alarm. Or use placed sensors around the suit.
What if you reskinned it as batman's grapple hook so it would look naturally bulky?
This is very cool, but it could be better if you made two, since you could swing again from a hanging position.
Does anyone know if the web shooter uses batteries?
That’s pretty cool 😎
could you make the web shooter available in eu plsplspls
The problem is this only works on wood I love the Chanel and the web slingers keep it up
I am surprised someone let you shoot holes in their roof.
grappling hook from batman
RESTOCK the webshooters please!!! They are awesome!
You should make Wolverine extendable claws
Out of all the people on YouTube who are trying to figure out how to make web swinging real- you are definitely gonna be the one to do it
2:24 nile red 😭
Dude, make attack on titan gear with this!
NARUTO!!!!!!
The reverse function on the electric reel look a bit awkward to get off, so maybe if you could make it freewheel at the end of the swing so you drop faster
2:31 had me dead
Now just put all the inventions of spiderman together and see how it goes  Edit: well I guess you did that 17:18 is what I was imagining
Ok NileRed we get it
That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life.
Why isn't Marvel contracting to develop toys!?!
want frisbee
All these gadgets are made from modern current supplies, now imagine this man as a multi billionaire
nilered reference lol
When you make something from Just cause but brand it as Spiderman because its more popular
hey man dont shoot da fish tank
2:00 genius sense of humor, love ya
better yet he can even defend himself by shooting a nail
I know this is a spider man video, but he very much reminds me of Bruce Wayne with all of his cool gadgets
i think it would be great if more effort was poured into the sticky nylon idea, maybe it's upgrade could be running some chemistry to make actual spider webs with their absurd strength
This guy is like the combination of both spider-man and Tony Stark, heck, he could at this point make up his own superhero with the gadgets he has made!
You should make shoes that reduce fall damage.
Or maybe you have 600 pounds of muscle and it was the right amount of metal needed
Bruh this is the exact same product listed in the description: https://youtu.be/tdy6Jk07evY
can you sell the kingsmen watches on your website? tried to recreate it for maximum coolness but didnt work. Also your smart glasses (edith and the kingsmen one) would be really cool.
The .22 cal nail gun is really fun to use. I usually get into trouble with my wife and kids when I start playing with mine while I'm supposed to be building something.
Hi jlaser, I need the black panther sound proof sneakers
thats more like the ODM gear from attack on titan than web shooter
Jlaser is the Man. The closest thing to a real life Peter Parker. You damn near discovered the real formula for spideys webbing.   Edit: Phantom 2040 uses magnet ropes like in the beginning.
wanted to get the webshooters on the web store..... doesn't ship outside the US...... very disappointed
It has built in insta kill mode lmao. Just aim and you have two harpoons in someone. Sick build
Could you try to make the EDITH glasses, the glasses were you can control drones
So he's basically shooting captive bolt pistols out of an aircannon.
You should make venom head that can retract maybe a voice changer
god i want a colab between you mark rober and the hacksmith
Give this to the spidey actors
I like the sudden voice change like Nile Red funny
2:25 anyone else notice him using Nile red's voice 😂😂
Make another One please
That was so cool man, next step is to figure out the antman shrinking power, that my friend is one very important superpawer and one of my favorite. You can use it to spy on the hot neighbor but without getting eating by her cat 😂. Great job guys
it kinda looks like an one handet double barrel shotgun
did actually made the web shooter that you sell yourself because I found similar web shooter like the one you sell.
Finally, you became a real life superhero! :]
Its so amazing to see the Evolution
This is amazing! Is there a way to make the release more efficient so that way you could swing off two web shooters? And is there a way to make the shooters smaller?
Is there any way to buy your webshooter in europe? Or will there be one in the future?
I Need the spring rings now
dude, could you use the veritasium gekko skin pads instaed of the nails? they seem to have a good grip
You should make a thor Hammer that actually comes back
need two!
The only thing that could make this more like the movies is to make another one for your other hand and somehow implement an automatic reload system...
I'm actually convinced he's the Spiderman of our multiverse
Idk. . . This seems more like modified ODM gear from Attack on Titan. . . But formal, this is amazing man!
can he be in the next Spiderman movie??
You need to make another one to swing and release but you just the other one to stick and swing again just like in the movies
you should bake thors hammer that comes back
For sticking to metal maybe locktite?
speaking of spring ring, when is it coming out.
I'd love to see him cornered in an alley and just use his inventions to get out
This is the fbi we would like you to be in charge of weapon creation
Your Videos is Amazing, You are the spiderman of the Life real. I love  your videos because I like your invents,I learn very things and Improve  My English skills. I follow you from Mexico
Keep it up, this was insane! If anyone can make a midair release and shoot model, it’s you.
Please make a FLOATING Modok suit
Well, what if it were to be shaped more like a dart and thinner allowing the nail to go longer distance and stay straighter, like tranquilizer darts except the gun is much smaller and strapped to your wrist? Then you can possibly DIY your own impact drill the size of a dart, if not maybe a tad larger and thicker due to the pressure.  Edit: After doing some research, there's actually such a thing as Impact Darts, though about $60+ per dart, that you can buy online which would greatly simplify the DIY process.
Now he has 50 holes in all his ceilings
what about nilered at min 2:27
When will the web shooters be available again ?
Like bat man (kinda)
You should make a utility belt with smoke bombs grapple hooks secret cam in your pants and a tiny black tracker to stick on things
This is good for military use in search and rescue
I know you probably won't respond Jlaser but when will it be off of back order please someone tell MEEEEEEEE
hey you iam replic mark 5, saze 10.
Amazing job Jake! I’ve been watching for a long time and it’s amazing to see how far you’ve come. You’ve inspired me so much! Thank you from everyone you’ve inspired to create awesome things.
I love these videossssss
you could replace the nail with a modified grooved bullet if you want to stick t things like concrete.
All to get that classical kiss 😉😚
Someone needs to send this to tested so Adam Savage can see it.
It’s less like Spider-Man and more like when the chameleon impersonated him. Still amazing
man was shoing off his racoon hat and he looks like tobey magirue 9:55
2:26 Nile 😭
you should make another one for the other hand so you can swing off of the original swing and cover twice the distance
Everyday this man gets closer and closer to becoming the real-life Spider-Man
How do you not have military contracts yet😂
What he build is kinda like the 3d maneuver gear from Attack on Titan
Can you make Dr Strange’s cloak? I have no idea how you would do it but that would be an awesome concept.
the ingenuity!!
He’s literally slowly becoming our universe spider-man in front our eyes 😱
This has been my dream for years. Thank you so much for making this!
this for all you anime fans try to make a working susano ribcage or ichigo's sword that shoots getsuga tensho or kamehameha or destructo disc or a stand from jojo's one of these in real life would be badass and nice video so cool now my dream as a kid will come true someday XD
Should make Donatello's expandable bo staff from the TMNT out of shadows movie.
bro you are a genius love your work
Don't know if this would actually be possible, but it would be cool to see a functional gliding batman cape, can't seem to find anyone who's made one yet
Can you sell  the web one from 6:14?
Ok this man is just gonna start making super hero’s just keep in mind he has made almost something for every thing people thought was impossible  Doc Oc Arms Flying iron man suit Captain America Shield Thor Hammer Green Giblin Glider
Make two and use then simultaneously
HONEY OUR NEIGHBORS ARE TRYING TO BE SPIDER MAN AGAIN
12:09 thats Andrew Garfield
both harvard and the military be calling u in the next week
Nile red  🤔👀
No one is talking about attack on Titan
its so cool seeing how much his content has improved over the years. This was nuts
Maybe you could try using artificial Gecko skin for the Wall-Climbers or Web-Shooters
Where can we buy
one thing is that you can't shoot this into glass and taking into account that IF you're swinging outside, you'll have to hook onto buildings which are mostly made of glass
Try to make a iron man blaster that actually works
The gow blades of chaos
Uhhh… anyone notice he hooked a carabiner into the belay loop and not the two loops you’d thread the rope thru? He’s probably fine but… yeah
You should make a robot human that you could control and make it move
Andrew's spiderman
Next week: Thief dressed as Spider-Man robs museum using homemade spider gear!
Excited for my webshooter to come in!
You're living my dream 🥹
I kind of want to see him jump first then launch but really cool!
What about all those leakages in the roof during rain ☔ 😲😂🤌
Yo can someone just pass this man a couple billion so we can get the technology to normalize Spider-Maning around a city
I knew I recognized the way he was talking about those chemicals! 2:26
13:19 reminds me of tobey spiderman pulling the food tray in the cafeteria
i allways wanted to make something cool like this. seeing this just makes me happy. Damnit. this feeling isnt really possible to explain using words
Not him using nile reds voice on 2:29 😂😂
When the government comes to confiscate all of his gadgets, he's going to go into hiding and start uploading real-life vigilante videos lol.
The only thing you need is a functional suit and put it all together and we got a superhero.
This man is the goat period.
U sounded like nilered taking shots
do you ship the web shooter to denmark
Now put these and the Wall Climbers together and we officially can get a Friendly Neighborhood Spooderman
could you try doing two swings in a row?
Odm gear from attack on titain
It seems that you ended up with more of a Batman grapple gun than a web shooter
Now add an exoskeleton suit, so you can throw yourself even farther.
Make the mobility gear from attack on titan please😊😊😊
more like batman 😂
it looked more like the ODM Gear from attack on Titan 🤣
Now make two and do two consecutive swings
There’s something missing
Will you ever restock the web shooter toy?
Make it real could never
It's kinda like Rico's grappling hook from Just Cause
Now make Batman’s grapple hun so you can disappear to the second story with a swishy cape
Looks cool.....went from looking like web shooter to batman hook
JAKE: But officer, its just a web shooter, I'm gonna be Spiderman!  POLICE: ...Sir that is a gun on a rope....
You should make a moon jumping shoes
What if you could have those sticking capsules (I have no clue what to call them sorry) to some sort of rope ladder, could that potentially be helpful for rescue teams?
Some day
I think you might be able to detach the nails by having something on the end of the line that pushes the nails out of the surface so that you could double these up and keep swinging
Do u only ship to USA? I am from Germany and CRYING right now becaue i cant set it to Germany.
plz make a Ben 10 omnitrix
I knew he was sounding like nyle red
Dude this is so awesome wow Imagine you could add this logic to make odm gear in attack on titan
Bro created a legal gun
This is flipping sick!
you see this as closer to spiderman, i see this as closer to 3d manoeuvring gear
2:26 NileRed?
We may not have the technology to make it smaller yet but our universe finally has spiderman
That's probably every engineer's dream...
Why at 2:29 is there a random voice change to nilered
That's not Spiderman, that's Spider Ranger 😂
2:24 am I tripping or is tht nile red
You should really make ODM gear
Stan Lee would be amazed to see this!
This can be used on construction... This is awesome
Pasenlo a español
Men is gonna develop this further until he can actually become a real spiderman haha
now… create a movie
You can also use it for defence! For legal pusrposes, this is just a joke.
imagine JLaser, Michael Reeves and maybe Mark Rober all worked on one video  that would be insane
Gonna be ridiculous when he figures out dual wield and reloads
Imagine trying to save someone from falling with one of these
It's more like Batman's grapple gun
hope you get the webshooters back in stock and maybe make a set of 2 and please ship them to all countries
Aww dang I wanted to order a web shooter but they only ship in the US unfortunately :(
Love the Nilered reference
Loved the NileRed snip
the retractable web shooter he’s selling isn’t something he’s even made, so it’s just like the other dozen people on amazon selling the same thing
Really disappointed you were shooting hard pieces of plastic at a fish tank
Make whiplash’s whips next video
I know the answer but do you think you could sell the webslinger that you can swing with i would love to use it
you almost there you just need one, make spidey senses and figure out to swing multiple time form you web shooter
Bro became NileRed for a second 😂
I like your other one better than this one
More  like Attack On Titans. 🤔
the Iron Spider
"so here i have two chemicals, and when I mix them, something really cool happens"-nile red
make another one for ur left hand so you can swing multiple times. nice vid btw
dude istg in the next 10 years he will make working web shooters like in the movies and that with the wall sticking suit he can literally be spiderman irl
How long until we see a vigilante roaming the streets on the news?
Make a second one and swing twice in one go!
Do you think you can make the fire sword from how to train your dragons from heckup
mom can we get spiderman? Mom- we have spiderman at home. Spiderman at home -    loved the video btw
Really fucking awesome, looks so fun! Next step is figuring out a way to carry more shots maybe? So you could swing multiple times before landing!
how long does it take to reload that thing tho😂 guessing 10-20 minutes
Imagine if he made 2 for double swinging
Bro this is the new Tony Stark
This is pretty awesome. I’d love to see a design on the daredevil billy clubs. They are multi functional and could make for a fun project!
All fun and games until his arm pops out of his sockets and he splats
2:27 so no one talking about nile red also spiderman is my fav hero since i was a child so you made my week thx
🕷️: Look what they need to match a fraction of my power.
No shipment outside of US?
if there is anything you should be commended for? It's your perseverance. Cause honestly?No one, has ever come this close to actually becoming spiderman. It's glad to see all that passion, ingenuity and experience you've amassed over the years, come together to make this dream of yours possible. I believe one day the world will see you swinging through the streets in your brilliantly coloured costume looking cool and all. Just have to ensure the next time you choose to go out for a swing in the neighborhood, don't use those webshooters to drive nails into people's houses, otherwise you'll get sued for property damage😄😄😄. But apart from that? Go Spidey!!!!
8:14  “All right guys today we are making a pipe bomb”
Just a grappling hook, more of a Batman tool than web-shooters. Still dope though.
2:15 i instantly thought about nilered 💀
Idea for you maybe you try to do War Machine suit with a gun on the back that follows your head movements
STILL NOT AS GOOD AS SPIDERMAN 😊😉
Imagine after 10 years
5 star police escape challenge with this lol  P.S: it's a joke, unless he can arrange something like mr.beast does.
Glad peter didn't get ahold of this while he had the symbiote
if this guy can do this all diy, i can't imagine what the military can do
Awwww man he's back 🥹 I can't wait
That's cool
Give this vid 2 weeks and will strike 25 million views 😂
Dude, be careful, this is fucking cool but you might’ve created a firearm according to the ATF. Watch your dog. 😳
I want you to jump and then swing
I want you to jump and then swing
I want you to jump and then swing
I want you to jump and then swing
I want you to jump and then swing
One of this days you're gonna make it, you'll become the actual spiderman
Theres a brazillian youtuber, his channel is called web shooter, and he has the most accurate web shooter i have ever saw, i know that you guys Will not be abre to understand the lenguage, but it is worth to check (Its not self promotion, check him out)
Now all you need to invent is a superhuman serum & we're going to have our 1st real superhero.
I heard nilered
Iron man mark 50 two energy blade, with a great details, and sharpness, but lights up in the dark, think u can make it???
You blew my mind again jlaser 😅 thanks bro
jlaser i might have a lil tip and something i thought of every time with the web shooter from 3:50 or well more the all at once one then if you made the string spin aswell then it  1. looks more like a web 2. it might be stronger then cuz if you look at a rope it is just some string spun up to make a rope lol so yeah that might be an idea
I feel like this will fit an Attack on Titan ODM gear functional cosplay more
Make spiderman suit with ai and heads up display
Absolutely badass
That's awesome!! Can you make the futuristic bike from Men In Black 3?!
mythbusters are probably screaming at themselves rn
Nile Red :)
You can have that one in one hand and the bad guy catching wen shopter in the other, so you climb walls, swing from ceilings, and catch criminals, thats the whole spider package !
do you pretend to ship outside US? i'm from brazil :(
He's doing it. The crazy fucker is doing it, and I love it.
I'm saving for one I really hope they don't run out....
That net launcher could be an excellent nonlethal option for detaining runners quickly. Awesome stuff. Makes me think of man catchers and stuff.
everyone missed the nilered reference
I remember watching the Mythbusters episode and thinking SURELY they could get that working if they tried.. You absolutely nailed it 🤣
This slowly becoming a batman tool
14:46 Dang..He Training For Something? Is It Kingpin?
13:21 Missed opportunity to walk through a door and have the tire cover slam against it like in Spider-Man 1
There's this idea i had, you can create Cyclop's glasses. It's one of things that's completely possible in this era, i did research for hours on the types of lasers you could use, the company that's creating them. I'll be more than happy to assist you(online ofc) if you plan on making this work.
As soon as he advertised his webshooters on the store, I couldn't stop myself from buying it 😬
2:15 knowledge ma bois :)
Mjollnir
I definitely just bought a shooter, my kids are going to be jealous 😅
What if you could make two so you can consecutively swing
This would work well as a grapple gun
Make your own super suit
If you keep at this I think theres a possibility you could legitimately become spiderman!
A pipe gun? Nice
Snoterman
bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls bro can you make black adom's shock waves pls
Are you no longer going to be selling the smaller version of you captain America shield that bounces?
2:24 IS THAT NILE RED
now you need one for the other arm
the actual name of this video is HOW TO MAKE A HOMING MISSILE
If only you had 2 you’d be taking parkour to new heights
You should make an iron man uni beam!!!!!!!!!!
It's just crazy man! Very cool!
So nice to see how much he has grown
now imagine if this guy had 2 of those
He might actually be Spider-Man he just pulled a car
You should make a memory fabric batman cape, that can turn into batmans glider cape
this man busted the mythbusters
Make a harry potter wand that controls a really small drone to pick stuff up
I would love it if you would put the spring ring on sale
I'd like to see you do green arrows zipline arrows
Hey man sick video, just wondering if you'll make those Web shooters available in Australia?  Went to place an order but couldn't change country's, would be sweet if you can!
my guy be out here inventing sci fi marvel things that should be impossible to make, and thats why they so cool. BUT NOW BRO IS SPIDERMAN IRL
Ok so hear me out. The suit will have both the models he made, one on each hand. That'll help in swinging faster with the quick reload one, and will stop punching holes through people when unnecessary
I think the possible solution would be to use cevlar cord with a small net on the end, so it covers more surface area. If this net is drenched in glue and during firing is sprayed or somehow else reacts with the accelerator of the glue, this net will cover great area and may hold you just fine, while also being able to stick to almost anything
Can you do iron mans suit that if you tap appears.
That Nile red joke is genius
This is amazing, but I think better idea is to cut off the line when you want to stop swinging.
Have you and Mark rober ever done projects together???m
I remember watching your videos when you got like 10k subs, im really happy you continued with your work your content is litterly my imagination IRL
ok man can you please combine you all spidy tool like edith , web , stick and alll
bro you just need another one and make the rope retract so you can actually travel with it and then just put on the wall climbers then you're spider-man  (btw idk if this is possible, I'm not an engineer)
Please put the  bouncing frisbees for sale!!!
Im already calling it. You will be the FIRST person in the WORLD to make ACTUAL Web-Shooters! Peter Parker would be proud.
This is stupidly underrated content. ❤
Who else noticed Nile's voice over.😁😁
Bro you should make 2 and then swing consistently like spidey does.
dude you look like spider man
y is no1 competing ab Nile red saying now I pull out the white goo
Awesome! Just awesome!
imagine how fun this would be if you were allowed to use them in a parkour gym or free running
I think for a next project you could make kimoyo beads just like the ones in black panther 2
If he ends up becoming a villain we’re fucked
Do you ever thought about doing the iron man blaster ?
If he continues with this, we might not need cgi anymore😮
he suddenly became nilered mid explanation💀
Wo oooh!!! That's Awesome 💥 Congratulations man! And all the best You are going some big placessss🔥
W VIDEO
i hope you'll end up in the multiverse animation thing
i think the next project is the actual web shooters that can't kill people
This is more like Batman's weapon though
සුපිරි 👌
Give this guy a few years and he'll make a time traveling machine💀
Great video, great product pitch. Just bought a slinger for a friend who’s birthday came up
Is it just me or did he sound like Nile red for a minute
He literally busted mythbuster's myth
might(i) suggest (u)considering the mechanics of how-ah fishing rod&harpoon work..
Start off with the climbers on the wall, Web swing, And land back on a wall. Then you are officially spider man Also wall climbers that let you run on the buildings like spiderman does?
So proud of you cause you worked hard for this project
Yeah, this is a really cool concept, but the only problem with the nail system is what if it is attached to glass!?
You should try to put one in each hand and swing twice
This man is gonna end up as spiderman. I'm telling you
Super cool 😎 and im super proud of you cause you've worked so hard
2:24 So nobody caught NileRed's voice there??
now you just need 2 of them to keep swinging, and if they could release the needle and not the whole thing and come back you could swing infinitely
Someone commented this and I have to agree, I think this is amazing but it’s closer to batmans grapple gun, I think if you lake into a pistol shaped thing instead of wrist mounted you’ll be pretty set on it
Do you have a patreon or something?
Ooo
Please do AOT's odm gear  🙏🙏
Who else noticed NileRed at 2:26
Part of me wanted to see two web shooters It'd have completed the Spidey aesthetic better One web shooter wasn't enough😩
This is awesome!!!!  Climbing and swinging!!!
Make two so that you can swing better
Make taser webs
Sick 🤟
It would be fun if you were in the next movie as a background/side character
Omg this is amazing
Please credit @nilered for his voice and work.
I would buy and use the net based one. the nail one is also super awesome.
Can we all agree j laser is the spiderman in our univirse
feels more like a batman grapple gun
But love it man super hero incomming
One of each hand would be better
Didn't expected the NIleRed voiceover cameo thing
Make another one and swing back to back without touching the ground
amazing as always!!
Isn't this... Just Attack On Titan's ODM Gear?
i swear if u can develop this even further and put it on  the market ur self ull be millionair lol ill buy one instandly
This is incredible
This will be history.
8:15 this reminds me of the ODM gear from Attack on Titan
8:15 Any Attack on Titan fan here ?
"Sticks to anything" thin ice and glass have left the room
12:46 Fallout music
This feels like a grapgun from bstman more than web shooter but awesome nontheless
It would be really cool if you could make an Attack on Titan 3D Maneuver Gear!
Think this would be better translated into a batman grappling hook
congrats man nice work.
You managed to invent basically Batman's grapple gun....amazing
bro is actually spiderman now
if it attaches by harness wouldnt it be better to refer to the gear suits in attack on titan?
Spiderman is cool, but this is the best and closest anyone has come to nailing a Batman style grappling hook/gun.   It would be insane to see what you could do if you leaned into that
I wonder if there's a chemical compound that can make real webs
DARPA Has entered the chat
He’s putting lives in those marvel characters 😳🔥
Nice Grapple gun!
Том байж болохгүй түгвэл муухай
Make a auto pilot bicycle
why did i hear red nye  at 2:27
why dont u advertise this to the local police force. They could really use this to have them try to catch criminals that are being chased by the cops. It would help them a lot. You would make a lot of money too.  The invention at 6:20
Make two of this and you will become Levi
Sooo...I think it will work better with black suit with pointy ears 🦇
With a second motor for the other hand and some kind of a reload system that activates after the unwind motor this will be absolutely spot on
Imagine doeing the same thing to the other arm
He's better than the hacksmith
Where is the link?
Insane work bro 🙌🏽
The NileRed reference 😂😂😂
i dont know, with them being attached to your waist, it feels more like the Attack on titan 3d maneuver gear than the spiderman webshooter, maybe that could be a next project
i am batman 🦇 🦇
The fact that you made a spider man glove I would love to buy that and I LOVE SPIDER-MAN
He is SOO CLOSE!!!!
this is if u can, make a short of jumping off one story, sticking and landing . It would look so cool🤩
Have you looked into the effect behind gecko feet? Maybe i should just watch the whole video.
Saw the web shooter and I couldn’t help but buy one. I’ve been watching you for years and found your channel through one of your lighter web shooter videos. Can’t wait to see it in the mail.
now how do i convince my parents to let me buy one
Dude you gotta make another one so you can double swing!!
I may know how he did the nail thing but all i can say is it reminds me of a certain hammer…
This must be Earth 3814's spiderman. Intresting..
my b-day is in a couple days but the shooters already sold out. If you sent me one or even offord to sell it to me i'd be so happy. if not id still support and watch your vids. keep making people smile. :)
I mean Iron Man suit
Use is like a trap
I can use my own web.. It shoot from my pea ness
How many videos will J laser?
Am I tripping or Nile Red briefly popped up
NutBlaster9000
Project idea: Lighter grenade from kingsman secret service
The Nile Red Reference.
What I'm about to mention doesn't solve any of the problems with getting the webshooter to actually stick to stuff, but something I think you should look into for projects like this is actually a german military climbing harness. Really weird intro to this comment, I know, but something I notice in all the attempts that can actually hold your weight is that there's a big long cable connected from the device on your arm to the harness on your waist. The advantage of the harness I'm talking about is it's very light weight and has both a leg and chest harness, and it's normally meant to be integrated into that company's plate carrier meaning it should in theory be decently easy to integrate into a Spiderman suit rather than be something you have to wear on top of one. Then all you have to do is connect the chest harness to the leg harness using the carabiner and then connect the cable from the web shooter to the tie-in loop on the front of the harness by running it through the sleeve.   Then you're not contending with all that bulky cable swinging around in front of you while you're trying to do stuff (a cable you would need two of if you had a webshooter for each arm and that would get super clunky super fast), you'll get to use most if not all of the full range of motion of your arm while you're doing non-swinging activities, and the swinging will look and feel more natural because the forces are applied to you in the same direction they would be if you were actually Spiderman grabbing your web.  https://md-textil.info/Chest-Harness-MGS here is the harness I'm talking about, if decide to give this a shot YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE you buy the leg harness and their specific carabiner that connects the two pieces together, and hopefully this is something that improves the quality of your future Spiderman projects overall. I think this might be a necessary upgrade for trying to integrate multiple Spiderman powers into one suit. If the wall climbing pads are each strong enough to hold your weight on their own, rebuilding them onto the same frame as the webshooters and attaching them to the harness with the same cable would effectively let you hang from one arm indefinitely for as long as the pad is still works.  I hope you actually see this comment bc I really think it's something you might find helpful. I always wanted to be Spiderman as a kid and I'd love it if this suggestion helps you so I can continue living vicariously through your youtube videos. Great job on this one
Now make two and make it detach and you can chain swings
that warehouse is going to leak now
why not stick shooters to both hands and try to double swing. Btw big fan from India.
He needs to pivot immediately. He's literally 1 or 2 steps from making the most practical Batman Grappling hook anyone has gotten close to. Especially since some iterations of Batman tend to clip the reel to their gadget belt.
Captain America shield and a kid size version of the fireman suit
Bb
Marvel's best makin in vfx and hes best in makin that vfx into reality
Now I know I’m not an expert in engineering but I have a very good idea of marvel and I think to get a farther distance you have to shooters and a double releaser so you can jab swing releases repeat
Getting goosebumps ❤❤❤
Make spy gear
Make ODM gear from attack on Titan... ❤️
OPPPPPPPPPPPPP bro soo amazing ❤‍🔥heart breaking...
Can u make one piece germa tech suit
I always wanted to see something like this as Spiderman fan and you did it Man so proud of you
Hi
2:15 bro just turned into nile red
Wouldn’t it be cool to have two of those magnets attached to the string, if you shoot it at a pole or beam the string would loop around and the magnets could stick together. You could even get fancy with electromagnets as a release (maybe? Idk)
Wow
How does this not have 10 million views I actually dont understand
@nextspider-man
I have an idea, what if you make leg rockets like iron man but for star lord, or other star lord things.
Dude that's awesome, now you should use two gloves and try to grapple multiple times in the air
One day the actual working spidey web shooter will also exist 🙂
Add a superstrengh reloader
Please keep making these I want so many of your inventions 😊!!
He’s just spiderman at this point😅
This could kill people
2:25 NileRed jumpscare
When are we getting spring ring my man?!?
man that was a fvking success.
become the flash
Bro they're actually getting closer to the Attack on Titan ODM gear faster than the spiderman web shooter
Turned in to Nile red for a sec
Check out Allen Pam’s video where he challenged people to hang on a bar for 100 seconds. He had a full body Kevlar harness concealed under his clothes. Might be cool to use that. You could conceal it under a suit.
Tony Stark: “Okay Kid *(knighted motion across shoulders)* You’re an Avenger now.”
2:24 I like how at one clip you collad'b with one of the sciantist shorts😂
when will they restock???
ain't no way
Could you convert that into the grapple gun from Batman
We need a part 2 of this when u make two of these web shooters and swing with it like monkey bars
This is the most revolutionary thing I have ever seen, total legit
That's amazing, but it could be more amazing. I'd like to see you wear 1 on each hand, swing & fire the 2nd 1 as you release so you do 2 consecutive swings without touching the floor.
This is quite some good gear already for what you’ve accomplished. It’s like Batman’s grapple gun, but for your wrist. I dare say it is almost near faithful recreation though, of Lukas grappling thing from the Bayonetta games. Looks and basically acts the same way as well. Also while on the subject Bayonetta Gun high heels. Or gun shoes. It be fun to see how you do that.
You need to give it to professional gymnasts and see what they can do
Had to order one of these toys
You should stop making videos of the progression right now and just come out in 5 years as a legitimate superhero
i feel like its possible to make mini full functional web shooters that you can actually web swing with with spidersilk and stuff then again no one is putting that much effort into it, ik its possible
As a AOT fan, you guys know what I’m thinking on doing with this technology
This reminded me of the ODM gear from Attack On Titan, especially with that grapple type thing that makes holes in anything it hits. And the motor for the length of the web and how it was attached to your waist. Maybe your next project could be the ODM  gear.
I’d go the biomechanics way when choosing between the three, but in engineering, you are truly a pioneer of the field. Absolutely inspirational and I will definitely be getting a webshooter off the store. Wish I could get a shield too.
Make a knife that when you throw it and it sticks make it a tiny explosion 💥 plssssss☺️☺️☺️
2:24 nilered is that you
He’s making my dream possible
NileRed 2:15
Remember the falcon wings video he said he would make wings that could fly but he just left the project behind
Maybe make the retractable sword from end game
He made a gun incredible
Awesome!!
If he could put 2 together he would literally have the gear from attack on titant
Nile red voice 😂😂😂😂
this feels a lot closer to the gear they use in attack on titan :0
LORD IVE ALWAYS WANTED A WEBSHOOTER! Wow you DID IT. Well almost but still awesome work bro!
This is my fav video of yours so far
Jump off the story and while your falling shoot the web and catch yourself
Retractable rgb lightsaber
2:15 bro became nile red for a second
You should sell it to the police. They won't have to use there gun anymore. Net first gun later.
This man has been trying to perfect these for years! (Several videos on it). I love seeing the progress made and different ideas on it!
❤❤❤😊😊😊
Make another one and strap it to your other hand!!
2:25 The NileRed audio was 👌👌
Make another one
Make another one
The government seeing him getting closer to become a real superhero: 😈🗡️
More like a batman than spiderman😅
I was too mindblowned  the whole episode. THIS IS CRAZY!!
You gotta do the jump of something to swing
ok this is cool in all but what happens if the building your swinging from cant hold your weight
Try and make more web shooters to sell
Yep, you won't be saving Gwen with this.
I would like to buy webshooter, but shipping is US only ;((( That is so unfair!
Now you gotta make a second one and do at least 3 consecutive swings successfully your real close to that end... I am glad I was born into era where I hit 30 this year i'm not too old to be swinging around and not too out of shape either (I pop off with parkour in the summer) I love that we got protolightsabers, real working warp engine proto theory and web shooters, we even got goats with altered cross species genetics that have spider silk in their goatsmilk... so the future is looking like it's gearing up to be at least a tame version of the comics and sci-fi!
Try Batman’s convertible cape/glider please!
i know im not gonna get many likes but its still worth a shot to try and get out to you i just wanna see someone make a retractable combi stick from the predator that would be really cool because nobody else has thank you
POV: your not watching this in full screen
What about g force?
You should make lazer tag but with swords. you have a hilt, and a device that when you get hit by the invisible swor, (or it gets in a serant proximity) you tak a HP damage. or same consept bu twiht a DND 20 sided dice to determan how much HP was taken.
This is actually insane
2:17 is that you nilered?
2:16 I thought to myself "Man, feels like it turned into a video from Neil" Then I heard his voice and said "WAIT A SECOND"
bro turned into nilered for a second there
The Nile goo
So nobody gonna talk about the white substance 💀
12:20 insurance watching like 👁👄👁
1:09 legit caught me off guard
Soon the military is gonna be askin him to make them odm gear lol
Fluid
I would be even more crazy to add multiple shots, possibly just modifying the design with two ropes and individual winches. We be sick!!
I am so happy about the webslinger and bounce ring
bruh is a spoiler for the new spider man movie
I used to have a mechanical design for a website using the nylon method and super glue idea sadly I lost plans for it and don't have the resources and time
Can't wait to see Airrack reusing this footage
Could use those shooters on either side of your hips and make ODM Gear from AOT
2:06 really super glued a piece of wood to your house. We appreciate the dedication
You should put a net shooter on the other hand so you can swing from either ceilings or trees, and can capture somebody. Great vid, keep up the great work!😄🕸
2:17 Bro turned into nile red 2:20 DIUHFDSIFU I WAS RIGHT
6:10 Police force could use this 8:30 That's a killing machine
NEVER would i have imagined someone getting this far into making it real.
nilered cameo?
2:23 Bro just became NileRed
Dude just use hot super glue BRUH
You can make shoes that can make you run on walls
@jlaservideo Please make a real Batman cape you can glide with like in The Dark Knight trilogy
bro he should entertain kids
The hacksmith could never
This is more like a grapnel
Spidey suit+red helmet =spider ranger
Im glad to see this
You can get the toy webshooter from multiple websites
Meanwhile Sony :We can have another reboot 😂
Why would you lie about it being your second try shooting at the car? We can clearly see like 6 other holes/dents that failed. Weird when people lie about stuff we wouldn’t have cared about to begin with
He should make one for his left and right hand
You should totally sell the captain America Frisbee
This man's talent is insane. Deserves so many more views that music videos or memes
Nilered
This feels a lot more like the Zelda hook shot.  Absolutely bonkers build though!
never thought anybody would get this close. This is a dream come true
Have you checked out GeckSkin adhesive to perhaps improve your wall-climbing abilities o.o I've been looking at that tape for a while and it replicates gecko skin for climbing.
If the hacksmith is tony stark then jlaser is Spiderman
He should use these in public
WARNING AOT Spoilers:                    14:26 That surprisingly looks a lot like the new combat ODM gear from season 3, all it needs now is a gun lmao
Uhuh a web shooter shooting white stuff at the start? 2:24 I expected for you to put something about nilered
Working in animal welfare, I wonder if the net shooter could be of use for trapping/rescuing stray animals.
pleaaaaaaseee have uk shipping available for the webshooter i understand it u cant but its just so cool and im not even a huge spiderman fan i just think it's so cool
This is genuinely sick dude
The only thing now is make it reusable. If you could find a way to reliably unscrew the dart from the wall, then reel it back in, and reload it, then it could be the first all purpose web swinger
1
You should make a captain America shield that comes back to you
Make two and have consecutive swings
It kind of reminds me more of the 3D maneuver gear from attack on Titan and I bet that It would be possible to make it  look more like it as a side project.
Let him cook for a few more years and Spider-Man shall be real
it may not be accurately a web shooter but this is 90% of the way to Attack on Titan
I think the closest thing you can do with this is the ODM gear from Attack on Titan. You can even get some inspiration there since they explain it technically.
Nilered!
Love the NileRed reference lol
I was about to buy the web shooter however it only delivers to the US..
Forge your own weapon
you can do some kind if succion mechanisme to get it hold
NILE RED? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
bro the police should invest in this sort of stuff it works real well yo and no harm at all
build gliders from spiderman homecoming
Bruh criminals in the world must feel the same way artists feel now with AI
i know how to make a working one, I'd show you guys but i broke my camera 🤷🏾‍♂️. I'll just let Mr Laser figure it out and show you guys
The grapple glove from fortnite
Much praise and love.  Keep going.  We all know you know you want both arms involved.  But the motor on the waist was a huge leap forward
One of the ones I want to see online I'd the bouncing captain america shield cause I've always wondered how that worked and I also always wanted to try that
Never let anything stop you from achieving your dreams
Am I crazy or did I see this same exact video months ago?
If you would have two of them on each arm you could actually swing release create a new rope to hook into the next one and repeat. The only thing is you decided to use nails to me that's a drawback. We need to figure out other sticky methods. What if you used your suction cup wall climbing idea where when you throw it to the wall you have many little ones and it sticks first of all with The Mousetrap glue. Then it uses a different mechanism to suck itself closer to the wall so it's a two-step process.
WOW
AMAZING!!!! BRILLIANT!!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!! Laser you are so cool. Thank you for your amazing content.
The avengers in one person
We need the spring ring
This is a amazing video, I love the creativity and would also love to do this myself
Nilered moment?        I KNEW IT
Haksmith callable when?
Can you make sure odm gear from attack on titan
nile red reference
Maybe you can make the 3D maneuvergear from aot with a similar mechanic
You should make Iron Spider Claws just to go with it, I know that'll be cool with your other spider man items
Instead of magic we use technology to achieve being superheroes
Yes, we love these semen blasters
Seems more like the hookshot from loz oot
I wish I was this smart
To be honest this looks like it would work far better than a taser in police work. The intial net design i mean
I would love this to be a official way to travel and everyone can become spiderman
imagine having the ironman jet on your hand for pull force
This dude is litaraly the spiderman irl
Taleho
I'm going crazy rn This is insane
I want the web shooter you are selling soooooo bad but there out of stock😢😢😢
Lu pin me.
please restock the web shooters if you can
Clause
Spider-Man actually shoots the web, releases it, grabs it, and then swings from it
these could also be used as Scorpion's stinger from Mortal Combat. Dont think its very legal tho....  *GET OVER HERE*
ABOOMBALAKAKA XDDDDDDD
so you made a nail gun with a rope attached to a harness
In every superhero story the hero's friend ends up becoming his enemy. In this story which one of your friends ends up becoming your enemy/Arch Rival?
Where you able to spot every whole in his house comment bellow
3:46 seems very smart
this is by far one of the most comprehensive spider-man tech tests ever.
I think you should make wolverine
If this is what a some guys in a shed can make. Imagine what a serious project with genuine funding can do.
i like your channel and you make great stuff but please stop clickbaiting, I always assume your video title is a lie because every video but 2 have had some deception in the title.
This is literally how Tony Stark got started.
you should make another one so you can swing twice
I feel like it would be cool if you tried to make a hover board that can actually hover. I get it if it’s too much to ask for though.
All great until everywhere Spider-Man goes the roof starts leaking 😂
This is more likely batman not spidey
make batman's grapple hook
cool but why gineus people have so many free time
Dubz
i was just nile jump scared
Imagine making 2 of these then double swinging
Make toys become rich you don't be an idiot
Your inventions are awesome! You should work with Darpa. The USA and other countries have all these things and more, and with your help, maybe we can see the day when people get around using web shooters! #imagination
Well if you did get it to work you still can not swing from building to building, your arms will rip off due to you pulling so hard to get motion, spiderman has superstrenght and you dont, so no you cannot be spiderman.
Why dont you try to use the same thing u have on your wall climbers on the tip of the rope so that you could stick to any surface without making holes in them. It would be cool if you could adapt that concept. Amazing vid btw its amazing how you can make such incredible projects.
This is awesome, I feel like this could be what the kitbash Spiderman uses to swing in a more apocalyptic world
It’s more akin to AOT’S omni directional manuver gear then Spiderman.
I think you should make a mando ambian sniper
0:43 that edit was clean
SPIDERMAN IN GOTHAM BE LIKE...
2:16 did I hear Nile red? 😂
This is so cool to watch happening
God I fucking want one
Wait until the police catches you with a net like a prey and then taze you 💀
i acttually want something similar, but not sure if i can hack it , same principle but with more power to hold an item and faster retractability,
bros roof is gonna break
You should make a Mysterio helmet that can control multiple drones at the same time (btw I love your videos)
JLaser is basically iron-manning himself into being spiderman at this point
Needs one on each hand and reloadable
Urm... I was hoping maybe u can give us the falcon jet suit you talked about a time ago. Like the one you can actually swing from
i want it so bad but i dont have shopify 😭
you should join the military this would be great for special ops needed for infiltrating and hostage situations
bro is now just spiderman, but if spiderman was a youtuber.
You are my hero dude
If he can make this small and compact, like maybe a small titanium casing, and have 2 of them, this would be the most legendary damn thing ever.
Awesome man. Please try making attack on Titan ODM gear next time.
Damn. That's genuinely much more effective than my cynical engineering student brain thought it'd be.
2:26 different person
Make Thor’s hammer that comes back to you
Marvel hire him
You see this could be amazing especially for if you fall from a height and need to catch yourself but if you do it while not knowing exactly how to you might as well just get rid of your arm
What kind of drugs do I need to be on to do this😂😂😂😅😅
this guy is our IRL peterparker without the  superhuman powers..like a SPIDERMAN in using nerdy tools and eingerneering I love it
Can you  make  elitric  whip  that  what evar  you  hit  breaks  fast
Wow, not only is the finished product crazy, but the fact that Jake casually made an initial design that can actually wrap webbing around targets and still went on to make the nail-based design in the same video is insane! I love to see the evolution of his Spider-Man gadgets, and I think that with some refining (and maybe adding other features to the suit like the Hacksmith's Lidar Spidey-Sense and BuiltIRL's grappling hook web shooters,) a fully-fledged Spider-Man suit could very well be finished within months!
Very cool, very inspiring, and much better than anything I could do. But even still, one problem remains. With this setup, it can't stick into brick/concrete, glass, or metal. We saw it go into the brick a little at one point, but is it strong enough to stick in it? Would it be able to pierce and stick in metal? Glass just wouldn't work; it'd shatter instantly...  I don't even know where to start with fixing those issues, but I'm sure y'all will eventually. Keep up the great work!
Bro i want to buy those black web shooters when is it going to be back in stock I NEED TO KNOWW!!!!
You probably use the geco tape that veritasium has shown in his channel
0:16 ayo thats sus 😳
This man literally made the attack on Titan otm gear
This is a awesomely dope.
can you turn that net into a grappling hook? like have a motor on it to reel you in?
He's another super hero now
12:41 Lets pretend we don't see those holes, it was only the second try)))
man is one step away from becoming a real life spider man
It's been a while Good to see you again
please i need spring ring
Make a Loki staff😊😊
Ok you've done iron man, you've done spider man, but you should try the hulk next, or Thor, with an exo skeleton that moves to your will but not to something you're holding
You could add a speedometer to the end of the nail, connected by Bluetooth to  arduino to a servomotor, so when the nail hits the target, and it's speed becomes 0, the servo automaticaly retracts the webbing until it turns tight enough to swing
damn it all sold out
Its been a day since you released the web shooters you can buy, but there already sold out. is there a chanse you will release more of them because currently some people including me are not able to buy it yet. Do you also ship to europe by any chanse?
This is by far the best progress video I have seen of real life 🕸️ web you can swing from 💪💪💪💪 keep up improving it 🤞have a feeling getting real close to a real swinging web shooter in the near future
u need two of them and try to swing further :D
Now that you made it, hit the streets and get peoples REACTIONS TO IT!!!! DO IT!
2:25   How has nobody noticed the nilered voice here
Add all your Spider-Man stuff to one suit
I WANT THE ONE WHERE I CAN CAPTURE PEOPLE
Try Geckskin? 👀
your good at making web shooters try making real odm gear or omni directional mobility Gear
Bro is irl spiderman
I think if you do it in both hands you're probably Spider-Man at this point
imagine if him, Allen Pan, and Hacksmith Industries all collaborated on something!
make a ben 10 hologram watch
👌
this is 1 step closer, u know what will be 2 steps closer? 2 of these on ur arms with more rounds for a continuous swing
I cant be the only one that realised at 2:26 its nilered talking
What if you make a hamer that can come back to you
Hey bro just wondering who’s ur favorite super hero? From marvel
Yo for the web shooter that u showed in the beginning it would be really cool if u could release the schematics of them or go through how u made it but honestly I would love to make one myself 👍🏽
Now you just have to find a way for cheaper webs 😂  Edit: The helmet works fantastic with the Spiderman suit
Super sick.  However, Manhattan aint made out of wood. I'd love to see a version that works on concrete
For your next vid you could try making an iron man nano-tech suit where little medal bits like travel along a conveyor belt suit and make the outfit (helmet is up to you)
OOH MAKE A WORKING HEV SUIT FROM HALF LIFE
Think how useful this could be to fire fighters!
Wear it on both hands
Spring loaded grappling hook instead of nail
It would have been better if it is made as batman’s grappling hook
i liked that nilered reference
Can you build starlords blasher?
Wow good work
Bro we are in the universe where JLaser is Spider-Man.
If you want to read the Gospel then I will put something like that in my replies but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. I put this because in Acts 1:8 it says “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” so I put this to do what The Lord says. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
coooooooooooooool
2:25 Please let NileRed free!!
I say that he should make another pair of the web shooter for his other arm and then swing from one wall to the other
Please make the handheld motion tracker from the Aliens movies and games.
Please do international shipping on the next batch of web shooters! ❤️
He now needs to master some martial art and gymnastics parkour and you’re set ! Awesome work!
Honestly now we just need to insanely miniaturize all of this add it into a suit with the rest of the gear once it too has been miniaturized and functional
Video Idea: You should make a hidden taser launcher that shoots a electric net using the net launcher you used from this vid to launch it.
Day one of asking Laser to make a Bazooka out of a Pringles Can
Man just make a radioactive spider and fulfill all of our dreams and become a real spiderman.
Engineering is not about making reports.. This is engineering...  Man..as a fellow Engineering studeny u motivated me man
I think you should make EDITH v4
have you seen the stuff called gecko rubber you might be able to make a more compact and easyer to use wall climber
Maybe he could make a fire , lightning and gravity(if possible) staff
The efforts,time and the brain he uses are mind-blowing awesome bro we need more people like this guy but the subscriptions he got is less than what he deserves
make a doctor strange cape than can lash on to you and fly by itslef and fly to u somehw
The fact that he’s just testing this stuff out at his house 😭
Too bulky for spidey BUT, it's perfect for Attack on Titan's ODM gear. One step closer to being spidey, but you're already halfway there from making an ODM gear.
Make one more and combine web shooter and wall climer and test it at streets
w0ow
Can you make daredevils billyclub
thats literally just a grapplehook at this point. :(
could have just been bit by a radioactive spider
Hey , the web shooters could be with nails like the nails are attatch to string or smth and you do the nails like this 100x an some how fit it to a web shoter
You should make a grappling gun
Are web shooters or maybe a Batman's graple gun?
Nice to see another video from you finally ❤❤
I love how red Nile was in this lol
Sweet! It looks amazing! Now all you gave to do is make it so it can support your weight!
that is NOT a web shooter that right there is a web BAZOOKA
Now you need to make 2 and make them reload each time you shoot it😋😂
This is wild. Homie is straight up pioneering how to be the real spiderman
please make a real cutting lightsaber.
I want oneee I don't have money😔
Anyone else hear nile red at 2:27
I know this is gonna be basically impossible but if you added another one it would be insane cuz u could swing twice
For your next project you should make a robot bird like from the birds are drones from the government thing, I personally would think that would be super cool
Imagine he’s escaping from the police with those tools
You could try making a replica spider silk or just use powder silk because when spider silk is as thick as a spaghetti strand it is stronger than steel
Went straight to buying, purchasing with PayPal is fine though right cause that is what I did?!
a year ago i dint think you would be this close to being spiderman, you did amazing dude it looks sick
its sold out ): and I want to buy
Did u get a new editor?
🤩 WOW
Hacksmith might be as close as real life tony stark But this guy.... might be the peter parker we need
MAKE ONE MORE FOR YOUR OTHER HAND AND THEN YOU CAN DO A PROPER SWING
That voice saying "I was able to pull out some white goo" at 2:25 sounds quite familiar 😂 I'm loving it 👍🏻
Well he's successfully created a bat grappling gun. Next up is spiderman, he's getting too close lol
IMAGINE HE HAD TWO OF THOSE FOR COMBOS
when he swung with the spiderman suite on he looked like he had a spidey boner
how did you unattach the things from the ceiling.
Man, 2030 gonna be great with these on the marketplace
You should add the web shooter that shot a net on to the other hand so you can climb a wall,swing and then shoot a net to capture something/someone.
imagine if he dual wielded the web shooters so he could swing constantly
thats more AOT then sppider man lol but cool
you used nile blue's audio as white goo.... 😆😆😆😆😆
Why does it sound like Nilered 2:25
Next Video: I built an REAL radioactive spider
Epic
You should finish redfalcon's wings
Do a predator helmet built
please make more web shooters there already sold out!
2:15 I knew you were imitating NileRed from the very first sentence 💀
The landscaping difference tho
I already purchased one of your web shooters😂
.22 gauge?
13:20 It's just like the scene from spiderman 2002 where peter walks off with tray sticked to him🤣🤣🤣
Damn web shooter already sold  out when are you guys gonna re stock them 😔 😪
did nobody notice nile reds appearance 😂😂
you have to make a sort of anti recoil and when it stop it get blocked so it should work passivly
MAKE IT BUT BETTER
me watching jlaser video but sees mark robers new video that JUST came out
2:18,red Nile this you?
You should make a grab pack from poppy playtime.
Incredible Nile red impression
Hey Jay I really like watching ur videos and everytime u post, I already can't wait for the next video but now I think we should venture into DC Maybe a full working batman utility belt...???
how many of those wires do you have to make?
I think you add some type of explosive in the end of device i think its a thing we called it gandhak and potash(potassium +sulfate) when we apply pressure on it on closed chamber it explodes and create a great reation on nail.
Make a drivable car real car
I advise you to return to the Venom project, in fact, making a ferrofluid that does not stain you is much easier than it might seem. In the Russian-language YouTube, the dude made slime from ferrofluid, which does not leave traces of touching objects
man U are real superhero for me
Bro that’s sick. Imagine having another one on the other arm… that would be insane.
One day and they are already sold out on your store 😫
Please please please put your bounce back frisbee I want one so badly I tried to make it so many times but they never work  please put it on your website and like post a short just saying that you can buy it because I want it so badly.      Please
By 2060 we'll already have spider-man and batman working together to fight crime in real life
This has to go viral!
This is the closest anyone had ever come to being spider man
It's all play and games until the military invests in it...
Amazing
JLaservideo's next video: Today we are going to make the fallout four fatman mininuke launcher.
You should put one on both of your arms so u can swing 2 times in a row
RIP spare tire.
NileRed's voice at 2:24
Could you turn this in an Attack on titan machine?😮
Make his web wings it would be cool if it worked💀
Yooo this guy could make the oem gear from attack on titan
I was gonna ask about you selling it but I guess you thought of every thing😂
Also Spidey's web, unlike many other adhesives is designed to break down relatively fast.
It would be awesome if you build the iron man thrusters in the leg.
Wauw, just wauw
The web shooter could be a cool fishing gear. Replace it with a hook or something.
bro, restock ur web shooter, i wanted to make a B-day party with those but the were sold out (btw do you ship to europe?)
This feels more like batman but still cool none the less
MAN THIS MAN IS A WALMART LOOKING TOBEY MAGUIRE BUT USES A TOM HOLLAND SUIT 💀💀💀
Need another web shooter and hack smiths spider sense gear
Bro can become a superhero
If only he had more budget....
Ok guys, which one of you gave him the secret Superhero blueprints
Nile red cameo
Man, have you tried nano tech tape? I think it could be a good solution
Any idea as to when the web shooter will be back in stock?
My man is always ready for a zombie apocalypse
To become Spider-man, you must apparently first become Scorpion.
This alone is why I want to get a  degree in engineering
bruh the thing is offsale after 1 day pls restock amazing webshooter
Also batman's grapple gun.
feel like you can make the 3D maneuver gear from Attack on Titan
Make sure they fly 🪰
You should make a second one. Attach each contraption to each arm. Then do a continuous swing from one arm, and then to the next quickly letting go of the first arm’s rope, and looking even more like Spider-Man
Make iron boots
Day 1: asking you to build a real life Ada Wong phone cube from Resident Evil 6
The hint of Nile was glorious
Lol, I just checked the website, and it’s already sold out after a day😂
why is he so obsessed with becoming spiderman 😂
Make one for the other arm and try to swing and release twice!
i have an idea for this co2 comes out of the tube like ur using and shoots a pointy object then shortly after that gets shot another piece of meatal on cevlar string  hits the screw in i think that would work really well
the four spideys tom andrew toby and jason
try hot glue
you should pair this with ur first idea so it dosent kill people when you try grabing them so you could have one on one hand and one on the other
I really hope he restocks the web shooters. He’ll make a mint off selling those alone (And I still want one too!)
You should make an iron man chess play arc that does actually shoot a real laser
Anyone know if the web shooters could be back in stock?
microbots from big hero 6?
Reject humanity and become spider
Whats not to love about this video
This is so cool, please allocate your time into this
Beware! The Hacksmith may get a Guiness Record copying your proyect :P
Bro turned in to nilered for a second
he looks so much like andrew garfeild in his speidy suit
Song at 16:30?
Definitely getting close but the rig is way too big, can't see anyone wearing this.  Keep trying man, you'll get there.  You're an inspiration
You are a legend dude!
you have to got a prize nobel for that fr fr!
Trust me U don't wanna go any further cause if u do government gonna come smashing ur house stealing ur everything or just force u to work with them
My hero season 6 spoilers suggestion:                     What if he makes all of dekus new quirks Like float, blackwhip and smokescreen
Please make more of the web shooters... I really want to buy one but it sold out so quickly (understandably)
is this the next sequel of the Anatomically Correct Spiderman? 15:35 💀💀💀
YOU MAKE IRON MAN SOTER🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
All he needs is a second one and then he can do 2 swings after another, he will literally be Spider-Man after that
make iron man mark 85
if this guy can make a spiderman suit or a functional iron man suit so can u make a     f u n c t i o n a l    o m n i t r i x
2:15 mans become NileRed 🤣🤣🤣
the leakiest warehouse in the west
Are the web shooters returnable
One huge step forward!
The cop need the net wing
Just a step away from real 3DMG. Wow. Never though I will see this day.
I can only dream of having this  It is so insane you're putting in the work and making this a reality
The reason Spider-Man can hang on is the same reason he can climb on walls. Which means next project is to get bit by a radioactive spider
i say make moon knight super hero suit
Bro is making military grade things at home💀
The Niel Red reference caught me off gaurd ... It was good.
Though this is very cool, you forget the fact that your leaving nails everywhere and you can only "stick" to wood or something else that's soft enough for a nail but doesnt break
US Military wants to know your location
Nearly all the way there! This is SO COOL!
hello I got an email from u and it said I won a prize can u clarify I thought it was a scam.
That could be useful for police, to safely catch people with out shooting them.
I happy for jlazer
Now sell the swinging one
How about you make some 100% accurate ODM gear next?
Connect with the YouTuber nail red and work about a real Human spider web
Was that 315?!
He always has succeeded in any thing he does
I wanna buy some
Hacksmith are doing lightsabers real, and you are making spider man real.
Great engineering, love the progress...
6:43 you can use it for fishing, if you find a way to make the web havier so it doesn't float and also to close fast so the fish doesn't escape. :)
you should combine all your web shooters, and suits, and become a superhero.
Honey, spider-guy with shotgun on his wrist is not real. He can't hurt you. Spider-guy with shotgun on his wrist:
Hey JLaser, omg this is amazing, you know, i am something of a scientist myself😂but have never seen anything like this before especially your design is astoning👍 Unfortunately I'm from Germany, is there any way to get your webshooter to my place??
i feel like this is closer to grappling hook rather than a webshooter
Please send  it to India
this guy became nile red at 2:15
Bro took "I want to be spiderman when i grow up" to a whole new level
You should make a expanding black panther helmet
When are you going to try to make light saber
The man mark rober is too afraid to be. good job!
marvel been real quiet since this dropped
was that nilered at 2:25?!
Kinda sad that you can’t buy the web shooters outside of the us but I guess it’s understandable
now we wait for the day where JLaser puts all of his creations together for 1 ultimate form of a creation
Thats not so much a Spider-man web-shooter but more of a Batman grappling gun made to look like a web-shooter. Think about it
I can’t believe I just bought a webshooter
I can tell you this make a small hulk strength system
Oh ok I changed my mind
He umm...... I wanna trade one of my kidney for the web shooter
I love how there are people like him that can make revolutionary teach like this and they work on yourube😅
NASA who? all I know is JLaser
Why don’t u make a tutorial about this
what if instead of making the device to hold the rope make it to where the rope is always attached and you can swing and the device instead cuts the rope so that you can shoot the other one when you want from the other hand then cut the one you don't need off so it lets you swing from the other hand instead of using it to hold  it? maybe it can be slimmed down the devices?
He should make ODM gear
He should make ODM gear
Duel wield it, you can try double swinging 😂😂😂
Do a odm gear from aot
On this earth the name of the spider man in jlazer
When it’s paired with the climbers it’s insane
I've seen some cringe from you but this has actually impressed me substantionaly
Can u make Batman weapons???
You should create a Deku costume from My hero academia
man this guy is smart
disappointed you can't ship to Australia
every criminal when they see a nail in there chest with a rope coming out: dang spidey u got me *dies*
Hey Jake Very cool Video. Why not try to make the 3D manuever Gear from Attack on Titan? Again Very Cool Video.🎉❤
Now we are one step closer to getting real life neighborhood Spidey swinging in the city
When 2050 hits we gonna have really evil people and spider man flying cars from J laser Except for the evil part
If Spiderman had this the city would have to replace glass on buildings
2:25 ha is that NileRed?
i swear hacksmith did this first
This dude is living my dream
I imagined this day
Bro no way! You're really turning into a real life spidey! Despite it leaves nails everywhere and needs reloading, that's just enormously crazy. So.. What's the next step? 🤔
I USED TO WATCH YOUR VID SINCE I WAS 10 , ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU
He would be the ultimate zombie slayer if they were real 😂
what if the building is glass??
Cool inventions like always!
Thank you JLaser! You will see in a couple of years the people graduating from college to become like you.
It's amazing how he constantly makes it better. I mean he finds the main problem and than solves it. The amount of planing and dedication that goes into it is unimaginable for me. Keep up the great work. Now you can climb wood (nails) and metal (magnets) but what about concrete (glue). I can't wait to see when you use two webshooters at the same time but i'm not sure how reloading would work if you wanted to swing more than twice unless you have spare webs which takes some space.🎉
It's not spider man it's from Attack on Titan.
I just bought 2 for my boys. Thanks for your entertaining content and love of engineering to inspire my kids to be a fun engineer like you when they are older.
Damn good work as always JL Laser!!!
maybe you can make the nail expand somehow and you can release the rope easier maybe
2:26 Nile red??????/voice
This is also green arrow swing shooter
Is he using a Bürkert valve ?
Jlazer can u please put those heat sensor glasses or night vision glasses on your shop
You don't ship to Australia nooooo
This honestly is a better batman grappling gun than the webshooters. But still very awesome work, thank you
Can I have one but I don't have any money 💵💵💵💵
You should make a rocket hammer when you throw it it comes back to you
I love the smoke effect it gives a TASM vibe
DARPA would like to have a talk...
2:26 Nilered-
I have been subbed to this guy before he even hit a mill (on my other acc)
Of course, now you need TWO of them to swing in succession at least one extra time for extra badassery
I have an idea for the next project can you make ODM gear from attack on titan please
Make a retractable super suit
Make a book with a spine which can shoot darts
Make a yoyo with a string powerful enough to hold your body weight with a motor to pull u up
dude you're making my childhood dreams come true, cant wait to buy the smaller one on your shop! I've always wanted to have web shooters, and I was psyched when the Sony game came out lol, but here you are creating the real thing, love it, keep it up man!
Mammykiss is the seller
some one has your thing on amazon for 50 bucks
congrats... your famous.
You know those name tag holders people have? The ones where you can pull your name tag out to show someone and then let go and some spring type mechanisms pulls it back in? Maybe you could utilize something similar to make sure the rope is taut, just modify it so it better fits this project.
I’m so glad I watch this the day it came out
Just imagine if Spiderman tried to save mj from the fall with this web shooter.
At this point, he can make his own avengers in real life
Hi Jlaser can you do something like from Stanford Pines's inventions (Stanford Pinesis from Gravity falls.
Now make it for both arms then swing twice
Dude lives in the movie kickass
They gotta rent a bigger warehouse and try to chain together 2 swings
@Hacksmith when you gonna 1up this guy?
I think you almost have it. A suggestion for you. Your wall climbers work pretty well to hold you. Instead of shooting a mechanism that stabs. Shoot a mechanism that houses a suction device. It's closed in the gun, opens up while flying, and when it hits a surface will stick and then an attached air pump will hold that suction. You will need to run wire up the rope if you want control with the airpump. Or have a sensor automatically turn off the air pump when it stops sensing a tensile load in the rope.
You guys should make a retractable glider
I love how he puts his life on the line every episode. If not his life his life savings 😂
What’s the website
and make a air bending suit  with fire water and earth bending to
sell the spider man climbers for 32.99
Nile red is that you?
I think a bat Tumblr will be pretty cool
Petition for JLaserVideo to change his channel name to "Spider-Man IRL" and to legally change his _legal_ name to Peter Parker. Bro really plays the part well, looks & all! 👏👏
Thank you!
Suggestion for a build, a reverse flashlight. Whatever you shine it on becomes darker instead of lighter.
Dude I love that you actually paired the climbers with the web shooter to go for the full spiderman experience - and it really worked! Seriously incredible. Your ingenuity is impressive - this is what engineering is all about!!
Ant man suit
You should make a real life thanos gauntlet
You might be able to market the net variation to police officers who could use it as non-lethal capture. Heaven knows they could use the help.
Leave it to Jlaser and Crew to develope completely new levels of parkour! So dope!
there's only 2 problems, 1 Property damage, 2 not being able to use the same rope again without a lot of force
9:06 I thought he was doing a front lever on it lol
But how do you make the spider sense real?
2:25 NileRed?
bro made the call of duty grapple system
This is just peter parker making vlogs on his progression to his suit
if you make another one for the other arm you can swing twice
I was not expecting a NileRed crossover 2 minutes in, but am very pleased!
Yes, definitely sell the spring ring frisbee!
Please ship to Canada
make the Yellow Jacket
You are the best. I want to be like you so badly.
i will relish the day that somebody actually makes an accurate web fluid that they use to swing across buildings without any special motors besides shooting and releasing the web
Heeeeey! NileRed reference!
damn he's halfway there
Grappling hook.
Do a video where you are actually spider man using the wall stickers and climb up a building and shoot your web
i would love to see to make a real thor suit................love the video btw...... i have know idea how you guys come up with this stuff it's amazing
Did anyone else catch the NileRed reference? 😂
You ever hear about gecko adhesive? It's something you might want to look into.
Will we have to wait another 4 months for your next video?
If you get another one and figure out a way to retract it you could possibly swing further distances
I get $350 a month on my debit card, I know what I'm buying and bringing to school, Baby! I'M GONNA FINALLY BE COOL IN FRONT OF MY CLASSMATES!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JACKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
RIP the spare tire
Next video is creating a Gwen S. or a Mary Jane
Now just duplicate the web shooter for the other arm and double swing xD
Do the web shooters ship to Canada?
2:17 bro is nile red 😂😂
you should try to make one for your othr hand so you can swing 2 times in a row
Awesome, unfortunately there are now holes in all his roofs...
you should make a whole series about making spidermans powers reality
Nah🙄
its amazing. but more like a batman grapling hook than anything else.
I wish one of the spider men could try this
nvm it was 2:29
Mack a iron man hand that’s shots out fire
excuse me, ARE YOU MAKING A BATMOBILE????
2:35 was NileRed talking right there???
thank you so much for this i had been talkin about this forever and been waiting i knew one of these days you'd do it! this is super cool and i appreciate you spending the time trying to figure this out like many of others. great job
U did not grab that spoon 😭🤣😂
Use a magnet to make the super glue stick
Use the same concept for working batman grapple hook 😊
Make a real life Spider-Man suit that can actually alert enemies
Bro turned into NileRed at 2:16  😂😂
He made an advanced sticky hand
Thats what you call a spidey bazooka
do you have a time frame for when you will be shipping the web shooters i'd like to turn it into a automatic reload nerf gun, also keep up the great work
Shame you dont ship to canada, awesome work tho. Keep grinding🙌
An Idea for a video: a net gun, but it has multiple shots, and maybe like quick load capsules, which contain the net and the rope. plus like a retracting mechanism in the shells too? (for the use of that net)
I wish I could do stuff like this
Captain America Infinity war shield
Gives me more attack on titan odm gear vibes than Spider-Man web swinging
it'd be cool if you made a teleportation device
Now you should make ODM gear from attack on Titan
pls make the spider man chest drone also keep up the great work you are a true idol (I say idol because of the inventions just let's not blow stuff up and make things set themselves on fire if you idolize him) 🕷🕸
Do a Batman glider cape
the legend of Zelda Hook shots/Claw shots are they to close ,or just be full upgrades?
Great now all you have to do is make real life arm gliders unless you already did that
This is fantastic! Amazing, Spider-man!
AWESOME!!!!
I'm so amazed at your tenaciousness
Seems more like odm gear from Attack on Titan
1 more think to be a spider man is a girlfriend? Heehehheh i am joking
My man just made a screw gun amazing video!!!!
Another idea is Thor’s hammer using a really strong Tesla coil or emp
Billionaire idea. Teleportation through exotic matter or something like that
please make the odm gear from attack on titan, i think you'll nail it!
Where do you buy it
This guy is the off brand spiderman
Romans 10:9 (KJV) that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
@Jlaservideo made this
Oh my God JLazarn actually posted. How is that possible?😂😂😂😂😂
You should make ODM gear from attack on titan
What happens if you shoot after jumping
Respect the Effort and Execution
can you make an assassins creed knife? please?
This is insane!! If u had one on each arm you might actually be able to start swinging more!
Swing in the city! And I will sub
Your final product resembles that of usopss:ahoahoah.
Sadly it only works on wood. Now he has to find out how to stick on a brick, concrete and stone wall.
Thank you for nile red voice
Can you imagine if they gave you a few million dollar budget with unlimited supplies and a couple engineers to collab with!
looks like ironman trying to become spiderman, i love it, he's getting so close to become a real superhero
wait isnt that the SpidingHeros webshooter?
You should put your Thor hammer on the market, along with your doc oc arms and captain America shield. You should sell the iron man suit too! It’d be a lot but it’d sell! Oh and sell all the web shooters! (Obviously not the nail one!)
You should have nickpro test out your Gadgets
cant order for Portugal 😭😭😭
Is it just me, or does this remind me of AOT gear?
I need one of the web shooter I live in  or had park  MD elkicot city
If this is V1, V2 is finna go crazy
Need it to reach my remote control
Could u make a climbing suit to go with the web Shooters
now all he needs to do is make another one and see if he can use both to swing
Dude this was...Amazing and Spectacular!
hear me out: use two of them, so you can swing across a larger space
A sub from me 😊
I am in high school and want to be an engineer what can I do now to learn and get started
In a way this is more like rico's grapple than spidermans web slinger, not to say thats a bad thing. still this is pretty cool to see, it does need some more work, but this works pretty well for d.i.y.
Coll
I bought one of those web shooters off a sketchy website
u should make a black widow blaster.  The one she used one black panther in civil war when they found Cap and Bucky
But great job this video is a banger
Can you make something from anime like shoto todoroki fire and ice or an rasengan or even a kamehameha anime fans will be really happy and honestly i think that people that havent watched anime will be interested in seeing this video
Stan Lee Would Be Proud
idea : put ferrofluid in box with electromagnetic magnets that puls randomly, making the fluid look like venom !!!!!! i think it would be cool and I have though about doing this idea my self but don't have the knowledge to do it.
JLazer is about to become a superhero with all the inventions he got.
You should have the net one on the other side
I've never impulse-bought anything faster in my life.
Yor local Dollar Tree Spider-nam
Now you need one for the other arm so you can stick(1) swing(1) stick(2) release(1) swing(2) release(2)
How
this viideo the best birthday gift i couldve asked for
This is more like a real life batman grapple hook but still awesome.
odm gear much
This man is one tragic backstory away to becoming a vigilante
Wooww that's fantastic ! C'est incroyable !
Oscorp wants to know your location
I love how more down to earth you make your inventions like we can’t really make spiderwebs that shoot but we can make a net that can attach to things and people
Jlaser doesn’t fail to impress, once again
If you can hide all of this inside the suit, and learn how to control it better, you will literally be spiderman
can i buy it?
Falcon wings part 2
It's cool but it's not a web shooter. It's a grappling hook launcher.
This guy reminds me a lot of the Doctor from  Back to the Future.
2:20 is that Nile red?
This is so incredible! I never imagined that someone would engineer Spider man’s powers, but I’m glad that you and your team are pioneering this technology! You are doing what government engineers are doing with just a fraction of the money available. I am astonished that you and your team have made so many cool projects so far, and I really hope that you never stop. Go JLaser!  (As a suggestion for another video, perhaps you could make something like the hook shot or claw shot from the legend of Zelda with this same concept!)
I love ya videos❤😊
Try making full aqua man gear set. U already have the jet boot things, just make a trident that shoots water at high pressures
Do something with Deadpool
I watched your first webshooter , your grapplehook webshooter and now this this is amazing
Is it just me that heard NileRed 2:30
Next step: Make 2 of those shooters - one for each hand with multiple refills for both and then you swing across a warehouse.
Do the 10 rings
Dude!!! You never cease to amaze! This is truly incredible!!!
2:18  “Something really cool happens”  Bro turned into Nile red
a flying soot jacksmith
Could you please build another one for the other hand
I want to buy web shooter but I'm in the UK and it doesn't have UK in shipping :(
You have to make 2 and swing web to web
I bought one of the web shooters and it hasn’t came😭
You should make a toy company
I just know I'm here for a different reason. I'll show myself out
LOL you got hacksmith beat all the time on far less budget You need to find someone who knows chemistry there is little reason why you can not make some sort of web launching rig that creates the entire strand  Material sciences have come a long way  As far as this launcher goes you could make a second 1 shot swing shoot second set and swing from it doubling your distance while air born LOL
2:25 crossover we didn’t expect coming..😂😂 Nike Red
2:24
One of the problems with the mythbusters version of the hammer thing is that they tried doing it in a former aircraft hangar,  the walls in those are very strong
The nile red cameo was great 😂
♥🕷
Omg the motor sounds at the end reminded me of iron man when he first made the proper suits. I got goosebumps!
Onlyfans?
So fucking lit. Definitely the perfect foundation for a web shooter indeed. Great job man👏🏼
That looks so fun. Love your projects dude, keep that creativity going.
Need some UK shipping for the webshooter!
Amazing!
If we manage to make real webfluid imagine the possibilities
He uses YouTube for stuff he doesn't know
amazing
If only the web shooters were permanent
bro this could be a grappling hook
am I the only one wondering how this could be used to make an actual aot odm gear?? where's that
Use cu-
man this video is gonna be hype but I dont know why I didn't see this on my reccomended earlier
The nilered voice caught me off guard
You need to take over hacksmith industries 😂
Can you buy this in the uk
In this episode, Jlaser builds a gun gun
Make the flash ring that shoots out the suit
yes finally an upload, im so happy
JUST TURN INTO NILE RED FOR A SECOND OOPS  I WROTE IT IN CAPS TOO LATE
Wait over
Dude it even SOUNDS right!
Need one for other arm to attempt a swing to another swing. With angles imagine distance.
One thing that could take, not only this, to the next level, but the wall climbers as well is the artificial gecko skin. It's really insane the stuff it can do. However, I'm not sure how cost effective that would be as it may be very hard and/or expensive to get your hands on. It really is crazy seeing the progress you're making with this project though. You really are the closest person we have in real life to spiderman. Also the Spidey helmet is nice touch. It's when you wanna look sick, but safety comes first😂
You're literally the real life Peter Parker
i think this would work really well as the manouver gear  from attack on titan
make another one and your spiderman g
Bro made a lethal version of spiderman
Any chance you could ship to the UK? I would buy 2 of those things! Amazing work!
Your not far from becoming spiderman
Do a callab with zealous
I want to try this but it seams way to expensive
The growth of your channel is off the charts 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LoL nilered
I legit thought he was Nile red for a sec
Craziest thing you have ever made and it's awesome
Awesome job, now how do you planning on taking on the challenge of Barry distances of objects and reloading light say you shoot 10 m then you shoot 20 m how are you going to handle having enough rope without having the knowledge of how far away is it?
can you make nightwings taser stick
This could be a Batman grappling hook too
I'm in my 40s and this still made me happy as a child to see. I'd love to see a follow up where you have 2 and complete a mid-air transition from one swing to another.
One day, you're going to perfect your spiderman tech, and hacksmith will perfect their iron man tech. On that day, I will be able to die happy.
Try to make odm gear from attack on Titan
Hes gonna unlock persistent swinging soon
Well you did not Email me but used my idea everyone who looks at this comment this was my idea😢
Omg so excited to watch this!
Can you make the hook shot from the legend of zelda?
You almost have a kinda first spider man suit kinda how every spider man has a starter design suit with different looks and webshooters
Just wear a back brace cause swinging at high speeds will cause you back to get extended and might break your back
Good luck using your phone or wallet with that thing tho
Now make Goblin’s glider, and Doc sock’s arms
Was going to buy a webshooter, but you don't ship outside of the US. So thats a shame :/
Nice job, now mount it to both wrists and make the webs easily disposable
MAKE WOLVERINE CLAWS AND THAT WORK LIKE THE SHOW THAT YOU CAN TOGGLE AND THEY GO BACK AND UNTOGGLE AND GO OUT
Is that a nile red cameo I hear?
He needs those shock absorbing shoes from portal if he wants to swing into a wall and stick.
Ordered one of the web shooters! *cough* for my children’s *cough*
HE HAS TOOK SPIDERMAN IRL TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL PROPS TI HIM , YOH SHOULD CREATE A SECOND ONE I YOH WANT
hooray
You are the living embodiment of "TAKE MY MONEY"!!!!
Why are you and hacksmith the chanel's whose leader is inspired by marvel hero. For him it's iron man and for you it's spiderman.
Make a mini machine that sets the glue on the top of the web 🕸️ like a gun so when you are about to shoot you set it and the glue will be at the tip of the web and then shoot
Nilred cameo bruh
Yoooo your literally like a vigilante in the movies now your like iron man but spiderman if you know what I mean like iron spider man if spider man had no powers lol
this is epic earned a like
Really cool And close.isnt there a way to shoot a little tube wich contains some kind of glue remover? Than you can put the tat trap glue to the net, stick to whatever, push the glue remover through the tube into te net?
i feel like if you got someone who was good at chemistry they could probably take the genuine web idea a lot further, any chemistry youtubers out there?
Can you try to make dr stranges portal if sombody can do it its you
This guy is our spiderman
Now you gotta make 2 and try a double swing swing release and swing again
you need to seriously work with a company man do it look at there web shooters not even close and yours are sooo cheap
𝓑𝓮 𝓪 𝓼𝓾𝓹𝓮𝓻 𝓱𝓮𝓻𝓸 𝔀𝓲𝓽𝓱 𝓲𝓽.... 😅❤
Did I hear Nile Red? 🤔
now just combine it with those things you made to climb that building and you will be even closer to being a true Spiderman!
Peter Parker of our universe
Damn from lighters to this 🎉
One of these days he will build an actual iron man suit
You should add one to the other hand so it  makes it where you can swing twice😂 and it will look more “spider-many”
You might need motion sensors to detect things around you, a la Spidey Sense. Just put my order in and looking forward to my shooter's arrival. Have you ever tried a freeze gun using liquid nitrogen (or helium, which would be colder)? I imagine copper pipes might be required as well as a small cannister to contain the liquid gas, maybe with a spray nozzle for expanded coverage.
Bro does the  webshooter have shipping on India
Need and Peter combined 😂
If by this moment you were not already contacted by the Mossad.. I dont know what they are doing.  What you do is truly amazing, as "silly" as it might seem!
make mithril from  lord  of the rings
How comes you're not referring back to other youtubers? Like how you even clipped Nile Red's voice?
be mature be mature be mature be mature-
basketball ball that can score everythime
I can not wait for the day that you upload a video with actual slim web shooters that you can swing from 🔥
this man is future of the science
Omg ive got that web shooter
super saiyan transfomations+aura
Now all yu need is a second one and your spider man
I have made a web shooter but I can’t swing with it
Wowww Amazing - If he makes two, he can definitely do a double swing
he needs to make another one and add more shots so he can swing more than ones i loved this vid
Can you make a tutorial on how to make the retractable webshooter?
He looks a buff Andrew Garfield
Pls make home that flies
Make spider sence
Absolutely amazing! Might have to cop one of those web shooters!
bro was that Nile red
I might have an idea for the next video. Try to combine every single project that is about spiderman. Like put all of them together and make a complete spidersuit that can shoot webs,stick to walls so that you can climb them and it self tightens.
So awesome I love it
Microbots from big hero 6
Make the iron spider man suit and add two pieces of tech that is from the movie
can you make a spider man mask that senses danger
The web shooter for sale Is really cool but I tried to Buy it but it didn't shipped to Canada ):
an automatic pb&j maker
Uhh, retitle this video The Bat Cable.
bruhh at 2:20 i was like he sounds like nile red rn but the voice change
he needs to sell some of this stuff to the government
Last piece: make a second one, and try to shoot a web, swing, and while still swinging on the one web, shoot another web to swing from
Could you make a james bond car?
when you combine the 2 chemicals I thought you were tom holland in spiderman homecoming in the scene where he made webs in chemistry
Ahhhhhh
I love the determination to figure it out.
can you get the web shooters in the uk??
bro hacksmith hire this guy
now make smt that can make ur leg 2x strong and 2x fast!
He is so smart it's insane
I can't still get my head around the fact that this is probably the best creation he has ever made, but I wonder why don't you just make a second one for your other hand 🤔
Can you make the blades of assassins creed
This is very Spiderman Noir.
Make black panther retractable claws
You should make the spider man mask that tony stark gives peter parker that has like the holograms with like a spider man voice assistant built in the mask I think
awesome
AUTO AIM SLING SHOT
You should check out veritasiums video on artificial gecko skin, something similar could maybe be an alternate less destructive solution
Do you think it will be possible for us to make it? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Its been quite a long time l missed your vi deos😢
helicopter swinging
Next  Shoot Stick Swing  Release Repeat
Now you just gotta bio-engineer a radioactive spider to bite you!
this man is the first step for making our childhood real, let's see if would make him spider-tingling tech
Video idea, you go on Holiday to somewhere secluded, and bring along your top 5 best projects, and we just have a montage of you having fun with them
It looks like a 2050 Spiderman with all of the gadgets! So cool!
A pen that can shoot the tip off but the tip sticks to walls and is a camera
E
The Nile red reference 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Now all he has to do is figure out how to make Peter tingle
you should make a thought to video converter
hey an idea from me for 2.0 version your web shooter is perfect but what it is lacking is swinging what you can do to improve is: wear two webshooters and each webshooter has two webs which you can swing from now to make the release system fast what you should do is when you press the button of the webshooter it and when it lauches the cord and sticks to the wall when you swing and mid air press the button of the other webshooter it launches and also cuts the other cord now if you have 4 webs it will be like crazyyy
Heck yeah I think you’ve done it the best compared to any other YouTuber and made it pretty compact
Next video: We are trying to fight crime like spider-man, but since we have no super powers, we are going to use guns
when i initially saw this i thought it looked like ODM gear from attack on titan
So is it possible to have to of them  so you can swing in succession?
I have been dreaming of this forever. This was amazing, and looked incredibly cool! I am starstruck.
I love how he shows us the failed experiments as well for more experience and explaining
I think it’s great the outfit you were wearing looks kinda like the first one he wore for his wrestling/fight match in the very first movie
I liked the quad glue web idea and if you could make them with a rope in the middle then it will stick better and make it stronger or make them spin tightly so that they weave themselves into a rope.
You are ultimately great dude. One day you will scceed perfectly to make this
2:25 bro became Nilered
Is it just me or was that a nile red cameo👀👀
Thats absolutely amazing!
You should try using gecko material https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS0TuIPoeBs here is a videos about it.
YOU ARE LITERALLY BENDING THE LAWS OF SCIENCE!
Could you turn this same design into attack on Titan OEM gear
This is so sick. The next steps are to jump, shoot, stick, swing, release and stick to a wall...
Batman grapple gun next
is there anyway to ship to other contryes than usa
this guy literally will be spiderman in like a year
Great! Now you just need to get bitten by a radioactive spider.
AMAZING
Bro needs to mix all of his inventions into one. He would be an actual superhero
2:27 was that NileRed?
the line i was able to pull out some white goo was said by nile red
Jlaser should make a Tron bike for the upcoming movie
you should make gaurdians of the galaxy ship
After seeing you make web shooters, you should try making some working ODM gear from Attack on titan!
upgrade your flying iron man suit
Bro, with that thing you could make an awesome 3D manouver gear from Attack on Titan
I can’t wait to hear about this guy swinging through the streets and climbing buildings in a couple years
So you're basically immune to fall damage now
Can u make the bike from big hero six?
finaly new videp.. Thanks!!!!
What if you tried to make a video with Hacksmith
You need one for the other hand now.
Hey in your older videos  u made the fans ideas into reality so i have one for u (if u still do that) make the blades of chaos from God of war Ragnarok (try to make them like the game where the blade shoots out fire and once u throw it it easily comes back to you this is optional but if it is possible it would look ten times cool)
You could try having one on each arm and shoot the 2nd one at the end of the 1st swing
I wish it could have been portable and not that bulky so it could really be a !iny spider man webshooter
Bro amazing afford  you put make those video ,
Can u guys ship the web shooter to Qatar.
I love how his helmet had the Spider-Man paint job! This has got to be the closest you’ve ever gotten to be the famous wall crawler. Keep it up!🕷❤
have you considered looking into the artificial gecko skin that veritasium featured on his channel?
Yoo bro
Is no one gonna talk about his nile red impression
This is so cool!! I remember wishing for a fully funtional spider-man suit when I was 5. I'm very excited to see where this leads you.  I hope you can make some gloves that sticks to your "webs" really well with enhanced grip strength in the future. Good luck!
Man your obsessed with Spiderman like me
did nobody notices the nile red reference ?!?!
can you make a working lightsaber
Attach it with the grabbo:)
You and hacksmith are really going somewhere with your movie and comic inventions
You should combined your shrinking suit the wall climbers and the web shooters
I love the vid but I would love it even more if u would show the build process too
Bro what is that motor you used. It can be use to make a batman grapple gun. For real
we got a iron man and now a spiderman
He is the next spidy boy
Where did the Nile red sound come from?😂
beautiful😀
That's why there are holes in outer walls of my house
Anyone else notice the Nile Red voice cameo when he’s making nylon
2:15
The Web shooter doesn't ship outside the US ::((((
This is batman
Spider man is almost a reality!
Make a working Harry Potter broomstick
Truly impressed, this also reminds me of the Attack on Titan gear, that would also be a cool build!
Bro turned into Nilered
Put captain America’s shield
Looks like he's gonna need a new spare.
Now you just have to recreate a radioactive spider
“Dance monkey “Is so crazy
Combine this and the climbers with the spider sense thing Hacksmith made and some Parkour and we get the closest to real life Spider-Man
Amaaaaaazing. I love spiderman so this is soooo cooool. Do you think you will ever start shipping to Europe? I really love your channel and I have been looking for a good Web shooter for a long time!
make a grappling hook
PLEASE PLEASE PUT ONE ON EACH ARM
Hacksmith as Stark, you as Spidey. We need whole avengers
Neil red joke blowed me
try to make vibranium aka something that can take in force/ energy and release it
I ordered one!! I’ve been wanting a web shooter like this since I was a kid
Love the Nile Red reference lol
Honestly impressive. A more finalized rope climbing thing would be a neat project in itself. Make it like a video game where is scary fast maybe with without a drum. So it just pinches the rope between and idler and a textured powerd wheel or drum so you don't have to wind a drum up with the rope instead it's a pass through.
Wowzers
you just made a perfect batman grapling hook/gun!
This man is going to win every "the floor is lava" competition
tom holland has to see this
I wish we Canadians could get one of these lmao
Bro I have how you post once every three months
The design is pretty hUmAN. Jk
Agent 47 is watching this video
can you try and make a rc robot from the movie real steel
Make either a Shazam gauntlet or the wizard staff that allows you to shoot lightning from your   finger
Hey J! I've got an video idea! It would be cool if you try to make real bending like in Avatar!😅
here,we see history of the first ever thing that is closest to the real and actual spider-man
Yooo
2:25 that voice is definitely different or similar
The fact that we are so close to a real spider-man already. Imagine where we'll be in like 20 years
If hackamith industries is our ironman/stark tech your our spiderman 😂😂
Make the doom blade from Doom eternal
you should mount one to every arm, then you can swing like 4 times
2030: okay guys let’s become spooderman
make a disc shooter but when the disks land they release smoke
awesome man!! Hey somehow if it could be done by both the hands , you could actually swing and change ropes and hence keep swinging forward like SPIDERMAN
I’m scared of what’s next he can climb walls he can shoot webs what’s the only thing he’s missing. Not an uncle
Titan fall 2 jump kit
Since it pierced, it’s more like a hand attached grappling hook, which is just as cool
Jack and James ( hacksmith ) should definitely make a collab video
What about a Harry Potter wand next.
Make an Undertale sans gaster blaster cannon or a team fortress 2 sentry!
Who else hear NILE RED
You could combine everything you have about spiderman and make a complete suit
The army is taking notes after this one
Love the Nile reference
This is a great example of media inspiering and technology enabling
I’m in the uk 😔
I hope everyone realizes this is not Spider-Man. This is Batman’s grappling hook just on your wrist
10:34  I feel like this concept is better setup for 3D maneuvering gear. From Attack on Titan
Can I order the webshooter to India? please
i wish he jumped and did it midair
Imagine if he did another one so he could swing twice before landing. I can imagine some difficulties when timing the new shot with releasing the old one
Why don’t you make two so you can swing from one web to another just saying 😅
Did thus guy just make odm gear from attack on titan
2:25 wait that sounds like NileRed
Attack on titan kenny
You should definitely make two and get two swings
You've hit the point where you are hiding how you do stuff (the device the stabs into stuff lol) you are really innovating here I love it.
This feels more like a batman grappling gun, but it is still very impressive. Great job!
@JLaservideo  are u trying to create your own super hero universe
the way u trust that💀💀💀
you should make shredders gauntlet form TMNT
idea: put one on the other hand and fire that one after you fire the first, that way you can get 2 swings without needing to come down
You need to use this to make odm gear
Guys this ain't spider man, Spider man would never reveal his identity
Build the avatar glider
Hey what happened to your workshop? Did the city make you take it down?
I like the helmet look alot
that tire inside tho… rip
Bro is more advanced than hack smith 0-0
no joke, watching this before bed somehow influenced my dream, i dreamt i was spiderman xD it was a really strange feeling xD
Cool
YEEEES! still waiting for the spring ring!!!!
Very cool. I see it as more as ODM gear from attack on Titan. Use this design to make a working ODM gear
Im here for the history boys
Shadow the Hedgehog Hover Shoes!!!!!!!
👍😁
Web shooter ordered.  Another awesome video.  Watching this video made my inner nerd very happy.  Your web shooter is amazing.  I know this probably won't happen.  But I'd love to see you sell file packs of your plans for some of your inventions showing how to build them (particularly your wall climbers and these web shooters).  If buyers signed a legal release I would hope it would absolve you of any misuse.  This was an amazing video.  Thank you!
I really wonder if spider men in birthday parties will buy your web shooter to entertain the kids  It would be hilarious because I remember “spider man” telling us kids he wasn’t allowed to swing in the building when he came into the birthday party
2:25 didn't expect a nilered cameo 💀
Please try Attack on Titan's ODM gear
What the..... I just remember watching spider man when I was a kid and just thinking to get bit by a spider to become Spider Man, You made it True Keep Going Nothin is Impossibe
when i have kids im going to tell them this was spider man
You should build Miles morales Invisible cloak
This Guy doesn't need the Oscar, The Oscar needs him 😏😏😏
Make 2 and double w Swing
You literally have the best job
It might me expensive but we would be amazing if you had worldwide shipping
11:36 Mom: Go play with the neighbors kid the neighbors kid
yeahh nice job tony
as soon as I heard Nilered's voice. I laughed to floor
everybody gangsta until you have to stick to glass skyscrapers.
Coooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllll
Can you make odm gear from attack on titan
Bro i want that 😩😩😩😩
This guy can probably make a full ODM gear from Attack on Titan
i am so impressed! if i had enough money i would by 3 of those shooters,2 for the wrists,one to support you. keep it up!
This is amazing, everyone can tell how much work and effort goes into your project, and the fact that not many people have had as close of a working web shooter as you shows how determined and motivated you are. Keep up the good work
just a thought what would happen if he stuck the rat trap glue inside the suction cup? i think it would stick to lots of things.
Honestly Bro at this point just make odm gear from attack on titan
imagine him shooting this web on his enimies💀
Make ai like JARVIS
The hacksmith made a really cool dismounting mechanism a few years ago you should check it out
A gun that shoots drills that dig
all this with no special machinery, just imagine what u can do if u had what hacksmith industries have or do a collab with them. my man is the next stark
ifyou infuse this with batman gadget and booooom  you are the next bruce wayne
Imagine if you have one for each hand. That will be glorious.
Was that a NileRed reference?
Remember what you did with Hawkeye you put all the arrows in one case you should do that with all the webs you made Black one for Throughs one for metal i’m on for cement walls
I find the helmet looks much better than the mask given how it's more practical
2:24 Nile Red's voice..😂im dead
I would love to see two of them and u trying to swing twice
How does this not get more veiws???????
Ronans retractable sword
Make a odm gear for attack on Titan..
wow
Inspiring, well done!
Wow this is cool.....but i have a cool idea for the needle for relasing it self without loosing the rope  Its like a hook but controlled by an electromagnet ....when is on then the needle separates for 2 parts (or 3 ) and iff its off then closing to a needle form and you can pull it out 👍
AO spider
Make wings that can take you very high .if you fail then paint your car pink
Why aren't you working with the Hacksmith Industry?
Now we'll see the real spider man in near future 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Hi JLaser, I live in Nigeria and I'm trying to order a web shooter, but I don't see my country listed there, and i really want one.
Bro can you make BEN 10 omnitrix 😂   From 🇧🇩  আপনি বেন ১০ এর অমনিট্রিক্স বানাতে পারবেন
What about ya fans in AUS (FOR the web shooters)
You should make retractable wolverine claws
Sewey
I have an idea. Make 2 of those for both your arms and after you shoot the first one, you shoot the other one mid air and swing forward by releasing the first one. Would look super cool.
Bro
wait 'til the MCU sees this video Jake's gonna be the fourth spiderman
please upgrade iron man flying suit
“super glue seemed to be the best” *SNIFF* “it also sticks pretty well too” 💀 bros been sniffin glue
I want the spring ring so bad lol
Went straight to ordering myself one of those webshooters 😂 can't wait to mess around with it. Really love the idea future and past projects being available for purchase
This reminds me of Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
This is awesome! You should make an ODM gear from Attack on Titan!
Bruh what's next.....a space ship that can actually fly and go into universes and into the multiverse if that's even real? But nice job man
Alright now where’s mr beast to up the anti and have him swing across the top of a building after climbing it
We realy are in the futer
This. This does put a smile on my face
After 4- 5 years later we will have spider man. Great
2:26 Nilered Ah Voice
you should make another one and try to complete another swing thetll legitamately make you complete spider man
Bro you should do batman gear, it would be great
Instead of Web shooter he made odm gear from aot  You should make that now
Bro made links grappling hook and tried to tell me it's Spider-Man
make a plasma poper
put one on both arms
hover craft update?
2:25 he turned into Nilered XD
What is you made a Loki ice staff
You should add some boosters to your back, which could help you swing with a little bit more ease!
spring ring
You made an actual super hero level grappling hook. Paired with the wall climbers I’m wondering about the stealth implications lol
lol nilered
can you try to make amini plane please you can make jetpacks and hoverboards why not a plane🙂
This is super impressive. You're hitting the technical intricacy/build quality of the Hacksmith but with the more understated/casual design breakdown of Colin Furze and it's amazing.
Apart from the little downward pointing arrow sticker, What is the difference between Your web shooter and the ones on Alixpress..?
What do you have to study to do all of this. I really want to make something cool like this one day
The web shooter of net can help police
this is so cool .but you just have one bullet😅
Make one for each hand and swing and release from one then shoot the other one
THE KING IS BACK
This is the type of content we need .
Make iron mans arc rector that can power eny device and shoot a laser
first ironman and now spidy.... bro im so happy i get to be in this world where i can see a dream come true for millions of people
WOW Increíble, Cuando lo juntaron con la herramienta para pegarse a la pared fue ver un sueño hecho realidad
🔥🔥👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Do the same at batmans grappling gun
That was sick bro!!! That’s literally the closest we’ve got to real life Spider-Man that I’ve seen, Climb, shoot stuck swing release
Now, the next challenge creating one for the second hand plss
Can you make the Fusion sword from final fantasy or a self transforming  robot for your next video ideas
lol red nile be like "i was able to pull out some white glue"
frisbee, frisbee
Awesome dude,you made the impossible possible YOU ROCK🔥🔥🔥 It would also be dope if you made the ODM GEAR from the Attack on Titan anime
It doesn’t just shoot webs it has enough power to injure a bad guy btw you will p penetrate them
bro really made odm gear from aot on accident
Best of luck. Hope that some day all your inventions are integrated into one iron-spider suit.
Your Nile Red impression at 2:25 is on point dude 😂.
You're actually getting closer to literally being real life Spider-Man
I can’t wait for a real Spider-Man you got everything
next time get two of deez and swing across longer
miles morales venom punch
Radioactive spider be like: ayo what da f***
Lmao had nil guys voice, I forgot the name damn.
You basically made aot gear and called it web shutter, add a little shotgun on top and that’s it
Bro 6 years into people trying to make a spiderman web shooters and this is the best ones
I know this would be hella super hard but now u can make it for the other hand and now u can swin continuesly
I think you should have made this a series. Discussing and making each type of shooter! Great video
is there going to be shopify shipping outside of US, would really want to get a springring or smth
Use gecco tape in it
yeah you should make a ant man retractable helmet 🎉
Make the water bomb the Namor and his people uses in black panther wakanda forever
Nilered 😆
This is awesome. You should hire a gymnast, acrobat, or parkour person, some thing like that to do the tricks. They can maybe swing off of the rope and land like spider
jlaser love spider man
Let's just pray this guy doesn't turn into a supervillain xD
use chat gpt to make a jarvis enhanced iron man helmet (or you cant do that?)
the fbi shoiuld hire this guy
next time, make it come out of your forehead.
Sooo... Peter Parker is not spider man huh
I'm so happy you finally did it😁
Just gotta say, I really appreciate your dedication to the web shooter projects. It’s so cool to see what awesome designs and functions you come up with. That net shooter was especially neat, keep up the good work!
Assasins Creed hiden crossbow ?!😁
Would loved to have bought a webshooter but you don't seem to ship to Australia!
TONY STARK COULD BUILD THIS IN A CAVE WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS
12:55 and a punctured spare tyre! 16:22 you need to show this video to Adam Savage and throw some shade on him!
It can also be use as batmans weapon. Amazing!
Bro this is insane, would love to see you use two shooters and use the second one while already suspended to get even more like spidey 🤙🏼
I didn't expect NileRed to be here, lol
Can you build a mind reader
Ok since this can kind work, how about a Batclaw from Batman. It can either be from the one in the Arkham Games or the Batman 2022 movie since it acts more like a gun and has a reload that can possibly work with this too
What does shopping cost to denmark? Im looking to buy a webshooter i just dont know How much shipping cost it would be a great help if somebody could tell me What it cost or where i Can see What it cost😁
The most lethal wed shooter ever 😅
I would love to buy the captain america shield that you made😊😊
Can you make something related to Daredevil?
can you make watch dog legion spider bot which can do high jump and fast
Didn't understand a word you said, but Nago-chita is so cute i just couldn't click away
Dude you have got to do Batman's grapple gun next
Bro I think you have the chance to became the next tech monster by buliding this things because hacksmith just baild on this kind of things and that's just sad but keep going man and hope hacksmith comeback to combit with you
Why you didn't upload videos for Such a long time
so cool! if you would only tell axactly how you did it...
hi nica video and can you please add delivery to south africa
THAT. WAS. INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG LETS GO OMG BRO THIS IS AWESOME!!!
MAKE AN INVISIBLE SUIT!
Please add shipping options to France for me !
I this type of web shooters can also be used on creating a real life ODM gears from Attack On Titan!
It's not a web shooter it's a grappling hook😂
This is so amazing! There is so much effort in every single prototype that is just crammed into a 10 second clip, I can't even imagine how long that must have taken!
I saw Nile reds video ages ago so that bit was funny
This is sick
this is like one step away from 3DM gear from Attack on titan
Make optimus primes duel energon bealds from transformers
Frisbee!
Now I He needs TWO
When I'm not broke I'll buy one
15:39 - Yay, bonner-hook Now I understand why my grandpa wore those puffy pants
So sick, now do two swings!
Pls make katana that can shrink and transform into a knife
Can be used to fight bad guys as well
Boy wakes up to find he can shoot white sticky substance out of his body💀💀💀
I love you spider web shootr
Will the webshooter ever be released worldwide? It's currently only in the US :(
So cool! But could you try make another version using the gecko grip technology?
For as cool as the spiderman vibe is, this feels remarkably close to the Batman grapple-gun. Quite possibly the best recreation of it so far in fact!
This has been my dream since I was young enough to speak Spider-Man was the first word I could ever read or write  I'm so glad something like this was finally made Live my childhood dream for me
That why I love your videos
He is back at last I missed this guy
You should make another one for the other hand so you can swing twice
ya know what you made as the final product is very VERY similar to the ODM gear from Attack on Titan. You should definitely use this same build, with some additional pieces to create ODM gear IRL. Also somehow if your able to pull back the hook with some function on the build then you'll be able to really achieve ODM gear.
Congrates u did made a real grapling gun
You probably need something that takes the nail back to you when you release Because you can’t swing around more than twice with this one.
that mechanism reminds me of attack on titans
YES!! How many people can say they climbed a wall, shot a web and swung from it! Thanks for picking up where myth-busters left off, this definitely had more potential. Or like that episode where they tried to make a car take a 90° turn going 60mph, they tried grappling hooks but never tried adding a massive moving counter weight that could be fired mid turn canceling out the inertial weight of the car.  I suppose the same thing could also be achieved firing a cannon out the opposite side from your turn.
Nilred collaboration 😂
10 hr ago
Ha the NileRed reference
yeehaw lets go new Laser vid!
Hopefully I can order this tomorrow before it sells out lol
It should have two charges, and you should have one for each hand, so you can do 4 consecutive swings. That's the ultimate spiderman!
Make the hulkbuster!!😮
I dont think you could swing on a window though...
Make a banana which shoots lasers
that's some NileRed right there lol
Love the NileRed and Undecided easter eggs :)
Yo NileRed. I remember watching that video.
you guys should make hicupps inferno sword from How to Train Your Dragon!! :)
You could make something that gives you spider-sense By the way do you ship internationally?
OH and nice haircut
Bravo! Bravo!  That was insane!!  I think it's amazing that I can buy my own web shooters!  Thank you JLaser. ;)
it's super close to be the Batman's grapple gun
Ooohh my gosh, this is epic!! Great work.
bravo
Cool! To one step EVEN closer, all you have to do is learn to backflip!
most epic thing ever!!
2:25 was that nile red!! lol
second shooter and this goes kinda hard this the wallclimbing :D
PLEASE MAKE NANO BOTS FROM BIG HERO 6 I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR IT SINCE YEARS!!!!!
He’s this Universes Spider-Man
GET OVER HERE!
can you imagine in like 10 years from now and there are real spider-people everywhere?
great! now put another one on your other arm
Jake i have watched you grow & grow over the last idk,5 years 6 not sure how long I've been watching you,you are the type of innovator that the world desperately needs,continue to grow & advance bud i couldn't be happier for your success from a fellow engineer 😁👍
Please sell the lonely frisbee
Add this to the wall climbers
Making odd things shoot is specialty.💀💦
Too make ligit like webs there probably is like a scientific synthetic spider web that could actually hold human weight
OMG if you make two
YOO NEW UPLOAADDD good idea as well
This guy really could be spider man at some point, sure it takes a lot of work but it’s like bringing a childhood dream to life
Its more looks like batman grapnel gun
Do the web shooters on ur website also swing cuz then I might buy one
Love Nile just popping in randomly
This video is the reason I pay for internet. Just had the best time of my life ❤❤
The Nile red callout.
he said "goo" more times in 3 minutes than I did in my entire life.
Please add the flame thrower ring🙏🙏🙏
2:25 the nile red voice caught me off guard
Insane in the membrane insane In the brain
Gotta make the web shooters shipping world wide or at least to Canada
En español por favor
Can u combine the flying iron man suit that comes to you and the web shooter
I like the way you apply the "no risk, no reward" quote, you really take huge risks to make us entertained. We appreciate it and we love you Jake.
Bros acting like nile red 2:16
JL Video I challenge you to create... The Whistling Birds from The Mandolorian! (if you can do it of course)
write equivalent SI units
psa: spider-man is dead game theory
This guy could easily become the first artificial spiderman
I gotta say you really feat in with other spider-man actors
Can I assume you are going to get with the YouTube science boys Allan, Will, Petter, and the back door scientist for Mark 2? Maybe one on each arm to swing from one to another
This is like The Boys with Spider-Man
It'd be cool but not cost effective to add something that clips the rope so you could do a swing over something with the momentum without having to time the unspool
Can you make thor's hammer with a magnet that you can lift just by deactivating the magnet with your fingerprint???
Oh my god, he did it HE IS FUCKING SPIDERMAN FOR REALS
Дайте ему денег и времени и бесконечный двигатель у вас в руках (можно ещё камеру)
I found you from the phish tank podcast, I havent been disappointed since
Yo I haven't seen your vids In so long😢
You need too Make to 2 web shooter to swing another place. Shoot web and release and another hand shoot web and release
hello
i think you should combine your self tightening suit, wall grippers and this web shooter to be Spiderman like legit, and i love your work because of you i have started to make my own projects and things
Make a working transformer please!
Been a while since I've seen your videos and im so happy you've finally returned
Hey jLazer would it be possible to ship the web shooter to United Kingdom?
Joel creates is definitely having emotional damage after watching this video
THIS IS AMAZING SPECTACULAR EVEN ULTIMATE UHHH UHH
1st time I ever buy anything from a youtuber lol😅
dude is both spooderman and iron man
Man recreated the lunchroom scene in Spiderman 1 at 13:18
with that you can make the odm gear in aot
It would be sick if you build the ten rings
Want to buy two webshooters, but im from Germany😢
[Nilered] 🤣
Try to do this from a building to another building in public and see what do they do
Portable noose
Dude here's a tip from an idiot either get stunt training or hier a stunt professional, as man your future projects might need them, keep it up!! And do whatever you want to!
If Spiderman randomly appears in the next few years i would not be surprised.
Incredible talent! I love your videos!!!
Alright I ordered a web shooter. Too cool not to. Printing up some Herotech ones too to compare.  Amazing work as always!
make another one and two times using it.... also try making them reloadable ukwim?
Let's try to get Tom Holland or Marvel to see this truly amazing
Pt 2? Multi shot, lighter weight if possible and obstacle course
BROOOOOOOO THIS IS THE ESCENCE OF INSANITY AND EPICNESS!!!
Bro is living in our dreams <3
this is the COOLEST thing I've ever seen ngl
Bro , something from the anime like a rasengan or chidori , or whatever you like from the anime 'naruto' 💫
make something that lets you lift up really heavy stuff just like the hulk!
Damn man mixing the wall climbers with the web shooter was insane lol. If I knew being an engineer was this cool when I was like 16 I would have tried a lot harder in school lol. Engineering as a whole needs a PR team lmao.
Now combine all your Spiderman gadgets and become spider man.
You can only stick on wood
Man this so cool!
maybe you could use a bunch of smaller nails instead of two large nails to minimize the damage
Try making a full functioning iron man suit
Man turned into nilered
How do I shot web? JLaser shows how! ;)
You had me at 4:17 so i bought two of them for each wrist 😭😭
Nile red, Nile red
this is more like batman
This guy is gonna be the future of construction or military
i dont have dollars i have pesos
Next video: wall climbers and web shooter have a baby and make suction web shooter
Hey, long time no see! Great to see you again. I have no doubt this one will be another banger!
Lopen viedios❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can i buy the webshooter in the netherlands?
Getting really close to Attack on Titan 3d maneuver gear!
Now make one more for the other hand. Its really so cool..
Is that how silly strings are made?  They used to make spiderman toys with those canisters till 2010's and market then in comics as merchandise, they still make em? Still pretty neat content 👍
i think if you make a mechanism that can alternate between hooks, like, two on each arm, and it cuts one off after you shoot the 2nd out, you might really be able to swing properly
When is spring ring coming out
Mans set out to become spider man, accidentally builds the Ascension guns from Star Wars The Clone Wars/The Bad Batch in the process, 10/10
Ayee that's awesome. I'd love for you to make the batman wing suit from the batman 2022. Really just it turning from a cape into a glider but don't try gliding too dangerous
Can you make Ghost Riders fiery bike and the tires are actually on fire.
Artificial spider cence next?
By far the most tasteful/functional take on a web shooter I have ever seen, well done.
2:25 jiz
Can you please sell the bouncing captain America shields on your new website?
Why was there a random audio of NileRed at 2:25 lmao
I got a good idea make a sheld that retractable and it turns invisible when it retracts into a big sheld
Let's just make two of them  Double swing
Can you make all your inventions to one
maybe a hook sorta thing at the end of the nail would help it to stick even better, and if it would be possible to design a mechanism that leaves the rope slack while a button is pressed, then holds it tightly when the button is released, you wouldnt have to reel it in in the first place
Actually you have the capability to make a full Spiderman suit with your toys like you can make a Spiderman armour like the Spiderman knight it was a version of Spiderman you can combine every single thing of Spiderman
3:40 NO NOT THE POSTER
this is so cool
YOU SHOULD MAKE CAPTEN Cold's gun
major breakthrough. nicely done. you're so close. you're gonna be pissing off J Jonah Jameson in no time. i look forward to a future where i buy JLaserTech hero gear for my costumed vigilante son in law.
this dude gets military contracts and becomes actual iron man
does the j stand for jank?
Just bought a web shooter!! SO EXCITED THIS IS SO COOL
This guy is really dedicated
Mark rober would be proud
Meanwhile His warehouse when it rains...(⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)
Mr Stark?
Hi I didn't fully watch the video but I got a question or more like an idea, I've been watching your videos throughout my tenth, eleventh and twelfth year of school and I was always wanting to lend an idea or two so I got a thought what if you used an electric magnet type of web that connects but when you re activate it then it'll disconnect and have a system to pull it back and all you would hopefully need is a power supply like an electric Spidey, thanks for it if you read this and I hope you have a great day
you missed the opportunity of doing the coolest test of jumping off something and shooting it mid air to see if it could catch you from hitting the ground or one shot catching your from jumping off something then releasing and shooting the second one mid air to catch you a again you it would have been risky and dangerous but nothing too bad that it would be off the table to try it could be made safer just like all the other tests love your video dude keep up the great work
You are the most inspirational of all superheroes because you make it real!
Why not use the nail to slow people down?
You are the real Super Hero with real Super power🥺
You are amazing
You should find a way to code the motor so that it will take up slack line and release line automatically like it'll release line when more than your body weight is applied. Great work
Beautiful I want that
See that's the reason we subscribed you keep growing buddy😍
Next video title : I BECAME SPIDER-MAN WITH MY WEB-SHOOTER AND MY WALL-CLIMBERS!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome
You can practice with both hands
I'm speechless, this is so cool
This man deserves a camo in a Spiderman movie 🎬 Its literally that bad... 👏 👏 👏
JLASER UPLOADED FINALLY
I need to attach that to your wall climbers then you could really become Spider-Man
Guess who just impulse bought web shooters!
Sick build dude.
to be honest you should give that frisbee idea for free
I know the right materials of how to make real web fluid!  1. Salicylic acid  2.Methanol  3.Toluene  4.Carbon tetrachloide  5.Potassium carbonate  6.Ethyl acetate  7.Ethanoic acid  8.16 grams of refillable C02 cartridges 🧪🥼
Hey, try to make one perfect suit with all your spiderman inventions in it, and use that for a super cool obstacle course!
You should look into artificial gecko skin!!
Selling the webshooters is such a great idea, didn’t even finish the vid and i was thinking “take my money now”! Keep up the great work! Excited to see my webshooter come in 🕸️
nice transition fitting in action lab in there but his voice is just to recognisable even with the helmet on btw great vid love ur work
This is awesome. I remember stumbling across your channel around the time you made the web shooters and enjoying the creativity. You've come so far! I love your maker mind. I bought a web shooter in celebration (:
Should release a Spiderman highlights video. Would be easier to share with friends
can't believe you really got Nile Green for a cameo
That's a big step closer and inspiring thankyiu
I have always wanted a wrist mounted rope dart. Scorpion from Mortal Kombat first got me into them but wrist mounted recoiling gripping fire rope would be dope.
THE NILRED REFERENCE MADE ME LAUGH SO HARF
maybe you mix 2 superheroes together??
Man's made the world's most dangerous nail gun, mission impossible esque spy rippling equipment, and a toy in one video
2:25 not the Nile Red cameo
Why women live longer than men
COMBINE THE TWO SPIDERMAN VIDEOS! USE THE WALL CLIMBER WITH IT! YOU MUST!
Bro gots a double barrel shot gon on his arm 💀
Fuggin' great job kid! Really impressive demo. My jaw hit the floor when you did the web swing off the wall, that was super cool! I ordered my web shooters, looking forward to trying them out!
I WANT THAT BOUNCY FRISBEE!!!!!!
ODM gear
U could try gecko mimic skin
Spoiler alert: he will stop a speeding train in 2 years
I want that thing!!!!
honestly with the reeling capabilities, this is the perfect Batman grappling hook
You should make another one for your other arm then you can swing and keep momentum
That was amazing keep it up one day you will be spider man, I love your vids
bro the web shooter only in america pls we need this in the au  also love the vid keep going
no international shipping :(
Hacksmith made a bat gun which is better than u'r web shooter do check out their video
and u forgor the releese mechanIsm
u said eerything it only work for wood
Hats off your dedication 😃🕸️
Homie made a hand held grapppling hook
Make a nothere so you can do 2 swings
Ok now we need you to make the ODM gear from Attack on titan Using this concept That would be insane
Can you do moon girls punching gloves
He's super underrated
Honestly,……. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME ODM GEAR NGL
Goals: spiderman Results: batman
Man, you gonna be the next iron man irl
O M G 🎉 😍 this is so cool amd when you did upside down 😭🔥👑 and wall climbers make this even more good 👍
It feels like this guy is 100% actually trying to become spiderman. Minus the powers that he's not going to need with all that exercise.
if you add a quicker release and a second one with an eisier reload, full swinging action is just around the corner
Bros literally the long lost son of Tony Stark
Do green arrow quivering bow
This man is the real life Tony Stark/Peter Parker
This is insane!! For another vid you should make a second launcher and double swing one after the other!!
man's gonna become a real life version of the secret agent with all the crazy gadgets you wanted as a kid. he'll be robbing the top security bank vaults in no time
14:39 lowkey looks like odm gear
use the same thing for batman grapple gun
This is so amazing
make special shoes to go fast like the flash
This man is gonna be the real Spidey
that is just AMAZING. Some might call you the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN
Here me out, Dr. Fate helmet and suit
Guys in the next 5 years if you see someone swinging/climbing/flying in your city you know who it is
With you and the Hacksmith, I can hear the endgame theme already
me watching this: memories
this is definately a prototype spiderman could have made
This is absolutely great! You should make one for both arms so you can swing from one to another.  like Spidey.  Props if you can do two sings and a backflip combo..
I'd love to see the Fling Rings in the shop! I've been looking forward to buying one ever since the Captain America shield video
Since we're on the Spider-Man craze, it would so cool to make a haptic feedback suit that would make it so that you have the spider sense.  I think the best way to go about that would be to use LiDAR cameras/sensors that detect motion or incoming obstacles.  Maybe try to see if it works by blindfolding yourself and have the crew throw stuff at you xD.  I did something like this for a project, but only had a LiDAR sensor on a pair of glasses with motors that would buzz when the sensor detected something.  Great video as always, you're truly fulfilling everyone's childhood dream of being Spider-Man!
Can you make a dead space plasma cutter plz
next step is to try retract the webs
Wow man this stuff is wild next we need spidy sense and be the real life spider man
I need one of those web shooters
i swear this man is a cornerstone in an era of youtube engineering that’ll go down in history
wow just wow
Yes new video
1:26 I think you just weigh over 600 lbs so you fell. But seriously this is another great video, you have to go back to the skyscraper with Mrbeast again!
Cool
Im very happy and exited, imagine if this guy made this whole thing in his garage, what could a company dedicated to this type of things be able to do, jlaservideo you are the evolution of humans, literally
I love the nile red cameo
Make the OTM gear from Fortnite
2:26 💀   NileRed jumpscare
Im crying in happiness.
I have the web shooter that has the magnet
Bro this is batman anyways good
What was the file for the 3d printed grapple u made a few years ago?
Bro is going to be an actual superhero
I love watching your videos! Also Don't use God's name in vain (Exodus 20:7). Don't curse, cursing is bad. PLEASE REPENT. (this if for everyone).
Make fire sword
That’s freaking amazing dude! You are such an inspiration! You should make Raya’s sword!
this is so awesome! bought those web shooters immediately
Imagine he adds the iron man suit to his website that be crazy
He needs two of them
Its almost more like the 3d maneuver gear from attack on titan
The menace spider man is unleashed check back on daily bugle next time
No way you got Nile to just say that 😂
Please make the speed racer jump jacks!!! Would be so cool to see
Dude this is the most insane thing I have ever seen, its like my childhood is slowly coming to life, and bro this multiverse for spider-man is an engineered spider-man. Instead of chemical webs, we have mechanics. This is insane, great job, I love this amazing content!
Idea: Attack on Titan ODM gear
You should rename the channel to "Becoming Spiderman"! Seriously impressive engineering!
make a nuke
I think instead of spideys web it is more similar to an attack 9n titan odm gear. It would be great if u really did that ..
Make an ultralight wood airplane and fly it.
just amazing
You make this more like the 3D maneuver gear from AOT
Shipping to Australia?
At this point he should have a Cameo in spider verse as our universe's Spidey
No chance you’ll see this, but please, please don’t try to prioritize quantity over quality on these projects. I, and probably so many other people in your audience would be happy to wait longer for videos if you can manage insane things like this. Thank you for the videos, they’re great!
Please make the shipping go to Canada
This might not work but what if you just use contents of soap or use the liquid soap
You can write a code and connect it to the motor to automatically reel in to a specific tension in the rope....just sayin'
bro accidentally created odm gear
stan lee would be so happy about this
JLaser is the GOAT!
Need a spring in your pipe to cushion the fall and send you back up when you swing
please make the ODM from Attack on titan
If you attached a motor to the sticker, you could pull it out more easily
so cool
have you seen the scientists creating gecko tape might want to look into that
Make a sword that can transform into another sword like the zonpoctos from bleach(anime)
NileRed the goat lmao!
Testing your webshooters/Sticky powers and accidentally pulling the thing you're sticking to off is like a classic Spidey origin moment
A real hero, you’re creative genius is insane. You’ll definitely go down in history for the things you’ve invented!
The Nile red sound clip goes hard LMAO
Yesssss finally a new video
Good job jlaser🎉
You should make a revamped version that makes it a lot more efficient.
Awesome
That nail shooter one is definitely instant kill mode
The Nile red part got me good.. Haven't snorted so hard in days.
Imagine just going about your day when you see some guy in a spider man costume pulling dumpsters around with a magnet on a string
He made are dreams into a really this guy deserves more love
One day soon Jlaservideo will bring real spiderman into this world.
Hacksmith got a world record for first working lightsaber. Why not a world record for first working spiderman suit?
Hear me out make a second one or a upgrade and swing twice like Spidey
Very well done, I'm so impressed with this. Keep it up!
Who else kept expecting him to shoot a second web right after his swing?
You don't ship to Canada? rip
you should probably make a doc oc sun energy thing that floats like a superconductor at its critical temperature on a magnet, that would be really cool. (even a small version would be cool)               :) also, your videos are one of my favorite things to watch.
I think it’s is great and you have come so far. The only thing I’d suggest instead of unwinding the rope it to have a fast cutting mechanism because unwinding the rope looked a little slow and unnatural. Overall great job
Next he should put one of those on each hand, so he can swing twice instead of just once 😮
Give this man some likes 👍
Can you make a superhero gadget  that is a glove and has claws on each finger a grappling hook and then make boots with spikes on them and then a helmet that has a movable visor and last but not least make drones that he can control from his glove in the superheroes name is (Actually you can make it up)
you need to use something like PVC that isn't going to allow eddy currents to form which slows down the magnet when going through the tube.
You should make a second one to go on your other hand so you could shoot another one mid-air!
This is brilliant but i'd like to talk to whoever decided to shoot nails into a SPARE TIRE
Throw on another one on the other hand and you can do two swings.😄
We're finally coming full circle
HIs people are like: Go! spidey, Go! until his head goes like KABOOM
You could use a railgun like design using electromagnets to push a magnet in the web
add one more of the spidy glove to become the reel spiderman
Does the web slinger ur selling stick well (obviously not like the one in vid)?
❤❤❤❤finally
Imagine having one of those on each hand so that you can swing and shoot mid air
JLaservideo now you should make a second one and do a constant swing
Your videos are always above my expectation🙂🙂
What if you were to make some kind of automated bow? Maybe something like the explody dart you made in this video but instead rapid fire and still attached to the "web" aka string. Also a cool idea, it could be able to retract whatever it hits so that you can bring in multiple targets at once. seems like a horrible and incredibly fun idea to me.
We need to see you swing with one in each arm now
That was really Amazing man .
ya know if random youtubes can do this aswell as make real lihghtsabers grapple guns and jet packs   its a real wonder why some billionaire or even millionaire hasnt invested money into becoming a real life batman/ironman
You make real
Beautifully satisfying
Aaaaannnnd..... is your uncle ok?
Next up the spider sense or technology that is able to mimic it, its actually important in how he swings since it helps him to know where he's shooting and if the material is strong enough for his weight in order to avoid injury  Edit everyone who sees this like it maybe he can pull it off put all 3 together and then we have a true real life spiderman
Make industuctble Hulk fists
Could you use that to make Scorpion's spear?
I love the last few on Spiderman!! I love it! you are so inspiring!
Did you hear about that company that made the gecko material? That can stick to anything on a molecular level. Might be worth it to look into.
You should make the hawkeye grappel system
When are you going to finish your falcon suit
Make edge of tomorrow exoskeleton
Make edge of tomorrow exoskeleton
Just an FYI, you can buy the webshooter he is selling on Amazon for the same price but without the branding. He didn't make it. He just threw his logo on it. Faster shipping too
I was thinking if you did the falcon like you did iron man with the fans
What solenoid valve did he use to control the pressure from the CO2 cartridges?
How about Tari's wrist band from Meta Runner
2:15 Nile red mode activated
I kinda feel like this is more like odm gear than it is web shooters which is rlly cool, would love to see you actually attempt to make odm gear
Would it be possible to split the winding for the two? If one can hold the weight each, maybe you can hit one, swing/lift, then fire the other off, make tension then release the first and make an effective chained swing
Insane!🤯
You're the real Spiderman 😍😍😍
The next step is some kind of multiple shot capacity in terms of propellant, using a high speed reeling system to return the line to the launcher and reseat it into the barrel, and gecko pads with something that pulls them inwards upon impact so the pads stick there properly, I think each pad would probably be quite large for it to hold an average adult man's weight plus the centrifugal force of a fast swing speed. But this is already epic and you're only getting closer with each project and iteration and redesign. The gecko pads or gecko tape is still a ways off given how difficult it is to manufacture and thus its justifiably very high price, so its cost-prohibitive, but maybe you'll discover something easier to make for this application. I'm always amazed at what you make!  Edit: Ah it turns out the gecko pads are already kinda sold as Nano Tape and Gecko Tape, it seems the former uses no adhesives either, its not that expensive, but the everpresent problem of cleaning it off often in not-pristinely-clean environments still exists, so subsequent shots of the launcher would result in weaker and weaker adhesion until it can't hold the force of the swing. A tape the area of an index card they say can hold up to 700 pounds, at least in the direction of the pull, which is to say a tape on a wall pulling down which squishes the microhairs and allows more area for the van der Waals forces to stick and thus hold more weight. In the case of a web shooter pad it would probably be a strong spring pushing back against the surface while the pads all around it slap over the surface and some kind of lever that pushes harder the more tension is on the line to make it stick stronger and then just release when the line goes slack. That might work, but I don't know how since I have a headache and can't think beyond vomiting up ideas onto my keyboard XD
Fffggggh
Awesome!!!
Ordered a web shooter! 3-4 business days!!🎉🎉
16:30 is the montage
I would buy those shields those are sick the captain America ones
it started to sound like a nile red video there
I feel like with this design you could make a pretty awesome ODM gear from Attack on Titan
*Hello there!*
with the advancements you've made in web shooters , I wonder if you could make lupin iii's wristwatch grappling hook
Bravo, man!! You just keep raising the bar on what content on YouTube can be!
You should use the one with the net for some fishing
Make an instant Toilet that if you are in a bad place you just throw it down and blows up in to a toilet 😅
Man is insane basically spider man at this point. The skills that he has is incredible stuff.
Please make an epic lair with cool stands for all your inventions. Also combine all your inventions into one and become a real life superhero
why i saw people selling those Web Shooters before
2:25 NILE RED?!
dude just left mythbusters in the dust good job dude
Now hes just gotta become peter parker
Now he needs to combine wall climbing and swinging
I already ordered my web shooter! I really hope to see the Spring Ring available sometime soon.
PLEASE MAKE RASAGAN FROM NARUTO AND ADD IT TO YOUR SHOP!!!
Hear me out… electric webs that can taser people? I say you should also try making it light-able.
This looks more like attack on titan ODM gear than spider web
It’s been great to see your Chanel grow over the past few years. We’re all so proud of how far you have come.
i have a question not to be sarcastic but did it take you three months to make that
This is awesome, can’t wait for what’s next. Combination of all of the spider man projects? Maybe integration of Karen (that seems almost impossible though)
Who wants him to combine it with his wall climbers the next video
I love your videos!
“I was able to pull out some white goo” This was the voice of a YouTuber called NileRed, another amazing scientist
best part is if u shot a bad guy he would be dead
Next step: shoot a 2nd web while swinging on the 1st, and then release the 1st web.
Also I love the Nile Red reference
Grapple
Make star lord’s blasters
Time to make an ODM gear
Make guardians shield
That is so cool. Do you you think you could make some sort of telepathy device? I have always wanted to see someone make one.
Pair it with wall climbing shoes and gloves and the suit you made that changes
I'm so impressed with this it's like batman and spiderman can be real.
Iron spidey
I think this can be good for attack on titan.
Now you need 2 and need to switch arms while swinging
Lots of love from India 🇮🇳 ❤️
so much glue could u make some more higher tolerance parts?
now make 2 and swing from arm to arm
this dude is turning into spiderman in front of our eyes
if you want to make it better you can add 1 to each arm.  Now 2 swings
spot on nilered
Amazing!!
This looks like so much fun and now I'm trying to convince my mom that I need the smaller web-shooters for my birthday lol I wonder if you could use any of the methods used her to make IRL ODM Gear from Attack on Titan lol now that would be my dream to try out Plus spiderman has always been my favorite superhero lol
Bro I wish I could buy the web shooter but I live in the uk:(
hah i love that nilered reference
Love it
I like how you made a gun that fires after it hits its target
Fun Fact;this is also perfect for robbing a bank
bro added nilered
Make Batman's cape from the dark knight trilogy. The one that becomes stiff on passing current
I wish I had 60 bucks damn
Okay this is great and all, but why don't you try asking Spider-Man? if someone has web-shooters figured out it's gotta be him.
the government should buy those to easily catch people lol
What if you modified the nail to be ribbed, kind of like a fish trap?
You're the reason why your parents can't have nice things lol
Buying.
Best birthday gift ever.
Use ring shank nails
i think this would be better as the Vertical maneuvering equipment from AOT
dude your coming close to what i and probably a lot of people dreamed of for a long time i rly hope i can see the final wepshooter il stay and watch even if it takes you another 40 years xD keep it up man thanks for showing us that it can be possible your one step closer
Green Goblin suit
Nylon.. nylon.. 'Nile-on?'  🤣
9:07 noones acknowledging this front lever...
So awesome!!!!!
Rob a bank and use it in the vault
I hope you give me a web shooter because I been a subscriber for 4 years
At this rate Jay will be swinging in New York in 2030😀
And next on both arms? 🤔
So to summarize:  One web shooter doesn't work One works, but only on thick iron One works, but not on flat surfaces One is literally a gun with a rope tied to the bullet, which does immense property damage and probably doesn't work on stone And three leave behind some sort of trace which is difficult to remove.  It's possible that the only way to get this working would be to use a glue that responds to an electric charge. However, back in the real world, this is still very impressive. Congratulations.
You should make thor’s hammer that can actually fly back to you
watching you since you use to make lighter webshooters i have made them to 😭 now watching this video just makes me happy
i will say this is the closest thing to spiderman i have ever seen but if you bade it come out through the waist it would be attack on titan odm gear
Bro make a Rasegan or chidori from Naruto
Hey love your videos can you make a tron laser disk thing please
make the big hero 6 (mini black robot)
Brother..... we have to link up. I have been trying to contact you for years regarding a Department of Defense project. We must connect!
Everything you do is just so crazy, who else would or could build a web shooter like you can
I'm convinced that this guy is gonna invent warp drive and get us to the next star system.
Should have a mic to hear the caps go off and start the winding of motor until resistance is felt. Get it much quicker and smoother motion.
@JLaservideo, why don't you make a Spider-man Mask
The amount of efort in this is amazing
History n the making 👍👍👍👍👍
Yo that was epic !!!
I remember seeing a video about a police gps tracker that would shoot out from the front of a police car and puncture the vehicle it was chasing to track it, but it reportedly had issues sticking. That mechanism you made would be useful for that.
wow
Rasengan pls🎉🎉🎉
Every man's dream 😮
It's cool how you made both a web shooter and basically the hookshot from the Zelda games
this guy is literally going to become spiderman
I loved the video but while watching this I realised something:  I think if you redesigned this project into an odm gear from attack on titan then that way you can include a larger  cable and much more powerful launching mechanism as in odm gear the mechanism is in the waist so it won't be risky to increase the power of the shooter if it's on your waist as compared to your hand. also as odm gear is attached to your waist(closer to you centre of mass) it would be practically possible to swing form it without extreme arm strength.(for which you used harness, motor in your waist and your arm as launcher ).   It's just a cool thought so I thought might as well write it in case someone liked it and used this idea.    (It's my first time writing a comment so I'm sorry if the comment is boring )
Walk on the ceiling, that's all I'm saying.
2:25 NILERED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY JLASER VIDEO?
Holy
Here !!!! I’m freaking here!!! Ik he would do it !!!!!!!!!!🔥💯💯💯
Make the amaru gara hook from rainbow six siege
No.  Fuking.  Way....
You gotta include another webshooter in the other arm.
Aaaaaand I bought one
Make a bike you can ride then Pres a button and it will fit like a drone.
hi
He is beauty he is grace
Where in the spider verse where spider man is a youtuber and still testing
the nilered part caught me off guard
this man is turning into every super hero
Has DARPA contacted you yet?
the real world found its Peter Parker
that isn't spider-man that's grapple-guy
Guys am from the future, this channel in 5 years made a 4 by 3 inch version of this equipment... and it can hold up to 1000LB... oh and he made gloves and shoes thay stick to anything.🎉🎉🎉
IVE MISSED YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH I WISH YOU COULD MAKE MORE CONTENT
Bro woke up and said “I feel like being spider man today”
ITS SHOW TIMEEEEE!!!
Freaking AWESOME
Fantastic job on the whole video and inventions cheers!
Make a fight scene with avengers like with the hack Smith team in your team and friends with all the tech so like your store Iron Man Spider-Man Captain America make like a movie in an action scene
5:44 ad skip
You should try to climb a building using only webs!
2:21 real web fluid!
I would say this is more batman than spiderman
still waiting to see u make one that ur able to swing from one web to the next...maybe u already can with the ones youve made, but rule 32
Your poor neighbors
14:50 climactic testing (I think)
I feel like making attack on titan odm gear might be easier or way harder than this but you should try
if they sell out will you restock them later?
I’v been waiting for the spring ring ever since the vid came out
I've been following this forever and I've had the same thought for awhile. Gekos use very very small hairs on their feet to grip things and climb with them and (if possible) make it into a web shooter then you only need to find a way to peel it off after the swing then you could reuse it possibly. It's more then slightly difficult I'll admit just an idea.
def need too make another and try to swing from web to web
LOVE YOU VIDEO ❤
LOVE YOU VIDEO ❤
LOVE YOU VIDEO ❤
LOVE YOU VIDEO ❤
LOVE YOU VIDEO ❤
Everybody gangsta until he becomes a vigilante super hero fighting crime
I think you should tweak this design slightly to make it work like the new odm gear in AOT it’s pretty much the same thing you have, but u would just have it with the reel on ur back instead of ur tummy.  Also an idea of how to reload quicker would be to use bullet shells that are powered by blanks that can shoot the dart you made  while being attached to thin rope(will be way more compact especially if you use spectra line) and after you do a swing with it you then just detach it some how and load a new one really quick to shoot. Also too if u can throw together an exo-suit for ur arms it could maybe take the force of hanging and would look cooler then the rope being attached to ur belly. Please email me if u want me to throw some designs at you and chat more about this specific design. Any how that dart mechanism u made is dope af!
NICE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
please use this tech to make the ODM gear from attack on Titan. Please
Make they mini spider you find in Disney land that can 3d print more spiders
Become spider-man for a day
He's the reason we're gonna have super heroes in the future.
Absolutely awesome design keep it up. Also I'm curious about what u think of the wrist mounted grappling hook guns that Robert Pattinson's Batman uses in his movie.
2:20 hahaha funny nilered cameo
My favorite time was when he said it's spidermanning time.
Change the costume to BATMAN and you're gold. This contraption is more like a BAT contraption that Batman uses for scaling walls
Can you make a Red Hood helmet and suit that is bulletproof. That uses a bulletproof vast and metal.
kool
You should make a big hero six microbots video. It would be so coooooll
We need the bounce frisbee
If I get paid on time I'm wearing this everyday
Omg, this is it. Almost everything we all dreamed of. Jake you are a genius. Pretty obvious but Imma say it anyway. 🔥🔥
Gloves that help you do epic combos
Make spider sense using Ai
I remember seeing your videos about the lighter I knew I couldn't make anything like that but I loved just watching them they gave me inspiration to make other things So thanks and this new video is awesome seeing you swing around It's so cool and you can wall crawl that is awesome Great job man 😁👍
No thief is making it out of this dude’s house alive 💀
Great work you are amazing
THAT IS AWSOME
Finally, you made a video
You should make the hand cuffs from the avatar
will it stick to glass
Why don’t you just get bit by a radioactive spider? It’s what I did.
Yes!!!!
this is amazing man! the first web shooter I've seen that can stick into ceilings and hold like that! and you pulled a car! amazing work man like you said one step closer to becoming Spidey!😄
13:37 😳
I already have that web shooter i got it from amazon
Ayo dat a zip line gun
Next you should make Thor Hamer that comes back
cada día me sorprende mas este tipo
Hey man I'm waiting on my check to come please PLEASE HOLD AT LEAST FOR ME
i like that nigel red reference lmfao
bro you just need 1 more web shoder
all you need now is like a billion dollars and you're bruce wayne, and spiderman, and iron man
Nile red
This is actually really similar to the 3D Maneuvering gear in Attack on Titan… perhaps try replicating that next!
My inner Spider-Man, is saying I need this. Then I come back to reality, and realize this is one of a kind LoL
Now you need one for each arm so you can transition like spiderman
At the same spider man webshooters with a punch as a buthen it's easy
I have an idea for a reusable grappling hook wich can grab near anything. Materials Gecko tape that veritasium showed of Rope Launcher Some rat trap glue 4 weights for stability and range.  Make an X with some rope with each arm of the rope X thingy being around 0.5 meter in length and put one metal  piece on the end of each arm. attach some rope in the centre  to swing of. Then alternate between adding 8cm of gecho tape to the X thingy then adding 2cm of the rat glue.  If my hypothesis is correct it will launch out of the launcher and the metal pieces will keep the rope firing straight. When the X thing hits the target it will either wrap around it before the rat glue and gecko tape holds the grapple or it will stick flat and the rat glue holds to give the gecho tape better grip.  Thinking about it you could also probably put some motors And rope to contract the X thing so the gecho tape gets a proper grip and it might push the video over 10 min but I'm too lazy to edit this comment any further.
Finaly an uplode
Did anyone else notice the nilered reference?
i imagine if u get this 100% prefect i bet army or some would use it to help rescue people or scale enemy bases  if you could get it to be silent
Are we sure that Nigel is familiar with white goo?! 🤭
you should build another one for the other hand so you can swing more
Nile red over here
Could you make shoes that actually hover for a decent amount of time?
2:24 Jake became NileRed for a second there 🤣
I’ve been watching your channel for almost 5 years now and I love each video!!! You should try to make ghost riders flaming chain that would be soo sick
I didn't expect nilered to say "I got some white goo"
The NileRed gag killed me
This is the only invention I wanted in life ❤
Glass paired with a thermal radar to tell you where people are?
add a second one on the other arm, so you can swing once, and then shoot another while you're still in the air, and actually make some good ground!
Now we just need a exo-skeleton suit to buff up your strength
truly incredible
You should make a hulk suit
This is actually more like Jango Fett's harpoon than Spidy's web! It's cool nonetheless!
This makes me wish you had a cameo in one of the Spiderverse movies, or NWH. You are our universe's Spiderman, truly. I know there's a lot of reload that you cut out to make things look effortless, but I would say you're about 75% of the way to swinging through the cities.
Build a second one and use them together
Dudes main goal is to casually become Spider-Man and gets jacked in he process
I new that Nile red reference was coming
So it's a simple build then? 🙂
He's done it again , keep doing what your doing man , it's brilliant
Spider man has been really quiet since this dropped
Literally made web fluid
All we need is someone with the right attitude, and we would have the real Spiderman to this doc oc
freaking incredible!
You should make thors hammer that actually shoots lightning! But you should make it actually look like lightning, and not just a little line of sparks going from one place to another.
This is awesome! Would it be possible to use two of these at the same time, so you can chain multiple swings at a time?
Bet you can’t make it smaller and more efficient, on whatever god you believe in
Love the Nile red voice clip😂
Make real iron man repoulers
7:51 Dance monkey 💀💀💀
ayyy. it finaly happens
Wanna see him shoot it and stick to a wall with the wallclimbers
I would spend my life savings just to swing around like that
PLEASE Release the "Spring Ring" soon!!! I already have so many ideas!
You should make something from attack on titan like maybe the swords or try to make the grappler
nile red
2:16 bro think he nilered
anyone else hear NileRed at 2:21 ?
spiderman's powers are the future of private transport
Ideas: Daredevil's grappling baton/walking cane. Mr. Terrific's T-spheres! Dr. Strange's magic whips and shields. A pokemon ball that, when thrown, releases a full sized (sponge?) pokemon.
I’ve had this one idea that I w oh of love to see made. What if you made piston boots that you can control to make you jump extremely high.
where is the spring ring?
Incredible work as usual!
Nile red though
MACKE IRON MANS ROBOT
Omni gear from attack on titan
That NeilRed reference was awesome ! ❤
lmao loved the nile red addition
Bros secretly making new mountain climbing equipment 👀
Make a wheelchair that can go up stairs
one for each arm?
You’re better than Jack smith because you make the projects they cant
🐐
Is that nilered at 2:25 lmao
Incredible
So happy to see that you uploaded😀, keep up the amazing contact!!😁
Have you ever seen Thought Emporium? He created synthetic webs using spider genes and genetic engineering. Definitely  watch it for inspiration.
I have 2 of them
Someone already did it first
Him walking off with that spare tire cover reminds me of Spider-Man walking off with that lunch tray
I think you put a little bit too much emphasis on the shooter part of web shooters...
Great job bro
gotta double that up for both arms and do a double swing across the warehouse
Nileblue 😮 2:25
you should make a hovering skate board ( hover board) or make odm gear from attack on titan
Shang Chi rings that can be used just like movie (throw the rings & have them seemlessly fly back onto your wrist).  Edit: Pretty plz?
This is insane
Bro turned into Nile red
Went to buy 4 for xmas presents, no UK shipping available... yay
real webshooter is probably a little bit of lie wouldnt you say? more like grappling gun which is great too
hacksmith = ironman : Jlaser = spiderman
Can you test it rock climbing?  This (with some product development) could save lives by deploying if a climber happened to fall.
When he tries to grab Mary Jane to stop her from falling 💀
Can you make a freeze gun that Mr freeze uses
I have been following several engineering youtubers for years now hoping to find a spiderman webshooter that sticks and actually swings, thank you for making this video.
you should make a self aiming bow
Batman armor or gadgets
Zak catchinator
will u ship to canada soon?
Maybe try to maximise the range/power/effectivenes you can give it by switching of of the "webshooter" concept and just maka a real grapling gun. Im thinking something like John Cena (forgot the charakters name) did it in "Fast and Furious 9" (F9), or like Batman too I guess. Would love to see something like that!
Do you ship to uk?
Now all we need is a criminal to kill his uncle
how much would you sell this for
PLEASE JAKE RELEASE THE SPRING RING ITS BEEN FOREVER
Awesome job bro
If you could successfully swing twice in one go that would be so cool but I get it started off small
Great, seems to be lighter on the engineering and design parts  Would love to see more of those, we need more people like you promoting STEM
I wanted to order one but its sadly only in the US.... :(
40 bucks is valid honestly consider some creators chard 60 for a screen print t shirt
Still waiting for more speed with those shoes 😭
Honey wake up JLaservideo uploaded
Did i hear nile red / blue
spooderman
No way uh uh HOW DO YU DO DISSSS!!!!!now the working iron man suit is on its wa-- oh wait you've done that all I have to say is everyone who is Acociated with you  is super proud
That was the fastest shut up and take my money I've ever personally experianced. 5 in the cart. 1 for the one I'll end up breaking, and a full set with replacements. Also I lost a ranked match.
OMG UR BAAAAACK LETS GO!!! IM SOOOO HAPPY AND EXCITEEEEEEEEEEEED
Good thing spider-man doesn’t live around a lot of glass lol, great video dude keep it up
so quick question if i where to theoretically try to like build the same thing how do i get my hands on one of the   power actuated hammers to run some tests not sure how legal they are here
I want one but im from germany
let's just hope nobody makes a company and names it oscorp
pretty sure there's a scene where spidey is shritless
I feel like I'm watching iron man when he's in the cave making his suit
Hey Jay, I searched up yet bounce back captain America’s shield, and are you selling that?
UPLOAD!!!
i subscrubed
This mf is gonna just become spiderman at some point and we're all doomed
Are you Airracks brother? 😂
bro hes never getting that piece of wood back..
This guy is unreal❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just bought two. You’ll see me swinging around the city later. -Wally
You should do a spider man completion video
Make a viper molly launcher from Valorant
You should make a Minecraft fishing rod that you can shoot
Idea: Make a flying bowler hat like meet the Robinsons. Also make it have a video recorder.
you should make deez nutz or spider man miles morales venom electricity or his invisiblity i think that would be a good idea. everyone lets get him to make this
I'm convinced he is going to become Spiderman
like previously said, your videos keep getting better never slacking
Please do the spring ring I have been looking so forward to having one!
What if the magnets rapped around stuff and attached to each other I would maybe make it be Abalr to grab on to more stuff
POV Jlaser in 20 years: I’m going to build the infinity gauntlet
What type of glue would you recommend we buy with the web shooter?
i would say this is more of a batman gadget
You should make a black panther suit
nice
We are watching a batman/tony stark esc superhero origin story unfold before us
Cool
Man I can wait until the NASA shows up at your house
you should definitely sell your bouncing frizbee
now do hulk
Can you PLEASE do the Psychic Paper from Doctor Who?????
I emailed you but did not recieve a response was looking for help choosing electronic for a iron man drone....
you are now too powerfull
I got one in my pants
it's crazy how someone could have made something as cool as this, but we would never know because they haven't put it out there, so it's great you have this platform to show your work
Make an Iron Man like HUD that gives you spider sense- lets you know when something is coming from certain directions
That NileRed impression was fire 😂
dude that web shooter is an instant buy that looks sick
bro that is the coolest fucking thing I have ever saw. Keep up the good work with projects and other stuff. You have some serious talent in engineering and you are truly amazing. Looking forward for the next video!!!
3:21 I thought that was markiplier punching me
ODM from Attack on Titan next??
OMG that looks fun 😮
In an multiverse made of wood a spider man makes his webshooters while documenting it to YouTube.
Can't wait till you end up making it 100% perfect to were your like spiderman from the movie able to keep swinging and keep going until you wanna stop
COLLAB WITH HACKSMITH PLEASSSSEEEEEEE!!
Spider-Man meets Batman Year Zero.  Just gadgets on gadgets.
Lo mejor del mundo T.T por el lowcode me deja sin Trabajo XD
imagine if you had another one on the other arm, so you could swing twice
So cool
pls gimmie milk
Today was a day I thought I want to watch J laser
Also look into Gecko adhesive materials, they are designed to stick to surfaces without adhesives. If you made a suit out of it, I'm pretty sure you could crawl up any surface without magnets or suction.
Can you make something from Black Panther Wakanda Forever
I just think it's crazy you build this stuff but you haven't tried going out there fighting crime yet lol
You put both web shoots on your hand so it works on release with it
2:26 Did you just become NileRed 😨
bro this crazy a working iron man suit then this!?!?!
I want a web shooter so bad. By the time I get the money it’ll probably be sold out😢. Can you please make more jlaser😊
As soon as I heard Nilered’s voice, I went strait to the comments 😂
Yes, release the spring ring
Awesome work! Can you make a second one and do a video of you using both?
This seems a lot closer to the Titanfall 2 grappling hook, especially with the 2 charge limit. Maybe next, a jump kit from titanfall? Basically jet thrusters that attach to your hip and amplify your parkour abilities by pressing you into a vertical wall and letting you wall run.
Awesome!!! Hey could you maybe make one of moon girls gadgets from the marvel tv show/comics?
If you could reload this maybe through some sort of rotating cartidge system you'd be unstoppable 🤣
5:49 on his journey to become spiderman he became cyrax for a short moment
I got the retractable web shooter for $20
Can you make a doctor  Swain's  Orange  hand and make a cape by
The spiderman fan inside me is screaming right now, I can't wait to watch this one!
I have an idea for you JLaser. I want you to make a boomerang just like that of Captain boomerang. You can search up "Ravissa Spinner" on YouTube, he sells a spinner that when thrown comes back no matter the distance, so just apply it to a boomerang and add some bombs or smoke grenades and you've made Captain boomerang's boomerang.
Mãe the climber and the web
The hook shot from the legend of zelda
now use spider silk
This tech looks a lot like ODM gear from Attack on Titan! Would be so cool to see that happen!
If you want marvel to see this video like this comment
Bro when he first showed the chemicals I knew what he was doing
i love this so much!
Did I just spend money on a webshooter for myself...... yes I did and I don't regret it. Thank you😂
Hahaha 😂😂😂 the neil red voice at 2:26
Who else saw the Nile Red reference
… … the Ramset nail things look like pipe bombs.
Darn the webshooters dont ship to the UK 😢
Yooo
Stanley would be proud.
amazon seller copied your product on shopify
The final web shooter prototype is probably one of the most dangerous things you have built on this channel and I love it
Yo u the new spidermN😂😂😂😂
This is awesome, what if you tried with 2 of them? Would be able to keep swinging?
plz make the 3d maneuvre gear fron attack on titan
I was expecting him to use drones somehow…
Man turned into Nilered 2:17
no way!!!!!!!!!!! this is dope! you are peter parker in this universe lol
absolutely wild
I think you can do the 3D Manuever Gear from AOT
HOLLLYYYY 🗿
Please sell a homemade flash suit
Make the nail barbed like a fish hook!
You should make a goblin glider
This man checks almost EVERY BIX for being spider man Sticks to walls (check) Shoots webs that he can swing from (check) Hottest dude in town (check) The only thing he is missing would be a camera system to tell him where everything is. That would be amazing
I kinda hope he gets a cameo or reference in the next Spiderverse movie. That would be cracked
Next video. I jumped off a 400 foot building then webed over and climbed a the empire state building😂
Hey! do you think you can built cisco Ramon/vibe (from the flash) gauntlets?
Hey Jay how are you doing?
GREAT! now do attack on titan thing >:D
How do you convince people to let you shoot holes in there things?
I love that NileRed reference in there. beautiful!
Deli full cowling lightning
make a black panther mask that expands over your head, or make an infinity gauntlet that shoots a power beam (like in infinity war where thor throws stormbreaker at thanos) or mjolnir  (you already made thors hammer that shoots lightning, but you should make one you can summon)
16:09 idea: you can have the swinger on one hand, the shooter on the other, and the climbers on both your arms and legs, its will be not flexible but hey its close, ik its heavy but you’re a big boy
heads up the web shooter only delivers to america
This is actually Batman's grapple gun, right down to attaching the anchor to your belt. lol
Always love your posts! Keep up the good work!
2:20 that reference was golden and I got it instantly.
Two so you can swing around because if you have one you can let go in the other one you can you can swing on the other one and you like Spider-Man yeah in and you need to get your Web back somehow
Can it be possible to ship the Web shooters to Europe?
You should make your own iron man suit. With your own design with the Jlaser logo and everything If it could fly that would be cool
i bought your web shooter
One day JLaserVideo will be the "Spiderman we have at home"
I too would like to catch a zak
another epic video
😂😂😂 Nile
YESS
You should make that gun blade thing from scissor seven
Everything?  don't seem to stick to the air very well...  Test it on liquids and gases!  Just being a smart, and half kidding...  Another great vid man!
Could you make it work for self defense ? It'd be groovy.
hello
An industrial looking spider-man... honestly if a suit is designed for use with your creations, it could look really fucking sick
This was amazing! Really well thought and put together, quite the feat for sure! How about trying to use the quiver you made for the Hawkeye bow, and transform it into a unit to recharge your "web cartridges" from your right leg? That way you'd be able to swing, reload, and repeat. It'd be interesting to see if you're able to do that to make it even more complete!
Congratulations, you have made the coolest thing ever
Wow
Can’t believe it’s finally happened someone finally made real life webshooters and I’m glad it was you mate.
Make it stick not trying to be demanding but you have to make it stick
Can you make HHO mashine please
or rifle
nice NileRed reference
The Mandalorian blaster
The main problem is that you can only swing once but other then that its awesome!
With this 22lr nail gun can you try to make a muramasa blade
Really good job, I've been watching your content for a long time, and honestly it's really cool watching how much your designing has improved, and how much crazier your stuff keeps getting. There's a lot of old projects I'd love to see you revisit and see if you could update and improve on!
make batman wings
This is so cool, gonna go further and have another on your other wrist so you can swing twice? That be cool
Your videos are really good. Btw, you realize how cool all those things you created are?
maaaaaan yuouuuu AREEE A FUCKINGG GENIUSSSS evry time you make avideo you suprise me,  think you could try making a full body harness to help balance. with a pulley system on the arms to move the rope more precisely from the rope rewinding system placed on the back (together with the motors and also the co2) up to the wrists and make the system rewind a little faster if you wacth attck on titan season 3 the  new 3d manouver gear ,  its  kind of like that
I bet the net could be used by police
Does the DOD ever approach you about some of your interesting projects? I feel like a set up that lets you scale any flat surface without ropes might pique their interest.
This was amazing (pun intended)!! The amount that your projects have grown since the early days is amazing. I have a build suggestion: Mask machine from Mission: Impossible. This video was great, thanks for the awesome entertainment (and education).
You should try using a shooter on both hands. After releasing with one hand, shoot and swing with the other in mid air?
Have you considered gecko tape? Could make some substantial upgrades to your full spiderman system
I loved when you imitated nilered lol
LET'S GO, SPOODERMAN!
by god hes done it.
That’s awesome
647th comment, what a magnivelous achievement that i have achievemented.
Now create one for the other hand and see if you can swing twice in a row
Def want to see the spring Frisby for sail
Me: 2:18 oddly looks like a NileRed video Me 9 seconds later :)
This is f*cking asome
Wouldn't it be safer to show how you "safely" did it rather than people guessing based on video cuts?
Dammit if I wasnt broke Id but teo of those webshooters right now
Amazing project you’ve come so far from the old web shooters
You need to find a way to shoot multiple of them in a row
Marvel hire this man right now
make a lazer
Y'all should try to make a second one so you could do like a second swing
if there was a way of putting a sort of 'unstick' mechanismn that releases the 'webs' then that would mean they could be reused quickly would would make it even more spiderman like
This guy is actually a genius
How long would delivery take from you to Chicago please check email for more details wanting to know for birthday
YO! Idea, could you use bungee chord type things with a really high modulus of elasticity  to make it kinda always slack
Please make a
Incredibleeeeee
nice if only there was a way to make the is swing and reload automatically if you got another one in between swings it would be a shoot swing reload (in between swings) loop
With this build you would have to be careful with suspension trauma if you were to hang for a long period of time
Should market that net shooter to law enforcement :P
Spring ring !!!
Make something harry potter if u havnt already
Ordered it immedietely
man becomes more like spiderman everyday
my childhood dream
I was confused why at 2:18, Jlaser's talking reminded me so much of Nile red. Than Nile red started talking lol.
0:15 ah the nostalgia😎  Went from simple projects from cheap materials , to hardcore more expensive projects👍
Bro your super hero stuff lol
YOOOOO
Soo... I might have bought the webshooter faster than you finised the sponsor segment.
You made Scorpion's rope dart :D
This man is doing God’s work
so when you finna become spiderman
You don't have one for each arm?
It really speaks to my nature as a lazy cat person that when you said they were available to buy, I thought they'd make for a great cat toy that I didn't have to move to use
Next thing you need is a protective helmet that looks like a spider man mask so you can wear it when swinging
Hey there peter parker.
Make a retractable ant man helmet from antman and the wasp  qountaMania
The real challenge is getting all those nails out of the roof
Can you make a Retractable star lord helmet that also expands over your head?
dude really just made a grappling hook that pulls you up, webs you say
i cant turn on your notifications
No way 👏👏
damn bruh you make me more excited for engineering college everytime you upload
Also make them repeat over and over again
Awesome
make a net gun for police to use thats a better non lethal measure
If this is what he can achieve in 2023, wonder what'll do in 2025
If I were to purchase a web shooter from your store, if there is a problem with it (such as a crack or something) out of the box, do you supply a replacement or fix for whatever problem there may be?
This is basically a gun that holds you up, so Spider-Man’s webs but they murder people
This is amazing keep up the good work can't wait to see the next video
You’re truly an inspiration, dude!
Now dual wield
Amazing video, bro. Once you’ve figured out the science to make the web shooters more smaller and compact, and making them faster to repel, you’ll be the one and only real life Spider-Man
Make a man balls cry 😭
So good, I've loved your vids for years, and I love your dedication!
I know it’s not really your thing, but maybe a little Spider-Man robot that can use spider senses so if your about to hit it it moves out the way
There is no shipment option to Germany. 😭
I have three questions do I beg for you to answer.   1: will it be possible that you upgrade the hover board and do an actual glider of the green goblin? Even if not, do you think you can build all the gadgets of the green goblin like Spidey and amazing friends. The giggle gas or pumpkin prank goo/slime? Cuz either way the green goblin gadgets you make are awesome not better than Spider-Man but awesome.  2: can you upgrade your own vehicle super Duper gadgets or weapons, exactly like PS5 fast and furious crossroad?  3: “The big question of all”  With all the gadgets and inventions you ever made at the same time inventions you were about to make. do you ever think about building yourself a homemade security system? Like the hackSmith industries did theirs with a security defense protocols in someway? 🫱🫳🫱  PS some of your technologies could/would be good for security tech if you know I’m saying? 😉👍
the amount of joy I get from just even seeing this just puts a smile on my face this is beautiful
your one that your selling is the cheapest I've seen of that style of web shooter most are 90+
Imagine if you had two! I could easily see you chaining these web shooters together and actually swing for long durations, couple that with improved climbers that have the suctions on the palm of your hand, and you could literally be spiderman.
Freakin Sweet!
Make another one. Attach to your other hand. Swing off the first, fire the second, release the first. Badass.
There is something so final fantasy about watching dude cock that hammer   #pause
I would love to see you make a 3D ODM gear from AOT that will be so Awesome!!!
What if you take a tape measure and turn it into a weapon but this is just a idea
Now you have now be cam spiderman
I think you should make different types of webs spider man has like taser webs or web grenade etc
I'd really like to see a market version of the actual flying iron man suit
muscle activated/ brain activated wolverine claws
Gonna have to re-roof that barn.  dig the concept. I think the release is the weakest part though. Cant believe it has as much hold power as you got out of it.
HE LIVES! And is back with another mind blowing project!
im glad i grew up before the internet ran our lives but i wish we had stuff like this when i was a kid
(Warehouse owner) "Why is my roof leaking?"
Eventually this is going to turn into the things from attack on titan
2:16 Nile red moment 😂  Edit, Ok so this is my first time watching and i did dent know that Nile red would actually do a voice over in this
Spider-Man in real life   I thought I never see the day 😢
Imagine one of these on both hands, so potential for 4 shots combined with the wall climbing.
Bruh, I actually really wanted that web shooter but I'm in canada so I can't get it. Oh well, always cool to see some nice spider man content like this, especially with all the different methods.
Oh no, it’s only available in the US😓. I was so ready to buy it
Awesome stuff, as always.
This is truly amazing the best vid I've seen all year
Stan and Steve would be proud. I have nothing to say to you except “Excelsior!”
The videos keep getting better and better omg this is so cool!!!!
Amazing. You gonna do one for each arm and swing from a swing?
The goooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great work
Amazing 👍🏻👍🏽👍
While watching this video I had the idea of using a explosive to insert nails into things to swing from then 5 minutes later this guy does it. I'm just left in aw from this whole video. I did get another idea though what if you used super glue again but with the mouse trap goo surrounding it then inject reactent to harden it. So you throw a glob of mouse trap goo with super glue in it make sure the glue contacts the surface of the object and have a small pipe deliver the reactant. And put a wood block in it so the rope can attach to something. Point is keep the goos separate the mouse trap goo keeps it in place so the super glue can harden with the reactant and the wood block is what's covered in glue on one side and is what you attach the rope to.
Lmaooo using Nile Reds audio clip “I was able to pull out some white goo”😂😂😂😂😂
Can you make Batman's grappling hook please
he is Back  nice
love the project but it feels like this would've fit better as scorpions kunai launcher
You should make a bacta tank from Star Wars
It would be do cool if you could have another shooter shoot and have a double swing after you release the previous rope
Man i really wanted to order the web shooter, but its only for people from USA😢
Amazing bro keep up the good work, you got my support
simple: spidermen
you should make the microbots from big hero 6
Spring ring please!!
you really inspire me JLaser.
2:24 i think you hade some nile red stuck in your voice
Honnetly, you are the best genious of this earth. I like your vidéo
You literally missed the PERFECT opportunity to edit in the Spider-Man lunch tray scene at 13:20
2:25 inserting Nigel's voice here absolutely killed me. xD
spring ring pls
Bro if been waiting ages for this banger of a video but glad I waited
Love your videos been watching for 3 years now ❤❤❤   But can you please build naruto's rasengan plz❤
POV: You live in the UK so can't get the web shooters 😢
Great video as always! I would love to see a collaboration between you and the Hacksmith!
I love the shooter
Plz make a working Harry Potter golden snitch
So it's basically Batman's grappling hook...
But you still need two of them😂
I've been waiting
Maybe make batman utility belt with variety of gadgets inside the belt
FUCKINGGGG AMAZINGGG!!!!!!!!!💙
That was sick bro!!! That’s literally the closest we’ve got to real life Spider-Man that I’ve seen, Climb, shoot stuck swing release
The glue looks kinda sus
I hope we’re going to see it swing from building to another(like Tobey Maguire) in real life soon?
Amazing video absolutely owe inspiring
I ordered the thing
Can you make falcon wings that you can glide with
I went to go flag this video down for cringe but that wasnt an option so i just picked terrorism
is that nile red at 2:28?
Dammit I wished I lived in the US so I could buy those web shooter’s on shopify but no I live in the UK😢
The web shooters even sound like spider-man's.
Weird request:build the batman utility belt with everything you would think the master detective would have, including bat-a-rangs.
So cool but was about to buy web shooter but not available on the UK heard there’s another one tho 😅
Dude, at this point, you could literally just be a super hero!
Had to pause and buy that web shooter, thank you🙏🙏
I love the (possibly?) NileRed reference in his tone of voice at 2:18
I love spider man so I love this vid god job ps this is Joel not Sarah
i want to spiderman become
I wish I wasnt consipated
I feel like nilered could possibly make the nylon 6 or the rat trap method work better.
He’s legitimately getting close. People like this are pioneers. Who knows where this could lead.
Antman controllable ants?
Yes finally another video
finally a new vid
that's sick
PLEASE LET US BUY THE SPRING RING!
I think the next shooter should be just like this but maybe with more rope stored somewhere for easy reload so you can do multiple swings in the air
now all we need is one on each arm.
YOOOOOO First Upload in Awhile
am i the only one confused on how he pulled a whole car
Hi Jake, love❤️ from Nigeria 🇳🇬.
That nail one was pretty much a Grappling gun even with the pull function, could easily be batman too
Batmans cape glider would be cool
hay i work security in hawaii over her im not allowed to carry a tazer or pepper spray and only on rare occasions im i allowed to fight but i am allowed to make an arrest a web shooter that can launch a net would actually be something im allowed to used if im in danger can the one on sale be modified to shoot a net
16:15 you already are the closest thing to spiderman❤️
Insane!!!
This project would be better if you use this to make batman grapling gun
Bro one of the best videos you have made that shot crazy
now when he needs that spare tire, he'll find a hole or two in it from the web launcher
Now all you need to do is find a way to make to stick to something else other than wood and it coming off the structure of it went in easily and you have something else entirely
you could add white marker lines on the mask for a more spiderman esk effect
DUDE I LOVE THIS GUY
Nabbed a web shooter..sick!!
I honestly think with the webshooter mechanics you could make odm gear using the same stuff!!
bro really is= gonna create spiderman's whole kit
I mean, CRAZY video dude and great work! I'm personally working on my own webshooters inspired by your design that you're selling, I can't buy them because I have no money but I can make them, hopefully I keep this plan up and give an update soon enough Thank you JL, the work you put in to make this dream true is CRAZY, wish the most luck in your trials and man, keep us updated
This is incredible
Omg the legend isn't dead
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Another name for this video: We made a a gun that has a retractable bullet.
To how make iron spider con gadget
Not to be whatever but Colin furze made a grapling hook that does the same thing from assassin's creed
Now build a second one for your other arm and try to change the arm on which you are swinging
Now you need both arms to have one
Now just put a second glove on your second hand and add a  separate release mechanism for it and swing in succession.  That would be so cool. Maybe one day haha. great video, love your content
Make 2 and them put multiple of shot in each on and get to swinging
Have you seen the spider sense gear that hacksmith made? Combine that with the cilmbers and web shooters then you will be a artificial Spider-Man
So glad I found this video.
IV LOVED THIS CHANNLE SINCE I WAS 5 AND IM NINE\
This is absolutely amazing You should pair this with the spider wall climbers and other spider man stuff you made like Tue iron man armor
Adults: what do you want to be when you grow up Kid 1: A doctor Kid 2: A streamer Me: JLazerVideo
there is this geko foil that can stick on everything without actually sticking you should try this out as a web "hook" instead of raming nails into the walls  check this vid out: https://youtu.be/vS0TuIPoeBs
Since you are doing spider man content, it would  realy be cool if you can make the stealth suit
THE ONLY THING I GOT TO SAY IS, YOU'RE THE SMARTEST GUY ON EARTH I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
this is literally every kids dream
Was about to buy the webshooter but can't ship to Finland, maybe one day, hopefully. I'll be there.
its insane close you are to actually being spiderman
if you can remake it to the other arm you can shoot stick swing release shoot stick swing release land
Holy moly
You are now the envy of every superhero fan ever
nile red joke was hilarious
you need one on each arm so you can swing twice not only once
Great!  Now do the Gwen Stacy scene
Add a custom miniature peltier cooler and ultrasonic transducer to the nail assembly to detach the nail from the ceiling. (just the transducer might work). and give the nail and launcher multiple charges so you can reel it back in and go again. with the transducer active at the right frequency the nail should just slide out when the motors pull, can also change the nail material, not sure how you could reset the nail charge. maybe pull it back into the hand assembly and have a mechanism reset the nail and charge there to save on launch weight.
You should make the arrangements on titan ODM gear with the rope
You’re the best YouTube project creator on the platform in my opinion. The work you put in and the fact you can actually make these insane project is incredible. It just keeps getting better and better and more and more ambitious. Insane stuff. You deserve all the recognition and in fact need more.
You need two so you can swing more than once
This is amazing and look so fun and dangerous in perfect balance
Combine all the spider man gadgets you have to become the ultimate irl spiderman
Now you just gotta figure out how to make them reusable. Cause Spidey doesn't swing and then stop to reload and do it again. Still fucking sick though. This is so awesome.
If u make another one for the other are u can get two swings in I feel like that will be a step and further the only thing is going past two swings
God mechanist
Real life mad scientist
Bro just glued a 2x4 to his porch how he gonna get it down 💀
Very cool but remember to be careful marketing it using the word toy! Don't forget about the Magnetix lawsuit!!
Feels like I am watching a spider man movie!
If you make a spinneret…where the webs would shoot out and twist together it would make it stronger. Just like a rope. Or any string or anything twist together adds strength instead of just having a straight rope or string
where did you get the co2 to solenoid? I'm looking for that exact system.
Plot Twist: What if he is the Spiderman? But From This Earth. But what universe? Now that is too much for the Marvel universe can handle to Explain.
The Nile red reference
Keep it up i loved this one and have been watching for a while  Ps How abaout a supper curve/spin dodgeball or baseball
You never fail to impress
Make a real life transformer!!!
I haven't followed many YouTubers as long as I have you and wow have you come a long way. Amazing video and great work.
Great, now if spiderman needs to swing over 1 gym equipment he'll do just fine
How????????????        This is Unreal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is incredible glad U finally have a spider man web shooter Jake!
Yo this is so cool he just keeps getting better
If he miss he can kill somone but is faking cool xD
Turned into nile red at 2:15 lol
Bro no shipping to U.K? ill pay double get one to me my guy please!
Would be Really cool if you make it to: 1. Climb a wall 2. Swing with one shooter to the ceiling 3. Swing from the other arm with a second shooter drone the ceiling. 4. Land on a Wall again (I think this might me the hardest step) ^^
Can there be some sort of safety that prevents force from the acceleration of the nail and blank from imparting force on the primer of the blank? Similar to an out of battery safety
Awesome work dude! Knew you’d find a way when I saw your walk crawlers! Keep it up man!
This is awesome man i think your the first person to ever get this close to making a web swinger🎉
Was so excited after 10mins then it just turned into rope swinging with metal and rope... kinda disappointed
Could you build a Bat man glider cape
I’m actually watching Spider-Man rn
Been waiting for a new upload- binge watched my favorite vids yesterday and Jake uploads a new one the next morning!
can you try to make a squirrel suit that is hidden in a suit like some John Wick or James Bond thing
No way
Woah, this is insane. Very awesome project, but then again i've never seen a bad project from you
Been waiting for this since u posted on insta
Finally bro , u uploaded
The KING 🤴 is back!
JLaser has got the spidey swing posing down
bro, this man should just become the new Spider-man irl
Nope, that’s not a “WEB SHOOTER” that’s a “ROPED BOLA GRAPPLE SHOOTER” 😂😂😂😂😂 but everything starts off as prototypes. Good job but I still want to see “WEB SHOOTERS” not roped versions….. it’s very simple people…. Or maybe not for you but for me it is. Making web fluid is easy for me, the web shooter not so much….. 😂😂😂😂
I almost forgot how much crazy things this guy can make . Wow this one look so cool
I always thought this wouldn't be possible but here you are that just done it, you are literally the most talented creator on YouTube. Never give up
This is awesome! I can't believe how close you are. Next thing I'd probably say you should give it multiple charges so that you can swing for longer before respooling everything
Still over on Forbes?
That’s so awesome 🥹
What great research and experimentation!  It would have been interesting to see its use on both arms like spiderman does when he runs through buildings.  A warm greeting
Now make another one for your other hand and actually swing like Spider-Man
So cool
Insane!
Objective: Spiderman web End result: Batman grapple gun
You need to make shock absorbing shoes next to go with this build!
Bruh, this is turning into a "how i became spiderman" documentary
You should make a gyro-sphere from Jurassic would!!! P.s great vid!
8:14 can we just embrace for a moment that it kinda looks like a pipe bomb 😂
Please try making another one for your second hand, that would be so cool
Can you put the cap shield on there
it's the gadgets of James West .
It makes a really cool grappling hook, forget Spider-Man it’s almost Batman’s grapplehook
If he decided to be a villain we’d be doomed
That's pretty much all he needed to be Spider-Man
this is amazing your so good at making gadgets for heavens sake you made a real iron man arm thrusters you even made edith glasses i love your inventions and i hope you get better along the way😁
I have one of your web shooter taus, and after about a week or two of use it would get stuck about halfway. Is this just a fluke, or has it happened to you too?
brO says goo like 500 times
Spideys packin 😏
Its awesome that he went for like every passing idea of how they could work and tried them all despite how impractical for science and fun. Like making all the elements a web-shooter should have but cant have (yet) together, an ultimate guide for early 2023 web-shooter tech
wait what????????????????????????????????, you finally uploaded a video.I love your videos.I already know it will be so good.Keep on with your amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! work!!!!!!!!!!!......
Need to change the channel name to Jaservideo, cause bro takes no L’s
Years in the making, totally worth it!
I HEARD NILE RED! 2:25
Have you ever seen that competition that Red Bull does where they make gliders and see how far they can fly? I think that would be really fun if you could make a glider... But make it flap like real wings. Lol it's probably way too hard, but it would be fun to try!
Wanted to buy one, but no shipping to germany T_T and you are getting to becomming the real life spidermann, need to add the spidersense and super strength,
This has some potential for SWAT or military application, even firefighting.
If this dude does not get superpowers in some way i will be badly disappointed
Theres another way, some sort of spring loaded camming device built into the nail, so when the nail is forced into the wall, all the force from the nail being pulled would be forced to the side of the hole the nail made
Bros gotta be from a different planet! Good job 👍
THATS WHY HES THE goat the goat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
every video is a step closer to the dream
Thank you for finally making a video again jake, lol, jk   keep it up
Now make an all in one suit. Web shooter, climbing, self tightening, maybe put the knife shoes on to climb trees
You should make a doom slayer wrist blade
I just saw the vid on TikTok and the actual vid was just posted on youtube
podrias aser el GRABPACK DE Poppy pleyime porfavor 🙏

Finally another post, always looking forward for this guy’s videos,keep up the good work
I have loved Spider-Man ever since I was little and seeing you make this makes me believe that we are closer to web slinging the ever
JLaser saw marvel and said JLaser:yess Bu- JLaser:yes i will
Best YouTuber
Bro o this is insanely cool, well done!
Spring ring
8:33 Bro those arms
You should sell Percy Jackson swords
NASA spends billions on rocket ships when this guy decided to just fly
Bro to be honest I would pay thousands for the Hawkeye bow and arrow with the quiver
You are the best youtuber, and you are my inspiration.
Amazing as always! It’s also cool to see you’re selling some of your stuff!

I remember when that hacksmith intern did this, so seeing you make it even better is highly impressive, although I know you are capable of some really sick stuff!!! Keep up the good work.

2:26 Like if u follow Nile red shorts
It's been almost 5 years since I saw those old web shooter videos with the colorful cartridges! I remember buying a whole bunch of lighters to try and make them! ...and then I forgot about it lol. It's genuinely been such a treat to see you grow over the years, dude! Keep killing it :)
The best is back
Bro I instantly caught that Nile red reference XD
No way! That is so amazing
Hello can u make aot swords??
Jesus you truly are inspiring, I’m glad YouTube community have someone like you “sticking around” plus talking in a cool way about science stuff, love it!!! Let’s go!!

At this point he's just going to become the next spider-man
U should make a black Panther suit
Yessssss
He Jlaser you really inspire me to build things and one day I hope to be as good at it as you. Thanks for great video yet again! One of the only ways it could get better is if it could release a bit quicker. Other than that it is incredible!
