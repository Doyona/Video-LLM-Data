Out of topic but 5:14 - 5:21  i love that shot, makes the tension of the discussion a little higher
you cant fault any of the three for winning it........
StephAaintbeenintheleagueso Idontbuyhiscrap 4:23
I would think Rondo of all people would have Jokic as MVP. Everything Denver does goes through his facilitation and court awareness. Something I’d think Rondo would prioritize
Rondo should be part of this show.
15 votes for Jokic???? Voting was legit??? But we are used to legit voting!
Another great performance by fake MVP!They just lost again vs Boston! And he made every player on his team better! Just compare game 1 stats when he wasn’t playing ant 76 won!
To me it was Giannis easily. Out of the three he’s easily the best, most consistent, and versatile defender and that’s not even debatable. Yet some how his teammate was in the running for DPOTY and he wasn’t. Yet every game Giannis missed, especially in the playoffs, the struggled mightily on defense. Sorry but MVP isn’t solely offense, it’s basketball in it’s entirety
Embid is a shitty teammate
I’ll say what everybody is afraid to say:   Embiid winning wasn’t about a war against analytics, that’s an excuse to distract people from the truth.   Jokic was the overwhelming favorite before Kendric Perkins basically accused MVP voters of racism. Jokic is  the better player who led his team to the number one seed in the west. Embiid didn’t do that. It’s obvious that Perk made it about race.   There are 100 MVP voters, and Jokic only got like 15 votes all of a sudden? That’s because they didn’t want to be labeled as racist by Perk, but ended up being racist against Jokic for being white. 🤦🏻   Jokic should have won it. The NBA has been plagued by woke ideas for years now, and it’s a disgrace that they have robbed Jokic so bad.
Sixers are nothing without Embiid hey... won game 1 on the celtics' floor without him.. the disrespect to James Harden is absurd.
Bro joker is mvp all day.. he has the worst supporting cast out of each player and he makes everyone around him better to me it’s no question
Rondo would be a great coach tho. Analysts.......mmmmmehhhhhhhh, nah. He's too critical and serious thinking for this.... Go for a coaching gig Rondo!!
More Rondo
Kepp rondo around to keep jj in check
All 3 candidates  not American the NBA has gone global
Giannis antetakumpo
6:40 molly w the background open sums her role in the show up well
Now even a blind man can see who the NBA favors and the media, when Embiid was not kicked out after that kick in the crotch!
Bring back Pat Bev he’s so much more entertaining than Rondo
Rondo be a great analyst!
The Jokic slander is outta pocket
Embiid was the best Player in the NBA this year.  When you average in scoring, defense and free throw shooting.  Embiid is the guy.  The race between Embiid, Jokic and Giannis is so close that I had to go with who's more clutch.  It's Embiid.
As someone from london i dont understand how if a team finishes top of the league/conference they win nothing but home court advantage in the playoffs with nothing to show for their long difficult season if the were to lose to a team in the playoffs( like nothing). But a team with a less impressive record can win the conference and the title if luck and determination play a part
All 3 should get the MVP this year.
Giannis is the M. V. P
It’s good to see Rondo. He’s most definitely an Hall Of Famer
Everything the said about embiid having more help than giannis also makes a case for jokic AND embiid has the best 'robin' on james harden, comparing with jokic (and giannis too).
JJ still upset Philly didn't bring him back.
🤔how he gets a vote 🤷🏿‍♂️
It looks like a pity vote for Joel he tried he not better than the other two but he tried so we gonna give him smh
Boston does have the Sixers number...that being said if Philly beats Boston they win the title.
Milwaukee is solid without Giannis. They would be a 4 or 5 seed. But they’re are not the best record in the league without Giannis.
Jj Reddick has a vote??
Crazy how mvps are overseas players now
Kendrick ruined the MVP race, with his stupid argument..
we need cp3, rondo and beverly in studio in SAME time
as a value I mean really value for team is Joker.
Embiid is going to get double and triple team James will have to step up and push maxey & harris (overpaid fraud)
Giannis and Embiid play with all stars, Jokic doesn't. Jokic is the most valuble to player in the league.
Joel was hurt last year, J J! How did you leave that out? James was hurt also.
It's 2023 an actual teamsports still giving out individual awards,, smh
We found a replacement for the useless Perk! Make Rondo permanent!
These arguments from context favour Jokic, whose team did the worst without him, and who does not have an all-star teammate. But bias is unavoidable, and I'd have to flip a coin between Jokic and Giannis myself.
How you hate on yo former teammate jj straight pu**y embid mvp….. dont come to philly
This is the first time JJ let me down
Wow disagree in all caps to make it dramatic
More RR please
This is just not true Philly have a better record without embiid than the bucks without Giannis
and this mf's are in the playoffs but i think rings matter
who's the most valuable player in the regular season
We will see who wins a championship However i do not care for ya'll predict or expectation for contenders and ask a question to your self who's a better leader than joel
giannis is and jokic is a better passer and facilitater then joel
it was pat bev and now rondo
Sheesh JJ was Embiids teammate & didn’t vote for him smh
The Sixers would be front runners with Markelle Fultz.  Too bad he was moved.
Maybe I’m trippin but at 9:26 they are saying game one is about to start… but also says they won the series 4-0. Am I missing something 😂
loved this take
Rondo needs to be a coach
Love how everybody says joker doesn’t have a team, he has all those assist… last time I check the person you pass it to has to make the shot in order for it to be an assist 😂praise him for the passes then turn around and say the people hitting the shots aren’t good😂make it make sense
Greek cocky 👎🏾
Tatum cant get mvp and he smoked each team he did Ginnasa by 40 pt blow out he beat emibid all season jokic lost to
Give it to embiid someone different
I think jokic is the best offensive player, but his defense is not as good as the other two.  Is the mavericks didn't suck doncic should have had it this year. But they were way too bad obviously he has 0 chance. Still doncic had an amazing season on a bad team
I think Joel deserves it, but for me i think Giannis doesn't get the respect he deserves and is the mvp.. He could lead the league in scoring if he didn't come out of games early cause Milwaukee is up by at least 10.
JOKIC MVP!
Giannis feeling that prime Lebron syndrome (being the best player in the league and not winning MVP every year)
How does Jokic have a better team with absolutely O all stars ????
Sixers without Embiid would barely make the playoffs, the Bucks and Denver can still be top 6 without their MVPs. The only shame if Embiid gets the MVP will be that he won't get out of the semis and his achievement will be shadowed by that.
When was JJ Reddick a primary scorer 😭😭😭😭😭😭 please dude don't kid yourself
Why do people think JJ Redick is a good analyst? He is so horrible, like KP tier of horrible.
Rondo is saying facts
Jj played with embiid how tf he dont understand Embiid Is the MVP.  Clown
I would take rondo over tobias harris going into the playoffs.
John 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
I honestly can’t wait to hear everyone when Giannis win the chip this year 😂
Embiid’s season…
Wow J. J. just contradicted himself he stated he would never vote for the player on the best team but this was his argument for Steve Nash winning the MVP which honestly is one of the most questionable MVP in the league’s history whether you agree or disagree
Bucks have a nasty roster  Bobby Jrue  Khris  Brook  Jae  Allen
Jokic hasn't gotten to a finals, and if he wins the MVP this year, that would be three MVPs and zero finals appearances! There has never been a player in NBA history that has won three MVPs and had zero finals appearances!
Embiid is the MVP. Period!
But JJ actually got a vote so he’s the one that matters
Keep being RONDO BACK!!
It's Giannis. Period.
How are you MVP IF you didn't win the ring, nor make it to the finals? I thought the purpose of the game was to win a RINGGGgg 🤔
Why is the woman even there 😂😂😂
Joel
Is this a sign that the bigs era is coming back?
Rondo has no rings 😂😂
Stephen A. backing up his Embiid mvp vote by saying 76ers are different without him and bluntly avoiding to speak about Denver without Jokic is just funny...
Embiid wasn’t great last year because his face was broken 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Jokic for MVP
Get Reddick outta here you were never a Sixer.
i just watch to hear rondo's voice
I don’t understand their voting strategies.  When Jokic doesn’t play, the nuggets have a bad record.  When Embidd and Giannis sit, their teams still win.
JJ Reddick is the new Gilbert Arenas
Wait I’m confused I thought JJ said on his podcast he voted for Embiid? Did he change it at least second? Also Joker was 25 12 10 JJ come on now do the rounding correctly.  Also Rondo Joker has never played with any all star, all nba, all defensive teammate EVER! Also has bottom 5 coach in playoffs.  Nuggets ON/OFF with Joker way better then Embiid/Giannis and Nuggets record without Joker much worse then Bucks/76ers/Warriors without Giannis/Embiid/Curry.  Giannis is the best 2 way player in the NBA the last 2-4 years (debatable how many years but def 2) and Embiid is incredible too, but their objectively not as VALUABLE to their team winning also if they best player always won MVP Wilt MJ LeBron all have 2-4 more MVPs each maybe more!  Also Embiid so far has quietly been nearly as bad as Harden just not as loud, but his efficiency has plummeted in playoffs so far a la Harden and Karl Malone. He should be better this year he’s due and hopefully can stay healthy.
Wait so no one talking about the fact that the Sixers have a better record without Embiid then bucks without Giannis ISNT THAT VALUE?
Yo why rondo is on tv he should be training for the playoffs 😂😂😂😂😂
Crazy ppl think Boston can't beat the Bucks
I can get down with these type of takes all day
Brooklyn in 6
Stephen's argument for embiid implodes on itself for MVP when you use the EXACT same argument for Jokic. EVERYONE on Denver is having career years. Denver isn't even in the playin without Jokic. Philly is. Harden, Harris, Maxey get you a playin team.
JOEL
Can we please bring up how he didn’t even come to town to play Joker and let his team get cooked by 20. His second best player is Harden (lead nba in assists) and still ducks smoke 💨 crazyyyy. Ngl it doesn’t really matter anyway because he WILL NOT WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR😂 JIMMY buckets is his father and everyone knows it.
It's crazy that Jokic was 0.2 assist shy of avging a triple double as a center and none of them was talking about him
I hate hearing jj honestly good player tho.
Rondo IQ is all time listen when he speaks
Right Embiid has to be Blissy or Snorlax in this playoffs 🤣🤣 His Stamina has to be to the Maxxxx 😅 MVP well deserved
Chris Webber voice: RONDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO only the real remember lol
Rondo looks like every kid that ever lived on the playground whose mom forced them into church for Easter
LMFAO love how Giannis highlights are only him brute-strengthing into the paint.
They should put Rondo and CP3 on the show together.
Rondo a coaching staff yet? He needs to soon, college or nba. Nba love hating on Giannis
Joel deserves this year. Even tho Giannis definitely ain’t getting his credit
Nuggets fan, but Joel and Giannis should get MVP before Nikola. Joker knew that sitting out games at the end of the season would damage his chances to win his third. And the truth is, Jokic does not even want to win MVP again. He sees it as a total distraction to his purpose as a Denver Nugget and as the best version of himself as a player, and that's to win an NBA Chip.
Embiid
Replace Perk with Rondo
Giving jokic 3 time mvp is quite a achievement for a individual who haven’t done much yet I think if repeating mvp, u should judge off the previous season
How did JJ Redick get a Vote so Fast?
Is race doesn't matter then why is the. NBA LOGO IS A WHITE MEN WHEN MOSTLY EVERY RECORD THAT WAS HELD OR BROKE CAME FROM A SO CALLED BLACK MEN
Good team here, finally a proper analysis. JJ AND RONDO is good for this show.
Joel with a previous MVP in harden and y’all say he doesn’t have anyone? Only reason Joel’s winning this is because they’re tired of Jokic and Giannis. Would take Giannis or Jokic 99/100 over Joel. Sad that your argument for Joel is that it’s his turn lol
Giannis is the mvp hands down embody misses two many games joker not a two way player
Dang Rondo outta the league dayumn!
Giannis is the mvp and DPOY
Did Rando really say the 76ers have no one? 😅 best supporting players in the league thats why they win games WITHOUT Embiid and the Bucks don’t win without Giannis.
Jokic is not no mvp man cut it out
if you had only pick to join your team out of these 3, lets behonest who would pick jokic or embiid. they arent champions and there is no historical evidence to think they would win a championship. Giannis is the clear answer. hes more dominnat then embiid. like ive seen giannis dunk on embiid mutiple times and jsut dismantle him over and over the past few years. Like embiid is a good defender but even he wont take the assignment on giannis for the game.
He would have to prove it against Giannis..but I feel he’ll get ran ..sorry ! James harden in the playoffs L
Perk really messed up jokic's chances of winning a 3rd mvp. Embiid had a great season so did giannis. But what jokic did this season for a bigger man is crazy. He lead the team in points,assists,rebounds. As well as to the number 1 record in the west.
The NBA is cool as long as a Black American doesn’t win the award.
I know rondo didn’t say Giannis had a better team around him than embidd when Giannis second best player was gone most of the season and he still has a better record than both. And if I’m not mistaken doesn’t embidd have 2 teammates scoring 20 plus a game
I really think they're giving Joel the vote only because of people thinking like SA.  It's more of a we owe him this one feel to me.. not saying he's not deserving of it but that's the feel I'm getting
Molly thinks she’s Kim k ?
Jokic for the 3 peat bro literally was undefeated with a triple double recorded
Have Rondo on again but call Ray Allen and put him in there with him. Let's see Rondo act like a baby like he always does when he gets even a little uncomfortable.
i want to see JOel cry,, Giannis for life.
Tell Jokic to brush his dam teeth
Stephen A prolly smoked a joint with Rondo before the airing, never heard him talking like a normal human being. Good job Rajon, our ears are in debt
“Giannis has a better team” is just a stupid reason not to give it to him. He cant win it because he has competent players around him? so we just never want the MVP to win the championship as well? You cant have it both ways fam if you’re going to discredit his team record as a case for MVP because he has a supporting cast then you need to recognise the numbers he puts up whilst needing to share the ball. It’s a ridiculous argument that i’m not sure how it’s become a trend to vote that way…
I SAY GREEK FREAK MVP
This guy's over here sleeping on Brooklyn, mikal bridges is going to spoil the sizers show I promise you guys
Kd was the best player this season. Pity he had injury. Truly a historic season offensively and a terrific season defensively
How does he look like a samurai and a catfish
Who da fook cares what JJ thinks?
Giannis is the best Player in the game. Should get MVP… Gets a ton of respect for staying in Milwaukee and not trying join with top free agents to get cheap rings… Jordanesque
Embid had 47 on Jokic
Jokic deserves it and he’s not going to get it, we’re not talking about the playoffs and what he’s won, we’re talking about the regular season and Jokic has been the best regular season player for these past 3 years.. Embiid bout to get a pity MVP
Do not ever have Rondo on the show again!  Dude is very boring and Basis!
Stephen needs to stop making basketball takes
Giannis Can’t Shoot end of story Embiid can shoot anywhere on the floor Embiid better then Giannis only thing y’all can say is that Giannis has a ring that’s it cause of his team
In regards to players being out, Middleton and Jrue has been out for long time(mostly Khris). MPJ and Murray has been out. Harden has been out so… 🤷🏽‍♂️
Harden has to average 27 maxey 25 and embiid 30 for sixers to win
So nobody thinks harden would turn back to old harden and give us 50 in the playoffs if embid went down the sixers are going to win either way how else they paying for this stadium 😂
I feel like Nets gonna win in game 7
I agree with Rondo. There's been plenty of times that I've watched the sixers and I catch myself saying "alright harden you gotta takeover" a lot. I'm a Rockets fans rooting for the Sixers to make the finals I love Embiids game and of course would love to see Harden get that ring!
Why does j.j. Redick get to vote?
Giannis should be the mvp but most likely won’t be
Rondo needs to be a coach somewhere . Underrated PG !
Perk sabotaged Jokic’s third MVP. No one wants to give it to him and appear “racist” or that BS of if he has 3 back to back are we saying he’s the best ever yada yada..
lets be real. when your as big as giannis and embiid you should be dominant and shoot ATLEAST 50% and above. kind of tired of these big men with really not much skill getting mvp every year. embiid deserves it more because atleast hes dominated atleast with a bit more skill, whats crazy is how players like donovan mitchell or tatum not even mentioned in discussion. just all big men, its disgusting imo.
He just hates embiid 😅
RONDOOOOOOOOO!!!!! IS THAT DUDE AND DESERVES HIS 💐 🌹
Playoff rondo talking playoff
Didnt Rondo pull a gun on his wife?
Lol Jj dropping the f bomb within 2 sec 😂
Rondo my fav pg of all time and Ima heat/Dwyane wade fan so that’s says a lot
SA: “JJ ur wrong but ur right”😂
I don’t understand how this is even up for debate… Embiid is literally the embodiment of MVP a center who moves shoots free throws can fade away this is ridiculous to debate
I think Embiid deserves it
Agreed, Denver without jokic is very good team,5-8 , however are you wothing for the player with the best season or MVP, player who push the team?
Rondo is right. Joel should be the MVP
What happened to that arrest & case between Rondo and his child’s mother in Kentucky? 🤔 That was a super wild story.
Weren't the 76ers 11-5 without him suiting up??
Mavs are a bottom G-league team for the last 4 years without Luka...just saying😏
The voters BETTER get it right this season. Embiid should win with Giannis & Joker as runner-ups.
Jokic played no defense all season 😂
Stephen A Smith said the same thing rondo said but backwards
Stephen A really loves the word "lament" but doesn't use it properly at all
Bro you give rondo a boosie fade and he’ll look a lot like him lmfao
Dude only looks at stats
I hate JJ
Embiid checked himself out of this race when he sat out at Denver.
With Stephen A's reasoning the MVP is Jokic.
They robbed Jokic because of politics smh 😂
That’s not Giannis fault that his teammates producing 76ers got a loaded roster ain’t nobody else’s fault they not playing up to the potential
Embiid out of all knows well he is only one guy and he can't do everything and he can't win like that without a team stepping up altogether.
Stephen A sticks to the same narrative every year - two time loser might get it right this year 👏
Rondo looks really bad
i cant even come close to describing the feeling i get from seeing Embid do the stuff he does on the floor....simply breath taking for a Big to be moving, playing and shooting the ball like that
The one thing I disagree with jj with is that Joel wasn’t good last playoffs the man was playing through a concussion and a broken orbital bone I mean the man could barley see out there😂
picking mvp by team win pct is dumb 😂😂😂
JJ’s thought process is contradictory. I get not wanting to split hairs over trivial things at the margins, but he literally said he’s not voting for the best player on the best team…then said he picked Giannis because he had a slightly higher win percentage…which is essentially picking the best player on the best team because you can easily cite injuries & personnel as reasons for the higher win percentage
wow first take where it was controlled and super in-depth!
Great show, can we do one more but without SAS?
And Lebron James wow fck espn were healthy now and we have taken out the bucks 2023    west is a joke so is the east @LakersNation
Giannis I’m sorry but embiid is clearly the MVP. Most dominant this whole year and he dominated them when he played them.
I have faith in Harden.
Rajon Rondo the man who threatened his own family with a gun now is on national tv, double standards I guess for some of these folks
@ESPN a show without Stephen A would be great
Denver Nuggets could use Rondo
Jokic MVP !!!
Giannis should win MVP
Real ones know Jokic is the true MVP
I like Rondo. All made great points.
i miss rondo in nba i hope he play again
Love Rondo. Also, without him saying much, Rondo’s presence alone demands deference from the other panelists. What a legend.
Nick claxton is being snubbed for all defensive team this year . It’s as if after kd and Kyrie trade the media just forgot about this guy and jumped on jjj jock
Jokic MVP
Rajon's first words in this video: I completely agree with you. ESPN: Stephen A. & Rajon Rondo DISAGREE with JJ Redick
The best part of this segment was Molly's silence.
We need this first take crew more, no Perkins, hate watching first take with Shannon Sharpe as skip is just too much, first things first and the inside guys are wayyyy better, Shaq and Barkley for fun, and brew and nick for everything else
Embid gotta moan less and smile for once and stop sitting out games so much and start facing the top guys, this has nothing to do with MVP per se but it is annoying
Good to see big men in the running for mvp where are the 3 point shooter's
Embiid man. Come on now, still getting DISRESPECTED????
Its kinder sucks winning your first MVP and its a glass ball
This MVP debates are stupid
havent watched first take the last couple of years as it felt like it became a caricature of itself with loud, obnoxious guests with cliche hottakes and little analysis. BUT if this is the direction its going with ex players that actually offer intelligent analysis and not loud lazy hot takes then i will definitely watch a lot more!
JJ REDDICK is so scary. Imagine him a school teacher.
Houston Harden is gone,along with his consistent 30+ point games. But can he average around 22-23 with 10 assists in the playoffs? He has been found out in the playoffs yearly. So if not, the 76ers go down unless Maxey is ready to be the no.2 guy. Which he isn't.
Rondo is really good at this do it dawg 💪🏽
Wassup with rondo like why the long face lol 😂 I’m just kidding man I love me some rondo and I’m glad he’s on first take
SAS somehow low-key popped at J.J...So you had three to pick from, so you went with 1 of 3 GOOD FOR YOU
My favorite point guard Chris Paul
Tbh I didn't know rondo could have hair
If we’re using the “they’re nothing without him” argument, Bron should’ve won every MVP for decades and Luka would be an easy candidate or Dame for that matter.   The award is called “most VALUABLE player”. Look at it that way.
I agree with Rondo
JJ show be in the stands watching the game. Should not be in that position.
JJ what you talking bout
The nets gone upset embiid
Good to see rondo back fr fr
Take James harden off the team and Joel Embid ppg will be about 26pts per game
Joel all day
Giannis is the clear MVP.  The best player should get the benefit of the doubt. If Joel wanted to prove he's the best player, his team would have homecourt advantage in the second round of the playoffs.
Stephen A hate on Russ and hard soooooo much smh
Came for rondo
I hate how JJ is saying Joel didn’t play good in the playoffs, not even mentioning the torn ligament or broken face.
Rondo looks like kat williams
Lol it feels like a lot of people just watch first take in clips
Reddick toxic af. The narrative all year was jokic is "dominating" while embid and giannis clearly played better. It should be a 2 man race. People like him love to act like embiid is getting pity votes
Rondooooo... haven't seen or heard of  him as late extremely intelligent individual  and along side these people great segment
Dididnt rondo point a gun at his family members? Why he on espn??
Stephan A’s view is flawed. He’s telling me that 76rs without embiid is worse than the nuggets without jokic. Blasphemous
I understand but those Celtics are loaded. I don't see anyone beating them this year.
We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo, We love Rondo,
I will say this for the 'new generation' in a way... this debate is pleasant and more logical.  I'm an old head but... isn't it kind of crazy that LeBron James last got an NBA MVP award 10 YEARS ago?  I get individual seasons and now decline, etc.  But that just seems crazy to me in totality.  For all of those years, arguably the best player of this generation wasn't the NBA MVP.  Never got another since leaving Miami.  Sure, finals MVP but still.  Doesn't seem right.
It should be Giannis
Matthew 16:26 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
repent and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour and receive salvation ❤️
Embid my pick ❤
Rondo I agree with his analysis on Harden. He needs to be more
Embiid is the mvp he’s the first center since shaq to lead the league in scoring back to back seasons and harden and maxey missed a month each and the 76ers best record in the league since January
Jayson Tatum for MVP ☘️
I disagree with Smith to say that sixers don't play well without embiid what games was he watching ?
I don't understand stephen A's argument. Who is Jokic's Harden? What are the Nuggets without Jokic?
I used to really like this show but now I see that theyre biased af.. always sucking the lakers dck.
Do it even matter when none of those 3 winning a chip this year😂😂😂
Amazing take guys, loved it!
I'll give you a straight fact. Rondo is a punk who spits in people's faces who's opinion doesn't matter.
I would never vote for the best player and the best team. Votes for yannis 🤡
Joel is not the MVP he is a second round exit.
So if you're a superstar on a great team you're always going to lose to somebody who's just as good but on a sorry your team 🤔
I am surprised Rondo still doesn't have a team picking him up for coaching spot.
Giannis getting the LeBron treatment
stephn a going with a brother why isn't it suprising
We need more Chris paul and JJ on the show together.
The MVP should be the best player period. I love Steve Nash but he should have never won over Shaq.
F U Reddick
my mvp gianiss antekeqompoh💪💪💪💪
"Was he right?  Yea.  But he's white and you know the rule. We can be ignorant as long as it's disagreeing with a white person.
Rondo looks like he’s trying to take Kat Williams’ look!  What gives?
Good to see my boy rondo! He rubs some the wrong way but none can deny he knows his basketball 💯 keep more rondo coming
Cannot wait until its all new media and we don't have to listen to this clown .
JJ has something against embiid after that argument with Perkins. So does Perkins. Both of them are picking Giannis now? Interesting 🤔
Y’all be disrespectful to James harden
I enjoy smart analysts talking to each other, not big heads like perk yelling over everyone
Max kellerman lite lol😂
Career year? I guess Steven a forgot brook played on the nets
Seeing Rondo and JJ shows how dumb Perk is
I am never felt more disappointed in JJ ever than in his comments about the MVP
interesting how ppl speak about the Records without the star players and do not add the additional context of who else wasn't playing. alla Middleton and the bevy of injuries from the DEN earlier on.
JJ is obsessed with numbers holy sh*t.. that’s all this mf talks about always
There's no way Giannis wrote that tweet
Now you guys are talking about teammates huh where were you when Harden has no teammates and carry the team to second best record around the league but Steph got the big3 and won the MVP huh?
Love Reddik as a sixers fan but did he really just knock Embiids playoff performance last year when he played with a broken face from a dirty play? Come on man….
The media bias against Giannis is just ridiculous at this point.   Stephen A voted for Embiid coz Bucks were good without Giannis, but the reality is Bucks were 11-8 without Giannis and Sixers were 11-5 without Embiid.   Rondo says he prefers Embiid coz Embiid carried them while Harden was out, but the reality is Harden missed 24 games while Middleton missed 49 and was coming off the bench and on mins restrictions half the time he did play.  Yet Bucks still got the best record in the league. Giannis was just 2nd player ever to average 30+10+5 on 50%+ shooting and played DPOY level defense all year. But Embiid will end up winning simply because he hasnt won one before LMAO
Enbiid is MVP
among the 3 only Giannis has a ring. These guys are just hating knowing that the best players right now in the league aint american.
It's a teamwork, you have to analyze how good these players are in the context they are. Philadelphia is the worst team, for sure, it demanded more from Embiid than for others. Were Jokic or Giannis in Philadelphia, would they have achieved more?
And what would Denver be without Jokic?
76ers were 11-5 without Embiid so what is SAS talking about?? The only team that lost more than they won without their star player were the Nuggets (5-8).
I don't mind who wins as long as it's not that clown Jokic
People keep forgetting to mention that Maxey and Harden were both out for over a month each at separate times while Embiid kept the sixers not only above water but a top seed. Joel is the MVP.
One man most definitely can't beat us in a 7 game series jj stfu
It may be weird.But they all said correct stuff
Nuggets without Jokic = worst team in NBA. Nuggets with Jokic = best team in NBA. Most valueble player is Jokic by a wide margin.
Rondo collecting a check
Giannis is the real mvp..his stats don´t lie
Really? They are debating Giannis vs. Embiid, but.... there's a guy named Jokic.. you know.. the triple double machine leading his team to 1st place in the west? that guy?
Stephen A you a fool for that Harden jab at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Who’s looking for a new contract by the way 👍👍👍🤣🤣🤣🤣 LMAO
Would love to see more of Rondo and JJ! Basketball talk at it’s finest
Joel has to be a little more selfish??? He shoots more than anyone now no? Maybe Doncic? How much more selfish does he have to be AI levels, where he takes all the shots?
Middleton was down for 49 games....so harden missing 24 is a BS argument... Ain't maxey better than portis? Or vrook Lopez? Ain't harris a 50/38/85+- guy who can give u 18/7? Cmon now....
I'd like to see Philadelphia get to the ECF at least.
"Team around Jokic and Giannis is better, that is why I will vote for Embiid" - stats don't lie monkeys, 76ers have better record when most valuable Philadelphian doesn't play compare that to Bucks and Nuggets before you say something stupid again.
Jj getting no more applause at s philly
You wouldn't want to play poker against Rajon Rondo. Dude has a poker face all the time.
Wth was that at 6:37 JJ 😄
My bros go YouTube: are you a good person by living waters
This one of the better conversations I've seen on First Take in a long time. Having multiple former players on together, both with high basketball IQ's & a calm demeanor about themselves actually brings out the best in Stephen A.
These guys just have to admit that they're voting Embiid because it's his "turn". Now we pretend that Harden is some scrub that without Embiid, Sixers ain't winning any series.
Doc not winning a chip in Philly less it's a perfect storm
So based on Stephen A's logic - I say to all the aspiring kids out there that hope to one day win an MVP,  make sure you're on a team that's good, but not that good without you. Because if you're team is a bit too good, you have no chance of winning an MVP
BLACKS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS12 tribes of Israel we are God chosen Hebrew Israelites of the earth
completely fair, but where tf was this pov in 2018????
Embiid is third in my mind. Jokic's deep stats show him as being like twice as impactful a player compared to the other two. Giannis is dominant and kills teams when he's in. Every argument for Embiid is a pity, aesthetic, or narrative pick. He doesn't beat the other two in any other statistical or impact category.
These debate shows are garbage
Can Stephen A Smith use this theory when comparing MJ to LeBron? LOL
Harden is a lot better than any teammate Giannis has. Thats all I got to say
How does JJ get a vote?
East coast/West coast media… constant bias against the Midwest. Constant NY, Boston,L.A, Duke employees. NFL it’s constant Patriots/Dallas coverage by former players. - it’s nonstop. That said, Bucks will get shafted by Zebras vs Philly/Celtics. Celtics officiating is a hands down thee worst.
I'm glad Steven a. Pulled up harden history
JJ and Rondo show would be 🔥
Brooo its jokic no doubt 💯💯💯
We need more players like Rondo on this show instead of this dope head with his receding hairline or KP breathing like a neckbeard on a Discord call waiting for his Lil kitten to respond to his many requests to have them date him
Not all 5 years ….
Games played Jokic: 69 Embiid: 66 Giannis: 63  Team Win/loss when playing Bucks with giannis 47-16 (75%) Denver with jokic: 48-21 (70%) Philly with Embiid: 43-23 (65%)  Team Win/loss when not playing Denver without jokic: 5-8 (38%) Bucks without giannis 11-8 (58%) Philly without Embiid: 9-5 (69%)  Denver 1st in west. Milwaukee 1st in east. Philadelphia 3rd i east.  PER stats: Jokic 31.5 Embiid 31.4 Giannis 29.0
Don't know how Stephen A can sit and make up such stories Everytime.. Philadelphia actually have a better record without Embiid this season than with him. And he sits there and talk about how much worse Philadelphia are without Embiid than Milwaukee without Giannis. Pathetic.
But what if the nets pull an upset? Lol
No one is better than joker , if he gets to the usage percentage of mbid he might score 37-38 ppg
does stephen a not realize philly has to get through boston to face milkwaukee. he says the sixers would have a better chance against milwaukee but have close to no chance against boston but the sixers play the celtics before the bucks...
MJ could have won 10. Bird could have won 7. Embiid is lucky Jokic has been out.
Stephen A. reason for voting for Embiid is like “his team sucks without him” yet his win percentage is lower than the other two. also it’s more like a coaching issue..
Nice to see Rondo. Giannis all day. Joel Embiied crying his way to an MVP and Perk making it racial changed it for Joker. Embiied gonna win it, but I’d have him third.
So now, if you are in a better team, that's at your disadvantage :))) I cannot fathom the amount of bs that is laid in these shows all year round. They say one thing, then the opposite....
“Need all cylinders clickin” - Rondo
What are three stats that should be used judge who is MVP? It is unnecessary debate when everybody knows what numbers are like. NBA should not b like Oscars or Emmies where people vote for personalities they like no matter how mediocre
JJ is clearly biased against Joel. You can vote against some1 & not be biased, but peep the over explaining & the redundant "I can't vote that way," w no proper explanation. He even used air quotes while saying, "Joel is having an historic season." It's clearly on his face & in his Tone. But Ik, y'all don't see any of that bc "JJ IS SO INTELLIGENT." 🙄 🤦🏾‍♂️
Of course, Stephen A disrespecting Gainnis again. Giannis I'd the MVP.
Milwaukee has it all?! Are you kidding me…giannis built that team from dirt
GIANNIS ALL DAY
Can we just appreciate it's a big man's games again
If you have a deep understanding of the NBA game, you know Rondo has one of the top 3 highest basketball iqs of all time. After Magic no other point guard definitively has a higher iq
Rondo could still play. Under freaking rated point guard in history
Rondo brings that calmness to everything he does. Love that dude, what a gem to have in the basketball world.
Jokic obviously 😂😂😂
Add me to the hundreds of voices that really liked this group compared to normal. Good discussion, not all the antics that many find fun but just disinterest me
I don’t like how they talk about Philly without Embid while the nuggets would literally be a lottery pick team without jokic
JJ dude always trying to be controversial.  Suck as a player and voter.
The media is in love with Embid.. giannis is treated like the unwanted child.. media never talks about giannis..
3:26 76ers are 11-5 without Embiid this season. Bucks are 11-8 without Giannis this year. Stephen A is wrong. JJ bases his takes on logic, and Stephen A bases his on emotion and “feel.”
About time you brought back fake god Stephen A. Smith on YouTube Trending. Its time for his fanatics to face consequences.
If Steven A is EVER RIGHTabout ANYTHING, is by PURE COINCIDENCE. Clown show.
I wish Giannis would call out Stephen A for the constant disrespect he gives him
We need more Rondo and JJ on the show together. This is true basketball analysis from intelligent players, not just personalities.
Dude ducked a head to head game with jokic and you award him with mvp
How is that argument for Embiid being made but not Jokic? Jokic has the worst team of all three of them. Embiid lead his team in scoring and rebounding but Jokic lead his team in scoring, rebound and assists?
I'd pick JT
I personally think Giannis is the MVP.... but they're gonna give it to Joel...
Steven A’s response made no sense the bucks are 11-8 without Giannis this season while the 76ers are 11-5 without Embiid it’s simple math. So by his ideology he should’ve voted giannis or jokic.
Joel was good but not great in previous playoffs because he was injured in some capacity. Now he’s as healthy as he’s ever been in the playoffs. This changes everything. Embiid is going to MVP his way to a finals. Just you watch. 💪🏽😤🙌🏽🥳🥂
Love when these guys can have civil discussions like this.
Damm, it’s Chris Paul. He’s everywhere
Stephen A took that "oscillate" personally lol
I think the MVP candidates should battle it out 1-on-1 to see who wins. Embiid would still dominate. 😤MVP!
Why does Stephen A’s opinion matter over JJ who played in the league? Why is it always Stephen A featuring someone else whose a baller.
Stephen A has pictures of someone. How's he have a job?! He's never been good isn't and won't be. Thank God he dropped the angry loud black man shtick mostly.
Debate shows are as stupid as Stephen A.
Didn't Rondo call Stephen A  "btch a$$ reporter" in his locker room years back 🤔 lol
“But u only get to pick 1” (looks away) “good for u” 🤣🤣🥴 Most condescending man ever! Lol
I'm just so happy that all three top MVP candidates are BIGS🎉🎉🎉🎉
Joël embiid is the MVP
All their arguments are for Joker…He has no All Stars, leads all advance stats, best offensive and defensive rating, played more games…only thing he doesn’t have going for him is that he is not black
The proof is in your eyes when you watch them play when all three 100% full throttle I'm still taking embiid
Love the guys.  Love JJ, love Rondo, but always forwarding through the SAS portions.  He's as annoying to me as Lavar Ball.  Maybe Smith is playing a character, but man, what an abrasive personality it is.
Stephen is a mmmm ........er...... racist......... Shut up
Should be between Gianni’s and jokic if you watched all year without bias and media influence
Rondo take ts out yo head please bruh 😂💀
Bruh if joel don’t get it this year it’s fkin crazy
Jojo triple teamed every nite. Case closed.
The fact Jokic and Giannis have 2 MVPs each when Joel Embiid was right next to them in all of those 4 MVP races yeah I think he deserves it. The only other guy who would deserve it would be Giannis because he has a ring he’s a proven beast but no this is a regular season award
Rondo is who made me fall in love with basketball
wow its so strange to see competitive rondo vs his on air personality. Rondo should have won an mvp
If only perk never used that race card.
Stephen A , Emiid doesn’t guard Giannis, Giannis is not a center  What match up are you talking about ?
Its his first year but way better than perkins.
The fact that we are talking about 3 big men in the mvp conversation in a shooting league is amazing love it.
Yeah, Joel did not have anyone else in his team... Except for a top 75 player of all time named James Harden, who happens to lead the league in assists and be an All Star snub this year. Joker just had the most overall efficient year of all by advanced statistics, again, but Perkins' racial narrative destroyed his case. And the disrespect to Harden, not to even mention him when talking about Embiid, is unbelievable.
I hate the "leading the league in scoring" by scoring average. The scoring title belongs to the person who scores the most points. Players who don't miss games need to be rewarded. JOEL EMBID DOES NOT LEAD THE LEAGUE IN SCORING. He's deserving every other accolade tho
How do we get more Rondo? He's been very good every time I've seen him recently
If Jokic was brown he wouldn’t have one mvp.
I think it’s funny people think Embiid is suddenly gonna become a great playoff performer. He is a chronic playoff choker and he will be average like he always is. Nets in 6
Good to see you Rondo hopefully you will be in Espn as Commentator!!!!
this is the closest mvp race in the last 10-20 years
Embid
Embiid has a better supporting cast than Jokic.
He said that Embiid is everything in Philly...they played without Embiid and they have like 11-5 record or better
If Rondo dont join Lakers. Bring em back every Tue during playoffs
NBA and MLB both need MOP and MVP awards.  Giannis has been MOP the last five years.  Make the MOP the regular season award and select the MVP after the playoffs.
Agree to disagree but seems like jj outsmarted himself. Jus because of other ppl narrative for Joel he found reasons to have different narrative. EMBID!! offense n defense plus team around him. SIMPLE
There was a time that for no reason at all I didn't think Rondo could speak English.. bro is from the hood. Like I said, no idea.
If you’re going off of that logic, SAS, then Jokic is the MVP. Nuggets are worse without Jokic than the 76ers were without Embiid.
Embiid is the MVP
i feel like rondo coulda been cast as one of those soulless black dudes in "get out"
JJ Redick is a clown. How were you on our team and not vote for Embiid. Watch your back traitors out here
Philly literally has James harden. Better then anyone on the bucks besides giannis lmao
Thank you rondo this man speaking nun but facts bout Philly.
Rondo has zero idea what he is talking about here.. THE SIXERS WON MORE GAMES THAN ANY OF THOSE TEAM WITH EMBIID NOT PLAYING.. DENVER WERE THE WORST without Jokic playing and then Giannis.. Ppl say stuff with zero clue..
Giannis is the MVP EVERY YEAR STOP IT !!!!
The cavs should have resigned Rajon that man ain’t do nun wrong his girl lied and it fucked up his life,I knew from the moment I heard the bs it was bs
Nobody cares about MVP. It’s all about winning the championship. Basketball is a team forget the individual performances
"I think Joel has to be more unselfish and letting James getting back to the player he was in Houston"🔥🔥🔥
Stephen A is spitting. Embidd hands down!
Rondo looks like a turtle
Jokic 3 peat
harden is averaging 21 and 10! not like he's playing like a scrub!!!
ESPN pushing narrative on embiid..
What a healthy convo
Wait a second, JJ gets an actual vote???  This isn't like college football where thousands of people vote.  There are only 100 people who vote and one of them is JJ Redick???  smh
JJ is deft as an analyst.
Jokic because he’s white.
My idol cp3
When you have an agenda to push, you tend to be very selective on what you see as true. Embiid's case is not better than Giannis on any level so they ignore Giannis and go to Jokic. With Jokic they literally have to make up stuff that does not count in the criteria for MVP which has lead to them spreading lies about a lot of people because Embiid's case is not better than Jokic's.
you remove giannis from bucks they are still a playoff team or even jokic, but embiid carry literally phily he deserves it
RONDO DISAGREES WITH JJ REDICK first thing rondo says is I agree with u Jj
Rondo and JJ sitting down with Stephen and Molly is so awesome please more of this
Stephen A is just a Giannis hater don't forget he once said he would pick ja Morant over Giannis😂😂
at this point idc who wins MVP, they're all great and they're all spectacular on what they do, add that they all are high seeds for the playoffs 😂
2:35, Stephen A.!!!🤣😂💯is right.  JJ is trying to keep everybody happy. You can only pick one.💯
1:00,💯And Joel Embiid is the MVP in 2023💯
Smith is a self serving, self aggrandizing  loud mouthed idiot
Give the scoring title to Embiid, the DPOY to Giannis and the 3rd MVP trophy to Jokic.  That's how you do it.
If the vote occurred right before the nba finals.. the mvp would belong to Giannis. We now live in an era where we give regular season mvps when mvps should go to those who lead a team to playoffs and championships
it should be embiid
If Jokic hadn’t won the last two in a row he would probably be MVP considering how bad the nuggets are without him, but to win three in a row you need something special. So I think Embiid will win.
What a surprise racist take has 2 black guys disagree with a white guy .shocker
If Embid Don’t Win We Riot !!!!!!!!!!!
This  man  call Stephen  a Smith  hate  the bucks  so  bad.  and  it is not  even  fun.  Hope  the bucks  win  this year  and  shame  that  big  clown 🤡.  And make  him  look very bad. Bucks in  6
SA has a lot so say to never picked up a basketball 🏀 😂
Rondoo
What are they talking about Milwaukee won 1 more game then Boston and Boston won 3 more games then Philly Denver won 2 more games then Memphis and Memphis won 3 more games then Sacramento!! Nobody even won 60 games!! There are no standouts best team in the league won 58 games there are no standouts!
SA a hater everything he say is about Milwaukee
Stephen A🙌🙌🙌
How tf is it an “aesthetics call” when Joel has been domination on both the offense and defense??  JJ’s a sly mf acting like defense isn’t counted.
They on Milwaukee it's our time
How does JJ get a real MVP vote already
Ain’t no way in the world in a race like this you don’t try to help your old teammate win an award . Smh goofy
First pitty vote I've seen in years. They feel sorry for joel
Fr tho this season is really forcing people to look at what they consider for mvp. It’s making people really think about what the mvp is with 3 great players having amazing years that all look very different yet all end up producing very compelling arguments for the award. So now people are forced to have the conversation both with others and with themselves on what it means and what they value in the mvp. I think that’s long overdue and very cool that it’s happenign
Wow what a great ep loving this dynamic of basketball minds together 🔥
Rondo on ESPN is dope 🔥
hope to see more rondo!!
So the mvp is basically the most dominant and important player in the shittiest team that’s making the top 5 in standings?
Stop effing over Joel on MVPs like ya'll did Harden. Give it to them when they deserve it, in their healthy prime. Yal stay wanting to give everyone else and their mama an extra MVP. How about we go in order and go by who earned it THIS year. Joel has done slightly more with slightly less than Giannis. Jokic can always win it but he mails it in a lot. He never has to try his hardest to get consideration. He has an aura of complacency at times. Joel is actually burning the midnight oil, getting hurt only to come back early. Harden's offense is as fickle as an ex wife. Joel is the clear front runner. Everyone else isn't pushing themselves to their limit just to stay above water. Giannis and Jokic are putting in above average effort and are getting good results, but not exhausting themselves because of team limitations.
Whenever I see JJ on First Take it feels like it's his show and Stephen A is a guest 😅. His presence, knowledge, and way of talking are more captivating than Stephen A just screaming and using bias in his arguments
Obviously Jokic should win MVP.
And with all that's said,,,,,,,,, JOKER is the MVP!!!!!
Wait… no way they DISAGREE?!? Insane
JJ I think the phrase should be “histoRIC season” not historical.
“Embiid didn’t have a good post season last year” - jj reddick   Embiid played with a broken face man what did you want him to do?
It’s whatever Rondo says.. I mean it’s the playoffs and it’s Rondo talking
Stephen A: I choose Embiid over Giannis because Giannis team is better.   Also Stephen A: I think the Embiid and the Sixers would have a better chance against Giannis and the Bucks match up wise.  Bro this feels like a contradiction.
Stephen A. That wasn’t a good enough take I’m sorry!
Cool seeing Rondo. JJ get him on your podcast man.
I Look At , Like This Have The 76s Been Number 1 Seed Anytime This Season? Have The 76s Been Top of The Power Rankings This Season? And The Bucks Have Been The Best Defensive Team This Season n That Start With Giannis n Brook Lopez….Giannis Is THE BEST PLAYER in The NBA Right Now So I Vote For Giannis Over Embiid
Yo JJ!!! I'm glad the Sixers let you go, you friggin sellout!!! How dare you diss Embiid that way??
Jokic MVP again ❤.
I have never understood why people think the MVP is the person who is most valuable to their team. That would make you that team’s MVP. This is a league award
The Greek freak is shaq in this era bruh his definitely unstoppable
All three have stacked teams
Jokic wants a championship Bottom line ______ YALL CAN HAVE THE MVP
I'm disappointed with what JJ said, smh.
It’s the joker by a land slide
Embiid is great but its no way you can say Giannis hasn't played better then both of them
How does Embiid not have a nucleus around him? Stephen A lists coaching and Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday as the tools that Giannis has... Uhm does Doc Rivers not coach the 76ers? Is James Harden, a former MVP and scoring champion, not on the team? They talk out of two sides of their mouth, so when JJ gives them actual evidence that can be supported they disagree? This is why the MVP voting is faulty. Giannis is the MVP. He is the most valuable player in the league. Embiid and Joker are very valuable, but they don't move the needle like Giannis does. Have the 76ers and Nuggets make any noise in the playoffs, no? Do players play better around them? No. Giannis truly dominates and facilitates.
What about Denver without Jokic ????
I am loving that all 3 big men are MVP candidates, oh how I wish more big men become as dominant as these three. Bring back the big men of the NBA
The emphasis on DISAGREE on the title lol whoever is tying that R-E-L-A-X
i love to hear vets like rondo with his great basketball knowledge speak, he needs more appearances
Bra get rondo out of here man. His ego just ain’t it, he’s hiding it obviously, but bra just wants to get paid man, he ain’t care bout this show or talks, tell me y’all read his body Language🤦🏽‍♂️ L ESPN. Diss why TNT better
JJ knows all too well about Philly chances against Boston, he was there for the confetti game 🎊🎉🎊😂😂😂
JJ ‘embid was playing hurt last year playoffs did u forget? 😂
absolutely fantastic debate. this sets the bar high, good job First take.
Was expecting a rondo and jj back and forth, but fricking Stephen A’s big face hugging the camera and his voice is in my head now….
Rondo is real. Keep him on
I don’t like Stephen As first argument because with his logic of giannis has more help than embiid then it should be Jokic considering he has the least amount of help between the 3
Stephen A Smith and Skip just dislike Giannis…
Jj Hates Joel from Philly lmaoo
This was actually a really good basketball discussion
Giannis is the best player in the league, irrespective of narrative or help
I always felt like rondo would sound different lol idk why
Any of them can win MVP, i wont disagree the results either but i will choose Giannis to win this year 😎
So with that logic, AD should win MVP no?
If it wasnt for the narrative then Giannis would be a lot closer in this race.
Please keep rondos IQ on tv. Love to actually hear him explain more in depth ball.
JJ a Snake 😂
Eh you take middleton off the bucks and the bucks have won like 45 something games without him, take harden off philly and they are in the lottery they wouldn’t of even been close to the play in
JJ is correct. Giannis is the MVP. Just stop it.
Stephen A will ALWAYS be a Bucks and Giannis hater
if embiid gets robbed again this year for mvp it better be giannis
Embid is better because Giannis team is stronger? This vote is a farce;
Racist.
no one cares go direct to playoffs talk.
I’m alright with anything, I just want to know why weren’t all of these people saying this about Embiid before the Racist controversy. The sudden switch is crazy
One thing for sure:  if Embiid meets Giannis in the playoffs, or if either of them meets Jokic in the finals, you know the one who didn't get the MVP will be extra motivated when playing against the one who did.
We need this more !!!!
I’m strong on kola idc what the nba determines.
Bridges is carrying the Nets to the eastern finals.
Stephen A’s point can be made for Jokic too. Without him, the nuggets are bums
More rondo plz
Steven A can actually put together a decent argument when he’s not doing the character stuff. That’s funny sometimes and has its place, but it’s also cool to watch all three of them talking like this too.
Joel consistently plays worse in the playoffs
"The Sixers start and finish with embid" facts Steven.A
Embidd was .6 assist away from averaging 33-10-5 on the same time hitting more free throws
MVP Conversation is not serious: 1. Best player in the league? 2. Biggest impact on a team? 3. Most Valuable Player in the League -- The League (most jerseys sold, tickets, ratings?)  If one certain player who has scored more than any player in history and broke the record this year while averaging 29 in year 20 isn't in consideration, what is the criteria?
All we know is that the MVP won't be from the US. And as for who "wins", does it even matter?  We know who the Top 5 or 10 players are in the NBA, and it's impossible to definitively say which is most "valuable", especially since there is no single yardstick to decide. Part statistics, part team success, part subjective "how good is he", part subjective "how would the team be doing without him". They're not playing to be MVP, they're playing to win each game they're in, and to win a championship.
JJ’s “deciding factor” is beyond ignorant in my opinion. Embiid has by far the worst and least consistent supporting cast of the 3.
This years MVP  is and was altered by Perks race remarks now everyone doesn't want look "racist". Smh
Wow can’t believe jj turned his back on his brother embiid
Gianni’s shot 55% FG percentage by charging and dunking 90 percent of his shots, he can’t shoot he’s just a successful Ben Simmons. That’s not great imo… And Jokic is completely useless at one side of the court… THIS is how you create an non existent argument where one doesn’t exist…!!!!!
For JJ to be a part of Embiid playoff history , he sure downplays him every chance he gets
Two of these guy’s just don’t belong here…!!!!
Stephen A brings up the Bucks' record without Giannis, well, the Nuggets have BY FAR the worst record without their top guy. Jokic is easily the mvp
Most valuable team? 😂
76ers to inconsistent.. they not going past 2nd round
When you have to score a triple double for your team to win a consistent basis (very little stat padding), the case makes itself (Joker). The problem is that no one believes Denver will go beyond the second round of the playoffs (despite this being a regular season award). The MVP-Champion correlation just isn't there.
There’s no wrong pick amongst the top 3
Giannis or Jokic is my MVP. Dosent matter which. But it's just funny the narratives that espn, kendrick perkins and stephen a create. Like the disrespect towards Tatum and Jokic is so funny. None of you have a mind of your own either, so you just listen to what these guys say.
Redick: “I don’t vote for best player on best team” Also Redick: “I’m voting Giannis MVP”  And to be fair Embiid had a broken face and broken finger on shooting hand in last year’s playoffs
Welcome to the real world Giannis, Lebron been dealing with this for like 10 years now 🤷🏽‍♂️
I thought that was Myles O'Neal 😅😂🤣😭
we need more rondo!
i dont understand this narrative that embiid has the worst team of all 3 lmfao. look at the record of these teams without them. bucks are a playoff team when giannis doesnt play, the sixers too. they both have winning records... nuggets without jokic? lmfao they are like 3-7. jokic got the worst team and its not close. when he doesnt play the nuggets lose every game by like 30 lmfao
The Sixers can't win championships right now.
People love to diminish Giannis. His team hasn't been healthy/consistent all year, but he'll get penalized for having a better team?
Let’s be honest, I not want Joel to win the MVP award out of Pity!
I clicked on it because I wanted to see what a “professional Rondo” looks like. I’m stupid for thinking Rondo would wear a suit and tie 😅😅
Cap. Philly would be fine without Embid they miss him like half the season, and they have the 3rd best record in the east. Giannis has the best record in the league not just the east and is more available for his team. All these players are super important to their team. Giannis for MVP!
What happened to the white people hating Perkins.  It's pathetic that ESPN has to apologize for him coming up with fake stats and calling MVP voters racist.
Stephen A’s argument is even more true for jokic than Embiid 😂.. nuggets have a significantly worse record when he doesn’t play compared to when Embiid plays.. And there Off On numbers are jokic is clearly more valuable
ROOOOONNNDDOOOOO
MY 🐐 RAJON RONDO!
SAS does make a fair point that the bucks are insanely good with or without giannis
Analysis from JJ and Rondo  “You’ve got to answer the call” from Stephen A 😐
When Rajon Rondo speaks you listen…this mans basketball IQ is off the chains bro.🔥
voter fatigue on Europeans and whites 😂 nba is too woke to give another mvp to Jokić who is most deserving
Giannis
Giannis is the best combination of offense and defense in the league currently.
Hey look it's Chris Paul!!!
Embid team does play good without him. If you took Jokic off the Nuggets they would dropout of the playoffs. Jokic isn't even talk about despite being responsible for the most wins in the west. It's amazing the conversation isn't around Jokic.
Anyone that watches basketball knows Gianni's has been the MVP for last couple years. Jordan got fucked, Kobe got fucked, and Giannis is getting fucked now.
Wins is a team stat....it can be a factor but saying that is what it comes down to is whack af. JJ is way off saying that nonsense.
What rondontalking about Harden played 58 games
Giannis don't deserve it this year. Jokic has by far been the most consistent. All Giannis does is travel 3-4 steps everytime he dunks and never gets called for it
1. Joker 2. Giannis 3. Embiid  **Crazy if Joker does not make it to All Nba first team this year.
9-5 without embid  11-7 without Giannis 4-8 without Jokic   Stephen A’s point is dumb af
Jokic makes 2/3 of his shots, #1 in Offensive & Defensive Plus-Minus, PER, VORP, elite passer  He’s still the best
If Embiid has arrived he will roll all the way to the Finals smooth and easy.
It's Giannis or Jokic as the MVP. Stats and team importance of those two are way better than Embiid. I'm telling you right now, if Embiid wins MVP and MIL face PHI in the Playoffs? Man, Giannis would absolutely destroy Embiid just like what Hakeem did to DRob in the 90s.
RONDOOOOOOO!!!🐐
Jj redick isn’t allow in Philly no more!
Finally no Perkins take 😅
Has no playoff team picked up rondo?
Perhaps JJ is trying to avoid the appearance of bias towards Embiid by taking this position. If so, he has swung way too far in the other direction. He looks like an Embiid hater now. It's clearly Embiid's year of domination, yet JJ can't even acknowledge this and vote for his friend and former teammate.  If it really is such a toss-up (which I don't believe it is), then why vote for Giannis? Back up your boy!
Reality is this is about race more than anything else. If this was about the most actual valuable player jokic wins this hands down .  He is near the top in rebounds and assists and makes everyone better. Does embiid make harden better??? No does giannis make Middleton better....noo.  Gordon is having a career year with jokic. Murray is back to what he was with Jokic
Embiid not that good with out Harding. Embiid is getting really good but he not dominating like Joker and The Freak
if were are being honest ALL THIS PROVES IS WE NEED MORE REGULAR SEASON AWARDS. the game has changed why not add more mvp type of trophies for these type of players moving forwards. i just know it'll only get more difficult as the game grows and the skill set for players also grows..
Lmao at Steven A sneaking in that money comment at the end
If only GA didn't have to leave those Miami and Atlanta games 4-5 minutes in and play hurt I'd feel like he would have a strong case. Before exiting those games he was averaging 32.4/12.1/5.6 so he probably would have finished 32/12/6 minimum and had a good shot at it. Doesn't sound like too much of an upgrade from 31/11.8/5.7 but that first statline is "sexier" lol. I still feel like he should be more in the conversation because the straw polls show it's basically either Embiid or Jokic for MVP but it is what it is. If it's gonna go to 1 of those 2 then I hope it's Embiid. Kareem, Jordan, LeBron, and Giannis were all denied 3 straight even though they were deserving, but didn't get it because it was either the "Next guy's turn" or "He didn't have enough post season success yet" and even tho it may be a stupid way of voting, I'd rather the historical narrative be upheld. This stuff matters and if Jokic 3-peats for the first time since Bird, and is only the 3rd player to ever do it(Wilt may have done it but I'm not sure) we're gonna be talking about "Is Jokic a top 20-25 player all time already?"
Lets go Jokic 3x MVP
Good job by Rondo. See a lot of these former athletes come on and seem to feel the need to be overly aggressive and assertive. Seems like Rondo is actually taking the time to put some thought into what he says and is just getting warmed up.
Giannis gets penalized for establishing a winning culture in milwaukee. The bucks used to be always 1 piece away. They got that piece, won a chip and now its used against him.
I respect these long clips but a full show is a full show
Rajon Rondo best fit in coach, Houston, Charlotte, Pistons, Portland,  Timberwolves or Wizards 🤔🤔🤔
I often agree with Stephen A, but how can he mention the way the Bucks and the Sixers look without Giannis and Embiid, without saying how below average the Nuggets are without Jokić (5-8 record when he doesn't play) and would probably struggle to even make the play-in tournament. Apart from that, he is literally Denver's backbone. Without him they play a completely different brand of basketball that is much less creative, organized and simply worse.
What’s wrong with going first on a debate?
You don't think  giannis makes jrue holiday's job easier? Or brook Lopez? Or Portis? Yea they're having  career  years but it's because  of Giannis
The fact embid ducked joker is enough to see he didnt want that mvp that either would have gave it to him or not depending if he won
Rondo and JJ stating facts which is play offs are more draining mentally.. not numbers..
Can't understand why the best player on the best team can't win the MVP. I hate that narrative.
It's funny when they all agree that statistically all three guys deserve to win the MVP, but when they choose who the MVP is they fall back on their opinions.  Yet, Redick says that he doesn't like the idea of giving an MVP to Embiid because it's "his turn."    Well, if all three guys are equally-matched, what other *FAIR* statistic is left?  Jokic has 2, Giannis has 2, Embiid has zero.....  The 2022-23 NBA MVP should be Joel Embiid.  Period.
We'll need Hero Mode Harden like the one who showed up when they beat Memphis 110-105.
It's crazy that Stephen A gets paid so much to be on a sports show, and literally doesn't know sports...
Giannis is MVP......  he will always be the best player everytime both teams step inside the court......
How does JJ have a vote and shaq Chuck Kenny don’t (only Ernie) it’s bad enough u have analyst who never played get it wrong but now I have a guy who averaged 12ppg never made a all star game n he has a vote yet a take like this if Giannis over Embid okay then
They always find a way to play Joel like a fiddle
Rondo has a great basketball mind
Joel gonna cry wee weee wee all the way home again!
It's wild how they all talked as if Jokic was not still in the race (and frankly it should be between he and Giannis). Too much reliance on anecdotes and individual games to argue their cases, need more numbers like JJ
Wise words from the 2 time NBA champion
Milwaukee has Jrue, Middleton,  Bobby, Lopez, Giannis aka MVP, Carter, Crowder, green, Ingles, Dragic, Matthews, Pat C, Grayson Allen and others . Milwaukee's bench is better then most starting 5 on teams in the playoffs.  Let's not forget about Thanasis and the engery he brings and the Ability to bring points rebounds and assists when needed. I love the Milwaukee bucks.. plus Milwaukee gets home court Advantage. #34 will have ring 2.. Joel better hope his team will pull it off.. what is the 76ers going to play Joel the whole 4 quarters. Bucks can sub in so many players for Giannis.  Can't wait to watch them win another ring
Milwaukee players have a championship pedigree that gives you more confidence for yall to punish Giannis cause he teammates stepped up Is crazy Giannis is the mvp
They keep underestimating the brooklyn nets S.A.S might be eating his words after a few games
Why do I get the biggest feeling that Rondo, in pretty ironic fashion, will go into coaching, someday?
Jokic clearly has weakest supporting cast.
Very good takes by everyone
Harden is top10 mvp candidates. Embiid has a lot of help. Their record without him is almost as good. Denver without Jokic is a LOSING TEAM. He is the best BY FAR in the advanced metrics
I am so happy to see Rondo. An NBA team needs to hire him as an assistant coach. Great IQ
I will NOT watch ESPN until Malika Andrews is removed! She is a toxic feminist predator.
So Embid is playing with a former MVP James Harden, and y’all saying Jokic and Gannis have better teams
Is embiid for one reason  leading scoring in nba   second consecutive  year average 33.3 deserve mvp
It’s been clear since day one that Rajon has a great mind for the game. Such a privilege to hear his analysis.
wait so their argument is that giannis has a better supporting cast than embiid?  then by that logic is Jokic by a mile, his supporting cast is by far the worst. zero all star teammates, 2nd best player spent the season restricted coming back from missing a year with injury.  like are they saying that aaron gordon is a better asset than james harden? kcp or mpj over maxey? like what????    of course sas and rondo arent known for being logical, but still, its a pathetic argument saying embiid over giannis because of worse supporting cast only if you ignore the other nuggets
giannis is the mvp. Without his mentality and mindset the bucks wouldnt even be playing this well to all be considered top players (brook possible dpoy, portis possible 6th man, and jrue all team nba). giannis push these guys to play better
Nuggets are 5-8 without Jokic  Philly is 11-5 without embid  Bucks are 11-8 without giannis  Thanks for making it crystal clear Stephen.
10:10 rondo look high ahhell
This was a good trio.
Nuggets only have jokic how is phila different because harden?? Bs
love when u have well spoken nba legends come in and give their take
Jokic only player with no all star
Philly has a better win percentage when Embiid is out, lol.
I quite enjoyed j j and rondo. I would love to see more of them together. They both know basketball so well.
And you have to give it to James harden, he’s adapted his game
Yeah. Embiid deserves this one. Jokic and Gianni both have 2 already. Ngl both are great but embiid deserves a lot, embiid improves and works very hard to get mvp and trying to get that ring.
Let's not forget how Steven disrespected Milwaukee before they won the championship..Steven is a joke
Watch out for JT AND JB WITH THE BOSTON CELTICS
Rondo is a fantastic analyst
The NBA had something against Milwaukee it's Is very obvious,  Giannis is the only one that grows and Is improves beyond measure every single season. Go back and watch Joel play He flops more than any of the three. He could win an Oscar for all the flopping he does.  Hands down Giannis is the best player in the NBA.. Giannis can play Center , PF, and other spots if needed. Milwaukee isn't a big city like Chicago, LA, even Philly. Now if Giannis was playing for the bigger cities..MVP would be his and Steven A and the rest would ride his nuts.. sports will talk about the Lakers over the #1 seed Milwaukee.  I can't wait to see Milwaukee win another championship.  Just like last time they counted Milwaukee out.. Joel will get Injured and be out 5-15 games..Giannis messed his knee up and was back by the next round.. Giannis #34 MVP all day
People don’t understand how many times harden had to go against gsw tho
Rondo always with the underrated genius swag.
Joel was hurt last year in the playoffs jj
RONDO
He won’t say what Denver would be without joker
Favorite player of all time rondo
I feel like rondo is more chill and gonna say wat he actually believes and jj kinda bias and more swayed to making a decision based on narrative
1:42, He’s also a better 3pt shooter, a better scorer, and a better short blocker- just look a the numbers
giannis has more help lmao
Stephen A., Bucks are 11-8 without Giannis, 76ers are 11-5 without Embiid, and Nuggets are 5-8 without Jokic. So, I think one of your arguments for Embiid is now invalid.
The Audacity of obesity whining nation is unbelievable. Quickly play the "race" card so Perks can "marinate" conversation further on national TV, and such scoring from FT it's admirable. Free Throws Attempted - 771/ 661 Embiid, Giannis 759/489, and  415/341 Jokic. Jokic 1-man army with 0-star players unless like those 2, and still some of those MVP candidates don't play at Jokic court for the past 4 years as always " injured before the game " :D. Western media has been biased for centuries but well done, activating the " race " card on the table :D
Jj sounds like a hater Gianniss over Embid is wild
I WOULD KILL TO GET MORE RONDO. WE NEED MORE RONDO DAMMIT.
Stephen A does everything in his power to discredit Giannis
Embiid hands down. Playing with Harden is a challenge in and of itself. Stat padding, no defense playing cancer Harden is.
So Stephen A if thats your reasoning . Why didnt Lebron win MVP every year from 2010-2020
I agree with Stephen A. The Sixers have a better shout at the Bucks more so than the Celtics.
Jj Reddick and rondo should be on a roster
Bro jj be switching on his podcasts he say jole but on here he pick the freak😭😭 every week it’s a different person
So if Stephen A. Smith is measuring MVP value by ‘which team is worse without their best player’…  The Bucks are 11-8 without Giannis   The 76ers are 11-5 without Embiid  The Nuggets are 5-8 without Jokic  This is not about basketball. Its about race just to push WOKEtake agendas
All great offensively only one is great on the defensive side and that's the Greek freak.
It's jokic
What ever jj smokin on I want it
Anthony Davis said these 3 bigs can have the nba mvp he goin for the fmvp💯💯💯
JJ tries way to hard to be a “good”analyst. Mmm idk, I’d rather watch Ernie.
I think the sixers supporting cast might be better than the nuggets tbh
Naaaa as a 76ers fan... I think we will really lucky ifwe face. Boston instead of. Milwaukee they are too strong. Regular season isnt the playoffs
Rondo is showing you how a point guard breaks the game down
Lol76ers out on 2nd round just like the few years past 😅
stephen a hate for the bucks and giannis blinds him... he is not objective, and its pathetic when he talk bout giannis or the bucks... philly have a better chace with the celtics
jokicless denver is worst team by far
So Stephen A based it on which team is the worst without their star? But that’s obviously Jokic…
Ngl this might be jj redick first time being completely wrong
Ngl this might be jj redick first time being completely wrong
People past 5 years two have won 2 and the other zero. They 2ay he's played and in the era nobody deserves 3 in a row. I mean Kobe only won 1. All the players in league have said Joel should win.
Stephen . A . Ima let you get the last word rondo but ima say some last second smith 10:11
I remember when he chose to sit against the joker
giannis lost it on this one, i dont disagree wth him but i just dont see why he had to say that and he already won 2 in a league with o many top talents
Embiid dominated ALL season. He will win it.
Having the best record in the NBA doesn't make you the MVP. Embiid has led the league in scoring two years straight! Think about that. He literally has to do almost everything for Philly to be successful while Giannis has a more complete team around him. This shouldn't even be a debate. Give Joel his trophy.
JJ ... of course, Embiid didn't play well during last year's playoffs. He got his face smashed in
This is the first time again i see a true sports analyst… i go to embid
Would love to see a Rondo, JJ, and RJ segment or show.
Rondo and Smith's argument about the supposed too good supporting cast is not very valuable to me, or you can ask Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Kareem and Magic to send back those MVP trophies or theirs.
And Austin reaves is EASILY the mvp this year
They’ve been trying to give Embiid mvp for like 5 years now lol
Stephen A will just not concede to Giannis being the best. He just won’t give him love.
Rajon. Ever heard of a haircut? And what’s up with the terrible ghote.
Philly has a higher win rate without embid then with him, and Middleton was injured for most of the year. Harden is literally a hall of famer
Stephen always wants trouble
Yes, Embiid 52 pts against Boston without their two of their starters! Also, the loss to the Heat a few days later. Remember that Stephen A.? Asking for a friend.
No one cares.
Rondo gonna be the next in the booth
Rondo looks like he got sentenced to community service!!
Embidd better win
I keep telling y'all JJ is SUPER SUSPECT lol... Kendrick is just the wrong guy to use cuz he's not smart enough
Saying embiid didn’t play good in playoffs last year when he had a broken face is as idiotic as jj gets which is a huge statement
3:17 - that's a weird position to take since the team's win %age is better when Joel didn't play.  Of course they're not the "same" team...but good enough to be 11-5 without their main guy.
Is this the first time the assist and points leader played together ?
Glad they got Chris Paul on the show!
When Philly lose in the 1st this gonna be the worst MVP to ever win in last 30 years
LeBron should have had the Laker keep Rondo as opposed to taking Westbrook on.  AD never played as well as with Rondo
Rondo Look Like He Just Found Jesus 😂😂😂
Of course, they disagree they’re Black , Biased, and racist  in their own style. They’re just not over the top racist so they can get away with it.  It’s the same story. Everything that doesn’t happen in the favor of the African-American it’s because you’re black and a white guy was involved.  I mean if that’s wrong why is there the harsh double standard that a black guy can say whatever you want about a white man but other way around and social media goes crazy and they want a white guy fired.  It seems only if your African-American does the idiomatic philosophy that two wrongs make a right come into play.
Joel this year
Rondo + JJ please remove Kendrick
Trash Analysis from Steven A. Talking about Giannis having brook, Potris, and Jrue like they're All NBA Max Contract players. Middleton was out the whole year and he still carried his team to the best record in the west.
Harden  is not the same player rondo so stop it …..and Stephen a I agree 100 percent that Sixers match up better against bucks then Celtics
Embiid was the best clutch player this year on both sides of the ball between the 3  JJ mentioned how Embiid’s production dropped last postseason but failed to mention how Embiid was playing through 2 injuries
Rondo looking like a shaolin monk
Joel should of won it the past two years and even Gianni’s deserves it by a little you gotta give it Joel embiid because the margin is so little …jokic is great but come on he isnt that great
JJ is CORRECT
We all know which team won less without their MVP candidate.
Bucks without Giannis vs 76ers without Embiid?
Coonin A. Smith. The 🤡
Rondo is very intelligent and his takes are good
This Embid MVP Was Forced On Us ! Smh
All international players
You’re on national tv and that’s the haircut you chose🤣
Doc river is Philly problem
why they looking past the nets crazy things have happened in the playoffs
Whyyyyyy its so big deal who is mvp? It´s not that big deal. Its matter of opinion mostly.
HE SCORED MORE. What kind of dumb argument is that saying "Embiid has more FTs."
I get what Stephen A is saying…but if that was the criteria Lebron and Jordan should’ve won it every year. Take Lebron off his teams, they don’t sniff the playoffs. Take Jordan off his teams, they don’t sniff the Finals.
Steven A on his best behavior with rondo and JJ he knows not to get out of pocket 🤡🤡🤡🤡
as long as lebron is playing. he will always be tha mvp
I don’t like jj reddick at all…. Him n Perkins are the worst on ESPN
Embiid all day Philly stand up we use to the snubs and hate
Jokic is on my fantasy and he’s the most reliable CONSISTENT player in NBA history IMO.
Embiid literally plays with the best playmaker in the league too and probably top 3 passer with cp and lbj
Give the mvp to embiid, tell me a 7ft center who plays like a guard and in transition does a pull up 3 🤯
Philly has a better record without Embiid than the bucks or Nuggets have without their best player
MVP doesn’t have to be the best player, just the most important piece to a team.
So because Joel is mostly carrying an otherwise play-in team on a top heavy Eastern conference, he's better than Giannis putting similarly historical numbers on a better constructed team?! LOL
why yall do jj like dat lol
Giannis is clearly the best player in the NBA and has been since Lebron has taken a step back. Joel is runner up but is deserving of MVP since the 76er's are a lottery team without him. Tyrese Maxey is a great number 2 but outside of that it's a bunch of scrubs and 3 overpaid veterans who belong on the bench at best.
Im a 76ers fan… And honestly, I don’t think we’ll win a Championship because of “The Process” mentality… you don’t lose to win. Mentally, I don’t think we’re tough enough to run through a Milwaukee. The talent is there, but mentally, we’re flawed. You just don’t fix that
Last 5 years hes delusional if he thinks 2018 was his
Anytime SAS says mhm mhm over and over you know he stopped listening and is already to rebuttals
The Jocker is averaging a triple doubel what are we talking about lol
I hope to see Cj McCollum back on firsttake it's good to see players talk abt basketball I feel like I'm learning something
Sucks for Philly there going out in the second round again THEYVE had 0 luck
RONDO!!!!!
why do I always get the feeling that JJ condescends to beeing on Ft
Rondooooo
Having JJ and Rajon on the show actually kept Stephen A kind of quiet and tame
J.J. Redick has forgotten that you don't side with anyone outside Philly! Comments about someone else for MVP other than Joel will affect his popularity in Philadelphia!!  he should keep his mouth shut!!
RONDOOOOOOOO
Rondo come to Milwaukee we can put a ring on it 😎
The MVP is whichever player you're picking to win you a finals game 7. You can't tell me most of these analysts wouldn't pick Giannis.
JJ Redick’s point reminds me of the Miguel Cabrera and Mike Trout MVP robbery in the MLB 😅
JJ putting his friendship with embid aside and voting without being bias💯💯💪🏽
JJ really said he's voting for the best player on the best team yesterday.
If Giannis had the league leader in assists on his team Stephen A would use it against him.
I can see rondo being a coach in the future
yooooooooooooooooooooo
The more I see who can vote for MVP the less it means to me
Rondo is literally the FIRST and ONLY person would say a teak with NO OTHER ALL STARS is better than one with two All NBA dudes....
Denver is full and healthy. Honestly I expect them to reach finals in ez mode and probably win it... They gonna get it this year I just feel it!
also i know im ugly but rondo reminds me of that alien  from American dad forgot his name
Nets in 6
Stephen A says dumber shi every time I see him talk. How tf the sixers can’t beat Boston but they’ll have a chance against the only team better than Boston😂
First MVP of Giannis was a steal from Harden, come on now, the MVP is about narratives and that is all.
i swear rondo seems like a good active listener
So the one with the biggest bag pack should be MVP
So we gonna give MVP to someone who's a question mark during the playoffs? Over the dude that turns up in the playoffs n average more points and rebs and mins a game!!!!!!! Giannis all day bruh
JJ Redick stinks and Joel Should win it
As a sixer fan I agree we're not beating Boston unfortunately
Philly was 11-5 without Embiid and Stephen A. is just gonna say that Giannis is not MVP because MKE was 11-8 without Giannis? That’s garbage
Replace SAS with Rondo. Need some REAL analysis.
Jj Joel single handle helped u have ur two best shooting seasons when u played in Philly and now ur saying he's not the mvp crazy
Jokic. Less talent. 1st in the west. Highest win share. 2nd in assist. He helps/assists others, others don't help/assists him. That's it.
SAS saying Embiid always answers the calls agaisnt Giannis. Did we forget his 0 point game agaisnt him?? Lmao
My sentiments align with Rondo. James Harden has done a great job being a facilitator to Joel Embiid, but for them to win a championship, he needs to be a threat...and Tyrese Maxey will have to step up when (if) these guys struggle to get it going.
AT 0:16, JJ Redick just swore on national TV, using the F-bomb.
😂so now greak freak didn’t play by his self
Joel Embiid is the NBA MVP of the regular season
So we rlly gonna ignore the fact that Giannis carried the buck while missing Middleton for majority of the season🤔 that’s crazy cus that’s the same narrative that won Jokic his MVPs and Giannis still brought his team to the best record in the whole NBA🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
JJ Reddick & Rondo >>>> first take...they need their own show💪🏿🤓
Steven A. talks more empty talk while JJ and Rondo talk BASKETBALL.. Steven A. less talky talky, more listen to the people who know basketbal..
Joel Embid will win mvp.. i'd take that every day if Joker win championchip
MVP is the best player in the whole league.
Giannis mvp!!!!
Hey JJ, Joel was playing with a fractured face last playoffs
Can yall invite Pop star Dj khlad back to give his expert nba analysis and predictions 😂😂😂
Personally I still have Jokic. I get how great Embiid is. But I mean c'mon for like 80% of the season Jokic was the MVP. everybody could agree on it. And then all of a sudden when he misses a little bit of time and numbers goes down from All-NBA first to second team numbers he just gets ruled out. I don't know that doesn't sit right with me. I still got Jokic
They picked everyone but the MVP lmao
This is the I feel bad for him award that Embiid bout to get.
Giannis is 100% correct he has been the MVP for 5 straight seasons. Joel deserves it though he’s had a great season 💯
You'd think that having played so much with Joel, JJ would cut him some slack. He wasn't "great" (24 & 11 🤷‍♂) in the playoffs last year cause he had his face broken and played the second round with a mask on. Does he have to be better? Absolutely 100%. But let's not act like his numbers dipped because of something within his control
Stephen a literally makes sht up to hate on Giannis because no one agrees with him that KD is the best in the NBA
This narrative about Milwaukee being so great without giannis is weird. Since when? Embiid literally has harden Milwaukee has Noone like Harden.
Just get stephen A off the show and give the reigns to guys like JJ and Rondo. They clearly understand the game a lot better, they clearly understand the stats and the player prospective vs a guy just trying his best to stay relevent by creating drama and trying his best to make headlines.
Rondooooo
Wait… Steph not there?
Embiid is the MVP
Rondo remains the most intelligent person in the room just like he was when he was on the court.
Playoff rondonumba9 looks like souljaboy tellem
Stephen A Smith’s argument is exactly why Jokic should win 😂😂 the Nuggets have a losing record without Jokic and the 76’ers still have a winning record without Embiid.
Honestly just seems like guys vote for Giannis because the's their favorite player. It's Embiid or Jokic. This is crazy.
Rondo never been primary scorer?! What?! He dropped 40 in playoff game jj lol
Why they have to put JJ stats up lmaooo
I keep forgetting my Lakers last championship had Rajon Rondo hands all over it, salute To Rondo.
I don't know 1.Embid , 2.Giannis or 1.Giannis , 2.Embid seems so hard to choose.
Embiid won back to back scoring titles. Come on now
SERIOUS QUESTION    Did Tatum not technically lead the league in scoring?   He has the most points, period. He didn’t have highest AVERAGE, but he LEADS in POINTS 😐.   How is this sh*t voted on really?
Bucks actually lost more without Giannis than Phili did without embiid 🤷‍♂️
I think he fought Embiid in practice, this has to be personal JJ??
I can't listen to Elvis take it how u wanna 😅
If the the nets upset the 76ers………
Imagine saying embiid has no good teammates. The second option is James harden. Also I don't think its possible for Giannis to do something better to win mvp, he had a monster season played without Middleton at the begining of the season and has the best record in NBA.
What would the team be without him applies to Embid and Jokic. Denver would have a tanking record without even trying haha
Rondo is not a good pundit 😂😂
My guy Rajon Rondo on here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑🏆🏆
I don't get how any one can say Joel doesn't have help. A former mvp on his squad.
Is Joel Embiid playing BETTER than Patrick Ewing's entire career ⁉️
ESPN think they slick having CP3 on🙃and showing JJ stats on screen while he's debating whose this season MVP.😁
Joel beat these guys head up
Rondo has chips. Stephen A. has None.
Just give it Joel n get it out the way.
they're trying super hard to stop the 3peat lmao
I hate JJ.
Brk jokic is the mvp and it truly isn’t close
It’s really Jokic.   Jokic is sets up offense, best rebounder on , best scorer on team and didn’t have consistently second fiddle star all year. Jokic best team in west   Harden average 21 and 10 . Who does Jokic have like that ?
Bro… These guys really need to start watching Jimmy highroller videos; Jokić is the MVP and it’s not even close.
How is JJ talking about Embiid had a narrative? That was all Jokic. Dude is 1 dimensional and yet he’s won over Embiid and Gianni’s twice. JJ is a snake
I love this JJ and Rondo combo
Giannis is 7 foot 8 where is the skill at ? Foh
Love it how Tatum isn’t even talked about he has the most points in the entire season and Celtics are 2 place this year wth
JJ dropping F bomb forgot he wasn’t on his podcast lol
Bring Rondo back the show needs him
Embid or joker fck Giannis
Place your money on sixers Lakers NBA finals Im telling you it's gonna happen
Absolutely BS take from Stephen A. If we’re going by his logic, Bron never shouldve won MVP in Miami, Steph shouldve never won MVP in GSW, Harden should’ve never won MVP in Houston. It’s not their fault that they have good teams. And certainly not Giannis’ fault if he has a better team.
Rondo is highly intelligent
Jj reddick one of the media members with some actual sense
fw rondo and all but did he just say jokic had a better team than embiid?
I have to agree with JJ; it's Giannis for me.
Rondo need to be a fixture. Basketball IQ 📈
Jokic is still the MVP of the league.  Yiannis and/or Joel Embid cannot pass the ball like the Joker... it's that simple.  Joel has game, but Yiannis is still more athletic/mobile... but he can't shoot free throws to save his life.  Joel needs to win in the playoffs to distinguish himself and he would need to beat the Bucks or the Celtics to be the MVP.  The real MVP award shouldn't be given until the playoffs are over.  The real MVP is who can win it all !!!!!!
Embiid bout to cry in the tunnel again 😂
Haven’t even watched yet but I bet Rondo is great on here, one of the most intelligent players of all time.
Hold up Rondo. So was Middleton on this bucks team for 70 games? Harden/Maxey/Harris is a lot better than Jrue/Lopez. Also Jamal/MPJ/Gordon. Philly has the best team surrounding any one of the three and it’s not all that close.
Embiid got Harden and they have the nerve to say he has a worse squad than Jokic???
I can’t believe Mitchell isn’t being talked about like he didn’t break records and help give this cavaliers team a huge jump this season
Jj got killed in this
Giannis lucky he plays in this defenseless era tho can’t forget that  U can literally do whatever u want now
Let's see first JJ was hyping up Joker and after the big Perkins bombshell he changed his tune to Giannis. 😒🤔🤦🏾‍♂️. He clearly has something against Embiid
Lol now rondo is an analyst, wonder who’s next
GIANNIS!! I love JJ for derailing the Embiid narrative.
Middleton didnt even play well
The fact we acting like Maxey isn't hooping consistent scoring 40 and a few 30s and consistent 20s and then having harden averaging like 22/7/11 a game the disrespect to them is crazy
Are we gonna act like Embiid doesn’t have harden, maxey, and Tobias Harris
“Joel didn’t play well in the playoffs last year” JJ, he had a broken orbital bone AND torn thumb ligament….
Most tamed First Take! JJ and Rondo are great!  Keep Mad Dog away from the Miami games! I feel personally attacked 😅
How does Reddick get a vote lmao dude was average player and a trash analyst
Giannis got best supporting cast? When did this happen? I guess having multiple #1 options (Super Team) doesn't count as supporting cast huh
Dam shyt has changed now the media is telling us who they voted for. Players begging to be mvp. Magic and bird never begged to be mvp or Jordan and Barkley.
If you have not played basketball at a high-level you should not be on the show is that very simple
Joel Emiid is not the MVP this year
Giannis the the MVP imo, him being consistently great shouldn’t be held against him
Philly don’t have enough depth to beat Milwaukee or Boston
It’s funny that the knock on Giannis is that he is a great leader that great players want to play with
Considering how much Rondo's basketball IQ is apparently respected by everyone that has played with or against him, I hope JJ gets him on the pod to breakdown all the matchups.
JJ a snake
i think the mvp should be who you think is the best player in the nba , because realistically if you're the best player in the nba you are the most valuable player .to me giannis is the best player in the nba . for example if you had the 1st pick right now for 1 season whoever you pick 1st would be you're mvp and i dont think alot of people would even pick embiid 1st
Embiid averages two more points over Giannis as the third seed. Giannis clears Joel in rebounds, assists and field goal percentage. Most importantly, his team has the best overall record in both conferences. How’s this even a debate 😑 giannis deserves to win
LETS GOOOOO AS A CELTICS FAN IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS I rlly rlly wanted him as the Celtics assistant head coach but I LOVE THIS KEEP IT UP RAJON
Embid has had the better team his whole career
Hey JJ FCK YOU! Your trying to divide the vote with your bias non statistical opinion. Now its semantics and we shouldn’t respect the stats Hunh???
JJ reddick is a hater. He was for Jokic and now hes for giannis. Seems to me like hes doing everything in his power not to vote for Joel
I see Rondo, I click. Simple as that 🐐
Tatum is MVP
Stephen A is the typical fan. If the sixers lose they will blame harden even tho embiid shrinks in the playoffs
FOR STEPHEN A TO TRY TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THE BUCKS ARE GOOD WITHOUT GIANNIS IS IDIOTIC AND WHY HE SHOULD BE A MODERATOR ONLY
Embid all day. Saw that man play in person. Dropped 40 in 3 quarters. Went to the locker room 4th quarter
Reddick "Harden helped to ELEVATE Joel". MVPs don't GET elevated...they do the ELEVATING.
I don't pick players based on stats, when your team is doing great without you and your team is stacked
Everything Stephen A said about Joel could be said about the other two.
They let this child abuser on ESPN
Who invited Chris Paul😂?
Embiid is a cry baby if things don’t go his way…
I skipped Stephen A to hear jj and rondo
It’s literally all about it being embiids turn for Stephen A lol
Stephen A: Embiid is the MVP because the Bucks are much better than the 76ers Also Stephen A: 76ers will beat Bucks
Did JJ get away with saying fucc
JJ Reddick says he doesn't pick the best player on the best team and that's what he did after explaining why he chose Giannis for his MVP lol
Embiid is the MVP this season.
JJ didn't vote for his former teammate?
Embiid and Giannis are ELITE defensive players PERIOD! And they should really be the only two in the conversation. Jokic didn’t deserve MVP last year!! Jokic is blatantly TRASH on the defensive end of the ball it’s ridiculous I can’t think of an MVP that neglects their defensive responsibilities like he does
Most Valuable Player meaning you are the the focal point in order to win .  Giannis and Joker team can still be formidable and maybe play-in / playoff team  without them   Embidd had to be phenomenal when he is there . If they lose Embidd, they probably a Lottery team
My fav basketball player of all time rondo🐐
Rhondo looking 👀 like Pokie from New Jack City 😂😂😂😂
Stephen A just doesnt like the bucks...so he's biased of course
If Giannis is getting the “LeBron treatment” that speaks volumes more to his greatness than any MVP.
I got love for rondo ... But ESPN ... Y'all are the biggest hypocrites ever 😂😂😂 ... How tf do u fire Paul Pierce for smokin with strippers ... But  y'all got rondo on here and he put a gun to his kids mother's head allegedly 😂 ... That's crazy
Joel ain’t did nothing he gon flop inna playoffs again with harden again a former mvp
If doing more with less is the criteria for the MVP award than we owe Bron at least 10 more MVPS. I love how they move the criteria each year to fit in with what the narrative they’re publishing.
Why do all the RIM protectives deserve MVPs
Take the mvp voting out of the media’s hands. Let the players decide.
sixers have a better win percentage when Embiid doesn't play they score more points get more rebounds and have more assist
6ixer would be still top 6 because of James harden
Love seeing Rondo on this panel. Him x JJ is basketball intelligence to the max
Giannis is the best player on the best team, end of discussion
SA in the background "mhmm"
Really I think Philly has a better team then the bucks
The MVP is jokic but give it to embid if u don't want people to cry. Harden led the league in assist so how embid MVP. Jokic nobody thought Denver the #1 seed injury team low  payroll. Without jokic Denver would probably be the worst team in the west or maybe just better than Houston San Antonio
😊😅😅
As much as good has Harden been complementing Embid, I can say that JJ has been very well complementing Stephen A as well.
Take every superstar away and that team makes the playoffs except for the Sixers. Joel Embiid is the most valuable on that team.
If it came down to numbers i think we could just put everyones stats into a formula and have a computer pick mvp
Yes Embiid held it down while Harden was out but Middleton was out too for many many games, Ingles was out too and Giannis held it down also.
This is a useless award!  Giannis is the best all around player in the NBA.  If they want to reward a specific player or his accomplish for supporting his team during the regular season then the award should be called "Regular Season MVP".  Just like we have an AllStar game MVP, Finals MVP.... NBA MVP clearly should be done in and to me has no true meaning.  The ultimate goal is to win the Finals.  Word of advice NBA players, concentrate on winning the Finals MVP, that is the true depiction of being the best in the world i.e.. the best in the NBA... MJ has 6 of them!!
Fire screaming A.  He’s a clown, baccine pusher
Rondo and JJ what a dynamic duo for tv geez such good takes 🔥🔥🔥
I completely agree with jj reddick. It’s just narratives “it’s Joel’s turn” so give it to him. Gianni’s stats to me are better and you can’t take credit away from Gianni’s if 3 other players on his team are having career years. That’s a testament to Gianni’s elevating others around him. But all 3 deff deserved it. But if you hear these takes you can’t help but to see the narratives swaying it towards embiid it’s almost like a pity he didn’t get it during the last 2 years so time is running out let’s get his empty trophy case with a trophy
Perk got JJ being "very" specific 😂
Going off Stephen A's argument, Jokic is the MVP because without Jokic the Nuggets are fighting to be in the play-in. Stop the nonsense we all know Jokic should be a 3x MVP but voting fatigue won't let it happen
Its pathetic that embiid will win based off the media. It should be Jokic considering he has the least amount of help and is the #1 seed. Giannis would be #2
Embiid MVP
All three players are deserving. I'm just happy that international players are dominating the NBA.
JJ is the most unbiased sports commentator. He keeps it real. His objective commentary is making me watch First Take.
Rondo beats women
Embiid has to be MVP
Great show !
The thing is Giannis completes his teammates jrue Brook and the defense is Soo good because of Giannis without him the team is completely different
Harden never plays he wrong for that
Giannis has no talent whatsoever if he is stop from getting dunks or layups he is useless
How is Giannis the Most Valuable player when his team is still very good and can win without him? Nuggets aren’t winning without Jokic and Philly would win significantly less, Jru scored 50 in the same game he did… Bobby Portis is averaging a double double off the bench, brook lopez plays his role to perfection.. I’m no hater but if you want to just award the best player then the name of the award should be changed and a lot of debates would no longer happen. Most valuable and the best don’t always go hand and hand.
Philly would be better than the nuggets without embiid and no jokic.  Jokic literally is the value add for the team. He has no other all stars or all nba players.   With all that said, Giannis is my MVP.
Rondooooooooooooooooo
If we look at the numbers and the real numbers Jokic far ahead of both of them and that's not even close.
isnt tatum leading the league in scoring?
All 3 are close. Incredible stats in their own way.  The Bucks having the best record of the season is the tie breaker. Giannis for mvp. I feel embiid might get it because people feel sorry for him not having won 1 yet.
Ronda, one of my all-time favorite bad boys on the court!!
Philly has a better record without Embiid (11-5) than the Bucks do without Giannis (11-8). I really don’t think Steven A does any research.
Keep sleeping on Knicks
The should just have finals MVP who cares about regular season
they only wanna give it to embiid cuz he doesn’t have one😂😂it’s dumb how they do they votes giannis makes his team the best team if embiid was on the bucks they wouldn’t be as good if u out giannis in philly they’d be better it’s that simple
Idkw but reddick seems like a whack person
Love all 3 of the players. But embiid narrative seems like sympathy now and that’s not a good enough narrative for a great player. Just say his team is weaker.   But then the argument on Gianni’s team being better makes no sense when Jordan won his mvps he had pippen and co next to him.   Great players who are contenders usually have good to great teams.
the nba and media wants joel win the mvp so bad lol
Love Rondo a True General 🎉 he knows Ball please redick and rondo Not breath Perkins
Embiid had Harden the assist leader… he was out, Middleton missed 40+ teams, Holiday missed 20 games, the notion that Embiid has no help is so stupid, Sixers were 11-6 without Embiid, Bucks were 11-7 without Giannis
I get what JJ’s saying. I believe Joel Embids going to win it. But for all the wrong reasons. Like….. he doesn’t even have 1. Why give it to someone with multiple. Him not having 1 being the tie breaker. Because Giannis and Jokic played better.
Umm, come on JJ, Joel averaged only 23 and had a subpar round against the Heat last year because he'd had his face broken in the final game against Toronto and was wearing a mask and couldn't see very well. He also torn a thumb ligament in the same series, so his touch was off. He only missed 1-2 games, while most players would have missed two weeks.
I’m tired of SAS saying “the 76ers can beat the bucks” Waiting to see it
MvP voting is a joke. The voting media will not give a player an MvP based on his regular season performance and now ask if this player deserves to have as many or more Mvps than former  greats. For example Jokic and Giannis have 2 MvPs, while players like Bird, Magic, Jordan, and Lebron have 3+. The media asks if Jokic and Giannis deserve to have as many MvPs as those guys and are on their level. And since they don't believe they're as great at Bird, Magic, Jordan, Lebron they won't win another MvP. It's that simple. So instead of Giving Jokic/Giannis a 3rd Mvp they'll give it to Embid. next season they'll ask if Embid deserves to have 2 Mvps and is on the level of Jokic/Giannis and they'll say no bec he can't pass the ball like them and isn't efficient even if his reg season stats are other worldly. So they'll give it to someone else.
JJ a hater I’m sorry Joel should’ve won both last year and he better win this year
I hate when people say Joel is mvp because his team is worse and they are not the same when he is not on the floor but look at when jokic was out they were a lottery team without him soo that argument to me is not a good one
Philly had a better win percentage without Embiid than with Embiid.
Well all I have to say is if Jokic isn’t on the Nuggets they smokin hookah with Luka rn
JJ said “i dont vote based best player on best team” but then says “Giannis has best win percentage among the 3, so i picked Giannis” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Even though Embiid is my MVP, his team was 11-5 without him compared to Giannis's 11-8 and Jokic's 5-8 and he had worst win record out the three. So the argument that SAS and RR used falls flat.
if giannis and or embiid had the season that joker had they will MVP right so joker shoud win MVP just because he did it for 2 years everyone came accustomed to what hes doin that means he shouldnt win MVP
Theres alot of bias to the MVP voting interms of the Media and Narratives
just cancel already jokic thats what u all trying  long time  give black man mvp since u are all racist but acting like everyone else is but not u  nba is corrupted anyways
The MVP candidate is officially rigged
Something wrong with JJ this is simple Emiid winning this by a LANDSLIDE!!! Wont even be close emiid 2023 NBA MVP Guaranteed!!!!
WGAF! Disagreement fine and is a good thing. Just keep race out of it and it’s all good in my eyes. All three could be winner.
Does Stephen a Smith have a vote? I'm just wondering how jj got one before him. Maybe the voters aren't racist but they are all white🤔
They got Giannis fucked up.. Greek is definitely the Mvp this season and can possibly win the east. Philly not getting out the east
Ofcourse they are. They got Perkins back…
Rondo’s assists highlights are 🔥
philly r second round exits
Rondo is way smarter than Beverly lol. Beverly was more entertaining though. Depends what espn values
Rondo been gone long enough to grow some gang time on dreads. Wild.
Rondo need his own podcast or a consistent appearance on shows. My favorite PG🖤
bucks and 76ers have winning records without those 2. denver has a losing record without jokic. what?
rondo has a very high basketball IQ, very smart guy
Man ESPN needs to hire Rondo asap
Philly won more without Embiid than with him. SAS does zero research.
Yezzir. Y’all brought in the basketball savant, Rajon Rondo
obviously giannis won more games when he played because his team has the best roster in the nba from top to bottom. Foolish statement
Didnt he shove a gun in his baby mom's face?
I usually don't watch these but this is interesting and understandable
Sas is speaking opinion what world did brook Lopez had career year not??portis had career year in 2020-21 and last year not this year. Brook did in 2010-11 and 2014-15. Same for 15-17 season
He begging for the mvp it don’t count
“Giannis can’t shoot”. Ok then stop him… you can’t
The embiid hate is crazy lol jj a goofy he ain’t coming back here no time soon. Joel had a broken face last year playoff
Gotta love Reddick and Rondo in the convo
Joel had his face smashed in the playoffs last year JJ
Lol wonder what all the embid voters gone say after the 76ers get eliminated 1st round
I disagree with all of there assessment on how an MVP is picked it doesn't matter what do you wanna win a team or losing team you could be MVP based on how you play and response it's unfair to punish a good player on the winning team because his team is winning and he can't be MVP the reason why his team is winning maybe because he's MVP
ESPN funny asl for putting JJ stats up as he’s speaking
Jokic team has a negative record with out him that’s cap
Tatum is now officially top five. Debatable 3rd/4th option for MVP. He scored the most points this year. The slump after allstar break hurt him.
Giannis should and is the MVP.
People are voting for embiid to make up for last year this is so dumb to me
JJ continues to irk me lately.  To think, I used to like the guy.  But after leaving the Sixers for no reason and his bulshit interview with Ben Simmons, I don't look at him the same.
Voting because you think its someone's turn is so daft and nonsensical
keep rajon
2018 is a stretch he was not getting that over Harden who won it and LeBron was the best all around player that season
All foreigners, I love it
Only clicked because rondo was on. Make him a part of a show on ESPN.
I would argue 76ers are still a playoff team without Embiid
Jokic
Embiid wont get all those soft free throw fouls in the playoffs, watch him get frustrated and bomb out in the first round. . And cry again 😂
Where is Kendrick Perkins to race bait the conversation? 😂😂😂
Giannis as a leader has brought his guys up closer to his level over the years!
I can dig it.
Career years because of who? All goes back to their leader. Giannis makes them better. Simple. Most valuable isn't what your team does without you. What do they do when you're on the floor? JJ said it. The win percentage is the best.
The Greek freak is definitely the mvp
so glad jj has a vote in these awards
when Stephen A disagrees with you, you know you’re right.
I don’t like bringing up the record without Giannis because I just think it doesn’t matter in his case.  I also think they got really lucky to win without Giannis for those games. Their are certain circumstances where records without a player matter like if you watch the Nuggets without Jokic the record is very bad because they depend on him to facilitate the ball. Jokic is the one passing the ball and finding teammates in tough situations and he’s also a major mismatch in the post and shooting. The only other player like that on the nuggets is Jammal Murray.  I see what Embiid is doing it is very impressive for sure he’s really fun to watch. I just think that Giannis and Jokic matter more to their teams. So to me it’s Jokic or Giannis, but I’m good with anyone winning it.
RONDOOOOOOOOO
Giannis for MVP Sixers and Nuggets ain’t getting passed the 2nd round for the next decade or two
Himbiid 💪🏾
When embiid and harden were both out at the same time the sixers were still smoking teams with Harris maxey and the rest of the team
I dont think that 76ers can beat either Celtics or Bucks 76ers dont have good enough perimeter defense to take the celtics and the bucks have 2 DPOY calliber players as big men for embiid
MVP. From a teams' winning % perspective? The award should go to a player, that a high win % team can't be one without. The Hub.
Best record combined with most dominated combined with already a champion mvp and dpoy..they are getting tired of Giannis just like they got tired of Lebron giving him all the trophies.
Steven A , JJ or rondo never won a MVP so how they got the credentials to say who should win 🤨…. By jus watching the game ???
love seeing rondo on here man, legendary basketball mind
Idk Rondo boring on TV. He was more entertaining on the court. 😂
Did JJ drop the F bomb at Molly at the start of the video???
In order to beat the Celtics u can't play them 1 on 1. They are too good defensively. That ball has to move side to side. This is what the warriors did last year. So Embiid and Giannis can't play too selfish
Discounting the sixers roster is pathetic.  Does giannis have a former MVP on his team?   Giannis literally made these guys that were either struggling or near the end of their careers and boosted them.  Lopez dpoy season in the twilight of his career and arguable all star, Jrue back to an all star after 10 years,  portis maligned player with bad chemistry issues before the bucks now a sixth man.     If anything their resurgence could be attributed to how valuable giannis is.
Which player has the most points these season imm gonna leave this year
Its funny how they don't mention anything about the case for Jokic being the mvp, if they did they would have to admit he should win it.
Stephen A. 💯💯💯 thank you! I'm in my 40s..grew up on 80s and 90s nba. this how it's supposed to go, jj opinions is correct also, but the way SA and Rondo put it yes, bucks and nuggets got better players without joking and Giannis, philly, we weak without embiid, he is literally our most valuable player and amongst all the top teams, 50+ wins, yeah he the MVP!
Jj isn’t a sellout and that’s why I love him he doesn’t need ESPN cause they are a bunch of sellouts
I don't even see the point of this debate. We all know Jokic is going to win MVP again and lose in the first round of the playoffs. lmao
EMBIID wins.
Espn petty for showing JJ’s stats when he’s talking about the MVP race lol 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
I agree with JJ’s thought process.
None of these players were as good as they are playing next to Gianni’s and Gianni’s doesn’t get credit for making his teammates better I find that so funny lmao
Giannis is the MVP cut the nonsense embid miss enough games
Of course they trying to push the narrative for Embiid lol. Homeboy ducked a game against Giannis and got outplayed in another. It’s very clear the vote between Giannis and Jokic, which I think Giannis is the MVP. Embiid is so overrated it’s starting to get cringe
Lol Giannis gets penalized for having Jrue, Portis and Brook. But let’s ignore Harden, Harris and Maxey. Can’t stand this mvp narratives
I hope he becomes a coach one day. Been saying that for years. Guys basketball iq is off the charts
Bucks were winning games without Giannis on that win streak. Sorry
Rondo must still think he got 24secs to make his point 🤔😂
Joel Embiid should be the MVP but he’s not going to get it. If writers will not give it to Jokic then Giannis will get it. There appears to be a bias against Embiid that’s undeserving. He gave all he got this season and it still won’t be enough because of the negative atmosphere writers carry. JJ Reddick is a perfect example of the bias because he tries to intelligently discount Embiid.
From JJ Reddick criteria,  Jokic should have not won last year. He won less games than any other finalists
One of the best first take clips. Only because they are talking at a reasonable tone and nobody is interrupting one another
The 76er's might not get pass the Nets, let along the Leprechauns and Bucks.. I don't trust the 76er's or their process
Joel Embiid less 76ers 9-5 (removed last 2 wins because seed was locked) Giannis less Bucks: 9-6 (removed last 2 losses cause seed was locked) They need to stop that narrative Joel's team is so much worse without him and Giannis has a near perfect team.  All 3 deserve it but that argument is just wrong.
Shut Stephen A. 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
The only reason I clicked on this was for JJ Redick.
Love rondo
sas comment about everything revolving around embid, thing is, that's an argument for the nuggets as well. you want to see a team fall apart? put jokic on the bench, then think about things revolving around one player. in a tight race, there needs to make a clear definition of mvp. mvp as an individual? scoring? assists? rebounds? shooting percent? combined? or mvp as in bringing the rest of the team up with him? that's where folks are waffling back and forth, too much interpretation, needs to be better defined. because what one lacks, the other has and vice versa.
It seems like Giannis will get some of the vote from Embiid which will make Jokic win
My problem is that ppl act like Brook and Jrue having a career year can't be because of Giannis and how he leads and allows them to be the best versions of them. But will give Jokic credit for MPJ and Murray having career years smh.
Of course they voted for Embid instead of Joker
Is Rondo still abusing his children? ESPN puts anyone on the air.
Unfortunately, Embiid came in the league while the Freak is playing at another level, this playoffs we will see.
Stephen A and Rondo are so wrong: Bucks without Giannis = 11 wins - 8 losses Denver without Jokic = 5 wins - 8 losses Sixers without Embiid = 11 wins -5 losses  So, who's team cannot play without their best player? Who is the most valuable to his team?
Stop saying GIANNIS IS SHOOTING!!! He just SCORES!!! He doesn’t shoot he ball 🤣 Embiid does what Giannis doe’s offensively on shooting outside 5ft from the basket.
SAS not giving Giannis the flower because Jrue, Portis, Brook all stepped up this year in absense of Middleton and saying that Bucks are a better team even without Giannis is just a lazy excuse. MVP is MOST VALUEABLE PLAYER, this means on and off the court what that MVP brings to the table for the team. Without Giannis, no one would play as tough as the Bucks have been. GIANNIS IMPOSED HIS WILL IN THE FINALS AGAINST THE SUNS. HES THE ONE THAT MOTIVATES THE ENTIRE TEAM, EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWS THAT NOT MVP?
Stephen's point gets dismantled by the fact that 76ers were 11-5 without him, while Denver was 5-8 without Jokic and Bucks were 11-8 without Giannis.
What would Philly be without embiid? You could ask that if the nuggets too if that’s your argument. He definitely had the most inconsistent group of all 3 but somehow he isn’t even mentioned really
5:04 So we just gonna ignore that text at the top of the screen??? Who has the bigger impact AD or Andrew Wiggins😂😂😂😂
How did rondo just start looking old outta nowhere 🤣🤣🤣
Win percentage !? It’s mvp not mvt! Get reddick outta here ! If you have eyes and a brain it’s embiid mvp and it should be unanimous
embiid literally has another top 10 mvp candidate in his own squad but yeah sure giannis and jokic have better teams 😂🤡🤦🏻‍♂️. The "deserves it this year" narrative is also a joke but we move..
They bucks are the best team
Stephen A is correct about 6ers squeezing in that win even though Embiid balled out. JB didn't even play.
It is unfair for you 3 to talk about Jokic only for 30 seconds in a 10 minute segment. He is almost averaging triple double and #1 in the west. Jokic is the MVP.
Giannis has a sniper in Middleton a shutdown defender in holiday a versatile big man in Lopez and a loaded bench embiid got a washed up harden and a horrible coach this is a joke that embiid not unanimous
Rondo the real 🐐🐐🐐🐐
It is simple. Best player on the best team..
Did I hear JJ drop the “F bomb”? 😮😅
Tatum
Embiid literally carrying a entire team while playing under the pressure in Philly , Giannis on a loaded team in little tiny Milwaukee and the other guy don’t even deserve to be mentioned
i finally agree with jj THE MVP IS GIANNIS
Jokic didn’t even have another all star player, but Embiid has the worst team of the three? Crazy
How do you mention Embiid carrying his team but not Jokic? Lol
I just saw a video on my recommended saying where is Rajon Rondo lol I guess I know now
JJ makes Kendrick Perkins point every time he speaks🎯
James harden gotta average 25 ppg Joel can only average 30 ppg
SAS stupidity knows no bounds. By his idiotic logic, the MVP should go to Doncic or Shai. Can you imagine how much even WORSE those two teams would be and have been when they’re out? 🥴
bro i love rondo
Yall worship JJ like he says nothing wrong yall gotta stop 🍆 🚴 for a few and understand his points vs RR and steve is not strong this segment HARDEN NEEDS TO SCORE IN THE PLAYOFFS
Joker all day
Rondo lost me a lil , the nuggets don’t have a better team than Philly if I’m being honest
Nets in 6
JJ acquired voting privileges pretty quickly.
Of course Stephan a smith is going with embiid over jokic….
Boston is the 2023 champion and jason Tatum is the 2023 FMVP
So James harden a scrub na?😭
*Kawhi* *Bean* *Jordan* I love hearing all the praises towards Kevin BLEEPING Durant as if Kawhi Anthony Leonard is chop liver. So if people think Suns in 4 or 5, Kawhi will just roll over and die because he doesn't have Paul George?   Any series with Kawhi, I'm giving my Clippers' a puncher's chance against ANY team. Kawhi is the closest thing to MJ. Big hands. Efficient. Mastery of the midrange. Same turnaround fadeaway.  Back in the day, Kawhi idolized MJ. He would watch Come Fly With Me over and over until his eyelids started to ache. But he got Kobe to teach him MJ's moves that MJ taught Kobe. And Kobe and Kawhi would work out together in the summers since MJ lives out East. They shared the same helicopter pilot who tragically died in that crash.   So Skip Bayless is telling me, a 6'7, bigger and stronger Michael Jordan/Kobe Bryant is not good enough to beat Kevin Durant in a playoff series? Do you remember what happened in 2017? Spurs were up 25 pts until Zaza PaCheapshot slid his feet underneath Kawhi's feet to injure him.   Kawhi was ballin' in that Game 1 of the 2017 WCF. That 2017 Warriors is often considered the GOAT team and Kawhi had 26 pts by the 3rd quarter until he got injured from the corner. That 2017 Warriors team is way better than this current 2023 Suns team.   So go right ahead. Keep doubting Kawhi who's shooting over 40% from deep during the last few months. The last time everyone doubted Kawhi Bean Jordan, he won a chip. Kawhi's eyes light up every time he faces KD or LeBron. Do you think Kawhi wants to lose in the 1st round to KD? Kawhi is not going out without a fight.  Suns have Kevin BLEEPING Durant but we still have Kawhi BLEEPING Leonard here. He's not some scrub KD can walk all over. *Clippers* *in* *7.* KD loses in the 1st round in B2B years. I also got another bet with Kawhi averaging 30 PPG. He will need to and give us a couple of 40-pt games if we want to beat the media's (or Skip Bayless') overrated Suns.   Skip went against his Clippers and his current favorite NBA player because we added WRECKBRICK only to prove him wrong at the end. Thanks, Skip. Love ya man but don't jinx us. I can't lose. Money is coming to me no matter who wins. I've hated the Lakers for over 30 years although I started off a Lakers fan. I won't be hurt if they win it all. Still money in the bank to me. What it do, baby!!!
Also Imagine if Nuggets dont have Jokic, they prolly on the lottery pic right now, So Stephen A argument kinda meh
jokic would be mvp ...if he is black
Why they putting pressure on Harden ? He doesn’t have to score why isn’t the media crucifying HARRIS he’s suppose to be the second or third scoring option with the money he’s getting paid ! Harden needs to keep distributing that’s it. He did enough loosing to GSW every year now its time for Embiid, Harris to step it up. It’s a shame that Maxey is already better than Harris smh
Did JJ say he has a vote? Since when do they let retired players vote?? 🤔
Is that chris paul
So im the only one that sees Rondo's beard/mustache? Ok
Rondo is good. Have him on the air more often.
How is Jokic not even talked about.. the bias and narrative that ESPN is pushing, is CRAZY.
This show needs Molly because......... Help me out people
You suck Reddick
JJ breakdown of how he voted was clear and fair. Nothing convoluted or analytics based.
Jokic doesnt deserve a third imo
Rondo showed his hall of Fame iq during his career and is now showing it on this show, effortlessly. Can't wait for him to get into Springfield, he's so deserving of it.
Disrespect for jokic is on all time high pick last all star shouldve been captain team was in first place team have losing record when he dont play the team most likely be play in o out the playoffs where bucks n sixers would be in playoff with out embid n giannis just say u not jokic fan without saying it terrible takes
Jokic dominated the Advanced Stats.  Embiid dominated the Eye-test.  Giannis dominated in a way that's most apparent in in the Wins column
Giannis defense>>>
Two intelligent, experienced NBA players and one casual who has the most basic takes.
Rondo should go be an assistant coach in Memphis or okc. Coach them young guys.
Ok. Bucks without Giannis 11-8. Philly without Embiid 11-5. Not a strong argument. And also why are they acting like Middleton don’t exist?  They say Embiid is the better shooter (1.5points more per game) but Giannis is more efficient. Giannis is the better rebounder, passer and has more wins. What more do you need for MVP.
My thing with JJ is that he is such a numbers guy and yet Joel beat the other two great in more categories. Joel to me is more than just running under the rim. They are all great I think Tatum should be in there as well but Joel is the MVP.
I love how James freaking Harden doesn’t count as a strong teammate it’s only Embiid 🙄
Brooklyn nets will beat Philadelphia
JJ redick was Ben Simmons guy of course he wasn’t voting
Cmon man its crazy not to give Joel atleast one, theyre all great but giannis and joker had 2 each.
So good not to hear perks trash takes and huffing on the air lol
Didn’t know JJ got a vote
I can’t believe that no one brings up that near 60 point quadruple double that Embiid had earlier this season when talking about big games and moments that would contribute to their pick for MVP
Let’s face it embiid is the only 1 whining every year….I think he cares more about mvp then a championship
Can’t wait for rondo to come coach my wildcats!
I’m a huge Bucks fan but I’m good with Embiid or Giannis. Jokic does not deserve 3 MVPs.
Stephen WY  MB don't come for the game competition whit Jokic? He knows that losing from Nikola get  hem from MVP so you are no one correct 😕😕🤔
Stephen WY  MB don't come for the game competition whit Jokic? He knows that losing front Nikola get  hem from MVP so you are no one correct 😕😕🤔
Denver actually has the worse team without Jokic. It would be like 76ers losing both Embiid and Harden at the same time because he runs the offense.
2:29 smh rondo a champion goin on that bs route what does “he have a better team” have to do wit mvp 😂!? The man have James harden a arguably top 15 player in the league tf you mean what is this bs !? Giannis is the mvp why are we takin the defensive side out of the equation!?
Rondo sucks as a analyst 😂
why are people acting like Embiid doesn't have help? the sixers record without Embiid is 11-6 and they have Harden who leads the league in assists. Milwaukee is 11-8 without Giannis and Milwaukee has only beaten 3 teams above .500 without him. Philly is in fact better without Embiit than the Bucks are without Giannis.  just say "i want Embiid to have it because the others already got it" which they should strip the vote from everybody that votes like that.  also i hate the fact that they are already positioning the blame on to Harden if the Sixers get bounced in the second round, which they will be.
Record without a player is far less relevant to a MVP discussion than record with a player.  You're trying to figure who is the most valuable to a team.  That can only be determined when they're playing.
The spin is obvious. Scoring is at historic highs and you want to call Embiids season remarkable? Jokić has done historical things without promotion and actually endures your disrespect with class you are incapable of. I respect your take less every time you open your mouth… slow foreign white boy is mvp no matter how you spin it…
Reddick is a clown   I bet if everyone said Giannis JJ would say Embiid  🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Rondo was arguably the 2020 finals mvp it’s crazy how people forget !!!
I am Jokic fan but give it to Embid so he doesn’t cry again
Rondo is wearing a hair piece
JJ has a vote, but Barkley, Shaq and Kenny Smith don't?
It's just good to see top 3 big men battling for MVP
Jokic checks all the boxes. He is the mvp, but he won’t win it. He will win the finals mvp though.
give it to black people cause if you dont they gonna get mad and say its racist 🤷🏽‍♂
JJ Redick hates Embiid atp... taking unnecessary shots at him w/o context. Failed to mention Joel played through torn ligaments in both hands and a broken face last postseason. Also team records without Giannis, Jokic, Embiid don't take into account the strength of schedule.
Good to see Rondo as an analyst. He has great basketball IQ
Giannis is the mvp.
Giannis is the best player on the best team with the best record.  We need to get back to celebrating winners.  He's my MVP
Man this is crazy. Philly starts and stops w/ Embiid? That’s the same for bucks. Just because he’s “knocking on the door” smh. Man GIANNIS IS MVP. Best record, best player, avg. 30/10/5, best team in the league, best record..
JJ and Rondo should be the ones tlking basketball get SAS put of there lol
Stephen a hate milwaukee he does
Too many white males have MVP votes.
is harden just a ghost now lmao, if embiid is out at least harden is there
Joel has not delivered. And he will not win the ship this year.
louisville legend
The 76ers were 9-5 without Embiid. Comparing that with the Giannis record of 9-6 there's really no difference. The nuggets without Jokic, on the other hand, are pretty bad.
If you didn’t vote for embiid cool J.J  but aleast give logical reasoning.
Giannis is not playing their game and they boycott him. For me Giannis 1st, Embiid 2nd, Jokic 3rd.
BP was just name POTW that’s just show you how good the Bucks are 😂🔥
Why are people acting like Joel doesn't have a good supporting cast? Honestly I think he has more help than Giannis . And I also agree with Giannis . The league still hasn't figured him out. He's still the most dominant. He's still getting better. How is he still not the MVP? How is he not getting credit as a leader for the growth his team has achieved under his tenure? I bet the Bucks win the East this year
Ummm I’m sorry but both Philly and Milwaukee have more wins than losses without both stars on the floor
James harden never shows up in the playoffs!
How did Embiid have the worst team? The Nuggets have the worst record without Jokic lol.  The 76ers have the best record of the 3 without their guy.
Rondo giving daps to Tyrese Maxey is music to my ears
Lmao if you wanna talk about how bad your team is without superstar, Luka should win MVP 😅😅😅 Embiid has Maxey, PJ, Harden, Harris
Embiid is purely a narrative here man, embiid was padding his stats the last month and a half playing when games are over, giannis has had an injured kris Middleton this whole year
ESPN = clowns - JJ when the player played, best win percentage has Gianis then Jokic then EMbid so I vote for 1. Giannis 2. Embid 3 Jiokic. SAS When they don't play Bucks and 76's have a winning record and Nugets (didn't mention) losing record - so I will vote for Embid . Where this world is going???
This MVP race is extremely close. Who would have known 3 Centers would be the front runners in this shooting era
Glen Rivers is overrated !!!
Giannis destroys embiid ALL THE TIME
Embiid should be the MVP
If it’s truly based off of value, you take a great player off of a good team, they still win. If you take him off a decent or lower level team, they completely collapse. That’s true value. It’s easy to look good on a good team. But if a player is truly killing it on a 5 seed or lower, they might deserve it more.
Embiid didn’t perform well in the playoffs…. Really JJ, and Gianni’s and Joker were much better? Joker got sweeped in the 1st round and won MVP last year
Rondo look weird up there 🤣🤣
I used to think JJ was great. Sixers over Boston? Really? Lol
By SAS’ logic MJ shouldn’t have more than a couple MVPs. Lol.
MVP has been narrative based for years embiid will win it
this was great tell that 🤡 started talking get him out of there😂😂😂😂😂
For context, the Bucks are 11-7 without Giannis, 10 wins vs sub 500 teams, 1 against the Suns without KD. The 7 losses, 5 against playoff teams and 2 against sub 500 teams. That needs to be factored in when people being up that record, they beat bad teams and lost against good teams.
By the new standard ( minimum 65 games. ) Giannis doesnt qualify for mvp. Nor has he for the last 3 out of the 4 seasons.
I thought thr mvp was voted was based on points now we voting on emotions this why we losing society. Who is the best player?
Dummy Reddick needs to learn more math. By default if you're approximately the same level yet you play with the better team then it means you're a worse player.    If Milwaukee is "deeper", Giannis workload is lesser.
Chris Paul is in the studio today !!!
Khris Middleton played like 30 games tf😂😂
JJ is just hater
Is everyone forgetting Khris Middleton missed the whole season???? Imagine if Giannis had a player the same caliber as harden
Denver stops and starts without jokic too Stephen a the dumbest mf ever. I agree with JJ I’m not voting based off a false narrative being pushed that “it’s  Joel’s time” mvp should go to jokic or Gianni’s bottom line
Wish rando was still in the league LEGAND
JJ, tell us you're trying to get Giannis on your show without telling us that you're trying to get Giannis on your show Ps that Giannis is only the second player to average 30/10/55%, Joel was 30/10/54.8% Joel only player in history to average 33/10/50% btw... see how  that works🤭
Chris Paul on first take?!
Why does Stephen A bring up the bucks record without Giannis when he's wrong? The bucks are 9-6 without Giannis this year. The sixers are 9-4 without embiid
People quickly forget what jokic has done ALL YEAR. You guys are knuckleheads . Jokic is MVP
giannis is one of my favorite players and i hate everything about the city of philly and their people. but i don’t know how you can vote for him over embiid for MVP. blasphemy.
Wow jj was embiid’s  boy ,sheesh this isn’t gonna end well
People quickly forget what jokic has done ALL YEAR. You guys are knuckleheads . Jokic is MVP
Yeah it's Giannis tho
Keep Rondo pls. One of the greatest minds in the game. And curious how he can taper down Kendrick, put him on his place fr time to time.
I hate Duke with a passion but JJ is the man for sure
Like who goes out of their way to make a case for everyone OTHER than their former teammate? 🤷🏾‍♂️ I really thought Joel and Reddick were tight when he was a 76er, but I'm starting to think this dude really has a personal grudge against Embiid.
Why does stephen a smith get a vote. He did say he has something personal with kyrie
Joel probably deleted JJ's number after this
Rondo is a pleasure to have on the panel a true basketball professor.What a privilege!
As a Celtics fan. I must say this MVP race is tough. Honestly can’t go wrong with either player
Rondo should be on a team not on this
This is a tight MVP race for sure. Super proud of all candidates and will be super proud of whoever wins. 👏 With that said, Giannis has been dominating the League for years, Jokic has been carrying his team with and without Murray and Joel keeps pushing doors open even when they close on him. On paper, Jokic check more boxes in this season MVP race. Joel's scoring and defense is high so even if he wins, he's deserving.
Joel really gonna win a MVP because Giannis and the Bucks are too good? At the end Rondo literally said everything had to go right for the Sixers to beat Boston or MKE.   Stephen A is a joke in this conversation. He's a Philly boi pulling for Philly's candidate, I respect it, but just say you a homer bro, don't try to make these dumb arguments.
Stephen A’s argument is weak… 76ers 9-5 without Embiid and Denver 4-7 without Jokić lol
Yo america! Is it not alarming to the mostly american league (nba) that all top 3 mvp candidates are all not americans?
JJ better stfu when Rondo talks. That's a REAL baller
JJ Reddick tries so hard to stay neutral on these shows lol. I can respect that. I do wish he would just go "this is my MVP and this is why" instead of explaining why everyone could and should be a winner.
Jj could literally be right and they still would disagree with him lol
Embiid also deserves it for not having an MVP. It is only fair that he gets one too
This may be the most successful James Harden will ever be in the play-offs because he doesn't have to be the man! I can see Maxey rising up and playing big as well! This playoffs will be very competitive... Im ready!
Philly being 11-5 without Joel😐
JJ definitely has something against Joel and he definitely pushing for the white guy he just doesn’t want to openly seem bias.
Why Rondo speaking in 1.5x?
Jokic is MVPPPP
First time Molly didn’t interrupt 👏🏽
Most VALUABLE! IT'S IN THE NAME! Plain and simple.....Take off those three players and which team would have the worst record assuming the rest of the roster is healthy? I would have to say the 76rs would have the worst record without Embiid....their ACTUAL standings is enough of an indication to say where there WOULD'VE been if he wasn't playing.
i love JJ's idea of screening the games play they are in and the winning % of those games. especially on how close these 3 guys are in MVP contention in the last 3 years
this is very crazy year if you think about it. all three candidates neck and neck, all bigs, all in their prime. you literally cant go wrong with either pick, it just depends on how you decide to compare those final margins between them. i dont know if weve ever had such a close race between three people, where you cant fault anyone for choosing the other player
Nets will beat philly 😅
Nuggets stops without Jokic, Nuggets have worst record without Jokic, so Rondo and Smith are in a wrong
It’s crazy how just a few years ago ppl were saying bigs are becoming irrelevant when small ball lineups were emphasized
I COMPLETELY agree with Rondo on James Harden. Your not winning ANYTHING if he doesn’t shoot the ball PERIOD
What I don’t understand and maybe I’m just blind but the role players for Boston and Milwaukee are consistently putting up double digits in points and the bench has been playing great all season for both teams. Embiid has no where near that other than 15 assists from harden I don’t know why they can’t see how insane Embiid situation has been. Tatum was in a super slump and brown was holding it down. If harden gives us a 25+ game in points we hit the floor in awe and jrue dropped a 50 point game. Jj said Embiid didn’t play well cool, tell me what did Embiid’s supporting cast do to assist because I saw Embiid doubled with another man spying and his teammates had deer in the headlights all throughout basically telling him in so many ways we don’t want the ball
Watch Jxmy's video on Jokic and you'll see how good he really is compared to the other two.
Hold up JJ. Embiid was awesome in the toronto series. He tailed off when he got his face broken. That's not really fair to say he wasn't great last season in the playoffs.
Imagine being penalized for having good teamates
Look at SAS tryna bring his A game and hand with these high IQ ballers 😂
Giannis has been the best player the last 5 years 🔥 i see no lies
Clicked this so fast seeing rondo.
JJ: I'm removing narrative when voting for MVP  Stephen A: I'm soley voting on narrative
JJ REDDICK IS A BIG 76er hater
Stephen A got no idea what he’s talking about Philly matches up better with Boston cause the bucks got Giannis and Brook to stop Joel and no one on the Celtics can do anything to him😂
Is JJ seriously bringing up last year's playoffs when Joel got a broken face bone 3 DAYS BEFORE PLAYING the Heat?!  He fought back just to play the third game!
I'm learning about basketball but shouldn't the mvp come from the side who wins the championship??
It's between Giannis and Jokic
Who is the Most Valuable Player for his team? It is JOKIC!
Lmao “the sixers arent good without embiid” “Harden leads the league in assists” out of the 3 mvp candidates only 1 got a former MVP 😂 that this year is leading the league in assists
Harden had All-NBA type season, melton was great, maxey was great how someone can say embiid didn't got anyhelp :D
St A has already stated that he doesn't like to be on Milwaukee for finals last year. He doesn't like Bucks and disrespect Giannis when he has the chance. He doesn't care for the real game.
Philly was 11-5 without embiid too!   Nuggets were 5-8 without jokic though... if we are measuring that way. I dont think its a great measurement though. also rondos gotta shave man. ring goes on the finger not around his mouth
“Bucks and nuggets are better, harden was out” bro Khris Middleton played like 30 games 😂
Maxey needs to be a beast in transition like Tony Parker used to be for San Antonio
SAS a d rider I swear
It was a toss up between these 3 guys the past 3 years, what’s the problem w having the mentality it’s Joel’s turn. cuz it is
Best offense, best defensive rating, playing without a top 75 player… but lets give it to Embiid cuz he hasn’t won it yet… that’s called PITY
Won't disagree with anyone winning the MVP they all have been awesome to watch the whole season, but I think people forget how many injuries the Bucks had and for how long this season. Maybe I'm biased cause I'm Greek.
Hey guys,try to exclude Jokic,Embiid,or Gianis from teams during current season-there is Most Valuable Player of the season.Gianis have Brook Lopez(probably defensive player of year),Holliday and Middleton(star players),Emdiid have Harden(allstar-14 consecutive playoffs),Jokic have just good teammate players comparing to Bucks and 76.
Media folks just want Embid to get one so they'll vote for him. Giannis is the mvp... Middleton out nearly all season and still have the best record
Middleton has been out all year. it shouldn't be a negative to Giannis MVP chances that jrue and Brook stepped up with him. They deserve credit and that's why all 3 should be on All defensive team. If Giannis doesn't win it it should go to Joel. No way Jokic should be a 3x MVP before Giannis who should already have at least 3
Hope it is because it was his first time but Rondo was pretty unimpressive and boring.
76ers is not beating Milwaukee nor Boston at all in any series, Giannis is the best player in the League hands down MVP.
Bringing up Joel's playoff numbers after voters have given joker 2 straight mvps is wild
Love that life and to not know until now and do well a bit different. Love the stones😊
Embiid lead the league in scoring last year lmao. SAS shouldn’t have a vote😂
Stephen A is a Giannis hater as Skip is
JJ a Homer. Can't admit Boston us just the best team
Black people really want Joel to get a pity mvp
Lupe Fiasco on 1st take
He not wrong lol but Stephen A D riding the Celtics cause rondo is there
Giannis is the mvp last five years, but he doesn't care. He wants his second champion. Remember goat MJ shows his rings not his mvps
Lol 76ers have 2 20 point scorers  not named Embiid
The fact that Redick played with Embiid and still hating on that man speaks volumes about him
76ers are the best team without their candidate. They have harden, maxey, Harris, melton, macdaniels, Milton and a bunch of others who can turn it up when needed. That rondo point may be the worst ever
We all love to see rondo at the table! 👍
Embid is the MVP this season,  Redick stop it my fellow dukie..
Y’all giannis fans overrate his contribution too much at times. I think he’s the best player in the league but bucks have a stacked team with good coaching n front office. They can easily win 50 games without Giannis but Sixers aren’t that good without Embiid. Giannis better then Embiid but Embiid deserves the mvp. Giannis will win the fmvp anyways lmao
yessir JJ we all know Giannis is the best player in the world. Best player on the best team.
should be jokic, he has the best impact on winning, efficiency, +/-, and more. I see why you would pick the other 2 but imo it really should be jokic.
The only way for some people to see who the real MVP is, is for the celtics to beat the sixers in the second round
Embiid would cook jokic anytime he played him he’s just better it is what it is
The least JJ could have done was give jojo his vote, considering he helped extend his career a few more years. Who do you think was setting those screens for JJ on the sixers and passing out of doubles to him lol.
Nothing against regular sports pundits but this is why I LOVE to hear ex athletes talk sports. At the 9:15 mark when JJ's trying to find the right basketball term for what he's describing, Rondo immediately says it. No one other than an NBA would've known. Love it.
I hate to be that guy but seeing Rando on TV don't sit well with me. Given what he did to his wife this off season, its just not cool.  Did they ask him about that this episode?
Rondo should be a nba coach
Kentucky!
Philly’s record is good without Embiid and they have Harden. Jokic has no teammates that would sniff an all star or all nba selection.
Jayson Tatum should be in this conversation by his numbers but Giannis carried more to me than anybody
Y’all got little number 9 now
They not beating bucks
they got HOF Rondo on the panel 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Stephen A is the Skip of Giannis.
Did he say career year for brook lopez. Lol
I think Brooklyn might upset Philly
Rajon is efficient with his words.  Doesn’t speak many words but he says a lot when he does speak.
Rondo know his stuff
RONDO!!!!!!!
What's the point of SAS making an argument, when he has never - and would never- vote for Giannis in Milwaukee ^^ The clown even voted for Lebron the second time Giannis won mvp in a landslide. Furthermore, no serious person can think Embiid is better than Giannis.
WHAT ON EARTH IS RONDO DOING THERE??
They gotta get Rondo on the show more. This group of 3 they have here is fire and actually listenable
I watch the Sixers games. I watch the Bucks game. The weaknesses of Giannis gets hidden by the starting lineup (not the bench, bench is average). They Sixers goes the way Embiid goes. He not playing well, they loose. He plays well, they have a chance of winning.
What’s Chris paul doing  on this show 😂
Nice try to bait us ESPN. Solid civil conversation.
How didn’t they use the same logic they used for Embid for Jokic?? .. what would the Nuggets be without Jokic??
Hey it’s my favorite point guard…. Chris Paul !!!!
Stephen A. really shouldn't have a vote. The guy doesn't even watch or understand basketball. He conveniently forget to mention 76ers record without Embiid because it hurts his argument & he proceeds to  highlight the players surrounding Giannis. If this were KD or Steph, he'd say those guys elevated their teammates. When did Jordan get penalized for having Pippen and Rodman on his team? Or when did Magic get penalized for having Kareem or Worthy on his team? Did Shaq get penalized for having Kobe on his team? MVP was never about win percentage off the court, it was always about the best player on the best team usually (at least 90% of the time) the #1 or #2 seed in the league.  It took Jrue 10 years to get back to All Star caliber, that's after playing in Philly & New Orleans. Kris has been out most of the season & it was Giannis' level of play that helped him reach All Star. Meanwhile Harden is leading the league in assists with a double double stat and he was a big reason for digging the 76ers out of a lot of wholes with his play down the stretch. But Stephen A. wouldn't know that because he doesn't watch games, just highlights. I'll bet you he hasn't even watched 10 Bucks games this season.   Earlier this season he was saying Tatum should be the MVP because he's the best player on the best team & the Celtics were #1 then. Where is that narrative for Giannis. Also, when Perk brought race into the argument, Stephen A. was asked who he had for MVP, he said, Jokic, Giannis & Tatum, 1.2.3. So where did Embiid pop up for him in the last 3 weeks? You can't take this guy serious.   Several years ago he said Giannis couldn't win a chip because he doesn't have a jump shot, then when the guy won a chip & Stephen A.  came to TV like it was a funeral because he was so sure the Suns were going to win.  And by the way, for those who don't know, Stephen A. does not & will not vote Giannis for MVP. He doesn't like the guy & can't stand the praises that are heaped on him. Go back & watch old clips of MVP debates or best player debates. He even hates that he has to include Giannis on a segment for first take. He'll vote for anyone but Giannis. It's shameful that ESPN allows this guy to push such hate against a player who does so much for the league & ratings.
Where's Rondo? That's CP3!
SAS questioning only if Harden will show up in the playoffs. Embiid and Harden both shrink wym 😂
I love that a lot of the players from the celtics 08 team is in the media
Embiid about to win a pity MVP
The Sixers are a VERY incomplete team we gotta stop beating around the bush with this. Embiid is awesome. Harden has been cool. Maxey is dope. But they lack a LOT on the perimeter defensively compared to the other two teams in the East.
Stephen A is TRIPPING. The 76ers have a better and winning record WITHOUT Embiid this season (11-5) than The Nuggets do WITHOUT Jokic (5-8)  Definitely showing he did not do his due diligence on the stat and just said some wild statement and contradicting his optics.
Definitely will miss watching Rondo play, one of the best point guards to ever do it.
Was just watching Rondo’s highlights last week, ESPN mind reading lol
I think it just gets ignored that Embiid has James Freakin' Harden on his team. Probably the best teammate (this season at least) of any of the three
The fact that Kobe only have 1 MVP shows its more of a popularity contest
Why do they think Philly is really that team ? 😂 They haven’t proven anything or even have any indication that they are serious contenders.
Doesn't Rondo look like Kat Williams?! lol
Crazy non of the Top 3 candidates played 70 games.  Give it to Tatum for attendance.
Sas is right about the mvp take
Rondo looks like he just got back from the Matrix
I need more RONDO, he got that pedigree. He BEEN THERE.
Hmmm...idk if the Nets disrepect is warranted. I think it'll be way closer than SAS is saying
That guy in Milwaukee is the MVP EVERY YEAR!  Rondo and CP will be great college coaches! It will be dope to see both teams face each other.
i really want Rondo to help coach the celtics
It's gonna be satisfying seeing Giannis prove everyone wrong
Middleton been hurt all year long and they still got the best record. Philadelphia got Embiid a blue chipper and Horton Giannis Antetokounmpo is the MVP.
They need to add Eastern Conference MVP and Western Conference MVP awards.
Let’s be honest the only reason why y’all want embiid to win is because y’all don’t want to see jokic a mvp 3 times
Cool seeing rondo as a analyst
I agree with JJ.
There's a difference between "Best player in the world" & "MVP of the league." Just cause you win mvp doesn't make you the best player. Just because you're the best player doesn't mean you'll win mvp. It is what it is
SAS ever considered that they’re having career years because they’re playing with Giannis? A leader that can make his teammates better is what I thought being the most valuable meant.
NEED MORE RONDO!!!🔥💯
Idk y but I’m happy to see my boy rondo lol
I think Embiid is the best player in the league.   That’s it, that’s all.  Argue with your mother 🤷🏾‍♂️   Oh yeah, Embiid had the best win percentage last year, better record, led the league in points etc….. None of this talk was mentioned last year, but now it’s a problem? How sway….   PS. All three is worthy candidates, but my choice this year is Embiid.
Rondo with the post playing career haircut lol
So you're not gonna give it to giannis becouse his team wins aginst under .500 teams without him? Nah that's bs
I think it's really simple for me, you could get away with anyone of those three players, since the gap between them in terms of this season's performance is very small. Giannis has won 2 MVPs, Jokic has won 2 MVPs, Embiid has won 0...people can lament narratives, but at the end of the day, these MVPs are all contextual. And when it's all said and done, we're going to look at these 3 players and ask ourselves were either Jokic or Giannis in the last 5 years up to this point, 3 MVP titles better than Embiid, and the answer is "No."
Despise Stephen’s “mm-hmm” usage here and in every other. It’s the ‘you make a good point but you’re wrong because I’ve been around longer than you have and I’ve already stopped listening’. We all enjoy those types of people when they’re talking with us 🙄
63 Games played by Giannis, not enough for me
Rondo looking like he's going to fight for custody of his kids in Court.
chris paul wildin
LOL if lebron only has 4MVPS there is no way GIannis should ever get more than 3 Simple
Embiid has better team than giannis. It's just that giannis teammates having their best season. 76ers is offensive team and bucks are defensive team. 76sers has 3 20+ PPG players but bucks as only giannis who average more than 20+ PPG.
LMAO Rondo picking Embiid due to supporting cast when he has the season assists leader (Harden) and two other 20 PPG players (Maxey and Harden) - Bucks have 0, Nuggets have 1 in Murray.  Plus, 76ers have a better record without Embiid (11-5) than Bucks without Giannis (11-8) and Nuggets without Jokic (5-8).
JJ still hurt about the Sixers cutting ties stop the bs
who the .... cares
He wasn't great because he was hurt
76ers have a better record without Embiid, but the team revolves around Embiid? 🙄
Crazy how they had every excuse for Embiid to lose last year and now they call it a pitty mvp FOH
We need more Rondo and JJ on the show together. This is true basketball analysis from intelligent players, not just personalities.
Sifu Rondo in the building🙃
Embidd was injured last postseason
“Rondo you didn’t have to be a scorer” Brother Rondo led the last big 4 Celtics postseason in ppg and was by far the best player and scorer in the 2012 ECF vs Bron Wade Bosh and then boys in South Beach.
I love adding Rondo. I have rooted against many of his teams but has always respected him as one of the best minds on the court.
How does JJ get an official vote but nick Wright doesn’t 😂
This is the kind of conversation that we need.....no effing shouting or talking over. I give my argument and the rest is for you to either like it or not
What’s the point of bringing up his contact bozo
Rondo said Jokic had a better team around him than Embiid 😂😂😂  Stephen A then said Milwaukee has it all, but then says 76ers without Embiid being nothing is why Embiid should win...While Jokic doesn't even have any teammate that's ever even been an All Star. Jokic's team without him is the worst team in the league.
JJ was THE MAINNNN one months ago saying it was Jokic and it wasn’t even close and that embiid had a laughable argument. Then now the last 2 weeks he’s switched to giannis, same with kendrick perkins. Not saying you can’t vote for Embiid but I get Embiids point about it’s wayyyyy too inconsistent the reasons they give for not voting for him. 😊
To be fair he was injured for the last playoff series
I would never expect such a nice and calm way of speaking from Rondo!
Pity MVP loading...
Joker is the MVP stop the foolishness
Great segment I agree with s.a embid deserves mvp
Wouldn’t that make Giannis the mvp even more to have the team he has and he’s still able to average ridiculous numbers
Why is ESPN promoting a guy who has domestic abuse charges against him? (Rondo)
is rondo retarded? james harden tyrese maxey Tobias harris pj tucker deanthony melton
JJ is ESPNs best asset. 76ers are not even “those dudes” when Embiid is playing. I can’t agree with SAS and Rondo. ESPN needs to get Rondo a contract too.
What would Philly b without Embid 🤣 Stephen A said their worst than Milwaukee without Freak.He’s absolutely ridiculous
Sixers division is stronger than the other divisions that are in the mvp race. So do not count record if it does not go with Embidd
Joel clearly getting the sympathy votes lol
Guess what mr.fireman and plumber all of these 3 were the best player of their respective teams,why is this guy still talking,l guess the logo himself not even listening and looking at you
The difference between these 3 players are so marginal, it's insane.  - Embiid leads them in scoring and blocks.  - Jokic leads them in assists and steals.  - Giannis is just 2 points shy of Embiid's scoring average and ties Jokic with the most rebounds.  - All 3 played a similar number of games, E: 66; J: 69; G: 63  If I had a vote and the race was this close, I'd have no choice but to look at the next best players on their team. The guy with less help wins the MVP.  - Philly has Harden and Maxey averaging 20 pts, and Tobias averaging nearly 15. Harden and Maxey played about 60 games but Tobias also played nearly the entire season. .659 win% as a team.  - Denver has Murray, MPJ and AG averaging 20, 17, and 16. All three have been fairly healthy playing upwards of 62 games. .646 win% as a team.  - Giannis has Jrue, Lopez, and Portis averaging 19, 16. and 14. Khris doesn't count because he's only played 33 games. .707 win% as a team.   Despite what everyone says about Milwaukee being the "better" team, Giannis seems to have less help but still ended up with a better team record. Giannis gets my vote. Embiid is clearly winning it this year though, so I just researched all of this to prove nothing.
Crazy how JJ just retired couple years ago he already get mvp votes
I respect and appreciate JJ not wanting to be biased but it often seems like he's actually going in the opposite direction. It seems like every time he does these segments, Embiid is the only one he ever highlights what he's opposed to. He literally did air quotes for Embiid for saying he had a historical season, I don't remember him ever downplaying Jokic or Giannis at any point during the year.  Thankfully most of the other voters aren't going out of their way to downplay Embiid and are still voting for him.
Embids literally crying himself a river to get that MVP
JJ moving the goal post again. By his reasoning how do give it Jokic for the last two years? The nuggets were 4th and 6th place the two times he won.
Embiid gonna get a pity MVP 💀
wrong about Harden...garbage Harden
JJ basically used the only stat that Joel trail the other guys as the reason not to vote for him.
It's actually funny that Embiid got first in the ladder just because he dropped 50 on the Celtics that late in the season (or, to put it better, that close to the voting). This shouldn't be the reason why people vote for him, but the season in its entirety. Give me a complete explanation to why you think Joel is the MVP in a similar way that JJ made a case for Giannis and let's say that we have different opinions, on two great players making history this season. Don't bring into the conversation a single game and say that this closed the deal.
JJ trying to hard to explain his vote, loser.
Media pushing the Embiid narrative.
I really wanna see playoff rondo one more time !!!
JJ Redick made the best case
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the people who think Embiid deserved to win can still acknowledge the brilliance of Giannis and Jokic. On the other hand, everybody who wants Giannis to win seems to be rolling with the “it ain’t even close” argument, which is disrespectful to Jokic and Embiid because they’ve all had MVP caliber seasons. And if Embiid finishing runner-up the last couple of years isn’t a valid argument for him winning this year, that also means you can’t say Giannis should win just because he’s “been the best player for the past 5 years.” Finally, since when has Embiid been crying about the MVP? Not this year he hasn’t; this year he’s just been focused on dominating. And he has.
More proof that Stephan’s logic is garbage. The man is actually stupid. His only talent is having zero shame and being louder than other ppl. Can’t stand that douche bag!
Rondo is 💯 correct!
I think Stephen A is completely wrong. The 76ers have a much better chance to beat the Celtics in a 7 game series. Each game they have played this years has been close. Milwaukee is a different breed in the playoffs
This dude JJ is a snake lol
SAS looking like a straight clown in front of these two great BB minds!
Cant wait when this crappy shows are just with athletes
Giannis did this without Midd for most of the year.
Europeans are dominating the league as of late…
EVERYONE hating embiid in the comments 😅😅😅😂😂
Playoffs different than reg season right but we needa get off the disrespect of boston...they beat Milwaukee by 40...twice this yr FAWTY!
Giannis antetokounmpo is the real MVP
bruh giannis is clearly the mvp i loved jjs take of screw the narrative
Middleton was out like 30 games and Giannis still has the Bucks with the best record in the nba….Embiid ducked that recent Joker smoke something he should have capitalized on but was shook (he played the Mavs at home the next game) and Giannis out played Embiid like a week or two ago it’s either Joker or Giannis….it’s very simple
Rondo is so nice and smart but you can tell he's got issues too 😂
The same argument Stephan A made about Embiid, the same applies for Jokic
76ers winning percentage splits when Embiid plays tell the story.   When he plays they win 64% of games, when he sits they win 70% of their games. How does an MVP sitting make you win at a higher rate?😂
The bias is fr. How do you mention records without MVP candidates and not mention the nuggets record without jokic
Stephen A needs to retire
Jokic is not on their level. Defense matters Joel is the MVP this year. Giannis is second. LeBron Jordan and Shaq lost MVPs to narratives.
What this man did for my Lakers in the bubble was spectacular
why did Stephen A not see Giannis block Joel late last season with 2 seconds left to win the game, or the game winner vs KD Brooklyn the same week? Or bring up how Middleton has been out and even when he is back he is a shell of himself when he mentions why Jrue and Brook are stepping up so much.
Rondo is boring on tv ... get pat bev back.
Philly ain't beating Boston or Milwaukee.
They gave jj a vote already ?
Well, the Philadelphia 76ers were 11-5 without Joel Embiid this season and the Milwaukee Bucks had a record of 11-8 without Giannis Antetokounmpo this season...so its funny to see Stephen A spread false narratives
Where is that genius Perkins?
I think Giannis is deserving of the MVP ( as they all do ) but Stephen A argument ( philadelphia is not the same without embiid ) against giannis is literally the strongest point for Jokic, last time i checked his on court off court was like +12/-12 where embiid and giannis was like +7/0 the so his point for embiid is actually something he use as excuse to vote for embiid. If he said he is the top scorer and a great defensive player i would not mind but this is bs. If this was the point for him he would have choosen jokic
Giannis is the MVP
Kendrick Perkins was right
I can’t wait for Gianni’s to shut up Stephen a again
People need to understand that the mvp isn’t about who is the best player in the league, its about who is the most valuable player to their team. Take giannis out of the bucks they have 2 all stars, and a dpoy candidate. Take embidd out of the 76ers they have a former league MVP who is leading the league in assists. Take jokic out of the nuggets they have 0 all starts and that team is in the lottery.
Rondo and JJ are awesome. Anyone other than mad dog!
To be honest the worst team without its main guy from the bucks sixers and nuggetsot is the sixers .EMBIID MVP
They needa chg out fg% giannis didnt SHOOT 55% 🙄
More rondo....he calm and state facts
Philly was 11-5 with Embiid not playing, so Stephen A's arguments are just wrong
Maxie and Harden are nobody's now? Oh wow, poor Phili
Get Rondo and JJ back - I'm tuning in every time when they are on.. even if Stephen is on the panel
JJ got some typa grudge towards Joel maybe they didn’t get along bro u can’t see up here and tell me you watch both of there offenses and say Giannas is just as good or Defense. Giannas like Lebron gets chase down blocs what dude is Giannas shut down on the perimeter? But he so fast getting up and down the court for lay ups ,
Embid is getting pitty votes 😂
How did JJ gets the vote 🗳️ ? Just curious nothing against that fact though
Reddick a 🐍. Embiid is the mvp
Sixers need to play A+ to beat the Bucks playing at an A level, or the Celtics playing at a B level.
A few years ago they're were voting for the best player on the team with the best record. They keep moving the goal post...If they went by what they are saying in this clip years ago LeBron was the MVP for about 5 years in a row.
Don't know how such a stupid as Stephen can be an nba analyst ...
This is just like hardens pity MVP...ooh he keeps finishing second in mvp race..ah f it lets give him one 😑
Omg it’s my favourite pg Chris Paul
MVPs are pointless in a team sport, even worse it is given for regular season play that doesn't matter either.
Embiid is playing with a former mvp and 3x scoring champ 2x assists leader
JJ lying. U did not vote for Giannis. U voted for the white boy mf
Stephen a smith lol without embiid the sixers are 10 and 5
JJ and Rondo gives Espn what they needed it. Backed up opinions and content. You can't say anything too stupid in front of these guys or they'll call you out
So Stephen A Smith saying the Sixers have a chance against the Bucks but yet Giannis shouldn’t be MVP because the Bucks have better players around them than Embiid does? This man is such a Giannis and a Bucks hater. Make it make sense
I have to give it to embid this year. The man only played 66 games and put up 2183 points for the season. He’s a center who can do hesi pull ups from the mid range. Give it to embid
Embid didn’t have help he only has harden that lead the league In assists lol
If we’re going with “no help”, then Jokic wins.  They can’t win games without him.  76ers are 11-5 without Embiid.  Denver is 5-8 without Jokic.
Stephen A never gives Giannis his flowers
Rondo
I go by win shares…
JJ a sell out!!!! Hope Joel drops him as a “ friend “
It’s cool having rondo as a presence. He’s pretty cool calm and collected. Would love to see him pop off a few times in conversation
When you have to bring in extra stats you automatically lost the argument to me
Khris Middleton was lacklustre this year. Didn't Joker get one because his teammates were out. Giannis Giannis Giannis.
Jokic is the only guy that doesn’t care about the mvp 😂😂😂😂😂 Joel is pathetic
Embiid has an mvp on his team with him THIS IS STUPID. Giannis had khris out 40 games.   Rajon and SA sound idiotic
Is Jacque Vaughn gonna play Cam in the playoffs? That should’ve been the lead question lol
Sixers don’t have a better team than the Nuggets? James Harden was in the mvp race. 😂 cmon. Maxey having like a career high in points. Sixers have had great talent around Embiid pretty much every year.
Its so dumb why are we overthinking..BEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER OVERALL BEST PLAYER ON THE BEST TEAM..32 12 and 5 with defensive stats and title favorites...hmmmm let me think 🙄 cut it fvck out 🙄
Rondo is wrong that Embiid had the worst supporting cast. He plays WITH an MVP.
Stephen A's criteria for MVP: 1) Put up crazy numbers, 2) Your team has to suck but can't suck too much. Way to keep it ambiguous SA.
As JJ said all three of them deserve the MVP but IN MY OPINION Giannis deserves it. Firstly I have seen people push Embiid's 52 point game so much and he is a great great player but Giannis scored 3 50 point games too. Why arent his 50 point games mentioned every time. Also Giannis should be DPOY. I love Brook Lopez but he shouldnt be 1st in the dpoy voting. Giannis is the best perimeter and off ball defender in the league. How much he impacts offensive and defensive wise is insane. Yes you can make the arguement that Embiid does have a worse team around him but when a player when Giannis is having a historic season as well with the best record is not the best arguement in my opinion. Im not by ANY means a Emdiid or Jokic hater, i think they are both amazing but this is my take on the MVP. If you read all of this feel free to comment your opinion.
The only thing sixers fans can say about embiid is he led the league in scoring.  Giannis has better stats. Record, head to head record,  and giannis scores more per 36 minutes...... there is no argument for embiid or jokic that's any good.  Lebron effect is real
Giannis fr going through whay bron did. He is obviously the mvp, he’s getting snubbed if they give it to embiid bro. Giannis is the best player in the nba.
Love JJ and Rondo on here, want to see them more.
How the f#%k is steph a smith  still commenting on basketball he a sellout like skip Payless
Rondo said, "scoring out the..." what?
Giannis is the clear mvp.... so tired of these pathetic petty votes for mvp for embiid
lol JJ didn’t want no smoke so he took the easy route instead of picking Embiid or Joker.
If I had a vote , I would vote for Embiid , but Stephen A. Smith's logic , makes Jokic the MVP.   NO team has better/worse numbers when their best player is on/off  or present/absent than the Nuggets.
I love how the narrative is no longer number driven because jokic wins in all advanced stats finishing the year 🤣 But hey keep this MVP narrative up you guys are doing great
Rondo > Perk
I hope JJ doesn’t get a vote.
We Love Rondo. BRING HIM BACK  TO THE SHOW
Giannis is the MVP, the league tryna be fair and show Joel love
SIGH.  give it to Embiid because he don't got one yet is the equivalent to give all the kids a trophy.
There are to many clowns like Steven that don’t know basketball
Rondo dressed like a summer intern for a firm
Giannis is going to lose a lot of the votes to Embiid and vice versa. then Jokic will have his 3rd.
Best player in the best team. Most well rounded MVP. People  used the narrative, “well he can’t win the chip and he’s just run and dunk,” well he proved them wrong and yet he’s still not getting his roses.
Bring back co-mvp
Rondo a hall of famer in my opinion
Just 2 weeks ago JJ was clearly trumpeting Jokic is the only MVP with his numbers and stats. After Perk called him out now he's switching to Giannis.  🤡🤡
Giannis MVP. Point black. Embiid hasn't won enough
Good to see Rando
How did JJ Reddick get an MVP vote before Charles Barkley or Nick Wright?🤔
SAS dulsional
Embiid will win it but Giannis is the clear cut best player in the league
SAS take is absurd...just because other Bucks players are having career seasons this year doesn't mean you can take away the value of Giannis. The team starts and stops with him as well. If you're going to make a take like that, Pippen was arguably a top 5 MVP candidate during his prime with/without MJ. But do we take away from MJ's greatness because he had other great players around him? I don't think so...stop with the slander Stephen "Oh By The Way" Smith.
Rondo with the truth JJ with the facts . Embid deserves it but I know he wants that Championship more so I'm glad he isn't entertaining this and just playing ball
Sound like Giannis was crying to me
Jokic got dominated. Jokic is the farthest from dominant
Steven and rajon are clowns total idiots that don’t know basketball
Remember in the first half of the season, Tatum was favorite just because best player on best team? For some reason best player on best team don't apply to end of season.
JJ is the only person that brings facts and stats to every discussion.
What would nuggets be without the Joker?
Bucks without Giannis is play-in at best. Middleton been hurt all year. You got Harden with 20-11a league leading in Assist. Jokic had a weaker and hurt western conference.
Always an excuse why Embiid is not the MVP….
Perk changed the narrative completely after calling out JJ and the rest. JJ now completely changed his vote from Jokic only to Giannis completely proving Perk correct.
Harden's got an Achilles strain. He'll play but will he be the same as he was in most of the regular season?
RONDO!!!!
As a celtics fan, even though we have been very good vs milwaukee and philly, our biggest weakness is containing these super bigs. rob will been on and off injured all year and al horford is a year older now. If they beat us, itll be cause these guys dominate. Let the best team win!!!!! Embiid literally dropped 53 on 80% the other day against us.
I said this months ago and I'm gonna say it again if Embiid wins it's a sympathy MVP and I'm not tryna hate but like JJ said he doesn't have a mindset of "this is this player turn" and that is not how it should work. Giannis is clearly the MVP and I don't know how y'all don't see that. His team has the best record, he is averaging 30, 12 and 5 shooting 55% from the field. Why can't he be the MVP? People who say Embiid should win MVP don't have a better argument against Giannis.
This was just sooooooo gooood.... Rondo JJ and SA on the top of their gamee... Sheeeshh 🎉
The media had to really change the narrative for Embiid. Jokic just been playing ball. It’s like Embiid is begging to be MVP crying
Wrong head for that hairstyle Rondo 🚮
They're going with Joel because he's black & he's been vocal on him not getting it last year. Let's stop the BS. Voters get tired of the same guy so it's time for a new MVP.  All those voters aren't voting based on stats etc etc. They're only voting on the fact he was bitching last year, he's black and someone new needs the throne simple. Just because you average 33 ppg doesn't mean you should get it. Scoring titles and MVP is two separate things. Jokic was more valuable especially since he can kill you with points or by his teammates he sets up.
I am with Giannis
Congratulations to embiiiiiiitch getting his participation award
No wrong answer. Stop it with the teammates please. Brook has played the best he's ever played in his career. Same with Jrue. Both great players. Maybe their able to excel in their roles cause they got the MVP on their team? When you have a superstar who plays both ends it lifts his teammates past what most expect. No other candidate raises h8s entire team the way Giannis does. Bigger than nunbers.
If I was 10 foot 2 , I would be MVP 10 years straight. I like the devastating duo, Tatum or Brown.
What is Chris Paul doing on espn 🤦‍♂️
Jokic>Giannis>embiid  The media is desperate for something new so we have real collusion like Perk wants.
James harden was absolutely dreadful in the playoffs last year. You know what Joel is gonna provide. Harden has to be a threat to score.
Jokic all day everyday
The one thing i always consider is that for me anyways jokic has a better team then embiid that is true but also jokic has never played with another all star like the other too have. Although u can argue gordan should have been one this year but embiid and giannis have has higher caliber players to help them
Stephen sayihh my “mmhmm” every two secs lmaooo
*Rajon Rondo hairline is super crooked* 😂😂😂
100% it's Giannis...It's not even close but the media narrative is on Joel's side this year.
It's Jokic and it's not close.
Stephen a and rondo tag teaming jj got to love it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Rondo looks like he about to accept a plea deal
Not used to seeing Rondo calm cool and collected.  Lol
It's giannis j.j. Redick's take is  completely objective and I agree with him 100% it should be giannis this year A lot of people are just more impressed with the way joel plays because he's a big man who can shoot
I want to see a Philly vs Denver Finals so we can shut all of the Embiid haters up.
RONDO!!
jj has a vote? cmon too soon
76ers can't beat Milwaukee or boston
This Stephen.A talks 💩
Now Rondo is who needs to be discussed as HOF; a Reason teams won rings
The only reason Giannis and Joel are in the conversation is because Perk called all these people out. Perk got it right, admit it. Without Perk, all these guys would be adulating Jokic to the extreme. After Perk, they started giving it to Joel. But people like JJ won't give it to Joel now just to not prove Perk right. It is what it is.
Let embiid get his pitty mvp and see the backlash that comes for years after. I actually wanna see that nba. Giannis is mvp and easily best player
Giannis is being penalized for having a good GM. Astonishing.🤨🤨
Need more rondo on here
If use stephen a's logic the nuggets will be nobodies if Jokic leaves like the whole entire system of the team is based on Jokic tf? Its like on the early days of GSW when Curry didn't play the whole entire system booms. Philly for the most part plays hero ball they are just letting Embid iso. That is a much easier adjustment because harden can play iso very well himself. its not as the level of of Embid but the team has a fall back. Cmon these black folks are just brainwashing the people at this point disgusting
GIANNIS IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD HE SHOULD HAVE 7 MVPS , Stephan A is a 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
So jj didn’t vote for his ex teammate 🤔
the sixers are winning it all this year. yall can come back to this once they do
Maybe it’s just me but seeing Rondo and Reddick at the table talking instead of playing still feels weird. I know they’re older but they were key players on their respective teams
Do out here lookin like Prop Joe 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How do you not talk about an nba player holding his family at gunpoint and then the very next year the exact same player is on your flagship program
nobody cares about jokic anymore
Rondo look like he on his way to the Digable Planets/Arrested Development show in Brooklyn tonight with Eryka Badu and D'Angelo closing the set. I dig
So because the other GM suck Giannis gets 😂no MVP lol losers unbelievable
RONDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Eye test tells me Embiid. And Embiid had the more consistent monster stateliness whereas Giannis had some mediocre ones.
bucks 10-6 (62.5%) with out giannis and sixers is 9-4 (69.2%) without Embiid, SAM need to have a look on that too. Embiid middy, 3's, and free throws are better than Giannis but he still ends the season with a lower FG% (54.8% compared to Giannis' 55.3%). Though Jrue and Brook did step up this season but Giannis' supposed second man (Khris Middleton) is out for most of the season, while Embiid plays with a healthy Harden all year.
Everyone look up ‘Rajon Rondo family 2022’
MF POINTGOD RONDO
Just tel the truth. Black America is upset so no Jokic. Imagine if we had talked for weeks that Embid is winning because he is black, you think he be no1 now. If jokic win then you got 2 white against one black in the history boots. That hurts a lot!!
Giannis is the best player in the league with the best team record, jokic has the most impressive numbers and stats that leads to winning along with #1 seed in the west, embiid avgs the most points. This really should just be a jokic vs Giannis convo 😂😂😂
Jj hating hard.Embiid had a fkn broken face last year bro
i really dont understand Jokic is always on the list😅
JJ and Stephen is so annoying
How is Rondo on the air after he was threatening his wife and kids with a gun lmao
These guys can’t stand seeing big market teams be great. Giannis has been the best player in the league for years now and has won a finals unlike the other two mvp candidates. This shouldn’t even be close
I would understand these "better team around " arguments if Giannis and Embiids teams  had the exact same or nearly the same amount of wins and losses. But because Giannis has the better team around he also won more games as a team. For me that metric cancel itself out exactly at that moment. I guess the thing is , how would these teams do if they switched these guys around. If Giannis played for Philly would they have a better record ? And vice versa.
I really feel like the hate for embiid is really showing more and more he was sopose to win 2 years ago but I feel like he deserves it more this season….
if you put joel and jokic with the bucks they wouldnt have the best record. if you put giannis with denver and/or sixers they are team to beat.
Am I trippin or did JJ drop and F-bomb at the beginning 😂
4:04 IT DOENST EVEN MAAAATTERRRRRR
JJ reddick be trying too hard to play both sides on everything
Embiid is the MVP.
stephen a smith once again with the Giannis disrespect
Petty MVP if joel win
good clip!!
I'm not saying I don't have confidence that Philly can pull this off! Let's not forget they could have slipped up and lost in the first round against Toronto, no I'm not saying anything that they have not done incredible things. All I'm saying they have to stay healthy and be committed to each other... I don't want to hear if they choke in the first or the second round of playoffs, cuz if that happens here comes the criticism on them... what I'm saying is this they could do it if the domino pieces don't fall
I hope the bucks make it to the finals just so stephen A  has to spend  every moment he can in milwaukee 😂
They should have an MVP in each Conference like MLB has one in each League. The NFL should do the same too!
Rondo you showed why you ain't on an NBA team this season lmao harden is better then any teammates joker or Giannis have lmao these mfs stupid
Rondo one of the smartest players of all time
I almost made it to the NBA if it wasn’t for all that d@m weed
Why didn’t Stephen A bring up Philly’s record without embid this year
Every time I hear Rondo speak I instantly think of the Chris Paul video and him asking “nah, who are you?” 😂
That poor woman has not said 1 word this entire video.
Stephen A keeps bringing up Milwaukee's record without Giannis (11-8) while refusing to acknowledge Philly's record without Embiid this season (11-5). I don't understand how you can present one side of an argument and no elaborate on the other side, especially if you're splitting hairs like that to decide the award winner.
ESPN, the king of racists😂
Embiid, had 33 10 and 4 and shot 54%
Tuff Giannis, lebron was clearly better than anyone that won a MVP in his years. Giannis has the best team in the nba Brooke Lopez is DPOY Jrue hoilday is first team all defense. Joel has none of these things in his team other than a washed up harden.
I heard JJ say he voted for Giannis.   How do he and Perk have votes but Barkley and Kenny Smith do not?    I am not sure Perk is capable of selecting an item from a menu.
How can you bring up Bucks record without Giannis to say he has help then go on to say sixers start and end with embiid when sixers record without embiid is better than bucks without giannis
Yall saying Gianni should unequivocally be the MVP is a complete disrespect to Jokic and Embid. This why I can't stand these talk shows. All they're doing is creating a barbershop environment where people can argue who the best is every ten seconds
Embiid😂
Also I like how every player get called by first and last name good players get nicknames and great enough we call them by a first name bassist the Rondo. We call him by his last name which is kind of dope.
Embiid will win it but Giannis is the real MVP
The Embiid doesn’t have a team around him thing is so b.s.
How JJ says in order for Philly to win Joel has to play great but he’s not MVP
All this talk about the Sixers being nothing without Embiid or the Bucks struggling without Giannis... Has anybody ever seen Denver play without Jokic? They'd be at the bottom of the table. They glide past +/- so easily...
Gunna miss playoff Rondo …
JJ a hypocrite. If all 3 had MVP seasons for the past 3yrs, Y is Joel taking a backseat EveryTime. It’s his time, that’s not sympathy vote if they all 3 had MVP deserving season & the other actually got credit for theirs
rondo stoned as f...
Giannis
If the Bucks play the 76ers and both Giannis and Joel are out the 76ers will win easily Stephen A tripping
The Sixers without Embiid this season were 11-5 while the Bucks had a 11-8 record without Giannis btw. This is the argument that people keep bringing up about Giannis having a better team around him. This is how delusional the media are and the people who blindly listen and follow whatever they hear without checking the facts first. But go off Stephen A., you do have 30 years of basketball experience right?
Stephen A if you think the 76ers are bad without Joel Embiid. You should watch the Nuggets without Jokic. Your opinion on MVP would change
Idk what giannis did to SAS but he really don't like him, and the bucks.
now thats some good basketball convo
They failed to mention that Denver Nuggets drops from the best team in the West to the worst team in the west as soon as Jokic stops playing. BIAS MEDIA
I know it's a long shot but anyone hoping for major upset by the Nets on Sixers just to see the reaction of the Nets haters?
I remember Rondo calling Stephen A. "Punkass reporter". Now they work together 😅
White men can't win. Campagne!!
Definitely is unfortunate for Giannis’(the best player in the league) mvp odds that he happens to be playing on better teams than his contemporaries. He might really be worthy of it but his team being decent without him somehow diminishes him.
When I see JJ 12pts per game avg all I can think about is what Jerry West said.
And Nuggets are terrible without Jokic too
I think I agree with the coach comments. We need to see what rondo's brain brings to basketball, and booth work ain't it. My guy looks borderline uncomfortable
Stephen A just REFUSE to acknowledge Giannis
People need to watch JJ's pod on this, he explained in detail why... GIANNIS was having monster games & media would not talk about it.
JJ Speaking truth per usual!
I think rondo should play on 1 more team, in 1 more season too contend 1 more time. Too have a goodbye season.
Yeah Joel and jt  didn’t get along in Philly Fosho
Lets be real, Denver is the team that would be hurt the most if you removed the candidate from their line-up. 76ers have harden and maxey, and the Bucks have Middleton and Jrue Holiday. If those teams are healthy the entire season without Embiid, Giannis, and Jokic. They all suffer but Denver likely doesn't win more than 20 games. Jokic is their offensive system.
Love Rondo
Here is the flaw in Redick's logic. Embiid doesn't have the strong starting 5 that Yanis has, so when a Defense has to guard the other 4 starters on bucks. That gives Yanns the edge in scoring and other things like rebounding and assists.
Giannis 💯💯💯
How does JJ get a vote with all the crazy things he says but Nick Wright doesn’t have a vote
Can’t fool us, ESPN. We all know Rondo, who is this guy?
They got rondo looking like Prop Joe in the thumbnail
we used to say lebron's biggest skill is making the players around him better. why is it you think that all these people, bobby portis, jrue holiday, brook lopez, are all having career resurgances and years when they joined the bucks? giannis makes everybody on his team better.
Chris Paul on the show 🔥🔥
Giannis deserves it for leading his team to the best record without having Middleton for most parts of the season in the harder conference
Way to turn your back on your former teammate JJ. You literally just changed your pick to giannis to prove you weren't racist
Glad Chris Paul is in the First Take so nice to see him there
Don't sleep on the Brooklyn Nets. I know they got no stars but they can be a surprising team. I can see them win 2 games against Philly.
How about Embiid is a way better defender than Jokic...
Embid was also matched up with the celtics bench center when he dropped 52 LOL
I thought MVP is the best player on the best team… When did that change?
Embiid and Giannis played 4 times this season.  They split the 4 games. Giannis outplayed Joel twice. Embiid outplayed Giannis once And there was one where they were about the same
Stephen a is buggin thinking Milwaukee with brook lopez and holiday winning a chip. He’s a hater.
Rondo looks wild with that hair…
Rajon was a head coach/player ...man he made the lakers click wit the 2nd unit lakers in their championship run
Giannis will win mvp he played the most games and his team is #1 seed
Embid has dominated giannis and jokic head to head
Which Milwaukee did Philly beat on the road? Stephen A? The Herd?
Stephen A literally just named a bunch of players on the 76ers that are better than their matchups on the bucks...
JJ and Rajon would be a great GM and Head Coach (respectively) 1-2 punch.
Careful stephen a, rondo might spit
There is truly no wrong answer as long as it’s one of those 3 players. Kudos to all 3 on making it such a hard decision for the voters.
Always thought rondo should be a coach one of highest IQ players in basketball
JJ has become everything that he said that he hated about the media. Congratz 🤡
I rock with Ronda on here
Boston overrated but y’all will be reminded when Finals JT shows up again
My favorite point guard Chris Paul
Giannis for MVP!
Rondo and Steven won dis one no lies🤣🤣🤣🤣⭐️💯
Giannis is the mvp in my opinion and Joel 2nd. But for his team giannis is key and he is the most dominant player.
how tf does JJ have a vote already and he just started his media career
Imagine Jokic if he had Harden on his team
Giannis just like he said has been the best player the last 5 years. It’s not even close
Why my man rondo look like a villain in a Kung fu movie
This MVP talk is such a big thing this year, because media realizes that this is their time to shine, MVP talk is all about the media, who vote for who, constant debates, etc. Fk the players, I want my lagecy as a media member!
I’ve seen Giannis get waxed way too many times this season by 40+ for him to by MVP. But I get it.
For JJ to say Embiid wasn't great in last year's post-season when he had a broken face & a torn ligament in his hand is CRAZY
Joel can take his sympathy mvp😭
😂 did JJ just slip with "the f*ck" 0:17
With Stephen A’s logic, Lebron shoulda won 2018
Patrick Beverly last year and Rondo this year 😂
Give Joel the gahdamn mvp dude put up MONSTER numbers
Good cast on this segment get Kevin love and Andre igoudula for a segment
Hold up, rondo said the team around giannis is better than the sixers without embiid? The sixers literally have a better record without embiid than the bucks do without giannis. Add on that Middleton been injured for more than half the season. This argument of the bucks being better than the sixers this season with both teams not having their star players is just factually incorrect
ESPN did him dirty w that thumbnail 😅😅😅
JJ, Joel broke his face in last year’s playoffs.  We haven’t really seen Joel reach the playoffs and stay healthy. If he does, watch out.
JOEL EMBIDD THE MVP SOUNDS LIKE JJ HATING🤣🤣🤣DIXK RIDING
So somebody thought it was a good idea to give JJ a vote after some of the dumbest comments he's made this year?
Naah Chris paul is saving espn ratings , keep him on the show
Rondo gets straight to point I think thats only person to ever be on the show to talk for a minute or less lol (not including Molly)
What does Oso-whatever mean??
Wat about shai
JJ "they're all MVPs"   No JJ one guy who is deserving, who you didn't vote for has 0 MVPs.
Also, rondo dressed Like he’s going to court 😂
The deciding factor should be DEFENSE. Lol... the voters completely disregard half the game
Jj I don’t respect your opinion anymore
They got Rondo on tv
I think embiid should win he’s had an amazing year but if Gianni’s gets it I won’t be mad. Dude is right he’s been the best player in the nba the last 5 years.
Rondo should be coaching!!!!
Rondo preaching !!!! @4:48 💯💯 If Harden isn’t aggressive and doesn’t up his scoring to 26-30ppg, 76ers don’t stand a chance against the BIG DOGS like the Bucks and Cs. Watch the last game when they beat the Bucks, Harden had 38, he needs to be scoring around 30 to beat teams like that
Love seeing Rondo on the show. I really liked him back in his OG Celtics days. I do agree with him too. Joel deserves MVP👏
Rondo got to be a head coach one day mannn
Jokic fans want Giannis to win mvp they do not want Embiid to win mvp ever
JJ with the facts it’s more about legacy for me because that’s part of the picture when we look at history of the game but all of them deserve it. Giannis without Middleton is where I think he takes it.
They all deserve it, but I think Embiid deserves it more. He got robbed of the ROY, last season he should've won as well and this season he needs to get his flowers. But any one of these 3 will be a deserving MVP
LEGOAT 💪💪
The MVP talk is so distracting throughout the entire season. Especially the NFL and NBA. ESPN is building way too much content around it for extended periods of time, regularly. I'm a Philly fan and have had Hurts, Harper, and Embiid in the running in the past year.. remind me every now and then and maybe the week before voting as a fan who's actually invested.
Embiid has been the best player this season, period
They need to start having coat MVPs they need to start sharing the award at this point because people just can't wrap their heads around multiple players having a great season and trying to make this such a bigger deal than what it truly is I have no problem with Joel Embiid winning the MVP but let's not Ignore Nikola Jokić season and Giannis season Because in the end the word is partly about how your team season went not how your team season finished necessarily because if we're being honest I don't think too many people see the 76ers and to a degree the Denver Nuggets in the finals anyways
I really feel like Stephen A Smith doesn’t like Giannis and the bucks lol.
Stephen a explaining why it's a participation trophy now days
MORE RONDO
I can't wait to see Rondo as a head coach
2:48 To SAS, Philly is actually better without Embiid than Milwaukee is without Giannis. Philly 11-5 without Embiid, Milwaukee is 11-8 without Giannis.
Love rondo !! One of the smartest
I love how people are just so desperate for it to not be jokic when the guy averaged a near triple double on the best team in the west. So what if he’s won two in a row. He’s been the best player this season during the regular season.
No love in Philly for JJ no more voting for the bucks
I wish Giannis would call out Stephen A for the constant disrespect he gives him
Embiid has Harden, Tobias, and Maxey. The 76ers are still a solid team without Joel so I can’t role with that argument. And that argument applies more to Jokic out of the 3 guys.
Giannis the mvp Joel getting sympathy votes “its his turn”
Imagine if the Bucks and Celtics both lose in the first round
Giannis is MVP...no question about it
JJ gets a MVP vote? Wow this award really is a joke
Embiid can win mvp but Greek is by far the best player in the nba it ain't even close 😂😂 dominating past 5 years. Today's era follow the trend too much
Imagine jokic vs Embiid in the NBA finals Center vs Center I got Sixers winning that series
First time I’ve ever disagreed with JJ
Rajon Rondo is one of the coolest and unique names in NBA history.  Better than a generic John Smith or Matthew Jones.
James Harden deserves a ring y’all can hate but it’s true I hope it happens I believe in him
Giannis is the best player in the league. It's a shame that MVP voting has always been about narrative and garbage non-basketball points. MJ should have 10, LBJ should have 6/7, and Giannis should have at least 3.
LOVE RONDO AND JJ IN THE LINEUP, BIG DIFFERENCE FROM MAD DOGS 1930'S STYLE AND PERKS HUFFIN AND PUFFIN ☠️☠️☠️
ESPN just stays having controversial guests on their show haha
