Anduin gets immidiate auddiance with Archon meanwhile we had to follow the path to ascension to meet her in Bastion XD
Love it <3
All these realm leaders look powerful and mighty but are useless.
All these realm leaders look powerful and mighty but are useless.
ost?
1:23 when my bis going to another player XD
"Even in these high Heavens, Angels can still feel fear." Blizzard ain't do nothin' new.
Join our cause or be made to serve
Нормальная отсылка👍🏿👍🏿👍🏻👍🏻00:13
What are you doing step-king?
2:19 Why does that look like Arthas stabbing the Frostmourne in to  ice to wake up sindragosa in wotlk cinematic?
So, we're re-hasing *Rise of the Lich King* again?
lol who is writing for blizzard? the rats left over after they FIRED 97% of their employees?
Sooooo... frostmourne 2.0?
BRO WAS THAT VARIAN HE PASSED?!?!?
cringe
Lame company, stop supporting this lame company
you're lore is meaningless after you killed arthas, blizzard. stop wasting people's time
Is Arthas in the Shadowlands?
Hmm this being tainted by the maw is approaching, Guards please let him in and lower out defences so he can stab me in the chest.  For an Immortal Death God, she's not very bright, you'd think she'd be more careful after her Paragon of "Loyalty" betrayed her.
Varian going "That boy ain't right"
R.I.P
Why is it taking so long to release boys, I'm readdyyyyyy
Now we know the Primus hid his sigil on that island, and we helped deliver that sigil to the Jailor 😄
Checking in here to see how the story is go.... Oh...  Oof
I'll trust Sylvanas' mind games this time
Now they made another bull story
Wish version of Arthas.
Arthas and Kel'thuzad will deal with the jailer and make Anduin minime
No.. just no...
Someone knows the name of the track that plays in the ending?
Let them come... frostmourne hungers
Man these are getting worse and worse and to think that WoW`s cinematics were once great
_glad you could bake it Uther_
Sylvanas will help players with defeating the Jailer. IMO
Uther: Really bro? Right in front of my salad???
Anudin is arthas son
Can't wait to see Jania's and Baine's reactions to this.
Tyrion: Really?
1:23 anyone hear that brief sound? yeah the nostalgic one.
Garbage!
why is this so meme able though
Another Lore gone memberberrying.
That "Yyyouu" though x3
WHERE IS ARTHAS 1.0???????
She still lives
Ironic, Sylvanas was forced to serve  one death king. And she forced Anduin to serve another x)
Apparently blonde paladins are Blizzard's punching bag
Anduin just keeps re-rolling class man.
See you all in the summer when this content finally releases.   *unsubs*  for now ill save my money while the game suffers this massive content drought.
Archon: Has Sword. Anduin: Fear my extremely slow and telegraphed attack! Archon: Tries blocking with hands.
If only we knew our little boy running around Stormwind Keep would turn into the next Arthas. :V
One who would bear any curse to save his homeland.
scuffed arthas
Lame. Looks like Activision's interns now ran out of ideas too.
Ysera sacrifices herself to defend the Winter Queen
Arthas 2.0
So they casually let Anduin in there, no questions asked? Then let him casually leave without everyone ganging up on him?
Anduin and Arthas Father/Son conspiracy theories are coming to fruition! 😱
Wait where did that sword came from
Loved how the music turned slightly into something WotLK-ish when he saw anduin... more and more im certain arthas is his biological father.
Why there are so many Godfather references in the comments? What makes you think about Corleone when you watch this?!
So the next expansion is WOTLK again, lovely.
Arthas Menethil: NO
Yo where is that version of Anduins theme in the OST...
World of Soapcraft
so relaxing
An karanir thanagor
_An Karanir Thanagor..._  Uther: Did you hear something?
Shalamourne
Tards of Domination.
cringe
Is that the soul of arthas, or Ner'zul?
WAIT WHAT COULD THE WINTER QUEEN DO
So she draws her sword when she realizes who is controlling him, then she just drops it to watch herself get dunked in slowmo? Pretty well thought out sequence there Blizzard.
So release date?
Darkduin
has anyone know the background music link for shadowlands cutscenes?
Not releasing until April or May... god.
Okay, calm down.
Glad you could make it, Arthas.
Can't wait for Sylvanas to finally die in this expansion.
What's the ost fr 2:52?
Three steps: Break the ice Create next frostmourne Hail to new LK  (Defile on me!)
Frickin' Blizzard, yes, yes, take my money, alright!!
Amazing Work ✌️
That better not be arthas possessing him
All this is happening while Bwonsamdi is just eating popcorn and torturing Mueh'Zala for all eternity.
Uther ... Sadge
9.2: Wrath of the Boy King
Woah
Well the bastion is not forever anymore now
arthas...... 2!
Get rid of half the currencies and systems and it will save the shadowlands.  Great lore, great game play, great classes dragged down by waste of dev time garbage systems.
Hope Sylvanas stabs the Jailer in the back soon
Whoah the story gets even dumber....
ENTIRE BASTION MUST BE PURGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jailer: Nothing escapes the Maw! Literally everything this expansion, including the Jailer's own forces over and over again: *escapes the Maw*
Does any one know whether varok saurfang is in shadowlands?
Why do people still play this game the graphic are horrible lol
Anduin's character will benefit greatly from getting this darker tint to him..
where is the death knight glowy smokey eyes for anduin??
2:33 When you order "Arthas The Lich King" on Wish.
That's my queen!!
The history of Arthas is the best
That was dumb and anti climactic
Music is amazing 👏
You can't do Arthus better than Arthus, so stop trying!
Oh great, another Arthas but with extra steps to deal with
*DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC*
Sylanas; *starts questioning her choices after Anduin is forced to serve the Jailer*  Delaryn Summermoon and Derek Proudmoore: "Are we jokes to you?"
Can't wait for another Illidan
Varian- “Look how they massacred my boy”
Winter Queen has left the chat.
I'm pretty sure the Arbiter could have caught Anduin in her hands? They are big enough...
Okay what if Anduin meets Arthas in the Maw and Arthas helps him overcome the Jailer???
So the leader of Bastion is just useless? Nice to know.
the cinematics are not that great... usually blizzard does it better, it looks old
anyone else hears the wotlk track when anduin passes uther?
was he . . .  Ner'zhul - soul ??
Oh My God (or what ever azeroth considers gods)
PiRaTe DrAgOnS tho
This blade can only be pointed to two directions. Pointing forward or on the ground
Well, that was predictable...
So let's see. Garrosh 2.0, Arthas 2.0, Deathwing 2.0?
Let me guess...the Archon dropped anima.
what until varian discover this!
Is it just me? Sylv looks like Christine Stuart...
would have been nice to see what they did to anduin
seems like blizz had their recycle bin close to hand.
Just when you think Blizzard's writing can't get any stupider...
My patience has ended!
Why were the guards pushing Uther along harshly? What did he do wrong?
"Anduin, my son. The day were born...."
so increadibly lame.
So they just let him walk out with their leader’s soul?
Glad you could bake it, Uther.
Maybe Anduin IS the true son of Arthas..?
Another old god prophecy fulfilled
So is this say...a True Lich King?
This really doesn't help the Jailer's street cred that he has to send Anduin in when the Kyrian player isn't around.
anduin had more charisma in ~4 min here than every other cinematic.
The jailer caused bad lore/storytelling
Is Sylvanas Darth Vader now?
when varian finds this out...
WIND WOOSHING
Here we go again
Better do more flappy bird dailies to save the world, MAW WALKER!
Uther: Here we go again.
Shadowreaper Anduin
How did Anduin get out of the maw? The players are the "maw-walkers", the players are the ones that had to be there to get Baine, Jaina, and Thrall out. The players are the ones that the stone is attuned to in order to leave the maw. The maw is supposed to be inescapable, "nothing escapes the maw'. If the Jailer can allow or make others leave (Anduin) then how come he can't leave? How come the Jailer doesn't or hasn't sent armies out of the maw? Is the maw really inescapable? Are the players not really maw-walkers, and that anyone can go into and out of the maw?
Like father, like son.
How did this happen, haven't played wow in years and didn't think anduin would turn like that lol
why are there no attractive women in this whole expansion
Brilliant
Yeah lore can never be good again after Wrath of the Lich King...
Did anyone pick up on the fact that Uther could sense the Jailer's power through his chest wound when Anduin walked passed?
you know why didn't show us if sylvan did do it to him and become mind control or jailer did it
This doesn't make any sense.
Finally arthas again but made in china.blizz resurrect arthas again.
Why is Uther prisoner and why he touch the wound while seeing Anduin?
Hope we see that Death Knight Anduin skin in HotS!
Tuvok, raise shields! Reverse the polarity of the shield frequencies.
Leah possessed by Diablo gets into heaven and burned it all. Same plot
all that for 35 anima....
Anduin just looks like Arthas. Lazy design should have done more to make them look unique.
This video proves how much the jailer valued Arthas, and since Arthas died, he now made Anduin just like him. This expansion is becoming better and better by the minute.
Makes you wonder how strong Bolvar's will must be...for him be able to resist the Jailer.
Noooo don't take Anduin from us man, he's the best character in the game!
The Winter Queen: *chuckles* I'm in danger.
Look how they massacred my Snu Snu and Ara Aras.
DK Anduin is so hot Right Now
People never heed Piccolo’s sage advice
That's the stuff!
Thats what happens when Azeroths Champion isnt around.
Blizzard: "So anyway here's a good view of the next raid weapon everyone will grind for" 0:14
1:24 The Arthas theme when Anduin walks pass Uther.... Arthas too would give anything to serve his ppl... just like Anduin.
Bravo.
It looks so amazing. King Arthas Wrynn lol
La jodiste Anduin xD
The Jailer put Arthas soul into Anduins sword just like he put Ner'zhul into Frostmourne
World of Warcraft: War Crimes, page 139 anyone?
So...when will World of Starcraft be coming out?
No offense but we saw what the jailer is mostlikely planing to do and yet they just let this Alliance boi to just waltz in like he could ever escape on his own. Just believing the Alliance boi. Very smart. :)
What was the powerlevel of this archon thing again? 🤣
Watch Bliz make Uthur get bodied by Arthas 2.0.
Only downside to this is more time in the maw...
Blizz confirmed the Archon is alive
IS THAT VARIAN THO
Why "Kingsmourne". Why not "Shalamourne".
Wow, we're actually losing for once.
Kings defender became kingmourne, DK Anduin 😍
get better writers, jesus christ
Love it when the bad guys when for once, it doesn't happen often but it creates tension for us the heroes.
Sylvanas is now playing the same role that once was played by Ner'zhul, but, different of the filth orc, she doesn't subjugate Anduin for complete.
That's some lazy Blizzard writing but that's expected of this company now days.
... Oh look, an Arthas 2.0 to go with our Garrosh 2.0.
3 keys remains for 3 vessels to capture the vessels are jaina thrall and baine
2:16 The Archon and Jailer are apparently siblings.
3:16 Inb4 Sylvanas regrets her decision to help big guy out of the hole.
cheap mobile game
And all of this because Arthas had to have his fun raising the banshee...
Anduin became my favorite character 😥
*1:22** wow Artes😥😓😭*
This is cool and all but how did he come back to the Maw? Did the Kyrian just let him leave after that? Their security is abysmal!
So much for an "Eternal One."
Sylvanas should’ve known that the Jailer would create another Arthas with Anduin..
It’s Shalamourne you SWINE
Why do all these big powerful godly like beings always get one shotted? 😂😂😂😂
New expansion?
Anduin killed new customizations and the Archon huh?
Arthas needs to redeem Anduin...
Anduin/jailer:  Now we are ONE
Look how the massacred my boy
Our bald man haven't reacted to this. Sadge
Anduin is finally cool
Awesome cinematic!
Well that was dumb
Wow kyrians are like night elves. Punching bags for everyone.
Originality seems to have left the building
WotLK feels kicked me so hard while watching this,gg!
The Uther part is truly brilliant it made me tear hard...poor Uther..
Shadowlands must be purged.-Anduin Menenthil
And with that, this expansion is also ruined to me.
0:52 "None of this should have happened." Yeah, maybe if your failsafe hadn't been "DUMP EVERYTHING INTO THE MAW INSTANTLY", this WOULDN'T have happened.
bring Arthas back !!!
My son. The day you were born, the very forests of Stormwind whispered the name, Anduin.
this story is second hand embarrassing
Didn't see this coming. Can't wait for Logash's appearence.
Are we seriously going to try to redeem Sylvanas? She genocided an entire city and destroyed the only thing keeping the Scourge in check.
meanwhile and for months now, Genn Greymane being useless idly in stormwind rofl
she get convoked.
The maw is boring
welp that the difference between mortals & us
Three rulers now remain... Three lies he will offer them... Three keys he will secure for the Jailer...
so any updates on pvp? or just this?
shalamourne was far better than "kingsmourne"
There is one who might be able to save Anduin, his father Varian! He has to be somewhere in the Shadowlands, so if we find him, only then can the present king of the Alliance be saved!
Why no more character customization?  Bl(ie)zzard
Yep, now he resembles Varian even more Blizzard, either change his parentage or don't make such resemblance for no reason.
Why no class tier sets you liars?
Hey, he killed the Archon!  Anyone's going to try to stop him on the way out?  No? He just leaves then huh?  Alright then...  WoW Storytelling everybody 2021! lol
BRING VARIAN BACK PLSSSS
THIGHS
Why is this game still going
Tf is this, yall like this?
Maw and Thorgast is worts content you gived us, why do you bother with us again
Winter queen solo
Anduin learned that jump from Grommash Hellscream
From being that kid standing next to Bolvar to stabbing the Archon.
Ima need the music to this cinematic PLEASE
It's scary how many people are dwelling on the past, unable to see the present.
We all knew that this would happen. Sooner or later. But it seems that Uther knew.
recycle content lol
Such incredibly bad writing.
Archoooon lady....just...move your arms to the side. You know, redirect his attack.  You've lived for eons yet never took one martial arts class? -_-
So Anduin was forced by his guild to reroll dk
They need more key Denathrius and Winter Queen and the green lady.
🐼
Wait, the Kyrians just let him walk away after this? lol
That hot second where uther was going to pledge his heart to his cleansed king, then felt the scar, and realized it wasn't Arthas in 2 seconds. Omg blizz art team. So much emotion. This is amazing.
If only the game was that pretty.
The jailer and the archon  are brother and sister Welp we know who call on this one  Jerry springer it’s your time
Comment for the algorithm
Sylvanas is definitely regretting what she has done 😭
Where is the actual story? All we’ve been given are snippets of the big picture and no build-up. Uther has pretty much been non-existent.
Man the look on Anduin's eyes when he realise what he did nnggh... my King come back to us!
1:19 - Uther realizing hes going to be sealed indefinitely inside Activision-Blizzard's storage room never to be seen or heard from again while another, well-loved blizzard character passes by him to be used for another plot device and inevitably suffer the same fate.
So does this confirm that the rune carver isn’t the primus?  If he was then there wouldn’t be 3 more keys to collect, they’d already have 2.
Remember Tyrande is still out there somewhere....
garrosh predicted this "what difference is there between you and the lich king now?
Nooo Anduin was too naïve to be Arthas++ 2.1
Cringe overload
2:12, the arthas really came out in that No
Yay, more recycled ideas!  This expansion should of been Lich King 2.0 instead of Shadowlands lol
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you❤️ Never give up on your life! 🙏🏼
Just when you think it can't get worse, it does.
Uther experienced some *spicy* deja vu
OMG, He possessed him!
Lich King 4.0
blizzard writers getting lazy
It feels weird seeing Sylvanas and Anduin side by side
Archon is the enemy. She bound her own brother, The Jailor
Jailer's voice is so awesome...
-what is this? what are you doing mortal? agreed!
huh so another arthas
No me la arcontes
Anduin one shots the archon lol
When is bald man gonna see this
First Krexus and now the Archon, eh?
Wrath of the Death King
The lore is impossible to follow lol
Pathetic...
So you run out of ideas and bring back arthas
Alright, I've had enough
So when does it come out
Arthas 2.0
🐥😈👻👍🏻
arthas it's you?
Arthas will save Anduin!
Arthas soul is in Anduin body. That's why he is bound to the jailer. That's why Uther sensed him.
all of these became meaningless when there isn't an asmonbald reaction video
Seems like Sylvanas will change teams pretty soon.
not digging how much they've warped and picked apart the original lore.
Who is that people who like this video?
Did no one else notice when the jailer spoke through Anduin and said “bound your brother”??? Archon and the Jailer are siblings.
Calling it now, Sylvanas will break the jailers hold of Anduin
I'd love to see him try that in Maldraxus with Alexandros Mograine around...
So... Barbie is the new Lich King... hmm
Why so many dislikes?
Do they want to make from anduin an raven of wow type of character?
What are you doing step Arthas?
I'm so glad to see Uther in the trailer! It was exciting and amazing!
The Jailer said he needed three more keys, how is he going to get the key of Denathrius if we already killed him?
Uthers face says it all, the animation was amazing
So, are you Sylvannas fanboys still gonna hold to that morally grey arguement since she pouty pout pouts while committing atrocities?  Or can we just give that genocidal traitor the axe and move on?
Think it's a pretty shait move from you to let one guy have full set of legendaries while the rest of us are limited to just one! common what is this favoritism?
Arthas father of Anduin confirmed?
Anduin rerolled DK
They should show Jaina's and Wrathion's reaction to this... xD
Arthas must Revive. And must be King Again.
Arthas is back!!!!!
Activision 👎
Anduin is the second coming of Arthas.
"THIS ENTIRE BASTION MUST BE PURGED!"
Arthas: Killed Sylvanas and forced her to serve the scourge against her will for their lord. Sylvanas: Converted Anduin to serve the maw against his will for her lord.  Just in this case, the Jailer has no more use for Sylvanas.
And just like the High Elves falling, it's up to the goodly Dark Elves (Winterqueen) to save things.
What about warcraft 3 reforged?? Another arthas is created by blizzard, good job guys.. Another year yet another ridicules idea, keep up the "good" work..
What could the winter queen do.. don’t make me wait for 9.2 xD
Well that Aspirant's getting fired
arthas 2.0  how very original......
Lovin the new look Andy, is it new? Oh wait. no not really.  Looks like joining Bastion is sort of pointless now.
We get to fight Silvanas. Finally.
So Anduin is the lich king now?
Good now redeem Arthas by using him to bring Anduin back to the light !
2:41 your face after seen this
Why the Archon died so easily?
wow this was worse than Soulfang cinematic....
Is Anduin an undead death knight now, or is he still alive and just controlled by Sylvanas?
this kind of reminds of diablo 3 act 4 intro
Why sylvanas couldn't do the job again?
"One who would give anything to serve his people" *Arthas flashbacks*
So, when does the patch hit live servers?
That was predictable plottwist ... for me its just like recycling old story , not cool
xxXDarKAnDuinxXx has entered the chat
Sylvanis: I'm going to do this to you now, but I'm going to need your help becoming the new Jailer later.
Anduin lost his ponytail. Confirmed - with every Jailor puppeting ritual, hairline recedes
# DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC
My Kyrian mommy NOOOOOOOO
There goes my weapons of order 🤦‍♂️
Now we really have to see Varian coming back. Hopefully not for no king rules forever my son part though.
nice
Massively pleased by this cinematic, and really all the updates to wow coming in 9.1, very promising, great job all around i'd say
Did they just...get rid of Anduin's ponytail during the transformation and use this opportunity to update it lol
Love uthers salute :3
So from Anduin to Manduin now to Damnduin😐
Ah, yes, the “Alliance redemption arc” we were promised
Holy sheet....
Arthas 2.0 real original
oh no anduin's rude now
Whoever is writing the „fight“ scenes in the last few cinematics appears to only have watched 70s mafia movies. Noone does anything, they just take it and die. Not how i‘d imagine the archon to be portrayed.
Been parallels between anduin and arthas for quite some time now.. BFA was riddled with them, especially 8n lorderon
Reminder that since Varian is disenchanted, his dust could be used to enchant Anduin's sword.
2:30  Ok ok, hear me out...why he looks so similiar to Arthas?   Can Arthas really can be his true father? :think:
Anduin became somewhat similiar to Arthas, Arthas being controlled by Nerzhul and now Anduin by Zooval
Its surface blazes bright. Masking shadows below...
Anduin did nothing wrong
Talk about history repeating itself...
Yeah wow is over.
why 1k dislikes?
Flying mounts!
Windrunner doubt
no1 mentioning the regret in sylvanas eyes when she saw anduin near the end.... there might be hope for her yet !
Mistress Archon nuuuuuuuuuuuu 😭
I'm not really excited for this so far...
Anduim: FOR THE ALLIAN...Ohhh, wait, I'm the Jailer's vessel now...FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF THEM ...THAT IMPRISONED MY MASTER 😡
Why?
My son. The day you were born, the very forests of Elwynn whispered the name, Anduin.
Dkarthasanduin has come online.
If only she had wings or something to fly away/dodge.
Uther should've spoken up
COVID 19 Anduin.
why would you call him Arthas 2.0? Completely different things happened - Arthas decided to get this, Anduin had no choice.
Worst cinematic ever made, totally random and unexplained 🤣🤣
Kyrestia : What are you doing anduin? Anduin   : "Succeeding you, Archon"
Hmmmm Warcraft 3 with an new intro and outro and somewhat polishing, remodeling.
“Right now you hold all the power.... Make your choice, sylvanas windrunner”
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!
Cringe. Stop recycling your own content, Blizzard.
This cinematic was disappointing, so many questions - how did Sylvannas finally manage to turn Anduin? How did they all transition from the maw to the Kyrian's and why is Uther being marched around there?
Anduin?
Meanwhile in Stormwind:  *SYLVANAAAS*
Are we STILL sure he's Varian's son...
Dont tell me that Sylvannas would do the Kerrigan arc. Too predictable blizz.
Nobody *Blizzard:* Patch 9.1.0:  Kyrian: removed from the game
Lich King: Anduin Edition
I’m surprised it wasn’t time gated! Half now and half in 2 weeks
Артес когда появится?!?!?!
Artes?!?!?!
Omg 🥺
So how he left the maw
Varian Wrynn: No king rules forever, my son.
Well winter queen is the last one still alive
Unoriginal
oh man he's edgy now!
Uuuuffffff this tea is HOT! 🐸
That bit of anduin coming back for few second says so much of how likely arthas was like . The moment he gave up his body it was over.
Creatively bakrupt.
Why were they leading Uther? The Archon downgraded him because of the Arthas incident?
So..... itis true. Lich King. Wait was THAT maldraxxus!?!??
Lol little hindy company have no money for normal cinematic
Uther is going to save anduin, his redemption arc for not being able to save arthas.
Blizzard writing facts check:  - big powerful characters are mostly useless; check - the most valiant heroes souls of all living worlds are useless; check
Sylvanas = garrosh 2.0 and now anduin = Arthas 2.0
Bwonsamdii do not take me yet
that's cool and all, but where is the solo que?
So they DID call it Kingsmourne!!
Anduin Menethil confirmed?
Meh nothing really excites me
Oh it's rehashed Arthas
Cringe.
The alliance has pain xD !!! Nobody blames the horde !!
my guess is that what queen azshara did whit n'zoth,its what anduin and silvannas will do whit the jailer
This new Warcraft 3 remaster trailer seems okay.
Tha Maw awaits no, thank you
3:17 that regret and realization on Sylvanas' face is beautiful. The ranger general will redeem herself.
Wasn't Bastion bound to Archon? It didn't disappear. And how did Anduin leave Bastion alive?
the puns in the comments section are better than actual video
Garrosh warned us
Chinese Arthas
meh ...
Like a B movie😃
Omg this is so EPIC
3:17 hey there, ya dumb elf, feeling some regret there?
The kyrians really did bring this upon themselves tho
Sylvanas did nothing wrong!
"Maybe the Winter Queen could..."  WHAT? MAYBE THE WINTER QUEEN COULD WHAT?!
Garrosh 2.0, Arthas 2.0  .... like is there any originality left in blizzard's offices?
*Mom come pick me up I'm scared*
Blizzard! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Arthas, to Blizzard: "So, you couldn't live with your failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me."
How about fixing the the bot problem we are all having in wow its completely destroying the game
Just wondering, when all the characters will have known, that if solo man comes to an army to ask something, it's better to give it to him.
Like, if you're waiting him to create The Lich boysband with Arthas
Hmmm, what gets me is the word “brother.”   I’m still suspecting that The Jailer is the jailer of Zovaal and not Zovaal himself.
Just when you think the story couldn't get worse Blizzard comes along and proves otherwise.
Gen Greymane aged 20 years watching this cinematic...
Wait until Arthas hears of this!
Arthas 2.0
The World calls upon me once again
ok so night fae need to safeguard the winter queen, venthyr and nerolords need to find where the primus and Denathrius kept their keys and kyrian need to heal the archon (if she is still alive, could go either way imo) and someone needs to figure out how to get the sword away from anduin. all and all fight to the last, live with honor die with glory loktar'ogar FOR THE HORDE!!!!
wrath of the lick boi
When Anduin handed the jailer the key, the look sylvanas gave him was almost like she felt bad
He destroyed my home, murdered my people and my king... and now murdered my archon!
thanks but no
да здравствует король!
LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO MY BOY
Arthas can still be redeemed for sure
*sigh* plot armor thick this one is...
That Uther scene did hurt my heart :(
Anduin Menethil
😱 Sylvanas will save us all
Anduin in is gone. There is only... Edgeduin
Boring self-repeat
100% arthas
Anduin is still in there.
Why can the Archon just choke Anduin like every Kyrian did to players, he just jumping right into her
Shalamourne sounds better than Kingsmourne
Wow
We shall avenge you Anduin! We swear it!✊
Uther hearth broked
You are *not* my king, yet, boy.
who hates uther this much he’s torturing him like this...... please
History is repeating by itself, and the one who is always there to witness it... Sylvanas Windrunner. Perhaps she is the game changer? If it is true and she succeed in doing her part, she might loses her plot armor.
NOT MY ANDUIN!!!  WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM!!! NOOOOOO!!!!
The Varian stabbing maneuver! Never fails.
Apple does not fall far from the tree
It's going to be rather disappointing when the Jailer loses.
Let's talking about Anduin's reaction after the sword is driven through. What does it mean?
You know Blizzard ran out of ideas when they are literally just reusing the same kind of Arthas story again
his father saved hundreds of life using that leap, but andiun...
Very creative & genuine, not.
*sighs* oh brother
Anduin :(
BadComedian - DOMINATE!)
this story is so bad XD
That's what the Archon get for stuffing grey items in our tributes.
Anduin then: Don't fight we need peace for all faction and race Anduin now: geneva convention? More like geneva suggestion
Anduin: - Blond - Royalty - Paladin  Sylvanas: Nope, not ringing any bells.  - Grey armor, silver hair, glowy blue sword  Sylvanas: Oh, SHI-
Uther's wound hurt when he walked past Anduin, it was the Jailer's power
Three keys remain? Is the Primus alive somewhere??
and he just left? what the literally army of kirian that where there doing?
Hold on, she still moved after he pulled the blade out.  So... Maybe she could still be alive, she just lost some kind of domain power of Bastion. 😥😢  Idk how life, death, and killing things work for those "living" in the Shadowlands. 😑
When Uther see's Aduwin. Bro....
Full circle.  Blizz turning blondies into death knights.
Now Anduin is awesome
PLZ no redepmtion for that banshee.
When you realized blizz ran out of ideas and used that same Wrathion stabbing scene...
Meanwhile...in Revendreth...Theotar: It's Tea Time!
"boss" level means nothing in cinematics. One shotted lol
Not one owl thingy helped
小狮子惨遭毒手了啊
chainduin
Archon: "Greetings King Anduin, how fares your noble father?" Anduin: stabs Archon in the chest.
Uther's "Harry Potter" moment.
Greymane must be disappointed in himself. He let Anduin get captured. Sadge
The new bitchking
Oh nice! Arthas 2.0 and sylvannas redemption, thank you blizzard very cool.
"Kingsmourne", more like "Recyclemourne"!   I'll see myself out...
Thats what kyrians get for killing off best girl Devos
Anduin Wrynn, Lich Kid
Best moment is when the Archon died <3 hopefully a dude takes her place next if anyone. Shit like this would have never happened.
Really? You're going to call it Kingsmourne, and not Shalamourne?
looks like history did repeat itself🧐
UTHER: (senses danger) GUARD: (shoves him onward) UTHER "Man, what the .... ayt, fine, see what happens, jeez."
Five key to open the way
Oh man, the Archon was so hot :(
Three more...... That make me wonder if that runecarver is really primus
Guys go play wotlk, what are you doing
Remember when WoW actually had good writing?
Great Value Arthas
the way shyvana look to anduin and jailer probably will betrayal him and will save anduin..... hmmm
Dude just walk in and walk out like that, Blizz story telling is on point.
Omg we need to protect the winter queen 😨
Lichking 2 electric boogaloo
not very original but lets see where this goes
WoW cinematics always push the boundaries on cringeyness. Can the writing possibly get more cliched?
Ironic how Sylvanis helped to create another Arthas
Is Bastion destroyed?
ANDY!!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
stop re-treading old content. if you wanted to bring arthas back, bring HIM back and not this.
BAD BOI
Aaaaaaan now we're killing the Lich 3.0
Sylvanas's face looks full of remorse 😧🥺
World of Warcraft: Infinity War
It was during server maintenance 😅😅
Time to get Garrosh back. He broke that boy once before, he can do it again!
how original blizzard.
Sylvanas is NOT happy about this.
Looks like they finally revealed why his hair was white in Son of the Wolf comic back in Legion.
Lich King 2.0!! Let’s GOOOO
Is this "jailor" supposed to be Ner'zul?
Uther said:  👁👄👁
Hey Variann come on and impose order with your child
hopefully wont still be getting one shotted when this comes out
Amazing how Anduin was hinted with walk animations and camera angles similar to Arthas's in previous cutscenes. You can notice that in the cutscene when Anduin took back Lorederan.
Archon: " What is this? What are you doing my brother? Manduin(Jailer): "succeeding you sister!"
everyone in comments: "reminds me of arthas..." thats the point
Great.  Arthas 2.0
boring, basic writing.
2:50 Anduin's post nut clarity
The time has come...     "WHY ITS CALLED INVISIBLE IF WE CAN SEE IT?"
History repeats itself once again
Blizzard is the king of Recycling
oh look, arthas 2.0
it's called "Kingsmourne"? oh cmon, we were ALL hoping for "Shalamourne"
slyvannas save him!
Pretty cringe, ngl
does anyone else think the eyes on anduin and uther are weird??
Okay so he kills Kyrestia after chaining those Kyrian up then just...walks out? Okay.
Genn out here losing ANOTHER son to Sylvanas
any warcraft 3 vibes when arthas killes his dad?
warcraft writers omegalul
2:32 King Varian Wrynn strike the Reaver .
SYLVANAS did nothing wrong
They borrowed some of that Diablo 3 scene with Imperius and Diablo.
Sylvannas is gonna sacrifice herself for the greater good just calling it.
Sylvanas will save us all!
todo muy lindo piter pero cuando sale ?
does it come with 30 anima?
This was flawless, amazing animation and story
Is this really happening again?
And with that, I'm officially done. Aight guys, bye. xD
I'm thinking Arthas' soul is inside anduin
They're foreshadowing arthas' return sooo much xD
Always knew since launch the archon was weak
NOOooo Audiun!
Wait till king varian hears about this. Someones gonna be in trouble
Guys Next expansion will be Deathwing 2.0  dont worry and Next Panda
Серьезно? Вот так легко ? ясно
booooriiiing
Super disappointing lore in this expansion...
are people really thinking this is good story writing? it gets only worse lol
Oh look, another story line retread ...
Epic
so no release date huh.
Since Arthas was the last effective villain in recent WoW lore, they now desperately try to stand on his shoulders and create a 2.0 of him.
And no one questioned how Anduin just escaped the maw all alone?
So Anduin changes his class to DK too?
My thoughts: - Anduin is soulbinded with Arthas - when killing Sylvanas, her last words will describe details of Jailer's plans - thanks to this we will save the Runecarver (who is the Primus or the real Jailer) - we will have so very little time to stop the Jailer's destorying machine  - Runeracver will slow him down by chaining him in chains - we will find new allies in other forgoten Shadowlands  - they, together with Runecarver and Winter Queen will find the way to destroy Jailer - unfortunately Anduin will be lost - in fight with his soulbind Arthas and this will be the nail in the Jailer's coffin
This is awesome!!!
:(
PROTECT YOUR QUEEN!  For Queen and Grove
Welcome the new Lich King !
Straight up pulling dimensions into the Maw. ESO players thinking back to the Planemeld and Molag Bal.
Is it me or the "Archon" leader of BASTION is pretty useless...
Bored already.
Ummm is it me or is there the look of conflict in sylvanas's eyes.
Confirmed
a b u r r i d o
Why must you hurt me this way
Good think we've been grinding renown to get the Hand of the Archon title just in time for her to die....
So Anduin just walked back to the maw through the main forces of Bastion after doing this?
BADDDD
Is this an out of season April Fool's joke?
Sylvanas looked him like "this is kinda hot, too bad nathanos is my man"
They really going to call it Kingsmourne
not the goodest boyo
Leave my Winter Queen alone.
Predictable!!! BAD BLIZZARD! Zombie Anduin is not cool enough... it doesn't pay off.
Doesn’t this contradict him getting rescued?
Hmm don't see blizzard fans complaining about something. World must be coming to an end.
Deaduin.
Lich king 3.0
Own brother ???
Do it blizz Save sylvanas again Boring...
Terenas Menethil: First time ?
LICH KING 2.0 LOOOOOL
you can see the regret in Sylvanas's eyes
no big deal let me just walk past all the player base and slay the bastion leader.  Not like the player base has been working with Bolvar to try and save you from the maw / torghast or anything.  Story doesn't make sense...
Ppc
Release dateee
imitations glorify the original always arthas
Like father, like son?
No, Blizzard. No.
Kyrians really just feel like the punching bags of the whole expansion.
Booooo
Ridiculous. Boring, repetitive story. Someone doesn't have to be turned bad to be interesting character.
Loooooool
In THIS episode of recycling-
So...the memes were right?
Calling it now, Uther's arc will end with him becoming the new Archon
And here comes the bald one to reaction
MY SON THE DAY YOU WHERE BORN THE VERY FOREST OF ELWYNN WISPERED THE NAME....  ANDUIN
*Shalomorn thirsts for blood*
Well that happend
So Jailer wants 4 covenant leader's souls? If so why he didn't take Denathrius soul? He would have now already 2 of 4.
We must save the king!
Kerrigan Windrunner.
Fix MC bug
I'm sure his mom cheated on Varian... with Arthas.
Man.... Varian will be very disappointed of his son when we finally meet him
She has some terrible reflexes...
Let's not rush to conclusions. We don't know if she died or not. It's clear sylvanas is regretting her choice in partners once more and will soon turn against the jailer.
Diablo 3 vibe.
Uther will be like: oooooh no, anyways
yay the maw.
Poor anduin
Man they really slaughtered my boy, Anduin. :((
Awesome
Anduin my son
Oh who would think that could happen this is SO UNEXPECTED AND SHOCKING!!!!!     Literally no one
Is it just me, or are the Eternal Ones kind of.....useless?
“One who will give anything to serve his people” ARTHAS SOUL SHARD IN THE BLADE! UTHER REACTS TO THE BLADE!
WoW
Sylvanas vs Anduin ?
Winter queen is next, the tree will burn... we’re FOOKED!
shadowreaper anduin
2:48 this isn`t look of person whose act is his own will.Jailer mind controlling Anduin.King Anduin is not Arthas 2.0
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!
Wow you just made Anduin the new Arthas. You appeal to the 100 year olds who played wrath of the lich king instead of making something good and new
That was very sad.😓
Sylvanas looks sad to see what happened with Anduin. She will save us all!
Father's legacy
YESSSS
is there some what connection with Sylvanas and Auduin?  Shes looking like shes thinking about what he said...
My jaw dropped.. this is insane.
So if Manduin was his rise what's his fall? do we can him Villianduin? Evilduin? Slavuin? Arthuin? Mournduin? Diabluin? Vilduin? SInduin? Valerian?
Wait, who's the Archon's brother!?
You can just tell that Sylvanas doesn't like this.
im crying because of Anduin
Archon: This is blasphemy,  this is madness!!  Uther: THIS IS ARTHAS!!!  Anduin: (whispers Uther) Anduin... my name is Anduin!
Jaina has left the chat
Bruh they literally remaking the biggest enemy's now
Next expansion "Fall of the Chain King"
King  Varian is going to be so mad!
Emo Anduin... just give me arthas.
Arthas 2.0...
Pog
No king rules forever, my son.
He killed her the same way Grom killed Mannoroth in the wod cinematic, that means like Grom, Anduin will be redeemed
FINALLY CRY-DUIN IS GONE MANDUIN IS HERE
the writing gets worse and worse... and worse...
Garbage...
Genn: Anduin the Jailer is evil!  Anduin: From my point of view the Alliance are evil!
Friendly reminder that Anduin Wrynn is canonically 20 years old
Instead of cinematics you should focus on fixing pvp blizzard and remove the oneshot buttons like convoke, combust, the hunt and others
Uncle Garrosh where are you ?
But he is still somehow good
Beautiful
ANGEL-MOMMY!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!
The Archon let's herself get killed just like that. Rather sad.
Arthas did it better.
'Arthanduin' is unleashed!!!
RIP Archon, you did absolutely nothing but be wrong about almost everything all expansion. Uther should of gone in on Anduin once he felt something was up.
And let me guess  Varian will show out of nowhere and by chant and magic wand his son will regain his sanity and fight back.  Clap
Like father like son....I've tinfoil hat theorized that Anduin is secretly Arthas's son for years.....and here we are.
Winter is coming...  ...to an end.
Blue Angel Mommy! Nooooooooo!!!
Why is it that the light always falls to dum stuff and they can’t fight back and how is it that the archon known that it’s the jailer talk and she not fast or strong enough to do something or then just sit there and die😡
SYLVANAS!!!🤬
Same scene when Arthas killed he's father...pathetic... Welcome to new Blizzard Entertainment when they bring back their old games because they run out of ideas... every good men left the company...
Arthas Wrynn? xD
Anduin is just being mind controlled by the jailer
NOOOOAOOOOOO00OO0O ANDUINNNNNNNNN MY BABY BOYUYYYYYYYY
2:22 stabbed the ground just like Arthas did in the WotLK trailer
WHY MY COVENANT?
FINNALLYYYY LET THEM ALL DIE!!!
Mawduin
winter queen, you're in danger girl
What you did to my boi :(
So rumors about WoW story being written by a 9 years old kid were true...
M e h.
Oh come on!
He was made to be serve.
same ideas over and over again : <
Of course the kyrian die first lets see what happens when he gets to true warriors like the venthyr
Anduin and Sylvanas... New king and queen of the horde
3 keys remain??
SYLVANAS WILL SAVE US , AND WE WILL FORGIVE HER , CALLING IT NOW.
Frozen Throne/Wrath 2.0
*SYLVANASSSSSS!!!!!!!!!*
Not anduin

Another retcon, eh?
Anduin seriously just pulled an Arya
Baduin hit 100.000k critical dmg

How uther looks to anduin, arthas vibes.
Archon Dies or just badly hurt?
ARTHAS 2.0

once the jailer has all the keys, he will snap his fingers and call it... mercy
Bruh...
oh yes, deathwing coming back in action...
Good work, Jailer. Thank you.

Really riding on Arthas' coat-tails, aren't they?
Oh. My. God.
"Succeeding you, Archon..."
-what is this? what are you doing mortal? -succeeding you Archon
The Licher King!
Did the archon die??
Not Anduin...
Mark my words sylvanas will sacrifice herself to save her little lion
Uther could sense the jailer within Anduin!
3:18
I'm sorry, but if they redeem Sylvanas I'm done...
Uther when he learns the news: "oh no, not again..."
That Jailer voice my gooood.
nice touch with Uther there and the call-back to Arthas' resurrection of Sindragosa.
Eclaté au sol
NOOOO MY ARCHON. Why Blizz. :C
Imagine if it's revealed Anduin is Arthas and Jaina's son
The vassel is arthas becuse when urther pass anduin his wound heart and reminded her death by arthas
Devos: *Maniac Laughter*
Jailer is showing favoritism.
Well didn't see the Archon part coming.
Nope. I'm out. Bye Wow been nice playing
Poor Archon, I'm worried for Ardenweald and the Winter Queen now
NOOOOOOOO, NOT THE ARCHON!!!!!
Jesus.
The dude that designed anduins gear. Plzz make him head DK designer hahaha.
There was no way for Anduin to be cool without being mind controlled already.
So the jailer need someone with greater afinity with Light to possuied? Like Arthas and Anduin?
Now that's my boy!
QUE PASO PA SE PICO ?
"Five keys to open our way..."
Your own Brother!
Are you guys going to put out more actual cinematics like BFA???
Rip archon... Kyrian simps we've been done dirty
Why does this look so childish?
Did uther feel smth was wrong with Anduin? The way he lookt and then holded on the scar?
Yaaaay, it's getting worse. Let's reheart another topic that people liked and CREATE SECOND ARTHAS because we don't want to come up with anything new.
AN KARANIR THANAGOR ANDUIN
Anduin... No, please wake up..

OMG MAN  LETS  GOO

this is real HYPE
3:17 Sylvanas: "Maybe this wasn't a good idea after all."
here comes Arthas V2
The call backs to the original Arthas warcraft cinematic were perfectly done. Still, oof. Poor archon and anduin.
Anduin for the first time was the coolest guy in wow
Arthas 2.0
No This can’t be true This is Impossible! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
He looks like Arthas and cinematic looks like cinematic from end of human campaign in Warcraft 3
MY ARCHON NOOOO!!!
BUTTONS
this game really is just gonna keep going in circles forever, huh?
all the players that stand around that area and not one stopped this..... lol
hey look, it's bad-uin!
The jailor said he needed three more keys, meaning the primus still have his key hidden
Tuvok...is that yooou?
ARTHAS 2.O  OMG
