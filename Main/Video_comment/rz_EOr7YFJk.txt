We love you girl
I’m fuming that people are so damn mean!! I’m with they would just let you live your life and I’m also upset he posted the story the time you were going through all of this. What an inconsiderate jerk. You worry about being healthy love and live your best life. I loved watching you and you have so much class. His loss
Sending you strength 🌼🌼🌼
You are so much pretty . I thought it was natural, and it doesn't appear as sth strange. Ppl are amazing to alert u, btw.. I take levythroxine as my thyroid isn't functioning well. Guess u will take it too, and it works
Sorry about your situation But From what I understand this is common
Wishing you the very best hunni, stay strong xx
Is there a update on this was the lump cancerous ? ❤
All the best sweetheart ❤️
Have you had any news yet beautiful 💗💗
Just watched the series,,, hope all the best for you ❤️
Sorry you are going through this! But you will come out the other side. It’s just a blip in your life. Also just remember if anyone says nasty stuff it’s only because they are jealous of you! ❤
Bless you sweetheart your a gorgeous person i’m praying for you🥰🙏xxxx
I believe everything happens for a reason, love island must have been the pathway to getting this sorted for you. You'll be so much stronger after all of this! Sending best wishes, thank you for sharing your journey! ❤
I had my whole thyroid out bc I had cancer stage 4. One of the easiest surgeries I’ve went through. You’ve got this!
When I was 13 I first noticed a large lump at the right side of my neck. It wasn’t until I was 19 that I was diagnosed. I had a full thyroidectomy with 16 lymph nodes removed. My scar is from my left collar bone up to my right ear. I had one, possibly two parathyroids removed during a five and a half hour surgery. I also had a week of radioactive iodine. Hope things go ok for you xx
Sending you all the love and prayers girl ❤🙏🏽
Samie. My mom, aunt, and grandma all went through this same thing. When my mom was diagnosed I was only 11 so as a child hearing the C-word as you said was scary. But I saw the support system my mom had and it was just great to see that a village truly makes you feel stronger, to later be that same system for my aunt and grandma. This will be a scary process but trust yourself and the choices you make for you. There is no wrong choice if you feel you went with YOUR best option. Love you samie🤍
Samie I want to tell you, you're so loved by God. The Lord Jesus Christ can walk with you through this. He wants to show you He cares and is your Saviour. He can heal anything. His promises in the bible are true and have power to heal. God your Father will always be here for you. You aren't alone. I am praying for your healing x
Beautiful inside & out 🤞🤞 with lots of support from family & friends you’ll get there x😍xx
You are so strong and you are an inspiration to your fans and everyone else around you💗❤️🫶🏽
Hugs Sami!.. everything will be fine!. Take care!!❤
You will be fine beautiful girl , health is everything in life, you are so brave sharing this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️

samie i legit love you sooooo much hope you have a lovely day
You got this, keep being you and never change. Ignore the hate, life is too short❤️❤️
Stay strong girl! U got this, we are all here with you for support!! ❤️x if Tom posted your break up whilst u were in for tests then he’s the bad one for being insensitive of the timing!! Shame on him! 😢
I'm sorry to hear this. My dad is nearly 70 he had it when he was 44. Stay strong, sending love ❤️
My.mum had this...for years and years...getting it checked regularly.  Biopsy was might be cancer might not be. After a lot of stress, my.mum decided to have it Completely removed...to be on safe side. Turned out it was cancerous.  She recovered fine and is doing great. 20yrs on. She had radiation exposure to her thyroid as a child ...so it caused the cancer
You're the prettiest to have ever gone in ❤ Island I think - good luck 🤞 & well done to all your fans who clocked it
❤❤🙏🙏🙏
♥️
I know it’s scary but I had the same looking lump and it was a cyst, I hope yours will be the same. Hang in there Sammie! thank god your followers noticed!!!!!!❤

You’re so brave. Just want to give you a big cuddle. ❤
Sending  you so much love ❤️
Stay Strong ignore any negativity x
because u needed time sammie dont explain urself its in ur own time focus on brand deals n stuff for u now x
sending love your way. stay strong sami ❤  you’re an angel
the way that you've put your most vulnerable self out there to talk about your health when you've not even processed it yet yourself, and also have felt the pressure from the hateful messages of others about your breakup so you've had to address that as well whilst also probably still not processing that yet either just shows how much strength you hold within you girl.  I don't have any useful advice to offer with the thyroid/lump other than be patient with yourself, your health comes first always, and surrounding yourself with people who are going to uplift you & encourage positivity is so important. i'm hoping that everything goes well for you in the coming weeks with your surgery - you've got this angel 🤍
❤♥

Hi Sammie! You are so brave for posting this. Sending you love and support ❤
Hi girl, I’m 29 and I had some lumps. They removed one of them and I got diagnosed with lymphoma cancer on january 4th this year. Always check your lumps, that’s what I would like to say to everyone ❤
Stay strong girl  💪! ❤ you’ll be absolutely fine 🍀☀️🙏💕
Lmao the brittish accent  💀
Synthroid lifer myself.  Godspeed. You've got this.
This is crazy I’m in the exact same situation you are in with the lump on your neck I got my biopsy next week hopefully we’re both good praying for you sis glad you spoke on this topic
Love and hugs to you Samie ❤
The bravery you have to share this with everyone should show you how strong you are, you’ve got this and we love you🤍 xx

Sending love to you Samie ❤
🤍🤍🤍
Come on now it was fake as fuck bffr you gameplayer you didn’t fool anyone
I feel for you, being pressured into having to put this out so soon after only just getting your head around it yourself. Social media can be both a blessing and a curse at times. Stay strong and wishing you a speedy recovery Xxx
Sending you love ❤ please only focus on your health xxx
Keep posting more chatty videos ❤❤
So sorry your facing these issues ❤ you should be very proud of yourself for having the courage to share your journey. You are as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside! Also thank you for raising awareness this prompted me to check myself too, Keep well 🥰x
PRAYING FOR YOU SAMIE🙏🏿❤️
🙏❤️
Please please look at the makeup, cosmetics,hair products including shampoo etc,Tan, lotion and anything you put onto your skin and perfume is the worst. They have so many chemicals that can cause hormone and thyroid problems. I’m not saying thats the cause of yours obviously as I’m not a doctor. But with younger and younger girls getting this and more makeup/products created and the pressure for them to wear makeup etc over the years I think it makes sense. Please look into it and wishing you all the best xx
You got this Sammi🙏❤
Sending you so much love and strength Samie 💕
People are do dam heartless ,  (Trolls) you never mind the world, huni you remember you. and you only,  take care, sweetheart & best of luck on your biopsy,it will okay hun,  thinking of you & take care of yourself ❤❤ big hugs  from me to you ❤🫂

Stay strong sammi. You will get thru this. ❤❤❤❤❤
Samie, you are fully allowed to be upset. It's a stressful thing. But you're handling it so well!!
Sending love. You are so brave❤
We love you!!! You’re amazing ❤

SAMIE ELESHI IS THE MOST BEAUTIFULL WOMAN EVER
I FANCY SAMIE
love you samie, you're a strong and beautiful girl 💖
I had a golf-ball size cyst removed from my neck when I was in my early 20s…. Fortunately after testing  it was non-cancerous. I remember ignoring this lump in my neck for years and finally a relative recommended I go to the doctors. Then 10 years later in 2014 - a massive keloid scar formed and grew- it was rather large - I got it removed in 2020 by wonderful doctors  at London -Kings Hospital Managing the op scar with silicone gel scar sheets which have flattened the scar. That’s where I’m at now and I’m 44 now. Thank you for spreading awareness on this. All the best to you ❤
Why am I getting recommended this narcissistic shit? 🗑️
Sending all my love and support to you! 🫂🫶🏿
Love you Samie, just know you’re not alone and that you’re a beautiful, strong, courageous woman and you should be so proud for being so honest and open! Don’t ever feel bad about not addressing things in your personal life, you don’t owe anyone anything 😘 xx
I’m 36 and found out I had an enlarged thyroid about 3 years ago because my DENTIST mentioned it. I never noticed. Thankfully my lesions are not growing, but I get it checked every year. Sending you healthy healing thoughts! Grateful for others catching it and you getting it taken care of!
You've got this you are stronger than you think and fingers crossed everything is okay xx
You are so strong Samie❤ WE LOVE YOU XX
It's scary, cry it out, thanks for sharing! Keep doing what you do girl!
Thank you for being so vulnerable and strong. You should be so proud for helping to raise awareness. Thinking of you🤍
You shouldn’t need to defend yourself about why you’re not addressing things or whatever, your health should be priority! You’re a strong girl and you can get through this💗
Going through a public breakup while also dealing with a potentially serious health problem is so overwhelming, I hope you are able to find moments of peace and relaxation throughout this process. Best of luck to you and I hope healing from your surgery goes well <3
You're amazing , it could be nothing xx praying for you ❤
Love you Samie, you're in my thoughts and prayers🫂❤
So so scary. Hoping all goes well and it isn’t anything 🤞🏼 You’re strong and you got this! So sorry all this crap is happening all at once 😢💕
🩷 my mum had thyroid cancer when I was younger, is now on thyroxine, happy & healthy! you’ve got this xx
Praying for you❤️
Wish you the best u have got this !!!!
Awe Samie your brave srong and a independent women you do whats right for you girl ☺caught it quick and keep your chin up sending positive vibes 💙💫🙏love and light
Sending love stay strong and good luck with the results ❤
Thank you samie for being so open and honest praying for you ❤️ u are one of my favourite people from love Island ❣️xxx
He cheated on you in the villa what did you expect or where you with him to attempt to win
Why does everyone from love island always pretend they are happy about the breakup and everything's cool and we don't have a bad word to say about the other person 🙄🙄🙄 stop the 🧢🙄🙄 everyone is so fake and media trained....I don't know how anyone can relate to these people
Sammie ur so beautiful hope everything goes well for you ❤❤
I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much of a gem you are to me. Your generous amount of vulnerability and authenticity is truly inspiring, and I am constantly amazed by your strength and resilience. You have faced many challenges with grace and courage, and I admire you for that.  I want you to know that I am praying for you to have peace and for your health. I know that the road ahead may not be easy, but please remember that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You are not alone in this journey, and I will be rooting for you till the end.  Thank you for being an inspiration to me and to so many others. Your kindness, compassion, and positive attitude are truly contagious, and I feel lucky to have you in my life. Please take care of yourself and know that you are loved. 🤍
Pray for full healing and peace during this difficult time .
<3 <3 <3
I found a lump, exactly the same as you in 2021.I went for tests, biopsy’s and the same mine was a grade 3.I know how scary it feels.But please be assured you’ll be ok and the relief is so great once it’s done.be kind to yourself once it’s done,as you’ll need to recover and blood tests to check your levels.I’m on thyroxine and feel so much better after mine then left me with an under active thyroid.you’ll be absolutely fine.the journey has its ups and downs but the relief after is worth it.
I had 3/4 of mine removed at 18.  I have taken thyroxine ever since.  It is a  auto immune disease.  I have no scar that is visible and it was a long time ago
So inspirational and so brave. The best think we all can do is speak about things like this❤
It just goes to show that you never know what someone is going through. It's great that you're spreading awareness - it's going to be okay 💗
Just wasn’t working literally told us nothing..that could mean Sooooooo many things so just pointless to tell us that
Wow Samie, your such a strong incredible woman, I hope your okay and it’s not cancer but if it is your so strong and will get through it. ❤
I’m praying for you Samie I love you 👑👑🙏🏽
Hey Samie your so strong and inspirational ❤

Yes I have a scar.. its getting better.. I'm well and I'm alive :) do not worry about a scar. U are beautiful for who u are and every1 who loves u will love u no matter what.. xxx
you’re so strong and I do wish u the best 🩷
Samie, I love you lots and lots. Was watching you from America and immediately fell in love with the person you are. I hope you’re doing ok. You’re going to get through this! You have an army routing and praying for you. Wish I could give you a big squeeze. Keep your chin up babe ❤
*Hugs* thanks for being so honest. I never imagined going on love island could save you from cancer, thank goodness you went on the show! Very scary, glad the Drs are looking after you.
Ahh Samie💔  I'm so sorry that you are going through this regarding your health.   But you will be absolutely!   Sending you so much love and healing energy.   Take each day and moment as it comes.   🤍
Good god Sammy I wish I could give you a MASSIVE cuddle !I hsve everything crossed for you darling Lots of love sent to you It must of been extremely hard to share but Thank YOU we are all here for you 💯❤️❤️❤️
Oh Sammy I'm so,so,sorry !It's such a,shame your both beautiful people I'm just sorry it didn't work ❤❤❤
So sorry to hear this gal ❤, sending lots of love you've got this!💪
You’re so strong! Sending you so much love right now girl❤‍🩹🙏
You're amazing, Sammie! Thank you for sharing the start of your journey. The human race can be so horrible and lack so much empathy. It is easy for women and men to jump on social media and throw accusations and hate towards others, and yet not fully understand any of the situation but are happy to have their 2 pence piece on the matter and not care what anyone is going through or what really happened. It is heartbreaking how the world is... But you are strong, and everything will be okay no matter the outcome of your results. You've GOT THIS! Lots of love and hugs to you girly! 🤍🤍
i was just watching your other videos including the one about your whole process of going on love island and how you believe in manifestation and how it played a role in all of it and i think it just comes to show that everything really does happen for a reason. maybe if you hadn’t gone on the show you wouldn’t have noticed the lump in your neck and yes maybe for now things with tom didn’t turn out how you though they would but i’m sure that your experience with him has also taught you a lot of new lessons that will help guide you down the next path. regardless of what happens next we’re all going to be here for you and we’re so excited to see what’s next :)❤
Sending you so much love Samie ❤
Don’t feel the need to share stuff u aren’t ready to share. You don’t owe anyone anything apart from yourself. If u wanna speak then do but don’t feel pressure. Sending you lots of love and wishing you well 💚💚💚
You are so beautiful and a little scar isn't going to change that, i had a cancerous lymph node removed on the side of my neck and yes i don't like my scar but it's saved my life. Fingers crossed yours isn't cancerous - Keep your chin up lovely ❤ Sending you lots of love and positive thoughts 🥰
I'm sorry to hear this wish you all the best and your in our thoughts and prayers.❤
Awwww…. Sweet, beautiful girl, I just want to jump into that car with you & give you the biggest hug! 🤗🤗🤗 I haven’t been through it but have several friends who have. You’ll be just fine & will have your family, friends & all of us to cheer you on. F*** the haters! Let your haters be your motivators! As for Tom, that sucks. I’m really sorry! However, you both are still so young that it might have been too much for you two to have “lived happily ever after” as you put it. You’ll meet the right one when you’re ready. The important thing is that you’re still friends. Cheer up, follow doctors’ orders, take good care of yourself & if you need to cry, just cry. Don’t stop yourself! It’s totally normal for you to feel everything you are feeling right now. Please do fill us in & update us on your  journey. Sending you love & healing vibes from across the pond in Atlanta, Georgia (USA) ❤️‍🩹😘🫶🏼
I have a lump that’s seems to be in the parathyroid area, been waiting 8 months for my appointment. Doesn’t look like it’s in the usual area but my body is telling me something isn’t quite right. I’ve had the same thoughts about the scaring and voice, very scary to think about. I totally understand what you’re going through, it will be a relief to get a proper diagnosis. Thanks for sharing this Sammie. Keep us updated, thinking of you! 💛
Samie sorry to hear all this. You incredibly strong and brave. Hopefully all goes well.
I’m a year post op and waiting to hear if I’ve got the all clear from Papillary Thyroid Cancer! You’ve got this girl ❤ any questions at all that anyone on this video might be experiencing the same I’m happy to answer x
Aww Samie so sorry to hear this 😢 but listen try not to think the worst you are a young beautiful girl & if all you have to deal with is a scar then so be it aslong as you are healthy! Of course it will be a worrying time for you but just try stay strong & I’m guessing you will have loads of support from your family & friends ❤ take care my lovely. Bugger what everyone else thinks just look after yourself ❤️✨ xx
Stay strong xx
You have inspired me so much I love your content carrying on going xx
Well done for speaking about it you probably feel better, feel like a weight has lifted off your shoulders.  It’s a bit harsh of Tom to talk about the split when he knew you were going through a rough patch.  Selfish if you ask me.  Go girl you’re strong good luck for surgery xx
Your so brave Sami to do this video. I pray things work out for you. I have just had spinal surgery they went in the front of my neck my scar is healing beautiful but I like you was distraught at the thought of surgery impact on my voice and scar etc. Your honesty is admirable take care Beautiful girl 💕
So proud of you hopefully everything will be ok keep strong ❤
Good luck Samie. Did not expect that when I clicked on this video. Well done for being brave and spreading awareness. One day at a time and you will get there ❤
I was diagnosed with Graves Disease (hyperthyroidism) in November, totally out of the blue. Started 12-18mnths of treatment. My thyroid is currently swollen, and may have to be removed. It's something I knew nothing about.  Carry on with the awareness, it's more common than people think. Take care of yourself and best wishes.
Samie, thank you for sharing this information, it will really help out alot of people. And I will keep you in my prayers. Hang in there Sam; you'll be alright❤
❤️
In’sha’Allah you’ll get through this Sammie. Your allowed to feel how u feel. Don’t feel pressure to post anything u don’t want to
I had my full thyroid removed 2 years ago because of an overactive thyroid. And honestly, I love my scar. It shows how brave I was and I take pride in myself for going through what I went through. So my advice to you, please be proud of yourself for being strong and show off your scar and share your story. Wishing you the best🩷
Big love girl! 💕
Girl your so absolutely gorgeous you can have any Man U want !!❤ I hope that’s not y you guys broke up he should be there 4 u .. I haven’t seen his response
O wow I so feel for u Sammie ur amazing and strong u have lots good friends family around to support you sending u a hug 💞💞
I'm currently waiting for a total thyroidectomy as I have nodules all over my thyroid. The reason I found out was because I was constantly feeling as if I was being choked, it's horrible. I have been waiting for nearly a year for the surgery but hopefully it won't be much longer. It is scary but hopefully all will be well.
Hi Samie. I'm 33 and had Thyroid Cancer at 23. I had some complications 2 years ago when they thought it had come back and had another surgery. Same as you I was feeling low and negative about the scar. But here and now I can tell you my scar is this little red mark that just tells a story. It's not ugly and it doesn't bother me. I can't sit here and tell you the journey will be a breeze. Your be nervous your be unsure alot of the time how your feel. But your absolutely get through the other side.  Don't you just feel like things happen for a reason? If you hadn't of gone on love island you would of had no idea.  Sending so much positivity through this journey ❤
You are so brave and strong and a wonderful role model for all! Xxx
My husband had this when he was in his 20’s (now 40) and it was spotted in a photo of him. He had his thyroid removed and some radiotherapy and he is all clear! He has to take thyroxine now every day and he has regular blood tests/check ups but apart from that you wouldn’t know at all, the incision was done on his neck crease so you can barely see it! Keep your chin up, you have caught it and that’s the main thing xx
Awww, Sammie, you are going to do wonderful. I'm glad you caught it now. I noticed it on many episodes, and I kept saying why one side of her neck thicker or bulged out. I tried to call love island producers. I think they thought I was crazy. My mother in law went through the same thing, and it was cancerous. She got it all out in surgery, then got the treatment, and then she was done and was great for years. Her scar is a quarter of an inch. She is in her 80s. Lol. I see you are very nervous and it is scary. But God got you. You're so beautiful, and you have a wonderful life ahead of you. I love you, honey.
Thinking of you 🤍 😢
Your so brave well done Sammie xx
sending you all the love and positivity in the world 🫶🏽
I had mine removed about 7 weeks ago. You will be fine ❤
So so proud of you keep being you and you look absolutely amazing 😍🥹❤️
Sending lots and lots of love ❤️❤️❤️xxx
So sorry your going through this. It's amazing that you've done this video 🥰stay strong beautiful lady 💖 x
Like you say ,your going to fine ,tuff girl ,and amazing woman xx
Stay strong you got this Sammy xx
Love love love you, you are so strong
Aw Samie I can feel the pain going through you right now it’s so shit I can relate 100% because for some reason when it bloody rains , it pours right ? But you  and I both will be absolutely fine as you said you’re a strong strong gal so no worries
Samie —  Life is not always sunshine and rainbows. I commend you SO MUCH for sharing your raw feelings and state of mind. Your health has to be absolute top priority, even above boys 😂 the entire world is your support system, I’m so sorry that there are people who send you hate. Clearly the haters have nothing else going on in their lives where the only thing they have to worry about is people that they don’t know.  Xoxoxoxo
Lots of love ❤❤❤❤
Sorry to hear this Samie, I’m here for you.
Aw my heart is breaking for you, watching this. I can’t imagine what you must be going through and that people could be judging you during a time like this. You’re so brave for sharing. Wishing you health and healing ❤
Nothing is more important thank your health. Prayers for you and thank you for being vulnerable and sharing so that other people can be on the look out. Using this platform for awareness is a very selfless thing to do.
Hi Sammi! I’m 25 and had my whole thyroid removed in November. I know it’s nerve wracking but once it’s over, it’s the best feeling to know it’s done. Synthroid WORKS. Your voice is going to be back in no time. My scar is already almost gone. You got this girl. Sending so so so much love. ❤
You’ll get through this❤
I was 26 when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It’s a long journey but you’ll get through it even stronger. Something I wish I knew earlier when going through this is to educate yourself as much as possible on all the hormones your thyroid supports, as your body changes after a thyroidectomy, even with the medication it’s not the same. Natural supplements like selenium & zinc are really great support for your body. Wishing you the very best on your journey - you’ve got this! Xx
I really hope it all turns out well for you, if you have had it for years logic would say that if it was the big C then it would have shown itself in other ways by now 🤷 Just food for thought, may reassure you maybe? Anyway I really wish you the best ❤
I found a lump in my breast a few months ago, upon going to the breast clinic and having an ultrasound they found 7 masses so they decided to take a biopsy and I am currently waiting to find out if it's bad news or not. I'm also 23, I can't even describe the anxiety I'm experiencing waiting to find out what it is. Statistically, it should't be anything sinister but it's not out of the realms of possibility so the wait is killing me. My point is, I'm essentially going through the same thing right now. The waiting is horrible and so anxiety inducing but you're not alone and this video helped me to feel less alone too. We never expect to find ourselves in a situation like this especially so young but I will be praying for you. Whatever happens you got this, you're an extremely resilient person.
Iv had the same thing, had a large lump on mine that caused all sorts of problems. I had it removed and felt so much better but it’s a ongoing thing you have to stay so aware of. Hope it all goes ok for you. It’s a scary thing but you will be ok!
I hope your okay… this is a lot for one person, know that you are adorable and so so loved ♥️♥️♥️ sending you all the positive vibes 🫶🏻

God bless you and see you through the surgery in Jesus’ name, amen 🙏🏾
you are the most sweetest girl ever! Some things just aren’t meant to be and that’s how life is hope everything goes okay with the surgery stay strong 🤍
I could see  you had a thyroid nodule when watching the show, I did think about messaging you but felt abit silly thinking you probably already knew you a swollen thyroid. I had the same problem 2 years ago  with a thy3 indeterminate nodule, I got half removed  but mine did turn out to be papillary thyroid cancer after they tested it. My cancer was contained with no spread. I was advised to have the remaining half removed but I'm opting to keep it in for now and have just been having regular checkups and so far so good. I feel best I have in years . Don't worry about the thought of  cutting your neck, my surgeon was amazing, I had no drain and when they removed the plasters I barely even had a scar,  cosmetically you'll look fine, I was very dramatic and thought I would look like a had been attacked by Jaws, the reality was very different and I can't even see my scar.. Do makes sure you choose a top thyroid surgeon who had carried out lots of these surgeries, mine was highly experienced but my nodules which was about the same size as yours was stuck to my Vocal cord so they had to scrape the cord to remove the nodule, this resulted in me totally losing my voice for about 6 weeks a d then a few months of speech therapy. Please look after yourself once you've had the operation as i felt physically and emotionally drained, the emotional part was worst. Because you look fine people think you're fine but inside I was struggling mentally for months. My sister also had half thyroid removed but hers was not cancer and she takes no thyroid medication . You'll be fine. Just look after self and stay away from stress because stress def makes the thyroid worse. .  Plenty of studies and research out there on thyroid cancer hence why I decided to keep my remaining half in.  Good luck and if you've any question just reach out
Stay strong samie, we are all so proud of you ❤️
So sorry to hear you’re going through this, wishing you nothing but the best 💕 x
I’m so sorry to hear this Samie , your a wonderful girl and you will be okay !!❤
Chin up Samie ❤️ everything is going to be okay ❤️
I’ve got a friend who is going through this exact same surgery very soon. It’s very common and very safe. It’s okay to be worried about it and hard to process, but know that you will be okay ❤️❤️
sending my love❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Two of my close family have thyroid cancer higher graded at 4 Samie. Both have had various ops through the years but over 30 years later both are here, living life with kids. Keep positive, you've got it early& that scar will save your life. You will save other peoples lives highlighting this ❤
The first part of my last comment meant to say dam girl WOOOOW. Auto correct is killing me lol
❤❤
Samie, can girl WOOOOW. I got hit by a double wammy in this video. I thought u and Tom was good, so I'm sorry to hear about your split. Then this lump on your neck that I didn't even realise. Try not to panic, it will not be anything serious. I found a lump on my neck 6yrs ago and it turned out to be a limf gland. It just eventually went away. Keep your head up, whatever it is, youve caught it nice and early. It would be incredible bad luck on you if it turned out to be something serious. You're far too beautiful and a lovely down to earth girl who only deserves successful and life long fortune. I'd marry you tomorrow, keep me updated x x x Thanks for your reply as well, much appriciated, especially now you must have tones of messages x x
So sorry that you're going through this, I totally understand my dad went through it but try not to worry about the surgery, easier said than done but you're so strong. Sending love ❤
Sending you so much love and stay strong. You've got this. I think it's so easy to judge a situation and jump to conclusions when you really don't know what someone is actually going through and what's really going on, we are all guilty of it. You take care Samie ❤
Im 21 and I’m sure everything will be okay for you I found out I have an Overactive Thyroid last week and my neck is starting to develop a lump which is also getting tests and possible surgery you’ve got this xx
You’re so brave Sammie 💗
Can I just say that aside from being literally one of the most beautiful people I’ve seen you are equally as beautiful on the inside 💗 you radiate kindness, down to earthness and maturity. Your parents must be so proud of you genuinely 💗 I know how scared you must be feeling and to have to deal with silly immature trolls on social media aswell just isn’t fair. I know it’s not the same but I had an ovarian tumour when I was your age, it was 21cm and I was terrified having it biopsied, thankfully it was non cancerous. Keeping everything crossed your lump isn’t cancerous too, wishing you so so much luck and love and will be watching to see how you’re doing. Never change, never let idiots who don’t know you doubt yourself and never give up - you’ve got this lovely 🥰 xxx
Sending you so much love. You’re so brave for being so vulnerable and sharing your story so far 🫶🏽
Sending so much love Samie, you’re an amazing strong gal and will get through this! Put yourself first! We are all here for you and you are so thoughtful and kind to show the process to help others. Keep being you 💕💕💕
I had open heart surgery when I was 20 and the scar was such a worry for me, knowing I’d have it for the rest of my life. It goes all the way from the top of my chest to the top of my belly. That was 8 years ago and I forget I’ve even got the scar now! It becomes part of you and you’ll learn to love it and see it as a symbol of how strong you are and what you’ve overcome ❤
Oh my word samie, you are so brave. So sorry you and Tom have gone your separate ways but you need to concentrate on yourself and your health now. Sending you lots of love. Xxx❤
Praying for you Samie! You are a strong woman and you can do this! x ❤
Prefer this closer video and quality so much better than your previous video! Defo keep this one up!!❤
Sending love and here for you. ❤ Was diagnosed with Hoshimotos thyroiditis in my 20s. So it was a big scare supposedly before that finding the right diagnosis. So am here for you, things really hit all at once don't they? Even recouping from life already. But this too shall pass. Just take care of yourself. Prayers and much love. 💕🌺
❤ Big love and respect to you sweetheart. Ask your doctors about your mental health too when removing your thyroid as it can impact your MH. Tackle everything at once, you've got this xxxxx
This made me tear up! I hope your okay samie I can’t image the upset and heartbreak when thinking something might be cancerous! I hope you and your family are doing well, take care of yourself! 💕 I can see your one strong girl so I know you will pull through this! Some people can be horrible when they don’t know the full story! Some people are just small minded xx
Hey so I don’t comment regularly on YouTube at all or any social media for that matter but I wanted to say that you are one of the bravest people for coming out with this and the amount of people you will and already are helping is incredible!! Keep your head up gorgeous 🥰 hoping everything turns out to be perfectly fine but either way you have so many people who know and don’t know you who are so proud and will be here for u!!! Don’t let anyone get you down ❤️ lots of love and respect for you gal!! X
Samie, I’ve gone through thyroid cancer at 24. I can totally feel your overwhelm and I want to tell you the best thing you can do is to take all the time for yourself. If it is cancer or it is not it is still going to be a learning curve when your thyroid is removed. Talk to as many people as you can, read as much as you can. The scar will disappear mine has in a year! I’m thinking of you and send you all the good vibes! ❤️
Thank you for sharing this and helping to spread awareness….this is very brave of you!! Sending you lots and lots of love and well wishes… there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel.. sending you nothing but positive vibes💗💗💗💗💗✨🤞🏼
Bless you huni. That must be so stressful. Your number one priority needs to be you and your health. Wishing you all the health and happiness you deserve. You are a tough cookie! ❤
Wishing you the best of luck with everything ♥️ you're definitely not alone, and I promise it'll get better soon
Lots of Love Samie💕 Stay strong girllll Always here for you
Oh, dear! 😢 Send you a lots  of love and good luck! 🤍🫶🏼
I have experienced thyroid cancer in my family and it changes your life and mainly for the better bc it makes you have a different perspective on life. You are so strong Samie, we all love u sm!💓
You are just so pure🥺, praying for you beautiful!!
Whatever it is you will smash through it 💞
Sending love and support always. Keep on top of that block button to get rid of the trolls.   ❤
Love you so much stay strong ❤
Hope everything goes well, but it could just be goiter which is when your thyroid grows due to your body producing high levels of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). It happened to a friend of mine and she just takes some medicine. Your are a very strong person and everything will work out
Sorry to hear this Samie. You are a lovely genuine strong beautiful girl and will get through this. I know of someone who also has a lump in their neck but it is just getting monitored.  Also gutted about you and Tom as I think you were lovely together however I can only imagine the pressure on your each other after the world-wind of being off a highly watched tv programme. Wishing you all the best. X
Ur so strong I am so sorry for what u are going through I hope u get all sorted sending love ❤️ xx
Oh darling. You must be so worried. I really hope it turns out to be nothing to worry about. Sending love ❤
Prayers for you, darling girl. Everything will be alright. You have an amazing future ahead of you. x
Bless you, so sorry to hear this beautiful lady. Keeping my fingers crossed for you that everything will be okay 🙏
I didn’t notice at all- so glad those viewers were persistent in sending you messages!  Maybe this was meant to be- you going on LI.  Put yourself first and take care.  Best wishes
Sami....you are a top girl. I am so proud of you. I have been through surgeries and diagnoses i never wanted...and i am so much stronger now...truly....you are going to see just how wonderful you are...how resilient you are....Tom is going to miss you that's for sure ❤
Bless you - thinking of you - stay strong
I think the reason that you got on the show was not so much about finding love and more about finding this health problem. I think God meant for you to go on and used it to protect you. ❤
Love you so much Sammie ❤️
Sending you lots of love and hugs stay strong and positive you a lovely young lady. 🥰 Xxx
Samie please stay strong girl you’ve got this we all know you have don’t put yourself down for a single moment xx❤❤❤❤
Aww wishing you the best
I’m so sorry your going through this beautiful, your allowed to be upset as this is so scary to go through but you’ve got this girl. Thank you so much for sharing this with us as it is really important! Sending you lots and lots of love!❤
Smashing it… stay strong and positive ❤
I will tell u about my aunt story. ( sorry for my English I hope u understand). Around 10 years ago, my aunt had a cyst on her throat, just like you. Doctors told her that she must have a surgery to remove it. She did the surgery than they analysed the cyst; thanks  to God there was nothing  there; no cancer she didn't lose her voice. Now she is 55, and in very good shape. stay in pray and help people in need either mentally or financially cause when you do that God will automatically rewards you back. Finally, concentrate on your health people come and go but health when it goes it doesn't come back. Stay positive hope u the best.
Love you hope you get through it all ok
Thanks so much for sharing your story and your experience with everyone. You are so strong and brave!!!
I'm so sorry Samie... stay strong in this difficult time. Sending so much love ❤
❤
❤❤❤
Sending you positive vibes only. You and Tom obviously a down to earth people and I wish you both the best moving forward.
Stay strong !!!!! ❤
❤❤❤ take care
💗💗💗💗
I had to get my whole thyroid removed too because they suspected of it being cancer. They sent it off to get tested because they couldn’t tell from the biopsy if it was cancerous. Lucky it wasn’t cancer, but since I don’t have a thyroid anymore I have to be taking levothyroxine my whole life. And getting blood work every couple of months to see if I need less or more dose of the medicine. As for the voice changing thing for me my voice was a bit weak and I sounded hoarse but then my voice went back to normal.   Wishing you the best. You got this!
You don't need to justify yourself my lovely I can't even imagine the whirlwind of coming out of Love Island and all the expectations and then this awful news on top of that is enough to send someone's head spiralling. I had a cancer scare and had to have lots of tests and was absolutely distraught, luckily for me I was all clear and 🤞🏻 you are too. Health comes first at the end of the day and if you have to take time away then that's what you need to do. Wishing you all the best, I'll be looking out for your updates. Your a strong, beautiful girl. You've got this 💪🏻❤️
I wish you nothing but good health and strength to get through everything 💙💙💙
Glad you have friends and family around you to support you through everything. Thanks for being so open with us Samie. Sending you all the love and luck moving forward xx
Samie we can already tell how strong you are keep your head up and you got this! Can’t imagine dealing with a break up and this scary unknown but it will all work out ❤
Your so so strong and we are all rutting for u and we all love u ❤
🤍🤍🤍
Sorry you're going through this 😢thanks for sharing this with us and making people aware!!❤ I've had problems with my thyroid for yrs now was overactive now underactive.Stay strong.....you got this!!😘❤😘xxxxx
My favorite bombshell everrrrr
sending you loads and loads of love 🩷
Hey Samie, I am 22 and also just found out that I have a lump on my thyroid and also have to get half of it removed. I'm also quite overwhelmed and tbh unsure how to feel about it. Sending you the best and it'll all work out!! We will get through this xx
Oh babe.. My mum had her thyroid removed for the same reason. Understandably such a scary feeling but honestly it will all be ok in the end. In terms of the scar once healed you won’t even be able to see it  ❤️ You’ve got this girl! X
You go girl, you are strong. I feel so bad that you got pressured to do this video, your helth is much more important than what people think about you. May you be blesst.❤️
love you so much, hang in there ❤
You got this gorgeous!❤
It's going to be ok samie, my mum had a thyroid operation and she had both of them removed, she only struggled with talking for a little while after but now she's back to normal you will be ok xx
My mom has had this procedure twice, and has come out okay! It can definitely be scary, but know you have so many people surrounding you and supporting you.
Samie, you're so brave and honestly will be an inspiration to so many for being so transparent. I have faith that you will come through this, and I personally thank you for sharing your journey so far. We'll be there with you every step of the way. You've got this,sending lots of love💖
❤
Awww sammie I just want to squeeze you, your a beautiful and strong girl, you’ve got this ❤️ sending all my love and hope for a speedy recovery x
samie you’re the strongest and most beautiful girl inside and out, and we’re all here to support you every step of the way. So much love for you, take all the time you need and it’s completely understandable to be overwhelmed, that’s a lot for a young girl and you’re so so strong! Sending love always, you’ve got this my angel ❤️❤️
The same thing happened to me when I was 16 and I was on the grey scale too. Watching this made me cry because I totally felt the same way and it was terrifying and still is because for me this is still an ongoing issue. Try not to panic you will be absolutely fine ❤️❤️
We love you samie we will be loving u through this though time ❤❤❤
So sorry you are going through this. The lump may not be cancer, just remember that! You are so strong, you can get through this. You are so lucky to have cought it early. My colleague has recently gone through it, got it removed and it wasn’t C at all! I hope everything goes well xx
You’re so brave I never could have faced doing this when I had a cancer diagnosis, I’m sure you’re not going to get that diagnosis yourself, but I understand exactly where your mind will go. I wish you all the best luck in the world you gorgeous girl, with the whole of your long long life ahead of you xxxx
Will Tom help you with this or not
Sammie you are a very brave lady! ❤
Wishing you all the luck for the surgery and results🤞🏼🤞🏼, keep remaining positive you got this girl 😘xx
I love u sooo much we all respect ur opinions and we wish u the best u dont know how much people love u❤❤😢
You're young, strong and determined, with your whole life ahead of you. Mr. Right will turn up when you least expect it. Best wishes for your journey however it turns out. Being selfish and prioritising yourself right now is the most important thing.
Sending so much love samie ❤ stay strong.. 🫶🫶
Hey Samie, Life can be so difficult especially when your young. A lot of things can hit at once & right now life is being a b**** towards you. I am very sorry it didn't work out between you | Tom.  I think everyone thought you | Tom would make it work just because what you both went through while inside the Villa. I hope the both of you can come back together especially w/your health I think this should bring both you together again!! I hope everything comes out positive between your health & the relationship w/Tom. We as your Fans, Friends | Family are here for you girl!!

Big hugs to you. Know you are so lovely. Hope it all goes well and your test come back benign xx
Heartbreaking watching this  Be strong all will be okay 💗💗 your the loveliest girl inside & out x
Checking your neck should be seen in the same regard as checking your breasts or testicles! It would be great if you could get more information from your doctor about how people can do this themselves, or by getting others to help and make a video for awareness. It definitely needs to be spoken about more❤
Bless u Samie sending lots of love your amazing ❤x
Just curious,can you feel the lump?Did they call it a nodule?I have Hashimotos and hypothyroidism and have had nodules and never went back to have it checked just bc well,life happens.
Sami you are a beautiful girl! You will smash it love you xx
Follow your gut.  Never apologize for being you and being real.  It is appreciated and you are brave.  Doing education about it will only help others
I’m 21 and I’ve currently got thyroid cancer that spread to my lymph nodes, took me almost 3 years to get diagnosed, so I completely understand how you feel especially being so young as well. Your health is the most important thing, you got this samie ❤️❤️
Just remember you are amazing, forget the people that are spreading hate they’re just jealous of you.  I’m really sorry that you have broken up with Tom. That’s really sad news but life moves on .  I’m really glad you have caught this now. My dad had this exactly the same thing he had his whole thyroid removed in the end because it was cancer.  But he is absolutely fine he had the surgery done twice.  I’m quite honest with what I say so it does hurt afterwards. He did lose his  voice for a little while.  But trust me that came back. He said it was just like having a very bad sore throat and you can’t eat for a little while but at least they got rid of it and he’s on thyroid pills now for the rest of his life but he’s alive no other treatment was involved . So glad have caught this early for thank the Lord.  You’re going to be fine, you have all of your fans including myself behind you. Please come on here and tell us all when you’re sad when you’re happy we have your back .  Take care, my lovely head held high you’re a strong woman
Praying for you sweetheart ❤️ 💗 🙏 I really mean that ❤❤😊
sending you so much love ❤️
Thank you for being so brave to share all of that with us you don't owe anybody anything just the fact that you're willing to share your personal story shows how courageous you are

And hat off to those who spotted it! ❤
I’m so sorry this has happened to you. I’ve been there with the thyroid issues. You’re not alone. So many women go through this whether it’s hormone imbalances related to thyroid or thyroid growths/ cancer. It’s all daunting now but you will learn so much and be good as new in no time. We need more women speaking about their health issues and journeys. Lots of love to you from America! We love you here and are rooting for you ❤
Sending love🫶🏼🫶🏼 you’re doing great bby🖤
Bless your heart! Totally get it and so sorry you’ve hate, absolutely disgusting. I know someone who had this at a similar age, and they are fine as you will be. It won’t be an easy journey but you’ll come out even more amazing on the other side ❤️ xxx
Awh bless you sweetheart. You just need to look after yourself and forget what anyone thinks. As you say your health comes first. So just do what’s good for you and stuff the haters. Take care of yourself xxx
Bless her 🙌❤️
I had melanoma stage 2. Although it’s not the same thing it’s still the C word. They managed to remove it all with surgery and I remember before it being scared about the scar. I was 25. but now I embrace it because they managed to remove it as you said a lot of people don’t have that privilege. Your beautiful Samie keep being you. Good luck with everything I have everything crossed that it will go well. Lots of ❤️
❤❤❤❤

love you so so much samie❤️❤️
Sending you so much strength and love. 🤍 Hope it's nothing serious, but regardless you get the answers you need & help spread awareness. It's time to focus on yourself babe! x
Maybe it was fate that you didn't get on the other Love Island series and was on this one, so it could be spotted by others people
Matthew chapter 11 verses 28 to 30
so proud of you samie<3
Sammie I went thru throat surgery and my tumor was benign.I remember Vicki's daughter Brianna from the show Orange County housewives had the same surgery you are having.I will be keeping you in my prayers. Remember the scripture Philippians 4 13 I can do all things thru Christ who strengthens me.
Wishing you good health and a speedy recovery. You deserve all the happiness in the world.  Main thing it has been caught early. You can hear the pain in your voice. Thank you for sharing and bringing more awareness around these topics.
Thank you for sharing. Keep strong. You will be ok. Taking care of yourself is your main priority right now xx
Sending so much love to you Samie! You’re a strong women and will get through this. Just focus on yourself and your well being. We’re all behind you, you’ve got this ❤❤
I found a lump on my thyroid in 2018 when I was 26, I had it drained and it kept coming back. They then decided to remove half and then another lump came up again on the otherside in 2019. Ended up having the other half removed. I am now on a tiny tablet every morning to level my thyroid out. It’s super scary and your feelings are completely valid but just wanted to reassure you, the  surgery and recovery honestly is fine ❤ my scar blends into the natural neck crease and nobody notices it. Lots of bio oil for after and lots of icecream for after surgery 🫶🏼 chin up and take it easy x
Keep positive and Keep strong .. cry if u need to .. when hubby was in same situation he was  a warrior x  good luck and well done for being so open we all behind u x
Stay strong samie we love you and wishing you the best healing process ❤❤

Samie, you should be so proud of yourself, sending you so much love, so sorry you felt you had to share it all sooner than you expected. You are so strong and will get through this angel🩷  Can’t believe you’ve been having to process this and also had all the comments from the public, so upsetting💔 it goes without saying that you should take as much time as you need to process everything🩷

So proud of you can’t believe your going through this but I’m one of your biggest fans and wanna let you know I love you so much and your one of my biggest inspirations and yea I love you samie 🫶🏼💗🤍xxxxx
Wow such a vulnerable honest video wishing you and sending you all my love samie xx
Awe Sammie your a beautiful girl inside and out ❤your so real and down to earth,sorry for what your going through xxx
Sorry you are going through this, I had half of my thyroid removed 12 years ago when I was 18. You can't even tell that I have a scar now. I hope you're okay. ❤️ Xx
Samie I am so sorry about what you are going through love you and hope everything is going better. i am here for you
I’m so sorry you’re going through this Samie. And having to deal with an unnecessary and unwarranted (even without your explanation) media and trolling pile on at the same time is so unfair. You’re incredibly brave to be sharing your journey and pain so openly, it’s a really hard thing to do. But in doing so you’re not only going to help others in a similar position now and in future, you will save lives as you’ll prompt people to get things checked themselves. Hopefully you’ll connect with others in a similar position so you can support each other. Know that your fans are here to support you along the way ❤ xxx
Sending love and strength to you darling x
take care of yourself lovely, i hope this helps to stop some of the nastiness going around online at the moment. you deserve so much love and support <3
bless your dear heart samie here for you <3
I hope everyone can see how you never know what any one is going through, by sharing your story. Wishing you nothing but good health and happiness Samie 💛💛💛 x
You should be so proud for sharing this, you’re a strong girl you’ve got this and we’re all here supporting you ❤
You should be so proud that you have the guts to share this with us and to keep making content. Make sure you take time for yourself and rest and relax. Keep smashing everything. We are so proud of you ❤❤❤
You’ve got this Sami 🩷
We love you so much it’s going to be all good ❤
Love you Samie, sending good vibes your way darling 🫶✨
your so brave we are all so proud of you sending my love ❤
Honestly a phenomenal clapback.  "You don't care enough about your breakup"  "Well I might have cancer so."  The internet needs to make less assumptions. People deserve the benefit of the doubt.
take all the time you need! a break-up is hard along with the health support! we all support you samie ❤
You should spoke to demi about it, good to have have someone whos been though the same as you. Youre so brave talking about this ❤️
Sending so much love ❤❤❤
Sorry to hear this - I had the same when I was 15, they didn't know what it was so removed half my thyroid. Luckily it turned out to be nothing serious, so please don't panic too much! I do have a minor scar but no one ever notices it and I completely forget it's there. I have blood tests every year to check on my thyroid function but haven't had any issues about its been 10 years, and no need for any medication since! Recovery was also very quick, happy to talk more about it :)
sending you and your family lots of love 💗
God bless you 💗 you’ll be okay 💗
you got this❤
I have the exact same size lump (about the size of a ping pong ball) on my thyroid, and it was also number 3 as well which is classed as “indeterminate”. I was told after my first biopsy that they need to get 2 benign (non-cancerous) results for them to say you’re totally fine. I was told to make sure you get the 2nd biopsy before they start removing your thyroid because it may not even be necessary and it can potentially change your voice. I’ve just had my 2nd biopsy and I’m still waiting for the result. It’s so so scary to go through and until you go through it no one else can fully understand. Don’t stress, it’s so common & you’re going to be absolutely fine! ❤
You've always been one of my favourites ever since you stepped into the villa. You're such a beautiful and kind girl and I hope you get better soon! You're such a strong person so I know you've got this and don't worry about the scar because you'll always be stunning no matter what!!! We all love you Samie💗🥰
Omg girl, hope that everything will be ok... 🙏🏼 You never know what someone is going through... 💗
Omg I started crying seeing you cry samie my heart breaks for you 🫶🏼💗🤍xxxx
So sorry to hear what your going through Samie your so strong and will get through this love u girl♥️

LOVE YOU SAMMIE 💕💕💕💕 thank you so much for sharing! We are all here for you 💜
We love you so much! I understand that you're stressed and afraid but you will get through this❤
you definitly need to speak to demi , she had the same thing or a similar things that’s so sad , you’re so strong !! 😢😢
Sending you sooo much love hun. I hope and pray you heal in all the ways possible. ❤❤❤
Omg samie I feel awful for you no one should have to go through what you do but your so strong and doing so well and I love watching your vids xx🫶🏼💗🤍
Sending you so much positive energy and positive thoughts! 🤍
You are stronger than you know 💖 you got this girl and we are cheering you on ❤
My heart goes out to you with everything you dealing with ❤ you are amazing and super strong! Much love to you
I hate that you feel you have to explain yourself to everyone, to strangers sat there possibly judging you or possibly already have judged you based on gossip and hearsay.. however like you say your a woman, your incredible and you know what's what so take your time, do what's best for yourself and know that whoever truly cares will back you in all the necessary decent ways they can! Keep being yourself, I'm so sorry your going through what you are I wish you a speedy recovery and hopefully a better outcome for you. Lots of love 🩷
Thats a hell of a thing to be going through. Stay strong, you will be ok!
Sami, you are strong.. and I had the same mass as you in the thyroid gland, and after the biopsy, the result became a benign tumor.. do not worry, it will be a benign tumor, and I removed it very simple, and your voice will change to something simple and it will be the most beautiful voice 😭 Sami, I love you, and you are the most beautiful and strongest girl, and I will support you all the time
I am so proud of you and you are amazing
Always loved you from the start, your amazing xx
Just sharing this and being vulnerable must have been hard, you are strong and you got this girlie. I will be praying for you 🙏🏾❤ We appreciate the fact that you've also been consistent aswell on here despite everything that's been going on bts. Sending so much love and light  your way 🤗❤
Sending you all my love and support❤

We love u so much Samie so proud of u xx
Your feelings are valid samie! Going through this kind of situations will never be easy especially being in a public eye and it is sad enough that you have to make a video about this explaining to these people but we definitely appreciate your courage! Sending lots of love towards you, samie! You are a strong girl and you will be able to overcome this! We got you and take your time 🤍
I'm so happy when you post. You'll get through this x it's the consistency for me❤ sending virtual hugs.
My auntie currently has thyroid cancer and she's only in her 30s, so completely understand the stress and worry you feel rn. People often disregard thyroid issues because it's never caused any deaths, but just because it's not as dangerous as other cancerous lumps/tumours doesn't mean it doesn't come with trauma and issues to do with mental health. Love u samie we're all here for you, your health is the no1 concern.
We love you more than you will ever know samie, you are so strong 🥺💜 I know a few people who got their thyroid removed and they have absolutely no regrets 💜💜💜💜
Omg I hope your okay samie stay strong love you❤️❤️
