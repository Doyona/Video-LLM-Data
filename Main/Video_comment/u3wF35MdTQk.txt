Thanks so much for all the love everyone! It was truly an incredible opportunity!   Also be sure to subscribe to Seb as he’s made a vlog of our trip coming to his channel soon https://youtube.com/@SebOnGolf
What did you score?!?
I live in Augusta and it really is an amazing and wonderful course
Not allowed to film it. Tells you everything you need to know about the miserable, arrogant a-holes who run that place.
ricky!
i played this on simulator, god damn this is a punishing course for people who cant drive straight
That's so cool you got to play there
I can't fully comprehend your excitement. For someone who has been entering the lottery just to go, even for the practice round and never hearing back from them, the thought of PLAYING there , is difficult to fathom. Winning the swag bag would go along way too feeling like I was there
so dope
Lucky lucky boy 👏🏽
Nice one. What a place to play!
Congrats bro.
Nice work!
So amazing to get to play there. Keep up the great work Rick. Love the videos as always. As a UK citizen in US it is great to hear how many people in California know about you and ask me about you. If you’re ever in San Diego let’s play a round
Love your videos Rick.
Played the round exactly how we all knew we would play, even though we want to burn it up.  Tee shot & 2nd shot are bread & butter.  From the fring them holes are par 3s, well done
Congrats on the 2.5 million
And I was just happy to be there during the final round last year!  The place is Utopia, I may have teared up a bit...shhh.
Amazing!
Did you still pay a green fee ?
Probably the same as everyone else, incredibly jealous but thoroughly deserved for the work you do Rick
I have only recently got obsessed with golf. Have not played any major course in my life. But just seeing people play, and how they describe the experiences. I have added so many courses to my "must play" bucket list. Augusta National, is probably one I will only experience in the simulator room. But seeing your joy from playing it, definitely still brings excitement.
Would love some merch. Congrats on the 2.5 million!!
Bloody amazing Rick!!
Gosh I’ve been so behind on golf. That is a cool announcement to hear. Way to go!!!
You deserve it. Welcome to Georgia
Is it just my video or is everyone getting blurred out images. I imagine ANGC shut down the sharing of a bunch of it.
Sweet!
Could have swore I saw a video of this available to watch, maybe it was a dream? lol
Great videos Rick , hope I win that swag bag
What a dream come true.
Just a wee bit jealous 😂
They let  the Dude Perfect guys film, why not you????
The fact that Ginni Rometty, the worst CEO that IBM ever had, was granted a membership, really spoils the image of Augusta Nation. But Rick, glad you had a great time.
Congrats. Crap you couldn't do video would love to see it
Congrats
Just brilliant
That’s awesome dude
Can't wait to see you film there someday.
Love you Rick!!
not jealous in the slightest, well deserved for all your hard work......👍
Lucky lad 👍 also some of the pictures aren’t showing on YouTube 🤷‍♂️
Where's this Augusta video ?  Been a while
Jealous much. Such a pity no filming.
But how? Incredible! This is one on my bucket list!
Man! How awesome for you!
Score????   downhill from the first hole tee shot?   Wow... You're in my neck of the woods near Atlanta.  I'm actually playing Sat/Sun in Augusta for a Golfweek Tournament...  Hey, I'm sure I'll drive by Augusta National... so far will be the closest I've ever been to the course...   Dude... good for you to play there!    Are you trying to make 2.5 million viewers jealous? You did it!
the best golf course of the world ¡¡¡¡¡¡
So cool, happy for you Rick
Epic
A dream to play that course. So many would give up pretty much anything just to go, let alone play. Jealous and happy for you Rick!
I could have sworn the full recap video was out there on the channel, but then the next time I looked for it, it was gone? Am I crazy or has it not been posted yet?
Hi Rick, how do I contact you after I won a price? The link that YouTube sent me didn’t work..
You are one LUCKY man Rick
I want the prize 🎉😂
So jealous, hard work pays off Rick!
What an experience to have
my guess 92.  I'm also sad I'm not gone see you putting on those greens.  Sounds like an unbelievable experience!
Such a shame you weren't allowed to film it - we could all have experienced it on the ground. I suppose that's what makes Augusta so exclusive.
Loved you hole by hole description on the Podcast
is it fair to say I'm living through you at this point?
What an experience!!
we love rick shiels
Yesss mate 🎉
You lucky dog!
All time bucket list course! That's amazing!!
So happy for you.
Simultaneously jealous and happy for you mate!
Looks like so much FUN!!!

So jealous😧 i wish we could get the video!
I was looking forward to the video of Augusta play! Damn. Anyway, want to be like you when I grow up. Cheers!
But did you break 75?!
Yes Rick! Loved the podcast and the swag bag ❤
😊 lucky buggers!!!!!
Extremely jealous, but congratulations Rick. ⛳️🏌️‍♂️👍
I was hanging on every word in your full Augusta podcast . Hole by hole analysis was amazing . Never been so engrossed . Loved it
Was not expecting to see the fifaplayas brother on your channel
very envious Ricky Boy
What I would give to just be able to visit Agusta let alone play there... super jelly Rick 😂
Dream round of golf.  To bad you couldn’t film it.  That would have been great content.
Great stuff as always Rick. You just played every golfer's dream round!
Love it shielsyyyyyyy lad

Hope I win 🎉
well done
Always class Rick!
I am glad you were able to play it.
Congratulations Rick on getting 2.5 million subscribers, and well deserved and it just validates the importance of what you do and how you are helping golfers all over the word.  I’m not a great golfer but have become better over the years by watching your videos, you are my go-to guy when I need to improve my swing, pick up some good tips, or just watch some entertaining videos. Playing at a venue like Augusta, wow that’s living the dream mate and a once in a life time opportunity, can’t wait to for your update, I know it will be great. Keep driving on and doing what you do best and don’t stop.
wow what an experience that must have been
Nice one Rick, love your content. 🙂

Jealous
Congrats on playing Augusta! Be a huge honor to play that course.
Incredible opportunity which more than 99.99% of golfers will never experience... Looking forward to the follow up video and being drawn for the swag bag...
Love it & love the content!! That swag bag looks awesome!
That's a dream come true!
Congrats on hitting 2.5 mil!  It must have been crazy playing Augusta National… so jealous lol
Congratulations on 2.5 million!!!
What happened to the video on your golf show channel about the experience? Was it removed?
Wonderful.  You are a very fortunate person.  Thank you for keeping it energized.
Congrats Rick. Bucket list for sure
If I played Augusta, and that well, I don’t think I’d touch a club again for the rest of my life
Sad that you guys weren’t able to film. I guess Augusta is able to do whatever it likes as it doesn’t need the eyeballs
it would be a dream come true to play there
😮
Lets go!
Waiting diligently for that video
that experience sounds so amazing! congratulations! def a bucket list item for me
So happy for you! Keep It up buddy…

Got to be there (first time ever) on Saturday and Sunday. It’s everything you said and moe. Cheers!
Well I’m officially truly jealous now. Rickey has done the impossible, which means I’m gonna have to step up my game. 🎉
I try not to get jealous of people, but damn that is awesome.
Awesome!!! Hope I win!
Unbelievable, not envious at all 🤢
Happy for you!  What an amazing opportunity.  Loved the play by play on the Pod Cast

Best drive on the first... It's what dreams are made of.. Congrats Rick, looking forward to seeing what you shot.
Unbelievable!!  I would love just to go never mind play a round.
The joy on your face Rick in this video is exactly how EVERY one of your followers would be given the chance to tee it up at Augusta… Thanks for sharing, can’t wait for the round recap video !!!
Must have been an amazing experience. Shame it’s not filmed.
Congrats!
Loved the pod love your content and do I love Guy as well (of course I do in the same way as when you hit that perfect drive)!!

I bet you enjoyed the round of golf at Augusta
Belting!!!
Can you take me next time
Hell yeah, Rick!
Congrats on playing there and on 2.5M subs!
Class pal! 👍
Just found your channel in the last week post tournament, funnily enough I lived about a mile from the course before I joined the Army and moved to Washington state only to get sent to South Korea for 9 months. I had hopes of getting back home for The Masters but instead I stayed up as late as I could to watch as much as I could. This was only the 3rd Masters week I've missed since moving to Augusta when I was 3, I'm 26 now.
Bucket list #1
Really like all the videos, and know how much you've wanted to play Augusta. Congrats
I don't think I have ever seen you smile so much.  What a fantastic opportunity you had and thoroughly well deserved too.👏
You’ve just completed golf 😂
Didn't seem to enjoy his golf at all
Well done Rick Shiela masters champion 😀😀👍
Wow!
I will gladly take that merch bag haha. Congrats on playing the course though, I think we’re all extremely jealous
Hell ya!  Congrats!

So jealous, that's the opportunity of a lifetime! Thanks for trying so hard to make everyone a part of it!

Very excited for the full video with hole by hole breakdowns!
What an incredible opportunity!
I was there on Saturday for the Masters. My first time. Weather was terrible but it was still an amazing experience!  Got to see Tiger, Phil, and many more!  Too bad my day was cut short. Hope I get to go again one day.

Mr. Rick,  I saw your video 11 minutes after it was posted.  I so much wish I had a chance to meet you when you were here.  I live about a half mile from the course; Rae’s Creek runs through my backyard!  I am retired military, but the service still employees me as a civilian.  My wife and I play golf every week with our best friends and I watch your postings to motivate me.  Please, if you are ever here again I hope to assist you in an manner possible.
Awesome week!

Been twice.  Amazing place.
I'm 73years of age and my golf is in decline because of ill health. Once I was a four handicap but now I relive my youth by watching your exploits on the course which I find very moving and wish I could give you a good level of competition.Well done and keep up the very entertaining videos.
Love the content Rick!
Unreal that you got to play, do we have a break 75 to report??
Playing Augusta must be like a dream! Especially the day after The Masters. Well done Rick, that is an accomplishment in itself, a huge goal as a golfer. I've very much enjoyed watching your content over the past few years and it has helped me get in to golf and start playing! Keep it up. P.s. I'm from near Warrington Golf Club which I know you have played!

awesome pics, even on this trailer
Unbelievable opportunity & course looked incredible .... Great round of golf to match x
Great to hear that you had such a good time
Amazing opportunity, great tell all podcast, look forward to the shot by shot video to follow.
I cannot wait to see the next content about playing Augusta!
Congrats Rick! Looking forward to the round rundown!
True bucket list experience. I have heard it and seen documentaries that it can’t be put into words just how remarkable the course is. Jim Nantes says it best “a tradition unlike any other”. I can see in your face and how you’re describing the experience it’s difficult to describe. Even Seb is speechless. Can’t wait for more content on Augusta!
congrats on 2.5m!
Living the dream!
Love your work! So freaking jealous!
Nice!!!
BIG TICK off the bucket list! If there was one course I could play it would be Augusta National
Never been more jealous in my life! Lucky guy Rick, would have been amazing if you could have filmed it
What a incredible experience and would be a great staple of the channel moving forward playing the major courses. Hopefully Guy and the rest of the lads are able to attend next year :)
Incredible storytelling.
Man, What an experience that must of been. Good luck everyone.
The gift bag would be amazing!!

What an incredible experience that must have been. Thank you for all you do all your channel, I really enjoy all the content.
Watched the podcast about it, it was the first episode I watched the entirety of. I was noticing how they were not doing the shot by shot breakdown until a separate main channel video, but just couldn't resist giving a near shot-by-shot 😂
Great job Rick always a joy to watch
Such an amazing opportunity! So glad you got to experience it and share it with us!
Love the channel !
What a lucky duck!!
“Better than most”
What an experience, if I can't play AN at least I have a first hand account!
Congratulations on 2.5 million subscribers, love the content!
Love your content! Must have been an amazing experience

Legendary mate, congrats! 🎉
Not jealous at all, nope. Not at all 😬😂
Incredible opportunity, shame we won't get to see a break 75 round there!

That's on my bucket list to do with my son.. can't wait.. well done Rick..😊

Well done Rick, you certainly are living out your dreams of playing on some epic golf courses. I am a beginner that loves the sport & l really enjoy watching your videos for some tips on improving my game. I tried them out today & thanks to you l played a lot better. Keep up the great work you do 🙂 ❤
Awesome to see you out here crushing it Rick! Thanks for all the how to videos as well, I've watched many of them several times over the years and still continue coming back to them whenever I want a refresher.
Unbelievable opportunity! Hard work pays off 💪
please pick me :)
That is so awesome! The pictures don't even look real, that's how amazing it is. Can't wait to see the pics, i only wish i could watch a video of you playing all 18!
Definitely my number 1 bucket list course! Happy for you Rick! 🇿🇦
Fantastic, loved the full description on the podcast!
I am from South Africa can i still win
I can not imagine having the privilege of playing, much less stepping foot on the grounds of Augusta. Must be like a dream!
Amazing.
been watching your videos for a while Rick you helped me learn to play golf, you're the best man.
Congrats Rick on 2.5M. Awesome way to celebrate.
Must have been an unbelievable experience. Well done Rick. 🎉😊
I found your channel about two weeks ago and absolutely love it, my father and grandfather have always been into golf and tell me yearly how they dreamed to go to Agusta, I’m getting into it now myself as my grandfather isn’t able to play anymore I’m taking up his spot with my dad. Glad you got to experience the bucket list course of so many people! Keep up the amazing content!
Congrats on your 82, Rick!
Craziness rick! You always talk about playing Augusta so cool you finally got to!
Love it! That's absolutely amazing!
Congratulations! You’re living quite the good life. Wish you were able to video tape it. Looking forward to the pics.
From Georgia, never had the privilege of setting foot on the course.  Would LOVE that swag bag.  Keep doing great things for the golf community and your millions of fans Shielsy!
GIVEAWAY!
Sounds like an amazing experience, and well deserved! I’ll keep entering the ticket lottery—hopefully it eventually works out!
That’s unreal
I am SO glad this wasn't click bait....I clicked on it thinking you played it on a simulator or something....then I thought, that photo looks awfully real, okay fine - I'll click on the damn thing and then be disappointed.  BUT I WASN'T!!!  Way to go RICK!!  Next time invite me!!
you lucky boy, happy for you mate. What a dream
Amazing opportunity for a worldwide respected Golf ambassador! Happy for you Rick! Now we get to live it through your lens on the podcast and upcoming full recap video. Looking forward to it
Opportunity of a lifetime . Waiting for more!
CHEERS MATE!
Sweet gift bag
Unbelievable!! Every golfers dream course
Rick out here living his best life
Congratulations, what an experience!  Can't wait to hear about it!
What an opportunity. I hope I can get the go of to play there one day
What a dream that would be.
congrats on the round rick, looking forward to the score update!!!!
Bucket list play congrats
incredible, I need to find a way on there sometime ever.
You are the man Rick! Wish we could have seen that drive 😮
dang wish you could've got some video. glad you got to miss out on all that rain. i would be curious how much moisture was still present.
So amazing! You got to play my dream course! So jealous!!!  I can tell by how happy you are in this that you took it all in!
God that's gotta feel good to stripe one on the first teebox AT AUGUSTA NATIONAL!
Awesome!!
Wow experience of a lifetime, congrats Rick and Seb!
Hello Rick, so I guess that's a no go on tourney play in Santa Fe, NM???????? But I'm glad you got to play the MASTERS.......DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!!!!!😊
What an amazing experience!
Can’t believe they wouldn’t let you record videos 1 day after it was just televised to millions of people. Golf is being torn apart by money and greed and people like Rick are keeping the sport alive. More people follow and keep up with his golf scores than the pros! You couldn’t let him just make videos to show off what it’s truly like to be at Augusta. They dropped the ball on this one, remember they said they wanted to “grow the sport” after the LIV signings and here we are again playing the old man’s sport that does absolutely nothing to help spread the sport and the courses that have made golf what it is today.
Truly enjoyed your excitement. Loved the podcast.
Augusta is Augusta is Augusta.
Love it Rick!
Congratulations on visiting the one and only Augusta National. Experience of a lifetime. All the best. Oh, and pick me for the giveaway. Let’s gooooooo!!!!!
No better man. Deserved it Rick class mate ❤
Just getting into golf but this channel has fantastic content and what an incredible experience!
I just came across your channel, good to see another Shiels doing well for themselves
Congratulations Rick what an opportunity
Amnazing!!
Fantastic news Rick!
You've inspired me to pick up clubs!
Unreal. Would be amazing to do this
Awesome congrats! Great job. Great to see and hear the story.
I would love to play but how.
you're the man rick!
Augusta!
Amazing!!
We were there for the Saturday rain. Still a once in a lifetime experience.
Dreams do come true
Congratulations on playing the course. To me, Augusta and The Old Course are the pinnacles of golf. I hope to see both courses in person one day.
I live in Augusta, been here my entire life. I hope one day I'll be able to attend the masters as a patron just to see the beautiful course .
An absolute once in a life time opportunity to get to play this course. You looked so happy to have been able to play the course. 🎉
Just watched your podcast. Your enthusiasm was contagious!!  Love your channel and really enjoy your Golf Bidder challenges!!
i am your master
Love the channel. Congrats on 2.5 million!

Wow, Rick gave the best description of Augusta on his podcast. What an incredible experience for you, cheers!

Just incredible Rick, good times

What was your favorite hole?
Nice to see you so pumped up. I can't wait to see what you scored and how you did on each hole. I would love to be able to play there as well some day.
Brilliant. well done Rick!  No-one deserves a round at Augusta more.
My palms got sweaty hearing you talk about some of those shots on the podcast! Don't feel bad about 13. Forever when you see players in that pine straw you can now know exactly what they're facing!
🤞 well deserved Rick
Awesome that you had the opportunity to play Augusta National.  I love watching your videos.Keep up the great work.
Bucket list stuff Rick !
what an amazing opportunity. well deserved!
rick i’m guessing you were thinking about how many views this video might have gotten it u could’ve made a break 75. LOVE THE CONTENT MAN
I love watching you Rick and team.  I am a weekend golfer in Nebraska.  I love your enthusiasm, and you always show it like it is, even if it isn’t great.  One of my lifetime goals is to make it to the Masters.  Would love to play, but that probably isn’t in the cards.  One day I will make it to the UK and play a few course over there.  Keep up the great videos and I look forward to the recap of Augusta. -Mike
Sounds like such an incredible experience! I could only dream of ever having the opportunity.
I wish I was good enough to play Augusta the place of dreams.
Well done Rick. Cheers buddy!
What an amazing opportunity to play a bucket list course of every golfer out there! All 2.5M subs were there in spirit! Congrats to you and your team for everything you continue to do on YouTube! Here's to many more subs and banging videos! 🎉
Lucky boy dream come true
August is a dream of mine.great you played well

Amazing!
This dude’s channel has helped my game so much!! Would love to win that Masters swag bag!
The man of the people!
Love your enthusiasm. I can only imagine what it was like to walk those hallowed grounds!!!

Attaboy Rick
Well deserved Rick
Congratulations! Looking forward to hearing more.

He's absolutely beaming! Love that you got the opportunity to do this Rick, I can't wait to hear about it on the pod.
I believe the great Peter Allis compared the difficulty of the greens at Epsom GC with Augusta, you should try them Rick!
Bucket list just to walk the property let alone golf it
Phenomenal Rick! The content just keeps getting better and better ⛳️⛳️⛳️
Awesome watching, hope you did it justice. Not suprised you didn't try a break 75 on this course. 🙂
The podcast review was phenomenal. Can't wait for the courses in Canada to open so I can go play.
Loved the video, I was dubious about you not being able to film it but having listened to the pod still get a buzz hearing about it.  Well done
Amazing! Well done Rick 🎉
Really wish we could watch you play at this amazing course! Glad you had a great time though!!!
Absolutely incredible!
Your shot-by-shot description on the podcast was like being there.  So happy for you to experience a round at Augusta National and share that with everyone!  Thank you.
Super stoked to see the next vid!
It has to be the best golfing experience ever
Love the content and love the Energy.

Bucket list course! Congrats.
Hi Rick, I’ve only just recently started playing golf but found your videos really helpful in improving my game and making cleaner shots. Also stumbled across the podcast which is a real lift during the week, keep up the top work 👍
Good work RS… you still sound pumped
Definitely jealous. Congrats on being able to play.
Congratulations Rick!! And great score!! Love your videos and keep up the good work! And you too Guy
Such a cool story Rick! Was watching the videos when you were teaching golf. You helped me get from a 20 handicap to 5.6 in the span of a couple years. Awesome to see your work pay off.
Swag please
Congrats! We’ll deserved couldn’t have happened to a better golf ambassador.
🔥
Buzzing for Rick with this!
Amazing Rick, just listened to the podcast and loved hearing all about your round on a course at the top of most of our bucket lists 😀
Amazing 👏
At what point at Augusta did you break down and cry?
I broke 100 for the first time on my local course with your tips Rick. Totally earned!
What an incredible opportunity. I'm glad a few proper golfers got to experience this rather than just journalists who may not even play golf. Congrats!
You're living the dream
This is thoroughly deserved as a result of the content you put up for us to be excited for and enjoy each week. Hope to bump into you at The Open to shake your hand and have a photo. Greetings from South Africa
Bucket list complete Rick, lucky man
Well deserved Rick!
Enjoy your content immensely.  It's a shame more private clubs in the US do not give the average Joe the opportunity to play their courses without knowing a member.   Overseas I believe with a letter of introduction you can get on some of the private clubs.   Obviously, still very limited tee times, but hey you're saying I gotta shot!
Living your best life! Awesome.
The swag bag would be ideal. Just tuned in to the podcast. Was good to hear about your trip to the masters!!
Let’s go Rick love the content, sad you couldn’t film, definitely would have been a banger ❤❤❤❤❤🎉
What an experience. Lucky golfer to play the course well deserved 😊😊
It’s such a shame there’s going to be no video but look forward to the score update video! Congrats man
2.5 million, round at Augusta, bet you must at times pinch yourself. Keep the awesome content coming.
Can’t wait to see the next video!
Love the content Rick! A swag bag would be sweet! Bummer you couldn’t film but that’s kinda expected!
Magic
S w a g
Always look forward to seeing your videos Rick! Keep up the good work 🤘
That’s awesome. I couldn’t imagine the score I would have playing there. I would love to try tho.
Awesome!
Just watched the pod cast...what an amazing experience for you...and all of us, I think we all feel we were there with you
What an experience!
Ticket ballot opens in June for 2024 👀 Here’s hoping that swag bag is just the start
Cheers Rick! I am your biggest fan in China. I was so glad to hear how you played Augusta thru the podcast channel and i'm sure that this would have been right up there as one of - if not - the best golfing experience of your life . Envy you so much. A round in Augusta National is definitely something out of my reach. I hope my son gets to play it some day. BTW, my son is 2. You may say I definitely have big dreams of him being the golfer I never was. lol. Keep up the fantastic driving mate!
Wow what an experience!
That's amazing Rick couldn't have happened for a better guy. You absolutely deserved it can't wait to hear all about it!
Top work!
Rick, what a bucketlist thing to do! Congratz! Super exited to hear about the experience!
Awesome!  Well done.
Great news Rick!!  Can't wait to watch the new podcast.

You’ve fulfilled every golfers dream by playing Augusta, congratulations! Look forward to hearing all about it!
Bobby Jones designed this gold course. Mr. Jones described it as his "Homage to the Old Course at St. Andrews." Are there any similarities?
Unbelievable you got to play Augusta. ❤
So glad you got to play
I just want to attend the Masters, I'm sure playing it was ridiculous!
I have a Joke: What do you call it when Rick holes a downhill putt? A Rick Roll 🤣🤣 And btw., Congrats for 2.5M Subscribers!

Gutted there's no video but looking forward to hearing about it.
Lovvveee it!
Congrats Rick! Very deserved and glad you got to experience such an amazing course!
How did you get to play? You arent a member, right?
Bruv, I wish...Lucky Rick lol
Hey Rick, we are heading to England this July and was wondering what courses you would recommend the most. Love the vids
Congrats on 2 million! Love the content
Lucky lucky boy!! Well done Rick 👏
Congrats!!! I cant wait to hear the score!!
Really wish for a thorough podcast (video format?), way better format than trying to make a regular video in this case. Looking forward to it.
Hi Rick! Would love to enter into the Master's swag bag giveaway.
How many putts did you have on the first green?
Wow Rick what a wonderful blessing to get the chance to play agusta. Since a i was a kid my dad has always told me he wants his ashes dumped in rays creek. Who knows i might give him that gift lol. In the mean timenwould love to win some masters merch to give to him.
I want some Masters swag
Love Augusta, hope you had a great time!
That’s awesome Rick! I am so jealous! Looks like heaven on earth! 💚🏌️‍♂️⛳️
Such an amazing opportunity for you.
Not jealous at all 🤣🤣🤣
A lot of very jealous subscribers
That photo of you about to strike the ball, at the 1:06 time mark almost does not look real, it's almost like a painting with the perfectly manicured fairway and green. And looking at that flag, clearly on the downslope to water, I just know I would rather risk a long putt than trying for anything near that pin.
You're getting me excited for something I'll never experience. That's awesome congratulations
Amazing that you could play Augusta Rick just rewards for all your hard work with your great content and entertainment
Crazy to see how far you've come Rick! Hoping for that bag of swag!!!!
Unbelievable! You look so incredibly happy. Excited for you!
Who would'nt love to play there!
Your a lucky man getting to play such an iconic course, im not jealous at all. Keep up the good work and here is to the next 2.5million subscribers ⛳⛳
Wow. What an experience I'm sure that was! Can't wait to listen to the podcast to hear all about it!

Lets go!!
I love your videos! Can't wait to see the pictures and hear more about your experience at Augusta!
What an amazing experience!

Unreal! Had to be the most amazing experience!
So exciting.  It must be unbelievable to actually hit shots and truly experience that golf course.  Everyone that goes there even as a spectator says that TV cannot give you an actual feel for how much slope there is on that course and those greens.
Beautiful. I want to see your video update and win the prize ☺️☺️☺️
looking forward t see how you played
Love the raw emotion of playing Augusta!
What an inspiration to so many people! Keep up the great work Rick!

What an accomplishment to obtain an invite to play Augusta National! Can’t wait to hear even more about it. Cheers, Alex
Amazing! No more to say. 😮
Thank you for letting us live vicariously through you! My 10 year old son would decorate his room with the swag bag contents. JS. You should also do a contest where we get to guess how many 3 putts you and Seb had. Haha. Great stuff!
You are a lucky guy! Us peons can only dream of playing a round on Augusta National. I live just over an hour drive from it. I can't even get practice round tickets!
Your a lucky and clever guy love your videos and learnt so much thanks 👍
I mean, jealousy of course. Wish they’d have made an exception to allow you to film and share!
Amazing achievement Rick, one for the grandkids I’m sure

Way to go chaps! A dream come true for sure… well done!
Wow. On holiday in Florida and watched the master live for the first time for 4 days. Actually wanted Koepka to win but hoping Rahm winning is a Ryder Cup omen
I have always wanted to just go to Augusta to watch.  What a dream come true to actually play.  I know you have worked hard for such opportunities.  Glad you got the chance.
Super happy for you Rick. Wish it would happen for me.
I like swag ...

Shame about the no video rule. Would be keen to see your live reactions - especially round Amen Corner.
Fantastic
What a huge milestone! Such a cool opportunity. Congrats Rick!
Can’t wait to see the recap of your round!  Congratulations on the 2.5 million subscribers - cheers!
I wonder why you can't take video?  Nerves would definitely be understandable!
My son played in the drive chip and putt national finals there this year is was so much fun.
Pity the didn't let you film.  Would have been the ultimate Break 75
Very cool. Can’t understand the no filming deal. Not like we all haven’t seen the course on tv year after year. Y’all seem genuinely giddy from the experience.
What a beautiful course. If you did better than double bogey on the first, you were on pace to beat the masters champ at least for a little bit!
One day I'll play that course...
Look forward to recap video!
Awesome
Awesome stuff 🎉
I want the bag!!
so awesome
Well deserved Rick. That is a dream of every golfer to play there. 🏌️

I’m very happy for you Rick!  I’ve never been to the Masters but hear that the course and property are fantastic.  The PGA is next month at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York.  I will be volunteering again at this Historic Donald Ross course. I have played the East Course twice since it was renovated, exceptional.

Happy for you Rick! So awesome and so deserving! Well done!!
Great time of life for you! You recently did a cameo for my brothers birthday which was great! Rushed a bit and missed a reference but he still loved it thank you 😊 plus you pronounced my name right and his wife's wrong which has made my day 😂
What a great experience>. So happy for your both.  Consider this as my entry for the shag bag.  Glad you had the opportunity of a lifetime.
Congrats on playing Augusta! Please go ahead and ship the swag to me before you leave! Just trying to save you money and time!
Awesome, very jealous🖖

Oooo very nice!   New to your channel and am just impressed with everything.    The content of the rounds is absolutely wonderful, and also, I’ve learned quite a bit from your tutorials that you made years ago.   Getting back on the links after 20+ years and am so happy to have creators like you around.

Could you make yourself take a divot? Not sure I would!
Any reason for not being able to film? Arguable one of the coolest experiences a golfer can have and they wont let you capture the moment? Not like we havent seen the course before lol
I agree with all the 👇 comments 🌞⛳️🏌️
Lifelong dream to play Augusta. You lucky lucky b****er!! 🤣😅
What an incredible achievement! You deserve it Rick. Can’t wait to hear all about it!

Shielsy the 🐐
Bucket list item that not many people at all get to cross off, insanely jealous.
Very jealous but very happy for you! Was there for the first time this year for Saturday and Sunday rounds this past week and the course is beyond imagination. Keep up the great work!
Unreal, delighted for you Rick. A real bucket list activity ticked off!
Awesome... I can't imagine.  I guess it is like Christmas for dads. Did u ever smile so much before ? 😆
Swaggy!
Lucky dog! That's awesome!!
That would be a nice birthday present 👀🙏🏼
Awesome that is 👍🏻
Awesome, can't wait to hear more RS
It’s awesome that you got to play…but Augusta not letting you film and post is a bit of a slap in the face to the golf community.  They let dude perfect do it, but not you, arguably the person with the most reach to further the game of golf.  Still awesome that you got to play though.
A break 75 on tour in the Algarve with you and guy would be a great series
Bucket.list.track!  Atta boy Rick!
One of my dreams is just to be able to come to a tourney! Lucky man!
WOW 🤩 Bucket-list round right there! I bet young Rick would never have dreamed he’d be walking the same turf as some of his heroes! ⛳️
Looking forward to the updates.  Too bad you couldn’t film there.
Wow! Every golfers dream and you’ve done it! Hope you done yourself justice!
Glad you got to play your dream course!! Looking forward to the recap video!
Love it Rick
Egulii Diiya Hogar Viitre Pasar Viitre Marle Joss Hoiito 😅
Great video, Rick! Your visit to Augusta but have been a legendary experience!

Thanks for picking me to win that stash, Rick. You’re the man!
WOW!!! That's a hard course to get on. I would love to hear all of the details of how you got in, as well as how you did golfing. Who knows, maybe they will invite you to become a member!!! 😉
That’s so awesome
Wonder if he broke 90
Exciting!
Dream day
Excellent!
How many ‘Simmer, Simmer’ were heard during round ? 👍
Amazing, good job guys
⛳️🏌️‍♂️
What a legend!
A course I could only dream to play. Well done Rick and I really hope you broke 75 😁😁😁
So jealous I even named my first daughter GEORGIA in honour of the masters my favourite tournament love the place so much
AUGUSTA NATIONAL!
Congrats mate.. I drove bye Augusta once.. Asked the guard is there a place to take a picture with the Masters logo? He said nope. Is there a place to buy merch? Nope.. ok thanks! That’s my Masters experience.. I will never forget it..
I’m so happy for you! Bummed you can’t film there but that’s so incredible! I’d love to win that swag bag!🙌🏼
Amazing. Not jealous at all 😅
Awesome Rick!
Well done Rick,  Every golfers dream and I can’t wait to hear more on the Podcast ❤
Cool! Can't wait.
That's awesome and very happy you got to play.   I must say though it was a little clickbaitish since there was no video.  yes I understood they would not allow it but to then get on and say it's not clickbait but not show video...  thats pretty much clickbait.  enjoy your channel and all you give to the golf community 🙂
Awesome !!!!
Good job!
Amazing that you got that experience! Much deserved! 🎉
Beyond jealous! 😮😮❤❤
Great news, I was hoping you'd get to play the course, can't wait to see the next instalment!!

Way to go Rick!
Beginner golfer- my games come along way from ur tips! Excited for next vid
Too bad you couldn't film.
I wanna win😁
Love the content!
Thumbs down for Augusta not letting Rick film. Excluding literally hundreds of millions of golf fans around the globe from its enjoyment, as per usual.   If only I owned a private jet and a billion dollar company, maybe I'd be allowed to experience the wonders of Augusta myself. Its almost like it isn't about prestige, its about money. Shock. Alas, I'm not one of the 0.0001%. Chuffed for you playing the most magical place in golf Rick, hope you had a great time
Very jealous, but you deserved to play
🎉
Cool, wish you could have filmed it. It would be interesting to see how you compared to the players on the weekend.
Massively well deserved. I doubt this was down to chance of a ballot, definitely recognition for content, creativity and achievements as an influencer! Congrats pal, "phenomenal"!!
Congrats Rick! Love everything you are doing!
An amazing opportunity. It’d be nice to add to my masters bell marker.
What an awesome experience!! Glad you got to enjoy it!!
You deserved it!! Best golf content in my opinion!
shame no footage. what an experience.
That is awesome!
Wow, that is most golfers dream including many tour pros. Can’t wait to see the pictures.
You and your crew truly have the BEST content on YouTube!
Delighted for you Rick, the opportunity to play Augusta is well deserved and a massive congratulations on reaching 2.5million subscribers 👏👏

Surreal, if a golf professional as Rick is telling that this course is hard for him, imagine for us the mortals. Wow what a great opportunity to play there.
That is so incredible that you had that opportunity.  How did you did you manage your way through Amen Corner?
Wow what an honour! Wish they allowed you to film though. This course would destroy me, but who wouldn't like the opportunity?
Absolutely awesome, this is on the bucket list of the bucket list!!!!!!!
Comment Thanks Rick

Would be an absolute dream come true to play Augusta!

What an amazing opportunity for you! I can't wait to see the shot by shot video.

Talking about the greens, I saw a video say that Augusta's greens have a temperature regulation system underneath them. Could you notice it? Congrats on the opportunity! Cheers.
Bonjour Rick, hâte de voir cette vidéo !!!! ⛳👏👏
Unbelievably jealous of you being able to play Augusta. Congrats Rick
Great stuff Rich, fully deserved mate!
Jealousy levels!
I’ve been watching Rick for so many years and their is nobody that deserves this experience more! So much hard work and dedication to this channel over the years and the content keeps getting better and better! That experience was all thanks to that hard you you have put in Rick! Never change, and keep the game of golf growing with your amazing content
As golfers we've all dreamed about attending the MASTERS, but you have achieved the ultimate DREAM by playing AUGUSTA NATIONAL FREAKING golf course. Props to you my friend. Would have been nice to video tape the round but I'm sure you didn't mind the snape shots because you still fufilled a lifetime goal. CONGRATS   A faithful subscriber  TP Garcia
Nothing is more special than Augusta National. To play that course is definitely on my bucket list! What an awesome opportunity for you.
Congrats Rick
Amazing you were able to play there Rick!
Did you break 75?!
Congratulations! What a wonderful experience!
That is amazing! Everyone is gonna be jealous but you deserve it.
Awesome to be able to play such an iconic course, must be on every golfer’s bucket list
Outstanding. How did you both manage to square a round there,  were you part of the sports reporters draw?
Your genuine enthusiasm is fantastic and having been to the Masters on three occasions (1985, 1988 and 1992), I can echo everything you have said about its perfection and quality. The course is a complete oasis within the town. Its nature and fauna is outstanding, as are the Patrons. I recall one older one who sat all day and all alone on the right hand side of the 5th at about 350 yards off the tee. He had a sun hat with 25 Masters passes clipped onto it - a perfect spectator. I am sure your own memories will remain with you for a very long time and in particular those of actually playing the course. Thankyou for all the enjoyment that you and your colleagues bring to all your subscribers.
So jealous. Congratulations Rick!!
Please Rick
Absolute dream come true for you! The only way it could have been better would be if you were playing with Tiger.
Best hole?
Swag!
What an opportunity, delighted for ya
Crazy!
Great stuff Rick!
What an experience! That must have been amasing 🎉
Really happy for you, Rick!   Also, hope I win the swag bag! :)
Well done. How many 4 putts?
Superb....nobody deserves more to play that course which explains why you now have 2.5m subscribers! Keep up the great work and I look forward to hearing more about the round.
me me like masters
Congrats Rick! This is a life time opportunity to play Augusta
Congrats!
Playing Augusta for normal golfers has to be like a little kid coming downstairs on Christmas morning.
What an absolute dream, and the day after the Masters as well! Incredible experience, and kind of nice that it’s one just for you to treasure and not share videos of!
Absolutely amazing that you got to play and better, the day after The Masters!!  Look forward to the video of photos.
Sounds amazing, congratulations on getting to play there
Atta boy rick

Congrats Rick! what an achievement, and what a unbelievable memory to look back at. Keep up the great content!
Awesome! Hoping you were able to learn the course well enough ahead of time by playing twice. Let us know!
Shame about no video but what an experience for you and seb
Congrats Rick! Excited for the score update!
Dream come true. Congrats Rick
Hope I get a chance at the swag bag
Very nice
Wait? They let DudePerfect film a non actual golf video, but wouldn’t let Rick “the #1 golf YouTuber”. Weird standards.
Mega-jealously mode Activated. Congratulations on the bucket list course ⛳🏌️
Looking forward to hearing it abut it shot for shot - usually every golfers nightmare, the shot by shot review of someone else's round but we might just let you off this time.....
My dream!! But I may not do well from the pro tees 😅
Lucky ducky
This is the dream!!!
Awesome 👏
Looking forward to the game recap!
Looking forward to the shot by shot video coming out soon, loving the podcasts mate every Tuesday as well👍🏼
No better way for the universe ❤ to give you thanks for what you do than an opportunity to play at the Masters! Can’t wait to see that first tee shot!! Love the reaction brotha 😆 god bless
That’s so awesome you got to play Augusta!
This is UNREAL! I can't wait for the breakdown!
So jealous! Happy for you
Congratulations!!! You can tick that off your bucket list 🏌️
Would love a Masters Swag Bag!
Shame you can’t show the video of you playing!!
Congratulations on being able to play the US Meca of Golf! no St. Andrew's but its up there. Cheers Rick
That’s F*ing awesome!
The Augusta Effect : I’m just so happy, literally punching in the air, for a guy I don’t know, who doesn’t know me, simply because he was able to play the most mythic course in the world.   Make it make sense. 😂
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! LOVE THAT GOODYBAG
Unbelievable. Good for you!
Looking forward to the 10 shot challenge you have been teasing.
Pity you couldn't film the round to share the experience with everyone.
Fantastic achievement, look forward to seeing the Vlog and see what score you shot
Would  have loved to see a video but I guess they have their rules. Can't wait to see the story unfold. Keep up the great work Mr S!!
Wow! Playing Augusta! What an experience! Can’t wait for the video!
WOW!!! Rick saying I'm jealous is an understatement!!! Well deserved tho and congrats on the 2.5m subscriber's

What a life!
Great stuff, lucky boy 🙂
Congrats Rick what an honor, you must be so proud

Very envious right now. Don't know why you were waiting at an airport you could fly home yourself on that adrenaline rush 👍
Wow Swag Bag :) Congratz so happy to hear that you managed to get a tee time :)
Another one of golf's bucket list achievements.  Looking forward to the follow up review of Augusta.

Awesome...But I thought everyone who gets this opportunity signs a gag order where you can't talk about it. I've seen several musicians, athletes who have played and they literally say they can't talk about it. A round of a lifetime Rick Congrats...
Shame you couldn't record it that would have been a really good video
Just a little jealous to be honest. Something most of us dream of and know we will never do.
😮 Once in a lifetime!
So it's just gonna be "Pictures and a scorecard" :D
Congratulations on 2.5 million subscribers and a bucket list for many to play Augusta 👏
What an opportunity 👏 very much deserved
Living the dream Rick!
wicked! a dream come trye

One can only dream! Hope you had a blast can't wait to find out more!

Absolute bucket list course, living the dream
What a privilege to play at Augusta. Well deserved Rick. You bring what seems so elite and far away closer to us through your videos!
AYO THAT BAG LOOKS KINDA NICE NO??👀👀probably not as good as that drive tho
Don’t think I can say I am even jealous. Congrats
How lucky are you Rick Shield this is me now 😢
Mate I’ve only just subscribed in the last couple of weeks and been watching every night after work since. The content is awesome and I’ve learnt a lot from your tips. Come play some courses in West Aus.
Amazing! Can’t wait to see the photos
What an experience! Would absolutely LOVE to even visit Augusta let alone play it! A Masters trip is definitely on the bucket list
Wow- what an honor to be able to play Augusta and while it was playing similar to conditions from the day before. Gives you are better appreciation for how good those professional golfers really are. I’d love to play but I’d hate to see what a 9 handicap golfer would shoot out there. Cant wait to see the pics - wish it was able to be video.
Awesome mate. Well done
Love this Rick, you're truly living the dream!
🏌️
Awesome to hear!
Ultimate achievement for any golf fan! Well done Rick. Really happy for you
Amazing!
Would have love to see you try and break 80. Well done and can't wait to hear your experience from the day.
This is what dreams are made of. 🎉
Incredible experience for you and Seb 👏
😱So happy for you, there is nothing like watching Rick Shiels content when having a bad day to lighten up the mood.
Nirvana
Love the channel, my favorite categories are the "can I beat ... if I start 10 under par". However, congrats for being allowed to play at Augusta, thats insane.
So jealous, hope you enjoyed it
Very bummed you weren’t allowed to film it! Would of been amazing to watch
Congratulations
Love the videos, great content for a new(ish) golfer like myself. Helped me massively whilst learning the game over the past couple of years.
Congratulations on the 2.5m! Such a shame you weren't allowed to film around the course, would have been a great watch.
What an experience! Can't wait for the shot by shot!
So jealous
Always love the vids!
What an unbelievable experience that must have been
Rick you were as excited as a kid in a candy shop 😂.  Wonder how the difficulty rates against JCB?
You really are living the dream.
Amazing Rick. Swag bag please. Thanks.

So jealous!!
So cool, shame couldn’t film though!!
So unfortunate that you couldn’t record a break 75 around Augusta. That would’ve been epic.
Great to have that opportunity Rick one lucky guy lookfward to wednesday
Did you tell them you would play the birds chirping all throughout the video when not hitting a shot, and they still wouldn't let you film?!?
Love it. Kids in a candy shop. Amazing, can’t wait to hear how it went. All the rest of us can but dream…
Wow! What an opportunity! Would love to win the comp
Once in a life time opportunity and one big one to tick off them bucket lists
That's great, you got this experience, too bad for us that there is no video ;)
You made it. The holy grail of golf, so pleased for you and for hitting 2.5m subscribers. Great stuff Rick 👍🏻

Congrats Rick
Amazing! Shows the hard work you’ve put in over the years has really paid off. Well done Rick. I’ll take care of the swag bag for you 😂
Amazing. What a privilege to get to play that course, and well deserved!
Incredible experience for any golf fan! Would love to play but know full well if I do I’d quite possibly break the record for worst score recorded based on the greens 🤣
Unreal
Incredible 🎉
What an amazing experience! Memories for a lifetime🎉

Favourite YouTuber
Nice Rick!  (And I would of course have loved to join you guys if you had sent me a quick pm 😊)  Today is the first (hcp relevant) tournament of the year at my homecourse, which I was looking forward to a lot. The course is in an alltime great condition, really nicely prepared and the weather was so beautiful within the past days - ...untill -  today:   85-96% chances of rain from 4 A:M to 22 P:M 😂 Cheers my friends!
Bonkers Rick. What an amazing opportunity!!! Well done mate, you’ve earned it
So happy for you, got the opportunity to play. The one course probably every golf player in the world want to play,
Amazing 👏
Cheers from Austria, i just started to learn golf and it's already build a passion even though I'm 40 😂
Keep up the great content Rick! Helps me greatly.
"Every golfer dream" as you said, besides playing this round with Tiger, it doesn't get much better than this :). Such a great accomplishment and well deserved reward for everthing you've done, GG RiCK!
Sounds class! Can't wait to hear this one
Looking to buy some wedges I'm playing off 25. Anyone have any tips? I'm thinking a 54 and 60 or 52 and 58
So jealous of you boys, its my dream to play there one day ⛳️💥🏌‍♂️
Superb!! What an experience - one of the very very few golfing experiences you can’t buy!
Absolute dream come true for everyone watching

Wow Rick how lucky are you to play the Holy Grail of all courses!!

Awsum mate. That's a dream come true playing a round there 😮😮
So amazing to get to play Augusta National.  There are so many people who have dreamed of playing that course....there are literally people who would've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars just to play one round.  Whoever did you that solid should be in your will.  You should name your first born after the person who got you on at Augusta.  SO JELLY!!
🎉Good for you! You deserve to play in all the best courses for all the work you are doing for the golf fans!🎉
Love the content Rick!
Very nice!
What a moment Rick! What did you get in the Swag bag?

Amazing that you were able to play Augusta. Maybe one day they will have you back and allow a course vlog. That would be a great watch.
What a well deserved honor! You are a treasure to the game of golf sir.
One of my deeams…..playing there. But as a “non influencer” probably it will never happen 🤷🏽‍♂️🥲 Thanks for sharing Rick

Awesome work brother Rick! Guttered we can’t see the footage though!
I remember when you were doing a “this or that” type of conversation a while back and one of the options was to play Augusta Monday after the masters and it was what you chose. So cool to see that come to life. If that’s not a incredible self achievement I don’t know what is. Congrats!
Well deserved!!! What a life
When dreams become a reality, that shows the effort you've put in to make what seemed unreachable, sensational.
Well done Rick, your success deserves a reward like this! Proud of you mate

It is every golfers prayer to get to watch the Masters in person I am so glad that you actually ascended to the heavens and got to play it. Would love a chance to get the swag to give to the kids who I mentor so they can continue to dream. @drdfromthe4wardtees

You encourage me (a weekend golfer) to be better and try new things.  I love your content and look forward to all of your new videos! Thanks Rick and Guy!
Awesome opportunity! Glad you got the chance to play there. What a dream come true!
Jealous....congrats Rick
You deserve it!
Glad you got the chance to experience Augusta!!
Very jealous but glad you got to have such an amazing experience, well deserved.
Wow what a great experience this must have been.  And I am so glad that you hit a great tee shot on #1.  Quite a few years ago I took a trip to Ireland hoping to play at Lahinch.  If you are not familiar with it it was laid out by Old Tom Morris and it is often referred to as the St. Andrews of Ireland.  Anyway I got there late in the day only to find out that they were closing it the next day for renovations.  But they told me I could go out right then even though it was late in the afternoon.  So I grabbed my clubs and headed for the first tee when I notice there were quite a few locals standing on the porch of the clubhouse watching me.  These guys looked like they stepped right out of "The Quiet Man".  They all had fishermans sweaters and those flat caps and several of them were smoking meerschaum pipes!  And I could tell that they were wondering if this American tourist could play so I was pretty nervous because frankly, I love to play but the most charitable thing you can say about my golf game is that I am a "high handicapper."  So I looked up to heaven and prayed to Bobby Jones.  "Bob, I'm in a tough spot here and I really need to hit a good tee shot.  If you could pull a few strings and help me out here I'd really appreciate it!"  Then I took my stance drew my club back and walloped a shot right down the middle and over the hill!  As I headed for my ball I heard a polite subdued round of applause from the gallery.  One of my happiest memories.
Once in a lifetime so happy for you guys!
Good deal awesome Rick!!!
Incredible!
Following Rick is one the best YouTube decisions I've ever made 😂
Congrats on playing Augusta!
Hope you broke 75.
Played Augusta! Amazing Rick, I’m curious to know how you played Amen corner famed 12th hole! Cheers!
I was excited to just be there in 2014 and 2015. I can imagine the thrill of being able to actually play the course. I am looking forward to seeing the photos and the play by play. Thank you for all you do for us and the game of golf

Congratulations on 2.5M subscribers!
Very nice
Entered into the lottery for tickets for the first time last week.  Can't wait to see the pictures of you around the course!
Congratulations must have been a dream day!
I'd give my left arm to play the course lol. I've been lucky enough in 1997 to go watch the Masters with a wonderful gentleman that is no longer with us. Bless him for that wonderful experience he gave me. Unfortunately ever since then trying to get tickets to the tournament I've failed to hmmm let's say qualify or be lucky enough to be chosen. Too bad they didn't let you film it would have been awesome to see from another perspective besides national television coverage. Congrats Rick on playing THE BEST COURSE IN THE WORLD!!!
That's amazing, Rick! So happy for you! Hoping to one day do the same. Keep up the phenomenal work!
Gutted you couldn't film it, would have made a great break 75! - Happy for you getting to play dreamland, hard work pays off n all that!

I couldn't believe that I bumped in to you at Atlanta Airport just before we boarded the plane home, then you told me you had just played the hallowed course!

Augusta is on my bucket list to enjoy the tournament with my Dad and brother. Talking about a whole other level being able to play the course. Jealous! Congrats you hit the ball well, and of course on the 2.5M subscribers. Well deserved sir!
I been outside the gate for a picture but have never been chosen I the lottery and I've been trying for over ten years,so nice to see that they let someone other than members play the course.
This is awesome!
Can't wait!
Glad you played there Rick…You deserve the experience after all the good you do for us novices….
Wow that bag of stash would be amazing
Such an amazing experience it must have been to play where so much history has taken place
I am NOT envious

You’re living every golfer’s dream!
Once in a lifetime opportunity. Super jealous.
Rick please give me that swag bag mate I'll buy you a Guinness in return
Dream come true! At least it’s my dream, congratulations on getting to play that wonderful course!
Years ago a friend attended the Masters and brought me a logoed golf ball. I somehow have lost it along the way. Here’s my bid for the swag bag.
Nice,   looks likes a good time all round.  When u signing for LIV 😂
That masters gear would be amazing! So jealous you played Augusta 😮
To say I’m jealous is an understatement! Can’t wait to listen to the pod
Congratulations Rick, amazing achievement to be able to play Augusta 😮👏🏼
Awesome!
Incredible rick!!
Ahh Augusta….. my uncle and cousin were pros, one a founder, so caddying and Thursday were always fun in Augusta. If you say the name “ Yates” in Augusta, everyone knew who you were talking about.  Charlie won the British Amateur, Dan Sr and his son both “owned” that course, with ridiculous scores, and great memories. It was best when Heineken was 2$ and security was Pinkerton geriatrics. “ Red Bud” is a great hole for a smoke spot . Trespassing there often as a kid.
Love to see it Rick!
Completely insane, glad to see it!!
What a dream come true. Congratulations...
Well done Rick all that hard work u have put in has paid off to allow u to play such a awesome golf course 👍🏾
Rick you are a hero! Living the dream - Would be awesome to win the swag bag :)
Awesome dude love the channel.
So sick!
Looking forward to see you going round the course
One lucky dude!
Congratulations
This is honestly the ONE course any golfer would be sincerely happy for any other golfer to get on that course just to hear other mortals😅 talk about there play there, love it  Big nod to Augusta for keeping traditions. As good as it would be no filming is understood and appreciated
So wished it was filmed😢
congrats rick would love some swag!
You’re sooo lucky to play Augusta, you should be proud of how far you’ve come, keep up the work Rick 👍🏻

Bloody chuffed for you Rick. Pretty much every golfers dream to play Augusta!
Hope there was birdie sauce😂
Glad the comment section is being kind! Not just saying we are sucking up to try and win, we’re all genuinely happy this happened for Rick
Even a left hander like me could use a bag like that?
What a dream come true!

Must've been a hell of a day, I can tell you're both having the time of your life. Congrats on the 2.5 million, a round at Augusta seems well deserved!
Wow! Congratulations!

Can't wait...
What a great honour...and something to tell the grandkids..😂
Ay hope you had a great time at Augusta! I will make it there one day!
So jealous.  Congratulations
Shit Rick used to be good when it was about clubs, and shot types, now he's gotten so famous it's gone to his head, mostly now its "Watch me play with my buddies, and I'll do another channel for tips later", and its some video he regurgitated from the past, but pawns it off like its new, no respect for the audience, after that i switched to a different person, Fame goes to everyone's head I guess.
It's a shame they won't let you film, very strange rule! Looking forward to hearing all about it!
Awesome @Rick Shiels Golf.  What did you score at Augusta and where was the pin placement??
You are so,lucky Rick,i ve been tryinf for three years to get tickets there and still trying,it is the eden of golf about equal with st andrews,this is what haven should look like.
Wish we could have watched you play Augusta! Also, congrats on the 2.5M subscribers!

Amazing to see you finally get to play this amazing course. Keep up the great content as ever
I played it 8 years ago and had the same experience. I hit the ball extremely well but chipping and putting was tough. Getting up and down was nearly impossible.
How did you manage that one?!
Very jealous, Rick! Congrats, glad you lived your dream!
Wow Rick. So awesome. I’ve read that it’s probably easier to qualify for the Masters than to get an invite to play the course, so that’s a pretty awesome experience.
Congrats!
I played with sir Clive Woodward once and he told me that first tee shot at Augusta was the most nervous he has ever been. Looks amazing and real bucket list stuff that .... I'm thinking you shot a +6 score
Would’ve love to play this course. Better chance of winning the lottery me thinks lol Congrats on 2.5 million subs. Keep going fella.

HUGGGEEEE Rick!!
Wow getting a round or interview with Tiger then you've completed golf ⛳ 🤣 I'm sure as you mentioned on Sir Nick Faldos channel you have more bucket list courses to play.
Let’s go rick! lucky man
Hi Rick, Guy and the team,  Hope you’ve all had a good easter.  Just had a video series idea that might interest you. The idea would be that you guys mentor/ follow a young player for a year lets say to monitor their progression, and with your help and guidance help them acheive as low a handicap as possible within a year of playing.  You guys know how intimidating coming into golf can be to new players, especially if they don’t know anyone who plays, so this series could be beneficial to those just starting out.  For example a structure could be, like an assessment, drills to work on (driving, chipping putting), getting a new set of clubs (with your guidance) whats suitable for a high handicapper and whats not, joining a club?, course management, and gaining a handicap.  There’s so much I found confusing when first starting out, and not knowing anyone in golf I turned to YouTube as much as possible. Whilst the info is there you still have to find it. This is why I think a video series on how to start out/ following a new player could help those get more confidence in starting to play golf.  Love the videos and the podcasts, and good luck on whatever comes next  Thanks  Christian
Not jealous at all.
Amazing! What a experience that must have been 👌🏼🏌🏼‍♂️
Experience of a lifetime! Cheers
unreal stuff Rick!
Congrats from the U.S. on 2.5 Rick! Well deserved and well earned. Always great content and always appreciate you sharing your knowledge with hacks like me.

You earned it, Rick!
We all love it when the first drive. Is a belter!

Truly amazing experience for you. The place every golfer dreams of. Congrats on 2.5M subscribers and the trip around heaven, I mean Augusta National :)
Awesome Rick , fairways are better than carpet 🤩👍🏼
Love that you got to do this, Rick. The ultimate bucket list course!
This is AWESOME!!!! ⛳️
That's awesome you played with Seb! Would love to see some future videos with yall together, maybe a Break 75!
The lifelong dream of almost every golfer who really loves the game.  I am so jealous, but it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  Can't wait for the updates. Also, congratulations on 2.5M subscribers.  Your videos are my favorites.
That course is a definite bucket  list course.  Unfortunately, you have to know a member to ever get on the course.  Looking forward to seeing your pics of the course
So so jealous! I’m sure you made every shot count..!
Must be amazing to be able to do this, only something us mere mortals can only dream of
Congrats On 2.5m. What an honour getting to play Augusta did you break 75?
Why can you record there? We just seen the course for 4 days lol
Not jealous at all... 😢
well done Rick! Ultimate achievement
That’s insane
Let's go. My dream bucket list vacation.
Nice one Rick. Shame we won’t get to see any footage.
entering again and hoping for a real win, not the con from last time lol Keep the content coming Rick enjoying it all.
that's incredible. right after the masters too.
🙌🙌👏👏👏
Congrats!!!
Living the dream, Rick!!
So cool, love your enthusiasm! Some swag would be nice😊
Wow, Epic to play Augusta a far cry from trafford golf center 😅 Thoroughly deserved gutted no vlog tho.
Congratulations on 2.5 mil Rick, love your content you and guy really inspire me to play even after an awful round watch few Rick shiels videos and then back in the grove, really enjoying the podcast nice to have something to listen too at work instead of radio or other people sh*t music
Everyone who goes to the Masters says the same thing: “TV does this course no justice…”. I’m sure you’ll agree that it is much more impressive to see the grounds in person.  It looks fabulous on TV, but the in person experience cannot be beat.  I was lucky enough to be there in 1996 for the opening round.  I could never imagine being lucky enough to actually play the course!  Good on ya, mate!  Looking forward to the full debrief.  Cheers!
Amazing stuff 😎
So amazing. No other course in the world I would rather play. I am looking forward to your "course review." Love your channel.
Great stuff
Swag me!
I can see why your buzzing your a lucky lucky man, what an honour to hit that amazing course just after the masters...wonder if you broke 75?!
Can't wait to hear/partially see how it went.   Awesome that you got this experience.
Ultimate dream right there.
Incredible wish I could just see the course one day
Yes Rick! Bet that was an unreal round! 🤞 for the give away! 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️

Looking forward to listening to the whole experience.  I enjoy the podcasts that Guy and you put out every week almost as much as your video channel.  If people haven't subscribed to that channel or followed you on whatever podcast catcher they use then I thoroughly recommend they do that very thing.
Love that you were finally able to play at this dream course! Thanks for all your content, guidance and general inspiration around this game. I dont think I would come to appreciate and love Golf as much had I not started following you all those years ago. Many blessings your way my friend. Keep grinding!!
Can’t wait to get the full rundown on the round!
Unreal!!!!!!
Congratulations, a dream come true. Really happy for you Rick 👏⛳️

Congratulations Rick!  What an exciting accomplishment.  It couldn't have happened to a nicer person.  I'm looking forward to watching the shot-by-shot.  A friend turned me on to your channel and I'm hooked.  Keep up the great work.
Truly incredible opportunity
It's a shame you couldn't record the round , would have been really good to watch.
Incredible!! also choose me for the goody bag...LOL
Legendary

Insanely jealous! Bucket list item for sure.
2.5M amazing  Golf bidder challenge on Augusta should be the next goal...

Very cool

Not jealous, not jealous at all. #tellingfibs
Heck yeah! Good stuff.
I bet they didn't have a sausage roll lol.
Congrats Rick on the success
⛳️
I so wish we could've seen your round. I would love to see your and @sebOnGolf's reactions to each hole. Not to mention your reactions to the greens :D
What a dream come true!  Jealous but excited to hear the play-by-play of your round.
Amazing, a swag bag eh, I’ll could collect off you nxt time your at JCB, I’m only a couple of miles away 👍⛳️
Only mildly jealous 🥲
You lucky man playing probably the best course in the world.
Been following silently for a while now!  Love the content keep it up =)
So excited for you, Rick! Can't wait to hear more!
Awesome
🎉
Very glad for you to get that experience. Looking forward to the scoring shot-by-shot video, even though it will only be pictures.
This is incredible. I’m so glad Rick got to play Augusta. What an experience. Congratulations
After seeing some of the efforts Augusta National and Chairman Fred Ridley have made to make the Masters and Augusta National brands more accessible such as the recent addition in the Road to the Masters EA game, ANWA, and even allowing Dude Perfect to play All Sports golf on Amen Corner with Bryson, I hope we will see further opportunities to experience Augusta such as the club potentially inviting Rick to play and film a break 75 in the lead up to the Masters one of these years 🙂  Might be a long shot, but it seems they are becoming more open to providing content for fans of the tournament and course in a variety of ways.
YES RICK. So gassed for you. Unreal. 🙌🏻⛳️🤤
Bravo sir 👏
I'd love the Masters swag bag! Just sayin' 😏
Unbelievable 👏👏👏 well deserved   - shame about not being able to film but looking forward to hear the scoring 👌👌
I wouldn't be able to get the ball to stay on the tee at hole one because I'd be shaking too much from nerves
Unbelievable! Super jealous
Mental - that exclusive you cant even film!   Dream Come True  Jealous!!!
Jealous!
So lucky
What an epic opportunity!  Congrats Rick.
Congratulations Rick.    Made it to Augusta!
So nice Rick!
Greetings from Germany!
Must’ve been an amazing experience…the odds of winning the swag bag are pretty remote but still infinitely better than my chances of ever playing Augusta!
So cool🙌🏻
The content we never thought we would get, but so desperately needed!!!
That has to be amazing! Every sport has their version of Augusta, and that's the pinnacle of venues.
Amazing, Hard work behind it all and what a treat. Need those scores😂
Super to see you so excited, as  Stockport lad living in Germany for the past 38 years it gives me pleasure to watch all your videos and to listen to your accent, you are cordially invited to play our small course here in Worms ,you would enjoy it and I promise to make Lancashire Hot pot and Apple crumble for you and your team love to see you here. Cheer’s David
So they draw a ballet to allow people from the media to play the course on the day after the tournament….. but they don’t allow those media representatives to film it so that the viewing public can enjoy even more content… why invite the media but prevent them from fully reporting ?
WOW!!!   Golf dreams realized for many many golfers.   Congrats to you Rick!  Would love to see the video from the round.
Doesn't get any better than that Rick! Way beyond bucket list
Ultimate achievement, buzzing for you! Well done, Rick! ⛳️
That’s awesome Rick.
Swag bag babyy
Nice work
Sooo lucky!! Could genuinely see you were both still buzzing. Amazing.
Looking forward to seeing the pictures! What an opportunity! Be good to see Seb in a future video #upthetags
Content just keeps getting better Rick 👌
An absolute dream!
I know it's nothing like playing Augusta, but I played Oakmont CC 2 days after the US Open in 1983.  I have played it 4 other times, but when we played that week the rough wasn't cut and the greens were ridiculous.  We played from the regular member tees.  I was a 7 handicap at the time and shot a 93 and felt like I played rather well.  I couldn't imagine it from the US Open tournament tees.  These guys are good!
So jealous  Would sell my left leg to play there (well the wife’s I’d need my leg to play golf)
Master's Swag - no need to say more. Thanks for sharing.
.
You’re living the dream Rick
Great stuff Rick! Keep it up!
Would love to do this. I'm glad you had the chance to enjoy it without video!
Man that looks awesome!! What I would do to play there… although I think I’d need 1000 balls and 2 days!
Round of a lifetime!  Too bad no video of the round though.
Wow, unbelievable Rick!! Trip of a lifetime, hope you soaked up each moment!!!  And whats this about a goodie bag….??
Well done thats my dream to play Augusta just once just once lol
A true legend
What’s in the bag 👀
What a dream golf day!
Congrats for playing Augusta!
Dreams man, Dreams, so looking forward to the photos!
I am so jealous. I live down the road in Atlanta and have little hope of ever playing there. Rick casually flies in from across the pond and just strolls down Magnolia Lane for a round. Granted, I don't have 2.5 million anything, but that is just a small detail.
So jealous. Glad you enjoyed it Rick
Sounds amazing!!  I wish they would have allowed you to film but I’ll take the shot by shot!!😊
Unbelievable, a memory you'll never forget!
Be honest...did you cry more at the birth of your first child or when you finished your round there?
That must have felt amazing stepping out onto the first at Augusta. Well done Rick, bravo!  🏌️‍♂️⛳️👏
Always dreamed of just walking the course let alone playing it
Rick aka the Tiger of YouTube, what a fantastic opportunity. I really hope you broke 75. Im looking forward to hearing all about it in your upcoming video. Bravo.
Chance if a life time 👊🏻
Thanks for all the content and I’m jealous you got to play Augusta but more so I’m sad we don’t get a break 75 😢
I'm happy you got to play with my buddy Jared.
SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME RICK!  Congrats on getting to play such a dream course!
Genuinely chuffed for you Rick, dreams do come true😊
WOW, looking forward to it!!
Is this the winning comment? I would think so ;) Would make my wife (scratch player) so jealous 🤞
Nice one Rick!
Able to experience Augusta, the day after the Masters and the one in which Rahm got the green jacket.. Could not be more envious right now!!!🤯
unreal
Fantastic experience a dream to play there . Wish I could find a way to play there someday.
2:13 Never been so happy for someone. Every golfers dream Rick 🎉❤
Got to go to the Masters this year. Was absolutely incredible! Got to see Scotty’s dunk on the Par 3 comp!!
Amazing! What I would give to play there! 😢
Nice.   You lucky lucky......
Rick....pick me for the swag bag if you 4 putted!!!
Well deserved, gj dude :)
Amazing opportunity! Awesome content!
Awesome!
It’s amazing to see how far you have come. Your videos truly inspired me to take golf more seriously. I am honestly even contemplating starting a golf YouTube channel. I’m glad you got to experience what we can only dream of. Looking forward to your video of playing Augusta.
Living the dream. Good for you Rick. You've certainly done a lot for the sport and earned it. Congrats!
That’s awesome! Congrats for this experience!
Learned so much from your videos Rick! Hopefully i get picked for the swag! 🤞🏽

I want masters swag please
Well done. Can’t wait for the pictures. Mike D
The Augusta goat
They wouldn’t let you film it? Yet they allowed Good Good to film hitting hockey sticks an snooker cues round there? Really dislike the snobbery of that place. Congrats on playing it though Rick
Looking forward to seeing the scorecard!

Amazing,could only imagine how tuff it is.

I can't even win tickets to attend 1 day at Masters, and you get to play there?!?! Actually, this is really awesome. I'm sure it was a hella fun.
How were you able to play at Augusta? Need to knowww
Good for you Rick!!  Well deserved!!  I hope it was Sir Nick who made this happen for you, that would be fitting!!  Thanks for reading my shameful plug for the swag bag!!
Incredible experience. Excited to live the shot by shot with you.
Very jealous. Would love to have played with you while you were here in GA.
Living the dream for all of us Rick !!! Keep up the good work.

Absolutely phenomenal to get that opportunity Rick. All the hard work and graft has now paid dividends. Bet you are still on cloud nine!!

Sweet stuff! Excited to hear about the round
No 1 Ric, well done
Opportunity of a lifetime. Comes as a testament to the work you've put in to this channel over the years.
Rick, I’m in Manchester working away from home. Just left Trafford Golf Centre. Give us the bag 👍🏻👍🏻🤣
Wow! That is unbelievably great. I can’t think of anywhere I would rather play (that I almost certainly never will). Money can’t buy that experience. 😍
Very Jealous
Awesome, Completed one and a million bucket list chance.
What a fascinating experience!
So cool!!
This is clearly fake
Ok Rick, who the hell do you know …..
Your so lucky it's one hell of a golf course, looks like you had a great time 😊
Wow Rick!! Very cool!!
what an experience, you are blessed
Sensational result Rick, very lucky guy I will play vicariously through you 😂😂😂
Congrats Rick, truly a lifetime achievement. Well deserved

You lucky SOB.  That's awesome
What an experience! Looking forward to seeing the results!
Can’t believe he played there
Congrats Rick! I can only imagine how special it must have been playing there!
Rick living every golfers dream at Augusta can’t wait to see the scorecard
Very jealous. Can't wait to see the score and pictures
What a dream come true!! Proud of you and this channel! Really is top quality content. Keep it up Rick!
Can't tell if the massive smile is because you scored well or just because you played there!
Legend
Pick me!
All I can say is….. You lucky sod Rick Shiels. I’m not jealous at all. 😊
Absolutely amazing Rick! It’s too bad you weren’t allowed to film like the Dude Perfect guys did. Maybe they will let you come back for another round next year!
Absolutely awesome! Can’t believe you got the opportunity to do that! Once in a lifetime!
Top stuff what an experience for you 🏌️‍♂️
What an amazing experience. Congrats to you and thanks for all you have done for us average golfers
Happy for you! Keep upp the good work mate!
Corrr, you lucky lucky boy!!
A dream come true for any golfer! Congrats!
Glad you were able to play .. wish you could have videoed but understand policy.
I was a "COVID cancel victim" is 2020, skipped over for 2021, rained out in 2022 and FINALLY got to walk the grounds in 2023. The elevation changes are much bigger than you can see on TV. You can only guess how difficult the greens are by watching the players practice. Example: the favored area to miss is right of the green on #11. From there, in two hours of watching, I think we saw 2 shots stop within 6 feet of the front-left pin placement. The closest shots came from the approach shots. Just really difficult to get up-and-down. Glad you got the experience, Rick.
so cool!  I can't imagine how hard putting is - must be like shooting on ice!
Good Show!!
I was there in ‘14. Just being there ticked a bucketlist item. Can’t imagine playing. Incredible place even if you don’t like golf. Looking forward to your hole by hole report of your round.
Congrats Rick! Very excited for yoy
That’s has to be an absolutely amazing feeling! Can’t wait to see what’s next!
Rick going ⬆️in life
A masters sausage roll?🌭😉
Winner winner chicken dinner
This is amazing!!!
winner
Living the absolute dream 💭 you deserve it 👍🏻
Awesome, dream come true!
Well deserved Rick! Very jealous!
Such a shame you couldn’t film it, would have been great!
I will tell my children the legend of Rick Shiels playing the 1st hole of the Master’s better than Rahm 👨🏽‍🏫
wish to have all the round on video!
Glad you enjoyed and got to play Agusta! It is such a beautiful track. I hope to get back there one day.  But, unlike you, I will only have to dream about playing there.  Thanks for your content.
Well, that’s life completed now Rick.   Barring family milestones it’s all downhill from here now I’m afraid 😂
Great stuff Rick........proper pleased for you!
So gutted you couldn't film it. Who did you have to thank for getting you on there? Did Sir Nick play a role in it?
looking forward to hear your score from augusta!
2.5 million, crazy. I remember when you were pushing to get to 1million. Best golf channel on the Youtubes
BTW you look like a kid in a sweet shop, MAGIC ⛳️
Not jealous in the slightest. Just to see the joy in your face it. Was obviously incredible 😊
It's a shame you could not film it... what an opportunity for a break 75
Looking forward to seeing how you got on 👍
Very Lucky Man!!
Very nice Rick. Well deserved 🎉
What a cool experience! I’m sure everyone here is jealous of it!
Shame you wasn't allowed to film would have loved to see it
LOL, golf. More being dead.
Congratulations Rick! Playing Augusta National is a dream for everyone golfer
Rick, so bloody happy for you! Every golfers dream to play Augusta and dead happy it was you that has done it. My happiness for you is indescribable. Get in there mate!
That is awesome! I wish they would have let you film but neat regardless. I can't even imagine the feeling you must have had standing and playing those hallowed grounds. Incredible (and I am incredibly jealous)!
Guys gonna be raging 🤬🤯
Watched the footage. Kept looking for you in the crowd on the off chance I could screenshot. Failed. Having marshalled Woburn course in the past, Augusta would be a dream.
Absolute jammy Jammers. The envy of every golfer.
Can't wait to see your scores!
Hey Rick
Swag bag? Yes please!
Completely deserved, opportunity! Congratulations Rick
Blimey. I’ve walked around that magical place as a spectator and always in awe of the course and those that play it. I wouldn’t want to ever place my game on that grass as it would just be wrong on many levels. I’ll leave that to those who can do it justice. Much respect.
Leaving comment for that swag!!! I never win but you gotta be in it to win it 😅
Way to go Rick. Happy to see Rahm win!
Absolute class
Very cool! Too bad they wouldn’t allow you to film it. What did you shoot?
Using my wife's account because comments not working. Always wanted to see how mere mortals will get on at Augusta.
You are the Champ :) I hope you get safe home to Manchester - :)
Can’t wait to see this
What a fantastic opportunity, must have been a fantastic experience 🎉🎉
Dream course to play . Happy for you boys .... 🤘
That's awesome man.  Glad you struck the ball well.  Sounds like a dream come true.
Rick…your enthusiasm is absolutely fantastic!  Your content is superb…but your authenticity shines through and is very contagious!  So glad you got to play ANGC.  I’ve been all over the property, but have never played it.  Kudos to you!
So sad that there is no video ... that would have killed the algorithm 😂😂
SAM BENNETT IS NEXT UP!!
You lucky man!
more importantly than the score - what was the substitute for a sausage roll after 9????
Way to go Rick!
Save on the airline baggage fees and send that swag to me!
A dream come true without question.  Thanks for your content.
One of my bucket list of courses
Well deserved Rick. Hope you have had a blast. Howfen boy done good 👏🏻👏🏻
Well done Rick it's sounds like it was an amazing experience
You’re living my dream!! I’d love the Masters swag 😍🏌🏼‍♂️
Can’t wait to see all the pictures from the round.
Awesome, Rick! You've been to sooo many great venues. I'm kind of jealous 😋. Love the content
In some respects, maybe not having the pressure of performing on camera will have allowed you to enjoy it more and savour the moment 👍
Was at Augusta when Jordan Speith won it and let me tell you just being at the course nd thinking about all the players from past to future that have stepped foot on that course is sensational. Awesome to see you to be able to play there cause you have represented golf so well. Congrats!
Amazing Rick! Can’t wait to see the update video 👍🏼
Rick, I was fortunate enough to be at Augusta National on Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday this year.  It was my second trip (last was 2015).  There were many highlights for which could be discussed.  The 2-3 hours spent at Amen corner Sunday drinking adult beverages, enjoying the golf of Sam Bennett finish at 4 under Thursday, or just walking around holes 12-14 after the final groups passed and crowds left and virtually no one was there.  Just being at Augusta National is so surreal.  What brought it back was Thursday on the #1 green. DeChambeau missed the green and was chipping 3rd shot, and he hits it fat!  Not too bad but enough where he was still chipping the 4th shot.  I was maybe 3 feet away on the ropes and you could see him calculating and visualizing his shot, and he "duffs" it.  I felt bad for him but it made golf so real that even the Pros make the same mistakes we do.
No one deserves it more than this man!
Fantastic news. I would love to visit here one day. 😊
I love your videos and I love golf and have a set of cobra’s I am 11
Seen many rounds there over the years…by far watching every golfer pass through the #3 tee box on Sunday in 1996 was my highlight.  This was the famous day when Norman faded and Faldo hit the gas and won.
Well done Rick not jealous in the slightest 😂 we can only dream of playing on such a beautiful course.
What an experience that must have been
Great experience!
Looking forward to the video Rick! Congrats on 2.5mil
Unbelievably jealous!
Congrats Rick, hope you posted a tidy score and get that confidence back for your Break 75
Awesome Rick. That’s bucket list stuff right there
Bet that day was phenomenal! Congrats on 2.5m, hard earned and well deserved
How did you get invited to play Augusta?!
What a legend!! Any Augusta Birdie sauce in the swag bag? :)
Wow. What an achievement to get to play this venue. Superb work Rick. Fingers crossed the shot game stood up to the challenge 👀
Jealousy meter is off the chart.  Glad you were able to play.  To say its on every golfers bucket list would be a huge understatement.
WOW! Something all true golfers dream of. Can't wait to see "shot for shot".
Nice
So cool! The stoke exudes out of your whole body!
I cant believe they didnt let you film any of it.
Augusta swag!
Congrats Rick, you've made it to the top. A place that all of us could only dream about reaching!
30 or so years ago, the Swedish commentator Mr Ulfbåge won the lottery and got to play Augusta after the tournament. He had brought his Kinbag, that his caddy had to carry since bagcarts were forbidden. 😂
Should have quest for the masters 😎😎
Awesome, cant wait to see the scores
What an incredible experience it must have been!
Nice one Rick
CONGRATS!
Unreal mate! Unbelievable opportunity! ⛳️

Not gonna lie, I’m jealous. Glad you got to play.

Really hoping to be a winner! Will this be a break 75 course?😂😂

I could make an episode of break 200 on Augusta 👌
I think I'd find it incredibly hard to play there, because *I* would be walking round incredibly hard the whole time 🤨
What a dream! Congrats Rick
Actually can’t wait for this story!!
Love it Rick!!
Congrats Rick!
Every golfers dream! Hopefully you broke 75 ✌🏼

Well deserved experience Rick! How may times did you putt instead of chip?😂😂
I am so jealous that you were even at the Masters, let alone played a round.  That is amazing.  Any secrets you can share to provide how some one who just started playing golf seriously about 5 years ago (56!) can get to the Masters?  Also, watched your match with Fowler - another incredible video.  Keep it going!  Cheers Rick!
Amazing work to get to this point, would love to see how you got on through Amen corner. 🏌🏼‍♂️
Congrats Ricky, absolute dream of Amy golfer
Glad you got to play.

Great to hear you got to play it and well done on the 2.5m subscribers  I'm just starting in my golf journey and shot 119 last Friday in my first round in five year, some good shots and some woeful but enjoyed it a lot and first target is of course to just break 100 and hopefully keep improving.
Not jealous 🫡
Awesome! looking forward to the pictures
What all golfers wouldn't give to play this amazing course!
Congrats on getting out there.  I remember a wrx thread years ago that had a link to picks from throughout the course and it promptly was taken down.  As someone who has zero interest in ever going to the US now, I stopped applying for tickets and just watch.  Good on you.
Bucket list to attend the Masters tournament and pipe dream to play it!
So jealous mate
Looked for you all day Wednesday!!! I was there
I’d pick the grass out of my spikes and frame them
Super jealous
Wow, Dream come true experiance
Wow amazing! Congrats! Augusta National has been my dream to visit since I was a kid watching The Masters on TV.
Good for you guys.  You obviously enjoyed every moment.  😂
Hi Rick It has been such an utter joy to go on these experiences with you. Most of us will never get the chance to do any of this so living through you vicariously is fun as hell. You just feel like the “every guy” and that’s why we love you so much. I can't wait for the next score update!
Luckiest golfer ever!
I was so hoping this would happen Can't wait to hear the results
Jealous is an understatement!
wow what a dream that would be. Too bad they didn't let you videotape!!
Top class. Looking forward to hearing how you got on
I played Pebble Beach and I would trade 100 pebble beach rounds to play Augusta once! Well deserved Rick!
Thats so sick getting to play augusta!! good on ya mate
Absolutely brilliant Rick!! Wish we could see it, maybe in the future!!
No video?! Ugh... OK, then... recreate the entire outing, shot by shot using animation. Thus begins the Rick Shiels Golf cartoon series!
Yer lucky bastard! Good on you Ricky. Loving all the vids 😉 2:25
Great vid!

Awesome! What a experience
Nice!😎
I played Augusta in a dream once and still three-putted every green.
Looking forward to the full round shot by shot.
Amazing 👏🏻 ⛳️
Whoa, that must have been awesome. From a fan point of view though, shame you weren’t allowed to film it, I was hoping there might be a ‘break 75’ from Augusta..!!! 😮😮😮
Very lucky guys to play there, in my opinion the best looking course in the world.
Great channel Rick! Been watching with my son and daughter since 2021 and you’ve helped us improve our scores as well as provided a first hand look at golf courses we may never get the chance to experience. Thank you for all of the hard work you put in to making the best golf YouTube channel!
What a cool opportunity!  Thanks for letting us live vicariously through you :)
Iconic! Hope I win the prize bag. My grandpa got taken to the Masters a few years ago but didn’t bring me anything home hahah
Hope you get to do a break 75 around there one day mate!
Must have been absolutely incredible
Can’t wait to hear about it!
Love it
lifetime achievement unlocked!
Congratulations on being able to experience such a beautiful course
Congratulations on the round of a lifetime! Not only cuz it sounds like you played well but just getting the opportunity to play Augusta. Love seeing you talk about this like you’re a little kid in a candy shop. Great stuff mate!

Lucky b@stard...Every golfer's dream!
Wow 2.5m subscribers and managed to play Augusta National in the same week! Well done Rick sky is the limit!
What an awesome day and experience. You’re very fortunate.
Wouldn't say no mate
Congratulations. Looking forward to the podcast!
But did you break 75...?
so jealous!
Amazing 🎉
Love the excitement Rick! This was well deserved
So Rick, who is an actual golf influencer and the biggest one on Youtube, isn't allowed to take any video, but Dude Perfect, who aren''t golf-related, are allowed to go out there and make a video of themselves playing Augusta with balls and implements from a bunch of random sports
I’ll expect a message from @RackShields with my prize 🎉
What an insane day. Well done Rick! Amazing experience, can’t wait to hear all about it!
Very jealous Rick!
OMG. So jaelous. Great man. Best thing a golfer van experience!!!
Don't know how you got to play that course, but can't wait to hear the details.  Love to be considered for the swag bag!  :-)  Cheers 😃

Congrats Rick!  It truly is the holy grail of golf.  Well earned my friend.
You are living the ultimate Golf Dream for Any Golfer from playing St Andrews Old Course pre-Open right up to playing Augusta Post Masters & playing with legends like Nick Faldo. Enjoy the dream whilst you can still dream it.
Amazing! So excited for the updates. Wish they would have let you film it. Break 75 from Augusta would have broken youtube!

AMAZING!  I was there on the Monday practice round, and I was just amazed how nice the rough was, better than most fairways that I have played.  Did look for you, but with 20+ thousands of people around, it was like trying to find a need in the haystack.  I'm envious that you actually got to play on the course, what an experience that must have been.  Keep up the great work and content.
Congratulations Rick!!!
That’s a dream come true for a golfer ⛳️!
Shockingly jealous! To even step foot on that hallowed ground would be a dream come true. Happy for you, and congratulations!
I wish augusta would do a giveaway for the masters where you get tongo there and play around after

That bag would be a great start for my collection 🤔😀
Rick, when you had this golf youtube idea in your head, could you ever have imagined it has led you to where you are now? Unreal. I am sure when starting out there was some risk involved but look where you are now.
Never been so jealous of anything. You are so lucky Rick!
Fantastic opportunity. Could see how excited you both were.
Very nice
Biggest flex in the world of golf. Congratulations, I hate you🤣. Just joking, really cool that you got this opportunity!

Good4u Rick I'll just keep on dreaming
Augusta is a Dream.
it has been such an utter joy to go on these experiences with you, Rick. Most of us will never get the chance to do any of this so living through you vicariously is fun as hell. You just feel like the “every guy” and that’s why we love you so much.
Looking forward to hearing about it! Thank you for sharing this!
I'm so jealous! That is a bucket list round of golf for sure!
Been playing golf for just about a year now.... wish I'd taken it up years ago, i can't get enough. I doubt that I'll ever have the brass, & certainly not the skill to play at Augusta , but a bloke can dream 😂
A decade plus of hard work creating content pays off bigger than any revenue check you could have ever hoped for. Congratulations!
let’s go rick🔥🔥🔥
Wow! Jealous does not come close
Wow, what a result.Wonder if the photos will show the undulations of Augusta....unlikely. Well done for reaching the 2.5M subsribers as well. Your video and podcasts are always of interest. Keep up the greate work.
Dream come true! Incredible! That had to be one remarkable feeling walking the grounds of Augusta!
So good wish it was a break 75 round there would be brilliant to watch.
Luckiest guy alive!
Congrats Rick! Can’t wait to see the pics of your round.
Happy you got to experience that, sir. Have a safe flight back!
Giddy like a school girl the whole around I bet.
I am the winner. Pick me
Very jealous mate

What an amazing achievement Rick, congrats. Shame that you weren't allowed to film, a break75 episode from Augusta would have been insane.
So happy for you! Must have been an amzing experience. My dream is to play there as well. Have a good one Rick❤
Augusta National will always be on my bucket list, but probably never play haha. That’s so awesome that you were able to play there!!
Such a cool experience! Looking forward to hearing all about it!
But did you break 75?
I can't wait to hear how it went!!
Nice one! Interested to know how many putts in both your rounds. I recall the great Peter Allis describing putting as "putting on a car roof and trying to stop the ball before the front of the bonnet (hood)"
What an amazing experience that must have been
2.5mil! Well done mate. Your channel is one of my favourite channels, I have learned a lot, not quite got rid of my slice yet but heading in the right direction. Keep up the great content.
9 months ago scrolling through YouTube as you do I came across one your videos….. now I’m full time golf addict I have to play every week I just can’t get enough just like to say thank you for the great content your smashing it 🔥🔥🔥
Congragulations!
hate you so much Rick! lol simply amazing congrats my man!
⛳⛳⛳
Freaking love the energy 🤩🤩
What an achievement! The pinnacle of sport
Congratulations!!!
Really enjoy your videos.  You do such a awesome job.   Looking forward to you describing your Augusta round.
Incredible stuff! Rick continuing to make waves. Congrats mate!
Smashed it man, love seeing your energy that your putting out in these videos. Gave me the drive to join up as a member at my local course. Keep up the good work 💪
Nice
That’s so cool, did you break 75 😂
Awesome, bucket list, check
so cool, I'd shoot 140 but it would be worth it
That is a fabulous experience.
So cool Shielsy.  I hope there's a food review...how does the Pimento sandwich stack up vs sausage roll?
Bloody brilliant.congrate mate
Too bad you couldn't do the full-on video. Augusta is caught in a time warp (which kinda gives it its charm) so honestly this is probably as good as we could really expect. Congrats Rick!
Awesoem! Very jealous.
I never knew it was possible to be happy for someone yet kinda want to stab them at the same time...
Once in a lifetime dream for all golfers. Congratulations
What a lucky Mr Shiels!! Jealous not.........
Wow! Not many people can say that. Dream come true
awesome! very jelous
Awesome to be able to play the course the day after the tournament finished.  Bet you were glad there wasn't a play off as light was beginning to fad....
Love this. What an opportunity! So glad to see you succeed!
Wow i cant wait wait for it. Must have been an incredible experience!

Rick I think I can speak for all of us in that you are living the dream! Keep it up and we will continue to be jealous.

Good to see you living the dream Rick and congratulations on passing the 2.5m mark. I am guessing you hit more putts than irons!

Can't freakin wait to see how you played!!!
Hitting milestones! Rick you’re the best
Lucky gents😉👍
😁
The ultimate bucket list round, congrats Rick! Well deserved
This is my dream and I’m super happy you got the opportunity to enjoy that great establishment.
Awesome!!
Can't wait to see how you faired on those greens!
Unbelievable! You’re living every golfers dream in so many ways. I only hope someday I’ll be able to stand in the vicinity of Augusta National, let alone play it. Keep up the amazing work!
Love the content. It’s a shame you couldn’t record the round but looking forward to the recap.
Congratulations on playing the Augusta National course!! I was fortunate to attend the 2017 Sunday final (Sergio's win) and for 2018 I drew 4 Monday practice round  (Tiger's return) tickets for myself, my best friend, his son and my son-in-law, we had an EPIC time. TV cameras  don't do justice to how undulating the course layout is (hole #10 alone has to drop 60-70 ft down which you don't really see on TV!). The amazing thing about the course is that it's smack dab in the middle of town behind hedges!! I worked with a saleman who had customers in Georgia and he said that a lot of members go there to play cards the rest of the year since most members live across the country. The hospitality of the town was full of southern charm.
Unmatched! Congrats on the continued success!
Love it!  So jealous !!!
Even the Augusta Airport looks lovely !! Great work Rick , you must be pinching yourself 😉
👏 👏 👏
So Happy for tou Rick! It must truly be insane to play Augusta National. I really hope it could be me some day.
Love it!! can't wait for the video!
That is such a cool day!
What did you shoot 110 😂😂
That's awesome. Such a beautiful place. Excited to hear about the round!
But did you break 75? My money is that you didn’t  Hahahaha
Can't wait to hear about how difficult putting and chipping is around Augusta. Crazy when even the best of the best pros are fooled by it, can't wait to see what it did to much better than average but still not tour-level guys :D
That is freakin awesome Rick!! Very happy (and jealous) for you!! Question - did you break 75????
Master fun!
Congratulations Rick.
Congrats Rick! Hope you had a good time.
Love it!!!  You hitting a bomb on #1 , I bet you had to stop yourself from skipping off the tee…. Bucket list Legend!!!
Congrats! I am curious as to why you couldn't film it though?
Congrats, happy for you
Love u rick
hope to get a chance to play there some day
🎉🎉🎉
Shame you couldn't film it Rick, but look forward to the shot by shot. What an experience
Congrats. That’s exciting just to be able to walk the grounds there but to actually play is amazing.
Living the dream!
Break 75? 😅
Jealous!
Yo
Amazing! Would love a swag bag Rick!
Shame you couldn’t film but looking forward too the run down
Unreal! Curious what you shot. There’s so many people who speculate what non pros would shoot there.
Every golfers dream...... congrats!
Wow, one of the great bucket list items for any golfer … probably number one on most lists!  Definitely number one on mine!
Congratulations  Rick, what  a dream come true! You deserve it! I can only imagine how you can take in a place like that with all the shot made around that course over the years. Just thinking in backswing, I remember watched Tiger make this shot from here. Damn…. happy for you. Excited to see the pics.
Let's go! Check that off the bucket list!
Augusta needs to get over itself. Not allowed to film. Get real!
Very jealous!! Great stuff Rick!
Butch once described putting at AGC as like dropping your ball in your bath tub, accurate enough?
Pretty much gutted we can’t see the shots! Would love to see what you’d shoot!
You can retire now Rick! You've done it all!!
Can tell how happy you are. Congratulations Rick!
Amazing Rick!
What a course, that must have been one of the best experiences!
fantastic, you lucky lucky sod
A) What an opportunity to play Augusta! Seriously, phenomenal! Glad you hit the ball well B) Well done to Jon Rahm for winning the Masters tournament, I was routing for Rory, bit he got in his head too much on day 1, but congrats to Jon Rahm!
That’s amazing! Glad to see you got to play Augusta l!!
So awesome! Can’t imagine the nerves on the first tee!!
Unbelievable experience for you Rick.
I grew up in Georgia and started playing golf in 1972 at age 12. I’ve been to the Masters twice and no words can describe it. If I actually got to play the course I would have been balling my eyes out.
So envious 😊 but did you break 75? 😉
Yes please
You are a lucky man!! Most of us can only dream of the golf you get to experience. Keep up the good content and I look forward to watching all of your videos.
A true pinch yourself moment!
Amazing brother!
Unreal!
Go off Rick!
Break 75 at Augusta would be impressive?
Keep it up Rick! 🔥
Well done Rick
Congrats on 2.5 million!
Anything for a swag bag from Augusta...  Appreciate your channel and your efforts on behalf of Golfers around the world...
That's amazing! Can't wait for the next update on it. You have 2.5M jealous golfing fans!
Must’ve been a dream come true!
Pick me 😊
Must have been an incredible experience. Looking forward to seeing the results.
What a journey this has been to watch in just a few years. I started watching this channel during COVID and enjoyed Rick's passion for the game, gear reviews and seeing and hearing how much of a cut above even average pros are from seriously good amateur players, and it just got bigger and bigger from there. To think St. Andrews was like a big milestone, and now there's so many big things happening. I see the work and I really respect it.
Disappointed that there's no video, but can't wait to hear the story!
Sawgrass and Augusta in the same year is insane
Every golfer's dream. To once in a life play a round of golf at Augusta National and at the Old Course.
My God Rick, who'd have thought from your junior days at Hart common, that you'd get to play Augusta, ( by the way, you still owe me for SKY MARKING my 3 wood on the first hole😅
Congrats Rick, that’s epic!
Can you do a pictorial of each hole?
Nice one mate Love the channel
Why didn't I get a call?  Great deal!
Nice!
That's awesome. What an experience.
What a shame they would not allow you to film it. I am so jealous that you got to play it, but at the same time over the moon for you.
Amazing and love seeing how truly happy you are to get this opportunity.
Don’t know anyone who deserves this more. Well done Rick
Rick my fathers bucket list is going to the masters, well hes 85 so dont think it will ever happen, however the gift bag would make his year.    Great videos and keep up the awsome content!!
Thats gonne be vid of the year!
Sweet! You are so lucky! A bucket list “check” for sure! My birthday is the first week in April so I’ve always associated it with masters. Easter too but mostly masters lol. Except DJ’s win in nov.2020. Weird haha
Did you break 75? 😉
Wow that would be great
Some of my buddies went down! Looked amazing! Hope it was fun!
Wow, bucket list item checked off. Congratulations!
Boom 🎉
I’m jealous I could give you a shot by shot assessment but I dont think people have that kind of time😮
Congrats on 2.5M subscribers! Great achievement!
The GOAT, I bet you shot 68
Can’t begin to imagine how that round must have felt, awesome
Congrats brother!
Can't wait to hear all about it!
That's excellent, so jealous.  Shame you couldn't film it though, would have loved to have seen that one.  All the best mate, keep up the great content :)
So cool to have played at augusta, every golfers biggest dream
Unreal, glad you had a top time lads!
Awesome! I’m not jealous one bit, I promise 😢😂
You lucky git Rick!
Love it. I’m sure it doesn’t compare to my local parkland course but atleast you had a good knock
I want that swag bag !!!
Congrats Rick! I'm quite jealous.
Unbelievable. What a dream. It is well deserved that you get to play courses like this!
Congratulations! Thats amazing! Great content Rick and team!
Well done Rick . Well deserved 😊
Dawg
Seems excited to announce the score
Give me that swag!
Incredible!!! Congrats Rick!
Love it!
Congrats on playing Augusta Rick! What an awesome experience mate!
Awesome! Can't believe they wouldn't let you take video though. That's pretty lame!
That is the pinnacle of golf achievements
Congratulations Rick!!! So pumped for you that you got to play Augusta.
That’s awesome! Wish there was a video to follow!
Incredible. Living every golfer's dream
What a dream come true for you.    Watching Jon win was awesome.   He's been my favorite golfer since he joined the tour because of his short backswing and calm demeanor.     I have the same kind of short swing due to shoulder flexibility issues, and coaches would always try to lengthen it when i took lessons.  Ruined my swing.    Until Jon came around.    👍
Congrats Rick!  What a dream come true for every golfer.
What an absolutely incredible moment for you both! Can't wait to hear the result!
Play a round with Tiger or always be able to score 75?
Wow, amazing!!! Couldn't be more jealous!!!!
So Dude Perfect can film and run around Augusta throwing around nerf footballs and hitting tennis balls, yet Rick Shiels the most successful golf YouTuber can't go for a round and film? Missed opportunity Augusta National come on...
So jealous
WOW!  Fantastic Rick!
What an experience that must of been. Just a shame you were not allowed to film, can imagine how epic that would of been to watch!
Swag bag baby!!! Need it
Thank you Rick. You inspire me to get back out on the course
Looking forward to your longer wrap up! Must have been amazing🙌🙌
Pleased for you getting the invite, but whats the point of inviting vloggers if they can`t record it?
Great video Rick! Excited to hear about your round.
Next time bring a lucky fan!  Me!
I understand Augusta have very strict rules on filming / content etc. but this is a huge miss on their part not to allow you film how difficult this course is to a good quality (not tour pro) player... it would put respect on the 70 odd golfers that get to play it (some not very well) each year!
Every weekend golfer is living vicariously thru you Rick!!! don't stop!!!
how did he get in?!
Once in a lifetime opportunity, congrats
What an experience to have and we’ll deserved! Thanks for all your help.
Rick what a dream. I'm so glad you got to experience this shame we couldn't get a video but I honestly expected that from the National. Safe travels back across the pond man!
So excited to see the pictures this week!
Great achievement, Rick! Just being there would be special, but playing it?! That’s just nuts… 😮
Was there for the practice round in 2018. Such a beautiful course!
Fantastic experience Rick. So glad you got to tick off one of your bucket list courses.
Sounds like a great time
Absolute dream come true for you! You deserve it, great content as always. 💪🏼💪🏼
Awesome! Well deserved opportunity!
Congrats on this great achievement, Rick .. the culmination of years of hard work. Looking forward to the shot by shot replay!
check that one off the bucket list!
Topboy !!
Congratulations! Looking forward to the updates! Once in a lifetime opportunity! Awesome
CONGRATS RICK! Been following your channel for a while, so glad that you were able to accomplish the dream every golfer has wished for <3
What a dream come true! Congrats!

Omg, video or not, did you break 75?🔥
Unreal! Experience of a lifetime!
Wow Rick!  I had two invitations to play Augusta and didn’t go…. I’ve always regretted that.  You were so close to me, I wish we could have played a round or just had a pint together.  Enjoy all your work on YouTube and look forward to your future videos.  There are many great courses in the South, please come back and play them.
What bucket list round of golf.
This is HUGE Rick! Looking forward to the score update!
Wow glad you managed to play your dream course well done rick
This is actually amazing! It is by far the most immaculate golf course on the planet, and you've done something that all golfers dream about. You could argue that paying Augusta is better than hitting 2.5 million subscribers 😂
So happy 4 you!!! Playing in Augusta is a dream for every golfer!
Dreams can come true!  Congrats
Fantastic, hope you played well
The Golf goat on youtube. Congrats pn 2.5 onto 5 mil next.
No way, Augusta! So awesome Rick, happy for ya!
So pleased for you Rick. To be able to play Augusta National must be one of life’s ultimate dreams. Bet you never imagined your Career  journey would reach such heights when you started coaching and then making a few videos for you tube? The way you keep everything grounded, real and relatable in your posts is the key to the popularity you receive. Clearly this has all become possible because of the hard work and dedication put into making such engaging and enjoyable posts. From a 59 year old 24 handicap, desperately trying to get to 18 this year, I wish you all the success in the coming years. Oh and you were right! Golf is Hard!!…🏌️‍♂️⛳️👍😀
That could not be more awesome Rick! Hoping you played great and had an incredible experience.
Amazing course , hope your score was amazing as well Rick 😂
Amazing Rick, what a dream place to play....cannot wait to know what you scored

what a dream it must've been. can only imagine being so giddy for days
Congratulations. A dream come true.
Unreal! Can't wait. Would love this swag bag to golf country - N.Ireland!
Quality
Augusta pod will be ace!
Congrats Rick! With how much you’ve done for golf you are definitely deserving of this once in a life time opportunity
I’d love to win
so happy you are now including the Iconic courses here in the states. Hope to see Pebble and Torey in the future as well.
Absolutely unbelievable
Congrats on being able to make a dream of millions of people come true for you, and hold on to those memories for as long as possible. Not many people will be able to say they get to have those memories of playing the world's most prestigious course... and with a friend. Cheers!
What a dream!
So jealous! Glad you got the opportunity!
This is absolutely incredible Rick!
Class. Would have been a great video!
So Jelly.  Congrats and lucky you!
Sooooooooo jealous of you Rick!  I was able to score tickets through the Master's draw for Sunday back in 2018 (and went of course), but to PLAY the course would be an absolute dream come true!  I can see your excitement and rightfully so.  I look forward to hearing the rest.  Travel safe going home.
Guessing this won't be part of the "Break 75" series 😆
I can only imagine how hard it must b to play esp putting but what a dream to have a go
You lucky bugger congrats
You are one lucky SOB 😂
Well deserved after years of great content, too bad you weren’t allowed to film though. But I get it, the snobbery on private courses in America is on another level, it’s not like St.Andrews where any bozo are allowed to do almost anything the like.
That’s awesome man, can’t wait to hear how the round went
To be jealous is an understatement. Super happy you got to visit the Mecca!
Rick, that is an amazing opportunity. I'm sure you probably didn't want it to end. Too bad there can't be a Break 75 video but can't wait to hear the details in your podcast! What was your favorite hole?
What a Masters Experience Rick. Best trip af the year :-D
Wow. Congrats!
Fantastic privilege.
Incredible! Love it!
That's is unbelievable Rick!, I'm very jealous. That has to be a bucket list check box right there.
I played at Harbor Town last year the day after the tournament with the Sunday pins and it was amazing.  I cannot imaging doing that at Augusta.  Congrats!
:)
Congratulations Rick!
It would be amazing to play Augusta but I think for me it would very intimidating lol
Congrats Rick! Some milestone.
At least we get to live vicariously through your content. Very cool opportunity.
Congrats Rick, what a special opportunity for you and your friend!!! A once in a lifetime adventure.
Absolutely class 👏🏾
Well that’s a tick on the bucket list for sure for both of you I’d imagine.  Shame we can’t see the round but understandable with the place that it is. Not jealous at all Rick 😢
Started watching Ricks coaching videos when I started playing 5 years ago. I’m still rubbish and Ricks playing Augusta. Mad how things change
Rick Shiels living the Golf fans DREAM!! God I wish they let him film!
Looks amazing, ultimate goals
Wow, what a dream opportunity. One very jealous golfer right here!! Getting my hands on that Augusta swag would absolutely make my day though. Looking forward to seeing what you shot Rick
Friend of mine was there to watch the first round and he echos your sentiment that tv does not do it justice...just a magical place!
Soo good!
Congrats, Old course and Augusta two of the most desired courses to play in the world. Now what Pebble? Just Congrats man super jealous.
Very cool, congratulations. Some day when in the USA you should come down to Fl and we can play one or more of our 55 courses here at The Villages Fl.
Jealous, me? Not a bit, no, not even in the slightest.
What I would give to play Augusta! Wow!
Atta boy Rick!! Luhvleh!!!
Great opportunity - glad you enjoyed it!
Bummer we can't watch a video of this!  But congrats on being able to play it.  I know that was on your bucket list (per the interview with Sir Faldo).  Looking forward to that content btw.  Great idea.
Awesome! Too bad you weren't allowed to film it.
Unreal!!
Class 😁
Congrats Rick. What an experience
Every golfers dream from high handicapper’s down to single figures it’s surely on every golfers bucket list congrats on playing Augusta and the great content you always come up with 👍

Unfortunate that we don't get a Break 75 here, but there would be no way to ever top that video.
Too bad you couldn’t film, but still glad you got to play and share with us!
Wow augasta is a dream! Congrats rick
Fantastic, opportunity of a life time
So jealous -  even with the weather this weekend, the course looked amazing!
Can't wait for the updates on your experience!
You deserve it Rick! Amazing!
Well done Rick!! Once in a lifetime experience for sure. Happy you were able to knock it off the bucket list!  Can’t wait to hear/see more about it.
The Master at The Masters' site! Well deserved, Rick! Can't wait to see your score card! Could it have been the most exhilarating 85 of your career 🙂?
Shame you couldn't film! Would've loved a Breaking 75 at Augusta!
Wow. Can’t wait to hear how you did. Definitely a bucket list item to go to the Masters, but to play…
Disappointing it couldn’t be filmed (but not surprised). Looking forward to the Peter Finch video
Your welcome

Congratulations Rick. I was looking forward to the video. Too bad they didn't allow it.
I hope you broke 75 Rick!
Very cool experience you had. Well deserved.
I can sense and see your emotion. Just awesome.
It would be a Dream to play Augusta. And to do it the day after Masters. high ruff, fast greens... i would prob lose something like 2 dussins of golfballs
So happy for you both. Rick, I live my golf through you & thank you for playing my dream.

The day after was probably gorgeous as well! Tough conditions this year. Congrats!
Congratulations! Massive achievement 🎉
It's an awful pitty you couldn't film it but still a great honor
Jealous. Swag bag please 🙏
Have to know, what fell more? Ricks putts or the trees on 17?
You have made some amazing content love watching. But that must have felt amazing. 😊
I was lucky enough to get tickets to watch a practice round and it was great, can only imagine how exciting it would be to actually get to play.
Great Rick, I am so happy you got to experience that. Keep up the hard work you put in to allow us to share in the wonderful places you get to go. And thanks to your family for sharing you with all of us, I am sure it is not always easy.  By the way I also have struggled with the chipping Yips and I started hitting left hand low on small chips with really tight lies and it has worked beautifully.
What a amazing opportunity!
"They didn't allow video". "I hit one of the best drives of my life down the first hole." I see what you did there.
Well played Rick. Just shows how much you have achieved with being able to play Augusta. Well deserved and keep up the quality content.
Awesome and well deserved, Rick .
So jealous, but well deserved. Go Rick!
Oooo, sounds exciting, what happened to the next 17 holes 😅😅😅…shame you couldn’t film, bit weird, it’s all over not as though your playing before and could be giving up secrets.
You lucky lucky man 👊
Well deserved!
Bet this was amazing. Just got into golf late last year and watched my first golf tournament during this Masters. Was much more fun than anticipated. Cannot wait to get back out golfing again this year and better my swing and get more power.
Congrats. What an opportunity!
A treat of a lifetime. Congrats!!!
But did you enjoy a peach ice cream sandwich during your round??
Rick - you lucky lad; stuff dreams are made of!!!
So happy for you, able to play that course is beyonf all our dreams! Looking forward to hearing  more when you get back.
What a dream come true! It is cool seeing our favorite influencers live out their dream!
Congratulations Rick, can not believe what you have managed to do, it is every golfers dream to play Augusta. You can give up golf now Rick as you have achieved the best thing possible, so jealous 😂
Incredible Rick. You’ve done so well. Much deserved.
What an amazing experience!
What an opportunity. You are very lucky, doing the things most of can only dream of. That being said, it's also extremely cool to watch and listen to yourself and guests and you make these brilliant videos, so we are lucky to be able to watch your journey and adventures you have. Keep up the awesome work, look forward to more break 75's and the upcoming golf bidder challenge. One final thing, congrats on the 2.5 Million subscribers, its well deserved and brilliant content
Amazing experience!
Congrats Rick on being able to play, arguably the most iconic golf courses in the world. Place a check by that bucket list!!!!
Wow!! Well done!
Living the dream!  Congratulations Rick!
I dream about playing there and Peebles Beach.
What an amazing experience that must've been!
Wow!
Can't wait!
Congrats on the opportunity!
Amazing every golfers dream to play and you’re living the dream
Great work Rick!
That's awesome, it explains your giddy smile on your weekly podcast.
Rick's really living the dream my word
Amazing! Just to walk on those fairways and greens must have been surreal.
Lucky Man
ThickD*ckRick energy
Every golfer would give their firstborn to play there.
Wow what a dream, as a 21 handicapper who’s weakness’s are chipping & putting I’d probably shoot 120+ there
That's awesome dude! Congrats!
What dreams are made off 🙌
What an opportunity, I am so happy for you. 🎉
Awesome!! Great content
Augusta the day after The Masters. Talk about a bucket list entry for sure! As difficult as it is there, would be very impressed if either of you broke 90. I'll go with 91 and 95 as my guesses. Swag if both are spot on?
Had the chance to go last year. What a place. Bucket list accomplished.
Dream come true. 1 day you're testing a janky wish driver, the next playing Augusta. 🤙
Love the video's rick!
So happy for you Rick!  been with you since the beginning of your journey and love how you are still the same guy just doing what everyone loves to see!
I am so envious. Glad you had an unforgettable time😊
Very happy for you, Rick. Have had the opportunity to be a patron in the past but getting to play must be a dream come true. Looking forward to hearing about your day.
So awesome!
Very Jealous, hope you enjoyed 👍
What an amazing opportunity. Shame there is no video but completely understandable. Glad you enjoyed and look forward to hearing about it.
Nice
I love your enthusiasm!  AWESOME!
Brilliant that you got to play it, so many jealous golfers watching this now (me included!). Looking forward to the updates and scores!! Keep up the great work.
That's awesome, I hate you. 😂 Seriously, what an awesome experience.
Insane experience - but still stupid they cannot allow you filming.  But hey - I would like to win :)
Congrats on playing and I assume you played well.
I can’t believe you got to play! 😍 congratulations Just wish you could’ve recorded 😢
The fact you said it wasnt clickbait and then proceeded to explain exactly why it IS clickbait is funny! Theres no video on you playing so id say that you baited all of us there sir lol
Love it mate really glad you lived your dream
Wow - Congratulations man. Can you believe it when you started this channel to now..?
Did you beat Jon Rahms score😂
This is epic, Rick! Looking forward to hearing more about the round. Thanks for the great stuff as always!
Extremely lucky. Congrats lad!
Wow!!!
Class Rick. Every golfers dream. Looking forward to hearing the scores
Congratulations, cant wait to listen to the podcast to get the run down
Winning the swag bag would be the closest I could get to playing there. Way to go Rick!
Hope you broke 85 Rick!
jealous
Wow, what an honor to be able to play there!
Can’t wait for this Rick!!! This is every golfer’s dream.
shame no video but looking farward to hearing about it
What an amazing golfer’s dream experience 💯💯💯
Wow, that is amazing!!  I was so blessed to be in attendance this Sunday and just checked off my biggest bucket list item in my life.  It was the greatest feeling seeing the leaderboard as I walked out of the shaded trees and seeing the 1st tee box in front of me.  To say I was emotional would be an understatement.  My eyes slowly teared up out of sheer join to see the hallowed grounds I have watched on tv for almost 50 years now.  I can't imagine the feeling of actually playing on that magnificent course, it must have been an out of body experience.  Very lucky man and you will treasure that moment for life.  It truly is a very special place.
The Dream.
Really looking forward to seeing it Rick
You’re the man Rick.   Totally saved my golf game. Great content.   As we say in America   Wassssuppp Rick!
Congratulations! Keep up the great work!
Cannot wait to hear how it was in your words.  We want all the details :)
I wish I was you… greetings from Holland!
Amazing Rick! Pick me for that swag!
2.5 million! What a journey!
Looking forward to the video later in the week! Congrats on 2.5M Rick, well deserved ⛳️
Unbelievable accomplishment on the 2.5M subs, and of course this remarkable experience!
Amazing!
Amazing! Excited to hear more!
Nice. A shame you couldn't film it.
Congrats Rick! What an amazing opportunity and life experience.
Incredible!
So lucky! Would be easy to shoot a million around there, especially with Masters speed greens. Looking forward to some decent weather in Ohio so I can finally get some practice in
You played Augusta in tournament condition.  That puts you in the .001% of humans to have done so.  Both jealous and happy for you.  Can you throw a couple green and clear cups in that goodie bag too?  They are equally, highly, sought after.
Quality! Peaked at golf now!
Playing Augusta is the one thing every golfer strives for. Yes there is St Andrews, yes there is Pebble Beach. But in theory, all of them are available to play. Augusta is the one candy we cant have - which makes it even more desirable
So jealous Ricky!
Congrats
Congrats Rick!
well deserved, a man can dream
So cool. Good for you 🍻
So jealous!  Can't wait to see your score card, shame there will be no video, but pictures will have to suffice
What a legend, can’t wait to hear all about it on the podcast.
That is a golfers dream come true, happy for tou
Way to Go Rick!!! Great Stuff!
Wauw, that most have been epic! What a shame you could'nt film the round, but i bet the story will be told to future grandkids (:  Like i have said before you deserve it all, thank you Rick!
Lucky Lucky...people 🏌‍♂️
Wow, that is very cool. Congrats. What did you shoot?
I’d love to play that course. But I’ll take the swag bag as consolation 😂
Amazing!
Livin the dream!
Amazing! You may as well never play another game. Can’t get any better than that place!!!
St Andrews in reverse and Augusta! not jealous at all 🤣Class! keep the content coming!
Absolutely brilliant! Looking forward to the run down!
I love it!!  Congrats Rick!  You deserve all the success you are having!
So cool!
Cool. So Jealous 🙃
Is this part of Rick's break 95 series..???
What a dream come true to be able to play that spectacular course. How very fortunate.
Someday I hope to just visit Augusta. I can't even imagine playing there! Congrats!!
Would love some swag Rick!!!
Rick, what you're doing for the game is golf is great. We all truly appreciate what you're doing!
That's awesome

Unreal.
Happy for you Rick. Love your videos.
I'm so jealous. What a round that must have been for you both. A true 'bucket list' tick in the box. Top man

I'm too jealous. But someone needs to tell me how Seb managed to get in on that. Rick 2.5m subs, Seb 143k subs.....
You can see the raw excitement in that video. Looking forward to hearing the score and the details.
Great vid Rick
Rick Shiels crew checkin in
👏
No video? Augusta needs to let it go. Just saying.
Living the dream for any golfer to play there, and congrats on the 2.5m! :)
Amazing!  It’s every golfers dream. Although I gotta say I think playing St Andrews is more within reach for me. 😂🤣😂
Congrats, Rick! Can't imagine getting to play Augusta!
Living the dream Rickieeh!
Well done mate!! You deserve all these opportunities that come your way!! Keep up the great content
Even at my level I’m so jealous!  Looks like you had a blast.

Congrats! I'd love to play there one day.
Congratulations, Rick! Looking like a kid in a candy shop. Took the day after the Masters Sunday to get myself fitted for the first time.. told myself I would do it when I break 80 for the first time and I just did that a week ago. Thanks for all the great content, podcast included, and best wishes for continued success!
Too bad they didn't allow videos :(
It must have been a huge dream come true to play that course and I hope that I also will be able to play it someday!
awesome!
That is the one golfcourse i want to play, every year i watch the masters
Lucky you ricky boy! Congrats
What, no break 75?
Lucky you :)
Please can you take me next time rick? 😊
Wow lucky guys!!! Unrealisable bucket list for millions of us ,cant wait to watch it!!
Just a thought; what was the sausage roll like at Augusta?
Awesome
Congrats Rick! The pinnacle of the sport
Wish I could try the course someday 😅
Man I’m jealous, what a beautiful course, would love it if you helped a older guy out with the gift!!
Rick created as good of a life as any could hope for and it couldn’t have happened to a more genuine person.
Awesome, congratulations. I was there Monday and Tuesday and it was incredible.
That is huge Rick!!! Super stoked for you! really wish we could have got a video of the round but just knowing you got to play it is good enough for me.
That’s freaking amazing good stuff I’m so happy for you 🙌🏻
Congratulations! You've really hit the big time, now. I'm sure it was everything all of us have dreamed of!
this swag bag is mine !! ;) congrats man
Congrats, Rick!  Can't wait to see the outcome!
I had a ball marker for Augusta, and by mistake I gave it to a playing partner, and did not realise the mistake I made until much later, totally gutted. Never got it back😢😢😢😢😢
Best job ever Rick, living every man’s dream 🏌🏻‍♂️
Absolutely amazing!! I am extremely jealous!! You're very lucky Rick!
Greatest tradition in golf!
Was Patrick Cantlay still out there?? Looking forward to what you shot and your stories about Heaven on Grass! Best from NJ! T.

I could use some masters swag! I'm so bad at golf I lost 2 balls in the golf ball washer!
Amazing experience and I am sure very humbling.
Congrats Rick! Sounds like a dream come true!
Think this might be the happiest you have ever looked. Must have been sensational
If that is not a bucket list item checked off, I don't what is! Well done Rick!
To hit one of your best drives of your life on the first hole..... I think you can die a happy man now! hhaha
🙌
A break 75 of Augusta would have been amazing. Hopefully they allow it next year for you :)
Awesome!
epic
Know idea how you managed to play Augusta, especially right after the masters competition. Did you break 75?
Unbelievable Rick well done
Ah so cool! Happy for you man!
Awesome opportunity. I hope it was everything you expected.

So we’ll deserved Rick!! Both the round and the 2.5m subs! Hopefully we’ll one day get to see a Break 75 at Augusta⛳️🏌️‍♂️
Interested in hearing how many putts it took you to get around the course. Have had the pleasure of going to the Masters many times and those greens are just incredible.
Would love the swag Rick!

Of course Rick hits his best ever drive when there's no video evidence 😂 maybe recreate it for us at one of the UK's Augusta mimic courses 👀👀

I went to the Masters in 2019. Went on Thursday and Sunday. Such an amazing experience. We got in early enough to get our chairs on the ropes of 18 on Sunday. Got to see Tiger Putt Out to win. I never want to go back there again, to preserve that memory 😅. Glad you got to play the course!
Sweet
Every golfers dream!!!
That's so amazing! Congrats Rick wish we could've watched the whole round
Dream come true. I’d love to play a round with both you and Seb!! The wealth of knowledge guys have plus playing Augusta. Dang I can’t wait to see the pictures on Wednesday!!!

Congrats on the opportunity to play at Augusta
Congrats Rick, that’s sick!!!
It’s too bad you couldn’t film I’d love to watch the full video!

Awesome..what a great experience
Unbelievable!!! What a once in a lifetime opportunity 🥹
I was sure this was clickbait :) Was waiting for you to be playing on a simulator. Nice one.
so bummed there will not be video of the round.
It's always been a dream of mine to play there but I doubt that will ever happen, but I'll settle for Masters tickets instead, I sign up every year!
Since you are the King of YouTuber Golfers you should take the Lead and do a Youtube Golfers Tournament with like the top 16 Golfers and compete for the Best YouTube Golfer. That would be Must see Presentation if you are using your Camera Crew. YouTuber or someone like them should Sponsor it. Would be cool to see..
Congrats to 2,5 million followers, well deserved. You have taught me so much. You are the absolutely best golf youtuber, and you really deserve to play at Augusta National Golf Club.
Well done. What an experience
Such a shame they don’t let you film, they need to get with the times. I’d definitely buy into the Masters more if I had a feeling what a shot-by-shot round of golf looked like out there and could truly understand the shape of course etc. Maybe one day… Great work Rick and the team on a superb channel
Amazing!  Congrats!
Nice one Rick! Absolutely amazing experience!
CONGRATS RICK!!!!! Incredible opportunity

considering there is no phones or cameras allowed, and the public isn't allowed to play, ,this is clickbait
Even I, a 33 handicapper of 1 and a half Year’s experience, would want to play Augusta National. Never would do it justice but still.....nice one Rick! Can’t wait to hear your thoughts about it.
There was a hint of this when you went speechless during a podcast a few weeks ago. Media Monday is one of the toughest and prized things to do at The Masters. It's usually a lottery- but in your case the 'Fix was in' thanks to Mercedes. I'm sure... So now, 2.5 million people hate you and are jealous at the same time!
Hell Yes , Congrats!
Congrats! Can’t wait for you to give context of the course for the non tour golfers
Number 1 bucket list course crossed off the list. Insane you got to play there

Congrats on playing Augusta!  Bucket List!
Would love that lil goody bag
So exciting!  Thank you for all you do for the golfing community around the world!!  Can't wait to see and hear more about this experience.
Amazing update mate, already high jealousy levels are now through the roof!
Must be a dream come true playing at Augusta. Might never seen Rick this exited after a round of golf. Keep up the good stuff Rick!
Congrats on getting to play.  That’s truly amazing! Can’t wait to see the shot by shot update
The English Jon Rahm
Absolute dreams right there
Just found your channel last week and I am loving the content and can not wait to get on the course this season!!!!!!!!!!!!
would love that
Unbelievable stuff! Shame there’s no video allowed but that’s why it’s a magical place, definitely on the bucket list
Every golfers dream to play there!!  Congrats on 2.5 mill!!! Huge achievement!!
Congrats Rick on playing Augusta, that is a bucket list wish that most people will not complete.
Every golfers dream! Lucky lucky guys 👏🏻
Congrats on an incredible achievement!
Congrats on the 2.5m Rick, what a Masters that was - now gimme that swag!
Incredible!
What I wouldn't give to have see a break 75 video from Augusta. I respect their rules, but damn :(
What an experience Rick. Well done. Bucket list
How amazing Rick you look really happy there. You have achieved what most of us only dream about. Look forward to your full report - wonderful experience for you, well done 👍😁😎
A golfers dream! Congratulations.
83 Is my guess.
Mate I bet your buzzing after that ! Keep up the great content!!
You are the envy of so many YouTube golfers right now
How do you top this one Rick? Maybe a trip to Northwood GC and Cypress, I think you should hit the 36 Alister MacKenzie courses in a year. Well maybe 35 cause you just played the most elusive.
Augusta is one of my Bucket List Courses ( won't ever happen probably). Played Pinecrest #2 for my 70th Birthday last June 2022. My Wife surprised me with the trip. I love watching your videos. Hopefully doing Pebble Beach in 2024 and St. Andrews in 2025 (my other two Bucket List Courses..
Congrats Rick. I know this has been a dream of your for a very long time. Guy must be so jealous
Love this channel!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Your driver has been on point lately, really wish we could have watched you playing the round but just to see how excited you are was a win!  Glad you enjoyed the experience Rick
That’s actually so sick what a dream
What an experience that must’ve been! Congrats, Rick!
Opportunity of a lifetime! Can't wait for Wednesday!
My daughter and I were there Tuesday... It really was an amazing experience. Sorry I missed seeing you.
Awesome!
That is the ULTIMATE dream for any golfer.
It was a good year to make it to the Masters!
I've just begun to "play" golf, and for now it's mainly blood, sweat, tears and soil (and some whispered curse every now and then). Kudos to Rick for motivating me not to throw my clubs in the pond of hole #6! Keep on, Rick! Thanks for giving me a spark of hope 🙂
Shame you weren't allowed to film, but since the patrons aren't allowed to have a phone during the tournament that does make sense
Bro is out here living our dreams
Congrats Rick!
#completedgolf
Mad mad mad!! Love it!
What an unbelievable experience 👏👏
Delighted for you Rick no one deserves it more. Ps no need to post the swag bag just drop it off when you go to play adare manor 😊

I’d very much like to win.
This sounds like a wonderful experience and how very fortunate to play there right after the Masters when the course is in pristine condition. Sounds like you had a great time and look forward to the breakdown of your round.
That’s awesome!
Break 75 at Augusta? 👀
Awesome pal. What a dream come true.
You got me into golf. Only been playing for 1.5 years. Buzzing for you both.

Looking forward to the hole by hole video!!! Nice one rick!
Congrats on living all of our dreams, king.
It must have been amazing to play. I always feel extra excited to play golf after a major.
sooo jealous ;-) Hope you guys broke 80 - as a scramble ;-))
What a treat. Break 75?
Insane! Well deserved with all the effort you put in for these videos
Fantastic opportunity
Happy for you Rick...can see why you were so distracted on that podcast.
Incredible! Can't wait to hear the breakdown
Absolutely incredible! For the privileged few!
Unbelievable! Such a shame you couldn't film a break 75 there!
Fantastic...know you loved it, Thanks for sharing.
Ultimate dream of every golfer. It’s great that we at least get to share in it with you. Thanks for all the great content.
Amazing! Happy for you Rick
Loved it!
Awesome, love the content 🍻
Sooooooo jealous but that's one off you're bucket list can't wait to see the pics!!!! And congrats for the 2.5 million
Genuine bucket list stuff.   You’ll be telling friends, family and probably just about everyone you ever meet about that round for years!!
What a honour to play there living the golf dream
It’s incredible! Happy for you
Dream come true
Well done Rick on all fronts. Really jealous!
Congratulations Rick! A bucket list item that not too many golfers will ever be able to tick! Could always hear it in your voice on your podcast that this course was your white whale. I hope you smashed it, pal.
Stuff of dreams
Too bad you didn't get to film on the course - I recommend visiting Iceland in the summer, play some midnight golf and film it 🙂
You lucky dog! That has to be one off the Bucket List!!!! Congrats on 2.5 Million! ⛳️🇨🇦
Love to hear if you had any of those iconic moments - feeding down the tier on 16 like Jack, running it to the flag on 2 like Oosthuizen, bringing it back to the flag on 18 like Sandy. Did you ever feel like you were reliving a moment you'd grown up seeing on TV? Looking forward to it!
Incredible Rick!
Wow!! Extremely jealous. 🔥
Living the dream! So jealous!
What a dream round congratulations
Wow Ricks really the 🐐 wish they could’ve filmed a break75 but look forward to hearing about it!
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
always great content Rick, keep doing you ;)
Looking forward to Break75 round Augusta!
oh baby, can't wait to hear about it.
I would love to play there. But I bet there's a handicap that you have to prove
I just want to point out I nor anyone else here is jealous of this 😂
I wanna win that masters drip, that’s all
What an AMAZING OPPORTUNITY! Can't wait to hear about it, Congrats Rick!
An experience most can only dream of. Happy for you, and maybe one day I'll get there too
Wow,,, can’t really say much more than that,, Lucky Lucky man
Hell yeah!!
Must have been a dream come true. I guess the experience alone of playing the course, makes you get an idea how good the likes of Rahm, Koepka, Mickelson are
Sounds amazing Rick. A once-in-a-lifetime experience
Love that you guys got to play!
Wow, Rick!  What a surprise. I'm sure that was the round of a lifetime! I'd love to hear what your favorite shot was.
What an experience for you. Golfing heaven right there.Keep up the great work. PS - would love a Masters swag bag!
Congrats Rick! For the rest of us, we will continue to play “how much would you be willing to pay to play Augusta?”
I look forward to the recap of your round .

Wow Rick, that's wonderful! Every golfers dream. I have shared your site with my son, grandson, brother and golfing comrades. While that only makes up about 20 out of your 2.5M subscribers we are all big fans! Keep up the great work!
What a dream come true, absolutely incredible opportunity!

Incredible!
This is awesome!!!! It’s a bummer you couldn’t video but I’m not shocked by that.
Amazing!
wow what an experience
Nic3
Bravo Rick.
ANGC not allowing you to film your round is a bit pathetic on their part really. It's not as if it's some secret course we've never seen before. Shame they're not as open and accommodating as St Andrews for example. Just adds to the Augusta exclusivity and myth I suppose.
Lucky fella, you must have been buzzing. Maybe not suitable for a break 75! 😂😂
Absolute amazing rick. Every golfers dream. Respect to Augusta for their no video policy
Great job rick keep up the great work mate. From Perth Australia
Wow incredible gotta see it
Congratulations Rick one of your dreams has come,true what’s your next dream keep up the good work love your channel.
Congrats and very nice for a top bloke to have been abe to play ar a special place that not everyone gets the chance to go to and watch let alone place there, so happy you got to play a round good sir
Lucky man, shame there’s no video but can’t wait to hear how you got on!!
Hell of an achievement to play there Rick 👏🏻 Congrats on 2.5 Million as well
This is awesome! I love the excitement!
Congrats on 2.5M subs Rick and getting invited to play on a course we all dream of playing - your hard work and enthusiasm for the game inspires us all! Well done sir!
That's nothing.  I played Hart Common.

Congrats Rick! I'm not jealous...
Nice one Rick 👍
Because the course is in such good shape the pictures look fake! lol
love the content keep it up!
Congrats Rick, get a big tick next to Augusta on the bucket list!!!
I’d love to have watched it! Swag bagggg!
Wat to go, Rick! Dream come true.
I bet it played harder than the tournament days as there was no rain Sunday night.
Well done Rick. Glad you enjoyed it 🎉
Proper jealous! Pick me!
I'm in awe! Can't wait for the vid and just subscribed to your podcast channel!
It's not Augusta National but I've played East Lake and the nerves on the first tee are crazy.   Congrats on your awesome day.  Can wait to see the recap!
Congratulations Rick, the opportunity to play Augusta is few and far between! Super jealous haha!
Love the videos ! Keep it up !
Congrats on the 2.5mil subs! Also loving the content

Amazing Rick!  Congrats on the experience of a lifetime!
Beyond crazy, come so far, congrats Rick
Love your videos keep up the good work
Congrats!
Rick!! You were so close to Charlotte NC! Stop by Quail Hollow some time!
You are loving the dream of every golfer Rick! We love it!!
Way to go Rick.!!!
How much BS is this, you can not show any videos. Elitist BS!
We gotta get Agusta to let someone film please
Shame there’s no footage, congrats at any rate!
The sad part here is the historically racist, bigoted good old boy venue this place has Even to the name of the tournament holding to this tragic history The willingness of the good old boys to embrace change still offers concern No black player until 1975. Not female member until 2012 Just look at the fans at the tournament. Very few of color Until this venue embraces without bias everyone I could care less about it The PGA has listed this venue as one of the MAJORS in professional sports. Sadly, the PGA and its players have not taken a strong stand for change of this venue
Couldn’t be more thrilled for you. Once in a lifetime experience, I’m sure. In fairness, I don’t deserve your swag as I was at the Monday practice round, so make sure you’re picking someone else! Happy for you, Rick!
This is Christmas for any person who loves golf. Your joy is my joy, Rick. It's almost like I was there too. Sad you can't see video.
Shame we couldn’t see the hits and misses !
Unbelievable, what an experience for you!
Amazing stuff. Congratulations, Rick. Smashing it
Must have been a dream come true to play that course, very jealous. Well done Rick
Mannnnnn life goal achieved !!!
Amazing!! One can only dream of playing Augusta❤
You lucky bugger! Looks like you enjoyed it.
Chance of a lifetime!! Happy for you!! Can always use more masters swag:)
Experience of a lifetime for sure! Congrats Rick!
Luckiest man alive 😂 you work hard so you deserved it
I think you might have enjoyed that !!!! Looking forward to seeing the full report and in particular how the hell you even managed to get on the course! Although I doubt you will reveal that as then you will have 2.3 million followers all seeking the same route!!  Safe flight home and I wonder if you will ever stop smiling !!
Not sure how you can ever top this Rick ? Congratulations, and just keep on doing what your doing, making people love golf more.
Well done 👏
What an opportunity.  Congrats!
Congrats on 2.5M and the ultimate experience at Augusta!
Awesome achievement 🙌
Every golfer's bucket list course. Delighted it lived up to expectations. Looking forward to seeing your scorecard.
Such a big goal for anyone to play there. Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations. Great content and jealous of playing Augusta!
🎉🎉
What an experience, could see the elation in yours and Sebs faces as everyone who plays the game knows, you’ve hit the pinnacle by playing it 👏⛳️
One word. JEALOUS!
Can’t imagine how that must have felt walking up to tee off on the first hole. What a privilege
Well Done Rick. I have had the pleasure of being onsite, but not the privilege of playing. Congrats Mate!
Amazing. Wouldn't know what to do if I got the chance to talk a walk around there.
I hate you couldn't film it! Would loved to have seen you play it shot for shot.
That is amazing 🎉
looking forward to seeing how you played!
Congratulations rick
What an amazing experience!
Congratulations.  I can even imagine how that must have felt.  Thanks for making great content...and....for fixing my slice :)
Your enthusiasm is sooo contagious, and I am not a good golfer,,,,but I have a dream , 😂, ..
You are one very lucky boy. As they say, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Looking forward to hearing the blow by blow account⛳🏌️‍♀️
I need that swag bag!
Leave a comment 🎉
Tick that one off your bucket list. Congrats on 2.5m.
Can't imagine how difficult the greens must have been the day after tournament play! Can't wait for the follow up video.

F*****g Awesome!
You are one lucky guy. Must have been incredible.
Your a lucky boy how did you manage this ?

Congratulations Rick! It has been incredible to follow you since i started playing golf a year ago. Thank you so much for all The tips  and the inspiration!😃🏌🏻‍♂️
Congrats Rick, all the hard work, yards walked and content created have rewarded you with that moment. In a way not being able to film it (although it would have made an amazing video) would of allowed you to really take a step back and breath the moment in, realise how far you've come and given you even more energy to wanna continue smashing it! Well Done! Totally deserved!
So jealous but if any public figure deservesa chance to play there for their contribution to golf and contributions us  every day golfers its you. Well done and 👏 👏👏
Great stuff.
Lets go Rick! love to see the growth top golf entertainer zero doubt
Amazing news, what a tick off on the bucket list.  Shame no video content though
that's amazing congratulations you have come so far, can't wait for the pictures of you playing Augusta i can only imagine the history you could feel on every hole.
Epic.
Jealous doesn't even come close to this Rick.
Shame you couldn't video it, maybe your team could do animations to show where your shots landed etc on each hole.
That's unreal. What an honor to play Augusta
Bet you couldn’t believe you got to play around Augusta! Congrats on all the hard work and hopefully that 3mil subscribers is hit this year
what a dream came true rick!
I love it!  Congrats. Sounds awesome!  Can't wait for your shot by shot recap.
Awesome! Congrats!
Congratulations Rick! Where does Augusta rank in your top courses played?
Congrats Rick...round of a lifetime!
Congratulations Rick on not only golfing Augusta but 2.5 million subscribers WOW😮. YOU deserve every one of them. You’ve done very well Buddy. I followed you forever and you’ve changed my game as well as my attitude towards golf. Cheers Rick. Again. Well deserved.
What amazing round that would be for anyone to do nice one Rick

The round everyone wants to experience. Jealousy levels off the scale. Can’t wait to see the score video. 🎉
Too bad you weren't allowed to film...
See guys, dreams do come true!
It's official, Rick has to be the best You Tube channel
I have been in the lotto for ticks for 20 years and have never even set foot on the grounds. You don't know how fortunate you are!
Really happy for you Rick! What an experience that must have been, one that you won’t ever forget, shame you couldn’t video it,

So cool! Can only hope I get the chance one day
Congratulations!  That's fantastic.  How did you get to play Augusta National?  Please do tell!!
Awesome Rick! What an experience!
You really are living the dream ! 😍 love the content 👌
But how???
You must be the most luckiest guy now on earth. Just had the chance to play Tour18 in Houston, TX couple of years ago where I could play a replica of  Amen Corner. That already was an incredible experience. However, I am so happy for you that you have received this privilege
Fair play Rick, shame we can’t get a video out of it but amazing to see you get the chance to play such an iconic course! Every golfers dream!
Wow !! Be such an amazing experience Rick. Need to come to aus asap !!
lt's all downhill from here you can't get any higher. Congradulations

Absolutely ridiculous! So deserved Rick!
Come on the boysssss
Amazing opportunity well done sir
I'm so jelly lol
Congrats on your 2..5 million subscribers and being able to play this epic course!
I was out playing golf with my brother a month ago and talking about some of your recent videos. I said to him, I bet you he's going to play Augusta this year, somehow. I just have a feeling about it. Delighted for you, Rick. Truly the #1 item on every golfer's dream list. Too bad filming wasn't allowed but I doubt any device would have been able to capture the memories as they happened.
So happy for you Rick! Can't wait to see the update!
Awesome!
Love your videos!
Yessir Rick love to hear it my man…much deserved!!!
Thanks for continuing to share these incredible experiences!
Not jealous at all.
What a crazy experience!

Good shit
Dream Course
Congrats on 2.5m! How was the 3 putt after you smoked the drive on the 1st! Haha
Amazing 👏
Swag bag
Amazing Rick, definitely a bucket list experience for any golfer :)
Way cool!
Amazing opportunity Rick, that is one you can cross off the bucket list. Not jealous in the slightest :)
Very cool! Did Augusta National let you on for marketing or were you playing as a guest?
masters gear pleaseeeee
Congrats - did you beat Sandy Lyle’s second round score?  If so, what an achievement
Awesome Rick
I cannot even imagine what this must have felt like! The ultimate bucket list course!
Well done Rick. Awesome stuff. Can’t wait to watch your video detailing your round at ANGC.
The tournament lived up to expectations and more, more importantly how was the sausage roll half way round 😅
Fantastic experience Rick and Seb, a big achievement off the bucket list! 👏🏌‍♂️⛳️
This is epic! Congrats
You are a blessed man. Congrats on a fantastic achievement and sharing with us.
Unreal🔥
Man that’s nothing short of a dream!!!
Awesome stuff! Hitting bombs at Augusta!
It was just a case of when you played this course and not if, well done Rick you are the envy of every golfer!
🎉🎉🎉 well done.. love your energy.. you must have played well😂😂 ⛳⛳
Become a famous and everything in life comes for free :D good luck to play Augusta as a newbie youtuber or amateur golfer...
Great! You deserve it!
Awesome for you Rick! Couldn't be happier for you! Congrats on the 2.5 million 🎉
Genuinely happy for you Rick! Hard work pays off!
Rick you achieved every serous amateur golfers dream  playing the masters course wow.
🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️
Glad that you had the chance to play Augusta National.  I had the fortunate opportunity to go, my one and only time, back in 1987 on Sunday.  We watched Larry Mize chip in to beat Greg Norman for the championship…just amazing!
Wow. Two lucky guys
Can't wait to hear the entire rundown, so jealous!
EPIC!   A bucket list for any golfer.
You lucky boy Rick. Very jealous. Shame you couldn’t film it as would of been great to see a full round from the players POV. Look forward to hearing about it.
Congratulations, I love swag.
In a summary: Jealous…
Dream stuff that Rick
This is elite! Achieved every golfers dream. Congrats
Thankbyou for sharing your insights and talents with us. Glad you got to fulfill all golfers dream day.
Crazy how much more open The Masters is getting with letting people in and experience. Happy hard work has paid off for Rick and Seb
😮😮😮😮
Awesome to be able to play there, that’s my dream to be able to play there
Bloody jealous. Looking forward to the podcast…
Holy smokes, Augusta National! Well done, Rick!
Legend
Once and a life time chance to play that course
This is probably the toughest achievement in all of golf, congratulations 🎉
Amazing!!!!!
Tell me Rick would this be an amateurs dream or a nightmare to have 18 holes in such an iconic venue 🙂
Fantastic!! Looking forward to the full video!!
how will you ever appreciate a different golf course
That is so cool Rick. The round of a lifetime. Your excitement is authentic. Can't wait to see the other video.
Amazing Rick!
You came so far great Chanel Rick , thanks all your content 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Hopefully you can draw the shots on a courseguide for us to see!
Fantastic! Did you break 75? Good on ya mate!
That's a dream come true right there Rick. I don't think I can imagine what it would be like to play there on that hallowed turf, nerves would be off the charts 🤣 Would still jump at the chance.
What did you shoot 😂
?
Nothing will compare going forward for sure
Can't believe you played Augusta ⛳ ... Right after Master's! Can't wait to hear play by play ▶
looked easy on TV....??? hahaha jk
Magnificent cant wait for the update.
dream course
Why didn’t the jerks let you film it? How bloody pretentious. That’s just one reason why it will never carry the meaning nor value of The Open Championship. The Augusta National people are a bunch of prudes.
I am so jealous and not afraid to admit it!!!!
Your flying Rick, congrats
So happy for you Rick I live here in Augusta and went on Thursday for the first round! So happy for you. What a dream it is to play that course. Couldn’t have happened to a better person!
Very cool, Rick!
Awesome course!!
Congratulations, ever golfers dream.
Did you beat Rory? 🙂
Luvvvly jubbly
I played Adare Manor last July it is said to be the Augusta of Europe - it was stunning - would love to see you compare..
Incredible work Rick, you are very deserving of this opportunity. Done amazing things for the world of golf and one of the reasons I picked up my first golf club at the age of 34. Thanks
Great opportunity Rick! Happy for you!
That’s unreal! Super jealous!
Unreal. Shame there's no video
The masters 👌
That’s unreal! Super jealous!
They should let you film it... Why Augusta WHYY??????
Superb 🙌
Congrats on the milestone man! Definitely a dream of every golfer to do this. Happy for you!
So awesome!
What an un believable experience rick
I am so jealous 🤣🤣
2.5 M !!! OMG, congrats man
The dream...
Congratulations on playing Augusta!!🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️
Bucket list stuff! Looking forward to the podcast…
The chance of a lifetime Rick! I hope you soaked in every shot on every hole. I’m guessing there were more than 75 of them 😅. Cheers mate
Cannot believe you got to play it! 2.5 million well done Rick amazing content as always. I cannot wait to see Guys reaction to this on the podcast!
Incredible. Not a single golf influencer that deserves this more
If you want to read the Gospel then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. I put this because in Acts 1:8 it says “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” so I put this to do what The Lord says. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
congratulations Rich, you deserve it.....now gimme that swag bag :)
Wow, what a privilege. Poor Guy, he is missing out on all the fun. You need to bring him along.
Great video!
Awesome news and looking forward to seeing your round. Massive congratualtions on the 2.5M subscribers
It makes me happy how happy you are! Congrats on the once in a lifetime experience
Can not wait to see the score card and update on how hard it is :-)
What an honor and privilege! Something the majority of us will never get the chance to do. But love and appreciate the content. God Bless man!
Looks amazing!
Playing Augusta national is something special
Why the hell they are not allowing filming???
I'm not jealous, not at all. Good work, lad!
Congrats on getting onto that course.  Such a bucket list item that none of mear mortals will get to do!
Makes no sense for them to forbid filming!  It’s not like 1000’s of cameras were just there!
Swag baby!
Well done, happy that you have been do this. Thanks for your content and for how honest you are about this incredibly frustrating, yet exhilerating game.
This was my guess when you stopped the podcast for some big news. Bucket list event. Glad you enjoyed it so much and looking forward to seeing the shot by shot video!
U just got to do what all golfers dream of
Amazing 👏 ❤
Could you have imagined when you started making videos years ago that it would have propelled you to the point your at now being able to play agusta?
SWAG
That must have been amazing! One day they might let you shoot a break 75 there 😂
I should’ve figured they wouldn’t let you film… it would likely have been the series finale of Break 75 😂
If you lay the sod over a chip did you get to keep the turf?
Congratulations, Rick, you absolutely deserve it. I've been watching for years, and the channel keeps getting better and better. Keep up the great content. 🎉
Unbelievable, great stuff!
So jealous. Congratulations on playing Augusta
What a dream come true! Good for you, Rick!
Great content Rick, thanks for a great channel!  Congratulations on playing Augusta!
Wish we could get the video! But brilliant for you!
Awesome, very envious and looking forward to hearing if you broke 75!
What a great opportunity, I’m truly jealous
Lucky man! Congrats!

Amazing Rick. So lucky once in a lifetime opportunity. 😮
Unfortunate we won't get to see it, but glad you played well, big Rick!
Let’s go… goals!
That so awesome!! So guttered you didn’t get to film that. Would have happily watch a 2 hr episode of break 75 around Augusta! Just from your voice you could feel how happy you guys were just being on the course!
@chippewasquare I was fortunate to be at all four days of the Masters '77. Can only imagine the thrill of playing the course. It will always be high on the bucket list despite the fact a round at ANC probably impossible.Thanks for sharing the excitement Rick
And life was never the same again.
Congrats Rick, for all that you've done for golfers on YouTube... You deserve it 👍
That would have been an amazing experience! Not sure I'd fancy tackling those greens!
Absolutely fabulous Rick to say we are all envious is an understatement. Congrats 🥳 reaching 2.5 million subscribers may you long continue. 👍
Looking forward to seeing the scorecard Rick!
You lucky lucky man hope you enjoyed every second of it what a fantastic honor to play augusta national 👏
JELOUS😢
Been a long time subscriber since before you had a million subs. Super happy for all your success Rick !
Congrats Rick!
Swag bag 💼
Dick move on Augusta's part for not letting you film your round. It's not like the course has just been broadcast all over the world for the last 4 days anyway.
Wow!  what an incredible experience for you both.
Amazing experience! Wondering how many 3 putts or worse.😂 can’t imagine you can get use to them greens in 18 holes
Love the videos Ricky!!
Cant wait to hear about this round
could not be anymore jealous! Very curious on how 12th went :)
Can’t wait to see the scorecard!
I can’t believe you played Augusta that is so cool
breaking 75 at augusta would be insane. shame you couldnt film it
Can’t wait to see the pictures and hear the story ⛳️ 🏌️‍♂️
Wow!! What an awesome experience
Cracking news Rick - you work so hard to bring us fantastic content and deserve all the success going!  Looking forward to seeing the next instalment. Simon
Dream stuff. Congratulations on the 2.5m, an incredible achievement.
Bucket List no1 for me.
Even the Augusta airport has the bird chirping soundtrack 🙂
What a great opportunity
Sounds like a dream come true. Most people will likely never walk onto the course, let alone get too play it. Congrats
what and amazing achievement that is well deserved from your hard work and awesome content!
I was there for Wednesday’s practice round and Par 3 contest! TV doesn’t do Augusta justice and words cannot even come close to how heavenly Augusta is
You went to the Open last year and now the Masters this year. I have just one question: will this turn into another Brooks Koepka story?
Wow, it’s on my retirement bucket list, although many years of work left! Being a mid handicap not sure I’d make it round the course!
So fortunate! What I wouldn’t give!
So so jealous.
Unbelievable experience! I cant wait for the podcast to listen to the shot by shot score update. Congratulations on this wonderful bucket list item.
Every golfers dream to play Augusta
So jealous! What an amazing experience that must have been. Keep up the good work pal. Much love
❤
The stuff Dreams are made of!
Congratulations Rick, an amazing achievement and I can't wait to hear more about it on the podcast channel!
Wow! Living the life! I'm green with envy, lol. Can't wait for the story behind the photos.
What a day it must have been looks like you had fun from the video.
So awesome Rick! And Congrats on 2.5 million 🤯 just incredible!! 🎉🎉
Congrats Rick. Must have been wonderful. How do you rate the course against the Old course?
So dreams do come true 🤪🙈🙌⛳️
Class opportunity that!!
so pumped for you guys!
Congrats on realizing such a lifelong dream!
Rick, thats amazing. I can‘t wait to see the outcome. After watching 4 days on TV-finaly I put the course on top of my bucket list ;)
Completely deserved!!! Although to say I’m jealous would be an understatement
Lucky dog
Looking at you, I think you played well - playing Augusta National is well deserved for someone who does as much as you do for global golf aficionados!  Looking forward to see the score and the photo's. Keep up the good work!
Wow that's brilliant  Rick. You must feel very privileged  to have played Augusta. I'm very Jealous 😁
🏌youtube master - congrats Rick and team!
The dream. Would love to play Augusta once in my life. Great stuff! Can’t wait to hear about your round!
You have gone to heaven, nothing else will ever be the same I'm sure. Congratulations
Great news, just a shame that you were not allowed to film it, would have loved to have seen that.
It's nice to see someone that gives so much back to the game of golf get an opportunity like this.  Congrats to both of you!  I think my only hope would be to sneak out to the 16th in the middle of the night.... hit a quick tee shot into the drink... and then go to the ER to get the bullet removed from my backside.
Another great bit of good news, I get excited I am not there, gutted.
Best drive of your life on the 1st hole is the only way to start a round of golf. To do it at Augusta National is something you will NEVER EVER FORGET!
What a dream come true
Great for you but if the Masters don’t let you film what good is it to us?? We have heard hundreds of people’s experiences. Masters blows!!
Did you break 100?!
Can't wait to see Augusta National video.
Oh man,  you have peaked,  nothing will top it.
The ultimate golf experience! I can only imagine the excitement of walking to the first tee for such a round of golf. Congrats! Can't wait to hear more.
So happy for your, that you had the chance for this incredible experience. Congrats for the 2.5 mil subs :) All the best to you!
Let’s go Rick!!
Thats amazing, congratulations!
Exciting for you guys!  What an amazing experience to be able to play The Masters course. 🏌️
Unbelievable!! Congrats Rick ❤
Honestly if you started your whole YouTube career just to gain enough notoriety in the golf world to play Augusta it would have been worth it. Congrats on getting out there, I am jealous!!!
A dream come true for sure!!😊❤

Send the swag bag to Australia😍🇦🇺
What a wonderful lifetime opportunity. I once played Valderama and it was eight holes before I could take a fairway divot. They were like putting greens. I wonder if you had a similar feeling. Augusta, what a very special place. I know you had a GREAT time.

Looking slick Rick, Masters Monday brought to you by Rick & Seb. That package won't improve my woeful golf but at least my friends might like me again!!

Did you break 75 though?
That smile!
Congrats on another bucket list achievement 👏 👌

If you broke 90 I would say that’s an achievement. The nerves alone I don’t think I would make contact until hole 5.
Two very very lucky men
I can't wait to see the full update on Augusta National.  Thanks, Rick.  By the way, who do you know who got you on?  I haven't been able to even get tickets for years and I live in Texas.
Hey Rick- great effort getting on Augusta! I’m very jealous 😢
Love it, one lucky chap playing there! Such a shame we couldnt watch a course vlog!
CONGRATULATIONS ON 2.5M SUBSCRIBERS AND THE SWAG BAG WOULD BE COOL

Very cool!! What an amazing experience
Congratulations on a bucket list course! Glad you had fun.
Where does it rank with playing the old course?
Congratulations Rick just shows what rewards can come your way with hard work and dedication in life well done mate 👏👏👏
Congratulations lads. Bucket list course and it’s been a cracking year for bucket list courses for you.  It’s a real pity they wudnt let you record it. Sure what difference would it be from the actual main event. Yeah think Adam Scott and Faldo put in a good word for ya. And Mercedes putting ya up aswell. I’m Looking forward to the pod no doubt.

You lucky sod.
All the hard work has paid off, a once in a lifetime achievement, congratulations rick 👏
You seem a little excited. Looking forward to that scorecard.
What an experience.  Settle the controversy...birds or no birds at Augusta? Many believe the bird sounds heard on the broadcast are fake.
How bloody good! A bit bittersweet that it couldnt be filmed but what an experience!
Absolute dream!
Bro so jealous. Would-be love to ever plat 18 holes on those halowed grounds.
Incredible. Can't wait to see how you did!
Lucky bugger
Congratulations, Rick, that had to be the experience of a lifetime. I have to admit that I'm a bit jealous. I'm sure your adrenaline will still be pumping for the 4007 miles it is from Augusta to Manchester, safe travels.
When you mentioned you had big news, I knew this had to be it. You look to be still buzzing. Can’t wait to see the score.
Love it!
Congrats Rick! I love watching your video. I'm a new golfer, at 62 years old, and I've learned so much from you. Thank you so very much.

Wow! Thats amazing Rick, every golfers dream!
This would be a once in a lifetime coarse to play.  Did you have the full experience with the storms on your round
Congrats for the great privilege to play such a course!
Can't wait to hear about the putting; was it Ian Woosnam who said the greens at  Augusta were like putting off the roof of a car and hoping to get it to stop on the bonnet?
Absolutely fantastic.  All your hard work getting just reward 🎉

This golf course is the closest thing to heaven on Earth. So glad you got to experience it! The groundskeepers have a surgical process to everything so nothing is out of place.

If I ever win big money. I’d take my brother and my mates on the golf group we have. To play it, always been my dream to go there.
So cool that you got that chance! Can‘t wait what‘s to come for your channel. Keep it up!
Congrats! How did you make that happen??
Unreal👏🏼
Gutted you couldn't film it as I would have loved to have watched! Still going to be hanging on to your every word in the shot by shot rundown though. Your excitement and enthusiasm is infectious mate!
That is unreal, well done!
A shame you couldn’t film but great you got to play the course and the day after the masters too!
So the big unanswered question. Did you break 75? 😂
Unreal

Dreams do come true Rick Shiels!
Swag bag!? - yes please 🙏🏼
Sooo Jealous! Amazing to have the opportunity.............pray tell how you on to the ballot or were you invited?
the dream!! cant wait to see how you did compared to the pros!
Wow,wow,wow - what an experience. Expect most of the rough was nicely flattenned by the crowd and playing without the roar of the crowd must have helped. Is it as green as it looks on tv ? Any wet balls ? Would love some swag here in Cape Town and think we need to get you down here in summer to see the amazing courses of south africa🙏🏻👍🤸🏼🛫😜🏅
Class
So jealous!!
Nice achievement and this is a every golfers dream

Well done, happy for you, absolutely sensational.
You lucky, lucky B*******s!
You feel the adrenaline in their voices after this round. It’s just the holy Grail of golf.
Crazy how some YouTubers can film around here but some people can only take pictures? Either way good on you Rick it’s every holders dream to play Augusta!

Would have made the ultimate Break 75 episode! Congrats fella, one ticked off your bucket list
I don’t want to be Negative Nigel but this is a bit of a let down. An unfilmed round on a media day. Congrats for having a nice day but after all the weeks and weeks hype I thought we’d get a break75 with Faldo.
What an surreal feeling that must have been!  Congratulations on all your success and achievements!
Those beer cups come with some nice bragging rights 😎
Unbelievable experience! Every golfer around the world is super jealous right now! Love the videos mate
Better frame those photos, don’t think an opportunity will come around like that again.
Amazing mate !! It is on my bucket list to play here and re-live some of the incredible shots over the ears.

Well deserved buddy 🙌🏻
Playing Augusta must’ve been absolutely class. What’s better the pimento sandwich or a sausage roll at the half way house?
The YouTube golf master playing Augusta ….. bucket list tick right there . Congratulations on 2.5m
Love to hear/see more 🤞
Sounds like a dream come true , well done Rick 👍
Gutted there won't be video footage, but looking forward to the update.

Glad you had a wonderful time Rick, I've never seen you so excited!  Shame that the Yanks are so up their own arses that they wouldn't let you film. It would've been wonderful to have seen how you played
Wow.  The invitation itself is a recognition of the way you've made golf more accessible and welcoming to many social and beginner golfers.  A well deserved accolade and seal of approval from a bastion of the game!
Living the absolute dream Rick! So pleased for you and can't wait to hear about the experience on the next video.
Come on then Rick, how did you wangle it? I've heard it's easier to get a game of darts with Putin.
What an absolute dream that must have been, gutted there’s no video! 💔
Glad there was no video option Rick so you could take some time to yourself and soak it all in!!
What an experience - A bucket list series of courses would be a great one for this channel

how much would you have to donate in one of the members name who would sponsor you,  to play a round. Just a rough guess. Id say a few thousand dollars but does anyone have an knowledge of what it would take . Thanks
Unbelievable achievement in a golfing career
Not a single jealous golfer watching, I hope it was everything and more what every golfer dreams of!.
So pleased for you, surely a bucket list item ticked off.

Delighted for you to experience it. Would you agree with someone who once said “even the average Club golfer would struggle to even putt to par, if you started putting off the green at the first point of access?” ie loads of 4 and 5 putts or more from the edge?
Way to go Rick!
You lucky pair.  Great to see genuine joy on your faces despite all the amazing experiences you have already had from golf - just shows it's the game that keeps giving
Well deserved reaching the 2.5 million rick.    Everybody's dream to play Augusta and you achieved it from sheer hard work so well done.
Way to go; Rick
Wow amazing, congrats!
Sooooo envious, I'm probably as green as the turf you played  on.
Thats the Dream
Unreal opportunity! Jealous is the word 😂
Unreal, one lucky man

So excited for you. For someone new to golf, this is like the superbowl of golf. I watched every day of this tournament, and it has really cemented my new passion and love for the sport of golf. I am excited to take my own journey in the sport and hopefully one day make it to see the course with my own eyes.

Bosh Rick!
Such a pity you couldn't film, but what an experience. IMO the best course in the world 🌎 🏆😁👍
What an insane opportunity to play this course the day after the Masters...once in a lifetime for most normal human beings. Loved the Masters coverage, even though it finished at 1:30am my time...Rahm was mega! Thanks for the videos. Keep them coming
Mint
Congratulations for unlocking a lifetime golfing achievement 🔓  Shame it couldn’t be filmed.  Congratulations on 2.5m subscribers too. Amazing.
you are something from nothing a driving  range  pro to playing the master !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    LOVE it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Excited to hear how you got on Rick!
I saw you on TV, sitting behind the 12th tee !
Looking forward to having a rundown of the course! Looked incredible during the masters🙌🏼
I cant wait for the shot by shot update Rick!  Bring it on :-)
Would’ve loved to have seen the video of you playing Rick, but congrats for achieving every golfer’s dream!
What a lucky guy you are Rick 🔥
The life you live! Congratulations 🎉
Well deserved Rick
What an opportunity! Would love to go watch let alone play the course!
Break 75???
Dream come true! Congrats on 2.5M!
An incredible achievement, Rick. So well deserved, both getting to play Augusta as well as the 2.5Mil subs! Keep pushing the great content and we'll keep watching and supporting. Thank you!!!
My Dream to play there ! So happy for you Rick!! Video liked and waiting for that prize 🏆
Great to fulfill a lifetime dream by playing that great course.  Just to see it was an experience I will never forget - back in 1981 (the year Ian Woosnam won) - I went to two practice days and it filled in a lot of details about the course, especially the holes which at that time were not featured on tv. It is one  place, like some of our Open links, where holding back the ball lengths might have been brought in sooner to protect the integrity of the course.  I presume the members don't play the full championship length.. what tees were you off in your game?
Mate, you are honestly living the dream
Nice work, would have been great to see the video. Keep it up
Wow not even jealous, just happy you guys got to play and appreciated the experience.
So jealous!
Let's goooo rick. Pity you couldn't film it 😔😔
Love this, what an opportunity.. 🏌‍♂️
amazing....so jealous
Every golfers dream!!
Glad you had a blessed Easter weekend at the Masters. What an awesome experience that must have been
Fair play mate. Unbelievable course to have on the CV.
What an Amazing experience and one I could only ever dream of. Can’t even begin to imagine the nerves on that first tee. Hope you played well, shame we couldn’t get to see the footage.
👍
wowww this is amazing 😮
Why would you not be aloud to video ? It’s just been on tv constantly 😢
Just proves what hard work gives you well done rick
Wow. Very jealous. Something most will only ever dream about!
Great stuff, I love the passion you have!

The excitement in your voice says it all Rick, living the dream, well done lad, looking forward to seeing and hearing your report on the podcast (and of course what you scored) I was looking at a website earlier this morning funnily enough that was reporting that a mid handicapper (Me) would struggle to break 110 round Augusta
Must have played well your buzzing from it.. 🎉
Gutted there’s no break75 :(

Looking forward to the podcast. Will it be a break 75!!!
Where does it rate on your list of greatest golf courses?
Incredible. Absolute bucket list course for any golfer
The smile that that lit up your face said it all...happy for you.  Us Meare mortals will only ever play such an iconic course in our heads...looking forward to you articulating to us the buzz you got from doing so.
That's right up there on the bucket list isn't it getting to play at Augusta! Congrats Rick. Shame we won't be able to see it but what an experience! Also, huge congrats on reaching 2.5 million subs, what an achievement

🔥
God bless you rick. You speak for all of us 'Golf punks'.
Awesome ⛳️ 🏌️‍♀️
Lovely Rick!!
I would love the bag!
What is it called that is above and beyond any Bucket List??? Lucky you.
What dreams are made of
Me pls
Well done Rick!!
Living the dream, nice on Rick
It's Official Rick. You are the luckiest man and envy of everyone on here.  Well done that man.  #jealous
Epic! So sad that you couldnt film it
Jealousy ripping out me
Nice one Rick, you get to some places😂
What I'd give to play Augusta, very jealous right now😂😂
Fantastic opportunity. Thought you might have been playing with Jon Rahm... :-)
You lucky lucky boy dream come threw 👏
You lucky, lucky, lucky boys….what an experience, one to cherish forever.  My Masters was made perfect after sitting up to watch John Rahm’s victory, I woke the next morning to find that I’d won my golf club’s Masters sweepstake and collected a brand new Ping G430 driver….happy days!
What a highlight of anyones golfing life to play there!  Looking forward to the pics and commentary.
Outstanding Performance guys. Love your content. What a dream come true. Bucket list material. 🤩
It's so amazing you played Augusta National!! You are a true legend!
Loving that hat Rick! Is it getting worn to death or going in the trophy cabinet? 😁
Wow! Huge congratulations. I’ll give my right arm just to get to Augusta. Maybe one day!
cant wait to hear how it went. the excitement speaks volumes! those greens are like ice. i see you at the 12th tee watching Tigers group. was you following Tiger or just watching the 12th hole.
Love the first tee nerves! That's what makes golf to special. All the major sports are played on the same surface/field/court every time, but with golf you have 10s of thousands of unique playing opportunities. That's also what keeps it feeling so fresh. Would love to play Augusta one day, but I guess for now a swag bag will do ;)
Bucket List Stuff!!! So glad you got the opportunity and we can all live vicariously through your commentary of how you got on. Cant wait to hear all the details hopefully not too many gory ones but with the Chipping and greens there might be a few 🙂
So nice you played there. Once in a life time.....❤
Let me guess... 97?
Can’t believe there’s no video from the round. What a joke
Every golfers dream
Can't wait to hear about it and see what you got in the pro shop! Legend 🔥
YouTubers getting access to, possibly, the most exclusive course on earth!?!? The times they are a-changing (for the better if you're a content creator! 😂). Well done Rick. I'm sure it was incredible!
congrats on playing augusta! under 75? 😉
Awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You are the envy of every golfer Rick. Well done
Wow. You’ve treaded where only the pinnacle of the sport have dared. Congrats.
Wow!
Omg, congrats my friend! What an amazing experience!
Well done Rick on 2.5m subscribers. Looking fwd to listening to the next podcast
Well deserved opportunity, and off of your own merits too! Top man well done.
The fact there is no course blog is the biggest disappointment I've ever had.
Wow, just incredible. Saw you video with Sir Nick where you said this was number 1 course you wanted to play…and you’ve done it! Awesome.
Wallop
So sad there isn't a Break 75 😢
A dream come true im gealous
Thats amazing! Congratulations!
OMG!! So jealous!!

Massive congrats Rick, only got into golf last year and it was because of you!! Now my eyes are glued to the screen every tournament loving it
I can tell that you're not a bit excited. So pleased for you both.. How fabulous ❤😂❤
You're the man Rick. What a dream
Rick, for what you have done for golf and where you are now with your channel, no one deserves a round of golf at Augusta more than you! Can't wait to hear all about it!
Your an absolutely legend living the dream keep smashing it Rick. 💪
Love it. What an experience!!  Lifetime memories for you Rick.  Would love to win the swag bag.
Simply…living the dream Rick😁🙌🏽
Lucky men.

So Jealous, shame you couldnt film it :( A break 75 there would have been awesome to watch!!!
So gutted that you couldn’t film it, amazing experience for though nonetheless!
Love this Rick. So pleased you got the chance to play
That is awesome! My late uncle was able to play Augusta the Monday after Master probably 35 years ago through the media random draw that they have.  Loved hearing him tell about getting to play each hole.
That’s crazy Rick!!!
Rick playing a day later and still somehow had to pass Cantlay who was still playing the back 9 😂
Living the dream Rick….
Need a wee break 75 for this week still!
Mean
LOVE IT!!!!!  Can't wait to see how you guys got on...!
So happy for you Rick
These two are about as giddy as any of us would be after playing Augusta. Aspirational stuff.
congrats on 2.5 mil subscibers.. love watching your videos.. if you ever come to play in denmark you should play læsø golf course. hard course on an island with wind. but beautiful sorroundings. cheers. and if you do come here i´ll go 18 holes with you stableford. guess thats a long time since you played that..
2.5 million!!! Amazing content Rick.
Fantastic Rick!  The ultimate dream for any golfer. I’m so happy that you got to enjoy the historic grounds that is Augusta. Can’t wait to hear all about it.
Nice Rick
Bucket List - TICK
Amazing Rick! What was your favorite hole to play?

Every golfers dream right there

Jealous doesn't even come close !! What an Honour !!
lucky bastard jajajajajajajaj
Such an amazing achievement Rick! Keep up the good work!
Sounds amazing. The luckiest opportunity of your life. How could any golfer not be jealous of you
It is such a shame that you couldn’t film your round. But just being able to play there must be an amazing experience! Can’t wait to here about each shot you made!
Insane stuff Rick! That’s the dream!
Dreams do come true.
Love it Rick! Congrats on what sounds like a solid effort round there!
Amazing 🤩
Can’t wait to find about your round. I am a member at the Augusta Country Club which is next door to the Augusta National, the next time you are in town let me know and we can play that course too.
This is mega, what an experience!
What a place to bring your A game. Look forward to the breakdown!
@RickShielsPGA  I'm so jealous. I've been applying through the lottery for tickets to The Master for 15 or 16 years and have not yet had any joy. I always wanted to go with my father but he has now told me that even if I was to get tickets, he would not make the trip because health insurance would cost him too much. That being said, I'm sure someone would come with me.
What an amazing experience!!!
Living every golfer dream Rick. Well done fella
Jealous!
I look forward to the update!
lucky bugger
Amazing, very jealous but what an honour for you guys.  No chance they are going to let you do the YouTube masters there then? 😂
Up the 2.5mil, up the Shiels, up the swag!🎅🏼
Amazing what hard work and commitment can give you, from watching Rick walk 18 almost every day during covid (yes actually watching him walk IRL) to playing Augusta National. Wow.
Would have been an amazing break 75
Love it Rick!
Wow what an experience, fair play to you mate shows how far you have come, great achievement.
Rick living every golfers dream. Holy grail. Living my life vicariously through you. Great content Rick
Fair play!
awesome.....  happy for ya!
Awesome news. Cannot wait to see the content
Congrats Rick!!
Wow, must have been amazing
Always my dream to play in America…having had a Rory not make the cut and a liv-er lead the masters for a while, hope was lost. Then tiger withdrew, probably then most eventful masters ever. Not to mention the tree that fell down. Rick, love your videos and it would be a massive honor and privilege to own some masters memorabilia.
Love watching these videos... wish could see the footage
Masters
Awesome vid!
Very happy for you Rick! Can't wait to see the score card
Lucky you Rick😃! Happy for you truly! I still can’t comprehend the greenery watching on TV! Looks like fake grass! Is it as green as it looks on TV lol?!

Well done on 2.5m. Just being at Augusta is great but playing it is amazing well done.
This is legendary status!!  The things I'd do to play that course 😍

Just amazing!!!
Any particular reason filming wasn't allowed?

Love your channel teach me a lot of things thank you
Loving the sheer pleasure and delight from you about your experience. Sometimes you can get jealous of people, in this case I’m just really happy for you both. They say you shouldn’t meet your heroes in case they don’t meet expectations. Obviously on this occasion they were exceeded. Brilliant and great reward for your achievements to date. 👍
What an experience.
Nice one Rick I’m sure you broke 75 easily 😅
Way to go Rick

Jealous x 10^N - where N is a very large number !!! 😁😁😁
Wow, I'm very happy for you ⛳️😀⛳️

Goodie bag 😊😊 ⛳️

Amazing. Can't wait to hear the scores!
Thats awesome Rick! Great stuff
Bucket list achievement 👌
Been watching this channel for years now an im still looking forward to fridays and break 75. The closer we get to summer the harder it is to wait for the golf course to open her where the snow stil lies. The only comfort is watching Hovland and Rick play their hearts out in the weekends
Not jealous at all😂 well done Rick!
what an experience man - looking forward to hearing more about it.
Can’t believe you got to play your dream course, love it. The open is still better 😜
Golf nirvana for every golfer! Just a shame there isn't a video to follow! What an amazing experience though! Extremely jealous! 😮😊
Huge moment for you! Can’t believe they let you go round!
Amazing Rick.  Too bad you couldn't video it but glad you got some pictures.  Congrats on 2.5M viewers.
Love to see it Rick 😍
The pinnacle right there!! Shame you couldn’t record any video…
As a former greenkeeper, looking at Augusta blows my mind. Look forward to the video.
Wow
You can now tick Augusta off your bucket list
What an amazing experience.
Wonder if all of "those people" who said: "Get a hair cut and a real job" still think that on their way into work this morning...
Lucky so and so!
looks amazing. Jealous would be an understatement.
EVERY GOLFER WOULD BE JEALOUS OF YOU
glad you enjoyed it! that goodie bag looks nice!
😮😮😮
Congratulations on hitting the 2.5million that is unreal and you are ticking off the golfers dream bucket list as you do it. You really are living the dream.
Without video this won't be the same for us. I hope at least you took burst pictures so we can see it in stop motion.
Unbelievable stuff pal
Pick me 😁
Congratulations 🎉
Wow, what an honour and a privilege to play, arguably the best course in the world. I have said before, for us mere mortals watching  you experience these bucket list courses is vicarious golf. Your teams content, production, formats and guests are what keep us muddling through the week until it’s our turn to play on our own patch of grass around the world. Keep it going Rick and thank you. Karl
I’m banking he made a birdie on 18
Yes, thank you😂👌🏻
Living the dream Rick, so jealous.
next time your at belfrey lets play a round
Could not be more jealous! Dream to play Augusta
Congratulations Rick 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 So happy for you and can’t wait to hear how you got on ⛳️
Congrats Rick!!!
wicked... you need to go play Darren Clarks golf course Royal port rush the green keepers are from all round the world and its a lynx that's if you can get on it you mite be sitting next Rory and co but the courses in belfast are shocking you forget where you are lool
That’s amazing Rick and congrats on 2.5m
It has to be on everybody’s holy grail list pleased for you Rick what an opportunity Can’t wait for the shot by shot run down especially the putting.
Best looking course in world bar none, love to see it live to see the undulation that isn’t obvious on t.v.must have been the thrill of a lifetime for you.jealous.thx for the experience Rick,
Well done Rick. Can’t wait to hear all about it 😊
Fair play Rick. Bucket list stuff!!
Fair play Rick, amazing experience! Best of luck in the future and congrats with 2.5M!!
No video?   Why do I care on a video site?  Rhetorical
Awesome experience, looking forward to the shot by shot report 👍🏻
Jealous, very jealous 😮
Excellent Rick
Awesome stuff! 😎{Guy Charnock has left the chat} 😆
That is so cool!
Serious opportunity missed by Augusta National to not have Rick do a Masters preview video like last year with the Open.  I mean they did that silly Dude Perfect video...
Nice one Rick, your channel is the golf channel that keeps on giving.  Amazing 👏
👌
That is so so so cool
Feel honored rick! So happy for you, Hope you wont forget this memory
So good!
Your face is the cat that got the cream !!!! Big smiles
That is awesome! A moment you will cherish forever, I’m sure!
Friggin legend rick 🙌
There is no amount of jealousy that's could sum up how I feel right now.... Together with disappointment that Augusta unsurprisingly wouldn't let any filming happen
one luck man ti be able to play sugusta
Shame you couldn’t film it and none of us is jealous………..none of us………
Rick just completed golf 👏🏻🙌🏻
This is just brilliant Shielsey, bloody wrapped for ya mate. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What an achievement! Love to see it
Can't wait for the break 75 .. the first ever youTube video in pictures.
Playing Augusta is the dream.. you’re in a very elite group of people!
Amazing Rick! 👏
OMG  You lucky man... I so want the swag bag.... What was the Shoppe like? ⛳🏌️‍♂️👍😎
Wow
Such a shame not allowed to film it. Understand trying to maintain the brand and prestige of it but allowing Rick to do an official video would only help the brand!
Been watching you for the last 6 years mate, massive fan and so cool to watch Rahmbo do his magic. Would absolutely be over the moon with the Masters swag bag!!!
Jealous as hell well done
Big one off the bucket list!
I hope there was some birdie sauce.
No way, this is ridiculous. I hate you in a I'm very jealous kind of way 😂 Augusta need to up their game with video content seriously, it's just pure snobbery at this stage not allowing a creator, especially the number 1 golf creator in the world film his round and promote them. Its the one thing I hate about the masters  You can be prestigious and also be open to someone when it's appropriate
Your a lucky man Rich well done mate
YOU DESERVE IT!!!! 🎉
Awesome! Keep up the good work
Wish they would have let you film, but amazing to hear about! Looking forward to Wednesday already!
Must have been amazing! So jealous!
Legend
you have just accomplished every mans dream to play Augusta well done mate
Hi Rick, I envy you. Augusta is, together with St. Andrews, the absolute pinnacle of golf, and every golfer's dream is to play there. Well done, looking forward to the scores!
Did you break 75
Wow. What an experience. 👌🏼🎉
Really living every golfers dream hahaha.
Gutted u couldn’t film, would have been an unreal video
Awesome Rick!
Well done Rick. Every golfer dream 👍
Wow that’s amazing! Can’t wait to hear the rundown on it! Well done rick and seb
Nice
🔥
So jealous!
It’s a bummer that it can’t be filmed. Augusta obviously doesn’t need/want the publicity like some courses he plays, but why do they have to be so snobby about it. However it is great that he was invited to play. Did Nick Faldo have something to do with that? Did he have to play with a member? So many questions.
Something we can only ever dream about, well done Rick.
Gimme!!!!
Can't wait for this update!
So jealous 😂
Wow! What a way to finish your trip.   Fully deserved can’t wait to hear what score you shot etc on the next podcast! Keep it up Rick
I hope you played really well and enjoyed the experience 😊
What an immense and well deserved achievement! Fair play Rick!
Incredible
Well done Rick! Much deserved! Congrats.
Hard work pays off.. bucket list stuff this.. well done Rick and team!
Absolute Bucket List!!!! So gutted there isn’t a video!!
Every golfers dream,
A dream come true is an overused phrase in YouTubeLand - but playing Augusta the day after the masters is it.  Shame you were not able to film it - it would have been fascinating seeing a very good but not elite golfer playing it.
Unbelivable Rick! You deserve it 🎉
You love to see it!
Rick the Goat
Love that Rick! Hoping for the masters swag! #2.5m
Brilliant!!
Unbelievable Rick! Loving every golfers dream! Hard work pays off! Keep it up x
Swag please Rick 😊
Congrats on your 2.5 m subscribers and for also getting to play Augusta. Must have been a dream of a lifetime that so few will ever be able to do.
Lucky so and so...
This is class. Love it Rick
Can’t wait for the next video 🏌🏼
What an experience guys
Unreal. So jealous, but also so stoked to see how over the moon it made you.  I can only imagine.  I would love to taste a little bit of that excitement with the swag bag!  All the way from New Zealand.
Brilliant Rick - love it! Keep up your fantastic work 🙌🏻💪🏻
Awesome! What a treat that must have been, great reward for keeping 2.5m of us entertained every Friday😀

Speechless. You lucky lucky man😊

Quality Rick.. lifelong dream achieved 👏🏼 ⛳️
It's a shame Rick was not allowed to film there. Sure would have been an amazing video.
so unfortunate you could not film a break 100 there :D
Really wish you were able to film it. would be a great Break 75 Episode!
I’ve been here from the start and this has always been the ultimate achievement for you. Well done 👏🏻 Sounds like you have had an incredible week, safe journey home!

So happy for you 😊 I know how much this meant!
Looks incredible every year
What an achievement (2,5 million subscribers & playing Augusta)! Incredible! 🎉
Amazing rick I am not jealous
If you can't be good, be lucky! 😂 You jammy sod, but well deserved.
They let Dude Perfect film there. A break 75 at Augusta with Rick would break the golfing internet.
Break 75?
Congrats on completing life Rick!
This is you know you've made it. Well done rick
Get in there RS, amazing content!
Legend

Congrats Rick 🎉
Awesome
Ricks just completed The Boss Level of all Golf courses!
Disgusting there was no video allowed 😮 oh yes , protecting the brand from the 99% of people who will never ever EVER get to see how an everyday golf pro, AMATEUR or handicap player would play the course. It’s a thumbs down 👎🏻 with genuine disappointment as your course Vlogs are thoroughly entertaining and educational as well.
This is incredible. Such an achievement mate. Something every golfer dreams of!
What an awesome experience Rick! You are truly blessed! Cheers mate!
Augusta, Dream, very very very very very Lucky Young Man Rick👋👋👋👍
Amazing Rick! I can see that swag bag turning heads at my medal this weekend 🙂

Can’t wait for the update video! I am sure you never would have imagined when you first took a video of your swing from above etc and uploaded it that it would lead to playing Augusta. CRAZY!
Leaving a comment
Congratulations, break 75???😂😂😂
That’s an amazing experience anyone would dream of as a final golf bucket list. By all means I think it was great to not film it anyways. All your hard work you’ve put in over the years and you got to just relax and make a dream come true
Congratualtions on 2.5 mil, so happy you got to experience the pinnacle of golf courses! 🎉🎉

This is unreal. Want to know how he went on 13
Amazing for you and Seb, but LUDICROUS that you weren't allowed to film it. Why are they so precious about mere visual access to their golf course? Shame!

bet the score was 85 😉
What an honour.... Break 95? 😉
Amazing would of loved to see some video content
You deserve it Rick!
I think they missed a trick not letting you guys film. I get the reverence we are supposed to feel for the place etc but not taking the chance to reach new audiences and expand the mystique of the place?? It's not like we've not just had cameras following folk round for the last 4 days.    I'm sure they'll say if they let Rick film then they have to let everyone film and then it's less special but how special would it have been to see Rick tackle the place?
Congratulations Rick, that's awesome! Well deserved after putting out great content and growing the channel all these years 👏
I get the need for exclusivity, but why not let you film it?
2.5 million great job great channel 👍
Sounded emotional for Seb! Hope you had a great time lads!
🙋‍♂️
What a experience!!! At least I will win this bag hahahaha
Legendary
Would be awesome to play Augusta National. What an experience. 👍

I’d have just been ecstatic to just walk around Augusta 😁
Looking forward to seeing your scores.  Fantastic!
Wow Rick, this is incredible. Thank you for the amazing content!
Amazing Rick. Congrats
Congratz! :D
Absolutely unreal Rick, what a dream experience for you. Congratulations, this is your reward for all the hard work you’ve put into helping grow the game of golf.
Dang. Congrats Rick, sad there’s no video though
Incredible congrats Rick!
brill
Awesome!!!
Unbelievable! Playing the course that is at the top of every golfers bucket lists! I'm not jealous at all! 🤣🤣
Soo sooooo cool!
I am so happy for you, it must have been amazing.
Rick has literally completed every golfers dream of playing at Augusta
Amazing!!!
OMG so happy you got to do this. Can’t wait to hear the shot by shot run down!
Wow that’s big news. Congrats Rick and I’ll take the masters merch thanks 😉 hopefully doesn’t have any pimento cheese or egg salad sandwiches.
Love to play it
So awesome that you played at Augusta. Can you please put in a good word for me so I can play there one day? Cheers
Congrats Rick!!
Wow 👌🏻👍🏻
The stuff that dreams are made of!
Love it.  Looking forward to the breakdown Rick
can't wait to see this video !!!
Your excitement is infectious Rick! Way to go! Can’t wait to hear all about it as we mere mortals get to live vicariously through you!
Looking forward to hearing about each individual hole run through, such an amazing achievement well done
Amazing. I hope you enjoyed the round. You lived the dream.
Yes pick me I’m from texas
That is incredible! Once in a lifetime experience.🎉🏌️
Lucky man, well done 🎉
Good lad
Thoroughly deserved ❤️❤️ that bag would be unbelievable 🤓
Amazing 👏
Nice one
Great content mate, keep it up!! From Grimsby UK
What a week of Rick!
Yes Rick! That's incredible mate
Dreams can come true. It must have been such an amazing experience.
You lucky b*****d 😂 Really jealous, just send the goodies over to me in OZ 🎉
Living the dream Rick
This is amazing Rick, awesome you managed to play there, especially the day after the masters!
Congrats Rick! Can’t wait for the podcast!
Other than a round on the moon, how do you top that? Stumbled onto your channel a few weeks ago and never left. Thanks for the tips and new perspective on just enjoying golf, you demonstrate how to handle the rough and the smooth and how to just crack on when things aren’t going great! Love you sausage roll reviews, keep em coming. Sounds like an amazing experience and well deserved.
Great work Rick. What an amazing experience. Looking forward to the full video
Just when you thought the masters is doing epic things for people.."no video" ..yeah gtfo with that ..bunch of boomer elitest. Rick shiels is THE biggest golfing star with his platform and they deny him to film.  F THEM
⛳️
Awww…awww… awwww
Well done on 2.5m. While a break 75 would be amazing I am looking forward to the shot by shot retelling. The main reason the channel has been successful is that RS is a great communicator. And doing it this way just makes this round different and therefore special in its own way- Just like Augusta. I think Rick will do a great job of conveying the emotional highs and lows of the round. Can't wait.
It's a dream to play that course so good on you! But why won't they let you film it? Augusta and The Masters is like a cult - I love it and hate!!
Well done, cant wait to hear your rundown of the round. You are living a dream of so many people and sharing it for everyone to enjoy, thank you.
Congrats Rick! Been watching for years, so incredible to see the channel grow!
A brilliant experience I’m sure.  I’m very jealous. Glad you enjoyed it. Keep the videos coming Rick 👍🏻⛳️🏌️
Incredible, good effort rick
Congrats Rick, that's a dream come true for sure!
Unbelievable, what a dream to be able to achieve. Well done
So they allow exclusive coverage of the tournament all week yet can’t let you film an exhibition round? Shameful.
Love your content! So happy for you that you had the opportunity to play in Augusta!
Dream come true, love it mate!  Swag bag would be nice 😊
Amazing work as always big man!! Can’t wait to see the pics and the scorecard!
Absolutely incredible, couldn’t be more jealous! Well deserved
Excellent, you must have played with the media Monday
How many 4-putts???? 😂
Very very very very jealous
Looking forward to hearing about it on the podcast! Congratulations- sounds like you played well!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Congrats on 2.5 million subs! Nice swag bag btw 😍
Amazing!
🙌🙌
Brilliant achievement Rick, the airport doesn’t look to shabby either
Augusta  is such a dream!! I am so happy for you Rick...
Boss!
Rick  Can see how much it meant to you .we are living our dreams through your videos   Keep up the great work
Lucky boy 🎉
Wow imagine able to film a full course vlog
Wow what an amazing opportunity Guy will be jelouse
Wow amazing!!
You lucky bugger. 😂
Gutted you couldn’t film it..
That's funny  Rory McIlroy played it last week and said it's an absolute shithole
Rick you're awesome. Thanks for the content and all you're doing
Congrats Rick, you deserve it.   I'd love to play Augusta, but for me, my white whale is Cypress Point.
Congrats Rick, you’re the envy of the YT golf community (again)! Well earned
Damn no break 75 Augusta 😂
Wow what an amazing opportunity to play at Augusta,  I would be stoked just to attend this amazing place let alone play it.  Well done Rick hope you enjoyed every minute of it👍
Can't imagine what it was like
Unbelievable rick keep doing what you are doing!!
Such a shame they didn't let you film but an incredible opportunity and life achievement nonetheless! Love it!
Congratulations! Living the dream of every golfer, from amateur to professional. Couldn’t have happened to a nicer person.
Another one off the bucket list. Shame they didn't let you film.
Congratulations Rick! Looking forward to the run down
Amazing to hear for you! Well earned and deserved. Gutted we won't get to see it. Maybe next time there let you when they realise the impact you make
I would say I am jealous... But it would take me 5 days to get round 😆
That must have been such a wonderful experience. Augusta is the only course on my bucket list that I think I will never get to play. Such a beautiful place.
Very happy for you Rick and I can tell you are extremely excited about fulfilling your dream. Safe travels 🏌️‍♂️🤘
Congrats Ricky!!
Wow. How amazing. Very Jelly
one of the lucky few, so jealous.
Jealousy doesn't do justice to the feeling I just got...... Well deserved by the way !! Experience of a lifetime i'm sure !!
Wow I wish we could watch 😢 but so cool you got to play!
Congratulations Rick! I am jealous though haha. Thx for all the good content!
Nice one Rick!
Congrats Rick, well deserved!
2.5 million!!! Fully deserved. The gentleman of golf.
Are we still in 1970? Why can’t you show video? Seems very unfair
No one deserved this more Rick. The exposure that you give to the game of golf and the help that you have given me, in my game. Glad you got the opportunity to play that magnificent course pal 👊
Wow!! Well deserved Rick 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Congratulations Rick, that’s pretty much the pinnacle bucket list item for any amateur(or even pro golfer). Couldn’t have wished it on a nicer bloke! Keep up with the content you and the team are smashing it right now!
Goals achieved
Wow 😮 cant wait for the update 😊
man, sucks they couldn't' film! I would have loved to watch that.
I was able to play old course this week … which was absolutely incredible… so super happy that your dream came true… Augusta must be unreal!
Shame you weren’t allowed to film, maybe next time? Must have been tempted, got to keep the green jackets on side though for next year!
You deserved it! One bullet point marked as done on your bucket list then. Also shout out to your wife looking after all the kids while you are traveling. You are a lucky man Rick :)
Rick with the ultimate swag bag
Jealous! Well deserved though Rick! The content has been improving so much lately, no shock you’ve reached 2.5m, congrats!
i'm happy for you! :)
The golfing gods are looking down on you and it’s well deserved 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏌️‍♂️
On the must do list, that's an impressive tick!
Brilliant, such a shame you couldn't film would be a great video to watch. Fingers crossed we all see a low score in a few days.
❤❤
Unbelievable and congratulations on 2.5m
Deserverd Rick, in a couple years you can invite tour pros playing in the dome ;)
@RickShiels living the dream
Oh my word.   That had to be top of your bucket list?!
Love it Rick! What a dream you have just made reality. Very jealous 😢 can’t wait to see what you and Seb shot! Love it
This is what dreams are made of! Awesome to see how big of an impact you and the rest of the youtube golfers have had on the sport. Keep it up mate!
Wow,Wow,Wow. getting nervous just thinking about taking a divot out of those pure fairways. :D
Good stuff, Rick. Looking forward to hearing the score breakdown
What an experience! Such a shame that Augusta wouldn’t let you film even some of it…this and TV restrictions they had for the third round definitely make The Open by far the best major.
Oh man, video would be so awesome, but we will have to live vicariously through photos 😊
Good stuff Mr. Shiels. Swag bag hopes!
Im in for the swagbag 💯🙌
Congratulations Rick! Very jealous 😊
congrats on getting to play Augusta, shame you couldn't film it would of been an amazing video
Looking forward to this one.
Would have loved to have seen a video of it 👍
Golfing nirvana! Great content Rick, best ever.
Rick wow what an achievement totally deserved and keep it coming mate your work just gets better and better !!
So unfortunate they wouldn’t let you film
Swag 😎
Incredible Rick, well deserved
Incredible achievement on the 2.5m subscribers - I've been following for years and came up to the GoodGood x Rick Shiels meet last summer and you're one of the main reasons why I've committed to the addiction that is golf! Great rewards for all your hard work on the channel allowing you to play at THE course that every golfer wishes to go to.  Keep it up Rick - rooting for you against Pete (sorry Pete!) in the Golfbidder challenge too!
Congratulations Rick. Hard work and dedication to the sport and community along with charities deservedly rewarded. Keep up the great work. P.S. Hope you beat Pete in the golf bidder challenge
Get your swag out BIG STYLE
Amazing Rick living the dream! 🙌🏻
Well done Rick!

Wow...once in a life time round!
Wow, what an opportunity/experience. Would love some swag though 👍
You really deserved it, Rick! But I really need to say I'm a bit envious, cause I guess to me this will stay a lifetime dream, playing Augusta National...
Let’s go Rick!!
Gutted that there won't be a video but looking forward to the talk through of the course. Looked amazing.
This just isn’t fair 😂
The smile from ear to ear just says it all! Nice one Ricky
The fact that you played at Augusta national is just mental.
Amazing Rick you jammy sod carnt believe you actually got to play at Augusta

Highest achievement so far. Which members vouched for you two?
Very jealous Rick, bucket list material
Amazing so happy you got that experience always good to see dreams come true.I believe it is everyone's dream to play there that loves the game of golf and so awesome that it was you. You produce one of my favorite YouTube channels keep up the amazing work and keep those videos coming.
Played pal 👍🏼
Utterly awesome a lifetime dream .. you e just played Augusta National!! and congrats on 2.5 million subscribers.
I guess, I'm not the only one, who saw this one coming from a mile away! Really sad, that there won't be a Break 75 @ Augusta. Still congrats though on that insane opportunity! They really should have let you film 🙂  Greetings from Austria!
Looks an amazing course on tv and would be amazingly difficult!
Great stuff Rick. Well done on 2.5m!
No other YouTuber deserves it more Rick! The amount of dedication you have put into your channels over the years and the charity work you have done is incredible. Fully deserved!
jealous to say the least haha
Omg the holy grail of golf, wow
You deserve it mate!  It's a shame tho that you couldn't get it on tape so we could have seen it 🤩
How does it feel to be in one of the most elite group of active golfers in the world?
Unreal! How do you top that??
More than deserved Rick! You’ve done more than your fair share for Golf as a player and as a YouTuber. Inspired plenty of people on YouTube and even amateur golfers like my to improve my game and get out there and practice!   Well done Rick, hope you enjoyed Augusta and you deserve it more than most!
Wow, Can't wait to hear to final score for the round. Dream come true moment
You lucky mofo..
So awesome that you got to play at augusta! ❤🎉

You lucky bugger Rick Shiels! It was a great tournament and what a last round and a half by Rahmbo to catch and overtake Brooks. Well done by Phil Mickelson as well, great to see the “best players” in the same tournament!!!
Great course but such a bloody closed circle club. Congrats on the 2.5 m subs done a great job. St Andrews or augusta? I go fir St Andrews because you can play it and its the home of golf. Doesn't mean I wouldnt travel to augusta in an instant if I had chance to play it
Unreal! Can't wait to listen on the podcast 🤙🤙
Great bucket list round Rick
Swag bag please Richard!!!

Massive congratulations on 2.5m!
Lucky chap
What a shame there's no video. That would have made a great break 75
Congratulations on 2.5 million. What a way to celebrate with a round at Augusta.
Amazing Rick bet you loved it
Brits always say we’re a bunch of knobs in America, nice to hear they like some of our golf courses at least. And in the south no less, their preferred source of ridicule.
I had a feeling that was the news that sent you off track during the podcast a few weeks ago. It’s a shame you didn’t get to film though, it would have been an amazing break 75 or 85 😂. Maybe they will let you film next time. 🤞🏻
I'm jealous!  Looking forward to hearing more details about your round!
Jealous much! Great opportunity, big congratulations
Congrats Rick! Looking forward to the verbal break 75, paint a picture with words
Whaaat!!!! No Break 75 Augusta 🤔
On the tee Rick Shiels fore please! Congrats so well deserved.
The worlds worst kept secret Rick 😂 such a shame you couldn’t film.
Come on Augusta, let Rick film there next year!
How did you get to play Augusta National? Also is it just as hilly as it looks on the tv?
Awesome! What a great opportunity to play the course
Keep it up!
Wow, that’s awesome. So jealous! Congrats on reaching 2.5million subscribers 👏🏻
Every golfers dream. Gutted it couldn't be filmed
How awesome.  Can't wait for the pod...cheers!!
Such a shame they did not allow you to film some of it. Great achievement on 2.5 m subscriptions
Fantastic to see how excited you are about it as well. That makes all the difference in all of your videos. Too bad Augusta didn’t want to feature in a Break 75 video. 😄
Wow - Talk about a bucket list dream come true! Congrats on 2.5M and congrats on playing every golfer’s dream course ⭐️
Super excited for that podcast episode
lekker rick!!!
Love it! They should let you film the YouTube Masters there!
Well done Rick, if you 4 putt the first and last then you could call yourself a masters champion.
Very well deserved, Rick. You've done so much to grow the game of golf over the past years. You've lived the dream for all of us a little bit!
Well done Rick, the ultimate golfers dream achieved
Congratulations Rick.  What a great opportunity and thanks for sharing (what you can) with us.  One more item off your bucket list....
Rick would beat Jon Rahm
Congratz Rick! I want the swag bag🤩

Sounds like you had a fantastic masters weekend....wonder which milestone you are more thrilled about, the 2.5 mil or playing Augusta
You lucky lucky bastards!!!!!!!!
Nicely done sir. Best golf golf content of youtube
I’m jealous! I’d kill (no not literally) to just play one hole there!
Incredible! The boy from Bolton knocking it around Augusta!
Lucky Man! Hope the trees dodged you ! 😅
Did Sir Nick sort the round out for you Rick as you asked in the pod cast? If so cant wait to see you and him play St Andrews backwards which he adked you to sort out 👍
Lucky you Rick…. Delighted you had the opportunity to play such an iconic course 🙏
What an opportunity! Congratulations on achieving what is likely every golfers dream 👍
Love this channel, fairly new to golf myself but the addiction is real!
Wow so jealous Rick

Wow. You are so lucky. I would love to get the opportunity to play here.
Buzzing for you
Sooooo envious 😄 Too bad you couldn’t film it, cause who is going to believe your tee shot on the first. A real “golfer story”. 😳😄😄.  Looking forward to more great content.  All the best.
Can't describe how chuffed I am that you played there. Can't describe how gutted I am you couldn't film!!
Amazing! Congratulations on both the subscribers milestone and of course getting to live out every golfers dream, to play Augusta National!
Amazing, can’t wait to see it
Congratulations Rick, great way to start the off the bucket list. ✅

Well done Rick, what n experience!
Incredible experience!   Congratulations for achieving your dream Rick!
Amazing! Living every golfers dream!!
You are living the dream! Love the videos, your content keeps getting better, this year has been superb! 2.5m is just the start. ❤
You lucky lucky boy!
Every golfer’s dream! Congrats on the 2.5m too!
Would love to just see the course, so playing it is just Unreal 😮
Why wouldn’t they let you film?
Rick's official made it to the pinnacle. Hope you had a great week out there
What a way to kick off a round at Augusta, with such a drive! Unbelievable Rick, looking forward to the content coming
Tremendous Rick!
Congrats on the 2.5M, did you break 80?
Well done Rick! What an amazing achievement
Can’t film your own round. Unbelievable.
Congrats Rick! That is absolutely epic!!! Nobody deserves it more, for what you are doing to elevate golf ⛳️
Nice to see its as big a dream moment for you that it would be for any other golfer
Nice one Rick, what a dream come true.
Rick that’s amazing so happy for you but also very jealous!! Probably a Masters weekend you’ll remember forever.
So cool you and Seb got this opportunity, gutted there will be full video of the round but guess you can’t have it all!
Unbelievable that must've been the best experience, especially the day after the Masters.  Shane you couldn't film, but you would probably have been too giddy to do it justice anyway....would've been fun to see.  Safe travels home, can't wait for the update ⛳️🏆
Jealousy dictates that I must now hate you... :)
Congratulations 🎊  I hope you planted a sneaky camera in your golf bag🤫
Absolute class very jealous
Congrats on 2.5m subscribers. What a way to celebrate it! 👍
They let dude perfect film an all sports battle but can’t let the #1 golf channel on YouTube film a legitimate golf round. Such horse shit
break 90?
Fair bloody play 😂😂
Congrats Rick!
giddy up
Couldn’t think of a more deserving golfer. You’ve done an incredible amount for the golf community, not only in terms of growing the game, but educating and creating entertaining content to watch. Congratulations Rick!
What an experience, especially playing it the day after - and congratulations on 2.5M subscribers, amazing, and well deserved 🎉
Unbelievable, your such a lucky man. But what a way to celebrate 2.5 million subscribers, congratulations! 🎉
Bet that was unreal 😮‍💨😮‍💨
wow, just wow . . oh and would love to see what's in the swag bag ! 😊
What an experience. I bet it was amazing
How awesome!!
Damn, Now iam really jellus! ! ! Happy for you man :)
What an absolute thrill of a lifetime !!!
What an achievement! I’m jealous 😢 that swag bag though👀
That's just not fair, how do you get to play Augusta when us mere mortals can't, only joking Rick, I think it's great that what is possibly perceived as a stuffy old boys club has allowed some talented YouTubers on to help promote and further enhance the reputation of the Masters. Still I wouldn't mind being in that stuffy old boys club!😂
Congratulations 🎉
Well done how lucky are you!
Very happy for you Rick! Keep up the good work!
Wish we could se a video...well done mate!
The ultimate goal!!
What an experience!
Congratulations Rick! You deserved that opportunity for all the content from over the years. Unreal job, devastated you couldn’t film it, but what an experience!
Seb is sick
Congratulations Rick!
Unbelievable Rick! I’m so happy for you, living the dream 😊
Love it.  Well earned 👏🏼
Well done  - a bucket list achievement!
Break 80 at the masters would be a great achievement  congrats on 2.5 million🎉
That must be the top entry in the Bucket List of Life ticked off!!

This is brilliant what an experience. Watching Rick talk about it, was exactly what I would imagine any golf fan to be feeling. Bucket list stuff and even more!
I've never been more excited to hear a podcast. That's so far from a bucket list wish I couldn't even imagine. See ya soon. ❤️👍💯
This is so awesome!
Well done Rick, been watching you since day dot and I think you’ve ever put out a bad video, I few questionable hair cuts along the way though!!😂 Keep posting Rick!!

Man that’s awesome! I couldn’t even imagine!
So, last year dude perfect got to film a video horsing around at Augusta throwing fucking nerf footballs and hitting slap shots on the course but the top person in YouTube’s golf criteria can’t film themselves playing a legit round? Can’t make it make sense. Augusta is run by some weirdos I guess
This is awesome
Awesome Rick! Not jealous at all 😄
Holy moly, that's awesome. Congratulations on the experience and hitting 2.5 million subs, Rick!
Wow lucky lucky lucky
cracking video as always rick
Rick master champ 2024

So jealous but also so gutted you weren’t allowed to film. Would have been the ultimate break 75 and would’ve loved your camera angles of Augusta.
What an amazing experience. Been watching the masters on tv, I couldn’t even imagine ever playing there.  Walking in the shadows of the pros. ⛳️
That’s unbelievable! (Commented for the giveaway :D )
Amazing, Bucket list ☑️ Living the dream
nice man....❤
What a way to celebrate 2.5M subs!  I bet you never thought a few videos to get you some more students would lead to Augusta the day after the Masters!
Swaggggggg
looking forward to the full rundown! #breaking77ataugusta?
Master Rick, it's been amazing seeing your channel grow and grow over the last few years. That's down to you, your personality the content you produce, your insight & knowledge on equipment & gear and how you communicate to us, your audience.  We appreciate the time and effort it takes to produce this week in and week out.  Well done to you and your team.    Please make a trip to South Africa there are plenty of fantastic courses here from the Gary Player country club at Suncity to the 10+ in the Garden Route, Cape Town, Durban and many more.  Try the Extreme 19th at Legend Golf and Safari Resort (400m high par 3)
So jealous! What a great weekend to be part of, let alone being able to play a round!  Hope you enjoyed every single second of it!
Nice job Rick! So glad you had the chance to do what some of us can only dream of.  Can't wait to see more content from your Augusta experience.  Safrle trip home.

Stunning sounds like you had the game of a life time. I did the same thing after the New Zealand open and it was fantastic the course was set up so hard and loved trying to live to my handicap
Onwards and upwards Rick!!!!!!!
Jolly good show Rick
Incredible, can't wait to see how you put together the next video with just pictures
Congrats on playing there.
Congratulations Rick, have you stopped smiling yet? 😀😀😀😀
Dream come true. So lucky to have that opportunity
Fisrt episode of Break 150 - You Jammy bugger
Wow you lucky fella that’s a lifetime ambition is it true you have to be invited to become a member of Augusta would love some souvenirs from there as no chance of ever going
Love your vids. Keep up the good work mate
Great experience!!
Did you predict this in a fortune cookie 15years ago?!
Canada LOVES you, Rick! Come over and show the golf world what we have to offer!  Keep living the dream - and thanks for letting us live it vicariously through you.  Cheers 🟥🍁🟥
Wow 😮
Legendary!!
🏌🏼‍♂️🏌🏼‍♂️🏌🏼‍♂️
Congratulations on such an awesome opportunity!
So Dude Perfect can film themselves playing disc golf and tennis st Augusta National, but the top golf youtuber only gets photography?
Congratulations!
Lets go!
Incredible opportunity. You have lived the dream for everybody on this channel. Thank you for all your content
jealous
Very jealous!
Incredible. Buzzing for you pal 😊 can't wait to hear how you got on 🙂
Well done Rick.  All the years of hard work are paying off
Unreal Rick 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Fulfilled a lifetime dream of mine and my father
So jealous, once in a lifetime opportunity
Oh please……. 😮
I am so jealous.  Awesome job wish I could play there as well.
Wow!! Hope you broke 75 🎉🎉 What a privilege it would have been!
Let’s go Rick, broke 85?
Miserable Augusta not letting you video it.  Guess we'll have to take your word for it that you smashed one down the first 😂
Amazing. What a day that must have been.
Awesome Rick, congrats on the 2.5mil aswell
Once in a life time opportunity 👊🏻👊🏻  I miss Sebs content doesn’t seem to have done much lately hope alls well Seb
Nice Rick!!
Great content rickie
Very jealous. What an opportunity, and I look forward to the next podcast when you'll chat about your experience 😀
You are a very lucky man Rick, hopefully one day I’ll get to go there never mind play. Keep the great stuff coming
Dream come true Ricky Boy!!
So are you going to show still pictures and narrate a shot by shot? Or maybe recreate it as a claymation?
2.5 million is crazy! 4 years ago I played with you in the first YouTube golf day!
Swag bag! Epic!
That is super cool and the condition must have been pristine. Don’t know how you got on sit good on you.
Pick me please! Can't wait to see what you shot.
Wow what a achievement all your hard work and dedication leads to moments like this well done!!!!
What a shame about not being able to video any of it, but I can imagine it was amazing
Ricky!!!!!!
Unreal achievement and so jealous Rick. You deserve it.
Awesome. What a treat! I’m just hoping to get tickets to see others play. Can’t even imagine actually playing the course.
The privilege of playing there is as a result of your hard work on the channel. Congratulations on the 2.5M and congratulations on playing Augusta!
Congratulations both Rick and Seb. I'd say it's well deserved! This maybe a silly question with an obvious answer but...  Why wouldn't Augusta National allow you to film your round there? Apologies if this is a stupid question...   Well done again!
Well done Rick and Seb
Sounds amazing Rick!
nice
Wow, dreams really do come true!
Looking forward for the recap of the round (under 75?? ;))! Ps. that goody pack looks sensational!
Congratulations Rick.  Amazing experience for you.
Wooow, what a great opportunity ⛳️🏌️‍♂️
Congratulations Rick you’ve helped me so much in my golf game especially over the last year or so, so glad you got to experience this you deserve it!
Absolutely mega! Very jealous
Goody bag looks nice 👌  Food video Rick
As a big fan, I am torn between being happy for you and being ever so envious!  I do fell like you played the round for all us average folk that will never even see the course. Some swag would help ease the pain
Jealous is an understatement!!
That is unbelievable. Talk about living the dream
Love the hype!
How good! Congrats mate
Can’t wait to see the YouTube flip book of your round at Augusta!
I would be in heaven if I got to play Augusta National! Cant wait for the pod! Congrats!
Good reward for all that you do!!! Fantastic
Amazing...stoked for you guys. Can't wait for the video drop!  🤙😎🖖
I'd love some Masters merch
The one thing I hate of the masters is the protectionism,  even on Google you can't see the course as it is. It looks like a very old overhead. Cant video etc.  The members and committee or whatever I wish they would shut up and just let the golf speak.  I mean I love watching and the course but the whole thing is like royalty that doesn't deserve it.  You not being able to video is typical and was expected.
Congratulations!
This is incredible
Called it. On the Sawgrass video I said,  "I dont suppose there's any chance this Break 75 ends up at Augusta is there?"  Although, no video allowed. Well done Augusta. Hilarious. 🙄
Amazing, been following you for a few years and this feels like a big milestone on your journey.
Gutted there won't be any footage
Ultimate achievement in life to play Augusta. Congrats Rick
I reckon you aimed for Break 90 then after the first tea shot went after Break 85! Would have been an amazing video!
Glad you got to cross that one off your bucket list. Can't wait to see and hear more.
congratulations. I hope you played a great round.
Nice video
Congrats on 2.5 Million subscribers and congrats on getting to play every golfers dream course! Whoever gets that Masters swag bag is very lucky! Happy for you Rick!
Nice video
What an awesome experience!!
Wow epic on being able to do this and the 2.5mm subs!
Lucky boy
Congratulations Rick, you're living all of our dreams and I couldn't think of someone more deserving! Looking forward to seeing how well you played ⛳
Nice one Rick congrats mate your genuinely living the golfers dream everyday mate
Well deserved rick🐐
Well deserved Rick !
Much deserved experience for you Rick. Keep going, keep producing and keep being you.  You’re the main reason I got into golf - thanks ⛳️
Congrats mr Shiels on the 2.5 mill and 1 tick off your bucket list(video idea) 😂 that bag of Augusta merch would be a little tick off of my list to go with my memorabilia 😊
I knew it!!!!
Congratulations Rick well deserved 🎉👌👍
Unbelievable achievement Rick! Smashing it! 🏌️⛳
Wow amazing…. a dream come true for what I believe the 2.5M of us🎉

Living the dream Rick! What an experience it must have been.
How incredible! Good for you Rick. Couldn't have happened to a better guy! Keep up the content!
Well deserved.. oppertunities like that only happens because you are such a big promoter and working hard to make golf bigger and better 🫡🙏🏼
The grab bag from you will likely be the closest I would ever get to playing this course.   I can relate to that excitement of the first hole of an iconic course, coming from New Zealand to St Andrew's and playing that first hole of the old course had the same pinchme I'm dreaming effect for me.
Incredible!
Amazing that you played Augusta and in Masters comp condition, wow! I watched the interview that Sir Nick did with you and you asking him if he could get you on there for a round and when you interviewed him for your podcast and you dropping hints about playing there. Shame you couldn’t film it but looking forward to hearing about it and seeing your scorecard, mine would say 3 numbers for sure! 🤣⛳️🏌🏼‍♂️ Congratulations on hitting 2.5m subscribers, well deserved 👍
Well deserved Rick, looking forward to hearing about your week & the round
Awesome, one lucky man Rick!
If that first drive wasn’t recorded then I don’t believe you 😆 congrats, big bucket list item ticked off.
Congrats Rick!

Super cool, Rick. Congrats on the chance!
Congratulations sir!!! So happy for you🥳🥳🥳
Christmas is early this year! Congrats Rick that's well deserved!
Lucky duck! A dream come true my friend.
You’re the man Rick!!!!!
Love your work Rick!!! Break 75 in still shots maybe? 🫣
I'm absolutely chuffed for you lads!  That's incredible!  I can't recall, have you played Pinehurst #2?  If so, how do the greens compare to Augusta?

Big tick off the bucket list, what a privilege, well-done
Congrats Rick
You’re a very lucky man to play there. It’s a bucket list item for me that I will never get to fulfilled!
Congratulations! Well deserved.
What an experience to finish your time at Agusta. Playing in the footsteps of previous winners and hopefully not finding too much trouble. 🎉 on 2.5M, no. 1 golf youtuber confirmed
Entering. Let's go Rick!
For someone who will most likely never get the opportunity to even attend Augusta let alone play it, thank you for letting us vicariously live it through you. Congrats on the 2.5, and many more to come. Cheers Mate!
It's kind of surprising to me they let Dude Perfect film an all sports golf battle video at Augusta a few weeks BEFORE the Masters last year, but didn't allow you to film a golf round after this year. Oh well, I'm sure the experience was worth it even without a course vlog!
Hi Rick I m from India and follow your videos regularly. I love playing golf and regularly play golf in & around Nashik Maharashtra India. I am planning to visit Aberdeen Scotland in the month of July-August. Your videos are very useful. Congratulations for reaching 2.5 million subscribers. Cheers

DUDE!!!!!!! That's awesome!!!!
Feet
Love this 😍 Plenty of Texas wedges I hope 😂
Of course they didn’t allow you to film, I mean why in earth are they so closed off to the general public that they won’t let anyone see the course unless it’s on THE MASTERS, seriously, the rich and elitist smug attitude towards the working class is ridiculous from these people……
Congrats on the round
Oh wow. Dreams come true stuff right there. Well deserved
Wow. What an experience. That is Every golfer’s dream.
Glad you got to fulfil a dream Rick!
Congratulation to Rick and his team! 2.5 Million and Augusta at the same time! Great!
Awesome Rick, congrats on being able to play a 100% bucket list course!
I hope there was a starter that proclaimed “Fore please, Rick Shiels now driving”.  Or even “Fore please, now driving Rick Shiels”.  They seemed to say it both ways on different days. I would’ve cracked up if they said “Fore please, Rickie Shields now driving” though😂😂😂
Amazing to play Augusta. Thanks for sharing it with us.
So much history. Congrats getting to play. I have been there to watch 5 times.
Congrats
Congrats.  Look forward to summer content !
Fantastic Rick!!!

How awesome! Congrats! Great accomplishments and what a bucket list item!
Those greens must have been humbling 😂. You almost have to pinch yourself bc playing Augusta National has to feel unbelievable. Cheers to you, Rick, for experiencing a dream like that!
What champions locker was your group assigned and did you visit the Crows Nest?
How do you top that on your bucket list? Ill never be that lucky so a swag bag will probably be second option. Nice Rick!
Masters swag please!
Congratulations, what an experience
Oh, I am so disappointed that there won't be a video, but I can't wait to see what Rick shot around Augusta.

Nice one Rick, amazing place. One lucky man. A lifetimes dream fulfilled. 👊👍
Rick pulling up to the gates of Augusta National.  The guard puts out both hands and says,  "You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill... you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.". Rick’s response…”I’ll take the green pill…”. 😂

Hard to beat the experience of just stepping on that first tee, let alone playing a round. I remember as a kid when I was playing ice hockey I got to play at the arena where the pro team played … blew my mind … and I didn’t even support them 🤣
Good on ya Rick
So jealous, what an experience!
That’s awesome. Bucket list ✅⛳️🏌️‍♂️ love your content and also the way you explain your shot selections is great.
That YouTube grind is really paying off, well done mate

Congrats on the 2.5M, Must have been an amazing week to watch the Masters and then get to play. Well deserved! Keep up the great work.

That is awesome Augusta national is on my bucket list probably will never play it but it's right up there.Also I definitely will be try to get myself and the wife some tickets to go watch it live next year or there after😎
Gahhhh I wish you could’ve filmed it. Only watching tour pros play it surely makes it seem “easier” than it actually would be if I gave it a go 😅
Congrats on playing one of the best golf courses in the world
Love your enthusiasm you lucky bastard!
Wow the dinosaurs that run Augusta wouldn't let you record? Clickbait....
That would be a sweet prize.
Inspiring Rick. Congrats bro.
Congratulations on 2.5M!
What an Honor! Must’ve been nice😁
I feel ya that not many things feel better than hitting a perfect drive.   I just wanted to say that I probably hit one of best drives of my life on the first hole at Pebble Beach back in 2015. Unfortunately I had to give up the game entirely at the age of 37 due to an injury. It sucks but it is what it is I guess. I had gotten down to as low as a 1.2 USGA handicap, but typically played to a a  2.0.     I was playing with my dad and brother and we were watching people tee off for like 30 minutes or maybe even a little more before we  teed off. Everybody was either playing from either the regular tees or the senior tees.  My brother went up to the the regular tees, my dad went to the senior tees and I went to the tips. The starter came back to me to me and said “Are you sure you want to play from back here? This is is a pretty hard course.” I said “Yeah I’m good.” He asked me what my handicap was and I said “I’m a 2.” He said “Alright.”  I can’t really blame the guy. I’m sure he’s seen a million so called single digit handicap players that want to play the tips at Pebble Beach duff their opening tee shot. It is actually an intimidating atmosphere since there are a lot of people watching.   Anyway, I took my 3 wood out and aimed right at the bunker on the left side of the dogleg and just hit a bullet with a little cut. It was one of the purest shots I’ve ever hit. I just picked up my tee, glanced at the starter, handed my club to my caddie and started to walk down the fairway.
Looking forward to the full update. Congratulations on 2.5 million subscribers 🎉🎉🎉
Congrats Rick. Unbelievable achievement mate, fully deserved.
Congrats! I'm beyond jealous! 😁
That. Is. Awesome…… Nothing else to say. 🤩
So sucks there won’t be a video coming.

This is fantastic. Congratulations Rick🎉 absolutely love to see this!
How do you beat something like this?? Once in a lifetime. Congratulations!
Bet that blows the over rated Old Course out of  the water .   Seb should however face a firing squad for uttering the cliche "driving down Magnolia Lane"
Congratulations!
Ayyeeee big Rick on the course
Congrats Rick!  Can't wait to watch!
That would be amazing to play there especially a day after the masters.
Congrats Rick!
Congrats Rick!
Congrats team, great achievement, keep up the awesome content 🎉🎉🎉
Well done Rick. Congrats on all your success. You got to play Augusta!? WOW, that is incredible. Been wanting to go to Augusta for 25+ years as I have worked in the golf space for that long as a golf instructor. Maybe one day. Hope to get you on our live golf pod one day however I know how busy you must be. Mike and I (we do the cast together on the "Live" section of our YT page). We were just talking today how you have changed the YT golf landscape and one day we might be able to play in the YT Masters?! We have game, lol.   Cheers🍻Keep on doing what you are doing, you are blessed brother. -Rafael

Jealous.
Very jealous, congrats Rick!
Aw man, that is so cool. Golf is one of the few things that can make me feel a genuine sense of reverence for a place... Augusta, the Old Course, and hell, even the course in rural Australia where I used to play as a kid, Not bad for a silly, frustrating game where you use sticks to hit a ball into a hole in the ground.
you the GOAT Rick
That’s amazing! Congrats! Can’t wait to find out your score golf ⛳️
Congrats!!!
How awesome! Congrats Rick!
Break 75 at Augusta one day 🥲
Thanks to you I got back into golf and it’s been a great time chasing balls from rough to rough lol

I don’t know if I’d be more excited about 2.5 mil subscribers or playing Augusta… on second thought yes I do

Positively jealous you had the opportunity to play the course. Little disappointing that there won't be a video but then again... Probably was best to not film so you could completely soak it all in.  And if that wasn't good enough, hitting 2.5 mil subs on YouTube? Congrats on all your success. Hard work is paying off.
Congrats Rick! 🏌🏻Congrats on everything from your 2.5mil subs to being able to play Augusta to what you have planned for later this year!!

So sad you weren't allowed to film, but man is it cool!
If you finally broke 75 at Augusta I will literally get a tattoo of the scorecard and of a pimento cheese shaped like amen corner.    (And I hope you bless me with the dumbest tattoo of my life). Congrats Rick!
Rick 2024 masters champ?
Jealous is an understatement here
Congrats on 2.5M! 🎉🎉  Can't wait to hear you say you broke 75 on Augusta...maybe at the simulator!  To 2.5M more 🍻
Cheers Rick! Awesome
Congrats on the 2.5M! 🎉
Can't wait to see the scorecard.
Amazing!  Definitely a bucket list items for sure!
Amazing! I wish we could see it, but unnderstandable and consistent that AugNat wasn't down with any taping.
You lucky B*****d! Living your best life mate!
Awesome! Very jealous! Looking forward to hearing details from your round!
Brillant
Congrats on the bucket list item.
Congrats Mate! Looking forward to the photos!!!

Congrats on playing Rick!
Congratulations, well deserved 🎉
Congrats on fullfiling every weekend golfer's bucket list
Amazing Rick! Love your energy and good vibes
Congrats Rick, can’t wait to hear all about it!
bag of swag coming my way?
Break 75 Augusta National?
Hope I can win always wanted to go
So great that you got to play there!
What a dream come true
Not bad for a lad from Bolton, come a long way from that aerial swing video! Absolutely smashing it but more excited to hear the halfway house review 😂
Glad you had such an amazing experience.  Your growth as a YouTuber and golf influencer has coincided with my rekindled love for the game, so I’ve enjoyed your journey as it mirrors my own.  You should raffle off rounds with fans or something, you’d raise a ton of money for a worthy charity, Im sure there are thousands of fans who would jump at the chance to play a round with you, I know I would!
I honestly thought this was going to be one of those "on a simulator" videos.  That's incredible that you literally got to set foot on that course let alone play it.  Even better that it lived up to expectation!!!!
Did you say “swag”?   Pick me, pick me ⛳️
Playing Augusta National and 2.5 MILLION subscribers - what do you think 2011 Rick Shiels would have thought? 🔥🔥🔥
Looks amazing what an opportunity!!
Congratulations on a well deserved opportunity. Thank you for the great content. Excited to see what top 3 player wanted to get on the channel.
Well deserved! You’re running out of bucket list items at this point!
Congrats Rick! Would love to watch the round!
You lucky devil I love that place its the best course in the world.  Would love to be able to do that.
Nice
Happy for ya but it’s kinda trash that they didn’t let you make a video 😒
What an amazing opportunity. Can’t wait to hear all about the best golf experience possible.
Stoked you got to play that course!!!
Shame you couldn’t shoot video. Should’ve turned them down when they said no. 😅
Nice! What a cool experience and congratulations on 2.5M! Been a fan from early on and have loved watching your channel grow!
That is fantastic Rick and Seb!  Way to tick off a bucket list course!
Congrats on the milestone Rick! Keep up the great content. Very jealous you got to play Augusta National in tournament conditions tho.
Let’s gooo!!! 2.5 mil! Love the channel
Oh man! A swag bag would be awesome! Glad you played well!
Congrats Rick! Keep the great videos coming!

Wish one day I'll get to play a course like it
Wow. What an experience that must have been. I cannot imagine how good that would have been to do. Well done.
Kind of strange to invite the biggest golfer on YouTube to play your course and not let them film lol. But sounds like an amazing time nonetheless. Congrats!!

Bucket list course❤ 100%
So awesome for you Rick, I have been following for a little over two years now and have gotten my buddies to join along the watching. Cheers!
Rick!  You were in the U.S. and didn't even come by my house to say hello.  It is only another 2,500 miles west.  I can't wait to see what photos you have and hear about your play-by-play account on the course.   BTW, that bag of goodies sure looks good.  I'm down with Siactica pain right now and can't play much golf for a while.  I'll be back out there soon.  Your videos are so much fun to watch.  I especially like your accent! LOL
WOW. Lucky Fella.
Love your enthusiasm and energy! Always look forward to your videos after work. Congrats X 2.5million, and cheers to your continued success!🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations Ricky you lucky bugger can't wait till next video on how you were
I liked golf before finding this Channel. Your passion for the game has transferred to my game, and I appreciate it. Thanks Rick
Congratulations on being able to play at one of golf's meccas..........
You’re a legend. I’ve learned so much from your content. Keep the break 75’s coming!
Congrats Rick
Congrats! Can’t wait for the Augusta video
Awesome!!  I've been a few times and have a house full of Masters swag, so if I'm randomly drawn, give my winnings to a young aspiring Brit golfer who might not have the chance to get to Augusta.  Happy for you man! I have friends who've played it, but odds are really high I never will,  and I can only imagine the sheer joy.
Shame you couldn’t film but can’t wait to hear how you played!!
Congratulations on 2.5 million Rick! Happy to see you enjoying your time in the states. Your break 75 videos are great. You’re living the dream!
Jealous! But very happy for you at the same time!! can’t wait to hear the shot by shot
Amazing. Can’t wait to live Augusta National through you!
What an experience! Happy for ya but insanely jealous. No telling what I would hit there as a bogey golfer. 120-130?
Congrats on living every golfers dream 🍻
A dream come true!
It's pathetic it has come to this. "Not Click bait" YouTubers have too mention this 🤦‍♂️. Wow!
Well done, Rick. Love the channel. Teaching my girls (11 and 6) the game the past couple years has been a joy and we love watching we together. Hope you enjoyed Augusta!
Been there but could never hope to play it. Lucky guy u r. 2:25
Insane - so how did this happen - give us the details.
Good on you getting a chance to play this course! A one day dream for me.
You’re living my dream mate! Can’t wait for the shot-by-shot details!!

Sooo sick! congrats on 2.5 Million, been watching you for ages and you still help out my game, much love from Australia
So amazing. Can’t wait to hear the pod and see the photos! 🎉
Agusta National is so petty not letting no one video their round. No one gets to see it unless money is being paid to them. We peasants aren't worth of your righteous golf course. I hope this isn't what Bobby Jones invisioned. If so his legend takes a big hit in my opinion.
Can’t imagine what it was like playing augusta ! Can imagine winning that merch though 💯
what an incredible opportunity! I'm so glad for you!
Looking forward to the rundown!
Love it, well deserved.  Its just too bad that you couldnt film on location. But that must be the highest of everything
Three cheers for Rick! That's really incredibly awesome stuff!!!
Congrats Rick!
Amazing stuff Rick. Big follower of you from NZ . Take it easy
Congrats on 2.5M mate, OMG you did it
Wish you had some video.
Fantastic and congratulations for playing one of the most wanted courses world wide

Slightly jealous, Rick….
Can’t wait to hear what you shot. Hope you broke 100!!
Thats sad rick couldn't film it.😢
One very lucky man playing the masters ⭐️⭐️🙏🙏
Gimme that loot!
Come to Australia please
Fantastic Rick!!! Congrats!!! Best YouTube golfer bar none.
What dreams are made of. Good for you, Rick. We’re all very proud!
Congrats, thats a dream course for any golfer. Would've loved for you to be able to film it, that being said I understand Augusta not allowing it. Just maintains the mystique of that place.
No film for YouTuber, Augusta really are 🤡
That goodie bag would be amazing
Congratulations. Can't wait for the video breakdown.
Congratulations!
That's awesome, good for you. Bucket list item for sure.
Congrats ! Dream is to be at Augusta someday !
2.5 million! That is awesome! Almost as awesome as playing Augusta the day after the Masters. Congratulations!
Rick, fantastic channel and beyond happy for you and your success. Playing Augusta is a golfer's mount Rushmore.
Can't imagine playing somewhere like Augusta. This summer I'm hoping to head to my very first golf course God willing, can't wait to give a go at this awesome sport!!
Looking forward to the shot by shotcast!

Congratulations rick!!
Playing a tournament venue after an event is an experience. I played Copperhead (Valspar) a few days after the final day and you get to appreciate just how hard the course is for a pro event, in particular how fast the greens are, something you just can’t gauge when watching on tv.
Is it too late to get the swag lmao?😅  Glad you had fun mate!!
This is my dream! Congrats Rick
Thats amazing Rick!  Gratz!!!
#getin
That's awesome Rick! Living the dream!

It's the most beautiful course I've ever seen.  I was there in 1986, when Jack won his last green jacket.  It was the memory of a lifetime!  Can't wait to hear about your round!
Let's go Rick! Dream come true I'm sure
Congratulations on 2.5M!!!  I can't even fathom the excitement and even the nerves to play at a course that just hosted a Major!  The greens must have been beyond challenging!

Congratulations on 2.5 million subscribers Rick

Fantastic is all I can say.

Bucket List X 10!!
You know you had a great time when you hit 2.5 mil subscribers and that's just an afterthought for the video...  Congrats on playing Augusta and the youtube milestone!

Great job Rick, so glad for you. I have to be your biggest fan that has never played a a hole of golf , go figure..

I love you Rick
So awesome! Cant wait to hear the rundown.
Oh man I wish we could see video of your round, must’ve been something else. amazing either way! Cheers to you, Rick 🍻
Congrats, Rick. Love the content!

Golfbidder challenge with Pete and Augusta content all in one day? 15/10
Congrats Rick
Huge Congrats Rick! Thats a dream i'm sure you never expected to come true.
What an opportunity, congrats Rick! Look forward to seeing the card!
You lucky dog.   I’m jealous, but very happy for you.
Unbelievable and congrats!
I love golf.
Over/under 85👍👎
Congrats Rick! Very happy for you! God bless
Congrats on your 2.5M viewers. I love your content.
This will be an interesting summary.  The course is a beast.  I've played the MacKenzie course in Santa Cruz, Pasatiempo.  If you took the green contours from that course and added the speed of August, you would get staggeringly difficult putting.  And the slopes and odd lies on the rest of Augusta are much more severe than Pasatiempo.  I can't fathom how tour pros execute some of the shots they do at the Masters.
Congrats on 2.5 mil Rick!
Congrats on 2.5!
My friends pay for lessons, I just watch your videos
I love watching your videos been a long time fan. Wish I could go and golf it myself
Congrats on 2.5 million!
Awesome! Definitely a dream.
Just a little jealous
Epic rickie
They didn't let you film??
golfs good
Congratulations on 2.5M! You are so lucky to have actually played Augusta National! I have been subscribed for years now but haven’t commented before… I just wanted an opportunity to get that goody bag from the Masters. Keep up the good work always love the content #break75

I was squinting at the thumbnail to see if it was photoshopped lol
It's one thing to simply attend the Master's as a spectator, but to be able to attend the Master's AND play the course after the tournament is done is unbelievable!
Congrats on such a wonderful experience! Gotta be one of the bucket-list items for nearly every golfer, and glad you were able to enjoy it!

I started with a 22 handicap and now on 11 so thanks heaps for all the advice.  Another cool thing is that my wife is now getting into golf which is super exciting.  We both watched the masters for the first time and loved it, especially after watching Full Swing as well as having our very own Ryan Fox playing. Thanks again for all the hard work which helps people like me become obsessed with the game as well as so entertaining. Chur bro
Congratulations Rick!!!!

I just started to play golf last Thursday and I've gotta say I'm really enjoying it. 3 days in a row of golfing, and practice at the driving range. My friends who took me highly recommend I watch your videos for tips and they say my game has improved. I'm a new subscriber and I wanna say thank you and congratulations on 2.5 million subscribers!
You're a legend 💪🏼
Congratulations!!!
What a dream come true!  Congrats.
Congrats on getting to play there and hitting 2.5M subs! I knew I saw you on TV!
Dream of a lifetime!!! I am still on the waiting list to attend the masters, your one lucky bloke!! Cheers
So happy you got to play Augusta! Well deserved for all the hard work you’ve put into your channel!
Congrats, that opportunity is most definitely once in a lifetime!
I'm so jealous...lol. Congratulations Rick. Good things happen to good people and you are that I believe. I've been trying to get tickets to the Masters for I don't even remember how many years now but I'll never give up. Maybe one day the Gods will smile down on me. Looking forward to your next video my man. Cheers.
Congratulations Rick, playing Augusta National is a dream come true!!!
Congratulations! I'm jealous for sure, what a great day you had to have playing. Cheers!
Was very much wondering whether you would be allowed to film! Shame for us, but very happy you got a chance to play. Great job and well done on the 2.5M!
Not surprised that they didn't allow the round to be filmed -- not for trade-secret reasons or anything wacky like that, but because if people were allowed to do that it would undoubtedly slow down play. The thing I am a little surprised by is that there doesn't seem to be a member standing there with Rick and his friend for this video, which means either the member got them on and then didn't want any part of it (strange), or the folks at ANGC are hip enough to let an influencer on the course un-accompanied, which would be even less expected.
Well done Rick.  I am new to golf and I convinced my wife to watch the Masters with me Live in Australia.  Love to have some swag if you can spare some.  thanks mate.
Wait, what? How? Can't wait to get the deets!! Awesome 👍😊
Good for you Rick!
Congrats!
That is very exciting.  Looking forward to hearing shot for shot the experience.
No video? What kind of garbage is that?
Congratulations on 2.5 million. 🎉
What an honor.
OK. As an American there is no way way in hell I could ever getting a chance to play here. In my country this is bullshit. How and why?  Yes I'm jealous. My uncle got shot up in Germany to help save the European continent. My father served in the Pacific theater. The Americans keep paying the price to keep Europe and the world free and get the bill on top of that. F-this. I'm done being a subscriber after being one for a couple years. Next time Europe and Britain save yourselves.
Congrats Rick!  What an amazing opportunity!  Love all the content...keep it coming!
Living the dream!
Excited to hear what you shot.
Congratulations!!  That’s amazing Rick!!
Great video
Congratulations Rick!! Thrilled for you....
Awesome!
Congratulations to you on 2.5 million! You’ve done so much for the golf community, it’s hard to put into words. To put it simply: thank you!
wow. the jealousy. congrats on 2.5m, amazing stuff
Jealous
Looking forward to the updates!
You are the envy of the free world and probably a few dictatorships as well. What a get. Very happy for you.
Swag bag. Nice!
Congrats man!
I’m almost too jealous to say congrats on the 2.5 million! But I’ll say it anyway..
So jealous, congrats can’t wait for the content to come out. Next best thing would be to win the swag bag I’m sure you picked up some gems
Super Jelly!
That is amazing.  Congrats to you Rick!
Amazing Rick!  Living a life the rest of us can only dream of. Keep it up.
Congrats on the 2.5M but even more for leaving all of our dreams.  Can’t wait to see the pics.  Been trying to get tickets in the lottery for over 20 yrs.  One day.
Congrats on getting such a great opportunity!
Congrats on the new milestone and playing Augusta
Looking forward to the video (pictures and rundown anyway) :)
I would be in heaven, even if i was able to walk the course. That is awesome Rick! glad you are enjoying it out there
such a cool opportunity congrats on everything!
Cool playing in Augusta.
Augusta !
One off the bucket list
If you could hand select a time and place in all of the world to play a round as a non-pro, this was it. EPIC stuff. Very much looking forward to hearing about the round👍
What a cool experience
who got the green jacket???
Can’t wait for the blog with the pictures. Congrats on 2.5 M subscribers.
Congratulations Rick! Awesome content and hard work from the entire team have made this channel the best. What a cool experience to play at Augusta. Cheers to more content and bringing these special occasions to life for us.
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉2.5m🎉
Congrats on the 2.5M Rick. Love your content. What a wonderful experience that must have been. My father in law was stationed in Augusta during the Vietnam war. This time of year he always talks about the time he had a chance to go to a round at Augusta national but opted to come back home to Michigan to see his family instead.
Congratulations Rick!
Hopefully one day I can play it myself. What a treat that would be.
Congratulations, Rick! That's mega.
Congrats Rick! Wild experience!
Can't wait for the next coming video!!!
What a great life you lead!
What an incredible opportunity. Congratulations! Looking forward to the pictures.
Why don't they let you film?
Congrats rick
Getting pictures of your round at an such and iconic course is phenomenal
Saw you in the stands during the tournament. Now you’ve gotten to play afterwards. Congratulations on your success, you deserve it.   Best golf channel on YouTube for a reason!
LFG Rick!!!  I got goosebumps just thinking about being in your shoes!
Couldn’t happen to a better person
Wooo congrats on the 2,5 millions!
Y wife and I was there on Tuesday. Augusta is beautiful.
I’ve been there 4 times. But I am just a slob. I don’t get to play. So glad for you.
Congratulations Rick!
Congrats legend, well deserved. Can’t wait to hear the details! 👏💯🤩
Congratulations on both the 2.5M subscriber milestone and on playing Augusta National!  I'm curious as to how you were able to play it.  I have heard it is difficult to get on the course and you must be with a member.  If you can't answer that, I certainly understand.  Just curious.  Again, CONGRATULATIONS!
Happy for you Ricky, once in a lifetime opportunity
What an amazing experience that would be! Super jealous! I just want to walk the course as a patron someday... Maybe a swag bag will help take some of the sting away! Lol... Congratulations Rick!
Congratulations on 2.5m but even bigger 🎉 on playing Augusta National.
Let’s go! Congrats!
Congratulations! You are such a great ambassador for the game! Love the channel
Unreal on 2.5M and this experience. Well deserved.
Totally awesome! At 3M subscriptions maybe a contest for an opportunity to play a round of Break 75 with you? (Or a break 65 scramble?)
Keep up the great work Rick
Playing Augusta is awesome congrats on the experience!
You’re a very lucky guy. Great content. In it to win it…
Congrats Rick 🎉
2:25 wow congratulations I was lucky enough to attend the Masters this year for my 1st time, I can’t even imagine playing Augusta. Looking forward to the release story

Congrats!
Glad and happy for you that you got to do that! Looking forward to hearing more about it!
How’d you get on Augusta?! That’s awesome rick
Well I’m jealous! But very happy for you Rick! It has to be an unbelievable experience. Hopefully one day I can cross that off my bucket list as well!
Absolutely jealous right now Rick. I'm glad you got to enjoy that beautiful course. Keep up the good work!
Congrats
It must have been such an amazing experience, I can’t wait to here all about it! unfortunately my trip to Atlanta is a week late so I missed out on all the festivities, 🤞 I win the ticket lottery for next year!
Rock on Rick!
Congrats on 2.5M! Keep it up!
I am looking forward to seeing your Agusta round. And to winning the swag bag. LOL. Congrats on hitting 2.5 million subscribers.

Class that, Rick for the masters 2024
So jealous!
Keep up the awesome work. Love videos really wish you could have filmed your round there. Can't wait to see more amazing content.
What an awesome experience
This is not an easy invite for sure.  I’m so glad Augusta National let you play and at least take pictures of this.  Can’t wait to see the blow by blow description because no one does it better than you, Rick.
Love the content, can’t wait for the scoring video! Great to see you happy with your game again!
Congrats guys!  What a dream you two experienced.
Lucky dog, you!
Congrats on 2.5 million Rick!

So jealous!   Congrats on 2.5 million!
So happy for you! Well deserved on your latest subscriber milestone!
Congratulations Rick, on playing Augusta's course, Where the greens are impossible, and approach shots need the right club choice.  With skill and precision, you made the shots count, A true golfer's feat, and definitly one to boast about.  And in the golf world of content creation, the winner is clear, and this is why your subs are 2.5 million this year.
Frame that card.
Awesome brotha!
Congrats on the 2.5 million subs. Looking forward to hearing your score shot by shot. Also thank you for all your content it has helped my game to get to the 80s

I knew the masters were strict but dang would I have loved to see some footage. Anyways what an honor to play that course!
Looking forward to see what a golfer of Rick's caliber shoots under same course/setup as the best in the world.  My guess he doesn't break 85.
Let' 's go Rick!

Congrats! I can’t imagine playing a course as beautiful and challenging as Augusta! I think my game needs some work before I take on that course. Sounds like you had excellent weather as well.

Congrats Rick. You are a legend, what a dream course to play.
That’s awesome !
Lucky man to even get to see and watch the masters
The ultimate bucket list item. So glad you got to play Agusta National! Congrats!
Can’t wait for the update! Btw I wasn’t able to watch a lot of the Masters live this year and found any summaries lacking in telling the story of how the tournament shaped up. Any suggestions on channels or videos that nicely summarize the leaderboard moves throughout?
Increíble experiencia =)))))
Awesome Rick!  Congratulations!
what a great opportunity!
lets go rick!
Ahhh, no video. Good for you, though, must have been awesome!!
What a dream. Congrats Rick
Dude!!! So that’s St Andrew’s and Augusta in a calendar year!!! How do you top that?
I am definitely impressed. I am sitting here grinning from ear to ear for you. I can only pray to see that golf course on day.
A bucket list item i hope to cross off one day, Cheers!
What a accomplishment! I’ve been trying to get tickets to go see it for a few years now and looking forward to that chance!
Congrats dude! 2.5 million is huge!
Congrats Rick, well deserved! If you’re looking for a person to give the swag bag too I might be your guy. Last names Marsters close enough right lol
Congrats on not only 2.5 million but also playing the course! My friends got to watch in person and would love to some day!
You make watching golf fun Rick! We'll done!

Man, what dreams are made of!! Congrats on all the success mate, well deserved 🎉❤😊
Bosh

That a boy rick
Outstanding! Congrats!
Congrats Rick. Bucket list ✅
Go Ricky go. Good work lad
Going to the masters is an absolute dream!! Can’t wait to hear about your round on the podcast. Clubhouse member!!
Congratulations Rick!! That’s so sweet! 🙌🏻
Congrats on all your success Rick! You deserve it!
Way to go Rick, who would have thought when you started your you tube channel that it would lead to playing Augusta.  AWESOME way to go congrats on 2.5 let's get 3 million now. Take care.
Unbelievable, Rick - love you got the chance.  Travel safe!
Looks amazing!!! Rick “my main man” Shiels, sure would like a goodie out of that bag, to go in my golf sim garage
Daddy needs a new Augusta swag bag!
Lucky lucky man! Congratulations!
Playing Augusta National and passing the 2.5 million mark?  Someone is doing something right.  Kudos to you, Mr. Shiels.
Good for you Rick!  Your excitement is overwhelming!!  I look forward to your further analysis of your round at Augusta National!
you're the man rick, congrats!
Congrats on the 2.5M! Such a cool experience. Can’t wait to hear the breakdown!
I KNEW IT!!! I Knew you'd get to play it! I am sad we won't get a break 75 from Augusta!
Really cool you got to play there, Rock!
Guessing now didnt break 90
Not jealous at all
You dog!!!! That is a bucket list item for every golfer in the world. Congratulations on getting to walk and PLAY the hallowed grounds. I will forever be envious of the experience unless I get to play it myself one day. I was 20, now 44, when I got to walk around the course on a Masters Sunday and I vowed I would one day play there. I tried the amateur circuit for a while and am still a good golfer, 2 handicap, but don’t think I will ever get the chance. I’m about 3 years away from retiring from the Army though and it has been a great career. Keep up the awesome work with your content. Love your stuff, especially the equipment reviews. I use them whenever considering a club change. Thanks again and YOU SUCK 😂😂
Congrats on all your well earned success Rick!
Can only imagine how amazing that was!!!
Congrats on living our dream!
Love it. Thanks Rick!
Amazing! I’m very jealous but also very happy for you Rick. Well deserved 👍🏼🍻
Awesome 💥
Amazing. So jealous. Love the content.
Can’t wait to see the score!
So cool!
I'd like
Where did your tee shot on 12 end up?
Excited for the shot by shot video! Jealous
I'm extremely... extremely jealous but also insanely happy for you! Especially the day right after when it's still in full tournament conditions, I can't even imagine what that would be like. I would probably shoot 160 but it would be the best 160 of my life! Can't wait for the recap!
So.. so.. incredible!!!!!!!
W
Rick Shiels you have just played every true golf nuts heaven on earth. I could just see the true excitement on your face as you spoke of playing this masterful layout. I live in Australia and fear I will never even get to set foot on that hallowed piece of real estate in my life. I have one hat that was bought in the merchandise shop there during the masters of 2013 by a friend who did a masters tour. I still have it and was wearing it while watching the final round yesterday morning. That bag of goodies you have would be as close as I reckon I’ll ever get to the masters experience.
So jealous. Excited to see the score!
Congrats on all the success! Well deserved and unreal you got to play at Augusta. Could only imagine how amazing that moment must have been and crazy to think about how far you’ve come!
Congratulations on 2.5M and playing Augusta. What a dream come true!!
Awesome Rick! Day of a lifetime for sure! Was cool seeing you there on the TV right behind 12 tee this weekend cheers mate.
Congrats Rick!!!
Congrats Rick! You inspire me every video to get out and get better at golf!
Congratulations Rick. Well deserved. I love all the content. Keep up the great work.
I'm so jelly, it hurts!
Congrats Rick on 2.5 mil what an amazing experience to celebrate brother! The Godfather deserves the best!!
You’ll have to tell us more about how you pulled this off, amazing experience I’d say! Congratulations, what an experience!
Wow that’s awesome Rick!
Congrats on yet another milestone! Would love to have those Masters swags!
Wow…you are one lucky golfer….I would think Augusta is on pretty much everyone’s bucket list to just visit…..to actually get to play it is on another level!
Jealous!
Good for you!
That's awesome !
Amazing!! Congrats on everything!
What a dream
Every golfers dream indeed. You can tell Rick loved it. He's all giddy like a 5year old on Christmas 🎉❤🎉
Incredible experience I'm sure! Congrats on 2.5 Million. Well deserved!
Hope you played better than at sawgrass 😅😊
Congrats Mate !!
Looking forward to seeing your round amazing place.
hum....ill go with 91..thats what u shot
Awesome channel, been watching for years! Would of loved to have seen a break 75 around there, although you would have had to retire the series, nothing could beat that
Amazing Rick! Congrats on getting to realize every golfer’s dream! Well deserved

Crazy to have the opportunity to place such as course.

Wow Rick, Augusta National ✔️ off the bucket list.  You are truly blessed and we are all living vicariously through you.  What a dream!
I envy you lol. Congrats Rick that's forkin awesome!
How bloody awesome, what an experience that must have been!!
Wow! Congratulations what a thrilling opportunity! Looking forward to the photographs.

Sincere congrats Rick.  We all can only dream of having that opportunity.  Looking forward to seeing the full video.
I was born in Augusta, GA and never came close to playing Augusta National.
Absolutely living the dream! Can't wait to hear the recap!
Incredible! Can't wait to hear about your round!
What an AWESOME experience!
How exciting! Did you  see Jon and Ashley out there also?
Congrats on getting to play a round.
Congrats Rick!  Looks like you ticked off a Bucket List Item.
That is awesome!You deserve it!
Glad for Rick but I wonder why Augusta always has to be so stodgy and stubborn. Only a select few handpicked people in the Elite class get to be members so what would be wrong with letting us commoners follow along with their favorite youtube golfer for a round? What do you have to lose Augusta?
Rick, so happy you had the opportunity to check the Masters of your list. Glad it all worked out. Super excited to hear about it and see your score card. Also, I am excited for the Golfbidder challenge with you vs Pete!
Bucket list!!! Congrats on 2.5m! You da man!
So exciting !!! You guys must have been in golf heaven ♥️ Can’t wait to hear all about it !!!
Thanks Rick!!
What a dream to play that course!
Congrats on the subs and playing Augusta National. That's on every golfer's bucket list for sure!
2.5 does not surprise me at all. You deserve it buddy. Good content does that. Congratulations my friend
Congrats Rick!
Awesome Rick wished we could have watched it but none the less 👍🏻
So awesome! I can’t imagine the feeling the play Augusta! Congrats
Oh man that is awesome! Living all of our dream to play that course. You lucky guy but well deserved. Cheers!!
Incredible!! Did you have the Sunday pins and everything? It would be amazing if you broke 75 and beat rory's last score! 😂😂
That’s awesome you got to play it! That’s a dream come true! You definitely deserve to get the chance to play that course. You have truly improved the game of golf for millions of people that have learned from you and taken your advice on golf equipment. Can’t wait for the full video!
Dayum!
What a dream. Perfect weather conditions for you as well. Congrats
What an honor to be able to play on those hallowed grounds
Hey Rick, I am 16 years old I just shot 74 yesterday and I smacked the flag stick on the par 3 4th hole at my home course! Thanks for all the coaching videos, I really enjoy them. I also watch break 75 every week, I'm always excited for it! Congrats on 2.5 million too! And how amazing is it to play at Augusta National. My mom is originally from right down Washington Road from Augusta National, and she was lucky enough to see the final round at the 2000 Masters! Augusta is one of my dream places as well as St Andrews and Pebble Beach. Keep up the great content.
Soooo Jealous!
I’d love to get some masters gear
Give me masters stuff
Seriously had the thought the other day if you’d ever be invited to play a round there, congratulations!! This is incredible. CANT WAIT to see the video
Congrats Rick! I guess if there's one thing that can make a grown man giddy with excitement it's Augusta National!!
You sounded stoked about how well you played. Best drive ever on #1 huh? Lemme guess...you shot 82. lol 😂 😂
Congrats on 2.5!
Lucky duck

It’s crazy that we spent 5 days looking at Augusta National on national TV……yet you can’t film your round there….crazy.    Are they afraid you’re gonna spill some secrets or was it a time constraint thing??

Excited to see you pumped up about that round of golf. Amazing
If this course is as hard as people say , I could not break 150. It looks difficult on TV but probably much more in person. Watch out for that tree.

I happened to be in Augusta for dinner in a restaurant during the Master’s. I was 21 at the time and wasn’t even aware of the tournament taking place until one of the waitstaff let us know. That was 50 years ago! Who would have thought I would take up golf at the age of 68!
Congrats Rick
Nice job Rick!

Wish I could play there one day
Amazing that you got to play Augusta! It’s a shame you couldn’t film what is probably a highlight of your life though.😢

Wow, having enjoyed watching as much of the weekend’s golf, can’t believe you got to play that wonderful looking course. I myself went to Cape Kidnapper’s on the final day of the Masters after Jon won, which as you’ll know is one of a number of fantastic golf course here in New Zealand.

This is a comment?
That must of been an amazing experience. No one more deserving.
Well deserved but also gutted you weren’t allowed to film it! Content of you beaming all the way the course would have been legit!

If they won’t let Rick film at Augusta then we’ll never get any golf content from there. What a shame

Congrats on the 2.5 million. I would love to play Augusta someday knowing I would absolutely hack my way around.

Congratulations Rick!
This is brilliant news. Was hoping you’d get the chance to play Augusta National on your Masters visit. Great stuff!
What an unreal experience! Congrats, Rick!
Cheers to you mate! Great to hear you guys had an awesome time! Augusta is on my bucket list!
Congratulations on 2.5 mil+!!  Glad you enjoyed the Masters--I've lived in GA all my life and never been selected for tickets... over 10 years!  I wish you could have filmed your round!
What an honor. Love to see the magic of this course shine.❤
Congrats!!!
I'm hoping the shot by shot is like when I go through my rounds in detail with my wife afterwards, except with someone listening.
That is awesome Rick!
TV does not do it justice as to how beautiful and difficult it is.  Had the privilege of going to one practice round and it was breathtaking.
Saw you on the broadcast behind the 12th! Lucky dog.
Even getting a gift bag would be more than I could hope for .. a hacker like me isnt getting let out there anytime ;-)
awesome sauce
Absolutely  awesome Rick! Sounds like an amazing day, and beyond jealous! So well deserved!
Congratulations on the 2.5mil and what an experience that must have been 💪🏻🏌🏻‍♂️⛳️
Awesome and can't wait for the shot by shot!
Let’s go!!! Can wait to hear more about it!! We break 75?!??!
Iconic mate, cheers 🎉
So cool!
Congrats on 2.5M. I guess the Tiger Woods interview and playing round will be next?
OUTSTANDING... I'll keep dreaming about playing there. 😉
You're becoming the most interesting man in the world! Keep it up! 2.5M+++
Congrats Rick on 2.5 mil!!  I love living vicariously through you.
Love the videos. Keep up the great work.
Did you four putt on the first hole?  I hear that could lead to great things.😜
Experience of a lifetime. Your a lucky man Rick!!!
So jealous!!
Wild. Dream course for many that we will never be able to play. Congrats.
I am Jealous! Congrats on 2.5 mil!
Tiger shiels!!!
Congrats on 2.5m! Too bad this couldn’t be filmed into a break 75 episode finale or something like that. I bet it was an incredible feeling. Cheers from Canada!
I’m still rocking the Tiger Woods Titleist 975D driver from his time at the Masters! LOVE YOUR CHANNEL!!
Congrats for 2.5 mil! You deserve it! Love the content and cant wait for more.
Sensational
A golfers dream come true!! Can’t wait to hear the hole by hole breakdown of your experience!
Let’s go!
Just gotta get lucky one time!
Everyone’s dream congrats Rick
You lucky lucky man that's a dream for a lot of people who love this game
Congrats Rick, such a tremendous opportunity with the course being in tournament condition
Rick … love to get that bag, but can you describe the layout and what Tiger was able to achieve on one leg. Television does not do the course justice. I am so glad he chose not to continue - he was possibly doing it for Charlie to show him “Dad doesn’t quit” Maybe Charlie asked Dad not to hurt himself anymore “Dad, there’s always next year - Maybe I can Caddy!” Sounds good 😅
Awesome, Rick. Dream come true. Very, very jealous. Congrats mate!
Congrats on 2.5M!
Congratulations, Rick! That's awesome, and I'm beyond jealous! It's my dream to take my dad to play there someday.
Well done matey
Not gonna lie, kinda hate you right now... 😅😂😢 Not really, just jealous.
sweet!!!  i look forward to the podcast
Rick, finding your page pushed me to take more time to watch videos and understand the game so that I can improve. Thank you so much for the videos !
What an amazing time you must’ve had! Really happy for you brother!
This is amazing
It's a dream to play Augusta!
Congrats Rick!! Well deserved for all the fun content you put out into the world
Thanks to LIV these courses are loosening their grips.
Unreal 😮
Check that one off of your bucket list.
Congratulations, can't wait to hear the play by play
Awe man, too bad you couldn’t film, but still incredible!!!!
So happy for you and all of your success Rick! You've earned it!
Congrats Rick. Sir Nick Faldo hook you up with a member?
It's a shame you couldn't film it, but I'm very happy and excited for you. Look forward to hearing how it went.
Awesome experience you were able to do!  Bucket list just walk it. Jelly but 👍🏻 to you. Can't wait to see your production
Congrats Rick on 2.5 Million subscribers and getting to live everyone's dream and play that iconic course!
Congratulations on 2.5 Million subscribers and getting to play Augusta.  Thanks for sharing
Good for you, Rick! I can't even imagine how thrilling it must have been!😊😊😊
Absolutely jealous right now Rick!  So happy for you reaching 2.5 mill and can’t wait to hear about your round.  Definitely living vicariously through you 😂congratulations!
literal once in a lifetime experience
Congrats on the 2.5 mil. No one deserves it more!
Augusta National!!! After the Masters!!! Talk about a bucket list item checked off 👍 Amazing Rick - Good on ya!
Wow, that’s amazing. Would love to have seen the round. Congrats!
Congratulations. I’m from Georgia and know a couple of guys that have played there. I’m hoping for my turn one day.
Swag please! Great content!
My fiancé and I would kill to watch this video but excited to see the picture video with the score! Betting on eagle on no 2 🏌️‍♂️
you are in rare company now for sure.
What a dream to be able to play this course the day after the tournament, congrats on the success
Ya love to see it! Congrats Rick, well deserved.
I’m so happy for you Rick. My only complaint is if the PGA really wanted to “grow” the sport, being allowed to film at the holy grail of US golf would be the place to be. Can I you imagine with your teams video editing skills? Missed opportunity for sure
So awesome.  Can’t wait to hear more about the round.  Congrats!
That’s another one checked off the bucket list! Congrats!
Wow I wish you could film it one day, that would be a vid 😊
Congrats Rick just an absolute dream come true I'm sure. Happy for you and can't wait to hear more.
That's amazing. I live in Augusta and it's crazy around here for tournament week. Swag Bag!
Heck ya, congrats Rick on 2.5M. Would love some masters swag!
The stuff of dreams.
Well done Rick. Great achievement, can’t wait to hear about the score
Dropped to my knees in Walmart when I saw the title

Gary Player is not amused

I know I will never get to play it but I  hope to see it one day
2.5M is no mean feat! Congratulations! I can’t believe you got to play Augusta. Keep it up man. My son and I love watching your shenanigans
Good on you.
Wowza!! A dream just step  foot on grounds. And got to play! Question would you cash in the 2.5 subs to play again? Congrats
Wow how lucky are you playing ANGC
I'm so torn on Augusta. It's absolutely impeccable,  but it just reeks of old money and elite snobbery.
Rick, amazeballs, dreams can come true mate.
Congrats, you deserve it
Lucky, that is the stuff dreams r made of
Congratulations Rick! Can’t wait to hear the score!
Love the content Rick! Congrats on 2.5M!

Swag bag!!!
Jealous!! It’s on my bucket list
Completely myopic of Augusta National to not allow a golf channel w/ 2.5 million subscribers to showcase their course. The manager of that course should be replaced.
Congratulations on 2.5 million Rick, and what an honour to play Augusta! Can’t wait for the video👍🏻
What an amazing experience the day after the final round
That’s awesome! So, what was your favorite item on the Masters Menu?
Congratulations Rick! Can’t imagine what it felt like to walk the fairways and wanna snap a putter on those greens
Nice, must have been amazing. Wish we could have seen it.
Talk about a dream come true!  I can't wait to watch you recount the round!

Wow, what an incredible opportunity! Congratulations on getting to play Augusta and also hitting 2.5MM.

You deserve it for all this hard work during the last couple of years… especially for the charity walks! Keep calm and carry on!

Incredible how far you have come. Been following you for a long time, and while I miss the old days of you testing clubs in the hitting bay I do love the new stuff too! Sad Guy couldn’t make it, have really enjoyed him on the channel and podcast but I’m sure you brought him the nice stash back!
Whoop whoop! Congrats!

Rick that’s awesome! What an experience. How does it compare to St. Andrews in terms of history and grandeur?
hope your chipping...was above and beyond...
So cool! Glad you were able a bucket list course! Can’t wait for the breakdown! 🔥
AMAZING Rick! I was thinking what it would be like all week long while watching, and also asked myself, would I take the time to pick my head up and look around at the beautiful landscaping, or would my competitiveness keep my blinders on.  It sounds like you were able to soak it up! You just accomplished a dream for many of us.. Love your channel and congrats on both the 2.5 Million subscribers and the awesome write-up a few months ago in the top 100. Please let us know how jealous Finch is unless he was also there ;-). Send us some Swag. Cheers!
Congrats Rick!  Must have been amazing!
Wow,! Awesome
Happy for you Rick! Enjoy your continued success!
Wow Rick! I'm sooooo jealous!

Congrats Rick. Can’t wait to hear more about it on the podcast
So you didn't even have to wait for Sir Nick to use his influence?!?
Congrats Rick! I got to stroll the grounds during a Monday practice round for the first time last year in 2022. Dreams do come true and I was definitely overwhelmed! No words to describe Augusta National and the feeling being there! I’d love to play a round someday there too!🙏🏼 Have a safe trip back and God Bless!!
Come to the West Coast of Canada, Rick. The mountains and oceans would love to have you. If not, I will humbly accept the Masters swag bag as compensation. ;)

An Ex I knew had a family member who was a member, had no interest in golf at the time so I had no clue what prestige that brought with it.

Great stuff Rick!
Augusta! So cool!
Congrats Rick. Also, you are one lucky guy!

Here for the bag!
It would eat me alive but MAN what a dream it would be to be able to play there
Absolutely awesome, so glad you got to play Augusta National! Thanks for taking us with you. I have been lucky enough to attend, I can’t imagine what it would be like to play there.
Congratulations, Rick!  What a dream.
Congrats on 2.5m, it just goes to show you're doing things right.

What a lucky man to get to do this 👍
Congrats Rick!
What an experience. Such a shame you couldn’t film it.
Cannot wait to see how your limited chipping skills hold up (or roll off) on these amazing greens Rick 😂
I have been in the ticket draw for 45 years and never won. How do you and others get in without trying?
Let's go
Wow, that’s so cool. Can’t wait to hear details.

Congrats on 2.5mil 🎉
Wow. Happy for you Rick. Definitely on my bucket list.
Mr. Shiels, Where do I even start? My dream ever since i saw ur first video, was to play a round with you at any course or just go to the range with you. I have been a subscriber for so many years now from back to when you did your club reviews and the “how to fix your slice” videos and they have really helped me become the golfer I am today. It would be an honor to get that swag bag, not only because it’s from the masters, but because you held it! If I do get that bag, I will be sure to message you thanks and I hope we can get to the course one time!! Thank you for every thing you have done for me and every singe one of your subscribers!! Much love❤
Simply the best golf channel on YouTube…cheers
Rick has one of the best kept beards I’ve ever seen!😂. Thing is unreal!
Nice! Awesome job big dog💪
Rick, thank you. You provide such peace and happiness in a world full of anger and sadness. I look forward to every week hoping to see the wonderful game that brings joy to millions. Thank you for sharing your joy of the game.
Congrats, dream round!
Congrats Rick
Oh no! You were not allowed to shoot any video! WTF! That’s lame on so many levels and I do hope you explain why on your Pod Cast!
Content has been top notch!
so amazing!
Lets go Rick! I'm so jealous xD
Thats amazing!  Wish they allowed video, but still can't wait for the update of score!
I've never been more jealous of you Rick!
Man what a life you're living!  Congratulations sir, well deserved and earned.
Sick..Rick
What an amazing opportunity!
Imagine playing Augusta, mental!
You look like a kid in a candy store Rick..that smile from being there is mutual.. I was lucky enough to get to the Monday Practice round.. that place is unmatched to any other place on earth to me..if your like me...once I leave ,all I can think about it trying to somehow get back .
Pretty sweet if I do say so myself

I had a feeling this was gonna happen when I heard you were going to the masters ! You deserve it 👍
Congratulations! If it wasn’t for YouTube, I probably wouldn’t be as good as a golfer as I am now.  Thank you
It’s my dream to step foot on those grounds!
Can't wait to see the pics.  Congratulations on 2.5
Your an absolute beauty rick!!! Love how excited you are. Can’t wait to see the picture slideshow 🎉😊
That’s epic Rick!  I can hear the excitement in your voices.
Wow!

You are the envy of the golf world.
EPIC!!
Lucky man. How did you manage to play it?
Very nice!
Can't wait to watch the vid!!
Always a class above Rick! Great content and looking forward to the next video. #bucketlistcourse
Congrats, Rick! You're an amazing enthusiast and teacher of the game. If anyone deserves it, you certainly do. This channel is the entire reason I started playing golf. Love to see it!
Congrats! What an exciting experience.  Happy to see all your hard effort paying divotends.
That’s huge! Congrats Rick, that’s a golfer’s DREAM! 🙌🏻
So amazing!! What a dream.
I'm incredibly jealous of your life Rick 😮😮😮
I couldn't get anyone to take my merch order :( Congrats on a wild weekend
Did the giant greens help? 3X what I play locally.  You guys look really excited.
Can't wait to hear how you 3-putt bogeyed #1 after that sensational drive 😂 Keep up the great work, Rick!
Congratulations! Super jealous though!
Congrats on 2.5 mil! Had to be an epic round!🎉
Can't wait for the update on the scorecard!!!

What an amazing experience, playing the National at Augusta must be a bucket list place for any golfer.
Curious to find out the score Rick!
Incredible
Awesome Rick..very lucky man indeed. Love your work. My golf continues to improve. Thanks heaps
Congratulations on getting to play Augusta!  Looking forward to the recap.
Congrats on playing Augusta. Please send me the swag bag!
Congrats Rick! Will always be my top of the bucket list.
Love this what an accomplishment
That’s righteous Rick! I’m stoked for your success
Congratulations!  Check that off your bucket list.
Very cool!   Congrats and looking forward to the video.
Congrats Rick & Seb on the opportunity to play Augusta National.  Were you matched up with anyone?  It's my understanding that members of the press have a limited chance to be selected by lottery to play on the Monday after the tournament.
Brilliant, and congrats on 2.5m!
Well done Rick, sorry to hear you were unable to do a video of what must have been one of your dreams, playing this course.
round of a lifetime regardless of score....but.....scoring well would also help haha :) well done
Cool!
So happy you were able to play. Every golfer’s bucket list course!!! What’s next??
So Awesome!!!
Aww mayn, I was hoping to click this notification and see a four hour video around augusta. Excited for the rundown!
swag me up Rick!
You’re a golf and YouTube legend! You’ve helped my game a ton. Congratulations on the 2.5 and playing Augusta. Now about that goodie bag… 😂 Thanks for everything RS
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Well deserved, what was it like playing without being able to film.  I’m sure it felt a little odd.
So pumped you got to play there! What an experience that must've been. Congrats on 2.5M🎉🎉
Been a fan for awhile now. Glad to see you made it!
Congrats on a dream come true
What a dream experience. I am sure it was a blast!
Love it.
What an amazing opportunity. I’ve been trying for at least 10 years just to get tickets to a practice round.  Glad you got to play.
Wow! You are living the dream buddy!
Dream come true!
Congrats Rick! Amazing. So happy for you, and of course jealous over the moon😅
Hi Rick, great to hear you played at Augusta, I believe it was a Wonder experience, hope to see a summary of the game
Congratulations. Would love to know where it ranks in your favorite experiences in golf.
Can't wait to watch the complete run down of the round
Cant wait to see the vid!
You are a lucky man Rick.
Awesome Rick, congratulations!!
So jealous, big ups for 2.5M
Aloha Rick and thanks for sharing. I can tell how excited that you are from your experience at Augusta National. I am just a little bit jealous but you deserved the experience and probably did the course justice.😃😃
Rickkkk,  hell yeah.  That’s awesome!!
im so happy for you Rick!
Congrats on 2.5M….love your channel!!
I'm so jealous!!
Awesome Rick! Years of watching your great videos to finally see the dream of Augusta come to life. Big congrats!
It’s crazy to me that they are so strict on filming. In my opinion, it takes away from the course. If someone offered me to play a round at any course in the world, I would not pick Augusta.
Congratulations!
Congrats!
Congratulations on 2.5 mil!
Can’t wait to hear about the round at Augusta! Awesome to see that you played today!
#jealous
Unbelievable Rick, I'd be happy with an Augusta wooden tee
Oh Rick you lucky ————
Timber!
Thats #1 on the bucket list. Congrats on 2.5 million subscribers
Great video Rick!
Major Kudos Rick
Well ain’t that something I’m struggling to get a tee time at my local course and Rick plays Augusta 🙄
So gutted they didn’t let you film it. You know thats the round we all want to see. What an amazing opportunity for you Rick
Congrats Rick! Bummed there’s no break 75 on this one 😢
Congratulations Rick keep the great content coming
Awesome, congrats
Awesome, can't wait!
I've got Masters fever!
Not Jealous at all! Sounds like you had an amazing day. Congrats!
Unbelievable. I feel like Augusta should do a lottery system for normal people to play.
You need a new bucket list.
Can't wait to see the pics. Love the channel and can't wait to see what your opinion of the course is.
Amazing experience for sure! this has you as excited as I am to see you play Pete for the true Major of the year the golf bidder international!
Amazing, Rick! That is a bucket list item for me that will unfortunately never happen. So, that swag bag would be a nice consolation prize!
I can honestly say that I’ve never been jealous of any course you have played Rick, until now. Congratulations on the 2.5 million milestone. Keep up the good work
That's awesome Rick!! So happy for you!! You deserve it!! Can't wait to hear about it with a video and podcast!
Wow Rick, you sound excited!😅🤣
There are not enough golf balls currently made for me to play the Masters!!  Looking forward to your report - great you got to play it.
🎉🎉
Congrats!!!
I ham so jealous, the course of every golfer wants to play. Congratulations
So happy for you Rick. You are inspiring to watch and I love the enthusiasm especially at the end of this video like a little kid that just barely won his favourite prize in a box of cracker jack popcorn. I know… I’ve been there it is fun isn’t it. Way to go and thank you for sharing and I can’t wait to watch the follow up videos. Enjoy your holiday
Absolutely awesome!
I'm returning to golf after about  20 years , love your channel Rick !
Awesome content man!! Unfortunate that a break 75 video won’t come with it but it’s still great!!

you da man Rick!!
Congrats on hitting a milestone unlike any other!
Congrats Rick, this is awesome!
that’s crazy Rick, congrats man you’ve earned it.  Plz give me the swag bag haha
Wow.
But stiff they didn’t let you film
u should put the camera closer to your face
What a privilege. I had just been thinking that you have been playing so many iconic courses in the US lately. What will it take to get Rick out on Augusta National? I am sure it was a round that you will remember for the rest of your life!
Congrats Rick!!!
So sick.. guys living the dream
What a great opportunity! Thanks for bringing the great content and sharing with all of us.
Very excited for you! That is an amazing opportunity to play that course! ❤
What a joke. I lived in Atlanta for 5 years. Im a 3 handicap. Apparently you gotta be a 2mill plus youtuber to get access. F this game!!!! You gotta be rich or famous!  Mediocre Rick can play, but average joe GTFOH. Caddyshack was right!!!! Game built 4 snobs!!!!
I Wow, what an experience. Would love to know how you did on 13. Layup or go for it???
What a special experience that must have been.
Incredible Rick. You just made 2 million of your subs jealous
Congrats on checking off the #1 bucket list course for most golfers!
Such a great course, looking forward to the photos!
Bucket list mate. Amazing stuff. That bag of goodies would be a nice 40th gift to myself 😂
Done
I wish Augusta would get just a little bit of the stick out of their arse. If you invite a youtube golfer to play, you should probably allow some video content.
Congratulations Rick! Well deserved! 🔥
Congratulations Rick! Fantastic to see the years of hard work paying off
Super Jealous.  Congrats on getting to play and the 2.5 subs
Pick me!
Big Rick Energy!!! 🤣🤣
Augusta!? That's incredible. Way to go, Mate!!

hey rick! keep doing what you're doing mate. I've been turning on as many people as I can to your channel - because this channel has massively gotten me back into golf it's unreal to feel connected to the game again, playing and watching

Ladies and Gents… he’s made it to the top! Congrats Rick.
Congrats Rick!
Congrats
Congrats on 2.5m Rick and the Team! One hell of an achievement! Also congrats on you and Seb playing Augusta! You’ve made a lot of people very envious 😂

I'm only here for the swag bag lol
Congrats on the round Rick!
Congrats on 2.5!
Great stuff! Love your content :)
Let’s go Rick!! You’ve inspired our growing golf YouTube channel! Love your content and would feel blessed to receive the giveaway bag!
I think you just made 2.5 million subscribers very envious lol Good on you mate!
That’s so freaking cool! Millions wish they could do what you just did, so jealous. Congratulations, love your shows!
Jealous, enjoy the content...  hopefully you broke 75 😆
What an achievement. 2.5 million. Can’t wait for the first kid to win the Masters years from now saying he got his start in golf from your channel. Great content, can’t wait to hear all about playing a round at Augusta, what an honor! Cheers!
I just hit a 374 yaek drive because of what your videos taught me...and I chose the Callaway Paradym triple diamond. Wow! What a club.
Amazing! Can’t wait to see the photos!
Beautiful hilly course to walk can only imagine playing, especially the day after The Masters.  Congrats on the 2.5M
such a great life experience
Jonathon said exactly what I was thinking. "Every golfer's dream" is to play Augusta. The announcer's say that the cameras don't do it justice. I'll be  interested in hearing what you have to say about that. And, "Yes please", I'd love some swag.  Cheers, Jack Heather, Toronto.
Congrats, sounds like you had a good round. Can’t wait for the full recap.
If it wasn’t for your channel I would have never fell in love with golf, so thank you and congratulations on the 2.5!!
Happy for you, Rick. You deserve all of these wonderful experiences for offering your community the content you do!

I’ve got dreams to become a professional golfer and have been grinding. I’m so thankful for your Youtube channel and podcast. Love from Australia 🇦🇺
That's amazing! Someone (on reddit) spotted you in the crowd during the Masters broadcast - I doubt any of us that saw that post had any clue you'd actually get to play the course!
Yeah Rick!
Love the content
That’s awesome Rick! I’m really happy for you buddy. Would have been a shame If you didn’t get to play that course after traveling out there. Can’t wait for the Golfbidder Challenge against Finch this week.Don’t be a stranger to us here in the United States. Your fan base is strong here in the US, and we love you. BTW, if it wasn’t for you, I would still be slicing the golf ball for sure.
Congratulations Rick! Bucket list item checked

Congrats on 2.5 M!! Amazing that you played Augusta national, every golfers dream 🤩
You're the man Rick. I would love that swag!
So happy for you Rick
Congrats on 2.5mil Rick! Got into golf a year ago and have watched you since and the content has been awesome! Just went to St Andrews last week I can’t imagine how amazing Augusta would have been 👍
Awesome to here that you played Augusta
Congratulations Rick ! 2,5 M + Augusta golf round. My god what’s next !!! 😅
Love it, amazing!
Man. What a life rick is living
Excited to see pix & scores and hear the stories of playing on that amazing course.
Wow!!  That is awesome!  I thought I was lucky having been to a few practice rounds.  I cannot imagine how excited I would be to play the course.
The television coverage of Augusta does not do it justice.  I would love to be abused by Augusta National....9 handicap, would not break 90.
Lemme get that swag tho 😎 congrats bro
Dreams can come true, awesome
Congrats Rick! Way to go!!! Long time suscriber and I’m glad to see how amazing this channel and community has grown! Greetings from Mexico! 🇲🇽
Unbelievable stuff Rick, Congratulations!
Talk about checking off something from my bucket list. Congratulations!!
So jealous Rick!🏌🏼‍♂️⛳️
2.5 Million. That is more people that the population of over 90 countries. Congrats!
What an honor to play a place that prestigious.
I love Rick shiels!
Thanks for the awesome content
Rick, I have an idea. Re-create your shots in the new EA golf game...it has Augusta in it
Congrats 🎉
Imagine Rick broke 75 on Augusta of all courses haha
Rick, looked like a great day! Congrats! Bucket list ✅
Awesome
Amazing stuff! Living the dream of all golfers out there and were all here for it.  Keep it up!

Congratulations Rick...what an achievement 👏
Yay congrats Rick! Me and my husband look forward to your videos every week!
Congrats on the Bucket List check off!
Congrats rick!! So exciting
Congrats on 2.5M! I can't believe Augusta didn't let you film anything. It's not like we don't know what the course pooks like. Geesh.
Rick congrats on your subscribers
Incredible, what an experience of a lifetime for Rick!
Wow unreal! Dream cometrue
Congratulations Rick! You are living every man’s dream!
Playing Augusta National is every golfers dream!
Congrats on 2.5 million. Lucky dog getting to play Augusta.  Must have felt like heaven.
Congratulations on the 2.5mil. You deserve it. Love watching. I live vicariously though your videos. What a dream come true to play that course
Amazing!  Augusta is the bucket list of bucket list of Golf courses.
That must have been an amazing experience!
a legend on a legendary course
Way to go,Rick!  Augusta and 2.5 million subscribers… simply amazing. Congratulations!
That's great, haven't ever seen you beaming like you are now...
Wow. A once in a lifetime bucket list round. Congratulations 🎈🍾🎊🎉
Hit your best drive on the first hole, but did you 4 putt? 😳
You deserve it, congrats!
You lucky dog
Congratulations on 2.5 million! Very envious that you got to play Augusta! Cheers!
Congrats you lucky dog!! Swag from Augusta National is good, playing a round a day after a championship event anywhere is priceless!
Well done, can't wait for the recap.
Congrats on 2.5 million!  I’ve been watching when you were in the thousands and have always enjoyed the videos.  I love how down to earth and honest you have been.  Very refreshing.  Keep up the videos and keep true to yourself…it is how you got 2.5 million subscribers in the first place!
If I actually ever got to play there, by some miracle that will never happen, I doubt that I could even actually hit a ball. I’d be so ashamed of putting a divot in the turf. There’s no way that a doofus like me should ever be able to touch that course much less play golf on it. Just thinking of all the past champions that walked that course and all the iconic shots played, gives me the chills. But I’m glad you got to play it, Rick!
I was so confused when you said you played Augusta.  I was like, “How is this a break 75? There’s no way he filmed at the Masters, Augusta National wouldn’t allow it.”  Sad that I was right, but excited to hear your break down. Congrats on the round! Congrats on 2.5!
Augusta, unreal.  Love the channel.  You've been killing it the last 12 months!
Unreal. Congrats!
Looking forward to the details. Congrats.
That’s unreal Rick. Unfortunate you couldnt film but still going to be good to hear about.
swaggy baggy please
How were the sausage rolls Richard? 😉
Gealous doesn't even come close. You lucky lucky boys. Keep up the great work. 👍🏻
I’d love the bag!
WHAT A TREAT Rick !!!  Congratulations on your Dream-Come-True life & 2.5M subs!
What an opportunity!
Congrats on the opportunity to play Agusta and on 2.5 million!  My favorite player from the Masters this year was Sam Bennett!  He made all of us here in Madisonville proud!
Nice Rick congrats 🎉
Fantastic achievement Rick🎉
Nice One Ricky! Get that swag over to Australia! Cheers
Bucket list number one done already then....you lucky boys
Congrats Rick… I’d love to play there
Can’t wait for the update! Awesome opportunity!

Watched every minute of the masters love that you got to play such an amazing coarse.
Congrats! You are doing amazing things, and work harder than anyone. Keep it up and excited to see what more opportunities you get.
You are a very lucky guy.  Traveling to Augusta to watch The Masters is on my bucket list
I don’t think I have been more exited to see one of you course playing videos!  I can’t wait to hear all the details in the update video!  Congrats on 2.5 million subscribers!
Love your videos rick! This year's Masters lived up to the hype.
Amazing, Rick!
It’s a shame that Augusta National is so full of themselves… we would have loved to seen the video. Congrats Rick 🎉
Best round ever no matter how you play.
Good stuff! 🏌🏾‍♂️I’m from GA, born in Augusta actually!
Unreal
Rick, I can’t say enough how excited I am for you. So happy that you got to do this and glad we could all help you get there. Though I’ll most likely never play there I truly do take pleasure in knowing that you did. You put out wonderful content and deserve it for what you do for this great game we play. Cheers mate.
Congratulations Rick!
Suspicious shadows at 0:17… are you trolling us Rick??
Congrats!! Looking forward to the next one!!
Honestly if you broke 90 with tour conditions I'd be impressed.
Swag bag!

Holy cow Rick, so awesome. Incredible experience, can’t wait to see the recap
Golf is Life 🏌🏾‍♂️🏌🏾‍♂️
Congrats Rick 👍🏼
Congratulations it is a beautiful course. I watch your Videos 2 things I always notice it’s always gray sky and shag carpet greens . Those greens look like they putt as slow as our punched and sanded greens putt for 2 weeks .
Congrats Rick! Love your content and what a blessing to play Augusta National! Would love some Masters swag 😎
Nice Rick!
If there’s one way to celebrate 2.5 million that’s how you do it! Congrats Rick 👍🏼

Wow I was wondering if you would get to play! Excited to see the video and hear how it went.
Unreal stuff!! So very sad we cannot watch hole by hole, I think that experience would be incredible! But will be eagerly awaiting the shot by shot breakdown. Thanks Rick!
Gratz on the 2.5 mil! Subs
You know you've made it when... Augusta. (Oh yeah, and 2.5 mil, that too.) Congratulations!
How fun - can’t wait to see the video, even if it’s not “live” action.  Bucket list ✅!!
If only there was a video of the round.
Pick me Rick, pick me!! 🖐🏾🤞🏾
So if I gain 2.49million more subs I got a chance of playing Augusta!
Holy cow! I can’t believe your luck! Must’ve been amazing!🎉🎉🎉
Absolute Bucket List opportunity to play Augusta - very jealous.
What an unbelievable experience!!!
Why were you not allowed to film your round but  Dude Perfect were allowed to film their "All Sports Golf Battle" where they were throwing around tennis balls, baseballs etc on the course?? The people who are making these decisions are a bunch of clowns its unbelievable lmao
hell ya rick
Insane you got to play after. Can’t imagine how hard it was
Bosh, Rick!!
Congratulations and WOW!  2.5 Million and you not only got to watch The Masters but we’re able to play the course.  What a great week.  Love your content.  I continue to hope I will finally get selected for tickets after over several decades of the lottery.  Well done sir.
Love the content brother
Go get em' Shielsy
I was there Wednesday and looked all over for you. Really had hoped to meet you in person. Love the content, love the reviews, and love the break 75 effort you go through. Masters week in Augusta is a special time and I hope you had a great time in the area.
Beyond jealous of the courses you get to play, can’t wait to see the pictures and see how you did
That is soooo awesome! Hope you were able to do another Stacked Golf video while you were over here as well!
Love to see how far you've come over the past 10 years Rick, congrats and let's get to 3 mil soon!!!!

What an unbelievable experience!  Going is one thing and just seeing the course is a huge accomplishment. The grounds of Augusta are magical! But to get to be able to step over the ropes and tee it up and then get to putt on those greens 🤯 just wow  I think just playing with tiger is all that’s left on your golf bucket list ! Congratulations Rick

Lucky man!! Living the dream mate, keep it up!
Whenever a quality person says they got to play Augusta, you legitimately feel happy for them.  No jealousy, envy, or "why can't that be me".  In fact, the first thing I think of is "I hope they played well".  Congratulations Rick, I hope it was everything (and more) that you anticipated.
keep at it Rick!
Nicw
Wish I was good enough to play there lol 😂
SWAG 😂
Jealous and congratulations
What an amazing opportunity, and also well deserved!

Nice
Truly happy for you. You just checked off 99.99% of your viewers bucket list. Hopefully when you and Seb walked off the 18th hole Jim Nance was swirling in your heads - “A round for the ages.” Truly enjoy the content you, Guy, and the crew put out each week. Congratulations on 2.5 million viewers. Well done.
I’m glad you striped it on the first tee ! Cheers!!

Amazing course!

Congrats! Pick me for the swag

A buddy of mine and I were there for the first time Friday. We were hoping we might somehow run into you, but that’s like finding a needle in a haystack. Good for you guys! Just to walk around the place was an amazing experience. Can’t imagine actually getting to play it!
No words with how blessed you are my friend. Been following for over 6 years
Love your videos and glad you got to play Augusta National
Congrats Rick! So jealous but can’t wait to hear all about the experience! 🎉🎉
Human warmth and a buddy sharing his life experiences is how I feel as part of the 2.5 million following Rick along his golf journey.  Don't know how he makes me feel like one of his friends but that's how I feel! I don't feel like he is bragging or holding his life over mine.  I feel like a coconspirator in all of his hard work and good fortune!.  Thanks for inviting me on the Rick Shiels travel through golf.
You're so blessed 🙌
That’s awesome! Can’t wait to hear how you did.
I’m looking forward to hearing more about your round of golf!
Rick this is brilliant. You're enthusiasm is spectacular!

I wish I could play just one hole at Augusta
Cheers Rick! If you would’ve told me in 2016 when I started watching you that you’d play Augusta I wouldnt believe it!
Absolutely incredible, this is an experience of a lifetime for Rick, a well deserved one at that.
Holy moly! 2.5 million congrats! But then you put out great content so it will continue to grow! 🎉
Amazing. Can't wait to hear all about it.

Not much else to say other than #player
Very cool!
Shame you weren’t allowed to video, but it is Augusta CC after all.  I’m really looking forward to seeing the photos, esp your take about putting on the greens!  If I could play only one course before going up to the 19th hole in the sky, you can be sure it would be there!
Dream come True
Can’t wait to see video of your experience at Augusta National…..in picture form that is……congrats on 2.5 million subscribers
Very cool Rick! Congrats on 2.5 mil!
Keep up the good work mate! Give it up for the Spaniard🎉🎉
Well done Rick. Wish they would allow video so we could see that too.
I’ve been there many times from the mid 1980’s to just 5 years ago, I have friends who have played there, but I’ve never played Augusta National. Congrats !!!  Can’t wait to hear all about your day.
Amazing!!!
You lucky man. I’d sell my wife to play that course.
Love your videos!!! Keep the updates coming
I can’t wait to hear what you shot! My guess is a 75!
Congrats on getting to play! Dig the swag bag, would love to have it!
Rick is living that good life! Glad one of us normies got a chance to play this majestic course!
That's amazing! Congrats on playing such a historical course and with a good friend.  Playing right after the tournament to see the pro conditions must be awesome.  Look forward to hearing your experience.
Once in a lifetime opportunity. So jealous.

Awesome stuff and congrats on hitting 2.5 million!!🎉😊
Good on you Rick! Augusta!!!
Congrats Rick. That must have been an amazing experience.
having watched the masters i reckon 8 over would be a good score there it looks incredibly difficult . one of the pros said he could put a ball on the in certain places on each green and count it as green in regulation and you would still struggle to go under par because the greens are that damn hard lol
2.5 mil and Augusta? Awesome! You're an inspirational example of how working hard and following your dreams will lead you to amazing things. Well done mate!
Congratulations that's awesome
Congratulations on 2.5M subscribers! So envious that you got to play Augusta National!
I assume you got a pasty barm or an Augusta-style sausage roll at the turn?  Good for you, Rick.  Your hard work and perseverance are paying dividends.
Awesome stuff man!!
Congratulations !! Dream come true !! Keep up the great videos !!

I attended the 1989 Masters and watched Sir Nick Faldo win. The memories of Augusta National and the Masters are burned into my brain.  That is beyond bucket list for you. It’s also a just reward for all your hard work and dedication to the game.  Congratulations on a great experience.
It will only be a dream of mine to play Augusta National! So glad to see you had the opportunity!
You lucky son of a gun.
Congrats to you Rick!! Well deserved 2.5m!
this is amazing. The Masters is my favorite tournament. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'll be listening for all the beautiful details.
That’s amazing. Congrats Rick
Living vicariously through you Rick!

Such an amazing opportunity to play one of the best golf courses on this planet! Cheers to 2.5 million subscribers! On to 3 million we go!
Fantastic. Look forward to seeing the details of your around albeit by photos only.
Lol,  "no filming" to a youtuber is like telling a painter "no canvas".
Ws all round
You should be very proud of what you have built. Great content and feed back( yes you took time to give me pointers) and love the club analysis. Great Instruction for terrible golfers trying to get better to the celebrities you play with. Congrats on 2.5 million.
I’d love to play that course one day
Congratulations for 2,5M  🎉 an experience of a life time !!!
Congrats on 2.5 million Rick have been watching before you even hit 1 mil and love your channel   Really happy you got to play Augusta it’s a dream  Hope I could win that bag if Augusta goodies 😊

Can't wait to see the full video.  Great stuff Rick.
Awesome Rick!   Once in a lifetime esperienx I’m sure!

Wow Rick! How exciting!!! Congratulations!!!
Congrats Rick on getting to play Augusta National and on 2.5M! Playing a round at Augusta National is my absolute number 1 on my bucket list! Dream of hitting a tee shot on Golden Bell and around the corner of Azalea... Number 2 on my bucket list is attending the Masters as a patron, just to walk the grounds would be heaven to me, but to play it, is the dream.. So jealous but look forward to the full details..
Unbelievable!
Congrats RS! Can’t wait to hear the score!

How do they film the masters but they won’t let you film your round
Congrats Rick. Big fan of the channel. I grew up next to a golf course but never really played besides going to the range. Your joy for the game got me out there. Cheers and glad you had fun in Augusta.
Lucky you
Wow, what an honor that was and it must’ve felt really amazing and is so inspiring to all of us amateur golfers out there. I was born in Augusta, Georgia, but I will never get to play that course but that’s all right. I have found the love for Golf. Keep up the good content Rick we love you.

No filming is such a stupid rule. If there’s no event on the day there’s no reason for that. It’s a course like any other, if isn’t by the masters championship, that’s just a course.
Congratulations on 2.5 Rick hell yea
Unreal! What an awesome experience it must have been!
My daughter got to go to the Monday practice round and she couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful and amazing the experience was. I’ve ever gotten her to watch golf with me before and she was glued to the TV this weekend. Congrats on getting to play and hitting 2.5M!!!

You can really tell how grateful you are to have crossed this off your bucket list. Was hoping for video but can't wait for you to break down your round! Keep up the amazing content.
We drove through Augusta on Tuesday before the masters had to drive by the course.
Congrats, Rick! We’ll deserved 😊
Looking forward to seeing more of these videos!
Happy for you Rick! Sad you didn’t get to film it, but can’t wait to hear the story! Put me in for the swag
Weirdly was wondering if you might get to play as I remember Gary Lineker played on the Monday after he had anchored BBC coverage years ago. Chuffed for you it must have been an incredible experience.
What a dream
I'd love to play Augusta, but it would be hard to swing with a boner the whole time.
Cheers Rick! Jealous of your experience!
You won the 5th round!
That is awesome. Would love to have some merch sent downunder to this clubhouse member 👌
So happy for you Rick to have played Augusta as you thoroughly deserve it. I’ve always dreamed of watching the masters in person but as a broke uni student that’s not happening any time soon lol, I did manage to get two of my best mates into golf and actually enjoy it though thanks to your content and the masters this weekend so would be amazing if I was lucky enough to win the swag bag!
SWAG BAG ME !!!!!!!!! :)  Awesome :)
Your a blessed boy RS.  22 years and never a sniff of a lotto win.  Just looking to walk it once before I dirtnap.  Congrats.
I knew this was the news!! Absolutely fantastic! So stoked for you Rick!
Amazing
Well done, thank you for all your updates. I will continue to watch and learning from you
I legit got goosebumps when I clicked on the video seeing the title. Unbelievable mate I’m so so chuffed for you. I’ve been a fan of you for such a long time now and being able to play Augusta through watching your content is enough to make me more than happy!  Absolutely buzzing for this Rick. You deserve it 👏🏼🫶🏼
What an amazing experience well done 👊🏽
Glad you got to play the course and played well.  I would imagine shots around the green were extremely tough.  Looking forward to seeing the video of your round.
Sweet trip!!’ Can’t wait for the video…or photos…or photos video…😂
Thanks Rick. So looking forward to hear the update as ever. Always been a dream to play at Augusta. Dream big!
Looking forward to seeing your Masters around and hoping you come out to the West Coast for some excellent and challenging Southern California-Monterey and Oregon-Bandon Dunes experiences.
Been her since day one buddy
How cool is that?  How many balls in the water?
Awesome!  Congrats on your great experience and on the 2.5M!
A fitting reward for an amazing (continuing) journey. Congrats! 🏌‍♀️ Side note, I just typed in golf drive to use as a gif to send to a golf friends group and one of you was almost the 1st option, if anything I'd say that's more important than 2.5m subs
Congratulations! Amazing content
Pick me pick me!! 😂
Congrats on 2.5!
Congrats on 2.5 million.
Congrats Rick, what a great experience…

A dream for most of us, and access to play the course is generally so unattainable that it can't even realistically be added to the bucket list. Congratulations Rick, savour the moment for us all :)

Not being able to video tape it is hilarious. Just shows how out of tune golf still is with the rest of sports.
I dunno those pictures look photoshopped are we sure you were even there Rick?
Congrats, what a dream come true for you!!
Great work Rick, that must have been amazing
Insane! Every golfers dream to play on that course. Somthing special...
Congrats on 2.5 mil
I hope you took a lot of pictures!
Congrats Ricky!
You, my friend, are one of the LUCKIEST men alive ...
Let me get that Merch swag bag. I was down (Masters spectator) at Augusta in 2022 and got myself (and every golfer I know) some good swag. But I’ll def take some 2023 stuffs! Congrats on playing at that magical place. It’s truly surreal.
Homeric!
What an incredible experience!! So happy for you. You deserve it! Would love that swag bag! 🎉🎉🎉
Absolutely incredible to be able to play Augusta. I'm so jealous but chuffed for you Rick!

The video footage of you receiving the news that you where going to be playing during the recording of a podcast needs to be shown.
Congratulations on the 2.5 million subs rick. Amazing stuff❤
Congrats on the success and getting to play that beautiful course!!
That’s so epic…really glad for you man!
Pretty awesome Rick. What a dream come true! And congrats on 2.5!
Unbelievable. Once in a lifetime!!
And just when I thought you wouldn't show me anything I could be more jealous of, you went and TOPPED everything by stating you played Augusta.   I'll never get to go in person, so when it's on I eat up every piece of content I can find.  I'm not sure if you are excited if you got to play Augusta or if you got to play Augusta and BROKE 75?!?!?!?!?!?  Well done Rick..can't wait to find out what you actually shot.
Rick what a feeling that must be!! Chuffed for you man, your tips have brought me from a 22 handicap golfer to a 5 handicap, shot my first ever under par round Saturday -3 keep it up!!!
Must have felt like a dream! This is what we dream of as kids playing and you did it! Well deserved Rick!
I was there Thursday. I can't imagine actually getting to play.
I want the bag!!
Congrats!!! Absolutely Awesome!!!
Wow! What an amazing experience!
Oh my God the look on your face! Congratulations in my opinion it was long overdue! 2.5 million deserves more than just a round!🎉
Wow, what an amazing experience! One we don’t dare add to our bucket lists, and here you’ve checked it off yours!
Congrats. What an experience. I’m predicting a 79.
Congrats on 2.5m. You have accomplished something that very few common man has with playing at AN. Congrats!
Rick "I don't have any video of my round of golf, I was only allowed to take pictures." Rick's Phone "He had me on burst mode for 4 hours. Do I need a lawyer?"
What a privilege to get to play Augusta! Would’ve loved to have seen that round!! Congrats
Pictures only, no video. .. surprised they even let you take any picture taking devices out. Super awesome. I'll be watching.
Why is augusta so uppity on itself
Wish they’d let you film a break 75 but I’m happy you at least got to play.
Rick! Congrats on 2.5 million, that's epic. Even more amazing is that it helped you get to play Augusta, which I'm sure is every golfers dream. Unbelievable! I'm so jealous.
so happy for you rick
Congrats Rick! So jealous!
Congrats Rick, you’ve reached the pinnacle of golf
❤
Incredible! Very jealous!
Saw you on Saturday Rick! Twas cold as hell!!
Congrats Rick!!
Oh hell yah
Fantastic work! Well deserved and well played Rick. Content gives us high handicappers hope and awesome tips. Look forward to seeing the update soon!
Awesome you got to play under masters conditions!

Congrats Rick well deserved
Amazing stuff 🙌
Congrats on 2.5 million 🎉
This is amazing!! So happy for you and all the hard work!
Rick I caught you on camera watching the masters over the weekend! I'm also insanely jealous you were there. Maybe the lotto works in my favor next year!
Awesome for you Rick.   Can’t wait for details
So lucky dude! You should try Wilderness Club in Montana. It's a Faldo course and so so hard! So many bunkers and the greens are very undulating.
Crossing off a bucket list item! So jealous but so happy for you!
Augusta baby 😉
You live a blessed life, Sir!
I’m so happy for you to be able to get the honour to play there. It must’ve not felt real!
Congrats Rick
I moved to Atlanta 17 years ago and entered the lottery every single year and unfortunately I still have never got a ticket but I will keep trying
Awesome 😄 not jealous at all… ⛳️🌺
Congrats. I would love to 6 putt those greens one day 😂
Let’s gooooooo!!
I remember the podcast with the break for news, and I thought "Rick is playing Augusta...". Then, there were some comments in Sir Nick Faldo's podcast that reinforced my initial thoughts. Guess I was right! Congratulations, Mr. Shield! I wish you many more successes.
Congrats on the sub count and would love the swag bag!
I know Augusta is a very special place but they need to get over themselves a bit. It’s golf course, not a holy relic.   Why wouldn’t they let him film? Sometimes I feel like they make arbitrary rules just because they can.
What a lucky guy you are congrats
Loved it RICK!!?!!
Augusta National is gorgeous. I wish I could play it
You are such a nice guy I’m more happy for you than jealous. Looking forward to hearing about your round.
Sick.
JEALOUS! I'm sure you kicked butt! Congrats on 2.5 MILLION BTW!!!

Can’t wait to hear the score!
Excited for the new video. Hopefully I'll get to play it someday.
Just like his Tour lookalike, I'm expecting Rick to 4 putt the 1st, but then also the 2nd, 3rd, 4th..... 😂. No green jacket for Rick but the best golf chanel in the world with 2.5mil subscribers isn't a bad consolation prize! 👏
Did you break 80???

Congrats Rick. Looking forward to the full story
Amazing honor Rick. Congrats!
Congrats Rick!  2.5!    Let’s get 3!!  Love the content!
Congrats on 2.5 mil Rick! Shame you couldn’t film but I hope it was great

You are the reason I don't 100% suck at golf. Started during Covid as something to do during lockdowns now I can't get enough of it. Thanks for all those how to videos!!!!!

Its a good thing to see such a good chap to experience something like this. Happy for you Rick!
The moment we realize that Rick has been using these “Break 75” videos as practice rounds and this Augusta Round was actually to get his Tour Card. That’s going to be my favorite moment of the next video. 😂

Unbelievable!  And yet so well deserved for such an ambassador for the game!
Amazing opportunity. I would like to win the swag bag.

So much for requiring I’m pals with a MASTERS legend need to elbow your way on to Augusta National… 😝 Way to go!

I never knew I could be this jelous... so awesome for you guys! Congrats!!
It's unbelievable that you were able to get this one in a lifetime chance
Being a spectator at The Masters would be amazing, but to actually have the privilege of playing the course must have been out of this world.
I’m surprised the let you take pictures.
Hitting balls down the range with my eldest as it was absolutely chucking it down. I found myself really hoping the rain stayed away for the you at Augusta… jealous for sure, but genuinely pleased we will all get to share in what was clearly an amazing experience👍
Awesome
Augusta is a beautiful course. I was lucky enough to go to the masters for a day back in 1971.
Looks like you had amazing weather and conditions, Rick.  Bravo to you and Seb.  Can't wait to hear the report. Bucket list item checked off for you!  If you can include some idea of the yardages you hit your tee shots, and what was left into the greens, I'd find that very interesting.
Congratulations Rick, that's what dreams are made of! You just need to play a round with Tiger now (on your home course 😂) 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤔🥳🥳🥳
Been watching since some of your first slice fix videos. Your swing tips and course vlogs got me through some tough times and helped improve my game 10 fold, so naturally you deserve everything you've accomplished and it's amazing that you were able to play the most prestigious course in golf! Congrats Rick!
That must’ve been amazing! Congratulations Rick!
Incredible. Congrats on playing the holy grail Rick!
The Masters!!
Congrats!

Awesome treat
What a once in a lifetime experience. Congratulations.
Absolutely amazing. One can only dream of playing that course.
Sometimes I watch Rick's videos and think his putter is holding him back.  Then I remember my whole bag is holding me back and he's actually an amazing golfer.  Look forward to the shot by shot.

Very proud of you and the team Rick. Make no mistake we as fans, supporters and even patrons (see what I done there 🫡) contribute to you being there but fundamentally you are there on complete merit. Your content is undoubtably the best on social media, simple. I honestly love seeing you having so much fun so genuinely thank you so much for the last 3 years of my personal viewing, I really look forward to many more years!   Put it this way, if I had a chance to meet and play golf with you would be the equivalent of you getting the chance to play Augusta 😅  Much love ❤, G x

Wow... 1st kudos on hitting 2.5 million subscribers.  That's incredible.  With that said... what a once in a life time opportunity.  Being able to play Augusta National honestly makes the score irrelevant when taking into account the opportunity.

Congrats Rick. Hope you enjoyed the experience of a life time. Thanks for all the content, my two year old loves sitting and watching your stuff with me and is obsessed with playing “gol” he’s already got a better swing that me.
Wow you are the envy of all the weekend hackers.  Check out the golf course called Geneva National.   It is in Lake Geneva, WI.  This golf course has 3 courses.  The courses were designed by Palmer, Trevino & Player.  I love the Player's course and the 13 hole is the signature hole.  It is an elevated par 3 with tall thistles in front of the tee box.  Play a club smaller on this hole.  The have a hole guide for each hole.  I would love to win the gift bag.
Awesome video! So jealous but you deserve it! Congrats Rick!
That is amazing!! From one Rick to another congratulations on the milestone and the bucket list of getting to play Augusta!!
Amazing! Dream come true I'm sure! Can't wait for the pictures!!
The ultimate round of golf, so happy you got to experience it.

Can’t wait to hear more details. Congrats!
I have been to the Masters when Tiger won his last Masters (2019). It was an excellent experience to be able to walk around the course and have a couple of their egg sandwiches and watch the greatest players in the world play. And by the way, there is no flat part of the course, it is either up hill or down hill :)
You’re so lucky. Playing Augusta National the day after The Masters. Incredible. And congrats on 2.5 million subscribers
So happy you got the chance to play there.  A friend of mine told me if I played the course, it would ruin golf  for me (because I a not very good).
Brilliant ! What a great opportunity.

NO WAY, RICK - you played Augusta National?! The Master's is my Super Bowl, World Series, World Cup, Kentucky Derby, Olympics all rolled into one - I am a HUGE MASTERS NERD. Congratulations on 2.5 subscribers. I have been watching your instruction videos for year and they have helped my game SO MUCH. I am a better golfer because of you! Would love to play with you whenever you come to the Pacific Northwest!
Congrats on the dream come true, Rick!
Where you at the 12th? I thought i saw you when Tiger was there. The experience at the Masters must have been amazing

Good stuff Rick!
Happy for you Rick. What a day
What an incredible honour to play Augusta. I won tickets in the lottery for the Wednesday round, but I wasn’t able to attend due to not being able to travel after suffering a back injury.
What a life experience! Congrats
i called it when he put it on his ig story when he said something big is coming on monday!!!
Incredible experience!
Atta boy Rick! Can't believe we get to see our lad play Augusta!
Knew it
Congrats on 2.5M and for getting to live out a dream for any golfer!
Congrats on playing Augusta... and in tournament conditions! The 2.5M is well earned. ✌️
Awesome! Put me in for the swag bag!
Congratulations on the round and 2.5MM!
Very jealous.  I have friends who have friends that know Augusta members.  They all are aware if they are ever invited to play and need a 4th I will be that guy no matter the day or time.  Of course the invite will never come.  Guess I will have to get some Masters logo stuff and dream.
Let me guess...more strokes were taken on every green, than were needed to reach each green.
Absolute scenes, happy for you Rick!
Congrats on the 2.5 mil and congrats on playing Augusta. Would love to get a chance to see the Masters in person.
Amazing, can’t wait to hear all about it. Always bringing the best content🤝

Congrats Rick, what an honor to play Augusta, cheers!
Looking forward to the video. 😊
Once in a lifetime experience. Strong work Rick
I can't think of anyone more deserving of 2.5M subs, let alone a round at Augusta. If anything, I'm glad you were'nt allowed to film. You got the chance to play one of the most iconic courses in all of golf *without* the pressure to make content while doing it. You earned  that 1-on-1 experience with the course and while we might have lost Tiger on Augusta this weekend, we got Rick on there. Awesome stuff pal.
Great times in Augusta this week despite the weather...I was out there on Saturday and enjoyed every minute of every raindrop!! So glad you got to play the course how awesome!! BTW of all those on the list to see, you were the only one I didn't get to check the box. maybe next time...
Congrats Rick!
Wow!   You will have to do 1 big video or several videos about Augusta.
Congrats on 2.5 mil!!!  These past few months you’ve played some of the most prestigious places in the world.  Appreciate it.
Riiiiicky!!! You are living EVERY golfer’s dream. Hope your enjoyed your time in Augusta
Congrats!!  Biggest bucket list item in golf!
Congrats rick! Well deserved, glad you got to experience this!
Safe travels home!
Ricky, well done. You deserve it.
Congrats mate. Been around since before 1M subs. Lived watching the content grow and evolve.
Congrats on 2.5m Rick, unbelievably envious of you for playing Augusta!
Congratulations on 2.5 million! Sad that we won't get the video content but I'm sure it was incredible
glad you had the chance! amazing!
On every golfers wish list. I bet the course was amazing.
No way! Being Rick does not suck! Continued success Rick. Love to content, and really looking forward to the golf bidder video!

Jelly
That must have been amazing
Really excited for you but gotta admit I'm a little disappointed you a actual golfer couldn't film your golf round. They fact they let Dude Perfect film a non golf film is kinda disrespectful and upsetting.
Congrats. So lucky.

No video?? That’s so disappointing… but I’d still love the swag :)
Congrats Rick 2.5 is huge!!!
Congrats on 2.5M!

Shame you couldn't film, hope that let you be in that experience even more
Unreal, congrats 👏🏼👏🏼
Proper bucket list stuff that. Looking forward to the break 75 photo edition
I couldn't imagine how hard the the chipping and putting would be there regardless but especially playing your first round with no practice experience there. You see the best golfers in the world struggle with those things there despite spending hours practicing around those greens for a bunch of different days in the week(s) leading up to it, along with many of them having played the course dozens of times throughout their careers.
That is amazing, what an experience that would've been. Congrats on reaching 2.5M subscribers Rick!
Congrats on playing the masters!:) A dream come true. This years masters was such a great tournament to watch and must of been amazing to be there. Love the content your putting out, keep it up Rick❤
Congrats on 2.5M! I recently started playing golf again after about 12 year break but with your videos I'm hitting the ball better than I ever have before!
Hello from the States Rick CONGRATS on the round!!!!!!
Amazing course, what a place! It was crazy watching the pros on the greens putting on Sunday, so underrated!
Ily❤
What an amazing experience that must have been, congrats on 2.5M!
Wow! Hitting 2.5 million subscribers and a round at Augusta, congratulations!

Congrats on the 2.5 million subscribers Rick!

so jealous
congrats, what an experience
haahahaha /r/golf spotted you in the gallery and i absolutely lost it
Way to go, so jealous!
Most popular golf personality in the world  and a bunch of old white guys still don't understand his reach.  Not shocked.
Awesome news Rick! The king of YouTube golf getting the royal treatment he deserves!
Wow!  Very exciting.  Come to Frisco TX and we can play the new PGA course.  They say it is the “American St Andrews”.  LOL!
Mad lad finally did it. He actually played Augusta.
So Jealous!!
I will watch an Augusta video by you reading your score card and narrating still photos. That’s how much I love the channel and how much I’d appreciate the swag.
Good stuff!!
Going to make for a great podcast this is!
awesome
Epic!
Unbelievable Rick!! Undoubtedly deserved.
Missed out on the / break 75 at Augusta/ would have been an incredible video
Awesome Rick! Can't wait to hear about it and see the pics 🙌

Congratulations on 2.5mil. You, Seb, Pete, Andy and Matt are the reason I play golf. Got me through a pretty difficult time in my life recently too!
Congrats on 2.5mil! Not jealous at all that you got to play Augusta 😜
Wonder if that course is tops on his bucket list. The challenge to get in the place may only be exceeded by the challenge of playing the course!!
You deserve it Rick!
Only way I'm playing here is through a golf simulator!
Bet the kid growing up golfing in Manchester never saw that coming! Unreal, dream come true
Congratulations Rick. The Things dreams are made of. You certainly have earned this opportunity with all the hard work and fantastic content over the years. Can wait to hear all about it Phil 👍
Outstanding and motivating stuff!

Smashing it ☄️
Nice one Rick and seb

Brilliant from Rick and all the team, hopefully Augusta start to embrace the YouTube world more and relax there rules!
What an amazing opportunity and definitely a once in a life time!! So glad you’ve been able to play this course and can’t wait for the video to come out!
You’re the man Richard, Congrats
Congratulations on reaching 2.5 million followers, Rick! Your passion for golf and dedication to helping others improve their game has clearly resonated with so many people. It's amazing to see how much your channel has grown over the years, and I'm sure your upcoming commentary video about your experience playing Augusta National will be another great addition to your content. Keep up the awesome work and looking forward to your future videos!
Rick couldn’t be happier for you getting to play Augusta, no one deserved it more than you! Smashing the content at the moment 👏
Wow! So jealous! Thrilled for you. You’ve been talking about playing it for so long!!
Amazing! Congrats on 2.5 Mil and that drive on #1! 🤘🏼 one day I hope to play it somehow some way! Haha.
Congrats Rick, 2.5M subs are great. But the real sign that you’ve made it big is within this one video. Playing Augusta after the masters is an achievement every golf fan dream of but only select few achieve.   Going from small time driving range pro to number golf creator on YouTube to playing the Augusta. Unreal.
Looking forward to the full video.
Congrats on 2.5m Rick!
Incredible, well deserved
Congrats! Can’t wait to watch the recap!
Love to see it!
Man, you’re living the life. So jealous but so happy for you.

Congrats. What did you shoot?
Congrats Rick!
Wow.  It is cool to hear a normal guy and his buddy got to play Augusta.  Didn't need a million dollars to tip the starter to get on or nothing!
Congratulations on the 2.5m subs!
Do you ship to Japan?!?!
So amazing for you Rick!  What a bucket list item to cross off!  Congrats.  Looking forward to the breakdown
Quality
But did you break 75!? What an amazing once in a lifetime experience! Playing at the Masters (venue). And how good is that merch! I want the yardage guide please!
Thanks!
Your channel got me back into golf approx 8 months ago after 10 years off!! Chances of me playing Augusta are non existent but maybe I have a chance at the swag bag!!?? Thanks for making great content!
The question is though…. Was the pimento sandwich as good as a sausage roll in the UK?
Congratulations Rick on playing Augusta National. I once had a chance to play on Media Day in 2001 but a missed communication left me out of the mix and I've never gotten a chance again. But I have been to the Masters 7 times and I'm still awed by the course.
Must be a dream come true Rick 🎉🎉
I am excited that you finally got to play it. amazing. Hope I win the swag but I am chuffed ( learned that word from your podcasts) for you!

Congrats Rick!
Amazing Rick! Excited for your next video as playing in a competition condition couldn't have been easy!

Hope you had a blast
Way to go, Rick! Looking forward to more USA content. Also, maybe a bag fitting with our northern neighbors at TXG???!?!?

Well done mate! Sounds like a dream and really pleased you hit some nice shots. 👍
Pretty much completed golf now? Gutted you weren’t able to film it but we will enjoy your run down. Maybe animate it TopTracer style?
Congratulations, you da man!
swaggy baggy
What a dream come true! Nice drive on the first!
Awesome experience 🎉
Rick, Did either of you ya' break 100? How many extra strokes would an average hcp 16 golfer shoot over his average 18-hole score, playing it for the first time in fair weather?
How many times did say beautiful while playing? love all your content! God bless
Pls give me the swag bag I’ve never won a competition😂
Good on ya mate. Can't wait for the follow up video.
Lets GOOO!! That is exciting so cool you got the opportunity to play that course!
You the man Rick, golfers would give up their slice to play that course. Seeing that course on TV doesn’t do it any justice. Magnificent in getting 2.5 million to subscribers. I find your programs the best tutorials on You Tube and FB. Keep up the good work.
Awesome!!! Bucket list!
Way to go Rick!
Pick me ricky!
Congrats on the 2.5 Million subscribers Rick, keep up the great content, keep pushing
Awesome Rick, happy for you

You are a lucky man Rick.  Still dreaming to one day get tickets just to watch in the lottery each year but I cannot imagine getting to play it.
I am over the moon happy for both of you!!!! A fantastic honor at what I feel is one of the greatest golf venues in the world. And of course, just a wee bit jealous. Congratulations to both of you.

Amazing! Dream come true!
Very jealous of your roujnd at Augusta! Well done on 2.5 million too :)
I don't get jealous very often,  but I can't deny I am green with envy. Bet it was everything I could imagine.
‘Fore please , Rick shiels now driving ‘.. class mate , can’t wait for the shot by shot review!

Jealous is a massive understatement !  Grats on the 2.5M
Oh man! I'm getting excited for Rick being able to play on Augusta! I can definitely feel the excitement from Rick's voice playing in Augusta! Definitely a surreal moment in life for sure! Funny how a few weeks back on Sir Nick Faldo's podcast you dream of playing there but has a high probability of never doing so but here you are now! Congrats on the opportunity Rick!!
No one deserves this more than you Rick, cant wait to even just hear about it!
Congratulations, Rick! on finally getting to play one of your dream/bucket list courses.

That is amazing!! I have flown out of August but never been to the masters, let alone play there.. Dang that’s exciting!!
WE KNEW IT!  You'd think they'd let you film seeing as they're trying to grow the game and modernise. They could control it even if they wanted to.  Buzzing to hear all about it brother, well deserved!

Better play the lottery Rick.  Got to go to Augusta to see the Masters, played Augusta National, AND hit 2.5M subscribers.  You are on a hot streak!
This channel is going up!

Amazing. Can't wait for the rundown!
Great reward for all your hard work
Look forward to this update on the podcast!! You lucky dog!!
#swagbag

If you’re going to hit the best drive of your life, it better be at Augusta National!
Wow! The literal dream. Congratulations on 2.5M!
Rick and Seb u lucky lucky lads!!!!!!!
Wow, only a Dream for most of us.
Amazing, bucket list ✅️
Can't be you couldn't video it what a vid that would have made. Sure the pics will be amazing tho
Can't wait to see your score. Congrats on the subscriber's
Stinks you couldn’t film it! Can’t wait to hear how you did on some of the iconic holes!
Omg…. How how how…. ❤❤❤
I suppose 2.5 million subs has its benefits after all. Congratulations!
Unreal 2.5m and playing the Master track, Mint!
Awesome experience!!! Congratulations!
dream come true!
Wow, there’s a memory that won’t soon be forgotten. Well Rick, you said you played well. Good enough to beat Peter Finch in the 2023 £500 Golfbidder Challenge?
Congratulations on playing Agusta. I can't wait to see the pictures. 🙂
Unbelievable huh?  It’s the one and only thing on my bucket list! Luccckkkyy!!!!!
Now for the obvious... Augusta vs The Old Course?
An amazing opportunity
cant wait to hear the shot-by-shot breakdown. It will be exciting to hear how the greens were.
I played another course in Augusta that predates the Masters course. I proved conclusively that I could not drive a golf ball through the trunk of a pine tree.
So glad you got to play Augusta! Too bad you couldn't film it (but understandable). I really enjoyed your Bay Hill and TPS Sawgrass videos earlier this season. When I wanted the tournaments from those locations I really felt I knew what the pro's were facing based on your videos!
Congratulations on the 2.5 million subscribers Rick!
That's awesome! What a dream to be able to play that course! Glad you got to take some pictures, those memories will last forever.
Long time watcher- first time commenter… happy for you man!! Congrats on the 2.5 and a lifelong memory! Would love that swag bag.. ya know.. if it’s available 😅
That's killer Rick! So glad that you had the chance to play Augusta.
Lucky duck
Unbelievable, Guy will never hear the end of this! 😂
What an experience! So jealous!
Congrats and that must have been an amazing experience playing Augusta!
I have learned so much from watching your videos. Very practical and helpful. Thank you and congrats on Augusta.
Amazing, gutted we can't watvh you round the course!
Check that off your bucket list.
Good job Rick!
Wow....just effing wow! :)
What a weapon
I don’t think you were excited enough!!😂 looking forward to the recap!
Nice! Looking forward to winning the swag bag!!
Congratulations @RickShielsPGA . I couldn’t be happier for you! Can’t think of a more deserving individual to be given the opportunity. You’re such a wonderful advocate for the game!
That is unbelievable Rick! Probably the greatest experience a person could have! Hope it was as good as it looks from my couch!
Incredible… glad you hit the ball well
Such a shame you couldn’t film it. We are all jealous
That's so cool!! Bucket list item : Checked!  Well done Mate!!
So cool! Nice on Rick
Sad that Guy wasnt able too be there and play as well!
If only. Would've been a dream come true!
That was awesome.
No way! I would like to just see the course let alone play it.
Congratulations mate!
Would have been one hell of a break 75 episode but I’m excited to hear how it went
once in a lifetime opportunity! Can't wait to see how you did!
What a great experience you had.
Gutted u couldn’t film it ad love to watch that 😢
You have to tell us the scores. Haha. In the podcast I guess.
Why the fuck did the other group get to film playing with baseballk bats but not Rick golfing.  Sems unbelievable stupid.
Unfollow. I can’t deal with this level of jealousy😂
Augusta National the day after, it must have been playing firm and fast.  Seb looked like he was still mid-epiphany talking about the experience - in all the best ways.  Looking forward to the stills and the breakdown of the round, Rick.
Bucket list experience for sure !  Can’t wait to hear about your round, and your short game !!
Love the content Rick!  Glad you got to check that off your bucket list!
That is amazing
All I can say is congratulations mate on what you have achieved
Congratulations Rick on the 2.5m…amazing!
Let's go! So glad you got to play. What an opportunity.
Bro, you got to live the dream! Congrats!
Nice one Rick.. shame you couldn’t film… send me some swag….👍🏻
What an awesome experience! So cool!
Congrats Rick. The excitement is infectious. You seemed to have had a blast. Can't wait for the update.
Let’s go Rick
Every golfers dream, congrats Rick! Keep up the great content!!
sweg
So jealous, congrats!
Me, Me, pick me. Watching from Australia....
That's amazing!! You know you've made it when you're playing Augusta haha!!
What an exciting opportunity! I could only dream of doing that! Congrats
So jealous!
Awesome for you Rick! Hope it was everything you’ve dreamt of. You may have been the one to play it, but I’d like to think that 2.5 million of us were right there with you!!
So awesome!!!
One of these days I will feel good enough to justify the trip
⛳
Way to go Rick. Dream round right there
Let’s go Rick
Man bucket list just to go watch, but to play….you’re a lucky man Rick!
Good to see all your work paying off Rick!
See this is what kills me with golf. It could balloon to such great heights if they just relaxed some of the tradition. Not get rid of it entirely as that is what makes it what it is. But just relax it some. Could you imagine how mega the video would be if they had allowed Rick to record. Would bring so much more hype to the golf community. A shame really. Glad you shot great and got to play the course Rick! Looking forward to the breakdown video!
Sooooooo  jealous , but very happy for you.
Love it rick
Lucky son of a gun, glad to see them allowing more players to play it
Wow what a cool experience!
Congrats Rick! Once in a many many many lifetimes opportunity!
congrats mate, happy for you
Congrats on ticking off a bucket list item!
Been there in 2007. Never played.
Unbelievable. Definite bucket list for any golfer!
What a dream! Amazing stuff can’t wait for a seb on golf video also!
