'oops somebody dumpling no get fondled tonight got me dying
3:45 I can't imagine how many people you got with that.😅😅😅
I love how you always support potentially lesser known businesses, by showcasing their factories or restaurants on your channel. It would be so easy to follow other people and just choose someone who is already famous.
2 trays of bamboo steamer for 30 bucks is crazy, who would pay for that?!😂
anyone here in 2026
Tbh this is really interesting. We all eat foods and never really get to see the kinds of places they get made from
Uncle Rodger is forklift certified
So what happened too these guys, because now I see the ads of you supporting a different Dumbling brand Mila, is Mila better the Nephew Caleb Dumblings
My name is also caleb
My favourite actor is also scarlet Johanson
CEO don't know shit....😂😂😂
Din Tai Feng, Fuiyoh!
XCJ is now MìLà, in case anyone was wondering.
I feel like the why the people that you love always leave you was personal
bought it from costco Irvine, I tastes way too porky and kinda smell, not very good.  2024-08-27
pretty cool how you eat a bunch of dumplings but later you take a giant dump.
That much msg would give someone Tourette's 😂😵‍💫
I googled it. I should have stayed curious…
white people out here really believing in bat soup? lmfao sounds about white
Please put your comedy video's in youtube

Uncle Roger why so hamsap fondling dumpling
Those sandwiches are so delicious
Are these dumplings halal?If anyone knows  pls tell me ❤😊
No bats 😂
Anyone want dumplings 😅

Truffle  super good though. It’s the only mushroom that isn’t slimy and sad.
You should try NEpalese dumpling too.
“Ask him to give you raise, he useless” Only Uncle Roger can force a strike for a whole company like that 😂
dimsum guy lowk look like elon musk
U cant do that in a forklift
Steamed dumplings are fyyyyiiiiuuuuuuyyyyyooou. Im trying this brand, thank you uncle rodger
Huh so dumplings are just tortellini
Uncle Roger added the ultimate pimpage to that machine 😂
This is true proof of his love for msg LoL 😂
4:32 nooooo fkin waaay

Uncle Roger being canonically forklift certified is the best part of this whole thing
This is now called Mila. These are the best ones on the market.
Is he really fucked up that meat?! OMG!! 😂😂😂
If your talking about the mushroom truffle that is disgusting
I googled meatspin I regret so much 😭😭😭

I hope I never live to see the day Uncle Roger hates MSG 😂😂   (not that it will ever happen)
Omg i acutally looked up meat spin and its something else omfg
i wonder how many of the msg caked dumplings are gonna go to customers lol
My mom was like "aAwWW hES MaRRieD👹"
I live in seattle
Hi Mr. Caleb , may I suggest you also do a Halal version of XLB for the Muslims community and non pork eaters ?  Hahah ,being with a Muslim partner, I am going to miss XLB so much and I really wish that there was an alternative for Halal version of XLB that is delicious  so I can share this delicious Chinese cuisine food with my love ones . I am also sure it will market well . ( Chinese business mindset ) And thank you Uncle Roger @mrnigelng for this awesome videos . Sending love <3  Thank you ! - Singapore fan
I love dumplings but I find them tricky to find in the major supermarkets in the UK.
3:46 if you spin your meat like helicopter. You fucked up. Litteraly. 😱💀   Please DONT GOOGLE IT. It the other type of meat  PLEASE DONT GOOGLE IT
Uncle Roger seem unhinged.
Red hair nets and jackets are due to the fact that they are using soy, which is an allergen
Wow, they just let him ruin a whole batch of dumplings. 😂
He straight up dumped the whole bag of MSG in the meat… 💀
Is auntie halen real?
Did he seriously ruin an entire batch?  Haiiiiiyyyyaaaaa
Why does nephew Caleb look like Elon musk tho 😭
Hope he paid for and ate all that meat he dumped msg on...
First time I ever heard of this company. I will go buy their product I suppose.
A soup dumpling with a mangetout filling?  Now, THAT is what I call a sandwich, fda 😂😂😂
Google meat spin🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The term sounds like a trivialization of dumping 🤣🤣 Why do yellow people eat garbage? 😱😱
Pure gold!! xD
4:26 POV: asians when you add 0.1 mg short of MSG:
WITH SOME EXTRA FLAVOR ☠️
I wish i could afford these but i still poor college student
Wait Uncle Roger is forklift certified? Fuiyoh!
Uncle Roger stay roasting Jamie Oliver 😂😂😂 what did that man do to you?
Eight dumplings is the minimum!
Auntie Helen was a roasting statue
With his comical content, it is now running out of ideas vs mark wiens, other content providers/chef with solid substance. His numbers will climb very slowly. He is not a chef, he is not a foodie traveler eater. He is a comedian but often commented on other professional cooking styles which ain’t his forte?
How about Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory?
Wait so you do cocaine like you drink a shot?
I dont understand how ru so funny, ur my favorite person :D
Imagine buying your favorite soup dumpling just to get a mouthful of msg
“fondling” 💀💀💀💀
editor says: dont search it Me: instantly searches it up
I want the MSG dumplings lmao
Bro calls everyone nephew/niece
Frozen Xiaolongbao is great, but the skin often crack or break before it reach our freezer.
who else googled meat spin?
That bag is flour. Not MSG
Uncle Rodger seems like the type of guy to inhale msg
am i the only one who thinks the owner looks like Elon musk
I already searched meat spin but I still don't understand anything. Can someone explain to me what is it?
“Been married eight years .. of course not”… I got nothing
Dumpling is sandwich   Everyday we learn something new
Uncle Roger making his own dumpings but it aint long bao… its MSG long bao 4:20 XD
MSG stands for Make Shit Good
lol

Uncle Roger: dumping half the 50kg bag of MSG  CEO:  *calm*
If this wasn't a year old already I'd be more worried about those filmed OSHA violations. 🤣
Just recently discovered you! Nice to meet you Uncle Roger 👏🏼👏🏼😂
I had a good laugh with the extra MSG hahahhahaha lmao
I love how the MSG dosages just keep getting bigger and bigger overtime 😂
MSG = become the doctor and almost make your father be proud of you
Owner is the asian Elon Musk
I am Malaysian nephew, I love eating xiao long bao also . DELICIOUS😃
I didn't hit like because I'm not a white person
I really love soup dumplings it is super good of the soup inside the dumpling
Whats the name of the brand
In vienna we have illegal dumpling factories in flats for that.
Hey uncle roger have you ever heard of …vegan dumplings
Why do the people you love always leave you?😂
yea i wont be buying from what ever they are calling them selfs now
I like truffle
Too much MSG
I love seeing uncle roger around other people and watching them adjust to his personality
guys actually do not look up meat spin l look it up and is weird
Uncle roger do not deserve to work and what’s wrong for being vegan???ppl can be whatever we want like I feel so angry and sad
All aunties love uncle Roger except Auntie Helen
i searched meat spin. DONT. DO. IT. You will die
za zumpling factory
OK, for real though... Din Tai Fung is amazing.  So is Steamy Piggy in San Diego.

I'm not white I'm black
The magnet lifehack had me laughing. 😂
Nephew Caleb looks like Elon Musk
2:32 Unless you're a _Natural_ girl called Fauna (Wrong point)  (Reason: #KroniiIsHungry
So much hate for Jamie Oliver. I wanna see uncle roger vs Jamie Oliver in a boxing match
I saw chilli jam in my local farm shop! I was so angry I almost broke the jar but I didn’t want to because I don’t want to get arrested lol
sandwich got me cracking up
The Dislikes are from the Asians who hate truffle.
I think that too much MSG
I lost my shit seeing him dump like a pound of salt into the 5 pounds of meat 😂😭
Why caleb looks like Elon.
Fuiyoo! it looks so goOD
I have these dumplings in my freezer. Best fucking dumpling I’ve ever had!!
when he looked down after uncle roger put the msg in there he must be thinking "haiyaa you waste it"
Don't worry uncle Roger I am also lonely👍
Regret googling meat spin
Is there dog or cat in there?
That Ghost in a shell reference 👌 🤣 🤣
I Regret Googling Meat spin
Makes me wanna go grocery store to get my chili oil

Uncle Roger right, ceos useless, get more pay!
So expensive for me haiyaaaaaaaa
Your so pussy just name it killed me 😂😂😂 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
'Amber Heard lawyer' 😂
"We've been married for 8 year so of course not" That is comedy gold right there.
If Jamie Oliver was there he will  probably put chilli jam in them  Jamie : chilli jam soup dumplings , yaya! 😂
Are the chicken or shrimp ones halal?
just wanna say to  believe in Jesus for he loves u so much that he died and was raised from the dead so that u can have a relationship with him. Believe in him and ask GOD for forgiveness of your sins :) and turn away from them as well (repent)...❤❤❤❤
So weird how you sniffed the weirdest white powder ever- flour.
“Think about your sad life, why do the people you love always leave you” 💀💀
so much msg fuiyoooh i need to subscribe
One love...msg,fact or factory???
Love your videos Uncle Roger. However, I trusted your recommendation and flew to Seattle to have XCJ's XLBs but it was one of the worst ones I've ever had. The dumpling skin was super thick. Meat was not flavorful. There was little to no brothy goodness inside. Hiiiiiyyyyaaaaa!
"Your wife fondle your dumplings like this?" 😂 1:24
I looked up meat spin I'm traumatized
Nephew caleb looks like elon musk
2:26 i thought those  white powder was msg when u said white powder lol
What the Fuck! This place is in Washington!?!?  I am gonna eat the FUCK out of these Dumplings.
Uncle roger just invented workers unions
I Googled it....
Magnet
Dude I freaking work here 😂😂😅
Meat spin
Cultural appropriation I say cultural appreciation
20:17 07/02/2023 Tuesday
Where do you buy that extra flavor soup dumplings from XCJ?
I need to check this place out! I'm only 3.5 hours from Seattle, not too baed. Recently tried these based on Uncle Roger's selection and they were delicious! Already have a nice bamboo steamer basket, so didn't get one of those. Amazing to see how they're made, weird about how the FDA classifies these as sandwiches though.
This is the funniest shit ever 😂🤣
Soup dumpling are my favorite! 😊 thank you Uncle Roger!!!
Did u rly put that much MSG,but im serious bcz u did that too noddles too😅
Caleb missed an opportunity.  Just mix in extra meat untill it's edible and sell the uncle Roger batch at 50 Euro a bag. Put on a nice sticker and make it exclusive.  It's gonna cost you money but I recon it would be great PR.
Too good 😂
Ooh thanks for the code! I just placed my order online. Can’t wait.   Uncle Roger causing all kind of trouble in that dumpling factory. Fondling ‘dumplings’ and talking about getting fingers stuck on hump day. Lol.
I am from Germany and I am so sad I can't get these 😕
@mrnigelng Uncle Roger needs to watch this whitewashed wonton soup: https://youtu.be/LEqxP7ZUz7Q OLIVE OIL!
People Who Google Meat Spin Reply Or Like This Comment

I swear Caleb doesn't like Uncle Roger🤣
Ayoh what special recipe
1:00 most white thing uncle roger has ever done, because we all know asheyn neva wehs foo.
I know how to make this at home and not fuck off
Thank you Uncle Roger! Chinese Soup Dumplings were new to me,  now they are my new favorite food.  Dunk a dumpling in the  vingear sauce, then top it with a little chili oil, now that is good eating! I'm awaiting my second order.
Caleb wang is the elon musk of dumplings
uncle roger is the embodiment of the phrase "why use more word when less word do trick"
"Somebody please eat another bat... we put the whole world on holiday for 2 more year" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
alternate title: 10 minutes of uncle roger attempting to bypass safety features of various appliances.
"somebody dumpling not getting fondle tonight" THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO MUCH
Uncle Roger: Your machine fugged up 6:53
When he said white powder I didnt think flour, or that other one, I thought of msg

“Hey random question how do punish your kid?” “Um, I assault them with a frozen dumpling,why? “I have to go-“
Hope I get the dumpling with msg
I tried Xiao Long Bao once and I loved them so much
bro was acc so calm when he poured 3 quarters of the huge back of msg
Uncle Roger and the Dumpling Factory. He found the golden steamer and got a tour
I cannot believe uncle roger did an asian stereotype on a failing machine  The machine has a skill issue XD
Does he really not like Jamie Oliver or is it a joke? 😅

Truffles, the fancy alternative to letting a stray cat piss on your food.
At 5:37 I couldn’t stop laughing omll 😭😭

Nephew Caleb looks like a Asian Elon Musk

'Uncle Roger favourite Asian actress is Scarlett Johansson'😂
i went and googled it
I'm Crying π^π
What type of stuff do you watch uncle Roger? I Google meatspin and saw much horror
What a treat to get a finger in a dumpling …
$40 for a bag of 50 baby dumplings, plus shipping? AND they won't let you combine the 1st time order discount with the Uncle Roger discount...they cancel each other out. No thanks. I'll stick with O'Tasty.
Uncle roger be like : gets 4.444.444. Vews 😂
We've been married for 8years, so of course not! ☠
The safety officer off camera is losing their mind!
ye dont seach it up
Been british i dont wannt take your culture we most likely  already took your stuff already
Oh man I Google’s meatspin 🙈🙈🙈. To be fair you did offer a warning
I am white, and I hate truffel
the face at dumpling as sandwich
That way to much msg
How did uncle Roger get away dumping so much MSG in there fuhyoooo
4:35 Uncle Roger version of Xiao Long Bao➡️MSG flavor
2:20 Is Uncle Roger saying "好吃(yummy)? "
I love uncle Roger English accent 💟
Uncle Roger and Caleb showed out on this video. This is was an awesome choice of celeb to promote the brand.
Cool!
1:17
Aww but I love din tai fung
Uncle roger *pours whole bag of MSG MoRe fLaVoUR
"this is vegans worst nightmare....flavor" roflll
The young owner gives off Elon musk type vibes. Might be socially awkward with people joking/trashing their product but seems like a cool guy
Good to know meatspin is still around lol you spin me right round
I can't believe Caleb let Roger do all this shit 😂😂
3:43.Omg I remember meatspin from when I was a kid 😂😂
Anyone else think the dumpling owner look like the asian version if Elon musk
What if you put your hannd then close the lid
Too much msg will kill you
Had the same reaction when Caleb said the FDA consider dumplings as a sandwich
Meatspin bra 😂👍
I am white people what is truffle?
shiao long bao has ginger for that delicious flavor
He say dumpling i click the wijeo
this frozen is piece of sh*t . Trust me, I am Chinese and this is the worst product. These frozen are clotting together and you must broke it to depart from each other. Pay more attention to the packaging and improve your product. Improve the stupid package!😅
I didn’t watch the video yet but I know that uncle is gonna dump MSG
Asian Edibles
Msg
I just ordered 3 bags of dumplings.  Fancy you uncle Roger for watching your weejio. SO disappointed no Dan Dan noodles. Hiyaa! Emotional stomach taste damage
They looked so tasty. Loved the tour of the factory. :D
FUIYOOOOOOO
When he snorted that msg I was in tears laughing so hard..
Now I know why he said not to search meatspin
Ok. I quit watching your videos now. I used to like this channel before I seen that you take nothing seriously, not even when cooking with someone else’s food. I thought Gaga would beat the sh*t out of you for messing up those steaks. Now you just dump a big bag of msg in the hopper at a dumpling factory. You should have been banned from the building. I know the videos are for entertainment, but damn if you don’t cost them money and make them look like an ass with you. Act like an adult (uncle) not a child (nephew).
I've never tasted truffle but I'll still like cuz I love your videos :)
Wait a min?!! With that little MSG in that big batch, does that mean Nephew Caleb uses the white amount and not the right amount? :O :O
I rather have MSG than truffles :D
What if you put msg on truffle🤔🤔
“This is vegans worst nightmare…flaaavor” 😂
MSG= Make Shit Good
i googled it OH HELL NAH
Caleb = asain Elon Musk
*has any people get the extra msg dumpling yet?*
would like to see something like this in the uk
The look he gave you when you threw that dumpling.
0:06 i'm from Seattle
Who googled meat spin?
What is meat spin?
Just hope someday he go to msg factory
Don’t see up meat spin
Uncle Rodger “Google Meatspin you’ll thank me later.” Now I’m blind and can’t watch your videos. Thanks.
😂😂😂😂
Sh!tz, shouldn’t have googled meat spin on my work computer 😢😢😢
Uncle secretly warning me not to Google meat spin(HAIYAA.... I STILL DID IT! Now i started to have nightmare)
sometimes he is funny, but this time he over do it .
Deadass he is just Asian Elon Musk.
I’m white but I like MSG highyyyyaaaaa
My favorite is also 小笼包
Please ship XCJ in Canada!
I thought uncle roger was like 29 but I found out in a video he’s 50 something
In our country haia means that he's Armenian
Update: Follow-up: just went to the Bellevue store and the food was great.  While you can't go wrong with the xiaolong boa, the shengjian bao is to die for.  Absolutely authentic and perfect.  Hey now, Din Tai Fung is really good though pricey and if you visit you'll see tons of Chinese there so no need to throw shade.  Uncle Roger, when in Seattle you can also try Dough Zone for xiaolong bao which is owned by a Tianjinese, so not bad either but not as nice as Din Tai Fung.  Thanks for the shout out to Xiao Chi Jie, nice to support a local business.
I love an obscure Ibiza reference
Uncle Roger driving the forklift caught me off guard
Tito Roger have you tried Siopao Asado. It Filipino dumplings.
Uncle Roger  i would like to do a cooking video  with you
‘No bats’ 😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
uncle roger throwing meat spin tout there is viscous lol.
Uncle did you put 25lbs of MSG in that mix?!
You have a link to their website
蝙蝠，哈哈哈哈哈，嘲諷技能滿點 XD
I wish i have that Xiao Long Bao
No wonder why my dumplings had so much flavor                                       dont attack me its a joke
MSG, a glutamic acid, is an excitotoxin. It overexcites brain cells to the point of damage or death. I know it's just a joke prop still this time a pouring sack of msg made me terrified.
Just imagine uncle roger and uncle from Jackie Chan adventures having a serious conversation 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm dead.
From the Scarlet Johansson joke to Amber Heard lawyer... You are the funniest man on YT
And I just had to Google meat spin….haiyaa.
LOVE TRUFFLES!!!!
I love you uncle roger
I’m a white guy who prefers not white food. I also adore truffle 😂😂😂😂
我好喜欢小笼包然后看到了这个影片我发现这是最好吃的小笼包我好想买啊！
I hate truffles
2:27 the side eye the employee gave him lmao 💀
They need to start selling these in Canada!
The magnet hack 😂😭
uncle roger legit dumped half a bag of mag into the meat
I don’t like truffle so I didn’t hit the like button
Wish we have this in the Philippines!
Where do I buy the special Uncle Roger dumpling flavor?
Too bad they don't ship worldwide 😔
Gosh, I love Caleb.
"no actually dont google that" me:  googled it
$0.80 a piece and 50 dumplings a bag? So It's $40 a bag?  Holy shit it actually is  That's insanely expensive. That's borderline a restaurant price.
I can't believe they let him waste 10 kg of MSG and 40 kg of dumpling filling for a gag
is it me or newphy caleb looks like yi long musk
Din Tai Fung be like after finding out Xiao Chi Jie:  Y O U  D A R E  O P P O S E  M E  M O R T A L
3:48 I already did that in the past, lol.
How does the government classify dumplings as a sandwich???
This is the craziest way I’ve never seem to add MSG in food. God bless people who bought those xiaolongbao🙀🙀🙀
我是来练习英语听力的。。。
nephew Caleb looks like Asian elon musk
*proceeds to Google meat spin anyway*
I am sorry uncle roger am alergic to msg 😢 please do not be mad, i still eat egg fry rice but with msg substitute
Thank you Uncle Roger for meat spin.
Uncle roger that’s a osha violation you did with that magnet XD
You can’t buy it in Europe :(
Wait so uncle roger is forklift certified too??
Din Tai Fung?? Is this available in Indonesi
More msg = more powar baby
I feel like he added more MSG than the amount of meat inside
and of course, uncle roger never forgets to take pot shots at jamie chilli jam olive oil during his videos :D
Heal :)
;<
😂🤣😅👍
Dam gonna look them up they look amazing 👍🏼🤠
You almost got hit dumping a whole sack of msg in there. He looks annoyed. You wasted msg. 😄
5:20 the sound when uncle roger and autie Helen was still together
truffle tastes so gross LOL
Achievement unlocked: disrespected my favorite restaraunt :(             why u gotta do din tai fung like that :(
I'm whiter than msg and I'll gladly take msg over truffles any day... they taste like dirt anyways and anybody who says otherwise is lying to your face.
As an Eastern European i just hate seeing uncle roger in so much pain watching this.
Is it good if i can smell it through the screen
i thought u said duckling as in duck eggs so my filipino senses turned on 😭
I thought he gonna recommended microwave if you don't have wood steamer. I'm half Chinese and I don't have it at home. it's cute but I only have an iron version and my mom usually just put it in rice cooker 😂
I searched meatspin
i have gas stove
I live in Seattle and never seen these 🥺
Its been all these years of uncle roger, but can you please stay and I’m not going anywhere
I am most keen to buy this, unable to find the proper brand: is it sold in Singapore or only thru online shopping. Anyone to advise.
omg that amount of msg being poured scare me alot. I mean those meat sure gonna throw tho
BRo he should have dumped like 5 bags more not enough MSG
soup dumpling is so good!
哈哈哈哈我也是，每次吃小笼包都要喷出来，所以要先咬一点点皮，吸汁，再吃
He looks like Elon musk
Low key Telsa flex
I Google searched meatspin meaning and I got definition of banana
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
jokes on you ive already seen meat spin... oh wait
He looks like Elon musk I swear
That CEO resembled  Elon Musk.
i googled meatspin... my eyes
Love ❤️ u , keep it up 👍
what is meat spin
I picked up a bag after seeing this video and have finally had occasion to try these dumplings. I consider myself a fan of Xiao Long Bao - I've had quite a few of them from various restaurants after being introduced to them by a co-worker. I was always frustrated I couldn't get them or make them at home. (My wife isn't a fan.)  These are tied for the best I've tasted. As they're frozen, I can make as many as I want, when I want.  If you have the money and the freezer space, buy some. They are absolutely worth the money. My wife also enjoyed playing with the dry ice they're shipped with. :)
I looked up meatspin and my mom LOVES looking at my google searches so thank you. You just got me grounded for a yea and a half AND you scarred me.
Sorry, Uncle Roger.  I'm a white girl and I hate truffles!  I don't like fungus in my food!
5:38 EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
0:49 Ding tai fung is much more cheaper in thailand. Its about 4-8 dollars per basket
awww i cant buy it from spain :((((
Ahhhhhhh. I miss china when watching……
The only dumplings I ever get to eat is momo.
Isn’t there msg in truffles
I searched meat spin 💀
I remember in the food truck weejo, uncle roger can’t drive 8:53
Go Chinatown to buy Bamboo Steamer...not colander
caleb is an npc lol
Uncle roger that was approximately $50 of msg you put in there
dude needs to do more meth
im vegan and your the funniest nonvegan xD love how you laugh at everyone and anyone <3 Stay free stay wild
Thanks for the video but seriously fuck FDA for interfering in Dumpling-ing (that 4 dumplings per serving bullshit)!
Ding Tai Fung is my favorite place ❤
I hope you watched Esther on Iron Chef!!! Maybe make a video on it
Nephew Caleb is like the elon musk of dumplings
All that MSG. uncle Roger is crazy
Why you snort the white powder… come on man
“White people love truffle” well, the ones who’ve had it, yes. Other people have had it to.
I was not expecting the little exchange at the end before the outtakes. Good callback!
皮太厚了
3:37 damn it uncle roger you do to make sure this entire world suffered
OMG, 4:38 what did he just do?
“ Uncle Rogers favorite Asian actress is Scarlett Johansson” 😂😂😂
> This machine works harder than Amber Heard lawyer > This is Vegan worst nightmare, flavor > Truffle is white ppl MSG, you put in there they will eat anything  *uncle roger casually murders everyone*
Wow! FDA classifies dumplings as sandwiches. So sad.
you can take her home to ;)
somebody dumpling not getting fondled tonight. 💀
Classic joke/roast: "This is vegans' worst nightmare, *FLAVOR* "🔥🔥🔥🔥 - Uncle Roger, 2022
Nephew Caleb said they where ¢80 a bag but if you pause on the part where they pull up the website it says 3995
Uncle Rodger can we see some liangpi? my Chinese roommate introduced it to me but I'm white and I don"t know how to make it at home. I'm not afraid I will go to the Chinese market no problem.
8:16 Uncle Roger confused why _xiaolongbao_ is a sandwich, despite in the "Japanese Week" video he claimed that a _bao_ is the Asian version of sandwich. Especially since a xiaolongbao is classified as a bao and not a dumpling.
The msg meme is gettin out of hand😂😂
Damn i googled meatspin
the CEO looks like Elon Musk

Is it just me or nephew Caleb looks like Elon Musk
Nice Tesla, hahha
Asian Elon musk
I got it from someone else
Bonus quote:Smell it through the phone ❤️❤️💀❤️💀❤️💀❤️❤️💀❤️
"Uncle Roger favortie Asain actress is  Scarlett Johansson." Bruh I may cry until next year.
you are ruining the msg jokes with that kind of msg joke
He actually dumped the msg from 25 pound bag in the pork. Hilarious
Thank you achievement hunter for already teaching me what meat spin is 😂😂😂😂
Googed meatspin😔
nice advertisement...I'm going to buy the dumplings...
I think Uncle Roger looks like Song Seung-heon in round face.
Sometimes I feel like his joke went to far 😆 🤣
Truffle tastes like dirt. They trick us by saying it is “EARTHY”. Bleeeeeck.
Uncle roger: “this machine working harder than amber heard’s lawyer” Me: crying and laughing at the same time
can i find these at Walmart though
Eat bat to get holiday 2 years 🤣
Uncle Roger video so satisfying
1:20 where's "sorry Children"😂😂😂
hmmm
2:28 **concerned employee noises intensify**
neohew’s this is a warning!!!     do not search meat spin i promise you I got traumatised!!!!
I live in 台北 in 台灣 and I love 小籠包
i cant be mad at this guy
4:36 thats gonna be alot of FLAVORD😋
Which 10 ten video do I have to kick out to put this one in....
talk about entertainment ❤️
The sheer amount of msg he put in there 😂😂
u know tht u search wut "meatspin" is , right?.....i know u guys did...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fondling and meat spin, so we know how Roger spending his lonely days
dude stop WASTING food with your MSG. The argument is that you can't even put that batch with a huge load of unseasoned minced meat. The texture has been already fcked by dehydration. We know youtube gives you too much money to spend spend but at least think about those who are suffering from starvation.
the guy looks like chines Elon Musk
FDA welcome to American federal agencies, they're all that dumb 🤣
难道只有我一个人觉得罗杰叔叔长得像张国荣吗？
Took your referral and tried out XCJ. 1 bag of 4 bags actually had dumplings i could separate and put into the basket.  The shipping and packaging that comes from XCJ seems really nice but somewhere along the lines the dumplings are merging together because they got too warm. Although to be fair, it arrived very cold for me. But i have to destroy 5 dumplings to every 10 i cook. A bit disappointing for 100 bucks purchase.
ooh i like xiao long bao too
Trying to find the website to the dumplings can't find it can you please share it
That 'we put the whole world on holiday for two more year' hit so hard! Hahahhaa..🤣🤣🤣 oh please no more viral diseases.😒 Thanks👍
I am offended for the part that he threw the dumpling and put the whole bag of msg into the meat. I know he was trying to be funny, but there is more ways rather than wasting food. And I can tell that factory man was not happy with that by his face expression.
That’s definitely enough to give someone a heart attack
"That's how you get the fingers in." LOL
As a white people, truffle is fucking disgusting. More MSG *NOW*
Uncle Roger, union agitator ❤️
Hi uncle roger im a fan from the Philippines please do a reaction video for EXECUTIVE CHEF Boy Logro. He is famous here in the Philippines and even once served as Princess Diana's residents chef. I wish you grant my request...
M: Magnificent S: Super G: Good

ScarJo is never gonna live that movie down lol

I think uncle roger would be proud of my pantry
2:27 no mentioning of Nigella ?? I'm surprised!
Just found this channel and it quickly because my favorite... Thanks 4 D content uncle

FIFTEEN BUCKS FOR 3 DUMPLINGS???????? SCAM!!!
Did uncle roger really put the bag of msg into the meat? How are they gonna sell it?
How come did not come with vinegar and ginger?🤣🤣🤣
I wanna know where did those dumplings with extra MSG go.
Hell yeah, Uncle Roger bringing back Meat Spin in 2022 for the new generation!
Uncle Roger, u are correct us whites hear Truffle and we go nuts! But those are my fav dumplings, I love the pork kind most but all are always great! Dont forget about the sauces they have to! The Ginger and the Chili kinds are awesome, to die for .... be even better with Truffle of course!
Uncle Roger Uncle Rogerrrrrrrrrr, your niece Mi Mi want to see your YouTube video with  Marion cooking. All of your niece and nephew wants to see too :D :D
Uncle roger i have a question not to be mean to nephew caleb but why does he look like elon musk
From the area! Their dumplings are sooooo goood!!!!😍
Great job 👍👍 my dear friend 💖💖 very much
30 usd for a basket steamer? Like bruh i bought one at my asian market for 5 10 bucks and it has 5 trays too.
Jamie olive oil 🔥
Idk why but this made me uncomfortable uncle roger….
HAHA
Where's my credit card
Emotional damage
White people problem
And then and then and then

When your Asian Dad tells your teacher you can spank my kid and then hands your teacher a belt hiya
This, Is Elon musk
我喜欢我的妈妈小猫
by the cube rule dumpling is a calzone get it right FDA
What is up with the cartoon accent?? Have you no shame? Be a man for Christ’s sake. Have some pride.
I approve
50 piece for 40 USD? 30 for a bamboo steamer? Jesus, there are Chinese brands that sell like 30 pieces for 8 USD and probably tastes better because it’s actually from Shanghai lmao, restaurants serve 9 pieces freshly made for about a dollar each, bruh
nephew caleb looks like asian elon musk
Uncle Rodger: Don’t google meat spin Me: *sigh* here I go
Lol “ do you hear that ask him for more money he don’t know shit” 😂
The guy at the meat station is treating uncle Roger like a toddler 🤣🤣 "yeah see, it spins"
2:45
LMAO. If they are better than Ding Tai Feng, why they are not selling all over the world? Jokers.
he looks like an asian Elon musk
I would have packaged that and collabed with Nigel and made a limited edition uncle roger style dumpling
Lol I am not white and I dont have a dumpling steamer basket thing
"Ask him to give you more money, he useless." Most based thing Uncle Roger has ever said.
To bad i cant find good frozen dumplings in eu fuiyoooo
These dumplings sucks.
I hope uncle Roger's neighborhood is gentrified by huns.
Worst North Korean propoganda porn C-SPAM ever.
I wasn't gonna search "Meatspin" but then he said "NO, ACTUALLY DON'T GOOGLE THAT ", which developed a deep sense of "DO ITಠ_ʖಠ" and then I did  Haiiyaaa my poor innocence (〒﹏〒)
Me: I hate this video Uncle roger: haiyaa Me:okee  i likee
Uncle Roger yes to next record of the biggest chicken nugget
I wish there's another factory in Asia too.

Uncle Roger special: showering in msg so the ladies will get better flavor with him
Lucu banggg
Please review fried rice of cookingbomb
I love pumpkin lamb dumpling
Uncle Roger, how about reviewing one of my fav channel's fried rice? https://youtu.be/CPPj7kDn8kw
The amount of food that got wasted because of the msg you put in makes me sad, really disappointed, not expected from uncle roger.
A little frendly reminder i.e if u buy a new bamboo steamer, before used. Please make sure to let the steamer steam itself for at least couple hours in order to let those "weird" favour ran out. Remember this is a must
We always keep some of these dumplings ready for a lazy cooking night. so easy to make and so tasty.  Though one time we got a bag with two extra dumplings in it. It was a wonderful bag. Must have been put together by a new employee. lol
"This machine is working harder than Amber Heard's lawyer!" 🤣😂

Uncle Roger maybe you can review dimsimlim cooking channel, he is a good cook.
Hello Uncle Roger I have good news (you have 5.96m subscribers but Jamie Oliver got 5.68m subscribers Uncle roger defeated Jamie Oliver)
you can tell the CEO is not vibing with Uncle Rodger with him hating on dwight folks.
Unsubscibing cause I took the joke you said personally in a comedy show in London
This comedian should perform at circuses, together with lions and tigers.
The joke about Ghost in the Shell was amazing!  100% accurate.  My statement to that would be, "You hire Scarlett Johansson, you know you fucked up."  🤣🤣
You should watch this https://youtu.be/MNOhHXG4MmA
One of my favorite videos of all time, thanks dude, that guy was so uptight lololollololololol
Aunt Ester so fuiyoh!!!!!!
The price per bag is not bad but the price of shipping kills it for me.
OOOOOOOH "someone put another bat here, we ptu the world in holiday for 2 more years" that was savage hahaha   WHAAAAT lol half the bag of MSG in, the guy can do whatever
I genuinely cannot read Caleb... Is he annoyed? Is he an uncle Roger fan? Was he pissed off about the msg? Did he enjoy any of this?
Uncle who?
Nephew caleb facial expressions and speaking style just like elon musk
"This machine working harder than Amber Heard Lawyer"😂🤣🤣😂

Hey where is your video uncle roger?
So much white powder, is Nigella Lawson having party? 😂 9:28
he looks like asian elon musk 😭
That shoutout to meatspin omg xD
3:45  Context: Meatspin is a "Screamer" that is about gay people having ay nal seggs and the guy on the top has his private part spinning on 360 degrees It plays the "You Spin Me Round" song very loudly   Alternative: Kekma ga has the funny loud guy screaming as the background music  WARNING: There is some Meatspin version that can give you malware when you go to the site. Sometimes you cannot exit it by pressing alt f4 or the x button. You will have to use Task Manager [Ctrl Shift Esc] -sometimes it forces the Task Manager to not open-
You know what Uncle Roger should make at 6 million milestone. Tom yum

I wish to enjoy and hear your jokes for la long long time......confussius old i hope you reach in good health....wise man say:"totally nothing, he is thinking. idiots talk al the time while saying no-thing. wise man writes it on scroll or in a book so other can think about it....mmm is that smart? it must be al these people talking about him, constantly......he thinks he is so wise, but never said anything, he never solved te problem at hand........ok when you read the wisemans book, that problem will never return again, ever! so yes he wise smart man)

Uncle Roger how about you try and review any of gordon’s Kitchen Nightmare episode ! see him shout at the chefs there is so satisfying 👍
So nice to see
"We have been married for 8 years so of course not" got us in the first half of the sentence 💀💀
29,95 for a steamer?!! I can buy one at my local toko for 2 euro's
Dont rost them so much
Chinese Elon musk
My father last job was at ding tai fung 😂😂😅😅😅😂
Uncle Roger challenges us to get 200k likes on crazy Office cooking . Now he already got 400k +likes  so he has to do that.(((https://youtu.be/0e9WuB0Ua98))

0:03        😦I live near Seattle
nephew Caleb is awesome
真的好吃嘛，有中国人回我一下嘛，看着和国内的不一样。感觉像是骗老外的
Jamie Oliver still getting all the attention and love I see
I googled meat spin
Was thinking Uncle Roger spared Jamie Oliver for this one video. Didn't saw it coming
Is it just me, or does Nephew Caleb look like an Asian Elon Musk?
Ight, I’ll eat 10 bats
Love Uncle Roger but these soup dumplings were not that great :/ I ordered two packs but there's barely any "soup" in the dumplings although I made sure to follow the instructions carefully. They tasted no different than regular frozen dumplings, far cry from soup dumplings you would get from a good chinese restaurant. I did like the sauces that they sell on the website though.
Vegans’ worst nightmare  Flavours
I love that the FDA classifies the dumplings as a sandwich 🤣
Children version of Georgian Khinkali
confused white gril will order steamer online... I'm confused...
I don't know why, but Nephew Caleb looks like Elon Musk XD
"Just take our culture" FUIIIYOOO
80 CENTS ON WEBSITE ITS $140
just found a zojirushi rice cooker for $15 at a thrift store! they retail for $200 Canadian.... before finding this channel, I never would've geeked out over a rice cooker 😂 it's brand new btw!
I can’t wait for cold rice. So my rice isn’t fried rice? I eat that for breakfast. So I use the rice cooker to pan fry fried rice.
Uncle roger, please review the perfect omellete by made with lau channel.  I hope you like the video, they also talk about chinese in america and how the history went deep. the uncle cooking also speak cantonese.
NAH the fact that the XLP is cheaper in the US compared to Malaysia. Gotta get it here!
UNCLE roger too much msg 😂
Wow. Uncle Roger has more Subscribers then Jamie Oliver. We did it. Tell everyone. It is only a little bit till 6 Million subscribers. Maybe we can make Uncle Roger make a Thai Red Curry, once he reaches 6 Million subscribers. FUIYOH.
1:01 What do we make sure again?
uncle nick!!!
Uncle Roger just unlocking the new title : King of MSG =)))
Fellow white people, as a white person I am pleading to you. If buying a dumpling steamer is cultural apropriation then what is buying the dumplings frozen in the supermarket and throwing them in a microwave (never seen this but I am 100% certain this is a thing somewhere lol society is utterly fucked) :') That'd be cultural assassination, just buy the damn steaming basket :p
People who hire Uncle Roger to make products promotion need to have a great patience 😂 He's literally roasting while promoting 😂😂
Nephew Nigel, If nigel in austrailian means lonely and no friends, is uncle roger actually your friend???
Uncle Roger - getting more and more HamSup!  haha!
The OSHA guy at my place also asks the same question. Anyone lose finger here?
Some day I'll be able to get this from overseas, hopefully.
Meat spin is the most classic jebait
The best part of soup dumplings is giving your mouth 3rd degree burns every time you try to eat one
Wow what great looking sandwiches 💀💀💀
Uncle Rodger came to Seattle, pog
05:40 shots fired #JohnnyDepp

is it me or does uncle roger look like joshseki sometimes in this video..
Mum my favourite food
Your white 2
meat spin= a random music artist who dedicated his entire life to spin around-
I think Uncle Roger has been hanging out with the rich guys in Nigel's Tesla Cars fan club.  It is bacon not truffles we love with everything :)
it must be hard to be the straight man to Uncle Roger
Uncle Roger is gonna lose all his hair v soon!! Just thinking what a waste of meat w all the excess MSG got poured in there..shivers
Sooooo many OSHA violations...
put nigel inside the machine..chop him up...call it uncle roger dumpling..
5/10 funny less funny than before the quality are going down
Not me actually looking up what meatspin is.  Uncle roger giving a lot of sex ed!!!  Thank you!!!
guys i didnt know what meatspin was...........
Wow he's like me.... but better
4:42 the face of a worry man....
"Truffle is white people MSG" LMFAO it's fkn hilarious because it's true. White folks y'all sure do love some truffles🤣
oh i remember ester from a cooking show about egg fried rice
I googled meatspin.. please dont
Uncle roger just cost me $100 and I’m not even mad.
amber heard's lawyer works very hard, with her words her jaw must be so strong having said "objection hearsay" like 100000 times she never stops working     my dog stepped on a bee
I think when Uncle Roger hits 6 million subscribers her should make his own sushi
Uncle Roger is funny af. “My favorite Asian actress is scarlet Johansson” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Uncle Roger though why put so much msg
Uncle roger never fails to deliver a good laugh
“Put the whole world on holiday for 2 more years”😂
A little too boring, the CEO can't take jokes
小笼包其实也有分，起码是不是汤包的区别。我为什么这么说，凭我是简体中文，而且语法没问题。
TIL American FDA think a Soup Dumpling is a "Sandwich" LMAO . That's might be the same reason why some western countries use to have "Pizza is a vegetable." controversy before.
These are literally heaven 🙌🙌🙌 have three bags in my freezer rn along with all the sauces 🤣 I tell everyone I know about them .
Looks good
Uncle Roger....when visiting companies please stop it with MSG... respect people formula. when you do these stuff like adding MSG and wasting food, it isn't nice....i think if you continue like this, no one would want you to visit they company. When visiting companies go as Nigel....
Those are not msg apparently.. doesn’t look like msg.
nephew caleb somehow looks like an elon musk
So the guys who don't know what  dumplings are, and think 4 sandwiches = 1 serving ... are also the same clowns making all the calls in the ko-vid shit show. That's food for thought 🤔
I know it's just for show but that is a waste off good food putting that much MSG... even thou they are giving it to charity and non of it will go to waste I feel sorry for those who eat those salty dumplings.
This is cool
Vegans worst nightmare "Flavour"...lol
“Oops, somebody dumpling not getting fondled tonight”  Is it just me or doesnt he sound like po’s father from kung fu panda?
I love that baby saying emotional damage 😂😂😂😂

You dont... need a specific asian-style bamboo steamer... A steamer is a steamer.
uncle roger, come to nepal, dumplings here are basically free*. 1 dumpling = 8cents i'll personally treat you to some
Fuiyooo finally heard Uncle Roger saying chinese word
Haha 鼎泰豐 is da best lah!
hello at 7m subcribers can you make butter chicken
I ate truffle on toast with MSG while watching this. would recommend. also white as milk, damn you uncle.
Uncle Roger brought magnet to cheat system but did  not bring chopsticks. What is wrong with Uncle Roger???
He ain't wrong about white people msg being truffles
I searched meatspin and....
EEEEE-moootionaaal DAMage

Uncle, my mom favorite word is Haiyaaa
Hi uncle roger how ur day come to Australia and try Kangaroo Burgers and Meat Pies
Hi Uncle Roger! Just a recommendation, could you review Tasty's giant ramen? I'm curious whether it's Uncle Roger Approved or not!
I think you should review the $116 vs $11 Ramen: Pro Chef & Home Cook Swap Ingredients epicurious next... Auntie Esther is in it!
40 dollars for only 50 pieces? so expensive haiyaa
Uncle rogger I love your positive attitude can U come to Adelaide and see the Barossa valley meats and do the same as we love our meat in Aus and we all need uncle rogger to show us how it's done maybe I can get a signature jumper aswell 🙏🙏🙏
Do they sell these in stores? Or only through the website
nigel ng
So ordering some
did Uncle Roger just applied for Forklift Certification??? fuiyoooh
8:12  When my girl starts being indecisive with where she wanna eat after deciding on a place earlier.
😂😂
Din Tai Fung has been real quiet
Ok meat spin don’t even
Lol
Uncle roger can you react to hainanese chicken rice next
Not even joking…. There was an ad for microwave instant rice right before this video 😬
MSG pridee
These dumplings are 🔥🔥🔥 I always have a pack in the freezer. BEST I’ve had since living in Hong Kong
Every time uncle roger roast some one put emotional damage
My mom bought 120 dumplings after watching this.
Asian elon musk?
Lived in Shanghai for about 18 months and Xiao Long Bao was my favorite.  XCJ dumplings are the best dumplings I've found to make at home... so awesome.
Uncle Roger. This is your niece from South Africa, I need your help.  Gordon Ramsay is doing a new show called Hotel Hell and on all the episodes he strips down to his underwear.  Uncle Roger, please make a video telling us what you think about this
I am so sad I can’t make it to your show in Sydney I got COVID-19 😢
Good dumplings begins with sad lol
LMFAO!! Meatspin is such a throwback. used to always prank friends with that site.
Please review the self cooking egg fried rice machine it’s from Dancingbacons
This machine works harder than Amber Heard's lawyer LOL 🤣🤣🤣 FYI: Johnny Depp just won... Yayy....
Truffle and msg
Sorry I had to stop watching when you put the whole bag of MSG in omggg so obscene without warning 😂😂😂
Lololol.bats
I just bought the uncle roger batch of flabor
I don't see the truffle or MSG flavors on the site, where can I order? 😆
as a white person, i can state emphatically, not ALL of us like Truffel <_<
Nephew Caleb strongly resembles Elon Musk
Uncle Roger can you plzz review the chef Alvin Zoe plzzz
the shipping for the dumplings cost $20… that’s crazy. If uncle roger wasn’t famous, who cares what he recommends?
i like my dumplings with extra fingers. It's the crunchy texture that does the magic . . .
no msg
BATS?!
Uncle Roger forgot to Colorgrade his LogGrade Footage Haiyaaa
All that meat wasted by dumping the MSG into it.  That's just not right; it's criminal to waste so much food on purpose.
Dang That MSG Dang that's big
I regret searching meatspin
Do not I repeat do not look up meat spin 😭🥲
I wish someone would look at me like Uncle Roger did when they were mixing the dough 😖
Nephew Caleb reminds me of Elon Musk for some reason 🧐
Uncle roger: throw a sack of MSG Nephew Caleb: _emotional damage_ 😵‍💫
Not only can you take the soup dumpling home, you can even stick your peen inside them.
Review on Guga Biryani recipe Pls🥰🥰
I followed uncle roger on tiktok
So did you try your special MSG dumplings?
Hey uncle roger Joshua made a vid where he made Dumplings
Are you actually divorced
"This is vegan's worst nightmare-" *holds up a chunk of meat* "-flavor" 🤣
A dumpling IS NOT a Sandwich.
No no no not soup dumplings 小笼包 or bao zhi Haiyaaaaa dumpling is 饺子 jiao zhi
The owner so tense. And yeh kids, dont google meatspin. Shet doesnt get away until you ded
鼎泰豐的小籠包是我吃過世界讚的小籠包
5:09 Comrade Uncle Roger is based.
React to quang tran
Nepalese momo is what we seek for
I searched for it 🙂🙃
eat from top suck the soup then eat
As a white guy with a Chinese stomach, I approve of all dumplings.
I snorted flour and now I sneeze salty dough
After adding more MSG to the dumplings it become the best dumpling in the world
i wanna see you review marion's kitchen
8:18  ZUTOMAYO????? Study mee?????
The machine working harder then Amber Heard's Lawyer 🤣
4:25 How did I know he was gonna wang that whole bag into the mixture? Lol.
When he said "it takes a lot of hard work to keep it consistent" low key shade
Please stop with the coke jokes!  Please!
MSG RULES!!!!!!!!!! The msg dumplings must be good
The Amber comment caught me off guard tho😂
"this machine works harder than Amber Heard Lawyer" holy fuck
Im still so happy to see uncle roger using emotional damage
Dumplings is my favorite 😋
this shit is borderline racist lol love it
i learned something new and i laughed, nice.
This is going to bump up the sales
Hey uncle please make a Biriyani video..
0:59 UNCLE ROGER! WE ASIAN DONT WASTE FOOD!!! DONT ACT LIKE WHITE.
Uncle Roger try out some korean fried chicken next time it's really good
8:51, is anyone gonna mention that Uncle Roger is forklift certified
Forget is a hot dog a sandwich... Now it is a dumpling a sandwich?
chilie jam filling!
I mean, you can take Auntie Esther home with you, but there might be kidnapping charges involved
Please make some halal dumplings Lam, beef or chicken. I would love to try them.  Thank you.
What you think? What you think?
If you dump that much msg ur gonna get diabetes for sure if you eat that.           and yes, MSG does cause diabetes.
Thanks to Uncle Roger I got the best Fathers Day and Birthdsy present a rice cooker a wok and MSG!!!
You beat Jamie Olive Oil in subs! CONGRATS!
I'm so surprised Uncle Roger didn't say anything about the colander or how the colanders are held together with some wire. Awesome factory though! Uncle Wang has good humour and tolerance to let uncle roger mess up the whole dumpling batch!
You got mentioned in Tasting History: https://youtu.be/CsjL0wBINnI  If there was ever a crossover I would want to see, it would be Uncle Roger and Max Miller looking at the history and origins  of Fried Rice.
LMAO! Oh my gosh, he just let you dump in all that MSG! The look on his face though, LOVE IT!
Uncle Roger should open his own dumpling factory. More MSG = More Flavor.
这个家伙好讨厌，把无聊当有趣像个二流子，网络里面很少看到这样的轻浮，唯一的另一次也是一个亚裔。
"machine works harder than amber heard's lawyer" 💀
@the_xcj wen dessert flavor!!
I wish they had lamb dumplings!!
This brand of xlb has been on my "to buy" list for months XD gotta love budgeting... love the video lol
btw the truffle suggestion is actually a really good one.
Uncle Roger, what about Europe man? What would a similar product be that would ship to EU countries?
Crazy that adding the extra MSG threw off the machine for that batch.
1:10 Hayiah you wasted foooood. Don't throw food at floor!
Absolutely enjoyed this one, we always love the out takes you show at the end. Maybe create a greatest outtakes video sometime, that would be so funny to watch. I am so glad they donate products to the homeless and others in need instead of simply tossing it away. I am not sure if I can find them in East Tennessee but if we can we will absolutely buy some to support  them.   Keep on enjoying the MSG.
I want to see Uncle Roger in a MSG factory
Thank you Uncle Roger - you gave me Dumpling Feeling
Uncle Roger has a history with dumplings 😅
Uncle Roger and the Dumpling Factory - By Roald Dahl
BAHHAHA calebs having none of uncle rogers shit
these dumplings look delicious
Might get dislikes, but… Why aren’t they wearing food safety mouth shields while talking over the foods that they’re processing? 🫢
Slight correction, truffles are for RICH BOURGEOUS people.
I love when everyone is a good sport and joins in the humor.
10min commercial, damn, youtube getting crazy with it.
Uncle guess what Jamie Oliver oils restaurant shut down
Dumplings are happiness
apology video inc
I love how the guy rips joke after joke totally deadpan, also he talks like Elon Musk and even kinda looks like him.
4:44 Some random guy is gonna be crying from flavor
The Asian Ron Swanson 😆 🤣 😂
When you was wearing the same uniform I could not tell who was who 😂
Is the real question is it halal
ngl those dumlings are a scam and so is everything else they sell. 30 bucks for a steamer? thats a 10x markup
I can only imagine you get paid for these promo videos! So happy you’re getting all this monetary momentum with your work!
WGERE
hi
สวัดดีครับ
Petition to make Uncle Roger narrate those 'How its made' shows on TV

Jamie Oliver vs Gordon Ramsay vs uncle roger cook off

Uncle Roger out maneuvered me... i actually searched meat spin...... THANKS UNCLE
MACHINES WORKIN HARDER THAN AMBER HEARD LAWYER OMG AHAHAHHAHA

Ah awesome video! Would love to have it here in Europe 😂
I think the machine's only calibrated for white amount of MSG.
Bro  Why does he look like Asian Elon musk
"Truffle (Black Truffle) is like white people MSG" - Uncle Roger 2022  PS: XLB with mangetout? lol

Haiya women ☕
Machine working harder than Amber Heard Lawyer 🤣🤣
My parents and people here think MSG makes your bone weaker. Is it true, uncle roger??
If only there was a way to make ravioli, but to also make them taste like solidified fart-pellets wrapped in toilet paper, and then cook them to make them seem as if they've been run through a dry-clean laundry service, yesterday morning... Oh wait, there is a way? And I can dip them in fermented ass-sauce? Hooray! Thanks Asia! You guys are sooo ahead of us! ❤️
Every White person who like to cook already have "bamboo steamer"; it growing mildew in back of cupboard already, haiyahh... How you think we ruin expensive frozen dimsum from Costco? Hmmm? With cheap microwave? Us White people, we already have everything already, and we already know how to use improperly... We can ruin everyone else's food as we please, because we're assholes, and we don't care. We never have, we don't now, and we never will. Thanks for the recipes, suckers! 😜
Nephew Caleb talk like asian Elon Musk
Oh gods, meatspin has scarred my innocent eyes.
Looks so good. Too bad they don't ship to Sweden.
Nephew Caleb kinda looks like yi long ma
cool this is in Washington State!
are slav people considered white people ?
hi
Best ad ever!!!

In asia if you throw food parents will smack you with the broom stick
The fact that the owner actually agreed to destroy one whole batch for Uncle Roger

I've got a whole container of MSG  🤪
This video just made my night

Uncle Roger casually telling all the employees to organize against the boss 🤣
So happy to find out I can buy dumplings to steam at home.
Can we please get a vegetarian dumplings. Not vegan but vegetarian. Uncle I hate too much flavor so I am vegetarian 😋. But I love too much entertainment so I love uncle Rogger 🤗.
Exceptional video as always. But I hope they clean the machine. Being that I am allergic to both pork and shellfish. But I’de eat the shit out of those chicken dumplings. PS. Love the Steven introduction!

wow the amount of msg is comically much
Hong’s are frozen and they are lush. Nothing wrong with frozen!
And he complained about "how to basic"  >:V
Scarlet Johansson joke had me in tears 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
I googled meatspin, sorry children
Nephew Caleb is brave inviting Uncle Roger into his business! But leaving a giant bag of MSG within reach MAY have been SLIGHTLY unwise! Lol (hopefully they split the meat mix up and cut it with more meat to bring the msg levels correct so it wasn't wasted...)
2 more years of holiday aint that bad 🤣🤣🤣
Machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer. HAH
Is it me dor does Nephew Caleb look like Elon Musk
"This machine is working harder than amber heard lawyer" IM DYING BRO AAAAAA
I wouldn't trust a comapny who's employees drive Altimas (REALLY bad transmissions that require pretty much a new one even after the Nissan recalls) they're why nissan is failing.
Delicious episode😍

MSG = Happiness and flavor
uwu daddy roger
I have already ordered these about 2 months ago…the whole starter set and finished my 100 dumplings about 2 weeks ago along with at least one of the sauce jars (umami…so good!). And no worries Uncle Roger, I’m not scared to buy a bamboo steamer, I already have one so when I got the dumpling package I got a SECOND one. I could make 30-40 dumplings at a time if I wanted! 🙃❤️🥟🥢
This guy reminds me of Elon Musk. Maybe its the shirt
I feel nausea watchg unc.rogrr put msG into machine.

Uncle Roger come to Taiwan to try the authentic Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings!
Uncle roger I think I found your son his YouTube channel is called Chris wang
ok i know it was for show... but you wasted food :(
$29.00 for a bamboo steamer, really? Major rip-off!
Uncle Roger fondling dumplings...such gentle hands😂😂😂
I like truffle :(
Uncle Roger should review chef pk He also recreates food from anime and video games
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Haayaah! Dumplings no good! No Oliver oil was used. And where is Chili Jam? ;)
What is better if you can take auntie asther home with you Still Xiao chi Jie?
The fact that he roasted Amber's lawyer
I think next episode Uncle Roger will be working at Ding Tai Fung.
Wonder how that msg-bombs tasted like 😅
Meatspin is a musical artist.😁
Those look like some pretty tasty sandwiches
So does Uncle Rodger get to keep the over seasoned dumplings?
thanks for the meatspin
Jesus Christ loves you
Why does the guy Look like Chinese elon musk 😂
1:02 p3nis boiling in hot water?
Went a bit too far adding all that MSG to the meat. That's money he spent on meat, seasoning and electric
these dumplings look delicious
Nephew Caleb did not seem pleased to see the extra MSG being added. Great video, though!
I’d live on dumplings if it was socially acceptable…
Meat spin is hard to find now ... I only found an article describing it ... So disappointed.
Absolutely lost it with that Amber Heard lawyer comment! I'm dying! 🤣🤣🤣
Uncle Roger the butter chicken is still due, review the proper butter chicken to make Indian niece and nephew happy 😊 btw loved the video 🔥❣️
Lmao when uncle Roger went full on clubbing mode and still interrogated about secret fingers recipe
this machine working harder than amber heard lawyer  😂
Uncle Roger i cant watch your videos around other people, because i laugh so mutch, people start calling ambulaces for me, they think i am having mental breakdowns. :D never change
"This machine working harder than Amber Heard Lawyer" - Uncle Roger 2022
Elon, is that musk ?
$20 delivery fee for a bag of dumplings, haiyaaaa...
So I'm guessing this entire batch was paid by uncle Roger.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn8vL4cLI1sJut7pysUpN5w?sub_confirmation=1
guys, dont look up meatspin, its a (not ready yet) spinning around.
I’ve never seen this channel before so I was so caught off guard when he said pussy and started fondling the dumplings 😂🤣😂 so glad I discovered this now!
Looks like siomay...
Can confirm, am a white guy and feel super awkward and out of place in an Asian grocery store. I can feel people staring at me lmao. But it's worth it to buy the delicious bahn mi's they make there.
Caleb is so funny
how can caleb doesnt laugh so much? 😂😂
I just remembered that the sound playing in the background in one of the most famous music we all have heard in our life.
Ohhhhh yes! I live in Tacoma and get ads for them. They are SO good!
I mean, was it necessary to make MSG joke and then waste all that meat. Im no vegan but that is waste of Meat...

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure. 2. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better.  3. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 4. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else. 5. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW! 6. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 7. If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends? 8. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges. 9. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut." 10. Humpty Dumpty was pushed.  Editorial: Is the world's most thought-provoking one-liner "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway."? It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Lol the roast this machine working harder than amber heard lawyer lol
im guessing the msg dumplings are uncle rogers dumplings now
Where’s the soup??
The real reason auntie Helen left uncle roger. He destroys everything and alienates everyone due to his extreme obsession with MSG.
The most unenthusiastic “Nice” in the world with that msg dump
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Din Tai Fung is from Taiwan, something Uncle Roger knows nothing about...
US only, sad 😢
Uncle ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGER!
I made the same face as Uncle Roger. The FDA says dumplings are what??
Dude the amber heard jokes got me 💀
Uncle Roger, is MSG the flavor or is meat the flavor?
If you put truffles in my dumplings, I will. Hurt.You.
Damn, he ruined a lot of good pork with that MSG for an ad.
I hit like for my wife , a total addict
I want all of these
I like your videos Uncle Roger but this really needs to be marked as a paid promotion/advertisement.  It’s pretty obvious, and I think for transparency you should be clearly marking it as you’re supposed to.
I definitely order the truffle dumplings at din tai fung, and I’m definitely white.
To all of u who want to live a happy life pls don't visit the website uncle Roger told 😂
What's wrong with your head @ 1:46
I googled meat spin.....they just show me a meat spinning
Is it just me or is uncle Roger one of the few who can't get cancelled 🔥🔥🔥
Damn nephew Caleb is so chill when the whole bag of white powder was poured It’s not every day that you see this
Caleb was hilarious. I hope to try those dumplings sometime soon.
"we've been married for 8 years" then proceeds to cut off his wife. I guess your dumpling won't get fondled tonight
Im buying one of these bags now
this is the first video without uncle roger saying "sorry children"
This guy is legit funny.
Yo pls dont google the word he said lol
"This maching works harder than Amber Heard lawyer" I DIED🤣🤣🤣🤣
My favorite Asian actress is Tom cruise
Uncle Roger, what did you get your spin counter to?
It's a hard day for the owner... I can see from his face 😂
Lol the staff laughing behind
Scarlett Johansson ASIAN!? I have ben lied to my Hole life!
4:44 nice
I looked it up....uncle Roger I didn't know you were into that lol
why you put so much msg into the meat, that taste like sad and it hurts your body haiyaa
Who googled meatspin here..?
https://youtu.be/e9t1F5qWdc8
Serving size 4 pieces. That means with 50 per bag, you invite 13 people to your dinner party and a fight will break out.
Uncle Roger acts like he disgusted by FDA classifying dumplings sandwiches.  50 videos ago this mofo literally said Asian Baos and dumplings are better sandwiches because shit dont fall off.
That line about the machine working harder then Amber Heard's lawyer got me good! 😂👌
4:34 I dont even know the guy felt I know msg king of flavor But its just waste of meat
Don’t constantly down WHITES you don’t want us to do it to your race don’t do it to anyone else
so sad, he eat xiao long bao wrongly
I am scarred from searching meat spin...
Hey Uncle Roger Hello from Pakistan. Im a huge fan. M.S.G is banned in my country. Please send a message to pakistani government. They have taken the flavour out of our lives 😭😭

Damn!!! Thats a lot of MSG!!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Nephew Caleb cursing Uncle Roger with his eyes when he saw that whole thicc bag of MSG 😂
Uncle Rodger, theres a video where a woman cooks rice and uses the forbidden colander on tiktok

So sad they don't ship to Switzerland 🇨🇭we want yummi dumplings too!
But can we get this in Europe? UK, Switzerland, Germany .....................
these dumplings look delicious 🤤
Today i learned what meat spin is 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
3:44 Hayia this family friendly channel you say uncle roger
If only could ship to Australia
Damn why Ankle Roger always so good in roasting people😂
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!! Gets me everytime hahahahahaha
Isnt white powder simply MSG?
7:07 am i the only white dude who despises truffle? odd one out?
THATS A LOT OF MSG, not enough :/
p.o.v. no one hits likes.....
Soup dumpling is a sandwich? This throws the hotdogs conversation out the water. Someone tell MatPat
Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
ohhh no Nigel... the meatspin joke rofl :D Also... wheres the "Sorry children" common :D
Upload more forgoodness sake, I wanted another food review and we got u in a dumpling factory. The videos doesn't even take long to make. Now I have to wait another 2 weeks for to upload again
Oh god it's Yi long musk
Great to see a CEO with such passion. Great stuff. Ric
US only!!!  :'(
I'm enjoying this educational factory visit video with pinch of your jokes Uncle!
@5:38 - tbf, Amber Heard's lawyers aren't working that hard. It's like they got their degrees from Trump University.
Loved the video, although the FLT driver in me was screaming at the end "no passengers... Haiya"
4:13 UNCLE ROGER THATS RACIST!!1!!11! 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬👎👎
DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY MEATSPIN !!!
As a white person, I've never tried the fungus truffle because too poor and only had the chocolate ones on special occasions. MSG is a lot cheaper and makes everything taste good. Is why pot noodles taste like sad in a pot now. Why didn't Caleb get Uncle status to become all his employee's uncle?
Do you have any halal food offer? I want to support your channel too. And eat
When will Uncle Nick go and actually visit a factory
i cant order them to my country! why is that?
Camera cut. How many finger🤣🤣🤣
I thought you like haw flakes
I was wondering how me made it over 8 minutes in a video and hadn't heard a jab at Jamie Oliver. Never fail to disappoint uncle roger.
Working harder then Amber heards lawyer? You mean Johnny depps housecleaner?
I wonder how many kg of meat uncle roger just messed up with 25kg of MSG
https://youtu.be/YTCof_A5xEM
🦇🦇🦇🥢🥢🥢🥢🥟🥟🥟
hehehehehehe
"you think poor people doesnt deserve pretty food"-yes king say it loud
in dumplings the more soup there is inside the better it is. lets just say no asian would consider a dumpling that is dry
I was waiting for uncle roger to mention nigella Lawson after talking about the white powder😂😂😂😂😂
When has there ever been a misconception that frozen dumplings are bad?
鼎太豐greetings from taiwan
lol meatspin. u bring back memory. dumpling with munchtoupe.. nice flavor. haha
Why the hell the guy with black shirt looked like elon musk
These are the best dumplings glad we can get them local pickup in Seattle
"some extra flavor in there" that thang gon taste like the ocean
I don't know how much we are going to tolerate this stupidity but he just wasted a hundred pounds of meat by put so much msg
Uncle Roger, that's a bit much, the one you love always leaves you🥲
That Amber heard joke was so underrated!!
oh! you found asian elon musk
Sir when you say two year holiday there is large 'emotional' cost to that maybe think before saying something
So flour pronunciation same as 'flower'?
Only US? Haiya so weak.. When can UK have it?
Uncle Roger, you haven't review Uncle Joshua Weissman's making his version of soup dumpling.
Make small dumpling fry it and add toand add to noodles or fried rice
Elon musk owns a dumpling factory?!  His wife has the tesla
"Go Google meat spin" 😅🤣
throwing food？your mama is coming for you!
👍🏼😉uncle Roger ur the greatest
The way he says, "Haiyaaa" reminds of home, cause Kenyans say it as an interjection, too, lmaooo
This vid makes me hungry ! Export those xiao long bao to Australia already! I can give you the name of Chinese grocery chain where we can all buy them eg Tong Li
is it halal
I wanna try dumplings now
Hallo
they probably threw all that meat with alot of msg , or maybe they did them all into dumplings and gave it to uncle roger , he deserve to eat them all while feeling regret of what he did
I am  USA man I only take the good stuff from you Asians
I really like how you did the marketing for them, a totally unexpected and different spin than the usual approach. I have to regularly remind myself that it's for laughs. I can imagine if people didn't know the intention here, they might not appreciate the humor. Looking forward to see more of this!
4:42 That's a face of a man who can feel their career getting ruined :'D
I guess I could order more with your code. I already have a bunch though lol Like 3 bags still. HAHAHAHA
Asian elon musk
Uncle Roger: Even better you can take this home I thought you already did take her
Dumplings are US only HAYA...
...so how was the mega msg dumping????
Props to Caleb for being so chill in front of the camera and riding along with the jokes. Made the video 100x better
Didn't know they sold steamers. Might have to buy one as well as I'm learning to make tamales :)
even taiwaness dont eat the dumpling from din tai feng
Wait, usually there are gelatin broth or something for making the soup part, right?
the fda thinks it's a sandwich lmao
I Love Xiao Long Bao!
so what is a meatspin  OuO?
You can take Auntie Esther home wih you too..it's just less legal
Is it just me or the CEO looked like Asian version of Elon Musk
Somebody please eat another bat we put the whole world on holiday for two more years 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comedy is nice and all, but ruining so much food for a skit... That's unacceptable.
i regret searching meat spin
A Pork Dumplings??is it Halal(?)
Uncle roger , you should review nephew samseats  I bet you will fuiyoh 😋
This is so cute!!! Oh uncle roger🤣🥰
Waiting for another video with Auntie Esther  Hopefully she gets even more wicked with ye
bro looks like he's the dollar store elon musk
US only.....haiiiyyaaaaaaaa :(
The amount of MSG that he put there
Damn, imagine nigel's set without racist jokes..there would be no jokes except jokes about vegans
LOL who looked up meat spin and realized it was a mistake
What's with the vegan bashing? Sad.
Best way to make people google search something: tell them not to google search something 😄
Searched it
only americans accuse each other of cultural appropriation from what i observe, while other cultures like Asians welcome ppl from other countries who are interested in learning about it.
All I want more than msg is just a full episode of outtakes 😂
2:20 ngl kinda looks like Elon musk
I'm asian and MSG is disgusting honestly, if you put too much MSG
now ive gone and googled meatspin haiyaaaa
The factory people are so awkward to show up on a paid video
Asian Elon Musk
Asian Elon Musk
Asian Elon Musk
5:38 “This machine working harder than Amber Heard’s lawyer” 😂
"Truffle white people msg, eat anything with truffle" ... I feel attacked.  Also, yes, I do.
3:35 got me dyinggg 😭😭😂
I don't know why nephew Caleb remind me of Elon musk 😂
❤️
FDA think this is sandwich  i agree with Uncle Roger face at that moment LOL
Wtf!! @uncleroger i didnt knew what meat spin was and i got curious and googled meat spin now im a bit traumatised 😰
Wtf are you doing uncle roger Packaged dumplings?  Seriously???  I’m so disappointed
i searched "meat spin" cuz i was full of curiosity.. now i regret it
I love dumpling as I ate it growing up! My dad used to make pork dumplings and it was delicious! 😋   - Fellow Malaysian
man is holding his anger
“It’s a vegans worst nightmare…Flavor.” Had me crying lmao 😂
I love the expression of nephew caleb when uncle roger put half big packet of MSG 🤣🤣😂 Uncle Roger is the best asian comedian...or the best comedian in the world. No wonder why he got the title "Uncle"
Uncle Roger just told 5.93 million people to Google meat spin. 😂.  The emotional damage is gonna be insane. 😂🤣
celeb looks like bad guy from squid game
My god that magnet trick to open the meat mixer... i hope they're going back into their FMEA to account for this!!!
Is there any halal version of that?
Those dumplings look so delicious! My family is really white so we’ve never made dumplings but we would enjoy warming these up in a basket. So easy even my mom can’t ruin it when she walks away from the stove while it’s cooking. 😂
Fuiyoh!
Xiaolongbao = sandwich? lmfao. An actual sandwich is bigger than 4 dumplings tho. Fda weird
Little did we know this was entirely a sponsorship segment
🌹🌹🥰🥰❤️❤️🌻🌻
When you said don't search meatspin, I felt I need to do it now 😅
I Googled meat spin. I was not proud.
Just fondling 😏
My mom needs to see this. Maybe she'll buy these dumplings.
老板惴惴不安的眼神是本视频的亮点
Can we find these dumplings in the UK??
That Caleb guy looks so boring, he seems uncomfortable with uncle Roger’s jokes. Get a better host next time
Too much MSG Uncle Roger Haiyaaaa
I do not like truffle
Asian Elon Musk!
Is it good vegan with tofu and MSG?
best weejio so far....."MAKE MSG GREAT AGAIN" go for more factory weejio and dump all the msg. convert them to MSG lover ....
I've seen tons of ads for these dumplings by now. Seems a little expensive for me at the moment, but wow what a good win for the brand to get Uncle Roger to come pay a visit. Very cool!
These dumplings are absolutely not worth the money.  $160 and some showed up cracked.  Very little actual soup, if any.  If you have ever had Din Tai Fung, don't even abuse yourself with these.
“Somebody please eat another bat, we put the whole world on a holiday for two more year" can only be said by Uncle Roger lol
5:30 Just skip this part lmao  (You will regret it if you dont)
I accidentally googled it😳
$29.95 for bamboo steamer haiyaaaaaa
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
“We’ve been married for eight years of course not” 💀 the dead pan delivery of that took me out
Uncle Roger my asian grannie will rise from the grave with that amount of MSG.
I need the uncle Roger tv show…
Don’t like truffle
BRO THAT'S CANCER LEVELS OF MSG
Big shout out to Uncle Roger and Caleb for promoting traditional Shanghainese food Xiao long bao, and this product looks really good! I’m Shanghainese and a hardcore xiao long bao fan, this is my 59th day locked at home. this video made me crave for xiao long bao like Uncle Roger with MSG…
6:00 hey i found similar thing like that too on doujin with tagged nakadashi😏
Uncle Roger has clearly watched his daily does of Lock picking lawyer.
Please don't add truffles, as a white person who is allergic to mushrooms Please don't add truffles hahahaha.
Damn, it feels like he hasn't uploaded in years
we have strayed too far Uncle Roger. You no longer even apologize to the children. You just fondle those dumplings without warning now.😂
Vegan afraid of flavor? Sriracha is vegan. garlic is vegan. MSG is vegan.  I thought MSG was king of flavor? it's vegan!
Oh my god uncle roger knows meatspin, don't make me feel like a boomer aaaaaaa
Oh god, that "vegan's worst nightmare: flavor" had me laughing so hard!
These dumplings... They are fine. Not really worth the price. My cheap dim sum restaurant near me does better.
This dudes hilarious
The "This is vegans worst nightmare...flavor!" Line ohh man I was cracking up
Good video lol
*uncle Roger dumps half of MSG Sack* Nephew Celeb:"Nice"
vigans worst nightmare your a savage one uncle 😂😂😂 half sack of msg well-done hahahahah😂
🤣 Scarlet Johansson favourite Asian actress (ala her in Ghost in the Shell)
5:00 lmao the ceo getting flustered over roger's pisstake. that's a cultural clash, in Australia and the UK it's an endearing thing to sarcastically belittle someone in certain situations.
Those dumplings look so delicious! My family is really white so we’ve never made dumplings but we would enjoy warming these up in a basket. So easy even my mom can’t ruin it when she walks away from the stove while it’s cooking. 😂
Msg amount approved by uncle.
we want the dumpling receipe video by uncle roger!!
see you pouring that msg my neck start to itch
2:40 henry phillips vibes
UGHHH, amber heard is everywhere isn't she?   ps. I saw her while shitting idk why  aistsbakahafabama
My mom needs to see this. Maybe she'll buy these dumplings.
No…BAT?!? 😪
Caleb be like: yeah whatever you're no longer gonna be here tomorrow anyway 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
wow.. how much did they give you to make that awful video... seriously, not even two laughs out of it.. stick to other stuff vs making a multi-minute infomercial.
Steamer and Dumplings, much cheaper than Mike Chens overpriced hotpot kit lol
the MSG
Everybody gangsta until uncle Roger's special dumpling recipe starts glowing out of MSG
Big shout out to Uncle Roger and Caleb for promoting traditional Shanghainese food Xiao long bao, and this product looks really good! I’m Shanghainese and a hardcore xiao long bao fan, this is my 59th day locked at home. this video made me crave for xiao long bao like Uncle Roger with MSG…
🤣 nephew Caleb has some serious Asian Elon vibes 🤣🤘
“This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer.” - that got a chuckle out of me
Hot damn, Uncle Roger is forklift certified?
Jamie Oliver throw Uncle Roger in machine 😂😂😂
"Uncle Roger's favourite Asian actress is Scarlett Johannson"  is it because she has two big dumplings?
*WHO ELSE READ "DUMPING" FACTORY?!* 🤣
The machines work harder than Amber Heard lawyers…🤣
"This machine works harder than amber heard's lawyer" I LOST IT
The look on Nephew Caleb's face when he dumped the bag of MSG in
is it only me that thinks the ceo looks like asian elon musk
I wonder who get the extra MSG dumpling
I also like xiao long pao uncle roger!
Uncle Roger: This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer Me: E-MO-TION-AL DAMAGE!
Is this XLB available in Canada?
Big shout out to Uncle Roger and Caleb for promoting traditional Shanghainese food Xiao long bao, and this product looks really good! I’m Shanghainese and a hardcore xiao long bao fan, this is my 59th day locked at home. this video made me crave for xiao long bao like Uncle Roger with MSG…
Your thumbnail🥲

“So you think homeless people don’t deserve pretty food?”   🫣😲 I mean, Uncle Roger isn’t wrong. 🫢
damn nephew caleb was mad the whole time!
uncle roger pls concern about the safety, that safety equipment is a must. If we do like you do, we already get fired directly, please don't promote unsafe act to children. And one more, usually in the factory they have their formula to maintain their quality, i'm felling sorry for the owner, because you throw the MSG too much, then they will throw all the dumpling for this film thing because of you (because they have to maintain their quality and pride of the product), so next time please maintain the formula of the product,  because you already can film it (it is already lucky, because usually no take picture or film on the production of factory, for secret of the formula).
How is dumpling a sandwich
You look great today.
Nice wigeo and a good factory! Congrats! :)
MY NAME IS CALEB LOL
Can we all appreciate the fact that Uncle Roger never disappointed us with his content  😊 👏
Is meatspin still a thing?
Sad these don’t travel to Canada!
I love dumpling as I ate it growing up! My dad used to make pork dumplings and it was delicious! 😋   - Fellow Malaysian
thoes look nothing like xiao long bao... its should look semi translucent and sag alittle at the base. that look like a steamed jianbao with out getting fried
We dont put bats
the skin looks slightly too thick for a xiao long bao tho
Nephew Caleb: *dead inside* "some extra flavour in there"
lmao that ending
Too many spam haiyaa
Got to give credit to Uncle Roger for making every video top quality! Not everyone can sustain a YouTube channel after a viral video 😎😎
I'm in uk I want some dumplings I've never had any in my life and they look tasty fuck you us
Uncle Roger is just one of the top creators for food. He mixes comedy with information i just love it, keep up the great work watched you since 200 k ")
"this machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer"☠☠
i didn't think he was legit gonna throw half a bag of MSG in that meat, holy fck...
Meat spin is SOOOOO old omg! 😭😭😭😭
I dont care how many times ive seen it, "Emotional damage" still has me roaring laughing
We put the whole world on holiday for 2 more yrs...
4:55 "my milkshake brings all boys to the yard"
When you live in Seattle and are disappointed you missed Uncle Roger irl.
Please go to tigerbelly show and talk with Bobby Lee
Well if you want to eat ding tai feng, you can’t find it in the east coast…just saying. I’m kinda interested in trying some of these XCJ ones. And as a Taiwanese growing up with eating many XLB, I accept this challenge. 😎
I'm surprised how much they let you get away with uncle Roger they are much better mannered than many other American companies
“This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer.” - that got a chuckle out of me
2:26 that guys face lol
thanks to facebook ads I bought some of these months ago and they are pretty good. Also UPS messed up my delivery and caused them to arrive fully thawed out and they XCJ made it right by redoing my order for free.
Will it available in Malaysia?
My mouth just dropped when dropped that MSG    Not because of the excessive MSG, but because I’m water with all that MEATY FLAVOUR  FUIYOH
I love when everyone is a good sport and joins in the humor.
My goodness the amount of MSG!! LOL
I can't order these all the way in Australia :( sorry Uncle Roger
Take a shot for every time “emotional damage” isn’t funny.
So is this how he got food poisoning, eating cold dumplings
Uncle Roger, if you endorse it, I’ll buy it. Getting them today
Lmao
lucky winners for MSG overload dumplings hehe.
1:20 sorry children
is it big marvel grew up and now promoting food?
FDA seeing dumpling as a sandwich is just hilarious.... It reminds me of Brock's Jelly-filled donut scene from Pokemon...
Uncle Roger can't cook for shit
the dintaifung in surabaya just closed since the pandamic    now we dont have dintaifung anymore only in jakarta
"Uncle Roger's favourite Asian actress is Scarlett Johansson" 😂
Uncle Roger pouring that whole bag of msg made me feel sorry for whoever gets the meat with the whole bag of msg
It's not a Uncle Roger video if it doesn't have a Jamie Oliver's roast 😂😂
Merica?
I like the AH vs JD reference. I started watching the case thanks to Roger. Waiting for final decision.
i like how  uncle roger said hes a good driver and still almost hit a car of caleb's wife HAHAH
He should of called din tai fung. Ding Lei gor fei. LOLs... It would been more funny.
Why did I google meatspin
When u hacked the machine with a magnet, for a moment, the vision of your fingers getting stuck flashed through my mind.
"Vegan worst nightmare: flavor." My new favorite quote since "emotional damage"
the qty per bag triggered my OCD once I heard a serve was 4 dumplings...12.5 servings per bag but the bag said 13 serves 🤔
Its so awkward.
Thanks Uncle Roger, I just placed my first order of Dumplings and got a couple of sauces too! Thanks for the Discount too😄
I'm going to buy a bag and add extra MSG like uncle Roger; but first I need my KIng Of Flavour hoodie.
the moment amber heard lawyer was mention LOL
Is the extra msg version for sale?
We didn't see a taste test of the extra msg dumplings! Smh
Caleb look like Elon Musk's long lost twin
I'm horrified seeing him dump a sack of msg in that batch. Well I hope uncle Roger paid for that extra cost.
I have a friend named xiao long 😆
No more "sorry children" haiyaa
Guy editimg the video: no actually dont google that   Me: heh imma search it.........MY EYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS AAAAAAAAAA
Fun fact MSG is not good for you
That ain't no chicken and dumplins but I gave a like because truffle is delicious.
Your supposed to steam them? Oh, that would make a difference.
I've always heard of white people but I can't find white land on any map not even Google knows where white land is  hiyah uncle Roger is a racist
Uncle roger u shoud try momo from nepal
this was fun.  dude was funny!  You funny too.  yeah, great vid  :)  and I HATE truffles.
Imagine living in a world where attempting to cook something with the original methods might be considered bad by anyone
But how does it compare to Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao?
I vote nphew Caleb wife should fondle dumplings more oftan..often... haya... 😄😆😆😆 add spice to marriage!
Yoooo
$15 dollars for 3 dumplings. Fuck that.
the ceo kinda looks like asian elon musk
I'll be honest, this is your worst vid Uncle Roger. I hate seeing food being wasted, but that is exactly what you did by pouring the bag of MSG in the blender. The dumpling CEO didn't seem impressed. Thumbs down.
OSHA needs to stay away from this video 👀
John 3:3 "except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God". John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that wosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life". John 3:36 "He that believeth on the son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him". Hell is not worth it. Repent from your idolatry, from your unbelief, from all sin and turn to Jesus Christ today.
"Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteouss man his thoughts: and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon" - Isaiah 55:6-7. While you are still on this earth, the mercy of God is abundant, but after death there will be no mercy to the prideful, unbelieving, and rebelious soul. Turn away from your sin and seek God and he will give you mercy.
Uncle Roger should visit more factorys.
"Why do people you love always leave you" Me to myself: emotional damage
04:42 nephew Caleb knew, he's gonna lose that batch, because uncle Rodger fukd up
Didn't know uncle Roger likes putting his nephew dumplings in his mouth.
Why would you want to make fun using slandered Chinese English??
I have a steamer. Learnt I have to put baking paper down coz things stick. But it’s amazing. Great for steaming everything Soup dumplings are my fave
Can't wait to see your show in Melbourne
These are super important. Putting on authentic quality Asian businesses!
I 100% used to smoke herb next to this warehouse on my breaks lmaooo
Nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
well.. who else googled meatspin?😂
Bruh thats or much msg
I've never had truffle but I do love it.
I LOVE a good frozen dumpling - in America it is VERY rare to find handmade dumplings but Asian grocery stores usually have a good variety 👌
We do love truffles
I wish this came with halal option as well! looks delicious!
This machine is working harder than Amber Herb's lawyer Oh my God that got me 🤣
i hate dumping not because it’s made in china cuz idc if it’s made from anywhere but because it’s shit
2:48 "This is Vegans' worst nightmare: Flavor~"
How I love you for saying "this machine words harder than Amber Turd's lawyer" FUIYOHHH
caleb looks like serizawa's 3 in command in crows zero😂 real ones know
Imagine uncle roger in an Ajimomoto factory
I can have the shittiest day  but uncle Roger shows up in my feed and mu life has meaning again!
im white and i dont think i've ever had truffle lmao
Best combination tikka mutton and tikka (rob/yogurt and hamas pepsi after withe powder bcoz after u can't eat
phytoplankton
by the way my name is caleb
Uncle caleb is internally crying after you drown msg in meat mixer
"When white people go to Chinatown grocery store, they too scared to buy this." I'm not scared, I just can't understand Chinese.   There's people in Chinatown who don't speak a word of English, only Chinese. I can't read the signs or understand a word of the language, that's why I haven't visited the Chinatown near where I live.
I Google meat spin, uncle Roger u is nasty
The problem is that she won't taste what she is making for me so has no idea at all what it REALLY tastes like... hence the not so good cooking ( I am trying to be nice, it's usually awful) but I have to be ok with it??? So, I much prefer that she not cook for me. Indian food I find to be gross and she couldn't cook it anyway. 🙂
Look up meat church BBQ fried rice
Man this was such a nice video!
here for the truffles
Wtf throws half a bag of msg HAHHAHAHHAHAHA
Good job, Uncle Roger!  Love these field trip weejos!
Dumpling man is a really good sport.
Your lucky he didn't put u in the meat spin when you pointed out that his employees know more than him 🤣
Sorry uncle roger, your warning is an order
Shouldn’t “soup dumplings” be 汤包 which literally translates to soup dumpling. Also, is dumplings the long one with the folds on top or the round one with a point in the middle.
US only😢 huh?
3:29 No one ate a bat recently but someone did diddle a monkey
Lol the FDA part is crazy
BREAKING NEWS: GOOGLE SEARCH OF "MEAT SPIN" IS HIGHEST EVER RECORDED
Don't like the way you deal with food. Huge waste of food after putting such an amount of MSG, just for vedio making?
7:13 MSG is our MSG as far as I know
MSG Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
plenty of stuff freezes great..  it's just the several things that don't, or that you need to freeze -rapidly-, that give freezing a bad name.
A sack of white powder, where is Nigella?
Always wanted to try dumplings and after seeing your video will have to buy this brand. Also not all “white people” likes truffles Uncle Roger 🤣
3:25 Uncle Rodger thinks they make Soylent Green
I’m so scared that uncle roger would offend the ceo even tho he’s the one that did it 😂
When Uncle Roger reschedules shows in Toronto, I ain’t missing it for all the MSG in the world 🌎
I’m white but please keep truffle away from my dumplings!    If you sell in Japan I will buy some!
Lol.
man nephew caleb looked SO DONE
i honestly love 小笼包, 很好吃!
right here in WA. Love em
When he said we put the whole world 🌎 on holidays for 2 more years 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀
Nigel Ng really up hear lowkey encouraging the workers to unionise and strike for better wages. Based Comrade Uncle Roger
I looked it up…. You do you i guess. 😳
That Amber Heard joke tho.... 🔥 😂🤣
This machine work more harder than Amber heard lawyer hhahahha 😂😂😂😂😂
Omg, you were in Seattle 😁 I hope you got to visit Pike Place Market ❤️
Did uncle Roger call black widow asian
Yo is that asian elon
原來小籠包係咁整嘅
I stopped watching right after he dumped an insane amount of MSG into the meat, I’m sure it’s a write-off & very wasteful. Not funny at all & a total turn-off.
4:30 Nephew Caleb looks so disappointed at Uncle Roger when he dumped that whole bag of MSG into The Dumpling Fillings
3:17 Caleb : "Have you tried human fingers ?" Uncle Roger : _"No..."_ Why does he sound like a child that just got scolded while answering that ???
Uncle Roger on fire again with cultural pairings!!!!!😂🤣😅😆I almost spit out my beer when you mentioned Scarlett Johansen. 😆
Caleb looks like Chinese version of Elon musk
Can we all appreciate the fact that Uncle Roger never disappointed us with his content  😊 👏
LMFAO even Mr Roger be taking shots At Amber Turd
Uncle Roger, pls more "emotional damage"-guy, so fanny meme :))
I see you getting better over time. I see you improving as you learn and experience more. As you come out with more and more content and videos, they become more connected. Uncle Roger showing some things we didn't know about him either, LoL. It gets more theatrical and rich, touching on cheesy even sometimes, but in just the cute little ways where it works just right. Even the bloopers have more substance, thought and aren't just random sketches you happened to pick out that might be funny.  I see you refining your craft.  It's an amazing journey and I'm just glad I get to see some of the show! Great job, Nigel! Looking forward to the next time you in TX!
Cats not bats🤙🤣
ROFL... an avalanche of MSG.  Even for you Uncle Roger I think that too much flavor!
FDA: "dumplings are sandwiches"  FDA just lost their credibility
UNCLE ROGER NO NOT MEATSPIN
ㅤㅤㅤ
Nephew Caleb looks like Elon musk💀💀
Wasting food is not cool.
“This machine works harder better then amber heard lawyer “ Im done😭💀💀💀
I can’t believe you poured that much msg in that batch hahahaha
I love that you are in Seattle my home town
"Vegans worst nightmare... flavor..." I am crying so hard right now! My vegan wife's cooking is... problematic
That bag of MSG 🤣🤣🤣
That Ghost in The shell joke caught me off guard 🤣🤣🤣
“ *NOW THATS A LOT OF **-damage-** MSG* “
They can really put that MSG overdosed batch on sale by slapping Uncle Roger's nametag on it - "XCJ x Uncle Roger." Definitely gonna fly high lmfao
How do I get to do an intern here?
Hi
Thia Machine work harder than Amber Heard Lawyer hahahaha
Day 2 of asking Uncle Roger to react to pietsmiet kocht fried rice
I  hope UNCLE Roger bought the ”extra msg” batch!!
They look sooo good!

uncle roger funny i happy when upload
So much msg.
Now uncle Roger should go to msg factory I bet he will faint with happiness

2:30 skipped out on a good Nigella Lawson joke
Same jokes every video

WE arent too scared to buy bamboo steamer's I am a white caucasian male who is addicted to BOBA AND DUMPLINGS. I have looked for a steamer for over 2 years unable to find one, thanks for that link I bought one.
When was the last video where Jamie Olive Oil was not dissed? :D :D
That guy just seems to be annoyed when uncle Roger makes jokes but I forgot he was Asian.
You ruined that batch, that's not fun.
Just to say thanks for meat spin i just got to go to the store to grab the lotion and tissue paper for certain reasons
👌
Uncle Roger, U so funny…lub U long time.🤪🙏🏼
This made me drive to the supermarket and get a bag of dumplings
I am white people. I have really tried, but I don't like truffle :(.
Some extra flavor lol
40$ for 50pcs sound expensive to me
0:12 and who said you couldn't "TAKE" her at your basement as well.
Nobody: ‘googles meatspin’
AANNNDD someone's fired for disabling a safety interlock . . .
xiao long bao is my favorite dim sum! I am now hungry :(
uncle roger looking so proud of his "extra msg meat"
So much white powder....that's only an afternoon worth for Amber Heard!
Niece and nephew approve
So litttlllleeee 😂😂😂😂
Yesterday I had to watch Jamie Oliver for cooking at school. I was dieing in disappointment.
what a load of qeeck
Haiya they don’t ship to PR…
What do you call a happy Asian pirate? Uncle Roger.
Meat spin is my new favorite pastime!
Awesome video! Would love more videos like this!
29.95 for a steamer they are under 4 pounds (7 dollars) at a Chinese supermarket Fuuyoo
Pork dumbling is my favourite.  MSG is not good for the machine 🤣🤣🤣
40 bucks for 50 dumplings haiyaaaa
Empties out the entire msg bag into the meat...Lmao
the first sentence i came when he pour the pack of msg... what the fuck hahahah
💜👍💜👍😂
MSG is good! Wrongly demonized!
Good to see the nose candy hasn't changed him :)
Okay kids, this msg is getting too much. Just remember , tasting raw msg makes your tongue go brrr.  One more thing, MSG definitely doesnt taste anything special. Its just salty sweet.
Strangers say. Not your tshirt, i fuck you!..................in Chania.. mister Uncle...  eehheeeheee
I think Uncle Roger/mrnigIng messing some love? I thing, not to cocing rigs olldatime. Uncle Roger sut get in the game!! Not 5 dollar, but 60 dollar. aayyhhaa!!!   (on the market) LOL! hahahahah
He looks like an Asian Elon Musk
Is no one talking about the fact that he dumped like 20-30 pounds of MSG into the meat?!?
Uncle Roger is now my favourite person ever for calling the CEO useless and encouraging the employees to request raises right in front of him!
4:42 nephew Caleb almost died seeing that much MSG 😂
Uncle roger I searched up meat spin, I’m scarred and confused at the same time, what is this haiyaaaa?
there is a vegeterian version?
Would love a vegan version !
I enjoyed this infomercial!
No fkn Bats!
Someone please tell me what "meat spin" is. I'm afraid to google it.
Too soon for a bat joke 😂😂😂😂
Genuinely tell me if that batch of meat was used/paid for ;_ ; Food waste is such a huge issue I really hope it wasn't all scrapped for a bit.
That jab at scarlet johanson was genius
Shit bro.. Never throw food! Do you not remember what will happen if u throwing food when u in malaysia? If i saw my kids do that..they gonna taste love from me.
Jamie onliner 😂
4 Xiaolongbao per serving......Are you kdding me? I eat 3 trays at least.
White People have our own dumplings. We just boil am
Caleb has never heard of Uncle Roger :-D
Those dumplings look so delicious! My family is really white so we’ve never made dumplings but we would enjoy warming these up in a basket. So easy even my mom can’t ruin it when she walks away from the stove while it’s cooking. 😂
15$ for 3 dumplings?! No wonder Din Tai Fung is so rich... Us white nephews and nieces didn't have Uncle Roger to show us better hayaa!...
I love that brand! Love uncle Roger going to the factory!
I honestly thought that Uncle Roger said, "Fag Tree" then I realized, "factory".
3:45 - there's something that takes me back to college.
The machine couldn't handle the MSG
I bought these a few weeks ago! BEST dumplings ever! Highly recommend. It's okay Uncle Roger. I'll buy from here also.. was going to buy more anyway! 😘
what even is a dumpling?  white questions matter....
Don’t know what’s a bigger crime, that lost bag of msg or FDA classification of dumplings as sandwiches
The best way to start the working week. Thanks uncle Roger
3:45 meatspin 😆
the owner looks like asian elon musk
Excellent job 👌🏻 Greetings from Scotland 🌻 Have a good day everyone 🌻
Can Uncle Roger fight? I am an Auntie Esther stan as well, and I'm not even into women... I think.
Uncle Roger please review Jamaican dishes
Wish they shipped to Canada, it's so hard to find good dumplings where I live u_u
why does he sound like elon musk?
Why he look like Elon musk
5:13 uncle roger gonna start a union over there  p.s portion sizes on packagings is like this "if your product has too much sugar, oil, salt or ..... you just lower the portion size and you pass the regulation but every body is gonna eat normal and get the lovely extra salt and oil
sorry jamie oliver gonna make soup Dumpling with munstru? what is that. couldnt hear clearly over loud machine..
I don't like ruining a whole batch of meat for the MSG joke. the rest was fun
Uncle Roger looks like an old granny with dyed hair with that hairnet
why they leave? : l
dumbling? you mean where they nigel?
A pack of dumplings cost around 4 euro here. $40 seems like a huge rip off lol
please dont google that lol
I was wondering if there would be no Jamie olive oil burn in this episode, thankfully I was wrong.
Funny funny why you like using your fingers so much 🤣🧐
Uncle roger literally roast everyone between his videos😂😂
small correction on the din tai fung part  There is actually two din tai fung's, one is the north american one, the other is the Taiwanese one, and as you can guess the Taiwanese one is much better but you cant find it in north america
Uncle roger I need a vegan dumpling 😘
Why would you tell me NOT to google something, knowing damn well I'm finna do it. Haiiyaaaa
As a white person I'm so glad I already liked the video before the truffle comment. F#$% truffles!
Don’t be silly, we do not like truffle, far too expensive. Just use artifical truffle flavour.
nephew Caleb got that Asian Elon musk look
uncle roger, you forgot the "sorry children" 😢 haiyaa
crap the meatspin
lol og's remember meatspin
hello to the people who get this batch of dumpling with extra msg
Those looked good!!
Frozen soup dumplings?  Approved by Uncle Roger?  Where has this been all my life?
Nephew Caleb was done with this hole video from the beginning. 🤣🤣🤣
So this is just an ad? pffft.
Roger please stop wasting food by over adding MSG.
😂❤🙏
thats that halal tho :(
Ong din tai fung is so expensive
Awesome show thank you
“Why do the people you love always leave you” 😂😂😂
😍
29.95 lmao they sell those for 5dollars at my local asian market (the steamer) and this is as Mỹ đen; not even asian lol
Heyy uncle roger Can you please react to chef ranveer brar next ?? I really want him to have uncle title
Uncle Roger please review those South Indian cooking channel.
White people live in Uncle Logers head RENT FREE.
At this point Stephen yelling EMOTIONAL DAMAGE is basically Asian Rick Roll
Only ever had them frozen so wouldn't have a clue if I'm missing anything with fresh.
I wonder what they did with all those msg filled dumplings 😳
The moment of realisation when uncle Roger realised it's Caleb's wife  "Oops, somebody dumpling not getting fondle tonight
DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!  That MSG pour must have cost you Tons of $$$  ..... But I am Buying these online right now!!! Great Collab!!!!  BRB with Final thoughts! Well done!  So funny and  Caleb was so cool and professional with a great sense of humour!
7:15 well I aint hittin that like
4:33 how to f... A batch, but sure is flavourful
Scarlett Johansson joke was not bad. Not bad
3:36 brb ima go eat a bat
"We put the the whole world on holiday for two years." 😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻
Maybe white rich people like truffles. I'm 50 and never had a single one. Never seen it anywhere.
The machine work harder than Amber Heard's lawyer. Legendary words uncle
She don't fondle Nephew Caleb's dumplings.... She squeeze them 😂
2:15. That’s some high quality ASMR
should have said, "we dont count the dumplings, we just use feeling"
YOOOOO
really hoping uncle roger paid for that messed up batch......
That a lot of msg... I swear you wont taste that or get headache
Why does he look like Elon musk lol.
BROOOOOOOOO the face of the man when he just grabbed his MSG back and poured the whole thing in the meat. Lmao I'M DEAD
Don't waste food Uncle Roger.
I could use another 2 year vacation
We👏should👏stop👏wasting👏food👏for👏views👏
Those look like they have lots of FlAVOUR
Love this episode those dumplings  looks tasty.  The only thing that puzzles  me is that fda thinks this a sandwich?
Lol savage ending burn an the cut emotional damage!!!!
at 5:00 the womans reaction on the background is great.
Ok
Food can always be better than groupies. THAT'S why you are the one fondling your dumplings in hotel room at night. Then again, quality over quantity.
沒有電鍋我不是很認可🌝
Uncle Roger makes me question my whiteness... I don't do any of those things 💀
Hello uncle Roger ( from my  kids)😃
Hey Uncle Roger, you should visit Portland Oregon soon! My family owns a small restaurant and it be awesome for you to come out and help around the restaurant and yell at customers! Lol
80 cents per dumpling is still expensive. In India, we eat 12 dumplings for $2.
this is a first...i didn't laugh or even giggle once...
No fingers stuck today...
Uncle Roger when they stop filming: Ok done with the accent.
"Machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer" LMFAO
People who got uncle rogers msg dumpling be like: “how is this so dang good?”
I has a steamer and im never going back! 🔥
Com to swiden fast swides fod
aiyaah    i  do  beleive  the  Kung Fu  Dumpling  Princess  in  my injured  chinese  neighborhood  might  have  not  survived:  Dumpling King, NoMiaBea.    all  lovingly  hand  made.  the  Dumpling  Princess  made  the  vegetarian  ones  Personally.   hope  one  day  the  vegetarian  market  will  make  you  very very  rich.     i  pray  for  them...
Bro Chill on Auntie Esther, you got stalker vibes and obsessive behaviour
Speaking as someone raised in Mexico who moved to America. Please have some of my culture. Culture appropriation is a real problem yes, but that doesn't mean eating tacos and wearing sarapes is wrong.   I will gladly share my culture
I love when everyone is a good sport and joins in the humor.
You joke about cocaine in the dumplings but there was an incident some months ago here in Vegas where this thai place got shut down cause they had meth in their buffet and people eating there noticed they were stoned driving back lol. The news prolly didn't reach all the way to England though.
Now I know what meatspin is, thank you.
Lmao Meatspin was a thing we did to eachother in middle school
Man made it 50% msg
#Meatspin
When you dumped that whole bag of MSG in there, that was actually upsetting... like seriously dude, you ruined their whole batch :/ Other than that, was funny, and Caleb seems pretty chill
6:00 It's the number of fingers lost Uncle Roger...
I just spent $137 after watching this 10 minute ad.  Good job Rodger.
Although research is mixed on how MSG may affect overall health, it's clear that consuming high doses of 3 grams or higher of MSG per day is likely to lead to adverse side effects, including headache and increased blood pressure... OMG UNCLE ROGER GOING TO DIE SOON RIP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So the entire video is an advert?
This white person not like truffle, more msg please, like salt but better like crack cocaine of salt.
ohhhh, can get at factory, within driving distance for me. YAY.
Mo:mo 👺
man look like Do Kwon, but better
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The crude sexual humor ruins the whole bit.  You are funnier without it.  Talent wasted.
So happy to see XCJ get more coverage! And now I can get an Uncle Roger discount. :) It's a good day.
poor jamie chilly jam olive oil, hes always getting dumplinged on.
Petition for uncle roger to dye his hair red
OSHA would love to see the ending of this video
i thought he would've said, "You follow the fda, you fked up."
Plot twist: the person in the Tesla was nephew nick
Jokes aside, is there such a thing as too much msg? I thought he was joking but he put the ENTIRE BAG of msg in there 🤣
Caleb was low key annoyed… lol
🤨 I'm sure Uncle Roger paid for all that.... But I'm probably gonna have to un subscribe for that food waste 😡
White people question for uncle roger....what sort of paper goes inside the bamboo steamer
RIP those who received that msg dumplings
The interaction between Uncle Roger and Caleb reminded me of old school Ali G interviews 😄
Im definitely going to find these.
My god, Uncle Roget bringing up meatspin LOL
Uncle Roger forgot to say Nephew Caleb factory so weak for not having chopsticks at hand.
I would have bought some dumplings but they offer only meat fillings. They look delicious too, oh well.
That's a lot of meat uncle Roger fucked up. I'd still eat uncle rogers meat.
It’s hard to make me laugh, and I laughed out loud everytime i watched UR 🤣
Can we trick the machine it's closed🤣🤣🤣
I use a bamboo steamer on Gyoza. Number one.
为什么roger叔每次都要搞黄色，能不能多搞一点
great ad
Does anyone know what comes when you search 'Meat Spin'? Its sounds funny but Im too scared
He just ruined a batch of dumplings.  Not to mention wasted a whole bag of MSG.
Uncle Roger clearly didn't watch Jimmy's tutorial on eating soup dumpling.  But uncle Roger is Chinese also. Should know how to eat it like chinese adults do. 😂
Early
🤣 works harder than Amber's lawyer
0:17 there is two Uncle rogers?
Uncle roger just takes the forklift lmao
This machine working harder than Amber Heard’s lawyer” lmaooooo
I just know uncle rogers cholesterol is higher than the success of Beijing corn
Nephew Caleb when uncle roger throwing msg inside the beef : what are you doing??? Mean while uncle roger : I am just adding flavour. Mean while the staff behind the camera : 😦😦😦
Machine works harder than Amber Heard's lawyers his humour is unbeatable lmao
Xiao Chi Jie make great dumplings!  We had them at the restaurant and now are subscribers to have their dumplings shipped to our home.
Pushed the boss so far out of his comfort zone, his dumplings are now genuine Asian.
the 'Uncle Roger tours" episodes are great, if only because people have no idea about what they're getting into. they think they do, but they're so wrong
Bro this guy looks exactly like asian Elon Musk
"Pretentious dumpling shop" ...you hit it on the nose Uncle Roger! Din Tai Fung is over-priced, over-rated and over-caters to people (Westerners I'm talking to you) who can't even hold their chopsticks correctly.
Emotional Damage !
Rip Sidhu Moose wala
Just got these couple days ago at their store
This Machine work harder than Hamber Heard Lawyer😂😂😂😂
I came for uncle Roger but left with an amber turd burn of the century.
Next time I come with you
“Somebody please eat another bat, we put the whole world on a holiday for two more year" can only be said by Uncle Roger lol
Din Tai Fung is good though, Uncle.
Where's your "sorry children" uncle roger 😕😏 haiyaaah hahahaha
US only?!😱😱😱 Where can I get this in London (UK)?🙄
Don’t disrespect dintaifung like that
Uncle Roger buy every Wang soup dumpling
Still waiting for you to watch a cram aqiang video. Are you afraid because he is Chinese Maybe you could tell us if his translations is what he is really saying, is he really uncle. Do all Orientals eat like that
Somebody dumpling not getting fondled tonight 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Uncle Roger doesn't know how to eat a Xiao Long Bao? Haiyaaa.
hope you enjoyed Seattle! Lots of great asian restaurants around the city and in the International District
Caleb is too much rigid.
Glad to see you're taking white powder correctly uncle🤣🤣
Damn it felt like yesterday when Nigel hit 5 million subscribers and now he’s about to get to 6. Good job, Uncle! Very well deserved.
Way too fuqqing expensive.👎👎🤷‍♂️
As a white person truffle makes me sick. Now i cant like video
If Elon Musk was asian.
How to get these dumplings in the Eu, Germany? --i don´t know because I´m white AF
Tbh I do feel weird when I go to an Asian grocery store
4 dumpling? Haiyaa, 4 is unlucky number in Chinese culture, never serve 4 of them.
鼎泰丰中枪😂😂😂
yes!! frozen dumpling is one of my stable foods
For that 1% that googled Meat Spin 🙏
Can I have aunty ester number as you didn't take her home
as a Malaysian, if you say 'no' it's mean 'yes' to us😂. so, yes, we search 'meatspin' eventually🤣
Makes jokes about fingers in the mix, ruins a batch, makes a joke that the CEO is useless, jokes that the give away seconds should be better. Uncle Roger is never going to get invited anywhere ever again.
Uncle roger pls help me I am going on a cruise with a Jamie Olive oil reastuant
Hey uncle Roger Latino MSG is Tahgin
"don't actually google it "  the more reason you should google it
Why do I feel that Uncle Rodger is going to kill somebody with MSG?😅
7:58 The face he makes after confirming, “So FDA thinks this a sandwich??” 🫠
"why do the people you love leave you" 😥
Nephew Caleb didn’t look happy with his machinery being touched
6:19 Auntie Helen: What you say? *What you say?!* Auntie Helen never use pork.
That whole MSG going to the machine :'
I knew the company before I even saw the logo 😂💗 I'm pumped. thier stuff is pretty fucking good too. 👌
Special Uncle Roger batch of dumplings!!! I'll be looking for those on their website! 🤣🤣🤣
Without a doubt 98% of viewers have googled meatspin
This machine works harder than Amber Heard's lawyer.       - emotional damage -
The machine working harder than Amber Heards Lawyer😂😂
dumpling best Chinese dish :)
Uncle Roger is just too much, but he tells it like it is
Uncle Roger would be the first to get a finger in there! 🤣🤣
Love you uncle Roger but not funny ruining food like that
I see Uncle Roger is forklift certified
" This machine work harder than amber heard lawyer" -uncle Roger 2022
hmm, personally i prefer 교자만두
POV MSG 4:30
“Extra flavor in there… nice…” I hope you ended up paying for all that. Jebus
Uncle Roger uploads are like good sex- They always leave you smiling      (Me, a virgin....)
I hope I can buy those in Norway one day!
Is that Asian Elon musk
"fuiyoh, so much white powder. is nigella lawson having party?"  ain't no way 💀
5:38 **"These machines working harder than Amber Heard's lawyer"**- uncle Roger   Dumplings (shots) fired.
💀
"Don't google meat spin"  "That makes me even more curious"  *Googles meat spin  *Regrets life decisions
Pls don't look up meatspin 💀
There it is, hahahah AH burn! Lol
That guy looks like Elon Musk
No matter how good the Dumplings are ,A LITTLE EXTRA MSG makes it always better . FUIYOH !!!!
US Only?! Sad.
hahahha finally someone point at DTF, no idea how come their dumplings are considered good
Uncle Roger just said 小吃街的 哈哈哈哈
I like the non ads video better
8:12 😂😂
Now going to get some dim sum for dinner 🤣
How much did you pay or did they pay you to dump half a bag of their MSG and ruin a batch of their meat?
Your wife fondle your dumpling like this? OF COURSE NOT 😂😂😂
Shipping us only... haiya... he Asian. Why only Shipping us? Asian country ship everywhere. is he in us so long he forget to be Asian so much he only know to make dumpling but nothing else?
😂 1:20 i cant believe they saying this with a straight face.
For 6 million, do Mee goreng
Uncle roger is having flashbacks of him and Auntie Esther.😂
Uncle roger should make Butter chicken when he reaches 6 million!
This one is delicious tho
I never tried frozen dump-I mean frozen sandwiches before
Like how Uncle Roger roasts Din Tai Fung quite a bit for their expensive price on Xiaolongbao. It's true though since 6 of Din Tai Fung's pork Xiaolongbao here can cost about 16MYR
Maybe he can go to a comedy work shop.
As a white person I have to say... Truffle is overrated.
Omg that's a lot of msg..
2:20 why does he look like asian version of Elon Musk
so when can we buy this special Uncle Roger batch
If you dont have a bamboo steamer, you can just line a plate with lettuce/cabbage leaves, place the dumpling on top, use a round or appropriately shaped wire rack in a deep pan, fill the pan with water and steam it that way. Just make sure you dont burn your hands getting it out ;)
😆😆😆nephew Caleb did his uncle Roger homework..cut him off at every innuendo 😆
Don’t waste food, Haifa! Just kidding
Uncle roger looking sus
you forgot to bring someone
9:33 that's Amber Heard reference
@7:16 I like truffle 👍
Nephew Caleb looked so disappointed when Uncle Roger dumped that bag of MSG in
Nephew roger :)
Dumplings is good for me I eat it every morning
Jesus, I want to eat all of that up... The dumplings too!
Scarlett Johansson first and now, Amber Heard... 😂
Yo he kinda look like an Asian Elon musk
I love ding thai fung I’ve been to the one in Taiwan and the one in California
Im white but i have never tried truffel.
Caleb looks like the Asian version of Elon Musk 😂
Uncle Roger, are you Team JD or AH? Just curious.
I’m white and I have wood steamer !!! I’m only niece I know who have it!!
caleeb lookin like dollar store elon musk
Caleb looks like Asian Elon Musk ! haha
"This is vegan's worst nightmare ... *flavour* " 😭
The outro so great, I hope uncle roger will make more outro like that 😂
lov how he goes Scarface with the MSG.. also me cringing all that wasted meat
“It’s a vegans worst nightmare…Flavor.” Had me crying lmao 😂
Not the DUMPLING FACTORY 😨
Jamie Oliver can’t get a break 🤣🤣🤣
Bout a year ago I decided to make my own home made tonkostu ramen from pork bones. I was rushed so I had to boil for 10 hours instead of 12 and due to my time crunch I had to add my aromatics in early. It was good but not restaurant good, for the tare I used mirin soy sauce and sesame oil wich was a mistake next time ima make a miso tare so I can make miso tonkostu ( that's my favorite kind ) 2 weeks ago for my 14th birthday I made my own coconut chicken curry for dinner, the only thing I wish I could do better about is get actual red chili powder, I can not find actual red chili powder so I use a 1/1 ratio of paprika for color and cayenne for heat. Just thought I would share this with you
Love how he said the machine has a safety mechanism that won’t let it run with the lid open then next shot the machine is running with the lid open while they add seasoning
this guy looks like asian elon musk
I think those dumplings need some apologies and respect from uncle roger
Man literally looks like Elon Musk...😅
Human meat actually taste like beef meat mix with goat meat and grill
good for you Uncle Roger!
I lost that Amber lawyer jokes hahahahaha
The batch that uncle Roger was making will have the best flavor in the world  .... The amount ot msg  he put there 😂
Reason I never eat Dumpling outside 💵 My minimum capacity is 20+😀 So I have to Cook. 😂
“This machine is working harder than Amber Heard‘s lawyer” 🤣😂🤣💯
so meat spin- my eyessss needdd help!!!
"bats", now the commies are coming, brace yourselves.
= }
Shalaong baw
4:27 Food waste is not funny.
"This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer" 🤣🤣
"Human fingers adds flavor"- meat packing owners trying to prevent the formation of the FDA
Nephew Caleb no love Canada. Ayah :(
"Is a dumpling a sandwich" needs to be debated at length.
BROOO I SWEAR MAN LOOKS LIEK DUMPLING ELON
Why he waste all that MSG and meat. Haiyaaa!
Soup dumplings are delicious 🔥🔥🔥
Why is it OK for him to use "white people" but if someone says "yellow" "slant" "mini-penis" all hell would break loose?
You spin me right round baby right round.....
1:01 sounds like ... uhhhhh it's so hurt
4:35 bro wtf
So....do we fondle the dumplings before steaming or before eating?
I watched this and now am off to the Asian market to get some. Who says advertising doesn't work? See ya later!
2:40 that cut real deep. I did not need that before going to bed
Just hit like lol
I wonder just how much meat got wasted with that MSG stunt.
Okay. Its time for Uncle Roger to make a series going around to meet chefs at their restaurant and then factories that make increible food as well.
Starting to stretch that idea pretty thin man
theyre in Seattle!? Then why i have not caught them on shelves at asian markets in western Washington!?
Celeb was not impressed when uncle Roger thrown and then playing with the dumplings. 🤣
Classic "meat spin"
I am a small nephew and idk what is a meat spin
Hope you ate that batch w extra msg.
It's hilarious to see some frozen food factory claims their product is better than Din Tai Fung. Love to see what's their edge.
"This machine works harder than Amber Heard's lawyer!" LOL
-metions meat spin **war flashbacks to those distressing days as an 11 year old in primary school accompanied by air raid sounds**
Are they shipping world wide?
Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐) has the best soup dumblings (小籠包) in the world and nothing can beat it. Taiwanese pride. but the soup dumplings in the video looks good too
Nephew Caleb kinda like asian elon musk
Well today I learned about meatspin 189 times.
要被小粉红出征了
楽しい動画をいつもありがとう。日本のファンより
I liked your little labor organizing speech no workers =no product =more 💰
Uncle Roger visit Binley Mega Chippy
"The machine works harder than amber lawyer" 😭😂
Cocaine hand 🤚
When can I get these in Belgium?
“This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer”……..I SCREAMED!!!
boy I havent heard anyone mention meatspin in 15 years, hell of a throwback
Caleb reminds me of Elon musk
It looks no soup inside.. So dry like uncle Roger
Uncle roger is allergic to food that doesn’t have MSG 😂
angry Asian：Don't play with FOOD!!!!!!!!!
Mo:Mo
Pls review Cook with Lau Cantonese dishes.
Uncle Roger good at fondling dumplings be safe Nigel😭
This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer.
I know is a character, but this time he crossed too many lines, you can almost see the amger of the humble owner, feel sad for him, very bad.
Jamie Oliver dumpling is mange tout, olive oil, crab and acorns
At this point, Jamie's just uncle Rogers plaything😂
I wonder what Uncle Roger will say to using the stainless steel steamer instead of the bamboo.
Awesome vid! Very funny 😄
If you want forget your ex-girlfriend, buy uncle Roger's extra lavor dumpling, you will forget your girlfriends immediately, also your family and yourself :))))))))))
Omg no more plandemics. We can't deal with these corrupt fools rigging elections in America.
I Google meatspin
*Uncle roger yelling at a driver* ”Haiya who is that person?” ”That is my wife.” ”Oops, somebody dumpling not getting fundle tonight.”  💀
Doesn't U.K means United Killers?
Machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer😂😂😂😂😂
I really like din Tai Fung though lol
Well went ahead and placed an order for these and going to give them a try.  Its too bad though that the shrimp ones arent an option in the big bundle.
We'r in Ibiza!!! Lol
3:46 thank you uncle roger for making me curious until I couldn't sleep . at first I couldn't sleep because I wanted to know but after I found out I couldn't sleep at all
1:33 that autotune tho
Xiaolongbao making machine is so cool tho
4:00 -- I never thought I'd want a collab of Uncle Roger and Law-picking Lawyer in my life, but here we are.
i was not ready for the meatspin lol
This white person uses a disposable pie pan with holes in it. It works!
the fda to lazy to make a new category so they just throw it in with the sandwiches XD
Y this nephew look like Asian Elon musk. Y. who gave him birth 😂😂
Rofl meatspin legend.
That corona joke hit me 🤣
Never miss a chance to roast jamie olive oil single time..  I like that
Immediately googled Meat Spin 😂😂😂
More vijeo! Keep it up, Uncle Roger!
Was thinking Uncle Roger spared Jamie Oliver for this one video. Didn't saw it coming
Why did I read that as dumping factory 😩
They should sell those dumplings in Europe as well. I wanted to order but only shipping to US and Southern French Territories for some reason ?!
nephew aleb fondle uncle  dumpling to make him stop putting msg
yo din tai fung delicious
not to be snobby but from what the camera is picking up, the skin is way too thick. and i am sure its has to do with it being a frozen product to prevent the skin from cracking under pressure when frozen. but yeah no where near legit ding tai fung standards. as cory lee, chef of benu says, if you steam your dumpling and the skin doesnt drape and form a "feet", its too thick
I want to order so bad but I live in Alabama and the delivery cost is at minimum $99. 😭😭😭😭😭
come to nepal eat 10 momos(dumplings) in like 80 cents
US only ? Haiyaaa... i want dumplings in germany too :(
Somebody dumpling not getting fondle tonight - uncle Roger 2022
The vibe is embarrassing, the CEO seems fed up with your joke
Please dont waste meat like that man...
COVID is proof the FDA have no idea what they’re doing
The machines work harder than Amber Heard lawyers 🤣
Elon musk:"asia can't copy tesla" Asia:*copies musk himself and names him caleb*

"why do the people u luv leave u " Me : don't know but happened to me many times haiyah
Lol
Potato
I doubt they will be good. They didn’t have cooled down actual soup.
he looks like asian elon musk
Dumplings are made by Uncle Roger.  White costumer's POV: This dumplings are so flavourful. After 15 minutes: R.I.P. he died from white powder.
Hit like now if you like truffle - nice try uncle Roger getting Jaime Olive oil to like your video
Haram haram hehe

Time to get real! I love Uncle Roger existentially.

Will buy few bags ! And wooden steamer ! What is the best wok to use ?
OMG!😳 This may sound weird, but does anyone else think Uncle Roger's thumbnail kinda makes him resemble Elon M?!🥴  Sorry, Uncle Roger, no disrespect intended...🙏🏻😓😬
You can definitely tell the guy is not enjoying this😂😂😂
Damn the tour guide was funnier in this show LOL.
Send to Asia ?
china people think uncle roger 辱华😂
I googled meatspin....
Soup dumpling with mange tout hahaha, so funny, thanks for the long awaited comedy!
Oh😬
I laughed so hard I choked when Uncle started dumping MSG
5:39  I disagree, she worked really hard for Johnny Depp to win the case.
“We’ve been married for eight years of course not" I felt that🤣🤣
Gol D Roger
lol the amount of haters really putting botted comments on this video is insane
🤣
This machine working harder than AMBER HEARD LAWYER... killed me
Google Meat Spin 💀 bruh a person literally getting miced
"This is vegans worst nightmare. Flavor" 😂😂🤣🤣

Lol. Caleb’s like geez you just ruined my meat…

I love Japanese dumpling if you know what i mean🥵
Bro they really let hit fuck that shit up with that msg 💀
Nicee another Uncle Roger weedioo 🔥🔥
Nephew caleb do you ship internationally?
This machine  works hard than ember heard lawyer  🤣🤣🤣
Meatspin is definitely something which every mom warns not to
How much msg was that, not complaining though,
As a white guy in my 40's I can say I've never had a truffle before. Don't know what they look like, smell like, or taste like. Guess I'm failing my race.
you really had to ruin a whole cow worth of ground meat to make a lame msg joke
You are a genius at roasting people. Great video as always!
4:38 i think that too much MSG💀
Wow.. 15$ for three dumplings.. that's a bit extreme! FYI, Dear Uncle, white people do have a bamboo steamer😉
Can't get them in Canada haiyaa 😭
Trust me niece and nephew, do not Google meat spin. Thank me now
imagine the workers accidentally put the uncle roger's demo dumplings with tons of msg in the package🤣🤣🤣🤣
" This machine working harder  than Amber Heard Lawyer " 😂😂😂 God Damnnn
Is it me is Uncle Roger getting hornier and hornier in every subsequent video he posts? lol
4:37 OMG MSG
"Uncle Roger Need More" = Half Packet🤣
3:47 I FUCKING REGRET MY DECISION
Anyone who eat uncle roger dumplings are gonna get bald
Not a dumpling but Kroger and Ingles has a really good pork shrimp and leek dumpling that is really good in the frozen section
I am indeed a white person who loves truffle
So true about truffle! 🤣
**THIS MACHINE WORKING HARDER THAN AMBER HEARD LAWYER** 😂😂😂😂😂😂
“This machine working harder than Amber Heard lawyer.” - that got a chuckle out of me
dumping with msg FUIYOH
dude looked kinda pissed whe you put th whole  sack of msg HAHAHAHAHA
虽然这是恰饭，但是这个小笼包看起来不好吃诶，皮看起来很厚的样子。
uncle Is that what they call it "cultural appropriation" Oke 🤣ill tell that to my girl...or we just trying to make everybody color beige 🤣🖤.
dont worry your wish is granted. someone apparently ate some monkeys at europe.
Soup dumpling 小笼包 is one of the dish that I often will order when I am in dim sum restaurant
Yes
Hope this goes international always wanted to try xiao long bao but small municipality in southern canada that can't drive means I am limited to the restaurants around me.
IF A HOTDOG IS NOT SANDWICH A DUMPLING IS OBVIOUSLY MORE ON NOT ON THE SANDWICH SIDE HAYAHHH FDA
tell me the chef doesn't look like elon musk but asian.
Uncle Roger, as a white guy who prior to meeting the missus(who grew up eating authentic Thai, vietnamese and Japanese) could have been a poster boy for not being able to handle spicy.. And after finding you.. I started pushing myself to cook as authentic Asian cuisine as possible.. And today I actually succeeded to impress an older Thai lady with my pork green curry.. I thank you for your humor and pushing me to perfect it! ;)
How is no one talking about the giant bag of msg he put in the meat? 🤣🤣 like hello cholesterols
This is the worst video I could have watched. I'm never going to financially recover from this. I'm literally obsessed with dumplings. 🤣😭🥲 *help me*  I guess I also learned today that sandwiches are apparently my favorite food... 🤔
I think I’ve found the solution for my bf’s dumpling cravings. Local dumpling place closed during - yes- the pandemic.
“Second best discovery aunty ester better” uncle roger
2:27 the man’s face in the background LMFOSJS
The lawyer joke came so fast out of nowhere 😂😂😂
I googled meat spin 💀
I regret looking at meatspin
“Uncle roger favourite Asian actress Scarlett Johansson”😭😭😭
2:37 out of all the jokes, this one hits hard lmao uncle roger you win this time 😂
660th comment
"go Google meatspin" Uncle Roger is a great role model
I've seen tons of ads for these dumplings by now. Seems a little expensive for me at the moment, but wow what a good win for the brand to get Uncle Roger to come pay a visit. Very cool!
最好吃的小笼包是无锡小笼包，甜的
xiao long bao is definitely my favourite dim sum.. juicy and full of flavour inside a bun .. a bun of flavours
I want a link to the extra msg-dumplings. where can i order them?
Ooooooo
Haha yummeh
i googled meat spin lol
So week!
"The machine working harder than Amber Heard's lawyer" I lost it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ahhhhh Dumplings ! Love them 👍
Uncle Roger jumped into my pocket and got me to spend $134 with this weejio🤷
i still dont get why he does that to his head everytime he said the word "white people"
02:30 he just made a white supremacy joke.. u dumb white power into machine XD
Wish you did not make Covid Chinese jokes. We don't really know how Covid started. Asians are being lumped together
is the chicken dumpling halal?
Kung-fu panda 3 was better but this remaster is still good
Uncle Roger should do dumpling cooking weejios.
What an old call back to "Meat Spin" Trolling XD
Damn my man called out din tai fung
I googlet it. Can't unseen.
This machine works harder than amber heards lawyer lmao
Uncle Roger love soup dumpling and I love Uncle Roger.  Hey but I am not gay
I know I'm too optimistic. But : is it available in France... ? 🥺
In one video he says he has learned how to balance msg then the hole bag goes in
5:38 emotional damge
actualy theres plenty of msg naturaly occuring in truffles.
MSG, the better funny white powder
HAIYAA! UNCLE ROGER LOVE SOUP DUMPLING MORE THAN MSG?
uncle Caleb has better English than me for christ's sake!!!
Amazing as always uncle Roger keep up the good work and I hope you have a great day and your videos never fails to entertain us and dumplings looks so good but I can't eat it because I am Muslim but i wanna try msg
Meatspin. No wonder your wife left you
i looked up meat spin and im now weirded out XD
3:50 my eyes need exorcism after what I just saw
Tak baik tau Uncle Roger main baling-baling makanan
“This machine work harder than Amber Heard lawyer “ 💀
Uncle Roger I'm from Taiwan,鼎泰豐 isn't really what we have everyday,I admit 鼎泰豐 is expensive. In Taiwan,we got many restaurants & Street food test better with reasonable price.
5:38 The machine works harder than Amber Heards lawyer😂🤣
I'd try those dumplings and I bet they taste pretty good....but those are definitely western knockoff xiaolongbao. Xlb has to have that deflated look to them with the flat bottom where all the melted soup settles....oh they're so damn good.
MMMMMMmmmm I love these dumplings! And then "Working harder than Amber Heard's Lawyer" - 😂😂😂
huh
doesn't the ceo look like the asian version of elon musk?
a
is it me or does uncle roger looks like gen hoshino
My Siri went off when he said “hey Siri” in the outtakes 😂😂
Can’t tell if you a simp…. Or the one being simp… ima go buy one bag later today
"Machine working harder than Amber Heard Lawyer" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The amount of MSG he put😲
I hope that batch of meat/dumplings isn't wasted.😔50 Dumplings for $39.99 with a discount it's $36. That's .72 cents per dumpling. Not bad but still I feel better supporting dumpling shops. Me in the states: This is affordable. Me in Asia: TF Skip, I'm paying extra for freshly made.
The guy next to you looked so bewildered by your preference of fondling them lol
LOVE THE VID
Heck yeah another upload! Almost 6 million subscribers :) Early grats!!
His face in the thumbnail
i just wanna know if the vegetables taste like sand line is uncle roger being serious or just jokin  i cant tell sometimes XD
bat interesting
An Uncle Roger vidyeow without a Kpop reference?
Caleb didn't know what he got himself into
uncle roger's reaction to dumpling being classified as a sandwich
so u wasted so that much msg just for the video?
Yum
Uncle Roger please come to Brazil ❤️ I can make you fried rice if you'd like! Promise you I'm better than Jamie Olive oil
I can’t be the only one to think that Caleb looks like an Asian Elon musk? Lmao
Uncle Roger:- go google meat spin  (No don't actually google it)   Me:- I think I have to do it now
hai
MSG is a toxin that is cancerous
5:36 - 5:40 AGREED.
Fuiyoh Uncle Roger upload video from 36 min again
u r my fav youtuber without using any bad language
Ok really DON'T Google meat spin...
Watching this I JUST remembered that there is a place near me called dumpling brothers    You know what I’m doing after this video…
Uncle Roger just introduced the new generation to the glory that is MeatSpin.
that amount of msg is gonna get somebody killed
Auntie Helen regret dumpling Uncle Roger
How goes Uncle always manage to bring his dirty wit to the guest😄😄
with the rising   wheat flour prices  at some point cocain will be cheaper
鼎泰豐's egg fried rice is good
Love you but I think you should be more careful when you go to more factorys in the future . You need to wear and change gloves everytime you touch the ingredients and the machine . It's make the factory you shooting with look irresponsible to let you play unsanitary and wasting ingredients cuz you cant sell that been touched .
OMG uncle Roger trick me into searching meatspin
Amazing tour! Hope we have one in Malaysia too. Those dumplings in dimsum shops are too expensive!
Thank you Uncle Roger for the Meat spin.  That's my best search today..
I just recently got round to exploring the Asian supermarket near where I live. It had rice cookers, massive woks, bamboo steamers, massive rice bags, all the weirdest drinks I’ve ever seen but no MSG. It was so close to perfect
For lazy but still wondering people, I googled "meat spin" its gorgeous. Worth to watch it yourself. Thanks uncle roger.
That CEO is the best sport ever.
he never misses his chances with olive oil
Uncle Roger seems to have upped the "risqué rating" Good stuff 👍
lmao when you dumped all the msg in there I was dying laughing
Auntie Esther is like MSG, she the QUEEN of flavor 😏
Had a nice laugh, as always. Thank you, Uncle Roger 🤣🤣👍👍😂😂👌👌
Nigga snorted flour
559th comment
HALA MADRID
Somebody dumpling not getting fondled tonight. Lmaooooooooooooooooo
For the longest time I thought Xiao Long Bao (小笼包) meant Small Dragon Buns but the character for Long apparently has 2 meanings & in this instance meant Basket coz that's how they're made haha. Time to refresh my mandarin.
He just watched him pour that msg in 😂
Damn are they gonna ship internationally? Can't wait!!!
Uncle roger has a weird obsession with finger and machine
鼎泰豐很好吃 但是基本上味道跟其他店的沒什麼不同 唯一的不同就是特別貴
He actually throw half bag of MSG in there🤣
i ate dumplings just now
He poured too much msg
4:41 (The CEO looking at his dumpling filling overfilled with MSG *cries inside*)
How much did you have to pay for destroying the batch of meat?
omg ms sakura johnson is the best asian actress 😌💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽
Come to Taiwan and eat Din Tai Fung. you will jizz in your pants
哈哈~~怎麼可能比鼎泰豐好吃啦~~笑死了
Nephew Caleb doesn't look very happy about this
Buff is the most delicious filling for the dumpling.
He lowkey look like asian elon musk
isn't freezing dumplings completely normal? my mom always made batches of hundreds and froze them
Haiyaa! That was so irresponsible! Not the magnet, but that dangerous level of MSG.
This maschine working harder than AMBER HEARD LAWYER  HAHAHA :D on the point ! :D
I’ve been called out as a white guy who likes truffle
Asian Elon musk doesnt exist,he cant hurt u
dont google MEATSPIN i repeat DONT GOOGLE MEATSPIN
My body is ready, let’s eat some 🥟
the owners look when uncle ruined that batch of meat with MSG dump...
uncle roger you throw away good food be careful you parent will smash you 🤣🤣
I guarantee Uncle Roger fucking around with the machines and mixes messed so much up for the consistency of the next batches.  They’re fickle things and someone’s got a lot of work to reset them 😂
Big shout out to Uncle Roger and Caleb for promoting traditional Shanghainese food Xiao long bao, and this product looks really good! I’m Shanghainese and a hardcore xiao long bao fan, this is my 59th day locked at home. this video made me crave for xiao long bao like Uncle Roger with MSG…
I'm white person in uk...i don't like truffles lol
Uncle Roger: No, don’t actually google meat spin Me: Straight away opens a new tab
Yo
Not enough msg
29 minutes and 50k views. Uncle roger has come a long way
I don't wanna know how salty those "MSG Dumplings" are
Hahaha, Vegan’s worst nightmare…. Flavor!
he hates you.
Uncle Roger the Truly Certified Chef who could give Good cooking advice and Make Your Stomach hurt from laughing to his sense of Humour!😂
Hmmm meat spin? 🧐
"So dumplings the FDA classifies them as Sandwich"   Never would I have known that the FDA considers dumplings as sandwich, if it wasn't for this video lol
3:35  I can't believe that made this racist joke. Hope he doesnt get cancelled by twitter.
🤔 the dumblings looks good where can I find this in the US
Well that was *'some'* MSG.
can you go to the sriracha chili factory
that ScarJo joke is totally all over the place lol  PS: Jesus, that's a lot of MSG
"We put the whole world on holiday for two more years"
lol haha nice vid
Should have gone to freshasia factory 😂
This machine working harder than amber Heard lawyer😂
bro 10/10 for whoever did the chinese subs, for the extra flavor part, the chinese sub is “亿点点风味” which means 100 million times the flavor which is also a joke in chinese as “一点点” which means lil extra something and they are pronounced exactly the same so it is a stupid but very FUIYOH joke and another in the driving back home part, the chinese sub says “uncle roger是一个老司机了” which means uncle roger is a skilled driver but also in chinese slangs it means that you are very lewd and weird stuff comes out of your mouth and sentences after that he immediately makes a lewd joke, a perfect subtitle
should caleb get uncle title?
Elaine:Ａｍ　Ｉ　ａ　ｊｏｋｅ　ｔｏ　ｙｏｕ？
Uncle Roger, try Wuxi Xiaolongbao. It uses a lot of soy sauce in the fillings. Tastes sooooo much better.

you can actually get your balls twisted in a knot. and its quite painfull and requires immediate attention. lol.
✨ D U M P L I N G S ✨
It's not that Amber Heard kind of white powder? Shame
Only some minorities people's eat wild animals in China.  Africa and other countries also please stop eating wild animals.
Dumplings is love, dumplings is life <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
that msg waste hurts... no one could possibly eat that dumpling...
Soooooo...that whole batch was just ruined, huh?
"The FDA classified it as a sandwich"  Bro that's like using metal chopsticks, it doesn't makes any sense
"This is vegan's worst nightmare - flavour."  🤣🤣🤣
Nephew Caleb so dead pan and cold haha!
I dont care how many times ive seen it, "Emotional damage" still has me roaring laughing
I love Xiao Long Bao, I always belived Xiao Long Bao is God Of All Dumplings
This is my first time watching  uncle Roger veejio  after he just uploaded it 😀😀
fun fact: Uncle Roger went to a dumpling factory to get over tha fact than Auntie Helen dumped him
4:36 dont know if i should be jealous or worried for the guy who is going to eat this
He still have the time to roast jamie oliveoil🤣
Me: I HAVE TRUFFLE SHOE FOR DINNER White people according to Uncle Roger: is for me?
50 come in a bag, but serving size is 4?   something isn't adding up right.
Is it just me or is caleb too much like an asian elon musk. The way he speaks is just too similar
So I Googled 'Meatspin' and uuhh... Yeah anyways, when people tell you to search up something, never ever do it😂
"We've been married for 8 years of course not" lol
bruh he pour half  sack of msg...I wonder if they actually gonna sell that batch
why does referencing sex triggers the ''sorry children'' but drugs and snorting don't... society😔😔
.
Don't you dare dis Din ta Fung best dumplings ever at the upstairs  original store in Taipei the line was forever but ordering ahead of sitting down was magic once your butt hit the seat a warm towel tea and dumplings.  Great restraint experience, wait with delicious smell, sit eat pay and get out.
Oops somebody dumpling not getting fondle tonight 🤣
Nigel, that CEO looked like he wanted to KILL you when you dumped your precious MSG in the mix! Love it! :)

I do search for meatspin and regret the decision I make🙂🥲 (you're so mean uncle roger)

The last dumpling video he did was good but made a disaster by some angry China people who forced him to apologise over some political thing. If those people do that again, just ignore them or fight back
Lol most of people says Asian eat bats they bought covid-19
This is the comedy I love a little edgy for todays crowd but that what make s it good thanks for allowing us to use a bamboo steamer if I get accused of cultural appropriation I can say uncle roger allowed me.

Uncle Roger poured a shit ton of msg, still less than the amount of times Jamie Oliver fucked up 😬😤
After so many visuals of pounding taken from various angles, fondling is a refreshing sight.
Imma die if I bought the batch Uncle Roger made. That msg will make me go to heaven haiyaaa
Uncle roger
The CEO of dumpling factory feels so awkward, we all could prob tell his face, can tell no like uncle roger stupid dirty jokes!

Uncle Roger is just one of the top creators for food. He mixes comedy with information i just love it, keep up the great work watched you since 200 k ")
"not that type of white powder"  You got me lmao
I didn't expect you to actually put in all of that MSG. :D  I assume you paid for and brought that batch home since they wouldn't be able to sell it?
.........
Uncle roger, what do you think about nasi dagang
I can't believe uncle roger said three Chinese word in a video, this is the moment that i should pray to god to let it happen again.
“We’ve been married for eight years of course not” 💀 the dead pan delivery of that took me out
