It already broke it.
Go home all you FUEL ENGINE drivers with your cars! Your time is over! This record is done without air and noise pollution you loosers!
warum is der start rausgeschnitten?
I'm a petrolhead for sure but if someone would give me one of these set up to daily drive to and from work I would sell my kids......and wife for it🤣
I'm guessing the driver is sandbagging so as not to get the car outright barred for non competitiveness. (Too Fast!)
👎👎🏿👎🏾👎🏼👎🏿👎ELÉCTRIC BOICOT
One minute Later  The battery died 😆
That's gotta be the next Batmobile. PERIOD.
When my brother said the Batmobile broke the Goodwood track record I thought he was pulling my leg, jinkies that car goes fast!!!
The world's fastest road sweeper
The really bad thing about a car like this is that if that suction fan takes a dump when you're in the middle of a 150 mph turn then you are going to be dead.
Like a Batman movie.  Why is it called a fan car?
Why does it produce smoke?
Boring without an engine 🥱
Pikes peak is calling and I must go
Incredible 👍🏻
Real life batmobile.
I love that the design is meant to look like a mirage
That fog behind it makes it look like it's breaking the sound barrier xD 0:21
Lame.  Soy mobile
Yawn.
Why did you cut the start?
That’s why it’s so dadgum quick! It’s a fan car like the old Chaparall 2J!
Real life batmobile
I'm not 100% sure because electric motor noise and straight cut gearbox noise is similar, but I'm guessing this beast is electric? Not gonna lie, I'm super impressed with electric cars, but without noisy exhaust sounds, cars seem like they've lost their soul...
Wondering if this is the same tech that was used in Chapparal from the 70’s and what Gordon Murray is employing in his newest creation.
Because this is a fan car, part of me wonders if this is stooooopid fast because safety was ignored and removed to reduce weight but I doubt the stewards at Goodwood would tolerate that on track, right?
"This reminds me more of a. a. of something like you shoot from a gun-un or from a can-non" I wish someone would shoot me with a gun-un right now who hired this guy
These conmentators are so cringe on every run
Amazing piece of engineering, and brutally fast.  But I'd much prefer to see, (and hear) Justin Laws beautiful Jaguar XJR
it did
I love how the barriers are just bales if they went off track it would be doomed
That’s amazing
Quick question. Once the car runs out of electricity in a long race what happens then? How do you change or charge battery?
This tiny rocket destroy every hypercars !
Damn………..!..!.!.!.!!.!.!!!!!
McMurtry's methods were unconventional. 🤯 I doubted his success. 🧐🤔 This test run made me doubt my view on unconventional solutions. I feel humbled. 🙏
Electric cars are so boring!
Looking at the lines taken there is still more time to be had. As per modern jets it might be the fleshy lump behind the wheel restricting ultimate performance.
Thought they said it was 38 seconds?
Why does it have mirrors on a hill climb?!?!?!
WOW F'N WOW!
The fact that the caption can only support UTF-8 in 2022 is unsettling.
It looks like 'car' from pixar so cute
So this is like an electric ducted fan car?
Can not believe you didn't include the launch. Most incredible part
Why not just use the Bat Mobile in the first place, would have saved you a fortune in R&D … oh erm “hold my hat”
Driving an all-electric car is like watching porn with the sound turned off.
that thing is a blur, probably one of  the wildest rides
I want to see this in Monaco!
40 seconds ....now let's see it do the Indy 500....
Bring it on
You could say I’m a big “fan” of this performance.
Looking forward to when Mat Watson from CARWOW puts this thing up against a drag race!!
RC카가 달리는 느낌이네
I will own one of these soon
tesla need to do some catching up🤣🤣🤣🤣
What amazes me is how a car 23 years ago, that was squirrely and on the edge, was still close to being as fast as this car, which looked as planted as could be, and very smooth. I wonder how a Ferrari 2004 F1 car would get along on this track, or a 2012 Redbull. Though, F1 cars are not really designed for this type of track. Also, if there was someone other than Heidfeld driving the car. He's not exactly the best F1 driver of anyone's lifetime.
blaqk  deker  makita     bosch
Spoiler, ...YES!
Vacuun cleaning the track
Mano do céu 😅
2J reborn
Make a new record...39 20 seconds..the most fastest car in goodwood
That looked so fast
shame  electric cars can not even get half way round a race   and take ages to charge when formula 1 petrol cars just get filled up in seconds with fuel lool .Same as these  so called electric cars that do 170 mpg before a charge but if you carry a horse box or trailer behind your car the mileage goes down to about 98 mpg and are just or more worse for the environment than petrol  i will not own a 60,000 dollar or more electric car and how many normal working class can afford  that amount it is like you could put over a 1/3 of a deposit on a house with that amount of money
That Batmobile is fast AF!
I'm a fan
Hej drive IT in 39,08 so IT is bullshit he do not drive in 41,2🤬😡
Bullshit he beat the time he run under 40 sec
What was the time as the video stops before it’s said
Since when is Batman out of the movie buisness and race?
Very tasteless
the car is 16:9
F1 is faster...
It was so quick that they cut off the commentary while editing this clip.
This car should be in gt7
Only problem is the dreadful whining noise and the fact that it looks like a fridge freezer.
Old timers keep bagging on this car but I think it is cool.  Electric motor driveline with electric fans for downforce.  Talk about pushing the "e" concept to the limit.   Hopefully once the new Formula E cars are out in 2023 they will bring one to Goodwood - probably can't beat this record but I suspect with the big bump in KW......be really quick.
Incredible feat of engineering!
Pikes Peak next for the car? :)
This will age me but seeing that car reminds me of the last car you get in Death Rally on DOS.
You do know its cheating, right? Other cars with vacuum under car were banned, why not this one?
Crazy fast shame there’s no engine note
Get your text formatting right... Donkeys
is the fan to rid of the dead air behind the car?
yes!
Slot car's reach 1000 scale mile and more per hour.
And as a bonus, the course is now free of dust and cigarette butts. Someone's going to have to empty the canister though. Imagine how much cat hair that thing must hold.
if only it had sound
Congratulations to McMurtry Automotive and Sir David McMurtry on their record breaking.  Your new car, the McMurtry Spéirling, is wonderful, surprisingly ultra fast, demonstrating the technological capacity of your company in the development of new electrical technologies, combining the best and most advanced current technologies with those of the past, such as the fan car Brabham Bt46B self-contained fan, designed by Gordon Murray, winner of the 1978 Formula 1 Swedish GP, when the great Niki Lauda won that race at Anderstorp.  With the reasonable dimensions of a Formula 1 car from the 1960s, evidencing that size is part of McMurtry's virtuous circle philosophy.  A small car is a light car, while modest frontal area limits drag.  The slick aerodynamics are helpful for forward motion and speed, which is aided by the low mass.  The fan increases the downforce.  Carbon fiber gives it rigidity, lightness and at the same time safety.  Now, Max Chilton (former Formula 1 driver and current IndyCar driver) made Goodwood history by shattering the circuit record at Goodwood Road & Racing's infamous Festival of Speed.  He did it aboard his McMurtry Spéirling electric car, with a time of 39 "08 for the 1,800 meters of said circuit, breaking the official record set by Nick Heidfield with a Formula 1 McLaren MP4 / 13.  This electric car could also break all existing records, in all the circuits in which it is presented.  The future is electric.
In 5 yrs time, this car won't even be in the top 10.  Can't wait to see the future.
With the downforce it’s generating it could be driven upside down. Red bull, we are waiting
The world needs more fan cars
I came from the future to tell you, yes it can.
Dream job
Wait, fan cars were banned, or only was it the Chaparral 2J??
gotta new name for that driver MAD MAX.
Max Chilton set the new record on Sunday at 39.08.  It's insane.  Reminds me of old films where the speed the frame rate up for "effect", only this is actually genuine real-time.  Bonkers!
Ain't no Hay bale stopping that... you've played scalextric right? 🤦
It can go faster
Style and speed!
One fast Hoover
After 60+ years of watching motor sport, what a privilege to see this run, it defies the laws of physics. The most enjoyable motor sport weekend  I have ever witnessed.
ok. build ten more and make it a series!!!! please.
Electric cars excel at hill climbing.  Torque on demand regardless of the RPM and altitude does not affect them.
LoL 😄  look's like a 2x speed video 🤯 Hilarious 🥳😁 Congratulations 👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻
Chapparal when 3J
One of the most amazing things I've seen!
1000bhp!!!!!!!
Doesn't show us the angle from behind it as it took of. I've never seen anything like it
Just broke the record. 39.08
And he took another two seconds off that today🤯
Update : Yes it did
what a car , I can only capair the launch to a rocket. no,1 at goodwood
Aaaand he did it
It got the record, what an amazing machine
That was unbelievable! 39.1!!! Incredible!!!
As incredibly complex as ICE cars may be, electric cars are eventually going to be much faster. It definitely would be interesting to see how electric motorsports is doing in 10 years
It beat the record today 39.14 sec I believe
It looks sped up😖
Can't these cars go any quicker? Slower than a hedgehog on holidays.
With cars like this idk why they don't let modern f1 cars do this
It did brake the record it got 39.14 today this is history
I thoroughly believe this could take the record today
That’s was incredible. Looked ballistically fast up the hill!
Commentary and cameras couldn’t really keep Up lol
does anyone know the price range of one of these ???
Modern F1 should take the record easily.
what an awesome design :)
The 3' tall driver in a mini Batman suit was the finishing touch.
Just did a  39.1 second lap time!
Parece o Batmóvel, como não seria rápido? Hahaha
I like the design of  this one, really has something to it.
It looks like a car you’d see in a shitpost
What's the name of this car?
Not the same without the sound of an internal combustion engine is it?
Why car look squish      It shall be named Narrow arrow
But still slower than idr lol 😂
This did a 40 flat this Saturday in qualifying for todays hill climb… record be gone
Fabulous slot car!
Seems to me unstable.
Wow, I have a strange feeling that even Max Chilton inside the car was going 'Man, this is fast!'
Batmobile moment 💀💀💀💀🤙
Fast cars usually look slow on camera, but JFC this looked freaking ballistic!
Truly incredible, but the video missed the insane start launch which looked like a camera trick or optical illusion.!!! Even more so than the run.
Excellent! So very reminiscent of the original bat mobile and it flying through the forests in the Batman movie (Keaton+Nicholson+Bassinger)
What a car  Any build info anywhere?
Don't forget to not crash after the finishing line
Man, his flux capacitor must’ve been broken, he was definitely going more than 88 miles per hour…
😮
It looks like a big helmet resting on a racecar once I realized it I can't unsee it
Genuinely looks like an upscaled Hot Wheels car! xD
I like RC cars, I see an RC scale 1/1, I click the like button.
One word.. 'Cool'
Electric fan???
Let's see it run Pikes Peak now...
Wow! Thats thing looks alive! Go Max!
So add matte black and it's TB's version of the Batmobile
This thing is like an Exocet missile 😳 What an absolute weapon! 😍
when batman is invited to Goodwood FOS
Ev + fan 👍🍌👍
It's like the video is running in fast forward ⏭️  😳  🤣
I dont like it! It's a death trap waiting to happen. Any wreck it has at those speeds driver would be critically injured no doubt
This is the first time I’ve actually gotten any excitement out of an electric car hahaha
Need wide lenses 😂
So why do they have the wing on the back? When they released the car, they stated it didn't need a wing because of the fans.....
Looks jet powered
looks like an RC car
It’s gonna do it. 38.65. As much as I’m refusing electric cars this makes me wanna build one.
You wanna hear motor that's racing
What is this I never seen such races 😫
This whole time, I thought it was a car that a fan of Goodwood created.
that thing reminds me of general grievous’ ship
this thing is mental
Just wish he put that effort into his Indycar career…
it went around the bends like a video game.. Lol. epic!
why it does it move and look like an rc car on track
why electric car had smokes from the exhaust
Bring the w10
90% Batmobile
Still a whopping 1.3 sec behind the VW ID-R but impressive nonetheless.
If Michael Keaton was the driver I wouldn't literally Bat an eyelid.....that was the Batmobile with a Battery 🔋🤪.... awesome thing.....
Batman car 🚀
Holy cræp his fast!
This thing needs a race league of it's own
I was watching this today on the hill, the video doesn’t do it any justice
Done a 40 second flat today (Saturday) so very close to the record can see it being beaten tomorrow 💪
Fun it made fun of super cars.
am i the only one with the batman vibes?
Unreal looking!!
Faster than F1 in acceleration phase and slow speed corners at Silverstone.
It's interesting how much that car resembles the giant wing batmobile!
Should be a separate record for an EV
one might say. it scoots
For an electric car it even sounds pretty cool!
It's as fast as it is ugly
If its electric whats all that smoke coming out the back. I don't think it road dust. It might be dust from the armature brushes burning up with all those amps going through them.
What is this car
It did a 40 second run on the Saturday  Edit: This video also does no justice for just how insanely quick this thing is. The whole crowd gasped and laughed and clapped during its 40s run.
The mere fact that they are using fans for down force is pure genius! Who needs a spoiler when you get 1000lbs of instant down force which means massive tire grip right from the line with no drag loss. Perfect!
goofy ahh car
This is literally a FSAE car with a shell. Love it.
There was no rule saying that Batman couldn't enter his car.
Not that fast. The Amazon man drives up our hill faster than that in a Transit.
Electric cars will be the death of Motorsports. Without the engine sound they will just be seen by the younger generation as things of pure utility. No different than a toaster or a microwave oven. The younger generation won't see any point to Motorsports.
over a second quicker today with the amateur hillclimber driving
It ran just over 40s today. I'm sure with some adjustments and tweek to driving lines then it could better the 39.9 record
I was there Thursday and saw this thing, but didn't realise what it was. It was THE fastest land based vehicle I have ever seen in my life! Great show BTW. So much to see.
Modern luddites will say the vacuum cleaner jokes.  The ONLY issue needing solved, is all the flying debris.... Have you considered a fan above each wheel, pushing the car downward, and 4x4, instead of a vacuum effect, for downforce? 🤔 I understand the vacuum surely uses less energy.
Mega fast, super agile, compact size. When does the racing series start?
The future in front of us, Imagine races in 200 years when there won't be a single drop of oil left on planet earth
Made my neck muscles ache just watching it . . .
Looks like it's made just to that course
0-100 metres in 3.6 seconds O___O I saw it on the Start line on Thursday and you could easily hear the suction fan powering-up to its operating speed before the car just launched, seamlessly and utterly without drama, to become Suddenly Over There. Amazing.
THAT CAR IS PERFECT BALANCE OMG
As much as some car fans hate electric cars, they are the bright future of the automobile world.
Jeeeeez, dude.  Drivers are going to need G-Suits to stay conscious soon! lol
That car is stuck on the road like a slot car.
who had the idea to take hay balls as walls at such an event in 2022
That was exciting to watch..  loved the commentator calling that vehicle a weapon..
Impresssive but it's  electric.... Goodwood is for IC engined cars...
Well that's pretty compelling.  Petrol heads can nitpick all they like, but its still early days for EVs.  They (or maybe hybrid) are clearly going to dominate this kind of event very soon.  Forget about trying to develop ICE to keep up, its going to be a futile waste of time and money.
Um wow.
Looks like a velomobile with a powerful electric motor. It's so cool ^^
😱🤯
The performance is undoubtedly amazing but I will always prefer to hear an engine singing.
It was pretty insane today in quali
It looks like a batmobile
I'm going to start saving my money to buy this rocket 😳🚀🚀🚀🚀
Similar a los autos de la serie Meteoro
This is what formula e should be
I dont give a f. Its not car.
The way it set off at the start was literally a blink and you'll miss it moment! Just show this to all the electric power detractors and try getting them to convince us this isn't the future!
Looks rather incomplete without the bat logo.
electric garbage
To the WEC with this car
Is this car this narrow or its just a effect of the recording?
So the car is 1.3 seconds from the IDR with chilton driving it, put a decent driver behind the wheel and it breaks the record then
But where do I put my golf  ⛳  clubs?
What is the smoke coming from the rear ?
Electric car is a hyperfast It what the great craziest a car your very more breaking in the speeds run to over for blasts unlike F1 car
Batmobile
yes, this car can beat the ID.R, so much grip mate, that car is revolution
They cut it off at the end, it's almost like nobody wants to talk about the fact that electric cars are going to replace almost every combustion engine there.
That is a fast Dyson.
Getting closer, 40.05 today, that start by Summers looked VIOLENT.
Can anyone please explain "electric fan car"?  Is this simply an electric car - like a smaller, lighter, race car version of a Tesla?  Or is there a fan involved?  Could this become street legal?  Or does it have a maximum accommodation of one short person who only weighs 130 pounds?
The car is weirdly narrow for this style of car.
can we get W10 time attack the hill too?! pretty please
EV's continue their run destroying all ICE vehicle records.
Now that's what I call a pocket rocket..
this ain't a racecar, its the batmobile
its super fast, but so boring to watch with no engine noise
And they still don’t allow f1 cars on time trials…
ngl as though i am not the biggest fan of ev's, i genuinely hope this car would inspire(?) other car brands to make smaller cars.
hows f1 too dangerous...
DAMN! That is a WEAPON!
Batmobile
A friend of mine helped build that car
Sounds crap
If electric cars sounded like this more often, I’d enjoy them a whole lot more
How many g in the corner?
Electric powered cars are amazing. Imagine when they can eliminate the batteries and run on capacitors or dilithium crystals..
Watched the run yesterday as it happened, blew EVERYTHING into the weeds, absolutely mind bending up the hill, an incredible thing to witness. Made the trip worthwhile on its own!
Chilton was never quick in f1 or indycar let him have his 40 seconds of fame
amongus car
Didn't Richard Hammond crash one of those? If not, well, then you can't really claim to have something until he has; give him a run at the hill in it!
GR&R - PLEASE stop cutting off the timing information!!! Why do you do that??!!!! Make it super clear please, we love it.
Average 130!?
I dont care how fast and how advanced EVs get I will always be on the side of internal combustion 💥💥💥
I love this little batmobile race car.
Batmobile
Batman's next car. I'd like to see it in the next film with Robert Pattison
Caracture batmobile 😂
racing is not about speed. it is about winning.
Smol
😮
From TECH RADAR article: McMurtry Spéirling is a speed fiend  McMurtry Spéirling, which can rev up 0-60mph in under 1.5 seconds, has been upgraded in term's of aerodynamic performance to deliver 2000kg of instant downforce (available from 0 mph) --- This is more downforce than an F1 car up to 150mph. The car’s powerful electric motors are backed by a 60kWh battery pack using cutting edge Molicel cells, and at under 1,000kg its acceleration figures are remarkable. It can reach a top speed of 150mph, which is capped due to hillclimb gearbox selection. The battery's impressive energy density contributes to over 30 mins of track running range.   The Spéirling’s strength is its fan-powered downforce producing more than double its own weight in downforce which, unlike conventional vehicles, is available at all speeds as it does not rely on airflow over the car. The instant downforce allows the instant torque from the drive motors to be fully deployed. By the way, a fan car has twin fans evacuating air from under it.  The car's other details include: twin motors, rear wheel drive, under 1000kg vehicle weight, Carbon fibre monocoque, single seat, and closed cockpit layout.  New era of electric track capability Formula 1, Le Mans and IndyCar driver Max Chilton and British hillclimb championship leader Alex Summers will be the ones driving the McMurtry Spéirling.  McMurtry, in a statement, said, the secret to the performance of the Spéirling is its ‘clean sheet’ design. "Sir David (McMurtry) tasked the team with reimagining what a car should look like in the 21st century, starting from first principles rather than following the standard process of evolving what had come before. The result is a fully-electric, compact vehicle designed around the twin goals of driver engagement and vehicle performance."   The purpose of the Spéirling is to herald a new era of electric track capability, hasten wider EV development and showcase McMurtry Automotive as EV innovators for road and track cars, it added.
bro they put f1 2021 on 5x downforce
Any one else thinking BatMobile
It looks comically smooshed…and fast
Il a mis un aspirateur ventilateur pour augmenter l'effet de sol et avoir une adhérence hors pair par rapport aux autres véhicules. Obligé vu la fumée qui se dégage derrière son véhicule.
how could you miss the end off... 6 seconds....... faster?  ha
WOW!
thumbnail is cursed
When this thing was unveiled, I thought this was a joke.
Wow, it leaves vapour trail like a jet - must be near the sound barrier in speed! 😱
OMG he want so fast for 30 seconds.... Lets watch a 24hour Le Mans race.
Sad that I can be bored of such a fast car 😑
Silly place to cut the video off. Six seconds fa...ster? Than what? My grandmothers electric scooter? Disclaimer; I do not have a grandmother.
bit over a second of the dack dack's lap record!
Looks retro bull menacing 👍
Jeeee sus Whept!
Wow, what an amazing car. Unreal what technology can do
Wow that looks insane!
and then we have Formula E.....:l
That's quick!! But still choose the Aston Martin Valkyrie over this
Top Gun on wheels
yaawnnnn
at the top of the hill, the LI battery suddenly burst into flame, killing the vehicle, the driver, the drone and several spectators
Awesome..
prolly faster than the marussia he drover before
This is what Formula E Cars want to be
People talk about f1 cars for the road. But that comes with a lot of compromise. This is more like an LMP1 car for the road
Flash (DC) : 😱 Sonic :😳 Whaaaaaaaaaat !!!!!!!!! Speedy Gonzales :🐭 Ay Caramba !! Road Runner : Meep Meep ?!
I'm not easily impressed by a new car - seen lots and lots of all sorts over many years as a marshal.  This however, was different.  Wow, just wow!
At first i thought the thumbnail is fake but now......
The Batmobile
y'know i cant believe it sometimes,back then ev's were the butt of jokes,being considered slow and patetic. time flies
It's a fan car, so it has fans sucking it down. That's why it is so fast. And why it blows so much dust
This little vehicle was incredibly entertaining to watch...I might not understand the visual physics why it looked so otherworldly quick...but it seemed very planted and almost as if the film was sped up...very cool. Must've felt surreal driving  it.
Gordon Murray would be seriously impressed. This is way faster than anything I've seen yet. What was the record?
Very impressive, specialized vehicle
Looks like a CARS movie character.
car looks like a car from car town if anyone did play that in facebook
WOW ! Now, THAT was QUICK ! ... like a flash of lightning ! Somebody unleash it on a proper racing circuit ! Can it do a full lap of silverstone pls  ?
This is how the mercedes project 1 should have me feeling.
this is definitely batman's car when he has some money to buy his own car instead of building it!
"When I came under the bridge and saw fans the other side of the bales drinking champagne I backed off a bit. There is definitely more time in this car." 🤩
GODDAMN!
Rapid, but utterly boring to watch. Now go watch Nick Heidfelds run.
This car looks like it has the real potential to obliterate the record, what a machine talk about on rails fantastic engineering 😃
Electric cars can be blazingly fast- briefly. Greatly enabled by low-end torque and low center of gravity, but limited by battery capacity and resistive heating. Drag race? Short race? Shoo-in. Endurance race? Not a chance. Not anytime soon, anyway.
holy sh**.....!!!....that really is fast.......
that thumbnail's goofy it looks like content aware lmao
Wow. Thats looked spectacular. They should have a racing series for these
Battery issus that never ending, weight and recycle problem, hydrogen is future. Less weight more power and run on multi engine.
Who makes this car. It’s a bullet…
6 seconds fa
Me: aww that's so cute, it will only go 20-30MPH Max Chilton: Hold my Milk  I would love to see how this compares to an F1 car.
Even the camera guy can't keep up
It would probably feel insane inside 🤩
Electric cars are quick, but not for long distance))
Jim Hall was right. Awesome
Recently my local college won third place in the national formula comp, switching to electric next year. The graduate students were right 10 years ago, electric is the future
that thing is pretty stiff, isn't it?
Too slow, jr.
Junk
Where's the timing graphics?
Reminds me of Michael Keaton's Batmobile.
yeah this would dry my laundry very well ...
That's moving at an incredible pace. the speed through the corners is unbelievable. Just planted to the the ground and on it. What a drive !
If can't block has to go against this monster little machine in pikes peak I don't think he can.
Reminded me of watching a bobsled run on tv
and  he's cleaning the  track  ahead  for better rear wheel traction,  the back  looks  like the  roadrunner  cartoon. I think Mario andretti will be filing a protest.
Seems like the start and finish were both cut out. An extra few seconds at either end would have been much better. Any chance of uploading a re-edited version please?
Needs to find 2 seconds.
WAAWAAWEEWAH
haha, that is a rocketship. it almost looks like the video is on 2x faster speed button. amazing.
Wow…an electric car I actually want. It’s flies!
Well done to the team and Max. Takes team effort to get these results, awesome drive.
Let's gooooo. Secure that time,
Wow,  it almost doesn't appear real, but what a difference that fan makes,  absolutely incredible,  thank you for sharing..
it reminded me of manuel dondi in his fiat x19
I absolutely love EVERYTHING about this car and hopefully it succeeds and the company grows
It’s a Mini Hyper Car
Lotus chassis?
Maybe it would have been faster if they turned off the lights.
batmobile
I want one
Faster than the McLaren MP4 with burning hot tires
im getting batmobile vibes from it
This is what happens when someone watched Cars 3 and wanted to make Jackson Storm irl
I'm 50, and have loved exploding liquid dinosaur since I can remember, but the the future is electric. Our grandchildren deserve it.
"SCARY FAST"
I have watched this at least 15 times and it never gets less shocking to see a car with so much power and downforce. that run looked like it had more in it too…nuts
Smokes more than a diesel! 😂
Reminds me of the chaparral 2J from many years ago.  That endless downforce is literally a force to be reckoned with.  Look at your overall time and tell me that full time downforce doesn't work better than any other downforce and........you will realize that you are lying.  Cheers to ANYONE who dares to cheat OR be different enough to find a little more speed out of a setup that everyone else laughed at and then lost to on track.  Cheating?  In racing......that's like breathing. No harm no foul. Don't make excuses.   win........WIN!       WIN!!!!!!
this car looks so unbelievably quick hope we can get a racing series with these, would probably be pretty mega considering how relatively small the car footprint is compared to other race/track cars hope this car is successful either way
Wow!!!!  HE WAS COOKIN WITH GAS IN.....AN ELECTRIC CAR!!!!
in car race, speed without sound is a crime..
6 seconds
It's a weapon!!!
Electric may be fast. Thing is, they are as a exciting as a toaster. And the idiots who want self-driving, they are all ***t's.
This thing has two tons of downforce .... at a standing start and more power to weigh than the ID.R that holds the record. With some development it should be able to smash the record.
It looked like it needed some serious tuning on the suspension so if they did that it would easily shave a bit of time to get the record
The ought to break the IDR’s record, surely
Shid.
Wooow
I would pay ALOT of money to see Hamilton vs Verstappen in these cars around Spa or Silverstone.
If that thing goes off into the hay bails it will kill a whole bunch of people. Really irresponsible of the organizers to have speeds that high for the course.  It not a matter of if but when a tragedy at Goodwood will happen if they keep running those speeds.
least the track is now vacuumed clean lol
If a Cylon were to become a race car this would be it
My goodness!😳 It was leaving dust trails just like a fighter jet!
If he wants to beat 39.9 the car needs a lot more power
Now I know where my kid bumper car gone missing. Someone stole & took it to Goodwood
That was amazing speed. Max Chilton is incredibly brave for going that fast. Never forget Nick Heidfeld in the MP4-13. Never. Maddest ever run.
so you CUT the clip right at the crucial moment!
Na na na na na na na na BATMAN!
Forget f1, I want to watch these things race!!
Well they got they engineering on point, downforce,accaleration,handeling, just showing what the newest technologie in cars can achieve today ^_^
It's narrow, but lighter and more powerful than ID.R. More slippery aero as well. At a lower weight, less downforce is needed but being narrow there is less space between the wheels. There is great suction, though. Amazing thing. All it needs it a hot battery swap as quick a a refueling in endurance racing. It might well keep pace with hypercars and do similarly long stints. Plus if the battery has the temperature and reserve, it could drop a huge amount of time over the last lap.
Increíble
Bring that to gran turismo 7
After watching the ID.R, This thing is ballistic but I also think the ID.R has the capability to go even faster as well. EV’s are taking over the speed records with ease thats for sure.
Its so insanely agile, despite being planted Visually its almost red bull x2010 kinds of silly
One of its kind I meant just one bin blind
Absolute ROCKET! WOW
All the comments about how fast it is. Me thinking about how it is electric!
was that radio controlled? ;)
Looks like the Batmobile.
I just got my first electric car yesterday and as an old petrol head have to say I’m blown away
It’s rare that cars look fast on camera and this thing looked like an absolute missile
Someday when Gordon Murray has moved past N/A V12's, I could see him doing a car like this.
Wow, this is brutally fast!!! 😳
F1 taking notes like
Take that, ICE heads.
Today i learned that Batman's secret identity is "Max Chilton".
WHAT A BEAUTY!!!
Obviously not exhaust fumes so was it spinning it’s wheels all the way up 💨??
Fan Cars aren't anything new 😅they are just ticking time bombs
Which car broke the 39.9 second record?
When ur faster than purpose built hypercars like valkarie or amg one
It's time for people to realize electric cars are better, faster, cleaner... time to retire the old dirty petrol cars.
Wow double wow 😃
Holly molly ! the downforce should be so powerful to maintain the car floored :o
It’s got road tax?! This thing is street legal what on earth
Real life bat mobile
Caceete
The term on rails comes to mind
Cartoonish speed from cartoonish grip.
That actually sounded better than the V12 Valkyrie it had on a week or so ago, lol.
Formula 1 should race with cars like these
Holy cats! I'm pretty sure he'll break the record.
Why was there smoke
Add to GT7 please.
Real life scalextric !
I hate electric cars but that run was absolutely insane.
Insane! Just INSANE!!
That thing is like the best of Dyson range. What a machine 👌
It’s like the video on fast forward
Impressive yet so ugly...
This is one of the coolest ventures an ex F1 driver is a part of. This McMurtry is an unbelievable work of engineering 😳
the title makes zero sense that aside, what an insane vehicle, the thing just looks like an aggressive racecar from the future lol!
this is nuts
Looks like the bat car
reminds me of TVR cercera 12.
Put 40 of these in a race in Monaco, holy moly
It would be great if after development they work on a "Junior" version with [only] 400 hp and no fan system. Then I can start dreaming of potentially owning one.
Imagine, living in a world that embraces keeping a car As a status symbol, instead of feeling the joy it gives and why is that an iPhone is a thing... Because thats an affordable flex... So people just poor, poor in heart xd
Mercedes have a look at it no porpoising
Chilton be like: m8 this is faster than the shitbox I drove in F1
I'd take this instead of Formula E any day
What an absolute weapon!
This is a REAL BRUTAL⚡️😈BEAST⚡️
Anyone know the car at the beginning? I need it!
Hope there's a onboard 😍🥵
I'm Batman
My eyes and brain don't comprehend how fast this shrunken car can be so fast.
Imagine a 20 car race at Monaco with these things 🤤🔥
I want the Escudo not that rc thing... Everybody already forgot about Heidfeld F1 run... that was something else.
Fan car = Win
Very easy to optimize for races/events of a known length. I bet this car will have barely enough juice to get back to the paddock. The Volkswagen Electric car had *just enough* juice to race Pike's Peak, it's intended use.
Bruce Wayne “Alfred, get the builder on the telephone.”
Quick but I’d much rather hear an earth shattering v12 👌🏻
The bat-mobile
It's Max Chilton. I'm sure there's another 2-3 seconds in it with a proper driver behind the wheel. 😏
Batman, hate to break the bad news to you, but.. That's illegal.
I still want to go to FOS Goodwood , but I really need to go soon cause more and more of these boring electric cars are coming to this event. I love combustion engines that’s why I want to not these boring vacuumcleaners
What set the hill record 39.9 then?
It sure looks like you can break the record
Rapid
The absurdly short wheelbase probably isn't helping stability, but the fact that it's so ridiculously tiny helps it a LOT - plenty of Goodwood's fastest cars have had to tiptoe through some sections of the course because the road is so narrow.  It's cartoonish, this thing. It reminds me of those parasite fighters that the US military tried to strap to the undersides of their bombers. If anything is going to threaten the VW iD.R's record time, I'd put my money on this thing.
What car holds the record?.
Holy balls batman
VW spends millions and millions designing the IDR to be the fastest hill climb car ever   some blokes from Gloucestershire. "ight bet"
It's just cartoonishly fast! Just sensational!
Which car holds the record?
History in the making.
*drops crumpet*
so narrow it looks like it could roll over cog is probably really low tho
A future street legal car (from their website) that is faster than an ex F1 car... This level of performance are just unseen before on the road market.
Electric sucks!
Damn, that thing just looks like a weapon, so tiny!!
The body styling could do with a little make over but otherwise,... this thing is amazing. Ok what's the engine set up?
Real life batmobile
Surprising that they are still allowed to set a time in such fast cars after they stopped timing F1 cars
Wow, it would be so much quicker with internal combustion engine...
Nice title, now there's no need to watch the video
Whoa I have never seen a vehicle for up the hill that fast, and on a wet surface!! 🏎️💨💨
For your reference, the Volkswagen ID.R time is 39.9
Quality, bring that record back home, and made on a farm, haha
Max Chilton never looked so fast.  I assume that's "6 seconds faster than the record?".  Edited out at the end there.  Important info.
What's the name of the car again? 😉
mini bat mobile
Fast cars usually look slow on camera, but JFC this looked freaking ballistic! 😳
to keep in mind: the record currently is held by ID.R with 39.90. This car is only 1.3 seconds behind ID.R. It's really close
Ah the future finally
I didn't know the batmobile would take the climb. Batman looking for publicity lol
I think we have a new candidate for ugliest car, I mean it’s short, and the front is ugly, but it can go fast
That's a life size Hot Wheels car
Scalectrix don't count lol
With a dry surface and a bit more bravery, it takes the record. For sure.
Wow... I've just watched that 3 times in a row and I'm still blown away... that literally looks like a guided missile on wheels....
This is history in the making. Imagine looking at every other car maker building longer, wider, heavier cars and having the courage to believe that every one of them was wrong. Going it alone and building something wildly different, and on only it's second run it proves to be faster than any Porsche, any Ferrari, any Group B car, any Le Mans car, any *F1* car, any *combustion engine car*.... and the driver says it's got more to give. The other thing that's absolutely astonishing about this car is something I've only just found out...  It's hidden away on page 22 of a brochure on their website, but it's amazing, terrifying and turns the car world upside-down. There's a photo of the back of the car, and below the lights is something that should scare the living daylights out of Ferrari, AMG-Mercedes, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Porsche, Aston Martin and anyone else in the hypercar market. It's a numberplate.  This thing is going to be a road legal production car.
Look at that thing go!
That car is insane!
Respect
British Engineering!
and its road legal???
Yep
Would be interesting to see a modern f1 car or lmp1 car attempt this climb.
🤯🤯🤯
Sheesh.
That thing is quick asf
Even sounds cool
The Lilliputian dimensions of this car make is perfect for Goodwood's narrow run up the hill...
That thing looks like it was running on rails... The handling at that speed is absolutely jaw-dropping!!!
We are getting closer to "Rocket League" and i'm ready
This thing looks like it came straight from a Speed Racer cartoon. …and I’m all about it! lol
...and people say Electric cars are boring.
Love this event but I can't believe people are standing there behind hay bales with their kids.  Pure insanity.  Something nasty will occur at some point and change everything.
It’s impressive but sole less for me
I get that it's crazy quick but it just doesn't give you the chills that listening to a v10 mclaren doing the run does
hahahhaha it just fucks off
I would love to see this taking away the record from VW.
Is this the fastest time?
fzr 2000
Tooned Batmobile
the side mirrors slowing the car down.
WoW
The flying dilder, big 🫡.
Watching this makes me keep thinking the aspect ration of the video is off. If you know what I mean, you know.
Stick your EV and great reset
So this car has a fan creating down force to keep it stuck to the track?  Gas powered cars were doing that decades ago and were outlawed
If you think that was fast, wait until it went into second gear...
It's a happy meal toy on steroids
This run was... BLISTERINGLY QUICK! And that crazy grip, seemed like it was running on rails.
electric should be banned from the event , we only need diesel and petrol cars !
I was near the finish line in the woods and heart that thing, you could tell it was going fast!
And still it is a soulless piece of ugly crap
This should be the Gen 4 formula E car
meanwhile Formula E gets passed by a Twizy
The U-shaped battery – structural within the tub – offers 60kWh of capacity and can sustain 30–60mins of flat-out running depending on weather and circuit.
Silent but speed
That thing has be melting inside that was amazing.
The video looks sped up! WOW 😳😳
Wow, I have a strange feeling that even Max Chilton inside the car was going 'Man, this is fast!'😂
Too quick for the camera shots. By the time it comes into view it's gone!
Wow! That thing  is fast!
I'm a fan of it already
Whats the name of the car
I remember when people keep saying that EV's will never come close to being as fast as a race car.
존나 빠르다!~
Reminds me of my 12 year old Kia Ceed diesel
How far off from the record is he?
Nobody cares
Unnngh.
Gotta watch that again...
So stable
Speechless
Goddam!!
This is the event that Bruce Wayne attends when he needs a new Batmobile.
Imagine 20 of this little shits racing each other closely !
where is the smoke coming from
I hope he gets another run this weekend, I would love to see him break the record
Love the dust being thrown out the back as the fan sucks it up as it sucks the car to the road lol....now thats what we need more of lol
IT'S THE BATMOBILE!
Bruce Wayne was in a hurry...
Don't let Richard Hammond drive this
Imagine a race series with these smol things. Would be insanely funny to watch
Absolutely mad how fast it looked at 0:20
Respect the engineering
What time doe
It hunkered down like it was on rails.  Amazing.  Like to trade my kids for at least one.
This is literally the batmobile
Don't let Richard Hammond drive it
Baby vulcan
Its not max chilton who driving, its bruce wayne himself!
That was some hogwarts shh right there :0
I saw the Porsche 993 prior to this. This micro car makes it look very pedestrian by comparison.
Sold I will take one 👌🏻❤️
This run was rapid but still looked like there are 5 seconds yet to find
Hauling
bruh.
😳😳😳
Just Bwoah 🤔 👍
Woohoo! What an incredibly exciting EV! And we’re likely to see Randy Pobst and the UP Tesla Plaid win the Overall at Pikes Peak Hillclimb this Sunday! Hope to see some of you there😎
unreal
Goddamn that’s a speedy thing
Goes like a bullet, sounds like a vaccum cleaner.
It's like a video game car!
Nearly half a second faster than the legendary McLaren MP4-13 (1998 F1 car).
awesome
way to cut the video off before showing us the time   🙄
Now THIS is racing!  Look at the *dust* trails forming at the back of the car!!
WOW!!
I love electric but I wanna smell horsepower with fuel
Crazy 😜
Got to see this last year pre wing and it was so cool. Sounds space age
Second time in history? After Volkswagen ID.R
Can someone be faster than IDR? 39.9
That was unbelievable,  the way it powered up the Goodwood hill was breathtaking. But it does look like a bat car which was never used for filming, cause they couldn't get the actors egos in.
Cheers mate 😎 👌
Damn i was surprised with the speed, this is a silent beast
can’t a v12 f1 guy just send it please?
looks so cartoonish. goofy ahh car
Absolutely boring
Put it in ppihc now
New Gen Formula E car?
Holy cow I did not expect that quick of a time!
If it had the Batman logo it would've added an extra 300 bhp.
wow that a nice looking car...i need to look more into this
This could lead the standings come the final hill climb runs
Could it be the fastest washing machine up the hill?
bugate
Wow
🥰👍
