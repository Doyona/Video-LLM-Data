I a a man in biesbos.pownews.not a b.i.t.c.h.❤
0:03 I wish she wouldn't do this fake accent. She's a posh girl and she should lean into it like Dua Lipa. I think this identity issue is a big part of why she hasn't had much success recently. People don't know who she is
Best song ❤
Cardi B
it's supposed to be kidi ft Mabel ❤ but unfortunately that ain't possible ❤
so where kidi in this video ❤
😊
Why does the start of video look like fake taxi!
She has a new chinese boyfriend 👍
I like this black girl ❤
As one does Mabel
KHALEESI??? Omg

MABEL IS BACK The new single LET THEM KNOW
Why she is so underrated? My favorite songs of her are ; 1-Animal 2- Let Them Know  3- Overthinking  4- LOL  Greetings from Türkiye 🇹🇷  Stay with good music and art❤ with love
She's improved over last 3 years she's hella hot and transferred😊 anyways just keeping it real
LET THEM KNOW! ❤  this popped in my head other day yes
Wow music just gets worse and worse as the days go on. 90s some of the best music ever released.
Sophie Ellis Bextor walked so Mabel could run
I dance and we have older girls and they dance to this song
Nailss shinee likee christmass🎄🎄💅💅
😆😆😆🤣🤣ffs u UK girls shegged me still
Does anyone know what the background vocals are saying after 2:31 ? I think I heard "go and tell 'em who you are", but I'm not sure. 🤔
Did anyone else know her mother is neneh cherry? I found out today and had no idea
Marbel, had a slugger musical juggernaut here, the video is severely lacking....like meh...yawn......I needed wicked Spice, all I got was pepto bismol....management should be fired
Damn straight she's been out few years she's great writer and dancer looking good still watch the earlier years to this years how'd everyone enjoy it and the splits at the very end hella great song vid and dancing music thank you Mabel..🎉🎉🎉🎉
How about those spoilers at the end it's classic move her entrance to her dancing live Mabel
She's Britain
Mabel i discovered her few years ago straight up hot great writer as well she's looking great..😊🎉🎉🎉
"What's love got to do with it" brought me here
ILLUMINATI
Mabel Ellis-Bextor.

This is the song that was running through my head when I went for the interview for my current job. It calmed me down and I'm still absolutely loving it now.... thank you Mabel
Whatever she has been getting in the song she deserves a lot more chance
❤🎉😮❤❤❤❤🎉
WoW ....who she is? ... love her accent! 😍 ... so good she found her phone! lol 🥳🥳🥳

Here from Dance 100 on Netflix. Keenan did his thang to this song ❤
You are so glad that you are cool
Love you so much
Everything about this song is absolutely awful. The lyrics, the tune, the cringey way she says some of the lines, just everything.
Lyrics: Nails shining like Christmas Heels on six inches Waist cinched, Mugler fit You can't have this You can't hit this  I got a new man in my business And he all about his business And his name ain't none of your business Oh, oh, oh  Pin up girl on that poster Say So like I'm Doja Icey Wifey Body shape Coca-Cola  I got a new man in my business And he all about his business And his name ain't none of your business Oh, oh, oh  Let them know Oh baby, let them know 'Cause they can run their mouth But I'ma stand and pose for you Let them know Go 'head and flip that switch No, they can't beat you down 'Cause, baby, you're that bitch  Lips pink like peaches Money long like beaches Rolls Royce screeching Rolex gleaming Blonde hair, yeah, I bleached it You can call me Khaleesi I stay up on my queen shit Up here the haters look teeny tiny, ooh  Let them know Oh baby, let them know 'Cause they can run their mouth But I'ma stand and pose for you Let them know Go 'head and flip that switch No, they can't beat you down 'Cause, baby, you're that bitch  (Baby, you're that bitch Baby, you're that You're that bitch Baby, you're that You're that bitch Baby, you're that Baby, you're that) You're that bitch  All my girls feel the bass line Ponytail to the waist line Throw it back, baby, take time Money talks and I make mine All my girls feel the bass line Ponytail to the waist line Throw it back, baby, take time Money talks and I make mine  Let them know Oh baby, let them know 'Cause they can run their mouth But I'ma stand and pose for you Let them know Go 'head and flip that switch No, they can't beat you down 'Cause, baby, you're that bitch  Let them know Oh baby, let them know 'Cause they can run their mouth But I'ma stand and pose for you Let them know Go 'head and flip that switch No, they can't beat you down 'Cause, baby, you're that bitch

She is fire❤❤
Yas! Finally someone that really thinks about her music, it's SO well done. Every single detail..
I'm from Slovenia. My knowladge of English is very limited. Surely I'm not a natural talent for learning any new language. I would rate myself as A2 but maaaaaaan even fucking I would write better lyric than she is singing. Wtf?! And she is born in England. Mabel. Please, please don't embarrass yourself with that shit. You got all that is needed to become a mega superstar so don't throw away everything because of stupid lyrics. Ask fucking chatGPT to write for you for God sake. It would write 100 times better.
I have just realized that she's Neneh Cherry's daughter!!!!!!!! OMFG!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
she got man hips! trans-sexual, for sure!
love it❤, fooooool me babes
This is the best video! I like this video! ❤❤❤
Mabel, amo suas músicas
Que musica fodaaaa!! 🤩
Fire for real I love it mable is one of  the best singers  I've heard mable if you ever read this girl  your fire mable is the queen you slay mable your  the best I love you!!!!

Nene Cherries daughter Nuff said  🤷‍♀️🎵🪄🎵 let them know they can run their mouth 🤷‍♀️🥳
Yes momma I'm that bitch
Wow that was just terrible
Fuck no
Wow i love it is the firsr time i hear this song from mabel, i listen this 30 o more times hahaha 💙😍😊
A floorfiller for sure great tune
Good song but needs to be longer. I don’t get why most songs these days are under 3 minutes. Its like they couldn’t be bothered and called it a day
This should've been a number one
Comethrough Miss Dakota Schiffer!
this is more of a commercial than just a song..
Why would you mention your new man to us if he's none of our business???
A BOP yet only has 9 million views??? Such a crime!!!
Mabel ис мультсериала "Гравити Фолс"
Perfection
Now I imagine Dakota all the time I listen to this bop
Mama Ru, vibes! I totally lve it!
spitting image of her beautiful mother .
Anyone else thinking of the beginning of a porn movie when the cab driver asked if she was heading to the club?
🌹🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🌺
you are really beautiful
i am your fan
Rhyming business 3 times - genius! 😵‍💫
👻💋👻💋👻💋💫
so darn lucky to have found her phone. wild night and whatnot
Mabel should be a guest judge on Drag Race UK!🥹
who’s here after Drag Race UK?
Perfection, Yeah
100% here for my girl DAKOTA
No, if this was given to Britney Spears for her comeback it would leave everyone dead af, but still Mabel kills it too
she has her mother as her home screen: Neneh Cherry 🥺
Fit 🔥 and hot 🔥 😍 😋 👌
this will never get old  no matter what
Here after Dakota va just may lip sync ✨
You better Work! Oh.. wait 🤔🫢
It’s official dakota has brought a lot of us here just like Denali brought us to 100% pure love the only two drag race girls that have brought me to a song after their lipsync.
She knows how to put her in the best light. She's gorgeous, can sing and is so flexible, wow. Felt in love
Lyrics are a load of shit! But ❤ the tune.
0:21 did she say "he was only 6 inches" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👀

if it wasnt for dakota schiffer omg i wouldnt know this masterpiece
hi

Ay lovee mabel

DAKOTA ATE
😍😍😍😍😍
Here because of Dakota Schiffer !
Why does she remind me of Alessia Cara if she went pop
Na komisariacie
'up here the haters look teeny tiny' is so good what the fuck???????
Here after lipsync in Drag Race Uk4
Here after Rupaul’s Drag Race UK Ep 4x01 ❤
Reminds me of Dudley's theme in SF 3rd Strike.
Here thanks to drag race uk
the line between a drag queen and a real pop female artist is thin as hell today.
Thanks to Rupaul Drag Race UK
i hate these widescreen videos they mess up the you tube page.
just discovered this and it sounds like a global pop smash on first listen. Its so catchy. she is also bringing it in the video with the choreo. Thats pussycat dolls level & they are the benchmark for such videos. somebody said in comments if this was Dua lipa it would be massive. How true.
Dakota vs. Just May ❤❤❤
Who is here because of DRUK Season 4? Thanks for introducing me to this banger!
I am ashamed i never heard this bop before drag race uk, and i am from the uk
WHERE HAS THIS BOP BEEN ALL MY LIFE ?!?!?!  Thanks Drag Race UK !!!!
Drag Race UK brought me here & I’m never leaving

Rupaul sent me…..bitch!
I came from drag race uk
Rupaul's Drag Race UK fans? 🤩season 4 episode 1 lipsync
she's great but she's due for a new stylist. that loose green body suit was not IT
the Supermodel sample!!!
The sample of supermodel by RuPaul werks perfectly
Dakota Schiffer vs Just May anyone
Dakota 🥰
Maybe her agent should get her to do a couple of magazine/TV interviews she deserves real success her tunes are banging & she hot as hell fire 🔥🔥🔥
This song pumps me up, man 😁 The beat bumps in the whip and the chorus could power an by entire country 🤘🏻  Thank you, Mabel! ❤
This song soo cool 💚💚💚💙💙💙
Neneh Cherry's daughter got in the business.
Ugh she is so underrated, her music is so good!!
Wieder ein gelungens Musikvideo-Mabel macht gute Musik 😀
This is shit
She is cool. I like this😍😍
1:23 blonde hair looks so good on her. Babe look
“Body shape coca cola” u damn right mabel,look at those wide hips . Mabel is such a underrated singer and a amazing dancer. I love the first outfit neon green one. Perfect for her body it compliments her hips, ass and her thighs. Exposing her armpits also a cool move.
I wonder if She really likes pop music, She started with RnB and I cant like her pop era  am I buggin
Spice Girls! I love it lol
Came here cause Love Island USA played it and I was immediately hooked 💯💃🏽 It’s definitely a bop ❤️❤️❤️

Underrated singer
What a song go mabel!
Underrated star❤️
2:16
This is a super hit
LOVE the discreet reference to her new album at the start and end, we had no idea at the start! And 'Good Luck' playing on the radio
Forgot the singer lol , luckily I follow her on instagram.! !!!! Good tune . None of your business lol  Lyrics are good.! His name is none of your business lol .
💞💞
love the song,, Love Mabel,,,  this song gives me Spice Girls Vibes,,  especially the chorus...  and she actually looks like Geri Halliwell with that haiir,,
most underrated artist in the history
Go girl
suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery... the rift at 53 secs "let them know" to me is exactly like the chorus from "heavy weight champion of the world" by Reverend and the makers"
I effing love you just wanted to Say that honey you slayyy 💅
I'm a whole man but this song makes me feel like a bad bitch 😜😝
This song is AMAZING
Literally a carbon copy of dua lipa
💋💘❤️💖💋👼🏻✨👼🏿🦋🌈
I need a feat with dua lipa
Gurl I knew Tynomi wasn't singing this, why they try to act like this was Tynomi Banks single when she didn't even have a feature? What's the tea sis?
❤️❤️❤️
She is underrated cause she is a women of color and style but these copy cats can get number 1 but Mabel can’t? She is talented and grown so much!!!
Good
Indeed she did it again and again and again....
nice rupaul flip 🔥
Man I swear, I know that taxi man from somewhere
0:39 doja
Love how she has her mum as the screen on her phone... her mums a fucking legend .... raw like sushi is the badest female album of all time
Is it just me or do i see Mabel and Zara Larsson doing a collab?
did you
The recipe to become a cat lady..
Industry plant😘
marked 1 year since im happy for mabes
8.2M
Soy yo o esta musica es muy adictiva
That i want to love you
Damn, thats a masterpiece
I don't understand how this can has 49M plays on Spotify and only 8M here on YouTube. This doesn't make sense, aren't there much more people on YouTube than on Spotify ? Few years ago, songs always had much more plays on YouTube now it's inversed.
This is such a hit🔥
Just readied at the start of the video she gave us the title of the album 11 months ago as just accounted it this week ❤️😂
Why does part of this sound like battle of the holy from castlevania
Still a banger
Mabel is incredible, she never disappoints
That’s game of thrones reference thooo 🔥
It's racial in a funny way.
Ta kobieta doprowadza mnie do myśli  samobójczych
BOP!
dislike and unsubscribe. and in general I now consider Mabel a Nazi. She forbade listening to her songs for the inhabitants of Russia. This is pure nationalism. Racial strife. I'll send you a report. Sing your songs for Hitler and his kind.
Multi talented...
This is a BOP
Party 2022!!! xXx
I can't unhear the sample from Vitas - the 7th element 😂
ABSOLUTE SMASH
Simply a banger !
😍😍🌹🌹🌹👍
Wicked tune 😋😋
Her voice is so Gypsy-ish... 🤢🤮
Cause baby you're that "witch" 😂
It's a very beautiful song ❤️❤️❤️
🤢🤮
Love 💕 Mabel
I think this song is awful. It's basically about being a asshole. Only caring about materialistic crap. It's just awful!! The lyrics aswell are sooo cringe... You can call me khalisi, Rolex gleaming... Omg it's dreadddd
Ok cool yay
Generational Test:  Are you a "Who is Mabel?...Neneh Cherry's daughter" person, or a "Who is Neneh Cherry?....Mabel's mum" person?
🤍♥️🤍♥️
job nb pop b  l
Just realized 'Good Luck' plays at the end of this!!!
This deserves way more than 81k likes.
This is a banger and also gives me Rupaul supermodel(you better work) vibes at the start
I think I'm in love with her ❤
Супер хит👑 まじでジョジョっぽい顔してる⭐🌸
love the good luck tease at 2:52 cuz it’s a BOP now that it’s out !!
Im just here to say she looks trashy af
Ru paul should have this song on his runways by now
I just discovered this song on Pandora. This is one of the best gay anthems I've ever heard.
Oh wow. She looks and sounds so much like her mother 😍
Best song ever
What’s wrong with 6inches
7.8M
Why isn't this at 10M yet
2:50 good luck new song coming out nice 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good Luck Next song 🔥🔥🔥
This is pure gold. Has a modern high pop feel. Let's dance 🕺
Dua lipa and Mabel keep on putting in more bangers of songs they make my day
❤️

Absolute banger of a video and song. Every time I put my music on this is one I have to listen too. Huge fan of Mabel.
Hoi
0:01 fake taxi be like
E la nostra preferita mia e della mia fidanzata il mio dolce amore mio gli occhi del mare
This is truly awful. The lyrics are so bad. Does Mabel strive to release a steady stream of shit?
Uncle g way forward babes
Hi I am Rhea sister I love you
The picture on her phone, her mum, Neneh Cherry 😍😍
Judging by this and her hideous tattoos, her days are numbered. Sell your soul all you want girl
Where is the ponytail to the waist line?
I hate this cheap, garbage song
Great!!!!
Thumbs for Mabel- This girl is Fire
From good songs like don't call me up and Mad love she is going down...
Six inches definitely not enough for Mabel 9.5 here for you anytime
This is a banger.. can't stop listening to this song..mabel, your new album will be amazing 😍..good luck mabel♥️♥️♥️

Obsessed with this song!! 😍😍😍 Sooo damn good!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
love her songs, and love the fact she did re-scenes from the PCD tracks, buttons + react + etc, love  them both :)
Love it !
I here a Rupaul sample at the beginning!? "Supermodel" or am I  only one?
This song could be a TikTok trend
Viva mabel puro mexico pura lumbre ????
Looks like the Millennium Songs 90s and 2000s years
Before she started singing it sounded like a Ru Paul track! 😂
underated
All I know is I’m not a bitch... I’m do me like a bouncy tigger lol 😂
If Doja cat ,Ava Max  and dua lipa had a baby
Queen 👑 ✨🙌🏻
No mabel is not underrated this on summer 2022 will be a hit its already hit in serbia

1:28🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi Mabel You very beautiful music dance Perfect 😘❤️❤️❤️💋
She's stunning and is a very attractive young lady who can sing and who has smashed the r&b/dance music scene shes been very successful + she's made herself plenty of cash and she's not full of plastic and is naturally beautiful and not fake like most women singer!!! 😍🤩🤩
TOTAL CRAP/ she actually won an award?????????????????????
Gives me RuPaul songs vibes 😁😊👌

Is it Sam Smith singing that "baby, you're that bitch" on repeat in the background?
I liked the first 1:05 of the music
House still going strong
Классная песня и девушка огнено хороша)

Put four Billon dollars on Mabel to murder, for saying to me his name ain’t knowing your business to me when I asked her, for someone’s name nicely and then she laughed at me, when i don’t give a f**k about whom ever it is

Mabel omg you rock gorgeous 😍 💗 💖 💕 💓
Spice Girl realness
Ima be honest I am just surprised her phone was still at the club the next day and no one took it baha
Best music video of 2021. I've watched this at least 40 times
Still can't get over those splits. Who knew!
My Amv: https://youtu.be/ODF_f0br9IM🤗💕
Ela e linda maravilhosa
Come on people we need this to get to 100M
6.5M
I see she didn't inherit any of her mothers talent..
I cant stop listening to it i love it amazing video amazing song go mabel go girl🔥
Beautifull mabel
Who agrees with me that she is very blond?
This is a great song.....i'm thinking it's a Drag Queens dream song....
She’s hot 🔥👌
Is it a man?
😘😘😘😘😘😘🔟😊😊😊😊😊😊
0:13
This is so cheap.
Just saw Brian Laundrie i  the video lmao
That ariana's "focus on me" moment in that box
found my new idol💖💖💖
wow🤣🤣🤣
Mabel  you  swear you said shit and bitch
Come to Sheffield
Love it but how do u leave ur phone at the club?!
this is much better than her songs which have x10 views
Great melody but these lyrics are dog shxt. "Money long like beaches".....eh.
Lips pink like peaches
Disgusting and decadent.. The Roman empire fell while this song was playing..
I hear this song but I don't know what is the tittle
Love this tune
Wow, garbage, rhyming business with business 3 times.
Intro reminds me of Rupaul's Supermodel (You Better Work)
The phone's screen is fake. That's from an other phone.  It's a screenshot.   LOOK AT THIS!!!! 2:53-2:56
😍😍👌👌
Feels like this song will always be stuck in my head 👌😂
the song is a bit generic in itself. Stacato singing like a lot of artists do. The lyrics is also not that outstanding. But when she gets to the chorus i love the song, doesnt matter what she sings, it swings exactly right. It makes the whole song.
Mds essa música 😍😍😍
polic?
2:54 NENEH CHERRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whoever choreographed this really puts themselves in the artists shoes because Mabel looked soooo good during the dances
I fucking hate this song
This is good.
Nah not having it, mabel was total authentic when first came out..bring back that shy natural sweetheart
#LETTHEMKNOW
she rocked that again🔥🔥
you go mabel
let them know
I heard this on Gaydio and I loved it the minute I heard it. Sometimes you have to let your crew know who's the "b**ch" and who is "entourage"
Iam already hearing this in every store i go
I have only just seen this edit of the video after a summer in hospital - I wish I was in the clubs listening and dancing to this x
So beautiful ♥️
LETS INVATE KUWAIT BABY !!!!
What the actual fuck is wrong with everyone in this comment section!?!?!?
I really like the song!!❤️❤️😁here in Switzerland its on the radio everyday
Im here from h&m playlist 🤣❤️🙏
I love this song. I listen to it a lot. The chorus is very good!👍
You’re amazing 🤩
Legs, boyeeee
love it love mabel
0:42 Nice Coca Cola reference
https://youtu.be/tqdcDZ-5pvM
Who wants  Joel Corry to do a remix of this song...LET THEM KNOW...Let Joel Know😉
Great song October 2021
Dua Lipa type beat.
ᵗᵉᵉⁿʸ ᵗᶦⁿʸ
Mabel es pura lumbre ????
Great song!
Why does she look like 80’s X-Men Rogue?
Maybe it's maybeline
She was releasing some really catchy stuff but this is just awful
Haha this is my hair colour at the min sporting my inner ginger spice 🔥
j'aime beaucoup tu te comportes comme une star internationale.
Those legs tho.
Мabel music very❤ good
Tune awesome... Pity it's all about today's vulgarity.
Garbage. Crap. Simple music for simple people.
Girrrl go eat a sandwich ASAP
She's well fit.
This is trash. I love it.
You're so chosen
Талии нет, прямая, как доска.
Music very very good ❤
Yh my best tune of hers lol
I can't get this Mabel song 'outa' my head!  It's totally spot-on .... I don't know WHO produced it - but they DID an amazing job!!  And Mabel looks and sounds fantastic - like always!!  .... I'm only left thinking why this great tune was not named; 'You're That B*tch!' ...... I love it xx
Bit sad when all the backup dancers look better than mabel.
Underrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzHIRUoe_u0
She looks so much like her mum.
now this is a song!!! wow 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
too much businesses  am obseeeeeeed
Theres no way mabels phone would still be there the morning after, you usually find a sim card in the spot you lost it 👌😆
This is something Dua Lipa would sing
I don't like much of today's music but this one is pretty decent
https://youtu.be/WMSrZS9En7Y
I can only image, If "Mabel & Dua Lipa" rule the world together???!
Love that it includes Ru Paul’s Supermodel :P
Mabeeeeeeel ❤️
Did you find love is that what is the song about
sounds like receive you from yakuza games
0:41 vadicep koka kola
MABEL THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG OF YOURS   AND HAIR WITH STREAK AT FRONT GIVES ME MORGAN FROM WOLFVEREN VIBES.  EXCUSE THE SPELLING GUYS! Lol. 😂😂
this is not the incredible musical quality i remember from mabel. don't lose your way
JESUS, THE CHRIST, MADE THE EARTH FLAT. THE EARTH IS NOT A SPINNING BALL. YOU ARE NOT ON A SPINNING SURFACE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU JUMP UP, YOU WILL LAND IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT. GRAVITY IS NOT HOLDING YOU DOWN, YOU ARE FREE TO WALK THE EARTH. NOTHING IS KEEPING YOU OR THE OCEAN FROM MOVING AROUND, OR BASKETBALLS FROM BOUNCING. YOU ARE NOT BEING THROWN OFF OF A SPINNING BALL, BECAUSE THE EARTH IS NOT SPINNING OR A BALL. THE WIND IS NOT HITTING YOU AT THOUSANDS OF MILES PER HOUR, AND YOU ARE NOT DYING FROM THE VELOCITY OF EARTH’S ORBIT, BECAUSE EARTH DOES NOT ORBIT. THE EARTH STANDS STILL, AND THE SUN GOES AROUND THE EARTH, JUST AS IT APPEARS. NASA AND SOME C.E.O.’S ARE LYING AND PRODUCING FAKE VIDEOS TO YOUR SHAME! THOSE WHO DO EVIL IN THIS LIFE WILL BE THROWN OFF THE EDGE OF EARTH INTO, AS THE BOOK DESCRIBES, “OUTER DARKNESS.” THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OUTER SPACE. SPACE IS A LIE AND SPACE TRAVEL IS STAGED. NOBODY WENT TO THE MOON IN 1969. THE MOON IS A LIGHT. LOOK AT THE HALF MOON AND ASK YOURSELF HOW ONLY HALF OF THE MOON COULD BE LIT UP AS THE SUN PASSES THROUGH THE SKY; AND HOW COULD THE SUN LIGHT UP THE MOON WHILE THE REST OF THE SKY IS DARK AT NIGHT?
This song makes me proud to be British
This sounds a bit like ‘you better Work’ by Rupaul.
This is softcore porn. The intro screams fake taxi and the rest is a thirst trap.
Какафония.
who thought that intro was a fake taxi video?
oooo i like it. bouncy
This song reminds me of Mel she looks like her pt.
4000000 ikideli club mix
Okadar para harcamislar sarki cok kotu Dj furkan iki deki club mix bile bundan fazla dinlenmis 25 dkk bilgisayar ile yapilmis. Music
this has such a 00's vibe
The worst
"Bla bla business something something business dont care dont care business" thats what i hear
this song was for the girls and the gays 😭💖
I don’t know what This is all about ? What sort of lyrics is this ? I think people become crazy after getting famous that’s the only thing I can find here .
Happy now Mabel and I think my work here is done. By the way I tried to fix the song.
Definition of entertainment
Is it just me or does it give me the horrid henry movie vibe
#pangolin
Listen to this cover i’m not kidding it’s the best  https://youtu.be/XA2YEHn-A8Q
I remember her Mum. I am old
Shes giving ginger spice vibes
U can call me Khaleesi 😝🔥🔥
you should ware some fishnets ,Beyounce's trick to prevent thighs juggling .and give them good shape
Ustedes se merecen esto y mas pura lumbre ????
so i usually listen to japanese songs and i heard this on the radio- and i was addicted. this is a masterpiece
This is a really strong dance track. She’ll have a long future!
Hun, you need to sing a duet with mum! Love everything you've done also a big fan of Neneh too! xx
Hella underrated!!! Guys she deserves way better 😭😭
🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
Lol. Utter, utter dog shit
SOunds like she be in CHicago gangsta rapper-land for a few years. Plain ole 'ruint'.
God no mabel wth this isn't a song u would write or sing if was upto u this is like spice girls back in day and u listening to it now 30 yrs later and wondered why ppl liked tge spice girls so much cos songs are shit.?! Anyone else agree
This wasnt bad for a song. The artist was showing too much skin and trying in each segment of this video to look too sexy.  There was nothing left to the imagination, in one video you got it all. Id sack the stylist. Id sack the person who advises srtists like Mabel what direction her career should take. In fact Mabel, get the hell out and away from the team around you the first chance you get. And look for a more sophisticated team who would give you that vibe mature look with out all the glitter. You have what it takes. Yout underratted and that is because of what I just said in this comment, new label, new team new faith and you'll make it big girl.
Dreadful.
You could have everything in the world but without Jesus you have nothing as John 15:4-5 explains perfectly. I just pray that this reaches the right people even if it's just one person!  John 15:4-5 - "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”
Miss her old stuff.
This gives me vibes/feels of a party down the street i wish I'd had the nerve to go to (being only 10 yo LOL) in Summer 1997😃😎🤩😜🤯🤑💪✌️👍
Which season 12 drag queen is this?
Where you wanna go luv?
Love this song bitch
This song is so underrated 🙌 absolute bop
You lose 20 brain cells each time she says business, so you're left brain-dead by the end of the first verse.......I'm guessing that ship has sailed for anyone who likes this garbage though.
I heard this on the radio and cant stop listening ❤️
Mabel is such a talented beautiful amazing singer ❤️
at first i tought this is a fake taxi episode
👍🏻😃😍😃😍🤩❤️❤️❤️
Why she involved lovely peaches in this?
She looks like ginger spice girls
I love mis tres genios lupita jimito gaelito pura lumbre ????
slay
I LOVE HER SM FOR SAVING OUR SUMMER
Great song but the dancing/choreography was kind of lackluster. Not her fault I’m sure, but this song had so much potential for better dance breaks!
This is a shit version of heavyweight champion of the world by reverend and the makers.   Sounds exactly like it
That Daenerys reference is iconic
Solo lo mejor pura lumbre ????
She looks a lot like Debby Ryan
i miss old mabel,this is not mabel type song
hermosa  :D
Wow 😍🔥
Who else is here from the Ant and Dec TikTok advert?
IT NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME HOW FAR WOMEN WILL GO TO HIDE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INSECURE
she’s coming for blood like a mosquito. luv her!!
Solo ustedes hermosas personas se meresen lo mejor pura lumbre ???? 305
Love it
Lyrics   Nails shine like Christmas  Heels on, 6 inches  Waist cinged Mugler fit  You can’t have this You can’t hit this I got a new man in my business, he all about his business  His name ain’t none of your business  Pin up girl on that poster Say So like I’m Doja Icy Wifey Body shaped, Coca Cola I got a new man in my business, he’s all about his business  His name ain’t none of your business   Let them know  Oh baby, let them know  Cause they can run their mouth but ima stand and pose for you  Let them know  Go ahead and flip that switch  They can’t beat you down cause baby, you’re that bitch  Lips pink like Peaches  Money long like beaches  Rolls Royce screeching  Rolex gleaming  Blonde hair, I bleached it You can call me Kehelsi  I stay up on my queen shit Up here, the haters look teeny tiny  Let them know  Oh baby, let them know  Cause they can run their mouth but ima stand and pose for you  Let them know  Go ahead and flip that switch  They can’t beat you down cause baby, you’re that bitch  Baby, you’re that bitch Baby, you’re that  Baby, you’re that bitch Baby, you’re that  Baby, you’re that bitch  Baby, you’re that  Baby, you’re  You’re that bitch  All my girls feel the baseline  Ponytail to the waistline Throw it back Baby, take time Money talks and I make mine All the girls feel the bassline Ponytail to the waistline  Throw it back Baby, take time Money talks and I make mine  Let them know  Oh baby, let them know  Cause they can run their mouth but ima stand and pose for you  Let them know  Go ahead and flip that switch  They can’t beat you down cause baby, you’re that bitch  Let them know  Oh baby, let them know  Cause they can run their mouth but ima stand and pose for you  Let them know  Go ahead and flip that switch  They can’t beat you down cause baby, you’re that bitch
I meant attitude adjustment
This woman needs a attune adjustment
Seems forced
LET THEM KNOW I'M A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR CUZ I AM A WOMAN
Princess,U BELIEVE YOU'RE OWN LIES JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER WOMAN.
The thing I like most about this song is the way the censored version on the radio replaces "Bitch" with "Shhhh" it's a genius way of making the song fit for all audiences while allowing the listener to enjoy the music either way.
IS THIS FEMINSIST FOR REAL? PRINCESS WHO CREATED THE WORLD?
Saludos mi gente pura lumbre ????
bloody awful , dancing around in lycra to sell records whilst showing your camel toe off , female exploitation at its worst
If they do a remix of this song, i would love if nicki or doja had a verse on it 😍
Thought it was an episode of fake taxi at the start.
Check out my Deeper Basscore of this at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzJd3_1UTCo
Worst shit I ever heard. Cool vid tho👍
Wooooo puro dance a ritmo de mabel pura lumbre ????
This has to be the most irritating song in existence apart from dance monkey
Anyone that is anyone would no her phone would definitely not still be there !
I swear that on the first listen I thought the backing vocals were saying "baby yoda Ba yo-yo-da"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi Mabel my sister is a big fan off you she watches you every day
Absolutely love this track it's soooo good and Mabel what a great artist love her
I need a night out with this gurl!
This is like an Instagram comment section
Absolutely no way her phone would still be there the next day. Especially in UK clubs 😂. Also song slaps 👏
(Also love the video its so cool)
This my new new favourite song 🤪
Fake taxi at the start
Mabel 😍.. A mabel ft anne marie or mabel ft dua lipa!??? 🥵🥵🥵 watcha say!? It would be 🔥🔥
ohh my God I just found out shes  Neneh Cherry's daughter ...
this song is just FUCKING AMAZING
Probably the best song ive heard on the radio in a while, its not too overproduced (Dave guetta) and isnt too much about love and just feels like a hit
LOLLL this is kinda bad
Strong 90s era music...great summer sound vibe of 90s bangers..... Mabel is the youngest daughter of 80s/early 90s icon Nena Cherry
5M??? There was me thinking 5 HUNDRED MILL views'd be passed
Idk how she did it, but she did... She made a deaf person cover their ears
I always thought it said: “He’s only 6 inches”
Your not a princess
Say so like dojaa
Chorus sounds familiar.... I guess ...  I could've been a contender I could've been a someone Caught up in the rat race And feeling like a no one Could've been me in the papers With the money and the girls I could've been the heavyweight champion of the world
Love your voice 💕
Mabel my taxi anytime nice x
Crank this tune up!
FEMIISM IS SO EVIL
And SHE WILL HAVE KILLED HERSELF
Great
this is such a track, well done! @mabel fantastic x yeah dudu lipa! lol x✌🏽💥💥💥💜❤️😏😠😆
This WOMAN IS GONNA BE A CAT LADY IN 40 YEARS
Feminist batch
But she gets drunk just provokes her sex appeal,you can watch yourself do good hihi,but i would go in her.disco vibe song🎶
merviliossa
EVIL FEMINIST MUST DIE!!!!
FEMINISM IS GOINS TO RUIN WESTERN SOCIETY
She’s an icon living!!!!
For the girls and the gays😃
It kinda reminds me of an 00ish indie song, but I cant quite put my finger on it.
FACEPALM!
she lost weight, the song is average.
Great hit Mabel. Probably heard of u from my ex-bff cerys
Who’s here from planet fitness? 🤣
2:31 Нестор?
Boa
I love  mabel

S
This is what music has come to smh😐😑🤦‍♂️
is it wanted that the beginning sounds like an Episode of Fake-Taxi?... :)
So, so catchy, 30 year old man here, love it ❤☘❤
Damn, you're so pretty and so, so talented.
Wanna speak about feminism? 😂😂😂😂
👏👍💞😍😍🙄🤔🤔
Lo
Fun fact; all the Balkans came from kameleon radio or radios that play songs for 45 minutes
🕊🤍🌍👸🏽🦋💫
tell me you are not rich and famous without saying you are rich and famous with a bf.   7-10 yo girls:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v_KsgpYaXHY Emanuela Rabinska The Heaven songtext  1.  The only thing I fight, are misleading false lights. I prefer the night, with stars as flashing leads than the day which obvious sky is obscured by black clouds. I try to understand the life, but when I'm on the top, I fall on the ground.. It's named people, I can't change it, that I was an angel whose the moose broke his wings and now I can't fly anymore.. But.. if I'm succesful or not, i don't have to worry 'cause: ref. The Heaven's singing to my life hi jaan ho, hi jaan hi ja And I'm twisting at a cliff I stomp to the rhythm as if I never had to die..  Kalimat
You are the best I love you
I love this song💕💕
Só ná zuei
Uio
Love how she used RuPaul’s  “ Supermodel ” song as a sample for this song
Jesus..seems anyone with no talent can make a video. Yech.
That cab  🚕 at the beginning it’s the fake taxi one I think 🤔.
We are in 2021 and Musicians still uploading their Videos in 720p 🤔🧐
Bubble Gum Pop
Heels on 6 inches🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm happy I was born in this era because there are so many great empowering songs for women like this😍😍😍
Oi tudo  bem eu sou do Brasil Manaus  da Floresta Amazonuca
Wow your voice has chaanged
garbage music
So why did everyone make fun of Pitbull for rhyming Kodak with Kodak yet Mabel rhymes Business with Business like 6 times?
Fantastic... get the medals out
Brilliant. You are very talented
I cannot stop playing this, video is amazing too.
This song actually reminds me of Stardust Speedway from Sonic CD and Sonic Mania Act 2! Very 90-ish vibes if you ask me!
Did anyone else think for a minute the back up dancers was little mix   No just me but also when did Mabel learn to do the splits go girl 🔥
Man: so you going to the club   Mabel : I left my phone there IT WAS WILD   No wonder you left your phone there lol 😂
🔥🎉💃
I like when she rhymed business with business and ended it up with business....
WHY IS SHE IN A FAKE TAXI?!
is after 2 years mabel is with us
P
Wonder if any other words rhyme with business? Like rinse this? Kiss list? Fitness? Bless the youth they try, occasionally.
Anyone else listening on repeat after love island?
Hahaha indeed 😁
Massive respect to you ✌🏼
Amazingly talented young lady…. Best song yet in my book.👍
Her star is rising this should be the one that does it for her
Massive Geri Haliwell Vibes
Really good to see the song Is now climbing up the charts and quick! Looks top 20 in the uk charts this week!!
This girl is fire 🔥
Y
please may you try not to say swers because im not allowed to lisen to u if you dont big fan
The tune of 2021 I hope she hits the top she does deserve it
*Dear stranger whoever reads this:* . . 👇 *Hope you and your family are safe and well*
Wooooowww!
Electric song..let them know 🤩 luv frm TAMIL
She did it for the Girlz and the Gayz , a whole ass BOP ! 💖🥰
What rhymes with business?  Business?   No thank you
Such a tune ❤️
El negro aun no merecia el #1 tan rápido, lo merece Sigrid o Cami.😑😑😏
Favourite song atm she's so good
Ru Paul Drag Race Song.....
im kinda surprised this video wasnt better. The green outfit was not edgy enough. And all the random im that bitch lizzo inspo's /dua lipa vibes, kinda seemed played out. Im sorry maybe i kinda expected to be blown away but not this time. Im sorry. I know you probably worked really hard too.
People comparing between celebrities.. 😤
Fajne Coca Cola
Anyone else here think that the taxi driver voice is the same guy off the FakeTaxi PH?
Is the bridge sung by RAYE?
Ja toller song. From germany
E amamos
Ruivinha de Marte? Kkkkkk 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Don't comment. Just enjoy the video.
Mabel is so belle in every way and voice of a goddess love her voice and power to Ladies
Anyone else notice the wap dance moves from tiktok during the song in this 😂
If you like these sort of songs that means your brains are fried
Thought I was on the wrong platform at the start of the video 🟧⬛️
It shows very well everything that is wrong in the wold... just plain BAD music...
Good mabel
First time listening...is this a video from 98 or 99? Just now surfacing?? Totally late 90s and early 2000s vibes from this
this song is just bomb-💥💥
mabel matiz bu kadın ile mi evlenecekmiş?
This song is absolutely awful, as is all of Mabels music. Also, why is she singing with a Jamaican accent, surely that's cultural appropriation, or does it not count when all the beta males and single mothers are simping for her?
Yet another tuneless wonder
She really a Coca-Cola bottle. Let's appreciate how much effort they put into the videos
Got to be the worse Mabel song ever thos
SMH the human race is a talentless disgrace. What have we become......
She says body type like coca cola, in the meantime, it looks more like a rectangle
L love this song
I drive  a lot at night and I used to drink 1 coffee each time I do. Now this song has replaced the coffee. Makes you sing and move the shit out of you. It is a physical impossibility to fall asleep whilst listening to it. We love you and thank you for this! What a massive hit.
Hye garmi pose 😃
Haha this is absolutely fucking awful
💜💚
Natural
Pretty good production! :):)
Flip that switch fuck ahead yeahhh ruleees
I thought it was a rupaul anthem
Omg our queen 😍😊🥰!!!
This Women Can Talk ! Smile

What a crock of shite
Perfect anthem to end the summer! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm here again after love island 🏝
Every album you bring is stunning your singing and your moves wow!
Did  she sample RUPAUL ?
Starting from I left my phone there last night it was wild then now it actually got wild
Dua is famous because  Americans  have her back, whatever  Americans  give pass certification, rest of the world follows even though the quality is not good.
Imagine actually liking this song 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ lyrical genius rhyming business with business 😭
This video is so underrated! I love this so much!!
garbage.
Sounds a bit like Heavyweight champion of the world by Reverend and the Makers
An Extremely Catchy Song  And This Is The Best I Have Ever Seen You Look.You Look Incredible And The Very Best Of Luck To You In The Future Too ...
Best song I have heard for ages 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
She is. Love
This is kinda of music that suits the best in Gay clubs. 😆
this is one of her best song holy s**t
How am I just hearing this on Love Island tonight?  Love that attitude BiTCH!!! 💃💃💃
This video is slightly budget, Mabel looks dirty and we’ve heard this type of song before. This song won’t do well as it could of done if it was done right!
POV:love island brought u here
Who’s here from love island?
Who's here after seeing her at love island villa 2021
Love Island 2021 GANG WHERE U AT ??
One of those songs, hear it once feels like you’ve heard it 100 times. Standard dribble.
I love the new song
Why are people sleeping on this song?? It’s an absolute bop! I hear it on the radio all the time, yet it’s only peaked in the charts at no.38!! Been out for 4 weeks already
nice music
Second part of the song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
-I was listening to this song in my apartment, my neighbor knocks on the door and I thought he would complain about the music,   But instead he asks me the name of the song.  I answered his question and the next thing that happens is that now we are both listening to the same version and just as loud. Good times
This song needs to stop being played on the radio all the time. It's so fucking shit
Oh please stop this song is bunny boiler desparado bitch
Mabel belike thes summer is so boring I get U
Ayeee who here from Love Island 2021?

"Say so like I'm Doja" You gurls really should do a collab! I'm expecting!! 💪💪
Laganja Estranja brought me here
You amazing
Everyone is saying she saved pop , dua lipa is been carrying pop on her back for the last 5 years , mabel is not even the best singer in her family , her mom was something else and her uncle  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHxnm1-gVS4
Thought I was on the wrong site at the beginning🤣
Horrivel
Never heard of her, but she's gonna be on Love Island so I had to search her. She's gorgeous!
The fake taxi man at the start🤣
I need to be with mabel..... 🥰
PESMETINA!!!!
wow l love it:-)
I enjoyed doing some mash ups and remixes including this one by Mabel. If you want you can listen to them on Emporio 64. https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC8lRYs18YgfNBPxKQejbqNw
Congratulations on your debut Let Them Know
😻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧯started as lil R&B 🙄…
Giving very much Rupaul and I’m here for it 😍
congratulations to mabel on winning the platinum album, congratulations again and keep my fingers crossed
Why on preview of her channel is photo of Ava Max?
I didn't like that
It seems to me or she doesn't fit a pink swimsuit
nicki minaj would sound really good in this song
💚💚💚💚
💓💓💓💓
💙💙💙💙💙
Best song on the radio lately
I was looking for music from Mabel…. from Gravity Falls
GO OFF
Honestly, lyrics are degenerate as usual, otherwise nice
GUUUUUURL HAS SERVED!!!

She's rock it**

All Girls Feel the Bassline, Ponytail to the waistline!  I love that break down!
Why the hell is there constant hiccups?
0:51  1:30  2:16 ^_^
God help us if this is the future of pop music...just heard her influences on Radio 2 (Jeeez). One thing this pandemic has taught me and that is the show must go on, in fact every industry must go on how ever bad or better it was from before!
Gostei muito bom, parabéns só cante com cantores mais conhecidos da música pop você vai arrasar e será conhecida até  aqui no Brasil.
Is that FAKE TAXI at the beginning

Elevation of mind, elicited by exotic flavours embellishing an emerald green island, renders me enticed up onto a cliff by the secretive sea. With my intuition freely expanding upon interaction with the mystical wind, I am able to feel the soothing view reaching out to me. Just before time is about to fully lose its grip on the aquatic animation, relaxed reflection approaches me with the offer of setting sail for a world record at 123 457 decimals, embedded in spiritual waves, and as my gaze returns with questions regarding whether or not the memorization this time might require of me to deal with the hardships of swimming stubbornly, and thus parting ways with any risk of drowning in surreal slumber down the road, supportive exhaustion lets my eyes close to guidance from the timelessly expressive rhythm of waves. Then, in the midst of the tranquil heartbeats of time, starting with the sound from a dam of clouds rupturing up above, followed by an unfolding waterfall of sunrays spoiling my focus with red-violet nuances over my eyelids, is when my restless reflections realize the opportunity to fall back into the hands of a wind falling up in the profound sky, and upon their granted release at vibrant heights they could be perceived migrating, free as birds, towards heavenly and levitating landscapes. Speeding through the atmosphere, tuning in to its intrinsically inspiring symphony, they surrender to falling into a vividly deep dive through rings of rejuvenating sunlight, up until the blinding increase in energy has the passage of breathing scenery spiralling spontaneously. Streched out like wings belonging to an eagle, embracing the environment, they eagerly take up snorkeling in an ocean of clouds, leaving behind a shockwave of bubbling foam followed by dolphins, whose skyhigh harmony unloads a barrage of thoughtful beings towards the increasingly bright light over the sea surface, in which they end up being swung between elastic noses of dolphins to the point where my each and every reflection jumps on the opportunity of taking the shape of pinballs displaying a madly agile smile. Enwrapped in hypnosis by the large number of falling stars, they eventually find themselves escorted by them cuddly telepathic players navigating through layers of darkness on the ocean floor and all the way to the awaiting foot of an undersea volcano, where the glowing flow of energy sends them scaling up the deceptively ancient structure, on top of which the crunch from their scintillating expectations brings the following moment to shoot my reflections right out into the arms of the heavenly kingdom. Whilst immersing themselves in the luxurious feeling from slowly journeying through fluffy air, little did they anticipate the emerging slope rendering them rolling downhill and closing in on a looming loop in which they would be thrown around and plunged up somersaulting with phenomenal grace in the rain of applause from stars gathered in graceful formation, all until reflecting thoughts come falling from the sky only to land bouncing between mirages of palm trees preceeding the distracting sound from whirlwinds dancing to the golden sound of solar energy being agelessly unleashed. Refreshingly weakend by all the involving heat, a rinsing river leaves the thoughtful forces cruising alongside radiant rays suddenly starting to transform into harmoniously homing missiles, and the very moment my every reflection is given the green light to rocket itself all the way up to its exclusively desired, groovy viewpoint inside of the celestial sphere and behold future memories of waves of light diving divinely into the living water, fast-forwarding fantasy opens the door for the gravitational field of reality to spin around. Charged with handsomely hightening homesickness, they fall like a burning bolt of lightning all the way down into a path of steaming water vapour, which they rally past with thunderous rolls leading into a visual field painting the verdant island with earthshaking and electrifying precision, and despite insightful inspiration teasing the idea of soaring reflecting in the gloriously unexplored wreath of water, reflections of mine depart with unregretful acceleration for the bobbing boat, atop the mast of which they reappear nosediving into a movement of resplendent pirouettes.        As the unassumingly captivating sound from unexplored waves allows my awareness to slowly reunite with a horizon now surrounded by a welcoming glitter, compelling excuses comprising a complex layer have been completely brushed off from my eyes by the digitally composed breeze. Through its filters still, emblazoning rays reign supreme along with an invitation to let my views widen visibly within a vegetation of subtle details, frequenting my heart as a round sound proudly providing a pulse now bearing the stamp of evermore overwhelming serenity, knowing that the moment I merge with the lyrical gurgle around the finish line, my adventures will have all just begun. Then finally, while sunrays keep treating me free fireworks blossoming out over the ocean surface, my breath is accompanied by a weightless wave of wildly vibrating vitality, the most intriguingly imperious tone of which triggers a fearless dive off the cliff with my eyes closing slowly to the blazing body of water casting a sentient crystal shine all throughout my ignited mind   If you liked what you just read and want more, google lulu where you´ll find Mind of Secrecy for only 5 USD! I´m Henrik from Sweden, and the pleasure was all mine!
This is the most basic song I’ve ever heard...
Amazing
Lol fake taxi at the start
If VOGUE came out from Mabel on 2021...
All I can hear is: "Baby Yoda, Baby Yoda" in the hook....
Amazing
Bästa låten i sommar verkligen så bra,!!!!
Let them know that I’m loving it 🙌🏽
You can call me khaleesi  Ah game of thrones
When I heard this for some reason my brain thought she would say "Go 'head and flip that switch No, they can't beat you bitch." Kinda sad that's no the actual lyrics. I know it says your that bitch in the next line but I feel like it would have sounded better like this.... just my personal opinion I do love the song! Not hating at all!
its weird how british singers sound american when they sing
Highly produced usual pap pop.All the cliches and robitic moves yawn yawn
This is probably when I'm old gonna have a billion views  now kid
Mabel en iyi sanatçılardan ama değeri bilinmiyor...
#LetThemKnow
Tüm gün karşına geçip bitch demeni dinleyebilirim
Türkücü Zara larsi lardan larsson

Blonde hair mabel
Pembe ve yeşil mabel>>>
Mabel bebeğim yeşile taktın bu aralar
Yuh askim nasi da sarki soyluyosun
This is fucking awful.
Gostei bastante é super diferente​ de  qualquer embalo!!!
Why does mabel’s face look different every video?
Wow
Mabel has forgotten her YouTube password
That's the thing about this new age. ALL women are pretty much the same while us guys are blah lol. Keep it up women!
she is so gorgeous OMG
❤️🔥❤️
Most underrated song ever.
Iggy Azalea who?
Summer anthem
I just want to roller skate 🛼 to this song!!!
this is the epitome of a love island song
The Phone is an iPhone 11 pro (max?).  But definately an iphone 11 pro.  I can prove it:  Mute Switch above volume buttons  Curved edges Triple Camera with led above the 3rd cam Great Phonecase btw.
Catchy? Yes. But the autotune is so heavy, it may as well have been sung by a computer.
Such... "poetic lyrics" 🙄 I love Mabel but this garbage is so beneath her.
Wow! This is 💩 dear YT don't place this is in my feed again!
Some shit music
She won’t last long
1:49
1:22
#apeswap
Not the beat from Rupaul's "Supermodel" 💀
YASSS BISH ✨
Mr Tracey???
I won't buy coca cola, sorry for you dear coca cola company!!!
No
Sweet 😎✌️
Mabel I love you❤😘
This is a terribly shit annoying song.
I like mabel, but this is not reaaaaaly my type.
She must be an actress because who would act like that for real in their  own life?  It is not a good look for promoting to young people, sleazy dressing, arrogant attitude, provocotive and unfeminie so aggressive do you think thats where you find love? or just more compromise and cheating, selfish self obsession.  Nope not normal at all.  The real women in the world do not act nor present like that.  Perhaps now that you have made some money you can leap into a more productive role like nursing or teaching or some role where your out of your comfort zone giving of your self for others that dont get you in a spotlight or papparrazzi.
Man from fake taxi getting in on the video at the start.
wow Mabel du ser tio år yngre ut nu när du är i bra form. !!
100😀😃😄🥳😁🎵
Brazil 💙❤️
Best song of the year 💯🤎
heard this on the radio, never the same sonce
NU E CEA MAI REUȘITĂ MUZICĂ ALUI MABEL CEA MAI REUȘITĂ MUZICĂ E DON T CALL ME UP NUMA CARE ÎS CA DON T CALL ME UP NUMA AȘA SE FACĂ
Wow!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 Love it!!
She's not Gerri Halliwell's daughter is she? #noneofyourbusiness
“ i left ma phone there last night “ such a cheesy line but it’s Mabel so it’s ok 🥰we all❤️Mabel lol
This is DAMN Good 👏🏽😍 Don’t Sleep on it ☝🏽
They need to dress her like a pop star and less like they gave her free reign at boohoo.
Shite
I am Loving this Video so Much that as Of Today I have just added it to My Playlist and One day it could replace God Is A Dancer in the evening session as soon as Early August if it clambers up to the number 1 spot in the Official Charts but if not then I'll replace God Is a Dancer with this track instead and I love the references to Doja Cat and Coca Cola so Let Them Know gets the usual 300/300 from me.
Oh dear. You had so much potential. Such a beautiful first album and then you offer this….
The chorus stomps like them Geri Halliwell hits back then.
We
What a basic video for such a savage banger! Why is her budget so low??? She has so much potential!!!
Camera work awful, it makes an artist look old and not gracious at all. A bit more elegant dance is needed too, a note to the choreographer. Music and lyrics - 👌  Even though double "business" detected.
Stupid and horrible
*En realidad, solo Jesucristo llenará tu espacio vacío, amén.*
The beginning of this song really sounds like Rupauls Covergirl? Or am i crazy?
So she rhymes buisness with buisness, and know with know, absolute genius.
when I listen to you, I'm on fire  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😻😻😻😻
LOVE IT
A lot of sass in this one, I can see the lyrics appealing to a lot of people. Nice work Mabs
She has the same producer as dua so it makes sense
jamielee
Okay choreo 🔥
💗
Guess if going backwards is the way she sure is suckseedin?! Her music use to be decent have depth and meaningful lyrics imo, this is basic as garbage could be? again imo.!. Turrible jus turrible....

Was this song not out years ago it sounds really familiar
Why is this song not in any of the Amazon music charts!?!?

MABEL I LOVE YOUR SONG SOO MUCH!!! ❤️‍🔥😍
I Lowe you
Wow
I love the chorus but I listened to her first songs...this new one and its music video are so cheap. ☹
*NUDITY* - 100%
This feels like one of those dance/electronic early 2010s songs
2009 vibes😜
Hmmmmmmm.....I do not know what to say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the Song of Summer!!
Love it! :)))
Why is music video with bad words and spotify version isn't???!! I listen to it on spotify and it doesn't hit the same...
this goes harddd 😍🔥🔥
So we're just gonna ignore the "pin up girl on that poster", "say so like I'm doja" and the"icey, Wifey" which are references to doja cat, sawteeie, and Zara Larsson
This is banging
Holy shit this is fire what the fuck ?!  I can't stop voging to this omfg
I love this beat , u did hella good bring more of this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
From music video to clothes to hair, I am simply _obsessed_ with Mabel! Your fans love you,MABEL !!🤩❤
2:16 👁 👄 👁  like how did they do that?
The chorus is very catchy with that upbeat song!
She’s soo prettyyyy
Why did this tank so hard? …

My new favourite
Wonderful
I am feeling that Ginger spice hair!
Mabel's music is flopping so hard
I love Mabel but this has made me a full STAN!! YAAAAAAAAAAS MABEL!! Bring it!!

Mabel also got offered a movie part or sum from digga d idk but Mabel should see what its bout it could bring a new path 💋❤❤loads of love Mabel
🤍🤍
Mabel is amazing beauty 💜
Geri 1999 yass queen
my new ring tone shoutout to mabel for making this song possible.
This is so different to her normal style and she reminds me of Geri Halliwell.
❤️💝🇮🇳
It's not good
Mabel you amaizing sing and dance
I'll let them know
they couldn't match her face to neck & bod? fire the make up artist babes
not really digging the "rap" vibes :/
The best music i now is this song
Lyricist: "hmmm...what rhymes with 'business'"? Lyricist: "ah yes, of course... 'business'"!
Mabel in the song: Let them know Mabel after the song: Let me know how the song is
at 1:46 it sounds like it’s saying “baby yoda” lol
Loving the vogue vibez! #LETTHEMKNOW I see it now... all the drag queens are going to slay voguing to this!!
Didn’t know it was 2002
Surprised Mabel wanted to release this. Its like a cheap knock off fake dua lipa.
amazing  90s vibe
the instrumental sounds a lot like Supermodel by Rupaul
Дојде Господ ура
I love mabel 💙
https://youtu.be/2yach0zqwts 🔕
♡
SHE IS SO UNDERRATED
This video is amazing! It is an incredible song, it should be rockin every radio station right now 🥺
Let Them know
She woke up one day and decided looking white was best.
this song has been stuck in my head for like a week
I'm just going to say it, I like the song, I like it a lot, but I don't know how I feel about taking vogue/ballroom music (something that was exclusively for the LGBTQ+ community to feel safe and welcomed) and making the song focus so much about heterosexual women and relationships. Of course Mabel cannot sing about experiences she does not have, however it is a similar situation to what happened with Madonna (although her lyrics were more vague in terms of using pronouns/referencing sexuality) where an artist uses this style of music without crediting the culture it comes from, almost diluting ballroom culture so it is no longer unique. The show Pose discussed this in it's second season, how whilst it is great that this style of music is reaching the mainstream, it does nothing to shine a light on where it came from. Mabel could have easily fixed this by including some LGBTQ representation in her music video or just not referencing in the lyrics "women" and their "men" so much. For example Shawn Mendes has made an active choice to not use specific pronouns in his songs so everyone can relate to them. Not to mention this song sounds EXACTLY like Rupaul's Supermodel, like it could be directly sampled.  EDIT: I have just found out that it was co-written by MNEK, a black queer artist, which makes me feel better about this however I still do feel a song clearly inspired by queer culture, in fact they have stated Rupaul and Pose were direct inspiration, should not be so focused on heterosexual relationships.
So fun
Welcome to the Uk CAPITAL MUSIC AND JD BE LIKE LET THEM KNOWW
This is what imaging going to a night club is like
I'm unhappy she became so famous. Her music quality is plumetting. This is ground zero.
She’s so fit
oh she did not come to play, she came to run this thang
Wasted potential. Could've rhymed 'switch' with 'bitch'.
Love the 90/00’s dance house vibes. She’s giving me a mix between Debi Ryan and Alisa Cara in the face.
My favourite from Mabel..she giving me a spice girls vibe
Thank you Snapchat for bringing me here
You know I kicked to this song straight away after it come out and 2 days later I new every word love it queen
Love your mum  Buffalo Stance 🎶
I thought it was a scene from fake taxi
Mabel, uma das melhores cantoras pop da atualidade
There is too much future nostalgia in this one.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Not me thinking the lyrics were “black domino, oh baby let them know”
She has a tatoooo noooo🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢how disgusting
I could lick whoever styles all her music videos. Beautiful!!!
I miss her fine line era tbh, like this is good but seems way more commercial
Best song ever
This was not a good song. Year 2000 vibes. Must be a foreign artist. British, northern European?
Wow….my celebrity crush 😍😍😍 rockin YET AGAIN🤩🤩
this song. WILD
this song. WILD
"body shape coca cola" girl where 😭
still listenting this bop everyday, love this new age ginger spice
She is the moment
produced regurgitated crud
Woman Power Musik :-)
Vouu, she lost weight a lot 😍
Gaves me Dua Lipa and Britney Spears vibess 😍😍✨✨ Mabel NEEDS more attention!! If this song was from Dua Lipa than it was a number one hit
Guess whoever put the subtitles didn't watch GOT and so didn't know abt khaleesi lol
I was just waching "dont call me up" and I be on this place! Now is this my favorite song
Fake taxi the guy sounds like @ the start
Love Mabel, but this is a tuneless mess. Dreadful lyrics too.
It's a banger!!! ❤️
The verses are basic af we've heard them before, the chorus is nice and catchy !! Overall the song is growing on me but she can do better
"Go ahead and Flip that switch" Amazing! LOVE THIS ! Very positive and powerful vibes with this song. It's on fire just now !!!! Brilliant Mabel
Bringer the lighter ! MABEL
Dis is bop ppl✨✨✨
How to firmly establish yourself as a new gay icon in one video! 🌈🌈🌈🌈💜💜💜💜💜
No coca cola only water
Just my opinion but this song is not it. This song is giving me summer sales at matalan.
Gurl if you sing about a cinched waist and 6inch heals... don't go wearing a waistless bodysuit and 2 inch heals!  One of those not so great songs written in 5 minutes
Addicted to this!! <3
Love it
Don't like this 1
MAbEL 🥰😍🤩
Mad Love is still my favorite song of her. This one is kinda boring.
I LOOOVEEEE THISSS SONGGG
No one is talking about the song that was in the radio "Mabel- Good luck"
My girl 😘😘😎
she clearly sold out, she gonna get popular watch 💀
Very underrated song. Hasn't done well at all in the uk charts which is a shame. Reminds me of the 90s
IN FUTURE GIRLS WILL WEAR MABEL LIPSTICK
DUA LIPA IS MOTHER OF : MABEL
I LOVE LIPSTICK MABEL .
Nice
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!❤❤❤
20s version of Snap if anyone remembers rythm is a dancer, can't pinpoint nowhere as big a tune
Definitely the new JD Sports tune😂I dare you to go in!?!😂😂
2.1M
omg people actually like this?? that's it I'm moving planet's. Ffs people wake tf up
please upload again - has parasit
Spice Girls anyone ?
Spice Girls anyone ?
Absolutely trash
pov you’re here from the tik tok ad
🌎
Another great song!
Mabel should do a song with Little Mix
She shows so much omg!!! My mom would kill me if she knew I was listen to this stuff…those words
I have never fell in love with a song in the first 10 seconds before now
Club banger 😍 Usually not into this kind of music, but when it is mastered by Mabel, I am totally here for it ❤️❤️❤️❤️  One of the best singers and performers and dancers EVER ❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖💖
😍😍😍😍
I LOVE ITTTTT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
love it
Definitely flavoured with sprinkling of RuPaul's 'Supermodel' in that intro, bassline & main hook.    😉👌
2:34
HINO
You like that / early in the morning
NEW ERA YASS
Nails shine like christmas. 😂🤣🤣
Future Nostalgia Dua Lipa 🇧🇷🇧🇷
I miss her old music like thinking of you was such a good era. This is generic.
This beat sounds cheap and cringey as shit, giving very much soundcloud 'producer' with only 4 followers, but for some reason it's growing on me. not because it's good...but because it has charm
Supermodel ‘s Rupaul sample? 🥰🥰🥰
wow love this song <3
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so dear mabel, about last night is the name of the album and good luck the name of the next single ?:)
Love it~
I'm not sure why people like this song?? the beat sounds like cheap soundcloud disco
You realize you're old when you understand she is Neneh Cherry's daughter!
BOOPPPPPP!!!!!!!!
When she says "Doja" "and "Coca Cola" 0:38 Man that pronunciation, she sounds so latina there
Mabel is so underrated! And OMG she looks like 90s Geri Halliwell!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
It’s like we’ve never evolved since like 2014. I LOVE IT!! Please collab with Disclosure, or Gorgon City. That’d be so dope!
The intro sounds like Rupaul's Super Model.
I just wanted to come here and say ITS COMING HOME 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Love love LOVE this... but why do I have to switch off captions every time I play it? Halp
WAIT ONLY A WEEK AGO??
oof this late 90’s/early 00’s club beat is hittingggg 😍
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
The queen never disappoints ✋😫🔥🔥🔥
A Anitta do lado de lá.
Someone is learning something or two from Taylor Swift's Easter eggs 😅❤️ I assume that the next single is Good Luck and the album title is About Last Night? Love you Mabel ❤️😍
Mabel is the new Kylie Minogue <3
Buongiorno
This song is fucking terrible.  Please just stop playing it on the radio ,as I hear this at work everyday and now I'm taking xanax .
This sounds ,more  a sat night game show.  Piss 👋
Oh good lay
This song is hilarious 🤣🤣 sounds like straight tiktok cancer shit 🤮
This kinda sounds like Hallucinate by Dua.
Body shaped Coca Cola - reference to Inna?!
Very very nice 😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😛
I love Mabel and I love her songs and I love this one a lot and I can’t wait for more of her songs much love Mabel ❤️❤️❤️!!!
London accent
Mabel é nome de biscoito
She is way underrated!! She is so talented! Mabel we love you! And what an amazing song!!!! x
Please tell me she Is going to have an album with this type of sound! I love every minute of ittt ❤️❤️❤️❤️ SLAAAT
No.1 🌟🌟🌟
Mabel be out here channelling her ginger spice vibes
This looks influenced by Onlyfans. 💯
Mabel in that pink dress is so underrated 💗
am pushing the big 5 0 and luving this!!
A RUIVINHA DE MARTE TÁ DIFERENTE
"You can call me Khalissi" I loved it!
Your music is impressively amazing and outrageous ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hey🎉🎊
This S*** fire 🔥🔥🔥
This the same girl from the RING RING song?
Rupaul influenced
Am I the only one who hears Supermodel by Rupaul on the beat?
Feel like Spice Girls is back
Ei su a i Lula da Silva valta pra melhorar
HAPPY PRIDE
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Has anyone else noticed how she’s copied one of doja cats hairstyles from bottom bitch 🤷🏼‍♀️, love Mabel but I feel like this hair doesn’t represent her enough for her style
Love
Amazing Track. 🤘🎆
I love it  wouaw!!!  i do the choreo  in my Zumba class.❤
This song DESERVE more hype❤️❤️❤️❤️
Her British accent never fails ♡
Mabel is insanely gorgeous💖
Waiting for a banger like "mad love" from her 😉😉
A melhor 💜🇧🇷
A melhor 💜🇧🇷
Finally some actual dancing in the video as well besides twerking. This song is very catchy
PATROAAAAAAAAAA
Alguien que escuche a Mabel y hable español? 🥺
New Album to be called About last night 👀
W.o.W
Song for gay
When she first came out I loved her but now she's feels like a carbon copy
I feel like such a bad bitch.   Even more now.
Excellente musique
OI   BEBÉ

2:13 💔
My new #1 fav song

Amazing !!!
Oiiiii

pride anthem 2021 please
love u from India
There needs to be a remix version with saweetie
chorus thoooo!! this song is so cool!!
It's a new day.
So powerful!
Damage! Mabel's on 🔥🎶!
who is this drag queen?  She looks good, but you have to admit this song is crap.
If Kim Possible and Shego had a child
Hope she keeps this vibe
I love your new songgg it's the best song besides #DONTCALLMEUP I'm glad you had fun I listen to this song everyday to support you and your hard work
I'm so happy this time of upbeat music is coming back. I love this track.
❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Im probably the only one who doesn't like this song
Muy poco apoyo tiene este tema
Amo a Mabel, pero creo que tiene que ir por otro lado (renovarse o hacer otro tipo de ritmo musical), siempre terminan mal los artistas que hacen siempre los mismo. No es hate, es una opinión con buena onda, Igual me encanta 🧡🧡🧡
✌✅💯✔️✔️
I absolutely love your song what a bop
WHAT A GREAT SUMMER BOP!!!!!
Love this song first time see Mabel i think she on the top road
The perfect song to brighten up a rainy day 😁❤️💃
this NEEDS to be a Drag Race lip synch song!!
I hate you
Honestly speaking This is her only song with which I'm not super impressed, anyways truely love her music, waiting for more songs to be released 😁
I don't like Mabel anymore she cursing please don't get upset just because I don't like something you like ok please this is just my opinion thank you ^_^(◕ᴗ◕✿) and let them know you are bad
I like her not anymore
1,5Mio
The most underrated singer in the industry.
She's been white washed and auto tuned to fuck. Sad
Loveeee ittt
Да интересно
🇧🇷❤️
Who is the author of this song? I can't focus on anything other than listening to it. Unbelievable ❤️❤️😭
She’s fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Queen!❤
exciting teasing erotic delight
Love this!!! BOP! ❤️❤️
😘😘😘😍😍😍😍🇦🇷
LET THEM NOW!! :D
she improved her dancing so much!!! I'm shooketh
Mabel, um oferecimento, rosquinhas de coco.  Is my business. :v
Xcellĺĺ
THAT WALK WAS SO CUTE
Lool the blonde hair scene
https://youtu.be/ZIKE5m2-30I
Mabel it's so  good 👍
https://youtu.be/Oj74A92SkjQ
this song reminded me so much of Geri Halliwell when i heard it first. her hair is exactly like geri's! so fab
I think chorus could have been longer.
Playing that devilish laugh over and over again ❤️
Can't stop playing this song and Alfred Beck - Shadows 🔥🔥🔥
forever my queen
Is ‘About Last Night’ the album title or somethin? Would be a good one, here for it
Mabel is amazing
Lol is this shit😂😂😂
🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🥳🥳🥳
GOD IS A DANCER 😜
Good luck
She looks like debby rian
Neneh Cherry's daughter is growing up excellently <3
garbage song
Ginger Spice vibes
Jam❤️
🇮🇩I from indonesia I like it
Good luck
https://youtu.be/HqL5f8wLyGE
So good, I im love with the song from first minute
Let them know~~ She looks a bit geri halliweel with her hair
Serious Geri vibes goin on.
Mabel is an amazing artist and this is a pretty decent track
I love mabel so freaking much !! She never fails to make good music that's her extradionary talent !! 💖💖💖💖💖
Sounds like a rupaul song
Yessss this is servingggg
*Good job*
Good song.
All I can hear is Rupaul Supermodel- You better Work! Definitely sampled from that. 💜
Queen ✨ this song is a banger 🔥
Is ABOUT LAST NIGHT  gonna be a new single or album name ???
Love you SO much Mabel!!!!❤️❤️❤️ #LetThemKnow
LET THEM KNOW --- LILAC :D :D
the queen will drop some banger after banger!
the only the part that i hate here is that this song ends
nice one
Mabel Future the pop
You're such a queen!! this is the pop we needed thank you mabell you slayed the choreo
Queen♥️
Is more like a Demo or unfinished song...Love Mabel but i love more her old music style....
The radio at the end said Mabel - Good Luck is this her next single!?
am i the only one who hears RuPaul " Covergirl " in the beginning ?
Mabel I love it, I love you more tho🤩😍🥰xx
that green outfit was an awful choice. how unflattering
Музыка ничего, а вопли дамочки бредятина полная👎
this song so hit dmm baby
You are great 💓😘mabel the best 💓💓💓
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Queen 💜💜
Gaga vibes
when people find out what thay say huh?
Yes hunty. The 90s and 80s are coming back.
Why?
Am I the only one who wants to be into this? But still find it very strange? 😂 Hopefully it grows on me. It's strange the way she raps
I prefer NENEH CHERRY!
This is absolutely dope!!!
Great voice + gorgeous! She doesn't get enough play here in the states. Jmo
the lyrics shocks me a bit but it makes you want to dance
That RuPaul sample to kick things off tho...
Yas queen!!!!!!!!!!! End of Pride month with a bop!
O hino tá aí. 👏🏽😍🇧🇷
We love U Mabel 💋💋💋💋
MABEL FOUND HER CONFIDENCE: hidden behind the darkest Moon is a shining 🌞 🌟 STAR. ✨✨✨
😎
Fake voice, fake nails, fake hair, and oh so very bitter.
omg mabel i love thisss u hit this eraaaa
Jesus loves you he was crucified for you stay strong
The chainsmokers- 'Paris' brought me here🤣
Song is trash, respectfully.
🇧🇷🇧🇷
Mabel :  M : Magnificent A : Amazing B : Beautiful E : Extraordinary L : Lovely
This song isn’t charting well at all, hopefully her next song will be more successful.
Omgg my favourite pop singer is back🥰🥰🥰Go Queen 👑 We love you!!!
How good s Mabel, Is she the next Madonna or what?
Super song
nice
very fantastic
Wonderful, "TOP CLASS" moves and performance by a great artiste to a beautiful sound. World class!
don't start now?
💪🏻
Omg
She changed. She sold out. She said she would never do this’. As soon as she got scared she won’t be famous 😓 I love when she was unknown and into 90s fashion. She made authentic music. I had so much faith in her future but I didn’t believe she will sell out and end up selling sexy. I’m so bored of woman call I’m each other bitches and have ass hanging out wearing homeless neon half clothes. Wtf is happening to the world. Can there be a little more originality please? A little more of other music not he same shite using the same formula that must have the words money bag and bitches
Is Mabel transgender
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is Megalovania but Mabel's twist
Another banger
really "About Last Night"? maybe she's giving a clue to her fans about it was next singles or maybe the title of second studio album or maybe as possible is both singles and the titled of her new album next
Mabel kills the dancefloor  & catwalk this year
Let them know you didn't come here because of tiktok❤️
Duplicata Dua Lipa
Lady!
Oh c'mon she served. Lit as shit. One of the best pop songs of the year for sure
This slaps
This is like a very surprising serve like ppl should be scared !!!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClkZpXD1DHnw2cFUWgR39gw
How much energy !!!🕺  Gorgeous Mabel !!!😍🔥
This Amazing Track got so much Energy. Queen on the dancefloor, and a Magical Voice.🤩💖

..HAI  SA_I  CUNOASTEM  PE  EI

💃🏻✨❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍🖤🎼

🎶🎶🎤👌🏻
👌🏻✍💋
this song is addictive
Is Friday Friday !
You can have everlasting life and be saved and forgiven all your sins if you believe in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour 😊💕💖❤️ Jesus died for our sins got buried and rose from the dead ❤️ read Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 they are prophecy’s about Jesus written long before the crucifixion and can be found in the Old Testament or on google ❤️😊 also look up the prophecy of tyre  and what happened ( really do if you don’t believe in the real God ) repent toward God and believe in Jesus Christ if you have not and if you do not ❤️💕 do you know where you will go when you die? ❤️❤️ when it comes to truth don’t trust the lies from the ones called roman catholic’s or orthodox and I mean no offence ❤️ but they are not biblical in many things and I’m not saying they lie about everything but it’s just better to read the Bible for yourself then listen to a roman catholic or orthodox priest I believe ❤️  and I have lived in and one side of my family is from a orthodox country so I write from experience ❤️ My tip is to start with the New Testament ❤️💕 God bless you and your family 💕❤️ and if you are Muslim read surah 18:86 without the editing from the commentator ❤
the chorus make this track.
Garbage looool
I LOVE IIIIIT
One million of views!!! 🎉🥳🥳

Such a banger!
Mabel is so gorgeous and beautiful, she's like a top model who can sing! ❤
I understand why she reminds you of dua lipa. Yet, am i the only one that at this MV i get Britney spears vibes?
Why did the start remind me of Fake Taxi, am i disturbed? Good song tho
Te amo❤️
So no one gonna talk about the  “Say so like im Doja” We love when artist support each other
the new single from mabel is rhythmic dance is great to calm him down dry🎼🎤💓👏❤️
I love it but it  should  have  30M by now

After 2 years Mabel got atleast  5M subscribers
Sweet twerking
You're that bitch  Mabel I love so much ❣️
I love this music is so much fun to dance to and I love you hair ☺️
I don't see any evolution with this kind of music .. it sounds always the same ...
Possibly the worst shite I've ever heard.
I’m love 😍🥵 amazing as ever
Why is not one mentioning the start 😂 😂. Fake taxi vibes. Even the cabbie guy sounds the same
She mentions pin up poster which could reference Zara Larsson, Say so like I am Doja would refer to Doja Cat and Icey wifey could also reference Saweetie so maybe that’s the three collaboration on her new album!! I don’t know just a thought!!
Thx Mabel for the best singer ever
Aws
I really love Mabel  she’s really beautiful and talented
I choreographed to this on my channel and posted a tutorial if anyone wants to learn a dance to this INCREDIBLE song 💃💃
Song of the year? Yes
The way she found her phone where it fell the night before. That's a classic. That can never happen in my country.
I love thiiiiis 💃🏻🕺🏻
Mabel always brings awesome songs with her, I really love that Girl 💕💕💕
her looks is totally change...love you mabel 🥰🥰🥰
I IOVE THE SO
Early 00s vibes with that chorus, can’t put my finger on it 😂🔥
The fact is that all clubs in my country are closed now.
I kinda love it
Ummmmmm... Eat that 🎂 cake..
Ameeei!👌👌👏😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
lights, makeup, 2 chords, sound effects, autotune, BORING!  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I want to leave in the Uk side of pop 😢❤️
Why is this song so familiar? The beat I mean
<3
Absolutely 🔥! ❤️
I love Mabel for life
Love it!
Wow! Another white girl that sings and do vulgar music videos... Never seen that before in my life.... Hint hint. Sarcasm.
why this not blow up yet... its a whole banger lol
That taxi driver sounds familiar...
I’ll head to pride party and put this song on repeat and louddd
This is her best song Ngl? My opinion
Nice 🔥💗
Yesss!! 💕
Tbh glad I clicked this link
Sounds like Supermodel in the first bit
uma vibe disco
816k views is very below average, I don’t know why her song isn’t doing well.
“money long like beaches” ???
Maybe I’m in love
Check out #moosetape album by #sidhumoosewala

I like Mabel and this song is fine, but....need something better to compete with Olivia, Dua, Ava, Doja, Bebe....complicated !!!! I hope gets the recognition
Has anyone noticed she has lost  some weight.....compare this video to her previous one "don't call me up"
THIS SONG ITS FIRE!!!!!! I LOVE YOU MABEL
New sound of Mable
Endlich neues Lied
she saw Dua and said ‘lemme copy this chile’
I don't know what she was doing on this track not the usual banger but I'm sure plenty will just not for me
Hello just dance 2022 song 😍 #justdance2022
the next one who has sold her soul to the devil... but nice song 🙃
Sounds good 👍🏼..  search instrumental this song now..
Here for Kanaan
Fake taxi opening the music video 🤣
GREAT
She looks so happy💕💕💕💕
Guys!! This might just be my imagination, but I think we have here some clues about the names of new songs! 2:51 - 'Good luck' 0:13 & 2:55 & 2:59 - 'About last night'
I’m guessing the album is gonna be called About Last Night
This needs to be on JD 2022 ASAP 🔥🔥🔥
I love you are the best girl to sing that I know then your songs are wonderful especially this one!
This banger is addictive
🔥🔥🔥
Fake Taxi vibes or what? 😂😂

1:45 that sass 😍😍🔥🔥
I wanna hit the club NOW
Mabel saved my year with this banger 🔥
Es como 7 rings de Ariana grande pero con Mabel 😂😂😂 xdd
Loving it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you❤
When she was transitioning to this eletropop style, I was SOOOO SURE that this was a move of her record label and producers, that I really didn't apreciate much. BUT DAMMN I guess I was wrong, she's reeealy delivering. And this kind of compromise, can't be just a imposed thing. Wish u success boo. You deserved it <3
What the flying fuck did I just listen to
Terrible song
Mabel is coming back 😍😍😍
Am I the only one thinking Ru Paul Drag Race anthem !!  Yaaaaas girl
I love you very much too song
Amazing dance track
Mabel’s got a bangerrrrrrrrr 🤩
🇦🇷👑❤
When she said 'Say so like I'm Doja" I felt it really hard! 😍💯 PLEASE plz Doja make a remix with your rap part like you did in 'In your eyes' with The Weeknd! 💖🥳
She boss
a collab with Raye ???
'Say so like I'm Doja'? Gurl we need a Mabel + Doja song now!!  She's bringing the Retros and Discos back like Dua and The Weeknd  wait... Mabel : Good luck?? (in the last scene) She just gave us another song away at the end
What a banger
EXCELENTE NUEVA IMAGEN DE LA TALENTOSA MABEL, UNA ESTRELLA DE SABOR LATINO, DE ALTO RANGO ARTÍSTICO!!..😍👍 🎧⭐🎵✨🎶✨✨✨✨✨✨💫☄️⚡🌟💋💕❤️💞
Okayyyyyyyyy Mabel !!!!!!
Te amo
Mable had changed a lot
00:19 she looks like her mother Nenneh Cherry so much!!!
oh, the best song of the year!!!!  love it! <3 <3 <3
😢I’m not good today
She's way more confident nowadays, it's very nice to see her bloom. She's ready to be a festival headliner 💫
😳😳
A classless Dua lipa ;D
I can see every drag queen ever lip synching to this fucking TUNNNNEEEE 🥰🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈

THIS IS SOOO ICONIC! 💕
She's too good ♥️

Perfection  Perfection  Perfection  Perfection
Ahh! the cheap Ariana copy
Pancakes 🥞.
Dance with this song. Love it!!!
Same old  over sexualized music video 😴 Female singers must respect themselves more and stop stripping off.  Good music does not need less clothing . Just saying.
Sooooo harddddddddd 💕💕😏😏😏😏😏😏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rhyming business with business.  Next level creativity right there.

"Body shaped like Coca Cola" I shouldn't have laughed 💀😭✋🏼
Tengo  Fiebre! :)
My friend just sent this song to me and I didn't like it🤮🤮🤮 It sounds like a song that five minutes crafts would use as a background music🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
A FUCKING BOOOOOOP HOW IS THIS NOW BLOWING TF OUT
Waiting to hear this in H&M after quarantine
oh hell no, don't let this song is underrated i love dancefloor of Mabel
Zzzzzzzzz
about last night
HIT 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I am moiz...
Hope she will be touring in Germany 🙏🏼
I love 💕 this song.
She's officially in the list with the biggest female pop stars of 10's and 20's! #wigsintheair
SHE SO UNDERRATED
This dancing reminds me of riverdale
❤️ u mabel😘😘😘
I love your old style. This styl is not good.
A good work out song
Wow a banger! I'm voguing the house down BOOTS all the way to my bedroom. 🔥 JAJAJA
i love it
I miss the old Kesha. Wonder if her sound would've evolved into something more sleaze glam like this. Her song with Taio Cruz has hints of this. Liked this Mabel very much!
Great new video Mabel
Anyone else here the supermodel by rupaul sample at the start??!
Every day baby sounds good
BRASIL
YES MABEL’S BACK!!!!
Mabel’s killing it again…..All girls to the Baseline…..😉🔥💋🕺😎🍹
I would ask what's the name of his man in the vid but it's ain't none of my business :(
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥👏🏻👏🏻🤜🏻
So both Mabel and Raye gave up on r&b and went to dance music 😭
Why does music FKIN SUCK MORE EVERY YEAR.
i like most of her songs but this ones just not right
1 million views
She’s a little sloppy. Good song tho
THIS SLAPS
Main pop girl NRG
Heard this song in a Ad the night on yt & I love it q * q
KATE HUDSON CINEMA ITALIANO 👀👀👀👀

*i wish they ddnt change their dancer.*
Happy Pride Month. 🏳️‍🌈
Getting Britney Spears vibes from this video, choreography 👌🏼
O que fizeram com sua voz? Não gostei 🤷
mabel sang her new single brilliantly
the beggining looks like YOU BETTA WORKKK from mama RUPAUL!! love it
Yess this is taking back to my childhood. So many memories. Mabel is so amazing. This song is firee 🔥😍
I love this song already and it's my first time hearing 😻💓 this is my summer 2021 song 😍🥰💕
This is a total banger. It deserves to be #1 all over the charts
💚💚💚💚💚💚
My dance teacher is one of your dances mable 😊 her name is Megan and I think I saw her in this vid she always talks abt filming with you!
This song is so catchy!! It's going to be a great summer tune!
Electro house esta de nuevo  Suena  super  original.
Mabel giving the gays what they want, as usual. She said "celebrate pride bitches"! YAS <3
Serve my queen seeve
Blonde like Khaleesi, not Kelis. Might wanna fix subtitles, otherwise, this song and video are perfection!
😍🥳💃🏻🔥bangr
good luck...
about last night...
YESSSSSSS
overgeproduceerd
What a bunch of overproduced shite
Wow another great song x
sounds like RAYE 🥵🧡
Whoa, at the start (a few years ago), it felt a bit like she was lacking stage presence like dua lipa, but just in this video,you can already feel her confidence and stage presence has improved so, so much. She's working hard and its showing!
Terrible song
What in the business is this lol
If this was Dua Lipa's then it would be a massive hit from day 1 Mabel is underrated..
This would have won Eurovision!
How much of the vocal is her real voice
Mabel's best look, best moves, best song and best music video at all. She's simply marvelous ❤️
✨#AMEN 🤪this song makes me happy
Best song for chilling
Wow. Talk about leveling up👀👀MABEL CAME THRU!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Wow Mabel what a great song can’t wait till u sing it live 😍
Wow! This is a bop
so much attitude! Bitch you better werk!!!!
I spend the whole day singing this song
I’m here for it 🏳️‍🌈

This is a very different sound for her, she looks amazing.  But I don't like it 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Starting with FAKE TAXI
Queen Mabel
Yes queen!
Good one
Mabel is a great singer and a great dancer🔥❤️
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven.    God bless you.

Mabel
Hi
Yes Mabel Is Back
I love her doing dance/electro- pop hits 🙌🏻
Seeing elements of Dua, Ariana and Kylie Minogue in this video and tune and i love ittttt
yaaaaaaaas
OMG, LOVE IT
yes yes yes.... we got a super song from Mabel after a long time.
How her skin soooo much lighter than before ?
serveeee
“ and his name ain’t none of your business “ ... okkkkkurr Mabel
I think we can all agree that the beat is similar to Dua Lipa's "Hallucinate"
Love it sis cofident❤️😍
Mabelllllllllll🤩
am i the only one who hears rupaul supermodel
90s vibes here 😎❤️
Anyone else think the opening bars sound like "Supermodel (You Better Work)" by RuPaul. Absolute banger - too short and needs an extended mix!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 with love from Russia!
Waw girl thats perfection🤩
Mabel this is the best song of the year❤❤❤
Wow what's happening? So many transformations for me to handle. I only just got into Mabel last week. She is definitely doing her own thing. Like she said below, it's a new era. So time to change the sound, movement and style and let Mabel be the pioneer. Need a bit of disco to wake up the industry.
Workkkkk Mabel 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wowwwww, I DID NOT expect this! I love it!!!! I love to see Mabel confidence grow so much too!
Awful lyrics
I can’t stop watching this 😍😍😍 Love the song Mabel! 💫🏆1️⃣
I live for that Supermodel sample that she used!
such a cutie pie✨
Let them know she came to slay
A bangerrrr
*strong bad voice* business, BUSINESS, and business?!
0:38 SAY SO LIKE I'M DOJA 😍😍😍😍
This terrible , don’t get me wrong I love her voice and her old songs but this one is like someone tell her to act And dance like britney. It’s not kabel anymore.
1:08 🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn I do feel that this song make her  gonna lose fans I'm one of them
Yessss love this!! 👏👏♥️♥️
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥👍
ronaldo will not listen to it - no coca cola
Here from an ad on KSI Holiday song
bello, hermoso
esto es arte.
"GOOD LUCK" IS ON THE WAY?? 🔥❤️
This song is STUNNING and I died with that split omg 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
❤iT
Okay Mabel I see you girl you went off
Can you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Thanks to all musicians for making life better! I know from my own experience that life can get tough, but if you listen to good songs you can get through it and keep going. Made some playlists for many moments in life. Come listen to them and leave me your opinion. I'm getting started. Thanks!
Another bop 👏
Wait did she just casually do the splits 😀
I swear if this song doesn’t become a hit I’m gonna sue you all
That Mable girl is something I tell u..
Been waiting for this 💖💖......IT WAS AWESOME
*Idk why but for me this songs matches so much with Dua Lipa's vibe, on her voice I guess it would smash on charts*
The intro was giving me big "Supermodel" from RuPaul vibes to a point I thought it was sampling it.  I know Duolingo's looking at her team like 'Why y'all not get this song for me?'
Mabel is a underrated artist.
Can we just talk about that split girl. You THAT BITCH!! 🥰
*Mabel came for the crown* 👏🏻‼
Dua Lipa 2.0
Omg this song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 i love you @mabel
Who else is getting the 90’s vibes from this banger of a tune? I knew Mabel wouldn’t let us down for a dance tune in 2021
https://youtu.be/lpLNRbepzdo
No puedo parar de reproducirlo ! 🍾🍾 Mabel 👸🏼
Beautiful 💯🔥 💖.

Thalia - Amándote ?????????????????????????????????????????????
Is that Mabel dropping Easter eggs? I love it when artists do that!! About last night will surely be the album name and good luck either the next single or one of the tracks on there. Did anyone else notice how she had a pic of her mum as her lock screen too? I feel like the baddest b listening to this tho defo will be on repeat ❤️
Daaaaaaaaam crazy base line

It’s times like this i wish I made reaction videos because I literally screamed YASSSS QUUUEEEENNNNN with my wig snatched jaw dropped, gooped and gagged mama !!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥😜😜😜
Mabel~~
You look like Debby Ryan🤔
Fucking love this right we that bitch!
Fighting
Oha çok iyi
I miss her edgy nonchalant vibe during the fine line days - reminded me of Mutya. Think the management is moving her towards the Dua Lipa’s direction. Still a good song, more commercial.
A Ruivinha de Marte está diferente 😂🇧🇷
This song is a bop and I'm happy for dua cuz she's inspiring other artists but Mabel owns this song and it's unique and not a copycat
🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🥇💣🐳💣
hey me in the future !
This is the Apple commercial anthem. Prove me wrong.
AWESOME 💚💚💚💚💚❗❗❗🔥 I BECAME  FAN
OMGGGGGGG
Sorry Mabel, but you look like a very vulgary and provocative parody of all shobiznis  woman in this video. I know you wanted to criticise plastic influencers on instagram. But you have no right to judge! You're no saint and neither are the other singers. Do you have anything in your past that you should be ashamed of? And about what teach you the new generation in this clip? You to have a mistakes, or problems. you wanna just feed your ego.
nothing interesting, it is similar to PussyCats Dolls. be more original and creative.
Love ittt
Next single "Good Luck" 2:52 New album: "About Last Night..." 2:55
This song is 👏
For my taste there is sadly too much music and sound effects going on at the same time. Hope there will be a remix of this.
The beat reminds me of Rupaul - Supermodel
everyone wants a part of the future nostalgia cake 🤠
Love the song 👏❤👏❤
Loving the Ginger Spice Vibes sis!! Thanks for this birthday present see you soon! 💁🏻‍♂️✨😘
This gonna be my isolation anthem for ten days woop

AS REFERÊNCIASSSS
Yees ⚡⚡
Ksi released a song 1hr ago more views than this already 🤣
Sis his text bubble green though lol
Underrated Queen
Loveeee it
she came and DID THAT 😍😍😍  she deserves the most with this song 💓
2:51 GUYS I THING THAT MIGHT BE A NEW SONG TOO.  GOOD LUCK ACTUALLY IS A SONG IT SAID IT WILL BE ON HER NEXT ALBUM I READ IT ON GENIUS
hidden messages like ABOUT LAST NIGHT, i suppose it’s gonna be the album’s name and GOOD LUCK the next single...
This is very poor. I mean pause at 45 seconds and compare that to what a boss you looked like in mad love. Sort it out. Maybe put on a few pounds slick back your hair again and if you want to improve your numbers just work on your rapping, that is all you need to do.
Your next song is good luck??
Fantasticccccccc
Gente, como eu ainda não te conhecia???
Let them know Mabel  🇧🇷👌❤️❤️❤️
Madonna vibe to this
IF this song isnt playing on my funeral then i dont wanna die
Сool!!
pop music its a little more safe now thank you mabel one of the best summer gift
Love this 😀❤😍💖🙌💕😀
Beautiful Mabel 😘❤️❤️❤️😀
Yasssssss
Self esteem 📈📈📈
YESSSS😍😍😍
Hmmm... I like it overall but it seems unpolished 🤔 The timing of the chorus is funny and the outfits... did they have no money for this queen?
SAY SO LIKE I'M DOJA, AAAAAAA <3 <3 <3
I love it
Dua Lipa ? What ? No girl is Mabel !
I love you 💘💘
Mulher, você é FODAAAAA
Oh my God! Another one (hot).
THIS IS GOLDEN!
Amazing Mabel ❤😍🥰You're gorgeous. I love this song and videoclip.🎼❤
wow wow this is amazing✨
This song reminds me of something I would listen to in the 2000's except this is WAY BETTER
FUTURISTIC DISCOO VIBEZ🎶🎶

C'mon Mabel 🔥🔥
Mabel : Let Them Know  Me : 🏳️‍🌈💯🙈

Mabel serves so hard on the vogue house music 😍 any 90s kids getting geri flashbacks from the hair
It's amazing
OMG WE FINALLY HAVE MORE MUSIC FROM THIS QUEEN!!! 😍🙌🏽💖🎶✨ And also, the first part sounds like Supermodel form RuPaul lol.
Love it ❤️✅❤️✅
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤ love it!
QUEEN
Wow she came back hard! I hope for a whole album full of BOPS like this  🔥the gays are fed
unpopular opinion: luv mabel, but this will be a flop. 1) nobody wants a summer song which starts with the word christmas. 2) the lyrics is really basic and childish 3)the song is somehow not catchy except the part where somebody else sings. 4) loved mabel for years, but this song wont help her brake trough. maybe the next one ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻
Shiningggg baby 🥰
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Years back I predicted dua lipa to become massive around the hotter then hell and blow your mind era, said the same about mabel I think she's about to blow with this new record
summer banger!!
❤️
👑🔥
more support for mabel!!!
Amazing as always ❤️✨😭
Holy shit 😍😍😍😍
She ate that
Summer hit🎆🎆🎆
So glad she found her phone!
Let them know that Mabel is so beautiful ❤❤❤
Eres una magnífica cantante. Me encantó la canción. Extraño demasiado canciones como: "Thinking in You"  o "Low  Key", era un fantástico estilo.

Jai hâte de voir😍🤩 💘🥰
I think she's gonna pull a Dua Lipa, on this one, her mother is Nenah Cherry, she was big in the 90's so idk, i just get the feeling she's gonna have a retro aesthetic, but idk, thats the vibe i'm getting but, yeah- & have a full " Future Nostalgia " era, but with a Mabel twist.
she needs more recognition, this song is gonna be so good
Here before anyone 😂😂❤️❤️
