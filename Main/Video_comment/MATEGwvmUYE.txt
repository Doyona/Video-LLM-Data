Hey, how to download these mods from these 100 days videos?
I loved the first two, but now its just lazy.    First off, why england of all places, and why then go immediately to japan?  It would made sense to be sent to ancient japan, they would have mistaken you for a demon probably since they're isolated and its a natural trap, you can't get out without a really technologically advanced boat. And it fit the asian theme, could have been a going forward in time instead, with the spirit world being an intermission of sorts. Maybe something along the lines of an eye catch video, to get more people interested.  You already went to the underworld apparently, but you aren't against reusing assets, like that wolf man. It would have made more sense too, you had doom monsters and other hellish creatures, would have fit right in. You already show your character has a drive for righteous vengeance, could have been a doomslayer v2 buttblasting the sensei. Hell, have the player sent to Mars. If the sensei is the BBOG, I imagine his train of thought would have been "oh, he survived the SPIRIT WORLD..? He's going to SPACE lol" By the way. I just love what you did with johnny, really well written character in the sense that he evokes mystique and curiosity very well. Since you literally do nothing with him plot wise. No idea what your plans are for him, but I feel like that intermission could have easily been changed. You go to all three realms, you fight the gods that guard the spirit world, seems like an easy transition to eden or heaven or some holy residence. You make it in, walk around and be amazed, meet god or some archangel or whatever, and they tell you your work is unfinished, before sending you to ENGLAND, YES ENGLAND, OR LITERALLY ANYWHERE. Great transition, makes sense,  and it fits the theme of the story, as well as evoking curiosity.  edit - im watching from the start, you went to mars im an idiot why am i even writing this anymore    Second, the plot drive. I mean, for a minecraft stage opera, it has a really high production quality, seriously. More voice actors, animations, mods compliments each other and the story, most of the time. The first two videos, I legitimately thought you had the mod made for this. But the entire, "he's/she's gonna come for you" is trite. Especially that last one with the knight, you just absolutely stopped giving a single **** and that's hilarious in it's own right, aside from me cracking up from screaming over and over again "WHO? WHO? WHO IS COMING? TELL ME". If I were in that position, I would have just made a healing potion machine gun and the moment they say that, I'd spam them and scream that in their face to their unpreparedness and confused fear, but that's just my subjective opinion, not related to the quality.  Third. The "adorable tension relief side character". Personally, I just feel like that's lazy storytelling but that's my opinion, as I don't like tropes and stereotypes, they make writing it easier sure, but you sacrifice precious quality. Also, this is probably a video for children, but I like to think the quality and maturity of a work is an ageless thing.  Fourth, completely unrelated to everything above and absolutely my own opinion; Boris. I'm russian by the way, Boris is a russian name. Not an english one. I'm not gonna nitpick, so I'll just express the sum total of all of my feelings towards what you did with him. ****** you. That is all. If you read all of this mudflaps, I hope you have an amazing day, or evening, whenever you are. No hate towards you or your work. Keep on improving, you magnificent creature.

I love it when you dedocate you life to protect a child girl
This is by far one of the best Modded Minecraft 100 days I ever watched yet.

this was good as always but I wish to express my opinions on the parts I do not like about this video.  so first off is the "maze of tears" which I thought was going to be a one off thing but from this video I'm pretty sure it is going to be a common thing which in my opinion is not so much of a good idea, and the reason why I say that is cuz not only does it just railroad the entire plot but also just turns it into "random quirky parkour for no reason LOL" and that honestly bugs me, it also feels like a cheap way for you to just introduce a popular youtuber into the video which again bugs me.  another thing is the army and house parts of the video which at first got me excited since I thought it was going to be like your old videos where you built up a town and gathered an army to kill and conquer but no instead you build one house that gets burnt down and then decide to rush the whole recruiting an army thing cuz we need to do an epic bossfight soon involving a dragon (a famous mythological creature which has been done to death).  last thing Is about the mobs and I have to admit they're well made if not generic looking, not only that but for some damn reason the first boss of the video is a MINOTAUR with a JAPANESE name which makes me ask the question on WHY THE HELL YOU DECIDED TO GO WITH THAT INSTEAD OF I DON'T KNOW CENTAUR? and yes I know centaurs are a Greek myth but they are ALSO a English myth so it still counts. oh yea I almost forgot to mention on how the Balrog from LOTRs appeared but since it's in the maze I don't really mind it that much, although went you first entered the abandoned fortress and the first enemy was a Doom demon I was just like "REALLY?"  but yea that's my opinion about your video and how I loved your old stuff way more but hell I'll probably watch your new stuff either way.
Can you Bring in crafty to your next 100 days in ancient Japan?
I wish MC vanilla was more like this. Without animations, although they work well for this.

bro this #xnestro an youtube in the maze who had the giant head
Okay, I gotta say something. This feels less like "I survived 100 days" and more like "I told a story about surviving 100 days". There's just so much story crammed into the first five days that I feel like the actual focus of surviving 100 days is a bit lost.
Your plushies are pretty pog and your also pretty pog
At the start you said days but it was still day one
Sick animations bro
Its nestorio
are you from England cus I am and I'm pretty confident that that wasn't what it was like.
This is cool I found another one very similar with this link go watch it  https://youtu.be/fOGEMwgqN20

Send me the link for this
The animations that drives the story are just perfect *chefs kiss*

Nice vid man
If you fear death, read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Rad!

Time for vikings
The writing on the chesplate is Nepali, it translates to murderer's chestplate, some people might say Hindi because the letter you use in Nepali and Hindi are exactly the same. Its Nepali because its Hathyaro ko Chati In Hindi it will be Hathyaro ka chati
If you fear death, read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Great deal!

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus

0:47 "I grabed the kid and i ran" Mud Flaps 2022
Ok this is a great concept with decently good animation. But I feel like this has a lot of problems. The voice acting could have been better and more carefully put together, and along with it saying "frick" every few seconds kind of ruined the emersion (sorry don't know how to properly spell that word) I also didn't have much of a clue what was going on because so many things were happening at once and so quickly going by. Other than that I think this was pretty good.  (No hate only trying to support and give advice.)
Why do you used weopens that are named in hindi
Where's the Boea' O' Waer' ?
Maze runner
love the videos order up a plush just now  😃
The language of armour was Hindi the mother tongue of India
14:5 that is nestor
Not gonna lie I'm hoping sophie shows up In one of the later 100 days all grown up along with Borris

Your sponsor is funnyand the vid is scary

I have some question's 1. Why did zuru open a portal to ancient England and not the overworld. 2. Why did that old man from ancient China send him to soul world and the ancient Japan.
Is it just me or did gandolf get older?
