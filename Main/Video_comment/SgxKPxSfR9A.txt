Apologies if you were watching before. There was a formatting issue I didn't notice and I had to re-upload. Everything was Letterboxed and looked terrible. This aspect ratio is how the video was meant to look.   I added Chapters so you can get back to where you were previously watching. Sorry about that.
3 years later and intimate in pokemon is physical attack not sp defence
Optimus War Crimes
The power of America's spirit
And she’s in the fnaf 2 movie 😂 4:10 FR ITS TRUE
At the end you’ve should’ve put maybe subscribe cuz it’d rhyme 1:50 😂
Intimidate lowers attack, not special defense
16:15 somehow paplatine returned
I loved these movies lol somebody gotta explain the hate
oh i love this, the way they treat the script teels a history of money, fame and complete incompetence, how blockbusters only have a drop of art cause someone in the crew still takes their job serious but it's shadows on what is nothing more than a huge budget and piles of form with no content
I like this movie because Shockwave's in it 😅
honestly my favorite part is when optimus executes sentinal
I’m 24 idgaf this movie was gas
It's a cool movie if you're interested in franchises. You asked why everything lands on Earth, and in another series, there's an explanation: Energon is a rare material, and only 16 planets in the galaxy have it, and Earth is one of them. Even purple Energon, which is Unicron's Energon, and Unicron is the god of evil who resides at Earth's core. Unicron is Earth, actually. That's why everything lands there because Unicron summons these evil beings.
i feel like it they took out sam’s love interest the movie would still work 😭😭 there was absolutely no need for sam to have a gf, maybe we could’ve seen him be heart broken abt mikela instwad of having a whole new bitch we dont care about
6:58  Okay, but was that plot thread also meant for Mikaela?   Cause if so…
2:58 *_O P T I M U S_*
20:33 intimidate lowers attack... So close
Ehren Kruger and Akiva Goldsman did so much damage to Transformers (Age of Extinction and The Last Knight)
20:00 the building sequence set off my 9/11 ptsd. I watched bodies fall from a building on good morning America and I have never been able to handle it in movies.
a well placed goofball is soo funny
Seeing psycho prime is still better than seeing “ don’t do drugs, and stay in school, kids!” prime
Its either this or Hobbit: Battle of the 5 Armies, one again in the 3rd movie theres blood for no reason. No blood in the movies before but its spraying everywhere in the battle.
The best Bayformers movie, 2025. Can't wait for the brand new one in one year soon.
I’m disappointed in you. The second one wasn’t that bad. Especially the goatee forest scene “I’ll take you all on!”
the violence reminds me of how in regular show they realized the could kill anybody if they just blew up lol
Hey this guy sounds like Possible History
The first one and the third one are my favorited movies
I actually enjoyed revenge of the fallen the cast where very entertaining some great fights as for the story that’s where it flopped but overall entertaining
Optimus Prime did not sign the Geneva Convention
0:35 piccolo aura farming spotted
8:00 you acthally can. Hence shows like samurai jack got away with showing brutal deaths and the blood being oil. As long as the character isn't a human or alive you can get away with killing it brutally, like even for R rated films this is a thing. Like in the movie 30 days of night. Scene near the end where one of them is gonna turn into a vampire and the other decapitates him (brutally) the rating board hit them with nc-17 rating cause it wasn't clear yet that the man was turned into a vamp yet. So they had to go into post and add snarling monstor vamp noises so it was more clear he wasn't human, so that they could get the R rating they want
0:34 is that michael imperioli? lol
11:22 holy shit!!  Rewatching this video confirmed Donny T used transformers to stop Iran 😂😂 the plan was right in front of us!
I saw 3 in theaters and it was fricking sick! I stopped liking them at the end of 3 tho lmao
As I was getting interested in the Pokémon, Lord comes up with the transformer, which was why came here🤨
Carly is Australian. Not british.
it’s not blood that’s hydro
If optimus being red was such a problem, then why does Dino exist.
transformers: the dark side of the moon
of the juice got hurt by the h**ler thing XD
Did he forget that megatron flew to saturn in revenge of the fallen?
It’s interesting how Megan Fox was willing to work with Michael ‘Hitler’ Bay later on in the abomination that is his TMNT movies.
I always hated how they made Megatron such an ass kisser and week after the first movie. Like in revenge of the fallen the first thing he does once he gets revived is to bow down to the fallen and call him master ,? Like the Megatron I know would never agree to be someone's servant unless forced to be like with unicorn.
Fun fact: Casey Kasem, who was the original voice of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, was also a voice actor on the original transformers cartoon, but he quit over racism because the cartoons creators came up with a fictional middle eastern country called Carbombia. For real. They actually named a fictional middle eastern country, car-bomb.
You LIKE that final third? I fell asleep during it. Half of it is spent in that collapsing building, with the action going to a dead stop so the stupid human characters whose names I could never remember be allowed to mess around. Then whenever they would die, Optimus Prime appears out of nowhere, kills every Con, and then gets tied up in cables for the next 10 minutes. I shit you not that happens like 3 times.
Fun story - I had to go out to the toilet during this movie. I came back to see that the Autobots were kneeling and captured by the Cons. I asked my friends "oh I guess I missed that they were captured" and they said "Nope, they did not show that. But Sam killed Starscream." :D This movie... Ehren Krueger, the man who wrote Core, should never be allowed to write.
The plot makes zero sense, how Megatron apparently always knew Sentinel was there, he just... did not go fetch him for the last 2 movies? Also, I wish you went into how Megatron is like a Mad Max truck now and is a crazy hobo with a shotgun, infested with Scalpels. It is a really weird design.
10:09 - That hardly started in this movie. Everyone was a mass of polygons and floating panels in 2007 too. Starscream had mandibles like Waspinator and had a body like a gorilla. Megatron was Edward Scissorhands crossed with a shark and a mass of metal shards like the Game of Thrones throne turned into a robot. Even the Autobots were weird and ugly. Prime has a mouth on his chin, uggggh. And then there are the Twins, like someone went over Wall-E's face with a hammer and then added buck teeth and ears.
Interesting stuff about how being a car dealership overseer makes sense for Megan Fox's character. I cared so little about her so called "character" I honestly forgot she was supposed to be a mechanic. I think the most that mattered in these movies is that it let Bay film her sprawled over some motorbike in Revenge of the Fallen.
Megan Fox learned the hard way not to compare a director to Hitler when  friggin Spielberg is the producer... She largely disappeared since then.
I lost all interest by the time this came out. The first and second movies were bad - I never understand the people who say "No 2007 was soooo good!" - did you forget Bee peeing on John Turturro  or the unending masturbation joke, or that all the Transformer dialogue would fit on an A4 page? But by the third, I was just deep in depression and misery about this franchise's movie version. So I did not care that my favourite Decepticon Shockwave will be in this, I assumed he will do nothing and be brutally killed. And indeed, he was! Only says 1 line in the whole dumb movie. And I was not even surprised by Optimus coldly executing his old mentor, and then right after Megatron saved his life, killing him too. This was not Optimus Prime, this was Faceripperus JasonVorheesus. He was a maniac serial killer. And Shia LeBeuf hit peak sperg this year too, so there was that. Add to this the runtime, and that no character resembled his old self from G1 or elsewhere, and like, what would I care about? I watched it once, never again.
I mean, come on, those are big ass powerful robots. of course the dmg they would do is immense. Them dying hurt me a lot, but... I thought later it was normal when you think about it lol.
17:23 Megatron is friends with Sentinel Prime.  I wonder what Transformers One would be like for them-
20:35 intimate lowers the atk stat though
What abt 9 (2009) id say that movie pushed it wayyyy more
I kinda wish it went in the other direction. Optimus and Megatron tag-team against Sentinel
4:23 Fox McCloud lol
Transformers 1-3 were great
nah all tf 1-3 are goated
When I saw this I was a young teenager and I remember loving all the action
Unless he was literally abusing her Megan Fox should have realised she doesn't have the status in Hollywood to demand anything from a director.
After Legends Z-A, Yeah. I'd say Pokemon REALLY fell off. A Dark, Edgy Live-Action Movie doesn't seem that Far off now.
"chicago is an occupied nation" damn that aged well
Bay must not have cared about Megan's comments too much, considering how he literally made her one of the leads when he started his Ninja Turtles movies.
Dark of the moon is my all time favorite transformer film, its endgame before endgame.
idc what nobody say every single transformers movie is good and rewatchable , the only one that has any drag is the rise of the beasts one and I feel like thats cuz the male and female leads just weren't right for that vibe
There ain't no such thing as war crimes when the enemy of your opponent is AMERICAAAAA, BLOW UP THE PYRAMIDS!
Dark of the moon is fire
The original ending does not work for a transformers movie directed by Michael Bay. it's hilarious that the idea was even thought of.
20:35 Intimidate lowers Attack not Sp. Def
Wait, did I watch a censored version? I never saw Blood in this one from the bots
I just realized. I know I seen all the Transformers movie. But I do not remember anything about this movie.
24:40 "oh barnacles, I hate the pill"
The fact that the first movie is still the best, IT WAS RELEASED ON MY BIRTHDAY
4:01 now shes toy chica in the fnaf 2 movie. What the hell?
4:27 Fox McCloud 💀
I kinda liked the movie
3:18  you're right it wasn't a "good" movie it was a GREAT movie and anyone who believes otherwise is delusional
12:42 - I loved that movie! Still remember seeing it in theaters.
Revenge of the fallen was my favorite transformers movie idc
Revenge of the fallen was awesome i don’t care
20:28 _forehead vein bulging_ …that’s not what intimidate does.
I actually loved how Optimus finished Megatron, the cliche bad guy does a good thing and its all done you are forgiven is sooo bad man i cant handle it, but when optimus finished the guy like your shit man i was always after you was so damn cool he did the necessary and thats what Optimus would do
Umm Actually Intimidate in pokemon......
shall we talk about Wheeljack??  Oof…oh Einstein, sweet Neptune what has bay done to you Jackie
I choose to believe they're showing the president scenes from this movie and saying Chicago is a warzone
I would like to add, when they show the Command and service module in space, it is inaccurate, as the LM (Lunar module), should be attached at the front. I feel that’s really the only fault I have with the Apollo section of this movie. Which, while the movie is ludicrous, it still tried to cling on to some realism.
17:02 he’s a funnier character than we’ve ever had!
Excelent analysis . God bless. Jesus Christ loves you!!!
maybe build an all-time starting 5 for every team, but only using one player per season? Especially fun if you factor in form at the time (take ans for example, technically he played in 2021 but that wouldn’t be prime 2020 ans in your team). The expansion teams will have a perfect 5 seasons to pick from (rip chengdu) and you can have 2018 as an extra choice for the initial 12, especially since 2019 was mostly goats and could complicate things.
Love someone else pointing out the violence against robots thing, its so funny. Even Disney does it
1:01 nah that mf deserved the execution 😂
The funny and ironic thing about this movie is that it is somehow the movie that is the most inspired by the original G1 series as it is a loose adaptation of the multi-part story arc called "Megatron's Master Plan". In this arc,  Megatron works with a powerful human politician to conspire and leverage human politics to trick the autobots onto a ship and have it sent off to the sun.
watching this at a time when that Chicago joke is DEAD ON smh (around 10:00 )
this was a video bout a guy ranting on why he hates transformers because he did not like that they got rid of megan fox. shes not that hot btw
Before rewatching this movie, I watched Transformers One first, and man... Megatron's last line made me really sad, considering what he was to Optimus in that film
I know it's been over two years but... Intimidate lowers attack.
Dark of the moon is my favourite movie out of the franchise. There’s also a foreshadowing that I’ve not long noticed, when wheelie is talking about the star treck episode on the tv, his says “this is the one where spok goes nuts” Leonard nimoy plays sentinel who later betrays them… this movie came out 14 years ago and I’ve only found that a few months ago 🥲
Here's rewrites I have that could've made the film better.  -The plot for the most part remains the same but Mikaela would still in the film. -The Highway chase would feature the Stunticons instead of the Dreads.  -The Decepticon starfighters replaced with Decepticons that turn into jets.  -Having Ratchet executed by Barricade but would try fighting back before getting shot would be more heroically tragic but motivates Bumblebee to fight back.  -The Autobot team would have Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Arcee, and Wheelie returning with Wheeljack and Brains as the only new Autobots. Ironhide, Ratchet, Wheelie, and Brains die in movie leaving the remaining five Autobots left. -The main Decepticons would be Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Shockwave, Barricade, Laserbeak, the Stunticons (Breakdown, Wildrider, and Dead End), Sentinel Prime, and the numerous unnamed Vehicon troops. -The ending would be like the original one too with Optimus and Megatron working together and killing Sentinel. Then Optimus and the Autobots order Megatron to leave Earth and never come back.
Slap another fuckin add roll in here
Transformers 3 was the best live action bayformers film.
18:46  😂RIP to all the traffic in Chicago.
I know this video is two years old and I know someone surely must have pointed this out already.   Intimidation in Pokémon does not lower special defense. It lowers attack. A truly unforgivable mistake.
Transformers 3 is my favourite of bayformers
Fun Fact , Transformers 3 was the First Transformers Movie i ever Watched as i was like 12 and i thought they all do very cool stuff
Hearing Cody say "but what if..." in that opening monologue tone made me factory reset my brain and forget that this video was about Transformers and not alternate history
is it just me but at 17:15 the foot is just in the floor?
For a 9 year old revenge of the fallen was the coolest movie ever
"The mountain dew machine goes on a rampage" lmfao
I unironically love this movie, definitely the 2nd best in the franchise
I'M AN INVENTOR 🗣️‼️
4:26 you’re telling me the guy that looks like a 45 year old frat boy that peaked in middle school isn’t pleasant to work with at all? that’s frankly unbelievable
Biggest tragedy of the first three movies is Starscream didn’t have the arc of turning on the Desepticons and joining the Autobots.
-Fox McCloud
21:57 if you notice to the left side of the decepticons face (I don’t know who it is sue me), you can see a stock spark effect near the eye before Optimus rips his face apart. Now you can’t unsee it
I do think that it was, in fact, Spielberg and not Michael Bay. Michael Bay's the new kid. He's fine with people talking crap about him. But Spielberg comes along and informs him that the entire business is built on _respect_ and if he lets an actor talk crap about him, then pretty soon he'll be out of work.  Basically, picture it like a scene from a mafia movie. Because if you know anything about Hollywood, you know that it's run like a mafia.
Optimus WalkemDownTakeTheyFace Prime
My science teacher in middle school was an extra in the movie. He was so proud and  excited to be in it. Showed us frame by frame when he showed up as a running away extra. It was weird seeing my super smart teacher running away from explosions.
Waiting for the Beast Wars video—
The meathead part of me loves the horrifically violent action. It’s so over the top it’s amazing
13:20 calling NASA Big Shuttle is crazy work and I'm totally using that in the future 😂
I don’t know if it’s nostalgia but i actually enjoyed dark of the moon I loved sideswipe and the story it is a bit cheesy but it’s enjoyable
I mainly watch this movie for the military scenes, that captures that feel like the expendibleness of soldiers like they were in a battlefield game campaign,  while fighting in a urban war in a hopeless environment that gives terminator salvation army vibes, or gears of war type stuff.
You forgot to talk about how throughout the first three movies transformers are killed off as their real life GM car/truck counterparts  are discontinued lol
“[sigh] Somehow, the Russians picked up the fuel rod”
Saw this opening night in Chicago and the entire audience clapped when they destroyed our city.
transformers trilogy was fucking GOATED tho, the only bad things about 3 was the flop of Sam and Mikaela's relationship.
I love how optimus loves killing people by removing heads. He obviously listens to the Wu Tang Clan.
Why was the thumbnail about transformers if the first minute is about Pokémon dude like i thought this vid just talking about something else 🧐
0:43 This movie though… 0:44 Is brutal. 1:15 *[glass shatters]*
I absolutely loved the transformers movies, so much fun to watch, although after Bay left i didn't care to watch beasts and bumble bee as I was disappointed we didn't get a final showdown with contessa
11:05 song name?
I think the original trilogy of Transformers was good. It's unique take on the series, and frankly, the characters more or less act as they should and the plot was interesting. I think it did the "adaptation" thing relatively okay. And this is coming from someone who watched tons of the original cartoons and many more Transformer stuff.
I’m sorry revenge of the fallen wasn’t good? I beg your finest pardon that was my favorite movie and the third movie isn’t that violent if this is violent to some people than they really need some thick skin and getting offended over military personnel? Cut me a break it’s a movie about robots get a grip
This is the first time I've seen someone spend more than 5 seconds on Sam's movie 3 girlfriend.
Ima be so honest, this movie was the best in the trilogy and the whole trilogy is good. Yeah there are bad parts, but Optimus Prime carries this trilogy to the top 5 trilogies of all time
21:17
Thats not blood its trans fluid.
Megan fox ruined transformers... shit.
That is so fucking true about megan fox omg holy shit i lost it 🤣😂 just dissappears and then she pops up dating mgk after eminem roasted him 😂 the worlds too small
I think the elites who control all media are slowly trying to blend good with evil. Take Thor love and thunder. Loved it but it had so much woke propaganda in it. Also at one point Thor requires a weapon from Russel Crowe. When he can't get it they resort to killing innoccent characters just to further their own mission. It was a straight up act of murder and they wash it off like it was nothing.
I forgot how much Bay kisses NASA butt in this film.
The first entire minute I completely forgot I was watching a transformers video lmao
Nobody I mean nobody can tell that the first 3 transformers were not peakkk cinema. I am 100 percent on your side the nostalgia glasses are thick aff. I definitely teared up watching iron hide and ratchet get smoked. LOVED THESE VIDEOS
Im an inventor
That’s Patrick Dempsey not Swayze lol.. he was dead by these movies I think! RIP dancing man!!
im gonna be honest because a thought just popped up in my head right now after hearing the part about Megan Fox and I think it absolutely would add a lot more emotional stake into the story. so hear me out    they could've written a new vision for Sam and take advantage of megan fox not being in this movie. instead of needing to have some sort of romantic subplot that im pretty sure not a lot of people were even invested on at all, they could've just written off Mikaela as traveling around the world or something and not being there with Sam. Since they hadn't broken up, they can have him occasionally talk to her on the phone without showing her or even speaking like just on the phone sort of conversation without seeing the other person. This is one of the ways i thought could really drive home the Sam-struggling part of the story as it really makes him feel alone as well, with Wheelie and Brains just being there for some slight emotional support but not really filling that empty void of wanting to be something more, as the movie wanted to portray him as. they could even have him wanting to propose but still be hesitant since he knows that with his current bad luck, he might not be ready for it and it could be a whole thing of building up that confidence again as the story goes, which is something i'll mention later. as for other motivations regarding how they can patch over it, they could've just made Dylan like some sort of fan who kinda knows him and who builds a connection with Sam who thinks that he mightve found his lucky break, still gives enough reason to give him that job recommendation at Accuretta. this fits the next part of the story where Carly gets kidnapped and Dylan reveals his alliance with the decepticons, where Sam thought that he found a friend in Dylan but then that big reveal happens and honestly make the same threat with his parents or even Mikaela as he knows about her using the same watch decepticon and shit. As for why he even wanted to go to Chicago in the first place, it didnt have to just be because he wanted to save his girl. this would be an amazing opportunity for Sam to showcase what he wanted to be as: as someone who can be a hero for the world. We could have him be unreasonably motivated to go confront Dylan and try to stop the Decepticons from taking over the world because of what they did to his friends, the Autobots, and to finally prove that he can be someone special. Now as the rest of that amazing 2nd half happens, after saving the day, he finally builds that confidence of knowing that he can be someone special inside and makes that final call to Mikaela wanting to go see her, with Bumblebee giving the rings as the conversation goes.  i know this part is probably ignorable at best since it just doesnt seem like they would've even tried to rewrite the entire script and that Michael Bay really just wanted that dumb love interest story element. heck, im basically saying all of this because i truly believe that storyline with Carly did not need to exist. this suggestion i made, imo, should give Sam a more personal motivation rather than a generic love interest of sorts and helps builds him up as the hero he can be and who he wants to be on his own accord, which can really settle his arc for good. As for Mikaela, she didnt need an arc at all. she can really just be offscreen for all we care and still have some sort of emotional weight on Sam as he struggles to find purpose. I genuinely think they couldve written a better story for Sam without Carly's presence but I guess thats just my opinion..
Anyone notice how Sam just stole Mikayla’s dog ? Lol
I am a inventor !
I opened this video ( apparently I had stopped watching it like 30 seconds in) and then i see Pokémon and think I’m going crazy
15:05 It's called "Durin's Bane", which isn't less edgy. The lord of balrogs was literally called "Gothmog". You sure you don't need someone to proof read your scripts, buddy?
11:12 well that aged horribly
What cracks me up most about bayformers is one of Optimus’ most said lines is just “You die!” Or some variation of that. Bro skins the face off the Fallen in the second movie 😂💀 like the exact opposite of a Peter Cullen Optimus
This is my favorite transformers movie
This is the best live action Transformers movie.
I watched a few scenes from this movie a while ago, I forgot how awful the CGI was in this entire franchise, and this one in particular. I kinda wish people would stop glazing the CGI in these movies, nothing has weight nothing looks like it can physically do what it's doing. That was fine in the cartoon with it's non-serious hokeyness and low fidelity but the reboot tries to sell itself as realistic.
24:31 should’ve added clips of the 5th movie
Who knew the transformers love Israel
15:06 I’m Wing-Master, the royal scientist!
I want a fight in a corn field.
Im surprised that Optimus didn't have an Ultron psychotic revelation to end humanity upon surfing the World Wide Web at the first movie
But Cody you forgot the part where laser beak kills a bunch of people.
My first movie ever watched in theater, probably my first movie in life.🎉
Megatron would have gotten bored within an hour and started a new war, Optimus knew this and was sick of his shit.. So the ending is good, great even!!
u dont realize something is good until u loose it
12:47 all of us on the ride that Cody takes us on in these masterpieces
The intro made me think i clicked the wrong video
I'm an inventor! 🤣
This movie highkey traumatized me more then I realize as a kid 🤣🤣
(Sarcasm) apparently shockwave orchestrated the attack and  is all shockwaves plan. It’s why they gave him so little screen time they used the giant worm to transport and make it all happen duuuuuhhhh.
I w 5-8 when I seen this. I seen this and star wars 3 in theater as a kid
I actually really enjoy dark of the moon, it’s the only transformer movie I always rewatch.
01:00 that reasoning for me at least applies to all three of these movies. The stupid things are so over the top stupid that they feel intentional, the fun stuff is so over the top fun, that it feels like something you've never seen before.   It's like a fever dream, but in a good way.   If someone asked me why I love all three of these movies I could probably only point to some few things like "robots beating each other up is cool" "SR-71 robot is an sr-71" "Meghan fox was hoooooooooot" but I know it's more than that which I cannot explain XD
finally another person who likes this movie
20:33 NOO! INTIMIDATE LOWERS ATTACK! NOT SPECIAL DEFENSE! THIS IS A CRITICISM THAT MATTERS AND I SHALL NOW DISLIKE AND UNSUBSCRIBE
6:27 sadly a degree doesn't actually get you a job these days. Even in engineering. Thr market is rough. Speaking from experience
20:33 shockwave pokemon
19:55 super mario 64
Unpopular opinion: Dark of the Moon is the best Bayformerd movie, and I will stand on that hill
The first man was an ace film
20:29 serial aura farmer
What happened to the Transformers movies and most movie franchises in the 2000s (I'm looking at you X-Men, Resident Evil), is really what made the MCU such a revolutionary thing for me.   The idea of having the same characters, same stories connected across multiple movies. That continuity made being a fan of the series really rewarding.  Meanwhile, in the Transformers 3, we got Shockwave who's nowhere near his comicbook cartoon counterpart. Amd Optimus is a war criminal.
The island (2005) when?
16:21 somehow palpatine returned
This movie sucked because Megan fox wasn’t in it and here story arc was ruined.
Hey transformers Dark of the Moon is the best movie and I think this movie deserves a 12 out of 10
I watched this series multiple times. These are my favorite pointlesshub videos and dark of the moon was my favorite movie!!
this story youst showes what transformers whas about in its origine. "The alspark crashlanded", "Megatron crashlanded", "Sentinal crashlanded", "The autobots crashlanded"  Transformrs has always been about drunk driving.
I always hated how they replaced a beautiful brunette lady with a bland blonde girl… that’s offensive. You never trade a brunette with a blonde, you trade a blonde with a brunette. That’s how it is.
Why didn't they just... keep Mikayla as a character, but use a different actor? That's what acting is right?
I'll never forget when I moved to Chicago for college in 2010. I was so excited to be studying film in a big city, and this was right after The Dark Knight had come out, so of course I was going nuts seeing all those locations right around me. One day early into that first year, a bunch of us who all lived in the  same dorm hall went out for pizza together, and saw that a professional film crew was shooting something in an alley nearby. They had a GIANT light suspended from a crane, I'd never seen anything like it before. I was so thrilled, and I wondered... could it be the next Batman movie? I approached some of the people standing nearby and asked if they knew what movie it was.  They said, "I think it's a new Transformers movie."  "...oh.", I said.  Then I went back to eating my pizza.  I still haven't seen this movie. Everything I know about it comes from YouTube videos.
This is ideas for my fan. Made live action Transformers movie. I'm crazy.
bro this movie is STUPID nostalgic to me. it's the only Bayverse TF movie I saw in theaters. my mom "snuck" me out of the house at like, 11 pm so we could see the midnight showing. always has my heart
Now I know why Marky Mark and Sir Alec🤷‍♂
Pointless so that you don’t have to… what
Optimus Prime: "I will kill you! Die!" G1 Man Childs: WTF!?!
There is 1 point id argue was more brutal in the very first film that overshadows alot of the violence later, when megatron ripped the lil autobot in half while he was still alive. That scene really stuck with me.
17:16 I just realized that Megatron's feet are phasing into the stairs. They even move. The CGI is literally glitching.
13:18 To be fair, NASA needs all the help it can get in terms of funding with how much their budget has been cut. These movies probably helped fund entire launches and research satellites on their own.
The 2042 trailer reference made me smile (shit game, banger trailer)
It’s truly a shame we lost Ironhide
I often think back to “NO OPTIMUS” before bro gets executed
turns out, when you're not over reliant on CGI you can make it look so much more convincing
17:15 nobody ever notices but megatrons leg is inside the stairs they just left it in the movie, kinda funny looking back.
Every transformers movie is the best
Transformers 2 is fire
What?! 2 is hated? I loved 2.
people always say optimus is a crazy violent sociopath for killing sentinel the guy who killed ironhide, was going to kill  optimus in a weak state and enslave an entire species. megatron in the comic novel is not the same megatron, movie megatron mocked optimus saying " who would you be without me" while novel megatron was like " let me be your partner or kill me now" different context. also movie megatron killed jazz, killed optimus and was going to blow up the sun, or use the  cube to enslave humanity. it was a nice idea of them working together but I think prime was justified in what he did.
Transformers 3 is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen
I find it funny how early on you talk about how Bay likes to film on location, but the Chicago fight is (at least partially) filmed a little further north in Milwaukee.  As a fellow Midwesterner, I get it, but I'm still annoyed.
god i'm sozzled
That Megan fox clip got me thinking Jennifer’s body was a documentary
Ya the war crimes make it my favorite
I have never seen a YouTube video I disagree with more. I would love to debate this
"hard work"
11:20 MAKES SENSE NOW
Patrick Dempsey not Swayze but idk if that was a joke or not
This might be a hard take but for me, transformers 4 is the best of the five
Sentinel Prime deserved it, and you know that mfer was looking for a way to get the one up on Optimus if he hadn't executed him
9:26 Filming a red car, Bay exposed.
Any movie with the NASA logo has direct NASA collaboration
It never ceases to make me laugh everytime you put in that clip of Sentinel dying
20:35 sp def.? My brother in christ…
WHAT DO YOU MEAN T3 HAD IRAN NUCLEAR PROBPEM IN IT?!!!
trasnformers 3 > transfoermers 2
Pokemon is trash man I just liked pikachu
20:46 As a Chicago boi myself... 🥹 Respect. 🫡
"No, Optimus!"  *"Yes,* Optimus."  (commits another cybertronian war crime)
@11:15 it's illegal for Israel to have a secret nuclear program too.  And at least Iran used to allow inspectors, unlike Israel.  Just for the record
13:50 and heaven knows what???
hot take bayformers slapped
It's never a war crime the first time
late comment but I don't have another platform to tell this. I noticed there are a lot of scenes where the soldiers come up with a rushed half-assed plan and try to execute it but 80% of the crew just dies except the main characters. You would think that they would stop trying attack deceptions using helicopters after losing so many pilots and vehicles.
the most stupid movie in all the saga, transformers bombing Iran?, come on man, what's next?, they will bomb Gaza?, Russia?, North Korea?.
I love those movies I really don't care about the bs It's hilarious  It's brutal It's downright horrendously violent And we get to see optimus kick a** and stop the "holier than thou" act
Bayverse is literally the definition of war crimes
My dad would walk 4 year old me downtown to watch this movie get filmed. So that’s pretty cool.
Bayverse Optimus is still the coolest version of Optimus Prime imo.
ITS WAR CRIME TIME!!!!!
song at 1:34?
that iran plot aged well..
0:33 He’s starting to sound a lot like this guy AltHistoryHub, I wonder if they’re at all related
Your reviews have a slop vibe to them, Most of the review you just go "Haha this movie violent" Go checkout Bobsheaux and his reviews on the Bayformers movies, He does a better job at criticizing them and I think you can learn something from him
Deep Wang is my favorite character
11:09 hmmm Iran..... 😅
My TF ratings  Movies:  TF 3 TF 1 TF ONE TF B  TF ROTB TF 4 TF 5 TF 2  Games: WFC FOC TF 2 TF 3 TF ROTDS can kill itself.  TV:  ALL Amazing icl minus Robots in Disguise, that bored the shite outta me (TFP Sequel)
7:11 Another funny trivia of that is when Carly talks with Megatron to put him against Sentinel, they act & talk to each other too polite & close, as if they previously met & have a long story together, which in Mikaela's case IT WAS, heck, in the previous movie he stopped Starscream to chainsaw her directly, yet with Carly they never met a SINGLE TIME in this movie before this moment, the closest to that was the scene of the Pent-House, where they didn't even exchange glances
9:10 I was 12 when I saw this in 3D in the theater, and I expected the same kind of action from the first two films. The entire Seal Off The City scene absolutely traumatized me. I wanted to see Optimus fighting the Decepticons, not the Decepticons blitzkrieg Chicago and vaporize thousands of civilians into ash and singed flesh in cold-blooded systematic fashion.
11:12 2025
Why do people make videos like this.. its not that deep ffs
All the Bayformers movies are pretty violent but sure this one is the most violent   Bobsheaux did a better job at reviewing the movie than you did cause he actually went in depth and didn't just go "Haha this movie violent"  I highly recommend you check out his reviews, Maybe you can learn something
That into about Pokemon is so good, everytime I forget that it's about Bayformers 3 untile the 1 minute mark
What are people talking about? That Iran part aged so well. Like Wine but Red White and Blue wine.
5:35 *hears background music*  me: "ahh i see.. a man of culture"
Yeah I just ignore the 3rd movie and beyond. The first two are a fun summer schlock and the BumbleBee movie can be a fun prequele for whatever if you want more.
Hello everybody, my name is nostalgia critc. Is it the top of the mourning to ye laddies? Let's talk about that
Ironhide did not deserve that death bro
Still the coolest version of Optimus
Ngl, seeing how only 5 years on earth made Optimus go from a chill and patient soldier to a maniacal psycopath makes us wonder how bad us humans we are
The new Iran comments did not disappoint lmaooo
5:47 Shay?
why didn't they just recast her and not address why the character looks different, like other movies do?
12:13  I had this toy as a kid, that thing was badass
"Maybe he's like a pokemon. Uses intimidation to lower everyones special defence." Great video, but I cannot forgive this. Intimidate lowers attack.
"How did the russians get the engine part in the first place? The answer to that is..." The video is suddenly stopped by an ad about an online marketplace
11:11 wait, WHAT? oh no, this didnt age well
24:47 This final quote aged like fine wine.
Ironhide disintegrating was weirdly traumatic for me.
11:12 no way they b0mb Iran😭
7:51 It's not actually unspoken. The rule for brutality largely has to do with flesh and recognizable living things, so non-flesh things (like machines and buildings) can rip apart all they want. Movies and shows that wanted brutality higher than their rating would allow (like the Samurai Jack you show) build their stories around machine violence to accomplish this.
This movie is so fun
I watched a video about a movie from a toy from a show about Robots.
11:11 that didnt age well
That Iran part did not age well
11:02 bro what??? The designs look awesome. That shitty boxy design they had in the cartoons was from the 70s and EVERYONE is glad it stayed there, cause it had its time and place but it was objectively bad compared to how cool the new ones are. If i imagine robots from space, I don't imagine something that i could build with cardboard when I'm bored on Sunday
It's kinda sad that im probably to transformers fans the type of person that I hate in other fandoms, and it's the "Fuck it, doesn't matter it makes no sense, it's a movie fun to watch", cause that how i watch the transformers movie, for example everyone hates transformers 2 apparently but i just watch the movie like "Haha look, big robot fighting" lol, I'm soo sorry to the Transformers fandom, but it is what it is i guess 😅
11:10 no but i remember Donny Boy doing it in 2025.
This didn’t age well with the attack
scrolled down at the iran comment, suprised so many people are watching this to this day lmao
11:30 had to check to make sure this wasnt new lol
11:10 Remember when the Transformers *bombed Iran?* oh dear lord no💀
11:11 that’s now officially real now.
I noticed no one commented about this but the ability intimidate in pokemon lowers attack not special defense?
Anyone know the name of the music on 23:53?
You lost all credibility when you said intimidate lowers special defense. How can you ever be taken seriously from now on
For the last several years we have discussed how deracinated people are, especially men whether they are married or not. This should not be a surprise and it will get more popular. Honestly it would probably be better to show so understanding and empathy, maybe use it as an opportunity to help men and women connect again.
Revenge of the Fallen was terrible, but Dark of the Moon is what made me stop watching live action Transformers Movies.
shockwave IS an edgelord monster who loves torturing people, but that's obviously not the kind of monster they went for
I remember being pretty upset when they murdered my boy Ironhide.
"Remember when the transformers bombed Iran?" Ooh boy history took a page outta Michael Bay's book for that one.  (EDIT | June 21, 2025) No that REALLY didn't age well.
is that a spiro song quietly playing in the background
I have to say that the funniest part of this movie is that buzz Aldrin once punched a man in the face for peddling moon landing conspiracy bullshit, and he participated in this film there there's a moon landing conspiracy, but it's not that he DIDN'T GO TO THE MOON
The cube part here in Brazil became a huge meme It goes like: "Sam me de o cu"  Tl: "Sam give me the ass" Why? The "Cubo" (cube) sounded like cu because of the voice 😂
My favourite thing to do with this movie is swap out all the characters with those from DC. Superman just using a gun to the back of Lex Luthor's head as he begs for mercy is endlessly hilarious.
15:06 aye time to rename myself to balrog562
😐👍
0:35 I don't think Pokemon fans are capable of growing up tbr
I swear transformers 3 is my childhood favorite, no matter how many People think, just peak Cinema.
Honestly, I think the first trilogy is good. None of the movies acting and writing wise are good, but entertainment wise I think all 3 are good to some extent
The Bezos clip caught me wildly off guard 😂
3:17 "Revenge of the Fallen was not a good movie" - Proceeds to show one of the best clips from the film
6:35 I think that joke about Sam getting turned down for a job because Obama gave him a medal for literally saving Earth from genocidal space robots, is the funniest joke in the movie.
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
is this B movie with horrible cgo pokemon commiting warcrimes a real thing?! now im curious!  4:09 okay what is Megan Fox being fed?! thats hard drugs talking and damn she lost alot of weight in a bad way! and the plastics, my god the palstics!!! PLASTIC ONLY RUINS!!!!
I like how they show Einstein Wheeljack leading the calvary charge after he was executed by Shockwave's goons.  It was pretty important to the plot but... wonder why Jazz wasn't included too? Was it a racist thing?
So... if Sam met iCarley in the W.H. while she was working as an ambassador for the British, UK... What did she do in the MEantime before deadbeat Sam moved in with her?  Did she just give Sam a call after she got done boning Patrick Swayze or was she really not that open with Sam about switching jobs?  How could the 1st time Sam meets Patrick be after he's has toured iCarley around the world?... & took pics... & gave her a job?  Guessing Sam was always meant to be Plan B?.. or maybe he just really never paid attention to iCarley when she talked about work... or her boss... or the fact she'd be gone for days modeling on a "work trip" with Patrick Swayze?  Either way iCarley gots some miles on her even before Sam climbed into the cockpit.   Maybe Patrick knew her brother or her brother knew about Patrick's arrangement with the big M & Megatron killed him? So many questions that even once answered still won't make sense.
Put megan fox in there and 11/10 movie
The bayverse is the only transformer media I truely like 😬😬😬
I like the robot girl she is the AI woman of the future 😂😂😂😂
Maybe I'm talking nonsense, but I've never seen Optimus killing Sentinel or Megatron as "out of character", or rather...out of character. Sentinel has proven to be a traitor and to have always been Megatron's ally, while the latter has already resurrected twice (the first time in the 2007 film, after centuries of inactivity and essentially left for dead by the Autobots and Decepticons, the second time in Revenge of the Fallen), and has proven to be a terrible thorn in the side.   Why would Optimus spare someone who made deception one of his main weapons?  Let's remember how Megatron has always taken advantage of Optimus' distraction to strike him from behind, or taking advantage of a momentary numerical advantage.   In short, as far as Optimus is concerned in these films (at least until the third), he's good, yes, but not an idiot.
Try these: Short Circuit 1 & 2 Flight Of The Navigator Men At Work Robin Hood: Men In Tights  You're welcome😊
You did not try to hate on Revenge of the Fallen. It had great lore building, it was adventurous and for its time the Action and CGI was really good. Was it a great I don't think so no, but overall really good.
Giving a 'transformer' testicles and a waving goatee was enough for me to ignore the franchise. Trying to 'more humanize' the robots was a bad move, imo, but I am against 'technocracy', so is expected that it would 'rub me the wrong way'.
Meghan Fox was beautiful before the plastic surgery. Damn shame.
I have no clue why everone thought RoTF was awful, because I genuinely thought it was my favourite film. Maybe I just have bad taste, idk
Dear PointlessHub, Lets see. The Transformers were at one time a MODERATELY Bad Kids Cartoon show designed to sell merch toys to young males, which it did. Bait, then it becomes ( for reasons unknown to modern science ) a BAD First Movie, and that was emotionally moving enough that then became a REALLY Bad Second Movie, but thankfully because of popular demand, it morphed magically into a VERY Really Bad Third Movie, that was honored and admired enough to be reborn as HORRIBLY Very Really Bad Fourth Movie. However ALL of this gave birth to a YouTuber to review it, and somehow, like the great circle of life, all is now good in the land!
18:32 RUMBLING!!!
18:14 delta halo suite or out of shadow? Or the song when they were on the ark? I would spend more time trying to figure it out but my quessadilla is going to burn. Anyway, HALO POSTINGHGGH
How hard is “They landed on it and it got stuck onto them?”   Yeah it’s super coincidental and specific, but it’s a better explanation than the one they give.   “We see that it was dropped onto their probe, one of the reasons they had such a delay was this new technology.” Boom, ties in a less ridiculous explanation and real life as the Soviet Union had probes but not necessarily astronauts before the US.   If they had a shiny new piece of technology to experiment on, it’d make sense space wasn’t their biggest concern
Deep Wang
I actually do like Stephen spillberg and Michael Bay.? 😊😅
I dont think its a bad idea to simply add "seats" for Autobots to a normal Shuttle why should they build a Shuttle made for humans when our technology was fine and to scale.
"Somehow something happened" has been a blockbuster explanation for bullshit for a while, huh?
In my opinion, transformers movies should have fewer human screen times like the G1. The human scenes get more screen time than transformers in tf 2007 to rotb. The Bumblebee movie was kinda fine, but it's my opinion, though.
I like the first 3 bayverse movies I’m ok with age of extinction but the last knight is just….bad
Dark of the moon is my favorite, cause it actually had stakes. They actually had to fight their way back to get the W.
The only transformer that looks good is  Shockwave. Him being a snake goes hard and if we got an actual story about the robots and went with the idea that empurata existed in this universe but more brutal. Not only did the corrupt government takes away your face and hands but also your legs. It's biblical punishment as the serpent in the garden actually had legs and arms but had them taken away by god for the sin of showing eve the fruit
BIG SHUTTLE is way funnier than it should be
20:25 probably would’ve been cool if shockwave was the main antagonist of the 3rd film for a majority of it until Sentinel reveals himself as the twist Villian
I LOVED IT
6:35 - Well, that one aged like wine 💀
I mean these movies were always stupid bullshit with only the purpose to sell toys but seriously Optimus just gunning sentinel down as he's crawling away in fear and begging for his life is pretty fucking insane
Definitely the best of the bayverse
honestly despite how bad the plot seems to alot of people, I personally like the movies. Maybe it was because I only cared for big robots blowing shit up but eh ig :>
It really impresses me the amount of effort to portrait as a completely moron to not understand and make sense of any of the plot details… if every movie explained every single detail in screen time then all the movies would be 200 hours long…
5:14 HOLY SHIT!!! Now that I see her like this, WHY on earth would Fox cake herself in make up??? I don't don't know how she looks now, but she was fucking gorgeous.
im suprised you critisized the second movie that much for me it actually had the most awesome moment of the entire trilogy, when theyre fighting in the dessert and the drone flys in and just sees everything blowing up and the generals looking at it like oh my god send everything in gogog xd
I never get all of this hatred for this movie man. I mean yeah it is not a masterpiece but a movie like transformers has never been done by anyone else since then. It is unique and that’s what I like about it. Cool, good-looking, expensive cars, fantastic, cgi top tier robots, a perfect actor for this role shia aka sam, on the family side of sam a little bit of funninnes, something you can watch with a family member of yours and the overall areas that the movies take place in. I mean yeah I’m down to watch an army fighting against an alien robot breed in an epgypt dessert hell yeah. Why would I call the movie shit. If this is shit, what’s good?
I enjoyed T2 because I knew it was going to be a dumb thrill, like a rollercoaster. So I just turned my brain off and enjoyed the ride.
If anything dark of the moon is most ppl favorite nd it my all time favorite movie nd most ppl say this is the best movie in the series nd mind it made the most amount of money nd it ranks 35 in all time box office nd one point ranked 6 that pretty good but im stop glazing this movie but im just saying this is the best film in live action movie franchise critically and financially
Dark of the moon is my favorite of the live action trilogy, i will not elaborate further lol
i remember watching this when i was younger i should really rewatch it, when i was younger me and my friend took some magic mushrooms and he ended up leaving my house and i ended up watching the film by myself but turns out he forgot to his shoes when he left and i guess he  went to the middle of the dessert got naked and ended up running all the way home idk how many miles but its crazy because his mother ended up calling because he had left his phone and i remember it ringing and finding it in the other room, thats when they asked for my address to pick up his shoes and cellphone.super crazy night i just remember the building scene where the soldiers are falling down it because the robot is cutting through the buiding.thats all i recall from the film
I think the bay-verse trilogy is a masterpiece, but we don’t talk about the later movies
I remember watching a compilation about how much of an asshole Optimus is in these movies. The dude would give Megatron a run for his money.
Michael Bay sucks.
Your from chicago area as well, eh? So you know that michel bay chose chicago to save money since it naturally looks like a destroyed warzone! How clever...on a real note, i got to see them film some of the movie and it was pretty awsome....it was because they had traffic blocked and i was stuck on the expressway for 3 hours
....you do know thats patrick DEMPSEY right? I was never good at detecting sarcasm...maybe all that red dye #40 RFK is waging ji-had against or something.
6:57 Dempsey*  Swayze died before this movie
Great video review, but my inner pokenerd would be remise if I didnt say Intimidate lowers Attack not Special Defense. Which would make sense with the movie and them standing around.
This is actually my favourite movie. Something inside just loves it when Optimus decides that he's just done being nice and executes anyone in his way. Honestly I think Nemesis in TLK is more merciful than Optimus himself. And in the country I live in (New Zealand) all the Transformers  movie are M 16, which means that it's for mature audiences 16 and over. Note that I was watching these by the time I was six
The third one is the best one
I love that despite all this violence, this movie is still pg-13. But show a nipple and suddenly it is 18+
18:33 no mention of the fact this writer was also a former Attack Titan??
Bring back the Cody Cut.
5:08 no it absolutely makes sense that spielBERG was highly offended by a HITLER comment.
Sam was a jerk with Bumblebee in the last movie and i'm supposed to be sad because the robot left him? Nope, can't happen! He was a terrible friend. I'm glad Bee abandoned him 😊  Optimus and Bumblebee still looks like robots while the other autobots looks like humans with armors. I don't like their design! They were better in the first Transformer movie!
But most people who worked on transformers did say that Megan fox never listen to Micheal bay or any other. So yeah...
9 y/o me was not ready for this movie
As good as the original would be, I really liked the one they used cu it’s fucking hilarious
Even the autobots are fighting for Israel 🤮🤮🤮
"Pokémon fans don't seem to know what the word 'grown-up' means."
My favorite scene, probably in the entire franchise, is the scene in rhe tilting skyscraper, just because it is so over the top ridicu-stupid, it's awesome. I absolutely love the battle of Chicago once it gets going. So many great fights and combat shots, and youre right; it really does feel like a war zone. I love how in Age of Extinction, there are repercussions from the war. Billboards reading turn in the transformers, people's distrust for them, all of that. It really made the movie feel like a sequel, but it also added an error of realism.
The problem with dumb alpha people is that they think they are smart enough to solve the issue themsleves. They can't imagine that they need a nerd who loves the material and acknowledge that this person is totally their boss when it comes to write a good story. That is why these alpha's always screw up all these movies. They have to acknowledge they are to stupid to do this task 🙂
6:56 Patrick Dempsey*
TV REPORTER: " Hey robot why did you bomb Iran and kill 50,000 people? " PRIME : " The United States government told me to. I have digital copies of the presidential order  I can E-mail you.
If the robots have AI's inside of them. Why can't they make back up copies of themselves on the internet??
When Transformers came out I enjoyed the idea that Sam had a hot girl friend. However I use to ask " How can you have such a hot girl girl friend and not have sex with her?? "
I remember when this movie came out at the time, some edgy kid at our school tried to brag about how he went to go see the movie and got so bored he walked out during the first 10 minutes as if it makes him cool. After that, people who actually thought he was super cool ended up not watching the movie just because he walked out of it, meanwhile those who did watch had some dumb fun they didn't regret
I Love watching PHub!…p-pointless hub
Nothing will push PG-13 like Speed Racer did 😂
Cartoon Prime = Optimus Prime, Bayformers Prime = Megatron
Dang sucks we didnt get the megatron is now peacful ending
War Crime's do not exist, Law's have no place in War
I assume the website transtheories is wildly different from what I would have expected.
I think Steven Spielberg was offended because he's Jewish, and you know what happens if you mention the Austrian mustache man in front of a Jew.
If you didn't know transformers and someone pitched the idea of robots turning into cars, i would sound pretty stupid ngl.. good execution though
So its like murder drones
first minute of the video sounding like a bottom of the barrel AHH script
Buzz stayed right here. Not up there.
It
I watched this with a friend in high school and enjoyed it too. Idgaf. Michael Bay makes good explosions.
13:44 im an inve-
16:19 “somehow palpatine returned”  before it was cool
17:10 I still haven't emotionally recovered from this
Megan's replacement was so terrible, it was hilarious
Youre not the only one to remember first man. That movie is a masterpiece imo. The soundtrack is great too.
@6:56 That's not Patrick Swayze... That's Patrick Dempsey.
I hate to say this but this is my favorite transformers movie and i love the twins but i understand why people think its bad but i think it still is the second best move but that not really saying much
They used the portals to pull some excess pillars to earth.
Ngl i dont mind transformers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. I also kinda liked transformers one
U call Patrick Dempsey Patrick swayze on purpose? Lol
I know this is an old video. But I just have to point out how funny it was to hear you playing the OST from the Toy Story 2 game where u play as Buzz Lightyear during the bit where there's a guy named Buzz involved. Idk how many people got that joke, but I'm glad I noticed lol
My favorite part of Dark of the Moon is that the car collection place was the Milwaukee Art Museum.
In all your transformers videos I hear you joke about how they have blood now, as if that's what the fluid is and it doesn't make sense  I just want you to know that hydraulic fluid, the thing they would make sense to be filled with and actuated with, is red. Like blood red. Same as transmission fluid etc  So yeah the red sprays genuinely make sense, hope that helps
11:15 why are there apollo era rocket engine test stands in iran, on the left and in the back those are the test stand used for the f-1 engines on the saturn v, i know bay liked nasa but what a weird way to slip them in
Although I had liked Transformers 1 & 2 for their action scenes when I was little, by the time 3 came out I was utterly bored. I was SEVEN when this movie came out and was just sitting there completely bored. This movie is what made me appreciate GOOD storytelling, characters, and world building😂. So for that, I can thank this film ig😂
Pokemon would have ben just a fade if how original creators wanted to end on gen 2. Thats actualy right around the time pokemon fade went away . By 2004 pokemon was not very popular it was only because the games that it stayed alive
That's Patrick Dempsey, not Swayze haha
Dark of the moon was OK, but my favs are Revenge of the fallen and Age of Extinction
That Josh Strife Hayes reference :D
Hydrolic fluid looks like fake blood syrup.
'Somehow the Russians got the ball thing' is giving "Somehow Palestine returned"
I swear, Chicago is only relevant when something stupid/bad happens irl, or it’s getting destroyed in a movie. Even the occasional Christmas movie is filmed somewhere else and just is said to take place in Chicago
I never saw this one, but you’re telling me they made a fascist robot a German car😭
17:14 I’m sorry… but is Megatron’s wheels clipping through the stairs on Abe Lincoln’s chair?
4:09 that wtf was collective
I also like Dark of the Moon, I grew up with it, so nostalgia may affect my view, but I love it.
I don't understand the issue with just having the new girl play Mykayla, or hiring a girl who looks similar to Megan, or just having the girl dye her hair the same color. Seems stupid.
They say The Matrix of Leadership doesn't disintegerate if it is in th hands of someone of noble character. Remember when Optimus handed it to Sentinel and nothing happened? Wow!
DEEEEP WANG… DEEP WANG
The best one IMO. The only one and one of the few movies as a whole I went to see in the cinema 2 times. 9:16 The way it just throws you into the invasion in the third act is brilliant. It's brutal and I love it for that.
“Big shuttle” got me.
My favorite head canon is that when Optimus was revived in T2 using Jetfire's parts, he also absorbed a little bit of his unhinged personality, and in combination with having been dead, it turned him into a little bit of a Sociopath.
okay, so im finally into a comments section. pointless, i get youre past this and im years late but. 1. i dont blame optimus for exicuting sentinel like that, bro literally hid a secret from the man making him alienated by the race he wanted to help. the execution was personal. now for the real reason im here.  in the fifth movie video i believe, you mention how megatron just ended up on earth and sams dad just managed to find him, athough i cant explain sams pap being a witwiccan i can explain megatron ending up on earth. he crash landed. thats literally it, bro left cybertron as the cube did just to enter earths gravitational pull and  it fucked with his navigation systems, telling him the cube was right below him causing the dude to outright crashland in a sheet of ice during the ice age that wiped out the dinosaurs. this was explained in transformers beginnings. a tiny film that was included with steelbook and boxed sets of transformers 1, you should check it out sometimes. it makes only a handful of your arguments fall flat but i enjoyed the series nonetheless. now release the review on transformers one, im interested to see your take on that movie.   -ligma
« Somehow Palpatine has retruned… » 😂
That's Jeff Bezos? How did he go from looking like Gene Siskel to... whatever he looks like now?
23:31 that is… an, unfortunate, name.
Instead of transformers being goofy it was the humans instead lol
honestly probably the best of the transformers sequels just for bring kind of audacious and just weird
Berserker Optimus would beat hulkbuster, mecha Godzilla a t800 and unicron together.
I'm not challenging any of your criticisms, but the way you frame it like, "Dark of the Moon, am I right?" seems like you aren't aware that many people like this, some even more than 2007. The last episode, you joked about all your subscribers leaving because you like it like it's a given that it's terrible, by audiences generally like it despite critics.
You know what's hilarious? I'm sitting here watching this and I get to 7:06 with Bumblebee and the rings and I recognized that part and was like, "Omg I DID see this movie."
Ah yes. The moment when Optimus Crime went around executing unarmed civilians. Truly he is one of the transformers of all time.
22:09 must say i disagree with your take on the war crimes part.   Your mentor betrayed you and tried to off you, you gonna shake hands with him? No you off him for the betrayal.  Same thing with megatron, long time rival you as prime tired of the fighting you gonna off him too
17:43 It makes a lot more sense if the planet where the Decepticon army is buried, isn't the Moon. But the filmmakers had already filmed some stuff on the Moon, and maybe they didn't feel like building another planet.
17:39  In the previous film, Megatron flew to Jupiter to have a chat with The Fallen. The Moon was never inaccessible to them.
17:40 I don't know why but the Halo music in the background here just made the whole explanation funnier
The writers really didn't care at all. That handwaved "the soviets got the engine with unmanned probes" would be tied up well if they just said "the probe likely contained a Decepticon".
Boy i sure am glad there are only 3 of these movies and 2 of them are almost good
"Trans theories".... What an unfortunate name lmao
Pretty much feel the same. Probably my favorite of the series, couldn’t tell you why exactly. Had a great time watching it in theaters with my cousin. Just turn your brain off and enjoy 😎
pokemon is for idiots
24:46 I'm an Inventor!
1:00 No, Optimus! *Bang* Aaugh! *Blah Blah Me, Blah Blah Yourself Cliché*
It's a damn great action movie! that's why. Squirrel suit scene alone was some of the coolest action I've ever seen
I've never trusted Bay, and I never will. I could never forgive him for the death of my boy.*  (*Lawful Good Optimus)
One thing I've learned is that it's okay to like dumb shit sometimes. Transformers 2007 was and is a good comfort movie for me, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon, for all its issues, is just good, dumb fun (even with all the violent robot deaths, lol). The same can't be said for 4 or 5, tho.
7:39 “she was mean, you wouldn’t like her” they def wrote that in once Megan got fired 😂😭
Dude. Patrick Swayze is not in this movie. Don't tarnish his legacy xD
Lets just say the "blood" is just brake-liquid ;)
20:17 when i first saw this movie, I thought that was the most badass thing ever      I still do, that was fucking sweet
18:06 i think the bigger issue is that Optimus Needed the Matrix of Leadership to resurrect Sentinel ya know that Matrix of Leadership THAT WAS LOST TO SPACE AND TIME  this movie really acts more like a sequel to Transformers 1 then Transformers 2 but you need to watch Transformers 2 because otherwise stuff doesn’t make sense but if you watch RotF it still doesn’t make any sense
Back in the day, I hated the bayverse trilogy with a passion. Now though, I think it's one of the best schlock disaster films. It shares this distinction along with Tommy Wiseau's The Room.
Patrick Dempsey.  Swayze had already been dead a couple years when this came out   I'll take my um actually point now
Bah, the transformers been dying since the first movie. Back in my day Megatron turned into a pistol.
I appreciatehow many enjoy these movies. That said they're not for me. Not only am I not into the changes from the 80s source material, I'm not that big on CGI and then the icing on that cake is I was a Go-Bots fan instead. So, I like these reviews; it's not only the onky way I'd see any of these movies but lets me see it through a far less biased lens than my own. I so hope youhave or someday do a review of the original animated movie.
Haha yoo that battlefield theme song was clever asf haha
I'm sure someone mentioned it but the bad guy human Is Patrick Dempsy. Not Patrick Swazey, who is dead✌️✨️✌️👋✨️
Optimus became a War Criminal for the zingers...ala "One shall stand...one shall fall!"
I love this movie
This movie is grossly inferior to Revenge of the Fallen.  I enjoyed the first two movies greatly, and when the time came for the third, I was most excited. Like you with Revenge of the Fallen, I was drawn in by the marketing, and, hyped for the movie, went to see it in theaters...  ...and left bitterly disappointed.
What is this pokemon movie where Mewtwo is trying to manipulate a woman to commit self end?
Funnily enough, when you set Optimus’s rampage at the end to “like a prayer”….it really works! Granted the “you die” bit reminds you which version you’re watching…..but before that….really works!
dude the brutally meat-headed, bikini-models-are-the-only-women-that-matter, nerds and foreigners are gay lol hetero-misogyny of this era of American culture (I wanna say like 2005-2014ish) is just so exhausting to even encounter visual evidence of. People accuse Bay and these movies of a unique kind of misogyny and heteronormativity, and while that's somewhat true (I mean, his movies were the loudest and most obvious), I feel like this incredibly bizarre and narrow way of looking at women and thinking about male sexuality were just fucking everywhere for no reason in the late 00s and early 10s suddenly before mercifully dying out. but god. all that news footage about Megan Fox just brought back violent PTSD flashbacks.
Michael Collins is cool as hell, Buzz Aldrin is a friggin badass, and Niel Armstrong was a genius
I love that movie "The First Man" ya know the Neil Armstrong one. I just don't like the wife in it. Something about her face...idk...
I wonder why they didn't die the blonde girls hair and just recast Mikayla as a different actress
I don’t know how, but I always end up rewatching this series
That Go-Pro on the rifle at 14:03 is probably my favourite technical shot of the movie. The way they hold fire until Optimus is out of shot. It's small and I love it.
First Man was one of the worst movies I have ever seen 12:53
Last 30 min of this film is like a cherry but on poop (not on cake)
What's that? They found a golden sphere from alien origin in The Zone?  HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY, FREE, AND MAY NO ONE BE LEFT BEHIND!
Iron hide dying broke me as a kid
I was in grade 9 when this movie came out and I loved it 😂
3:50 lol
"I'm an inventah!"
1:23 CRAZY way to become aware of this movie
How alleged moon landing was a dancing on the soviets? Soviets were first to send rocket to space, to send man to space, to exit into open space, to launch Earth, Sun and Moon satellites, to send robotic spacecraft to the moon, to plant a pennant on the moon and to unmanned moon exploration. After all these first places soviets decided that manned landing has no practical benefits over АМС program (unmanned interplanetary spacecraft) and declared it inexpedient. Afterall, unlike nasa, soviets did manage to design and build a rover/probe that were actually able to get regolith back to Earth. For the rest of "space race" US was racing itself just to make up for a decade of losses. Then it's been 70 years of bragging about second place, inflating moon landing like it was the final point of some actual race. Hence the feature length nasa advertisement in question and many, many others. Sorry to kill the Aldrin's buzz, but Soviet flag has been on the moon for a decade when the first of US humanprobes finally made it.
0:34 is that Christopher from the sopranos
Hey this movie was awesome after a tumbler of everclear
I still love this movie, it’s not great, but I enjoy the hell outta it
17:15 just noticed the massive clipping of his foot on the steps
Ok ok ok, we have to stop admiring "Makayla's" mechanical abilities.  Especially considering she lifts the hood, sees what it obviously a i.t.b. (individual throttle body) fuel injection intake, fabricated sheet metal valve covers, which usually means race motor, and what she spouts off is generic car lingo she saw in the chevelle scene of dazed and confused.
"pokemon don't just faint anymore, they die" Ah, so you mean the pokemon manga?  Where the notable examples of violence include: Giovanni has his Closter chop into pieces a Magmar that was frozen,  Blue's Charmeleon slices a gym leader's Arbok IN HALF (you can literally see it's spine and muscles) with the gym leader not even being upset just impressed at how strong the Charmeleon was, or when one of the Elite Four decided to wipe Vermillion City off the fucking map having his Dragonair destroy it with a hyperbeam leaving nothing but a crater.
Its ok cody. I remember First Man. Man that soundtrack and how they shoot the space ships is very fun. Didn't feel like Armstrong but it holds a special place in my heart.
I don't care bad guys deserve everything they got. Optimus should've did more if you ask me. Justice for Ironhide
Nah... It was the best of the trilogy with its flaws. I really like it.
Either it was Bay or a Jew
Somehow they got the ~~fuel rods~~ macguffin!  Possibly the original "Somehow Palpatine returned."
I'm sure you won't see this, but I wanted you to know that I finished this video before I rewatched the half in the bag for this movie, so thanks I guess?
Okie dokie.  Love e you. Rlm
They should have just kept her name as Mikkaela and never acknowledged that there was a different actor playing her. Would have worked much better.
lets not forget the fact that prime did just leave to let the megs and the rest to slaughter Chicago to just prove a point XD
7:30 why did you edit Leia over Leia?
Unless you remember "From the Earth to the Moon" you are not that big of a fan of Apollo
Yeah the Mikaela & Sam Plot would've been better. However, Carly is way hotter, so it evens out
So glad I was around for the original series and it’s moving to appreciate them more now that the new movies had been made
8:10 it’s Energon just that it’s red to look like Blood
2:54 Buster from Arrested Development
Dempsey
Transformers 3 female lead doesnt want to be dirty or get scratches.. every time i watch that she ALWAYS have the minimum dirts. Sam have so many dirts while she doesnt.
This movie was the first time i was ever introduced to transformers as a child and the sheer violence of it all traumatized me. like transformers 3 left me with a long lasting fear of the mass killing of innocents like it makes me feel icky to this day.
20:36 WOOOOOW not a Pokemon fan huh? Intimidate lowers the enemy's ATTACK you uncultured swine.
21:37 maybe it ain’t a summer blockbuster exactly but Godzilla 2014 gets close
Who would win, driller bot or devestator 2.0 (first one is the tank one in TF 1, I’m talking huge combiner in 2
What’s that 8bit song at the end of the video, but before the credits? He used it in the moonfall video too. I feel like I’ve half unlocked a core memory with that song, but the hanging chad on this achievement is driving me nuts. Please help
1:51 song name?
@20:15 Intimidate lowers their attack stat, you're a fraud, mr hub
Tf 2 was peak stupid fun to me, tf3 was the last good one.
That "NO, OPTIMUS!" clip is the best out of context movie moment ever 😂 Imagine your favorite toy commiting war crimes.
i only watched for megan fox, the sector seven guy, and bumblebee
Recasting Mikaela(sp?) coulda saved so much headache
You like what you like. Fair enough. This was the first movie that I walked out of the theater.
I love this movie because of the apollo 11 glazing, and because the military is actually competent at taking down decepticons when it matters the most.
Dark of the Moon is the worst.
I Hope It Will Happened in Next Sonic Movie?
Honestly the funniest thing about the entire series was that Megatron got progressively more chill throughout the series after witnessing the atrocities committed by Optimus Prime and still gets his ass jumped every movie.
23:05 wait minute....you mean to tell that we could have a good end to the trilogy and never had to suffer the bastardization of the last 2 films? Damn.
What was the pokemon intro about?
i only watch transformers movies for the giant robot fights, there is just something about big fuckoff battles that just activates my neurons, i always skip the human parts, every now and again i re watch them only for the fights
17:15 Wait, is the wheel clipping through the stairs?
Man I loved it,I don't care if u hate it😊🤗😁🔥🗿👀
Good cgi 🗿
The movies really went downhill after shia left. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't do it
Great analysis of the film. Dark of the Moon restored my hope in the Bay films after the atrocity of Revenge of Fallen. But then Bay let me down again and again. 😢
Transformers where humans are dumb and die...😂
16:43 Now that I rewatched it, I absolutely need to read “Codename Hero”.  Make it happen, John Turturro.  I will personally pay you 50 bucks if necessary.”
RIP Ironhide indeed.
You know how much I enjoy your content?  You referred to "McDreamy" as "Roadhouse" and believed you wholeheartedly.
Someone made a video that was a trailer for Dark of the Moon, BUT scored to one of the Godzilla: King of the Monsters trailers (not the somewhere over the rainbow one). It was honestly beautiful and somber. Highly recommend.  Gave me an idea.........a version of Dark of the Moon (though perhaps given what I am about to say, maybe with a different title) where Bay choose to be a producer, but have someone else do the heavy lifting.  1. If Megan Fox leaving is inevitable, you recast Mikaela rather than write her out.  2. Maybe Sentinel was not sleeping on the moon, but was in deep space, but signals from Earth reached him, and so he came to Earth.   3.  The Autobots are not kicked off Earth. Humans clearly recognize there is a difference between them and the Deceptacons, Optimus has a human fan base, and no delusions that the humans would be safer trusting the Deceptacons than the Autobots.   4. Have the movie essentially be constructed using that video to determine tone. Make the emphasis on the tragedy of Optimus's relationship with Sentinel.  5. Even if its leaked, use the original, alternate ending that was initially planned for this movie (or a complexly different ending. just not what they went with)  6. Have Bumblebee fully get his voice back for good.......but his voice is done by Will Friedle      . After that........if you must have more sequels........well, Transformers certainty has made enough stories that you DONT HAVE TO GO WITH HUMANS TURN ON THE AUTOBOTS! Seriously, at that point, just focus on mining the property's history for ideas.
Love how many times you show Optimus executing Sentinel 😂
21:55 I'm a bit disappointed that you didn't include Optimus' iconic line, "GIVE ME YOUR FACE", when he rips The Fallen's face with a metal rod.
I really wish Pokémon was just a fad
For a minute there I felt like I was watching an Alternate History Hub video about if Pokémon was just a fad relegated to the late '90s.
Theory on why everything happened on earth: Sentinel and Megatron had planned to conquer earth from the beginning because that was where the sun harvester was, which was why Sentinel crashed on the moon. Then, after the allspark was launched into space, The Fallen, from his pyramid prison attempted to draw the allspark towards him, but it landed on the other side of the planet by mistake, and Megatron crashed into the arctic while chasing it because he was weak from fighting Optimus back on cybertron.
I can't help but laugh every single time i hear that stupid Flashgitz screach 1:48
"Somehow they picked up that fuel rod" is the original "Somehow Palpatine returned"
This movie was actually my tapping out point. My distaste for RotF came later upon reflection but I was either young enough or non-critical enough to not be dissatisfied at the time. But this movie I actually remember the mixed feelings coming out of the theater which lead me to still not watch any of the bayformers movies to this day.
23:37 Yeah, my general understanding is that leaks contributed to their desire to completely change the ending.
Watching this on shrooms made this the greatest film i’ve ever seen, it was so enhanced and poetic.
12:14 Like a damned sleeper agent, I remember that motherfucking ship. It'd convert and the hatch would open and my childhood is returning like a meth withdrawl. Thank you Mr. Hub, I needed that.
This video is brain rot fr
nah for me is Mikaela visa expire and she has to cosmetic surgery her face and change her name just to avoid the deportation lol
Optimus taking out Sentinel honestly makes sense. Yeah, G1 Optimus wouldn't have done it, but imagine you go through Chicago getting its shit kicked in, and someone who should have been on your side owns half the blame. Benedict Arnold wasn't the worst traitor, but we still hate him anyway, and he's cute compared to Sentinel Prime.
The funniest line in this movie was where the guy in the corporate office was saying the office was mostly Republican. That's hilarious, especially by the time Obama was President. Bizarro world, indeed.
It’s my favorite tbh
Carley is from G1, but yeah, she was just crammed right in here.   Also, Michael Bay brought Megatron Fox back for TMNT.
13:01 I have this exact same sideswipe transformer.
Hey does anyone kniw were I can find that specific version of the Carlton dance the music I mean
The biggest and only flaw of this video is how he doesn‘t know what the Pokemon ability Intimidate does
One thing common in these movies and Pacific Rim and now the Godzilla movies is normalizing and validating every annoying conspiracy theorist type. It’s fine for one movie, but to have every one of these be about how the most annoying misinformation content creators on the planet are actually the smart guys gets old.
BRO I LOVE TRANSFORMERS DARK OF THE MOON THE WHOLE OTHER HALF OF THE MOVIE IS PURE FUCKIN BATTLE
There is even a scene we're decepticons shoot people and they explode
"im fine with megan fox calling me hitler" Movie: i didnt like her she was mean  If the plan was to use the pillars why didnt the humans working for megatron try to find him, also if the plan was to revive sentianl prime why did they kill optimus in the last movie
ringing in the new year w pointlesshub
Im 2 years late. But like resident evil each movie has its own story to go on. The first 3 were kinda the same story continuing. But you get to 4 it becomes a whole new universe. Then rise of beasts was just something else entirly story wise. Butresident evil retcons everything every movie and its insane to think the same person was in charge of every movie b
Robots? You know what that means! I can be as hardcore as I want and it will still be PG-13! -Melvin, Yu-Gi-Oh The Abriged Series.
It really bothers me how optimus prime just casually commits war crimes
I like this part 19:11
I thought dude was a Texan?
22:20 "Megatron finally rises up against Sentinel" Is this deja vu or a glitch in the matrix of leadership?
We all know why Spielberg got triggered, because he's a juice and Megan Fox unlocked his core memory lmfao
0:33 Christophuh
That’s a bit over dramatic 4:21
7:56 what the androidhell
it's nice to see dark action in transformers and that's why i love the first three live action transformers movies and i honestly wish they stopped there.
My thing about the robots committing crimes is that these are supposed to be  highly intelligent “self learning” alien bots and after being on earth with humans and learning out actions can you honestly blame em
17:06 😂
it’s the best of the first 3
It always comes down to big robots blowing sh*t up😂
14:42 this was the first time, as a child, I realized these movies were made to sell toys, because that honestly a cool concept for a toy and I wanted one
Considering Spielberg is Jewish, I’d say he wasn’t appreciative of Megan Fox’s Hitler comments about Bay.
This dude sounds a lot like Ben Stein.
What's the ending song
Transformers in space, but no Omega Supreme? Kind of a wasted opportunity if you ask me.
Also Optimus didn’t have the matrix when this supposed plan was made 😂😂😂
I consider Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon the pinnacle of cinematic experience, both in it's visual representation and audience impact. 4 and 5 are a major downgrade, Bumblebee and Rise of the Beast are step in the right direction but not as cinematic impact as the Dark of the Moon.
DOTM is 10/10 for me just because it has Shockwave in it :v like, i wish he had something more to do than just being there and looking cool and intimidating, but boy *does he look fucking cool!*
When it comes to The Wreckers, what's not to love? They are NASCAR stock cars, with goddamn machine guns! Also Bayverse Optimus Prime was out here preforming Mortal Kombat fatalities
Defenetly the best (or least worst) Transformers movie. But the biggest villans of this movie is it s human actors😢😢
How is Opimus comitting war crimes its not his fault people forget that the Decepticons are STILL WAY WORSE.
I feel like this is my favorite in the bayverse aside from 2007
I'll be honest I'm just discovering that these movies have plots, I just watch for the violence 😂😂
What are those "dark" live action Pokémon scenes in the beginning from?
Optimus did nothing wrong.
Dotmwas an amazing movie it had harass action perfect chemistry
17:40 Clear sign that the Transformers Space Program needs better funding
I'm not gonna lie i genuinely never saw how this movie could be worse then the softcore 🌽 that was transformers 2
What bugs me the most about these "movies", is that people keep comparing them to the Tv show (which was a lot of fun), but even before the cartoons, there was a Marvel comics series (outside of the MCU). And that series not only was pretty good and "serious" (it wasn't for children like the cartoons).  In those comics, Optimus and Megatron were amazing. The Decepticons had their own conspiracies to dethrone Megatron (Shockwave was their leader for a while).   Optimus sacrificed himself cause he broke their moral codes. And Megatron lost his mind after Optimus died, cause he wasn't the one killing him. It was a human.  Cheers!
My favourite line is. we are autonomous robotic organisms/beings from the plant Cybertron ❤😂
I thought I clicked on the wrong video for the first minute
NO OPTIMUS! 😂
I think what I love the most about transformers is that while I've seen them all my brain has sorta blocked out almost everything from it.
0:39 and then palworld happened
Anyone know what that clip of the two drunk guys is from? It looks like a fun watch but I cannot place it.
3:58 no but like literally, where the fuck was she for the whole of the previous decade😂
Went from sitting at the lunch table to exploring Delta Halo 18:00
Screw transformers, how do I get my hands on that pokemon movie?
Optimus Primes catch phrase across these movies is “I’ll kill you”! Seriously watch them all, that’s what he says every time.
I will not tolerate revenge of the fallen slander
I have to explain this to a lot of other TF fans—the Bayverse movies aren’t good, but a movie doesn’t have to be good for you to enjoy it
Dark of the Moon was Peak Transformers! Period, just enjoy big robots kill each other while the same plot follows for the humans
I personally think 3 was better than 2. Sure the flaws are there, but the fact that it is so dark and "depressong" at times made it so much more impactful. Not to mention how brutal Optimus becomes overtime.
I promise I try to pay attention to your excellent video essay, but half the time, my brain just goes, "OOOOHHH, THE MUSIC FROM SPYRO!" Still though, just found your channel, and I'm loving it!
13:18 brought me back to middle school w that one lol
I honestly think that this ending is more fitting bc megatron and sentinel prime almost whipped Chicago off the map
Anyone else notice how obsessed the Transformers movies are with the Air Force Ospreys?
Im sorry im really sorry for liking the Age of extinction, and last knight i know i failed you😭
I miss my chonky chu  Use to hug it while sleeping
15:34 you say this like Buzz Aldrin isn’t a massive nerd, he was probably like “hell yeah” when they pitched the idea to him
..................STILL PEAK!!!
I dont understand the Revenge of the Fallen hate. I've watched this movie immediately after the first a number of times, and I like them both equally. What don't I understand? Can someone explain?
The reason that I think it is a little obvious for them to keep getting away with extreme violence in these movies is because they're robots, not technically people, therefore seeing a robot get his head ripped off is totally fine and way to violent to even be considered PG 13
transformers is exactly twilight for men with a capital M
I think the best part was Sam's boss flying out a window.
As a kid, the first 10 minutes of the movie and the part with the space shuttle was the only reason why I ever went to see Dark of the Moon with my family, I was in the beginnings of my obsession with Spaceflight, back then I couldn't give less of a shit about Transformers, and that whole sequence was my shit back in the day. In fact at the time the thing that annoyed me more then people in comments on youtube saying the moon landings were fake on an Apollo 11 broadcast video, was people on repeat saying the reason why they are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were on the moon is to see Sentinel Prime in the giant space ship.
I find it funny that this trilogy did an amazing job of showing how war breaks a man. I won’t pretend this was a good Optimus, but it was a surprisingly real character arc.
That Pokémon idea I would go to see 10 no 30x in theaters and honestly if pal world is any metric on how people feel about brutal Pokémon I’d say it is a HELL YEEEEAAAAHHHHHRRRR
On the topic of the execution of Megatron and Sentinel Prime, keep in mind he is not on Cybertron, he is on Earth, and him sparing them would be a slap in the face to all the humans killed by the Decepticons.
"How ya gonna dance your way out this shituation, Swayze? Dirtily?"  Conky
Optimus going insane is completely valid, he took shit from the humans, decepticons and his allies, he was jumped by decepticons many times, betrayed by sentinel, his master, the humans never listened to him and all this shit happened, him tweaking out is completely valid
Imma be honest, I know these movies aren't really the holy grail of cinema, but it was my favorite series as a kid, and I will always love the BayVerse (not 5 though...still hate that one)
What does the Transformers Movie and Dark Souls have in common?  *R O L L*
Dark of the moon is actually my favorite TF movie, the only thing it lacked would be a Worthy fight for Optimus against Megatron
“Somehow, they must have picked up that fuel rock” was the 2011 version of “Somehow, Palpatine returned.”
I am a consumer and I must consume
18:00 halo music
9:17 I CAN'T be the only one who thinks the Chicago invasion scene in this movie is quite similar to some of the destruction scenes in War of the Worlds 2005 (especially in how that destruction is portrayed)...given that Steven Spielberg had a hand in both films, it does makes sense though...
I remember seeing a video essay about Optimus and how he became so violent in these movies. The basic premise was that in Revenge of the Fallen he came to the realization that if he held back, the Decepticons would destroy everything. His ideals and good nature would amount to nothing if he and everyone else were dead. So, he did what he had to.  Found it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80co3eH9mck
All i'm going to say is that the first 4 tranformers movies are my guilty pleasure. I feel like the first 3 get too much hate, the 4th is fun if a bit bad.
Bro thought he could just sneak in Spyro music
20:36 Intimidate lowers attack…
Fun fact, shockwave ALSO crashlanded into earth
13:24  fuck the military industrial complex all my homies love the space industrial complex we want shuttles and shit
Dark of the moon is great, But they make the decepticons weak as hell
The soviet luna series spacecraft were able to pick up samples... of dust no more than 300g
12:47   first man spotted
18:20 Ya gotta have a backup plan, dude
Unionized labor was not to blame, and I resent the implication. It was the studio's mistreatment of their writers forcing them to strike.
Don't know if you've been corrected yet, but Intimidate lowers Attack, not Sp. Def.  Very entertaining video tho!
I loved this movie when it came out. Went to the theatre and watched it 4 times. It was mindless fun. Besides I rrreally wanted Optimus to be badass, like u know, fucking up Megatron's shit real good. And personally I liked the ending. Megatron was evil and there was never gonna be any peace between him and the Autobots.
This movie was metal asf when I was a kid couldn’t take my eyes off it. It’s still amazing to me today
first movie i fell asleep too
Wait, I'm confused. Were those Pokemon movie clips at the beginning of the video actually from some banished never-to-be-spoken-of Pokemon movie? Or was that just a brutal fan-made trailer that PointlessHub made or sampled clips from?
Dark of the moon was fuckin epic
"Big Shuttle , pause" Had me thrown!
Maybe I just have horrible taste but I think every transformers movie is good in their own way FIVE is kind of boring, but I loved it  for I love so much and then the first three are my favorites In my mind, there’s no transformers movie out
17:06 I want this song now
They left Cybertron millions of years ago, the Decepticons knew thats where they were going. This is Transformers 101
No such thing as warcrimes if you dont sign the geneva convention
To this day, i tend to forgot that Soundwave is the Mercedes in the movie
0:18 TYPHLOSION?!
Man did that tangent about violence in transformers movies age like a fine wine
Literally me in space
Maybe it’s time we just accept this Optimus how he is: a soldier who’s let war consume morality and thus lead to him becoming more ruthless and unforgiving. That’s just the take on the character, and it’s probably best if it remain the sole example of it.
if you are found invading a foreign land, there is no surrendering , u made ur piece coming here, let me give it to you ...
I don't know why I clicked on this video, I don't even like Transformers and Michael Bay. It's WWE/Monstertruck cinema
My favorite part was when the girl was yelling, “guys look” it was such a master piece 😙👌🏻
I actually love revenge of the fallen 😭
'Wingmaster' goes kind of hard though.
I’m a be honest I’ve watched this video twice now and I’ve since re-watched transformers three times then since the first time I watched this video and I will be honest I still couldn’t tell you that Steven Spielberg was involved in this movie at all
I had a thought the other day: What if Shockwave took Sentinel Prime's place in the story? It would require a lot of reworking, but imagine if everyone thought Shockwave was the hero of the Autobots...meanwhile the audience is just waiting for the other shoe to drop, dreading every moment Optimus and the Autobots entrust something crucial to the guy _we_ know is going to betray them. Then, during the climax, we see Shockwave betray Megatron too, and then Optimus and Megatron team up to take down Shockwave and his insane evil plan.
I love the trilogy   Just dumb violence
Genocide for the kids 19:11
Ok let's not pretend that transformers hasn't always taken glee in killing characters in the most horrific ways possible when they need to clear toyshelves. The Movie alone STARTED with the Decepticons brutally executing an entire ship full of autobots. Beast Wars had one of its heroes and one of the primary villains kill each other when the HERO stabbed the villain in the heart with a crystal spike that exploded and killed them both. And that's not getting into the comics where there would just be regular casualties without even the excuse of needing to sell toys.
The difference in Optomis from ROTF to DOTM is insane. Like he was brutal but he was always fighting to protect something and was more of a "hero who kills" kind of character than a "I will literally rip you limb from limb come the fuck back here".
Fun fact, intimidation lowers the attack, not special attack. Love the vid though. 💪
8:05 remember when the bloods were red. Then they changed it toxic waste green in age of extinction
I like the movie too. It’s actually my favorite one.
Optimum executing Sentinel will never not be hilarious.
BRO THE DOGS
24:17 ONE PEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIICE
8:32
Bay made the best Sci Fi battles I've seen and I will be forever thankful for that
But... but... i kinda like that shockwave, he has a cool insect look to him, even today i still think it's a cool design. I like the nightmare inducing robotic counterpart from the worm from dune
Yknow revenge of the fallen was one of my favorite movies-
I know I’m late to the party but I can’t find the channel he recommended “Trans Theories” all I get is a channel callled “thyremous” or some shit like that can anyone help?
Dude these movies were peak cinema what the hell are yall smoking
dude what pokemon is a fad.
16:15 Somehow, Palpatine returned.
The first transformers was legit. They should’ve left it there 😂
I never liked Pokémon
I did like the depression and the deaths.
Yeahhh...the way Mikaela's character was offed was weird. They could have just kept Mikaela as a character even with the actress being changed.
11:30 I can't believe younger me just casually accepted all of this. The autobots potentially contributing to World War 3 is one of the most insane plotpoints in these movies
Patrick Dempsey, not Patrick Swayzee. Idk if it's a mistake or on purpose
Coming back from 2024 all I can say is the channel "trans theories" is a bit of a stretch
I've always hated how Megatron was used in this movie. He's just sitting around for so much of it and then Optimus just kills him in a matter of seconds when they fight. The team up was awesome but they really deserved an extended duel with each other. He doesn't feel like a big bad guy or Optimus's arch nemesis, he just feels like any other bad guy.
the only way to like transformers is to be 12yo when those garbage movies came out.
How to make this movie infinitely better (story wise). Shockwave is actually the big bad, and gets a leg up on Megatron. Megatron, betrayed by all the deceptions, saved Optimus in his fight against Sentinel, and the two battered transformers work together in a temporary truce to put Shockwave down. Shockwave grinds Megatron to a pulp with the worm, but that gives Optimus the opportunity to get close enough to rip his eye and spinal cord out with the arm he has left. Optimus gets a shred of hope, that evil isn't absolute, and maybe there is hope for the transformers race, if he could fight alongside Megatron, as they once did before the Cybertronain civil war. With the scattered Decepticons on the run, all their known leaders dead, and Cybertron lost forever, the Autobots make peace with their fate and Earth becomes their new home.   The 4th movie being about humans betraying the Autobots would make a whole lot more sense if the movie starts with them killing the last Decepticon on earth, and humans were secretly making their own to fight off the Autobots in a Mecha-Godzilla type plot, but natrually due to using SHOCKWAVE as a brain, they go rogue and the Autobots have to save humans from themselves, on a terminator 3 style uphill battle, where the opposing robots are simply better in every way, except they're soulless and can't think of anything besides killing, like wild animals. Then the Autobots get their hands on the Dinobots and unleash a war of thoughtless killing machines. After the destruction caused by true merciless behavior on both sides, resembling the destruction of a nuclear blast, humans accept the fact they are the inferior species. With that last shred of hope gone, Optimus makes it clear that the Autobots are here to stay, and they will defend their home should they need to, from *anyone.* This movie ends with Optimus giving a speech "And more than met the eye there was. The humans have proven just how much like us they are. Those who will fight along side us and those who will turn against us. We yearn for the day where the fighting may end, but that day... is not today. I am Optimus Prime, and as long as I stand, this will always, be our home." as Somewhere I Belong plays in the background.   There is no 5th movie
That first transformer movie is actually amazing definitely holds a special place in my heart
For what it’s worth, it’s likely that Spielberg was legit pretty pissed off at Megan’s comments. I mean, he’s a Jewish guy who made Schindler’s List. It’s not the least reasonable response I’ve ever heard.
18:32 Eren?!
I’m absolutely not complaining, but why is the Spyro the Dragon OST in the background of EVETY YouTube video these days?
Shabammm 1:01
LUAR CRIMES
Hell yeah, spyro OST on the Bg.
“It looks like Bumblebee. If Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.” That one always gets me. Also I just noticed that the film novel was written by Peter David, the man who wrote several Marvel comics for decades. No wonder why the alternate ending sounded cool even if it was adapting from an already existing source.
Cool fact: Megatron’s wheels clip through Abe’s chair
İs it just me or do I hear this guys voice everywhere? Like theres atleast thousands of different channels with this exact voice. İs this AI or sm?
People are so weird about calling optimus a psycho in these movies yet no one considers that the decepticons arent just weirdos like they are in most other things.
I would pay money to watch a movie about shockwave and his robot-graboid
12:24 Well in the Bayverse, it was supposedly neck in neck, isn’t that how Cybertron was destroyed?
I love this movie i loved it as a kid I’m 20 now and i still love it  best live action Transformers movie ever
Intimidate lower attack
Best in the franchise.
17:14 Megatron's wheelyfoots are clipping through the floor
I kind of like Transformers 2
I wish it was
Ain't no way your gonna get me to type trans theories into my search bar nice try buddy
The transformers movies were so much fun. They were super high budget, full of some truly amazing special effects and no matter what anyone says, Shia LaBeof killed it. Sometimes movies are fun, just to be fun..
Bay really turned the deceptions from slaves fighting an oppressive government to horrific monsters    Now replace the deceptions with black people and you got basic confederate propaganda
Dr shepherd went from “it’s a beautiful day to save lives” to “let’s enslave all of humanity because I’m mad this dumbass stole my girl”
11:29 no wonder they outlawed in age in extinction 😂😅
Dude, WTF, I just noticed the whole video has the Spyro 3 Soundtrack.
Hey, optimus read our military history and decide to up his own game
I seriously couldnt figure out why the first minute was about Pokémon I thought i accidentally clicked on the wrong video at first😂😂😂
You know now that I'm older and I'm reading "America ends Alliance" I wonder why the Autobots wouldn't just move to Russia or China in that case. Like whoever teams up with them immediately becomes the worlds strongest super power lol.
earth rules dont apply on cybertronians
There was peace for millions of years on cybertron before megatron craved power!!
oh fuck i remember i completely forget watching that one too but all i can remember is the blonde girl from the movie
Wait, we hate Revenge of The Fallen?? I’ve always kinda preferred it.
I've watched these videos like 7 times and there funny every time
The funny thing is that Transformers was super violent in the comics/Japan and had to be toned down for the 80s cartoon to sell toys. I honestly loved this version of Optimus, he was always the character who tried to lead and watch out for everyone and turned the other cheek, but when he snapped in the comics he really snapped and was capable of taking faces. You never want to push the strong silent types too far and I loved that aspect of this film where he just goes on a massive killstreak at the end.
Don't worry man. I still love Revenge of the Fallen. My brother took my sisters and I to see it in theaters.   It's dumb, crass and way to horny, but I still love it. Got a healthy amount of nostalgia for it.
I dont find it hilarious... i find it awesome.... optimus grew sick of the game, of playing by the rules.. started getting greasy... the idea of a team up and a truce is cool as well
Unpopular opinion i think transformers 3 is the best transformers movie
1:25 final stop before Pokémon hits rock bottom.
I don't know if I've seen anyone point this out, but Dark of The Moon is just a slightly modified version of the G1 series of episodes "Megatron's Master Plan" combined with "The Ultimate Doom".  Megatron turns humans against the Autobots.  That's lifted from Megatron's Master Plan.  Cybertron is brought into Earth's orbit.  That's from The Ultimate Doom.  Autobots are forced to leave on a human ship.  Megatron's Master Plan AGAIN.  Decepticons enslaving humanity is from those episodes too.  Decepticons working with humans is from those episodes.  Megatron taking the Lincoln Memorial and sitting on it as a throne is just lifted directly from G1.  It's either the Master Plan episodes again, or "Atlantis, Arise!"  Either way, it's still just the 80s again.  The first three movies are just G1 plot lines but made more edgy.  Sun harvester?  "Changing Gears".  World travel?  Season 2 is full of it.  Carly as a character was lifted from G1, though she has zero resemblance to the 80s character besides being blonde and the love interest of the main human character.  There's probably more that I'm forgetting too.
20:33 um actually intimidation lowers attack😎
The first three transformers were great.
16:18 My justification for that is that the US really doesn’t know how Russia got the engine piece from the Ark, because it was in fact given to them by the Decepticons as payment for their collaboration, and the Russians covered that part up, using Laserbeak to keep anyone who knew about the deal quiet. Because they knew about the Decepticons as early as 1963, and it’s likely that the Decepticons on the moon at the time saw Luna IV in orbit, and instead of shooting it down, they tracked it back to the USSR, and made a deal with Vasily Mishin, director of the Soviet Space Program after Korolev, to keep quiet about what they saw, and cancel their planned 1972 manned mission. In exchange,  they gave the Russians the Fuel Rod from the Ark, and the Cosmonauts who were supposed to be part of that cancelled moon landing fled Russia and went into hiding in America.   Only problem, though, is that Russia didn’t know how to harness it. Thats how Chernobyl happened. Or rather, the Decepticons knew that they couldn’t harness it, and allowed them to try, and fail, to harness it. Leaving that lead open as a backup plan in case they could not succeed in the Allspark plan in the first movie, or acquire both shards in the second movie. All the while, keeping the Autobots busy with agents around the world and in America. Because I think that the Allspark itself, and later that second shard, the one Sam used to revive Jetfire, were partially intended by the Decepticons to be used for reviving Sentinel Prime. The whole Allspark was meant to build a new workforce to rebuild Cybertron, and revive Sentinel Prime to bring Cybertron to Earth. Failing that, the plan was to enslave humanity to be that workforce, and use the shards on Megatron and Sentinel, while also converting the sun into Energon to stay alive and raise new Decepticons (They’d probably keep the humans alive with, like, UV lights or something until they didn’t need the anymore.)   Once both of those plans failed, they had to fall back on the namesake of their faction, deception, to manipulate the Autobots into reviving Sentinel. Having one of their surviving collaborators in Russia deliberately lead NEST and the Autobots to Chernobyl, then having Shockwave attempt and purposely fail to steal the Fuel Rod, leading the Autobots to the Ark, while having Laserbeak clean up the loose end of the Russian collaborator.
I had that ship toy
A completely neutral, literally alien third party who wishes to protect humanity in general destroyed a country's nuclear program in the name of a country with hundreds of nuclear missiles and has actually used them? I would say that after they were used in such a way, America hunted them down indiscriminately is biting social commentary but I don't think the movies are that smart
You talked about the movie being violent and depressing, and honestly? They should've leaned even harder into it and have the film end with Chicago being taken. Have the Decepticons take both Chicago and somehow disable national defenses or something and the sequel would be a direct follow up with the Autobots and humans forming a resistance, systematically dismantling the Decepticons regime.
That scene where a group of terrified humans get flash disintegrated into charred bone chunks.   By a weapon that touches the ground…  That was intense.
The most Science Fiction in this film is not the 40 foot tall robots It is Shia LaBeouf somehow getting Megan Fox and the Victoria’s Secret model  I mean, come on
Can someone explain the hate on Transformers 2? I‘m genuinely confused why everybody on YouTube hates on it
I love my girlfriend
I love pokemon and transformers
This is the only Transformers movie I've seen. I was a fan. Of them as a kid and despite that I didn't have high hopes for this one. Pointless makes a lot of great points and I can definitively say that, having watched it now, I was right this whole series blows and so does Michael Bay
I was a preteen when dark of the moon came out. Is it really been that long ago? I’m 25 now I still remember how excited I was for this movie I have all of the live action movies on CD and I just decided to get them digitally as well. My three favorite Transformers movies 2007 live action, revenge of the fallen and dark of the Moon and yes, we can’t forget about the OG 1985 movie but if we’re talking live action, those would be my favorite three and then after that, I watched some of the newer ones but they didn’t really capture that same feeling as the other three movies did age of extinction came very close though honestly though that movie kind of pissed me off more than anything because my favorite character ratchet was killed in that movie. That’s why I have mixed feelings about it. I could say that about the first movie having jazz beat split into and killed by Megatron, but Megatron is a piece of shit of course he’s gonna kill jazz and in dark of the moon same thing Ironhide was killed by Sentinel prime but Sentinel prime portrayed the auto bots and made a deal with Megatron because he’s a piece of shit and just killed Ironhide so I get that what bugs me about age of extinction and how ratchet was killed it was the humans that found ratchet for lockdown and he did the rest. The humans hunted him and yes, I get why because the events of dark of the moon at the same time, why are you doing deals with a bounty hunter that doesn’t give a shit what happens to you and The last night was good. I was happy. They brought barricade back and Megatron‘s new body did look bad ass and we did get to see a little more of Cybertron so there’s some parts to it that I did like and the newest one where I don’t know why it wasn’t jazz because originally in the cartoon jazz was a Porsche 911 but in the new movie they made Mirage a air cooled 964 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 3.8  Which was cool because I do like Porsche’s as well, especially the classic ones and we did get to see  Unicron more in that movie, which was also cool because the last time we really got to see him was in the 1985 original movie do I wish it would’ve played out like that movie but in live action yes I do and honestly, I was excited for that when they said Unicron was going to make an appearance that’s what I was hoping for. I also wish that they would’ve made jazz that Porsche 911 instead of mirage because it would be more fitting but I mean just some nit pics there but yeah those are my top three live action movies basically Transformers 1 2 and 3 of the Bay films and mostly because all of them were my childhood
3:59 Jesus wtf happened to her   Sure she was Hollywood stylized pretty but she still looked like she could be a normal ass person
As a kid, the violence in this one made it my favorite
I think it was this one. I picked this movie over another at a theater just because of the higher budget. But this is the only time I've looked at my watch halfway through the movie to see how much longer I would have to sit through this. If not this one, definitely the next one.
🫡.
Patrick Dempsey
Ever bug anyone else as a kid seeing the editing issue at 17:14 lol
Bro the autobots were the deceptacons in this movie 💀
Say what you will Michael Bay knew his audience and delivered with Transformers 1-3. Can’t say the same on these other trash directors. Except you Chris Nolan. You have my heart.
"Homehow Palpatine returned" ahh moment
Michael Bay seems to have a thing for inflatable dolls
I grew up with the Bayverse Transformers so I loved the original trilogy.
Another piece of evidence pointing to Carly's role originally being meant for Mikaela is the fact that she and Sam just...have Mikaela's dog (actually Michael Bay's dog), for some reason?  I guess Sam got custody in the breakup lmao.
I choose to believe Micheal Bay knew what he was doing when he wrote this series with all these dark ass themes. Feels like attack on titan lol.
I think megatron might be the good guy...
Pokémon bit at the beginning hasn’t aged well after the Typhlosion leaks
It’s Dempsey, Patrick DEMPSEY!!
Seeing Typhlpsion's name in 2024 will never be the same. 😢
Pokemon should have been a fad. It was built to be a fad. It had no real creative undercurrent, it was random nonsense built to cash-in on addictive kids toys and cards. Power Rangers was similar, but derivative of meaningful creations like Robotech and Voltron and Transformers. Michael Bay's Transformers movies after the first one are just soulless derivative cash-ins like Pokemon and Power Rangers. The '90s had a great rock revolution and movie evolution, but really, by around the mid-mark, creativity became manufactured to the lowest common marketing denominator.
20:33 ooooooh I'm gonna snap you in half, Intimidate lowers ATTACK, not SpDef!  Good video, though!
Nothing about how Alan Tudyk stole the show every time he was on screen?  For shame.
The driller is shockwaves son ish
Clicking on this video right after watching a guy talk about the pokemon leaked stories and hearing "you know pokemon?" was crazy
I love Stewart Copeland. Keep the spyro music coming....
This is just about the Pokemon part, but how are we all forgetting the OG manga battles were literally fights to the death. Like. You sent your mon out so you didn’t die. Pokemon *started* dark
it's funny how in this movie optimus heartlessly executes both megatron and sentinel, while in Transformers One (spoilers!) Optimus' ascension to being a Prime was his selflessness in standing in front of Megatron trying to kill Sentinel
24:21 Blade 2 was awful. At least Blade 3 was able to salvage the series somewhat
So the Allspark, the Matrix of Leadership, The Ark, the key for Unicron were all on Earth randomly!
I honestly love this movie
You know... funnily enough, if they just dyed her hair black and just said it's the same girl... I don't think people would really complain. Like, we could say, oh she got wounded in the face during the whole battle in egypt, so she got a plastic surgery and looks a bit different. Bam, done, no need to CTRL+F REPLACE the girl.
NO OPTIMUS
The first trilogy was and is awesome
The Spyro the Dragon music sent me into a nostalgia frenzy
Dark of moon is  amazing
I know why. It's the same reason for us all. "Megan Fucking Sexy Lip Fox."
I unashamedly love this movie. It's dumb fun with a mix of serious moments. What's not to love about it?
You know... It seems like a lot of companies and producers will think that its wrong and weird for using another actor for the same character and cause the whole thing to become an issue. Yet making an entirely new character but then trying to patch it up and mangling it into the already completed script makes it so much worse.  In the MCU, a couple major characters were replaced during filming (Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo & Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle) and it did not affect the flow of the movie that much. Most people didn't really notice nor care. Yeah the actors themselves have positives and negatives but overall, they just continued the script. They didn't feel the need to haphazardly explain why a 'familar face' is no longer there.
How could you not talk about Laserbeak
One scene I specifically remembered was when some humans were fleeing from the alien fighter jets and one got shot by its main cannon and only left a skull and some bones behind. I never saw this much violence against civilians in a movie that is rated 12 in germany
9:11 pov me pouring gasoline  in a ant hill
Everybody's gonna hate me for this But I like dark of the moon It's my favorite
Thank you! This is the best of the bunch. Shockwave adds such a misused badass. Still not a great film either way, but shockwave could have been so great
Spielberg is a Jew, so...
I was left shocked when Optimus Prime said something like Kill them All
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it for the rest of time, if it ended here at DOTM, it would’ve been a better remembered film series. But because of Paramount’s insane greed, it’s only gonna be remembered as a meme worthy failure.
nah they bomb Afghanistan before. It was in the old cartoons it was just called Carbombia instead lmao
TO THIS DAY I still think Ironhide aint deserve that
This is my favorite of the first 3 live action movies we don’t talk about the last 2
You think you’ll catch me at a channel called “Trans” theories?
Grew up with the trilogy movies as a child and still love them to this day! Nothing wrong with just grabbing some snacks and enjoying some action 🫴🏽
15:50 he probably got a kick out of it😂 got to take his grandkinds on the set and literally just be himself. So technically hes now an actor too🤷🏿‍♂️
7:51 Even the original Ninja Turtles cartoon went with this. When they first fight foot clan guys they're being real careful, then they go "Oh shit they're robots, HELL YEAH" and they start ripping them apart. 😂
Rewatching the scene... I actually do feel Optimus is pretty justified. He has one arm, has no guarantee that Megatron will not immediately try to off him, and just listened to Sentinel gloat about being the one true god of Earth.  Berserker rushing Megatron when he wasnt expecting it and executing Sentinel was the best option. No apologies 🤷‍♂️
I found revenge of the fallen funny  Therefore it's good because i enjoyed it
0:48 so like the og pokémon manga?
Mikaela just breaks up off screen and then in the next movie sam is just dead, died off-screen
They should’ve just recasted mikaela instead of replacing the character itself
Michael bay really hit us with a "somehow palpatine returned" before disney did
You should remake this with tranforme one "When PG is pushed to its limit"
8:00 Fucking disintegrate is awesome
Nothing can get me to dislike these movies. They are a guilty pleasure of mine.
Man, now that I've had it explained to me... It is kinda stupid that somehow, no matter what, anything from Cyberton just ends up om earth no questions asked.
Dark of the moon is goated
15:03 ngl, kinda goes hard
To be fair, sentinel killed my boy ironhide and if it was me, I’d have emptied the clip
Natobots transform and roll out
granted NASA was very much a part of the military industrial complex. we were not in space for fun or for progress. it was to win the Cold War
I like all transformer movies. That why I buy the blue rays. To support them
I do just have my own head cannon where optimus just became more violent the more autobots and humans died, specially shit like jazz and iron hide
Why does he sound like Raccoon eggs
This is an awful video.
Idc I was watching transformers films since I was 4._. Watched dotm when I was 7._____.
love the spyro music
Shockwave was actually smart in this movie, he wanted them to have the fuel cell so they can get to the moon and revieve sentinel for the cons, he got rid of optimus primes trailer near the end to get rid of his weapons, he had percice aim, so he is not just an edgy monster
I think the transformers trilogy was a solid 7/10 it wasn’t the worst shit ever created but neither peak fiction it’s good until it’s not with 4 and 5 but I just make a headcannon that those movies aren’t cannon
This may be the greatest last action movie ever There are no more sets. Just straight green screens
I feel old
Hate people that just hate on good classic movies just because. All of these movies are good entertainment, and that’s all movies are good. The only one I didn’t like was The Last Knight
I Don’t Think There’s Anything Wrong With Liking Bad Movies. Like I Enjoyed Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Still Love It), But I Will Admit That It’s A Badly Written Movie
Revenge of the fallen wasn't thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat bad
The third one is my favorite movie 😂
Tbh caring about the love story in a robot action movie is below the I care bar.
10:38 THAT SHOCKWAVE DESIGN !!! THAT SHOCKWAVE DESIGN !!!
I remember watching the 1984 transformers movie and seeing Optimus die, and i had that knowledge going into revenge of the fallen so when he died it didnt surprise me when he got brought back at the end of that movie lol.
Wait bro- you in Illinois too??
At 21:57 there is a spark in the decepticon's right eye that doesn't match the frame rate
Dark of the moon is a pretty good movie idc what anyone says
The whole thing about the American feds and buzz not knowing how the russians got that cybertronian ship part makes WAY more sense than you give it credit for. How WOULD the Americans know how the RUSSIANS got that part???  What they could've done is have the russians that Sam and the other guy talk to later in the movie explain how the russians got the part.   But the REAL question, is why TF the modern day russians aren't using that ALIEN TECHNOLOGY and researching it since the Soviet union collapsed??? That would be like the CIA just closing up shop at area 51 and leaving behind a whole bunch of infinitely valuable alien tech. CRAZY TALK
I love the use of the halo song in the backround around 17:15😂
Probably isn’t blood most likely transmission fluid since they’re all vehicles with transmissions but still not much of a difference
The last third of this movie is just black ops 2 + cod ghosts + robots
14:50 Shockwave is still a cool name
10:21 this the worst take I’ve heard in reference to character design 🤦🏿‍♂️
Iran: Those transformers of yours blew my stuff up!!   FBI: Nah, they went Rogue, not our problem. iran: How can they go Rogue!?  optimus: time to find out😈   iran:💀 FBI:😅
Transformers One: When PG pushed its limits.
13:20 “Big Shuttle” 😂
This is the Transformers version of the Rise of Skywalker.
17:40 RED WING MENTIONED!!!! THATS MY SON!!
Transformers 86 when
That movie is the epitome of Optimus has had enough and begins to obliterate anything and anyone
Crazy to think if they filmed this in Detroit, they could of saved millions on a destroyed city.
20:32 bro that had me dead 😂
😂😂😂😂 Wing-Master the balrog.
My head cannon is, In the 4th movie i think optimus has ptsd from this event and the aftermath. he had been betrayed by not only by his friend and leader which lead to the desth of multiple autobot friends and 10s of thousands of humans, but mankind turned on him aswell. Hmso i see him gradually getting more and more unhinged
This is my favourite movie of the franchise. Decepticons arriving and taking over chicago is a great scene and optimus seeing executioners and taking them out was great. Its like him seeing that was enough for him to go ahead and take them out
If Transformers Prime on Netflix is anything to go off of, the 'blood' is just red energon.
“This evil thing’s looking at me!” is my favorite line in any of these movies. It’s so lazy and weird that it wraps around to being hilarious and great.
If youre going to criticize this movie, do it. But please for the love of god actually acknowledge that the action in this movie and the visual effects and 99% of the scenes involving a transformer on screen was a comoletely good and enjoyable and understandable scene. If you really cant find the olot in this movie, youre probably below average iq. I as a 6 year old understood everything, yeah almost every normal human scene was unseeable, but every time the movie was actually about transformers, it rocked. So a perfectly enjoyable movie? Yeah i give it a 7. A 5 being i dont care for it and under 5 being i have to be drunk to watch it.
funny enough a pokemon world where pokemon die already exists! the official manga for the franchise has pokemon and their trainers risking their lives with every book. i think i remember an arbok being cut in half and a trainer being frozen solid.
Optimus in the bayverse films was completely justified
War crimes? Attack on Iran? Wow transformers 3 went full Jewish
......... You know they could've pulled a Marvel and just replaced the face but kept the name the same. They did it with both Banner and Brody
I believe second movie destroyed prime internally. The forest fight, prime was still generous and was fighting normally, but backing up to protect sam, when decepticons start beating up prime and Megatron calls him weak, in a bid to protect sam, he went all in, only to be backstabed by Megatron. After his death and subsequent revival I think prime went through alot of pain and believed his generosity towards his enemies was his weakness and went all out after that. Shown in the fight against fallen and so on.
Megan Fox was the best character
”trans theories”💀
DO YOU FEEL COOOOOOOOOLD AND LOOOST IN DESPERAAAAAAAATIOOOOOOOOONNNNNNN....
People like to rag on Starwars ROS for lines like "Somehow Palpatine returned"  I would argue that "Somehow the russians picked up that fuel rod" is worse. At least it IS explained how Palpatine comes back later in the movie. They give 0 explanation in Dark of the Moon lol
I may be one of the only people on earth that loves the scene where prime kills megatron and sentinel
Don’t hurt me, I kind of like age of extinction
is this the Spyro music???
I know the bay transformers movies aren't liked much but honestly I love them, the last night not so much but the other 4 I honestly enjoyed a lot, I'm not saying they're good movies, they're not lmao, but they're the type of bad that I just really enjoy, and they're fun
Not gonna lie I like the 3rd movie a little too it was the first transformers I watched and I love the over the top action ngl
I DEEPLY appreciate the use of the Transformers Cybertron race music
i loved these movies. everything is just COOL, if I were to describe it in a single word. you couldn't look at these transformers and the action scenes and not think, "thats cool"
Transformers and Pokémon would a hell of a crossover for when I was a kid.
I was in a relationship for almost 4 years. 2-3 months after that, I was with someone else. Someone suspiciously like the person I had just broken up with. Oh, wait, turns out people can have a type of person they are attracted to. “A woman super into cars” fits more than 1 woman.
I ask myself why they didn't said the new actor was Michaela and introduced her with a quote like "you look different. Did you change your hair?" You know, like they did with Rhodes in Iron Man 2.
14:30 jumpscare
playing the old cartoon music over the scenes of humans getting dr who skeleton disintegrated is wild, its crazy they let him get away with all the brutality in the first part of the chicago sequence is the limit to violence just as long as what squirts out of the bodies is not red coloured yyou can just evicerate them owever you want.
0:43 if Michael bay directed a pokemon movie
I feel like they could’ve saved the tiniest bit of face if they kept Mikaela as a character but just retconned her appearance from black hair to blonde
5:50 do i hear the spyro year of the dragon sound track?
No, the Deceptacon‘s got everything they deserved.
Hey, Pointless Hub, you like Chicago stuff? You should read the  Dresden Files by Jim Butcher.
Ironhide getting brutally executed was a canon event of my childhood. RIP
people have a problem with the military industial complex??
21:52 lmao "no, Optimus!" BLAM makes me crack up every time
best part of this movie is when sam goes all shia on his car and kicks the crap out of it
Shockwave😍😍😍
I'm here to report that I actually watched that Neil Armstron Ryan Gosling movie, and I love it, one of my favourites :P
Believe and put your Faith in Jesus Christ’s Death Burial and Resurrection for your Sins and you will be Saved 😊
Dawg idk why people hate this movie so much, it’s in my opinion the best of the trilogy
I've thoroughly enjoyed this first transformers videos, but i can't believe that you review and revisited Transformes whiteout a single mention to Linkin Park how their music made Optimus Primes speeches the most epic piece of cinematography ever
In my headcannon, Megan Fox is still in the movie and Carly doesn't exist. The story fits so much better that way
"BRO JUST WASTED  ALL OF US TIME" 🗿
I always forget how ice cold that “time to find out” from Optimus is
Earth from halo 2 lol
Finally some love😂
I started liking the Transformers movies a lot more after they got rid of the human "protagonist" Sam.
This movie might just be rated R if you think about it.
Imagine if your favorite Pokémon canonically committed war crimes.
21:38 seeing that title whilst drinking...too much 🤣🤣
Here for my occasional Optimus was right to kill Sentinel comment.
TF#3: is real vs.lady Ga-Za
Ope! Gotta go! Tell your parents I says hi!
3:23 that's actually my favourite bayverse film
Actually, the bar scene explains that the soviet's probe took the pillars back to earth, and Dyllan's dad bought them from Russia for Soundwave and Devcon. I hate this movie, btw.
The whole pokemon thing happened with the original transformers movie in the 80s, characters die but they never did in the cartoon. Kids were distraught watching that.
All the humans characters sucked, but the transformers were pretty good. That’s why you can still like this movie and find it crap at the same time.
The decepticons were the rebels not the autobots
13:20 What space complex lmao? They're getting budget cuts left and right, ofc NASA would want to garner some of the public's interest for space 😐. Also, space shuttles don't fly anymore… Since like 2013 I think?
12:34 Uh… That's the plot of G1 btw… The Arc is the name of the ship the Autobots crashed on Earth with in G1 🧐. They just changed a couple things to adapt it to the story. In G1, they left in the Arc because it was their only hope to escape but it was shot as they escaped Cybertron. They ended up drifting in space until it crash landed on Earth and the little satellite robot wnet like "Explore! Explore! Explore!" and found them vehicules to transform into and stuff.
If you went in the live-action movies with the expectations of watching G1 come to life, you're gonna hate them because that's not what the movies are about. The movies used the same universe and the same characters to tell a totally different story. A much better story imo. It's not a bunch of goofballs without consequences anymore, it's characters we feel a connection to.  Optimus Prime has had the most development during the 5 movies and it's great. He went from "We won't kill anyone unless it's absolutely necessary." to "Let's hunt down the decepticons before they cause trouble." to "I'll kill even my mentor to protect my friends if I have to." in just 3 movies. That's great development. Much better than Optimus not having any real plan to stop Megatron and the decepticons in G1. Basically all the G1 episodes were "decepticons doing bad shit" followed by "autobots hearing about it and dealing with it".
“A sea of negativity” (Everything GREAT about transformers) 😂 2:41
Well, considering that Speilberg is Jewish, I wouldn't be schocked that he was upset about the Hitler comment.. Even The Last Crusade is about revenge against the Nazis.
The sequels were good until 2017 hit
Optimus was pretty chill in his home world, he spent like 5 years in America and started brutally executing his enemies lmao
4:00, 7:50, 9:45, 11:09-, 18:56, 21:33-
I loke this movie
I kind of like this movie, too. I get it.
How about get to the f**king point?
Hmmm. Sounds like 1:01 he described Palworld...
Sam's After college finding a job was an eye opener for me during high school.. When I graduated college, I know now what will Happen haha
Unpopular opinion but I absolutely love all the bayverse movies even the last one
bro this commentary is fuckin killin me i’m hella weak 😂😂😂
y'all can have Chicago idfc
Transformers 3: Mortal Combat Edition
Tone is what works well in a movie or in a book. When Optimus slowly becomes a killing machine, the tone doesn’t feel how it should feel. It ignores the “Optimus is crazy” for a hero feeling. The best comparison for this is the Image comics run on the Transformers.   In the Image comics, the war and the destruction from these giant metal robots destroying both buildings and people is a heavy saddening feeling. Optimus and his autobots have no issue taking aim at the cons and killing them but each death takes a piece of the character with them. The whole atmosphere of the comic is “this is their reality, in reality people die, this is what would happen”. That’s probably the biggest difference between this movie and other transformers media. When a city is destroyed or even a species due to the fighting, it weighs heavy on a character as it should but in the bayverse people don’t really care, it’s just another day for them. It’s weird how the tone is so off.
I think the choice of using Linkin Park’s Iridescent really hit home for me on the tone. The A- minor struck well when everything descended into chaos and depression. Always been a fan of gritty. Aside from Transformers one, this was actually my favorite.
Bro DOTM is the best movie ever
Up until Age of Extinction, I was focused more on the action. A year later is when I found out ROTF and AoE were deemed terrible.  I was embarrassed seeing The Last Knight in 2018. I couldn't even understand what was happening.
I forget that the dude who plays Stone in the sonic movies was in that scary ass pokemon live action fan movie and it still baffles me
11:12  anyone else noticed the flags were upside down…
Who gives a fuck it's a move. God you analytics youtubers have no life I swear
2:07 well... No. Original movie 1986, was dark. Much darker then original short animated parts. Fight Optimus vs Megatron, their quotes 'its over Prime' - there was So much hate in it.. Moment when Deceptiocoms attack starship to earth and kill Ironhide with shot to head.... Killing Ultra Magnus... Hate of Galvatron vs. Unicron after Matrix grab...
What do you mean Shockwave didn't do much?? Bro, in his few minutes of screentime, not only he caused the movie to happen (by planting the fuel cell and INTENTIONALLY losing it), but he also shaped the future of the next movies... Did you understand the lore even a little bit??
Imo these were the best transformers. Everything that came after it was garbage. Maybe its being a kid when these came out and a adult now. But i hate the new ones
So mamy thins wrong in this video. Main one that annoys me is that he confuses which ship was bolted to which. The zanthium had a shuttle attached to it to show relations. They literally say it in the film.  And its a more realistic adult version of transformers, all the issues you raises were imo. Irrelevant
no, tf3 ist einer der besten filme jemals!!!!
Dude, you have to review 1996's The Arrival, starring Charlie Sheen. It's got the plot of Contact, with the insanity of Independence Day. Its right up your ally.
I like to hear Spyro music in my Transformer video
Oooh motion sickness and plastic cgi
R.I.P. Ironhide
This movie was peak
I saw this movie a good amount of times, but every one of them was on cable TV and it was well past the middle, precisely when the action starts. It looked pretty good for what it wants, not gonna lie
"A great soundtrack really hides the imperfections of a film."  With this in mind, re-watch Home Alone 🤣
Palworld: WRITE THAT DOWN! WRITE THAT DOWN!!!!
I kinda just tuned out the new woman and replaced her with Mikaela, always thought the series would eventually take a darker turn, and I kinda liked how Optimus after holding back all those years finally just snapped and lost it.
Obviously the ussr and the deceptions made a deal to use the Soviet probes to retrieve the ship part
I never cared for the scenes where we only see the humans interacting with one another. Even now being 24. I still only watch the series just to see a bunch of robots beat the breaks off of one another.
About the argument you make about the movie killing character. That's what the whole original movie was about. Kill most of the old Gen 1 toys and showcase the new awesome characters so Hasbro could sell more toys.
Dude, read the comics. The originals. Then you can say that the Decepticons are stupid goofballs and the first gen is light in tone.
I can’t blame Optimus for what he did he watched his friends get brutally killed and the race he sacrificed his friends for betrayed him
I didn't know people actually like the stories of these movies I'm just here for the big robots fighting
Intimidate lowers attack, not special defense. Don't worry, we all make mistakes sometimes 👍
Dark of the Moon was the first exposure to John Malkovich and Ken Jeong. And I won't lie to ya, every single scene with either (or both) of them in it are all my favorite human-type scenes from any of the movies.
This is still the best live action Transformers movie besides the first one
17:14 it still bothers me so fucking much his wheels clip through the stairs
17:28 reminds me of h.p. Lovecraft lore where every god and ancient super race of aliens seems to have fucked around and fought over earth at one point or another in time.
I think this works to fix the plot holes:  Megratron and Sentinel made a truce in the final days of the war.  Megatron was supposed to get the allspark, while Sentinel gave the pillars to the Decepticons to activate them once they arrived on Earth.  Thus Megatron would retrieve the Allspark and by the time Sentinel and the other Decepticons were able to arrive on Earth, they would activate the pillars, bringing Cybertron to Earth's Orbit and then they would've used the allspark to return all live on Cybertron   But it all failed when Megatron crash-landed on the Earth, while Sentinel crash-landed on the moon.  Also simultaneously Megatron would be working with "The Fallen" as his secondary objective would also be to retrieve the Matrix, so that the Fallen could harvest the energy of the sun.  It would also explain why there were so many Decepticons since the 1800's like Jetfire, who were also looking for the cube and the Matrix after Megatron arrived.  The only wacky thing would be that the Allspark coincidentally arrived on Earth just after the original primes (or was it before the original Primes got there?)   This Is the Best i can do to make this have a little Sense, but they clearly didnt think this through while Writing the original Movies.   This would only work with the original Trilogy and Maybe in the context of Transformers 4? (In theory It shouldnt contradict the scrip for 4).  But It would never make Sense for Transformers 5. (I mean yeah that bad).
The first Transformers movie was the first movie my wife and I watched together before we started dating. Revenge Of The Fallen was the last movie we saw in theatres before our son was born. Dark Of The Moon... has no significant milestone in our house, other than it being the first Bayformers movie I didn't see in theatres, being better than Revenge Of The Fallen, and the final live-action Transformers movie I ever watched.  Thank you for marathoning these movies and presenting them in a way that keeps me from having to actually go back and rewatch them (the first one doesn't hold up in my eyes).
10:44 it started with showing Prime’s face under the mask.
I feel the same buddy
when you said optimus started fighting a little too... i was saying to myself serbian SErbian SERBIAN?????!?!?
21:21 i agree thats 100% peak
The Einstein robot will forever haunt my dreams
I've seen 1,2, and 4 I somehow skipped this one
This video is a year old, but still came out more than 10 years after the space shuttle program was discontinued.  So much for Big Shuttle.
Playing the devil's advocate, I havea possible explanation for the seemingly unstitched story. There is a war on Cybertron. Megatron and Sentinel agree that Cybertron is beyond saving, so they're gonna rebuild it using Earth's resources using the bridge tech. Sentinel leaves, but crash lands on the moon. Sometime later Megatrong found out the cube also crashed on Earth, and leaves to fetch it but also crash lands. Autobots also find out about the cube and send Bee to find leads tot he cube which they do in Sam Witwicky. Then TF1 happens. Megatron looses. Then TF2. Megatron is revived using the cube shard. The Fallen tells Megatron about another way to save Cybertron with the Sun harvesting machine. War, Decepticons lose again. But in the process the Matrix of Leadership is discovered, which is now proven to revive the spark in dead Transformers. So Megatron gets an idea for saving Cybertrong once again, by getting Optimus to revive Sentinel using the Matrix.
calling the Balrog "Wing-Master" is a particularly niche joke, love it
Everyone being horrified by Optimus executing a POW... Meanwhile,  Canadian Military sitting back and saying,  "What?  That's all you got?"  *pulls out Geneva Checklist*  "Now THIS is how you war crime!"
It’s random but I don’t like Rutherford b hayes
I don't know why but Ironhide death is ingrained in my head... is it just me?
I think they should have kept the movie ending, but then have optimus reflect over the monster war had made him.
1:02 I know the Transformers Cybertron soundtrack when I hear it
Call Optimus a war criminal if you want. He did what had to be done.
I may be in the minority with this take but I like when the transformers are vulnerable to human weapons. It's a good reason for them to be 'Robots in disguise'.
19:35 isnt quite obvious the highway chase scene the badass battle between ironhide and sideswipe against the dreads
Jeff Bezos: "If you don't know what Pokemon is, you are... hehe..." Me: what?
🏆🏆🏆|!   As I’ve Commented before; Bless The Evil Lords of EYE CANDY!! Kind of like.. KIND Of!!.. watching the ROAD RUNNER cause you always know at the Elsa the COYOTE always gets creamed by a Dropped- from- a- Cliff ONE TON Safe!!  Just Imagine; A Buried, Fad-Craze now BURIED Transformers Movies get Dug Up 500 years late- As those Future people think “.. OMG!!.. No WONDER they all were Killed Off. !!”…. Now SWITCH Movies- Put in MARS ATTACKS! The they’d say, “.. OMG!!.. what a Bunch of LOSERS!! DORKS!! GLAD they’re all Gone!!”🤣.  👴🏽NoBody🎞️s.
Aren't both Spielberg and Bay of jewish descent?? I mean calling your boss of such heritage publicly Hitler ... even in an allegorical way... doesn't seem the best carreer advice to be honest.
((Spielberg)) Yeah, it was definitely him who got Fox fired.
basically the only good transformers series are the one that have linkin park as the ending song
I feel like Buzz Aldrin knew that there would always be one prominent conspiratorial meme-plot involving the moon landing. It was an unavoidable part of our history. So he made a choice, and decided to boost the one where he actually landed on the moon, to collect alien artifacts.
Ironhides death in this messed me up as a kid.
they look like 40K ork mechs that got dumped in grey paint
Ngl, i dont think that i would mind if they said that the new girl was mikaela after dying her hair and putting brown pupils on
Did they seriously just call age of Extinction bad I will make him pay for saying that
The movies are amazing everything's amazing I love Transformers in anyone who doesn't doesn't deserve to live
Guys guys let's be civil about this anyone who doesn't like transformers is a f****** a******
Two words: Beast Wars
Nah, the Autobots started looking too human in Age of Extinction.
nah it isnt violence its tranformers lol
Ah yes 2007 the year I just left college and joined the Air Force. Glad I went back to school. I should've joined the Navy ol' lazy ass Marine recruiter acted like doing his job was too much for him
This is definitely a guilty pleasure for me. I remember watching this film with my uncle back in elementary school and being blown away by the last act of the film
😂 Still my favorite movie
never realized Megatron's tires actually clip through the chair on the Lincoln memorial
Am I falling victim to the nostalgia goggles in saying I liked revenge of the fallen? I mean the plot definitely won't win any awards in my book, but there were some really cool fights. Oh god that's the nicest thing I could think of about them. Jetfire is an SR-71 Blackbird is another redeeming quality? Yikes maybe it is all nostalgia goggles..
7:23 just like find someone who looks similar to Megan fox cast her as her old role and there good as new no need for another character
I don't know why Hollywood has a problem with recasting, but sometimes, you should just recast. You don't need to try to work it so that a new actor is a different person who just happens to be similar to the person who was replaced, especially if the script is already written. Just recast.
1-3 where the shit. Also cat in the hat , the film is perfect and if you disagree you are wrong.
Its not that deep brother it is just a movie
I was 9 when i saw it in 3d and man...this shit hit hard back then
The name of Shockwaves pet is Driller: A giant worm-like tentacled Decepticon
transformers always has a mcguffan plot, and dear god do they pull it off every time (except RotF)
watch theorymus's video about differernt blood types on cybertronians
anyone notice how megatrons wheels kinda clip when his sitting on the statue chair?
Sentanyl Prime
They never went to the moon in the first place
16:16  2011: "Somehow the Russians must've picked up that fuel rod"  2019:"Somehow Palpatine returned"
Shockwave is just standing there menacingly.
Did he called Patrick dempsey Patrick Swayze?
You keep saying "the russians, the russians", I thought Chernobyl was in Ukraine. So, it's the Russians for all intents in purposes, but "a sovereign ancient nation of Ukraine" when it's convenient. uh-huh..
Uuuuuuuummmmmm.... the Intimate ability reduces a pokemon's physical attack. 😅
Megan Fox also turned all of her sons into daughters, She's crazy
I don’t care what people say, Transformers Dark of the Moon is the best Transformers Bay-Verse with a 9/10
Fun fact about that Pokemon bit at the start... The series was actually intended to be a bit more dark, with gym leaders giving you newer and more powerful whips instead of badges to tame stronger pokemon.
“It’s the exact opposite of the original series.” Megatron’s master plan:
The first 3 transformers were really good you can't convince me otherwise
Man they did my man Optimus dirty in these movies, in general what makes me mad, is that even with a bad script this could still be a good movie, if we could just see or make sense of what is happening on scream
Came for the transformers analysis  5:14 Stayed for the Spyro background soundtrack
1:23 what the fuck is this
Ngl I always loved brutal Optimus. It’s just so badass. I didnt really grow up watching the OG transformers but damn is it awesome watching another robot rip his eye  then use his dead body as a gun when he killed shockwave. Bro it’s just soooo metal
things i liked in dark of the moon: the Chicago scene. Megatron sitting on the lincoln Memorial like he did in G1. Star scream actually being somewhat like starscream. Shockwave soundwave Things i didnt like: megatron dying. Starscream dying. Shockwave dying. soundwave ALSO dying. the movie in general
I think the cast of this movie is absolutely baffling. It’s like they accidentally switched out the cast list for a quirky Coen Brothers dark comedy.  Also Frances McDormand looks like she has a gun pointed at her head in every scene if I remember correctly
Megan Fox in a mini skirt or Megan Fox in tight leather pants? Hard choice in more ways than one...
Bro why do you keep calling Patrick Dempsey Patrick Swayze 😂😂😂😂
its not a warcrime if you win
My favorite of the live action movies because it was the first time the Transformers acted like characters
I always thought that the blood was actually some liquid mixed with car oil, hahahaha "energon"
10:14-10:16   Buzz Aldron in TF: DOTM: "Somehow, they must have picked up that fuel rock!"  Poe Dameron in SW: TROS: "Somehow, the Emporer has returned."  Lol. That can't just be a coincidence.🤣🤣
I know some people that hate this video, because point made fun of Ironhide’s death 😂
What? I don’t know why but I actually like revenge of the fallen mainly the action in in XD
I still don't understand the hate on ROTF. The movie was rough at times but I still believe it was a good installment to the series.
5:13 good grief Megan looked a lot better with that more natural face
God, I hated this movie. The way it so dramatically shifted from the tone of the first two. Its almost as drastic as the tonal shift between the first two Hyperdimension Neptunia games. The first two movies were somewhat serious, but pretty goofy big bot battle beat-offs and we loved them for it. The second film, I didnt mind the more serious tone, what with building on the lore of ancient Cybertron and the  Fallen. It helped with worldbuilding Cybertron as a place with its own history and culture. The third film IMMEDIATELY jumps down your fucking throat with conspiracy, human corruption and collaboration and outright fucking WAR CRIMES. Sure, a movie where the good guys gets trounced by a much stronger force and have to build a resistance from the back foot is a good plot device, but it was handled so poorly here. In addition, like the much darker tone implies, this film took itself WAY too seriously. This is Transformers for fuck's sake, not a CoD story. Lastly, Id actually heard Bayverse 'formers was supposed to end here, with Megatron realising this back and forth brawling was going fucking nowhere for their race, and forming a truce with Optimus to get Cybertron back on its feet. Lastly, this movie can genuinely go fuck itself for killing off Ironhide. When a story kills off a major plot/series important character like this, it REEKS of a shit attempt to raise the stakes. Jazz dying in Transformers 1 was good IMO, because it depicted Megatron as this absolutely evil, near-invincible, horrifyingly strong titan of a Decepticon, and that ANYTHING fucking around with him was gonna find out. Messily. Ironhide dying in such a mediocre way (IN ONE SHOT NO LESS. I dont care if Sentinel is a Prime, that kind of power should NOT be written off as some kind of on-hand weapon thats never used again) was downright insulting to his character and his fans.
A summary of the bay transformers films: Sound and noise signifying nothing but is still cool to look at, with a side of american propaganda and sensual humor with bad taste.
Pokemon Gens 1 & 2 are the peak of Pokemon. Every gen after that, they tried doing too much. Completely changed the nature of the games. That graph says so much.
Like, why not just have the character still be Michaela but recast? Recasting isn't common, but it's not UNHEARD OF. It's better than doing a disservice to the characters, isn't it?
Do you remember the part of the film where it takes a break to be like "the office"?
4:11 i heard she asked for more money
“Somehow palpatine returned”
Steven Spielberg, who is Jewish, definitely had her fired.
"our hero finishes off his enemies when they are longer in a condition to fight" mother fucker Optimus was missing an arm and just finished fighting sentinel 😭 you think he was in any better condition to fight?
this is a real PG-13 MOVIE FOR MEN, unlike that made for negative infinite year olds babies Venom Let There Be Carnage
Maybe... just maybe.... this is me spitballing an idea.... but perhaps the human/biological characters were given such ridicule was because the OG-Cartoon style slapstick idiots that were the _actual_ decepticons wouldn't float well with investors. Shockwave was cool. The soundtrack was phenominal... everything else;  kinda forgettable...
Of the live action Transformers movies, this one was the first one that I hated. It was too dark and depressing, humanity betrayed the autobots and Megan Fox was replaced with some British chick.
The Bay-verse was to Transformers what the Snyderverse was to DC Entertainment.
This video reminds me just how despite how violent and edgy they try to be these movies are just such deeply unserious films
The movies were peak
Dark of the moon was peak tho
16:14 ah yes, the Rise of Skywalker explanation
The soundtrack is low key the only good thing about this trilogy
They could've just recast Megan Fox and people would not have been so harsh
That intro 😂
Alright is nobody gonna fucking mention this? 1:23
5:15 TBF Rosie HW> Megan Fox tho
idk the hate I like the aesthetic of the battle for Chicago, it would be cooler if it went down a more depressing theme of war fr
Why not just recast Makayla with a new actress? They did that in the Dark Knight Trilogy so why not just do that here it would save them the hassle of rewriting 2 films of development.
I like watching big hat man talk about transformers
I love how pretty much every movie after the first one is like your Lego storyline when you were a kid. Absolutely no coherent plot, incredible fights
If it ain't Red, it ain't Bled
Imagine being buzz aldrin and having a cool as fuck real life backstory and then some guys ask if you wanna be in their movie about robots beating the shit out of eachother as yourself.
Transformers was a great series and no i don't care about some kiddy comics or cartoons
What Optimus prime did in the second and third has to be against the Geneva convention
As a Wisconsinsite, I love this movie because it shows the Milwaukee art museum and it also shows Chicago getting wrecked and all the FIBs getting owned.
Optimus Crime
Why do people complain about robots or monsters getting gory for PG-13? This shit is weak. A kid is not leaving a movie theatre shaking scared because they saw a car get there chest blown off releasing a liquid that isn’t anything close looking to blood other that it’s in them. I also see some people complaining about violence. Marvel literally has a scene with a dead guy in a bathtub full of blood and it came out PG-13. Yall niggas just soft asf and think anything can ruin a child’s mind. This movie is low tier in the PG-13 movies gore level.                *I bet you 75 percent of kids who saw this movie thought that spine ripped off scene was badass and not scary but I bet you if they saw a cartel video of a guy getting their spine ripped off, it would be a different story. They will be thinking about it all year long. Not like this movie which you will forget the whole plot in a month, especially a kid will forget.*
listening to this in a restauraunt when eating with one earbud.  All of the sudden linkin park comes on and i realized it wasnt you playing the soundtrack 😅
those sets tend to be almost fully replaced come final draft
RIP Ironhide 🪦
Revenge of fallen is my favorite of the three I don’t know why, but it has a sort of charm to it. I know it’s trash, but it’s my trash.😂😂😂
erm actually the “blood” is just red energon that mostly deceptions have 🤓
Deep. Wang. Deep. Wang.
Like your name says. You are the most pointless Channel 😴. You're politics about movies are asinine and are just viral because it's a big franchise you're talking about.  Transformers Bayverse aka The movie, is the best 👌. Cartoons are merely real and just fiction. But the movie makes the real world more exciting but also scary.  Optimus Prime is not a War Criminal-he's the king of the universe as he fights for freedom.  You're video has more Cristian than the movie which explains 😢that you're milking content to make it sound worst.  It's just you're opinion but don't say that you're always right. You're not the center of attention 😒 and honestly you should go do something else if you could even have one in the first place😂  Instead of this maybe fix your own life and get a functional job which you can get retired with. I really don't mean to hurt you mentally but this video make me unable to stand with
I just really love the cybertronian gore in this movie
I love all these movies. I could give less of a shit about the plot. I wanna see explosions and stuff die im easy to please. Thats why mad max fury roads is in my top 5 all time movies
Eyeore brutally executes Spock
As a longtime Transformers fan, it's kind of funny to me that this retrospective series talks like the franchise was in a long period of dormancy by the time Hasbro decided to greenlight a movie about it, when the Unicron Trilogy was running in the years leading up to the 2007 movie's release, and was pretty succesful in its own right. Hell, I think the only time this franchise ever really went away was the gap between Generation 2 and Beast Wars, which was only a few years.
This movie is such a guilty pleasure. I wish I could watch it again in a cinema.
God,could've just kept Mekalea as a character,recasts happen
Amount of transformer video you made I have to plan it
If only shockwave was the big bad and we got a shockwave taking over the decipticons rebelling against megatron due to shockwave thinking he’s dead then comes up with this plan based on one of megatrons old plan that starscreem screwed up back on cybertron
On the beginning of the video, imo transformers werent forgotten from 90. TFP for example is my favorite transformers production.
The Autobots are the actual bad guys in the Bayverse
The next transformers movie is gonna reveal Noah’s ark was a autobot
DRILL BOT IS THIRSTY
Fun fact: my dad's coworker Dave is in this movie. They just walked into weather squadron and asked if people who weren't busy wanted to be in the background of the Nasa bits.
Worm named driller
I grew up watching these movies so ima love them all no matter what XD
Actually that red stuff which in your view and some Transformers fans view appears to be human blood it really isn't, instead its red energon it's responsible for intense hyper-speed, it was even introduced in the Transformers Prime series when Starscream was so greedy to extract and  inject it into his body, that way he was able to steal the omega keys to which can power the omega lock in which can revive Cybertron but the Autobots already ended up succeeding anyway.
I was today years old when i learned buzz aldren played buz aldren in transformers 3
The only reason I didn't like this movie as a kid is because they killed my favorite character (Ironhide) out of nowhere and everyone just kinda stood there and watched confused and didn't give a shit
1:22 IM DONE 😭😭
Oh actually,intimidate lowers attack.
This Optimus is an example of why batman doesn't kill lol
shoutout mr sunday movies
im one of the rare few that actually loved Revenge of the fallen 😏
In my opinion dark of the moon is the best TF film in the bayverse and even better then bumblebee and Rise of the beast
The decepticons were the rebels actually
I love this movie
I hated those movies man. Story made no sense
Not me liking all the movies lol
30 year old men might not have liked the transformers bayverse franchise but 7-12 year olds absolutely loved it 🥹🥺
Nah idc these movies goated af
My favorite part of this movie was the Highway Chase.   Sure, the movie isn't critically acclaimed, and has valid criticisms, but sometimes you just need a dumb, fun, action-packed movies after a long hard day.
Oh my goodness, I loved these movies, but I just realized how much of a catastrophe they were in writing.
NGL when they killed of IRONHIDE I was pissed XD
When this movie came out in theaters I saw it with my dad and when ironhide died I started crying and begged my dad to leave bc he was my favorite autobot
The dude at 0:35 looks like Christopher Moltisanti
18:22 isn't quite obvious Megatron needs optimus to revive sentinel prime but the problem is during the year 2007-2009 Optimus didnt know sentinel prime crash landed on the moon until they discovered a autobot engine part in chernobly
its not like megan fo xwas was removed from the universe. wheelie said she dumped sam cuz she did not wanna die.
This movie rocks in 3D.
"Remember when the transformers bombed Iran? I didn't." *NFL theme intensifies as Bumblebee murders gate guards* Omfg that shit had me laughing my ass off!
I felt incredibly exhausted during this movie. Not mentally or emotionally exhausted as if it disappointed me. No, I felt physically fatigued and had to fight to keep awake in the theater. This movie weirdly soothed me in a way I didn't quite like the way it felt. It got to the city siege bit and I was kicking back, yawning, stretching, groaning, and not a single soul in the packed theater gave two shits. It seemed like everyone was in the same boat as me. We showed up for robots and explosions, we got that, and yet it wasn't enough.   One thing about it: I love how Buzz Aldrin in this movie feels stupid on both sides of it. Optimus has to kiss the ass of a human who took a comparative babystep compared to what his people can achieve, and Buzz has to act like it's a big deal that he's "meeting" a CGI robot whose backstory keeps changing.  "THE HONOR IS MINE" Why? Sure, for we humans, what Buzz and his team managed was the most impressive feat we've managed thus far, but in the greater scheme of the cosmos, it's the first little step out of many steps to come. The Cybertronians are robots that can turn into space vehicles if they want, to them what Buzz achieved would be virtually nothing. Imagine having to act like a literal baby taking its first step is the most impressive damn thing you ever saw, and that witnessing it is a massive honor to you.  On the side of Buzz: Imagine achieving the single greatest thing humanity has accomplished and forever being known for that (at least until humanity extincts itself here pretty soon), and you agree to playing it off as an alien toy conspiracy and "addressing" something you have to hallucinate as a "fellow space traveler." Take your proudest achievement, and then twist it into garbage for the sake of cheap fiction. Now amplify that by a few million. That's what Buzz Aldrin did here.
The best thing that came out of Transformers 4 was Optimus' whole "Knight" charade, that was pretty cool in my book. Other than that.. yikes
Is no one going to talk about "Trans theories"😂
While we're at it. Where are people getting that Megan Fox was blacklisted from Hollywood because of Bay?
6:59 that’s Patrick Dempsey not Patrick Swayze. Swayze died before this movie was made.
Waching intro about pokemon, after Palworld came out 🗿
just gonna say, the last movies are dogshit, but they have such good effects that they're still worth my while.
what I'm getting from this video is that I'm extremely biased when it comes to Transformers and I very easily ignore the obvious flaws that should make me run away
I feel like it was a huge missed opportunity to set Optimus up for a semi villain arc. They could have had Optimus slowly become more cold and aggressive over the course of the trilogy as he becomes more and more desperate to end the war. That would have been an awesome way to set up nemesis prime.
DOTM is the best in the franchise
i love transformers, but something my girlfriend has recently pointed out, it’s just dumb men fun, big robot turns into cool ass car then back into big robot and blows shit up, mabie in space
Not blood, red energon. Its just energon getting cauterized from severe head and critical organ damage.
0:08 That single laugh is the scariest threat of violence I have ever seen from a billionaire. Good job, Jeff 2:15 That aged well 23:50 & 24:45 What music plays here? I really like it
Okay so your points at 18:22 were actually meant to be explained in a post credit scene in ROTF but never got made. However I believe it made it into one of the games. All the moon decepticons were put there as a contingency in case the autobots found the ship. The plan was initially to use the pillars and bring the allspark back. Megatron left before sentinel did. Then bumblebee followed. IDW kind of ironed that out in there movie prequel series called defiance. Also the soundwave and his cronies were the ones who moved the pillars because they showed up some time around the 50s and routinely went from space to earth over and over.
Just saying big shuttle needs all the funding it can get. The government sure isnt doing it. For every dollar they spend at nassa they spend ten thousand on a slightly different model of a tank thats exactly the same but the button covers are a different color
*"When PG-13 pushed its limits"*Shows transformers 3*.  *Titanic with fkicing and bewbs scenes: Hold my beer*.
Hot take(maybe)? The violence in the bayverse is what made it  good and iconic. Nobody wants to see a constant cycle of the autobots taking the decepticons prisoner only for them to break out and kill thousands of people. Bayformers is unironically the most realistic depiction of the autobots and especially prime. Think about it for a second. Why would Optimus take megatron prisoner when he knows he’ll just break out and kill people or cause another world ending event? Optimus is so brutal because he’s not willing to let the decepticons destroy earth and let the war cause more casualties and destruction like it did his home, especially when innocent lives are on the line.
The saddest thing about the franchise is that the line “The deceptions got a better fate the autobots” works in many ways.
Why nobody talking about 1:23?
Naming a transforms channel trans theory is fucking hilarious.
People that watch these movies and critique them seriously likebthey going for a big award must be soooooo fun at parties😂😂😂  Dumb dumbs
That was basically somehow palatine return scene but in transformers
I always liked the concept that we went to the moon to explore a crashed alien ship
3:21 I didn't know handheld minigun is a thing in transformer 2. I mean despite everything else, the military was realistically equipped in the first movie.
17:15 megatrons wheel is clipping in the statue.
Certified  I D F  grindset
Dark of the Moon is the 2nd best Transformers film without a doubt and it's not even close.
I have that toy
I could be onboard with Optimus becoming a ruthless war criminal because he got tired of everything that was happening...if Michael Bay had actually supported that vision. As it stands, optimus is a vicious psychopath who finishes fighting and then immediately gives a speech about how humanity is so pure and needs to be saved
agreed on why you like it
Do you remember the Apollo 13 movie ? Scary one
Loved this movie as well, your explanation is fantastic and the damn spyro 2 soundtrack going on in the background...too good will keep watching your things good sir
Dont get the ROTF hate. TF2 was great, certainly WAY better than 3 and nobody can convince me otherwise.
Never understood the hate on the trilogy. These were the first transformers movies I watched when I was young and I loved them so much. Even after watching this video I don’t understand the hate. Just because it’s not exactly the same as the old school animations ? Idk maybe I’ll understand when they finally come round to Berserk and completely ruin that.
I don’t know something about hearing him say “you see the moon landing” after explaining that such batshit plot makes me chuckle every time
What is the music at 8:45😂
Megan and shia chemistry was perfect in the movies
FINALLY! Somebody agrees with me that the autobots began looking way to humanoid.
I’m a big fan of these movies cause it lets me turn my brain off and watch robots kill each other and execute pow’s
Okay but Optimus undergoing a subtle “he who fights monsters”-style fall to darkness over the course of the trilogy would actually be cool as hell if it was intentional and they did anything with it. Like imagine if the last scene is him going full evil and then the fourth movie is just straight up Optimus is the antagonist (and Bumblebee is the main robot protagonist again like the first half of the first movie promised me).
Sentinal had it coming
I know this video is a year old, but Intimidate lowers enemy Attack, not Special Defense
Transformers 3 is goated idc
19:50 what's the music
Its not war crimes if you win.
I originally really liked this shockwave design and among the other decepticons i still do. However, after seeing the gen 1 design in the bumblebee movie (as well as soundwaves) i realised why that design was just so much better, holy shit that was a great sequence by the way.
Ironhide getting killed off by sentinel prime scarred me when i went to the theaters on release and yes the most violent transformers movie I've ever seen lol
It’s simple, movie with robots, war, and cars. men love 🥹🥹
movie shockwave actually kinda still looks like shockwave.
4:05 *What?*
This makes me think a Titanfall 2 movie would be sick, but Respawn won’t stop milking Apex Legends to expand on the continuity, because it’s all the same universe, but one has micro-transactions.
No
1:54 it isn’t that bad of a movie
Honestly Transformers 3 is my favourite transformers movie only because of the third act.  The conspiracy and the alien invasion and the soundtrack is sick. Just my opinion.
Revenge of the fallen is the best transformer movie ever made. Do you not roaster or else?
6:57 that's not Patrick Swayze. It's Patrick Dempsey.
How did the cube & the space ship all make it to earth lmao
Intimidation reduces a pokemon's attack
The reason the ending was changed was because it was leaked online ahead of the movie's release. Bay was frustrated and still wanted to surprise audiences, so he had it altered.
Imagine if they filmed this in Detroit. Like, there would be no difference considering half the city looks like Batman's worst nightmare.
All i want is movies based off of the War for cybertron games, please 😂
I hate superman and batman idolizers. Everything has to be about being the bigger person and they never consider that maybe the other side is just too god damn small and cannot be reasoned with. This Optimus Prime is much better than a “wise” one that would prolong conflicts just for the sake of his pitiful ideals and not the lives of the innocent
See, I'm a simple woman. I like this movie cause i can shut my brain off and go "hoo haa.. woman like violence, cars and sexual jokes"  And i don't regret it
Actually the animal parts comes from another season called beast wars, where the cores has been transported to a planet which was full of flora and fauna, the cores needed to survive and get energy by hosting into animals to be also able to protrct themselves fro  destruction i believe, so its not weird
It wasn’t interstellar… but it was a fucking excellent transformers movie
Instantly lost me when he continuously implied that the current largest media franchise in the world had fallen off.
21:28 FACTS PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THIS
Never forgot when Optimus was supposed to be a serious yet kind leader and yet in these movies he literally says “give me your face” to the fallen 😭
This was my favourite transformers movie
lol try saying you’re a republican at your job in 2024. Be catching the next elevator down😅
what everyone fails to say is Carly was the original love Intrest in the cartoon anyway. Mikaela was just a side character for 1 episode lol.
Wait till this dude hears about rise of the beasts
Digging the Spyro music in the background
I watched all the transformers movies as a small child, maybe a bad call by my parents.
My family was really into NASCAR back in the day, so when their favorite driver Dale Earnhardt Jr's 88 car was made a Transformer, my whole family was happy as hell.
The movie is so syfy channel coded(I love it)
As amazing as the vfx’s are in this movie. The best in the series IMO (including Marky Mark’s terrible ones) Mikayla not being in the story has ALWAYS bugged me and made it almost unwatchable for me. As the video mentioned, the fact that it’s clearly her character being name changed is horrendous but what makes it even worse is the fact that Sam still has Mikayla’s dog! Like what the actual fuck?
Every transformer is a banger hating on it for the internet is wack
The brutality of Transformers 3 was awesome, I liked Ben Affleck's Batman too.
Optimus Prime: "Give me your face!"
14:54 Yea its super goofy for the most part, but in most Transformers mdia Shockwave specifically has been a downright menace at his best and a genocidal, time traveling tyrant who tried to destroy the entire universe at his worst, so badassifying him is well deserved
"Pokemon don't pass out anymore, they die," so basically Palworld
My reaction to this: ahahahahahahahah
It's funny because they never went to the moon, there playing with themselves 😂😂
"this idiots were supposed to be purple!" You made my day dude😂
4:03 I’m not even offended by that “WTF.” That lady is messed up.
Transformers 3 was the least violent Chicago's ever been
"Give me your face!" "Give me your head!" "Give me a break!"
Patrick Swayze... That's Patrick Dempsey
That buzz aldrin scene was dope lol
The "Give me your face" line is a good one. Really sets the mode
thanks
i didnt realize that cybertron had signed the geneva convention
Love the gritty and brutal side of the bayverse transformers films, by far one of the best film series. I found all of this relevant and hilarious 😂
I think all the ones with Shia Lebouf in it are awesome. Everything after that is corny
Here's the thing buddy. Wearing nostalgic glasses doesn't blind you from the truth, it makes you have zero hate towards something unlike the general critic mindset, to where you can finally appreciate it for what it is. That's why someone defends something. They have no unnecessary hate in the way and can finally see the positives that greatly out weigh the negatives in a non biased, fair sense. They aren't trying to defend it, they genuinely enjoy the heck out of it. Whereas someone with the opposite of nostalgia glasses purposely wants to find reasons to hate something (usually with an expectation in mind that the bandwagon has forced down their throats and onto their mindsets).  It's like cars in the mid 1960s to early 1970s, they ("nostalgia glasses fans") weren't trying to be long vehicles to outbeat someone else, that was simply the design style of those years..., whereas modern car designs (desperate critics) make it a spectacle when they try to make a long car, making sure it's one of the key features mentioned about it. One didn't try, the other is jealous...jealous in a sense that they can't stand (this part doesn't work with the analogy) seeing all these people like something that they don't like, and so DOUBLE down on it, attacking it like it just killed their first dog, spitting angrily at those other people, trying to present them as inhuman and not in the right mindset "IT'S THEIR ROSE TINTED GLASSES GETTING IN THE WAY!" Yah sure.
People forget that these movies were funded, overseen and checked off on by Spielberg, a very respected producer and director. Which is the same thing for Zack snyders dc universe, which was also funded, overseen and checked off on by Chris Nolan. So by that logic if you think these are bad movies then you don’t respect Spielberg and nolanss opinion. Changes perspective doesn’t it.
nah bro 1:23 got the dogs sus
3:57 - I don't know why I find this part funny since you edited her walk away, lol!. 😂.
Fun fact, In the 2011 daytona 500 parade laps, there were 3 cars out with the other cars that were exact replicas of the Nascar cars from this movie, with all the guns and armor on them. The announcers even compared them to the other cars on track.
Say real tho, I want that Pokémon war crime movie
This movie was fucking amazing
I think this movie is pretty fire 🤝
Optimus maybe a war criminal, but a good one
Glad I wasn't the only one that thought "huh, this is pretty brutal for pg13." But then again, 'The Longest Day' is a G rated D-Day movie.
So glad I got to know this channel. The comparison of that transformer leaving flying vertically to the los simpsons homers character had me dying 😂😂😂 that was genius
Am I just stupid, or did half of the new autobots just appear put of nowhere? I had no clue where 15ft tall Albert Einstein came from. Also, I watched 5 minutes of this film when I was really young. It was probably during that mexican standoff between 2 autobots and the fucking predator decepticons. I hated these films purely on the fact that they had metal hair
0:55 IRISH POKEMON IRISH POKEMON!!!
Earth is the bermuda triangle of the transformers universe
There is no geneva convention in space
He we suppose to be the original main villain
The 3rd on is my favorite. The guy that could control the giant worm was so cool. It's funny stupid also.
you didn't have to put that scream on him, did him dirty 7:05
Thank God this was the final Transformers movie in the "trilogy"
I won't blame Bay, I like the plot but neglecting the Megan Fox situation didn't help this. I would rather have Sam broke up with Megan Fox's character off screen and he just solo'd this movie. Would have improved Shia LaBeouf's acting career as an action star
Transformers 3 was a violent and dumb movie filled with action robots beating the sht out of each other...... I was also a teenage kid back in the time so all that sht was actually targeted to me at the time aswell, guess they hit the right demographic despite being a dumb movie
Didn't know Shockwave is the Lisan al Ghaib and control's Shai Halud
Man what even better about this video it released on my birthday now that good 10/10 video
Funny thing is that when you look up the cast later, you find a few hidden gems, like the lady who told someone not to take a picture of a dead Ken Jeong, she apparently was the voice of Naruto.
Dark of the moon is without a doubt the best tranformers movie. Best characters, best villain, best plot, and that final battle is easily the most epic battle ever in tranformers history. That final battle will never be topped.
Transformers Dark of the Warcrimes
I love this film
My sister was in Chicago when they filmed, she got to watch as they wingsuited through the city
Patrick Dempsey*
that sounds like an awesome pokemon movie tbh
Dark side of the moon is my favorite transformers movie out of the 6 or 5 movies except the sexual scenes.
He is Optimus Crime.
Please do a video on Transformers: Prime
What's with that opening? Transformers started off being brutal. Gen 1 was notorious for kiling off Prime even.
20:53- CHARLIE BERENS?????????
It's so good
It's so good
Nah they trying to pull a combine 💀💀💀
I went to see this movie in 3D when it released, and to this day the last third of this movie is probably the best use of 3D I've seen in any film.
Rip ironhide
All the transformers are absolute art and need more praise, they will go down in history as the greatest original trilogy of all time. Dark of the moon is the greatest action film of all time
A thing I also like in this movie is Soundwave being an amazing spymaster and pulling off the conspiracy pretty much on is own.  Heck, this might be the most efficient Decepticon in the 5 films.
So here’s an interesting fact, the Dark of the Moon game actually mentions that Shockwave crash landed on earth a thousand years ago where he was discovered by the Soviets. With this we can assume that the Fuel Rod was first raided off Sentinel’s ship by Shockwave whom then crash landed on earth where he was found by the soviets, who then took the fuel Rod.
Where's the word "side"?  Dark SIDE of the Moon?
11 year old me was PISSED about them killing ironhide. Sat clutching my ironhide toy
Iron hide got done dirty 😢
11:09 lmfao 😂😂
this movie makes me uncomfortable a lot, but the real thing i hate about this movie is how they did my boy Ironhide dirty
Why does a lot of alt history YouTubers have PH as their channel initials, Pointless Hub and possible history, and outside of alt history YouTubers Por-
The autobots weren’t the rebels in the war, they never were. They were the ones in control of the government, Optimus lied.
bro predicted palworld in the beginning
+++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++  11:58  08:26  +++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++
That is my favorite movie from franchise
Wait so ur telling me people don’t like transformers dark of the moon, I thought that was the best movie they made
I love this movie. It’s personally my second favourite one out of all off them just behind the original and that’s probably because I’m a fourteen year old that likes the monstervers and grew up on movie like the avengers and fast and furious cos that prolly why.
i also like it
I wish they made a moving exploring the PTSD of the transformer, at least some pathway down that road
I kinda like that Optimus hit his “yeah imma just start killing stuff” mode. His hero ex boss who was supposed to finally save earth turns evil, watches his enemies decimate the race that revived him and gave him a home. Still a force of good, just less forgiving.
That introduction is basically Palworld.
When I was a kid I honestly loved all 3 of the movies and I thought all of them were pretty great, I mean I still do think all 3 are great and I just dont understand why people are hating it
“Freedom is the right of all sentient life” Optimus prime 6 minutes before beheading megatron and executing sentinel prime with a shotgun
Out of all the Transformers movies, it's honestly the one I can tolerate the most. I never cared for rhe original.
11:56 diamonds are forever reference
I adore the Buzz Aldrin bit, because he famously hated conspiracy theorists, plus its so cheesey I can't watch without crackers. As bad as this one is, its also kinda my favourite.  At least Marky Mark isnt in it.
Megan Fox used to be quite good looking, but LA has done her no favours.
You just earned a sub👍🏿
Fully planned on turning this video off after 5 minutes. 25 minutes later I’m going to bed happy. Love
Loved the movie because it wasnt scared to show heros doing what needs to be done. Unlike batman who indirectly caused the deaths of so many because of his shitty ideology
No matter how much criticism this movie gets it will have a special place in my heart, for the fact my day was in the movie as on of the military extras and every time I watch this movie I have to always point out the part my dad is in.
Fitting Megan Fox consumes Machine Gun Kelly's blood. She's Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1.
Watching this and playing palworld has me crying laughing now cause of the intro😂😂😂😂
"han hooks up with that blue chick and leia gets cast off into space" . . . . and then you cut to sequel leia getting cast off into space. It's like I can never escape JJ Abrams just maliciously destroying everything that is good and wholesome in the world. ITS BEEN YEARS WHEN WILL I HEAL?!?!?!
*pushes up glasses* . . .  Um . . . . . In Pokemon, "Intimidate" lowers physical attack. Not special defense.
Guys watch17:14 in this video and look at Megatron's left leg
I never watched this garbage heap because they got rid of Megan Fox. It gets a 0/10
Im only in 6min into this video & i have to agree with you. I can’t stand douche bag bay &  I am not a fan of Speilberg anymore. However, these crappy movies are a guilty pleasure of mine.
0:50 good news, we have this now.
Why does Deep Wang STILL MAKE ME LAUGH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
12:39 well Lorewise autobots don’t really use flying vehicles. They’re mainly terrain only but the Decepticons usually take flight so it’s a lot easier for them to intercept flying ships since the autobox usually have to build their ships instead of being the ships themselves, so it makes sense that the Deceptikon have a greater Air Force than the auto bots air superiority is very important
The opening to this review is doubly hilarious with the sudden success of Palworld this week. Exactly what he described.
“Remember kids, the Geneva convention doesn’t apply to transformers!”
listen. i like to think mikaela got tired of sam's nonsense and finally dumped his ass for a guy that wouldn't treat her like an accessory.
I don’t care what anyone says, this is pure unbridled entertainment
I know I’m a year late from commenting but I just realized you’ve played the tekken 1 Chicago theme
I literally just noticed that when the deceptions start blowing shi up   They start shooting at random innocents who explode! Leaving their forsaken skulls behind 💀💀  How was this pg 13
16:12 Somehow Paplpatine returned
Does anybody else think it’s weird that Neil a. Is alien backwards
Shockwave is the only one whose toned down in this movie, like bro makes satan look like a child in the comics and animated serieses
3:18 I liked Revenge of the Fallen😔 I watched it just as many times as the first movie because I was also a teen who loved good cgi violence. I guess I watched it enough to tune out the bad lines and overly sexual scenes so I could focus on the action.  I liked that the former Sec. 7 guy was on the same team again, along with the journey without Optimus, and the idea that the transformers had been much more involved with humanity than originally depicted.  At the time, we had no timeline for when Bee originally got to Earth and how long he had to wait before Optimus’ team got there. The plot could’ve made Bumblebee so he was partially responsible for Megatron being frozen and fought Decepticons with a skeleton crew during the cold war.  Imagine a Transformers: Cold War, but done right…  • You can’t say “there weren’t major battles in the cold war” because they’re *robots in disguise.* You could run with the black ops theme of movies 2 & 3.  • You could also have Jetfire before he literally starts falling apart.  • You’d have a brand new Autobot team, but with the familiarity of Bumblebee. The “new” autobots could even be from the old cartoons.  • We could get more info on how Sector 7 and NASA got involved with the transformers.  I think this would’ve made a great 4th movie, but they decided Marky Mark with a sword gun, Katara tentacle corn, and Ed Sheeran go vroom was a better plot. Let’s not forget that Age of Extinction is most likely after Sam’s death and neither Bumblebee or Optimus mention it at all. I blame the 4th movie for the downfall in plot consistency.
0:43 Have you ever heard of Palworld? It's more darker than you think.
Yes. It's interesting though - when I talk about Transformers to folks I know, when I tell them that Optimus is a twisted, evil, genocidal egomaniac, they have a look of surprise and kind of look slightly offended, like I just told their first born child is going to hell or something. Even after I break it down for them scene for scene.
13:50 … and heaven knows im miserable now
They killed Starscream...  He was my favorite
Wait a minute so Buzz Aldrin was actually  in the movie
Best part of the video starts around 19:03 when the Transformers theme comes on 😅😅😅😅
Megatron's feet clip through the stairs at 17:15
For anyone that grew up with the transformers cartoons, and still has their toys, check to make sure they're okay. I had forgotten I had a boxed G1 Optimus and boxed G1 Megatron stored away in the attic along with dozens of loose G1 transformers. I was shocked to find out the other week that a boxed Megatron in good condition, like mine is, is alone worth over $1,000 now. I've got a whole new outlook on storing my old toys! Between my old Transformers, Star Wars, He-Man, Hornby Trainsets, Voltron, Mask, Zoid toys etc. it's looking to be well over $20k in toys.
Holy fuck, that whole thing with the girlfriend makes so much fucking sense.   It would have actually worked well if they didn't replace Megan Fox.  His relationship with Carley feels super out of place.
The wreckers remind me of    " WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETER?!? "
I find it hilarious that Ed Boone cast her as Nitara in the new Mortal Kombat game, considering what she’s done
I actually really enjoyed this movie too 😂 the third act was my favorite hour or so of the entire series
17:04 😂😂 I fucking died at how abrupt that was
As for how the Cons were able to bring the pillars to Earth there are multiple Decepticons that are capable of spaceflight. In G1 one named Astrotrain is used as a space transport.
"A good soundtrack can hide a films flaws" *points at Pacific Rim*
“ Bay didn’t hate her , Spielberg not so much” Dark of the Moon having several instances and dialogue where the trash on her, including the two microbots…(like at 7:40).
I think you mean that Apollo 11 film staring Clair Foy, who was fantastic, with Ryan Gosling as her arm candy.
They went rogue I didn’t know they were gonna
Rose Huntington knightly is so hot in this.
Honestly them switching up the cast and changing the main character as being Megan Fox,. I was really confused because I was a teen too, but I still liked the movie it was when they put the other guy in changed the main character. I stopped liking it as much.
I honestly think war of the planet of the apes shouldn’t of been pg13
The first movie was great.  The second and third movies were great if you dont expect much and didnt take it seriously. Everything that was bad in those 2 movies were the kind that were funny because of how bad/cringey they were, and they were outweighed mostly by the good.  The 4th one was so bad, I didnt bother watching the 5th.  And that sounds like the correct decision considering Ive heard the 5th was worse than the 4th.
7:05 really got me
The first 8mins of this film is so well put together i dont think I've seen an intro like this be done so well in such a long time when it comes to modern big budget movies and I don't think it gets enough credit.  Everything from the music, special effects and the overall execution just makes it really engaging.
Your Hilarious you should recap low budget horror movies it would be so funny.
Really funny how ironhide is voiced by the same dude that voiced wakko from the Animaniacs and crash bandicoot Only two of these characters has survived.....
You know I always wondered if the writer was British the sequels could have been better
17:14 i just realized magatrons foot was cliping through the stairs here
The reason why we didn’t have the ending is because when you click on the on the movie tickets on a website you can on a little icon and show the ending so they had to change it 😮
That toy story 2 game music in the background is fire!
He was wounded and only had one arm to hold a gun.  Sentinel was on ground but still full health.  Optimus only had seconds to act.
Nice video
I see where the “Somehow Palpatine has returned” line came from
Tbh every time I see one of these movies I’m so happy that I’m not a prude when it comes to movies and that I’m easy to please
Nothing like trying to figure out for 2 weeks why I wanted to play PS1 Spyro so bad... then putting these vids on again to show my boyfriend and realizing it was this video!! Great bg music taste, 10/10.
this must be only me but i literally see every bayformers movie as an orange mess idk why-
Am I one of the few people who likes Transformers 3 and 4 the best out of the rest?
The war is why I love this movie
They took Megan Fox out of this movie and threw her into TMNT. I kinda wish it was the other way around, they dropped Sam from the movie, Shia Lebeouf went on to be in the TMNT movies and Megan Fox stayed as the main character of the Transformers franchise. It wouldn't have made the movies much better but I think they would have been somewhat better. You could even replace Cade Yeager's character with Mikaela because the main thing he does in the beginning is restart Optimus and Mikaela could believably do that.
megatron sitting in lincoln’s seat at the lincoln memorial is the coolest thing i’ve ever seen
the mountain dew machine launching cans at people was the peak of transformers 1
20:29 this sucks especially since, while comparing bayverse and g1 doesn’t typically end up anywhere, shockwave was trusted enough by megatron to safeguard all of cybertron, and does that, but in this movie, he just kinda… dies
7:33 Erm akkshually she is green not blue ☝️🤓
Its like in the rise of skywalker, "SoMeHoW PaLpAtInE rEtUrNeD" just wave it away and dont give a shit about an explanaiton😂
I'll never get over what they did to ironhide man...
I remember this on release day in the theater. A kid and his dad were behind me, and the moment Ironhide was on screen, the kid was telling him how much he loved Ironhide and how he was his favorite... the moment he was shot and killed the kid screamed "OH MY GOD!"  Michael Bay destroyed that kid's child hood in a moment. I'll never forget that moment haha.
Makes sense Spielberg wasn’t okay with the hitler jokes though. Idk if it makes either of them a little bitch to remove someone that crass and senseless from their project I’d fire her too.
that "ball" is a spark, the ship was the Ark, the Ark is a autobot, they ripped out a giant autobot's spark from its alt-mode while it was in a dormant state, now it is dead
You know, I always thought NASA decided to never, ever collaborate with Michael Bay after Armageddon
As a kid I had the Xbox 360 game that came out along with this film, and it's probably nostalgia but omfg that game fucking slapped
4:05   MK 1 devs: we got Nitara!
Dark of the Moon is my favorite of these movies because it'S HONEST. It doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: 3 hours of senseless violence between giant robots
11:34 don't forget that Autobots always despised by human in the first or second act and than they come back and said something like "I told you"
I like the way Optimus gets more violent. It's realistic. This wasn't meant to be a cartoon. He watched his friends die over years. Being a clean good guy isn't feasible. He has hate in his heart for the decepticons.
It's OK Cody. I like dark of the moon too
The engine part is explained in the transformers 3 game, the own decepticons gave the part to the russians. They could get it because they had a ship in the game.
The edited SpongeBob clips are always gold!
Bruh Intimidate lowers Attack.
I mean, Shockwave isn’t really a goofball. In many continues he is actually a psychopathic war criminal scientist, so the only thing I’m mad about this portrayal of him is how dumb he is
This was my first transformers movie and I liked it a lot.
I liked it bc it was so "dark". And i actually liked the design more than the original.
0:49 🤢 wtf is thing oh god fucking jesus
5:46 you can fix this problem by simply recasting the character it’s not like Meghan Fox is a great actor any woman in Hollywood around the same age with similar hair colour could have played Machael
You know, these movies are kind of like the Star Wars prequels. They're loud, dumb, poorly written, and weird. But there's genuine fun to be had here if you just take a deep breath and accept all of these things about them. No one is calling them cinematic masterpieces... because they're bad. But if you want to just watch big robots kill each other (or ludicrously over-choreographed lightsaber fights) then that's totally fine!
I have another guilty pleasure of a movie: Looney Toons Back in Action. Sometimes a movie is so bad but you can’t help but enjoy it regardless
Is no one going to bring up how he said "maybe Shockwave is like a Pokémon and he uses intimidation to lower special defense" even though Intimidate lowers Attack? Just me?
You should do a retrospective on the Terminator franchise.
Give me your face
18:31 WHY DOES MY G LITTERALLY HAVE AN ANIME NAME
I sometimes randomly do a impression of Sentinel Prime dying for my sister ("Everything I did...Was for the good of my race...Wait! No! Optimus, Please!!!" *screams*) she's never seen a Transformers.
The thing with Mikaela is that the literally could have just recast her. They didn’t have to turn her into a different person entirely. Series swap actors all the time for a multitude of reasons. Take Katie Holms in Batman begins as Rachel for example. In the next movie she was played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. But she still played Rachel. They didn’t turn her into a different character because that wouldn’t have made sense. Just like how Carly makes no sense in this film.  I’m still kinda butthurt about that. I don’t even think Megan fox is a good actress tbh, she’s just hot. They could have actually casted a good actress to play Mikaela in dark of the moon but instead they just cut her character and replaced her with one that comes out of no where. It was very jarring. Made me feel like I missed a film or something
i also like this movie for some reason but something that's always bugged me is that the entire decepticon plan to use these pillars was impossible before revenge of the fallen, and seemingly hinges on the Fallen losing in the movie, and furthermore involves the decepticons shooting themselves in the foot. The whole deal is to use another species, in this case humans, as slaves to rebuild cybertron, but the decepticons shot down sentinel's ship and inadvertently killed him and lost the pillars, and they then couldn't have used the matrix to revive him since they didn't know where it was, couldn't use it themselves (since only someone worthy could do so, although i suppose since the Fallen was a Prime he can?), and had Optimus not been revived they both wouldn't have been able to revive Sentinel and furthermore would've lost all their slave labor and apparently their pillars since they were hiding them on Earth And its not like the decepticons didn't know this was the plan until recently, since the deal was made with Megatron  edit: evidently i typed all this out before a lot of these questions were also asked, but ill leave it up for posterity. As compensation, i will tell everyone that the prequel comics to this movie have Shockwave killing a lot of the autobots that existed on Earth, mainly those that were in the last movie but weren't in this one. As a further point, an attack from Shockwave is the in-universe reason why Wheeljack and Mirage go by different names and look kinda weird in this movie. The out of universe reason (at least for Mirage/Dino) is that the car companies that made the cars they transform into didn't want their cars associated with an existing character on film, for some reason, although they were still called Mirage and Wheeljack in the toys and comics. This is also the reason why Sideways dies so fast in RotF, and it’s a similar reason as to why Ironhide dies in this movie, since GMC was ceasing production on the GMC Topkick that he transforms into and it was easier to kill him than it was to find another truck
Ironically Mikaela dumping Sam for seemingly no reason made sense to me after all the redpilling I got.
I guess Sentinel prime never heard of war crimes
22:37 he rips out his entire spine as well.
It also makes you think back to transformers 1. When blackout is flying, he follows every order the soldiers give him. He follows, he lands, he turns off the engine. When asked to step out of the helicopter, he transforms (because that's how he could do it) and is immediately shot at. So the destruction of the base was kind of self defence
I’m glad you brought up the soundtrack (21:15). I feel like Steve Jablonsky does not get a lot of credit for The Score he made for this franchise. The movies are not perfect, but the soundtrack is amazing and Dark Of The Moon is my favourite out of all five. I just wish iTunes and Spotify didn’t remove this film’s Score from their website. God Bless Steve Jablonsky.
watching Optimus kill robot Mr Spock was i think probably traumatizing ngl
It's funny for me, that ppl hates this movie, because it's different and they added new things... Like i get it, it maybe wasn't the best movie of all time, but I dont get it, why you MUST see the same thing over and over again. I'm glad, they changed how robots looks like, i like how they added new things and stuff. The plot is a mess, but still. Don't cry about robots design changed from something crated like 20-30 years ago. I'd hate to watch a movie, with characters looking like from that anime.   I'm not hating, just sharing my thought
Look man one thing I will say that you got wrong is Megan Foxx definitely was regularly sexually harassed on set and stuff, so like, her being 'let go' did have a bit of that going on. Tbh her comments are fair considering what Bay put her through.
To be honest, it would have been cool as fuck to have Sam and Dylan have a MGR fight as cyborgs or something. I have always said that Metal Gear is practically the only popular franchise where a crossover would actually work in favor of the bayverse designs.
Never really realized this when I watched them but still loved the action though
I know u said special defense on purpose
24:29 What else can I say…Run lol
"Big Shuttle" killed me lmao
I was lowkey sad when Ironhide died
11 year old me was so in love with this movie. It was so amazing that when all hope was genuinely lost for the audience. When we were sure we needed a miracle for Witwicky to live, and we knew one couldn’t come. And then Boom comes the first shot. And in milliseconds the audience is thinking is it the army? It can’t be autobots. Screw that, it’s the flipping miracle. IT WAS SO COOL. Clearly people would die in this movie; I was genuinely scared we would lose main characters. I’m 23 today, you can’t take this from me. It was the coolest scene in any movie I’ve watched. I was fully emotionally captivated at the time. What an experience. I don’t think I’ve ever felt like that since. Maybe avengers endgame when the whole universe comes to fight thanos. Hate on Michael Bay. He gave me a lot of the best movies of my childhood and teenage years. Meanwhile teaching me that the main character is always nice and is willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Like Tom hollands Spider-Man. Nobody will take my love for dark of the moon from me
Considering the allegory made by Cody in his video about the second movie that it feels like Megatron was beten up in the playgroung and he brought his grandpa to the fight; the third movie feels like Megatron now brought Optimus Prime grandpa.
Is it weird I forgot it wasn’t Megan Fox in this movie?
The ironic part is that even though there is a lot of death there is still more bot kills in the 86 movie
Its time for megatron dance some tango
Dude Optimus became Scorpion at the end
I wish it was more heavily emphasised that he became more violent because he kept watching all his friends die. In Tf 1 he acted like gen one Optimus using violence as a last resort and refusing to kill megatron. And he slowly becomes more enraged and psychotic as the trilogy progresses because he keeps watching g everyone die and betray him
Hey what's that music at "how they wingsuit into the city" at 19:50 from? I've heard it around but I don't know if it's long enough for me to Shazam it.  Edit so I looked into it more and it's the theme for one of the recent Battlefield games
11:28 I have that Bumblebee toy
im glad rise of the beasts and bumblebee were actually good and fun movies and not just fun movies.
"Freedom is the right of all sentient beings, but you know that treating the enemy like a non-sentient bitch is the only way to end this god forsaken war".
How are you so geeked about the Apollo missions and dont know anything about the Luna moon missions?
19:49 love that lil bf 2042 bit :')
The fact that you use transformers galaxy forces soundtrack for this gives me a new level of respect for you
Whats even worse is that the of ending for revenge of the fallen was supposed to show megatron see that the fallen led to him and that his allegiance to the deceptions was for nothing and sentinel was a back up plan. It would have made more sense for the og ending of dark of the moon and none of those terrible sequels.
Icl I fuggin loved this movie when it came out when I was a kid and I still stand by it. Just pretend you're 12 and enjoy a whole 2 hours of cool robots and action scenes 🤷
that "takeover of chicago" scene always gives me the chills. it has that "you now know how powerful transformers are in their tech. there is nothing we can do." aesthetic
Oh, you support trans rights? Name every transformer
Transformers 3 is by far just as good as the 07 movie but the trilogy which Michael Bay has created is perfect until age of extinction
Always gnna be people like you putting down movies like Asif you could make anything better😂
That’s not Patrick Swayze, it’s Patrick Dempsey. otherwise solid video
I don't mind the brutality. They are sentient beings at war
Sentinel had it coming
Man was BUGGIN in this movie
The idea of a British woman being called “Carly” is just hilarious to me
The original trilogy transformers movies will always be my favorite movie's the rest of the bayverse dont exist dotm was the end aoe and tlk is a dlc or something.
I agree that this one was pretty good
DEEP WANG
It bothers me how weak Optimus is when it comes to fighting the main bad guys in these movies. He never really beat any of them on his own and was always being saved by someone.   TF 1: His ass was continuously whooped by Megatron, and Sam had to save him by using the All-Spark.   TF 2: He had to wear the corpse of Jetfire to have an advantage against The Fallen and Megatron.   TF 3: He got mutilated by Sentinel and had to be saved by Megatron. He then mutilated Megatron and publicly executed Sentinel afterwards because both of them were too injured to fight. I don't even think Optimus landed a solid hit against Sentinel; I think Megatron did all the damage, and Optimus just finished the job.   TF 4: He got stabbed in the chest by Lockdown and had to be saved by Cade, Tessa, the pedophile BF, and Bumblebee. And while Lockdown was distracted, he stabbed the guy in the back, which is pretty ironic considering stabbing someone in the back is probably the most un-knightly and dishonorable thing he can do with all the knight and honor theme Optimus has going on. Again, I don't think Optimus even landed a solid hit against Lockdown; Cade and the gang probably did most of the damage, and Optimus just finished the job.   TF 5: I purposely blocked this movie from my memory. I refuse to rewatch it or remember anything from it.  This would've been fine if Optimus learned an actual valuable lesson at the end of every movie, but at the end of the day, he never had any character development, so the only lesson he always learned is "being a war criminal is effective... and fun." Goddamn these movies.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) Box Office: $2.104 billion
I genuinely like the first three Transformers Bayverse films.  Also given everything that Optimus went through (including him DYING), him committing War Crimes isn’t unprecedented.  Also also, the Autobots in the comics are War Criminals. Not really Optimus but several others are.
I would love the original ending, because it seems more natural to me.
WHAT IS THIS INTRO BRO I TOUGHT I ACCIDENTLY PRESSED ON THE WRONG VIDEO
Bayverse Optimus Prime is essentially the giant alien robot version of the Doom Slayer or Kratos and i am absolutely here for it. He'll defend the innocent, protect the weak and stand up for his friends, by tearing the enemies face off, ripping him in half and hacking him to pieces with a 1000° F sword.
I honestly find this the second best after the 1st movie
Funny thing about the Intro, the original Pokémon Manga, that was released before the Anime aired, actually had Pokémon getting seriously injured or just straight up dying in battle, it was only with the Anime that they changed to the more child-friendly tone it hab since.
Honestly I would've preferred the truce ending than the ending we got
I think the fine details make sense when you realize none of them were meant to crash, i think the full plan was to go to earth find the allspark have sentinel bridge cybertron close so they can easily revive it, and if anything goes wrong the star harvester and the matrix are also on the planet
I never thought about all of thins when I was 12 years old 😂 sometimes you just need to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie but good observation
actually thought the best thing about this one was the set-up. Just thought the idea that the moon landings happened because the US wanted to beat the Soviets to a crashed alien spacecraft seemed pretty cool, tapping into all the wacky conspiracy theories. About half way through i got bored though and felt Sentinel's about-turn to antagonist very forced. Clearly they wanted to hark back to Nimoy voiceing Galvatron in the '86 film. The worst thing is the US jingosim though, especially referencing any country 'merica currently had an issue with being a target for the Autobots. Still, you can't knock that final battle.
I didn't even know Cody had a second channel
This is why I love dotm they do what I do too! ( war crimes)
The first three Bayverse Transformers were good, the last two sucked and we all know it. Plus, Bay didn’t even want to do the second one but was forced to by the studio, and Bay didn’t know shit from shinola about Transformers or their universe. Sure, the movies weren’t the greatest, they could’ve been better and the voice actors that we know and love for certain characters, Peter Cullen and Frank Welker, but they were good for what they were. Thankfully we got away from that with the Bumblebee and Rise of the Beasts. Those were masterful.
I’m an inventor
What i look for in live action big robot movies is the carnage and dark of the moon delivers on that for me
I think the only thing I can remember about this movie was Laserbeak, only because that one scared the ever loving shit out of me when I was a kid
2:48 23:51
9:21 the twin tower is about to be hit again
5:08 Spielberg is a Jew. Jew's have the power (deny it all you want...). ANY slight criticism of them or their projects requires the ending of the Gentile who utter such blashpemy. So no while I do not like Bay, this was alllll Spielberg.
4:03 That's Megan? Looks like a bad version of a 50 yo Pam Anderson, yikes
Only Transformer movie I like. It just works. Shia is a tad annoying and the blonde is too plastic-pretty, but I still rewatch. After inserting that pedo-apologist "get out of jail card" scene Michael put in the 4th I exited from seeing any more.  Edit: been maybe at least 5 years since I saw 3. WOW i forgot how violent. Yeah this title aint clickbait lol
Notes for the future: don’t reference racists like jontron
@6:57 - Patrick Dempsey  Not Swayze. LOLZ
THe worm and all the drones are shockwave, they talk about it when someone asks wtf that thing is and the answer is shockwave so its an extension of him...
I will say it really may just be hydraulic fluid, you know being machines and all...
To be fair....Ahsoka is WAY hotter than the Princess.
Only I like any of the Michel bay movies is Dark of the moon, Shockwave.   I just don't really care for their plots or the visuals so just having a fav character in it makes it even slightly cool.   Anyway, drillerbot is very cute and the best park of these movies.
My teenage ass was pissed Ironhide got shot in the back like that didn’t even get to go out like the badass he was
"What if we leave And your wrong"
My friends and I once decided to have a movie day and decided to watch everything on transformers. I never thought that the history of my country was turned into a desert by the uprising for freedom, the crazy head of the uprising, although he started with a really good fuse, getting the army hooked on drugs because there was not enough food, transferring the war to another territory because now it's just a wasteland, most of the population is killed and now it's it's just a bloody mess and everyone who hopes for is the other side, which is just as bad, it's just that this leader loses his mind more slowly. And I live in it, La, transformers are my life.
I hated "First Man", purly because it was filmed entirly in Shaky Cam even when characters were sitting quietly in a room.
I think Buzz liked it because it ackowledged that he went to the moon.
С удовольствием смотрю ваши ролики
Has this movie always been called "Dark of the Moon" and not dark side of the moon?
wait she was in the third movie just to say ex i dont remember that lol
I don't recall ever being asked who I voted for when applying for a job. 6:33
15:05 His name is Gothmog, you muppet. He's also known as Durin's Bane. There's more than one!
This was a great movie, and I agree with your points, but I do miss Megan Fox. She deserved better as she was everyone’s celeb crush, not someone to be exploited for their physical appearance. The Autobots shouldn’t have been hunted as shown in AoE as they are supposed to protect humanity.
I'm a little peeved you didn't show the iconic "I want two!" scene when mentioning Transformers being ripped in half
I love how any time a movie portrays the military in an ok light people say it’s helping the military industrial complex.
At least there wasn't a scene about the age of consent laws in Texas.
This is canonically the best bayformers movie
Putting the classic transformers theme over the decepticons fucking disintegrating humans is perfect
You should start watching this from the moment the space shuttle explodes and they pretend the autobots are dead
I loved transformer 3 ❤ and the first instalment
Sex with dogs
yes. the last hour of this movie is the only reason why i like this movie. with the first 2, even when i was 7 (ish), even i didn't really enjoy the first 2 movies (partially bc of the sheer number of sexual references) bc the action didn't feel that cool. this movie is when transformers began to be cool. and it is because of this that i  (hot take) like transformers 4. yes, it's bad. but i just don't care. im just here to see epic robots fight each other.
Transf-war-mers
I am so eternally happy I fell onto this page
We was supposed to get it and it was going to be a great ending but some piece of shit decided to spoiler it so they replace the ending
It's wild because of the fact that you can make an Optimus Prime who is a war criminal, morally questionable, etc. I think it would be intersting to go over the morals, and ethics of both the autobots and depictions
Intimidate lowers attack in Pokémon.
8:35 It more seemed a competition then a war to the death in the ones i remember.
I absolutely love dark of the moon and the transformers trilogy
I find it funny how the immature live action version of Transformers got rid of Shockwaves huge, voluptuous, gigantic, giant bahonkerdonkerbonkers.
Transformers just love war crimes
The fact that they had “blood” wasnt the issue. It’s the fact that they could not keep a solid color scheme for the energon. Energon, their life source, their “blood” is blue as we can see in the cartoon and in other films. Their life source is Blue? but Michael bay kept changing the colors. We don’t see much of it in the first two films but then he decided to make energon pink in the dark of the Moon. And green in age of extinction, and the last knight, which is entirely on the fault of Michael Bay not sticking to the canonical, consistent color of energon and making it whatever color he wants to a scene. The only thing from Cybertron that would have a chance of being pink or green, would be Terracon blood (which would be lockdown) or the different types of high grade and low grade, the transformers natural food source from Cybertron.
Optimus was always the robot you don't want to see entering a battle field. He was strong enough to end any fight. Thing is his moral code was so strong that he would often not end the threats. They could have worked so many story beats around that it's not even funny. Even having a rogue Autobot, or a rogue Decepticon after the truce.
Fun fact: there is no "dark side" of the moon.
14:41 I don't know if it was before or after the movie was out, but they had a full game for this movie that is a prequel explaining some of the thing that happen in the off-screen in the movie (it was a good game too)
Chicago was still in better shape after that battle than it is today.
Okay but hang on, at 16:30 you mention there's no explanation in the movie for how the Russians got the engine (hoping you touch on this later) but the movie does explain that the decepticons brought the engine back to lure the autobots to the moon so optimus would revive sentinal
the reasin the plan wasnt the first plan is simple. they couldnt do it. because sentinal was dead the decepticons knew that so plan cancelled then optimus obtained a revive potion so wow we can revive sentinel and teleport our of planet army here
I think this was the Transformer's film for which Stuart Ashen posted a review that just consisted of him with a bitter expression facepalming.
First Man was a work of art!
Fun fact: for the Chicago shots, they didn't need any digital effects. It's just that fucked up.
Who knew all they had to do was wait a few years and they wouldn't have to fake the destruction in Chiraq.
My Pokèmon nerd was immediately triggered after he said intimidate lowers Sp.Def IT LOWERS ATK!!!!!
Michael Bay is the GOAT I don’t care
I don’t think it’s an award winning movie, but it’s fun
DAMN I didnt realized that the Einstein bots body was twitching when they blew his head off. wtf
12:41 you mean First Man? I've seen it too
not gonna lie, when this movie came out, it made me want to become a professional movie critic. and I hailed TF3 as the best movie of all time...
Old man Buzz Aldrin once threw hands with a dude trying to call the moon landing a hoax. He's a total badass and gets all the bad cameos that he wants IMO
My favorite bit of this movie is the bad guy lives in the Milwaukee Art Museum.
I remember watching Dark of the Moon in theaters with my family when I was like 7. Ironhide was my favorite Autobot in the movies because he turned into a black truck and my dad drove a black truck... Like I said, I was 7. Regardless, you can imagine my reaction when Ironhide was suddenly just brutally executed.
To be fair NASA propaganda looks a lot better than army propaganda when NASA is extremely underfunded and relatively forgotten about today.  And, yknow, the whole shooting people thing.
I always just assumed the "blood" in the transformers were just hydraulic fluid
They could've analyzed how Earth pushed Optimus to his limit, but nooooooo. We instead got hollow cash grabs.  Could've been the best Transformers installment ever had Bay given a single F.
Yes because Nostalgia Critic is the perfect way to segway. Like trying to cross the Grand Canyon on a rope bridge... One as thin as a straw.
It was so jarring to see Optimus go from "We'll kill them all", to "Please Sentinal, don't kill me", to "You die now".   I love it.
COOL!! I TOO LOVE NASA AND SPACE
I honesty love how they detached from making cybertronians humanoid
Transformers, is a brand of movie that you shut your brain off and enjoy.
To be fair, red fluid in a semi truck is power steering fluid and coolant. Red fluid in a car is Trans fluid and coolant (sometimes).
I really think they should have just recast Michaela instead of just replacing her.
Optimus just went "War Crimes%"
Hate to be the nerd here but to explain the blood it could be that they are consuming a red version of enerjon from the transformers prime series
Dark of the moon will forever be the film in which spock kills crash bandicoot
i honestly think that transformers dark of the moon is what transformers should've been from the start. I mean, these guys have been fighting a world war on their home planet for literal hundreds of years, of course it should be brutal as all fucking hell
Do people not like this movie?
Not that I agree with violence being repaid with even more violence, but holy shit, the Decepticons killed a shit ton of people, I'd wager even up to millions. At some point, Optimus would just be done with all of them. In this universe they destroyed Cybertron and have now essentially done something similar on a smaller scale on Earth, I don't think Optimus would take his chances with peace at this point.
It dipped after some kid murderer another kid for a charizard card
“Trans Theory”
I'll be honest, there's only one part of this movie I have a serious issue with. And that's how they handled Wheeljack, who I'd forgive anyone for not realizing was in this movie.  They absolutely massacred the poor lad worse than Cliffjumper.
one thing i dont get is why they changed Mikaela to Carly, when they could have just Don Chealed-ed it and recasted an actor for the same character  (or just got Don Cheadle to play the main love interest for Sam, would've been funny as hell)
It felt oddly like watching a 40k via Transformers film.  The second half anyway.
I loved all of them lol even if they weren’t the best especially the Age of Extinction
This is my fav transformers movie the action was amazing people getting ripped in half and Optimus killing megatron shock wave and sentinel
They aren't committing war crimes my guy... They are aliens and our rules don't apply to aliens on our planet.
1:06 a Bionicle?!
I always find the war crimes argument borderline retarded, you’re trying to apply human morality to a alien race that have been at war for millions of years, they probably don’t have a concept or they abandoned them a long time ago with how long they been at war 😂
I can't lie I like the second one, mainly because of the Linkin Park song
I wish they went with the original ending it would end the Michael bay transformers trilogy on high note I would rather that than transformers age of extinction and the last knight
So… Micheal Bay let Megan Fox go for transformers… but recasted her for his TMNT movies?!?!
The 2 cars covered in guns were also on a NASCAR track to promote the movie. So it just looked like NASCAR was about to become an American blood sport.
1:50
15:33 buzz Aldrin lol
Frick you talking about? I fricking LOVE the Michael Bay Transformers Movies! ALL OF THEM I think, they're Transformers-PERFECTION.  On the other hand i DISLIKED the new one.
I like how ultron went onto the internet and decided “they gotta go”, I like to imagine he stumbled upon the lower crevices of 4chan
7:04 so are we just gonna ignore that?
There was a scene in the movie when 3 guys entered a Russian bar and there was this lady with a gun and there was no subtitles at all when she spoke. That's one reason I hated this movie so bad
I always liked how the deceptions are more willing to take prisoners while going for the spark for every kill (instant death) while the autobots kill in the most brutal ways while not taking prisoners.
2:50  to 2:59  where is the scene from?
Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't remember the Decepticons nor autobots signing any form of the Geneva convention or protocols. I'm also unaware of anything similar existing in the history between the two combatting groups. Therefore I propose that putting two in the back of the head of a surrendering Decepticon is not a war crime and should be encouraged as they are less than human.  It isn't a war crime the first time(or hundredth)
the best thing about this movie  is The Sentinel Prime Soundtrack.
9:35 that robot litteraly blasted two people to shreds in a pg 13 movie
Rotf was bad, but devastator was cool at least
I’ll still never forget all those rumors about the autobot rocket ship that Starscream shot down being Omega Supreme lmao. The theories and rumors of these films before the film came out were just the fans going full schizo over every single detail
Plot twist, decepticons are the good guys! Auto bots are fascist separatists
Hearing the spyro soundtrack in the background is the greatest thing ever bro. Ngl, made my day
I never cared that Optimus killed Megatron. Megatron tore Jazz in half, stabbed Optimus in the back, and killed potentially millions of human civilians. He got what was coming to him. Killing Sentinel was a little out of character though.
People talking bad about any of the transformers movies are losers
The main thing I remember about Transformers 3 is that the video game 1. Was actually pretty good 2. Was a prequel for some reason
23:33 Hell yeah!! 🏳️‍⚧️
if you touch the human i'll give you half of my garbage"
I mentioned this to my son watching the new rise of the beasts. Optimus has this weird love of ripping spinal cords out from the skull.
"palatable for adults" or are teenage boys the target demographic? either way. Michael Bay sucks but this video was great!
Honestly we pretty much have literally the exact same opinion on this movie, anytime I watch it I’m super bored in the first part, then the ‘conclusion’ (hilarious cause it’s an hour long fight) happens and I’m so into it and my brain turns off and I love it every time.
I have completely cancelled out what the "human" story in the movie was. Now that I remember it, yeah it sucks. But I really liked the movie back when it came out, for me its just under the first one because cool action
Optimus just straight up killing Megatron was the best choice he could have made, because you could never trust him and his fellow 'bots to not start conflict again. It's in their nature to be violent and warmongering.  This is what every other Optimus fails to realize. But at least in Beast Wars, it's what others realized, since the Autobots won the war and then made the Decipticons, and thus those that came after them, the Predacons, into second class citizens. Because they knew better than to ever trust them with any real ability to start things again.
17:12 is his legs clipping through a textures?
Never knew that about the script. Explains that convo between her and Megatron
I also kind of like this movie. The characters are actual characters and the villain is actually quite enjoyable and evil and is actually a good villain (probably the only good one in the series since megatron was ehhh and the fallen does nothing and then dies)
I like when violence is explored in any transformers continuity, like idw or the bayverse
13:46 I'm an inventor
I did not realize how many people looked back at this movie so fondly. I saw 1-4 in theaters and thought they were all shitty but the first one was alright if you ignore everything that sucks about it. Don't get why everyone seems to somehow think Sam, Mikaela, Optimus, etc. are good characters
They never really gave megatron an apathy or redemption or even a path to peace arc so it seemed pretty in character for optimus prime just to end megatrons bullshit
The sky scrapper part was so coop when i first saw it when i was like 6, and i made a game out of it, pretending that my house was tilting and grabbed onto the walls and doors, it was so fun, always wished i could do something like that in real life.
The twi-lek in return of the jedi was green
Idk unpopular opinion but I liked Revenge of the fallen 🤷‍♂️ yeah there was some trash that didn’t need to be added but I thought the fights were brutal. I thought it also had some dope ass transformers show cased in it
This movies just dogshit in every single way I mean every single way
I feel like I woke up in the wrong dimension because I specifically remembered this movie being called (Transformers The Dark Side Of The Moon) now I feel like I'm going insane 😮😮😢
My personal headcannon is that Mikaela never left and just hired a new actor to portray her.
The other underrated thing about this movie is how accurately it portrays daily life in Chicago,  the constant war, famine and transformers blowing shit up is the true lifestyle of Chicago that not every film gets right
rated R
Ironhide deserved better.
GOD does hate pokemon if He didn't create them, they're an abomination. 1 John 5:22 (KJV) - 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?

He's waiting for you to accept Him and come to Him with open arms in a genuine personal relationship and there's no other love ever like His since He loves you eternally and infinitely so believe in the FATHER YHWH JEHOVAH and the SON whom He sent, The LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST YESHUA HAMASHIACH, and receive The HOLY SPIRIT The Spirit Of JEHOVAH that will dwell in you, change you, lead you, guide you, and be your absolute best friend as GOD the HOLY SPIRIT just alongside The FATHER YHWH and CHRIST JESUS the Son Of GOD, GOD incarnate, which those 3 together make the HOLY TRINITY; GOD THE FATHER YHWH JEHOVAH, GOD THE SON CHRIST JESUS YESHUA HAMASHIACH, AND GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT, the one and only true GOD. I love you but nowhere near as much as GOD. Repent by believing in the LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST and thou shalt be saved, and once you tell JESUS that you believe in Him and genuinely trust in Him by inviting Him into your heart, you are sealed unto the Day of Redemption and you cannot lose your salvation in CHRIST JESUS and He will help you live for Him with His HOLY SPIRIT Amen, the Rapture is the Day of Redemption also which is so extremely very soon and He does not want you or anybody to be left behind nor me nor you do. GOD bless you and KING JESUS CHRIST IS LORD GOD. ✝️👑🦁🕍💒🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️‍🔥💞💯💖  John 3:16 (KJV) - 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

We don’t disregard revenge of the fallen, you are very wrong sir
That actually kind of happened to me with Pokemon. I got off about Gen 2 and didn't really pick it up until the Detective Pikachu movie. I had a few games because I had a 3Ds, but something about the detective Pikachu movie clicked into what made Gen 1 so special for me as a literal ten-year-old in the late 90s.
This is the best film in the whole series. The final act was esp mind-blowing
First man is actually my favorite movie of all time and glorifying the space industrial complex is a good thing since it creates positive things and not war.
Tbh, if the war on Cybertron was horrible in previous shows to make Decepticons merciless, what the fuck happened in Bayverse Cybertron to make OPTIMUS this twisted?
5:00 So the guy named SpielBERG is more salty about someone throwing around the H name than some guy named Bay? Shock and horror.
20:30 Ah yes, Intimidation is a move you can use and it lowers special defense 👌🏿
I'm still pissed they killed Iron Hide, he was my favorite one when i watched this as a kid
I was a kid when I saw this movie with my dad and personally I love this movie even with all its flaws I still love it.
So when I was 4years old I  got to meet buzz aldrin keep in Mind I was big into transformers yes I watched this movie at 4 I mean what do you expect it’s got action. It’s got robots it’s got everything and you wanna know what I said. You really wanna know…… I said.               Dad look it’s the guy from transformers 🤦 now that I’m 16 I feel like such an idiot
I watched this movie in the theaters and I remember being devastated they killed off ironhide like that
Is this the AlternateHistory dude also who made that fallout 4 video
I want you to tell me everything why this movie sucks it is the worst movie ever I don't want anyone to watch it I wanted to burn
23:51
7:00 yo is that Spyro 3?
I loved this movie when I was 10
7:24 Man, they could have just replaced the actor and said, “Oh well she looks different now 🤷‍♂️
Is it really a war crime if they didn't have a choice? What were the deceptacons supposed to do? Transformers weapons are all integrated. The prisoners litterally couldn't be disarmed or imprisoned anywhere
I just wish they killed off sam in this movie
1:24🤔
Dotm was my first ever experience with transformers, and it may have it’s flaws, but god damn did I have fun watchin’ it as a kid
20:40 S A M E!
0:55 hood classic
Ngl I love transformers 2 revenge of the fallen
yes revenge kinda sucked but devastator like cmon thats litearly my favorite
Okay j get people grew up with the originals i did too but i have to say the constant "its not like the originals" when you got beings who been fighting as long as the age of the moon itself its alot more violent and dark that we dont really see the more real look at it all and im glad i didnt get as attached to the originals as others did becauae there are some rewriting that should be done as a story its pretty stale with the originals like war for cybertron, fall of cybertron, transformers prime they are the best depictions out of all the continuties combined
I mean this race was fighting while we were stuck in the primal age so crimes committed on both sides would be an understatement
Horrible movie based on the Apollo 20 mission
9:09 *the transion is sick!*
Auto boys commit war crimes
Megatron sitting on the Lincoln memorial chair is one of the coldest things I’ve ever seen
They want Optimus to be a bitch so bad🤦🏾‍♂️
I still think Shockwave should of survived on this movie for one reason, like 2 minutes of screen time my guy looked so bad ass and did nothing atleast make him die in a good way like dieing in a fight  with a strong opponent, not execute by optimus more of fight him in a duel
i wish the writers would watch this vid and see how dumb they were.
This one is my favorite because Optimus Prime committed multiple war crimes
I only care for the cinema experience of transformers. Robots and cars. But you'd be surprise how dumb people in real life are. More like transformer movie characters than.
I like this movie MORE THAN YOU
6 undercover.
It would be better to recast
Yes the movie is stupid, yes some parts are slow, and yes this is still so much more entertaining to watch then all the movies after it.
I like big robot go pew pew
0:56 Biggest plot twist in history
Sill a fun movie
Dispensor is probably the most compelling characters in the whole saga. Everything about him is so appealing to me.
In defence of how violent optimus is the decepticons are WAAYYYY more violent than in any of the cartoons and the last time he tried to fight without trying to kill in the forest fight he nearly died and then actually died with the last thing he sees and hears is sam terrified and megatron stepping towards him so when he was revived he knew that theres no room to hesitate with them
I like the 3rd movie because it was literally the opposite of G1. Instead of a bunch of idiots being idiots it was just an army of serial killers who want to enslave humanity just because and if i watched G1 before i saw tf dark of the moon i would rather watch the 3rd movie
Idc what anyone says   *I fricking love this movie* *it is so awesome and I love it*
I love dark of the moon
This is my favourite of all the films
I like the devolution of Optimus prime and how in the final movies he’s become tired of being the good guy in the way he fights and fights to kill not to protect as much
I’m now realizing avengers practically stole the alien ship design from the decepticons only difference between the 2 is in transformers it’s the smallest memebers of the team that destroy it where as in avengers it’s the hulk kinda of a direct opposite kids odd I forgot how action packed these movies were
damn the og transformers was ac goofy as fuck god bless michael bay
Ayoooo is that the same music they used to end Dragon Ball Z Abridged with?!?!? TeamFourStar dem?!
I’m jus glad to hear I’m not the only one who can appreciate this movie while knowing it may not be the best. We should let things be fun sometimes and for that I thank you sir!
So, I don't get your criticism on the designs, the G1 designs also looked pretty human. Unicron and scourge and countless other bots all had human features especially facial hair
The last act is so good that is covers up the rest of the films problems.  It's like Michael Bay doesn't have the ability to tell a story without explosions or immaturity. So after he gets through the plot, he then steps into his element
I guess the way of murdering Jazz, Ironhide, Rachet weren't war crimes enough.
16:15 Somehow palpatine return
I told myself that. War in TF3 would be a nightmare in real life. 9:30
Optimus did nothing wrong. (As a lifelong Prime fan im glad he finally took the baddies out!)
I loved all the movies is just the critics i want fans to rate it😢
i watched this movie when i was 7 on a military base overseas with my dad. this is the first movie i ever saw in a theater and i remember it vividly and it is one of my favorite movies
Is it really a war crime to execute a beaten enemy who straight up does that very thing all the time? Including to his own allies?  Can we please do away with the idea that the perfect health and wellbeing of your enemy is worth more than the lives they've taken, and will continue to take, for their own pleasure?
I remember the Neil Armstrong movie with Ryan gosling!!!!
What’s funny about the Carly character, is that she was an actual character from the G1 series. 😂
How could anyone rip on Optimus' changing personality throughout the films??? This is a franchise spanning decades.  Sure, Bayverse is a whole new continuity but it still follows the backgound lore. The violence in this is pretty damn justified, as well as Optimus' pretty drastic personality change. By this point, the Autobots and Decepticons have been fighting each other for MILLIONS of years, to the point where their planet is a barren wasteland and they're ALL living on borrowed time because natural Energon no longer exists, it needs to be created.  Optimus, this dude has been on the losing side the whole duration of the war, watching his friends die and simply knowing Shockwave exists (dude is messed up). And then he's got his nemesis, Megatron.  You've been fighting this dude for millions of years. You've killed each other COUNTLESS times and you both keep coming back for more. Megatron is a gladiator, a warlord and has no attachments to anyone but himself and his love for his home Planet. He loves the fact he can't really get rid of Optimus and Optimus can't get rid of him, even though he completely despises him. Meanwhile Optimus has tried every diplomatic solution and is beyond done with the Decepticons and Megatron's shit, he's fighting for peace and for freedom of ALL life in the universe. He just can't seem to put this dude down for good and peace is something Megatron will never want unless it's all under his control.  His friends now number in the single digits. And finally, Optimus finds a new ally and an old friend with Sentinel, something that has a very very slim chance of happening to him considering all of the above... Only to be betrayed by that friend, his very own Mentor.  So yeah, I imagine you'd be willing to tear a few faces and heads off considering all these facts. War Crime Prime is best prime because, put simply, he's got the most Human reaction of all the Transformers. And ALL of it is completely justified. Even then, it took MILLIONS of years for him to finally snap. That's some godly self-control when you take everything I've said into consideration.   Cut War Crime Prime some slack. Dude was always trying his best and it was never enough over millions of years and even dying countless times. Naturally, all of this will force him to realize, that to protect life, sometimes you have to take it away.   Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
16:14 “Somehow, Palpatine Returned”
15:35 At least it's about as real as his real world accomplishments
15:25 I need to know your roblox account and follow it  You deserve my respect
I mean the Robot fight moments in the second movie are the best of the 3
i absolutely loved dark of the moon its my favourite transformers movie
Dude. Loved this one. Easily my favorite bayformers. Prime was a badass.
{неплохой ролик
I liked it too
Still hate that death scene with Ironhide
My main issue with these movies is trying to figure out wtf is happening in fight scenes.
19:11 💀
It's not even that bad of a movie I actually like it
Do you like music🤨??? The Pill😊
9:50 someone MUST, at least have thought, of making the decepticons Volkswagen or BMWs.
So right now im finishing up the series and id say the 3rd and 1st are the best out of the other 5 movies
0:35 yo that’s  Christopher Moltisanti from sopranos
I think I’ve rewatched this at least 5 times this month alone
I Unironically loved this fucking movie  Seeing Optimus go full brutal mode and kill everything was amazing
Why... why the fuck couldnt we get that original ending..... like... fucking seriously? I HATED the released ending. I WANTED them to sort shit out, yeah, but i like it when bad guys just get tired.
Just fucking saw that you did a video on Dr. Giggles, MY GUY WTF YES GONNA WATCH THAT SHIT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS.  You're a legend. Im so glad i discovered you today.
The closest to R is lord of the rings in my opinion closest to pg-13 in recent years that’s pg is across the spiderverse
the tranformers movis are at there best when the gaint robots start fighting every time humans start talking the movie turns cring and a embersmet
8:06 “The Underminer’s using robots” “That means we don’t have to play nice”   Or something to that effect
I don’t understand should prime let this deceptions live so that they can go and kill people again I think we have established that with Batman
i think if you go to watch a transformers movie, just turn your brain off and enjoy the damn thing
Tbh after I finished watching dark of the moon I felt like it was a long journey and finally it got it's conclusion. I was happy for the cast
Dark of the moon cant be topped
I think it makes sense for Optimus to kill Megatron but they should have Optimus verbalize that he wouldnt give Megatron the chance to betray him like Sentinel did.
I remember that after watching this movie I was amazed how hypocrital were the people on the internet for throwing shit at Superman in Man of Steel for killing Zodd when the latter was about to kill mercilessly an entire family with his laser eyes (aswell as trying to exterminate all of humanity) but turned the blind eye when Optimus here kills his former master in cold blood when he's already beaten and begging for mercy.
Did anyone else noticed that Iran’s flags are upside down at 11:12?
I really like dark of the moon I am serious 🧐
Jesus, the bit where the Decepticons go full "War of the Worlds" on Human bystanders and start vaporizing them by the dozen.
Given everything you've said, with the exception of a couple plot holes, an actress change, Nasa p*rn and some of the same issues previous movies had.....  IT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE!!!  just a bit too depressing. Lets be real here, it was marketed mostly for guys they liked the gore and action. I certainly did.
For those of you who want all of this violence with actually *good* writing. May I recommend the IDW Continuity comics? Where the Decepticons are turbo-terrorists, there are more than a few Autobots portrayed just as bloodthirsty, characters you love die horribly or are mutilated but left alive to suffer, the energon blood is pink so it reminds you just vaguely of real gore, and the amount of genuine war crimes committed makes Dark of the Moon look like a civil debate. You can even meet such charming characters as Tarn, Overlord, Sunder, Guzzle, and more!
Bruh that’s not Patrick Swayze, that’s Patrick Dempsey
I actually like revenge of the fallen
THE ARK!
I don't blame optimus for being a blood crazed violent(extremely) murderer  I mean the guy has been fighting a war for over a thousand years , out numbered , outgunned and not much resources
16:08 That edit made me laugh WAY harder than I should've.
Writers smoked enough pots so this unique thing came to their mind
If there's one thing to say about Michael Bay, it's that he hates CGI when he can do it IRL. Listen to his behind the scenes about his recent movie Ambulance
Dark of the Moon has the best action by far. It's not even close. It's not that the others were bad at action, but they had a habit of just making the transformers fall all over the place. Now instead of looking clumsy the transformers move very athletically. Obviously the drastic increase in gore helps too. Then Optimus swoops in with his wings and the music swells and he just takes out 10 DECEPTICONS off his descent... man. As long as testosterone pumps through my veins that will be cool...
Dude I skip the movie for the last battle
Commandant Soundwave did nothing wrong, don’t believe the (((autobots))) lies.
My memory of this movie was how excited my mom was that it was filmed in Chicago. So she was like “hey you like these robot movies and I love Chicago let’s go see it together!”… she walked out.
5:48 I can only wonder why they didn't just recast Mikaela. Laura Haddock who portayed Vivian in _The Last Knight_ is less than a year younger than her, just so you know. Why didn't they cast her or anyone who bared resemblance to Megan Fox and could emulate her not exactly incredible acting range?
I love this movie even with its flaws and Sentinel is the best villain of the bayverse transformers.
Repent and Believe in Jesus Christ! Gospel/Good news REPENT of your sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! He is the only way to heaven
👍🏻
23:05 If they've only gone for this ending...
20:19 Same.
20:17 Most likely both.
19:59 Man, 2011 was a golden year...
18:29 this guys name is the same name of the guy who gave grisha his Titan
Before the mcu, optimis prime was My iron man. And Bumble bee My captain américa.
Hold on Pause Rewind  You consume blood of each other for ritual purposes??  Care to elaborate on that??!
That Carly girl was treated about as well by the script as Mikayla. The literal first thing we see of her is a tracking shot of her naked legs and thong-clad ass.
19:50  Battlefield music?
2:51 "and this planet comes in to the Galaxy" was the damn thing outside the milky way or something 💀
I love it! it's my favorite! Probably because I like more violent war movies
I kinda want another game or movie with a transformers,  or power rangers war, but with a gritty dark war is hell theme and lots of death.
21:30 Dawn Of/War For The Planet Of The Apes would like to have a word
Revenge of the fallen was the best one
I've always seen Transformers movies as 50/50  Cringy scenes with humans, Autobots being dicks or vilains themselves, dull sex humor  But great action, great designs, and great cinematography  The "shut off your brain" kind of movies because the story is making you screaming internally yet you just want to enjoy the cool shots and the scene fights
20:34 Im sorry special defense? I know that was a joke (i think anyway) but that really threw me off
I was born on 4th of july so my brother took me to see dark of the moon as a birthday gift  when megatron dominated humanity and the screen faded to black I got up because I hoped that was the end of the movie. I was sadly mistaken
Unpopular opinion but I’ve always liked it when movie directors kinda go off the script. Makes for an interesting story. It’s abomination for many but for me it’s an interesting recreation.   Take Spider-Man for example, the web is organic in Sam Raimi’s version with Tobey Maguire.
They did kind of sell the love conflict and chemistry of why Michaela and Sam could stay together in the second one. Which was honestly surprising looking back that it actually sort of worked. But then immediately dumped it with extreme prejudice without skipping a beat of the relationship plot with an entirely different character.
Nah I actual6liked this movie too. It's not perfect or the best transformers but it's a fun watch.
I thought I had clicked the wrong video while watching the intro damnnnnnn😂😂
This trilogy should be named optimus prime’s decent into madeness
I love how Sentinel somehow kills most of the original autos, misses Ratchet, only for him to be melted straight away next movie.
bro revenge of the fallen is the best
this movie show what would happen if the violence in Chicago went up 1%
BADASS MOVIE
1:20 Sam has a Smiths poster in his room, I never noticed that before.
The worm is THE DRILLER
I can’t lie this is the funniest fucking vid because you perfectly describes how it feels to be that target demographic teenager to now older watching this movie
Eh can you really call it a war crime. Like it's our war crime but not there's
Dark of the moon will always be my favorite piece of transformers content, screw the plot I’m brain dead enough to not be bothered by how bad it is
Optimus in Transformers 1: "Our planet was once a powerful empire, peaceful and just" Optimus in Transformers 3: "Geneva Convention? *More like Geneva Suggestion."*
Not gonna lie my absolute favorite part is Mark and his brilliant inventor line after a long pause with the beats pill 😂 I stood up tall, laughed and cheered with a hint of applause for a perfect ending!
It was an amazing movie imo
I don’t remember what happens at all in this movie but the I fondly Remember getting into a car crash on my way home from seeing it.  The car crash wasn’t even that serious, little more then a fender bender but to my young brain it was horrific.
I dont like your opinion
The Transformers series has gone so far that we're at a new Writer's Strike.
I’m still hurt by what they did to Ironhide
big ups the Spyro soundtrack
This was my favorite TF movie lowkey
I too love Tf1 its a classic man cmon
gonna be real, a lot of the concepts in the later movies were epic, but the story just ruined every single one basically. like with the transformium or whatever the fuck (it was a dumb name though lol) that was a cool concept, but the movie and is of it just sucked
Not to defend ROTF, but ever since around 2005, nearly all movies from multiple genres have been crass, depressing, and opposite of the original version. Any time a new sci-fi, action/adventure, or mystery came out, it had all three of these characteristics. It was as though movie studios were pushing these themes on purpose. Either way, I like entertainment that makes me feel good, not depressed or demoralized. That's why I only watch movie reviews and stopped watching movies made after 2005. I only say this because I have yet to see many YTer's acknowledge the clear pattern.
I liked the action and fight scenes of this movie, everything else can die in a fire
20:12 Thanatos XM-05 my beloved!
i remember that Armstrong movie. i don't remember it very well but i remember it none the less.
Ahem 🤓 intimidate lowers a Pokémon’s attack actually
Optimus was a beast at the end of this movie
I do miss Megan Fox in this
Man Ken really did carry the movie
I agree the part were things go boom I LOVE IT and the worm is dreller
6:56 Patrick Dempsey. Not Patrick Swayze.
had to get rid of the "side" to avoid copyright
He says Spielberg got Fox fired because Spielberg forgot he was ever involved with these movies. Because he wasn't. Ever.
The progress of these movies is like Highlander. First is kinda awesome. Second is disowned garbage. Third was..eh. 4th OMFG why and 5 just gave up. Also, I love how in eeeeeevery movie Optimus just gets more and more evil. Like wtf. I doubt the 'learning experience' from the last movie will change anything and he'll go back to thinking humans are garbage again.
Hey Cody, what are your thoughts about the Linkin Park songs between 1-3? Just wondering because Transformers 4 did a finisher song by Imagine Dragons, while Transformers 5 I don't know. I think songs like "What have I done", "New Divine", and "Iridescent" not only were good but also connected with their films narrative, albeit roughly
The third mpvie was the final pne for me. Didnt give a shit for anything after
Dang I recognize the song he uses as the outdo but I can’t remember the name. Does anyone know the name of the song?
In Pokémon the ability intimidation causes physical attack to drop not special defense
The plot of this movie is EXTREMELY similar to episodes 11 & 12 of the original G1 cartoon. Both involve the decepitocons using giant pillars to create a giant space brindge to bring cybertron to earth and enslave humanity and take their resources
20:35 Get it right. Intimidate lowers ATTACK, not Special Defense. Lol just kidding, good joke.
All transformers films are great i will not expand
this movie also has the best foreshadowing of all time, which is neat
I tell you, Ironhide’s death still hurts me
Was it only me who always had the feeling that the plot of this movie and Avengers were oddly similar? Particularly the Part where the Robots blow up? They both hinge on the evil army getting teleported to Earth to siege an American city. There's even the mechanical beasts that tear shit up in the form of Shockwave's snake and the chitauri Leviathans
Tbh I’m fine with the series ending after ROTF or even better, TF 07.
Not gonna lie - idea of more aggressive and violent Optimus is kinda cool
Megan Fox is crazy. She turned all her sons into daughters.
You know, I sometimes wonder why they decide to make it a different girl. I mean, nowadays, we have gotten used to movies replacing their actors for the same character like with the Hulk and War Machine, especially War Machine considering Iron Man 2 was the year before. They could have just had her play the same character.
Liking this movie means you’re a Bad Person, no doubt.
17:16 does anyone else notice megatrons feet clipping through the Lincoln memorial floor?
To be honest, I think this Bay-formers film is the best one in terms of action photography....it was shot for 3D, and the action feels more cohesive and easier to follow. Too bad the human characters still leave something to be desired.
YOOO Don't think that Tekken soundtrack in the background went unnoticed, cause I definitely hear it ❤
Trans Theories is a really poor Choice for a Channel Name
14:17 I hear you, Idol Springs!
9:22 I love the inplication here that no one would care or.find it devastating just because it's Chicago, lol.
Every time I see Ironhide die I cry like a baby
Yeah, the last hour is peak Bay. And yes, Optimuss' noble spirit corrupted by his time on Earth is hilarious. Shooting a wounded adversary in the back as he mewls for mercy...
My favorite part of these transformers movies is when most of the movie revolves around pointless people.  Last thing I'd want to see is transformers in my transformers movie.
Glad I'm not the only one that thought it was brutal
Well Buzz acted once, so it's not shocking he'd be able to do it again iykyk lol
Ngl. The invasion scene on this one kind of reminded me of the Avengers movie back in 2012. Which is weird because this movie came first.
Sure this movie isn’t wonderful, but I really really like it all the same.  I enjoy the grittiness, I enjoy the “comedy” I enjoy the crudeness.  It is one of my favorite pieces of transformer media.
I fell asleep to this movie in theaters because I got overstimulated and my brain shut down  anyway it turns out years later I'm neurodivergent
The way autobot and decepticons just kill random ppl. Throwing full cars at eachother or battling it out on a packed freeway throwing eachother into cars, just isn't what the transformers were ever about.
It would have been better if Megan's character was just recast as that is what they basically done anyway
any bayformer film that comes after DOTM doesnt exist to me, but honestly as much as i loved DOTM i wished that they went with the ending they scrapped and i wish shockwave was the main villian
I liked Dark of the Moon too. I've never watched it again, but the military was competent and it had big stakes, I guess
I think that Optimus basically contracted the cybertronian equivalent to ptsd. The centuries of war, losing close friends and allies, him dying, the betrayal of Sentinel, almost being killed again when he was being forced to leave earth, losing his arm, etc. I think this version of optimus finally had enough and basically went, Fuck it.
Hmmm Deep Wang
23:25 that would’ve been so fucking cool
Boring begining depressing middle (not a bad thing) and the final act was good  Having a good final battle doesn't make the movie good overall
I personally like these movies and think they’re good
This movie is reason why there should be new rating 15+
I also enjoy this one more then the others. Shockwave is the only Bayverse Fig I have, and Optimus with the Jetfire Jetpack/Weapons is the only other I WISH I had but dont because it was/is to crazy expensive to get.
Age of extinction is great and 1 and 3
Deep. Wang.
I get what you're saying about liking DOTM, mostly since I agree. I can enjoy the transformers movies, some more than others and some im more inclined to rewatch than others, but I can enjoy them.  I, really just wanted to talk about the mentiom of DOTM being somewhat depressing, but for me the depressing stuff is something I adore, theres something about a convoy of ragtag soldiers and a guy right out of college lead by a red Chevelle with distruction and sad music that just strikes a cord with me, it sells that this is a really hopeless emdeavor without the aid of the Autobots, which increases the elation felt at their reappearance.
I fucking hate how Megatron gets done dirty
LETS ROLL
The “blood” is supposed to be oil 💀
I personally like these movies and think they’re good
My second favorite of the Transformers movies
I enjoyed this movie when I was 13 and still do tbh bay verse was my real intro and made me go watch the old stuff
Something else that bugs me is that Optimus was used to revive Sentinel, yet he used the Matrix of Leadership, that was going to be used to destroy the sun. that Prime didn't have until sometime between ROTF and DOTM. Megatron's entire plan hinges off of Prime having something that he most likely wasn't aware existed until after Megatron and the Fallen lost the matrix.
The Wreckers where the only reason I went to see this movie! I'm a BIG Dale Jr. Fan, so seeing that #88 was EPIC!
I like Transformers : Dark of the Moon
I remember watching this when I was young and I was absolutely disturbed by the civilians just getting disintegrated
I don’t under stand why people hate in age of extinction
is it weird that the last knight was the shit that lit me up for transformers?
Can someone find where that Jeff Bezos Pokemon clip comes from? I can't find anything online
I liked the Pokémon movie It was a cool twist on it
i liked dark of the moon
I saw this movie like 5 fucking times the 3rd part its just so fucking entertaining The movie is dumb and has a lot of errors/horrors but the 3rd part is just amazing imo
Funny how shockwave is on the cover of this film yet bro has maybe…8 minutes of screentime…9 at a stretch, I mean laserbeak has more 😭
You have to admit that lockdown from age of extinction was badass
Dutch is my favorite character in DOTM ...
I feel like “Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story” also really pushed that PG-13 rating to the EDGE
. 0:01 .
Its bad to like this movie? This movie is fucking amazing lmfao
Every one of your complaints is so flawed. “The wreckers were annoying characters” they talked like twice. I love all 3 of the first 3 movies it’s just awesome fucking action. I just look at each of them kind of like individual stories. You point out problems that aren’t actually real problems like the deceptions looking nothing like in the animated KIDS show. No shit they won’t look the same. People who complain about these movies are watching them for the wrong reasons.
what the dog going in the beggining
I like dark of the moon but I hate age of extinction
Watching my favorite transformer disintegrate was pretty traumatic as a 10 year old. Not going to lie.
Transformers 3 is the movie that made me realize you could end up absolutely bored with explosions and the destruction of a city if it goes far too long
“This is the most violent PG-13 film”    Go watch Beowulf, Poltergeist, and Watership down and tell me how you think now.
Autobots weren't really rebels. They were more the establishment
Can anyone tell me what's the title of the other pokemon movie in the intro? 😭
I basically watch Marvel movies if I want to turn my brain of for a couple hours. But I watch Transformers movies if I want to go beyond turning off my brain
I thought the actor that played Carly's boss was named Patrick Dempsey.  Not to be that guy. This is the first video I've watched this guy, and I liked it & will be subbing.   The info. The humor. Andvhe covers of my favorite movies.   As a new fan, I just him to upload the best video possible to grow his channel to its max potential.
2:31 I literally went "Good news, everyone!" out loud. 😂
The first 3 transformers movies are the best. I STILL prefer Transformers 2 to the third movie but eh
the "conspiracy investication part"(s) and simon simmons is the best part
“Trans theories” hell of a username for transformer centred YouTube channel
I think you described why little kid me didn't like the movie. It was way too dark for me (I was 10) and some of the stuff in the movie scarred me lol. The executions, the giant incinerator, Iron Hide just dying and no one really caring :(
I liked this movie a lot and I don’t know why people hate it this movie is good and I don’t know why people have to make a big deal about it
One of the better transformers movies
Great film. Only idiots dont like this
Personally I love all the movies lol I hate none of them
Nah I just watched this film two days ago and it didn’t come even close to pushing the pg-13 rating to its limits. Revenge of the fallen was closer. Films like tdk, taken, beouwolf. Hell even Star Wars 3 was closer
with the plan with sentinal and megatron if it was "so well planned" why'd megatron kill optimus in the second movie?
How can you not like 2 if you like 3 though?
After year 2000 life became boring.
if bay had just cut out the goofy scenes and put a little bit more effort in building a good storry line and good dialogs.. this trilogy had the potential to be an absolute science fiction masterpeace .. but i still like these films for epic shots and the action 🤷‍♂
Megatron had killed optimus and jazz and tried to enslave humanity. It wouldn't make sense for optimus to make peace. Sentinel just killed ironhide and tried to enslave humanity. Neither of them deserved to live. Optimus did the right thing in both cases.
The fucking execution on Megatron is the reason I remember this film. That God damn thud as his head-imbeded are hits the ground.
Am I the only person who absolutely loves all of the transformers movies
Who cares about war crimes? Its retarded at best
I love this dry trashing of this p.o.s.
I love how at 15:34 the music from level 2 of toy story 2 videogame start playing in the background
"trans theories" bro that dont sound like i think it sounds
Revenge of the Fallen was good, and Dark of the Moon is great
Then Alita came out.
Don't forget only 1400 people died in the Invasion
The relationship between Sam and Mikaela was the best thing from revenge of the fallen so that's why I don't like dark side of the moon
12:03 "Other than dancing on the Soviets" At the end of the day, that was really all it boiled down to back then. Lol.
This movie is fantastic just skip the first 45 minutes and youre good lol
The bay verse was so good yall trippin
17:06 is the most sad moment in transformer’s history. RIP Ironhide
It is sad and werry bad that Chornobyl is still associated with russians...
17:04 😂
The funny thing is that when Pokémon was just coming out and it was just a manga, it was brutal. Like I remember seeing one of the Pokémon getting its head cut off.
I don't know what cartoon you watched, but the autobots took back Cybertron and the decepticons had to lay low on some sludge world, so...
I never really noticed dark of the moon had alot of gore since I was a big fan of transformers when I was about 6 years old
I'm pretty sure the worm thing is native cybertronian megafauna.
Simmons is really one of the parts of these movies.
Imagine in an alternate universe Cody talking about the ending we got and how absolutely brutal Optimus executing sentinel prime would be.
What else could you like about it? How they killed Chang from community?  Ngl I enjoyed his scenes the most in TF3.
originally shockwave was supposed to be the main villain, but then they scrapped him for sentinel
19:50 the fuckin battlefield theme i'm so dead lmaooooooo
Did I miss it, or did you not mention how Optimus kills The Fallen by literally ripping his face off??
Bro it’s a movie with robots fighting why do people keep applying real crimes to these things.
The First Man is a masterpiece.
Well, things are different in the transformers' world, so our war laws don't affect them or may be completely different. And yes, I understand that Optimus Prime is supposed to be the leader of the autobots and that he is supposed to be "Wise." But when your past leader creates a plan with your arch enemy to conquer a planet and enslave over 7 billion people, then you know somethings really wrong now. Right? I just believe that what optimus did was justified.
Dark of the moon was the best of the 3 what are you even scared about ?
The first 3 transformers movies were amazing and there isn't a thing in the world that can change my mind.
No matter what, the original animated movie  "The Trans_ormers" done in mid-1980's was phenomenal.
We saw them filming this movie in Chicago when I was young, cool experience!
The classics always had their own charm.
Thank you for this, Cosmonaut's videos keep getting f'd up by paramount 😂 (You cant convince me this isnt kind of a response video)
I love how pointless hub doesn’t even realize that there’s different types of energon. Like yeah I get it he isn’t a hardcore fan who dives headfirst into the lore a couple days outta the week but come on it doesn’t take that much effort to google it.
Yknow what needs to come back? recasting! if you have a storyline for Mckayla, just get a new actor! people used to do this all the time!
Playing the Tekken 2 soundtrack in the background are we?
I like how Optimus progressively gets more violent, showing that the more time he spends with humans the more he grows to hate them as we are a terrible species.
17:17 Megatrons feet clipping through the ground lmao. Looks like Skyrim.
AoE was great, and the box office shows that. Bumblebee was trash. I wish we could all forget the Knights one
I always wondered why the Decepticons didnt just teleport Cybertron around jupiter.
What was the song at 24:00?
The Bayformers are probably my biggest guilty pleasure. They’re very bad and very dumb movies, but I honestly just can’t help but have a good time watching them.
I love the detail that the fasc-Decepticon is a Mercedes, a car brand with a very spicy history
I didn't see anyone talk about this yet but I thought it might be an interesting addition:   I don't exactly remember if it was the novelization of this movie or similar media, but the CANONICAL reason Sentinel Prime executed ironhide is because Ironhide was part of some specific subculture of cybertronian and Sentinel Prime was just racist lmao
Where was that live action Pokémon scenes on your example of a “brutal reintroduction to Pokémon movie” from
Tell me I'm not the only one who doesn't remember this, and I watched this a million times as a kid. 1:23
I'm sorry, but this is one of the best incarnation of Optimus. He's in war. He's a warrior and soldier in war. This Optimus makes perfect sense. I would of hated Optimus if he was like the "real Optimus"
Yo I’m probably the only one that’s personally loves all of the movies for different ways Just my opinion Anyway have a good day  Quick edit: I actually grew up on age of extinction because I was a little kid who loved dinosaurs I don’t know pretty unpopular onpionion I guess please no hate
Nobody´s ever landed on the moon, its all freemason lies and deceit
Spacetravel doesnt exist. Space doesnt exist, Earth = Firmament, flat. Space is hoax.
people have genuinely tried to say to me that “optimus has become hardened by war, he’s become brutal as a way to adapt to the horrors” when like… every other optimus went through the exact same things as this one and DIDN’T start executing prisoners. the whole point of his character is that he stays good *despite* everything that’s happened, that’s what being a paragon is all about.
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly I love how Optimus is portrayed in this movies, he’s not your typical hero, he’s been through a lot of shit and he’s just done with all the decepticons bullshit
“What if Pokémon didn’t faint, they just died?”   Boy, have I got the manga for you
@9:25 Holy crap, Transformers have bolt guns!
My fav of the bay ones, which I pretty much don’t like as whole, but this one is like exception, stakes felt the realest in this one, and I like how the transformers kill each other more reminds me of 86’ movie, the real BEST TF movie lol….oh and FYI it’s Patrick Dempsey, not Swazy, Patrick swazy is actually dead RIP
A question abou the moonlanding, when it had just one purpose to steal parts from the ship or smth why did they sent more to different places
Heh. Didn't realize that was Buzz Aldrin.
DOTM is my favorite of the trilogy
I always wondered why that british girl felt out of place.
"he wanted to be like hitler" so is this the part where they pushed the PG-13 limits
“What of Han just hooked up with that blue chick” Shows oola, who’s green
The problem is that the other ending was spoiled due to a glitch in the Amazon's systems that caused to show the ending of a particular ending that was based off.
ok, i just saw your transformers 4 vid, now im watching this one, and your transformers 2 vid is in my recommendation. i guess im watching this trilogy backwards  edit: and your first of this trilogy. should i watch the second or first first, the answer is your “What if Trotsky Came To Power Instead Of Stalin?” vid
This is the one channel that appreciates the bay films (the good ones), so I find myself watching this every so often.
Trans-formers aren't formers
Watching this video at 420k subs 😏
The Clone Wars laughing in PG with warcrimes every season
all i know about these movies is that some guy is directly below the enemy’s scrotum  so i think that speaks for itself
what da dawg doin
That's Shockwave's anus, FYI. I mean the transformer wiki is one click away but NOOOOO
this is unapologetically my favorite transformers movie. something i’ve always loved is the way the decepticons feel like a genuine military threat. they’re alien, they’re huge, and if it weren’t for plot armor in the second and third film they undoubtedly would’ve gotten their way (they got their asses beat in the first one i cant argue with that) i loved dark of the moon, it would’ve been such a good point to end on.
I remember watching this movie when i was a kid, and when i saw Sentinel kill Ironhide, i legitimately could not tell if he was a decepticon or not because they all look exactly the same
I remember seeing this in theaters and it completely freaking me out that the machine vaporizes people after 2 movies of being not that dark
if you think warcrimes are pushing pg13, try watching the clone wars, its rated 6+ and over the course of the show over 700 warcrimes are committed
17:08 So did Ironhide shit a bomb after he got shot, wtf was that random explosion under him?
No wonder that the Autobots used a Space shuttle. They didn't want risk another crashlanding
Here's the thing about Shockwave, with all the shit he does in the lore, he easily could have been the main villain. Hell at one point he basically plans to kill the entire universe like Thanos did. They even had what were basically Infinity Stones for it too. Except for the fact that **Shockwave fucking invented them** Why the hell didn't they just do that movie?!?
Spielberg is Jewish so I’d assume it was because of that it struck such a cord with him and had her canned
Is dark of the moon good? Eh no  Is dark of the moon a fun movie? It’s super fun! It’s wild
If only Pokemon and MLP were fads.......
My favorite part of the whole movie is where Alan Tudyk has to 'hack a BRIDGE' for the fucking Navy seals because the can't get across a river. A river.
I liked this movie, especially since I was also a young teen when this dropped. Definitely felt like it inspired the Thanos invasion scenes from Marvel for sure, but yeah the romance was cringe I just ignored it in favor of staring at the girl (teenager remember).
The worst things about this movie is Megatron asking for a truce and then Optimus killing him after Meg saved him from Sentinel. What is potentially worse, they just killed off all of the other Decepticons (With the exception of Barricade). Even if Prime didn’t accept the truce, they could’ve at least kept Shockwave, Soundwave, weird dorito-shaped Starscream, and a few extras, as well as some more important ones that I have forgotten about.
Optimus being more violent in these films is the same reason why Batman kills in BvS  Both were under the direction of dudes who enjoy gratuitous CGI destruction and shoving in as many pro-military images & American flags as possible with zero concern for character
I love Dark of the Moon
This was the case maybe they would actually start making good f****** games
This video has one of my favourite jokes ever. "Maybe Shockwave is like a pokémon. Instead of killing he uses intimidation to lower everyone's special defense." This is funny because there is an ability in pokémon called "intimidate", but it lowers the physical attack of opposing pokemon. However, special defense is the stat that is attributed to mental fortitude, which would be more realistic for intimidate to drop. Just found this funny.
14:00 he sounds like those zombies in original plant vs zombie that fall of the sky haha
The movies were so bad😭 they treated the transformers like animals or mindless robots that fight and do nothing else all day. As if they cant get hurt or need rest or sum. The most characters are very out of character and the cons… oh the cons… they are all grey and look and act like animals as if they are mindless monsters☠️💪🏻  transformers isnt supposed to be emotionless and only action and fight and boom everywhere. The bumblebee movie is a good example of a GOOD transformers movie  i rly saw someone that said g1 is mid and the bayverse movies are god tier and got the characters right im crying rn
Wait wtf. The Neil Armstrong movie, First Man, is awesome dude. I totally forget about that movie
I imagine you know that wasnt Patrick Swayze but rathet Patrick Dempsey and you were just calling him Patrick Swayze as a joke?
2:15 I for one welcome our new robot overlords
I liked age of extinction
I realized watching this video that this movie is a mashup of the other side of the 1980s, namely vietnam shows like Rambo and things like Watchmen. The Autobots are out here like Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian shooting up Iran and it's wild this made it to screen.
I think I still have that old shockwave transformer toy
17:04 that did Iron Hide dirty!
Aw man that alternate ending would have been way fucking better.
I watched all three of these movies back in the day and only now i realize that optimus prime and megatron are separate entities
NASCAR autobots that’s why the finale is good
I hate how movies always try to railroad in the space shuttle, be original at least
I Honestly hate the designs because they're incredibly hard to read and are generally pretty formless which makes it difficult to separate the robot gore from the one who's doing the goring. The colour palettes really don't help with this either..
If pokemon had fallen off back in the 90's i would of been quite happy cause it plagues me a little bit from time to time worst part is i dont even mess with pokemon like that no more my childhood yes but i stopped being a child since well.... a hot minute now
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR SCOURCES
That what if ending makes me wish for a trilogy of movies where the big bad guy and the good guy actually resolve their differences with diplomacy and a truce. So much killing that even the overarching antagonist is tired of war.
I like your usage of Spyro music
They should've just recast the character when Megan Fox left.
why yall always be hating these movies like they bad or some shit
I just found this movie really entertaining to watch, I know this movies are really dumb, but let's be honest, they aren't cheap at all, the CGI of the Tranformers are really good, the scenarios looks good, the music is great and to be honest this entry deserves a little Clap Clap just because they do an entire movie finally and not a 2 Parts Film Finally.  Am actually with Optimus and Megatron being in agreement, better than Optimus just killing Megatron, because at the end something this movies don't do is show the fact that the Decepticons aren't bad guys, they just are the Militia of Cybertron, and the objective is protect Cybertron.
2:49 where is that clip from, I need to watch it 😂
This movie is good I don’t know why ppl hate this movie
I was born when it came out
Oh my god I remember that bus commercial as a kid dude turned them into games, I think, or cards.
Shia was amazing my favorite scene is when the boss comes outside to talk to him about his car lmao so good
I love murderous opitmus
People really blow Optimus killing Sentinel out of proportion.
Me every single Transformers movie: "yay, war crime Prime is back" 😅
5:10 nooo Cody would never say that 😢
I appreciate the Spyro music in the background.
23:24  the novelization of Alien3 is well worth a read, strongly encourage xeno fans to source a copy.   As a kid, film novelizations were a handy way to almost be watching a great movie even when I wasn't - such a diligent reader 🤣
Aldrin has been known to reply to conspiracy theories with a fist.........unless it's the one with the giant toy robots, 'cause with that one you're on the right trail 😉  😐
I like transformers dark of the moon the most of the transformers movies
it's depressing that the movie takes place in Chicago, the city where you wouldn't know the carnage was done by giant robots because they value arming criminals over legal inhabitants. i was going to go into a rant about how if i went to see a movie about giant robots i want to see giant robots, not humans having human problems. Even if it would had just been therapeutic for myself but i'm glad i didn't see the 2 or 3 of the movies.
Favorite line: "Time to find out."
I distinctly remember watching this movie as a kid, well more specifically how fucking cool I thought how Optimus just brutally killed Megs and Sentinel with one arm
I guess I have to say that unpopular opinion:tf 4 and 5 was really good.
Can’t wait for him to do the newest one
The most violent PG movie I know is jaws (im not joking)
There’s actually a reason I forgot every detail but different parts of the robots have different energone colours and main injuries you should there were to the head Wich has red energone
bro it's not blood it's red engine liquid
The U.S military canonnicaly used transformers to commit War crimes and still put the blame on them. Fuck. That is an unironically rich proposal to expand upon, anyone with half a neuron could make something good out of that.  Too bad its a Michael bay movie.
America wouldn't have rushed to the moon if there wasn't an alien spaceship there.
20:12 Crazily, that worm thing is supposed to be Devastator. I would nitpick the hell out of how different it is, but it's like you said, he's still awesome.
Another PG-13 movie that gets away with brutal violence thanks to the "If it's robots it doesn't count!" rule was Alita: Battle Angel. You had arms in eye sockets, spines ripped out, faces sliced off, and a little dog obliterated just off screen. That movie was wild bro.
Is this guy alternativehistoryhub
Not dotf being my favorite 😢
Yeah, it is not a hill I would defend until the last bullet, but my inner 8-year-old self also thought that Optimus would never execute any living being like that. Like never-ever. Heck, he even blew himself up one time in the comics, because he felt guilty for hurting some NPCs ... in a video game. Which is both a testament to his ultimate humanism, the cheesiness of the comics, and my ability to remember the most useless facts.
This is my favourite Transformers movie I can't lie, I have watched it so many times compared to the other ones.
"trans theories" sure is a funny channel name
Transformers have always been brutal have you seen the 86 film
The fuck was the pokemon movie with Meowth and an AR15
Lol I like all of them
Even The Twilight franchise is better than the transformers movies.
SPHERICAL
This movies is funny, entertaining, and down right amazing. You are hatin , bro
Actually i agree with this.. Transformers 1 was so awesome!.. But ROTF Transformers 2.. had some of the best fights/action with Megatron vs Optimus.. was hands down the Best!!
when he says all shockwave does is stand around, and he looks mad, that killed me😂
Shockwave design was so cool even though he was a mid villain in dark of the moon
6:57 "here comes Patrick Swayze"  Is that not patrick Dempsey
I'm still mad they killed Ironhide
Correction; the Balrog would be called Whipfire
"Dark of the Moon"  Bobby B: What a Stupid name.
am i the only one who enjoyed revenge of the fallen? yeah its probably a massive part down to nostalgia but as a kid i used to absolutely adore this film and all of the action scenes and cool ass vehicles but meh i enjoyed it.
Shockwave Gang rise up🔥😎we out here
I somewhat enjoyed revenge of the fallen. Most of the jokes were pretty bad, but it had good action and they still had megan fox as the girlfriend
props for having a goofy lil fella as ur avatar rather than some idealized anime vtuber avatar garbage
Why do people act like space travel is still amazing? We did it in the 60's as a flex. The moon is ashy. Who did that help? Cheese speculators?
I genuinely love this movie even still to this day. I was just about to start my senior year in high school, and it's the first movie that I saw more than once in theaters. I think it's the first midnight release I of a movie I went to as well. I remembered after I saw it, I was "Damn, what did Chicago do to Michael Bay!" It was nice to see a city other than, Washington, NY, or LA be destroyed cause I was a midwest boy as well and even worked with people who went on vacation and saw them filming on set of North Michigan Ave.
Idk, I kinda liked revenge of the fallen, that’s just my opinion
I never cared about the humans if you were an actual transformers fan then you would actually like the only parts with the action and transformers
9:18 what movie is this?
15:01 Show me that guy and not tell me that that's shockwave and I would of gave something like "Overkill" or "Riot"  Went from a feared mad scientist to a lack of depth perceptive, full fledged fear of parachute Decepticon.
I freaking loved the Trilogy, Some hate it, Some loved it, I would give my arm to see a Transformers 4 that is not the Transformers 4 that we had but a Good one with an actual thing. I did like the Dinos but I would have loved them more if they turned back to humanoid form rather than staying a dino all the time.  Then now, Rise of the Beasts, with a different kind of animation for some reason
Male dog is getting that dog dog treatment
21:39 Optimus Crime
Dotm is my favorite because it was the first Transformer movie I saw in theaters.
So... how is the war on Cybertron even relevant if the Autobots and decepticons have been living on earth the entire time as established in the second film? Or did the war happen long ago and then after the war they all just decided to settle on earth and somehow not come in contact with each other while also not being aware of a crashed space craft on the moon while megatron was frozen and the all spark... and... my brain hurts.
the way i started watching these movies when i was 4 and now i’m 17 and still obsessed with them even if they’re complete garbage, extremely violent, and borderline psychotic. transformers 1-3 give me such nostalgia that no child should ever experience but it’s really funny to me because these movies were so dumb. i was literally shaped by these movies, my desensitization came from the extreme violence and robot gore. i grew up adoring bumblebee and always wanted that yellow camaro. these movies could’ve had a great storyline and plot but the fact that the writers sucked ass and that micheal bay directed them… i did actually become a linkin park fan from these movies too which is unfortunate in a way. i look back on these whenever i see another sequel and wonder “what the fuck is going on?”
As a kid who watched movies 1 through 3 back to back because we had the disks, the fact that the love interest was a completely different person was what bothered me the most about the movie.
Absolutely all the Transformers movies were PG-13 limit-pushers, dum fuk. I always thought this was light for a Transformers movie. Most dark stuff in here were all the destruction and death scenes when the decipticons invaded. Compared to other PG-13 movies, specifically end of the world ones, this is nothing. Heck, even the G1 Transformers cartoon had some pretty dark and violent deaths not that far from this movie. Either way, this movie as absolutey fucking awesome
In Canada, the movie was called « Dark Side of the Moon ». Hell of a better title, if you ask me.
Here, in Moldova Pokemon did become a fad. We didn't really know Pokemon, because very few children had Gameboys. Sure, there was an odd toy being sold, but without knowing what it was, you really didn't care. I remember coming across the anime on tv by accident and falling in love with it, then it became huge pretty much overnight. Then, after like a year, nobody talked about it anymore. Most of the stuff associated with it was gone from stores. It was so surreal.
Nothing wrong with liking this movie it’s pretty good
I thought revenge of the fallen was pretty good
When ever I watch this movie I just straight up skip to the part where transformers blow shit up
I couldn't watch the movies bc I had no idea which bots were fighting. 😂
Watch the Rifftrax, it makes rewatching movies like this bearable.
18:33 i knew eren had something to do with this, that shaddy bastard ....
That the toy story ps1 music i hear?
I distinctly remember watching this movie for the first time and getting so sad when the Autobots "died" and saw the Decepticons winning; that same me also got so egregiously hyped when they came back a short time later; and yet again my young child brain was genuinely about to cry when Bumblebee was put on the execution block  This movie was probably the peak of my childhood Transformers obsession and it left me dumb with glee by the end of it  It wasn't till #4 when I became aware of how bad these movies actually were; now I look back at the first 3 with nostalgia and all the ones since as fun dumb movies with the transforming robot cars I idolized as a kid
Edits are beyond legendary. God tier vid 10/10
Isn't that just real life in Chicago minus the robots?
I assumed they used the space bridge just to get them there quiker. They probably could've flown to earth.
Had they just made this shattered glass it could work and actually be really cool.
i  thought the guy at 0:34 was Michael Imperioli
The movie fits nicely in my guilty pleasures category, and is the only one I re-watch.
Did you call Patrick Dempsey Patrick Swayze on purpose? I used to do that on accident when I was younger haha
Why couldn’t they just say Mikaela got a makeover aka become a blonde…
I drive past the building that Carly works at like every day for work. It’s actually the Milwaukee art museum. One of my friends actually went to a casting call for extras for that scene. Sadly she didn’t get the part haha.
Bro Dark of the Moon is peak cinema, and you CANNOT change my mind
The novelization of the movie was better.
12:15 I am so proud to say that I owned this exact toy
If people think this movie was depressing, the next film blows this one out of the fucking water, and no, not in a good way.
I keep forgetting how violent this movie was ngl
I remember when I saw 3 at the movies, Sentinel got dark
The intro made me think that I had clicked on the wrong video
I'm a little late to the party, but fun fact: Energon can be any color! In Generation 1, it was pink, and in Prime, it was blue, green, and red! The best way to tell what color it is in the series is to look at Arcee, as it is canon for her to be the color of Energon so her enemies don't know when she's bleeding. If I recall correctly, in Revenge of the Fallen (when she was active), she was red!
I enjoyed this movie.
Actually, the Pokemon Adventures manga (the early parts of it) are comparatively dark compared to the others. We see Pokemon get cut in half there. The comparisons to cock fighting would a lot harder to avoid if the games had Pokemon getting absolutely destroyed like that.
Dark of the moon was best
This movie is alright, except the end. Optimus Prime, would have 100% took Megatrons offer of peace. The whole point of all this was to end the civil war that was killing their planet. Having him just go "Meh, I'd rather Fuck you up!! Let the war continue!!!" Was absolute character assassination, period. Still, I've seen worse movies. Given, those terrible movies are still Transformers movies, there just not THIS movie.😂😂
I think what bothered me the most about this movie was that everything hinged on Optimus having the Matrix of Leadership. But...  Megatron and Sentinel hitched the alliance way back on Cybertron, the spaceship got shot, then crashed and Sentinel was gone. Optimus had no contact with Sentinel since then (at least from what we know in the movie). Then the other two movies happen.  How could they have known that Optimus was the key to everything due to the Matrix which no one knew was a thing until the second movie? And even then it wasn't even clear that it would stay a thing, given how Fallen could've succeeded if not for Jetfire.  It boggles my mind.
That "worm thing" is called The Driller, and yes, he is Shockwave's pet... wonder if he ever gave it burritos as a treat
Actually right about know in 2023! Chicago is turning into very dangerous city of young teenagers destroying public property and famous large department stores are closing forever! Because of robbing an stealing priceless expensive items are happening there every single day! An add homelessness to very bad issue in the American erosion. Just like all the democrats cities nation wide! Stretching from east the western California to Hawaii to. Everyone in Chicago are going to Minneapolis minnesota to pick their well fare checks an food stamps to help their families out in this sleepy Joe bidden's very bad inflation time period! Have a great fabulous wonderful day.
0:56  Actually ALl of that stuff, and more happened in the original manga.
I love the first three movies of this Frenchies but I absolutely hate aoe and tln
I was stationed in Great Lakes for Navy A school and you can see Chicago across the lake on a clear day. I remember drinking at the on-base bar and the battle of Chicago part was playing on TV. I just remember thinking “Damn. Liberty dropping late again…”
7:41 Love the Mario Kart music.
UUHHHHHHMMMMMM AKTCHUALLY  5 MONTHS LATER INTIMIDATE LOWERS PHYSICAL ATTTACK GODDDDDDDDDDD
7:06 killed me 💀
Patrick Dempsey dude
Excellent point about the designs of the villains it’s starting to become a common trope in Hollywood most villians lack variety and are often kinda repetitive im surprised more people aren’t noticing this cause it’s starting to become way to common
ayo bad buisness reference 15:23
the only reason i watch dark of the moon is the car chase just because of sideswipe and mirage
Intimidate lowering special defense is crazy
16:21 Somehow...Somehow...Somehow...Somehow...Somehow...Somehow...Somehow...  Somehow Palpatine returned
The NO OPTIMUS bit is reused so much its starting to get funny for no reason
16:42  Every early 2000's youtuber who fell off trying to squeeze off as much from nostalgias as possible in the 2010s
Theres so many vids praising this film and i love it. I always knew the transformer series was garbage but this was a guilty pleasure of mine and i absolutely love this movie
Honestly the best part of this film for me was Sentinal using Spock's "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" line but as a villainous excuse instead of a heroic self-sacrifice.
None of this makes sense due to the first movie. IT would be fine if they planned this right from the start and not planned it as they went along when making the movies.
That's Patrick Dempsey idiot... Swayze is dead
Patric who?
17:19 My theory as to why they saved this plan as his last was that each movie megatron was trying to make solutions to save cybertron.   Movie 1: Megatron crash lands on Earth, and he is used to make all of humanity's technology eventually allowing him the possibility to make a new army to enslave humanity so that...  Movie 2: he revives the fallen so he can help harvest earths sun to possibly use it to make energon to then fuel cybertron.   Movie 3: Steal the pillars, make the deal with sentinel to help rebuild cybertron, and bring cybertron to earth to help rebuild it using earths resources.  It's just that after each defeat, he moves on to the next step of the plan, knowing that the plan must continue to save cybertron.
This was the first transformers movie I was allowed to see in theaters and it broke my 13 year old brain. I too have nostalgia goggles for this movie
"Somehow the Soviets got the MacGufffin" Must of inspired "Somehow Palpitine Returned"
uses *intimidation* 😂😂
Random spyro the dragon music in the background.
Not to mention that to revive sentinel they needed Optimus to have the matrix that was still in the sun harvester when he destroyed it.
20:27 god damn that shockwave boss fight was epic
12:13 i still have that toy deep in storage
The 1986 movie has an explicit act of genocide where the autobots fail to save final survivor of a planet from execution. It also starts with Optimus dying and telling a child “do not grieve” before you see the light fade from his eyes in hospital. If it were live action would be equally violent.
Optimus commits like 4 war crimes in this film
That little rover on the moon is actually an autobot
The Geneva convention doesn't control the actions of transformers
I've never heard the story about Megan fox leaving transformers that way. Especially when you realise she ended that comment about him being hitler on said with a compliment about how she thought he was really nice when not on set.  Here is the full qoute: "He's like Napoleon and he wants to create this insane, infamous mad-man reputation. He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is. So he's a nightmare to work for but when you get him away from set, and he's not in director mode, i kind of really enjoy his personality..."
16:06  "Somehow Sentinel Prime returned"
That intro got me, I thought I hit a different video for a second
Optimus warCrime
Plz don't ever compare Patrick Dempsey with Patrick Swayze.
Smart people recognized that these movies were shit with the first film. True geniuses stopped watching after the second film.  Haven't for a single second feel like I've missed anything at all by not watching these shit films. Same with those brain dead Fast and Furious "movies"
The reason optimus got more aggressive in throughout the movies is because how many autobots have died like jazz ironhide and jetfire so he wants revenge
I appreciated the Charlie Berens cameo
I imagine getting buzz to do this stupid movie was in part the cause of the Apollo 11 mission circle jerk
0:00-0:57 Alt H. Hubert talks about Pokeyman for a minute
didn't notice this through many rewatches but Megatrons wheel is clipping in the stairs at 17:13
one thing that bugged me throughout the films was the fact that there is always love interest, Transformers 1 - ok Transformers 2 - mildly ok Transformers 3 - not ok, the actress already left, shouldve removed the character than replace it, Transformers 4-  VERY NOT OK, "daughter?" *slaps love interest into the plot don't even get me started into 'the last knight' the girl was inserted in nearly halfway into the movie and they just became a 'thing' I mean generally, im not salty about clichés in films, BUT the fact they make an effort to ram those side stories into a TRANSFORMERS movie without any creativity is infuriating
15:48 ayo that's my boy Deep Cover
doesn't even follow the lore or anything doesn't even know why they went to chenorboly doesn't know the name of the deceticon shockwave made nice video dude
I’m ngl, when it comes to movies, My matured brain temporarily goes away and I just enjoy pretty much whatever’s going on
Impordant.
"Remember when the transformers bombed Iran?" Is a fantastic conversation starter lol
I don't know if you realized but Megatron was the only one that dropped blue blood when Optimus killed him. Well, he had both blue and red i don't know how. Not even sentinel or Optimus who are both primes had that.
So after Sam lost Megan Fox, he hooked up with a Victoria's Secret model? Talk about punching above your weight kid.
In my opinion this is the second worst one out of all of them, only beaten by the last knight.
so we'll just act like transformers 1 introduces male 'funtime' to 13 year olds lol
War crimes is the best part of a war, common.
Even forgot the mention the war crime where they just rip a unarmed unable to fight deception pilot apart
Sam dies off screen
Wait, the Autobots were the Rebels? I thought the Decepticons were Rebels. Like Decepticons, Rebels in deceptive warfare IE Guerillas
My favorite transformers movie i remember going see it in 3d with my friends it was amazing .....the end flaws duh but at the time was good
The best character in this series is John Turturro's role as Simmons. I will not elaborate. It's just funny and enjoyable
I tried years ago to figure these movies out and I would see online nerds twist themselves in knots offering BS explanations.  Then I realized the obvious--there is no explanation.  There is no respect for the audience...and really there shouldn't be---as people kept coming back for more incoherent lunacy.  It doesn't surprise me given how people today are hopelessly uneducated, ADHD, flaky, shallow, etc....but I don't believe that it is the fault of Orci/Kurtzman.  It is well documented that they left the franchise after being locked in a hotel room and forced to write a script in a few days due to the 2007 writers' strike.  They turned in basically a framework with some good ideas, and then Bay filled in the blanks, and he was so proud the he turned in the movie in record time! I liked Bumblebee, and I hope that it is indeed a reboot (as they don't even know themselves).  And by reboot I mean that there is no association with the bay movies--not reboot meaning what Bay does after every one of his Transformers movies.
The Carly thing actually worked for me, because it seemed like Sam and Mikayla were headed for a breakup in Revenge of the Fallen.
I watched this movie with friends and there's this part where the Decepticons say they're going to enslave humanity. I started loudly calling that idiotic since giant robots would be able to do anything better than humans could And then they started turning people into meat mist
You are not the only person who remembers First Man. I love that film. I really felt like I was stepping out onto the moon in complete silence the first time I watched that scene. I felt like we earned getting there. Great movie
4:57 Not really. Considering what he's been spouting today.
“I actually enjoy this movie”  *complains for 19 minutes*  “Alright now the good part”
Do war crimes count for transformers? They are a different species with potentially different laws
‘BUMBLEBEEEEEE’ ‘OPTIMUUUSSSSS’ Sam calling out to the autobots like he’s summoning them is so funny ngl
Idk , I love all the transformers movies , it’s fun simple and epic .
Dang it! The humans are so useless, it’d have been best if Optimus Prime and the Autobots would leave the humans to die along with the Earth! Especially Agent Simmons!!! 🤬
Rip Ironhide, he will be missed.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon was my first Transformers movie I watched in the theaters.
Forgot about the Bumblebee movie with Zhong Xina
yea, this one remains my favorite of the franchise just for how fun it is. the first had far too much awkward humor and the second is the second, but this one just had a boatload of that robot action that made the movies semi-watchable. it's still a bastardization of the transformers name tho.
2:49, I want to know where that clip is from
I found it quite funny that Michael Bay made an entirely new character to replace Mikaela because of his disputes with Megan Fox. But could have just recasted her to the new actress since they looked so similar. Just ask the new actress to dye her hair black and done. It would have made Sam's relationship with her make more sense.
I don’t know why but it is the perfect Bay action movie same as Red 2 people criticize them but I watch it over and over again and T3 is still the est Transformers movie from all for me
Something I’ve never understood: why did they make a new character just because Megan Fox left? You can just have someone else play the same character. The Dark Knight did it, nobody really cared about it and everyone still thinks it’s a solid movie
“Somehow, they must’ve picked up that fuel Rod.” has the same energy as “Somehow… Palpatine has returned.”
Has anyone ever notice that the wheels on Megatron's left foot are clipping through the steps of the Lincoln statue?
Unpopular opinion dark of the moon is one of the best movies in my opinion
I love dotm because of Dino/mirage 😂
Of course they have blood. I've worked on cars anyway you can think of, including crushing them down. There is a LOT of pretty colored fluids that come out. So what do you expect when Bumblebee tears apart a Deception?
dude im loving the spyro music
Crapping on blade while praising this 😅
Make a live action pokemon movie but the pokemons are mutants in the chernobyl exclusion zone. The trainers are STALKERS from the video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
There must be something wrong with me then because I love this version of Optimus
I was always curious why couldn’t they just kill Mikayla off or something
I know this is months later but think about it, why did every indiana Jones movie feature the nazis as the villains? Spielberg fucking hates em, he is well known for disliking nazis above anyone else actually
I kind of feel bad for Megan Fox cause bay has always been creepy and a jerk to Fox
Sounds like the original plot to Pokemon in the manga lmao
what i love about michel bay transformers trilogy its BRUTAL AS F#@K
18:33, Bro you can't blame Eren Kruger, he's just following the will of the founding titan. He keeps moving forward til all our braincells are destroyed.
This 40 years old sound likin guy is somewhat near my age wow
Man sounds like alternate history
I always wonder where the entire world’s military is in movies where a world ending threat is happening like u would think that every country would try to stop a bunch of aliens destroying humanity
Yall haters, all movies were good except 5, that one was...rough to say the least
I remember my elementary school having this movie night were they played tranformers 3. and even as a kid (idk like 8 or 9) I told my mom, "hey doesn't this seem pretty violent for an elementary school's movie night? like people are getting vaporized here." and i don't remember if they turned it off, because this was already the huge battle scene, the movie was almost done. But my mom took that as me being freaked out and had us leave. lol. Imagine straight up 5-6 year olds watching this.
Hey, First Man was a banger and i absolutely loved it.
7:30 don't threaten me with a good time
1-3 were good but when they got to 4 it sucked. It sucked so bad that the five movie had better scenes. Well bumblebee was pretty good
Fun fact: The first 3 Transformers along with Star Wars and the Godzilla movies have captured so many of my good memories from childhood that i can no longer feel enjoyment from anything 😊
Just as a side note it could be transmission fluid not blood but they’re definitely implying it’s their blood Soo🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Earth must be the most dangerous cognitohazard in the galaxy if only five years on this planet was enough to turn Optimus into a open war criminal.
I recently looked at the release date of this movie and released I was 7 or 8 when I saw this in theaters and I’d seen the first two multiple times before hand. I cried in that theater when people were being fucking vaporized
I have never made it the whole way through a transformers sequel. I watched almost an hour and a half of this movie and don't know anything you're talking about.
17:15 Gotta love how Megatron is just casually clipping through the stairs, ffs....
As a Chicago resident, I can say, who gives a flying fu©k about Chicago. It is basically already a war zone, they just gave us cooler shit to die to.
Chicago is a warzone IRL anyway...
What I would really like to see is a transformers live action series in which you have time to get attached to the characters.  I wouldn’t mind it being darker than the cartoon (the comics sure were), but it shouldn’t be silly.  Optimus Prime has always been a capable fighter, but he was never merciless like this
Your edit of Ironhides death completely caught me off guard and I couldn’t stop laughing for a solid minute
I’ve been calling this film ‘Dark side of the moon’ forever… 😂
While I understand and agree with the general stance on this, I also understand why it turned out the way it did, the 80's was corny by today's standards.   The original animated movie turned everything around, but the age we're living in did the most harm.   They could have made it a separate property, but brand recognition demands that it be called Transformers.
Transformers 4 had some of the worst product placement ever
Somebody in the audience clapped at the end when I went to go see this lol
"Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod" inspired The Rise of Skywalker.
I understand the issues with Megan Fox and the abrupt and pretty stupid decision to just replace her with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, but if I'm honest, I'm happy it happened, because then she might not have been in Fury Road, and she was great in that.
Optimus saying "time to find out" before KOing him still gives me chills. Just one of the best moments in the franchise
Dude when I first saw soundwave I was on the floor, even before I really got into transformers he was my favorite, but man when I realized who this satellite guy was I just. Took me a long time to recover. 😂
Sentinel killed Ironhide because he never liked the type of transformer he was. The red shit was racist. What do ya know?
"What if pokemon was a fad?" Sounds like what happened to Digimon.
The Pokémon part answer is Palworld
Damn I remember seeing footage from that edgy pokemon live action when I was a kid, I don't know what it is tho, can anyone help?
Id like to see a video on "How to make Transformers better" like what changes would make the movies a better and more consistent story. Like keeping the same actors or if they do change the actors they give us an explanation and like maybe have better characters and not just jerk off Optimus and Bumblebee, but other than that idk i im not a movie nerd to figure this shit out. Great vid tho, i do agree that the movies are like not good but i still love them.
16:30 shoutout to all westerners who in 2022 call Chornobyl region (((russia))) and not Ukraine during the 12th month of russian invasion in Ukraine (even when in the movie it was called soviet which had 15 republics in it so it's not that bad)
"It's all: War Crime this, Can't eat the Dry Wall that. Microwaving MICE was was Wrong they said." -maxors mgr sundowner.
If you took notice, you would realized immediately this entire movie is an extended cut for the season 2 two episodes of the g1 cartoon titled "Megatron's master plan", no im not kidding, they literally took the whole 40 minutes or so of the cartoon and extended the shit out of it to make a movie, god you gotta love Hollywood and their cheap ass
Alternate history hub is going the way of knowledge hub
Transformers 3 is just an average day in Chicago
the idea of an illegal nuclear program is such a good example of war on terror era statist propaganda.
I wanna be this guy's friend.
I also have a dark secret, I love revenge of the fallen.
cracked ahh movie
I thought it was "Darkside of the Moon", not "Dark of the Moon". I guess I remember that because it sounds better.
Fun FACT: Shockwave was supposed to be the main antagonist but for some reason was replaced by sentinel
NASA eats up billions of tax money every year.  last one was increased to 24 billions. im pretty sure that money could be used for something far more useful on earth.
I want someone to use AI to put Megan Fox into this movie
this movie is kinda ruined for me now that i know that shia lebuff is... the biggest abusive psychopath that ever existed
15:06 aye time to renqme to balrog562
Iron hide was my brothers favorite transformer . And he cried when that happened in theaters
If i am not mistaking they say around 10 thousand people died in the chicago war which bothered me a lot. Like you see the city man! No way it is that low
Lol I have heaps of toys from this movie from back in the day
Just found your channel and i love your transformers videos. You point out so much that I never even thought about. I loved all the transformers I don't care what anyone says they're just dumb fun.
dotm is the best transformers movie in my opinion
Swayze?
This one was actually my favourite
I had no idea that Megan was let go. The weird movie lines make sense.
Idk why people like you always complain about plot holes in these movies, it's not like the original g1 had a perfect plot aswell as people hating it's too brutal, if it was just like g1 it would be too childish, whenever people try to make live action versions of cartoons almost always turn out bad
The Autobots were really drafted into the Iran Conflict 😭
Best transformer is the 'mountain dew machine' can't give the small fella enough credit
The best description I’ve ever heard for the Transformers movies is this: “If ‘camp’ is normally the exaggeration of femininity, Transformers is that for masculinity.”
I’m personally offended that Spielberg was ever associated with the transformers franchise I feel like Sean Connery in last crusade, telling Donovan why did you associate yourself with the slime of humanity?
This is one of those movies where I kinda just disregard all the flaws with the plot in favour of giant robot slugfest. Say what you will but the action in this movie js fuckin awesome
I am old as fuck, I was the original target demographic for Transformers. I was 8 when the original Galvitron movie came out with Orson Wells voiced Omicron. EVERY OUNCE OF TRANSFORMER MEDIA WAS AT MINIMUM CONCEIVED TO SELL TOYS. The '86 Transformer movie only existed to roll out the new line of toys. What I am trying to say is that if you expect anything more from a Transformer movie other than giant robot fights you are delusional and lying to yourself. If they rehired Micheal Bay to make 50 more of these don't think/consume giant robot fight movies I will be at the front of the line to stupidly consume. What I'm saying is it says more about you that you have such high expectations of your toy commercials than any comment you can make about how vapid said toy commercials are!!!!!!! 😂😂😂
16:18 Palpatine returned. You know what I mean 😉
8:53 Palpatine returned. You know what I mean 😉
megan fox turned into a total slam pig when she got with MGK. shes more plastic than human now. i used to think she was so hot, and down to earth but her personality and looks have  declined so hard its like the wall accelerated towards her and just kept going.
Did you rip some nerd music?
Honest to god the voices sound so similar that it made the ending better, cause I thought it was like this  Sentinal (to megatron): we made a truce Megatron (to sentinel): all I wanted, was to be back in charge. Besides, where would you be without me prime? Optimus (out of fucking nowhere) time to find out  I rly thought it was a villains leader spat and not Megatron wanting peace and the ending made so much more sense😭😭😭
Somehow, the fuel rods returned...
So, Megatron's plan. The way I always saw it, the civil war happened over the period of thousands of years, and during that time a lot of shit went down. Plans were laid and either didn't pan out or were thwarted. Sleeper agents were never activated. Resources were depleted. And both sides have had a lot of time to think of a thousand different ways they could finally win the war. Importantly, I'm fairly sure they all have multiple fires in the oven at any given time. They're searching for a hundred different superweapons, studying a thousand different ways to restore their planet, etc.  What I'm getting at is, I don't think Megatron had literally planned on these exact events taking place. Rather, I think he's just making use of these resources as they are becoming available to him. So like, when he loses he takes a bit to figure out a course of action based on the circumstances at the time- which probably involves a lot of him going 'oh okay, so x thing happened 500 years ago, so if I combine that with y new thing that just happened I might be able to do z plan'. So in this way when some plan fails, he moves on to another one.  For instance, I imagine that the Decepticons knew about Earth all along- what with the Fallen being involved. So when Sentinel conspires with Megatron to betray the Autobots and rebuild Cybertron, and they suddenly have need of a slave-race, they have the perfect target in mind. When Sentinel crash lands, the Decepticons make a note of it, and plant the pillars around the globe just in case they can figure out a way to use the Space Bridge.  Also, I imagine this all happened like, hundreds of years ago when Cybertron was 'still alive' and they had access to the kind of resources needed to make mass interstellar travel a reality. Sort of like how if the US devolved in some sort of massive civil war, the government could probably launch a mission to the Moon if they thought it was necessary. But after a few decades of fighting, you'd be lucky to get up a single satellite.  I also imagine that doing all this requires a lot of energy, and one of the big things about the last movie was explaining how they can't make more Energon. I imagine all or most of their technology relies on that stuff for power. So I'm thinking the moon army was probably on Earth to oversee the search for the Allspark and Matrix, plus secure the Ark and pillars. As time went on and their energy problems worsened, they gradually mothballed these ships until there were none left active, and they had to use the pillars to bring them to Earth due to said lack of energy. As for why they were buried, well, presumably it was to camouflage them.  Or maybe it was just more convenient to space bridge them since they had it available. Space is awful big after all, flying at non relativistic speeds the trip from the Moon to Earth is between several hours and days.  Anyway, sometime after Sentinel crashlands the Decepticons discover the Allspark is on Earth. Now at this point, I imagine all the fighting-capable bots have been recalled to Cybertron or sent on more urgent missions, leaving only a handful of seekers who are all decrepit at this point and living on low-power mode, so they send out a signal instead of scouring the globe and securing it themselves. Megatron, wanting to ensure that no one gets any bright ideas, and also just out of sheer arrogance, goes for the Allspark personally, and crashlands in Antarctica.  In this way, going after the Allspark is just an opportunistic thing, not really a grand plan he's hinging everything on. Freezing in Antarctica is a massive setback, and all the Decepticons except some of the seekers have all left Earth at this point  Anyway, so after the events of Transformers, the Allspark is destroyed. And it was really the most convenient way of making Energon, but they do have another way- the harvester. It just requires Megatron to kill Optimus first because The Fallen ain't risking his million year-old ass on this. Obviously, it's better to have this portable cube with limitless energy which also acts as a reliquary of hidden knowledge, as opposed to this huge machine that destroys suns that you probably don't have the resources to move, requires you to find a seemingly unfindable artifact that you've been searching for for thousands of years and only two bots alive can use anyway, and to top it all off you have to kill the seemingly invincible murder machine that is Bayverse Optimus Prime- and we know Megatron would have done it already if he could. It's only due to the power boost of the allspark, ambushing him alone, the gang-up, and protecting Sam that Megatron was able to kill Optimus. I doubt he expected it to happen that quickly actually.  So yeah, Revenge of the Fallen was essentially Megatron going to plan B and getting lucky. Probably not something he was counting on, just something he took advantage of.  Finally we get to Dark of the Moon. At this point, Megatron is looking through his options and figures out that if he can trick Optimus into reviving Sentinel, the former Prime can take Optimus out in a surprise attack, they can activate the space bridge, and Sentinel will get the Matrix besides- might even be able to revive the Fallen with it.  So when you think of it like that, it makes sense. Megatron has been doing this for thousands of years, and as the war has gone on, both leaders have gotten fairly resourceful, but at the same time he's given up on any kind of traditional military victory and is grasping at straws.
How you feel about this movie, I feel about Revenge of the Fallen. Like, I know it's bad, but I unironically enjoy it.
16:42 Ive never seen Fox news depicted so accurately 😂
TF3 will always be in my mind, that one movie that secretly goes hard to the point Disney ripped off it's climax in order to make the first Avengers movie
Yeah the city war part was actually kinda scary, you can surmise the human death from all the explosions when you realize the density of Chicago
I always figured the blood stuff was energon but like blood when it’s blue/red when it’s oxygenated or not, the energon becomes red. And it’s mixed with hydraulic fluid
I think what ACTUALLY happened with pokemon is more comparitable to transformers than your hypothetical. Here's why, I'm confused as too why you deam that transformers was basically dead after beast wars. Like yes, the time between beast wars and g1 was ROUGH, but the franchise still had steam and stuck around as a cartoon you would see in some variety all throughout the 2000s well after the beast era but before the movies. At the time the franchise was smaller than the 80s, being mostly anime at that point, but it was still a super popular toyline that never again sunk into obscurity like in the late 80s and early 90s. I think that is another reason why the movie was so jarring, because those anime designs, while NOT g1, kept the same blocky kinda corny aesthetic and vibe from the original. The movies are what put it back on the map for awhile in a big way like the 80s, but even now that hype has died way the hell down. The franchise has it's moments of huge peaks in popularity and then phases where the popularity dies down, but it hasn't been a dead franchise, and not a FAD to the 80s.
It's a bad movie that I *love*. I too was a teenage boy when I saw it. Now I'm trans. Coincidence? I think not.
Plot for these movies takes a back seat for me, bc the appeal is Transformers.  That’s it.  I just headcannon the plot into making sense automatically so I love all the movies.  Kinda sad it’s probably over bc there was clearly meant to be more after the Knight
8:05 I think that is oil when i was little i thought that that red stuff was blood but i think it's oil
12:04p.m. 3/25/2023
Can we just talk about how Soundwave's gun is literally just a MP5 submachine gun?
The Designs of the decepticons were always much cooler than the autobots, but I disliked how the villains got crushed so seemingly effordlessly. It Seemed like 1 Autobot can take 5 decepticons. Also the build up of shockwave and then he only hold up 10 seconds in an even fight
Damn. It really be like that. :/
I think I actually understand why Optimus is the way he is in this universe. The decepticons  are walking talking war crimes. I feel like in order to fight an entire army of those things you kinda have to become just as much a savage.
That alternate ending is very cool
Actually Intimidate lowers attack not special defense
Shockwave was really wasted potential. That said, seeing him in Bumblebee was awesome, and I’d like to see more of that G1 style and voice.
When Dark of the Moon was being filmed my parents went to Milwaukee and saw some of the shooting which I think is pretty cool
I liked the movie a lot.
I searched pornhub and this is what came up .-.
TRAMPTİFORMLİERSSYPTERS
When i was 11 the scene in which optimus , having only one arm, kills megatron by tearing his head apart made ne cheer and scream like i was in a football game
When this movie came out i was 11, and i was blown away fro how gruesome, crude and violent that movie was, SPECIALLY RHE LITTLE PINK BUBLEBEE THAT IS HUMAN SIZE AND KILLS PEOPLE
i loved the live action pokemon movie mf cries avout everything
Dark of the Moon is still my by far favorite of all of them
1. Dark of the moon 2. Tranformers 1  3. Bumblebee 4. Revenge of the fallen 5. The last knight 6. Age of extinction
The biggest plot hole is the Fallen and Megatron was there the whole time and didn't think to wake up Sentinel Prime and start the plan
that's why i loved this movie, it had everything i ever wanted, in one moment
The first trilogy is my favoriet and DOTM is peak Transformers cinema ... I think if ROTF had a few more scene and fleshed out a bit it could be regarded as a good one to but its probably my 2nd or 3 favotie movie ...
0:20 I couldn't hear that without laughing out loud.  0:43 The funny thing is that I have heard some Pokemon fans wanting a "mature" Pokemon game like that.
I really like Transformers Dark of the Moon too.
Mate megatron executed an autobot crawling and pleading for his life without moving so much as a single servo in the G1 transformers movie. Warcrimes have been a staple of the franchise for ages.
11:11 yo guys Ik that we're supplying tanks to Ukraine. But 1st we're sending bumblebee.
No you’re valid. DOTM is good. Atleast I think. I enjoyed it a lot and it felt like it had real stakes and real character arcs. Ofc with some exceptions as you said
Revenge of the fallen was my favorite movie as kid, lmao. I remember I had it burnt on DVD and literally watched it like 70+ easily.
I remember being in Chicago when this movie was being filmed. I could see one of the set pieces from my hotel room. Every night I’d hear nothing but explosions. One morning my mom asked what they were filming and she thought my stepdad was joking when he told her it was transformers.
I am honored to have the town I was born and raised in be home to Blues Brothers and this gorry mess
Transformers seem to have an inconsistency when it comes to their weapons that kinda bug me. Granted, it is a nitpick, really, but why is it that sometimes transformers' weapons are within the transformer itself and other times carried around like human weapons? I get that g1 had the robots carry around guns, but the movies/games since then can't seem to decide whether transformer weapons are part of them or separate. I personally prefer the idea that they transform parts of themselves into weapons rather than building guns and carrying them like people.
I honestly love how Optimus just kills Sentinel and Megatron. Yes, it doesn't fits his character, but both of them brutally executed his friends, so at this point he's just done of looking for peace
I dont care what anyone says about the transformers movies.I loved them, still love them to this day. Its my whole childhood.
Shouldn't it have been titled    'Far side of the moon'   not dark of the moon.
LMAO I CANT FUCKING HELP IT, THE SPONGEBOB EDITS
Transformers dark of the moon will forever be top 3 movies for me
I enjoy watching the abhorrent populace of Chicago being terrorized
Nope..it never followed the cartoon...they let sponsorship kill it
Bro saying transformers is violent 😭😭😭 they don’t have blood they have fluids😭😭😭 you realize cars contain lots of fluids and I’m sure transformers have fluid of some kind to help lubricate their bodies 😭😭😭 bro cmon they aren’t even real!!!!
Fun fact if you really dwell deep into the lore of the war between decepticons and autobots it's pretty dark
tbh sentinel deserved it, rip ironside
my favrt
The movie makes a lot more sense imagining Mikela instead of Carly
Dark of the Moon is still my favorite of the penta-movie series. The first one is such a close second, but 3 edged it because of the action.
17:15 Megatrons foot is clipping
Feels like we just glossed over Megan Fox saying she F-ing DRINKS blood like some moody goth teen or vampire..
I’m still tore up about Ironhides death, I can’t get over it
I like it how on one clip while everyone is fighting and he put elevator music in the background like this one 14:33
I liked about Transformers age of Extinction was the Dinobots
Thank god im not the only one who saw that Ryan gosling movie about Neil Armstrong
Is that Shia LaBeouf
10:55 to 11:04 had me dying bro
i would watch an entire transformers movie that is all blow shit up
2007-2011 was peak gritty balls to the walls culture. For both Movies and Video Games. Ever since then it’s been cringy lowest common denominator appeal to everyone and therefore no one entertainment.
What got me kicked out of the theater was Merlin convincing a Transformer dragon. I can't stop laughing.
Now I won't sit here and try to defend the movies. I will say I personally liked the first 3 movies but I did notice the decline in quality.
Charlie Berens being used as a visual aid for Chicago…
The only redeemable parts about four and five was hound in my opinion because Missy most American transformer in the movie 😂    Also in 4 dude use literally everything he had even used his belt as a whip against them, and obviously we can't forget about the cigarette gun  That was unexpected
well to be fair, in the Marvel comic, Transformer is quite dark as well, with plenty of betray and war crime.
i’M aN iNvEnToR.
thank god Michael Bay is no longer a director of these transformers movies
The blood is transmission fluid😂💯
True but..... Goddamn do the visuals, music, and action still hold up. Dark of the Moon has the best and worst traits of Bay but the good outweigh the bad for me.
I was so pissed when they killed Ironhide they already done ratchet and jazz dirty
it felt weird to be a the only teenager seeing this movie and having the same feelings about it as the 20-30 year old's who grew up with the original.  however I recently gave the first and third movies a re-watch and definitely had a better time, I even thought "Man I'd really like a video game that captures the feeling of being a vulnerable human facing down these colossal robotic forces of nature, using only your weapons, tech, and ingenuity, with occasional moments of bombastic catharsis where you get to experience being one of said colossal robots."  ...then I booted up Titanfall 2.
Aeyy fuck you, i like it.
VERY NICE
I remember people hating on this movie for the sole reason is because their waifu wasn't in this movie. Who cares about the Transformers, Megan Fox isn't in it *sarcasm*. Heck, they don't care the movie's dozen flaws, to them, the movie is terrible because she isn't in it.  I thought people be happy that Shia's new GF is based on his actual G1 GF and later wife but who cares, their waifu isn't in it.  It is true we spent 2 movies on their relationship and it suddenly vanished. All that time spent went down the drain but yeah, Megan and Shia's characters could evolved with them proposing or the irony she got a fancy big job while the post college graduate is struggling. Also, why are they living with Mikaela's dog?
The Decepticons clashing goals in the movies made more sense in the IDW tie-ins comics. It was actually Soundwave  who was working with the evil humans in the 60s/70s but was he unaware Megatron was on the planet all iced up. He found out about it and met up with Megatron, just in time of the events of TF2. When everything was over from the 2nd film, he told Megs about Sentinel and the moon.  Sadly, Bay himself was upset all the 3rd film's plot twists was spoil by the comic adaptation and novelization, he forbid any more films having tie-ins. Now the Marky Mark films have plotholes that won't be covered
12:13 Naw bro I remember that toy it was super fucking cool.
The transformers movies is like the studio playing a game and they’re like 2/5 but even they don’t know how they got the 2 wins so they just keep throwing money at it
I don't why but seeing megatron rip jazz apart was just dirty in the movie because for the majority of transformers he was prime's second in command but I guess some people just preferred bumblebee
"after a little... incident in the office" poinless 2022
I still love these movies. ALL of them no matter what anyone says. Go ahead, hate me. It won't change my mind
Fuck nuance, just brutally murder all my enemies….sounds pretty American to me.
How are you gonna disrespect Patrick Swazey(RIP) like that by mixing him up with Patrick Dempsey. 😞
Except Pokemon hasn't died off lol
Meh. Spielberg has lost his artistic integrity.
the original ending is so much better
Remember back when movies were orange and teal?
Leonard Nimoy's last movie. And of course Nimoy was in the '86 Transformers movie, which was Orson Welles' last movie.
I remember watching this movie for the first time in theaters with my mom lol. And when the humans started getting straight up massacred by the decepticons I was pretty dumb founded at the blatant mass murder of the people of Chicago.   Ironhides death also being shockingly brutal was the first sign that this movie was pretty different tonally speaking. I think I also like this movie but not because it’s good. I’ll never defend this movie, but if im forced to watch it there’s definitely some entertainment to be had in the dumb schlock violent nature of the whole thing. Which can’t be said for the second or the first movie. The sound design in the first movie is top notch, it’s also one of the only movies in the franchise where you see the transformers…you know actually transforming. Every movie after the first one it starts happening off screen.
As a kid, I never knew the original Transformers was so ridiculous. So when these new gritty, threatening robots were brutally fighting, I thought it was how it was supposed to be. That just made it so much cooler. I actually love that they turned an ultimately goofy cartoon into something super dark and really cool.
Shockwaves just standing there. MENACINGLY!!!!
Between Michael Bay being or not being offended by Megan Fox *AND* Steven Spielberg actually being behind it, I would guess the later was the case. Shortly after that "dispute" Megan Fox appears in another movie, that WAS produced by Michael Bay (TMNT), so they had to work together in a way, meaning Bay most likely wasn't as offended, as it would seem and likely Spielberg stepped in.
I still enjoy TF 1 and 2 to this day. I have yet to watch the third one though.
I like big boom boom, that's why I liked it.
me at the beginning of this video : what does pokemon have anything to do with transformers?
More like took all that Transformers was and turned it into massive shit.
This movie is early 2010's nostalgia. Yeah, was bad as a film, but, damn, I just love the third movie for all the reasons you said.
wait, is that one of Megatron's tires just clip into the throne stage at 17:16?
honestly, i rewatched this movie after the video just for the last fight. little me was losing my shit in the cinema and it still holds up today
i can't believe we're being subjected to yet another goddamn one of these movies in 4 months
20:30 Well, it is lore friendly. Shockwave has always been the most awesome and most underused of the Decepticons.
20:09 let me correct you. its classic michael bay-isms. practical sets and explosions
5:15 Of course! Why not? Its Michael Bay, baby. 😅
Funny doddle man say funny words in deep voice, like video
Honestly Megan Fox not being in the movie was the biggest let down. Not just for looks but also cause Mikaela wasn't in the film either.  Going in to see the film at 13-- Sam and Mikaela's relationship story arc conclude was what I wanted to see. Even kid me had come to appreciate that Michael Bay delivered in Giant robots having cool fights--along with soldiers. So to see Sam actually go through his own satirical bullshit life, it would be nice to see him happy with the girl we knew from the start
As a kid in the 80's collecting Transformers toys I honestly like the live action movies. I'd rather have a decent attempt than nothing at all. No doubt there's a lot of cringy moments in these movies but it could be way worse. And seriously... boo!!!! for bringing in Buzz Aldrin claiming to be a "fellow space traveler" Pft!!!!  Great vid dude. 🤘🏻
Unapologetic circlejerk of the "space industrial complex"? What does that even mean? If there's something that deserves to be put in a good spotlight is space exploration, manned space exploration specifically.
Michael Bay *was* an awful person. He purposefully oversexualized the women, and just... eugh
My man can put the ducktales moon song behind anything and it will seem like the greatest thing ever.
Ms. Huntington-Whitley was the first celebrity I can remember having a crush on. It _almost_ made me want to watch the movie.
So in short, movie is bad but robot violence is fun
Pokemon franchise will never die because there is too much porn of it
The parts I liked in this movie for the Autobots and the Deceptacon’s talking to each other or fighting because it felt important especially because the human scenes were boring most of the time
I feel there was a HUGE missed opportunity to utilize and further develop Chicago in the Transformers movies past TF3. Here's what they could have done IMO: they could have shown Chicago being recunstructed with the help of the Autobots in the fourth movie, and this new Chicago would then be upgraded with Cybertronian technology, whith new cybertronian buildings rising high into the skyline, and the city would also be powered almost exclusively by Energon. This newly reconstructed and upgraded Chicago would then be rechristened: Autobot City.
I totally forgot that they fucking had the Autobots attack Iran. Like, holy shit, it's like portraying Superman as killing Sadam. It's so jarring how they want to draw parallels between the US Armed Forces and super heroes but this is just taking it to another level. At least when the enemy is fictional there are possible excuses. But we are talking about Iran, the country that at the time was basically surrendering all its facilities to the US. Godamn, it must really fucking hurt when you comply to even the most absurd demands and then you are still portrayed as "karma free kills for the good guys".
I always thought this was by far the best transformers movie
Steven Spielberg is Jewish so him being mad at the hitler comment actually makes sense
1:22 is no one gonna mention that hes using Transformers Cybertron music in this segment? That show had a killer soundtrack
I can’t believe you devoted more than 10 seconds to explain Megan Fox’s character and her replacement.  The amount of real time and money put into such characters, is probably, definitely, exactly why these movies suck ass more and more.  Nobody, and I mean *nobody* cares what the human people are doing, when there are giant robots/monsters are fighting. Obviously, we need one or two human characters to follow along with the plot, but everyone else? Total, inconsequential, uninteresting bullshit.
9:20 Kirov Report - wait, wrong game
Action in Hollywood movies is so boring nowaday. I thought the brutality of transformers was always a huge bonus
“What if she dumps us like the last girl”  Meanwhile on Paramount mountain dear god these ads
i know this is a fun fact for the next movie but i have no point of contact with this silly youtube cartoon man  apparently skrillex did the sound design for the magnet ship scene in the 4th movie but i have 0 proof for this outside of a tweet
Funny, I liked the 4th film better. Granted its been ages since and i remember having a hate boner for Bay cause of these movies, so maybe its time to revisit these films.
“Optimus I think you need to take a vacation”  “Where”  “GENEVA!!!”
Megatron sure did put a lot of effort trying to kill Optimus considering he needed him to revive Sentinel
Megatron does actually drop energon so i gues its Oil from the moving components we see
I did a worksheet in third grade and one of the questions was “what is your favorite movie?” And my sweet little third grade brain chose Transformers: Dark of the Moon. What was wrong with me this movie is so brutal
I just realized Shockwave looks like the Warden from Minecraft
Say what you want about the Bay movies those fight scenes were something else
Transformers: dark of the Nuremberg trials
DEEP WANG
Just imagine for a moment if you will  If all of the robot characters were humans. It really is fucking hilarious what you can get away with by replacing the characters with robots.  Like imagine an action movie where the main character and his buddies just grab an enemy combatant out of a crashed aircraft and just rip him apart like fucking animals. Organs and limbs everywhere and shit
dude dark of the moon didn't happen in the first movie because megatron crash landed way before sentinel which happened in 1895 while sentinel incident happened in 1969.  In 1969, the decepticons discovered sentinel's ship and took all his tech which they thought can be helpful for war, but it didn't work because sentinel is the only one had the key to operate. since the decepticons doesn't have any power to revive sentinel, they made it a backup plan. After years of searching for megatron and the cube, the decepticons finally found out that both are in earth, so they invade earth in 2007. After the second movie, decepticons decided to go for the backup plan so now that they have the device that can revive other robots (matrix of the leadership). Megatron had that deal with sentinel in Earth if you're wondering
7:05 almost spilled my coffee bro 😂
That Spyro music brings back memory's
Ok, so I WAS gonna watch this video, but lost interest when I READ transformers, then SAW Pokémon. Do better man
I loved dark of the moon just as much as I loved the first live action movie I liked the darker tune and darker take on the war
If your a true transformers fan you would know they don’t die they become one with the spark so yea idk what you’re talking about
I love dark of the moon and on
Dark of the Moon was one of the best movie intros
Honestly couldn't stand Megan Fox in transformers or the ninja turtles movies,  only purpose she had in both movies was delivering exposition, that's it.
Transformers 1, 2 and 3 were all good, the rest suck ass
Bruh where is part four man!
Bruh overthinking a Hollywood movie
My favorite lines of Optimus Prime are “GIVE ME YOUR FACE” and “IM GOING TO KILL YOU”. Truly the most peaceful and wise leader.
I like to think of the blood as transmission fluid 😅
7:05 lmao
I love how the weird side of the fandom calls Optimus "Best Space Dad" and Bumblebee "Best Robo Boy" when they're both older than Earth itself.
In my top 10 films ever
Bro the dog was banging the other dog 1:24
17:02 lmfao
Lets not forget that he said "give me your face" while killing the fallen
I grew up watching beast wars and beast machines and from the vague memories I can remember from those two shows, transformers was always very dark, I've unfortunately never seen the original series, so my view may be a tad skewed.
I just watched this movie last night. I have been seeing poor reviews for the movie, but I personally loved it. I like brutal violence in movies.
Transformers 2 had a railgun and was the most epic of the 3 films.
Yellow fellow midwestern
12:13 i had that fucking toy
transformers 2 didn't start the cluttered design ... the 2007 first one started that shit. MB went with cluttered overly complex design from the get go. it's part of why i can't stand any of these movies.  the only saving grace was the bumble bee movie.  they actually took the designs back a step there and made the robbot forms more reconizabe as "car " transformers , or "plane" transformers . instead of making the robot forms tuck, flatten and fold away all their vehicle looking bits.  after that the over use of close angle shots  really made these hard to watch. half the time you can't tell if you're looking at  megatrons anus or optimus's pecker. the clsoe in shots just make the over complicated design  even worse to view. you can't tell what is going on 80% of the movie. this is another thing the bumble be movie remedied , by doing more wide shots than close up ones.
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but what you said about violence not mattering if it's robots is very interesting because in the Bad Batch, Disney's sequel to the clone wars, clone force 99 will only use stun on human/clone enemies. But if the species is alien, despite being humanoid, or robots/droids they use actual blaster fire. So I do think this point is very solid across companies and genres
i fucking loved this movie, not everything has to be a cinematic masterpiece to be fun lol
If some one calls you literally hitler ya  You should be fired
i think the new desine for shockwave is my favoret
12:12 I HAVE THAT TOY
TBH, the animated movie deaths scarred me much more than this movie ever did
I can't believe Michael Bay killed Ironhide.
it'd be weird if pokemon all of a sudden started killing off characters yes, but tranformers died in the comics and OG shows so it's not really strange to see in a movie. Not only that transformers and pokemon are totally different franchises so it's kinda strange to compare them on something so specific. Also i didn't realize that regulations had been established regarding war with aliens lmao. Cause if not, then there's no war crimes commited if there's no laws to break
You can say about the story what you want, the less the better probably, but the action was great
Shoutout to Optimus prime for bombing Iran I to remember the great bombing of Iranian nuclear base’s that the autobots did though I wish it was a different base
I know how you feel about the movie, for no reason I LOVE the fifth movie
When I was a 2nd grader, I would watch this movie almost every day and used to legit skip 2/3 of the film so I could just watch the Chicago War scene. I never saw any of the flaws in this film, just cool explosions
end in peace? how
i used to play a lot of horror , action games as a kid so seeing this brutal fights was so sick, i wish i could go back in time to experience that hype again.
We don't care
yea fr she was gone until she hated MGK
Yes the moon landing is as real…..In this completely ridiculous remake of a movie.    And its “patrick dempsey”
It's okay to like dumb things. Just know it's dumb and that's pretty much the kicker.
“We will kill them all” Love that line! 😂
I completely forgot that in this movie transformers would literally vaporize humans into bones amd dust
14:20 Friday was about JFK, wonder if this is a reference?
Megan Fox was definitely right, Michael Bay has been telling us what a bigoted dick he is through his movies for decades, she just said the loud part out loud
The Book was better? well of course it was written by Peter David
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings...  Even Megatron. Freedom from his head, that is.
There’s so many things I never noticed until you pointed it out in this video
As a child of the 80s, I find it next to impossible not to enjoy any of these movies. Honestly, they're stupid, but I love them.  The winning formula they came up with was to not overthink it. 2.5 hours of enormous action and dumb comedy 1 liners.  They could bring LaBeouf back now and just say "you be you" and insert him in, and it would still work.
First Man is insanely awesome movie
I thought the opening part with all the stealth NASA stuff was by far the best part of this movie. They should have leant on it more.
I always thought it was odd that after being a bullied shell of his former self that Megatron just got iced in such a brutal way after saving his lifelong enemy from the big bad. It's nice to know that there actually was a second ending that would have played out much more in line with how I would have thought it would have went.
I've always loved the transformers movies. They were fun to watch if you wanted to turn off your brain and enjoy some action with (sometimes) funny jokes sprinkled in between.  The story (at least for me) was straightforward and didn't really need much of explaining outside of the movies themself. The switch up in origin stories was very weird though, how first they came for the AllSpark, then they were already on Earth the whole time but to be honest I haven't really noticed those switch ups until I've watched your TF2 video.  It did take a bit of a dip after the 3rd one though. I still don't fully understand what happened with the 4th one even though I've watched it countless times and enjoyed it. Like who tf is Lockdown and Galvatron and why tf can they turn from cars into literal nothingness that can change into anything.  And The Last Knight totally lost me on the story. Why was there a big battle far back in the 1500s or something with transformers in them? There's a whole lineage of Witwickies (idk if I pronounced that right). Optimus is now a bad guy. There's a transformer called Quintessa that's controlling Optimus and wants to bring back Cybertron just like they did in Dark of the Moon. Even Unicron is brought into this at the very END of the movie with an ominous message from what I assume is Quintessa in a human form almost as if it was a setup for another sequel that just wasn't meant to be. It's a shame to be honest 'cause I'd love to see what'd they do with Unicron but whatever.  Long story short, I love the transformers franchise, it's funny and fun to watch because of all the action, the stories are good (except for the 4th and 5th ones, those were weird) and they have AMAZING CGI. Best of the best. Good practical effects too.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.  And also, fuck the guy that decided it'd be a good idea to kill of a character such as Ironhide.
For  Me all the transformer movies are good for me
If the movie is to brutal don’t watch it. It’s Michael bay he mad the movie dramatic and have hella special effects. Like wtf😭😭😭
Nothing wrong with liking an objectively bad movie. Face/Off is probably the most entertaining thing I've ever seen
9:00 *All hail Lord of Dew, bringer of infinite Dew*
I like the fact that you put some Spyro the dragon music in the video :)
this video really made me acknowledge the moon landing as one the biggest flexes in human history
I like at the movies and I know that 90% of the comments are gonna hate me but idc I loved all of the Bayverse movies
I’m with Pointless, Dotm is my favorite of the entire bayformers, while it has its problems it’s far better than AoE, tLK, RotF the only one the could be considered better is the first movie but I just have more memories with Dotm
Wasn't it called darkside of the moon?
This the only transformers movie I've ever seen, i remember seeing it on an IMAX screen when I was a kid and I loved it. Tho I can barely remember it now :')
i love you
i watch transformers movies to see big robots causing mayhem in the streets anything else doesn’t matter
You can like something without losing credibility if you know what you like is bad. You lose credibility when you try to convince people it's good.   I liked ridiculous 6. It was an awful movie but it got me laughing so hard at how stupid it was that I couldn't help but like it.
Bit late, but I've watched 4 of the movies so far, 1 every day. I swear, when I saw the 3rd, and the whole point about "the space bridge was neccesary to win the war, I thought about how the old decepticon from the 2nd, (Jetfire?), just had space bridge technology. I'm pretty sure he literally mentions "space bridge" when he teleports our protagonists to the desert. Like, if it was that important, and Sentinel was the only one that was capable of making a space bridge using hundreds of pillars, why was there an old ass jet that can just use the same technology at will?  Edit: I double checked the movie, and at about 1hr 24min he tells Simmons "oh shut up, I told you I was opening up a space bridge, its the fastest way to Egypt", so my point stands
“Are we the baddies?”  Ultron: Spends 5 minutes on the internet and decides humanity has gots to go Optimus: Spends a few years on earth and becomes increasingly brutal Humans in the Bayformers films: Side with the Decepticons on numerous occasions
Vichy Chicago be like:
Sad but impressed transformers was one of the last series to use practical effects to this large a scale. I miss it.
15:41 as a space obsessed kid, I was so hype for this part 😂😂😂😂
you just have to take the rose tinted glasses off and realise that transformers had always been a ploy to sell toys since g1.
That somehow reminds me of the "somehow he has returned" line from rise of Skywalker
i was a 6 year old when this came out and it still is one of my favorite movies
15:16 why tf russians? Chernobyl is literally in Kyiv
Gonna be honest, back then I didn't like the movies because it was more of the humans and less of the transformers but I genuinely love the fight scenes especially in this movie
Transformers 3 is my favourite and I’m tired of saying otherwise
Honestly even as a kid I wasn't that mad at Mikaela being replaced cause I felt the new girl acted better
well speilberg is jewish, so i'd understand if the hitler comparison would've been...y'know a little offensive
It’s Patrick Dempsey not swayze 😂😂😂😂
but wtf is there to do except replacing the actor
1:45 me too   Why for me   It's the best Transformers Movie for what Bayverse did   terrible story/plot horrible in this movie it just pulled even more out of it's ass and then AOE & TLK pull intestines out of it too  Hot Girl was British and that felt fresh for how Mikela was in the second movie and wasn't the best character  *again* so yeah British babe was nice it didn't matter if she was still in the movie the story is terrible no redemption it's as bad as the violence is prevalent   Give me your face was beaten as a line by just Time To Find Out   Optimus was the most brutal he's ever been   More fighting and less being in a desert not doing anything besides talking for over 10 minutes with a dude that's as old as this movie is poorly written infinite  it's peak Bayverse in every way stupid plot hot new girl more bullshit that made me laugh for a bit more then AOE & TLK made me annoyed  Optimus being even more of a genocidist in disguise although I do miss 07 Megatron that is peak Megatron  Then of course Seymour Simmons (that actor is great he carries the human interest in the movie with his extreme exaggeration and stupid moments he's so ridiculous he's funny)  *Shockwave kind of just love his imposing nature he'll never beat Tranformers Prime Shockwave*   *No random "scrotum" joke*  Starscreams death is hilarious and is peak Starscream depiction cowardly and so high and mighty at the same time and once the walls fall he's exposed as a baby in a mans body peak Starscream
1:23 *good example*
Now we need the 4 tranformer
17:16 megatron’s foot is clipping the steps like a ps3 video game 😂
This felt like me listening to someone tell me something I don’t really care about, but they’re so passionate it makes me want to know more about what they’re talking about so I listen with growing interest.
16:11 "Somehow Palpatine returned."
You call that a war, but in Chicago, it’s a Tuesday.
With the way he Optimus fought you forgot the part in the second movie when he says “give me your face“ and rips the fallen’s face off
22:06 i've headcannoned that if you attack the spark/heart they don't get to pass on. that's why he always goes for the head
When the geneva convention turns to the *geneva checklist*
12:13 I still have that toy it’s broken in half though idk what happened
I watched dark of the moon last night. and man. it’s so much better than I remember
Patrick... DEMPSEY?
@7:00 ita Patrick Dempsey not swazey
Let me confuse you some more. In the lore of the movie the Matrix wasn’t even known to able to revive dead cybertronians, it was just a key to a laser that destroyed suns. No one even knew where on The Earth the Matrix Was to begin with. Only Jetfire Knew that. So If they never knew about the Matrix being able to revive dead robots how else would they get Sentinel Prime out of Stasis?
Optimus in the cartoons: be strong enough to be gentle Optimus in the movies: rip and tear until it is done
I watched this movie when I was like 10. Watching ironhide get shot in the back and turned into rust had me crying
I would have loved that alternate ending, it would have prevented I don't even know how many horrible sequels that have been made. Bumblebee was probably the best of the bunch, if not second best behind the first one.
what blows my mind is that in the late 2000s media's laissez-faire attitude towards movies exploring american-racism themes (and just coexisting in general) this film had an actual chance to do something cool, yet they just did the michael bay hollywood stereotype.  Imagine a plot centred on a new group of aliens that fight in giant mechs, all culminating to a battle where the humans have to work with the gian robots to beat the group of humanoids controlling the giant robots
I watched this when I was 5
I thought i was tripping but yes, he actually plays some of the Spyro 3 soundtrack in the background 😂
I just realized that this is the same guy as AlternateHistoryHub. Love his other channel too!
But why ironhide bruh
ngl the original ending sounds way more awesome to me, nothing gets me more excited ni media than when two enemies that hate each other have to fight on the same side against a common enemy
Why decepticon is so less colorful
This movie was awesome in almost everyway.
No Megan fox= not a proper transformers movie
17:09 hide
This movie is just crazy and i like it
I love how in time these movies have accumulated so much love from nostalgia mostly I think.
7:33, shes green
Stopped watching this series when in this movie the Autobots tortured to death a captured Decepticon.
“GIVE ME YOUR FACE” the wise and benevolent Optimus Prime
Intimidate lowers Attack not Sp. Defence
Bay movies are raunchy but….  I think prime would kill in real life because it’s just different from a kids cartoon.
Ah yes, the age old concept of applying Monday morning quarterback morality to the actions of a being who has had the biggest hand in saving the Earth and the whole of humanity THREE TIMES by this point. From the same faction of enemies no less. And he's somehow a bad guy for finally trying to ensure it doesn't happen a fourth time? Right. Despite how silly the movies can be, this is not Saturday morning cartoon Optimus, as much as I love that version. He really tried to not be as cutthroat in the first one. He was willing to sacrifice himself right from the very beginning instead of Megatron. I guess Sam is a war criminal too for using the cube on Megatron. But oh those poor Decepticons at the beginning of the second one just minding their own business. The ones who run and cause more collateral damage the second their cover is blown? The one who went on an immediate rampage down a busy freeway killing god knows how many people? The one who Optimus told to "stop and pull over" BEFORE shooting him down because he's still pancaking cars? The one who so innocently already knows about the Fallen's plans? Ok. Sure. Let him live. What could go wrong? The militaries of the world would absolutely be hunting down Decepticons after the events of the first film. If the Autobots had not been helping the military hunt them down people would be like "why aren't they helping them so maybe more soldiers don't die needlessly?" Don't forget....the Autobots are granted asylum....the Decepticons were not. They're on Earth against humany's will. There's a word for that. Hostile. So they kill at the drop of a hat and are actively still planning something and they all seem to be in on it. Oh wait....there's the part where Optimus rips that one's face apart in the forest. How horrible of him. It wasn't like he was being attacked three on one or anything. Or that he was trying to protect a person from being killed. A person they were actually after at that very moment. He even took the fight to a deserted place to minimize collateral damage. Which he does or tries to do every single time he has any control over where the fight happens. What a monster. To fight three by himself and die to save a kid. Did I see footage of what he did in Egypt to Megatron and the Fallen in there as examples of him being "too violent?" That was two on one again. He only wounded Megatron even though Megatron KILLED him earlier. And he shouldn't have killed the Fallen before the police arrived with their Decepticon sized handcuffs to arrest him. It wasn't like they were about to activate a device that would destroy the sun and Earth and everything. He should be nice and non-violent to them in the three minutes he has before they destroy the solar system. Now we're to Dark of the Moon. Humans are still giving the Autobots shit like they don't know what they're talking about. They've already caught Shockwave up to something sus as fu. They know Megatron and Starscream are still alive. How many Decepticons does Optimus kill in Dark of the Moon before they inflict a thousand 9/11s worth of damage to Chicago? Zero that I can recall. The first one being a Decepticon who was actively trying to kill people at that very moment. By this point, he's realized that their war is causing Earth way too much destruction constantly and the kid gloves aren't getting anything done. So he finally (justifiably) says "we're going to kill them all." Not killing them all hasn't been working so far. They keep coming back with ever more destructive plots that kill more people every time. It's almost like it's a last resort or something. Ya know, like even reasonable people can be pushed to if they finally reach their limit. They're about to enslave all the humans. The ones who survive anyway. Prime should just talk to them! It's not like this is the third and worst time they've done this or anything. Oh wait...he does try to talk to Sentinel. Who tells Optimus he'll kill him if he tries to stop him. The human casualties of the three films so far are astronomical. So obviously he should leave Megatron and Sentinel alive to be arrested. Because that's something that is possible. Yes, I know some Decepticons WERE incarcerated in The Last Knight. But A: Those were some real nobodies. Not Decepticons on the level of even Barricade or Starscream. B: That scene was played as a joke just to homage Con Air or Armageddon or something. And C: The Last Knight sucks and doesn't count lol. Anyways....if ("if" lol) it happens a fourth time because Optimus didn't end it when he has the chance, isn't that worse? What should he do? Take them and imprison them on Cybertron? Oh wait, he let Cybertron, his home, be destroyed to protect a perpetually ungrateful world. After alllll this, he would've looked like a chump for letting either Megatron or Sentinel live. Guaranteed they would try something again. Or, even worse, with Cybertron gone they just go full General Zod and decide to just kill everyone and everything completely because they have nothing left. So Optimus is a war criminal for finally having had enough and attempting to actually prevent anything like Chicago from ever happening again. Because a several million year old robot should defer to human laws when dealing with his own kind. That makes so much sense. People obviously know better than he does when it comes to dealing with Cybertronians. This is the stupidest argument. It's worse than the "should Batman just kill the Joker?" debate. The Joker can actually be incarcerated and won't live practically forever. And he plays a lot of murderous games. Megatron isn't playing games. His survival means genocide at the very least or even the actual apocalypse. And even then, he wasn't viciously outright killed by Prime until his third attempt. If this were real life (I know, I know) people would be dancing in the streets that Megatron and Sentinel were dead lol. The other (better) ending to Dark of the Moon works because Megatron shows his willingness to allow Optimus to kill him in a way that seems finally not like a trick. But the ending as is? Megatron is full of shit when he offers that truce. The fact that Optimus beheads him like that with one arm shows how much he must've been pulling his punches in the previous two. Especially the first one. Plus they both go through a few changes lulz. G1 Optimus is wonderful and I love him. But in a movie that's supposed to show a more "realistically" compassionate but battle hardened Prime, he cannot just keep forgiving and not ending this because the cartoon series doesn't have a harrowing body count for the Decepticons to answer for. And he would look like a completely ineffectual fool if he keeps choosing to not decisively do something about it. This comment brought to you by the slowest work day in the history  of fire or departments. Don't get me wrong though, I'm glad. It means no one's house is burning down..
certain decepticons have red energon in the movies, but most energon is green
Honestly the only thing it’s missing in terms of war crimes is liberty prime from wish throw nukes like they were foot balls and he was Tom Brady in his prime
I love how evil Optimus Prime becomes as the series progresses. By the fourth movie his first words are "I'll kill you!" While wildly trying to murder anyone within his grasps
I liked revenge of the fallen
I think Dark Knight is the most brutal PG-13 movie
big wang
Sam killing Starscream and "you'll always be sentinel's bitch" were basically the only two good moments in this movie.
This is another Mr.Z channel lol
Yeah and that Armstrong movie was AWFUL      not a fan of those kinds of movies
I remember seeing the transformers movie 1986 on DVD when I was four and my favourite character was jazz but then he died in transformers one
I love overly aggressive Optimus because it’s hilarious seeing one of the most noble characters ever put to fiction just becoming a fucking executioner
Yeah this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine and I like it too. Although I consider it a tale of two halves. The first half is awful and if I were to rate it, it’s an F. But the second half, right after the freeway chase, is awesome and fun, and I’d rate it a B-.
1:00
Yea mgk looks like he's the she in that relationship.
21:14
Can you review the other transformers movies?
When I saw Dark of the Moon I was SUPER disappointed because they just picked some random woman to play a hot mechanic.
The amount of times Bumblebee and Optimus names were yelled by Shia.:|
Something I checked really quickly: So DOTM was released in 2011. The WFC Game NOT that damn Netflix show was released in 2010. TF Prime also released in 2010, technically it was suppose to be a game continuation but we all know it's not really written like that.  Anyway, I do not write it to say anything special, just that 2010-2011 years of TF media saw a huge spike of absolutely brutal TF content. DOTM has everything that was shown in the video, WFC game had a fucking execution scene WW2 style and a slave camp level and allowed players to just kill prisoners to joy of Megatron personally (no freakin chill in that game god damn) and TF Prime for a kids show, had a lot of death and brutality to it. It's on the edge of being super edgy but somehow all these shows and games turned out to be either a great fun or really nicely written (well as long as you want to connect fun with war crimes of fictional race lmao)   I think that the franchise really got it's new life and best content when it took some of it's elements maybe even a bit too seriously, to the point where it became almost too real but at the same time it gained so much great stuff because of it. And maybe thanks to success of that media, we got stuff like MTMTE comic book, that despite having a lot of humor, is absolutely crazy when it comes to brutality and some serious topics (and they didn't disrespect them thankfully) and it's one of my favourite TF contents I saw so far. It also created a lot of fan favourite characters or versions of existing ones.   I think TF literally benefited from changing "war" to actual terribly close to human war which is some weird twisted dark humor fate and I can't get over it to this day.
Pls sir. Can we please have your thoughts on age of extinction? I wanna feel that pain.
0:34 Christopher stop laughing the poke é Mon you're in the mob.
I also loved First Man, you're not alone !
Lol
“They’re only war crimes if you lose” - Optimus Prime probably
I agree to optimus's killing of megatron. Megatron is a known genocidal villain who will do whatever he can to win and actually kill the autobots. Any kind of deal they make will be broken by megatron as soon as he gain sny kind of power. He killed or caused the deaths of many autobots and tons of humans. At this point the option that wont see him breaking the deal and going on a rampage means killing him.
Honestly, Optimus' actions were justified in my eyes, decepticons killed millions of people and thought they could get away with a cowardly "im sorry I surrender" and be spared ONLY because they were losing, if they were winning they would NOT hesitate to wipe out all the autobots - they deserved that head ripping scene and little me cheered when it happened LMAO
Are you that guy from alternate history hub?
I love the last third of this movie and had no idea the tilting building was a practical set. Easily one of the highlights of the final act and knowing that was real people really sliding to make that work is a treat. Thanks for the info
1:47 "Hey look! My credibility just withered and died." ... What credibility?
I have the same reaction to the 4th movie - it's bad but all my brain did was yell ROBOT GUN HEAD and ROBOT DINOSAUR
Transformers is basically Battlefield but with oversized toy robots.
I genuinely believed that was Patrick Swayze because I dony fucking remember that guy. Them my girlfriend made me watch dirty dancing and now I'm so fucking mad at you
I liked the movie but absolutely cannot forgive Michael Bay for how terrible Shockwave was used and killed. Most badass deceptacon and Shockwave gets killed like a goon
That boy ironhide got done dirty
Yep you are right
they took one look at the Geneva Convgention and said "HAH! Bet!"  but anyways, i liked this movie. the most likable moment to me was when Sam starts stomping his engine! it STILL has me rolling on the floor from laughter!
Ok but iridescent by Linkin park still goes so hard to this day
This was my favorite growing up
Ok hear me out…it’s cool  I actually like this movie.
My guilty pleasure.
You forgot to mention how Optimus kills the Fallen in the 2nd movie. He rips his face off his head and punches through his chest and crushes his spark in front of him….
They did ironhide dirty that was what angered me when I first watched this movie
Did anyone else see the dude that's on Fire in one of the wing suit scenes
16:58 “Oh no” *Ironhide getting shot*
I like thought-provoking movies, but sometimes you just want to see giant robots murder other giant robots
This video was the first time i saw Jeff Bezos with hair. thought it was a Cialou situation you know
Now that I think about it , they could’ve used Ironsides death as a way to fuel Optimus’s rage. Giving a reason as to why he killed Sentinel. “This is for ironhide” *BOOM* and then for megatron, “you were the reason behind this”   A perfect exavme is in the 4th movie when Optimus sees the people at KSI melting Ratchets head, he then goes in and fucks up the place.
“The idea a NASCAR robots driving around with machine guns make my American Soul sing”- A Wise American probably
I actually liked Dark Of The Moon. It wasn't afraid to kill mofos off make shit look hopeless. My exact kinda mood. I like watching main characters struggle against all odds.  Ofc some parts were silly (sorry haven't watched it in forever) but it had some good moments that were pretty worth sitting through it.
I still think it should of taken place in Detroit. I mean the AUTO capital.
Me who likes Tf 2💀💀💀
This may be a little old but that ending is also canon in the comics and tbh as a huge transformers nerd, I always found the whole Optumis/Megatron Backstory that was made for this continuity (Optimus being born Prime and Megatron being his Brother and Lord High Protector and both ruled Cybertron together) was a complete waste since it's only shown on the comics and went nowhere, I mean it's true Transformers was made to sale toys but since then there have been actual good media of it, like TF Prime animated series, the IDW Comics and finally that good Bumblebee movie, all worth your time if you feel robbed by Michael Bay like I did lol
I will always remember Dino as Michael bays self-own.
Honestly imo the worst part of this movie was how they killed ironhide
The wreckers are awesome. Crazy cool vehicle modes, iconic Scottish accents and they don't take nothin' from nobody. Some of my favorite transformers
NO OPTIMUS! PLEASE! FUCK! AAAAAA!
Movie optimus is a war criminal, and a fucking brutal one at that. But GODAMN sum if his line are badass.
Unpopular opinion: Michael Bay has the talent to be one of the greatest action directors ever, but doesn’t care about making good movies.  Although so many elements of his style is imitated by the biggest blockbusters ever since Transformers, that he can be argued to be one of the most influential action directors of our time.
Iridescent by Linkin Park is such a beautiful and emotional song that it made me convince myself that this movie was decent when I first watched it, just shows how great linkin park is
“what do you mean this movie is bad you can clearly see the giant robots fighting over there”
Why are people dogging on tf3???? It was amazing. You 12 year olds don’t know what makes a good film unless it’s crammed full of PC bs😂
When I was a kid that Ironhidedeath scene disturbed me
Can’t wait for Tf4 and tf5
After watching these videos I’ve become convinced that these movies would be better if they weren’t adaptations of Transformers. Undoubtedly less popular because of the lack of name recognition, but at least they wouldn’t be constrained by those silly names.
You know what they should’ve kept? The Original ending along with they could’ve add the wreckers being distracted with a Tv
"the Autobots are too human"  H  Have you never seen Transformers before...?
I love how magatrons foot just clips through the stairs 7:11
I mean the toys for this line are great
23:40 History is written by the victors
I need to rewatch AoE, TLK, and the spinoff Bumblebee next before the new Transformers. I don't remember any of the Transformers movies being bad. TF01, RotF, and DotM started good then slowly became shit, I hope I don't also find AoE and TLK and Bumblebee shit now that I have grown.
Bro I'm pretty sure "war laws" are different from ours if they even have any
I actually liked dark of the moon.
Two things, I too also REALLY enjoy Dark of The Moon, and The Ryan Gosling Apollo landing movie "First Man"
Come on guys, you are all acting like you never committed War crimes in the 90's
no one will ever make me stop watching the trilogy. absolute love for them. even with the imperfections i will rewatch it every year for the rest of my life
Those scenes from the g1 cartoons just hit me with untold levels of nostalgia
No matter how terrible the transformers movies may be, they’re my favorite and I will fight for Optimus any day
i'm part of the fandom that is like "i didnt grow up with g1 cuz that was... 30ish years ago??" like i loved the bayverse movies but hated the people but i hate people in every movie cuz there just there be dumb and stupid self insert waste of space so eh- thoe i guess i did have a nightmare of bayverse bumble-bee which kinda drove me away from liking bumblebee as a character cuz that shit still lives in my head rent free- so hek funi yellow boi
Dark of the Moon marked the start of my teenage years and I really like this movie, there was this console game with the same title that explained what is happening before the movie and it’s fing great
This is great and all but I honestly the best part of this whole video is the music from the Toy Story 2 video game.
Might I add that Speilberg being the reason why Megan Fox was fired SHOULD NOT be a surprise? Remember, Speilberg is a hardcore passionate Jew who is known for directing Schindler's List and Munich. He is also known during and after the Amblin Animation years to be a big-boy producer. And by "big boy" I mean he is now known for holding producer credits more than director credits.
I’ll always think 3 is the best, followed by 1, 2, 5 and the shit that was 4
But the movie on point for the comic or cartoon
Great vid, just stumbled upon this in recommended. New sub, can't wait to see the rest of your stuff.
your voice is like exactly in between charlie and crendor 👀
7:05
These movies are kinda like Nickleback, everyone talks about how bad they are, but if it's playing on the radio they sing along. I get these movie are "objectively" bad, but part of me can't help but enjoy them. Just don't think to hard about what your watching and you'll have a good time haha.
I think you forgot about the g1 movie where a lot of fan favorite characters were killed off in one scene including the big OP.
Optimus isn’t a war criminal. He executes War Criminals.
Wanna talk about a PG 13 movie pushing its limits?!? Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom is a perfect example!!!
Is this alternate history hub?
Cool fights are cool fights that’s why I liked all the movies
It’s the most entertaining of the three It’s not as good or well written as one, but it’s the epitome of big cgi violence for theaters
Fun fact hydraulic fluid is red
You already know buzz was in that studio sweating bullets trying to remember what he really saw that he wasn't supposed to talk about and what his lines were
Can’t wait for your transformers 4 review would like to know your thoughts on it, in my opinion I loved it
First man is one of my all time fav movies as well as its soundtrack being in my all time favs.
what was with that pikachu in that live-action thing you showed? it looked more like a malformed frog than a rat.
Why did you call him Patric Shwayze
Wasn’t it call dark side of the moon or am I tripping
how can people not like this movie it’s amazing
In my opinion, age of extonction is teh best movie. It actually has the characters act like the og versions. And optimus doesn't fucking exicute his enimies. And damn bitchwicky isn't in it.
4:48 I completely forgot about that scene. Fuck, I shouldn't have laughed that hard
This movie was so good
Optimus Prime's savagery is absoluttly justified(even he is out character)  While decepticons doing genocide that almost took over millon human lifes.
*looks around* I liked revenge of the fallen!
Conspiracy part: how would they know? That ,,fuel rod“ was in Russia the whole time and no one that remembers it was still alive (propably).  It wasn’t the Apollo guys that took it? Or am I getting something wrong here?
I remember when I was watching this movie it was cool, but it also made me sad because it showed prime as a monster  most interpretations of transformers. Optimus prime doesn’t really kill and usually does everything in his power to not have to fight, unless it’s absolutely necessary and it just made me kind of shitty that all he was doing was straight up murdering Deceptacon’s and it’s only in the bay movies Optimus kills a lot
War crimes. Yum.
XD
I became a TF fan because of the 2007 movie...but damn, these movies are just terrible and really could have been so rich with story.  And I completely agree, and have been saying for years,  about how the Bots and Cons don't look like the same race.  The Cons are drooling, large clawed, evil animals and the Bots are radically different.  That alone took away from the movies.  What a wasted opportunity these Transformers movies were.
I loved the original three movies and idc but I do have to agree the war crimes and  Makayla stupid as Well Stupid.
Hanoi dam toi Pham chien Tranh. Tan cong de Xoa so ngay. Giai phong Hanoi ngay. LENH ROI.
It is beyond depressing this series kept making so much money. So more and more trash kept being made. Nobody is keeping these on a shelf and asking friends to watch it.
I never thought that Optimus was Serbian? Damn.
Well the reason it didn’t end peacefully is because the producers were just money hungry for more movies, to be cash cows. Plus the mark walberg movies are just awful! The designs of the bots went downhill, Nicola Peltz is just like Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely, wooden. Writing is just WHY? Haven’t really taken an interest in the newer Transformers films, one cos John Dena’s in it, well what doesn’t have John Cena or Dwayne Johnson in? Just seems boring
Wow, literally people getting offended by literally anything. Why don’t we just learn nothing? Cos to teach morals you have to have an example to show why to.
I know you didn't program It but...video about the last 2 movies when?
A Note About The Original Ending:  Theorymus (Trans Theories) had made a video explaining what happened with the so I’ll go on what I know, include what he said.  Originally, Micheal Bay wanted the movie to end with Optimus Prime and Megatron ending their war, and agreeing to join forces to allow Cybertron to be rebuilt. But, there were two factors that stopped this plan:  1. The Novel: The Novelization was released pre-maturely, and thus *spoiled* the ending of the movie! Because of this, not only was the ending changed to compensate, but no other novelizations of the remaining movies (AOE and TLK) were ever made!  2. Executives: If what happened in DOTM didn’t say enough, Micheal Bay was *done* with the Transformers movies after three in a row, and wanted to move on. But, along with the Novel Incident, Paramount *demanded* that more movies would be made. As a result both AOE and TLK seemed to have a sense of hatred in it, as Optimus was kinda out of character, and how the humans weren’t so forgiving.  That’s basically what happened to the original ending! Thank you for reading!
i loved transformers dark of the moon but hated the ending, i hate that the original ending got leaked and the script changed.
As someone ho has a semilar story to his cuz i started wif Live action but idk wat say.
Dark of the moon is probably my favorite because it doesn't involves humans too much and mainly fighting.   Edit: Tho is maybe a bit too violent. Maybe...
22:08 He was a traitor, he did not surrender, optimus did not pass him and he was not taken as a POW. Considering all of that, it was a fully legal killing. On top of that I don't remember any cybertronian signing any treaty up until this point.  22:38 That is dishonest towards this scene. It wasn't even a truce. Megatron hoped that the Optimus will join him once that red piece of shit was dead. And they BOTH were ready to fight then and there. Optimus is just faster than Megatron.  23:02 I already said why what happened here was legal and was not an execution.  23:06 That would have been better, I think.  23:47 Not that he was much if any better at that point.
17:15 is megatrons wheel on his foot clipping through the step? Lol
"Geneva conventions work only for humans"
I would argue kong skull island is what pushed pg-13, I thought that movie was R when I was done until I saw the info
I liked it 🥲
It’s also inferred that the engine part sphere was what started Chernobyl
I kinda liked it too.
Steven is a Jew
ok, so I've seen every tf movie opening night except the last night  and when optimus prime killed sentinel, probably angered me the most  OPTIMUS PRIME DOESN'T DOUBLE TAP DEFENSELESS BOTS
I always liked this version of optumis not as much as g1 or prime show but I kind of understand they were going for an optumis who was more emotional which in my head canon is why he got more brutal and in the first movie as well as the movie tie in comics optumis gave megatron thousands of chances to show his brother wasn't a complete monster then the third movie kicks in and optumis has lost thousands of his Comrades and people because he tried to reason with his former brother in arms which he thinks he got killed plus he lost his mentor to megatron and when megatron said who would you be without me prime I think optumis was done giving chances so he became foe vicious and blood thirsty to keep his family the autobots alive as well as the humans he tried to protect always felt like he was suffering form a form of ptsd but  that's only a theory
Fun fact: I watched this movie for the first time in Costa Rica (I’m Canadian 🇨🇦)
I love the first 3 movies so much! My glasses are rosy af but idc
7:52 that one part in aliens when the queen just absolutely rips Bishop in half, they couldn't get away with that with one of the crewmates lol
I’m still sick on how they killed ironide
Oh my fuck, I died when you mentioned that they were fascists😂
this is literally the only Transformers movie i liked lol. I hated the first 2, and the 2 after this
Everything before Bumblebee should've been rated R
There is nothing to like about the ones that came before the Bumblebee movie
The first minute of this video has to be one (if not) the best intros I’ve seen in a video.
Looking through the chapters War crime prime? Probably nothing true (EEEEEEEEE) Edit: 20:44 I am not American but do find it cool
20:32  Intimidate lowers attack
15:02 dude shockwave is an awesome name
Just hearing Optimus drop an empty shell then you hear the *DUNDUNDUN* " We will kill them all!"
I Rewatch first man every few years
I liked the new movies
This movie is amazing imo
Hm, I've never seen revenge of the fallen, but I actually liked Age of Extinction quite a bit( though it is still kind of trashy), is it really worse than revenge of the fallen?
Great analysis on this film. Also what is the name of the music you use for this time card 21:15.
3:34 who's that?
change my mind it was all good
I hope PointlessHub continues on to Bumblebee 2018
damn now i wanna play halo 2 I CANT ESCAPE
So it wasn't just me who felt the decipticons look unimaginative and very much the same dull colour.  12:43 I remember that movie and I watched it in the cinema. I didn't really like it.  As a young teenager (target demographic), the wreckers and dreads were my favourite.  The third movie was my favourite in the series, most likely because of the fighting at the end and all the eye candy.  Best Megatron design as well.
I wish they finished it off w Mikeala, she was a fucking badass, like not just a side piece for Sam to hook up w, she was an acc character who had acc shit to do in the film. Carly was aight, but mikeala>
as a young teenage girl i was absolutely obssessed with these three movies. i must have watched them over 50 times xD My fave transformers thing is still transformers prime though
Actually because of how they progressed with the lore, the second movie makes more sense than the third one for me..
Me being an Ohioan on the farthest reaches of the ohio river my big city is Pittsburgh
Optimus started as masterchief then became doomguy
This review isn’t enough to make me think the movie wasn’t awesome, even Mr wang
8:13 its not blood,its red energon 😆😆
You say dark of the moon is nostalgic you you man age of extinction is my favorite transformers movie cause i loved that movie as a kid it was just beautiful I find that movie nostalgic
I think Transformers dotm is a good movie
Yet Megan fox was on another Michael Bay film ........the 2014 ninja turtle movie
They can turn in to spaceship to get the pillars.the plan hinged on someone reviving sentinel using the matrix not specifically Prime. The army of robots came to get Sentinel,not knowing that he was working for them and they crashed into the moon and went into cryosleep
16:06 they also landed on the moon
8:13 its not blood, its red energon
I think you should gain some credibility for admitting to enjoy this movie, because you know how you're not allowed to enjoy anything these days...
Ironhide dying still the worst thing to happen. Him and hound would’ve been a deadly combo
Those are the days Transformers and Fast and Furious go side by side during the summer release in theaters
The halo music in this video gave me mad nostalgia
Fun Fact: The voice of optimus Peter Cullen didn't want to say the line, " We will kill them all." Because he says Optimus wouldn't say that. But Michael Bay told him in an angry tone, too, " Just say the damn line."
Aren‘t you Cody from AlternateHistoryHub?
All of the movies are good yall giving too much criticism
Pls make transformers 4 reveiw
By the final battle Prime was just pissed off at everything 🤣🤣🤣 he’s like “ight time to be a war criminal”
Great analysis
Truly a movie of all time
ok so you like dark of the moon because of megan fox, got it
The way this movie was *supposed* to end is much better, and I'm gunna pretend it did end like that now.
To be fair, to this day it's sill one of my favourite movies. I never really understood the hate it got. Tf5 is propably the only one of the 5 that i actually dislicked, tho it's still fun to watch despite being dumb
Good ol' Optimus "we will kill them all" Prime.
Space conspiracy about the dark side of the moon? Hey, that reminds me of that one B-movie where moon nazis invade earth. Though that's pretty silly though. Good thing Transformers would never reference nazi germany ...Yeah, that'd be pretty silly if they did
Here me out, this movie is so good, it’s bad. Does that make it in unenjoyable? Not at all. Let me explain. It’s the complete opposite of movies like the Room. Some movies try to be outstanding and touch a deep base, and only succeed in making fools out of themselves. Transformers 3 could have been a movie touching on serious themes, but instead it basically threw plot out the window except the pieces of plot meant to hold it together just enough to lead to a bunch of fight scenes. Everyone loves action, or at least a vast majority of people do, and that’s how tf3 entertains its audience. Instead of trying to show people thematic views or send a message, it entertains people by giving us exactly what we really want, basically giving us the bare minimum but giving us so much of it that it’s able to hold its own: explosions and giant robot fights sprinkled throughout an hour and then just for an hour straight. Yet that kind of bare bones movie structure doesn’t sit so well with critics, despite its entertainment value. Which is why I believe this film is in fact, so good that it’s bad. It’s not meant to be intellectually entertaining at all. If you go into this movie expecting something groundbreaking, you’ll be sorely disappointed, but if you go in with your brain on sleep mode and treat it like a wrestling match, you’ll have the funnest time ever in your life, you won’t get even close to the same fun experience out of any other movie.    This is deadass my favorite movie ever 💀
I just hate how weak they made Shockwave. Such a badass modern design
Age of Extinction when?
"NO OPTIMUS- AUERÆAAAGh" is forever engrained into my mind
TOM JONES
“I’m An InVeNtOr” 😂
Dude, I liked all of the movies, story wise they were meh, but the violence was dope.
The movie had one of the best lines: Optimus: You have no soul! Galvatron: That's why I have no fear! You know Megatron waited millions of years to say that line and he finally got the chance. Edit: I just realized I'm remembering the wrong movie
Also what happened to the Matrix of Leadership with the power or reviving dead Transformers after this movie
i had nightmares when i was a kid after watching dark of the moon :v
Dark of the moon is Top 3 of my fav movies of all time
Me and the homies love this movie
DOFM was probably the second worst transformers movie and yes this is my opinion I think AOE was better, DOFM was just war crimes and blood (which is actually oil for some reason) it just turned into a james bond movie with crappy scripting and bad deaths.
Yall so sensitive.
Unionized labor is always to blame for everything.
Do number 4 next
I honestly don’t mind the first 3 movies. They’re golden to me, even ROTF. Dark of the Moon, while dark and more violent, is perhaps, the BEST of the live action movies.
I lost it at the Albert Einstein part
Megan Foxes replacement killed the entire movie for me. IF she wasn't in the movie it would've been 10x better
my own little theory for why Prime got darker as the films went on: Prime has reached his breaking point. 4 million years of war on cybertron, then another 5 on earth, even for a species of robots like the Transformers, im sure that amount of time of war would turn the most defensive, into the most brutal. does this make any sense? HELL NO. but neither does the writing for this movie at times
These films was made for 13 year olds who likes nothing but constant violence
We all know that scene where Sam just kicks the crap out of his datsun 510 is cinema gold. Best part in the whole movie.
"....from Obama? well in this company we are most from....Republicans"" Literally  todays former Twitter  employee  new job interview 🤣
Anyone who hates on DOTM is a film nerd who thinks they are better than everyone cause they have to disect every little part of a movie instead of just enjoying it. DOTM is extremely entertaining, and the office scenes are some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in a movie.
Disagree on Optimus being a war criminal.  ​He was easy on the decepticons first, then Chicago was invaded resulting tens of thousands dead all because his mentor, who he looked up to betrayed him.  This horror, forced Optimus to change, no more nice guy. He had to adapt to end it once and for all, the same way humans adapt.
The shockwave scene with the worm triggered my sister's heart murmur when we saw it in theaters 😂
I think primes badass lethal finishes are awesome
you guys cared about the plot? i just wanted to see cool robots blowing each others up in cool robots fight in a movie 10/10 would watch again
Optimus: Freedon is the right of  all sentient beings  Also Optimus: "Give me Your Face"
TF3 is the most accurate media depiction of Chicago I’ve ever seen. Most Hollywood productions set there usually just gloss over the brutal street violence, executions and war crimes that the city is so well loved for. It’s nice to finally see the city’s culture adapted to the big screen
You clearly don’t understand the lore, Megatron had this plan before the first movie 😑.
Actually thats just red energon, theres also green energon its honesly a stupid plot point in the bayverse
ITs actually my favorite Bay Transformers movie lol
At 19:55 I get a battlefield 2042 vibe or maybe it was 19:54
Rip Ironhide at 17:08 that scene made me sad when I was watching this movie
"If the Balrog was called Wing-master." I laughed way too hard.
7:05 bro thinks he Walter White 💀
Sam witwiki still 100 times better than mark’s character
I personally enjoyed every transformers film except for 2017's "The Last Knight"
I hold this movie in a special place as an interesting conversation piece about when I left the movie theater mid-screening as a kid
Gotta give it to Michael Bay, he made the Decepticons some brutal SOBs. But, one of my favorite Autobot designs in this film was Dino/Mirage. He looked sleek as hell with his twin blades! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
11:10 maan I fuckin die of laugh at this point
I absolutely loved the first 4 minutes of DofTM and the Buzz Aldrin part.
you use spyro music in the background your cool
Ngl almost walked out of the theater when they just annihilated Ironhide like that. Why couldn't they just execute the rando new autobot like they do every movie thus far? Lmao
To add on to Cody's point about Pokemon in the beginning: Just like Simpsons, I wish Pokemon would just end already. It had decades of success but now its just dragging on and on. End it please, Nintendo.
Optimus went from. I'd prefer not to fight  To Fuck around and find outimus prime
Mean while with Shia Labeouf man completely turn into a man by converting to Catholicism. I think all those sexual scene made him rethink about his life.
Pokémon Snap was Lowkey Fire Game.  I got a sick picture 📸 of Mew!
Glorifying the military is a good thing
Ever considering doing war crimes for warhammer 40K?
" hurghhh, noo muh space robot alien commited wur crimzz! How could they!?!" bro i don't think they signed the geneva convention ....
The transformers 2 and 3 is the best for me
I like the first three Transformers movies. Anything beyond that leaves me mildly satisfied but scratching my head.
people often detract optimuses brutality in the live action films but given the decepticons killing almost all of his friends and family and moreover his own mentor betraying said remaining friends and family can well stress the limits of ones morality
please talk about wide load
Unpopular opinion: the 2nd and 5th transformers movies are my preferred but not favourite
Personally this is my favorite of the transformers movies soooo
dark of the moon is ma fav cus i was cool . but i have no other reason other i loved how dark it was ha dark
Can Transformers just be like the Godzilla movies? People don’t go for plot, just to see badass shit happen.
I love this this is funny af LMAO basically sums up the movie in a nutshell
i love this movie, and i dont know why...
eh I'm different Dark of the moon was my favorite
That subway car scene is insane for pg-13
I remember when they were shooting scenes at the Calatrava art museum in Milwaukee back in July 2010. For those who don’t know it was used as the showroom that Patrick Dempsey owned and Sam’s girlfriend worked at. I remember seeing Shia, Rosie and Patrick and I actually got to meet them and take a picture with them since they shot the scenes around the time of my birthday and one of the production crew members was a friend of my parents. Somewhere in my house there’s a picture of me posing with Shia and Patrick with that yellow Datsun he drove in the movie.
chockwave is sick.I allways have loved him.
F in the chat for ironhide
Best film they ever made idc 2011 Damnn time flys I swear !!!!
It’s funny how when I was a teenager I too loved this movie! But now I’m 28 and find it pretty awful.
The only good transformers movie was the first one
For the NASCAR transformers I'm just imagining the team personnel coming in in the morning and finding out the cars they were preparing were now giant robots making fart jokes in the back.
I'm going to go watch transformers prime to cleanse my dark soul, see you guys at the next video
The fucking Toy Story 2 music sent me on a nostalgia trip
I kinda liked this movie what i hated was one detail im the cgi that i couldnt remove from my head when, if im not mistaken, there's one scene where the top of a building explodes and when the fire goes out the building is intact lol
The minute intro made me completely forget what the video was about for a second.😭😭
I don’t care whoever say transformer 1 and 3 are the best out of all the movies
I feel cheated I would have loved the original ending where they end with a peace deal
bro this movie is fire 9 year old me thought this was a great movie
I was watching this and I noticed you put in a song from halo 2 in the background and it got me really excited, because I love that song.
About Prime's attitude, there is even a line that can be translated as "If you watch carefully, you'll get that the Megatron was right" in a rap song of one of the most known rappers in my country.  Bayverse has written in a way that anybody can have different opinions about who are the real good guys, it was about perspective, which I liked.
People forget the 1986 movie. Ironhide gets executed point blank, and thats after you watch Ratchet and Prowl go down with smoke pouring from their mouths and gaping holes in them. Also Brawn gets a booboo on his shoulder?
Megatron planned to bring Sentential back by using Optimus who didn't even have the means to bring him back until he got the Matrix of Leadership.
I am very confused.   I could have sworn that I watched this movie in theaters, but based off of the clips, I could swear that I haven't seen this movie.  Ken Jeong was in a Transformers, what?  But then I remember Megatron shooting the Lincoln memorial, so I don't know.  Lol
Remember back in the days if u owned a transformers toy u used to be a cool kid
warcrimes? your clickbait has worked
this movie is awful but it also goes so hard in so many places
Hell yeah, Cloud Temple from Spyro 2.
I think the "blood" is just lubricants
Love the nfl theme haha
Even to exaggerate your point, you kinda gloss over how bonecrusher was beheaded and Jazz ripped in two in TF1,  among other examples from TF2. I love this brutal take on transformers
Reading the lines from the text, is so entertaining to read it feels like your watching the movie
Transformers 3 let's you watch Eyore from Winnie the Pooh execute Mr Spok as he pleads for mercy
I fucking love this movie.
PLs do a similar video for transformers 4 and 5  in preparation for 6 PLSSSSSSSSS
I liked it 2
Looking through these comments and seeing all of the times people very clearly meant to write “Decepticons” but it was autocorrected to “deceptions” is really amusing… autocorrect is sabotaging the Decepticons, and all I can think of is “AUTOCORRECT, ROLL OUT!”
I still enjoy the mindless action in these films, taking in account the garbage writing etc it’s great fun. Also Optimus Prime always delivers and saves the day, yes he’s a ruthless war crime killer but man he does it like a bad ass. We aren’t getting our main hero subverted or given the Luke skywalker treatment.
The blood be transmission fluid😂…   Joking obviously
Trans theories
I never thought I’d say this but I’m really starting to miss the grittiness of this era of movies and games
that intro was top tier
I would make the argument that these movies don’t glorify the military industrial complex nearly enough. Their portrayal of the military is flat out unrealistic sometimes, and I’d argue they’re extremely underpowered as well. All hail NATO, bringer of freedom! Operation Cybertron Storm will commence shortly.
One thing I hate about Carly replacing Mikaela is that she replaced her, instead of the Meghan Fox being recasted by Carly’s actress
You are now my favorite YouTuber!
This movie is a fever dream. In the 80’s show, the Decepticons were actually very polite to human stuff. Megatron instead of shooting Lincoln off the seat actually picks him up and sets him gently down before sitting. Also why do the cons all look like bugs? Seriously Bumblebee and Rise of the Beasts are so much better and one of the two hasn’t even come out yet lol
Oh man we were robbed of the original awesome ending!
I hate Ehren Kruger and I’m so glad someone else with a brain realizes he’s an integral part to all the fuckery
The 1st 3 transformers movies are the best ones. Really enjoyed this movie when it came out and still do to this day
This one was my favorite of the three ad a kid but idk I guess cause it had so much awesome action but hey I enjoyed all 3 as a kid but I definitely see why people don’t like them.  But 4 and 5 are probably some of the worst movies I have ever seen like how do you make a transformers movie boring but they did
I have a soft spot for the transformers films
9:29 why is there no cheese on it?
Imo every transformer movie is great i dont get why so many people hate on them
I think I was more disappointed by hot rod than anything
Micheal Bat doesnt give a fuck about story telling
the ''blood'' from the transformers is red energon, there are multiple different colors of energon, Trans Theories made a video about that
So many questions, so little time
okay okay age of extinction wasn't that bad
Jeff Bezos: “If you don’t know what Pokémon is… hehe… you’re a fucking smoothbrained lobotomite who doesn’t deserve to breathe the same precious air as us cultured folks. And I’m starting a rocket company in 10 years to send y’all to a place where you can continue to live under your rock” is what he probably was gonna say
I mean we need more robot war films. Look at Japan, they basically built the anime industry off robot war dramas
Pokemon was one of those things that it was sucked dry for content and just…way too much content. Like spongebob. Should have ended after alola and I didn’t even like alola
I grew up on this shit
People: Optimus is a psychopath cus' he killed two people  The people:   Space Hitler.  And the guy who wanted to slave the whole world and joined Space Hitler
I like to think that their "blood" is actually just transmission fluid
18:34 couldn’t have said it better
as a chicagoan I'm offended on behalf of all of us that Michael Bay pulled us into this
Ayo Spyro music in the background, nice!
This movie is the last time we got good transformer toys
If y'all didn't know now u know
I found the only good part about the age of you know is lockdown
I dont care what everyone says, new designs are fucking cool, apart from transformers faces
8:04 Wrong that's not blood its transmission oil.
Will be waiting for Transformers Extinction video 😆👍👍
I loved that worm thing too.
15:40 An Astronomers Biggest Nightmare... Buzz Aldrin was done Dirty 😂😂😂😂
I liked how finally someone Knows Cybertronic Stuff 8:10 😂😂😂
Makes since why this movie did get a lot of screen time on TV.
Wait, is this the Alternate History Hub guy?
I actually love this movie, not a guilty pleasure, but straight up love this movie, the designs (this is my favorite megatron design), the story is massive and pretty well done (better than rotf, aoe and tlk) and it felt like there were real stakes, the characters were fine (still better than everything after) the only thing I dont like about this movie, is the ending, I much prefer the original ending
Listen movies 1,2,3 are good! revenge of the fallen is the best in my opinion ik prime was dead for most of the movie. but Come on he took on star scream Megatron and that big ass mf.😂shit was sick then he comes back to life cause Sam’s a goat then gets new parts and flys like bruh shit was crazy
Bumblebee movie next ?
PointlessHub are you G.I. Joe fan?
I will say the original animated transformers movie was way more dark, crass, depressing. Optimus literally dies along with a bunch of other transformers.
Is anyone going to explain why Sentinel has a Gundam v-fin?
Can I say something? Dark of the Moon, got an oscar nomination... For sound and graphics. No I'm not kidding. This alone makes it the best transformers movie.  Everyone's ranking: 1. DotM 2. TF1 3. RotF 4. AoE 5. TLK My ranking: 1. TLK 2. DotM 3. TF1 4. AoE 5. RotF (I all like these)
Optimus had been optimus for 9 million years in cybertron even during the war Stayed a few years in earth and turned into a war criminal What earth and humanity does to a mf
So out of all the movies it is my favorite.
Optimus: All life matters Seconds Later: Murders everyone and everything in sight.
The Transformer movies are like a lot of "action" movies. No need to try to apply logic to the "story" or really think about it. Get a beer, some popcorn or chips and snuggle up to your sweetie. Switch your brain off and just enjoy.
Iridescent slaps. greatest song of all time.
Patrick Dempsey* jeez lol
I actually really enjoy all of the Transformers films, including 4 and 5. Yeah they ain't great by any means, but I still enjoy them.
Cant wait for you to cover the movies that made this trilogy good by comparison
Bruh spitting undeniable shit
Tbf, that bird deceptacon tells Megatron the Autobots fell for the trap, implying that the deceptacons got the fuel rod and not the soviets themselves
"Unmanned"
I actually liked revenge of the fallen
I totally forgot that Sentinel got JFKed at the end lmao
Me like robots killing each other
I unironically loved Dark of the Moon  17:48 we've seen at least Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, and Optimus capable of maneuvering in space without a ship.
I think you mean to say, the best one
Hope fully pointless keeps making a transformers movie video every 2 months until we reach rise of the beasts
This movie made 1.124 billion dollars in the box office. LMAO! I know it wasn't recieved well even though they made a lot of money. I still love this movie for the fight scenes. The fight scenes were peak cinematic history.
This review is just a wordly cinema sins.
I will admit when DoTM first dropped I liked it. My pre adult brain considered this a good end to the trilogy and a “strong” film. Had me look to AoE with anticipation 😐
I like the transformers movies…there not good movies though.
It’ll be a cold day in hell when I don’t laugh at a “SPHERICAL!” joke
I love how in the first movie they changed Ratchet and Ironhide from red to green and black because of how it’d mess with the cameras they were using, but for Sentinel, who’s blue and orange, they just decide to make him all red; like what?! 😂
17:16 is it me or is megatron’s left bottom wheel clipping into the steps
I'd like to think that this was the true ending of the franchise and the others were either side stories or in a parallel universe.
I kind of like Optimus as an executioner.  If we'd adopt that mindset for killers and pedo's it would be a better America.
"My credibility withered and died" Man, like, come on, you know this is a safe take. Everyone says the same thing: The 3rd movie is the 2nd best out of all of them.
To me Cloverfield pushed the limits of a PG-13
I love transformers it’s just mindless alien robot fights. I don’t care if it’s corny or badly written as long as there are many explosions and guns. If I want a good story with great writing I look somewhere else
I love this movie so goddamn much. The first half is total fucking garbage but if you power through it you get rewarded with the most amazing action sequences ever seen in a blockbuster. The scene with the skyscraper falling down or the fight between Sam and Starscream are insanely good.
One issue is that optimus prime wouldn't and shouldn't be the one to send cybertron into the oblivion. He WAS the bot to press that button to bring cybertron into earth orbit in the ultimate doom part 1. Maybe, after 25 years, he realized that wasn't the right choice. Maybe.
I've never noticed this before, but at 17:17 the wheels on Megatron's feet are clipping right through the stairs. Great vid though, TF really did drop off after DOTM.
Can't wait for 4 and 5 (Maybe, please)
Look, i know nothing about actual transformers lore. I was a kid when these movies came out, and it was just fucking awesome to watch the giant robots rip eachother apart. Despite the shitty plot these movies might have, its still fucking awesome to watch
Was that “dog scene” real?…
To those who don’t know: The original script of DOTM was unused since it was the only script for the film at the time, novel writers and IDW Comics used this script to write the books. So Bay found the script now worthless since many people would already know everything about the story, that’s why he rewrote the script to make audiences expect something new. This was also the reason why AOE and TLK had no tie in comics or novelizations were released coz Bay didn’t want to show spoilers.
8:50  One major exception to this is the start of TF1. Truly a brutal scene of devastation from Blackout
I do be liking this movie since it came out. I don't have any knowledge of the original series, so, to me, Optimus is fucking hot rod robotruck John Rambo.
I don’t know if anyone else mentioned it, but there was gonna be a little side plot about Shockwave actually being a bunch of clones the Autobots had to kill . (And Shockwave would really be on Cybertron or something).
RIP IRONHIDE
spyro 2 music anyone?
So for Megatrons plan, I think a fairly logical line can be threaded through the first three films into one larger master plan. Basically all three mcguffins the allspark, the harvester and the pillars were all required to rebuild and restore cybertron under deception rule. The pillars could bring cybertron to earth so humans could be slaves, the harvester would allow them to harvest our sun into energon, and the all spark would create megatrons new army. So he could have a fully powered and staffed cybertron all under his rule. What happened in dark of the moon wasn’t at all the original deal made between sentinel and megatron. Megatron said that he and sentinel were going to meet on earth before “Fate lay waste to us both” meaning when he was frozen in ice and sentinel crashed on the moon. As for why he didn’t activate the army hidden on the moon, that I don’t know
Okay but whats up with the CGI on the wheels/staircase at 17:14?
Well, look at everything that happened to Optimus. I'm on his side, no mercy, no honor, kill those motherf*. Kill them real good.
Whats so wrong with age of extinction
I feel if we had to rank the first 3, it’d be 1,3, and then 2
Intimidate lowers the attack stat actually xD
Pg-13 pushed, a little man BEOWULF wishes to contend for that spot. People forget that movie was PG-13 😂
Oh yeah also remember they literally start bleeding red blood now in this movie. Guessing they where pushig it. Lol totally speaks how auto bots look way too human has beard and hair suppose to be was so weird... Even my grandma question it they have hair now
Remember watching this in theaters as a teen. One thing bother me it was so obvious that no talks about how so called calry went up to talk smash about how megatron has fallen right there and then like she knew him all this years it was obvious it was suppose to be megan fox character talking megatron to convince him his a btch second to sentinel prime. But this random carky replacement act like he knew megatron from all this years. It was out of place
Titanic was of 13
the movies are so amazingly generic i still can't tell which is which
I hate to be that guy, but technically the decepticons were the rebels, autobots were enslaving them and has them living in segregated cities to work all the tough shitty jobs
What the hell do you mean she was Michaela? Holy hell i rember being so confused back in the day.
Transformers might be the worst series with 6? 7? movies in it. But something about seeing big cool looking robots fight each other will also make me forget about all the awful writing or horrible scenes in them. It will forever be the series im ashamed i love so much
I'll be honest I loved how dark the Dark of the moon was.  I remember as an early teen seeing the movie with my uncle and just being mind blown seeing humans being disintegrated on screen, like they actually show how viscious a war would be
[This comment contained many errors... The People's Republic of China corrected this mistake.]
First Man is kino. I'm there with you in the box, my friend.
PG13 at theatres but have u heard what’s on the damn radio F R EAKKKK
The weird problem with Bayverse Optimus Prime is that usually when Prime does kill someone is not in a savage way, and it takes time for him to see that an enemy is beyond saving. Plus in TF media Optimus Prime and Megatron have made peace before despite the horrible stuff he did, its war and sometimes people become Grey Characters. Bayverse keeps putting Optimus in situations where he's ignoring the plead of a enemy, and slowly aims his weapon at them like a psychopath. And please don't give me the "Well you see in each movies he's being push more and more to the edge." Bay and his writers aren't that smart.
I liked the second movie tho lol i used to watch him and speed racer, both, one after the other and it was amazing.
you people are the type to say Tolkien is the worst writer because "the eagles could've taken them."
I don’t know why I loved the original 3 probably because of nostalgia but there still great to me
I remember watching the movie and think. This is fucking dark.
Revenge of the fallen was a good movie
15:40 Although having Peter Cullen as Optimus say "the honour is mine" is probably one of the greatest forms of respect ever devised.
I will say that Bayformers Ravage and Laserbeak are probably the best-designed Bayformers. But 90% of the competency of the Decepticons in G1 was wrapped up in Soundwave and his team, and Bay just never showed us that. Not to mention how much Soundwave's design sucks in these. Megatron trusted Soundwave to hold him in his alt-form most of the time, he was always the one who brought the useful intel, and he wasn't half-bad in direct combat either, even without help from the Mini-Cassettes. Also it's super cute how when Megatron gets back from Cybertron Laserbeak immediately flies to his wrist. Makes me think that despite the cartoon evil the Decepticons display that they're not just evil evil bad bad _all_ the time. That and the fact that it sort of sounds like Soundwave's joining in on the opening theme. EDIT: ALSO I forgot that _Soundwave pets Ravage_ in the G1 cartoon AWWW
8:15 i believe the "blood" was intended to be oil of some kind
Imop the three movies are perfections
Couldn’t they just literally recast Mikela? If the new love interest literally says the same lines Megan fox would say why not just put a different actress in the same role. Movies to that in sequels. It was dumbthat Makela dump sam cuz she was tired of the transformers or something when in the last movie they established a good relationship. Oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
Sentinel shot Ironhide behind his back: ok Sentinel almost kills optimus, ignoring his "please": ok Optimus ignores Sentinel's "please" and kills him: Optimus the war criminal
first ever video i see from this guy and its an instant classic, subscribed
2:55 🎉
Big ups for using Spyro music in this
Someone's been playing Tekken 1
Gotta love watching this and getting the new transformers movie trailer
"...we even have fasc- oh wait, uh... Decepticon collaborators" killed me
3:34 Narrator: It was not because of unionized labor
That lead in was uh... something alright.
yeah lets face it nobdy cared for the story its all about the cool explosive
The best Transformer movie is Transfomers Age of Extinction
that intro was straight outta your other channel lmao
Why do people act like someone gonna kill them if they admit to liking a Michael bay transformers film, weird…
18:15-18:22 Megatron awakens, thinks the all spark can revive Sentinel so he wants to get that however, he dies, founds out the allspark is gone, decides humankind is horrible and wants to kill them, then use the planet as a battle ground, however that plan is also foiled, now he knows Optimus has the matrix so he's gotta wait till Optimus revives Sentinel for his plan to go into motion, which is why he didn't use his army for the first and second movie, because those two movies were not his original plans for the Autobots, it was always Sentinel.
This movie still good, I grew up w this trilogy so I have some bias, but I did not like Carly's rushed character, you hit the nail on the head w that one
Bro I like these movies even if most don't. I thought it was exciting and entertaining. Yes the humans are too focused on but still a good movie. The characters could have had better designs and I wish the human characters weren't so focused on and the transformers had more back story to them. like i wish we had a movie even if it was animated, I wish we had a movie about the war on cybertron. that would be so cool.
So much for the Geneva convention, Optimus. LOL!
Idk why y'all G1 purist wants the movies to be kid friendly and soft lol. The movies are supposed to feel realistic not like 80s kids cartoon. And those "polygons" design was mostly prototype bots that just came from Cybertron without taking any form. Look at Marvel they change how characters look for their movie to make things feel realistic but I guess Transformers is always an easy target for criticism. There was nothing's wrong with the transformers being edgy and dangerous they felt realistic. While some of the plot holes mention in this video makes sense other shit just sound mad stupid.
Why is Optimus Prime Basically Rick Grimes. Bee is Daryl.
You might like this sci-fi TV show called The Outer Limit. It aired from the late 90's to early 00's. Mark Hamill was in one episode.
RIP IRONHIDE🖤
Well the first three movies are still better than a lot of whatever marvel has been putting out and honestly most movies these days, that's how you know the bar is.... Low
I want to hear your opinions on the transformer designs in the beginning of Bumblebee
W Prime
Marvel does it no one bats an eye.
I don’t care what anyone says, I fucking love this movie
The Best transformers movies (in action  ,cohision and a bit of lore) are (in my opinion)1st,2nd,3rd and the Last 2 (6&7?)
*GIVE ME YOUR FACE*
I was around 7-9 years old when I first saw the first TF film, I fucking LOVED that film. Saw the 2nd, it was good. (these are all my opinion) when I first saw the 3rd film I loved it just as much as the 1st. Maybe it’s cuz the first 3 were just a go too film. Don’t know don’t care but I loved these films and still do. Now TF 4 was good but I felt it wasn’t like the other 3 but still good in its own way. Now when TF5 released i saw it when it first came out in the cinema because I was old enough (not really I snuck in I was 1 year too young to be let in) and i liked it more than 4 ngl but im annoyed at the ending cuz there won’t be 6th. Don’t care what u say bumblebee ain’t that good (my opinion) I’ll still go see the new primal film they release next year but I doubt I’ll like it more than the bayformers maybe cuz I grew up with bayformers and not the 80’s formers. Ill probably like it cuz it’s transformers but I just really didn’t like bumblebee so I don’t have high hopes. I fucking loved the cybertron part of bumblebee tho.    Edit: sorry I made this so long, went on a ramble and got carried away 😅
okay okay..Im subscribing, this guy made this well haha
Great movie The whole brutality and chaos in the city made you take it more serious
I like how he's mispronouncing the names Setnal Ballrog lol
Transformers wan't a fad that faded away until the movies, that's completely wrong. Beast Wars and The Unicron trilogy were very sucessful, Armada was so popular they had to repaint old toys just to have more stuff on the shelf because they couldn't keep it in stock. Don't believe anything you hear from 50+ guys thst think g1 is the pinnalce, they're allergic to facts.
Dark of the Spoon is just the nicer turd in a toilet filled with shit.
This just makes me excited for Rise of the Beasts.
Wtf was 1:22 bruh oh my god
Today I learned the writer of this shit is called Eren Kruger lmao.
Transformers 3 op movie 🎬 ❤️
The thing I can't forgive is doing away with Soundwave's ICONIC look and treating him like a lil punk. Not cool at all. Not to mention they gave him that awful raspy voice. AND, I'm pretty sure he didn't say eject once, wtf. WTF.
I like TF3 too. Last good TF movie imo, and has some cool combat scenes with a crazy looking Chicago
Actually intimate in Pokémon lowers attack not special defence
9:18 The scene with the Decepticon warships bombarding the city looks more like the Yuuzhan Vong invading Coruscant from Star Wars than something out of Transformers.
Explosive Guy, I mean Michael Bayblade Baywatch Transformer is the bad route ending for both Autobots and Decepticons. I still can't accept his work as canon and I always finding myself looking back at my childhood cartoon Transformers. Also the BeastWars.  When we could get a Transformer movie without humans on it and with cool design robots and not look like an abstract pile of junk smashing each other.  The transformer game seems did way better in story telling.
Very unpopular but I actually love the second movie. It’s definitely because I grew up on it tho. I was about 9 years old when it came out and I loved the first movie a couple years prior. I actually begged my dad to take me to the theater a second time to watch it LOL. Fast forward to today, I understand why it’s a bad movie but I still enjoy watching it for nostalgia  Edit: dark of the moon is my fav of the series and one of my favorite movies ever. I didn’t realize how much hate this movie gets LOL
Please make more videos!!
I think starscream was always one of the coolest looking characters. personal favorite
The Michael bay transformers movies (even the 4th and 5th ones) are good for 2 things and only 2 things. A good soundtrack, and extreme violence that still gets a of 13 rating due to it being practical effects and cgi
U can't say nothing bout ratings being pushed when the basis of what makes a rating changes. In the 80's and 90's if there wasn't nudity and extreme violence it got a pg-13 rating REGUARDLESS of what language was used and topics discussed. Don't believe me? Go and watch the ORGINAL "Bad News Bears" w/ Walter Matthau which has a PG rating(kinda surprised it was never changed)with CHILDREN using racial slurs used to refer Black and Mexican people as well as kids smoking and drinking beer(very briefly at the end)
Dark of the moon is good, they are all good just some aren’t as good.
Hey I liked it too
My credibility just withered and died!  Just like the Pokémon in the movie
Over a decade later and people are still finding ways to bitch about the movies smh
8:31 "ITS NO USE, WERE OUTNUMBE-" *fucking dies*
Only good people in this movie is Simmons and Tyreese Gibson
As a child of the 80s, I'm pretty glad I tapped out of the entire Transformers franchise after the second one.  The only things I know about the third movie now come from this video
“The Mountain Dew machine goes on a rampage” is not something I was expecting to hear today, but I’m glad I did
When they sealed off the city and the invasion started… I had chills. I still get chills from the first shots, especially when the 9/11 imagery from the ships shooting missles into the buildings. That was a great experience in 3D but absolutely chilling.
I like all the movies since I watched them as a kid, plus I just watch them cuz they got the cool factor. You don't watch a transforms movie to learn, you watch to shut your brain off and have fun. imo.
To be honest with regards to the Soviets it's a get-out-of-free card because even to this day 31 years after the calapse of the Soviet Union there are lots of shady shit still being discovered and no doubt there are vast amounts more hidden in projects and burried experiments. Heck we didn't know about Dead hand till 2011 and even then it's still murky so as an agonist they are pretty good at it.
I will never forget all the toys I had from these movies especially my Ark toy. I will forever love these movies even now in my 20s
revenge of the fallen is one of my favorites tho 🫥
Yall cant just enjoy a movie huh🤦🏿‍♂️
this movie scared the shit outta me as a kid. I did NOT like seeing people get disintegrated
I actually like Transformers 2 and 3
Game freak has hit call of duty status. They have all the money in the world and yet they can't seem to make a good game.
Now that I think back, the movie taking place in Chicago is kinda ironic. Literally a warzone.
I would’ve loved to see more of shockwave in TF3 his design was so dope
Bro why do I click on this video and for the first whatever 7 minutes. I’m listening to u complain about the love interest. I don’t think it’s that important. Hot girl here boom done.
You could say Shia and Megan Fox where......divided haha
Bro wtf is Megan doing nowadays 😭
I'm gonna be honest, the only reason I watch transformers movies has always been the fights. The plot can be complete recycled garbage but you bet I will rewatch the fight scenes a million times just because big robots doing mortal kombat fatalities on each other just activates my neurons in a good way.
Personally that other ending just doesn't do it for me. Wow your tired of the fighting you caused Megatron oh BOO HOO. Man look at you asking for a truce in the middle of the destruction of a city you helped cause oh the nerve on this one. You turned on your little terrorist business partner well guess what that doesn't make you any less of a terrorist. What really pisses me off is in the first movie he's being the biggest dickhead because he's at his strongest fresh outta the ice while destroying a city(and this is his first meeting with prime centuries later).   Later he KILLs prime and tries to blow up the sun then even when he's decayed and weak he unleashes one of his worst plans in DOTM and only after is his genocidal as* finally done. Nah rip Megatrons arm off and shove it down his throat because a truce from him is just a taunt at this point.
Hah, there’s no way PointlessHub is gonna make a video on Transformers Age of Extinction…           Right?…
"Give me your face." -Optimus Prime
0:56  I'm high as fuck and I had to constantly check if I read the title of the video wrong lmao I was so confused
I will be eternally mad that Megan's character was cut form the story now. I didn't know the script was already written. This film would've been infinitely better with her.
8:24 Is it a game or movie?
They could have just kept everything, just replaced the actress, and made a joke on how she looked different. Like Rhodey in Iron Man.
"Let's make an entire trilogy of movies where giant car robots commit war crimes for 2 hours!" -Michael Bay  Thanks for 5 disgraceful movies, Bay. Thanks for saving our sanities, Travis Knight.
Was it hard for them to not just hire another actress with black hair to play as Mikayla? It worked with Back to the Future when they had to recast Jennifer Parker for the sequels.
I like the alternate ending a lot. I feel like it fits Megatron as a character. Dude is just tired of fighting by the end and wants to go home. I like that a lot more than him just dying for nothing.
I take offense to that cod comment. The older cods and the modern warfare series were definitely military war games.
Low-key just need a series reset, brand new series, brand new cast and brand new writers
21:38 if you listen closely in that scene (in the movie) you can hear grindor begging prime not to kill him
This movie was my childhood
the diepticon dighren looks horrofaying but atou bots look like generick bots
The older I get the more I wonder how my dad felt watch all these war crimes with 7 year old me 😭
Dotm was my favorite tf film for some reason  I watched it when i was 6 for the first time and it was my favorite movie since then idk why lol
My favorite of the series
I cried when sentinel killed Ironhide. He was my favorite.
20:40
15:40 Well when you put it that way..
I LOVE THESE MOVIES
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.  Anyone that uses nostalgia as your argument, you already lost the argument
Watched transformers when I was 13 and megan fox was the only reason i liked it (og bumble bee>)
The explanation of Mikaela's original lines and the backstory actually made me sad. Seeing her and Sam's relationship reach its climax and conclusion would have been beautiful (if Michael Bay can even make "beautiful")
I don’t care what anybody says I loved this movie the movies before it and like the movies after. The movies after had a lot of flaws but it was just so sick
Man. Bumblebee was pretty good. Ngl, looking forward to rise of beasts.
Theirs a scene in TF1 when optimus kills bone crusher by stabbing him in the face then he proceeds to look around as if to see if someone was watching him commit straight up murder.
The way he edited Ironhide's death in this video actually made it funny
I kinda like this movie too 😂
7:05 that scream wasn’t needed but I do appreciate it 😂
1:22 is that the best footage you could find lmfao 😂
I don’t care “Time to find out!” Is one of the coldest lines ever delivered!
the only thing people watched Transformers for was... big robot go pew pew
I was fortunate enough to see the entirety of Transformers Prime on cartoon network as a kit. I LOVED it! Brutality, jokes, transformers facts, twists and turns, cooperation with the human military, being BETRAYED by the military like 2 entire times! And so, SO many Megatron revivals... But it was awesome nonetheless. And we got Soundwave in it. The coolest portrayal of him in any Transformers media
please make a video about age of extinction and the last knight
watching this after seen the new transformers film trailer in 2022 puts a lot into perspective
I hate all these movies so much.  Why do they exist?
*"The third one"* 💀
Transformers 3 was always my favorite out of all of them lmao just because it was in Chicago and I knew where they were at any point I love it
that opening pokemon analogy to compare against the original tone and age appropriateness of transformers animated show going into dark of the moon was well played, touche
I love the movie 🎥 but the office scene was bad and the megatron death scene also the aarmy coming from the moon
Transformers cast this whole time: “You’re asking too many questions…😠”
bro made this a few days before the announcement for rise of the beasts
Now how exactly can a robot be fascist? Especially in a random world that isn't their own? People use the word fascist too much and it's almost always used wrong now and days.
I like them all as fun movies.
I lowkey liked it, if they made like a short story that happened in the past. I'd kinda watch it yk
15:30 -16:30 had me in tears thank you
I just hated that Sentinel killed Ironhide man that hurts me still to this day
https://youtu.be/B2wpW04zL9o
cant wait for age of extinction, that movie is hot garbage
I saw this movie in theaters when I was 12, and everything went over my head. I was just there for the action scenes.
“the gang goes to Chernobyl”
This guy isn’t a pointless hub he just talks about movies
Blood💀😭I thought it was oil!!!?
This shit still ain't as brutal as the 1986 movie. An entire planet eaten, someone died from a fire lit inside of them, how about the guy who was the last survivor who got ripped apart by robot sharks after being sentenced for execution by a kangaroo court
“The Mountain Dew machine goes on a rampage.” 😂
Sad Robots go boom  Happy
At 16:00, is the background music from Toy Story 2 on PS1?
ROFT is actually good bro
I think they need to make a live action cybertron war tv show or something because that would be cool
The fact you said "fascist" as the (german) Mercedes logo is shown on the decepticon is fucking funny
The fighting is what made this movie..
I’m pretty sure it was oil, not blood.
Im sorry… this movie is the best action film of that decade. It’s really underrated.
I remember the feeling of betrayal all to well when Megan Fox was no longer going to be in the movie.
Transmission fluid is red too you know. So it’s not blood… maybe it’s trans fluid
The Genocide of Chicago gave straight 911 vibes.. It was actually disturbing for a P13 movie..
I actually like the 2nd one the most because the military was so on point and competent in that Egypt battle... The image of M1A2 Abrams going toe to toe with alien robots and winning with Sabot Rounds was so fringing cool.. It didn't hurt that I was in ROTC at the time and about to be in the Army lol
Very good video! Please make a transformers 4 video. Wanna hear all the bad things you have to say.
why you even need a love interest in a transfotmers movie? just show us robots fighting
My biggest issue with the transformers movies is absolutely no sense of continuity.
I look forward to your review of Transformers 4: Age Of Extinction if you decide too. Your analytical videos on the Bayformers are the best!
19:12 that edit killed me.
What’s that Pokémon movie in the begging I can’t find it anywhere
Bumblebee doing the Carlson at the end is the cherry on top.
I think the reason that Dark of the Moon works as well as it does is because it takes everything that made the first one enjoyable and cranked all of them up to 20
20:22 Shockwave, the Knight of Ren
19:12 To be honest, Spielberg's War of the Worlds made it "cool" to disintegrate humans left and right, so here's more of that.
16:14 said Poe Dameron
5:57  It's adorable how hard this series failed to make the human characters "relatable", focusing on the exact opposite of the actual stories.  No wonder these were 3 hours each.
0:52 sounds like a Pokémon movie I want to watch
Friendchise isn't done falling...has any one seen the new transformers / beast wars movie😮‍💨
I watched this at like six
As soon as the new beast wars movie was announced, this popped up on my feed, and I very much appreciate it...  Even if I know the beast wars movie is about to bastardize everything about my favorite transformers series.
Glad someone talked about transformers, a lot of people hated on it I always thought It was a great bad ass collection of movies
The best Transformers movie, don't even argue with that... Still not really good
Ok my thoughts on the transformers is that they ain't really that bad (until Tlk). here's list from best to worst list  1. Bumblebee - a great movie 2. The Transformers The Movie - Idk it's a movie that's really fun to watch 3. Transformers - Stunning Vfx and great music  4. Transformers Dark of the moon - that's some top-tier action! 5. Transformers Age of extinction - yes I know people including Pointlesshub hate this movie but I think its a decent movie 6. Transformers Revenge of the fallen - Sorry but I wanted to like this movie more but the human character are just to annoying. I guess the tiny bits of action are great. 7. The infamous movie that almost killed the live action Transformers franchise: Transformers The last knight - Boring trash and a complete letdown. For those of you fellow transformers fans, 2017 was a bad year for transformers. Oh yeah, don't get me started about robots in disguse season 3. TRASH!
The two and a half Transformers movies(plus AOE and that other one with Unicron, we don’t talk about Bumblebee) are best experienced one every few years, after you’ve forgotten the last one you watched, in an indeterminate order where you literally just treat them as standalone films and watch them in the order of “Hey, I just got this sudden urge to watch X transformers movie, let’s watch it!”
this was made just to hate on a series that inspired millions of people and brought laughter. the plot and the tiny niche details (like the "blood" that was mistaken for hydraulic fluid) doesn't really matter when it's just about robots, cars, badass shit, and America. rewatching all the movies right now is 100x better than wasting time on this dumbass 25 minute video, can't believe it's at 1.3 million views.
WING MASTER XDDDDD
I like the original end more 😭😭😭 why couldn’t we have gotten that
Please do bumblebee as well
About the war crime part   Oskar Schindler once said:  “War always brings out the bad in people, never the good always the bad”
they made shockwave a punk who didn’t even kill any autobots and only thing he did was get OP stuck, then Prime rips is “throat” wires out
10:30 What you mean?  They just German..  just kidding Germany ..  I'm referring to the way Germans build cars compared to Japan or the US 😂😂😂
In the first movie megatron was kinda scary and you knew he was dangerous then in 2 and 3 he was weak and was trash plus ironside was my man and they did him dirty
They did iron hide dirty
what was the one transfomers movie that had that plot with the grown man grooming that high school aged girl?
there makin another anthropomorphic car movie woooooo
Optimus murdering Megatron, after Megatron just saved his life and helped him defeat Sentinel… was peak character assassination. This would be like Batman just coldly slitting Joker’s throat after Joker just saved him from Bane and expressed how they’re meant to be rivals forever
Just see Mark Wahlberhg and the word Transformers a few seconds from each other gives me flashbacks reminding the absolute trauma that was watching that fucking movie
Only movies today that get money is movies involving war and military and comics.  Transformers just happens to be a movie about the military war from the comics
21:20 that's a stolen music from Inception trailer
This one is my favorite out of the original 3 because of how dark it is
Justice for my man Ironhide
Once Sentinel shows his true colors, I fell asleep and woke up for the last 15 minutes.
One of the best ones
Saw the new Transformers Trailer and immediately thought of you.
"In the sea of negativity"  *meanwhile Cinemawins*
This video was absolutely hilarious wtf
I unironically loved this movie when it came out
If we exclude the 80s and 90s TF. The bay movies are a little better
but i like transformers......
say what you will about the plot or unfaithfulness to the source material, this movie's action scenes were the absolute pinnacle of the time, my 13 year old mind was blown during that whole finale
anyone here because there is another transformers movie coming out i’m scared
I have no idea who you were or why youtube recommended your channel to me, but the moment i heard Andys neighboorhood ost run in the background i just had to click the subscribe button
Spyro 3 music in the background? My man, I appreciate you.
This is a classic in my book. It kicked off my cinema craze just before Avengers came around.
I love Transformers
Looks like your gonna need to make one more video than you thought. Transformers Rise of the beast trailer just dropped
16:25 That's a pretty forgivable sin, since it was the Cold War and I doubt the Soviets or Putinist Russians later on would've been eager to divulge the secret behind how they got it...
"YOU DIE HAAAAARH!!!" -  Optimus Prime
they're making another movie
if the transformers fought in a place like New York, they’d single handily surpass 9/11 in terms of devastation and sheer terror.  hundreds if not thousands of people would have died at the hands of Toyota robots.
war crimes is a dead meme
i love this movie, i dont care what everyone says its genuinely a good movie
It is just the Geneva suggestion since the Geneva convention is just broken well everyone breaks rules one way or another then why make rules.
This video totally changed my view of Dark of the Moon, the "good" Bayformers movie lol
The only thing I like the after movies is galvatron. And that's it
I recognize and respect the Outro music.
4th part is just super trash
I really like this movie and all the others simply cause I grew up on them and I love transformers and still do but it’s just my opinion
this movie was so bad that I think it barely wraps around to being good. there are some funny bits depressing bits war crimes and you gotta admit it is everything a 14 year old consumer would love. this movie in my opinion is an LSD trip if we were in vietnam
Can you do a 4th one?
Ironhides death was disapointing
They look like swirling piles of trash break dancing
You talk about the humans for some reason. Most people don't even care that wasn't megan fox, we watch for the giant robots.
If it died in the late 90's I probably wouldn't have squirtle or bulbasaur tattooed
20:55  Lol, there's any difference?
The cgi opening in dark moon is amazing and the score
Over the course of last week, I've been watching this series again since my uncle had DVD sets of the first 3 movies.   Dark Moon is the worst in the franchise, I know Extinction & Knight weren't anywhere near good but one of them was very weird while the other felt like I was dragging my feet in the sand. But Dark Moon is nothing more than just exposition from the first 2 movies and dumber down to make sense of the story
When are you going to do your Age of Extinction review.
12:30 to like 13:30 I don’t mind any of this at all.. it’s super cool
I find it hilarious that a movie with a budget of 195 million still manages to have Megatron clipping through the stairs at 17:14 for all of their fancy cgi they still managed to mess that up
Dude I cried a little and called out no when Ironhide died
I mean sentinel prime did betray the autobots with their rival enemy which betrayal is punishable by death like in the last knight Optimus prime should've died for his betrayal but he didn't cause kade Yeager saved him from his betrayal punishable by death
I really enjoyed the NASA stuff at the beginning.
3:29 where is this clip from?
You like this movie for the blondie victoria secret big lips model don't lie to me 4:31 Guess that Hitler made another movie with Megan about Mutant Turtles Not even hundreds years old craters get cover with lunar dust but aliens yes? Chicago the city on fire once, and cheap to film in it
Transformers is alternate history fiction
Hasbro ALWAYS killed off transformers, even in the cartoons, it was how they could cycle new toys.
Is it just me, or does Michael Bay look like a ripoff version of Scott Bakula?
I csnt be the only one that just didnt care 3nough to even notice the romance messups
I actually don't mind this movie. The final action scene is actually the best in the franchise. It is of course not very good, but it is a guilty pleasure, compared to Revenge of the Fallen, Age of Extinction and The Last Knight.
I don’t think I wanna look up trans theory’s
17:15 are those wheels really no-clipping at the bottom there?
Hoo boy, if you thought this was violent for Transformers, let me point you to a pair of comic series by IDW called “More Than Meets The Eye” and “Lost Light”.  Never has someone whispering to a robot sounded so horrifying.
17:14 his wheel on his left foot is clipping through the stairs
Wrong Patrick…..
i had a Shockwave toy. My brother chewed the arms off of it. I was so pissed
Honestly. I think Sentinel deserved what he got. The guy tried to enslave an entire planet
When I first watched the movie (was 10 at the time), I had no problem with Optimus executing Sentinel. I did have a problem with how he killed Megatron, though. That was out of character even for Bayverse Optimus.
So sad when Optimus kills space genocide committing space warlord. Get real Megatron was not a victim
I hate to admit it, but when these movies first came out, I loved them. Now, thanks to this video, I have realised just how rubbish they are. They are atrocious. The acting is awful, the sfx are a muddled mess, the transformers themselves are unrecognisable and poorly designed. A complete abomination. I have begun watching G1 cartoon on YouTube, and it is awesome.
Не согласен с тем, что это плохой фильм о Трансформерах. G1 нравилось большинству из-за постоянных битв между роботами. Бэй великолепно перенёс эту часть с битвами, пожертвовав малым — святым образом Оптимуса.
so just like i am legend they chose a worse ending for no reason what so ever, ugh hollywood can never not disappoint
I come for transformers and I get jon tron? I’m okay with that.

Is it a Michael Bay movie? Yes Does it have explosions? Of course, it's a Michael Bay Movie  WATCH IT NOW!!!!
Do blade runner
"I kinda like this movie." You're not the only one I watch it so many times it still entertains me.
bro when i was little i like dotm's ending but when i got older and into prime and g1 i started to dislike the ending then i find out there was a much better ending and they didnt do it because the fucking book came out way too early makes be so sad inside
I will be entirely honest, maybe because i was like a child, but i DONT remember mikayla being replaced, the ENTIRE time i just thought it was the same character 💀💀💀💀  (i also really liked the movie, because it has cool explosions, i couldn't give a shit what people think, living car make boom and im happy)
transformers 3
2:21 The exact reason I defend these movies. As an adult they are unwatchable, but I was a teen boy when they came out too and they were one of my favorite movie trilogies at the time.
4:09 On god
To me, Dark of the Moon is a masterpiece and a perfect real conclusion to the Transformers trilogy......     Let's just pretend age of extinction and last knight never existed
Idk why but the nfl theme fucking killed me I can't stop laughing
Still salty about Ironhide
15:25 I guess Buzz is fine answering questions so long as the question isn't "can I have your autograph?"
Wouldn't say transformers was just a trend of its time before the movies. There where TV shows before 2007 that helped keep it alive.
you forgot to mention rosie huntington whiteley 🍑 in the first scene. michael bay makes women look like sex objects in his movies
I dont think its blood I think its supposed to be transmission fluid, which is also red.
my dear ole heart charlie from cheeseland thats sacred
Pff if I was Optimus I would’ve gone after sentinel with the axe, machete with the red handle style if you know what I mean
Can I introduce you to a little cartoon called avatar the last airbender? *cough* genocide, and other very adult content/themes *cough*
I’m going to be 100% honest, this is my favorite transformers movie ever
Who knew that auto bots would bomb Iran after the US loses a soccer match to them
Dry and sweet.
The thumbnail made me 😃
The thing that pissed me off the most about this movie was how they killed off Ironhide. He was one of my favorites and deserved a warriors death, not a petty shot to the back.
Someone definitely watched Cosmonauts video before it was taken down
This is my favorite out of all the movies and the best one for the 3 act alone
He has a very familiar voice… is he any other YouTubers?
You fucking goat th at was a killer vid big homie
I remember seeing them filming some of the finale in Chicago when I was a kid and it was crazy to me.
IM AN INVENTOR!
3:39, this is the only reason why i hate transformers movies, it's so dumb and inmature, i just liked the cars
It really is a shame how much Megatron gets shafted in this movie. To quote a youtuber way funnier than myself: "From the moment he shows up, he's suffering, down and out, humiliated, struggling to feed his kids, and it only goes downhill from there. He gets squeezed out of the villainous scheme du jour, basically throws himself in the garbage to succumb to the head trauma that's clearly affecting his judgment, gets manipulated into revenging himself on the actual bad guy, and right when you think Megatron might actually redeem himself, beloved childhood icon Optimus Prime brutally Sub-Zeros the shit out of him, executes the already-defeated elderly villain that Megatron just helped him beat, by the way, immediately forgives himself, and then one of my dead heroes asks me if I feel cold."
I loved hearing a walk in the woods being used in the background
I'm disappointed. I was expecting the whole "Optimus is a war criminal" angle to just go deep into the weeds on the various clauses and sub clauses of the Geneva convention which were being violated on screen. Mistreatment of POWs. Torture. Poison gas. Using civilians as shields. Shooting at the red cross. Forced death marches. Just really lean into it to the point where people feel guilty about having been entertained by it the first time.  I want to see Transformers Nuremberg Trials.
... Wow yeah so...  On reflection, _how the f**k did this movie get PG-13?_
That was quite the intro
Transformers 3 is a horrible mess of a movie. It's not good by any standard, is arguably forgettable, and doesn't innovate on anything.  _And goddamnit i love it for what it is._  It's like you have a dog that is physically handicapped, pees inside pretty much three times a day on a good day, perpetually barks at nothing when you're not around, is horridly violent against anyone but you, chews up all your furniture, and refuses to eat anything but the stinkiest dog food. But you've had the good boy for 9 years, and you love him, because he's your dog. That's Bay's Transformers series for me.  _Also Transformers 2's Decepticon girl taught young men around the world a very important lesson. _*_Sometimes, it IS too good to be true..._*
i love transformers
I liked megaton better when he was a pistol
Ngl I'm starting to feel Ashamed that Age of Extinction is my second favorite Transformers Movie, behind Dark of the Moon
that worst part is I didn't even notice that McKayla was cut tells you how much brain power I put into watching this movie
Just cause you're commiting a war crime, doesn't mean you're in the wrong
'War Crime Prime'🤣🤣🤣🤣 idk why that got me so bad💀
Duck tales moon theme in the background lmao
I've got memories of the 4th movie cause I had a DVD of it as a kid and I'd literally watch anything as a kid
By the end of this film Optimus was really like, **hands up** alright I'm done f**kin around
Spielberg probably got pissed because...you know, he's jewish
RIP Ironhide, hardest hitting scene in the series for me. he got the General Shepard treatment.
He sounds very similar to knowledgehub. They should collab. Tots mah goats.
This video made me go back and rewatch this movie, and I am surprisingly pleased with my experience. Some stuff still makes me wither away internally, but there are a great many parts I appreciated more thanks to this.
Monsieur Z?
Are you joking? Temple of Doom (Indiana Jones)was the movie that invented the PG-13
you aren't subtle, I notice that transformers cybertron music in the background.
6:55  Patrick Dempsey, not Patrick Swayze. But then again, considering how lame this character was, whatever.....
" No Optimus ahhgahhhhh " - leonard nimoi
17:14 megatron's wheels clip through the platform he's sitting on and it's bugging the hell out of me. i will never unsee this.
Wasn’t shockwave just a boombox in gen 1 and didn’t he had a bird
Bay gets crap for these films, but this was my fave of them all. It feels like he legit attempted something proper here. At the time the brutal dark tone shocked me, and I love it.
I'm still pissed Ironhide had to die in this movie
Don’t care that he killed sentinel
This was legit the only movie I have ever walked out of the theater on... LMAO
You know Optimus prime was based on Lincoln with some Hints of George Washington and MLK. Think of that when you hear Optimus Prime say "ILL KILL YOU"
HAHAHAH the BEEG SHUTTLE line took me out that was fuckin funny
They didn't care about any detail like the fact that Iran's flag is upside down 😕
The novelization is canon imo. I feel like it fits Megatron’s best backstory, the one where he was a nameless gladiator that rose up to become a champion of the people who just lost his way with all the constant war.
I'd rather stay away from anything OG cartoon or Michael Bay I respect the OG Cartoon for being the original but don't enjoy it and I don't have respect for anything for the bay films! I will stick to the AMAZING Transformers Beat Wars and the getting good new shows!
As an aside about bay, I am very much inclined to believe Megan. Source “trust me bro” but when I was working on vanity fair I got friendly with the wardrobe department who also happened to be on the U.K. unit for dark of the moon. And holy shit do they have some stories about bay being a giant ass hat for weeks straight. Apparently they went through like 3 First ADs cause they couldn’t stand working for him. Narrative Long form directors are usually pretty cunty (at least on set, like it’s a really stressful job where one bad film can end your career plus if you get two three weeks into a long form job it sucks the sole out of you in general) so those old salt firsts are pretty thick skinned, I’ve seen those guys put up with some serious shit and not walk, so really says something they went through three just in the U.K.   It’s also telling that the first AD didn’t travel from the US to do all the U.K. stuff, if you bring a team over from abroad on that kind of budget level the first is usually on that list.
6:55 Patrick Dempsey, not Patrick Swayze.
AMERICA
Damn, this one blew up frfr! Glad to see this channel is doing so well. Great content that always takes me back a little. From 50k-200k! What’s next? 1 MIL! Go big or go home Mr. Pointless!
Why are you so scared to think that your viewers will disappear if you tell them that you enjoyed this movie, its your opinion, everyone has one bro
15:07 Balrog has no wing tho  :D
I know finding logic in these movies is beyond pointless, but one thing that bugged me.  So Megatron's plan was to bring Cybertron to Earth and use humans as slaves to rebuild it. But in the last movie Megatron's master, the Fallen, wanted to wipe out the humans by destroying the sun. So, did Megatron make this deal with Sentinel behind the Fallen's back? Was Megatron planning to kill the Fallen right before he activated the pyramid machine? Or did Megatron just forget he had a Plan B until after the Fallen died?
24:26 facts!
Optimus prime went to Optimus Crime
I didn’t notice this till now and you may have absolutely no idea who I’m talking about but your content reminds me of PancreasNoWork for some reason. Probably the voice, but it’s a good thing to be sure. Always love when y’all upload
Good video
Say what you will about these movies. One thing I love about them, is how progressively more brutal and angry Optimus becomes as the movies go on. He's just so angry that the humans constantly spit in the face of his want for peace to the point where they start working with the Decepticons that he goes from "Freedom is the right of all sentient lifeforms." To "I'LL KILL YOU ALL! DIE NOW!"
:Fun fact: Optimus has that mask canonically cause he talks so much shit he needs his mouth to be locked shut when he fights
I can’t tell if calling him Patrick Swayze is part of the joke or if you actually got Patrick Dempsey’s name wrong lol
8:11 I’d like to think this is one comes from the actual car like transmission fluid, power steering fluid, coolant, etc etc
I'm a bit surprised you didn't highlight that scene where Laserbeak rips apart a mom and dad after tricking their daughter into inviting him inside.   Just because there's no blood doesn't make it any less disturbing, Good Lord.   "Is your daddy home?"
Optimus Crime
17:14  *LEG MODEL CLIPPING!!* Even I, as a pretty beginner 3D animator didn't do that ever in the final version of the animation! Holy-!
Bruh is this Cody from Alternate history hub?
You know, despite being a TF fan, I’m not a fan of these movies but you made a good point about Dark Of The Moon being big dumb fun. I might have to rewatch it when I just need a dumb movie to turn my brain off to.
18:53 “the last third of this movie is a treat, mostly…”  *sentinel gets obliterated* 😂😂😂
21:22 First time I saw this movie I thought "Wait, did Steve just copy the Inception theme but made it more dramatic for added tHeMe?!"  Nowadays I still think that.
im thankful ive never watched a transformers movie
Didn't know you were a Tekken fan!
It was probably less violent in Chicago when the giant robot war took place then usual
the film was cool shut up
Legit idc. Love it
Damn man I've always disliked these movies for several reasons but yeah I have to admit the action is just pike awesome. But now finding out what the original ending was going to be I'm even more disappointed. There's a damn reason why I don't like Michael Bay lol
"somehow palpatine returned"   You hear the word somehow you know it's gonna be an absolute trash I mean...banger of a movie 😐
Say what you will about the Transformers franchise but the creators essentially took an old cartoon that everyone forgot about and turned it into a badass series of movies. A lot of people have gripes with the story line not being true to the cartoon or comic book but for me it was the movies that made me a fan of transformers. I will admit that a lot of the story lines are cheesy and unnecessary but the fact that the writers incorporated historical events with the visitation of transformers was genius. I love the moon landing conspiracy premise. I love the great pyramid actually being a giant sun-harvesting machine that was built by the primes 100,000 years ago premise. I love the hoover dam was built solely to house a giant 30 foot tall alien robot (Megatron) premise. I love all the conspiracy premises.
Red Energon shouldntve existed ever
Haha I love how as soon as you named the movie I was asking myself which one it was and you did the math for me 😂😂 definitely gonna subscribe
the rebuilding of cybertron could have been neat to see for the new movies. third parties that aren't decepticon or autobots fighting on both planets could have been more interesting. still the best part of the movie here for me was megatron wearily seeing his home again after thousands of years fighting.
Somehow they picked up that fuel rod
The Spyro music in the background… holy shit the nostalgia…
I never realized this was the same guy from alternatehistory hub lmao
You've heard of elf on the shelf now bet ready for the war crimes of Optimus Prime
I’m a simple guy so I’ve enjoyed every bayverse movie and personally think the original stuff is goofy maybe that’s because of the time it was made but like I said the movies are big robots fighting so gets my vote
20:40 you mean Lower attack
Stupid video transformers was badass and great a lot of the points in here are so gay and just cry babyish
earth also happens to be unicorn after everyone crash lands there
16:12 the soviet Luna 2 was the first object on the moon
I don’t see why the transformers age of extinction was so bad. In my opinion I fucking loved it
The transformers bomb iran in the name of nato sounds like a shitpost
“May i finish my (chinese product placement) milk please?” This was hilarious
Opjnhs prume is serbisn!1!1!!1
Resistance  3 (Franchise) or maybe 2 has an alien invasion take place in chicago and this movie looks identical to it's invasion scene, ships included
Something I really disliked about these films was the characterization of Optimus Prime. Prime was someone who would show the enemy mercy first, and then fight later if it's the only way that's necessary. In the Bay films, he rarely shows mercy, and even taunts the enemy he's willingly trying to kill. Despite the spectacle being very fun to see, I hope the newer films will make Prime more of an inspiring and compassionate leader that can make mistakes but learn from them. Obviously yeah, the Decepticons are the enemy and as a soldier Prime needs to obviously extinguish the threat when necessary, but it has to have weight to it. Maybe Prime can hesitate sometimes, trying to show mercy until eventually choosing violence in an act of self defense or as a way to end the conflict. The Decepticons were supposed to be the brutal and merciless ones, contrasting with the heroic Autobots. I hope they don't get it twisted again. If they're ever gonna have a scene of a character killing waves and waves of nameless ones, then they should give the role to Megatron, who deserves to be feared by the audience.  Then again, this is probably just my own view of the character. I'm not the writer of these movies, or any transformers media. Just my worthless opinion, I guess.
I like to think Optimus went through a similar arc to Rick Grimes just became so tortured by guilt and PTSD that he just became a killer by the end (or more likely the writers wanted him to sound like a call of duty protagonist) I like my idea better
The only good part of the movie is the moon conspiracy, at least is a cool flip on the moon conspiracy
I love Dark of the Moon so much. It’s all ways been my favorite film of the series aside from Bumblebee.
There wasn't "no explanation" for how the Russians got the fuel core thing. In the movie it was revealed that the deceptions put it there and shockwave pretended to try and fight them off but not really, so they'd go to the moon and revive sentinel prime since optimum had the revive thingy from the second movie
What’s that from 8:23 …is it a show or movie ..and what’s the name ?
Is it just me or is this guy from alternate history hub
Honestly if they keep making us think that random army guys can fight massive robots, atleast say that the autobots used some macguffen like the all spark to make badass weapons and armor that humans can use. Then you could have cool spec ops human soldiers with "transformer" technology. I mean if the movies are going to make basically military propaganda, atleast make it almost believable. I mean little bullets aren't gonna do much to the building sized robots.
Mike- “Oh OH this is the part where Optimus just blows his fucking head off.”  *Optimus, No! AAUUGHH!”  Rich Evans- “Oh my ggoooOOOODDDDDDDD!”
I completely forgot that Optimus goes apeshit and kills decepticons left and right
The betrayal and Ironhide’s death was one of the most shocking things I’ve ever seen as a kid. Really blew me away and made me hate the villains. Which is awesome for a movie to be able to do.
Am I the only person who thinks sideswipe in the movies looks badass and his duel wield swords are the best.
this movie gets too much hate i love the bay trillogy
This movie definitely falls into the 'dumb fun' category in a way the previous two did not (they were mostly just dumb). But I can actually enjoy this as an action movie. Not necessarily a good one, but an enjoyable one.
But... u konw that this is a movie about giant robots beating junk out of eachother for like 12 year-olds so the plot don't need make alot of sens.  I was about 10 or 11 when I've watched it first time and for me it was just this... and that was enough. Overanalizing this movie is waste of time because it never meant to be analized.
Revenge of the fallen had some of the best fight scenes in the entire franchise
I’m long over watching films just to see a big CGI fight.  And I’ve been over Transformers since the second one came out.  It’s just blinding cookie-cutter pandering to an audience that still remembers when the franchise actually had a plot to it.
NONE of the Transformer films are "awesome". They're all garbage. You invalidated your opinion way to early here.
Optimum just is downright evil.
This was pointless, ITS PERFECT 💙
Optimus, the coolest war criminal we grew up with
I love all of the movies… But 4,5 were ass
No matter what you think of the transformers trilogy, you got to admit it was always entertaining to some extent. Whether that's just plain awful writing or the "good" Autobots blatantly massacring the Decepticons with no mercy, there's always something intriguing to watch.  Also, this movie needs some giga chad phonk music put over it, especially when optimus starts his killing rampage
S..suffer? Revenge of the fallen is extremely close to the first one. I’ll admit not as good, OG transformers always goated, but being only 5 when the first one came out, I remember revenge much better
Oh s t f u Dark Of The Moon was the best out of the first 3!!! It was good, 4 and 5 were better than the first 3, by a mile, but overall all 5 of them could have been better, that slow mo, saturated metallic HD try hard, action BS was terrible, the cinematography for those 5 movies was awful and cringy as was the acting and writing!! Literally Bumblebee is the best of them all! If they made them all like that that would be perfection!! It looked, sounded and felt awesome!! The fights, the transformations, everything was beautifully done and the cinematography,  not cringy Bad Boys 2 Transformers edition BS like the first 5 with awful jokes and writing 🤢🤮
Heh, something about a Mercedes car executing american cars...
But ehren kruger write top gun maverick too so basically transformers 3 is a blueprint right? Right??
You had me at "warcrimes"
Another picture show fan I see
I always feel like these movies are like Taco Bell. No one can argue its high quality, but it fills the void when you need it to.
To be honest the Transformers movies are just dumb fun, kinda like drinking or partying, lol
will you ever review cheap off brand movies, like the offbrand battleship movie that had to be legally sued because it used the name "american battleships" and used near identical advertising images to battleship?
Are you monsiuer Z?
Do maximum overdrive 😘
Cant wait for 2037 when we get a gritty war drama about Skylanders
Wonder if Selen watches these
I'm happy to see that we're ultimately circling back 'round to the days when The Outlaw Josie Wales was considered PG :)
I always forget about the fan made live action Pokémon
Star wars taught us that war crimes are okay as long as they're against aliens
I'm a sucker for highly destructive urban warzones in movies and games. Some real GTA online type shit y'know? So fuck it, the part of the movie where they turn Chicago into the Purge but with giant robots? I like dat shit.
I love this film
I mean to be fair. War is brutal and the cartoons can’t really show it like Micheal Bay can lmao
I used to watch a lot of your videos on  alternate history hub and it’s good to see that you have your own channel now making your content, I heard ur voice and instantly recognized but I didn’t know where ngl I always liked your videos more and it’s cool to see you growing with your own channel
I realise now that they could have just let that VS model play Michaela, as a recast, and it might have been distracting, but far less than entirely replacing the character was
20:31 Me when Tserriednich’s Nen Beast shows up in HxH
I found you a week ago. Why do you sound like the twitch streamer Corello who stopped streaming a few years ago?
If only the cartoon transformers just...went to an unoccupied planet and tapped its core for power as opposed to relying on a backwater primitive species for energy lol    Then again the show couldn’t really happen then, so dumb kinda had to be inherent to them abit
Transformers 3 must have been one of Putin's favorite movies before Ukraine
8:07 I mean, who’s going to punish them? Humanity?   They’re stoked for just surviving, probably even thanked him for not letting their species be enslaved lol
The Soviets obviously sent a cosmonaut expedition to the moon after NASA left the satellite and the explorers gathered all components they could salvage from the Autobot vessel then using vodka and nuclear science researched fusing communism with alien tech
5:23 that’s honestly the most honest part of this series. “We got rid of the appealing actor and just got the appealing instead” because mikey boy is about as predictable as gravity
cody franklin you're one of my favorite youtube. Also I read Atlantropa Articles. that needs to be made into a movie, I would so watch it!
My dude, that intro was just a description of the manga lol
“I am Deep Wang!” “Feel my awesome power!” he whips out a bazooka from his pants “what the hell is this insane meat-bag doing with his clothes? Bleargh! there’s a pink tendril  flopping around… fuck this shit I’m out!”
8:48 COD World at War: Am I a joke to you?
Unpopular opinion Transformers 2 > Transformers 3, the death of prime and megatron calling for "Shtarshcream" after getting the crap kicked out of him
Im sorry the video is great and all but due to the occasional C&C Generals music all I can hear is the quotes from that game
In the original g1 movie optimus was gping to execute megatron, when he didn't know megatron had the gun, then died when hotrod got in the way
Ya know there are different types of energon, there is blue, green, and red energon, not blood
His Pokémon sword and shield
The halo music
I love that movie tf 😂
Optimus Prime decided to ignore the Geneva convention in this film.
i see helicopter = i like video.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA TRANS THEORIES
Is that a Spyro theme song ?
Based DotM enjoyer
so she's a satanist?
Does anyone else notice the Spyro Year of the Dragon soundtrack in the background?
17:15 if you look closely at Megatron's feet, you can see that the tires are clipping into the ground.
maaan shut up we need no pg 13 we got michael bay w optimus!!
Animated Transformers was trash.And as a kid who didnt watch much of it,I am glad I didnt.They made the movie more logical except for the whole Alien Machines acting out part.
Ok
Omy god I loved This movie
I think I like this movie cause is more entertaining then 2 like sure this has some cringy moments but I like them more then fallens
Anyone know the music at 19:50?
Respining the cosmos for fun and pleasure  A simple pass time
dark moon is so iconic i thought everyone liked it
This is hildchood
The only two scenes I liked in this movie is the car chase scene and when Optimus prime went into rage mode against the Decepticons
this video alone got me to subscribe. excited to see more of your content!
The worst thing about Dark of the Moon. In the next two sequels, humanity decides go back to antagonizing the Autobots and hating the transformers like in the second movie again, but this time because the Autobots let the Decepticons kill thousands of people just to "prove that the Decepticons can't be trusted" In fact it's even worse cause the humans who are also dumb demanded the Autobots leave them defenseless and in the sequels, they blame, declare war and kill several Autobots.  The poor writing.
video was amazing always been a big transformers fan when i was a kid you just got a subscribe from me
9:24 if that’s Chicago that’s normal I don’t know what your talking about
idk y i just kinda realized this but Dark of the Moon was that one gritty movie that actually was like “the stakes r even higher now.” Like ignoring story telling, this was probably the only movie I saw going into this where I genuinely believed the gud guys could lose w/o a teaser for the next movie where they’d somehow hit back (ie: Avengers Endgame)
IMHO: Though cases, when Transformers franchise tries being dark, grim, serious and violent, are really curious and fresh, i guess it would do better with more respect to characters, and a bit more well-written, than Dark of the moon had and was.
I’ve never felt more seen than in this video Lmfao. You understand everything about how these movies make me feel 😂😂😂
Transformers 19 the quest for more money 💰
I’m from Costa Rica, saw the movie when I was kinda…8 and after it ended everybody just started to clap lol
I’ll be honest the Michael Bay movies were my introduction to this series and I still love them for what they are also found linkin park through this series. So when everyone talks about the old gen 1 being weird to this time this is how I know these characters
good video👍
Fucking finally. A channel that can watch a fun movie without writing an essay on how it's the worst thing ti ever happen. I LOVE video essays detailing how movies are poorly written or produced, but some movies need some love, and the transformers movies are a perfect example. It's okay to have fun, while still acknowledging flaws.
Damn now I got to wait for part four. No way am I watching the movie... who does that nowadays...
can someone please tell me where the main channel is
Using Spyro music as the background? I dig it.
One of my favorite movies of all time. It has a very Snyder vibe to it with the cinematography and action and what I also like about Michael Bay’s comedy is it is mostly dumb adult humor and vulgar which is the opposite of dumb Disney MCU jokes and Michael definitely keeps the seriousness as the main focus of the film.
It is suprising the fact the Auto Bots let the Decepticons do a mini genocide in order to proff the humans they are very evil.
When you played the attack scene I remember watching that in the theaters and my jaw dropping. That war scene was brutal like people get disintegrated in front of us and their cloths flutter off. It really does cement the movie for better or for worse in my mind at least.
This video lmaooooo 😭
Holy shit I never noticed as a kid how stacked this cast is….. John Malcovich, Frances McDormand, Leonard Nemoy, Hugo Weaving, Alan Tudyk, Tom Kenny…. Some people that if you told me they were in these movies I would not have believed you at first
I distinctly remember this film as being the only film i've ever fully watched and afterward said "wow, this sucked" most of the times if i watch a full movie i at least find SOMETHING interesting about it and i disagree on the final part. its the part where I realized I was disliking it, mostly because it felt like we had jumped to a whole new movie. Tonal whiplash
I loved dark of the moon
Just wanted to say that I also remember the Apollo movie with Ryan Gosling.  I was lucky to see it in theaters on IMAX. I was unlucky enough to see Transformers 2 on midnight release.
I seriously need the sources of your footage of pokemon committing warcrimes.
Absolutely in love with their starships sound design
Pretty shweeet my manz
Optimus stayed in America for five years and adopted our war crimes. What a true patriot Then again the comics that tied into the movies kinda show what was going through his mind as the fights continued
Wait the original ending had then leave to rebuild cybertron? If they could just rebuild it why they been fighting over earth.
4:22 idk why but crediting Megan Fox's quote as *Fox McCloud* broke me
The one thing I liked about it was that it reminded me of what Gundam might look like if done better than that franchise live.
Never seen this movie, but it looks like the got NASCAR Transformers. WHAT? That's awesome! Question is, are they Autobots? Because if the NASCAR Cup Cars are the good guys, that'll be a massive win!
Everyone I know likes this one the most . As a fan of G1. I do too.  Its darker. It had better action. Great set pieces.  Actually liked the humour too and the human aspects for once
What are your thoughts on Transformers Prime?
There is only one part of this movie I dont like. The main girl is just sticking like a sore thumb even for me who defends all three movies
It's kinda hilarious how pokemon lost traction because people realized it's more of a samey game than FIFA
I was 7 years old when revenge of the fallen dropped in cinema and it was the first time I went to a cinema. Was just me and my dad and that experience is something really special to me.  I know the transformers films are bad to alot of people but to me it's my childhood, I've watched all 3 films hundreds of times easily and still love them 😆
Didn't transformers die during the omnicron movie
PowerPuff Girls reference was clutch
It always seemed like to me that the transformers have a little different POV when it comes to fighting and war. They kill each other a lot and that just seems to be part of their culture similar to how humans were hundreds and thousands of years ago
When you showed that toy from dark side of the moon I got flashbacks..my cousin had that toy and I used to put my little halo mega bloks guys inside it and fly if around. Good times.
Big ups to micheal bay for getting his sponsors to let him have the product placement actively murder people. Could you imagine if spiderman had the green goblin throwing cases of coke at people so hard their their necks break or if james bond beat someone to death with a xbox
I just realised that background music is from Spyro: Year of the Dragon. Nice nostalgic choice.
15:34 LMAOO
I just love the first 3, I know this one isn't great but it's just hard to explain why really like it I guess it's because it was my childhood
Ngl, wingmaster got me
Another Masterpiece
How I would change the film 1: have sentinel take control over megatron with starscream and shockwave supporting the mutiny 2: have sentinel be even more vile 3: Have megatron do the deed and actually do the ending where they end the war peacefully
Only in Ohio
Are you going to do all 6 of the movies ?
You should watch transformers prime
I love running into these random YouTube channels who remind me of the good ole stuff we all got to experience back then and I just cry🥲😂
There’s an interview with Michael Bay, or a behind the scenes, somewhere where he explains his vision for the third act was to make it “The Black Hawk Down of Transformers”. Which actually makes a lot of sense of the intense war vibe.  Also I love the Wreckers. The NASCAR theme is perfect! “We don’t let them out much because they’re assholes”
As someone who watched all 5 movies (for free even because I couldn't go to theaters) when I was a teenager, I could confirm that I like all of them because I don't understand what the fuck is actually going on aside from cool robots turning into cool cars blowing shit up with cool weapons.
17:14 do Megatron's tires clip through something or am i not seeing right
I like all the transformer movies tbh
With the state of modern pokemon, I wish it ended as a fad. I'm miserable every single day
It’s CHANG not Ching
in Transformers Dark moon, theres scenes where they are litteraly flailing violently rolling down glass buildings and the next scene there bodies are perfectly fine not a spot of damage. rolling through glass....
I would love to see the down fall of chicago and the dumbass humans looking how fucked up negotiating with sentinel.. .And that OG end of this trilogy sounds pretty cool. with those 2 things in mind this movie would be so much better
Your point about the normalization of whole sale slaughter is something I've noticed in other franchises.    Take Black Adam vs Terminator 2.  Remember when kid Jon Conner was horrified at the idea of terminating people, and freaked out against two innocent guards being shot in the knees?  Black Adams kid sidekick doesn't even bat an eye as he casually massacres soldiers by the dozen!  I understand Adam's sidekick is under occupation, but pretty sure seeing people burst in a murderous thunderstorm should be a traumatic experience for any kid.
For added color read the analysis by some Something Awful russian guy, it's pretty funny.
Ain’t no one gaf it’s dope and I love it
I was like 11 or 12 when this movie came out and I fucking cried when Ironhide died
I thought Megan was fired because she made racist jewish jokes, which Shia didn't like.
I personally like revenge of the fallen because some the transformers were pretty cool. I didn't like dark of the moon that much because it felt as though they killed so many transformers that were very well known. Iron Hide rest in peace, Soundwave rip, starscream rip, shockwave rip. Yet they managed to get Barricade to survive because he "played dead and then got a promotion and upgrade". I like the series which some things can be made different. I kind of liked transformers 4 because they brought old Optimus from the G1 series. I hated that they killed Rachet.
"- Fox McCloud" lmao
Yea I haven't watched Transformers that deeply nor do i care, but I still got this recommended and watched it so here's what I think, you have quite an issue I just can't put my finger on. Like, Buzz playing cool guy is somehow a con to the movie ? Like yea I get that it was his accomplishment and yada yada yada but you over analyze to even care about why he'd do what he'd do. Nah that's just a very dumb take anyway and so is the rest of this video, suits the channel name though, PointlessHub.   Not my cup of tea, I just don't like when people have to give a comment for the sake of giving a comment.
i desperately wanna see this guy talk about Aliens In The Attic
optimus "T-1000" Prime has had enough
Transformers (2007) is such a fucking banger
Optimus "I'll Find Ways To Destroy Your Decepticon Face" Prime.  Seriously tho what's with Prime and his allergic reaction to his enemies' faces lmao he seems to enjoy ripping them apart 🤣
Whats the name of the pikachu doll at the start of the video???
Revenge of the fallen is a great film
You sound like the guy from alternate history hub
Ironhide dying hurt me to the core as a teen. My favorite autobot
I didn't even know Transformers 5 was a thing, so I watched it today... it took 6 hours to get through it!
I can’t wait for you to dissect the “beats pill”
22:19  When my friend asks if our new co-op game has friendly fire.
i loved watching this as a kid as well as the animated series, just action to relax simple yet effective
Another day, another youtuber ranting...
IS THAT YOU ALTERNATE HISTORY HUB ?? I LOVE U
It would've been better if they made it end like the Prime cartoon. Or if they made the whole thing that way. That shit was actually good.
I loved this movie when it came out, and last time I watched it I still enjoyed it
I loved Revenge of the Fallen even more then the original. But I really hate Dark Of The Moon more than The Last Knight even though the latter was a just a long advert.
Wasn't originaly the decepticons the rebbels? Eventualy overpowering the Autobot regime making their representatives flee in an arc?
That’s not blood. That transmission fluid.
I always enjoyed the movies. They are fun.
Optimus can have a little war crime as a treat.
Man I can’t even lie, I enjoyed the shit out of this movie
"They were supposed to be purple but now they're just animals"  You know what they say: Once you go purple, your genome gets corrupted.
This was the one that was closest to being good. If they had kept Megan it would have been a lot better, Sam and Mikaela were a good pair. Blame Spielberg
Man when i was REALLY young i thought this was the best movie,now well...
"Intimidate to lower special defence" *Glares in childhood*
Love your stuff.
Transformers 2 is a guilty pleasure of mine. I’d always rewatch it many times when I was young and poor.
20:58 shoutout Rockford
love the Cybertron Music
In the original "Transformers" animated movie, Spike said the 'S' word when his ship got sucked up by Unicron and he thought he was about to die. Seemed appropriate to me.
I liked for the dancing robot at the end
Didn't know about that alternate ending. Would have been pretty good, but I guess Hollywood couldn't stand loosing a cash cow.
Intimidation lowers attack… I’m sorry
ngl i never pay attention to the humans in transformers so that whole ,,break up off screen,, dosent matter to me ,i just want fighting robots
I miss movies like this. Well like this trilogy. Yes very annoying at parts, but even sams arc is actually defined well in this movies and in this one particularly. The fact that he’s back in NEST and just kicking doors down because he’s just sick of this shit at this point, while also feeling that it’s the only thing that makes him special (because it is) is actually really good as an arc.
i fucking love this movie
Unpopular opinion, I loved Dark of the Moon. Was the human plot/interaction weird/bad? Yes, yes it was. Why did I like it? The big ass robots, the brutality, the grittiness, the realistic tone of it all. In fairness, I admit that my introduction to transformers was Transformers 1 (although, I did end up watching the OG stuff later), so that definitely paints my bias. Bay's run of the movies was horrible overall when it comes to interpretations, motivations, and deliveries of the classic characters, but imo T1 will always be a classic and the war concept alongside the pure action of Dark of the Moon will always be my favorite thing from from the trilogy (even if it was all a dumpsterfire when looked at logically)
It is the best film in the franchise. Do not be ashamed! & Do not believe the lies!
Now that you mention it I did happen to watch a censored version of this film where the violence is blurred out. It was dumb.
Are you going to do transformers 4 and 5
the red thumbnail border made me think i already watched the video omfg
I hated when people said optimus had no character development. He had so much over the course of the movies
"I'll keep making the robot movies and you can't stop me"  He was just asking to be replaced when he said that, and look what happened.
What's the 8-bit song at the end
The only thing fallen got right was just jetfire, he just works
this movie is halo meets call of duty mw2, meets gran turismo
Oh c’mon, Sideswipe doesn’t look that ugly. Que on the other hand I can understand.
After you've gone through the Bay Movies could you look into Transformers Prime
I like dark of the moon I see explosions and boom boom guns I like
The Wheels on the feet of the big bad decepticon are fucking clippin 17:15 - anyway, cool vid :)
Optimus became mental ill because of the people and started killing like a murderer
At least with Dark of the Moon (and don’t get me wrong, it’s still a bad film), there was a semblance of a story going on that lead to easily one of the most brutal climaxes in transformers history that was as horrifying as it was engaging and entertaining.  Extinction was just an absolute mess from start to finish, with one scene in particular actually making me physically ill. We watched it in the theater and there’s that one scene where the group is trying to infiltrate the ship where the auto bot Hunter is and the bass sound of it charging up a weapon was literally so loud that I could feel my organs vibrating and it made me nauseous.
Fun fact about Sentinel murdering Ironhide, the IDW comic of the films would reveal that it was racially motivated. Ironhide is part of a minority tribe called the Thetacons who rejected Sentinel's status as a legitimate Prime lol
Wouldn't have made more sense to just recast Megan Fax's character instead of creating a new one.
My dad always told me that pokemon was actually pretty dark , he asked me once "you support dog fighting?" I said no obviously then he said "pokemon is literally catching animals as slaves to fight for money, power , or status" then i was like "HOLY MOLY DAD YOUR RIGHT"
You better do one for the last 2 movies!
perfect video, fantastic video, that's patrick dempsey not patrick swayze
U know one thing i wanna mention here is that i really loved the movie 4 and 5 designs Idk why boomers keep on crying about gen 1 design
I'm glad I watched the Transformers movies when I was younger and didn't care much about the details since I came to see giant robots fight and blow stuff up. Say what you want about the movies but they were peak content growing up since it was just mindless fun. I might just rewatch all of the movies in one sitting someday with my brain turned off for a day.
If you’ve never thought you were capable of war crimes, you’ve never had a real enemy
I'm really glad I watched these movies as a kid with rose tinted glasses.  Can only get that if I'm trippin now
Is this alternate history hub's second channel
This was the only one of the first three movies I came close to liking. Maybe my investment was just so low that I could finally "switch off my brain" like everyone says to. The scene where they're battling Shockwave in the collapsing skyscrapers was the only time I remember feeling an actual sense of engagement and suspense during an action scene in any of these movies. Not having Megan Fox's lifeless doll eyes on screen creeping me out was probably also a plus.
"Mt. Dew Machine went on a rampage" HOLY SHIT THIS BROKE ME, HOW COULD I FORGET HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Ummm achtshually intimidate lowers attack not sp Def. -3/10 unwatchable
Press F to pay respect to Ironhide
🤣🤣
When I saw this movie in theaters as a child I had to walk out cause I started crying when the deceptions were disintegrating people, it was brutal as a kid
The Cybertron games really highlighted how much we were shorted of a good Transformers movie series.
The one cool thing that came from Revenge of the Fallen was Optimus used his JetPack then never is used again
I utterly despise Transformers movies but now i want to re-watch this clusterfuck of a plot.
i re watched the series a few months ago and as much flack as i gave it and complained (im not even a movie buff, i just had my own issues with it) i honestly find it pretty fun. its forgetful and after watching it all i can barely recall anything from it but that makes re watching it again kinda fun
I actually cried at the cinema when Iron Hide died lmao
I’m gonna be honest. I actually liked AOE a lot. I actually like it more than this movie
Ignorance is showing by mocking “conspiracy theories” but I get it I grew up with Apollo posters too, same way kids grew up with this NASA propaganda
My teenage self is absolutely seething right now dark of the moon is one of my top 10 movies I’ve ever watched and u just shit on it for like 20 mins but you definitely bright up some questionable things in this movie that would make the movie better still one of my favs tho😅
ironhide's death traumatized me as a kid
“Um why is shantelle using what appears to be a red cup from the red floor when we are on the yellow floor? It is a visual and therefore a visceral betrayal. Stop it” - Bruce Brazos
The Russia-US Intelligence Black Hole actually makes plentiful sense.  We still know very little, save what we've garnered from refugees that fled the Soviet Union and *cough cough* National Socialist Wehrmacht Commanders post-WWII in exchange for asylum *cough*.  We really don't know, to what extent, the Soviets were typically up to. Hence why the Cold War was a game of Intelligence and Black Operations. CIA with their assets against the KGB and their assets.  Thus, yeah, it would be one of those "Shit, we don't know how they got it... We just found out ourselves that they had it when they contacted us to do a hand off with you guys and our operators,"  I mean this is the same intelligence cadre and US Intel Community that took 10 years to find one man responsible for 9/11. After invading two countries, tasking every branch, and every allied nation's intelligence communities, 13 DoD satellites (probably more), a network of spies and informants, and we only found him because two dudes in Pakistan said "Hey, we found this guy that matches the description, person, character, and mannerisms of Osama Bin Laden... And he lives in this compound and rarely leaves it. Oh, and he has like two or three personal couriers that frequently visit the place... Probs check it out CIA,"  What I appreciate is that the average American civilian tends to think that the US Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence communities are like these deeply big brain, super smart, capable, James Bond level super spies and analysts...  When really its just a typical echo-chamber of what we know, and what we assume we know based on what we know... Military Intelligence itself, is an "oxymoron". They use a lot of words that are synonymous to "we assume" or "its probable". When they start throwing that out there, its probably 95% shit with a nugget of gold at its center that you have to wipe the shit away to get to. And that gold is literally "The enemy is on the objective's location, expect contact, and expect it to be harder than it needs to be,"  The US Intelligence Community is hyped up, but the opposite is the reality. Most of the Branches have E3's and E4's running most intel analysis. The CIA only takes what's crucially necessary to address as legitimate threats to national security. But they all run around making assumptions because time frame necessitates action, because investigating probable cause, motive and means would take too long and would be far too late when they find that this X problem MUST be stopped.  This doesn't mean they're stupid. They're our best and brightest. But Bureaucracy, urgency of the mission, and obviously, narrative, are more important than determining the veracity of intelligence... Even though the job of analysts is to sift through, compile, and provide a package to those making decisions on the issue at hand...  Its really an irony...
Ironically, the dark edginess is what makes it less appealing, at least to THIS adult. Poor Shockwave got Boba Fett'd...
It’s a great movie, actually. True piece of art
Alt history is that you?!?!??!
Transformers 3 or: The one where Optimus Prime publicly executes old-man begging for his life with a shotgun.
I'm an inventor
Yes bro
Absolutely love the Spyro 2 music in the video. ❤
“The Mountain Dew machine goes on a rampage” 😂 idk why but that was so funny to me
Revenge of the fallen my favourite lol
I legit just rewatched this movie, google is for sure keeping tabs on us but I do like them, couldn’t believe that this one came out way back then and even age of extinction came out in 2014, I was just 13 years old, time really flies, I don’t care that these movies have bad writing or whatever, they’re fun and awesome, revenge of the fallen was kinda bad tho, could’ve done without the dogs and without Sam’s parents throughout until the end where they seemed to really care for their sons safety
Now since you mentioned it... Please do the first man one, the 'literally me' version  of Neil Armstrong
I sat down watched the 3 videos then walked away from my phone came back YouTube reset then it started recommending Transformers content then it recommended Trans Theories video on the original ending I watched the entire video then remembered I didn’t finish this one then came back the felt deja vu when he started talking about the video I just watched  Liked them both
Did I hear some of the Spyro 2: Riptos Rage! soundtrack or am I just hearing things?
nice use of Peril by Marty O'Donnell
20:35 As a pokemon fan, this causes me unbelievable amounts of pain.
@0:50 Narrator: "Imagine if you sat in that theater and watched your favorite Pokémon canonically commit war crimes." Takeshi Shudo: *"Hold my sake."*
I was a kid when they were filming this and my mom has a recording of all of our guesses on how the movie would go.
You are hilarious! Such a good video
I think as a whole, all the transformers movies, even the bad ones, would all be so much better without all the nonsensical, unwanted, and frankly pretty bad human segments that no one asked for. In a series about giant shape shifting alien robots fighting an intergalactic civil war, there are FAR to many human moments that not only slow the pace of the films, but are also cringe to the point that you just wanna skip ahead to the actually important shit, but you can't because you might, *MIGHT*, Miss something.  Honestly, if these films were remade but with about 90% of the human bits completely just removed, they'd probably be much more enjoyable. I vaguely remember dark of the moon, I mean it was like 13 years ago and I was like 11, but even then I thought the movie was ok, the action was great, but that's to be expected, the action is always good in these movies, in the bad films, but that's not saying much when it's giant robots blowing shit up, that's never not cool. But the plot was just terrible.
Sentinel's betrayal wasn't done the best NOR the worst. He kinda just feels genuine and the signs were there but since everyone thought he was like Optimus, which he is at heart but he sacrificed his morals for an amoral purpose, they didn't fully expect his betrayal.
i actually prefer the transformers more robotic design. i love crosshairs and drift but seeing their humanoid robotic faces up close is a little unsettling 😂
if this pushes pg-13 you needa watch speed racer. it pushes pg to the max, the movie fire but the trailer is weak so don’t trust it if you watch it. it also has a lot more depth than you imagine it would.
8:18 this is the one thing I really hate about this movie. They added blood for no reason. 12:30 WOW. You just reminded me of how the new transformer style started by bumblebee is great.
Yea but there robots so because they don't have souls you can be as brutal as possible and its always kid friendly because... Well we love violence. But morality keeps getting in the way. So this is a compromise.
When i was young i loved revenge of the fallen 👶😐😐
My question is when did sentinel crash?? What has the fallen been doing all this time?
Imagine still watching the Transformers movies or Michael Bay movies in general.
the worst of the movie is what happened to shockwave, is the strongest decepticon that appears in the movie and is defeated by humans and optimus in a really easy way.
I hear a lot of Spyro music in this video and I love it ❤
1:43-2:15 is the perfect way to describe the Bay mivies
That movie was sooo over the top
We already knew robot violence is acceptable for a long time  .. look at Samurai jack that was rated Y7
I don't know if this is true or a weird Mandela effect, but in some novels optimus was once mistaken for a decepticon for his brutality.
Yeah the stories make no sense but damn the first 3 movies are SO MUCH FUN and they LOOK SO GOOD
The autobots are playing cod, but Optimus is playing doom on ultra-violence
What's the outro song?
Patrick who???? 😂
Literally the only reason why I like this movie is the final hour of it. That's all I came to see.
This video reminded me that Megatron is infested in TF3 lmao. The little bots crawling on/in his head xD
Using unmanned probes is not a bad explanation
I was a teenage girl when this movie came back. I wasn't the target audience but I damn well enjoyed tf out of it just like I did TF07. The nostalgia is strong. I'm 25 and still enjoy the Transformers movies, comics, and shows... the good ones, at least haha.
I undertand that this movie particularly has more violence than the other 2, but never forget that the second movie starts with Autobots hunting down and killing a Decepticon. Not in the middle of nefarious acts of perfidy or anything, he was hiding and a team of Autobots hunted him down as he ran, neutralized him, and then Optimus executed him by shooting him in the face, without any remorse or like, possibility.  What I felt at the time of this movie was that they were basically escalating Optimus from in like a negative way. He was getting worse all the time. By the next movie after  this it's like " I know I said I don't like killing humans but...I'm gonna start making exceptions now." And yes, there's context in that movie why he's like that, but he'd already ripped off Fallen's face while making jokes about it by then, it was not a crazy heel turn that came outta nowhere.
This movie basically requires you to turn off your brain for about 3 hours and just watch big robot executing other big robot
i love this movie
My favorite transformers movie :D  The three first movies are my favorites actually. They're bad? I don't quite know XD but yeah probably but I like
Optimus "Based" Prime
You had me at: "No, Optimus!"
The deceptions were holding onto the pillars while they were buried on the moon. When sential opened the portal, they jumped to earth along with the pillars
Solid video. The pitch meeting videos on the Transformers franchise are really funny,worth a watch.
can you make a mad max lore explained video
Gonna be honest, i did knew Megan was out of TF3 and all of what happened, but i had no idea that the script of TF3 was already done when she was out, it makes much more sense now why Carly's place in the movie felt so weird.
The heck why does the third movie gets hate i think it was one of the best
The action in dark of the moon was top tier to bad Michael bay had to sprinkle a ton of his corny outdated sex jokes
“Super easy, barely an inconvenience “
Hey everyone ik its pretty late but i just wanna tell u all to take it easy, relax, pray to GOD and have and trust in GOD as well as believe in his one and only son Jesus and to repent of your sins. hope u have an amazing day.......
For movies primarily made for kids, they honestly had some dark shit in them, when i was a kid watching the transformers franchise i questioned what am i watching at times, Optimus Prime, Iron Hide's and Ratchet's deaths were all brutal and visceral af
The car chase scene in 3d was awesome.    But everything else sucked
Average day in Chicago
Man, I kinda wish they went with the original ending, would've made the movie more interesting.
Nah any PG movie from the 80s pushing the limits of modern rated R
It's like that conversation at work when you're not paying attention but then you catch like some of it... so you're like thinking about what you had for breakfast and then you hear like so anyway I was burying this guy in my yard last night when the cops started....and you're like 😒
Not so unbelievable to not get a job after achieving a bachelors degree lol
My theory is that the army are the fully grown hatchlings inside the Nemesis that we saw in Transformers 2, right after Megatron gets revived and visits the Fallen in one of Saturn's moons. That would explain why the army wasn't ready to do anything until Transformers 3. Their aircrafts could've been buried inside the moon the whole time, but unmanned.
This is so entertaining 👍🏻
Hi, my name is JesusFreak8824, and I also like Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon.
That “somehow they must’ve picked up that fuel rod.”  Really reminds me of: “Somehow palpatine returned.”
A friend I went to middle school with is an extra in this. But they cut his scene for the theatrical release.
The novelization of the movie goes into a lot more detail on the end of Sam and Mikala’s relationship.  It doesn’t go into why they broke up but Sam is more affected by it to the point that he has a lot more trust issues because of it.  Plus Carly is given a LOT more development
Did you know that, TF Dark of the moon was inspired from IDW Comics.   It was originally supposed to be Optimas come to Megatron so that can leave earth & Autobots can establish new align relationship between earth & Cybertron.  But it was changed because of Michael Bay. He said, "He didn't feel the vibe" 😑
Even in the first bayformer Optimus method of killing his enemies is brutal.
20:34 Shockwave is female? It all makes sense
20:36 when he said Intimidation lowers Special Defense one of my kidneys stopped working.
Exactly. Transformers 3 is my favourite because war should have casualties.
The 7 year old me sitting in a theater, watching Prime turn grey and die, didn't feel like the idea of war was "masked." It was pretty damn real and heart-breaking.
Pointless thought he'd lose credibility because he admitted DotM was a guilty pleasure. Little did he know DotM was everyone else's guilty pleasure too.
This movie is great.
12:44 movie name?
I believe this is the first time I've seen someone mention ad astra
14:50 lol
Can we get an "F" for Ironhide.
Earth in the Bay-verse is like Tatooine in the SW galaxy. Everything important happens on ONE PLANET!
What always killed me was how, in each movie, there were characters that just showed up and disappeared with no explanation and in each movie there's this "ultimate powerful thing" or a shit load of robots hanging out somewhere that was just forgotten about. Like, Megatron just forgot about the shit ton of decepticons on the moon or he wasn't told and you'd think that would have been mentioned at some point..
Revenge of the fallen could of been okay had they not decided that every scene needed some sort of sex related joke, gets old really quick in that film, still wouldn't be a good film but it would of at least been watchable.  Also I don't believe anything Megan blood drinker wierdo says, she acts like she's living some teenage vampire fantasy with the guy who's so edgy he slices his throat everytime he speaks
Another change was the controversial Twins being fully cut  They woulda died to Sentinel if they made it in
i remember this movie looking incredible at imax 3d, it was so good that i've seen it 3 times.
Remember the laws/guidelines of our world don't apply to transformers they won't have NATO where they are from
I kind of liked it too, because I thought it was a logical conclusion to the Transformers movie trilogy. I was wrong.
it was obvious that Carly was meant to be Megan foxes character, her interaction with megatron at the end would have meant a lot more if it was michaela who had known him in the previous 2 and knows hes always meant to be in charge, carly had a good guess or second hand knowledge from sam
All transformer movies are good Fight me.
Transformers has never been a stranger to showing the reality of war honestly. I remember the War for Cybertron and especially Fall of Cybertron video games going for this hard.   I think the Netflix Cybertron show does too. As well as the comics.
I was gonna listen to the greatest YouTuber ever call me Kevin our dear leader but the thumbnail made me must watch this amazing video
What about multiverse of madness???
war crimes is Optimus' middle name
This movie is genuinely one of my favorite movies   It’s not a great movie  But I love and appreciate the movie
he reviewd every transphormers, amazing
Yeah, this is an enjoyable video with valid points and all that, but I’m just here jamming out to the Spyro the Dragon soundtracks you’ve got in the background. Seriously, another great video man! Keep up the good work!
I dead ass read the title as Terminator 3, and wondered why the video started with Pokemon then went into Transformers. I thought it was a shit post until I reread the title. I may need glasses.
Make a video about The great martian war.
dark of the moon is the best of the 3 idk how people can complain.
18:33 Wait, that dude's name is Ehren Kruger?? Like Attack on Titan Eren Kruger?? That's a real name!
Still...what sucks the most of this trilogy imo is how much bay jerks off the military...it would have been better if no human made weapon at all could even tickle the transformers, nobody paid the ticket to see soldiers win a war against alien robots, we paid to see alien robots shooting alien robots
The worst for me was the sheet on Shockwaves head! So disrespectful! Also the bowlegged Soundgarden was painful!
I'm sorry but it's Patrick DEMPSEY lol. I think Swayze had already passed by this movie's release, though I could be wrong
Pretty much everything you said reflects my thoughts on the movie. I also want to say I loved Megatron's character in this and would've liked the alternate ending so much more
Am i tripping or is that not Patrick S. And instead Patrick Dempsey lol
The ambient Spyro music in the backround hit the feels
2:21 I've always looked for the right words to explain why I still enjoy this movie a lot. You said it as perfectly as it can be said.
Steve Jablonsky has created some of the most iconic scores of all time. Fitting, since he’s Hans Zimmer’s protégé I believe. Sentinel’s theme from TF3 is downright mind boggling, as is the climatic “This Is Our Fight”.
New York Cali Vegas and San Francisco are the most overused action places in movies
Cody???
I always thought the odd numbered transformers movies was pretty decent. First one was good and most memorable. Second one Meh, third one was ok. Fourth one, well. By that point it was just exhausting to go through it in the theaters.  Never watched the 5th one, and I don’t want to.
Birth of PG-13:  Child slaves,  human sacrifice,  ripping a beating heart out of a chest,  Asians.
Honestly this is my second favorite transformers movie behind the original transformers movie. It’s just so dumb and I just love it.
Ironhide was legit the first time I got mad at a character dying.
I liked transformers 4 because it has a lot of bad ass scenes
You liked it??? We'll here's a dislike.
I LAUGHED WHEN PRIME KILLED Sentinel and Megatron. (Should of been done years ago. I stood and APPLAUDED in the theater's)
Optimus killing Megatron and sentinel is one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen. Also, when Optimus shows up in Chicago after faking the autobot deaths, that scene is perfect.
Duck Tails moon theme there at the end I see you.
In THE LAST KNIGHT, Mikaela was supposed to find out that she was a direct descendant of Merlin the Wizard. LOL.
DOTM is my FAVORITE! I SAW THIS MOVIE ALONE IN THEATERS! (I APPLAUDED WHEN Optimus Prime KILLED Sentinel and Megatron!) Optimus Prime is my hero but the ppl=sh!t in those movies!
This just reminds me that I remember absolutely nothing from this series except that the decepticons look cool
I'm listening to your critique of the relationship between Sam and the girl and I don't really care one iota about it. Not one.  I didn't even really try to piece that together between the films because that part of the movie series makes no difference at all to me. I didn't really like Sam from the get go. He is extremely annoying. Maybe I'm a lazy critic,  But I thought overall that human characters were OK and the story with them was fine. Good enough. I think they just cared more about having some eye candy and movie. Same thing with Megan Fox ìn the previous 2.
I appreciated that they made human soldiers actually somewhat capable in this, taking down some Decepticons and not just being there for the Autobots to save them was nice. And this movie had the Cole Train in it, and that's enough for me to enjoy it.
The original Transformers animated movie from the 1980’s was also very violent
I always took Optimus’ decent into brutality as someone who has pretty much lost almost everything and he’s just 100% done. I could see this being the case in real life. Imagine being righteous and merciful and then you brutality lose soldiers under your command, your home becomes uninhabitable, you lose close friends, your new home is about to be lost, and people who you thought were your Allies just stabbed you in the back only to be followed by an assassination attempt. Yeah. I don’t care how good of a person you are, that’s enough to make some heads roll for sure.
optimus prime glory kill
One thing I really really hate about Bayformers is just how open they were about being American military propaganda. I'm a huge fan of TFs and when the first movie came out I was also a fan of Spielberg, but after these movies came out my respect for him was really lost. Suddenly all of his movies were not about the human condition, but just pamphlets of american imperialism by a very good director.
I loved the first 3 transformers movies tbh, even the second one
I remember I found it hilarious when I saw this and they executed Iron Hide and nobody ever mentioned him again the entire rest of the film  The only somewhat recognizable autobot other than like Bumblebee and Optimus and not a single damn was given
Literally my favorite movie xd Probably just from nostalgia though
nah but sentinel being evil was the greatest plot twist ever to 6 year old me
No way this is alternate history hub guy
Filmento did a great video on Transformers 3.
So much new information, this video was awesome!
A person who has never needed to exert themselves physically for more than a couple days usually won't enjoy sitting back and watching a movie that isn't a stereotypical indie movie where there is no sign of anything remotely resembling enjoyability.
ngl the music in this movie also went hard
Age of Extinction wasn’t a war crime, but it’s pretty damn close.
I would like for you to make a video about why Transformers: Extinction is bad. I've heard how much it's hated, but I don't fully understand what's so bad about it.
I indeed love this movie for the last third. It’s just action põrń cause it’s a Michael bay film, So grass explodes on contact😂 if there isn’t action happening with transformers on screen (the first 2/3’s of the movie) just an absolute bore with painfully cringe dialogue and pointless dick jokes. All in all I’d say 7/10 if you fast forward through the first half or so
remember when pokemon was said to be "dead" then pokemon go came out and people went crazy? seriously everyone loves to say a franchise is dead when it really isnt.. thats a huge stretch, on that note, I love the Bay Transformers, extremely over the top, wish more adapations were like this
Lenox should’ve been the main character of the humans instead of Sam, since they’re going all out on using the military as a kind of competent force against the decepticons
I remember seeing this film in theaters opening weekend. I was hyped that it was shot in Chicago and featured the voice talent of Leonard Nimoy. I was aghast as Optimus killed Sentinel Prime as he begged for his life, and executed Megatron by surprise. I found it appalling. Optimus Prime from the previous media would never act in such an evil and underhanded way (if anything it seemed much more like a Megatron thing to do than an Optimus). I was truly disappointed. Watching this video reminded me of my disappointment when I first saw this film, and I still haven't rewatched the movie since I initially saw it in theaters.
I remember watching transformers 3 when I was a kid with my whole family, and I have to tell you I was really scared to watch it it got me bad dreams at night.
That's a doozy of a thumbnail lmao
If you want to see a movie that pushes its pg-13 rating…look no further than Revenge of the Sith lol
The game based on this movie is fairly good from what I remember. The 360 one, not the DS one. Might just be nostalgia though. I havent played it in years
"dang, the ancient artifact got lost to space, no need to check earth though, there's no way way the cube, the matrix and the Ark all went there by coincidence, right?" Sounds like something dumb enough for Starscream to say and also something smart enough for Starscream to say.
Does anyone know the source of the stuffed Pikachus image at the beginning? Would like to know
I loved the first three transformers movies
Good use of halo music :)))
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel thingy. Somehow Palpatine has returned.  Same energy.
Tbf soundwave is blue but is a satellite. Shockwave was also pretty on point but I honestly thought the worm machine from the trailer and title was Unicron ripping Galactus.
Dark of the moon is my favorite transformers movie.
Damn, I haven’t watched any of the Transformers sequels in years, and I forgot just how brutal these were.   Really makes you appreciate the breath of fresh air Bumblebee ended up giving us.
transformers 4 sucked, makes this film look great
Seeing Sentinel Prime's Brains Blown up and Starscream's death is so satisfying to see. At this point Optimus Prime is at his breaking point.
I remember sitting in theaters and immediately after one specific gruesome scene involving humans being turned to skeletons, the family that sat in front of me got up and walked out, not to return.
Yeah, 1 and 3 are always movies I have no issues rewatching. Dumb fun movies
I prefer the autobot comparison to "Bernie Sanders in a mech suit" lol
Dude I fell in love with Transformers because of those shitty movies, and even now I still love them. MAN they’re terrible.
Dark moon is my favourite transformer's movie
Funny you saying this is a “NASA movie” as I watched it in the Kennedy space center movie theater when it came out lmao
balrog wouldnt be call wing master because he cant fly
It makes no sense. This movie has some glaring issues, and yet I enjoy it for some reason. I was 14 when this came out, so I ate that shit up like it was soup and I'd been in line for the soup kitchen for 2 days.  "Time to find out" is still badass af though
19:50 god dam it why the bf4 music your gonna make me cry
Is nobody gonna talk about that one autobot who threw an entire Deception at a car that was been drived ? It’s so entertaining how the Autobots in the movie give absolutely no fuck about how they handle fights.
14:41 you forgot the funny sound he makes when hitting the decepticon
I liked the movie .. but getting rid of Megan fox was just so weird and did not fit.. Craxy how they kinda black mailed her and we really didn’t hear about hear till 2021.. she was supposed to be on big movies
The Transformers franchise truly reached its peak first with "Dark of the Moon" and then managed to keep the hot streak going with the "Age of Extinction", with the latter implementing a more serious tone and in my opinion the strongest antagonist of the franchise, Lockdown.
I'm of the opinion that the first three Transformers movies were great but I grew up with them.
my favorite pat is when optimus prime said "it's primin time" and the proceded to prime all over the decepticons
Wait... they got the astronaut that actually went to the moon? That just blew my mind.
“damn, it really be like that.”
Chang never dies, he made a song about it in season 1 of Community
i remember watching this as a teen in IMAX and looking over at my mum in the final section with the battles and stuff and she was just..asleep lmao.
😑 ok mister nobody even tho your wrong
There’s been other movies that have pushed pg-13 to limits even more. Alien vs Predator comes to mind
Patrick Dempsey. Not Patrick Swazye
NOT a SINGLE mention of the highway scene? Some of the most flawless CGI in history?!  Otherwise great vid and I agree for the most part. That finale of DotM still had to much focus on the humans, than on the Transformers, like, we barely see them fight but more how the human soldiers prepare to fight. "How did the Autobots get captured?" is an example.
Violent or not, we all know that sentinel totally deserved it
I will always point out background Halo 2 Peril music
I would love that to happen to Pokemon the manga was brutal so why not
I agree with secretly liking this movie. Every once in a while I go back and just watch the lasts 3rd. It's the best part of bayformers
“YOU DIE.” *proceeds to tear Shockwave’s spine out from his eye* - Optimus “GIVE ME YOUR FACE” Prime, 2011
when you went from talking pokemon to transformer bots, I realized you were way more stoned than I am 😅
War crimes don’t exist in space
I never knew this movie had an alternate original ending but it sounds so much better than Optimus just fucking murdering Megatron. Like I feel like a few somber, brotherly words between them and Megatron expressing his exhaustion and Optimus extending the olive branch would’ve been so much more satisfying. The two who led this war so long both agreeing that it’s gone too far. Especially since then they could’ve continued the series in a different direction like a rogue splinter group of decepticons instead of whatever the fuck everything from 4 afterwords was about.
“Or that the city happens to be in Chicago”  I died, take my sub.
I love how the movie wanks off nasa but they ouldve easily said the USSR had a secret manned mission to grab the pillar but they couldnt stand 2 make NASA look bad at all
Cody why are you doing this?
Its not blood its tranny fluid😂😂
The last actually good transformers bay movie
Patrick Dempsey lol, not swazey.
so basically the last hour is just the average battlefield match. got it
I don’t miss the constant 360° shots, I do miss the Linkin Park endings though
Ah yes warcrimes the only thing transformers did in the past 6 million years
The first one and Age of Extinction are the only ones I like.
THEY DID NOT MAKE A BLUETOOTH SPEAKER TRANSFORMER 👀 SAY IT AIN'T SO
Transformers 3 and 4 are my favorites beside the first one. I'm getting prepared to get jumped by all the haters now.
So, are we going all the way through this together?
Neil was probably just like “hell yeah space robots” and did the movie
I loved the first 3 movies
Ok but the Dark of the Moon game was 🔥🔥
Kong: Skull Island was another movie that should've been rated R but was PG-13. There's a scene where a guy gets impaled through the mouth and out the back of his head by a giant spider leg. It was a dead-on shot of it and in full light. A guy got pelted into a wall and exploded from the grenades in his hand. I think it had enough swearing to stop it from being PG-13 too
small point on the conspiracy section: the reason it isnt explained how the russians got the engine part is because the decepticons are the ones who planted it there in the first place. they wanted the autobots to find it so they can resurrect sentinel prime
In this movie, Optimus rips Megatron's head and spine from his body, turns around, and executes Sentinel at point-blank range while he was begging for mercy.   It's funny how at 14 that was great banter, but now is honestly a little shocking.
As a Nascar fan, seeing Jimmie Johnson, Dale Jr, and Pablo Montoya as transformers made my eyes light up!
It's not blood,but cranberry juice 🧃.
Fukn fox mccload
If a transformer loses parts in battle would that technically mean they wouldn’t be able to transform into a complete vehicle form? I never get that, you’d think if they lose an arm or a few doors in battle they’d either not be able to transform or would miss a few parts while in vehicle form right?? Imagine being a transformer being forced to retreat, and going into vehicle mode to find out your missing 3 wheels lol
Is it weird that I love Tevenge of the fallen
That’s what Chicago looks like today lmfao
I love the initial trilogy of Bayformer movies, but honestly I still see Age of Extinction (4) with "rose-tinted glasses" so to speak, so seeing you rip the film to shred at some point will be eye-opening.  Side note, I still remember me and my dad (who showed me the Bayformers movies growing up) in an otherwise empty theater ripping TLK to shreds and laughing about/at it
I remember back in a time when I was watching Transformers 3 seeing Sentinel Prime commit war crimes
Don't worry, there are millenials that will defend the Star Wars prequels to their dying breath. We can all enjoy some shitty fast food media sometimes.
SENTINEL PRIME GOT WHAT HE DESERVED. Optimus Prime is a hero for what he did, never forget that.
This was the last movie i ever attendted in theaters that felt like a true summer blockbuster. Easily my favorite transformers movie and since im from Chicago, it holds a special place in my heart.
First minute was such a humorless take it made me regret clicking on the thumbnail
I neeed 4
In the 1986 movie they offlined plenty of bots and beast wars
In the 1986 movie they offlined plenty of bots and beast wars
When Optimus Prime said "It's Transforming time!" and transformed all over them, it moved me to tears. Truly the movie of all time.
*Earth is like a weird grape.*
"Yes."  —Bilbo Baggins
"If you won't say the n-word, then I guess I'll have to kill you." - The Supervillain, I Think. Idk I never watched this movie.
I woulda loved for that moment of enemies realizing that the fight doesn’t need to continue today. Like optimus coulda been like “ayo megatron you helped me out. Pretty cool of you so Ima give you a pass on this one. But you do anymore bad things imma get ya.”  But no instead we get optimus executing the fuck outta him. Feels bad but I also love it lol
all i remember from this movie is "deep wang"
Revenge of the fallen so forgettable that I thought the third one was the second one
This franchise is a light-year away from perfect, but if I'm honest, Dark of the Moon was the best one out of the 5
Would you believe me if I told you that it was thanks to Amazon for bringing the 4th and 5th movies. Yes. 2 weeks before revenge of the fallen, Amazon released a comic series showing THE END OF THE MOVIE SERIES. So Michael Bay had to push it back and re-did the ending to setup the 3rd movie. But no, AMAZON DID IT AGAIN AND MADE MICHAEL BAY REDO A REALLY GOOD ENDING OF THE MOVIE SERIES!!!
Why the hell does a machine species bleed? I thought the Transformers were synthetic life forms
That wasn’t blood that came out of megatron that was red energon, also keep in mind the body of a cybertronian isn’t completely made of blue energon from head to feet.
Not gonna lie i really enjoyed every single transformer movies, for me it's like a rollercoaster of action, u turn off the brain and turn on the movie
Is this Nick from Nick's strength and power?
ill never get over how much american military propaganda there is in these movies
I love how transformers movies have 0 regards for continuity. How many times has Cybertron been destroyed? Why Bumblebee can talk but then can't?
When Q was executed, it kind of reminded me of the scene where Murphy was executed in Robocop.
Patrick Swayze...
The Trilogy is total perfection. robots blow shit up and I'm happy lol. Besides it Michael Bay. What did people expect?
"Somehow he returned", nah to cheesy, "Somehow they must have gotten that fuel rod" is where its at 🤣
(24:45) And don't forget Transformers: The Last Knight, which was even WORSE!
Sometimes I forget mlp and Transformers are from the same company because Bay's films overshadowed the cartoons
I unironically think that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Sure, you can argue about the plot but I don't even give a little shit about it. I enjoyed every single second of dark of the moon and it's one of my favourite movies of all time to this day!
Crimeptimus Prime
I was like 8 when this came out and I can still remember my dad went to see it in theatres before me because he wanted to make sure it was safe for me to see. I was a huge Optimus fan and when the ship got shot down I literally cried my eyes out in the theatre only for him to come back and unleash the greatest display of ass whooping in movie history
Yeah Age of Extinction after is kinda ehhh.. I honestly say that Dark of the Moon is better. I am a Shockwave fanboy after all. But I am also a huge fan of Crosshairs and Drift. They kind of make Age of Extinction worth it for me. Can't wait to see that.  About Revenge of the Fallen, though, Jetfire was the best part of that movie.
I like all the transformers movies :D
What was that pokemon shit bro?
0:45 oh so like the manga?
Whichever writer came up with "Somehow they picked up that fuel rod", was the same writer for Rise of Skywalker's "Somehow Palpatine returned"
Correction: Patrick Swayze = Patrick Dempsey
The only reason the transformers movies did as bad as they did is bc ppl forgot it was a Michael Bay film and watched it for anything other than the visual effects and sound effects
I love this movie. Where  else do you have wing suiting into chicago and out of ospreys and aliens. Dude thats childhood
HUGE props to you for using Spyro 2 music!!!
The saving grace of bad movies worldwide...  Being fun and cool... if you can even call it that
Is that Michael Imperioli?
On the beginning hook, where you make the comparison to Pokémon and how crazy it’d be if the first new Pokémon media after like a decade was one where many Pokémon canonically died, I do think the comparison falls apart a little because of one tiny detail.   Transformers have been killing off their characters for years.   Granted they often are like marvel comic deaths in terms of how much they stick, but it’s been a thing they were even kind of known for at one point.   The war crimes thing is kind of new but it wouldn’t surprise me if some of the old shows had some similar stuff.
I completely forgot this movie had a plot, I just thought the Chicago battle was cool
Props for the Spyro soundtrack👌
Buzz has voicelines in mass effect 3, and it's pretty cool !
Revenge of the fallen was the best movie of the franchise. Sure if you watched the cartoon the first one will be appealing but the storyline as well as characters will always be far more superior in fallen than the first movie. You got sam and mak, the roomate, the twin cars, jet fire, the fallen who was a prime worth remembering rather than sentinel. Megatron had arguably his best morph which was the jet engine tank thing. You had the cia agent turned auto bot, the rail gun on the pyramid. That movie was the centrepiece of my childhood. And I was 9 when I watched the first one
Deep wang
TF3 fucking rules. Weirdo TF stans can whine all they want about Bay. I'm here for America's premiere action auteur doing his thing. And he does his thing the best in TF3. Everything you say in your intro: it's crass, really violent, and kinda depressing - is EXACTLY what makes it so fucking fun.   TF3 is a near perfect synergistic display of Bay's filmmaking craft up this point. Wacked out humor, over the top characters, insane carnage on an epic scale - give me the spectacle of TF3 over pretty much any bland CGI wallpaper Marvel shits out every 2 weeks. Oh, and Bay's Ambulance is one of the best films of the year btw. So jot that down.
Allow me to tell you how i have watched this movie about 20+ times and loved it every time.
Fuck y’all revenge of the fallen was awesome
It’s like when people talk about bayformers they leave out the bits that explain why the movie is good so they just cherry pick things out of context to make a video.
its not a war crime if cybertron didnt sign on the geneva convention. and seeing how the war started near as makes no difference 4 million years before their name probably isnt on the document
I am not gonna lie, I shed a tear when Ironhide died.
Intimidate lowers attack and is an ability so it can’t be “used.”
The whole trilogy is basically transformers becoming more and more americans, from invading countries to commiting war crimes
I don’t know how I haven’t found this channel until now… this is the absolute definitive take on this movie. Also, “you’ll never see her again until like 2022 when she’s with MGK for some reason” is exactly what happened to Megan Fox lmaooooo.
It may be the fact I watched them a long time ago but every transformers movie was cool for me
I love how I said "what the fuck" perfectly in sync with Jontron in exactly the same tone. That was indeed very what the fuck worthy. Seriously, what the fuck?
Alternate history guy is that you?
Optimus In "Transformers": "War has doomed our people, we must find a better way--and yet, how can we not fight in the face of this injustice? Truly war is a prison for our hearts and minds."  Optimus in "Transformers 3": "LET'S DO THE WHOLE FUCKING VILLAGE."
Patrick Dempsey not SWAYZE
i used to like this movie as a kid when it came out. i still do but ik its ass, but its the right kind of ass. like sharknado ass where its so bad its good
"oh look, Patrick swazey" *Lewiston Maine didn't like that*
You know, I enjoyed these movies as pointless action CGI spectacles. but some of them actually could have had good stories. The Moon conspiracies and the Dan Brown style King Arthur nonsense could have been really good, but the writers fumbled it.
Remember 9/11? Yeah, transformers did that.
When you make a 25 minute video feel like 5. Sir that deserves a like and subscribe
Being a huge transformers fan. It was interesting of how different the deceptions and auto bots look. After 3 they started looking more human which was an L. But being that deceptions are like a different race of transformers, their design was actually captivating for an artist such as me
Idk how to feel about you downplaying Jazz getting ripped in half, that was one of the most brutal parts of the movie
What's the end song?
Wait where did those Pokémon animations at the beginning come from
The original movie in the 80s was pretty violent.
it's really not that deep. these movies, like you said, are made for teenage boys
Pls upload more Cody I’d rather have you voice knowledge hub then the other lol
The major problem with transformers is that the transformers themselves are SECONDARY characters to their own movie. The humans were too much of a focus (Sam  has hours of screen time while Optimus is under an hour), hell even in the new bumblebee movie the deceptions were still pretty undermined but they were still utilized well enough as villains.
“The most violent pg13 movie I can think of-“ Somebody hasn’t watched the breaking Dawn duology where the last act of part 1 becomes a horror film where a girl has to be ripped open by knife then by mouth to get the baby out of her belly-then you have part two with its final act having people literally doing mortal Kombat fatalities.
"hey it's war crime if u lose " Optimus lol
2:52 Throwback to the farmhand-hobbit iteration of Jay.
meanwhile in pg-13 rated anime: rape, incest, nudity, sexual content
Patrick who?
I liked the first 3, should've left it as a trilogy
which Transformers that they genocide the whole 'enemy' planet?
Digimon>>>Pokemon
I'll note that you've just made the case for why Dark of the Moon is the worst of the Bay Transformers movies. I mean I thought it sucked badly I liked Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon is just BAD even the soundtrack is bad
havent seen the movie or any reviews, so that might be common knowledge, but do the tires @17:14 clip through zhe throne?
Comparing TF 3 to TF4 is definite proof that there is a right and wrong way to write a stupid story. TF3 is pretty entertaining and fun
Doesn't know formatting and doesn't know fascism. Typical
People get disintegrated, 0/10
I think Shockwave and optimus are the only ones who's designs read well and match up with their g1 counterparts
Pg-13 pushed its limits in transformers 2, not transformers 3.
Megatron's death was pretty sad for me.
Essentially what the u.s does often
About the pillars they stole the ones that were brang to earth and used them to open the portal allowing the rest of the decepticons with the other pillars to go to earth and then spread them out
Semi related: It breaks my heart that the Bumblebee movie bombed because Bay sucked the life out of the franchise and no one went and saw it, but it was such a good, heartfelt movie made by people who were obviously fans.
What pissed me off about the Chernobyl incident in TF3 was  1; why wasn't the Tech removed when the USSR fell or when the Reactor blew up.  2. They're litterally in a room with melted graphite rod sludge everywhere. Which is litterally what the elephant's foot is. Crazy radioactive. Even with PPE.  3. They take their fucking masks off when the big worm leaves. It litterally has just disturbed dirt that's been sitting and sucking radiation up for 40 years. All that dust you see kicked up. Is 100% got enough radioactive material in it to cause some serious problems for anyone nearby without ppe.  Oh let's just take our masks off and breath in all that radioactive goodness
I kinda like this movie too don’t worry
I quit after "The VLA detected an impact on the dark side of the Moon during the Kennedy administration." Nothing in that premise makes sense.
You know what, I have a weird understanding on the fact that the guy who made Schindler’s List got apparently pissed enough to fire an actress from a film franchise because she compared the director of the film franchise to Hitler of all people. On the other hand I’m constantly just at awe about how much of a simp Spielberg is for Michael Bay. I mean good god I swear that Bay would not have survived the early 2000s if it wasn’t for Spielberg.
If that other ending happened, the movie would’ve prob been given an Oscar nod lmao
8:04 Was that blood? I'd just assume that it was transmission fluid since they transform into cars and transmission fluid is blood red.
I remember being in the theaters and seeing the trailer for Dark of the Moon  But the original trailer didn't make it clear it was a transformers film initially. So you see the Apollo astronauts land on the moon and find this massive alien ship and you're all hyped and then you see it's a Transformers movie and your hype dies
Thank you for giving the deserved respect to Ironhide
One of my favorite Optimus Toys is one where he is coloured in Camo and his trailer is carrying a nuke. The trailer can transform in to a launch platform or in to a mobile rocket that Optimus can carry. It's like if Optimus went past choosing violence and just had enough of Megatrons Sh*t.
I HATE film critics they make it seem like small details are BIG OMGGG THEY DIDNT EXPLAIN THAT MOVIE BAD😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡, like bro i only want to be entertained and mans acting like its a big problem
Well I'm happy for the lucky some bitch in the Dimension next to us that gotnthe better ending to the film lucky bastard
The answer to why Megatron didn't use his army til the 3rd movie , you have to play your cards. You can't use your ultimate weapon at the beginning.
I was kind of shocked when this came out. It was pretty dark
Once again another awesome breakdown! Also, I am so glad that my video helped you out!
I bought his book, but it was too late. 😖
Yeah Optimus in this movie let thousands of humans die just to prove a point.
Idc I’ll always be a transformers fan no matter how bad the movie is.
10:28 We had animal transformers in the 90s
This guy sounds familiar. Does he also have the channel "AlternateHistoryHub"?
I remember tearing up when Ironhide died watching this as a kid. I also remember tearing up watching it as an adult.
I actually like the transformers movies....
I enjoyed the movie, but I get why others don't.
I stan War Crime Prime
absolutely love this film
That part at 19:14 where you used the weapon sounds from the Transformer DS games brought back so many memories, my goodness.
I love the Spyro music in the background (:
It is pretty funny how the transformer deaths transitioned to look like human gore with orange molten metal and shit
That one scene when Optimus was sliding across the road cutting down Decepticons with epic music in the background forever remains as one of my favorite movie scenes
Patrick swayze???
Don't worry I also enjoyed it
I feel exactly the same about this movie. It’s cool but it could have been so much better.
I loved this movie!
I remember watching this movie in a drive through movie theatre. They also played Kung Fu Panda 2.
17:07 when i watched the movie as a kid, i genuinely cried over Ironhide's death, it was one of my favorites Transformers of all time
Tbh I liked this one, despite its issues it had solid action scenes, and as the title suggests pushed the rating. Humans getting disintegrated and turning to piles of bones was awesome.
There's no such thing as war crimes in Transformers 3!
Dark of the Moon was actually my favourite Transformers film from 2011. I can get why everyone was sceptically about the third one as the second film was a mess. But I was quite surprised with what Michael Bay was able to do and Dark of the Moon is definitely an improvement from the second film
21:57  sad you didn't include "GIVE ME YOUR FACE"
“Aw shit I’ve seen this one. This is the one where Spock goes nuts.”    Best quote in the film because Leo Nimoy voices Sentinel.
were you planning on doing transformers 4? :)
I don't get why they didn't just keep Mikaela as a character but with a different actress in Transformers 3 ngl
0:34 they got Christopher on his way to boost those pokeman cards
Wasn’t expecting a manitowoc minute cameo tbh
Turn the playback to 1.25x for normal speed
BRUTAL VIOLENCE!!! YES!!!!!!!!
Tbh I grew up with the Bay trilogy, and I love DOTM, is it perfect? God no, but there’s a lot to like about it.
LETS BE HONEST BAY .. well hes kinda of a creep
I'm honored that the picture you most associate with Chicago is deep-dish pizza.
I think I was terrified back in the day when I first watched this. When they started shooting civvies it just hit a different cord in me around that time. Never did like vaporization as a weapon in any movie. Just gave me wrong kind of goosebumps. Same reason why I found the war of the worlds scary.
Saw this movie as something to do on a summer afternoon with my cousins. It was the most miserable moviegoing experience I'd ever had. Welp, at least until I saw Hereditary years later.
I also like Transformers 3. Sentinel is the best villain in the whole series because everything he wants to accomplish makes sense and his betrayal is actually pretty logical   He sees that the war is going to destroy Cybertron so he plans to betray his own to bring the war to a decisive end. Then he wants to sacrifice the Earth to bring Cybertron back and essentially save the Transformer species.  This is a character that cares about his people and only ever wanted them to thrive. He is a Prime. Just a darker reflection of Optimus. Which makes him the most interesting.
Bumblebee > Age of Extinction > 1 > Dark of the Moon > Revenge of the Fallen > Last Knight
When I saw this movie as a kid, Ironhide's death actually traumatized me for a while.
The 86 animated movie is the only one that matters....
i love how he casually calls Patrick Dempsey Patrick Swayze
The space industrial complex deserves to be glorified.
I actually like lots of stuff in the first half. Mostly because Bay's slightly psychopathic view of humanity makes for pretty entertaining characters.
why do i hear Spyro world music in the background?
I understand this is about transformers, but I had to comment on that pokemon opening, I hate how overrated that franchise is.  Pokemon has been the biggest dumbing down of adventure games in history. Ridiculous premise, kid uses pet animals to fight other pet animals from other people for fame and recognition, most basic gameplay ever until auto clickers were invented, laughable dialogue... And on top of that, a scam sold in two or three different versions so collectors buy it more than once.   The ONLY good thing was the variety of monsters. That's it. And 70% of them are uninspired versions of real animals with barely any change anyway. Without the show it would have died in like 3 or 4 years like every other mediocre game.
Lowkey, wanna see someone compare this movie to the G1 show. I'm sure it's a thing! It's just funny to imagine a Saturday morning cartoon about action figure robots blasting each other and getting into slapfights compared to Space Robot Murderfest 3.
i never noticed that when megatron sits on the statue his wheels clip through the concrete by multiple inches 17:14
So glad I only knew Transformer Prime instead of this at the time.
I remember my parents wouldn’t let me watch the third film because “even the robots had blood coming out of them!”
Lol Patrick Swayze, aka Patrick Dempsey
My favorite military propaganda.
I didn’t know about that alternate ending… I hate Dark of the Moon now. I saw this movie in theatres when I was 8 and in that moment when Megatron saves Optimus I thought, “wow Megatron is actually a cool guy. Maybe there can peace.” Then I was shocked! Shocked I tell you, to then view Optimus rip his head off. And now I learn there was almost an actual perfect ending. Hopefully the new movies deliver where these ones have failed.
I’m an inventor they said 🤣🤣
The end of transformers 3 is were its at fr tho.
I remember laughing really hard at wangs death when this movie came out and everyone just stared at me like I was insane.
I think they just wanted to make Optimus really badass they didn’t even realize they were making him a homicidal war criminal lol
Optimus, as the rightful ruler of Cybertron, did not murder an unarmed prisoner. He executed a traitor responsible for attempted genocide.
the building falling for about 10 minutes pushed my limits
im so glad that im not the only one who thought theyre faces were too human and even the next movies made it look even more human. i mean look at drift
24:31 run
Damn I really like revenge of the fallen, I'm writing this very early into the video, but like, why does everyone hate it so much? I really like revenge of the fallen
Shockwave has always been a menace lmao
tf3 was probably my favorite one
So why didn't we get the original ending, an actual good ending to a trilogy?
Dawg this a movie about robots blowing shit up you a little to hurt over Meg not being in the 3rd 🤣
The biggest crime is that the left made them gay
The name  Ehren Kruger is so fucking hilarious
The ending we got was so anticlimactic because of how abruptly it ended with no epilogue to go with it.
Now it's time for the phase "2" of transformers films, which unfortunately for Bay ended up skipping 2 phases and landed square in the MCU Phase 4 hell.
HOLY SHIT THATS NOT WHAT INTIMIATION DOES YOU LINT LICKER!!  It lowers attack, *adjusts glasses*
I remember that Ryan Gosling movie.
Surprised there isn't a cut to when Optimus shows up and flat-out says "We will kill them all" you know right before the Autobots proceed to draw and quarter and enemy combatant stating "this is going to hurt".
I love how terrifying they made Laserbeak in this film.
It would be cool if Optimus killed Megatron not with anger but with decorum "you cannot walk away from this nor be judged by the laws of this world" Also autobots are not rebels they are monarchists, deceptions are rebels and they are very popular with general population of Cybertron problem is that they are nazbol.
I heard that ty He PG-13 rating was created because of Star Trek II; The Wrath if Khan, so movies pushing the limits of the ratings is nothing new.
no cgi today is as god as transformers decades ago
For the first time in my life I want to watch a transformers movie
Man, shuddup and watch the movie
I never looked into it, but I definitely noticed how much it felt like Carly was meant to be Mikaela. Her dialog with Megatron is definitely more something Mikaela would know to do than Carly.
I have literally been saying this for years. I wrote an essay about it earlier this year lol
I don't really remember this movie much, but I remember not liking it much. I need to rewatch it. That original ending sounds pretty awesome and I wish they kept it.
so… unpopular opinion. this is my favorite movie of all time😂
“GIVE ME YOUR FACE.” -Optimus Prime, the good guy.
“From Obama? In this office we’re mostly republicans” is such a good line
Something I do when watching transformers is just focus on the transformers
Fun fact and why I've binged nearly every video on this channel: I've thrown out movies from my collection because as an adult I realise how bad they are and to make space they include: Transformers 4 and 5, I kept 2 and 3 just for original trilogy sakes White House down Prometheous  Battle Los Angeles Battleship  Bourne legacy(can't remember if this was overly bad or not, but for the sake of original trilogies, it went) Die hard 4(good god what a terrible movie)  The first released justice league after I bought the synder cut All of the American pies after 1, 2 and 3 except the reunion  I stopped buying fast and furious films after 7 thank god, 6 and 7 are passable 😬   I think that's it & I also watched these videos because the editing is top notch & I've laughed alot during them
Wait till you get to the next two movie and figure out that Autobots have been around since The Revolutionary War, or Samurai Times/Industrial Japan.
I think I can answer who was the NASA nut in the production.   Peter Cullen, the voice actor of Optimus prime is a MASIVE space and nasa guy. He support nasa youth programs to encourage kids to get into space. He said meeting Buzz Aldrin was one of the greatest honours of his life. It actually really cute listening to him talk about space stuff. He’s such a sweet old man.  https://youtu.be/T5GkeWPcAWs (this is just a Q&A but it’s Peter Cullen, and who doesn’t want to hear him speak more.)  Also Buzz only agreed to do this because the conspiracy wasn’t about his life’s greatest accomplishment being a hoax.  The reason space propaganda is fine but not military is because one actually does something more then exploit political unrest to steal oil. As a not Amarican, I respect Nasa because they actually do something the benefits everyone by collecting knowledge and inventing cool stuff. Watching amarican military propaganda is just cringe.
You tricked me into watching a 25 min video instead of making dinner. How dare you
It’s not blood it’s transmission fluid but I get why you’re saying that
Pokemon is a fad. No one likes Pokemon go because Charizard has a great character arc or has good powers. It's a gimmicky app similar to geocaching that only caught on because fandoms never die and it still had old fans.
I hate this movie... but I really like this line:  "Who would you be without me, Prime?" "Time to find out!" * _murders him_ *
17:16 so we just gon ignore how megatrons feet are clipping through the monument?
You know, I never understood why they didn't just recast Mikaela with the model, instead of just yeeting the character from the story entirely. Seriously, Megan Fox and the model looked similar enough to where I would have bought it. It just makes the relationship being built for the last two movies awkward.
8:18 what about hollywood homocide? It fetures multiplue killings, a mass shooting in a night club, drug use, fights, car chases, the n word, and worst of all, josh hartnett
I liked revenge of the fallen lmao   Dark of the moon was amazing though tbh
Why hasn't youtube freaking recommended me this channel yet
This was a perfect summer blockbuster love it
16:34 I have that figure, Roller
Forgot to mention the fact that Megan Fox quit Transformers because she supposedly hated Michael Bay, but was happy to work with him again for not one, but two Ninja Turtles movies.
They got to be brutal and gruesome as possible because they robots so it’s all good 😁👍
I love for, about 3 seconds.. I wondered if that was you looking at Ole Slappy, then I realized im really high on weed.
I would have enjoyed the final Chicago war zone more if it didn't drag on for so long, like it really jumps between characters. I remember one scene where the main military guy literally just bumps into a whole squad of dudes just sitting around waiting for orders while the entire battle has been raging for like 20 minutes already, and then they all have to rush off and do some other thing while the robots are still fighting.
I gotta be honest, as depressing as these movies (especially this one) are, I kinda like parts of that. Should preface this by saying im conflicted about it mainly bcuz of the horrid writing for half of it and the fact that it’s blatant military propaganda- BUT I do like the idea of optimus losing his patience with how the autobots are treated by the same people they save. Look man, even a guy as great as optimus has to have his limits, and humans continuously mistreating the autobots and even occasionally siding with the decepticons would be a fairly realistic breaking point. Honestly with how many close friends he loses to both the decepticons and then to humans themselves, and how many times humans betray him and kick him while he’s down, I’m surprised he still bothers to help as much as he does. I suppose you could theorize towards the end he’s doing it more to hinder the decepticons than out of genuine care for humans, and that could be totally true- I’d still say that’s reasonable at this point. If I were in his place I’d probably do worse cuz MAN humans treated their saviors like absolute shit in these movies
i was young when i first say transformers so i look at it with rose tinted glasses but man i love that shit
Is that toy story (pc game) soundtrack I hear???
I don't know what's more insane; the fact that you included a single-millisecond-long clip of Bryan Cranston screaming like a girl DEEP in the mix at 7:05... or the fact that I recognized it.
I always thought it was oil, and transmission fluid not blood.
Love this movie
I experienced physical pain whenever someone calls Sunbow G1 "the original series". The cartoon first aired Sept 17 1984 whereas Marvel Transformers #1 dropped May 8. The life-giving macguffin being ferried about by a human plotline is even a straight rip of issues #5-12.
The fact he rebuttals his first statement with his same statement killed me 💀🤌🏼
I love dark of the moon
Cody! it took me a couple seconds to recognize your voice lmao. found this randomly through the algorithm.
I like it too
i dont care, i love this movie. its the best of the trilogy (4 and 5 don't count -- they're barely even movies), and you just listed off why i love it. brutal violence, funny designs, aridiculous conspiracy, a plot device that actually comes from Transformers G1. its awesome. and i love that optimus just runs up to shockwave says "you die" and rips his eye out.
The funniest part is buzz was already old when transformers came out so he was probably like “oh I think my grandkids might have played with those”
Glad your channel was recommended!
Actually the fact that you were honest about *and* recognised your injoymet for ti's bad movie for what it made your credibility swell up in my eyes! Too may dumbos out there seem to think if they have good emotions form badly made entertainment the only explanation is that it actually really well made and all it's critics are just stupid and racist or some sh%t So good on you for being more mature then kindergartener 👍
The fact that there is a youtube channel called Trans Theories and it's about Transformers instead of the other stuff is utterly hilarious to me
The autobots fight to preserve classist slavery on cybertron
I really hope you keep this going. I never saw 4 or 5. But would love to watch you tackle them.
Yeah, like, you think Dark of the Moon is bad at first, but then the next 2 movies release, and it ends up being one of your more fond of memory movies.
I've watched this movie a good ten times and every time I forget that sam's boss is john malkovich.
I’m surprised it’s not rated R lol
Nobody else but me noticed he called Patrick Dempsey Patrick Swayze huh??? lol
They legit had amazing concepts, ideas, and action sequences that got shat on by Michael Bay. This series had serious potential.
My dark secret is that I love revenge of the fallen
Honestly, with how brutal Optimus Prime was getting, I was having high hopes for the more idealistic Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime we might get later on to take over.  AAAAAAAnd then they ruined Hot Rod.
Pokémon is the biggest franchise on planet earth by far. Nothing comes close. And in second place is hello kitty. Pokémon is worth around 101 billion, hello kitty is worth around 70 billion. I think the next franchise in in the 40 billion range.
should i sub to you yes or no
Transformers 1 and 3 are my favorite movies
Out of the first 3 this one  is the best to me.
Y'all remember when Michael Bay had Megan Fox dance in a skimpy outfit under shower of water?  Oh, but she wasn't aloud to drink in the scene, because she was FIFTEENTH!! Yeah, he's a massive creep
NASA is part of the military industrial complex. I feel like people constantly forget that NASA is military.
Ironhide dying is what got me the most tho
Best quote of the whole franchise has to be "NOOO OPTIMUS!!!!"
I thought it was going to be hard for Otpimus's hate filled violence to top TF2's "GIVE ME YOUR FACE" but then TF3 achieved in spades. I can remember watching this in the theater (the last one I went to the theater for) and at multiple points thinking "JEBUS, if this wasn't a robot it would be beyond Braveheart gnarly!"
I remember having been a big fan of Transformers: Animated, which had been cancelled about two years before this movie came out.  Well, one of the reoccurring characters in that show was Sentinel Prime, he was Optimus’s rival, and a bit of an egotistical show off, who always wanted to put Optimus in his place. But when things got serious, he was always one of the first to fight alongside Optimus, even if he was still giving him a hard time while fighting. He wasn’t a bad person, or really even annoying, the show did what it could to make it clear that the two just had personal history together.  So imagine how a 12-year-old me felt, seeing the only other version of this character I’d ever seen, with this movie, and watching Optimus Prime literally execute him.
The Movie was terrible. But it's fun to watch, and that's worth quite a bit in the end. I don't go into it expecting something profound, it's a movie about giant robots fighting and that's exactly what we get
So the ship had the Laplace's box?
What I think would be really cool, not that it will ever happen … If they released dark of the moon with the original ending as like may be a gift to hard-core fans. I would appreciate that at least.
in that movie Ironhide's that made me wanna commit some warcrimes of my own lol
Don’t disrespect Swayze
When you started talking about Pokémon off the start I had to check what video I clicked on I won’t lie.  ALSO, while the soundtrack sounds good it is horribly written from a thematic standpoint.
Yea I mean he’s the director of Schindler’s List
This is Hilarious
That Megatron death was the biggest blueball tease with the worst outcome I had ever sat through.
I enjoyed the second one and i saw it in theaters at the time
All I'm saying is Romeo and Juliet law in tf4 is the only thing I remember
They did Ironhide dirty.
I used to watch this movie religiously lol it was just such a good time 😂😅
Nice, someone talking about transformers without bitching and moaning through the whole video, have a like
Learning that Speilberg was the one who was upset about Megans Hitler comments is so fucking funny to me. Bay's like "eh shes always a b****"  but Speilberg? Tsk tsk. Thats different money lol
I liked revenge of the fallen lmao
At 7:50 min mark was the moment I decided to go rewatch this film
Patrick Dempsey, not Swayze. Wow, can’t believe you let that slip, even in this reupload man.
This was the best transformers movie.
Dark of the moon is amazing no joke
This movie had literally given me vibe of apocalypse more than those zombie movies couldn't Heck they even had me worried at Bumble Bee execution Even my kid brain could calculate that no one could rescue BB at that time No one could make it in time and I really worried becuz I thought Optimus was the protg and you know since they really dare to kill off Ironhide(which still traumatized me as a kid seeing someone rotting to dead)
I like all the transformers movies. Even though they all suck except for bumblebee 😛
This whole, “it’s just too brutal and real” take seems kinda…weird. The original really just took “war” and made it something that it isn’t.
22:43Yup, I heard that, and I was like, I wish this was the ending we get instead what we got in reality
Optimus in these movies is such an awful person. Speaking nice cliches about peace and etc, then killing everyone in sadistic manner.
“Cool military guys ride motorcycles and say woo”. Have you ever seen Marines in combat? They’re screaming woo the whole time
But transformer was a war film, hell a war saga, hell were toys of robots who were at war. It was literally built on the concept of war.
22:19 when you foq around
Megatron shoulda been the guy who stands up to the Autobots because his troops are too incompetent. In the Bay films, the other way around happens. Optimus is the guy who stands up to the Decepticons because his troops, aside from probably Bumblebee and Ironhide, are too incompetent. He needs to stand up to the 'cons so bad he's out-Megatroning Megatron.
The one thing that I could never forget about this movie was that the flying mechanical creatures they fought were also in the first Avengers film. When I watched the Avengers, it kinda made me 'wait a sec that looks familiar 🤔' LOL
17:48 derp question here but is this still from transformers? The quality felt strange. If not does anyone know where it comes from?
THE BEATS PILL
Maybe the DotM game explains a bit lol.
Some corrections:  1. The franchise was very much alive between the 80s and the first movie. The movie just made it blow up to become like a top 5-10 media franchise   2. Spielberg is still involved to this day and has produced every film   3.  The designs were fine in the first 3 movies actually. The series has always had cybertronians have cosmetics and features that resemble humans. The 4th and 5th movies were the ones that starting going too humanoid although the soft reboot films have gone back to cybertronian looking designs but a bit more smooth to resemble g1.  4. You can look it up but the timeline of 1-4 actually makes sense, but it isn’t explicitly explained that clearly in the movies.   5. The characterizations and screentimes were the only major nitpicks you could have with this movie as a lot of the traits and complexity of a lot of characters were taken away because of CGI budget and excessive human screentime. A lot of unique concepts and possible arcs never happened in the movies as a consequence and in the end only a small portion of the TF cast get any spotlight. This started improving in AoE though and IMO they’ve learned how to manage cast sizes. The franchise has a lot of good lore, politics, dynamics, and ideas they can draw from and combining that with the visuals and casts of the films would make some amazing movies
Can someone tell me the name of the song at 23:53
The moment marky mark came up in conversation when talking about transformers they shouldve stopped and rethought their whole lives.
i love all 3 just for the military porn.
19:55 and then Battlefield 2042 had the same idea
You should have mentioned that the 1986 movie had some over-the-top violence
My favorite part was when Optimus said “it’s transformin’ time”
lol you expect optimus to forgive deceptions after what they have done? especially sentinal killing ironhide? yea no.
Trans theories.... Sounds fishy
Somehow plappatine has returned...
I love this movie. Mean? Cruel? Spitting in the face of a series I love? Deserves my adoration. The action is so good, Simmons is the single best character in all of Transformers, Optimus is cool as fuck and spits some nasty one-liners. Bay is an auteur and that's on God. It doesn't feel like it's a movie playing it safe, it feels like a movie playing it for spite and hatred. More people need to appreciate that.
I'd hook up with that blue chick
I think thats what amazed me about this movie as a kid was the scale of the warzone that was Chicago nothing like id seen at the time
It pissed me off so much that they just disregarded Shockwave as a whole. He’s an amazing character in all other Transformers media. A megalomaniacal Decepticon who is arguably more powerful than Megatron and the others but with a dying loyalty to the cause and his science experiments, only to be turned into a non-speaking, borderline brain-dead, hulking monster with a giant scrap metal worm.
Now do the last knight, where tf were the knight formers in the trilogy
I almost made it to the end of no nostalgia critic November how could you
Nothing will surpass the 1986 animated film.
Wait, no, wait. Why isn’t the Balrog called Wing-Master? You’re spitting 📠
Bayverse was gift for kids who grew up watching Transformers Armada (2002) and Cybertron (2005) anime.
I am fan of Bayverse 👍
Ehren Kruger👀👀
For some reason because of this video youtube is trying to sell me Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal Skull, maybe do a video on that next?
Pokemon is designed for windowlickers.
How dare you I fucking love First Man. The fact Gosling didn't even get a nomination when Bradley Cooper did for A Star is Born and Rami Malek won for Bohemiam Rhapsody still makes my blood boil.
beautiful video
It would’ve been so much better if Megan was still on bruh
Megatron be playing 4d chess
That auto bot shuttle toy is sitting in my basement
The idea that Optimus goes from self-defense to I'm going to kill everyone here regardless of the circumstances is mighty amusing
Revenge of The Fallen was better.
That Mt Dew machine was the best part of the movie. Busts out into the street and starts thump thump thumping people.
This is the best transformers movie and I will always stand by that
The entire final battle had spec ops infiltration, flight suits, a burrowing snake and robot carnage… it should be loved just for the pure spectacle of it all…  But no, all the spectacle falls hollow because there is no investment in any of the characters.. its the same emptiness that took over the Fast franchise.
as a kid i always liked revenge because of devastator… then i got older and rewatched and realized how unbearable it is. but that’s why it worked… little kid sees cool giant robots fighting and even larger robot and are like “damnnnnnnnnn i want that toy for christmas”
Great video but implying that Shockwave's name is 'hilarious' is so bizarre to me. That's such a badass name like cmon
*Only in Chicago*
Theeateher
My favorite part about this movie is that it shows the decepticons just openly shooting civilians to ash while they're running away and its played off as this epic and cool thing happening.  How tf was this PG-13
Not a war crime if the bodies are not human 😉
Personally this was the first movie that I saw by myself in theaters and I felt really good for it.  But it was the first film that I began questioning why this movie is considered ok for families
Out of all the bayverse movies, dark of the moon is my favorite and I don’t care what anyone says
Unpopular opinion, but I feel Revenge of the Fallen was better than this one despite the whole “writer strike” ordeal. I feel the action became the main point of the movie and is the main reason why many people watched the franchise but the final action of the 3rd movie is very good
Honestly I like how it was violent I think you should stay that way. I mean that's just me though. It doesn't have to be but I like it
Unpopular opinion: I actually liked sentinel primes design
Me and my twin brother watched this movie literally every time we were riding in the car when we were kids. For that reason, the nostalgia factor plays a huge part for me when rating this movie
ik how bad this movie is yet it’s still one of my favorites of all time. i never watched transformers for the plot, i just enjoy big badass robots beating the shit outta eachother and for that reason i love this movie 😂
It’s time for some Optimus Crimes.
i think that transformers 3 is actually a spinoff and you should watch it as its own thing, not as a sequel
I really love how they didn't explained Soviets getting the part of the ship. My guess is that after like an age of Hollywood creating an image of Soviets and Russians being fucking cryptids, script writers just EXPECT viewers to believe we just can do whatever, no explanation needed.
ah yes, when i rewatch this movie I start it once they take the autobots to nasa to throw them back into space because that till the end is peak
Dark of the Moon is my favorite out of the 3
I love this movie I’ve watched it like thirty times
When Optimus said *Its optimum time* the whole cinema exploded
Thank god for Bumblebee. G1 looked fucking awesome.
Revenge of the fallen is a banger, don’t care what anyone says. Any movie that has a soundtrack revolving around a linkin park song gets an A+ in my book.
The transformers score has to be one of the most iconic modern soundtracks tbh. Like everyone’s heard arrival to earth at some point whether they’ve seen the movies or not
Honestly still love the first 3 transformers, amazing. Simply amazing.
don’t get her wrong, michael bay is definitely a piece of shit on set
16:19: "Somehow Palpatine retur- Wait a minute..."
This movie has my personal favorite version of the Bumblebee Camaro. Genuinely a good looking car
K bro your 60% in that's an F got finished the series for that A
Nasa films. Astronaut films wear thin. Really they flew off the premisis
From what I understand is Spielberg is Jewish and that’s why he understandably took the Hitler comment so harshly.
Man. That was a fun video
Oh no.
I thought the endless murdering of civilians by means of lasers and explosives by the decepticons right on the screen was the icing on the cake.
I grew up watching Pokémon.
I think alita battle angel is the most violent pg13 movie
8:17 "The most violent PG-13 movie I can think of" You haven't seen many movies, have you?
Listening to someone poke holes in my guiltiest of pleasures so I can lowkey relive it while Spyro music plays faintly in the background makes me feel like all is as it should be
One of the funniest things about these movies to me is that they bragged about having a room full of writers to make sure these movies stayed as one continuous narrative.
1:49 it's okay I kinda liked dark of the moon lol
1:24 5 holy words...
see i have an idea as to why the allspark and subsiquently megatron (and in this as well sentinal and the ship) went to earth. in transformers the last knight it is found out that the earth is unicron. unicron is basicaly a celestial being in terms of power. its possible that when the allspark was lost and was adrift it ended up being pulled to earth by a dormant unicron which leads to megatron tracking it and crashing into the earth as well. it is possible that the deal with megatron was a way to restore cybertron with the allspark so megatron left cybertron to get to the all spark with sentinal prime following him with the pillars so they can use the allspark wherever it ended up finding it to restore cybertron
Everytime i watch Dark i just imagine mikalah got a hair change and didnt go outside between the movies   I will never forgive them for killing Ironhide. FUCKING NEVER!  Edit: welp video is over...guess i have to subscribe so i can see him shit on the next film
Can confirm that as a Chicagoan this would really be traumatizing this is just a pretty average day. Maybe a little more gang violence than usual though.
As a teenage, the movie is awesome. The violences were so brutal, but it was dope. Fun times  edit: it is propaganda bit it was fun
I love how throughout all the movies in general Optimus just gets more and more sick of giving a fuck. To the point where even just in the fourth one he just storms TSI guns blazing blowing shit up.
And that immaculate highway chase
Anyone know what the outtro music that starts at 23:52?  It sounds so familiar, but can't place it.
Idk man, I think they just let the cameras roll in Chicago, then added some cgi for added effect and called it a day
Let's not all forget that bay included every hard-core republic's favourite trope: The military goes rogue. The strong handsome military boys who disobey orders to "do what the gubberment won't". Did it in revenge of the fallen too, now that I think about it.
Dark of the Moon is the hardest Transformers movie.
I love all the Transformers movies. I don't give a god damn what anyone says
The most confusing part of the movie was that they were going to enslave humanity to rebuild Cybertron. That's the equivalent of enslaving monkeys to build a Hadron collider.
Admittedly I actually loved this movie. The first was alright, the second was absolutely terrible, and the third was just action movie shlock, but damn it was fun.
I liked revenge of the fallen I care not
Are you the guy from Alternate History Hub?
"Whether unionized labour is to blame or not-" Spoiler alert, it wasn't 😅
I will admit this movie has flaws, but I love it. The TF films are more realistic to what a Transformers war would be like, property damage, military tactics, public fear and distrust, violent, TFs dying pretty quickly be getting blown apart. The story is bare bones abd vaguely connected, but is still somewhat cohesive and logical, or at least it is till you get to 4 and 5 adding back story that seems to contradict what was established or at least not explained well enough.
Call me a Bay apologist, but I love Bayverse Transformers (at least the "original trilogy", as I call it). Transformers should NOT be some goofy blocky robots with cheesy lines (cough, G1, cough) - they are freakin giant aliens made of living metal, they are, just by description, supposed to be war machines! Exactly the ones that Bayverse movies show us! With alien designs and their own language (which Decepticons prefer to speak, whereas Autobots adapted to speak English to be understood by humans)! Living robots, who have been at war for eons, which resulted in their home planet literally unable to sustain life, arriving to Earth and bringing their war here! The concept itself, by definition, should be dark and adult - and that is exactly what DOTM is, what all Bayverse movies strived to be!
The reason it ended how it did was also cause it was leaked.
19:51 haha that Battlefield music, BF 3 did a great job with the parachuting :D
Where my Midwest brothers and sisters at?
0:16 It's unfortunate to me just how (relatively) poorly Gen 5 sold. More of a Gen 4/6 guy, but Gen 5 is close.
The BF4 theme overlayed with the wingsuit scene fits too perfectly, lmao.
pg13 was never meant for children. In franchise land, a Teen is different to a child.
michael somehow managed to make shockwave actually look badass instead of just fucking him up and make him look absolutely nothing like shockwave   although he fixed that error by making him speak gibberish and 2 seconds of screen time
They bled in the g1 cartoons
Transformers 1,2,3 are CLASSICS. Mfs shit on them & act like the last bumblebee movies is great even tho nbdy on earth talks abt it cause its BORIIING. Tf 1,2&3 are retarded but honest & badass , perfect pop corn shit 🔥
It's kinda weird how this movie is the most *brrrr papapapa kaboom!* of the trilogy but does also contain the most well written villain in the trilogy and I love that
make one of these for transformers prime
Optimus prime rage scene is so cool
It is a grants Espiriti but it isn’t robots, but aliens
Dark of the moon is my favourite pink floyd album
You mean oil
Now that im an adult, yeah these movies sucked ig, but holy shit were they the coolest things ever when i was a kid. Michael Bay may not be able to write a story to save his life but there is nobody better than him at action scenes.
People who hate these transformers movies swear it’s apart of their personality idk why. I loved the movies, and obviously they’re separated so idk why people are upset that it’s different.
Watching robots fight and blow shot up is the reason we watch these. It's like Bruce Lee movies. Plot doesn't really matter. We literally mad a tape of just his fight scenes from all his movies back in the day, and watched that
7:42 - that's when the video really start. all the stuff in the beginning is just some rant you can skip.
For a guy with a channel called PointlessHub, you sure make a lot of good points. Especially 15:30 - 15:50
In an alternate timeline where cody makes videos on pop culture instead of historical events
Honestly these movies are the best when you just shut off your brain. Like who doesn't love explosions and big metal robots killing each other for world domination?
Epixi
The Wreckers made me so mad. they're so much cooler in the comics.
This is what we were waiting for
Can’t wait to come back in 6 months when this channel has 700k + subs, and say “yeah, I was here before 100k”
Oh so this is also the alt history guy
I dont know why people care about plot in the transformers movies I watched them for the fighting and explosions
You guys remember when Optimus said “we’re gonna kill them all.”  I digged that
dark of the moon is one of my favorite movies cuz i luve transformers but also i just watched it as a 4-5 year old twice a week or so
Personally I have only watched the first 3 transformers movies, and this is the only one where I found myself not skipping a scene due to it being cringe or annoying, in the first one it was the sam going to the lake with his buddy that disappears after that part of the film, for the second one was where Sam sperks out and starts rambling and drawing transformer siqns. Overall I found all 3 pretty good.
I loved the flms
Transformers has continued to exist after the 80s? Like the franchise has actually been very healthy even when not at the heights of its original run.
Bumblebee has the best cgi transformers
Hey I liked the revenge of the fallen
My Anarcho communist anti-american empire ideology when I watch transformers 3: ⚰️
"Dancing on the soviets" I just imagined Armstrong fuckin hittin the griddy.
Your secret isn’t that dark my good sir .. for I have (shamefully) liked this movie too
I don’t only because they are just robot films it’s just a dumb movie to have fun with
Imma be honest love the first 4 movies came out
People can say what they want, I love these movies. Great thing to sit down on a Saturday and watch for a afternoon
I looked up transtheroies Now I'm an expert in pronouns...
Best trailer ever though. Dont @ me
WOAH WOAH WOAH what was the scene at 3:00 3:02.I know it wasn't transformers. I need a source on that. I need more dumb things to watch.
OK here me out I do like the Michael Bay movies IN SOME WAY,some more than others. It's mainly the visuals that I enjoy the most.(and it's what made me love transformers in the first place :])
How DARE you sir! OOLA…the random blue chick is Oola. Jabbas favorite dancer. Before she got  Rancored anyway.   Carry on.
dotm is prolly my favorite bayverse film
0:45, "brutal, pokemon die..." sounds like you're describing Pokemon: The First Movie!!!
1:14 HOLY SHIT I HAD THIS TOY AS A KID NO WAY THATS INSANE
Don’t care the CGI in the Transformers Franchise is insanely good
Top movie of all time idgaf😂
We want all 5 movies!
I feel like I'd get the opposite of giant robots if I ever looked up Trans Theories
Swayze? You mean Dempsey? Haha
I’ve seen people try and defend serial killer prime by saying “it’s a war what’s he gonna do, hug them to death?” There’s a difference between killing in a war and brutally torturing, dismembering and mutilating someone and then killing them. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Optimus Prime killing Decepticons in a war, but this Prime has such an obvious bloodlust that it looks like he’s actively looking for excuses to kill people
I love megatrons max payne style run in when he shoots sentinel to save optimus
TF3 is my favourite of the who transforms genera mainly because the whole Chicago sequence is a whole out war and I fucking love that
I just realized how awful these movies LOOK. Everything is so blue and shiny and cold
Spielberg directed Ready Player One. So that surprise you?
This movie sucks, why do I like it?
I hated the movie so much that hearing a recap of it pisses me off all over again.  Nice video.
What if Pokemon just straight up never existed? Now that is an Alternate History subject.
The truth is the original trilogy is gorgeous, dumb, fun, stupid, cool. Even ROTF is a guilty pleasure to just have on your tv while scrolling through social media.
I was also in the exact age range the producers were aiming for with these movies. But I always hated them.  Idk. Maybe you have to be straight to like these things. Never saw much of interest for me.
I love this movie! The toy-line was also great
First Man is actually one of my favorite movies
I want at least ONE movie, from EACH franchise, that's rated R, because it's NOT FOR KIDS.   R rated Sonic movie? I'd watch that. R rated Pokemon movie? I'd watch that. Mickey Mouse becomes a cannibalistic serial killer, only to be killed by his best friend once he learns the truth? I'd watch that.
Ah, the early 10s... when everything,  whether it's videogames or movies, ought to be Call of Duty.
As a kid I legit fucking balled when Ironhide died
I love the movie First Man too, man
Can't wait for zack to get to part 4 and 5. Can't wait for that mental breakdown
Gotta love the reactions of people to Optimus executing a genocidal maniac and a slaver. TBH, I get why he becomes an asshole in the later films. The guy ends the war so that the human species won't be enslaved or otherwise removed from existence and the audience reaction is "I found that unnecessary" and the in-universe reaction is "and we don't need you anymore. Die, lol"
Wait is this the same guy that does Alternatehistoryhub?
Honestly i enjoy brutal Optimus Prime, its like his patience just reached limits and started to go on rampage for all those years.
Fun fact: Wheelie is voiced by Tom Kenny. Y'know, the voice of SpongeBob :)
I love that open apologizing for liking the movie.... and then proceed to dump on the movie. This review was more enjoyable than the movie. A low bar, but, hey... a W.
I actually liked this movie, but I watched it when I was like 8 in theaters and it was my first movie I watched in theaters so it hold a special place in my heart
Seeing this in theaters as a teenager, I remember being pissed that Ironhide's death was acknowledged by literally nobody. This badass was one of the OGs and he doesn't even get a passing mention of grief from Optimus or Ratchet.
0:34 Michael Imperoli?
Yes and it was amazing
Im actually fine with optimus going nuts because of the fact he doesnt wana see cybertron 2.0 and that a whole innocent planet or innocent in his eyes died because of the fact he made a lapse in judgement
I don’t really get the hate towards this movie. I’m like you, I genuinely really like this film. It’s my second favorite in the franchise
I’m glad someone else realizes how ridiculous the buzz aldrin scene was like wtf how much did they pay him
Crazy how Megan did the tmnt movie in 2016 after hating working with bay
u got my subscribe for this you funny as hell😂
Holy shit I just hurt Cody drop a f bomb
I think one thing that stuck out to me was, in the first 2 non combatants and civilians didn't get killed. In the first movie megaton fell of a building and not a single person got squashed, then fast forward to number 3, the non combatants are being hunter for sport, there's that speeder thing that just shoots up a whole load and they turn to bones. Such a weird shift from 'kid-friendly' to zanny teenage ott.
7:05 was that Walter White screaming?
So maybe it was the Decepticons who shot the missile into Poland?
Please review Bumblebee (2018)
im sorry but the “time to find out” line is so fuckin badass
man that original ending wouldve been so much better and also could shape the 4th movie better with lockdown hunting and owning megatron first sheeesh what couldve been
Great video, Cody.  I too have an odd fondness for Dark of the Moon; it remains a guilty pleasure, even after all these years.  Aside from the 2007 film, it's the only Bayformer movie I enjoyed.
I love all the movies. Guilty pleasures. Don't get me wrong, I know when they are bad, I still enjoy them.
Ah yes, the 'good guys'.  The guys that've been lying to US govt since day one and are clearly just as unhinged lunatics as the other side,  if not worse with how Optimus Prime loses his shit on a regular basis and starts screaming about tearing off faces, and used US govt to launch a campaign of genocide on the survivors.    WHY should the US govt trust Autobots?
It's funny you mention Shockwave just standing around and look menacing because Yes that's basically him in everything past G1. He's just a really intimidating villain who also sometimes does science stuff for the Deceptions
Hit me with everything you've got sir.
It was not Bay that said he didn’t want Fox anymore it was Spielberg that said yea fire her. So Bay had nothing too doo with Foxes departure
The theater I went to see this movie at literally clapped at the end when Optimus killed Megatron, I was one of them. It had it flaws but there were some great moments in the movie; it had emotion, comedy, somewhat good characters, Shockwave is terrifying, peak Bay spectacle. Had the series ended at DotM the series might've been remembered in the regards of Avengers or Terminator, maybe, just maybe.
most violent PG-13 movie huh? ever watched Red Dawn (1984)?
It is what it is < it's what it's
Im not asking why. Im not asking how. I actually have the BALLS to admit i not only sorta like this. I love this movie. Get on my level buddy
Damn I didn't know the autobots were on the wrong side of the Israel Palestine thing.
i was 10 when this movie came out and and i hate the first two thirds but i love the last third. TBH when the movies came out i loved them because big robot
This isn't even close to being the most violent PG-13 movie You should see movies from the 70s
21:39 CHATARRA TU ABUELA
as a kid when the city was being taken over and people were getting massacred my little mind soaked it up and turned it into a nightmare that night. that shit was a biiit too dark for a 8 year old kid
Trans Theories…lol
They did my boy Wheeljack so dirty in this movie. I cry every time I see his face
We saw each of Michael Bay’s Transformers films from part 2-5, and yes now that I’m where I am… I realize that this dude is the guy who wanted to make the ninja turtles aliens… eww… But, aside from that I did enjoy these films back in the day, I’ve gone to the movie theater very little in life and 2-5 was all in the theaters! Though Bumblebee was the most exciting!
i loved the first 3 movies, and even as i got older and could see through some bad writing and realized that they are movie length ads, but i dont care. however i want to add that as a 19 year old youngin, that i almost cry at the part where sentinel turns on ironhide and disintigrates him, it makes me soo soo sad because he was always the tough loyal gun toten, lead slingin best friend a guy could have, and he got done sooooo dirty. i still love the movie but damn.
Honestly, this is my favorite of the 5 movies. Seeing it in an IMAX theater was probably the best theater experience I've ever seen. Also the whole Chicago sequence was just...oooo so good
The only good transformers sequel! and it had more G1 references than the first two!
you forgot to mention the best line in the movie spoken by our altruistic hero, "we will kill them all"
Megatron and Sentinel prime were not trustworthy so I can understand why Optimus unalived them.
The Autobots aren’t signatories of any treaties regarding international law of war.  Therefore, no war crimes were committed.
I thought the 3rd was the best, it’s like the Godzilla movies where the characters are crap but everything else is gas
The subtle Duck Tales "The Moon" was such a nice editing touch.
Here’s why we like Dark of the Moon. It’s just dope. The crass nature and absurd violence, things which would often be bad, is taken so far beyond the line in this movie that it loops back around to being incredible, if only because it’s impressive that they could take it this far. I love it. It’s glorious. It is fun for the sake of fun, and I absolutely love it.
This guy sounds a lot like AltHistoryHub, many of you might not know him, because I’m a history nerd. But seriously, he does
Do you have another YouTube channel?
Transformers 1&2 are like Call of Duty matches then Transformers 3 just switched up to the least cinematic Battlefield game altercation
Patrick Swayze? Didn’t know he was resurrected and entered Patrick Dempsey’s body.
Actually I really like dark side of the moon as well
Fox with MGK is like a teen dealer dating the head cheerleader just so she gets high for free
And there’s a a Neil Armstrong movie staring Ryan Gosling? He’s just too perfect.
I loved fiction as a kid, still do. Was & still am into superheroes, anime, sci fi, etc. when I was a kid to like it when most didn’t, u got bullied for it. Now it’s all mainstream & ppl like the pos Paul bros do Pokémon trading but they look the the classic bully types. Don’t judge a book by its cover but rs, I bet ppl like them hated it
The trilogy was good, then it went to 💩
0:34 I didn't know Chrissy played Pokemon
You keep talking about the violence and depressing things in this movie but have you seen transformers prime 🤔
I have a really similar feeling for this movie, I remember it as my favourite transformers movie but I have no idea why.
4 more months until the next one
That Balrog comment was so cringe I couldn't help but subscribe.
The problem with the live action transformer movies is that the human side was constantly expanding since the first film and by the end, it was less a transformers story, and more about the human “sidekicks”
“Illegal nuclear site”  Bruh what? Was this before or after the nuclear peace deal with Iran where the Iranians stopped nuclear development? That’s some real cod energy “nah, the highway of death was actually Russians”
YESSSSS FINALLY! I’ve been waiting for this for WEEKS
I kinda love transformers 1 and 3 a lot just because they're super enjoyable, but I do hope soon we get more quality transformers films similar to bumblebee, I have my hopes for the new rise of the beasts film next year
Here's my take.  I never watched the cartoon series or movies as a kid, nor have I as an adult.  I was 17 when the first Bayformers movie came out, and I thought it was pretty darn cool, but a little short on the giant robot fighting action for my taste.  I'll sacrifice dumb plot for the sake of cool action.  The second one came out, and I thought that was pretty cool too.  Obviously not taking itself too seriously, the plot is already nonsense, but I enjoyed it.  It's dumb, the characters are dumb, the plot is dumb, but my movie ticket doesn't say "Casablanca" or "The Return of the King" or some other well written movie on it.  I came to see robots fighting each other in a city.  My only disappointment was that the city was lame, dusty sand buildings.  Then the third one came out.  The conspiracy stuff was (dumb) fun.  The Sam stuff was... pretty boring, I could do without that, he really didn't need to be there.  But then.   The brutally violent alien invasion of a city with absolutely no hesitation about showing rampant death and destruction on a large scale is something I haven't seen done this well in any other movie besides Battle: Los Angeles.  Between the two, both have their ups and downs.  But the second half of this movie... it's just awesome.
I don't wanna be the annoying guy who corrects people BUT someone need to do that:  In the pokemon games the ability "intimidate" don't low the especial defence, lows the physical attack of opponent when the pokemon with the the ability "intimidate" comes to the field
Love these transformers videos, hope you intend to cover the rest of the movies eventually.
I remember when i was on this movie in cinema, back in 2010/11 in Czech rep.  When i see those parts of army and NASA and destruction it makes me like so much military movies today, and make me interested in to space and technology. But my well.... love in CGI destruction started here (or 2012 hard to say) :D Also this movie made me like so much Chicago (god i would like to live there someday) :)
Loved the first 3 transformers films (first being the best) but I love them all to this day
Dark of the moon is the best one
Dark of the moon was my favourite transformers movie
idk why you say DoTM is hated. from what ive seen its the only other good bayformers movie aside from TF2007
Holy shit, that pokemon mac and cheese was my favorite lmao
16:10 "Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod."  J.J. Abrams saw this scene and thought "yeah, I can totally bring Palpatine back."
Poor Bill O'Reilly.  His talents were wasted on this movie.  Especially because he could have made a cameo appearance in DMC:  Devil May Cry...
"Freedom is the right of all sentient beings".  -A war criminal.
As much as everything else about these movies is terrible, the special effects and the transforming sequences are a technical marvel, some of the best looking end presented ever done.
Futurama video?
1:24 what the hell did I saw
I felt like the trilogy should've ended with Dark of the Moon because the storyline of Age of Extinction and The Last Knight didn't make sense to the first three films. And this was probably the bayverse film that I enjoyed, even to this day. It's kind funny.
Yeah, it's bad, but there's something about this movie that keeps me from hating it. It's one of my favorite movies, despite the fact I know it's bad.
The funny thing is Optimus and Megatron making peace makes a lot more sense with the lore than anything else.
Ya I really like this one too. But honestly I really like all Transformers everything including Energon lol.
The transformers movies are utter garbage but I love every second of them.  But the Last Knight was meh even by my low standards
6:56 Wow, Patrick Swayze sure looks good for a guy who died before principle photography began! I guess he also got plastic surgery to look like Patrick Dempsey after being resurrected!
Okay, but First Man video when?
Man I would have loved the original ending, megatron and optimus having a truce was always the endgame to the story. One thing in this vid that's still confusing... Wtf is that pokemon movie in the beginning of the vid?!
the last thing i expected to see in this video is a clip of my local game store owner
Man that cut ending would've been better.
If I can like The Golden Kingdom... This is okay to like
Honestly I feel like if this is too violent but the G1 movie wasn't..... I actually feel like this movie got the plot from the G1 3 parter with some differences.  So it's just 'it's not 1,000% G1 so it's trash." Video and also I know,  I just pissed people off. Well, what doesn't in the TF community anymore?  So I'm just going to keep going; DoTM has an interesting plot that again was inspired by G1 with changed/ added ideas.   I think I can answer your Q's but not sure if you want  answers.  Now the whole "how dare OP killed Sentinal." I say he had no choice, but gee all the cons he's killed, now we should be like "wow Optimus is psycho!"?   The other conclusion...hmm.... I can't see fans liking that, but also what if we got most of AoE plot, but KSI got the data from Que or another killed cybertronian. Lockdown still comes to Earth, his whole mission yada yada but rather than Megatron is with the Autobots, he's somewhere else on Earth, meets Lockdown and is convinced that Optimus is to be arrested.  Fast forward to China. Megatron finds out about the drones and tnow he puts them under their control because Joyce has the seed, and the rest of the movie happens.   But it would be a miracle if a movie came out that most liked. No."real fan" comments, insults, arguing who should be the focus etc.
Bumblebee is easily the best of the live action films
Just wait TLK is even worse
U forget that because of an Amazon leak the ending had to be completely redone in a few months
Megan Fox now just looks like every other Instagram skank Kardashians wannabe, washed up and dating horrible guys
Apparently I'm the only one who likes the 4th movie. Like it isn't great, but I think it's a fairly enjoyable watch.
The first 3 transformers movies were so horny and I liked it
Love that one of your background songs is the first world song in spyro three lol
My problem with each film is that each technological mcguffin completely undermines not just the point of the last artifact, but the previous film's plot. Like why the hell was Megatron so bent on being the Fallen's lackey and getting the Star Harvester running when he had made a deal with Sentinel years before to transport Cybertron to Earth instead?
“Ik there’s criticism glorifying the military industrial complex”  me who joined the navy bc I loved how cool they made the navy look 😳👀
REASON I LOVE THIS MOVIE-SHOCKWAVE AND BLONDE MODEL WITH TAIL
Wym your credibility is fading this is so many people favorite of the trilogy (I ain’t talking about the last two). It’s fun as hell especially the 3rd arc (honestly it what careers the movie). Total Bayham. This should’ve been the last movie.
Goddamn Big Shuttle
16:10 its not explained in the movie, but in real life the USSR sent an unmanned probe to the moon at the exact same time as the Apollo 11 mission. Named Luna 15.   It was a failure and ended up crashing into the back of the moon, however it actually crashed while Neil and Buzz were on the moons surface.   It would have been so easy to tie that into the explanation on how the Soviets got it, but noooooo
My response for @15:35 At least they're saying he actually made it.
Optimus really blasted sentinel prime to the shadow realm
You think a movie called Transformers Dark of the Moon would involve Transformers figthing on the Moon.
I figured the Decepticon's plan was to use the pillars, only for them to realize it wouldn't work without Sentinel. Then after RotF, they realized Optimus could revive him. Doesn't explain why they didn't use the army until now, though.
I think prime killing Grindor and Sentinel prime is justified. Like what would you do if a group ganged up on you and tried to kill you?
17:14 Megatron's foot on the right is literally clipping through the ground wtf
I recognize the background track from the Cybertron anime!
Now i just wanna see the review of Bumblebee
Personally, the best in the movies
what's even great about the NASCAR transformer wreckers is that they actually had a nice 30-40 second segment for the 2011 daytona 500 where they showed it off https://youtu.be/iHGbOIcJOxw?t=3802  it was pretty fucking cool ngl
BTW - the “Space-industrial complex” is a pretty good term to describe what the Elon Musks and the Jeff Bezos’ of the world are up to - I.e. the privatization of space.
Bayformer youtube videos are always peak
7:32  started to hook up that blue chick (shows a green twi'lek)
shoutout mr Sunday movies
jablonsky is god and "it's our fight" is a banger
Megatron's foot I clipping through the for at 17:14
Patrick Dempsey* FTFY
21:44 yup no argument there
This is the only Transformers film I  unironically enjoyed. (at parts)
Hey pointless, loved the video. However I'd appreciate a warning next time you're going to show a Chicago deep dish "pizza" on screen like you did at 9:30
damn, one of the holders of the attack titan wrote Dark of the Moon?
Intimidate lowers ATTACK >:(
people love pushing things
Aren’t they so fun
I'll be honest I like all the movies enough except for the second film
I was a teen when this movie came out and I hated it so bad 🙈 I love T2, though, the sound of that Abrams firing makes me melt 🤤
Kinda dissapointed you didn't mention Laserbeak, he's so cute! I wanna take him home and feed him crackers
To explain the coldness of Optimus, there are actually quite a few IDW tie-in comics from the first 3 movies, and they actually go a lot more in depth with Optimus's mental state, since early in the war he was similar to what you'd expect from him, but after oh so many years of fighting, along with the news of Sentinel's "death", he kind of snapped in a sense, just going full on Rambo at the Decepticons.
15:24 bad buisness is fire asf
as a small human i hated the first 2 3rds of the movie. i just loved the last bit. even then i knew i didnt like nor understand the plot up to that point
Imagine getting blown into meat chunks by a Decepticon.
Fuck Sentinel Prime, and technically he wasn't surrendering, he just yelled "NO OPTIMUS!" If Sentinel said I surrender or raise his hands then Optimus Prime would be war criminal. However, Megatron who wanted to have a truce would be considered a war crime. Damn you OP.
Yep i only remembered the last third of the movie
Deep Wang...
ITS BOT UNUSUAL
0:50 Magcargo I’m so proud of you now we can commit warcimres together
Is the Christopher from the soprano's 34 sec's in?
My biggest complaint about these movies is that I can't even understand what the hell I'm looking at half the time because the design of the robots look so needlessly overcomplicated.
https://youtu.be/9oy2WihOz7w
Shit was so fire that they had to trash Chicago again in the fourth movie
"Brutal Violence" _Mario Kart music starts playing_  Fitting
I’m genuinely surprised the Autobots and Deceptions survived Chiraq
This is like if Red Alert took itself completely seriously.
"I'm an inventor !" - Walter McWhalburger
Althistory start got me. A world without pokemon.....
An alternative word for Millennial should perhaps be "mangaboomer"
Same man . I like the movie but i cant tell why
I was a teenage boy when this movie came out to and thought this movie was painfully awful. Guess I was always destined to be trans lol
if there's a day when robots become sentient and become a part of human society, how are they going to think about all these gruesome depictions of robot violence? "so XR73, what did you think of that film?" "I RECEIVED MANY SIGNALS OF DISTRESS IN MY LOGIC PROCESSOR. I AM DISTURBED BY THE DEPICTION OF SYNTHETIC VIOLENCE. ENGAGE DISPLEASURE PROTOCOLS."
All I remembered from this movie was Linkin Park playing over the characters walking among a destroyed Chicago, so I guess you're right. We only care about this movie for the music and the final battle.
This movie is so damn good. The absolute war happening is a sight to behold. This movie definitely had some problems, but the action was some of the best in the series.

About Megatron's plan: It could be possible that Megatron simply didn't know Sentinel was on the moon until after Revenge of the Fallen when he met up with Soundwave. I say this for a few reasons; Megatron's plan, as he stated himself, was to "rendez-vous here on this planet, before fate waylaid us both." The plan was to simply meet up on Earth, possibly because that's where the Allspark was. His ORIGINAL (keyword) plan never involved reviving (even though it wasn't revival because he never died, he was just in sleep mode) Sentinel and then doing all that. So now you ask; Why did the plan change?  Well, it was because, as Megatron put it, "Fate waylaid us both." It just so happened that they both crash landed, Megatron for unknown reasons (I personally wouldn't count S7's explanation as they themselves admit it's a theory) and Sentinel because he was shot down. Why was Sentinel shot down, despite Megatron's plan was for them to meet up? Because it was a secret from the entire deception army, barring the two waves (might be one or two more, but generally I'll just say them to be on the safe side.) My evidence for this was that even Starscream never knew about this, despite being in command of the deceptions TWICE and being Megatron's top underling. Megatron kept the plan a secre for unknown, but not unreasonable nor unrealistic, reasons.   So I covered why the plan changed, now I'll cover why and when the new plan started when it did. The TLDR answer: He simply didn't know the circumstances until after Revenge of the Fallen. My evidence for this is this: In the first movie Megatron simply wanted to retrieve the Allspark so he could rebuild Cybertron, and THEN he could meet up with Sentinel. The reason he didn't meet up with Sentinel prior to retrieving the Allspark could be for a few reasons: He was narrow sighted and laser focused purely on retrieving the Allspark, temporarily forgetting Sentinel because Sentinel isn't a top priority. Getting the Allspark before the autobots hide it in a much more secure location (whatever that might be) and risk loosing it forever. Another reason is that he thought he could just betray Sentinel once he gets the Allspark. No explanation given because it's just a Megatron thing to do. And the last reason, and personally what i believe is most realistic, is that he simply *didn't know* Sentinel crash landed on the moon. Sentinel crashed AFTER Megatron crashed on the North Pole. So there's no way for him to meet up with someone he doesn't know the situation, nor the location to. Remember that in the first movie Megatron was awake for 4 hours at BEST. So how could he have known the up to date situation about Sentinel when his main goal is to retrieve the Allspark, and 4 hours later he's offlined? In the second movie, same deal. He's awake for a week or so (at best) and his goal is to retrieve the Matrix of Leadership so they could activate the Star Harvester and make more energon, which was revealed to him after his resurrection by his master. That's why I say he knew after ROTF. Because that's the only time he could have know the situation.  So essentially: Megatron never knew about the army on the moon nor about Sentinel, since both arrived after Megatron's crashing on the NP. So while Megatron was in ice, the Decepticons under the command of Soundwave (i say him because he knew about the plans 100% and worked on them while Megatron was gone. My proof is the human villain saying that Soundwave is directly responsible for the Apollo program being cancelled, which means he was directly involved) would've raided the Ark for the pillars and then hid both themselves and the pillars underneath the moon's surface. They'd stay there in a statis mode (sorta like sentinel was) while the big named Decepticons from TF2007 locate Megatron and the cube. Two and a half movies later, Soundwave meets up with Megatron and fills him in on the situation (since this would be the first time they had the chance to) and Megatron would proceed with what options he had left. He would have the cons manipulate the bots into discovering and reviving sentinel (learning from the second movie that the matrix can repower bots) because Sentinel was the only bot who could control the pillars. Then they'd use the pillars for a SURPRISE attack (the Decepticons didn't require the pillars to travel to Earth like the guy said, since they got to the moon perfectly fine. It's just that the pillars was the fastest, and they needed to blitzkrieg the U.S. and the world to be able to get a stronghold quickly. Which would've worked has the autobots not returned) on the U.S. From there they'd transport Cybertron to Earth and use the humans for slave labor. But they failed, so it never happened.   And if you're saying that's impossible because it was never shown in the movie, remember this: Just because it wasn't shown doesn't mean it's impossible. We, the viewer, get shown the story through biased filters. We view it though, primarily, the eyes of Sam. Because of that we get cons who seem unemotional and uncharacterized, but that's only because that's how Sam sees them. Which is why they seem like cartoon villains at times who's evil just to be evil BECAUSE we see them through the eyes of Sam, one of their victims. I often find people ignore the fact that our viewpoint is biased when reviewing the plot of the first three. When if you take the viewpoint into account, the plot holes make sense as to why they exist.   But that's my ¢2 on the matter  Edit: Typos
Shia labeufs character feeling inadequate and like a failure, that is why his "acting" was so precisely on point. BTW could we stop acting like Michael Bay ever had even the remotest form of talent or creativity to speak of ? That incarnation of incompetence is responsible for shaky cam, the cheapest and most annoying cover-up for bad choreography, effects and camerawork in the history of film making.
My favorite P-HUB 😁
I will say I think the Mikaela situation was a pretty bad symptom of these movies over-relying on a human cast. Recasting a VA for a robot man is a lot easier than having to recast an actual actor, they're overlaid with so many filters minor differences would be pretty hard to spot and if it was different you could just pull a Bumblebee and say they got kick in the voicebox or something. Then by doing that you no longer run the risk of having to last-second write out an important character due to an acting dispute and replacing them with an obviously different person and ruining a story arc built up over 3 whole movies.
I know I saw this movie, but for the life of me I have zero memory of it. I'm pretty sure I even saw it in the theater, but it's a complete blank.
12:43 You're not the only one!  First Man is a masterpiece honestly.
Ironhide's death pissed me off. Perhaps not his death, but the way in which he died.
I was barely a teenager when I saw Dark of the Moon and I remember being very uncomfortable with seeing Optimus Rip Megatrons head off after Megatron saved his life. I was like "wtf was that? That's what the bad guys are supposed to do."
Dark of the moon is great . The old 1984 -1986 had some cringe 2 just saying. First 3 we’re good
For your question at 18:00 or sometime later. Megatron wouldn’t be able to resurrect sentinel without the all spark or the matrix of leader ship. Even if he did get the all spark megatron wouldn’t need sentinel any longer. There wasnt any possible way to even get to him without knowing his location.
Trans teori lmao
What an opening. My God.😂
this movie perfectly illustrates the most peaceful and least violent day chicago has ever had
Good work
Roblox: Bad Business gang wya‼‼🔥🔥😈⁉️⁉️
8:17 a robot should NOT bleed like that...
This is the last Bayformers film to star Shia LaBeouf, because he acted bizarre and horrible in public to the point where a comedian made an iconic parody song based on him where Shia was portrayed as a relentless cannibal. It's hilarious tbh, around the time where Mel Gibson and Charlie Sheen went nutty. And this is one of the last pieces of media casting Leonard Nimoy(actor of Sentinel Prime) next to Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance in spring to summer of 2012 as Xehanort until he passed away in early 2013.  I agree with the Megan Fox comment, which confirms that Michael Bay is an asshole on set. And it was his fault for ruining Hollywood and the new/veteran Autobots as well as Decepticon actors having their talents wasted in this fallen(no pun intended) pentology!
Somehow the Russians got the ball. Did they revive palpatine too?
Regarding the whole thing about megatron’s plan, interestingly the second movie novelization has a diffeeent ending which reveals that megatron teamed up with the fallen because the fallen promised to turn megatron into a prime. Optimus tells megatron that the fallen is lying because primes can only be born and megatron abandons the fallen. That actually makes the whole thing make sense, megatron needed the pillars to bring cybertron to earth so he could enslave humans to rebuild it. But to use the pillars he needed to be a prime, his original plan would have been to backstab sentinel by crashing the ship, use the allspark to find the sun harvester, build an army,then force the fallen to make him a prime so he could use the pillars. But he instead crashlanded on earth like a dumbass, got frozen, got killed by a human, then left without an army had to suck up to the fallen, then the fallen gets killed so now he has to suck up to sentinel
Somehow Palpatine returned.
Ngl, I loved the original trilogy
No matter what I’ll always love the bayformers movies especially dotm it’s my favorite of the 5 films
Man didn't expect to relive disintegration fears.
This film is so dumb. I love it so much 10/10 film
this movie is still the best one tho
300k in 2 days is crazy
Starscream was always my favourite as a kid, seeing Sam accidentally kill him with a grappling hook was so bafflingly stupid I couldn't help but shrug and laugh
Cody bro, we need to know what Pokemon fan film that was in the beginning 😅
I remember the video game adaptation of this movie where you get to commit the war crimes yourself!
so your favorite pokemon is meowth.
I tried watching this movie 3 times and literally fell asleep each time. I gave up trying to watch it after that. I didn't hate it, I just... kept nodding off half way through every time.
I don't acknowledge anything after the dark of the moon.
For me the original three films will always be a guilty pleasure for some reason. I guess it's in part because these films were my first introduction to the franchise, but also because they just find a way to turn my brain off because I can be quite the sucker for big action. But then the 4th and 5th films came out and  suddenly the pleasure I had for the live action franchise evaporated. They should have just stopped making them after DOTM, so I can't wait to see you rip apart the other two films, Cody, lol!
At least TF3:DOTM Didn’t converge to Chinese communism like TF4:AOE.
I never knew people didn't like Transformers 2 and 3. Have seen a few videos hating on these films within the last couple weeks, weird.  Regardless, the original bay transformers trilogy will always be amongst some of my favourite movies.
17:15 The way the wheel clips
https://youtu.be/-KRt6pT9-kk it's not blood, also they're supposed to look alien
One thing that is missing from this videos is the fact that G1 wasn't the only Transformers series before the movies, if you include Beast Wars which to many was an introduction to the brand, the transition will be more smooth. Beast war was more seriousthan the G1, had far more violence and the designs were far less bulkly.
Sentinel's execution always disturbed me as a kid.
18:14  One thing you have to give is that - *Skybeam* and *Flying Boat like Alien Robots* clicked something with *The Avengers'* Production Team, didn't they?
I re-watched the movie again, and seeing people being blown into pieces I was like "Dang, I watched this when I was 10?"
God I’ve been waiting forever for your next transformers upload
when are heroes commit more war crimes you have to think are we helping the baddies
I like how the setup to this video is basically an Alternate History Hub video set up.
I remember them filming this shit in Chicago, I’m not from there but I was in like 3rd grade and on vacation and we saw ig some action scene and it was like a cab and a tank and cars on fire or some shit and there was a huge crowd, my parents hadn’t watched the news in the last two days so we thought it was a real terror attack. After that the whole week we would see shit like a giant plant monster in the park where the bean thing is and a smoking car hanging off a bridge while we were on a boat tour, in the end the cool thing ab the movie was it gave me a slightly cooler trip
Great review
Ah yes, the best in a collection of garbage. I still rewatch this high as balls.
transformers 3 is not in chicago, it actually happend in Ohio
Despite the flaws of this one it's still my favorite in the series, Shockwave snd Sentinel were awesome. Edit to add, I personally dislike the original ending because it doesn't make sense imo. Megatron and his Decepticons nearly wiped out all life on Earth three times and Sentinel betrays his former teammates and doesn't show remorse until he's at Optimus' mercy. Imho Megatron and Sentinel kinda deserved what they got.
When I was a kid I was so pissed off that Megan was replaced, still am
PG13 is really questionable tbh.  Blood and Gore is a Nono while Robots spine exposed is fine.
Confession: Dark of the Moon is my favorite in the Bayformers series
I'll admit it, I really like Dark of the Moon. It's stupid but at the same time, it does feel like a genuine war movie. At times. Great twists and turns, solid drama (at times), and overall great action. Doesn't make up for the shit human characters though, or the nonsensical plot.
Even though dark of the moon is still my favorite movie because of the crazy brutal limb-tearing stuff but I still think that the 1986 is much more worse
What an intro.
Ah yes one of the most disappointing films that I've ever watched. Good thing I watched it pirated, at least the figures were decent. I did enjoy the deluxe Starscream to the point where I memorized the transformation without the manual.
I have mixed feelings on this film
If Spielberg did fire Megan Fox over the Bay as Hitler comments it's not that crazy. Remember Spielberg lost multiple family members in the Holocaust and grew up knowing Holocaust survivors. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't take Hitler comparisons lightly.
I want to know the name of warcrime pokemon movie it's probably also bad that I'd play the hell out of game that let me be some kind of evil pokemon master and just destroy the whole damn world
How is Chicago your backyard if you're in Ohio?
I genuinely can’t watch Optimus kill Sentinel without hearing the dodgeball sound
This is the moment Optimus finally broke bad
we also got an absolute gem called Iridescent by Linkin Park outta this
Trying to understand the Transformers movie cannon and its "logic" feels like trying to solve a puzzle with your elbows only to find out that none of the pieces were part of the same puzzle to begin with
Hey the worm thing is the drill
Fun Fact: My dad actually got to meet one of the actors from this film that was part of Lennox's team and he gave my dad an autographed (even though I don't think dad ever said he wanted one). He came back home told me he met an actor from Transformers 3 and handed me the autograph the actor signed. So yea pretty neat🙂
"The Mountain Dew Machine goes on a rampage."  Best line I've heard all week.
Transformers movie were good
I’m pretty sure paramount forced Bay to make more transformers movies
Imagine getting hired on to replace Megan Fox and the headline that follows is “the movie just got a whole lot less sexy” I’d probably k1ll myself
I think it would be funny if Cody points out in a Bumblebee film how ridiculously long it takes to get from the San Francisco bay area to Santa Cruz boardwalk on a scooter
You should make a batman v superman vid
I didn't realize there was a way better ending. Thank you for pointing that out.
Have you seen the clone wars?
my grandfather went to school with Neil Armstrong.
I will NEVER let go of the mental image of Cody Farnsworth..  "sigh... I don't want to live on this planet anymore.. probably"
People says transformers movie version are for kids:
You have the polish and editing skills of a channel with 100 videos 💖
The point at 9:33 does come back in both 4 and 5, don't you worry, Cody. You will know.
"Nothing makes a bad movie look good, than a worse movie" dear lord my thoughts exactly
Ok that “blue” chick is actually green
I had a conversation like this a few days ago. The best parts of this film are the soundtrack and that big shootout at the end. It's just...*really* fucking cool.  I appreciate Michael Bay, because he's honest about why he does what he does. "I make movies for 12 year old boys." He's not a pretentious asshat, he just likes making dumb action movies.
Could we keep in mind his rage scene was because of a personal vendetta against Shockwave? If anyone else read the prequel comics, you'll know why that is.
Ironhide was my favorite character , RIP.
Psst, Hey- guess what? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I... Am An Inventor. ("What I've Done" plays)
Can you do star wars
OK is there a new one coming out,,
Nah the oil was sposed to be their blood , it was never red
In pokemon Intimidate actually lowers the attack stat
Not a day goes by that I don't wish they kept the original ending
Excellent video man I dig it
Transformers 3 is the best of the Micheal Bay movies.
...itota, what war- stupid ? you are fighting an imaginary war game vs yourself,waaaahhahahahahahaha Edit: is good to know I live rent free in your mind 😁
"Maybe he is like a Pokemon. He uses Intimidation to lower everyone's Special Defense"  I feel like something just died inside of me
I loved this movie because I'm from Chicago and got to see the whole city get destroyed lol
Love the flashgitz screaming womb
4:06 I said wtf the same time he did and that shit was demonic
i love you thank you for posting
@8:04 Technically not blood, looks like transmission fluid (from the human perspective) but is an automotive fluid no doubt, which ensures the survival of the "vehicle"
Love PointlessHub
I liked this one too
Man this movie straight up traumatized me as a kid. Me and my sister watching this at home and were having fun at first but then they brutally killed Ironhide and we were stone faced the rest of the film on the verge of crying. We loved Ironhide and seeing him die just shot any enjoyment we had. And then seeing the Decepticons constantly vaporize innocent civilians and executing Wheeljack/Q like they did didn't help.  That worm thing is super cool though.
One of my biggest problems with this movie is how most of the deception’s are treated. Pretty much all the main ones get kinda shafted. They get maybe one cool scene and then they’re killed. Starscream doesn’t even fight a single autobot the whole movie, then gets his head blown up.
I watched the filming of the Optimus sword rampage part in Chicago was pretty sick
nah man, this movie bad.  Because all these movies bad.
Just like all the movies they completely ruined Transformers which is a shame because the special effects were really awesome but special effects can only go so far when you butcher the characters and the storyline
Welp, after Cody said he was a teenager when this movie came out, now I feel old, because I was 2 years out of college by then. 4:54 Of course he did, because he's Sir Stephen "Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan" Spielberg; he won't take any Hitler or Nazi comparisons lightly. 6:39 Wow. Such subtlety, in Ye Olde English way. 12:25 The way I remember it, the Decepticons were rebels, wanting to overthrow the more peaceful Autobots government, put themselves (mainly Megatron) in charge, then conquer the rest of the universe. 15:04 And Shockwave is one of my favorites, but this version didn't act like G1 Shockwave, the cold, logical, calculating Decepticon. The Animated version from 2008 or 9 nailed that part, even bringing back the same voice actor! 19:18 I actually said "Holy fuck, this is brutal" after watching Decepticons disintegrate human civilians. 21:37 OPTIMUS a war criminal?! That's 'Con propaganda! Then what do you call Megatron?
Tbh the only reason why i like RotF, the forest battle. Optimus was kicking megatron and companies ass.
The entire plot falls apart even further when you realize if the deceptions actually won in revenge of the fallen Optimus couldn't revive sentinel.
I do think it's pretty hardcore that over the films, Optimus loses more of his friends and crew over the movies then by Dark of The Moon some of his closest friends were dead, which in my opinion creates this feeling that he's losing, ironically, any sense of holding back his rage and thats why he's become someone who fights like a villain more than a hero.
They show how the decepticons get the pillars in the dotm video game, where a decepticon ship in Peru is launched and disappears behind the dark side of the moon.
my man is milking the I am an inventor at 24:45, and I love it, never ever forget about this horrible dialogue.

Poltergeist - when PG pushed its limits. Temple of Doom - the reason PG-13 was made
I'm just gonna say it. This channel is really underappreciated. Also, side note.  CHICAGOOOO CHICAGOOOO CHICAGOOOO CHICAGOOOO CHICAGOOOOOOOOO AHHHHHHHH
This movie made me physically sick when I watched it in the theater.
This movie had some of the rawest Optimus diolouge, can never forget "GIVE ME YOUR FACE" or the scene where Optimus, after grounding a Decepticon fighter, cocks his gun and a bullet shell the size of an oil drum doinks off of the pavement, the camera pans to his face, and he says "We will kill them all." I miss this type of writing so much.
Ik ALOT of people would like to disagree with me on this but, ive always like the michael bay movies (yes even aoe and tlk). Ik they aren’t great, infact they are far from it, but for what they are, i can see past the bad and just enjoy giant robots brutally fighting eachother. I also really like the character designs.
Genevacon must be stopped.
as divided as we may be on DotM's actual "quality" we can ALL agree that none of us ever consented to Age of Extinction
Some people complained that with Leonard Nemoy as Sentinel Prime they didn't have any Star Trek references but he tells Optimus Prime during their fight that "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."  Either the complainers missed the quote or they didn't know it was something Spock said.
Somehow palpatine returned
The IDW tie-ins did explain how Soundwave was sent by The Fallen and how he found out the Apollo missions. It tell how he started working with the humans to hide everything about the Ark and Sentinel for decades. The thing is, he didn't know that Megatron was on Earth all frozen. When he found out where his leader was and made the long journey back to Earth, the events of the 2nd movie was already happening. When things finally slowed down, he told Megatron what he been doing for decades.  Unfortunately, due to Bay being unhappy of the comic adaptations flat out spoiling  Ironhide's death before people had the chance to see his movie, he told IDW to quit making comics based on his films. This kinda sucks since they can't patch up the plotholes that was created from the Mark Wahlberg films
'The moon exists and we went there' - Buzz Lightyear
Dude i remember crying as a kid in the theater when ironhide died and then there is not a single line about him the rest of the movie OR franchise
Someone should write up a list of all the war crimes committed by Autobots in the trilogy.
7:28 akshully oola is a green twi'lek, not a blue one.
Don't worry Cody, you never had any credibility. Especially on your Pointless other channel. Anyone who likes you will stick with the other hubs and pretend this take dosn't exist.    Like this channel.
I do remember seeing age of extinction in the theatre. The only things I remember about that movie is that beats pill ad and I’m pretty sure mark Wahlberg’s character is a pedo
15:44 Hey, at least in this conspiracy they actually _did_ land on the Moon. Pretty sure he would've punched Optimus in the face had he suggested otherwise LOL  Also, if Carly is a substitute for Mikaela then she is the only character in the franchise with an actual story arc and character growth. Goes from mechanic with a dad in jail and one foot in juvie herself to the head curator of an expensive classic car collection. The only thing Sam develops is serious anger issues.  It's really bizar how these movies shit all over the main and hide all the personality underneath the sexy eye-candy.
"This is the most violent PG-13 movie, I've ever seen"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZkaakZt7NQ
Talk about coincidence. I watched the videos on Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen early yesterday morning.
Agh yes, another video about the Bayformers movies, this one should be goooooood 👌
This is my favorite series even if the 2 movie sucks
12:21 You're white. 5,000 sins. Unfunny & time wasting. Infinite Sins Result:  No "Like", no  "Share", no "Subscribe".  Bonus:  No mercy 👎
I enjoyed these movies and I would love to watch them again (including 4th and 5th). That’s right, I’m one of those people…
Hey First Man was a great movie and I've seen it a few times. Highly recommended
The worm is called a Drillerbot, and it is Shockwave's pet and mode of transportation
Transform3rs Th3 Third
As a fellow midwesternlander, I was also glad to see Chicago be absolutely destroyed
I like how in tf4 they just said fuck it and add everything.  Dinobots Lockdown Galvatron New transformium  New human cast Autobot genocide And in the end we will send Optimus to space
Sam limp dicky is now a side character, the eye candy was replaced with the sugar free version, and once again the decepticons are up to some deception. 10/10 IGN™™
To be fair what optimus did was reasonable regardless if it was illegal or not.  Optimus killed sentinel, a racist genocidal robot that killed thousands and millions.  He also turn against what he swore to do the most, which optimus looked up to.  So because sentinel betrayed himself as optimus quotes and what he stood for, he killed him.  Not to mention sentinel also killed iron hide killed who was a close friend to optimus.  People are misunderstanding this situation, sentinel isn't pleading mercy because he regrets what he did.  But because he failed to enslaved the human race and rattle his way out for survival.  I feel like this is far stretched from being a war crime at all, sure hes killing an unarm person but hes also killing a person who tried enslaving the whole human race and killing thousands.  It's funny because, people have no problem with killing baby hiter but are freaking out over a different alternate of optimus prime who is actually has a good reason to kill sentinel.
Oh yeah, those Nascar Autobots even appeared in the Daytona 500 that year, spikes and all. Michael Bay even gave the command to start engines. The race had 16 cautions, the most ever in the Grand American Race, BTW.
21:56 don't forget when killing the Fallen he says "Give me your face" before literally ripping said face off, punches a whole through his chest, and proceeds to crush his heart.
I was also a teenage boy when these came out, but i never got into it. Then again, I’m British and I was already hyper-focusing on motorsport.
Had a crush on her for a while but I knew she was an idiot. She's hot and seductive, that's about it. Glad my hormones got a reality check.
I gave up after the second film, so I am glad you're going through and explaining this hot mess of a franchise.
If yall fw pokemon I suggest PokeMMO can play on pc and mobile, nah I'm not paid by them I just enjoy the game.
Dark of the Moon is still my favorite movie of all time
Megan fox drinking blood of another man has to be the least weird thing about her
All this transformers nostalgia makes me wish that i could still buy the War for Cybertron games, GOD do i miss them so
I still remember watching this for the first time with my Dad. The last section of the movie was a blast. When missiles started flying in, I was cheering.
god help us.
Bayverse's Megatron seriously had one of the biggest nerfs in all of fiction. He goes from beating Optimus so badly in the first movie that Optimus would rather kill himself with the Allspark than risk fighting him to basically losing a 3v1 and losing 2v1 against Optimus in the second movie, and then in Dark of the Moon, he becomes Sentinel's b***h, needs to get a pep talk from a basic white girl just to fight at all, and dies in under five seconds against a one-armed Optimus.
Just a reminder back in 2011 this film was the 3rd highest grossing film of all time. These really where the marvel of the late 2000s
I like to think Optimus' Death and subsequent resurrection in the second movie just fucked him up. Not to mention he must have felt both so enraged and devastated by Sentinel's Betrayal, he just had enough and chose violence. I feel the reaction to Prime's violence is similar to how Superman fans reacted to him killing Zod in MoS. Some fans just like these two being perfect infallible paragons of virtue.
i love dark of the moon
Spiel(((berg)))
Even if Bumblebee is the best Transformers movie ever made, I still considered this one as a certified classic.
Is this a hint at covering the blade trilogy?
In conclusion: this shit crazy
16:09 “somehow palpating returned”
And the LoZ fanbase (More exactly the Link x Zelda shipping part of the fanbase) on Twitter blew up because Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly dressed up as Link and Zelda for a halloween party
Idgaf what anyone says everyone can eat my ass i love every transformers movie man even bumblebee
A
i would like a formal apology to you misremembering Intimidate as lowering special defense and not attack.
That Bay quote at the end , it just perfectly distills what Bay got wrong with these movies. “Robot Movies”. The “Robots” are sentient aliens with living metal bodies. So much more then mere robots. These mostly bipedal aliens can transform their bodies into mostly vehicles. As a disguise or transportation. They are not cars that turn into robots that have every nut on the car accounted for in robot form. They are aliens that can turn into mostly vehicles, that hide as such, it is their camouflage, not what they are. By just viewing them as robots and making sure their disguises are them turning into full cars, down to the last bolt, it looks cool, but misses the point of the lore, hard.  Thanks for coming to my TedRant.
6:55 Patrick Dempsey
Finally someone points out the danger that big shuttle and their connections to the government pose to our country
Being from Illinois, this movie meant a lot to me as a kid because it showed the place I was from. Being able to look at it and think "oh hey that's just like a block away from where my dad works" was a lot of fun. It's a shame they don't make more movies focused on Chicago.
Yeah, a lot of people defend these movies saying that they're just fun dumb action movies, but in my opinion 3 is the only one where I agree with that. Although now I like it a little less, since I actually like that ending where Megatron makes peace with Optimus way better. Optimus wouldn't have looked as dark and edgy, and Megatron would have gotten some character development. Also, I learned a lot more dumb plot holes I didn't notice from this video.
20:33 *intimate* lowers the opponent's attack not sp. defense
I can not care enough about Optimus killing effectively Mecha Hitler and Mecha stalin
You know nostalgia can be a very intoxicating thing.
the last third is like a textbook example of a guilty pleasure
you were a teenager when this movie was released???? HOW OLD ARE YOU?!?!?!
That scene where the Army Rangers use superior tactics to blind the Decepticon group with high powered sniper rifles, then immobilize them with planted anti-armor explosives and then finish them off is still frickin awesome.
Isn't it funny that both the actors of the main characters of the first two movies are at wildly different places now. Megan Fox is drinking her husbands blood in okkult rituals and Shia LaBeouf is a devout catholic now.
17:11 Ironhide covering everything but the word “Hide” in all caps makes this look more like a threat than a memorial
Can't wait for the fourth one
i love this movie and i support you liking this movie
Shoutout to anyone who plays Pokemon on a Gameboy Emulator
This third installment had some decent moments (the final battle easily the best). And I know I'm going to get wrapped in the mouth for this, but I actually did like Rosie Huntington-Whitley even though she was cast on short notice to replace Megan Fox (can't say I blame Fox for making the comment that got her fired, I probably would have done the same) with little actual acting experience. But for me, it all ended with MOON, and I avoided seeing the next two Bayformers like the plague. Check out Cinematic Excrement's reviews when you get the chance, his reactions to AGE OF EXTINCTION are... well, just check them out.
To this day, I still remember the shock me and my friends had when Sentinel killed Ironhide. We were kids. We didnt even know the concept of "plot twist".
"His boss is Jon Malkovic" that can only go really good or really bad, no inbetweens.
I still think Alita: Battle Angel and Drag me to Hell take the cake for being the most brutal PG13 flicks, but this one comes pretty close
Cody… you know Detroit is in your actual backyard right? You can’t deny Michigan supremacy forever Cody.
Regardless of how good and bad these movies were, I have to say they have some of the most crisp CGI I've ever seen. Yeah the characters were little over designed and hard to rest your eyes on, but my god do they look so well made.
“I’m Nostalgia Critic so you don’t have to.”  That, right there, is a true sacrifice. No one should ever have to be The Nostalgia Critic.
I just know that they originally called this "Dark Side Of The Moon" until the legal department got involved.
I hated every single moment Ken Jeong was on screen except for when he was thrown to his death.
I still think the Linkin Park song at the end as well as when Sam returns to Chicago is underrated. Iridescent such a comforting and uplifting song for me.
I still don’t understand how revenge of the fallen was bad, minus the cringe human scenes. In terms of fight scenes there are lots of great ones.
At the ending that bee and sound wave from the end credit of tffoc
I like how civilians are straight up vaporized, like it was ripped out of Mars Attacks.
Imagine someone punching through your throat and reaching behind your eyes pulling them out from their cord thing (?) back out your throat. I don’t think mortal kombat is even that creative lol
Megatron’s plan dose make some sense as long as you realize that how it when wasn’t exactly to plan. Megatrons plan was for him and The Fallen to locate the Allspark while Sentinel prime would bring the pillars to earth where they would look for the matrix and use the Star harvester already built there to make ample enough energon to revitalize they’re race.
Love these vids
9:35 This is Detroit.
I hope we get the 4th movie review on Christmas Day, that would be amazing
My father who was in the army cries when he watches this movie, because it’s the only accurate war movie
Love the Tom Jones bit at the outro, and the rest of the video of course.
Please more vids bro
Nice
Sentinel Prime killing Ironhide was like General Shepard betraying Ghost and Roach from MW2 levels of shocking.
The beats pill
Why stop now, finish all of the Transformers CODY!!!!
Shout out to the TF cybertron soundtrack playing my favorite song!!
I love this movie way too much, as a kid I watched it way too much only one I had on DVD so I looped that shit while waiting for 07 and ROTF to play on random tv channels. This movie was my introduction to transformers and sadly as deep as I got, I remember being so disappointed after staying up late to watch a G1 rerun and it was nothing like DOTM. Back to the topic I also loved this movie being in Chicago since I too also live near it. Hot take sentinel and megatron had it coming, they started a genocide you can't really forgive someone after all the carnage they did because this isn't G1 where no humans can be killed they 100% deserved to be killed
I know is a fact that many hates more Revenge of the Fallen over Dark of the Moon.......but I'm the opposite, I can re-watch ROTF, is stupid, the plot have no sense, the humans are the most annoying, and the less we talk about the racist TF the better..........but I still have fun watching that one...................THIS MOVIE....nope at all, this was the first time I was angry watching a film in theater that I paid money to see, this and Iron Man 3 makes my blood boiled. Probably because when I watched ROTF it was years away from me watching an actual TF show, the last I remember watching was Beast Wars at the time.....by the time DOTM premiere, I was hooking watching Transformers Prime my all time favorite now TF show.....so I was more deeply reconnected to what was a good TF story, so when I seat and watch DOTM on theaters...........my god by the end I was soo pissed off and furious of what they did to this IP and characters I love, that was the last time I watched a Michael Bay film on theater and the last time I watched a TF film until Bumblebee finally premiere.
0:34  Chris Moltisanti lookin'-ass   >Look T, I can't do collections today, I gotta spend all day breedin' for a shiny muthafuckin' Charmanduh!
TF Animated Optimus on killing: “That would be the easy way out, Megatron. You don’t deserve that.”  Optimus in the movie-verse: “You… DIE!” “We will kill them all!” “Whoever is responsible for this, I’m going to kill him!” “Give me your face!”
Peak pointlessHub
I hated this movie for the sole reason that they killed my man Ironhide
The problem with transformers movies is the massive american propaganda. I am not american so this is even worse. I know americans are exposed to heavy propaganda since they are kids, but are you seriously ok with this?
I think it's funny this movie basically started the recurring theme of humanity as a whole being Imperium of Man-levels of xenophobic to the autobots while conversely being completely fine making shady deals with the obviously evil-looking robots with the word "decept" literally in their name. Made even funnier how in later movies its shown humans just execute autobots on sight while conversely having a "decepticon jail" that they're basically willing to let go on parole if asked nicely enough.
I live for these movie breakdowns. Cody's deadpan presentation with top-tier editing just make them such a damned treat
i swear i thought this movie was called dark SIDE of the moon what the f. i thought cody was doing a funny. hm
6:34 DUUUUUUDE I was in the theater when that line came up and everyone just went "Owwww" in a real depressed tone.
The part about Optimus ripping his enemies faces off and blowing their brains out to me is that to us they may be robots. But to them they are living sentient beings.   Imagine a G.I Joe movie that had him stick 2 hooks into a Cobra soldiers face and pull it apart while screaming "DIE!"
Ngl i bet Buzz got paid *handsomely* for the cameo.
People who try to justify Optimus being a psycho will never not be the most annoying thing in the fanbase  That aside, excellent review my dood
This movie was & still is unironically my favorite transformers movie.   Didn't hurt this came out right after I got to the fleet and was super motivated.  I also though this actress was significantly hotter then Megan fox.  Zero character depth, 11/10 hotness factor though.
I personally don't hate transformers 4. It's actually probably in my top 3.   I do agree the transformations were lazy
Im gonna be honest i always forget this film exist until i have to recall what film sentinel prime came from
8:23 Alita: Battle Angel I feel is more gnarly with the violence. Another "It's okay it's robots" joint.  At one point someone who is missing both legs and one arm jams the remaining arm into another person eye socket iirc.
Huh, didn't know about the book, or that it was written by Peter David, a favorite comic writer of mine.  May have to dig it up, and see how he tried his best to 'fix' the movie 😅
You fool! Intimidate lowers attack not special defence! Now you've caused thousands of comments saying this nooooo
0:11 He had hair?
10:30 Thata literally a fucking Predator
This is where the Transformers movies should have ended.
As a transformers fan, I’m completely okay with the change in optimus’ principles. My opinion might be based, but I actually like tf5. Dotm was my favorite out of the lot. Please don’t cancel me.
If they removed the scenes with the parents and most of the humans I'd probably rewatch these movies
So glad seeing Trans theories get a shout out!
When he played the 4th movie BRACE FOR IMPACT
This series has been such a nice dose of nostalgia, I cannot wait for your review of Age of Extinction. It was the first movie in the series that I was disappointed in, similar to how Revenge of the Fallen was yours.
That 4 the film is the epitome of awful …. Fuck that movie forever
Transformers 3 is a masterpiece
@7:00 that photoshop is so bad!
I liked it too!! I thought the transformers first three movies could’ve done something where all three connect in a story like Star Wars. Instead they all feel like their own that contradict the back story of the other movies.
kinda interesting when you say the F word the Megatron there's a Mercedes Benz there. a German car, and fun fact all German car manufacturers had very good connections and were also with this one party in the 30's. Coincidence?
With that description, at this point everyone is gonna push out from our brains the existence of Age of Extinction & The Last Knight, accept that the Witwicky Trilogy is the one (and only) Bayformers trilogy. Boohoo to the 2nd trilogy, which *may probably* forever be a duology. RIP non-existent TLK sequel.   How the Witwicky Trilogy manages to maintain a *fairly* consistent Bay-ish levels of crude action amazes. Dark of the Moon peaking Bayhem & the highway chase scene somehow still being one of the most memorable Bayhem moments (I prefer the highway scene & standoff over the dinobot charge in TF4. Yeah.)
Wait, there is a novel based on this? Dear Lord. Who reads that? Guantanamo prisoners?
Broo, so many things you pointed out makes sense now that I think about it; thx!
Wtf shockwave was scientist and papa of beast robots right . Michael bay so uncool
Cody, I was forced to watch Transformers Age of Extinction for a film study class this semester so Im really gonna need you to share in my suffering and cover that movie so I can feel like I didn't completely waste a weekend writing a shitty paper on that car wreck of a feature
The transformers bombing Iran sounds like something an Iranian cleric would say as an example of American decadence.
PointlessHub I look forward to your review of Rise of the Beasts
Wait...the decepticons are working with humans?!  Why would the humans works with them? They're deceptive! It's literally on the NAME
The dodgeball edit of Optimus killing Sentinel is still so good.
my favorite pokemon movie was the one where pikachu commits war crimes
2:01 And I’m surprised that my parents were fine with letting me watch this movie. If it came out today it would get an R
Transformers are still cool
Yeah, I know Megatron offered a peace deal and all, but this is the same guy who told his murder squads to go have fun turning humans into flying skeletons. He committed so many war crimes that it's impossible to accurately keep track of them all. Him getting all weepy because big mean Sentinel Prime was bullying him doesn't make up for that. Megatron would have been executed either as a soldier or as a convict, and I refuse to believe Optimus could have forgiven him so easily. The original ending, as written, would have had to be at the end of a very different movie.
24:16 The one piece! The one piece is real!
Plz re-watch Terminator salvation and do a video on it.
Honestly this one is my favorite out of the franchise and I actually enjoy the other two films after that. But I do recognize that they last two have major problems.
Can someone please explain the context behind the laminated Romeo & Juliet law card?
I know these movies are stupid but I love all of them
7:47 Doesnt even come close to: Give me your face- Optimus prime Transformers 2
Goddamn do I love the Spyro music in the background. Really ties the whole video together!
We all have guilty pleasure films dark of the moon is no different and that is ok.
Well i work in a few minutes but i’ll pretend i can watch this.
DOTM will always be my favorite out of the films
all of the live action transformers moives are awsome! i love revenge of the fallan and the last knight, the third one was the worst but still not bad in my opinion.
The Decepticons did nothing wrong
Music at 24:21 ?
I just realized the plot to my RPG game I’m running is just the decepticon’s plan in this movie and I don’t know how to feel about that.
My favorite part is when Optimus said  “It’s priming time” then primed on all his prisoners of war
Megan Fox character had a name?!
17:14 the wheels model clip in the stairs and now you can't unsee it
You're actually really wrong, age of extinction is best movie, best movie has giant trex that blows fire, no movie better then trex fire blower, ur opposing veiw bad
Oh god, not the chip tune with the war crimes in the background
I have one question, what happens if Optimus just stayed dead in ROTF and the Matrix was never found. Would Sentinel just be stuck on the Moon… forever?
The fucking irl Pokémon video lol
19:12 people conveniently bloodlessly disintegrate
To paraphrase a review I saw for Pearl Harbor: It's 2 hours of love story and drama nobody cares about capped by 20 minutes of some of the best action in cinematic history. I feel like Micheal Bay is good at those sorts of movies.
"What would you be without me?" "Time... to find out."
Sentinel Prime was in a spaceship instead of a Spaceship himself?
Is that the real Buzz Aldron?
The Russians getting the thing is a "I need you to get all the way off my back" moment
Did not expect to be bopping out to the Spyro soundtrack today, yet here I am.
Spielberg produced this?
The first and third movies are the best
Wow
My highschool science teacher's son was one of those people in the wing suits. She talked about it for the whole school year lol
That fucking .5 second edit of the Walter White scream slayed me
hmm
The fact that we live in a period where famous media personalities can have their careers blown out of existence over misunderstood or poorly constructed jokes, while Bay managed to get away with ALL OF THIS a decade ago with zero consequences is truly amazing
Those civilians evaporating into bones traumatized me as a kid
Sending the Autobots into space is like Oregon banning gun sales XD
Call me weird but I 100% love the first 3 films. I have no complaints
All the Shia transformers movies are masterpieces
1:48 your credibility was already in the gutter when you said you liked the first transformers movie tbh
I don't really remember, but there is an episode in transformers armada (I think it's the last one) where Prime starts killing Megatron (at that point Galavatron). We learn that this is because of rage pent up from the long war, and after Galavatron scarifies himself to save everyone. Prime then wonders if he is worthy of the matrix as the episode. Fell like that's how they should have done this film.
dark of the moon was supposed to have a less war crimed and more g1 ending, but fucking amazon screwed it over.
So pretty bad movies from the genre of disaster movies or fiction movies have something to it that makes them special and unique than the others.
The death of ironhide broke me
The Mountain Dew Machine actually has a name. its Dispenser. I have a figure of it.
I know you are probably super busy, so dont take this as an entitled demand for more content... but I wish this channel got updated faster. Always a joy!
8:14 it’s still energon but it’s different colours depending on the wound
This movie has my favorite Deception in the franchise (Shockwave), so this movie kind of a Guilty pleasure because of that, I just fast forward the human scenes
Please just cover Armageddon already... maybe with Deep Impact jabs too
Dark of the moon is the best movie of all time
Better than Disney
I think I just have a soft spot for this movie cause it’s the only one I saw in imax and seeing a Michael bay movie in imax especially as a 12 year old it was quite an experience
Was funny how the US spontaneously decided to turn on the Autobots, and immediately sent them off the planet. I guess you can'th expect a Michael Bay movie to NOT be US-centric, but still it was still kinda hillarious. "America don't like you anymore. You are now banned from earth."
I remember when this movie came out. I was a diehard fan, even to the point where I loved Revenge of the Fallen. I asked a kid at school who had seen it what he thought, and he said it was a lot of fun, but that ironhide died halfway through the movie. I was so mad I actually skipped seeing it entirely until it came out on DVD. RIP ironhide lol  Also Patrick Dempsy screaming when he was knocked into the pillar thing had me in stitches 🤣
I feel like I maybe shouldn't have watched this movie over and over at age 9 or 10 in 2012
The movie is only worth watching for the third act alone Ever since sentinel prime turned his back movie start being awsome
i'm gonna watch the reupload too because i like your channel so i feel like supporting it
i've never been so excited I'm so hyped for a video to come out, amazing work man❤!
Please do videos on the terrible follow up movies! That would be hilarious!
Ayo is that Chrissy Moltisanti at 00:35 😂
Whats funnier is that: if bay kept shockwaves old designs from gen 1, that goofy steam game called "Ultrakill" wouldnt exist because its main character's face looks almost identical to shockwave from gen 1.
I feel that transformers did war crimes since the original cartoon, not even with Bay
You forgot the fact that some of the enemy designs from this movie’s final big battle is strangely similar to that of the avengers movie. And that movies were released very close to this one
I will repost my original post. The movie opens with the camera following the a$$ets of Mikaela's replacement up the stairs. That's filmmaking. No writers strike could halt that!.
Please for the love of God do the lord of the rings movies
I love the glorification of the military/space industrial complex because its f*cking sick! Who doesn’t like military equipment and spaceshuttles. I think it’s sick af.
Great video. From what I read from some 2010 articles, the movie was supposed to shoot scenes in Moscow, so perhaps the Russian aspect was larger in the original script.
Wow you were a teenager when this came out? Well I feel suddenly aged......
I vastly prefer the more complex design. And the design of the decepticons makes sense because they haven’t scanned and become cars yet. The complex designs make the models way more interesting
Idk why but the sniper face guy from the 4th one is my favourite war criminal
Michael bay does dropped the brewskies
Optimus should be in mortal Kombat
"Challenger 2"
The human story was lacking in this movie, but the transformers’ story was great and this movie has some of the best action of any action movie I’ve watched
For me the dark of the moon is the best way to end the bay transformer movies. It kills off the two main bad guys and it gives off the vibe that the war is done. The other movies don't exist in the same world for me.
I remember my mom making an RIP Ironhide post on facebook when this movie came out That's the only thing I really remember about Dark of the Moon
Lets be real when we were young these movies were the best but now when we rewatch them they feel different and brutal.
Imagine if it were people instead of robots
I honestly think that having Buzz Aldrin Going in and admit to being part of a moon landing conspiracy, where they not only got to the moon, but then also did a lot of other cool stuff, is the best thing ever. The perfect nosethumbing to the type of people Buzz punches in the face.
No Optimus! Join the US Navy
Other people talk about this, but I gotta be honest. My favorite moment out of ALL of Michael Bay’s TRANSFORMERS film series is Sentinel Prime’s death.   Optimus publicly executed Sentinel Prime by blasting his head in with a shotgun, while Sentinel Prime was screaming for him to stop.
I loved the savage killing in this movie savage lol
This TF3 is also one of my guilty deeply shameful pleasure lmao
Micheal Bay 100% saw that hydraulic fluid is red, immediately had his mind blown, and demanded it sprayed out of every robot.
Fortnite dance
Shockwave in the IDW comics is one of the most based fictional villains in existence.  Just thought like pointing that out.
I remember when Optimus prime said "remember kids, the Geneva convention only applies to humans" and who could forget his second line "the Geneva convention? More like Geneva suggestions!"
I remember when Optimus prime said "remember kids, the Geneva convention only applies to humans" and who could forget his second line "the Geneva convention? More Geneva suggestions!"
Whoa is this a reupload?
holy shit was that bezos with hair
I never thought how gory this film is until a couple months ago  and that other ending sounds great
yeah for some reason optimus is very cold blooded in this movies, and then proceeds to lecture the audience about peace or smt. in my circle of friends shooting someone in the back or back stabbing is called the optimus maneuver
I remember liking these movies when they came out but I can’t remember _why_ I had transformer toys as a kid and really liked the dinosaur/animal transformer cgi cartoon thing but eh??
15:23 yo a fellow bad business enjoyer
Somebody forgot about Beast Wars.
17:16 anyone else notice megatron's wheels on his feet were clipping into the ledge of lincoln's chair?
Intimidation lowers what...???  It lowers Attack, I can't believe I'm not seeing anyone mentioning this.
You gotta do The Big Lebowski soon, it’s not good ol’ 21st action but it’s definitely a wack movie that needs debriefing
these movies fucking BOP while high as fuck
Catastrophically badass 🙏🙏🙏
man sometimes i forget people can't turn off their empathy
Actually saw somewhere but I’m not sure if it’s true but apparently there was concept art that the shockwave we see isn’t him it’s a clone
Honestly, it would be cool if transformers got some dedicated movies now that focused more on the OG style of the transformers that did NOT have netflix in charge. (Honestly, it felt weird to not have a single episode that focused on before shit hit the fan)
Good job with this video 👍
Regarding Energon. Energon being the main blood/lubricant is still BLUE in the live-actions movies but remember that during the “last days” of the war in Cybertron, all of the energon supplies were dangerously low in which the transformers had to rely on gunpowder weaponry as an alternative. If we shoot 9mm pistol rounds, then the transformers can have 120mm tank shells as their 9mm.  The majority of transformers now lack a lot of Energon which is why many use modified red energon as their blood. Now we must understand that red energon is intended to be used for ammunition due to how explosive it is, most energon plasma weapons use red energon (Bumblebee was meant to have a super-heated white plasma cannon but that would have drained his red energon drastically).  If you ask what’s the deal with green energon in some of the transformers, then that my friend is basically an energy drink and a drug, such energon can make a transformer more awake, more agile, faster, aggressive, etc.   There’s also dark energon which is found under the Earth
I'm disappointed Mel Gibson wasn't the one who revealed the moon landing conspiracy to Sam. :(
"Big shuttle", well now i need one to get my sides from orbit
Fox leaving was bad, i love this movie though, i do find it hilarious that Sam with a presidential fucking medal cant get a job.  Like come on.   Also, I think they did handle the transition pretty easily by setting the film a few years later, in an entirely different part of the country.  So it makes sense sam moves on from model A to model B.   If you wanna REALLY  see Mr Bay love nasa, watch armageddon.
Holy crap, Mikaela being in Carly's place does make so much sense How did I not see that
Yeah but that transforms game I had on my DS was peak gaming
"this is probably the most violent PG-13 movie I can think of"-  there is another one, Alita Battle Angel. That movie would be hard R if it wasnt cyborg on cyborg violence
"Optimus the humans have something called the Geneva Convent-" "GENEVACON MUST BE STOPPED"
Couldn’t watch it when it was uploaded for some reason, so I waited through the whole night until i could watch it, and I don’t regret it…, A Great video about a Great movie ❤
24:49 Is that a threat, a promise, or both.   Also, Sentinel got exactly what he deserved.
where that dark and edgy pokemon movie from?, it does not look like the kind of movie I would enjoy at all and I have a feeling once I see it I will most likely be like "I am not sure what I expected" but I am morbidly curious none the less
I get so much nostalgia from this movie looking back it’s a bad movie but I always remember sitting with my brothers so we can just rewatch the fight scenes
I unironically love this movie
"Trans Theories". Not a name I'd pick for my channel.
Such crap movies 😂
I've been waiting for this video...and its finally here...and i agree i also like this movie even with its flaws its my guilty pleasure  in the same way it is for you.
TF3 is when Optimus Prime went from cute to turbo based
Not sure how I feel about the Jab at a series that honors the fallen and depicts brutal war stories being compared to Tranformers
Fantastic Le-choke
20:55 This flick and Rampage just have Chicago getting utterly annihilated. XD
Whoooaaaa
*Using "Going in full trottle"* Points for respect *Energon being blue, using g1 as example* Points lost
I give a like for all videos right in the first minutes. No need to watch it to the end (which I always do anyways) to give a like. All the videos in this channel are my favorites.
Oh dear Megan Fox.what did you do to yourself...
Huh weird, I actually kinda liked Revenge of the Fallen (not as a whole but certain sequences) and thought Dark of the Moon was a steaming turd.
Yeah but Carly was a g1 og character. So, this movie automatically  got better because of it.
I agree with you- I really like the movie but have no idea why
RIP JAZZ RIP OPTIMUS SIKE RIP IRON HIDE RIP SIDESWIPE RIP RACHET RIP MIRAGE FRFR THO just found out mirages voice actor died a week after the film released
=-)
I don’t recall the Deceptions’ signature upon the Geneva Conventions.
I still remember going to Chicago for a day (exciting as I live in a tiny il town) and seeing part of the downtown set for this movie!!! Was so cool seeing an entire street just destroyed and I’m pretty sure it’s why my family went to see the movie in theaters lol
This is so Pointless. I love it.
Yeah I love this movie, dotm aoe are my top 2 films. The tone to this movie was pretty cool being apocalyptic felt so real like it’s aliens ffs. The action was amazing I remember being a kid shaking hoping to get to the end w all my fav characters alive such a thrill
I saw this movie when it came out. I have no recollection of any of this.
The only reason I watched this film is because I am a Chicagoan and for some reason I love seeing my city destroyed in movies lol
Pikachu!!!
OPTIMUS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  **Gets fucking executed**
Yes
You have a really nice voice
I hated that they killed Ironhide and that they never mentioned him at all after the fact
If only the original ending was kept.  If it did it would have been my favorite bay film (yes I did enjoy TF3).  Also I loved the part where the music from the intro of Transformers season 1 G1, it was so unexpected I loved it.  Now the question is, will you do a video on Transformers 4, 5 and the Bumblebee movie
From that part about Megan Fox, apparently Bay truly had no problem with Fox since he hired her for one of the TMNT movies a few years later.
A transformers video cool, wonder how it will start..... So you know Pokèmon?
I love dotm
I have to be honest, I always thought Sentinel Prime kinda looked like F. Murray Abraham
we need a truce - Megatron Transformers 3 PROCEADS TO GET VIOLENTLY MURDERD
More please <3
It’s funny. I was a little kid when these movies came out, and I watched them on repeat. I was too young to see how bad the plot was in the series, but I didn’t care because big robots fighting. Now that I’m older and can recognize just how silly the writing was for these movies, it is very nostalgic. Great videos man 👍
10:30 12:00 18:30 21:10
the film actually had 1,000,000 uncredited monkeys at typewriters work on the script
"Chicago is an occupied nation by fascist dictators", scene example prominently displays a transformer who's alternate form is a mercedes
Honestly my favorite movie review channel
you should do the 1986 transformers movie
"he uses intimidation to lower special defense" bro as a pokemon player that hurt my soul
The only scene in this movie that I recall is Optimus meeting Buzz Aldrin. It is fun and I think that it has the sort of unapologetic praise of adventure and heroism that all superhero fiction should have at its core. That being said I shut this movie off at the Deep Wang scene 10+ years ago, never finished it, and have never watched any of the live action movies since.
Dark of the Moon took everything wrong about Revenge of the Fallen and did it right, as well as improved on the first. It also nailed the landing as the third film as well as ending the series. It's also Michael Bay and the trilogy at it's finest  I also think the film ending is much more fitting for Megatron. Megatron was a ruthless psychopath who would rather die (as he did... twice) than agree to peace with Optimus
2:40 actually you are not alone here. Filmento also made a review of this movie where he said it was good
Im with you on having super fat nostalgia glasses, i remember watching this one and the other 2 over and over again... Probably why mecha is my favorite anime genre of all time.. Though admittedly when marky boi showed up i hated them.
Even tho I would love to see you hate on 4 and 5 what about the bee movie spin off?
i saw this movie as a wee lad at the drive in with my family and i remember being absolutely shook over the dark and bleak depiction of invasion in this movie, because of that it definitely was my favorite for a long while, though i know recognize its flaws. so it will absolutely always have a little place in my heart
man, they should've quit while they where ahead instead of making transformers 4
To 8 year old me this movie felt like a hamlet level drama.
Seen the first one and, that's about it.
That is a quality use of that JonTron "WTF".
I see I’m not the only one who likes Drak side of the moon
If you want the plot to make sense, there’s a madman named John Barber, writer for IDW Comics, who pieced all the terrible writing together in a way that actually works.
Soundwave is the best Deceptacon.
I'm so glad to see that Cody loves RLM as much as I do.
It's not blood and pee if it's a robot. it's lube and coolant.  As for the ultimate plan...the question isn't why the space bridge didn't come up earlier was because Megatron needed the all-spark (first movie) or the Matrix to revive Sentinel Prime.  My actual problem with the movie? I'm with you on the too  human Autobot faces, but I have one more: Sentinel standing up looked too much like a freaking Gundam, and not in a way that made sense. OK have scutum and a sword (even if Gundams used thinner swords with scutums, ie, the more Roman look; and the one that had a spear and shield had a small round spear, supposedly Chinese but just looked like a Macedonian royal peltast with a Chinese spearhead and a dragon arm), but he's a truck, what the hell are those wing-like things on his back? They're not even undeployed beam cannons like on some artillery units in Gundam. By contrast Decepticons looking like Predators and Aliens had one sort of basis in cannon: the Quintessons' goons and the ones on the junk planet.
Honestly, I've said this before, and I'll say it again-  I actually think Age of Extinction is one of the better films, (probably due to me watching it on it's own, as sort of it's own thing)  And from that point of view, it's.. very solidly structured.  It gives a reason for Optimus to be the way he is (even if it is still out of character with Optimus in general if we go by the original G1 version), the characters are just way less annoying (seriously, Sam was just irritating and whiny in my eyes. Cade actually felt like he cared about the Cybertronians as more than just "oh he's my car."), The designs for the robots (while a horrendously stupid idea to eliminate basically most of the vehicle kibble that made them look like they could transform) I thought were just more pleasing, and Galvatron (despite the bitforming abomination that is his transformation. God that is fucking stupid.) was actually seriously intimidating! Same with Lockdown.  Yes it continues the Bayverse trend of "oh, actually the Cybertronians are here for THIS reason that happened even BEFORE the other-"  but if we do view it as its own thing, I think it's just a strong Transformers film, even if still heavily flawed.  Also John Goodman as Hound is like, the best thing we've had ever.
I just watched dark of the moon 2 days ago . I love it it doesn't make since at all and its perfect
I remembered the movie title was Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon. Is it just me?  In any case yeah, I always got confused to why Optimus have to kill Megatron after he helped him.
Sentinel is a funnier character than we've had before.
Ya know I’d probably glorify the military industrial complex too if giant evil robots rained from the sky every other week to murder us and destroy cities
I never paid enough attention to the plot to realize that Carly working for the bad guy's car collection was supposed to be Mikaela.
I completely forgot Buzz Aldrin was in this movie, what the hell.
Patrick...Swayze??
The first time I watched this on DVD at a friend's house, we spent more time making fun of the movie than actually watching it. Two of the best parts were when Sentinel and Optimus were in Africa, I said that the camera slowly pans to the right, focusing on two dogs mating while Michael Bay loudly declares himself the director and can do what he wants while the editors try to kick him out of the studio. The other was when Starscream got his eyes blown out, I paused the movie and dramatically declared 'How ironic, after a lifetime of seeing, Starscream was now blind', and the entire room fell apart. Unironically a better time.
I remember being angry as a kid when I learned they hired Imagine Imagine Dragon, instead of Likinpark for the music.
People can say what they want about Dark of the moon but it has always been and will always be my favorite Transformers movie right next TF 1
Obviously Shockwave is Fremen, he controls metal Shai Hulud
Age of extinction will be uploaded in approximately next millennium or so
You're one movie away from the Transformer that ruined every Michael Bay movie for me.
Two words Cody: Guilty Pleasure
This is 1a behind the first Transformers
Someone said it! This movie’s fucked up!
I had 8 years when this movie came out and to say i love it is an understatement. Yes, even the warcrimes
I also like the 2007 Transforms movie. And other dumb movies like Die Another Day.  As well as remembering Neil Armstrong movie staring Ryan Gosling.
I can't speak to the Movie continity, but the standardized back story to transformers is that the Autobots are the middle and upper class defending themselves and the Decepticons are the Rebels. Despite Optimus's ideals, believing freedom is the right of all sentient being and actively speaking out against the corruption of Cybertron's leadership, ultimately the Autobots were just people defending themselves from an uprising lower and slave class.
Weird how the reupload removed the 10 minute segment on how hot Megan Fox is. What’s that about?
Remember it's not a war crime if you win
Intimidation lowers attack in Pokemon not SP Defence.
You should recommend everyone to watch the original Transformers cartoon since it's available completely for free by Hasbro on Youtube. I've discovered it recently and have been binging. It's exactly the kind of cheesy that speaks to my soul, 10/10
Like I know this movie is highkey bad but I fuckin enjoy it well at least most of it
HEY, intimidation lowers defense, not special defense.
The battlefield 2042 reference was funny I'll admit
Carly was a character in the 80s cartoon. She and Sam, well Spike, had a son named Daniel together. I'm surprised they didn't have her in the  first movie.
I still hope you cover age of extinction sometime. Ironhide and the other more unique bots were the coolest thing to me as a kid. Also robot dinosaurs
i've been looking forward to this
Some of my personal favorite moments in this video: 13:19 "Astrotrain? Is that you?" 19:12 That was my favorite joke in this entire review! I am also going to point out that a YouTuber by the pseudonym Phoenix Studios is rewriting Michael Bay's _Transformers_ movies and those rewrites are surprisingly great! He finished his rewrite of _Transformers_ and _Transformers 2,_ and is currently rewriting _Transformers 3_  with Part 1 finished. Some memorable moments include his _Transformers_ rewrite cutting out the entire romance sub-plot altogether and focusing on building a father & son relationship with Sparkplug & Spike while adding scenes where the Autobots get used to Earth culture, or his _Transformers 2_ rewrite where Bumblebee learns the film's lesson of faith in leadership. Go check out these rewrites when you have the free time, especially if you don't even want to spend money on buying any of these movies!
Been waiting on this since you reviewed the first movie. Gotta do all five now😂
To be fair, OG cartoons didn't have death in the way the movies (especially this one) do, since death wasn't generally allowed and was still taboo. If it happened, it had to be rare. Ntm it's about merchandising, so characters need to prove to be killed to sell. Movies don't have the same limitations for merchandising marketing
I'm subscribed I meant subtle in in the old English vernacular as in not subtle at all i busted a gut
When I was a kid since I am from Chicago and used to live there  I believed that it was real for some reason when the city got destroyed  And war can change anyone right? Even Optimus Heheh
I just wanna know what the hell was that live action Pokemon he was showing.
This movie and the Universal ride (that's basically just the Spiderman ride again which is why I like it) are the only things I vividly remember about this series. I've seen all of them once and I can't remember them  Well I do kinda remember hating the video game of the first movie to I guess
Ya know, for whatever reason, even when you explain something you don't like about the movie, then show a corresponding clip to illustrate your point, even those clips made me remember how absolutely bad A this film was. I think that's the biggest difference between this and Revenge of The Fallen lol. This movie was actually freaking cool.
I liked the part where the alien robots blew up Chicago was probably the only good part of the film
Transformers 3 is my favorite one
I just died 🤣
They sure didn't 😂😂😂😂
Cody I can’t trust anything you say anymore. I’ll forgive historical inaccuracies even if you would have just lied you’re whole career I wouldn’t have minded. But the fact you said that that Pokémon use intimidation to lower special defense? Intimidation lowers physical attack. I can’t believe you anymore.
Bay's response to Megan Fox's comment:  "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show up on time. Movies are not always warm and fuzzy."
Optimus Prime went from G1 to Shattered Glass real fast in the Bayverse.
17:14 Megatron's wheels clipping through the chair.
I have somehow watched and loved this movie my whole life without noticing the exact replacement parallels between Carly and Mikayla in the script 😂 I feel like such a goober for never noticing
Big booms make movies more entertaining when the writing is bad.
Revenge Of The Fallen is my favorite of the live-action movies. F**k you, fight me. >:-(
The edits on this are top notch. My jaw hurts from laughing  Now I want all the Bayformers movies with the G1 voices the way they sounded in the cartoon
I kinda like the third entry purely for the sheer violence and apocalyptic imagery. Although as a slav, I'm culturaly obligated to make an incredibly violent eyeroll when Chernobyl is brought up.
Hot take: Shockwave's redesign in this movie is actually really damn good looking. The only thing I'd change is making him purple again.
Do bumblebee next
Gotta say, I've never watched a film channel expecting to love it, but your comedy is absolutely on point. I'm definetly not the only one who thinks so either, don't think i've ever seen a new channel explode so fast. It's like you're describing all our inner monologues when we saw these movies years ago. Very well done!!
Which Trans theories video is he referencing
Are you going to review that? 0:43
ngl i like and enjoy Age of Extinction even with its flaws the last knight is a sad cliffhanger cus I wanted the finale to everything for T6 even if it was not part of the lore u knew it was heading somewhere
If you could only have one would it be Spider-Man 3 or Transformers Dark of the moon?                    I chose bitches
the last 3rd of the movie is what sold people to the point the cinema we went to is crowded af
Hhhhh
I love all the films for a single reason, they ARE my childhood (I love almost all transformer things) I think I watched these movies when I was three. Anyways I love all transformer things… I need to go watch the animated movie again.
But Intimidation lowers attack...
I wish we had gotten the peaceful ending, would've felt a lot better knowing the Decepticons and Autobots didn't really hate each other anymore.
Love the video, are you going to continue with the rest of the Bayverse and the Bumblebee movie? I'd like to see your take on that
That drake and josh spherical popup made me giggle like a child for minutes
Was it not called dark side of the moon
I'm gonna be real here. "Who would you be without me? Prime." "Time to find out" followed by ripping Megatrons head off, Is a response completely out of character for Optimus Prime, but by god if my chimp brain doesn't go ooga booga mode every time i hear that cold ass line delivery.
Nah, that design makes enough sense for Shockwave. He's always kinda been like that, ever since the iconic Transformers #5 in 1985 where he killed all the Autobots and hung their corpses up in his base.  Also sad at PH ignoring the entirely of the Unicron Trilogy and Beast Wars as though it was unimportant. It actually did very well.
transformers dark of the moon: is rated pg 13  also transformers dark of the moon: turns chicago into a apocalyptic warzone where giant robots are blasting people onscreen into nothing left but ash and bone
Honestly don't mind the goofy nerd stuff. Circle jerk the moon landing and NASA (esp instead of the military), fighting in 'cool' places like Chernobyl, the deceptions edgy ass names. Just take the sexist shit and war crimes out of it and it's perfect man child swill haha
In the original animated movie, Optimus was going to put down Megatron like a rabid dog while he was begging for mercy (okay, Megatron was trying to distract Optimus while he was going for a gun, but Optimus didn't seem to know that).
Now we're going to endlessly ask you for Transformers Age of Extension video.
You know, I'll say this. Mikaela was quite underrated in the first movie. She has a backstory with her dad being in prison, a skill that works for the story, had some actually depth to her character, and straight up saved Bumblebee while Sam was freaking out, and then proceeded to help kill Brawl! She was the shit. Like Thew said, she was too good for Sam. Shame about losing her.
Dark of the Moon's portrayal of Shockwave as a big stupid idiot with a big stupid pet worm is a war crime
Yeah!!! War Crimes!!!!
They did the Dinobots dirty in the Marky Mark films
Dont worry @PointlessHub, I also remember "First Man". One of my faves.
Mikey is Kaboom man. I was embarrassed that I watched Bayfomers first and not the original G1. I finished the entire G1 series like months ago.
Why are alien ships always crash landing. Do they not have landing gear.
I like to think that Optimus growing more and more brutal was intentional and that he just gets fed up of caring and actually tries to win instead of just prolonging the conflict.
I can't wait for Michael bay to make a live action reboot of Robotech/Macross
I'm so happy that I watched it on a movie theater. The image of giant robots dwarfing me in my seat, thunderous explosions and gunshots shaking my innards and blasting that soundtrack like the orchestra was right next to me. It's was awesome in the most correct use of the word.
I honestly would have loved watching Optimus and Megatron, former enemies, team up and show just how oddly supportive their styles are to each other, but are still being beaten and matched by Sentinel on his own. It would've been a mainstay of this trilogy, something that would've blown every teenage mind seeing two mortal enemies suddenly work together. It's probably something that's happened in almost every iteration of Transformers: Optimus and Megatron somehow teaming up, and it was taken just a step further with one of the shows by having them actually mesh together super well as teammates, a sort of "unstoppable teammates, fated to be enemies" feeling to how if the two were on the same side they'd be unmatched. It would also further prove and elevate Sentinel's status as a fighter, as if everything else wasn't enough. He had the balls and strength to bully Megatron around, and at one point managed to handle about half of the surviving Autobots plus Optimus at once, before coming to face his protégé and the same opponent he bullied together at once, and still narrowly losing. It'd be a decent enough message about how Sentinel's extreme devotion to his planet alone, and his unwavering commitment to keeping his enemies as they are and never willing to compromise, would eventually turn his two new enemies, themselves former opponents, into allies-a coalition against an agreed greater evil.
You are now obligated to finish the series, painful as it may be
I think its implied the whole moon conspiracy was Soundwave's plan while Megatron was missing in the years before TF1 and when Megatron is awakened, he takes ownership of this plan.
This movie's unapologetic "muricaness" is endearing in an odd way
Watching PointlessHub cover these at the same time as Cosmonaut Variety Hour is a blessing
I love Dark of the Moon, not because it’s actually good but because it’s so batshit insane that even when it’s not being good it’s still enjoyable.  Standout moment is Optimus Prime executing his former mentor by shooting him in the head with a shotgun while said mentor pleads for his life,
I love these videos, but Cody serious question...Where is my alternative history fix?!!!
Wait, they made another transformers movie after dark side of the moon?
Finally, the peak, it's only downhill from here (Bumblebee's an exception)
"No Optimus-" Gets war crimed
not gonna lie. this was a big "guilty" pleasure of mine as well in my childhood.
I gotta admire how Multiverse of Madness, Transformers and Batman vs Tmnt can show brutal violence than something like the Venom movies ever could
We will have a nice break when we get to the bumblebee movie
i will say this about this whole saga you're building here.  i can't wait for the Bumblebee movie to get here and to hear the good vibes and praise for it from ya dude.
This Was My Favorite movie as a kid and still is i rember seeing it in cinemas and thinking it was awesome i still hum the battle thems and ost of the movie
The first 3 Transformers movies are guilty pleasures of mine. But Mark Wahlberg didn't really stand out for me. Aside from him opening up a cool refreshing Bud Light when he crashes into the Bud Light ^TM transportation vehicle.
Hmmm... Did the Russo brothers' Ultron come from Optimus Prime suddenly learning sick Mortal Kombat moves while he has been learning all the Earth languages at the same time?
I am still stunned that they didn't just recast Megan Fox and instead invented a new character.
Run is the correct response.
18:00 I always interpreted it as Sentinal and Megatron made a deal after he was revived in the time of the movie, not a long time ago.
I liked Dark Of The Moon. Did it have good writing? No, but i love the part where they blow each other up.
I liked this movie a lot. But yeah, war crimes and such.
IDK man, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' (1984) is pretty violent.
I FREAKING LOVE THESE TRANSFORMERS MOVIES!! If only they didn't replace my boy Sam the following two movies.
Ngl, TLK makes AOE look like peak cinema.
I hate how pathetic they made Megatron in these movies. This movie and the second one made him someone's bitch and he gets taken out in an instant here. Not even any last words. And then he sort of gets ressed in the next one and it's treated as if he's a gigantic threat when he's proven several times to just be incompetent.
I remember how furious the Transformers fandom on Tumblr was over Ironhide's death. It was like a celebrity died.
The framing of this is GOAT’d
The SpongeBob cuts get me every time😂
I wish I was lying when I say I dropped everything I was doing to watch this
This was the first film I saw in theatres with a friend and I almost walked out at the 2 hour mark
to me, even if all this, it was really good as all original trilogy. Next movies fucking sucked.
Wait, that makes no sense. How was Mikayla going to be put in charge of this car collection? Yeah, she's a mechanic but she's a commoner. This wouldn't really fit with Dylan's motive of wanting the best. Actually, the Decepticons were content with just having prisoners until Dylan told them to kill. The Autobots on the other hand were always kill first.
God I remember being hyped as hell as kid for this movie. My parents taking me to watch the filming of the highway chase right down the road from us and going to see filming in Chicago. This really was the last of my childhood before I "grew up".
Transformers videos is NOT what I thought a channel called "Tran Theories" would make videos on
Yes🙌!! I've been rewatching your video on pt.2 for a few days since I found your channel, this is a nice surprise after getting out of work.
Great video. I've always loved this movie, and despite its imperfections, it was a great ending to the first trilogy.  But I also have an announcement to make:  Unlike many other people (including you) I actually LOVE Age Of Extinction (aside from that horrible Romeo & Juliet Law scene), and I thought that the plot, while not perfect, was a step in the right direction, and Lockdown was the best villain we've had in these movies!
These videos remind me that I once did watch them, specifically the first two and nothing more.
piss. Real. Pin this alternatehimsteryhole
Did you intentionally mean to call Patrick Dempsey "Patrick Swayze" as joke?
unironically it was the transformers movies that made me wanna join the army when i was like 6 watching this i instantly fell in love with the military industrial complex it was just bad ass
Great video! Sadly, you said Intimidate lowers special defense instead of attack, so you must now perish
It completely went over my head just how violent and unhinged these movies were as a youngin'. Definitely something that maybe I shouldn't have seen... but cool robots so... (Also still miss the homie Ironhide to this day. He got done so dirty.)
Not gonna lie, I laughed at this whole thing.
As a big Decepticon fan, DOTM is the only movie I like since this was finally their moment to shine. Of course their personalities are not existent, and it does the same thing Fallen does by having them be sidestepped by a new, all-important baddie who's never been mentioned until now.   Still, for a short, glorious half hour, my favorite murder robots kicked ass, flexed on the humies, and did some epic war crimes. Thankfully, they all die and none of them have to suffer the torture of being in the next two movies.
Finally I have been waiting for months
One of the few YouTubers I get hyped for
Sad they had to go to Chicago to film this
What's more messed up was I KIND OF liked it when Optimus Prime fks up Megatron and Sentinel Prime. Optimus gave Sentinel multiple chances to make things right, and each time he spits it in his face and Sentinel was ready to KILL Optimus Prime if Megatron hadn't stepped in. After Optimus' father figure almost kills him, Optimus was done with everyone and he straight up kills everyone, which I really enjoy.
Hearing what could have been bums me out a little
Optimus decapitating Megatron is cool, but only if someome else could have done it rather than Optimus.
Yes
20:56 As a Chicagoan is feel the same way  MidWest love
I remember buying the novelization when it was first released, because I'm a dork like that. I enjoyed the ending. Then I watched the movie, and Optimus ripping off Megatron's head legitimately shocked me.
I thought this movie was a great finish to the trilogy and felt so much better than revenge of the fallen
I think there’s probably some truth to Spielberg being upset about the Hitler line, he’s Jewish after all. Saying that as another Jew, I’d probably get slightly weirded out by someone with the personality of Megan Fox making a joke like that. The replies to this will probably be hell lmao but I hope someone appreciates the perspective :)
I can safely assume you have never played Call of Duty World at War with your blanket statement at 8:49. I will now wait for you to tell me you actually have and make me look like a total idiot in the regard that you have. Only for me to say your still kinda dumb cause World at War actually does a really good job at portraying war as hell on earth, or at least the closest we’ll ever see to it.
This film is a drug trip while watching it and I love it and I will continue to love it
Amazing work!  I always enjoy watching your videos.  What are your thoughts on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor?
i like to think that optimus feel off the deep end, going from a stoic leader who only killed if absolutely necessary to a war criminal due to the toxicity of earth and the human race in this continuity
I feel like it's important to note that a lot of the plot points in this movie are from the original cartoon (much more than the first 2). Namely: enslave humanity and teleport cybertron to earth (the ultimate doom) and force the autobots of earth then kill them (Megatron's master plan)
if you enjoyed this video like subscribe leave can you get food comment
I actually recently rewatched this film and can say, my dislike for this movie comes from being a fan of Transformers in general cuz really, this movie doesn’t feel all too dissimilar from RoTF in my eyes  I don’t dislike it overall or outright, but I wouldn’t say I like it either. Sentinel was a good villain tho, I enjoyed him
You are correct, I do like it just for the last hour, but I also just enjoy the movie in general. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it was a pretty decent end to a great trilogy. I just wish it stayed that way, even though I do really want to see Unicron.
Trans Theories, that name sure isn´t misleading...
As someone who's never seen these movies but enjoys seeing other people talk about them, Dark of the Moon seems to weirdly slip out of people's minds. Transformers '07 is the one that started it all (for better or for much worse). Revenge of the Fallen proved that Transformers '07 wasn't an accident and that it was only going to be downhill from there. Age of Extinction... was just so, so bad in so many ways (probably the most infamous. I haven't even seen it, and I'm 1,000% confident in my opinion). The Last Knight was the jump the shark, last chance movie that utterly failed. But Dark of the Moon is often left out of the story for some reason.
This movie somehow managed to both traumatize and inspire the 11 year old me back then, and I know I'm not alone
I don't think it was Bay passing off the blame to Spielberg. Spielberg is Jewish and made a little movie callled Schindler's List where he explicitly worked with holocaust survivors, so it is very believable that her comparing Bay to Hitler very much offended him. And justifiably so.
Can't be a war criminal if they're not subject to the Geneva Convention or Hague.
The most fascinating thing about these movies, *especially the sequels,* is just how little I retained of the plot even while watching them. I was genuinely surprised to hear the place they god the fuel scrotum was Chernobyl. I didn't just forget the ussr was involved in the plot of this movie, I had never known that. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times. The dialogue literally just went in one ear and out the other lmao. Other things that surprised me to learn about this movie: -the final battle is in chigago. -Not-megan-fox was working in the car co'llection place (I half forgot this but I'm fairly certain I thought they were like, on a tour when I watched this movie as a kid) -the worm is shockwave -Basically everything related to the pillars in general. I understood the pillars were the macguffins and they were on the moon. That was it. The twist of there being more pillars was totally lost on me. I just went "oh there's more pillars okay."  Just completely and totally checked out of the plot, genuinely just here for the robots  The plot, as far as I was concerned was macguffins on moon, decepticons go get all the macguffins, macguffins summon cybertron (?), add fight scenes as needed.
Oh god, are you doing the next one? Truthfully I’m looking forward to your opinion, but I pray for your soul…
@0:34 "Chris-Tuh-Phuuuh!"
I really love this movie as well. Recently rewatched these films and had so many laughs by the constant crude and offensive humor. This film has the deep government conspiracy and over the top robot violence. It’s so crazy and I will never not enjoy this.  To be honest I would rather watch these films then recent big franchise films. I feel like this film is so much better written then say the last Star Wars film or certain Superhero films. And I much prefer this film compared to the Bumblebee movie, which was like the 2007 movie all over but so much blander.!
Midwest bois represent 😄
The only thing I actually like about Age of Extinction is Lockdown. I think he is honestly a really compelling character.
The fact that Hello Kitty is the 2nd most successful franchise in the world and nobody talks about it ever.
13:19 "Big Shuttle" is no joke. That's the whole reason the Artemis program got funding. The shuttle parts manufacturers got used to the giant NASA contracts. I mean, FFS, they're using the exact same boosters that were used on the shuttle program, with very little modification!!
Jeff
You know, for some reason I have the novelization of this movie. No idea why.
Oh finally its here
Thing about the Romeo and Juliet thing is that as far as I kind, tell it was pointless. The age of consent in Texas is 17.
14:19
Megan Fox was never a worthwhile addition. Nether was LeBouf. The whole franchise was mess from minute 1.
I could never get over that a few Gepards or VADE would have cut down most of the decepticon units.
This is the first time ive seen somebody other than me parrot my exact feelings on this movie. I know its bad. I kbow its *really* bad. But that doesnt stop me from loving it less.
Ok what the fuck was that pokemon movie you played alongside the detective pikachu and where can i get it
I really don’t vibe with the “war criminal lunatic” take of Optimus everyone seems to agree on.  Firstly it hit me how awful it must be this war in War for cybertron when Starscream said “I’ve guarded this station for a millennium”  These beings are immortal and have been fighting a war for longer than some civilizations on earth have been around. Optimus at this point has lost almost everything and the absolute only thing he has left is earth and the family he’s made on it.  I’d kill a traitor to my kind as well as a dude who made an entire faction called “Decepticons” because I know if I let him live he will stab me in the back
All of the movies have a special touch and it’s kinda unexplainable but that’s the transformers for you a franchise that’s awesome and questionable but overall fun to watch
Here's a REALLY dark secret: I hate this movie, but I really like Age of Extinction, I think it's really fun and the characters are way better than the last two. 5 is shockingly shit though
Midwest baby!
The human side of the big fight felt straight out of a Battlefield campaign. You could play the BF4 main theme during the collapsing tower sequence and it fits the scene like a glove.
“Remember when the transformers bombed Iran? I didn’t.” Easily the funniest shit I think I have ever heard in my life
Clearly written by somebody who never picked up a Transformers comic. You think the _movie_ was brutal? Bitch please. Regardless _fuck_ Michael Bay.
FUCKIN’ trigger warning before dead Prowl, bro!
I would still argue that the violence in the 86 movie was more disturbing considering we basically saw Saturday morning cartoon characters get shot and killed in combat.  Hell Starscream even had to shoot off his own foot to escape with his life.
Deep wang
oh boy, can't wait til next time so we get to approved experimentation on living beings in 1940's esque ways but it's fine because they are robots. No need to worry about if any characters were your favorite, as Humans get goverment approval to flay the skin from their robones to sell.
I was raised in a small town outside of Chicago, and when they were filming Dark Of The Moon we actually went to check out the set. Made a whole day out of it, and when we went to see it in the theatre it was fun pointing out all the landmarks and whatnot. So for that, even if it objectively sucks, it holds a special place in my heart for that reason. Midwest gang rise up!
I will not stand for any G1 deep cover slander
You almost made me fail No Nostalgia Critic November
You must have not seen Transformers: The Movie yet
Love seeing ur videos, I always stop what I’m watching when I see a new upload
This travesty is the worst TF film if you ask me. I can´t name a single positive and I had to skip though scenes to even finish. 2/10
These movies are so hard to watch because of the CGI on the Transformers themselves. They're literally so detailed that it hurts to look at because it's so confusing.  Anyway, they need to make a movie off of War For Cybertron and Fall Of Cybertron.
Truth be told, I’ve always liked the Bay designs over the original designs. I’ve never liked how blocky the old ones are.
Dark Of The Moon is actually kinda similar to to an arc in the original series. In “The Transformers: The Ultimate Doom” the decepticons use a space bridge to bring Cybertron to earth, but instead it screws with the planet and starts to tear Earth apart. They also mind controlled a bunch of humans too, and we’re going to use them as slave labor.
We all got a great Linkin Park single out of it though
Love this movie
Sooo… Optimus for Mortal Kombat 12?
I’ll never forget being in the movie theater watching Optimus fight in 3D. I will always love this movie because of that
Review Eight Crazy Nights next
i absolutely love TF3 and think it's objectively the best film out of the lot and to be frank if you skip revenge of the fallen and jump straight to dark of the moon it actually makes alot more narrative sense and only consider TF1 and TF3 cannon it actually makes way more sense.  also i know alot of people think bayverse Prime is Out of character but to be honest i love what the bay films did with Optimus i love how they portrayed him in a way more realistic fashion. regardless of if it was intentional or not you can see that Optimus is framed very much like a Soldier whose just become so war torn and broken down by the conflict he's been fighting for thousands of years.    this version of Prime is far form perfect and to be honest i was happy when he brutally ended both Megatron and Sentinal because for Optimus in that moment to take the usual cliched (naive hero spares the Murderous maniacs because he's hopeful and sees their inner goodness and he's feeding his own moral ego) BS.  this was a prime that didn't want the war WON he wanted the war FINISHED.   this ending perfectly set up why Optimus is so angry and hateful towards humanity in age of extinction (even if that film was not very good)
In the comics they explain that Optimus just gave up with being patient and said "fuck it, just die".   Which is.. Understandable counting the stakes of these movies lol
I remember seeing this when I was 10 just enjoying the braincell killing action and even I thought Optimus did Sentinel and Megatron cold.
The " tone " of all 3 of the OG Transformers was good- though Dark of the Moon got a tad carried away here and there. ROTF arguably had the best, especially the heroic final assault against the Decepitcons around the Pyramids
That Ryan Gosling space movie is the best space movie ever made and deserves more respect
Oh god what is he going to say about… the next film…
How this movie didn't get an R rating baffles me considering how graphic and brutal the violence was (especially to the innocent civilians which made me sick to my stomach. I was fine with the movie until those parts). I know there wasn't blood and gore or F bombs, but the sheer amount of disturbing deaths and violence should have earned this movie an R rating. I hate this movie and it has forever scarred me.
my war criminal😍
Excuse me comment section, why are you simping for Decepticons?
I cannot wait for your Transformers 4 vid!
Not done with the video yet, but this is probably one of my absolute favorite guilty pleasures. Right up there with small soldiers
Transformers 3 was the type of movie that sounded bad on paper (writing though writings fine imo) but amazing in execution. Who needs the story when you can have a shooty shooty bang bang! One of the few American movies my dad liked only because of the amount of action in almost each scene.
Agent Simons is easily the best part of the movie for me.
The odd thing is that i grew up with this trilogy and this was my first exposure to transformers. How shocked was I to learn about the G1 and the other series after Bay's movies...
"Trans Theories"
Oh my god this is probably my favorite video you have ever made
Why did you include the Spyro soundtrack in the vid?
One of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. And I love old Transformers
It stills bewilders me how Dark Of The Moon’s ending was changed because the comic adaptation was leaked months in advance
W video as always, laughed almost the whole video. This movie is my childhood and hearing you point out all the problems with it all I could do is laugh. Love❤️
I wish they just cast a new girl as Mikaela. Might as well, they did that before. Like just look at Iron Man 2, that came out a year before Dark of the Moon. Just recast the character. I was wondering why they even bothered trying to shoehorn in a new character. Her working at a car place really made no sense to me and now it does cause it was supposed to be Megan Fox's character.
i love mindless killing and merciless destruction. if somebody disagrees with you kill them
I love this movie. It's big dumb. But it's big fun. Glad to see it get some appreciation instead of just brushed-off. Optimus Prime did nothing wrong.
Great video Cody. Have you ever thought of doing a video about the tv series transformers prime and comparing it to the movie “ saga?”
Nothing sums up this movie better than it starting with THE tracking shot and my dad and I just awkwardly staring straight forward
Patrick Swayze?
When I watched this movie I thought it was okay but repeated the same thing like the last one but with less substance. The human side of things was weak with them being there for reasons especially for the ending since you could cut them out and nothing would change. And with the fourth one... yeah I never watched the fifeth one after watching that one even if the human lead wasn't Sam again.
They did ironhide dirty. Other than that ok movie
i seriously hurt from ironhide's lame ass death
If I had a nickel for every good Transformers film, I'd have 2 nickels. Which isn't alot, but I'm glad I have them.
Man this shit is like heroin. Like god damn I have never clicked on a video faster.
This movie is honestly my favourite film of all time. I like it for what it is but I just have an absolute blast with it every time I watch it. I am incredibly nostalgic with this film and I still think it’s a really good summer blockbuster.
Dark of the moon was cool as shit. I loved the violence. It wasn’t great but I enjoyed tf out of it
Thank you for being Nostalgia Critic so that we will not.
4 > 5 > 1 > 3 > 2  There. That wasn't so bad. Now to deal with the shame ...
the superior aspect ratio
"Somehow..." and "the entire catalyst of this film has no explanation" reminds me of the third film in another divisive movie trilogy
I'll disagree with the analogy with the hypotetical pokemon movie, Transformers was pretty much strong with Beast Wars and the Unicron Trilogy before the 07 movie came out, many new fans were made in the process. Regarding the rest of the vídeo, yeah, i agree. DOTM is pee pee pooo poo.
God, I think this is the single greatest video Cody has ever put out: "Here's something I love, and here's everything wrong with it and why you should hate it"
Thank you for putting which sequential order this movie came out. Their naming scheme and sameness make it extremely difficult
I feel like Dark of the Moon would've be way better if it was R-Rated mostly to have a great Trilogy end in a bang
Video @PointlessHub mentioned from transtheorys  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdeAExtmSV0
The Patrick Dempsey Recognition League has been notified.
It’s only a war crime if you lose
Um it's patrick dempsey
Everyone always told me this version of optimus sucks, mainly because of the war crimes. But in my opinion he was great.  Optimus in the original cartoon was fighting mainly a bunch of goofballs. (Muwahaha we just took over this oil field!) However in this trilogy hes fighting actual war crazed violent psychopaths.  And how would you react when your enemy is commiting a bunch of war crimes? You commit some right back. Honestly this movie was great in my humble opinion
Amongst TF fans, DotM is highly regarded as the second best Michael Bay movie. If a bunch of the Michael Bay humor was taken out it'd be a great movie.
Ok you said it as a joke but calling the balrog Wing Master sounds rad to me. But I grew up with Transformers and GI Joe and the like so I might just be broken 🙃
"most PG-13 movie i can think of" Master and Commander: Far side of the Earth
Dark of the moon is epic also avp is way more violent than dark of the moon
If pokémon was just a fad, we would’ve never gotten the Iconic phase “pokémon go to the polls”
Carly is also a G1 reference to Spike Whitwhickey’s girlfriend and later wife. (as we know because of the 1986 movie.)
These edits with the Bob of sponge are fucking hilarious.
9:53 Not the first kind of facism Mercedes worked for.
*Fun Fact:* Japan (where Transformers originates, kind of) has this thing with robots where, if it wasn't piloted by a human a la Gundam, it was seen as kiddy.  When Bayformers came out, they were shocked.
It’s basically like, bayformers 1 and 2 are call of duty and call of duty zombies respectively. Then the third movie is war of the worlds meets Independence Day with some mortal kombat level brutality sprinkled in for flavour.
In g1 megatron carefully removed lincoln before sitting down. In dark of the moon he obliterated Lincoln before sitting down.
Thx I've been waiting for this video
The best Trabsformers movie
Great video, lots of nice editing touches
I suspect we will find out Spielberg was not a good guy after all.
People thinks Hideo Kojima's games are deep, but nobody cannot compete with Michael Bay's Transformers movies
Something I think that makes DoTM great is just how far one direction it goes, until it loops back around to being amazing.
I love the Beats Pill™
Michael Bay said months ago that he should have listened to Spielberg and stopped after Dark of the Moon. Stating he should have stopped after Dark of the Moon. What came after Dark of the Moon with the exception of Bumblebee were really bad.
can you go through the trilogies that didn't fair as well? your videos are amazing!
Between this an the POTC trilogy i‘m still amazed by how good late 2000s CGI was in some of these big budget productions.  As for the movie itself, I think a lot of people who were kids at the time like this movie because the entire second half just feels like the reflection of a kids imagination given a bunch of toy cars. Alien invasion, complete destruction, fighter jets, army convoys and of course nascar cup cars with guns on them. You would play that scenario every day as an 8 year old and now for the first time you could see this in a realistic setting on the big screen.
genuinely want to collect the novelizations of the first 3 movies one day, just for funsies. i thought the relationship between optimus, megatron and sentinel was pretty interesting for this movie... would love to see a show touch on a similar idea in a more developed way. as a kid this one was my least favorite because my two favorites, ironhide and starscream, got murked but i've come to appreciate the totally insane violent final third myself. for as bad and as fraught as these movies are, its amazing to know that it could, in fact, get worse. as much as i don't want this series to end i'm just so interested in what you'll say about the mess that is the last knight
20:12 _YEEEAAAH DRILLER BEAST_  Best aspect of the whole thing by far.
I gotta admit and im sorry but i kind of like the decepticon design. What i dont understand is everything they fight for. If they want earths energy why not just nuke everything? Or why does an insanely sophisticated robotic alien race need anything human? They dont need to sleep, to eat or recharge or something. Or if you dont want to bother with any of this, take the other planets. Make that a movie plot: "oh no, the decepticon have build a base on Mars", or " oh no they build underground super nukes to reveal earths core". I dont understand why they are so obviously technological advanced, and probably have exterminatus level weapons  beyond our imagination, yet limit themselves to human rules.
15:23 why the hell is there a bad business character 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
The whole "Violence with Machines" thing is the whole reason why Clone Wars or really any dark Star Wars project got away with it. Same with those superhero shows in the 90s, like X-Men and Spider-Man
I just woke up and the intro confused me a lot, 10/10.
Actually the megan fox part is quite funny  2nd movie is all about "i'm gonna love you no matter what happens" and in the first seconds of this movie we're being told that she left  AND THAT MAKES IT MORE REALISTIC! :D           I'm not crying, nor you are, WE are crying... let's accept it, she won't come back
Can't wait for bumblebee
It is my personal headcannon that when Optimus was learning English through the web, he stumbled across a video of all Mortal Kombat finishers and took some inspiration.  Seriously, look at the deaths of Bonecrusher, Demolishor, Grindor, The Fallen, Shockwave, Megatron, Lockdown, and the innumerable amount of generics he killed and tell me they wouldn’t fit right in in a MK game.
Honestly it still amazes me just how good the cgi was for transformers I love all 3 movies
Mais você esqueceu dos quadros da marvel
Really, it's just a normal day in Chicago. If anything, the murder rate probably would decline under decepticon rule (just like communism, crime goes down when they just kill everyone).
Greatest vod
damn didn't know you played roblox first person shooters dude
"The Transformers Movies Are Cool, Actually" and its adjacent variants are favourite video essay topics of mine. Lindsay Ellis' "The Whole Plate" series is great fun for instance, lol
I like how this movie actually feels like PG-13. The invasion in Chicago where Decepticons are shooting people and blowing them to bones is brutal. Along with the death's of Transformers
7:37 i feel like a mechanic would love transformers. imagine you can tell your car to transform into any car with any motor or accessories by just scanning them. would be a mechanics dream
What am I watching this and my brain automatically recognizes the Spyro music
I like to think shockwave's "personality" wasn't really taken from the cartoon version of him, but rather the comic version or shockblast from energon, wich actually was a violent assassin, except of course, turn his intelligence into animal noises... anyway, I'm enjoying this ride way to much, see ya' in TF4 pointless :)
Oh my god mike and jay look so young
Man Megan Fox is looking absolutely BUSTED now. Why do women think plastic surgery makes them look better? Christ that's disgusting
You only touched on it briefly but all these years later I have to agree that a lot of my enjoyment of these movies comes from the INCREDIBLE scores by Steve Jablonski.  I really want him to score a Monsterverse movie at some point.  Or just a kaiju movie in general if Godzilla And Kong doesn't work out.
Ironhide got done dirty
Having Optimus prime commit war crimes is the ultimate misunderstanding and disservice to his character.
i just had a really nice 30 minutes thanks to you.
Yeah, third one they really pushed the deceptions being animalistic while autobots looking human
YAY!
Fox being fired by Spielberg is giving me big Kanye vibes
Not to be *that guy* but in pokemon, intimidate lowers attack
To give Cody a mindblower and a pallet cleanser, he should review Transformers Prime.
What would have been really nice if they kept the original ending, would have been if Megatron offered a truce, Optimus said no, then Megatron was like "Damn, want to change sides then since you're being so brutal?" And Optimus just kinda stopped and thought "Oh shit, I started out trying to just stop a bunch of evil dudes and now I'm tearing people's faces off. I've lost myself in the war. Yeah, a truce is good." Before accepting the truce offer.  But that would require good writing.
I got an incredibly soft spot for this movie as well. Mostly due to being one of those movies with quite the cool potential if you adjusted a few key plot elements... And having watched it in theaters in 2011. The whole third act/Chicago sequence is absolutely my favorite/probably only really liked thing about these movies. Seeing the Autobots just vanish, as the situation turns insanely hopeless minute after minute, with the incredibly grimdark destruction of Chicago was just so insanely well done. Really made that whole Optimus bit (if you uhhh, leave the patronizing sentence before that) to really be far more cathartic then you really would expect from these films.  And also honestly later helped to build up against Megatron and Sentinel. Which is another actual common case that really confuses me, as before recently I'd never realized how controversial that was for Optimus. I absolutely think that he was justified in taking out Megatron there, and I'm also kind of confused why people just kind of ignore that he's the 50% of this whole nutcase. Sentinel's was brutal and pretty palpable as it was an actual war crime, but the former going off to build Cybertron after just killing thousands of people is so hilariously more dumb. Especially since axing Chicago was basically a warning shot against earth, so you'd have absolutely no grounds on which to trust the guy at this point. (Edit btw: Just realized that it also kind of betrays Optimus' earlier thing of "they'll never stop", because now I guess he just thought that Megatron would lmao.)
So you're telling me, comparing a Jewish man to Hitler will get you fired? Gee, I wonder who could've told you that.
You should review the Day After Tomorrow next
With how convoluted the later movies got making Bumblebee a reboot during filming was probably the smartest move they could have made.
The original Transfomers a film in my opinion is still awesome....The most true quote of all time,Also I have a soft spot for Transfomers 3 as well😂
I liked this movie because of its end it was one of my favorites Idk why but I love roadbuster, Que, and Dino. The other new characters are cool but I love those the most
The TF movies unwittingly read as a fascinating story of Optimus Prime’s journey into villainy. He’s his mostly optimistic self in TF1. But then he’s ripping apart faces in TF2, committing war crimes in TF3, and actively raiding human compounds in TF4. He even gets his first human kill in TF4. What a great “war is hell” message to see Optimus so worn down and embittered by war that he becomes everything he stood against.
this channel should have more subs!!!
WAR CRIMESSSS!!!
Optimus is the USA in the whole "proliferation of world peace" arc where we kill, well, everything 😮. Even in extinction, he's like help me dinobots 😩 while beating their leaders ass lmao.
I mean, Speilberg is Jewish so I can't imagine he's a big fan of people comparing directors to the holocaust.
Next you need to do this with Casino Royale (2006).
Do Michael Bay Ninja Turtles Next
Fun Fact: according to Michael Bay, he came up with that big building crushing worm thingy while doing stomach crunch exercises
Yep. 1000% Nailed it. That last hour... I was 15 and literally didnt care about the story at this point. This was more a tech demo/theme park ride than an actual movie, and it fucking rocked for 2011. To this day, the CG work (full credit to ILM/Digital Domain) is legitimately some of the best I've ever seen, looking LEAGUES better than anything Marvel produces today... That's about it. All the humans suck. The Autobots for the most part suck. The script sucks.... Saw it 3 times in IMAX 3D for that last hour. That is all.
2:58 get that man child out of this video
I do find it interesting that in Transformers, compared to what we got in the first two movies, you put just guns strapped to cars as a pro.
Besides everything, is that the halo 2 soundtrack at around 18:00 ?
Can you make a video on the war for cybertron games or transformers prime?
I also like Dark of the Moon, I gave it a 7/10, and is my second-favorite live action Transformers movie, after the 2007 one, and the third-favorite overall after it and the 1986 movie.
Out of genuine curiosity after watching these films so many years ago, how the hell did Megatron survive each goddamn movie? I remember him being killed off in 1 and 3, yet how in tarnation does he come back in the 2nd and 4th movie????
"it's been like, 12 minutes" I snap back to reality!
First man’s ost slaps more than most movies now a days
This movie is so stupid and dumb and i love it, it’s my guilt pleasure movie.
I can't wait when he gets to bumblebee next year, and then rise of the beasts in 2024.
that moment you hear the 102 Dalmatians soundtrack
NO OPTIMUS NO, THOSE ARE CIVILIANS, THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE! YOU CAN'T CRUSH THEM WITH A BUILDING! NO OPTIMUS! YOU CAN'T DROP WHITE PHOSPHORUS ON THEM NOOOO
Oooh I like the pokemon comparison at the beginning. Good way to show the history of Transformers to those unaware of it.
so glad that you used "dare to be stupid" at 8:45. i legit just discovered that weird al video last week and fell in love with it
Schploingus
Pog
This is still my favorite transformers movie. Besides bumblebee
Great video
You k ow it's funny the writer thinks that because Democrats openly discriminate against Republicans that the inverse is also true when it really isn't.
I mean to be fair, Megatron and Sentinel Prime did try literally committing genocide and mass enslavement
Sweeeeeet totally love it when I get new content from favorites creators
We were robbed an actual proper ending that would’ve showed character growth for both the hero and the villain. Oh well, the funny megaman’s head went off.
I've been watching your videos about transformers for awhile and kept trying to remember if I had ever seen this one. I couldn't remember anything about it except the buildings in Chicago falling over. It was really bothering me that I couldn't remember anything else. Not even all the people getting vaporized or the executions. This whole movie just left one memory: Buildings slamming into each other. I think I was high on ambien.
I like it too. Its okay
Pointless.
A thing I’m glad to see being renovated with the new movies like bumblebee, is that every transformer doesn’t have to be a really nice expensive sports car. Like bumblebee always looked best in his first beat up camero look in the first movie. And that car actually blends in. Same with the bug
Transformers 2 was incredible Optimus was poppin off
It's really funny to me that 4 million years of war on cybertron wasn't enough to turn Optimus into a war criminal but after 5 years on Earth he said 'Fuck it' and started executing prisoners and surrendering soldiers
12:40 First man is so so good. The story kinda sucks but everyting else is top tier space nerd shit
I feel the Spielberg probably hated the comparison to Hitler, since he is a Jewish director
I take it that you are joking about Patrick Swazye right? Cause that's Dempsey haha
Gonna be honest, I expected more war crimes from this.
I love the vibe, and I love your videos man!
Intimidate lowers Attack. Fake Tears lowers Special Defense.
11:01 not gonna lie I did, they ruined "wheeljack" and I could not sleep if this "wheeljack" was still alive
Transformers 1: The Hoover Dam is a conspiracy. Transformers 2: The pyramids are a conspiracy. Transformers 3: The moon is a conspiracy.
I can't believe you left out Sam KILLING Starscream by himself.
Iran? I think you mean Carbombia
Also, fun fact: Dutch’s actor (Alan Tudyk) is now playing Optimus Prime in the new cartoon
Never saw any of these after the 5 minutes I watched of the 2nd one
The cartoon also had a plan to use humans as slaves....and in another episode the autobots were banished in a shuttle and came back after megetron tried blowing up the shuttle.....its just a mash up of 2 separate epidodes
Could you image if there were a war movie where the only real way the humans could kill their enemies was by tearing them apart, limb by limb. That's essentially this movie, but they're robots so it's okay
kinda crazy how cgi borderline peaked here this movie looks so good
All this over saying the N word.
Imagine thinking aliens are beholden to our own laws of war, laws we don't even follow.
Optimus prime get Pokémon sword and shield
The story but you don't actually get to hear all too often about Transformers the autobots arobots are enslaving the decepticons and the decepticons are rebelled
Transformers Dark of the Moon was a brutal Dark and it like MCU has dark stuff and brutal not as like the punisher.
I know this movies are kinda trashy, but that shot of Optimus clearing out an army of Decepticons by himself is one of my favorite action sequences of the past decade
I can't believe you were sucha youth when these movies came out... i feel so old lol. Also make shirts! I'd wear them!
You say there's an exciting finale, but it's also one where Optimus Prime just gets caught up in some cables for a large part of it like a doofus.
not gonna lie same. i love dark of the moon and i dont know why. its obviously a bad movie but somehow very enjoyable
as soon as I saw Charlie Berenes I sent this vide with the timestamp to my Wisconsin friend
The Ryan Gosling Apollo movie was not as bad as I thought it was going to be and thank you for making me realize that it wasn't just something that I thought I saw but never actually existed.
Yet another great review from our nostalgic time. I was honestly sad when Ironhide died, and was somehow relieved when Optimus Brutally killed Sentinel.  This one was a train wreck, but a good train wreck in a bad way.   Confusing? Well then welcome to the Michael Bay Transformers Universe.
For some reason, Dark of the moon is the installment ppl seem to have more sympathy about in a bad series
I loved Megatron's vehicle design in this movie, looked cool
I saw a picture from the last knight the other day and I gagged
I think most of the transformers movies are pretty fun. That doesn’t mean they’re great.   I’d also say, if you even want to SORT of make a realistic Transformers movie it has to have them doing what would amount to atrocities. They’ve been waging a war for like millions of years against each other that all but destroyed their planet. To think they’d come to earth and consider feeble humans as anything but collateral damage is crazy.
Can’t wait to see you ridicule the age of extinction! I hated that one!
Fantastic video, i just started watching your stuff recently and I'm really glad I found your channel!!! >:3
This is the best transformers movie ever made and that’s a hill im willing to die on
PointlessHub: mentions pokemon Me: oh dear where is this going
Dark of the moon is alright. I think the movie really picks up in its 3rd act
The pointlesshub sequel we needed
Ah yes... the movie that made me scared of Transformers... despite me being a huge Transformers fan when I was a kid.
“What does this have to do with pokemon…. Oh”
Comment for the algorithm
I honestly forgot that transformers 3 was p-13 lol
pg13 used to be a whole different thing, go back and watch some 80s-90s pg13 movies and you'll be shocked at the amount of straight up nudity and violence. For some reason the rating standards changed and now shit like frozen is pg13
I cant believe you actually remember First Man one of my favorite movies
I have a theory about Hollywood I think they do have colts but they don't actually do anything they just placebo effect themselves to believing that they work in making them rich and famous
OK whatever you just showed us at the beginning with Pokémon you have to cover that shit dude at some point or another because now I’m interested
Am I crazy, or does it feel like an entire fight between Optimus and Shockwave was cut from the movie? Look at the Chernobyl scene. Shockwave emerges from the worm thing, and calls out optimus. Cut to Optimus taking a battle stance. Cut to a shot of the worm leaving the battle ground. It's such a weirdly edited scene, that I have a feeling there was supposed to be a short optimus vs Shockwave fight there, that they didn't finish, and basically stiched the start and the end of the fight together.
I find it really funny that after watching these transformer videos the algorithm has started giving me ads for kids toys. Which I guess is better than the usual ads which are telling me I need to download tik Tok or else I'm canceled and the CCP will arrest my grandma
PointlessHub re-uploading this video: “IM AN INVENTOR”
The transformers movies are peak comedy tbh. You can't take them seriously at all
There's a part in the end were its ether Bumble bee is kicking ass then just randomly get captured off screen OR Hes captured off screen and randomly gets free to kick ass. Forgot the exact was it happens
Oh god, I remember that edgy ass fake pokemon movie trailer thanks to this video, what have you done?
Is that... is that the Jitter-Bug theme song? The elder friendly phone? With big easy buttons?
If I could just point out, regarding the "only Optimus could revive him" leaves out "because Optimus has the macguffin we spent the entire last movie trying to get"
As bad as this movie is, it's not even the worst of the series lmao
“Do you feel cold and lost in desperation”  - Linkin Park
Dark moon is my favorite transformers movie in the trilogy. Great video
I frankly have mixed feelings about Dark of the Moon. I like aspects of it as far as the general plot and action is concerned (much better than Revenge of the Fallen I'll say). But sheesh do several of the Transformers designs in this one look absolutely horrid compared to even the previous two movies and Shockwave was completely wasted depite being heavily marketed as "THE villain" (on top of the studio just giving up on name consistency for at least two Autobots). Also the movie just stops at the end where Cybertron nonsensically gets destroyed and it ends right there with no wrap up of any kind.
Optimus talking to Buzz Aldrin is the coolest thing that happened in these movies
Dark of the moon is my favorite transformers movie and one of my favorite movies of all time
link to jeff bezos pokemon clip
Very cool
I was there when the Original Dropped   It didn't apeak Vietnamese thou
You need to do the fast and furious franchise after this. It's like a fever dream after the 4th
What a great way to end a Sunday
You would have made a way better nostalgic critic.
I always found it strange how Patrick Dempsey's character had other human collaborators working with him, yet they were never brought up in the next movies
this got taken down half way through me watching it the first time, and i almost cried. Why? partially out of sorrow, because i had a masterpiece snatched away from me. partially out of relief, because i didn't have to think about this movie anymore.
DOTM is the ultimate dumb action movie. The story is so mind meltingly stupid and nonsensical and just feels like it was made by an 11 year old with toys. However, the action is so much fun. The VFX team kills it like always
Trying to understand the Transformers movie cannon and its "logic" feels like trying to solve a puzzle with your elbows only to find out that none of the pieces were part of the same puzzle to begin with
Gay sec is overrated
I do think the idea of the moon landing also being a secret investigation of a crashed alien ship is pretty neat
"uhmmmmm actually, it's intimidate, not intimidation, and it decreases attack, not special defense. 🤓"
Me and my dad (who has been a lifelong Transformers fan since G1) saw this movie when it came out and still love it.
Agreed with the take, but expected dramatic intro like the last one...
Lol I think Buzz Aldrin was more likely thinking, "you're gonna give me HOW much money? Yeah sure, I'll be in the cooky robot movie."
Fun fact. This movie and Kung Fu Panda 2 were released on the same year, and they both had a scene where the characters had to escape a building being toppled over from the inside.
Toy lines about war crimes are nothing new I recently began watching Gundam 0079 and hoo boy
I was there when Dark of the Moon first premiered in theaters back in 2011
I was so sad when it left the first time lol
I had mixed feelings about Transformers 3.  I eagerly waited for the movie back then, watching all the trailers and leaks.  when came out I was disappointed but I don't hate but did not love it either.  the part I got really mad at is when Starscream got killed by Sam I was like WTF.  this movie is brutal even for transformers but I did not mind it after watching 1986 movie.
I always get so giddy when I hear Spyro music in your videos
I have nothing to back this up, but I believe that this film and its ultra-violence, totally-not-9/11 city destruction was what started to get people to not care about 9/11 (plus coming out almost 10 years after the fact probably helped), its not that the movie helped people get over it, rather it desensatized the real event
Who else noticed the optimus prime fumo?
Do a Collab with cosmonaut he's also watching transformers
never expected to hear cody say fuck in a video, very funny moment
I agree that the final third was the main reason that this film is good, in my opinion it defines the phrase 'epic blockbuster' and the score is incredible.
Watching this now as an adult it boggles my mind that in this movie the US government uses Autobots to atack an Iranian nuclear facility and nothing comes of it. I mean yes its a dumb action movie but holy shit
>"Revenge of the Fallen was not a good movie"  Untrue. I watched it in a manic break, and it was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Only OG's remember the original video
"Remember when this started as a ploy to sell plastic toys?" That implies it's not _still_ a ploy to sell toys.
Anyone else wonder if Megan Fox admitting to drinking blood is just... her being honest about the evil shit that happens behind closed doors in Hollywood? That's the most disturbing part of this.
When you viewed the first screenplay but then it gets taken down and come back to the theatrical release. Great vid enjoyed it full and through
I was able to visit the set of this movie for a day when they were filming in Chicago back in 2010, I would have been around 9 at the time.  I was able to met Josh Duhamel walking to lunch break. I noticed a huge gash on his face, and being so young I thought he was really hurt and I said   “Sir, you’re bleeding!” (Keep in mind I had absolutely no idea who this guy was since I wasn’t a transformers fan)   He said something along the lines of “don’t worry buddy it’s not mine”   He had a good laugh about it and even offered to take a photo with my sister and I.    I still haven’t seen the movie or any transformers movie to this day lmao.
I feel like that Pokémon analogy is a bit unfair for TF since even back to the 85 movie and the marvel comics Transformers has always been a very violent series.
i love this film its my favourite in the series aside from bumblebee
Who knew Optimus was from Yugoslavia.
optimus executing sentinal is unironically one of the most memorable moments in movie history for me
7:47 I love how he says and does this despite cutting off like, every movie with some half-hearted philosophical speech about the fragility and importance of life.
"When are you going to stop?" "When I've caught them all!"  Optimus Pikachu for the crossover?
Can’t wait for part 4 and all the hate crime jokes about Mark Wahlberg.
The way Optimus looks absolutely pissed off when he says "Time to find out" and his face mask snaps closed sends chills down my manchild spine.
The third Transformers movies is actually dope and I don’t care what anyone says
As young lad this was my favorite movie out of the three, now out of the 5 its my 2nd. It's a pretty fun movie even with the flaws and I really love the whole take over and battle of Chicago. Thought back to these moments when I read the All Hail Megatron comics.
People forget that liking something for it entertainment and it's quality are different. These are "guilty pleasures" Because we know they're objectively bad but we like them. I say that we should start reminding people that we can like good or bad movies but we need to be honest about it being good or bad. I love the star wars prequels to death. Are they bad? Yes. Specially ATC where dialog was horrible.
I distinctly remember seeing this in theaters on the day it premiered. I was 10 at the time.
I unironically love watching Dark Of The Moon.
My main memory of Dark of the Moon was a kid kicking my seat in the movie theater during the finale when something big happened, fun times.
This is the one I've been waiting for the longest, and I can't believe this Chad used Transformers Cybertron music in the background lol SO GOOD
I’m not saying this because Michael Bay has been my only introduction into the Transformers Universe, but we need executions in kids movies
Guilty pleasure is what you're looking for
Hey
Thought Halloween was over. I was not ready for that Jeff Bezos jump scare.
Killing a surrendering enemy wasn't the bad part gor Optimus in this. It was not dropping a sick oneline like in the 86 film. "You who are without mercy, now plead for it?"
I love how its universally agreed that Optimus is a war criminal in the bay movies
Answer for how the pillars got spread around the earth around the 17:39 mark. The deceptions had the pillars with them on the moon while they were hiding. When Sentinel opened the small portal with his 5 at the Lincoln memorial all the deceptions came through with the pillars (since they were already in possession of them).
Your transformers dark of the moon video made me subscribe so that I didn't miss out on this video. So happy it's finally here!
16:14 "Somehow, Palpatine's returned" vibes lmao
I watched the whole thing before the reupload I should get a reward
1:02. cannot believe that the quiet ass background music unlocked a core memory of the transformers cybertron OTS.
“Robots, you know what means? I can be as hardcore as I want and it will still be PG-13~! Mmm delicious ultra violence”
I still remember when this movie was being filmed here in Chicago. People here were crowding the streets downtown watching all the explosions being filmed and when the film premiered in theatres, every showing in the area cheered when the Decepticons turned our city into a carnival shooting gallery.
Megan Fox drinking blood is the strangest thing in this video
I’d argue that this one suffers from the same “issue” as Rogue One did. The first 2 thirds were kinda boring, but it made up for with with a killer third act.
hello
Reupload gang sound off
I've never seen an actual large content creator swallow a bit of their pride and admit something they like is complete dogshit prior to watching this. I respect the hell out of that in a sphere so rampant with people thinking bad media is good because they like it.
I liked it better when the franchise wasn't tarnished by Micheal bay
A video so good, you can't just upload it once.
20:13 Your mom kept saying this to me the other night.
This is the best one.
Re-upload huh? Fair enough. Given the movie inquestion it makes sense.  But Transformers 3 is still good, compared to the other movies. But only two Transformers movies were actually good, 1 and 3. There's nothing wrong with liking it. No one knows why we just do. And that's okay.
Apologies if you were watching before. There was a formatting issue I didn't notice and I had to re-upload. Everything was Letterboxed and looked terrible. This aspect ratio is how the video was meant to look.   I added Chapters so you can get back to where you were previously watching. Sorry about that.
Geneva convention? More like "Geneva suggestion"
The third transformers was my go to action movie as a kid
I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was 9, and being disturbed by the scene where the Decepticons invade Chicago and obliterate a bunch of innocent civilians to the bones
Alternate History, Roll out and Transform into Pointless
Credibility? I don't come here for your Credibility. I come here for silly youtube shenanigans.
For the second time this movie is a masterpiece in my eyes
I guess the previous upload pushed some limits, too… 😏
Ah yes, the transformers move that depicted Optimus ''freedom is the right of sentient beings'' Prime just straight up execute his father figure and (kinda) brother. Well done, Bay.
Dotm was an epic film and ending for the trilogy, despite its flaws.
i laught way to hard at the idea of the transformers bombing iran
I have always liked Dark of the Moon. It's a solid ending to the trilogy (which should've stayed as a trilogy).
Wait what happened to this video wasn’t it uploaded already
Commenting 4 algorithm
I love how the transformers prime tv series seems more mature than this gritty thing xD
Can you watch transformers rescue bots that was my first introduction to the transformers series, and I want you to review a kids show.
I was obsessed with the Michael Bay movies as a little kid, and I am not kidding when I say that I legitimately cried when the Autobots’ fakeout death happened.
why did the original video get put on private?
Reupload to fix resoultion?
Only real ones will remember when he uploaded this with a different aspect ratio
you say u love moon media. have you seen for all mankind. that stuff is getting crazier every season and is just about cooked enough to be your next vid
It's rewind time
Nope nothing happened. You didn't see anything. And the moon landings were also totally not to find an alien ship
F to the original video
Still Easily the best movie in the franchise. Plus it’s in Chicago which is my favorite American city and I love being able To point out all the buildings
Last time I was this early, this video was already posted
Wonder what he changed in the reupload
*PointlessHub:* NO YOUTUBE! **Copystriked**
I love transformers they are Ronald Reagan's legacy
Re-upload moment
What was wrong with the video?
Why the reupload?
Reupload? Cool, time for a second watch.
Yoo nice got here 14 seconds in

i love warcrimes, i love rimworld
It's Bak!
Excited
I’m excited to be here for only 10 seconds until he deletes it

Fred Dirst
Holy shit here we go, the man does it again
