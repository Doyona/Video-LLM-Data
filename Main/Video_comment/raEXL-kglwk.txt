City is the best in the wold   city city city
If you hate man united clap your hands 👏👏👏
Haaland hat trick
Onana’s saves were outstanding.
Onnaa was it
❤
He was also VAR for the absurd penalty Man City was given at old Trafford. There is no doubt in my mind that he's been bought.
How soft is that penalty
City BATTER United at Old Trafford!!! 🤩🤩🤩 | Manchester United 0-3 Manchester City | Premier League Highlights
uniteted suck😅
😢
If you see this comment before the match tomorrow what’s your prediction?
Manchester City
A Manchester united Methodist university of Washington DC tomorrow morning
Go way. Manchester city
They just love scoring against united
Onana played so good this game many top saves. Edersons save vs Mctominay was cold 🥶
3 - 0 but shoulda been about 1️⃣0️⃣. 💙🤍
I hate man cheaster city
what a keeper 🤯 his team has done 👍 very impressive performance from both sides and a good performance by the team this week too and a good start in a game of football and not a lot of pressure from the club and the players are still on their way in this game so far but i am sure he can do well with a good start and a decent start in a team that is very good 4in and will make it through this season and hopefully we will
Man city via Onana only thanks for watching!
Fair play to onana 7
CITY CITY CITY
One thing Haaland has is awareness. I've played against a lot of people who have zero. He has his head up and knows where people are. Which means he's usually in a good position himself. His assist, many strikers would have their head down there
Haaland is the best
haaland
Old Trafford falling down do do do do do do
Blues are the real manchester
The blue makers
Who think liverpool will have a chance against man city 👇
The managers fault for not subbing Udogie. We fully deserve the whooping we got.
I thought I heard someone eating what sounded very much like a family size bag of monster munch pickled onion over in the far corner of the Stretford end. And you guys pay how much to watch this? A bunch of overpaid big girls blouses. How much for Jadon sancho? How much do your "scouts" get paid? Chronic mental illness is what I would diagnose and I'd be right, but if everyone is clearly MENTALLY DERANGED..im wasting my time typing this. . That's not entertainment.
Haaland 😌💘
I blame Roy Keane for ending Haalands fathers career. Haaland has unfinished business with Man U and he sure is letting them remember that name, "Haaland".
Foden turns into Messi against united 😂😂 CTID
Haaland is a top class scorer he could have had a hatrick against Utd but wanted to share his goals with foden absolutely beautifully played 😊
Onana is so good
Ten hag says he will resign when beaten Ten - 0
Your telling Bruno is captain after he let the opponent cross the ball man’s just watching.😂
I think United's biggest problem is Marcus Rashford. They'd be better off without him. He thinks he should be picked every game. For me,he is not that good and his attitude probably causes a rift in the United camp. He'd never get a game under Pep.
2:49 "Rodri clarted it" 😭😭😭
lol Man Utd finished club
Goal 2 is shocking giving Haaland that much room. But In goal number 3 united defenders are asleep look how much further haaland is forward when the ball comes back off Onana
United still in the title race 😅
Next Season, Manchester would be like what 12 years blue now
LONG MAY IT CONTINUE, WON'T BE MISSED AT ALL, Please get relegated
Losing de gea big mistake good keeper onana but now world class like de gea courtous from Madrid and van stargen barcalona or ederson city
Theeeese defenders…please .3rd goal
That's never a pen
Haaland saying "That's for you dad!" 😂😂😂
another EZ win🤣
I’ll say it over and over again you can’t be competing at the top with both maguire and evans 😅
Well played onana
City absolutely destroyed United. The worst performance ever of a United team.
Utd buy Hoijlund to be their own Haaland 😂😂😂
I thought onana was in a one man team😂. Attached from every angle daaang.
Goegwi3hk4y3oyri4y4iu3o❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's good to see Bant-chester Yanited are back this season, with Eric Seven-Hag firmly behind the wheel 🤣🤣🤣
Manchester derby no longer big NLD derby the best in league now
How can you constantly ball watch as a professional player. What a disastrous game feom united. Should have been 10-0, and thats being kind. Smh
This utd team is the worst since Fergie left. There are players in this team that would struggle in the championship. I believe some of them can't believe their luck being paid so much money to be this crap. The defence is actually.  embarrassing,
here is a question for everyone to think about  when Rodri was so called pulled down in the penalty box, even though the ref did not officially award a penalty straight away play was allowed to carry on but after a few minutes VAR got involved & the straight away the ref STOPPED the game to give Manchester City they Penalty if VAR done that for Manchester City then why couldn't they have done the same for Liverpool when they played Tottenham (when Diaz scored and was ruled offside but later they realized that VAR got it wrong) the game where Liverpool where ROBBED, it's starting to look like one RULE for Manchester City  & another rule for every other team, Manchester City have over a 1,000 chargers against them & yet still nothing has happen to them so it looks like MONEY REALLY DOES TALK.
Lol varchester city
How on earth is that a penalty? Are we supposed to just let attackers through on goal then?
even though city won but gotta apprciate onana🤩
The state of this club. Johnny Evan’s at the defensive wheel is just embarrassing.
Haaland ⚽⚽💪
3-0 is seen as an achievement for man united 😂😂😂 bless em
If it wasn't for Onana Haaland would of scored like 5 goals.
Man Utd are a busted flush. They are heading towards the dark days of the early 1970's again.
Boys vs men 👌🏾
I told my mum and after Man City won, I said “Manchester City is blue” Haaland is epic during this match
Terrible performance
Boys Vs. Men
We utd are so far behind. But we must get behind the team . It's hard to see us at the moment. We have no structure at all. It's going to be a hard few years but we still love you reds . City have a great squad and one of the best manager's ever .
Just shows what fergy got away with sinse 1986
Onana man of the match, disgusting defending from united
As a Man Utd fan for almost 2 decades, it’s good to see them lose now.
Good win for Man City Man United never showed up in this game
Consistency is key for strikers. Hojland, Martial, Gernacho, Rashford should be scoring more goals. When do you hear Ronaldo or Messi have a bad season? As a red, that was bad
If that's a penalty then according to the rules, anytime there's a pull in the box at a corner or set piece it's a penalty..but of course, only give it against United
Grealish was playing some slick stuff. Wow! As well as the other top 4 teams are playing, I can see Man City winning the league again this season.
Defence is useless. Never protected the goalkeeper
What makes this situation regarding the loud mouth supporters saying that they want the glazers out, perhaps stop buying tickets and buying football shirts because you’re only feeding the problem.
Hag is looking for a new club! 😅
Some great saves by Onana, but equally feel could have caught them!
You will never do anything, with that big baby of a captain!!
Where was defence onana kept united at 3 could of been 8 need defenders with brains
grrrrr
Giving Haaland that amount of space in front of goal for his second is a novel approach from Man U to win a match...
United are a disgrace banter team for real
Okaka
Peter said what now? 😂😂😂 🇯🇲
every goal was terrible
How is the commentator saying “Rodri charted it” 😂😂😂
Onana made some fantastic saves. Defence needs to step up start man marking and clearing better, midfield need to start making space passing the ball and forwards needs to make better runs and get shots on target to score. Shite team man no desire, embarrassment to the club, SAF, the fans and the sport 🙄
Man City TOOP!!!
Fernades is ALWAYS whinging at the ref, trying to make out that it is the refs fault for them playing so badly, he moans, he`s lazy, he thinks he can score from anywhere, even after the final whistle he`s still moaning, if i were the ref i would yellow card him before the game to savetime later. And Anthony...??? What ababy, sat there sulkin on the bench and when he comes on he boots Docku...!! This performance and attitude and lack of any desire was the same as when they lost at home to Liverpool 0-5, they are truly awful  @paulstones1451
B😅the best
look at number 35 for man utd at 3:00. he is just strolling in his box while haaland runs to the ball to set up a goal. SHOCKING
RODRI CLARTED IT
this united team is a joke...hhhhahhhhhaaa hhhhaaaa jeeez
No one going to talk about how much of a bias Neville showed during the commentary
Høylund what did you do???????
Always got a chance against man utd , playing me nana in goal 😂
🌟H🌟A🌟A🌟L🌟A🌟N🌟D🌟
Typical Haaland can only score penalty’s and tap ins don’t rate the man at all one of the most over rated premier league players of all time yes he scores goals but only because he’s basically hugging the keeper the whole game as u can see he gets denied on 1v1 so can only score open goals when the balls passed across the keeper and celebrates like a boss about being a close range striker lmao😂 no accuracy clearly
United are a joke 🤣. Anthony's little hissy fit after being mugged off by Doku was hilarious 😆😂
having watched utd since 1965 this is worst side ever manager not a clue players headless chickens the seventies relegated  side had more bottle cr7 is right
The club is done. Overrated players and bad decisions from the owners.
If Man Utd can't defend, and they did quite badly, they will concede goals. Utd's defence was bloody awful.
Ten Hag is doing a fine job.
That was an easy second goal for Haaland
Halland the best of the best
That second goal, Maguire thought he was the goal keeper!
Beautiful just beautiful 😂
Imagine leaving him unmarked at the back post not once but twice.  🤦‍♂️
That was a soft pen
Time for man United to have a rethink and a new keeper
Peter drury Rodri clarted it made me lol blud✊🏿
Johnny maguire and harry evans looked clueless for that 2nd goal, u simply cannot leave haaland unmarked
Cany believe nobody was on Haaland how ten Haag never drilled that into them at half time Is beyond me 😬😱💀
United are just Manchester City's rubbing rags now and have been for the last 11 years
{ 💙  MCFC  💙  } Manchester City Fc  The City of Manchester MANCHESTER IS BLUE 💙
I look forward till man city play tottenham
TACTICS😃
Silva and grealish, outstanding performances
Haaland's just class
Hmm can’t blame the keeper on this one it’s just absolute shite defence
The leaking roof and the Glazers showed really poor defending.
Oana pulled off some good saves. If Utd had got some goals could of been a good game!
Mctominay & Onana needs to leave ASAP... They are too good for Man U
For the 3rd goal, did the commentator say, "Rhodri's clarted it?"😂
The blue devils attack the Red Devils away
Very unselfish of Haaland to pass that to Foden, good head on his shoulders and right choice
"Rodri CLARTED it!" couldn't have said it better myself 😂
EVANS so bad
🤍💙🩵
Onana is bad even in games he plays well. that is wild.   Also, Drury yelling "Clarted it" was not on my bingo card
Haaland completely unmarked for his second. It's sub-Sunday league. The problems at United appear to go a lot deeper than the manager.
I wonder if McTominay is wishing they had sold him at the beginning of the season...
"Rodri clarted it"
Onana made a decent save shame about the last goal but in all honesty even as a united fan I expected it to be worse we are a shocking team
As a villa fan, I still admire the way Grealish is playing. Top performance again from Man City.
That’s more like it Onana, not even a United fan but would like him to do well
Honestly the first pen should’ve been given but only because Maguire had both his arms around stones’s head 😂
Joined by Geography, separated by History.. History is catching up fast..  Ozymandias  BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal, these words appear: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
Gary Neville: "The Glazers left Haaland unmarked at the backpost for the second goal".
Men vs boys
115 charges pending for financial cheating and corruption 😮
Imagine just choosing Evans over Varane that defo costed Manchester United the match like ETH has woken up froma Coma bc he knew we had injuries especially with our back 4 being mainly harmed and how he chose Evans over Varane like ITS A MANCHESTER DERBY ITS NOT BURNLEY OR SHEFFIELD is it MANCHESTER CITY ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD  its like ETH wants to lose his job 😂😂😂😂💀😞😑
Man united on for relegation yet? Its the only team in the premier league that deserve to go down a peg
Man United are a disgrace from top to bottom. Smaller club than city now and in a neutral who sides more with United. When is the last time United where favourites to win one of these games? 2012?
100% penalty! United are bang average.
they don't give those tyoe of penalties unless it's Man city, most times they don't even check
Most strikers would have had a shot, instead of setting up Phil Foden. Class act.
Shocking performance
Man Uniteds best player was the goal keeper by the looks of it.
Am I the only one hearing Peter drusy said “clarted” 💀💀💀💀
Sunday morning mistake for the second goal, teams need to man mark him but you just have to admire this man halland
United are a club being eaten from the inside out . Sad to see a once great club in turmoil
Feel bad for Onana, defence massivley let the side down!
It was Onana vs Man City because Haaland was free every time.
Onana is improving each week. Only so much you can do when your players keep giving away penalties and not marking their men
United are BAD 😂
Could've been atleast 6-0 well played onana
Manutd is not good again.
Did the commentator say “Rodri claaarted it” 🤣🤣 2:44
2:50 - "Rodri clarted it" 🤣🤣
Onana is useless. He makes one or two spectacular saves when looked at better, only look good because of his bad positioning. The guy is always bouncing around, positioning is awful. He is crap, end of story.
Leave past glory aside, City win alway scatter Man Utd till thy kingdom come with a lot of below average player Man Utd got, we are far from winning trophies.
Those executive boxes are looking good value for money LOL
my god that first 16 seconds! so much you could analyse right there, United are horrificly bad
Never knew Peter drury was Jamaican
Cocoa powder smuggler chihuahua 😅😅
Onana was on fire and this is coming from a arsenal fan
L chihuahua got a new 🆕 jacket 🧥😂😂
United are a 6th place team fACT
Haaland strikes again 11 in 10 for the norwegian striking viking 🇳🇴🤖
Onana really saved united from losing 7/8-0
How was that a penalty 😂 absolute jokes.
Kudos to maguire and onana for preventing a haaland double hattrick
When you look at the space Haaland was given , it must be easier for them to play against United than bottom clubs like Everton.
Defence is a complete joke....................
I can't wait for ANGRY GINGES video on this saying how untd was the better team for 90 😂😂😂
Man united are a bore fest no style of play red raw useless
At this rate, United will do a Liverpool and not win the league for 3 decades !
CITY SUCK
City shouldnt of won they only havd those players due to ffp
Honestly Onana was great, City are just an unstoppable force of nature. We easily could've had 6 or 7. Well played Andre.
Where was McR9 on this one…
Wow bring back Jose m - I’d take his management and style over this crap, ETH ain’t gotta clue
What a useless video
On the basis of that penalty every corner should result in a penalty.
"RODRI CLARTED IT" 🤣😭
Not a United fan but the penalty happens in every game and isn't given
Could have been 6-0 but it  is what it is
I'll take 3-0 I'm a Man City fan
As a Newcastle fan great to see Man Utd get beat well done City best team in league
Haaland letting Foden get his moment and pointing him to knee slide is class
They rave as if city done something special might aswell of been Sheffield utd was never going to end any other way
GLAZERS OUT FULL SALE ONLY
The poorest Man u team at all time what a shame 🤐
Tbh iknew that we’d lose its city 😂
United don't need to be spending millions on players who only want to increase their bank balances,,give the youngsters a chance to prove themselves for God's sake,,surely they can't be as bad as the so called superstars of united.Defending was non existent,,carry on playing like that and they will be the whipping boys of the premier league.
onana played so good in that game it was more just the man u defending
Onana was outstanding.
The reason United is losing is how they can't make a decision on who should play and how. There is a Mafia going on United.
Hilarious how teams try and play counter attack against City whilst not actually being set up for counter attack. Where have all the good coaches gone?
100 passes for the 2nd goal? Anyone count?
Onana should be motm easy
Tierney the Man City fan 🤔
Man city are so.far ahead of.united now, millwall got just as much chance of winning the prem as them
CHAMPIONS AGAIN OLE OLEEEE. Red 💩 in our shadow again.
Never felt more like singing the blues.. City win and United lose!! Ohhh Cittyyy!! You got me singing the blues!!
Onana 🔥
The gap in quality between these two is massive..
Untited pumped raw by vigo from ghost busters
Manu in demise and we love it
Onana was Utd Best Player
Cant Onana catch the ball, does he need to keep pushing it away back into play.
Onana really saves the day could have been 6 or 7 goals this keeper will surely help Utd stay in the premier league
The new  Mickey Mouse team
Haaland given his hat trick away was classy he is a different breed
City's attacking play is just beautiful to watch. The awareness of where they all know where to be and where there teammates are and the passing and movement is just sheer class. Not a city fan BTW
Another void result ,115
for all rival fans out there that kept saying the last couple of days that maguire and mctominey are not he problem, just watch the second goal. as the ball goes to grealish maguire sees haland and points towards him telling mctominey to mark him. 3 seconds after not only did they let haaland unmarked, both of them are litterally marking absolutley nothing. fair play to lindelof and evans, at least they marked their man... maguire and mctominey on the other hand, we wont progress until this 2 go
Utd have the worst defence in the Prem.  Utd weren’t even competitive.  It looked at City were playing against FIFA Ai on Amateur
this is what i dont understand. Haaland is an amazing striker. The reason he ‘ghosts’ in big games is because elite teams know the threat he is and likely train especially to play against and focus mark him specifically.   Its why he can just go to town against weaker side’s because they likely haven’t invested that same time into playing against him because for a team like bournemouth thats just not a good use of time. Its only lower table teams and us that give him this much space
L love football
Onana kept the score line respectable....utd best player on the day ...
Haaland, a blonde version of Imbrahimovic 🔥🔥⚽⚽⚽⚽🥅
😂😂😂😂😂
I honestly think man u are done now.
Halland is definitely the best finisher than Messi and Ronaldo we are here to see , I have to admit even though I am Gunner
I'm a united fan and city yet again thumped us they are a amazing team but it's near enough every season this is happening no fight or grit from us beyond on a joke yeah you can blame the board but it's down to the manager what happens on the pitch if the players ain't dancing to his tune something is wrong no pattern of play no tactics no nothing get Eth out
Always think of Rihanna when I hear Onana 🤣🤣🤣
Manchester United shouldn't be getting smacked like that, especially in a City rivalry. Our players should be over succeeding at their job, but they're not.
I love hearing Gary Neville praising City through gritted teeth 😂😂
No-one marking Haaland for that 2nd goal 🙃Blues run Red
Mike Dean on the penalty "when you see it back, he didnt have to do it, there was someone at the backpost to clear the ball" that just shows how referees/ex referees dont understand the game... when a player is defending a set piece they dont have 360 CCTV seeing if someone is at the backpost... they are all about defending the player they are man marking
MANCHESTER IS BLUE🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
It's a good job Onana was in goal for Man U otherwise it could easily have been 5 or 6 nil...He was by far their best player on the pitch...Another City masterclass ..
Banter fc is back 🎉
Halland " my little foden we have have vanquished the red devils again...oooodin"
That was an exhibition.
Onana showing is true worth because this could of got real messy
Just when I take Haaland off my FPL
The 2nd save from Haalands header is outstanding, from the 1st header  by Rodri? he’s tried to make it look all Hollywood , no great power in the header, straight at him should have just caught it but put his team in trouble by making it look harder than what it was…imo
At least people can’t call us glory hunters anymore. We’ve been awful for 10 years…the glory hunters have jumped ship to City lol
Bullshit united
lol @ haalands face
Haaland is the best player for Manchester City to win 3-0 against Manchester United 👏
Something HAS to change at UTD - we are a mid table club at best.
haaland overrated tho he only scores tap ins lol rashford walks all over him in a 1v1
still say it, the defence is terrible for united talk about day dreaming most of the defenders🤦
What a save by onana thought 👏🏾 had to replay that 3 times 😮‍💨
The United defence is a joke
Whats happened to my United
it's just like watching Barcelona 2009/2010❤
Ten Hag masterclass. Fridge head starting games. Madness.
Onana finally showing his class
United just seem they’re already defeated before kick off, shambles of a performance.   No rivalry whatsoever. School boy stuff
Haaland giving foden his goal and then telling him to celebrate was great
Rihanna had a good game
johnny evans in 2023 😂
Fair play Onana he was quality
Onana: why did i leave inter for man u?!
The foul for the penalty happens in every game on every set piece but you don’t see anything given. Zero consistency
As much as it pains to be defeated like this by city, they are just a total different level from us. We are shambolic. Team is awful. Dont see it changing any time soon
Man City are getting better quicker than I expected. Foden local lad living the dream.
Penalty was soft but no surprise united are absolute miles off it......
Mourinho out lol 😂😂😂😂
Can Onana not catch a ball? 😂
ETH (Press) : it's Sancho's fault 😂😂😂
How that’s a pen and sterling got nothing is a joke
When City are at their best they are terrifying.
THAT ASSIST FROM SILVA BRILLIANT
2:49 😆
Why does 1:01 look like a video game?
Thanks to the goal keeper it coud have been  very ugly  for united
💙M💙A💙N💙 C💙I💙T💙Y💙
How the once mighty are now utterly useless  Man utd shithole
If united don't know where they need players after that display....
Never thought i would hear dury say clarted 😭
Im a utd fan. Felt like a training game for city
Shockingly braindead defense from United. Just watching Halland from distance! Why? Did they go in after & Massage his legs for him as well? May as well.
Game changed when we took amrabat off
Onana may have had some shockers recently, wnd i know Man U may have lost 3-0, but his performance was brilliant today, and saved his team from a real drubbing.
Haaland looking left and right before the cross for the second goal. Even he couldn't believe the amount of space he'd been given.
Man u defenders don't deserve this keeper,  they leave him to do everything
Onana played alone
Useless
May not have been a penalty
The commentator actually said Rodri 'Clarted it' 😂. His wife must be Jamaican
I'm so happy for City these days. For years their fans have had to suffer the taunts of the smug glory hunters from OT.👍👍👍👍👍
10yrs on and the defence is still a shambles
Onana I wasn’t sure about start of the season but he’s really come out of his shell now serious keeper 💯🙏🏻 shame Harry Maguire is the only other player that turns up for United at the moment very poor performance again sad to see followed United since I was a boy seen them at there best and worst this is very poor at the moment managers got a few questions to answer
Anyone hear the minecraft damage sound at 1:05 😂
Onana don't deserve this sh*t club.
But look at the man utd team tho.   Lindelof at lb, Evans and Maguire zero pace and mobility.  Midfield of amarbat(just fouls and basically adds nothing) mctominay and eriksen both did nothing at all, Fernandes and rashford lazy and didn't track back all game! making it easy for man city's midfielders to attack and double up against dalot and linderhof.     Hojlund basically isolated.              This is a lower midtable team
My god our defence is a joke - fair play to Onana, he put up with a lot today & saved us from an absolute spanking but overall we were so far off of the pace it hurts....
It makes no odds. Southgate will watch this and say "Mmmmm that Maguire guy looks good, I will start him" Utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Thinking that all of a sudden Maguire is world class is suicide.
MANCHESTER CITY 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
United are back 😂
Rodri bumble-clarted it 😂
The manager needs to go! The team was defenceless and weak in attack
Haaland the definition of tap in merchant
Brilliant, -5 goal difference after 10 games
I hope Keano enjoyed the match
Imagine the clashes between ferguson's united teams vs pep's city, games we'll never get to see.
johny evans masterclass❤❤
Uniteds 5 wins this season, 1-0 home to wolves, played off the park, should not even have got a result, 3-2  home to forest after being 2 down, 1-0 home to winless Burnley, 2-1 home to Brentford with 2 injury time goals and 2-1 away to poor Sheffield United . They could have lost all 5 of these. Not exactly the cream of the crop, no disrespect but the budget of all 5 probably makes up 20% of uniteds, just remember wolves offloaded 34 players. Losing 3-0 at home to city is no surprise maybe they need to offload 30 players.
Onana good shot stopper but pushes way to many back I to danger zones going to cost them long term
Not one of these Utd players would get on the City side-3-0-Utd got off lightly!
Did they miss the chances for Man Utd? lol
Manchester has been blue since Fergy left
This is what a decade of financial doping does- sham league at this stage
Complete lack of defence
If not for the top quality shot stopping from Onana Man U’s sleepy defending could have cost them more, and Haaland looked hungry today!
I remember a time when Man Utd wasn't the laughing stock of the league. Now they can't even compete with the big clubs and struggle to beat the weaker teams.
Rodri clarted it??
Beating City is not for everyone
Defending was atrocious
Haalnds 2nd goal is a clear sign of Utd's shocking defense. He runs right past 4 Utd players, each Utd player telling the next one to mark Haaland yet no one does, completely leaving him free and open at the back post. how can you leave the most deadly forward in the league completed unmarked when his team is pressing...... and these defenders are worth millions?
3-0 loss and onana is still there best player
Men against boys. Utd were an embarrassment today. No fight nothing. Liverpool the only team to push City this season in my opinion. The rest there to make up the numbers.
2:56 :D
@jecatheclown did a very funny video for city fans.
These overpaid man utd players really couldnt care less 😂😂😂😂
Man Utd spend as much money (or more) as the other 6 teams in this fascist league. Yet they can't get anywhere near winning it. Something is very wrong here.
Mayb just me but neville being very stingy on the plaudits for onana. Edison 'great save' from 20 yards. Onana..'strange save' from point blank. Onana - great game in a poor team game.
I always root for the underdogs. Wherever I lived I couldn’t support the big club.  If I lived in Stoke-on-Trent, I’d support Portvale!  If I lived in Madrid I would support Athletico  If I lived in Nottingham it would be Notts County   If on Merseyside It would be Everton  In London I’d support Orient or QPR.  In Manchester??? Presuming we are classing the Borough of Trafford to actually be in Manchester….I’d be right behind the lesser club and be all over United!  Although maybe I lack ambition
Onana made 2 amazing saves to deny haaland 4 goals tbh
Never a penalty.. slight touch and his legs collapse😂😂😂😂 Utd though never mark harland..🤔🤔🤔 then Utd goalie😂😂😂 keeps pushing ball out for some reason ..
Mctominays shooting is so so accurate play him as a striker please
Ten had needs to go first
It’s always foden and haaland against utd
Just like last time Haaland and Foden crush Man U
Men vs kids, utd are no more 😂😂😂😂
The only good thing about utd today was Onana.
man u slapped again at home . all the onana saves were standard . bought a donky
Varcity
I predict soon we will stop considering this a derby
I dont know what all those so called coaches at United do with them in practice but it isn't passing or shooting, and with players like Evans who they got rid of years ago, Martial, Van de crap, Mctom crap, to name but a few because they give them such silly contracts they wont leave, then they buy players like Antony and Mount for silly money, play the kids at least they will try and run.
Literally both of those second goals have comd from leaving Haaland free, no amount of coaching in the world can make me undestand why anyone would believe that's acceptable, atrocious
How is that happening man united where the most dangerous player is standing in your 16 alone ?( second goal)
nobody watching haaland walk around to the back post for the second goal is absolute criminal defensive fundamentals
Onana was on fire
did Utd play this afternoon?
Man Utd are diabolical and its just, brilliant to see 😂
United so lucky this was only 3-0. Absolutely awful performance. Onana kept the scoreline down
man United line up looking weak
So Lucky and So Sad that City have Wrecked the Premier League.
Relegation could be United's saviour. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. The Glazers will sell if we get relegated.
I mean, even a striker half as sharp/alive as Haaland would have ran riot today. That defence is a shambles, nobody even gets close to him for his in play goal or assist.
😏
I can just imagine Haaland in 2-3 years time. He’s going to be even more unstoppable.
Utd have spend the same as City in last 10 years and are miles behind.  Their managers have had huge funds to spend, yet the fans still blame the owners for everything.  ETH is out of his depth.  5 players today are his signings and they are not good enough.
2:09 I was actually shocked at how Haaland was completely unmarked in the box, like literally no one was near him.
I laughed out loud when I saw how much space Haaland had for that second goal. Words fail me.
So many empty seats. City have no fans
Not a United fan, but I feel bad for Onana that his best performance still results in conceding 3 goals, that’s just how good City are though, could have been double the result had he been off it today
I didn’t have grey hairs when United used to be good..
Two planets.
Must break the ref’s heart to give Man City a penalty against his beloved Man U! Paul grew up just outside’L old Trafford
feel sorry for whoever bought the tickets
Onana will be the next de gea,he is improving massively!
Man Utd fielding the worst centre back partnership in the entire Premier League.
No complaints. We got whopped.
Why is haaland on his own in the box lol
Is this Manchester derby 😂
EDIT: I NO LONGER THINK THIS IS A PEN. No other instance this season has been awarded as a pen, even those more blatant than this one. Clearly refs do not see shirt pulling at free kicks and corners to be a penalise-able offence. One rule for city; another rule for the rest of us.  ORIGINAL COMMENT: Hojlund is unhappy but it’s definitely a pen. It isn’t always given but they should. There should have been another pen for city in the second half with linedlof hugging Haaland in the box that wasn’t given.
If United are playing badly on purpose to make Gary Neville cry on TV… they must be getting close.
I'm all for United, but this is supremacy
welldone Onana 🙌🥊✔️
How were it a pen
Says something about the state of your team when the goalkeeper is your best player...
Manchester United escaping with a 3-0 loss is actually a win for the fans, players and coaches it could’ve been much worse. Definitely something for Manchester United to build on solid result.
Second goal is all McTominay's fault. Everyone was covering someone or a pathway. McTominay lets Haaland stride off and goes roaming around nowhere. Maguire is signalling everyone to stay on their man so that he can go for the intercept. McTominay tries to cover Harry's space and fails at that as well.
Another great game for Man City - I was genuinely surprised at how Onana and Maguire seemed to be Utd’s best players.
Understandable enough but one of the many reasons United always lose this fixture these days is the psychological aspect. The whole team are terrified of City bc of past trauma
“Clarted”
Onana had probably one of the best games a keeper has had in years of the prem. Its a shame his defense let him down, but also a blessing enabling the world to see his skill. I predict a nice signing for him
These highlights don’t show you Anthony and Bruno trying to kick and headbutt Man City players. Funny how sky deletes my comment when I said this before… disgusting play.
Maguire is definitely starting the next England match then
Another great day for us at the Theatre of Disappointment  It wasn't even a contest.
Much better team won😂
People think onana is flop but the real flop is the defense
Roy Keane in on a 5 year deal give him staff he wants and give him time let him build that's the only answer to Man Utd.
Im Ipswich but my brother is Man U😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No one gon talk about how United is always a victim to VAR? Not saying it affects the outcome here but it's so messed up
onana carrying man utd on his back
the United keeper kept it a more respectable score than it should have been , 5 to 0 was easily on the cards.
Guess who's winning the Prem this year😂??!
Balon D'Or worthy performance from the Viking! 💙
Never a pen, this happens every single game, typical City getting decisions
Just had a little look at uniteds fixtures, and December looks like it could spell the end for Ten Hag.
am i the only one who thinks them death threats maguire got might be better placed to gary nevil  nevil is one letter away init
Utd will lose at least another 10 times this season its lookin bleak at best...
Not a shock is it, more of a shock they only scored 3
Not all bald headed managers are the same 😂
rashford is world class 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Liverpool fan I could see Onana being dangerous with a great defence…lucky for us it’s not
Brilliant brace and assist from the Leeds lad!
i wouldnt mark haaland , hes just lucky lol
Mudryk has more pl goals THEN UTDS ATTACK😂😂😂
Pep: Lads it's United
Cant wait for this team to eventually get relegated!! How they beat poor Newcastle last year in that cup final I have no idea. If any club deserves a trophy its Newcastle. And they turned up and spawned another trophy. Not long now. You guys are finished
Oh na na what’s my name
Peter Drury “Rodri clarted it” 😂😂😂😂😂 02.53
Man Utd,... funny little club!
Halaand standing in space several times. Beats me 🙈
0:22 what was onana trying with the save
Glazers Utd.  Training day for City.
Haaland: your turn to slide
Utd got spanked… but no surprise playing like a Sunday league
Onana was man of the match. Idgf 😂
Onana is starting to cook
“Rodri clarted it!” 😂😂😂😂
Maguire back to his imperious best. Why on earth is he not marking Harland.
Did united  have any highlights?
When will M United pick up again 😕
How are they gunna leave Haaland unmarked at the back post like that 😂
Onana is man of the match
Bro 1st one was never in any world any universe a penalty
Not a single world class player at United right now…the manager needs to go because it can’t be on the players week in week out it’s becoming a show up
I don’t care if we lost onana was class love it
The fact is non these united 11 would be starters in the opposite team, why would u expect a win from a very average bunch of shitty players to win u against a great team!!
Onana saved Man United from utter embarassement.
No way United are finishing in the top 4
I'm still waiting for the "united" highlights
I don't care about either of these teams, so no axe to grind, but you can't give a penalty for that, if you do then there should have been a penalty at literally every corner taken in the entire football league, ever, since it started. But then again, who was it running VAR today? Michael ''look at me'' Oliver, the same exhibitionist who deliberately made himself the centre of attention by not doing his job at Emirates a couple of weeks back. Surely there must be better officials available?
United heading backwards like Ajax. Anyone spot the link? The blueprint and who ??
Would’ve been 6-2 without onana
If this happened a week earlier we'd be sat here calling onana all the names under the sun.  When those players hear our fans roar it lights their belly unfortunately for all the outfield players nobody is roaring for them
Hate halland  man u always the best ilove halland but not when score v real Madrid or man u
Wow
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
City rule united are crap on their shoes
Onana only let 3 in today. Not bad for him 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah, I have to agree. this could easily have been 7-0. City absolutely owned the entire match, save a few lucky breaks from UTD.
3-0 or not  This what Utd fans and rlly everyone else thought they would get when signing Onana
The difference between these sides is frightening Might be another 26 year wait for a United title win.
Quick question Mason Mount came on second half has Walker or Stones taken him home in their pockets never seen on the pitch 😅😅
Diabolical defence by United.
I thought he said “Rodri clarted it” 😂😂
"Rodri clarted it" 2:50 😂
When you don't bother marking Haaland and rely on your keeper to keep stopping him.
Bruno needs dropped to the U12’s
Did the commentator really say, "rodri clarted it" 😂
Hope the toon pump them in the next game also
Get in City
My God united are truly garbage..
That’s the difference between a club that puts winning above personal profit. United have a sickness rotting it away and until it’s gone nothing will change.
Only one finger can not wash a face onana Saved 3 clearly goals and killed more other chance
MAN CITY CONGRATULATIONS WELL DONE,  SO PROUD OF CITIZENS 💙☝️
United don't have a defence at the moment. We need to get Varane, Martinez, Shaw, wan bissaka back. On top of that we need 3/4 quality players - right winger, striker, right back, maybe another centre back as cover. We totally relied on rashford getting the goals for us last season, now he's not scoring, we're struggling. We can't rely on young Hojlund, a striker who scored 9 goals for his team last season in the serie A. I think he will come good, but he needs time. I think kobbie mainoo will eventually come into the squad, he got injured in pre season, he looks to be a quality midfielder. Garnacho is getting better, another young one who's on the up. We'll see what happens with pellistri, hopefully he develops. We need to stick to Ten Haag. And force the Glazers out!!
F💎O💎D💎E💎N💎
H🌟A🌟AL🌟A🌟N🌟D🌟
JACK GRELISH 🔥🔥🔥
Shocking, half the city players are COMPLETELY unmarked.  Nothing followed up, no preemptive movement off the ball. What is going on??!   Why are we even buying strikers when we’ve no defence!?  Embarrassing
Utd are really bad....😂😂
They had their hand on our (Man UTD) players in and around the box a few times and VAR didnt even look at it. The way VAR is 'working' encourages diving.
Haaland completely unmarked for 2nd goal,they just left him to run across the area.
Fair play to Arsenal, Liverpool and City for battering relegation teams this weekend
It's just coin-skill-dence we lost today
Such an exciting league.......
How is Messi winning the Balon D'or over Haaland?  Almost as big of a robbery as Messi over Lewandowski in 2021
Onana was class 🎉 it's a shame the rest of the team is an embarrassment 🙄🙄
Honeslty cannot believe uniteds defence is dalot maguire evans and lindelof that’s one of the worse defence I’ve ever seen. Especially having lindelof as a fullback
Would been 6-0 without onana. Defending was shocking for the 2nd and 3rd goal. And that was never In 10 billion years a penalty. Sloppy United again.
Looking forward to seeing Goldbridge’s reaction to this 😂 Also I get so bored of Gary’s commentary..
I love watching haaland score gives me goosebumps ❤
Respect to Onana and Ederson 👏
Great tracking by Maguire for the second goal
Onana MOTM for me
Halaand completely unmarked lol
The day I take Haaland off as Captain for fantasy 😅
Rodri clarted.it😂 what a piece of commentary
Man utd are dire. No idea where they are heading, but it isn't up.
As a Man Utd fan, can we all agree that Man U is not a top tier football club again. Those days are gone. The sad reality is we rely too much on hope and history rather than statistical facts.
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤w❤❤❤
Man utd were awful
Props for Onana for keeping it the score it was. Maguire was great too surprisingly
Hahahaa
Evans was poor
I love how Harland gestured to Foden: "Here you go - it's your turn"😂
Let me watch this quick and be done with it
ronaldo woulda helped unitied
Did Drury really say "Rodri CLARTED IT"
Its the glazers fault 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cant believe the glazers weren't marking Haaland for the 2nd goal.  Blame the glazers
Like their stadium, a crumbling performance and we bossed them from the start to finish. MCFC OK
How on earth can you leave Haaland free in acres of space at the far post for his second goal...Oh dear...
I feel Gary’s pain doing this commentary 😢
we are city super city
Get a load of that Man U you absolute dossers 😂😂😂😂😂
I didn't think that I would say this. But Onana was by far the best United player on the pitch. He actually surprised me big time.  I don't know what's going on with my United, it was simply horrible to watch.
City play such boring football.
Was not sure about the Antony beating his wife thing but after watching the way he was hitting Doku I wouldn’t be surprised 😂
Pep getting all excited All they did was beat Man utd
Such an embarrising shitshow
Ain’t no way dPeter Drury said ‘Rodri clarted it’😭😭😭
Rashford is so overrated it actually physically hurts.
Man U's defense just sleeps.
Ronaldo was the problem 😂
United falling apart again!
The knee slide is getting boring now, every player doing it
Absolutely embarrassing behaviour by the man united players at the end. Bruno and antony kicking out at doku and starting fights. That is disgraceful from the CAPTAIN of man united and players in general. Deserved loss today.
cant believe maguire didnt score
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Man U 💩Ted
It is unbelieveble how much is strong the city .. like nobody in europe
Did he say “Rodri clarted it” 😂😂😂 didn’t expect that
United could have won this if the glaziers were not in charge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just 2 easy 👎🏻
I'm in Shropshire and I was closer to Haaland for his second goal than the United defence.
It was more like Onana vs Man City
Arsenal had same incident against united , ref and VAR never thought about penalty !
Never a pen. If you give that, you give hojlunds at the other end.
Onana is to good
Did anybody expect any other result? I saw the score after work and was not remotely surprised. Boring.
Actually being serious here, but its not shocking in the slightest this type of scoreline and its pretty much expected. Last season a VAR controversary changed the game, they needed that again if they had any chance.
Easy so easy.
Terrible marking for the second goal
Training match for cites
1000 th coment
United got only one highlight 😂
Im no expert, but why on earth would you give haarland that much space for that second goal? Basics surely??
Are you  air because I can’t live without you
The gulf in quality between Manchester City and Manchester United is massive. It will take a lot to close that gap.
3 goal contributions? Haaland clearly doesn’t see this as a big game.
The theatre of screams .
To think Haaland spent a full day at Man U only to be turned down 🤦🤦😂😂😂😂
History channel fc loses again
Onana had a cracking game to be fair none of the goals were his fault
Its not really a big Derby win is it? Its similar to when City were bottom 6 for years. They couldn't really compete so it was just 3 pts more often than not for UTD. At the moment the Man Utd team and management don't care and City are going to walk the league again.
Miserable performance from United!
The funniest thing here is that Man Utd fans on twitter will be angrier with Arsenal fans, rather than City fans over this result 😂
The tracking back from United players is a joke. Letting runners run.
Training ground session for city.
Onana+Maguire=🐐duo
The best header of a ball in the world. Let's just leave him unmarked five yards out with a cross coming in. Good God!
Hojlund is now officially PL 007.....
Hojlund va haaland debate lol
Beautiful
Haahaahaahaahahahaahahahahaaaaaaaa 10 MORE YEARS OF THE GLAZERS 🤣😂😭😂😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭🤣 JOKE CLUB 😂😂😂😂😂
joke of a penalty...  refs not even trying to hide their bias   I looked forward to 3 penalties a game now being given for every little pull in the box... let's see if they're consistent
Penalty given to an away side AT Old Trafford? This truly are amazing times we're living through.
Did man just say Rodri clarted it? 😅😭😭
The scoreline massively flatters utd
Not a utd or city fan, but how was that a penalty? Watch lower league football week in week out and that's never a penalty here,
Keane ended Haalands career. Years later his son chooses City over United.
Onana deserved better. The lack of marking from the back 4 is the reason they lost today and there's not a huge amount he can do about a penalty
Fake club with their blood money
a man said “rodri clarted it”😂😂😂😂😂
Onana and Hojlund about Uniteds only good players. We are immense. Cant play us like this and hope to get away with it
Lucky goals from city  The pen Open goal Open goal again Onanareally carried United act
A bit Martin Tyler esque for the third goal!
“ Rodri clarted it “ 😂😂
This was the game where united could have shown that they're a team to be afraid of but this performance from United was a massive let down. They didn't even scratch City, let alone hurt them
😂
After 300 million and bringing in ten hag, United are no better than they were under ole.
Imagine buying a keeper who plays out from the back and he just ends up being a shot stopper instead
Not that it made a difference to the result, but only city would get that penalty. No one else. A minor tug in the box from a set piece. If that’s given you see 80 pens every weekend. And it’s not even given on field, but somehow egregious enough to surpass VAR’s “high bar” to award it. Not surprising given our refs are going to the UAE to ref games there for huge incomes and being wined and dined on private jets…
That united defense isnt even top 10 in the league
Haaland’s record in Manchester Derby’s so far…🥶
COME ON CITY ⚽️
Could have played Phillips and gave Utd a chance 😂
i don’t get the people hyping up that onana save from haaland in the first half, he’s just dived and the header is directly at his hands ofcourse he’s saving it. It’s not like a reaction save
Nah I can’t believe he said rodi clarted it 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
3-0 is decent for this MU team. No one is pretending City aren't far better than MU atm. Disappointing season after doing so well last year though. Hard to know what went wrong.
Utd r rubbish end off.
Clarted needs to be added to the dictionary 😂😂😂
Notice they didn't show Maguire's touchline clearance in the replay. Was excellent. Still the medias whipping boy.
City ruined the derby by playing on amateur difficulty.
the penalty angle looked like something straight from eafc
That game is proof that those players don't care about Sir Bobby Charlton. RIP legend. Sorry your club got destroyed.
well, man city has a coach.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏💪👍☝️✌️🎤🎛️🇬🇧🔊🔉🎶🎼🎵
Am I the only one who heard at 2:51 the commentator say “Rodri clarted it!!” 😂😂
United need sir Alex back and de gea job done!!!!
When are people going to realise that ETH is not a good manager, I can't think of one player he's improved. He's also signed all of the wrong players. As soon as Rashford isn't on form, they have no goals in the team.
Shite
Haaland has 11 goals, 2 assists in 10 premier league games and it's his least impressive start out of his first 2 seasons in the prem 😂
The penalty is an odd decision. It's not much of a foul but Gvardiol has got hold of Rashford on the edge of the box, which happens first, and therefore it should be a free kick the other way.
Bloody hell have times change city r now the team in Manchester. That's what oil money does.
Onana loves to dive about !
I would be embarrassed to be a United fan 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That save from Onana, holy chit. He predicted everything right, and that ball was moving from Hallands head, jeez
The late Bobby Charlton most definitely wouldn't be impressed with that shower not being able to raise their game for him.
Only man city would get a penalty for that drag back. Happens at least once in every match and never gets given.
Never a pen
Why didn’t Maguire continue tracking  Erling for the second goal?
That centre half glazier he is shite 😂😂😂😂
Without Onana in goals ten hag would have got sacked
Glory glory United 😂
Ten Hag was meant to bring a new era they said lol
Worst united team I've ever seen 😂😂😂
respect to haaland for securing the goal by assisting foden instead of attempting the hat trick
What this disgraceful fanbase deserves 😂😂. Bruno and Trashford your hero's right??
Onana was great today.
Fernandes belongs in Hogwarts toilets, crying and floating around…
Ballon dor ready
2:50 "Rodri CLARTED IT!!" 😂😂
Onana Man of the match
See, it’s not the keeper who’s at fault, It’s The Defenders (NOT GOOD ENOUGH). 7 or 8 players there’s should Not be 1st team players (This Is MAN U)😤😤😤
man united defence is abismal, mid field they don't even know where they , this team is disorganized
1:45 that onana save was out of this world!!
Man city on run now
Is it surprising Man U lost? You had Leicester’s ex defenders. And look where we are because if it!!! 😂😂
Man city "Fans" suddenly come back out their caves again. Plastic bunch.
With all the hate he's been getting since going to Man Utd he's most definitely improving, this game is perfect proof, amazing saves
2:50 did he just say Rodri "clarted it" 💀💀💀
Great tap ins from Tapland today
Before the game I said it had to be 3 or 4 nil. United are so average anything less would have been a sign that City might not be contenders this season.
The uncertainty of the club(the sale etc) is showing in 99% of our performances so far this season, it needs to get sorted ASAP.
2:51 “rodri clarted it” 😂😂
"Rhodri CLARTED IT!"
Gvardiol grealish and bernardo silva down the left today we’re absolutely unbelievable, Dalot gonna have nightmares for a long time
Buschester United are the type of team to lose 0 3 against man city
What defender thinks oh let’s leave halaand on the box on his own
Onana is the reason man u are conceeding like no tomorrow
"Rodri Clarted it"!
The save from  Emerson was brilliant
That first clip is absolutely horrendous. How are Rashford and Amrabat just walking back whilst Foden has that much space
Antony Fernandes rashford martinez martial. I could genuinely go on, a whole team full of moaners who’s egos are way bigger than their actual ability. I don’t feel sorry for united in the slightest because they’ve had plenty of success and every team has rough patches, even though some of their fans find that hard to believe, but the whole attitude and ability of the squad is rotten, barring casemiro and varane, it’s a team full of egotistical losers on disgusting wages
Any mancity incident, they will check VAR.
You would think with haaland being so dangerous that Manchester United would go out of their way to mark him but I guess that wasn't thought of lol
Haaland is unplayable hes atvthe end of almost everything Onana played great and it goes to show he has good performances in him,once again though utds back line makes it easy for the opposition.maguire,lindelof and evans not top 4 material and not good enough at the elite level at all utd looked like a mid table side against city today.
UTDs marking is shocking
Never a pen
MCFC OK 🇧🇼
It has to be said that United really are in a bad way
Nice when you can buy any player you want, ManchestArabia city showing that money does buy you prems🤣🤣 before them Arabian dons bought city it took yous 35 years to win anything remember that💀💀
Mad world we live in when Liverpool fans have to cheer on united just so they can help us stop city walking the league
What an attacking combination
United fans chanting "Keano" at Halaand, just another example of what a classy bunch they are..
Onana's confidence is helping him now. Could go back to being a top keeper.
Evans absolutely shocking!
Never a penalty 😂
Best team won but that is an extremely soft penalty!
I love the moment when Haaland make sign to Foden to go to celebrate (Y)
Crappy sweat goal, just like every player in eafc24
Football is just another system control mechanism. WAKE UP!
Defence on walk abouts 😅
2:50.. does he say Rodri 'clarted' it? 🤣
Fantastic performance from Harry maguire today, he should be knighted best player in England
Antony is so unlikeable
2:09 we'll just let Haaland run around on his own what could possibly go wrong 😂
Haaland and foden destroying Man Utd? This ain’t the first time is it!😂
Man ure 😂😂😂
Worst team to play for United in 60 years, yet clearly the best paid, by far. Instead of just blaming The Glazers at what point can all employed at the Club, especially the Players, management and staff, be up for fraud?.
United fallig apart faster than there ground
Bet city are humiliated….only scoring 3….utd’s season over and it’s still only October….taxi for ten hag.
Just let Bernardo silva run straight past for that second goal. Jesus Christ like.
Gutless.
A total mess since sir Alex left ten years ago
Baal and the tap in merchant 😅 people saying he’s just as good as Ronaldo etc lol not even as good as Bellingham
ManU goal keeper is the only world class talent and in this club
City absolutely dominated united in the theatre of dreams  Unplayable city
Ten Hag deserves a 10yr contract 😁.
I cant be the only one who flet mc Tominay and Eriksen needed to swap postions, we needed his play making in a more central postion but hey, not saying the outcome would have changed
Man Utd have a net spend of 100m less than City since 2009 yet the gulf in quality is huge
What an absolute whooping.
No way that was a penalty 😂
2:50 Rodri clarted it??
Fair play to Onana. Surprised how many times united left Haaland unmarked
Mancity Arsenal Tottenham Liverpool... Title Race  Manchester United, Chelsea battle of the mids
United defense is like butter
Onana did the same last week at Bramall Lane the only trouble was we lost
tbh utd kinda got robbed
I think the return fixture at city united would be better of putting the women's team on 😂
Bahahaha Man U fans are cheesing cos Onana only conceded 3. Finished football club
Those blood sucking owner have let united rot 😢
Foden and Haaland dominating manchester derby.. Ive heard this story before.
Here comes the utd fans blaming the glazers when they’re not in the pitch🤦‍♂️
Haaland only scoring 2 goals against Maguire and Evans, disappointing.
Really love Grealish style of play.  Never think about scoring himself but always looking for someone else better positioned. Him and Bernardo are another level
He’s had some shaky games so far this season but Onana was immense today
Onna's shot stopping technique is dreadful he keeps putting in back into the middle, you're meant to push it out wide, third goal is on him
The backline let Onana down today. A very dismal outing for Man U. Too bad.
Big up to any United fan who chose to tune in. Soon as I seen that lineup I thought to myself I’ll just take myself to the gym instead. Ten haag’s decision making is starting to become questionable, rashford starting every game. He keeps going on about a big squad and competing on but he doesn’t even seem to know when to create competition. Bruno at right wing? Why put your most creative player in a position that puts him out of the game. Tired
Bruno is a disgrace! He should be stripped of the armband asap for the way he conducts himself on the pitch never mind the fact that he is useless
That's why I support man city
Bent referee!   Heck his bank account.  No penalty.   Ot In a million years.
No defence, Onana was de best!
Fair play to Onana to keeping a clean sheet for once, by his standards.
Fun Fact:Maguire was MOTM for Man United....again
Other than Onana Uniteds defence is absolutely shocking
The Blues are back in town..
Evans and Maguire at centre back......
Just wait till the Geordies are in town on Wednesday night... another utd home defeat right there!
I’m a blue but the saves that he made it could have been 6 or 7. We have responded well after the losses hopefully continue that run
ETH is at the wheel hahahahahhahaha should of stuck with OLE united are the biggest banter club going hahahaha
0:17 Onana and Maguire fist bumping and high fiving each other as if Man City were never going to score today 😂😂👌🏻
Poor derby performance from United! Onana stopped it from being really embarrassing 🤦‍♂️
United need to get another wingback in January so Lindelhof doesn't have to play in that position and can be a cover for cb instead.   We got a lot of good strikers but Mctomminay has the most goals with 3. Ten hag out.
Is McTominay uniteds best player?
0-3 it was a good result for Man Utd
How embarrassing  it’s the glazers fault
Haaland shouldve had a hat trick
no onana and this is 7-0
Who would have thought Maguire and Onana would be this consistent 😮
Apart from maybe the second goal Onana couldn't do anything about the first and third goals and generally had a very good game with some outstanding saves and good positioning.
Haaland to win ballondor like Messi to win comment Mbappe to win dislike
rigged
Ten hag.....    Mmmmm     Not the manager utd fans thought they got.  😂😂😂    Found out
We were shocking today pure simple, fair play city 👏🏻
2:50 did he just say "Rodri clarted it" 😂😂😂
i miss MARTIN TYLER so much man, so much.
Only 3-0??!! WOW! What a great job Ten Hag is doing👏👏
All thanks to Onana this would have been worse
All the Cameroonians are on smoke this weekend loool
Great game onana getting in form again saving us from a 9-0nil match but the score should have been like 1 or 2 for man city if the defence actually was there and the attak needs to get up more and take shots then actually just dribbling or doing far passes and then losing the ball and applying preasure on onana witch again i felt like he played amazing
Smashed again, it's tremendous being blue!
Onana Tried his best
2:56 😂😂
and a tap in merchant is born welcome phil foden to the tap in squad lol
This is why I didn’t get excited after a scrappy 1-0 win over Copenhagen  When it matters, we are shocking!
Erik ten haag is completely over rated and Man Utd are a compelte shambles. He's alienated all the players and they arent even bothered.
City are a class team, fantastic without the ball and better with it. And it only took 116 breaks of FFP laws. 😂😂
Nice to see onana back to him self. 😂
If that's a penalty for Hojlund holding back Rodri then why wasn't it a penalty when Gabriel all but rugby tackled Hojlund at the Emirates? Onana really pulled out some quality saves but Maguire showed his limitations again.. Too slow to turn, unable to cover ground when it's played behind him.. I still back EtH.. With the right sporting structure above him he can succeed at United. The problems start above him.
So, the Man U tactic was to NOT mark Haaland ? Onana doesn't deserve that terrible defence.
Not sure how long ten Hag gonna last in the hot seat
Did Drury really just say that Rodri “clarted” it?
If I was a Utd fan I'd ask questions to why Onana had so many face offs with Haaland. Anyone at all marking him?
When you lose 0-3 and your keeper is still the best player!
Onana was United's best player. They're miles and years off it at United. Can't see top 4 for this squad this season. No chance
I love the way Haaland gifts it to Foden - then gestures on him to celebrate!  Real beautiful teamwork.
Onana doesnt deserve that shambolic team
lol at home and united just are terrible.
MU having to use their second string back line is not an excuse for the lack of, well everything else.   It could of been a lot worse but for some good saves.   The Striking Viking is back at it and the cluster at the top of the league is interesting with Villa sticking their nose in too.
When a coach of man u can’t beat a top team speaks volume. You are not a top coach. Stop the blame on players. It is tactics that win you a game.
1:24 aw Ederson what a save
United selling games for the last decades..... bloody hell ...
We not gonna talk about the unselfishness from haaland for the 3rd, absolutely outstanding
Mc Tom shoots straight at the keeper and the commentator calls it a great save 😂😂😂😂😂it's straight at him 😂
Haaland deserves that ballon dor
Nobody’s talking about Onana Today, He was World Class even though conceding 3 Goals. Also though, Man City Were by an absolute landslide the better team.
time for ten hag to go get big sam in till the end of season sort this mess out
Rodri ❤
Onana needs to be coached to hold the ball than to punch it away. But Manchester's losing was not down to him. Defenders errors time after time.
Man u can't sack the manager owners dont want to see. No money no prospects.  United now a mid table team for next 10 years
Antony and Bruno behaving like spoilt kids at the end was the icing on the cake. This is the worst Utd team since the mid 80's.
Ten hags recruitment has been absolutely brutal and dont say itsbtge glazers. He has signed loads of players he has worked with in the past!!!! This is in him
Honestly tho what a performance from Maguire 💀
Cut out where they called gvardiol akanji 2 times 😂
Haaland is cheeks without tap ins constantly being fed to him by the best midfield in the world
probably the least surprising result of the season so far
how is that a pen but brentford player pushing sterling off the ball yesterday when through on goal using his arms to push him off from behind isn’t a pen like what
The premier league is boring now.
It was like watching a league 1 team playing a premier league side in the FA cup 4th round. Levels apart
Onana is not a serious goalkeeper.
Erikson, Dalot way off good enough. Ten Haag is Clueless SMH 😳
Good match
When i see stones and dias starting together its automatic city win...no questions asked
Poor Man United. No longer old glory at all.
Off side again
Hearing Peter Drury say "Rodri clarted it" is one of the best things I've heard all day😂
Embarrassing joke 🤣 fairplay to haaland man u got pumped again
United can never be united again
He's off side
Such an obvious tactic! Balls into the channel to be stood up, every one runs towards the front post and haaland spins of around drops way back runs towards the back post unmarked
Onana actually played well
Grealish played well today.
Not a pen
Rodri claarted it 🇯🇲
Did MU even have an attempt on goal?
Drinking United fan's tears rn
did he say rodri clarted it 😂😂😂
I see a great game but I also notice free man Haland is not marked by left full-back or left Central Half. Also, see no fast speed in the central half to stop Phil Forlean from scoring.  No wonder they are always on about the issues on the left side of Manchester United's defence costing them the game and a new play is needed in the transfer market. Hopefully, the injured players on the left full-back and left central half come back soon to fix the goals leaking.
One week where we all just forget every other week of debatable performances from Onana and praise him as a god but come next time he even remotely slips up he will be hounded as always being bad again. The life of being an armchair pundit.
It's such a fall from grace for utd...they are miles off.....they still try and work hard for the most part but that's only part....you need quality to compliment it.... unfortunately utd don't have enough quality within the squad to compete against the best in the league.... there's more questions than answers currently.....the recruitment hasn't been good enough and they've over paid for quite a few of their signings.....they still are a huge club commercially but the football side,they are now just average....utd fans just need to accept it for what it is now.
Manchester is blue
This is just a 3 min vid of city dominating😂
The whole game city fans were louder than United 😅 “no fans”
Where is Ayan?
GLAZERS MUST BE LAUGHING TO THE BANK THEY PUT US IN THIS LEVEL WE NEED A MASSIVE DEMO ALL GLAZERS OUT, WE NEED JASSIM AND RATCLIFFE TO SHARE OWNERSHIP.
at the most basic level you'd probably say it's best to mark Haaland 🤷🏾‍♂️
Never a pen
Hoijland gave haaland a pen lol
How is that a penalty? 10 penalties in a game
Onana did well today despite the loss
Man utd  shocking shambolic performance  credit to onana for putting uo with such horrific defending
It’s games like this that make me so glad Arsenal have a good back four.
Is there someone on the world that is not a Utd fan that can stand Bruno Fernandes? He just spend whole 90min whinging. Top class performance from my blues. The poznan and the oles in the 85 was just beautiful to watch.
The positioning of the ManU defense line is shambolic
Sky, new commentator please.
Old Trafford is Man City’s training ground 🏟️, ETH out..
Manchester is clearly BLUE 🔵   Manchester United were absolutely AWFUL today.
Sacked in the morning
Firs of all halland scored a penalty that's easy and then he scored a header and then foden scored a tap in so it should be 1:0 to man city because it's a tap in and a penalty the easyst thing in football 😂😂
How did the United defence lose an almost 2 metre tall Norwegian tank at the back post ... Twice!
I honestly think Onana is getting better. He made some great saves despite the defence not being at their best at all. The line clearance from maguire though was good. (I do not support either of these teams, so don’t call me an Man Utd fan).
This United downfall you love to see it
I was at the game today
It's always good to beat utd at old Trafford come on city what's that in the sky oh it's a blue rising
Fun Fact PGMOL have made another horrific mistake
Anyone else see Anthony lashing out at doku. 😂😂
At the same time the penalty was given Rashford is gettin pushed out of the way. Referee and the var are a complete joke and I'll go as fa's as saying in the pockets of the oil tycoons
how much better is Haaland than Bellingham?
Despite conceding 3 goals, Onana was our best player on the pitch! GGMU!
Reminder that Hoijlund has just gone 007 in the premier league
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK"? BY PROFESSOR VEITH POWERFUL WATCH... TRUTH ALWAYS WINS 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
You'd think Utd would want to honour Sir Bobby's legacy by showing an ounce of determination, instead City barely got out of 2nd gear.  Can't wait for Ten Haag's excuse
Leaving Haaland alone at the back post for the second goal was criminal. Guess the 1.25 billion from Sir Rat will make glazers sleep peacefully tonight. (I know they probably don’t even know MU I playing today)
Important win for us blues. Hat's off to Onana for showing some real derby spirit too. The rest of Uniteds players were embarrassing.
Man utd are finished. ETH at the wheel. Loving ❤️ it liverpool all the way😂
The scoreline didnt reflect the game. Man utd were outclassed all match.
Shite United I united but this is a discrace
My teams so poor it hurts
I blame ten hag for making the change at half time, Utd had some decent chances and then soon as the change was made city just ran all over them, and I think they need a captain with discipline and Bruno doesn’t have that as most of time his hand are in air moaning at reds etc and Andre Onana played well ti keep it from being more than 3-0
Feel bad for Onana. He didn’t deserve to concede 3 goals.
Worst man u team I've ever seen , won't win nothing with that team . I can't see one player who would get in any of the top 5 teams . Awfull
Rodri clarted it
Enough to make you see red with a win for the blues, and the reds are having the blues. United were outclassed by City, a superior team with forceful forwards and resolute defenders.  City looked like the home side. As for the devil's team, the defence is seriously below par and in need of radical work.
Man city's games.when rodri was not here played.3.lossed.3 he's.bk pld 1 won 1
😭
Let's all laugh at Manure 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man Utd team love a bit of ball watching don't they?!
Antony bruno 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seven Tag starts packing his bags
Evans and Maguire are good against small teams just dont play them against top teams
There’s no way Man City gonna let Haaland leave until he retires 😂😂
Man Utd are an irrelevant joke that's been going since Fergi's retirement 😂
People out her disrespecting haaland because in all competitions he doesnt have more goals than games scored.Ridiculous😂
Ten games in and eighth in the table....
FRANNY  LEE    1,   SIR    BOBBY   CHARLTON   O,    both  would   love   being   out   there.
I hope Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool can give Manchester City a good challenge for the premiership.
you can't keep scraping late winners and 1-0's against relegation sides and expect not to get played off the field by any good side
I  supported man united ,but they have to improve so much what am seeing yea About man u is bad i feel like crying But Improve please😪😪😪😪😪😭😭🥵🥵🥵🥵☹☹😕😕😰😰🥺🥺🥺🥺
It absolutely baffles me why fans kick up a fuss when Man U get hammered! Firstly, let’s get something straight, Man U are no longer a BIG club! It terms of revenue they are a BIG club but in terms of performances they are way off. Last season TH pulled off the biggest fraud in premier league history finishing third. The reason was Liverpool and Chelsea absolutely capitulating allowing Man U to finish in a credible position. Man U won the Carabo Cup with the easiest fixture list in the history of the cup, with favourable home draws and the semi-finals featuring two relegation teams. Order is finally being restored this season and Man U are slotting back to where they should be! But then again it will be the Glazers fault for the wonky seats in row A in the stadium 🤣🤣
Man Utd are stinking out the Premier League, the sooner they go down the better. Awful football. Surprised they're on TV so much.
Maguire, Scott McTominay, Anthony Martial all need binning in January, not just based on this game but the time they've been there they've been woeful for years
whose is worse chelsea or man utd
the lack of marking on Haaland for his second goal was just criminal.  Mind bogglingly amateur.
really good performance from onana should of been 5 or 6-0
City are different class..👍 Forza JUVE..🤍🖤🦓
Now we know it ain’t Onana, the whole lot are rubbish
Bro at the end with that moncler 😅
Onana saved a 8-0 game tbh… his had a lot of stick from us fans but man played well. 3-0 had to take but oh well at least not 5-0 6-0
Onana should be paid double today haha 😂
i think it's safe to say expect to be a mid table team Utd
Onana stepped up.  Amazing stuff
Onana Fought Well Against Fury last Night And He Made Some Good Saves Today But He Should’ve Been Rested!
Embarassing. United are finished
What a player man.he’s just too good making the epl look like a Sunday league .
it still surprises me how Antony did not get sent off the highlights did not show it but if u watched the whole game u would of saw the foul he did to doku and only got a yellow and var didn’t even check it, madness
How is that a pen tho???
3 VAR penalties against united in a few weeks..
Both keepers INSANE
Next time we play City EH needs to be stuck in traffic‼️💀⚰️🤣 United forever I’m sure I can pick a better preforming team then our coach‼️🗣️💯
City reminding us that United are still indeed dead
Sorry(not really) but can’t stop self from enjoying a mank Utd loss -btw a Dunfermline fan not a citeh one
City payed refs
Maguire MOTM for me ngl
I wish they put the clip of doku and antony 😂
they can only score tap ins
Onana and Ederson were insane. I think man United let us down in the second half and they did well in the first half. GG city. You did well. I do think it shouldn’t have been a penalty
That's terrible from United.  Even for a mid-table club thats poor.
Onana is the new hero
Man utd.  Dont no what to say   the team is complete crap  about 4 good players they have    . The manager not good enough.. I always said they should of got the  robert de zerbi... in as manager
That was so easy for city
Gone are the days where goalkeepers actually catch the ball,they just put their team and themselves under more pressure by keep palming it away,generally leading to more goalscoring chances 😢
You cant have Evans and Maguire as your CB partnership and expect to be taken seriously as a club.
Easy win for Manchester City
Onana had a good game for the first time this season , and not a defender within a mile of Haarland for his second goal
Last week the media and United were saying the spirit of Sir Bobby Charlton, God rest his soul, carried them to their victory.   I guess today they could have done with Sir Bobby passing away a week later.
Was harry maguire playing ?
ten hag out
relegation fodder
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🥵🥶🤬🤬🤬🤬
AS A UTD FAN NOT SURPRISED 1 BIT SURPRISED IT WASNT 10 0 TEN HAG OUT  ITS NOT GLORY GLORY UTD ITS BORING BORING UTD
I think this will be one of the best and exciting title races of the last 10 years this season and Arsenal will nick it by 2 points city Liverpool spurs villa and arsenal will be the big 5 going to the very end i think if Eddie Nketiah can keep his performances like yesterday up then im going for Arsenal to win the league because Timber will be back fit in February and Arsenal have a fantastic Squad now with depth also Bayern Munich for the champions League title this year ❤
United played crap again how the hell does ETH make this team better I'm sick of it 😣😢
Yet again united best player is the keeper and they still lost 3 nil.
Haaland's all round game isn't good, he doesn't score insane goals, but he's an old school striker who gets the job done.
Haaland and Foden yet again against Utd. Last time they both scored hattricks
Citeh
nah united tripping giving mason mount the number 7 😂
Yet again Haaland and Foden decide a Manchester derby quite emphatically 🔥🔥
United are so bad 😂
haaland   did  not get    a           shot     at                  arsenal
Onana's positioning was absolutely shocking. Some saves were just fixing his bad positioning and to be honest he is good at making simple saves to look like amazing ones.  Everything else ends up in the net. Where was anyone marking far post with the second goal? Also, Onana assisted with the 3rd goal. What was he doing? GK transfer of the season is Inter selling him that expensive. Man U had better chance even sticking with De Gea.
HAALAND HAS SCORED 5 MANCHESTER DERBY GOALS AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE MANCHESTER DERBY FODEN HAS SCORED 4 MANCHESTER DERBY GOALS AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE MANCHESTER DERBY MANCHESTER IS BLUE
Fair play to Onana. This could easily have been another 7-0.
man city the best side in the world by a country mile and kdb coming back it will all be over by chistmas seen it all before if it were not for there goalie it would of got real ugly
At the point Rhodri hits his shot ahead of the 3rd goal, Haaland is 2 yards further out than his defender. By the time he takes control after the save he’s 4 yards ahead of him. It’s either great anticipation or just awful, lazy defending.
Only Saliba and Gabi can lockdown the alien 👽👽.
Man united do not have fight in them
Premier League is just The Haaland Show at this point
Commentators trying really hard with Onana's name today 😂
Manchester is blue.
Haaland on a hatrick but sets up Foden. Class
How easy city played,umbeliveble how sht this United players are,all of them.
Congrats.   Via lfc support..    &  go blue city's..
Haaland is a robot if you agree. 👇
Defence is sleeping on all goals.
Despite United always going to lose this game , for me if that’s a penalty then there is a penalty almost every corner in every game , start giving these no one’s ever going to be able to grapple for position , ten Hag got to go his lost the dressing room again 😢😢t
United 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Basically, the fortunes of both Clubs have reversed place! Just goes to show the difference between the owners of one club draining billions out of it into their own pockets, and the owners of another pumping billions into it, regardless of Financial Fair Play! About a Billion Per Goal swing I'd say! 😂😂😂
Big ederson showing everyone why’s he’s a top class keeper
Harland could of had 6
Conceded three but Onana was still probably Utd’s best player. Was always going to be a tough night with Evans and Maguire are the starting CB pairing.
Leather face scores again nah nah nah leather face haaland scores again 😂 leather face scores a brace
This Banana praise is ridiculous. He made the most out of everything, big daft camera saves or saves that were straight at him and he still palmed the last goal to a City player. My goodness the bumlicking is beyond cringe. He is absolutely pony.
what a game
nobody's trolling onana anymore😄
If it wasn't for Onana the scoreline would've been 7 or 6. Good performance by him but the rest of the team 😅
Pep be like in the dressing room let's unplugg haaland robot machine. Ten hag be like mabye we should unplugg Maguires life support.
Couldn’t blame maguire
They were taught how to play football...pep did say that these lot are not a challenge before the game. Helpless thats the word of the day for utd😢
City is the  best
United lost their heads, doesn’t show you Anthony and Bruno kicking out and head butting Man City players… CTID CTID I KNOW I AM IM SURE I AM IN CTID
United is a mid table team
Manchester United need to loan ALL of Arsenal’s players loool😢😂
I hope city get shafted with all the charges against them! Wouldn’t be surprised if it all gets swept under the rug though
it could be 6 nil without onana
Embarrassing for United fans. Absolutely terrible at the moment.
Man u poor squad a manager unable to motivate nothing but  DEATH,players that have now given up City normally start reving up in Jan.Can not blame the Glaziers they have allowed the expenditure but every buy is poor.
Forgot to say in my earlier comment, thought Grealish was outstanding again
Anyone else hear the commentator say “rodri clarted it” 😂
I love how a Utd fan quoted " how many times have Manchester United been robbed by VAR?" lol
Uniteds defence totally asleep for the last 2 goals
Why was Haaland allowed to be all by himself all the time?
United defence is too weak and they always blame onana
Do United train? That was..
Glad to see McGuire back in the team and doing well...😮
Onana onana  HEY he took me back east in
did bro say rodri clarted it lmao 2:50
I feel sorry for Onana
Bet the Man U fans are blaming this one on the glazers again
Congrats city's..
Doesn't change that fact that Brentford have won as many premier league games at Stamford bridge as Chelsea have in 2023
Man City are incredible
Eric Ten Egg 🥚
never a pen
So City get a penalty but somebody was giving Rashford a hug at the same time. 6 of one….
Ten Hag making weird substitutions yet again.
onana improved im  suprised
Yeah it might not have effected the end result, but that penalty decision was an absolute disgrace
Old Trafford roof still leaking goals 😂😂😂😂
A stroll in the park again for city salford fc would have given them better game 😂
Man U have spent hundreds of millions on transfers in the last few years, yet how the hell do they have a defence partnership of Maguire and Evans against the best squad in the world right now?
Can't say im surprised
Lazy defending
Can Onana not hold the ball ?
Did utd turn up to this game?
Wasn’t even close. Truly an embarrassing display from United. Painful.
UNITED PLAYED QUITE WELL. CITY LUCKY TODAY
Utd are dreadful long season for them
City are more than a class above Utd at this current time. They're miles ahead of them. If it was 5-0 no one could argue & say it wasn't deserved.
United are done at top level it’s over we are the new Everton disgrace these players earn what they do they are awfully mid table don’t ever compare them to a top 4 club because they aren’t these players are a joke minus the youthes who I actually want to leave for their own career United are a joke
City are charging up, Pep has almost completed his puzzle for this season, the streak is about to begin you could just see the patterns building today 🎯🔥
As a Chelsea fan, I’m glad we’re not alone. 😂
Seeing Chelsea and Manchester United being so deep in the mud week in week out is brilliant to see.
Men against boys , embarrassing how much better City were, they were just playing with United today.
On the passing of sir Bobby that performance was disgusting totally unforgivable.
Based on this we ain't winning anything for a while, we're out of race for the prem, we might as well give up on the champions league, Newcastle will beat us in the carabao Cup & we'll be ko'd from the fa Cup
Haaland really on his way to being the greatest striker of all time
Man utd back to their best. Its quite clear now the prem was corrupt when fergie was there as we can now see the proper man utd  75000 people sitting in a stadium watching dross with no fight. Thinking theyre a big club but theyre not. Saying stuff like scholes is better than gerrard. Scholes can pass but gerrard passed it in the top corner about 200 times from 40 yards at about 200mph
Fantastic win CITY!! 😛😂😂👌👍
Best team won  . Utd played well for all of 5 mins I feared it would have been a lot worst .
Smashed the Trafford shite again. Easy
Can we all laugh at Manchester United please? Use my like button to laugh at the club in the mud.
Antony showing at the end why people question his temperament and the fact he may actually be a woman beater
Make no mistake this side is world class
Onana and maguire are the only reason why man united didn't concede more. Manchester is 🔵
Great result for united today. I'm sure they'll be over the moon only losing by 3 goals!
Like watching a dog mauling a bone and a long trip in the rain back to London for the poor United fans.
Bernardo was unbelievable this game and that cross topped it to haaland brilliant player.
Man Utd is simply rubbish not a team that can play in premier league football ⚽️!!! Fact
The entire team showing everyone why Manchester is still blue came to old Trafford and took them apart🔵
Bruno is the worst complainer I've ever witnessed. Brings me joy to see him lose.
That second goal the most potent striker in the world and his standing on his own at the back post like his missed the last bus home
3 Points isn't for everyone
Oil Money FC prevail once again, fake club
Could have been 6/7 onana was on fire
With so many injuries meaning having to start the likes of Maguire and Lindelof, it's going to be a tough upcoming set of fixtures for Man Utd
Onana 1000% regrets joining Man Utd
We don't want ETH OUT we want GLAZERS OUT. LET'S be realistic we were always going lose today.
We knew it was going to be a spanking...onana is looking good though
With Maguire there it was always going to be a goal fest...The goalkeeper was amazing...
United's defence is still bad. The fanbase may blame Onana but he played really well this game. Haaland is literally wide open on the second goal and the third goal United reactions were slower than 1990's WIFI.
City patterned them...but that was NOT  a pen... if it is every team ever is owed a thousand penalties
the united we all know and love
We got robbed
Bernardo silva won this game. Absolute king of pass and move
Remember when ETH said that all eras come to an end 😂
😢😢😢
The fact that we couldn’t even string a few passes together and kept allowing the ball to run out of play. We are light years behind the other top clubs in the pl and we have a long long way to go
To be honest Onana was good his defence was very poor
Did no one told Man u haaland was playing cus nobody bothered marking him
I can't believe ten bob had the audacity to start maguire and Evans and expect to get something from that game.
As Onana was amazing and still City scored three goals, I would question Utd defence…
Exceptional marking of haaland
Why in 2023 is Jonny Evans and Maguire uniteds centre back partnership
Gary Neville sounds defeated having to commentate some games of late 😂
Did Maguire play?
Manchester United u are all beginners level …
'Big derby win'. Idk why they act like this is surprising. We are like how Man City was when we were dominating. The tables have turned, only difference is they have 115 charges against them.
I don't know who is worse that keeper or maguire
Wow! Maybe defend against the best striker in the Premier League??? How much space did he have!!!!
5 goals and 3 assists already for Haaland in Manchester derbies. Not that this is a big game, so Haaland still needs to perform in big games
ten hag is a fraud
Never a penalty but the result was expected regardless. Rashford et all need dropping. Can't keep playing out of form lazy players and expect them to just magically score bags of goals.
The allegation of Haaland only scoring against small teams continues 😂
Onana was the only one worth their salary today. Great performance from City!
Would love these to be 5-6min highlights
Rashford showed more love and passion with Aitch than this derby 😂
Penaltys are going to go up this season
Cristiano Ronaldo was a massive problem
Is it just me, or did my man say Rodri clarted it 2:50 - 2:55 😂
At this point this is no more a derby 😂
City played this game as though it was a pre season friendly against their B team.
So many saved onana against city
United are officially a mid table club and are being run into the ground.
This Man Utd team is absolutely shocking. City are great to watch
United are so bad 😂😂😂
Rodri is back so haaland is scoring again 😂
Crazy how mctominay is genuinely uniteds best player
But but Maguire was the 🐐 again after his moms against Brentford, Sheff Utd and Copenhagen
This could have been much, much worse for Utd of not for Onana!
As a utd fan, Bruno Fernandes is the most overrated player in the league and needs to be sold. Foden grealish bernardo showed him what an attacking midfielder looks like
should have been 2-6
i hate halland give all teams a break
United gave up after City's 2nd goal
Respect to Onana, would have been worse for united
Rashford played well🤷🏾‍♂️
MANCHESTER IS BLUE 🔵
Hoijand assisting Haaland for the pen was hilarious 🤣🤣
Did anyone see Maguire’s fresh air  attempt at a header 😭
Don’t worry United fans. At the end of the season you’ll all be supporting City during the title race between them and arsenal
The only Man U player deserving some accolade is Onana  He worked so hard to keep the scores at 3!  Completely Outplayed by City!
Ten Hag will never bring Altay and that is sad.
Bruno should be thanking his lucky stars that he has stats. Without stats he'd be no better than christie from Bournemouth
Man Utd have only gotten worse with Eric bald fraud at the helm.
Antony thought doku was his gf
The way Haaland pointed out to Foden to go celebrate with the crowd was just so funny.
Ten Hag out. Rashford is a fraud, the most overated player I've ever seen. Embarrassing club.
that was the most 1 sided derby ever,. utd never layed a glove on city, utd where poor all round
Haaland slowly getting revenge
Eirling hasn’t been very accurate but more than enough 👌🏽👌🏽🦾
Yes it was a soft penalty decision but Man Utd fans, you still lost 3-0, it wouldn't have made any difference.
People saying haaland is having a bad season he’s got 11 goals in 10 games. Just shows how high his standards are 🤖
Drop onana
Onana's best game
174th like            Like it matters
Before his move to city I was expecting him to be good. But this is just insane- he's so consistent. Same with Bellingham aswell.
haaland is gold ✨
Very close game, Man City just got lucky today.
Quite a one sided derby ,there was a lack of United attack for most of the 2nd half,Haaland running the show as usual 🤷🏿‍♂️
That’s a soft penalty
the Manchester is blue and the fans are calm hmmm🙂🙂🙂🙂
How is anyone complaining at that pen? He’s lost his man and dragged him down it’s as stonewall as it gets. United making everyone’s weekend as usual🎉
Maguire and evans at the back with lindelof at left back.. losing was inevitable wasn’t it
Bernardo Silva is so good man.
Haaland might be the best penalty box striker I’ve ever seen. The guy is ALWAYS in the right place, and his movement is exceptional
Robbery never a pen that defleatted our moral
Haaland has to win the ballon d'Or .....
I thought Harry maguire was proving the haters wrong 😂
Not like we didn’t have chances, if we finished half of them then it’s a completely different game
Let's all laugh at united 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i’m here
United fans will blame this on the glazers.
Getting done 3-0 in your own backyard is embarrassing no matter who you’re playing
Haaland deserves ballon dor pure class
Destroyed humbled and embarrassed United were
Man City🔥🔥🔥
First
Can you believe people actually sold Haaland on FPL?
Imagine supporting united 😂
Erik ten Bob
Crazy game by Foden!
Antony thought Doku was the missus lmao
Evans was shocking the 2 goal he leaves Haaland open and decides to go for Rodri and the 3rd goal plays Haaland miles onside smh whyyy
Hojlund can finally join Havertz in the 007 club
How have they left Haaland unmarked for the second goal, you just cannot give him those chances
Foden and haaland own United
PLS DO NOT CATCH UP WITH TOTTENHAM
UNITED ARE A SMALL CLUB 😂😂😂
Haaland strikes again❤❤❤
Man City were better but have so much help; that penalty wouldn't have been given for other teams
Erik Bin Bag🤣
Hojland 007 has arrived  0 goals 0 assists  7 games! 😂😂 Utd fans really tried to compare him to haaland 😂😂😂😂
What a game! Keepers from both ends made stunning saves
Nice win city
Haaland scoring a brace in the Manchester derby. He’s just unstoppable. Crazy how he ain’t gonna win the ballon d’Or…
Man U got cooked 😂😂
Jones and Maguire rest of season please
Manchester’s blue
Silva was magnificent today. Caused United problems everytime he was on the ball.
Oh the lord help us when we go to anfield with maguire and evans starting..😅
Poor United
Fun Fact: Haaland has scored the same amount of Premier League goals this season as Man Utd
Tottenham Arsenal Man City Liverpool where is Man U and Chelsea At farmer camp ⛺️
What did people expect?
Onana saved United from a 8-0 defeat.
For sir Bobby Charlton 😂😂😂
The way antony was acting like a baby got me dying 🤣
City must of being licking there lips when they saw that Utd defence on the team sheet 😂😂Maguire & Evans at the back in 2023 ! Utd really are a dusted club 😂😂😂
Haaland for the Ballan Dor?
Typical united
1st
Early
