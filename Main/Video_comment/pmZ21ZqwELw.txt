iconic
i was so captivated by the dandruff that i lost all context of the video
is it just me or did Chris just come across as an absolute wanker in this video? the ego on this guy...
Shame he didn't even talk about the "do it for the unpaid workers" clip. That's iconic
Nothing says high quality like a reaction video
Stephen directioner confirmed
I've seen this video more than 30 times, and the Tinder video with ChrissyMD about the amount. Why? Because they are so damn funny. I laugh every freakin time.
08:51 it's not homophobia Chris, it's called LGBTQ representation 🏳️‍🌈 Sidemen are so woke they're not even gay and they've been repping the lgbtq from the start 🙌🏼  it's kinda sus that you think it's homophobic tho... what's homophobic about Ethan sucking a penis?
4:35 the babadook Clip is unmatched
0:51 big up warwick racecource
Although it's nice to see quality go up; from a viewer's perspective, it feels like Stephen and Chris have lost touch with the past. The quality of editing is not what makes a video great. Admittedly, I don't watch these youtubers anymore but their old content still appeals to me a lot more than the new polished videos. Even if the footage isn't of the best quality or the most relevant to the core idea of the video, getting to see the small interactions b/w them is what made them great. It felt personal, not corporate like it feels now. Maybe it's the rose tinted glasses of nostaliga speaking but I miss the simpler times.
I love the joke about Stoke as I a man who comes from therefore
This is when Youtube was raw, pure and fifa 17 was out so I will be honest I watched all of these and enjoyed them immensely. Hate overly scripted stuff but don't mind the big production budgets so swings and roundabouts
Chris has Short man syndrome
Not gonna lie, this was peak YouTube.
There's some old youtube videos I try to go back and watch cause I really liked them...then I stop and wonder why I ever watched them
i was expecting filthy frank or idubbbz😔
Stoke reference, I hate where I live.
What happeneed to lewis?
I live in a cul-de-sac 😅
Love that sprinkled homophobia in  good old YouTube
Stoke again, another mention 1:55 😮
This comedic duo is so, so good
I think I MAX was a real YouTube glory his famously excellent film reviews were a thing of legend
just cause he said dick doesn’t mean it’s homophobic lol
Bro who ever makes this thumbnail is so not good at it
These videos are actually better. If i wanted to watch top production id watching TV or netflix. This is real and relatable, and is what made youtube unique, with a real connection to the creator. Now its just like any other media form.
5:44 so it was the side men that gave us the draft excluded that we see in the prem nowadays?
The only YouTuber where I’ll watch the sponsor vid. Maybe Chris also
the editing is self aware in this video
BRING BACK THE POD I SWEAR OR ELSE ITS MY 13th REASON
stephen x chris link up, christmas has come early 😍
Your going to end up on SunnyV2 if you carry on with these shit vids & shit guests Ste, get the poddy back
Was nice of Chris to use his webcam mic for this one
I love how Chris sounded so dead pan lmao
that ksi crossbar challenge is one of, if not THE greatest video in youtube history
Opera ad done well
homie said: "this is one of the best youtube videos ever....... theres a lot of sprinkled homophobia in there" lmfaooooo PAUSE
Hope I can get a reply from Stephen.. or Chris 🧐🥺
started making vids becuase of you! You the MAN!
Stephen and Chris are a hilarious duo
always sunny clips are always great
Dying at the calfreezy roasts man 😂😂😂
If you aged and developed as a human being watching Stephen tries religiously but he didn’t grow and develop, check Finn Taylor out, he’s what you’d expect Stephen should have been like.
Chris best videos are with shannon
I would argue, Chris Dixon is a better Youtuber called Chris, than ChrisMD
that alarm gave me ptsd
It fucks with my mind how you took a sponsorship deal for a browser where you advertise specifically that it has ad-blocker. So you got a deal for more money to make less money here?
If I wanted to see that tears Face I would sub to him…. But I don’t…. As no one wants to see it
The old videos are way better imo, maybe it’s nostalgia idk
The fact that the last video is a Guinness world record holder is mind boggling!!
Kieron browns videos have never changed🤦‍♂️
Such good too and fro. Chris could jump in a skit and do well
I thought vikstar was about to start praying and shouting alluh Akbar
I feel like I’m contracting ADHD from this
I look at my 10 year old sister and say she watches some shit on youtube, but I watched the same shit, just a football version of it...
Great vid mate, may need some background music though
No Ryan? I’m cryin. No Ryno? Goodbye now.
16:22 - well, of course he'll add that part.. but, it is a fact. 🤭
just realised what happened to chris’ perm lmfaooo
Chris isnt even good at football the whopper, no wonder his mrs left him
What do you think of the Rhyno's podcast Ste?
Stephen Tries would be the only youtuber I'll watch all the ads for!
WE WANT RHYNO! WE WANT RHYNO!
Slough has Europe's biggest trading estate so in many ways, that is Wonderland.
06:25 - Someone's clearly not a newbie 😉😂😂
Ste i am getting severe shakes and spasms without ryans crying i NEED to see that 7 head again plesse
stephen being a 1d stan love it!
WHERE IS JERRY CHRISTMAS
8 people in an office to make a fucking ChrisMD video is absolutely wild.
Class vid again Ste 💪 miss the pod
My man finally got a sponsorship!! Let's make Stephen a millionaire
It's breaking my mind that a Youtuber is being paid to advertise a product that takes away his ad revenue
hilarious
Chris, Stephen, Will + Harry would be the best flatmates to have... No day would ever be unfunny !
I can’t believe you’re promoting an an blocker as a YouTuber. Surely you want people watching ads
I wonder if Chris is scared about the current state of YouTube as several ginger people are more popular than him
Me thinks we have a xmas poddy. Yumma yumma
Don't Translate it 😨 หลังจากนั้นไม่กี่ชั่วโมง หัวใจของคุณจะหยุดเต้น วิธีเดียวที่จะป้องกันสิ่งนี้ได้คือสมัครรับข้อมูลบน chanel ของฉัน ........
It's mad that YouTube back then was just either filming a day put with your mates or making a football video. That was UK YouTube and now it's higher production then Half TV shows.
The best videos back then were only like 4-8 mins long so they were very rewatchable, I must have watched every football video you showed in this 5+ times as a kid
8 people do a single video a fkn month? What.
I love Stephen … get the bag … but nobody will use Opera 😂
12:25 though hahaha ! 13:06 HAHAH ! Poor little Chris 🤭 15:39.... 😰 I don't want that to happen
Looking dapper as per 😃
This was just 17 minutes of Chris and Stephen brutally roasting early Calfreezy's editing and I'm here for it
the poor gopro!
Is he George Clarkey's brother? Probably not spelled his 2nd name properly 😅
chris calling stepehn a stupid ginger c*nt truley is a moment of pot calling kettle ginger
12:12.. I assumed because were are redheads Stephen that your joke would've been that we're too pale..  But nice Ted Talk haha, 12:25 though hahaha !
wroetoshawtism
9:01 though hahaha, poor Jamie + Lewis.. but respect to his team of editors, his videos are stunning now !
YouTube back in 2006/2007 were simpler times, the vlogs were simpler, editing wasn't the best, WMM was used a lot for everything, webcam footage instead of an actual camera........ sigh. Only sad part of today is that most videos are getting copyrighted or demonitized, as a fan video editor/video editor I have to pitch the music haha  But the editing today is cleaner + some of yours and all of Chris' videos are works of art, able to add tv show/movie references, use any form of camera for footage/vlogs.. Editing is now an art.
Welcome back to stephen tries to cope with his low views, RHINO RHINO
how sweet of you to give a much smaller youtuber a platform stephen
Chris needs to sort his ego out
12:39 I like the ironic use of Simon here; he also hates when editors do that in football vids
Boo Chris is poo 💩
It's nice of Stephen to get smaller up-and-coming YouTubers on for these videos
Hi Stephen
bring back rhino!!
more vid like this stephen x
Some of this era was wild. Would love to see you look back at something like the fifa playa. A balaclava'd Spencer Owen pretending to throw his ejaculate in Maya Jama's face must never be forgotten.
Stephen must be one of the best YouTuber that’s doesn’t do way to much videos with high effort!!
bloody hell Chris, a month! and you're still nowhere near Stephen's level
We want max back please
stephen!!!!
Can't believe you finally got a sponsor,  although its not Manscaped. Now you have the money to bring back Max instead of this Chris guy
my fave ginger degenerate is back!
My life is in shambles without Tim Looney’s celebrity gossip, Ste. I need to be hearing about these current affairs and I need to be hearing his looney statements. Bring it back
Quality vid with Mr. Muck Duck
wow
i am eagerly awaiting the return of the poddy c
are you easy stephen?
Whens the podcast coming back?
goat
wow nice vid
Why small one? we want max
Good to see Chris big dick Dixon on here
