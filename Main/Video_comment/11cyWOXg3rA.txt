second guys dad must have been scammed a LOT. you saw the shock o thesecond mortgage because he knew it wasnt worth a lot :/ poor guy. the dad.
Craig is the man ...love him
21:55 67 goofy ahh mango blud💀
Boat brake out another thousand.
The punk who is trying to sell the fake gorget (sp ?)for over $100k is so way out of his elements and rude. Totally off and nerdy
They talk of  a 57 and then they show a 55.
O:45 if you look up DUHHH....in the dictionary that pic of Chum Lee is in there 😂
The 2 happiest day of a boat owner is the day they buy it and the day they sell it. I would pass on that boat. :/
4:01 “ok😁”
That dude and the glastron boat...you probably know its a money pit and your trying to pass it off as some rarity. Go sell it to other boat lovers and they will probably spurn you because they are upkeeping their own personal money pit of a marine recreational vehicle 😂
3:35 When your dad takes a 2nd mortgage for a necklace.
I feel bad for the lady with the Elvis Signature
The last guy with the leather briefcase was a jag off!
10,000 for a boat isn't that bad, I know there is cheaper but I don't think that's all that bad
Lip stick on a pig is his wife, that's why he won't do it.
last guy looks ready to fake some documentation to come back lol
If these guys can't rob you of more then 50% of the value then they won't buy your stuff!
Old Jackasses
Second guy has the most punchable face i have ever seen
Rick really insulted that guy that was trying to sell the boat. He also insulted the second man really bad. Rick really knows how to make someone feel foolish and stupid.Rick is definitely the king of shooting people down in flames.
I could tell that contract was a copy....all the print was 5he same ink....a real version, what was typed would never match the printed ink
Great acting performances all around here.
I think the ‘experts’ are in cahoots with the pawn shop.
16:16 everyone's heart sinks......  That Car 1:01 and Boat would make a great Pair. I would have grabbed it just to pull it through town or go to car shows. Let Dad fish off it for a few years and sell the two as a ensemble.
He is mistaken… it looks like a ‘59 Chevy, not a ‘57.
The second dude is way out of line… but he’s right. Bout time someone said something to the lowballing half eaten McDouble offers
Pawn shop and deals...no
THE INDIANS he says
I don't believe a word of what the expert said about that Hart rifle.
I saw the episode with the Glastron boat, about a year later I saw one on the side of the road for $1,100! Probably in better condition with the original outboard motor. However I still didn't jump on it? But the cool factor was definitely there, and I guess you really can find another one?😅😂
"Find one" Dude, I can't find a Yugo for sale, doesn't mean anyone wants one
That gorget 100k, yeah right!!!  P.s never trust a pawn shops so called "experts".
Paul Tuttle on Pawn Stars? hahahaha
That second kid lol
is there any good info on how scripted was this show?
Poor lady.
“I know you’re an expert but it’s not the answer I wanna hear and my mommy said I’m always right” smh
The Elvis expert said that the contract was a copy and explained why but didn't actually prove it. All he did was look at it through a magnifying glass and said it was a copy and that to me isn't good enough. Prove it's a copy. He didn't.
Guy with the poleaxes took it super well compared to some of the others
As an antique arms collector, the guy with the gorget is definitely a methhead.
Chumlee looks like the light is on but nobody is home.
First dude has a tude 😂 and was upset little guy
Almost like these people are paid to act that way. IS there a word for that? People paid to act?
I can tell from a mile away that Elvis contract was a copy.
have one use shoe laces for sale. "Let me call my expert"
It’s worrisome when someone with a bunch of objects that they think are valuable artifacts puts their eggs in the basket of, “I need the money, this will sell for x amount.”  In my experience a lot of people expect an amount far above what they are actually worth.  Sometimes significantly far above.  Don’t count your chickens as they say.
So satisfying, that old bag who couldnt speak without her dentures nearly falling out deserved that, if she was so passionate about Elvis, she would never sell the piece. But all she wanted was that green cash. Shes probably green algae by now 🎉🎉🎉
I see those old boats all the time, junked… Dorset made a lot of them too
Alvis contracted a woman; look at her reaction when she was told it is a copy. What a liar!
The fact that people think this is real...
The second guy needed that drug money so bad
It’s amazing how Americans always think, that the 1st amendment gives them the right to believe whatever they feel to be true, listen to the guy at 28:02. Without evidence or against all evidence, they still believe they are right!
How about start giving your customers their asking price. I will not comment back, I will not argue, I will not talk back, I will not listen, nor will I hear the opinions of others, zilch, nothing, got it.
i could see that the elvis contract was a copy in the first shot
That gorget looks like something youd make for cheap to trade with people who dont know how to make metal armor. Completely non functional
in all likelihood, dude is probably an actor- but imaging the delusion he must in after telling himself for so long that he’s sitting on $100,000 😂😅
Rick only looks for flaws. I agree with the customers
Alexa Bliss swallows.
The poleaxe guy is never happy though.
The Lindbergh guy was a moron. He believes in nothing because he has zero proof. He 100 percent disagrees with bona fide facts and I guarantee he never sold it.
Not an avid watcher of the show, just random clips here and there....  Are the kids really as dumb as they seem on TV?  Or just an act?
Lol Craig is a dream killer
All of the Pawn Stars professionals will always find in favor of the Pwan Stars! every time!!!!
“I think he just thinks I’m just some punk kid” -Some punk kid 😂
The last guy is probably a scammer. “If that were the case I’d have never bought it” I thought it was found in the house my dude? He made up some weird story that sounds like he runs it to all the local pawn shops
4:38 zinc was isolated in 1746 by German Chemist Andreas Marggraf.
Dose anyone know if the guy ended up selling that boat anywhere else
Chum looks so smug its too fun y 😂
LOL Not Dingleberry, Germany ☠
WOAH A BOAT
I love how Greg is like “ok, I guess my PhD means nothing. Goodbye” *handshake*
“I’ve done my research. But I have no PhD. I just fix air conditioning
That fools haircut is from the 1700s
“He wath bathically inthulting me about my booooat” 😢  Your boat blows
Sometimes these experts feel like they say nah not real just because they want to look smart😂😂
Elvis may not have invented rock n roll, but hes the indisputable king
I 100% disagree with the historian. Moron.
The dude with the rifles missed the William Hart inscription 🙄🙄🙄
5:19 bro thinks it's worth $100,000 but it's literally $1,300 on Ebay 💀🤡
Do these people not realize their coming to sell their stuff to get resold? If they wanna get actual value gotta find a collector to buy it. Duh 🤦‍♂️
Why was the first guy even taking his boat to a pawn shop? Theirs gotta be a market for those, someone would be willing to pay more than the 10.5 he asked.
They broke too 😂  the highest they’ll go is 5k they’ll never buy something expensive expensive
“I got a buddy let me give him a call” “I know someone who knows about these let me give them a call” bro I feel like half of these people they  call is jus fake 😂it’s funny
Oh my god at 15:13 I thought she stuck the two fingers up at them when she heard the valuation😂😂
been watching this show for years. I've seen some dumb people but lord, these people top it.
Chum Lee is blasted out of his mind haha
"based on what I've studied."  might as well say "my source is that I made it up."
you can get that boat for $800
😂😂😂😂😂 the last man  with " And it gonna cost whole lot more
Who ever did the letter stamping should be ashamed of themselves..
those boats people give them away in miami with that motor
That second guy is like if rodrick from diary of a wimpy kid jumped out of the book anf started trying to thrift his parent's stuff for weed money
“Can you even find one?” Who cares, that doesn’t mean more money, demand for it means more money
There is only 150 like this left ? dude I never seen 150 boats XD
The scenes with rick in the back of store there's 3 guitars.  Red strat , anyone know what the blue guitar is?
He is a punk kid 😂
Guy #2 looked like Shaggy from Scooby doo, but a hangry Shaggy. He needs to eat some scooby snax.
I enjoy hearing about these items but lord the hosts are thick as pigs
That poor lady wasn’t upset about the Elvis contract being a copy..
I could that Elvis one was a copy with out all the magnifying glasses lol
He painted the POS boat with automotive paint. Couldn’t even go for gel coat, or even sand down the ratty fiberglass before finishing.
The elhis thing, i can see its not an original and im in another country without a magnifying glass. It looked like a copy, the signature and all the hand writeen stuff all looked printed and not written, ut was obviously just for tv that they added this clip/item
The boats ugly af
Always hated this show and the pawn brokers.
You gotta be a blind moron to not see the Elvis contract is a machined copy.
Is it a convertible?? Chum chum with the hilarious idiotic comment.
First deal had some classic Chum Lee.
the first buyer sounded like kyles cousin from south park
I like how this show isn’t just about negotiation but also history.
Charles Lindbergh shouldn’t ever be considered a hero.  He was a nazi sympathizer.
22 mins. Dudes nuts
Boat guy talks like charlies handsy uncle from always sunny
10:40 10:45 This man was in the USMC, he is not a crybaby he is a fighter,OH AND this part 11:42, If you SMACK HIM your cooked😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The first guys look on his face when Rick said “ it’s like lipstick on a pig” is priceless 😂😂😂
Am I the only one thinking this title is clickbait.... they arent even that angry...
The Elvis signature isn’t real. It was an obvious copy. There are breaks in the ink. I’m watching this on YouTube and never seen it the episode. And yes I took one look and said absolutely a copy
Dude says what you smoking 🚬 bro looks like he just came from doing crack
“I’m disappointed I couldn’t make a deal. I would have liked to have made the money.”  Yeah, buddy, I also wish someone would offer me 100k for my $1,500 piece of junk.
2nd mortgage.... On a cardboard refrigerator box!
In this case, Rick is absolutely correct: The Gorget is made of nickel-silver, invented by Maillot and Chorier, around 1820. In the Anglosphere, we call it 'nickel-silver', because it's the nickel in the alloy that allows it to take a good polish. At one time, it was called German silver in the UK, probably due to discrimination of German products. ('Jerry-built' is another pejorative term).
I genuinely feel bad for the old lady, she required the money that why selling something close to her heart.
Help im stuck in a pawn stars binge watch
Best aviator is Rudel.
Wow that second kid. Sounds his father is a fool and that particular trait is genetic.
What do you have *a necklace worth 10k* sorry to burst your bubble but *what you have is $1,500* I'll give you 1k
For someone who thinks they're too weak to hold up a rifle, he's sure quick to throw around the words "puny" and "weak-assed." What an utter 🤡.
These people need to take these to auction not a pawn shop 😂😂
At least that lady who was the Elvis fan was nice about it, albeit disappointed.
I love when people think that they know better than an expert because they done a little research online 😂
Average wage in 1950  was about 3300$ for a family.  I was making 1.00$US per hour in 1968
These dudes just rip people off and call their friends to keep the facade.
as a kid I never understood why my uncle would watch this now I understnd
Even my 10 year old daughter could tell that Elvis contract was a copy, no expert needed
Rick is 100% right about boats being money pits. I would've offered $2000 at most
Yep boats are money pits!
It just like the guy who bought Jon Voights LeBaron.  Cannot deny the name but maybe authenticity
The second guy 😂 i can't stop laughing 😆  he crushed 🤣
17:10 😢
I don't understand why anyone would try to sell these items on a PAWN STORE TV SHOW. All they're doing is hurting their chances of getting a buyer more in line with their valuation estimates (or exposing their items as fakes/forgeries).
Boat price is good. $1500 in 1958 is $16,201 today
To the Batmoboat!
Charles Lindbergh was a Hilter-loving Nazi and an unapologetic racist. He'd fit in nicely in today's America.
Watching old, priviledged, arrogant men not get their way and throw hissy fits is my new favorite pastime. 😂
Kris has that "Put the lotion on, or you get the hose look"
The 1st guy came back w the cry baby guy only that time he  appraised a very rare Confederate pistol and for way more than he wanted..he was so cool and funny..
Guys, most of this is fake. The guys you see behind the counter are never there normally, it's all staged and scripted.
Alcock and Brown had the first transatlantic flight in 1919. About eight years before Lindbergh.
I want $10500.. $500 boat
It would never take that fat mans weight
Pawn shops are bad for the community all they do is rip people off
I get these are staged but in a realistic situation if you go in to sell something ask for their opinion then tell them you don’t agree with their opinion and refuse to sell it what’s the point in going in. In the first place
Let me go to a pawn show without getting something appraised away from the pawn shop.  Have their appraisal guy tell me my piece is a piece of hot dog Shize than get mad at them 😂😂.  Yeah let me not do any research at all.   Perfect!
😂 yeah you don't buy boats because you live in a desert
deluded chum has zero style especially in the newer episodes(delusional)
The bipolar episode of Pawn Stars.
That was a 55 chevy. NOT a 57.
18:43 shes thinking  ... now how am i supposed to get my house back after gambling it away lmaao
that gorget necklace looks like a reenactor's piece. there is a fairly large community of fur trade reenactors that try to recreate historic accessories using as many actual authentic pieces as possible. the beads look old enough to be authentic and then they could be attached to a more modern made gorget (there are traditional blacksmiths and silversmiths in this community too). even if the whole thing was completely authentic though, it wouldn't sell for 100k without some kind of documented proof that it belonged to someone of note from that time period. modern made pieces aged to look authentic are quite common and are often used or made by reenactors, but passing them off as authentic to sell is definitely not encouraged or supported. also there is a big market for native american items and unfortunately there is a lot of fraud as well.
9:40 1940's isn't turn of the century.
Second guy is the definition of Punk kid 😂
11:57 Thank you very much !!
The boat under bidenomics would be 100k now
the show would be so much better without the old man
I feel bad for the lady with EP contract, but it is what it is. You have to have live ink.
Fun fact: Charles Lindbergh was a Nazi supporter
The 2nd guy with the neckalce, he just made up that $100,000 evaluation based on absolutely nothing. That was a waste of everyone's time.
Jose Cornelio's
Boats are such a great investment. They float on water you know.
I thought the boat looked great. If I lost my mind and decided to get a boat, I might buy a boat like that. For less of course. But I hate water since probably half or everything that's ever died has died in water or involving water in some way.
The kid who was trying to sell the Gorget didn’t need a history lesson. He needed a lesson in manners and how to behave when in public.
The second guy was 100% an actor.
17:21 - _“What're those?”_  Well, they certainly aren't on His feet, that's for sure! 😮
I felt soo bad for the little lady with the elvis doc 😢
Joyce needs the extra money for more cigarettes
Never trust a pawn shop
Anyone else run out of Kitchen Nightmares to watch in 2024?
The first tip-off about the fake Elvis contract his the amount he was supposedly paid (appearance fee) is obviously waaay too high for that early in his career, particularly before his first hit song. Nobody would’ve been paid $2k (or near that amount) for any appearance that early in their career and I mean nobody.
History Channel
Elvis would be getting paid $2584.94
Several RUDE men... if Rick  doesnt know 💩 then why is his business SO $uccsesful ??
I know it’s a scripted show.. but pawn stars is really cool to watch..
The first guy was so wierd
17:21 a seriously insulting lowball offer  lol
How could you not tell that’s a copy?
Sidenote..Forest Gump taught Elvis to dance😉
100k for something worth 2kish..lol
3:03 Did that guy come in and talk to me like that he would have worn that lame @$$ necklage through his wormhole.
bro has a guy for everything
interesante
Super cool as someone who lives in Little Falls to see an episode that has to do with Charles Lindbergh
The second guy is a psychopath.
Soon as I hear Chum I turn the video off
Chumley must do all the comedy with dumb comments
Why is Shaggy mad
24:52 why doesn't his moustache fit his face?
I love watching pawn stars man 😎😎😎😎😎
The fact that Joyce (the Elvis contract lady) was lied to by her friend that she got the signed Elvis contract and she held onto it all these years hoping to get $10,000 for it, only to find it out it’s a paper copy and essentially worthless is definitely devastating. At least Rick felt some sympathy for her.
HOLY SMOKES I'VE BEEN TO DINKLESBHUL I WENT ON A TRIP TOUR ONE SUMMER WITH AN ORCHESTRA PROGRAM sorry i just really lost it when I heard that
That one of your father's was not a 57.
What the hell’s a gorget, classic old man
Wow I didn’t expect to see Shaggy in that second clip but man he really let himself go
Reminder: just because your items are not valuable, it doesnt mean you need to "smack" the expert.
In Australia pawn shops sell second hand stuff , not premium goods, Rick thinks he runs a high end store .
2:57 "This guy doesn't know sh*t" - Guy who doesn't know sh*t
Would of thrown out the second dude...
Omg! The Contract lady was so sweet and seeing her heart broken made me teary eyed as well. I hope she found her way out of the monetary trouble that she was in here.
Actually Lindbergh was not the first… Do some research.
The one guy told him what's up the guys made a poor evaluation lol for sure towards the end
drew the con guy
Good Job Rick
At 11:56; chum Lee's "thank you very much" was  funny, it made me laugh
Not equal rights to everyone just U S. Citizens for God sake you only have rights because they made it happen but today s kida would perish fo sure.
I don't know what he meant by smash either.
Erm i could tell straight away the Elvis was a copy 🤣
anyone know if the last guy ever proved himself right?
I felt so bad for the Elvis lady 😭
Chum is not funny and a tool
for the first guy the boat guy. there is an old Arabic wisdom that says(rough translation): "Ships desire what the winds do not desire"  what you desire and what the market desire may not be the same. so keep emotions out of it
The necklace one was just a kid who stole something from his dad lol what a punk
The boat guy was petty and a a hole
That boat guy is a dweeb
I like that guy. "Sometimes I'd like to smack him."
I hope that guy found the documentation for the briefcase.
You could tell the contract was a print and not a live signature. Why Rick wasted the experts time.
" I am fine keeping them or trading them with people that know what they are talking about."  That's a burn.
I am sad for the lady too.
I didn't know what he meant by "smash" either.
Took out a second mortgage, huh?
Some say the last guy is still researching to blow the whole wide world
Chum is so fking annoying
🎉
this guy always low ball you
pretty sure a real good condition halberd head would be worth at least 3k even tho halberd is like the AK of its era.
$100,000 for that necklace come on that guy was delusional up pawn pawnshop
Feel like the experts are in the pawn shop back pocket,all a bit to dodgy.
That boat was very cool 😎
I'm in need of your prayers and positive energy. Please keep me in your thoughts.
I know this is staged, but first of all, if you have anything that you think is valuable, never EVER take it to a pawn shop.  They are in the business of giving you as little as possible so they can make the most possible.
Pawn shop. You ain't gonna get retail or a collector price for anything.. people don't understand that at pawn shops.. list it yourself if you want full price. Or pay the auction fees yourself and auction it off 😂😂
Saw those rifles sold at auction for 900...
$1.200 in 1958 would be $13.000 now  Thanks Nixon.
Did Chum just ask if that boat was supersonic? 😂
The second guy literally has 2 brain cells. You can see him trying to compute
Maybe not take your items to a pawn shop......
Its all fake and all, if you ever visit their shop you will see for yourself... Still, at the sory base they create is funny to think of someone complaining about a paw shop lowballing stuff they want to sell when Pawshops are by their nature THE LOWEST BALLER of all buyers..
Here let me call my buddy who totally isnt going to undervalue your item for my benefit & a small commission.
The second guy is either stoned or supercreepy. If I was Rick I would call store security right away
That's a cute boat. Screw there con talking.
28:18 - lol the Katana in the back doesn't fit in the shelf 😂😂
Punk kid said, “he probably thinks I’m just some punk kid”
Why is the sky blue?
I’m sorry but the lady is short bus levels of dumb if she couldn’t tell that was a xerox copy… If anything, I bet the geyser copied it straight from the internet thinking she’d be able to pull one on Rick 😂
3:39 did anyone else here the vine boom?
Funny how they've been in the business for many years but they never know what things are worth.
Cry baby winy assed opinion 😂 coming from the one being a cry baby 😂
Second guy was some punk kid acting like some serial killer
that boat aint worth 10k not even 1k
Y would a friend tell u too take this piece of elcix history, it's worth lots of money here you go goodbye. Ps I'm full of it...
Mulțumesc.
Rick - anything that comes in I need to get it checked out.  Me - no u don't what the collector don't know won't hurt them
Forget all the flaws that make the boat worthless.
After the whole Wata games nonsense i don't believe any of the evaluators at all.
Elvis was a fake, phony and a fraud! People really should look into the history of a lot of these music artist.  What they portray is not who the really are. They stole a lot of music back then and he did this a lot!
How do you decide on the final cut for a video like this?
boring, thought it be blow outs. Plus this show was stagged apparently!! Still use to watch it all the time!!
This guy with spear is just greedy
I am sure that there is ample historical evidence that C.A. Lindbergh (the pilot's father ) NEVER owned a briefcase.
I found 6 of those boats on one site, not as rare as dude believed
That guy with those medieval deals he's arrogant and I hope those things are not real
I do feel sorry for that lady with the Elvis Presley contract because she did came out not being arrogant and I do feel sorry for her
That guy with that necklace that young guy he's just so arrogant
Lindbergh was not the first to fly across the Atlantic. The first transatlantic flight was 8 years before him lol
😂😂 5:19
15:58 Nah.. the "expert" just grabing the old paper page like that its so annoying jaja
The guy with the gorget is obviously mentally ill. Hiis movements and the way he stares are tell tale signs.
10:40 "that would be your crybaby whiny-assed opinion?" -A Whining Crybaby
Makers mark at the top near the flint lock and the owner didn't see that, and he's a collector?  He must've lived deep in the cave.
17:25     Man, that guy was a Total & Complete JackAss.   "Call The Expert ~ I Welcome It" Until he politely lays out the facts & all of a sudden his *Inner B🤬h* Came Out Screaming !!!
Lipstick on a pig
Swell
I felt really bad for that lady
By the time Gorgets looked like that they were not for blocking throat stabs but simply officer insignia.
The pole-axe guy came in with a really triggered looking rage in his eyes.
The Elvis contract lady seemed to be more upset about money. She's an Elvis fan, I would think that even a photocopy of the original should have pride of place framed on the wall of her living room.
"...he just thinks I'm some punk kid" ...well thanks for confirming that on camera to over 21 million people.
I truly can't believe how stupid Chumlee really is
Delusional people that probably paid too much…
the second guy is 100% a thief
Same people in the background every episode. So fakegeez.  Also, I think the briefcase is still pretty neat.
Old mate with the boat just mad he blew a ton of money on it and not even the pawn shop will buy it.
Rick got mad at the first guy
Rick got mad at the first guy
12:05 ... that's false... The Beetles hold that record. The show should stop getting info from Graceland.
Hate pawn stores. They know you are hard up for quick cash,and they take advantage,too much!
Ah, a Republican there at the end. Person who actually knows what he’s talking about gives his educated opinion, but guy who knows nothing "believes" he knows better. Just like anti-vaxxers, climate science deniers, LGBTQ+ haters, and everyone else who believe their barely-passing-high-school knowledge makes them more knowledgeable than actual scientists, doctors, and researchers who’ve spent decades actually studying and understanding the science. Your "opinion" is worthless unless you have the education to back it up.  Dude with the briefcase is simply delusional.
Love how she lies… terrible people
They should do a new show with the next generation of pawn family called Child Pawn
all the experts are such lowballers
I don't understand why they go to a pawn shop when they want to sell an item. Don't you use a pawn shop if you're in need for quick cash and you come back to buy back your item unless it's already sold?
Felt sad for the Elvis collector. 😢
man crying about the appraisal calls the calm guy a crybaby.
Actors
"Good luck finding one anywhere near that price on the internet"  Took me two seconds
How much you want? 100,000. I can't do that, Why not?  Because I think is worth alot less.  How much less?  99,000 less.  Wtf are you talking about. Classic.😂
Going to a pawn shop to sell an item is like going to a new car dealer to sell/trade in an old car. They’re gonna penny pinch you with a horrible deal everytime they can
Why does this guy always have such an enormous swing of the arm when he goes in to shake someone’s hand. Like every single time he spends a good second or two before actually making contact
Amazing how stupid people really are.
Facts don't care about your feelings
These people are pure crazy. if something is worth $1,000, I'm not going to pay $1,]00, $5,000 or $100,000 for it. They are delusional and I'm not losing money to make you happy
The expert are polite, some people don't want to listen the truth
has anybody ever had to be dragged out by security?
The young guy that was asking for 100k got paid to act that way and create drama
🇺🇲🇺🇸🇦🇺🇬🇧🏆🏅🎫🎟
Oh dear
Halbards? Tourist copies more like it.
Sorry, the Elvis contract isn't 'live ink'. It would be if Steve took a look at it.
You LAMES all got duped but the ELVIS scammer!
These are my favourites, more episodes like this please, we can relate to these and they have good life lessons.
“I’m selling my Pokémon card collection today. There’s nothing like it today. One of a kind. I’m looking to sell it for $2 million today. I can’t sell it for less than $1.5 million.”  Expert predictively: “this collection is unique but isn’t in good shape. In auctions this collection would sell for… 50 dollars.”  Rick: “okay I’ll offer you 5 dollars.”
Lipstick on a pig. L.o.l.
That poor sweet lady
I would have bought that Glastron Sea-Flite. Would look good behind a 1957-58 plymouth
2nd bell end literally looks like he’s a condom on his head for 3 weeks 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A lot of this is scripted just like Duck Dynasty was.
Como me gusta este programa  Historia, curiosidades, tratos insolitos....  Viva Chum lee!
10:43 🪞
2nd mortgage on their house? I hope that vague statement was actually new tires to move his trailer. Otherwise I would say that stupidity was hereditary and the kid definitely got all those genes.
"I think he thinks I'm some punk kid".  Well, yes, you are a young male wearing a punk tee-shirt and have a terrible attitude, that's exactly what you are lol
How can someone walk into a place, not know what they have, hear an expert, then either out right deny that opinion or ask literally the price they said, clearly not knowing anything about actually selling something to a pawn shop
First guy should understand basically no pawnshop anywhere wants to buy a boat. They’re just giant money pits
12:51  I wish society still had those values Now all the media does is promote degeneracy
i was just searching deltarune ost why did this pop up
Good bail on the boat. A new motor would be worth way more than the boat with an old junk motor.
I love how the 2nd guy just wanted to score some crack and was disappointed with the price of the necklace he stole
The guy with the briefcase is dense. Clearly there is documentation that the Lindbergh father used his initials all the time and that he wrote about selling his stuff to make money at the time when Lindbergh’s son was not around.  What else do you need?  Give it up.
Rick is an insult to the Gorget community! What a real choocho!
The second guy can always walk out and go to another pawn shop. No need to get all bitchy about it. Just like the stock market, buy low sell high.
The “expert” on the Elvis contract. He said “Elvis contract? I been looking forward to it “all day.” That’s how you know these ppl see aren’t just a phone call away lol!
Being a boater myself, I agree with Rick, boats don't sell anymore. In the 80s into the mid 90s, boats were a hot seller and now nobody wants them anymore mainly because the price of gas is really killing the boat industry.
"I've done my research" guy aged well
You can absolutely find medieval looking axes like that for $1500
I don't know where they try to be comedians they're not funny at all
Paint job on that boat - probably close to $5,000 Factory motor (IF he can find it) - UNKNOWN.  Plus, work on the current motor and also possible electric work.  That seller waa just way too attached to the frame.
His son shut not hang around,……
The museum doofus never can give a price. What’s his purpose?
It's hilarious when they act like they know more than the expert 😂
Harrison's "experts"...
Seller: I'm looking to sell this thing Rick: best I can do is an insult
the woman with the Elvis contract seems so sweet..I wish it was real 😢
I love that lady. She needs a go fund me come on guys
Ain’t no way that guy did my boy Craig like that smh
He didnt buy the boat because the seller corrected him 😂
Ya know, sometimes these morons are happy to have an expert come in, but when the experts give a lower value than they were expecting, or are told the items are fake, they think they know better and whine about it.
Craig is my absolute favorite because he sets ALLLLLL the ragebois off 🤣
wonder if the guy who says he would have liked to smack the appraiser, sometimes, was BANNED from the store and show after this. In fact, he suggested/MENTIONED, violence potential MORE THAN ONCE, too.
This is why I do not go to pawn shops.  I go to king shops! 👑
How dumb do grownup people have to be to EXPECT full retail when trying to sell something at a pawn shop????
Rick ain't the least not sorry for the lady he is thrilled he does not have to give her money he loves when he can keep it
this is worth 10 000 dollars. Rick...ok i offer 1200$
No one respects the experts when theyre given bad news
I'm good looking too. But worth $10,500?
I just wonder why these ppl act like this pawn shop is the only possible option… seek ppl who are looking for the collectible your selling, try different locations etc etc, some ppl act like it’s this place or no place..
I wonder if the Guy with the Lindbergh Briefcase ever came back..
Charles Lindbergh geezer wanted $ 85,000 for his briefcase...even if it had belonged to him it wouldn't be worth anywhere near that.. and most Brits like myself can't stand him for what he did prior to WW2 attacking us for trying to tell America exactly what would happen if they didn't support us and the rest of Europe in standing up to Hitler and the Nazis...
Felt so very sorry for the lady who had what she thought was a genuine Elvis contract...😢
We are cartel we got weight bra
I believe Rick to be a very fair person. He always tells him he’s gotta make some money on what they’re trying to sell him. It’s too bad they get upset, but Rick is a very fair, honest and enjoy the videos.😊
Zinc was first isolated by Andreas Sigismund Marggraf in 1746 Rick!
26:00 Lindbergh was a Nazi sympathizer. Even if it was his it'd be worthless.
Shaggy at 4:26 - lol no snacks for you or Scooby bruh!
Chum jokes with the German Club guy , guy completely ignores his joke and says “no this is where I got them” lmao 🤣 what a stern dude
As a retired superyacht captain, that paint job on the Glastron was absolutely awful. Looked like it had been painted on with a brick.
Second guy's dad took out a second mortgage to buy an antique lmao, what kind of stupidity is that
"Some people have Picassos, I have medieval battle axes" 😐
lipstick on a pig
When I come back its gonna cost a whole lot more. Freddy Krueger just entered the chat.
Lol. Poor Craig. (I feel like I have seen him in some other YouTube video.)
Rick is the cheapest person on earth
Come on now. You can tell right from the start that the Elvis contract was a photocopy.
10,500 for that boat was is worth it at the time, I seen one sold In Boston for 25,000.
"Can you find one!?"  My reply: "Why would you want to find one?" LOL
Glad to see him dealing with  a$$#0!es rather than being one.
Isn’t it funny when someone comes in, they always have fun facts on the items
Giving Drew's background, the Elvis lady should get it looked at again
People just need to be nice.
A boat!? Theyre in the desert right?
That Halberd guy is unstable. The more I have seen it the more I realize he needs help.
Why do people think if they haul something is of value and they go to the trouble of hauling it down to the store, Rick Has to buy it, at Their asking price?!
tell me something when they tell you they need to call someone to check out the item that the customer brings in. When calling the expert does the customer get to hear them talk to their expert or not? Because if not they might tell the expert not to tell the customer the real price so they pawn worker can buy it for a lower price. When they sell it for the right higher price they will give a percentage to the expert for the lie he told.
i have an old coin that is maked '' 3700bce'' and has a man on a horse on one side and a fast frigate ship on other side. it is prolly worth between $75,000 and 350,000
the metal on that gorget is so thin I doubt it would stop a mosquito
Watch this episode if you’re high lol the disappointments and change of price is very funny
Cracks me off when they start going off like a robot on history of item to customers
What I learned in life is to accept the bad news with courage and respect. The surprising news can be painful like cyanide but you must be mature to endure the truthful account of the end of the story.
Its the same paid actor!!
I felt really bad for the Elvis lady.  Kind of broke my heart a little.
1st dude has anger issues for sure
Shaggy over here needs to go back with Scooby and the gang instead of selling necklaces
I swear  someone could've written William Hart in crayon with a backwards "R" and this dumbass would have still thought it was authentic.
I felt bad for the lady with the Elvis contract
First guy that came with the necklace it seems to be totally scripted 🤣🤣
The boat guy 😂😂😂
BOAT stands for Bust Out Another Thousand
i payed £13 and got a tiny pot.  be careful
Best i can do is 12 dollars. Meatcanyon knows rick didnt even want to pay 3 digits for Jesus still nailed on a cross.
That first dude is such a pathetically insecure loser. 😂
That second dude is a pathetic excuse for a human being; you can just tell how much of a coward he is by the way he presents himself. What an absolute dumbass individual.
Good looking boat then why are you selling it.
Is it the original copy ? Looked like old paper and could have been the back copy of original which would make it worth something.
9:58  Wouldn't that be illegal for Ric to buy? He said he can't buy any that were made in the 1900s. His expert said it contains parts from the 1830s but was actually made around 1950
You need an expert to tell that was an Elvis copy?
'Who watches these scammers? Bring a piece of paper in and ask 100.000.000. They will offer you 50.000.000. Scammers. Also that annoying "I am about to scam you" laugh. Makes me puke
Funny part about this, I forgot Rick has a son lmao I can’t stand that dude. Thinks he’s so funny and then out of nowhere was a biker. Foh he’s a straight poser
My brother bought a wooden speed  boat  and trailer .. I think he paid 1500.00 for both  When he launched it , it propley sank . After he managed to pull it out of the water he realized the wood was rotten ..  On his way to get his money back, as he climbed a steep hill, the hitch let go and the boat and trailer went over embankment and smashed the boat and trailer  beyond repair .. He left the mess at the bottom of the ravine .. 😄
I believe that these appraisers low ball the values.  Either to get it themselves for cheaper or as part of a deal with the pawn shops.  I counted at least 3 incorrect statements in this video.
Curly maple is not made by lighting rope on fire around it. It is a natural feature of slow growing maple.
if u are a seller n want ur buyer to buy ur stuff n get good money  1st guy should not have try to disrespect him on his show
Thought the elvis signature looked printed or copied bless her
all these degenerates do is turn around and give the money to the casinos
My guy wanted $100,000 for that! 🤣🤣🤣
help the poor elvis lady
at 21:58 the way the dude just goes UH NO.
Boats are money pits. Rick speaks the truth.
How can it be one of the oldest companies in the world. We have bus shelters older than America in Britain
Is there anyone who has any lead about the first boat guy? I want to make him an offer
4:30 buff michael cera discount version... 😂😂😂
10:33 - LMFAO
I know it is all for the show, but I would never let a buyer use "a guy that they know" to appraise something I'm selling.
7:20 that’s not a modern screw
All contrived
Where do some people come up with these values...85k for briefcase...I can totally understand the value and contributions to what some people did in the past to contribute to future.. I just dont understand that if lindbergh owned a briefcase it should be worth 85k..Lindbergh is just another person.
I was shocked when I heard Adam passed from OD. 😢
I've seen COPS get less angry over the LIES being told to them!... the way these sellers act to the truth!
What da dog doin?
stupid commercials, NO ONE CARES, Youtube, and it is only hurting your company.
lol these customers are SO ignorant
lol is the Hudson Bay dude a stoner hahaha. DUUUUUUUDE......and I said and thought this BEFORE he mentioned smoking, not surprised he DID though hahaha
you might find a boat that old in the DUMP that is abandoned Detroit, those parts, lol. BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD/IN FIELDS hahaha
there were rebellious social movements in the 50's, lol, BEFORE the hippie revolution.
boat goes back to near Cary Grant's GOLDEN period, I think. 50's, not the 60's, is when America REALLY started to modernize.
came from a meatcanyon video.. yeah. his animation is on point KEKW
5:00 if it's really worth 100,000 dollars and you think you can get that money, then go get it. Stop being angry at someone who doesn't want to buy it for that price, go find someone who wants it for 100k. That's why you're some punk kid, it's because you don't know how to do business like an adult. You throw tantrums.
The second guy rick was just educating him. And he has a paddy
I could see that the Elvis signature was a copy from my tv.
dafdsfds
Some of the worst scripted acting I've ever seen lol
Rick always sighs before the seller has even mentioned a target price; it is already too expensive for rick and he cannot make a 'ton of money' from it.  Fortunately, he has many 'friends'/ buddies who dó know how to estimate the value of items. Rick better gets a job in an office or something.. "Daredevil" Rick😂😂
I think that Elvis Beamont TX show is the one attended by a young Buddy Holly, who showed up in one of the photos of Elvis and the crowd.
11:36 Appraisal Guy funny
The boat customer took stuff so out of context 😢
americans talking about european history.. really... are yall really that stupid?
I could never understand how people would go into a PAWN SHOP and expect to get retail value️
I'm not sure if Chum Lee puts on an act or really is that stupid... I lean toward the latter.
That is not halberd, it’s a poleaxe.  A halberd is MUCH bigger than that.
Why would you think a 250-300 year old bit of armour, not owned by anyone notable is worth $100k?!  Like where are you getting that from?!  You’d probably only get that for one of Henry VIII’s gorgets.
Daym they done the old lady dirty by telling her the value of the real Elvis signature and hers was fake
Chum looks really fit. A healthy individual.
I love getting hammerd I'm dru k af watching this shot I live it mam😊
who is this thick guy making weird comments? jimmy from gta 5?
at least no bedbug
Literally thought the same thing on the halbreds. Looks super flimsy.
The most iconic laugh on the history channel
I could tell a mile away that the Elvis contact was a photocopy.
The woman with the Elvis contract. Together with her husband are very well known cons and fakers.
Dude with the halberds prolly traded em off as fast as he could before the episode aired.
Customer: Well, it's worth 10.5 grand,,,,,,,,,Rick:  Would you take 300 dollars cash, and I'd be losing money at 300 bucks, it's gonna sit for a few years and take up space.
First guy omg what an attitude
He didn't like it because you told him something he didn't know about the fiberglass stupid people if you don't know you don't know
Hhhmmm
2nd dude was very calm considering his dad probably spent near hundred thousand to get that item thats probably why the kid thought it was worth that much. But i do think its worth more than just 1k. Like 2000 to 3000
The old woman story was sad
Rick look like he was on cocain when he said its like lipstick on a pig.
Elvis con artist
Hi I see your program on tv
"I'm selling my 1958 Glastron"  "Do you have any more information on it?"  "It was built in 1958 by a company called Glastron."  Well done.
Lipstick 💄 on a PIG 🐖 😂😂😂😂😂
Don't know why I end up spending hours watching these videos
Little lady was about to say shes screwed 😢
Pawn Stars: A show where 2 shop tellers call somebody else to value things for them
Someone send that lady an Elvis autograph! Poor thing..
"cant handle shooting a .45 percussion cap" lol
5:30 you are a punk kid
Feel so terrible for the one lady with the contact
In the first 2 seconds of seeing that Elvis contract I thought "that looks like a photocopy".
The camera literally zooms in and shows its not an original like 20x during the clip. lol.  Are people really this stupid?
If you have a high dollar collectible, WHY WOULD you take it to a pawn shop?
@3:20, no pawn shop has $100K 😂
@2:55 Usually if someone has a classic, the buyer would chase them down with an offer cause of how bad they want it. Chasing the buyer never works in your favor cause they don’t have a need for it
“Son you are way outta line.” Lmfao And Ricks face at 4:58
Last guy was kinda wholesome in a mental illness sort of way
i'd had to put that black & white Glastron behind that black & white '57 Chevy. but not for $10,500.
8:26 I didn’t know Ben Shapiro was an expert on antiques
Some people think they have the most valuable items earth..
Chumlee definitely is Chris from family guy
11:55 who's pig just got slaughtered 😭
LOL   @ angry sellers
lool second guy with that Gourgetm gtfo with this crap bro
Pawn brokers are the worst jokers. I never took anything to them. They will give you a penny on one dollar. Bunch of?
Chum cracks me the fk up. So many sellers just don't seem to like 'em.
Imagine owning a boat in a desert lol
Dingelberry  Lol
These pawn shop scam artist because they lowball the customer and resell it for a higher value
Just have to love all the people who think all of their junk is worth millions.
What is Austin Russell smooking? 😆 Man that guy is high as a kite!
I actually think that Craig is ALWAYS well under what people think they are worth??  Working for Pawn stars maybe? 😟
lipstick on a pig      lol  my x ...
william hart drilled also for gas and was gunsmith
El hombre de las esp Ada’s estaba un poquito molesto
As for Lindbergh’s briefcase -it was sold to pawn shop before the transatlantic flight (when Charles A Lindbergh was 24). Why would Charles have a briefcase when he was a pilot?
This is why you shouldn’t do crack…it’ll make you null & void 🤪🤪🤪🤪😂😂😂😂
It’s a cool boat but no way is anyone gonna pay 10 K for it in that condition…maybe with a flawless paint job and the original motor…
16:11 That's why I don't buy anything signed online. I get my signatures in person with a photo or video proof.
Props for pronouncing Beaumont right on the Elvis sig. I grew up there and can’t count the different ways I’ve heard it butchered.
"Is that your cry baby, whiney assed opinion...?" Seems to me it's not Rick whining.
The “57” Chevy you showed was either a 55 or 56…
The old mam reminds me ov my deceased stepfather and that brings bac fond memories 🆗✌🏻
Uhh.. it was pretty obvious from the start that the Elvis thing was a photocopy, right? I mean I saw it right away, I am not an expert and I did not need to see it up close with a magnifying glass. Like I said, it was obvious if you just take a glimpse at it. And since I don't think that Rick is that dumb, I am guessing they called in the expert for dramatic purposes?
It's hilarious when sellers get "insulted" when all you did was tell them WHY YOU don't want to but the item.  If you say you don't want the item they get insulted when you DON'T tell them why.  They get insulted about WHY you don't want the item.
Rick blatantly insulted the first guy that was his fault 😂😂
I stopped watch half way thought . To many adverts and far to long , most irritating !  ! ! !
That guy with the boat needs to take it elsewhere Im sure a buyer can be found.
28:38 "This did not belong to his father, and I will prove that and when I come back..." He did, in fact, not come back.
In defense of the kid: that's got to be tough to hear, that the thing your dad took out a second mortgage for is barely worth more than a new computer. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I'd say he was trying to salvage his price point and he just did a terrible job doing so.
TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE IGNORANTLY GULLIBLE AND EMBARRASSMENTS TO THIS COUNTRY!
There were absolutely no angry or disappointed sellers because the show is fake and all scenarios are scripted. Pathetic!!
They missed out on that boat, it was friggin awesome
😅 8:25"Oh my goodness gracious, is you again 😨"
if you have something that could be worth a LOT of money if genuine and you take it to a pawn shop you must have a pretty good idea it isn't
Idk why those ppl didn't get the 1000 sells they're idiots for that
The pole axe guy was soooooo full of himself.  Dinklesbuhl, Germany!  What an odd name.
5:55 darn this guy looks like James Cameron' double
that PUNK KID is a PUNK KID
Man, the hordes of people that score so far left to the median of the IQ curve that they think these shop owners really don't prepare and get the knowledge from the top of their dome about the most random objects is surreal. They probably believe that all these experts really live down the street too and coincidentally always have time when they need em'... everything about this is fake, and people are DUMB af.
23:00 Well of coarse you couldnt pay 1500.00 if you just found it rusted in the ground. Would be a fool to pay that much.
Elvis lady i wanted to cry for her n help her. Yhis is why if i get rich i wouod never stay rufh
2hen the 1st guy said can you even find one: i thought do I want to?
Felt so bad for the Elvis Contract seller, but even through this video, I can clearly see that the signatures are the same as the print ink. I really hope she found a solution to her finacial problem. 😢
You want to smack the appraiser guy because he didn't tell you what you wanted to hear? Wow, grow up!
anyone could tell that the elvis contract was not an original signature... except maybe the woman who brought it in. feels bad man
When the old man passed away it seemed that pawn Stars were never the same this episode is just a rerun rest in peace to the old man
Remember, you don't HAVE to sell it 😂
Either this show is scripted or people don't understand how pawn shops work.   Pawn shops are if you want quick money and don't have time to find a buyer.   You won't get what's its worth.   If an item is valued at 5k they won't give you 5k because they won't be able to make money off of it.  They will offer you sooo much less than what it's worth so they can make as much as possible.   If you want what it's worth then you need to take the time to find a buyer.
26:20 what’s Jack Black doing in the pawn shop, he no play video games
At 8:37 love the wtf roll the eyes look
If Rick didn’t want a boat why did he tell the guy to bring it down to the shop?
The briefcase was still pretty cool. The briefcase of the father of one of Americas heroes, and a former congressman at that
How was the lady in pink an angry customer? She was so nice
Yeah right if u thought that E. Presley contract was real u would for sure go to a pawn shop to try and sell it absolutly.
Briefcase dude is trippin trippin
3:30. Poor guy had a loser for a father. Card-carrying Trump supporters I'm sure😂😂
That Elvis expert. Didn’t know crap.   His first hit was that’s alright (mama). Which came out in 1954 so. Shush
The guy with the funky necklace was more of a serial killer than a seller..!!
Dude with the swords is a goof
4:54 zinc was isolated in 1746 but okay.
Craig got the eyes of the curse lizards from dark souls 3.
The sad thing is lots of these folks probably thought they were sitting on a nest egg.
Every time the "customers" don't laugh at ricks stupid jokes he low balls or does not make an offer
Sell the old man’s 57 Chevy a with that boat in tow.
Do they have to pay the experts every time they go down to the shop for appraisals?
Why you cut the film? It's he OK? I will not read the comments to know! Show all in YouTube!
17:10 I feel really sad for that lady
22:59 this guy is a professional appraiser wannabe 😂
4:21 I think if you swap this with drugs, the guy would definitely accept it
The cheap first guy with the boat, wants the repaired price.
😎 Rick you actually stole those cap and ball rifles
It's worth $600
😎 imagine that that's what replaced a Chris-Craft century the era of the Wooden Boat
You can tell a Mike away the Elvis contract was a zero print. Expert knew that in 2 seconds.
Rick i know is losing shyt shyt
"Cry baby whiny assed opinion" ? Wow he's like a toddler throwing a fit
Third guy went down gracefully
Should had took $1,000 and left man....
Funny how the seller, think it’s a easy sell, well then sell it yourself elsewhere
Hi my name is Rick and I can go with .50 cents, because i like the rapper guy and i'm taking the risk here, had to pay auction fees 20%
Those boats are everywhere.
this guy is not entirely honest and certainly no expert
I felt sooo bad for the Elvis lady, she's just a super fan and nice too.
"That would be your crybaby whiny assed opinion" said the man who cant hold a rifle up long to enough to aim it
The biggest crooks in the business make tons of money low balling customers. Why would anyone deal with them.
I'm pretty sure the first seller is Uncle Jack Kelly from "It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"
I understand the kid got mad especially since he was offered like 99 thousand less than what he wanted but that is no reason to talk to someone like that
Looked like a 55 chevy for the old man
I’m guessing the whole elvis …… let’s get a expert … lady in tears was just a act for tv 😏 as with most “reality” shows   The signature looked printed even here it’s pretty obvious
The black and white boat was maybe worth 15-18k, after a restoration of the paint and new motor, Rick would’ve never made his money back. Sad reality, but old boats aren’t like old cars. There value goes way down because it’s not classic, it’s just outdated.
Mariwwot hotil in dorsit 🇺🇸 flag
Love when he doesn't make a deal, the guy is a hyena
OMG! I'm a professional in something, that I didn't know. I sow rigth away, that the Elvis document was a copy. I was saying all the time. Why is a stupid copy so valible? Who more? 😂😂😂
"Medieval Pole Axe" they are called Halberds smh
😊
👍
"Son, I-- you're way outta line" 😂
Rick's right. The paint looks like it was applied with a roller.
Ha Ha, sounds like Chumley's been snorting fish tranquilizer again.
I want top dollar for my item let me take it to a pawn shop! Seriously what do these people expect
Hahahhaahahahahahaahahahhahaahhaha
Kruto vse)
Thats a 55 chevy not a 57 🤷‍♂️
Hudson's bay - indians?
Why don't any of the people in the video look at each other when they shake hands?
Yeah Rick, I'm sure boats are hard to sell. In Las Vegas. 🙄
It bugs me when these guys low ball the sellers off of what the experts say their product is worth. They aren’t saying what it’s worth fully restored, they are saying what it’s worth right now. You can upsell it. That is no reason to lowball the seller so much.
Chum was stoned out of his mind on that first one!!! hahahaha
That 2nd guy screams High school shooting.   What a dopey guy.
That "I know more than the expert" thing is what causes flatearthers, vaccine paranoids etc, it is all so clear :')
Toni Kroos 17:55
Total meth head! 3:23
I could tell that Elvis contract was a copy without the magnifying glasses (and I’m assuming they could, as well). Why put the sweet old lady through that?
That poor old lady no longer thinks her friend in the music industry is actually in the industry
These guys are con artists. They scam everyone they meet.
If they were worth buying they would buy them , it's all about money you don't let a good deal walk . That would be stupid .
In my opinion those relics from the old castle were from the XIII century, just before Leo came out with the Suns shirt. Now the Lindbergh files, is there any good chromecast left?! Crazy, that on a diplomatic level, there are that many differences of the same story. The truth doesn't always win, d'you know?! But the Warhol's posts were beautiful to see. Namastè.
7:22 um well it looks forged
Hey State Hospital North ... how much is a copy of an attempted bribery check worth (and then some)?
How's our old friend Detective Becky?
Rip to the old man. True legend. I loved his personality. "I want $100,000""It's worth a lot less""How much less?""$99,000 less"Read more.
For the guy with the halberds, if you find a rusty one in the ground that means it's free lmfao
ill never understand insulting the experts just for doing their job
Spoiler alert its been ten years and the guy about the limberg satch never came back because there is no proof
I find out that the halberd are seling for 1,500 to 2,000 on google search not that rare
I don't feel that the lady with the Elvis presley contract was mean or rude????
I knew a guy who made those rotating muskets his shop was 5 mins from here
5:30 thinks you’re some punk kid? Sir your forehead is a 6head, the hair is fully receding 👴
Sword guy saying...you're not gonna find. 😂  They weren't looking. You went to them.
If they're so valuable and so rare, why are you trying to sell them in a pawn shop that is going to give you the very bottom of the range of what they're worth? These people are morons or actors.
I wonder if anyone comes in with Elvis Presley codeine or morphine prescriptions signed by his doctor....
Second was def staged
omg chumley is the ugliest dude but he sure though he was the best looking funny when he is so not and then when they bring in junk and ask thousands of dollars and its not worth half or even at all people are so funny and some are clueless
2nd man was a like father like son situation 😂
In last season's episodes Cory look stoned AF it's kind of obvious he's all Chinese eyes I guess he has medical marijuana card more power to u
Boy some of them sellers are big babies
It’s always Craig who’s gotta deliver the bad news lmao
love the interaction between the old man with the rotating riffles and the expert its a nice relationship they have
That old lady 🥺  My heart is broken 💔
The sons voice is starting to sound increasingly like his dad hahah
The car he got his dad isn't a 57.
MArk hall patton is lotha🤣
so many delusional people thinking they owned a treasure
That punk kid deserved yo be thrown out
I kinda feel like the briefcase wouldn't be worth 85k even if it was unquestionably from Charles Lindbergh the pilot.
The past doesn't exist, forget about the past and focus on the future.
Its wild someone who likely doesn’t have a job thinks his necklace is worth $100k
Pawn shops are total ripoffs!!!
wtf are you talking about
Dang to find out you used your mortgage to buy something and later find out it’s worth $1500??? 💀
I hold here nothing you have ever seen  before.... Air
The guy that was selling the rifles was a little passive aggressive but I wouldn't consider his sale as a deal gone bad.
How drew know that it's fake? He uses magningly glass
I hope that the briefcase bro did find out it was Augustus’s briefcase
You a pawn shop.. seriously.. you have a show😂
Love all the cool things.. not buying
What’s is the point of this show?
When a mf that looks like he spared no expense building Jurassic Park tells you something about history you best believe it lmaooo
Why does he always sweet talk an item til a price drop? Or am I overlooking something??
Ngl thought I was on pornhub then pawn stars pops up whoops
With that boat deal if they had that car to match it and they're able to make a matching trailer and then if a car was able to pull that boat.. then you're looking at a cool package deal.
The guy with the fake medal didn't manage to make a deal, but this disappointment at least turned him into a very successful serial killer without any doubt
I could tell the guy with the boat would be a Ahole, trash of a human being
Second dude had serial killer vibes
second dude. better take the 1000 dollar rather than nothing. maybe only cost 10 dollar haha. where is that now? 😅
Oh man that lady with the Elvis Contract, I am SO devastated for her... 😢😢😢
Pawn stars are stupid!
Pawn stars are pigs with lipstick!
I can tell the lady selling the Elvis paper eats bavies
Let me call my William heart and rotating barrel guy
quá hay
“Thinks I’m some punk kid and wanted to lowball me”, well my man based on your reaction to his logical explanation about why it’s not worth what you want, id say he’s right……
A hundred grand? That kid is definitely the one who's smoking something and is about to buy more with that kind of money.
That second guy is a mass shooter type
For many "experts" there is nothing worse than a lost illusion.
does the old guy even know how to run a pawn shop anymore or does he just lean on the talent.
This is a family show so I understand them not willing to get into arguments with people, but it’s a good thing I don’t work there or get called as an expert. Because if someone was disrespecting me like some of these customers did, I’d snap back. I know what I’m talking about, don’t get pissy because you didn’t get the results you wanted. Just go put in a new tampon and get over it.
To this day the Lindbergh guy still hasn't come back
Chum going "thank you very much" in the elvis presley voice just was way under appreciated in my opinion lol
Xerox is the name of the company😂😂😂😂
That reproduction Italian Halberd is clearly a more modern replica. The tip is delaminated, it looks to be made from stamped sheet steel, the haft is made from very loose grained wood. Definitely a wall hanger.
These guys are absolutely con artists😂😂😂
One think I don’t like about the show is the CONSTANT low balls. 😊
5:28 "He thinks im some punk kid"  Dude , your like 30.
We come into this world with nothing, and we are sure to leave the same way. All you will take with you is all your choices in between and what you did to others.
Second mortgage on a house?? Probably lives in trailer 😂😅 1k
Current state of YouTube: Title: Insanely belligerent customer rages and blows up half a country Customer: Hey, np sir. I appreciate the offer and wish you the best in life. I love you 🫂
That 2nd kid looks like he's 22 years old and lives in his mom's basement...wants $100 k,   I'm pretty sure he's not an expert on gorgets
Never go to a pawn shop and let them tell you the price....HELLO...first thing they say is its a hard thing to sell....
The owner of the store has such an uncomfortable giggle every two seconds
Rik mayall trying to sell crap
The third guy encapsulates many men in general. It's fun to watch them get angry over nothing.
“Uh no! They’re worth a lot more than that” 😂😂😂😂😂
Looks like the Batmobile 🎉😊
It genuinely baffles me how people sell these rare collectibles for crackhead prices.. I mean come on.. so many of these items that come through that ship are incredible.. I couldnt see myself parting ways with them for something as common as money.. and a small amount of money at that!! 😳😳😳
Not calling the pawn stars out but it’s you know normal pawn, shops, and all that are around everyone if it wasn’t for crackheads pawnshops will not be in business. Now this pawnshop is different.
The woman, like, I feel bad for her. If anything I feel disappointed for her she shouldn't be on this list man
I feel so bad for that Elvis lady, She seemed so sweet and excited before getting the bad new 😢
The entitlement of some of these people geez
I don’t understand why people wouldn’t just sell their stuff online
11:56 11:57
It's always funny when they say "I'm asking $XX,XXX because this is one of a kind!" and it's like...dude...they're not paying you what YOU think it's worth, they're paying you based on what they can resell it for. Your rare Abraham Lincoln kidney stone isn't worth jack if they can't find someone willing to buy it.
Looks exactly like the 57 Chevy I bought my father …. Shows a 55
Do they ever know what a piece is about without calling in an expert?
Nobody likes Craig apparently
I’m puzzled why Rick puts up with Chumly. He’s stupid , insults Rick all the time . He and Corey glorify in their ignorance.
bro f these guys, they are the biggest scammers out there
That mid evil sword dude is a NPC FOR SURE
📢📢📢📢📢
✍️🕟
Wahid
I have a coin from 1912 how much does it cost?
Mum: OMG ive just gotten a letter from the bank, you took out a 2nd mortgage on our house!!! Dad: Yeah but look at this beautiful Gorget i bought with the money!. Mum: ....I want a divorce!.
I feel so bad for the old lady with the Elvis contract… she was such a good sport about it too!
The first guy just seems naturally angry
That guy with the Cesar coin is CRAZY..  When untreated mental issues and no discipline as a child collide, you get that guy
Craig at 19:55 in his Bavarian outfit :)
and that was the last time they seen him 😂😂
One thing I learned from being in business is can’t let emotions get in your way
Why not sell it but without saying it’s fake I mean anyone will buy it
This show is so fake
I really felt bad for the lady with the Elvis signature.
I get bored of Rick pretending like he knows everything about everything. Get over yourself! Yawn
Not their fault these people were scammed from auctions
I bet a lot of these people just try and pass off their fakes to other people and successfully scam them out of their money telling them that it's the real deal . You can tell the cry babies 😢
You can't smack him when it's your mistake for buying something that's fake 🤥
Expert: it’s worth a million Seller: I’ll take probably 700K Rick: I’ll give you 10 bucks
The second guy was tweaking for a fix.
4:57 Hahahaha!! 5:18 HAHAHAHA!!
Big dumb jarhead spear man... LMAO
my dad was a producer on this show and always said that the deals were pre planned, rehearsed, and 99% of the people on the show selling items were all great sports, some where put out to be the bad guys tho which is pretty funny. they’re acting but people think it’s reality
I feel bad that it's usually Craig who has to deal with the short-tempered ones. But perhaps it has to do with his area of expertise. There's a good couple of wackos who fetishize European history and they are generally unpleasant individuals.
Sad what happened to Drew. Seemed like a cool guy.
Poor military guy always getting the worst customers😂
cory is a real one for standing up for craig
At 23:30 you can hear what sounds like a baby.
Chumlee is such a nuisance. Hate when he's in bits.
Some bad acting in a few of these.
The problem is Rick isn’t a customer he’s a dealer , so getting insulted that he isn’t personally in love with your piece doesn’t work , they act like he’s buying it for himself. Sure maybe you can find someone so In love with your boat or necklace that they will pay top dollar but Rick can only pay the value of the raw material, sentimental value is for a customer not a dealer, how can you not know that .
That boat is worth at least 5k. It looked good. The bigger the boat, the bigger the problem. That was just an outboard. I know boats.
Spamton
They should have had a special or a follow-up episode that follows all the people who declined their offer and tried to sell it themselves and whether or not they got more or less money than offered from the Pawnstars. I always wonder how they made out.
That poor old women with the elvis contract,😢😢😢
these episodes are scripted and the outcomes are determined before they start filming. "reality" tv is fake.
That sensitive sook at the start 100% calls himself an alpha male
I looked up those gorgets and the average price is 1500$. Go peddle it somewhere else, you weenie.
*I would’ve been like, “I have Congressman Lindbergh’s briefcase. I don’t know much about him, but I do know that he served in Minnesota.”*
16:28 that poor woman :(
I can get u a parking lot full of old boats better than this one
14:30 Drew has been looking forward to it all day? So people who sell things have to wait around the pawn shop all day for experts to show up?
TCB⚡️
I can’t help but be bothered by the fact that that wasn’t a 57 Chevy that he said it was at the beginning of the video
The gorget guy can't accept his dad got duped. Rick's 1k offer is very generous after I looked at how much they are being sold online.
That lady with elvis contract just forged a copy and broight it to sell to pawn shop.
It looks phto copied
It's when the expert comes in after having a chat on the phone first, about how much it should cost. (After finding out what the seller wants for it). Undercutting. For a nice percentage of course. I'd sell it to the expert. 👍
Only 10,000 for a boat ? Holy .
This is quite entertaining
What is took out from this is that Justin Bieber is not a rockstar. He’s a popstar. Yes, Elvis was a popstar as well. Because the integrated both sometimes. But comparing Justin Bieber and Elvis is insanity. 😂
Honest  always was fare.)
The second guy looked like Buffalo Bill.
“F*** that guy. He thinks I’m just some punk kid.”  Uh you made it pretty obvious that’s what you are.
Oh
4:14-4:37  😂😮😂😂😂
I wonder if pawn shops have financial arrangements with their experts to give below market value appraisals to unwitting customers so the pawn dealer can offer way below what an item is worth.
I enjoy the series, educates one on how to spot scammer's and most of them are.
Lol that second guy is a goof.
@4:58 shaggy i much ruder than when i remember him on cartoon network as a child
i feel as if the seller in the first video was a bit biased towards his boat. either that, or he was desperate for that 10,500
A fact on Charles Lambert he was the first pilot to fly Non-Stop from New York to Paris when he crossed the Atlantic in 1927 he was the 67th to a cross the Atlantic by air just remember he was the first person to solo not to cross the Atlantic by here like I say 66 people before him had crossed the Atlantic by air
lol second JERK is DEF. a stoner hahaha
2:45 These boats are pretty common actually.   I can find about five or six for sale for under $1000 online in better shape than that guys Glastron.  This guy is a con man.
“Pull Axes” I swear, he a had a murderous look
😂4:58— 5:04 I’ve seen this video multiple times in the past, but it was this customer in particular who I remembered most. You don’t come into someone’s place of business and speak to them that way, especially when Rick knows a lot more about the item(s) you’re trying to sell him, or he’ll call in an expert if need be.
Yep the HB company traded with the American Indians... Traded them those infamous blankets... Infected with small pox...
Not interested???!!! It belonged to Lindburgh"s father, it has to be worth money!
i love the angry ones 😂
I dont know what youre smoking man! LMAO
The lady was sad felt bad for her
The boat guy should be in the next gta online dlc as a contact if they add a naval dlc.
My Great Uncle was Elvis's milkman.
That Lindbergh briefcase interests me.  Why would Lindbergh, the unknown at that point, emboss his name on the inside of his briefcase?  Was that customarily done then --  instead of a luggage tag or business card holder -- as a way to identify your belongings?
this is hilarious considering everyone in the store are extras and everything is planned before hand🤭 reality tv is a joke man
5:55 guy lowkey saying he aint a man🥲💀
“Probably thinks I’m some punk kid”  I literally swore at them 30 seconds ago
You're way outta line ha ha, R.i.p Old man
Second guy- “I think he just thinks I’m some punk kid…” Umm, you did act that way
Garbage of a boat. Only good for a reef
I still don’t understand why people go to a pawn shop expecting to get a price they want when they can get that price selling it to someone outside of a pawnshop
Chum being overly stupid.  !
x
Sometimes I like to smack him but that's just me
Pretty sure the 2nd guy was trying to get money for meth and thought he scored huge
Wow Spamton really set up a pawnshop after his sweepstakes
Some of these clowns have too much invested in these items and they can’t handle an honest expert opinion.
So many "I believe".
Very arrogant people especially that f a t kid of his.
my dad watches this show and hes told me some things about it. when someone comes in its just some seller on ebay or something who they contact to get on the show, and when they come in to the shop its not the actual shop but a stage shop somewhere nearby they use for filming. i asked him about the experts and we thought it was weird how the shop usually gets the same few people for any appraisal and basically say "this is good but so an so means its worthless" without a second opinion.
It can b a win/win for the person pawning. You get rid of an item that becomes clutter and don't use for cash, which is King. Stop complaining and keep the pawnshops a rolling and going.
No matter how much a person thinks they are cheated, i always give props to pawnshops.... why because at least they give you a variety of options for decent cash when times r a tad tough. A money mart or junkyard won't, and online is sketch, if u want more money but instead get jumped by thugs from online. So that's why, more pawnshops or similar business options.
100,000$ 😂
That sweet old Elvis lady deserves that 10k
They crossed the Ocean all the way to India just to make a trade with the Indians? They should've just scrapped it
Pawn shops will always offer you nothing for your stuff.  You can walk in with a brand new Bugatti and they will still offer you only $1500.  Pawn shops are for desperate people willing to give away their stuff
Would have been nice Rick gave her $500 off camera so she can go have a fun day on him in Vegas...the older woman who is in near- tears over the unoriginal Elvis piece.  She was all shook up.
10:39 what a total kcid deah
If it walks like a punk and talks like a punk.
yoooo L mans
Some people...
12:01 he said the Justin beibers of the world owe Elvis serious props, if that's the case, Elvis owes Black artist serious props. Since that's where the culture vulture Elvis stole his style, from a bunch of " Black  originators" ... 😂
The Elvis contract looked like a copy. It was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it. The entire thing looks like the same color ink.
I dont like seeing people lose but when you do don't be a sore loser. The ignorance of people is always amazing to me. Maybe the arrogance. Your already down if your in a pawn shop unless you have a good relationship with the shop and you can do the leg work to find items on your own.
hahah the first woman wasn't even crying
Anyone else instantly triggered every time Chum opens his mouth
Dude I've been to dinkelsbühl
Poor Craig lol
Craig is a very knowledgeable expert compared to some of the other appraisers
good content
Yikes
10:10 that was really disappointing, this guy had something cool and then they were fake, that's messed up
Asking $100,000 for that is next level stupidity
people have to be realistic here . if your item is garbage... well don't get mad.  you can't force them to buy your trash
Why would you bring a boat to a pawn shop lol. There's a ton of people out there with deep pockets who would buy that no problem.
for the last guy ill say one thing : its not uncommon to get stuff from your dad for good fortune ! might  have been the hand me down befor he got his own ...
Those ones that are painfully obvious it's scripted are hard to watch. I wish there was a skip button to the next clip within the compilation!
The Elvis contract looked like a copy to me straight off the bat.
That Elvis one was heartbreaking poor lady
Lindbergh was a Nazi loving white supremacist. Why you may ask? Because he stated the same
There's not many of us that know how to do a nice gel coat paint job correctly. I agree with the no-deal.
You can see the 3rd guy wanting to punch the dude in the face lmao
I would never pawn anything. Most pawn owners are slimy scam artists and their whole life is ripping people off when they are in need.
I could tell that Elvis contract was a repro right away…I still feel so bad for her 💸💸💸
That kids hair was absolutely horrendous
No it wasnt
Getting strong Frank Zappa vibes from the shotgun guy
Rick should have  ought the boat as a present for his dad to match the 57 car
Rick is a low life scammer
I would never ever sell to a pawn shop looking to get a good value. I only would go to one if I was broke looking for crack money
I didn't need a magnifying glass to tell that the Elvis contract was a copy.
Indigenous! not indian . get the correct term.
22:02 I literally just found the same one for $1,395 online 😂😂😂
You mean more like a 55 Chevy.
At least the experts are humble unlike some of these customers
It amazes me how a sucker never thinks they are a sucker just because they spent money on it
That poor old lady. That was just sad.
The old guy with those rifles needs to stop buying firearms. They show a previous episode where the pistol he brought in wasn’t legitimate. There’s a sucker born every minute, and this guy has ‘Sucker’ tattooed to his forehead.
Selling a boat in the dessert is funny af.
that second kids a moron lol
There was someone that lived around the corner from me that had a very similar looking boat, except cooler! This thing had built in headlights that like came out of the sides. It was a very cool boat.
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OVER ESTIMATING THE WORTH OF THESE OBJECTS
I feel bad for the women with the Elvis contract forgery poor darlin I hope she is ok.
I like how they get an appraisal for 10k and expect to get 10k out of it like bruh
At first I laughed that her Elvis contract was a copy but when I can see her disappointment and hardship I didn’t think it was funny anymore. I feel bad for her.
Little punk kid with his little punk necklace. lmao
I hate greedy morons who get something for a song, and think it's worth far more than an expert estimates. Just the selfish, egotistical, superior look on their faces makes me disgusted that such humans exist! 😎✌
The moment I saw Drew, I knew she was screwed
you could tell the first guy just wanted to sell the boat and get out lol
I'd buy the Elvis contract even if it is a copy of the original..
insert thing about spamton
Mike looks like he gets mad for a living
Americans seem to be very gullible sometimes. The experts Rick calls in are great, but Craig stands out.
somebody with a 57 chevy with a tow hitch NEEDS THAT BOAT
A second mortgage on the house…. So the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
On the Elvis Presley contract I was avail to see it way before the expert what a waste of time
The first guy was insulted from the beginning
Funny ...rick calls experts in but all of a sudden he is the expert then calls in experts ....lmao...called this show got called out fake like the rest of them ....soooo soooo fake
Legend has it that he never came back to prove it was Charles
Paints a big deal to a collector
Stoner dude: “I don’t know what he’s been smokin.”
Zinc was actually isolated in 1746.
That Elvis fan, I fall bad for the lady
Bro literally drove a whole boat to Pawn Shop, just to be wasted time of saying it looks cool, but no offer. Wtf ?
Poor lady
10:40
It's like lipstick on a pig 😂😂😂😂😂
In 1821, a gunsmith named William Hart drilled the first natural gas well outside Fredonia, New York, near Lake Erie. He dug down 27 feet. (Today’s wells go down more than 30,000 ft!) Hart is considered by many to be the “father of natural gas” in the United States. In 1858, he formed the Fredonia Gas Light Company, the nation’s first natural gas company.
First guy had zero humour and personality
The lady with the Elvis contract was so sweet-have never really felt sad watching an episode but that one was very sad-hope that lady is still alive and kicking-Rick you should hire that lady!
Man these customers are ignorant
Hi
Lmao @ the 2nd guy 😂😢
Imagine disagreeing with Mark
Poor Craig
Never would I tell a pawn shop owner/employee what I expect to get from an item. Too many are dishonest and I could be cheated. I'd let them make an offer first.
I could never understand how people would go into a PAWN SHOP and expect to get retail value🤦‍♂️🤣
You just stick that into him and yank him off
Chumlee is annoying asf
Shout out to B town Texas. Not to mention ZZTOP played the hotel Beaumont in Texas . I'm from the town. Love everything about it.
"I've been looking forward to this all day"  Really, I thought they just called you?
The question is "what has HE been smoking?" $100,000...
Elvis print could tell it was copied
Owner: I have garbage from my dumpster here Rick: How much do you want for it? Owner: 1 million
I had a cousin who was a civilian who worked at Fort Dix and processed his discharge papers.
Seller - "I came here to sell my one dollar bill"  Rick - "What have we got here? Oh wow. A one dollar bill."   Seller - "Yep."  Rick - "So the history of the one dollar bill...   10 minutes later.   Rick - "... and yeah. That's why we call it a buck. So how much are you looking for it?"  Seller - "Actually I was just hoping to get it exchanged for some change? Cents, quarter's, you know? I need it for the coffee machine down the street. So 100 cents."  Rick - "Okay.... wow. You know, I've seen better dollar bills".  Seller - "I don't think that's..."  Rick - "This one's kinda folded at the edges. There's a bit of fading on the print."  Seller - "It's a dollar bill."  Rick - "I've got a guy I'm gonna ask to come in and have a look at it so sit tight, and he'll be right down."  Expert - "WOW. A ONE DOLLAR BILL."   Rick - "Yeah. Haven't seen one of these in forever."  Expert - "Well you'd be right Rick. These things are rare. You see..."  10 minutes later  Expert - "And that's why basically everyone in going cashless right now. Contactless cards and electronic payment methods are pretty much here now so this thing is rare. BUT... given my assessment... this thing checks out. Its a bona-fide dollar bill."  Rick - "So how much do these things go for?"  Expert - "At seven eleven...... these things will easily grab you a dollar worth of products."  Seller - *smiles*  Expert leaves  Rick - "Okayyyy... so how much you looking for it?"  Seller - "Well I'd like to get 100 cents for it..."  Rick - "Hmmm. You know. This thing is gonna sit in my register..."  Seller - "It's just equal exchange rate I'm looking for"  Rick - "And you heard the guy, everything is basically going electronic at the moment. I mean I haven't seen one of these things in forever. I'd have to get it uncrumpled. Put up a sign to say we accept cash. And if I wanted to spend it myself, not many things these days are a dollar or less so, this is just..."  Seller looks on in dismay  Rick - "I'll give ya 73 cents for it?"
Rick offers lower than lowball on everything.
The signature expert was a fraud.
I read some where the lady with the fake Elvis item is a known scam artist in Las Vegas idk if it’s true
Love how the second guy thinks he's been treated like a punk kid, when he acts like one 😂
My ancestors had shares in the Hudson's Bay company back in the 1700's and they screwed him out of it 🇨🇦
"I strongly believe this belonged to THE Charles Lindbergh, and not his father, because it's worth a lot of money this way, and worth next to nothing if it's the father. Therefore. these facts tell me that it most certainly belonged to the good Charles, you know, the one that flew the planes about"
Gandalf cudnt smack a fly
How many times can you say 57 chevy in under 2 minutes. lol
I read an article about how all the deals are staged. So when the sellers get upset, aren't they just acting? lol
3:18 - He looks like 1975 Rick. 😁
They got a guy for avrything
Forgers watching these videos finding out how to make the perfect copies
Dude with the halberds goes to the Disneyland of halberds and pays top dollar.  Then brings them back to America thinking he will quadruple his money but can't even get a quarter of it back
Love the show waching this show from the Start big fan but Rick is a cheap mother..... Love to low ball people because they come so far he expects them to sprang they stuff don't even try to talk to this guy HE TAKES ALL reskb,🤑😡
sometimes I'd like to smack him but, THATS JUST MEAN 🤣
King of Rock and Roll🤔How and why!
Could they find someone more interesting to regurgitate fact he finds on the internet?
no 😄
I really enjoy this show but what I really like most is the dynamic among the three main players.  Their honesty on the show with how they relate and react with  each other is refreshing and very funny.   I don't understand why some of the customers get upset when they come in and don't get the money they want.  A pawn shop is not where you go to get top dollar for whatever it is they're trying to sell.  But sometimes Rick is very greedy with his offers.
Why are the pawn stars all so fat
"Zinc wasn't isolated until the 1800s" "What the f are you talking about" No seriously what is he talking about? 1746 was when Andreas Marggraf isolated zinc, and even then, that's only when Europe discovered it. India and China had already isolated it and had been using and exporting it for centuries prior. He said that as if zinc and things made of zinc didn't exist until it was discovered lol. Asking for $100,000 is kind of a stretch no doubt, but I'm glad he didn't take the deal for $1000 cause Rick was definitely pulling his leg.
The desperate folks of Vegas
The 3rd guy is definitely a actor seen him before on other programs with auctions on discovery & history channel as one of the main people coming by many times
Even with the swords. So staged.
I hate the way they stage these videos. Looks fake asf. Try to get better actors.
YOU were insulting him! You couldn’t find a buyer and tried to flip it at the pawn shop…  Cars and boat owners never understand why they can’t sell they’re money pits
Astonishing just how very ill informed and gullible most Americans are. Embarrassing to watch really? 👀😳
my thing has a name on it so its worth millions
Me: This is a baby hippo i captured in a river Africa. I named him Harold. Rick Harrison: For one thing were a pawn shop and we don't sell live animals, especially hippos and two were in the desert, where would you keep at, in a swiming pool? Get out now before we get animal control. Me: You seem a lot nice on TV. You are big jerk to me and little Harold.
This proves the show is real
Aw mannn, that lady with Elvis’ contract copy made me feel bad 😪
How is that these guys no so much about everything they get. When i go to a pawn shop to pawn something i never get a back story on what I'm trying to sell. 🤔
They bring in people, who they tell the price they want and to help sway the customer. Two shades of degeneracy.
adverts do my fekin head in
Someone puts a second mortgage on an item which is actually 1k😆☕️
The first guy was definitely on drugs and needed the money for his habit
How much you want for the rifle's?  How about 2k Expert: they are worth 1k Pawn stars: Will you take 3 bucks?
Dont you just love when people think they can get full cash value at a pawn shop lmaoooo
Rick should of said to the second guy, 'Yeah, I'm smoking my own salmon at home and they taste really good'..... 😂
The thing is, has he ever match anyone who asked for a selling price?
21:18 !! Accept it dude!! It’s not real !! Cut your loses and move on
I can just imagine how scratched that glass case is by now.  Throughout the years of people setting items down on it. I'm surprised it never shattered
Lily
23:48 am I insane or is that a H*itler stash 😂
Type writers also leave an imprint where it types.
Hello
The Elvis copy I could have told you from my couch!
Rick - “how much you want for the boat?”   Also Rick - “I’m not going to offer you anything.”
The Elvis lady looks different without the 1” ash cigarette hanging out of her mouth and not sitting in front of a penny slot. I bet she couldn’t wait to get her “prized possession” cashed out and get back to her machine or as I call them reverse ATM’s
I only watch this show for the "artifacts" that are brought in.  I don't take any of the "appraisals" or situations too seriously.  It's just entertaining filler for the day.
Lol why would you disagree with an expert? 🤣 He's the kind of guy that would think 2 + 2 isn't 4 but 22 because he "researched" it lol
After watching you buy Jesus Christ for 450 dollors i thought i would come and see what else you might buy :)
We need a "Where are they now" on these Yahoo's, except the Elvis lady, she's good in my book.
2 words RESTRAINING ORDER!!!!
That poor woman, seems like she was a pretty nice lady
Why would anyone sell to a pawn shop? The expert evaluations are cool, but you are never getting a deal there. There are so many options now...craigslist, facebook marketplace, eBay, etc.
Second guy looks like Oney and his name is even Kris
You’ve gotta feel for that poor lady, getting her hopes up for that Elvis contract only to find out it’s worth nothing.
Trying to understand why a boat would be a "money pit"? I understand repair wise. My first boat ride was my uncle's Glastron. Loved it & it handled great. Just classy.
Ive been collecting sports autographs and memorable for years an no way would i trust anything that Drew says. His company AAU is a joke. Hes very hated in the autograph community
It fake😂 they are actor
Imagine getting angry enough that you want to smack an appraiser
I enjoy watching your show
It is a good looking boat.  I wouldn't pay ten grand for it, but I'd negotiate.
11:42 "sometimes I'd like to smack him but that's just me..." hahahahaha
I felt so bad for the Elvis lady.  In her mind She literally went from around 12,000 to nothing in a matter of seconds “This checks out, this checks out…wait a minute”
Charles Lindbergh is my grand daddy he was a dushbag according to my mom
Everything scripted. Nothing real.
Man with the long swords was absolutely pst. And I wonder if expert Mark has a offshoot program of his own like Danny the car man.
lmao.the paint job is horrible. the boat
I will never understand why these people think a pawnshop will give you top dollar lol
U can't go in a pawn shop and catch an attitude when u don't make the sale with someone else's  money.
That boat is cool but man it’s in terrible shape. The only person buying this is someone that likes boats and has a matching 50’s Chevy. I hate when sellers say “go find one” dude they don’t care to find one they just want to make money.
Alcock and Brown were the first people to fly across the Atlantic.
Halbred dude has been on the show 14 time trying to pass crap he bought thinking it was real
4th guy was a punk as well very narcissistic
FAKE
It seems that this show ALWAYS has an expert on ANYTHING. Like who tf knows about the product like they themselves made it?😂
5:24 well he definitely wanted to lowball you he lowballs everyone he is a “pawn star” after all..
ELVIS didn't  invent rock N ROLL?  STRIKE 1 RICK  STRIKE  1 DON'T BE A  LIER
Punk kid? That guys like 38 living in his moms basement
I like how they have the Elvis signature clip & then in the next clip, we can see a picture of Elvis in the background
idk why that second dude made me cry laughing. When Rick was literally giving a chemistry lesson and bro was still thinking about how his stones are worth 1k not 100k.
Wtf are you talking about guy looks like he’s bin smoking something lol 😆 what are you smoking man
1:00 That's not a 57 Chevy...
Do the pawn stars' ever lose? I ask as someone who never watches the show
Chumlee is talking about boats,,, doubt he could even swim.
Wow, the Dunning-Kruger is strong in these ones......
Man Craig is tough on that specific guy lol.
On a boat you only want an engine you can rely on. Paint job hard to tell from her. E. He is right about boats being money pits
Did that man really say free-dony-a
No absolutely not lol guy with spears
Second guy is a silly thief meth addict
Legend has it that they're all still doing research.
wants 100k for a fake item . ya rite! im surprised Rick didnt start laughing. i hope he kept his receipt for a return. but wait , most places take returns without a receipt for $1  items
Tbh I agree with the first guy
I the second guy has a face you wanna punch
Don't buy a boat, money 💸 pit? 🙄
I mean, Charles Lindbergh's dad, so it is still kinda cool imo. Obviously not worth what he was asking, but pretty cool.
the ar-15 fact at 5:50 seems kinda... irrelevant? lmao
Rick is a moron sometimes.. he always calls an expert to come check out the items to get a true value and history of the items.. so why did he turn down the Indian jewelry? Backwards
It's always hilarious when they bring Nevel Papperman in for appraisals.
I loved chumlee in this one thank you cumblee llol chumee
18:35 i love your face chumlee lol thank you chumlee lol
Chumlee is so cool thank you chumlee thank you
"you couldnt but these for $1500 if you found it in the ground rusted"........no sh!t....if you found it in the ground why would u drop money in the dirt🤔
"You can't even find these." Did you forget you brought this to someone who didn't ask for it?
"Thats your crybaby opinion"   ironically said by the guy who is angry that he wasn't told what he wanted to hear
Second guy is a piece of garbage. I feel bad for Craig too cuz he got all the really angry sellers. Sean and Alex have had it easy lol
I like how Craig keeps his hand on the halberds so the guy doesn't hit him with one.
Is it just me or is big Haus the coolest dude on earth?
This is Insulting & unpleasant viewing, with these adverts every 3 minutes!! Haven't you made enough freaking money ???
The first guy was pretty reasonable, I'd be upset too if I was trying to do business with someone and their retarded soon kept interrupting.
"find me another" dude nobody cares about that style in the first place
The amount of people who basically said “I disagree because my ego”. 🤯
Lindbergh wasn't the first man to flight over atlantic. There were two british pilot than flied to Terranova from Ireland a few years before. Lindbergh was the first man to fly to the continental europe (New York to Paris).
how many people have been told something is fake when it’s real
Lindbergh was neither the first guy to fly across the Atlantic, nor was he the first one who did a non-stop crossing. Those achievements were made 8 years before his flight. He was the first one who did it solo.
um
I'm the best
I feel so bad for the old lady :(
I remember I used to watch this every week  back in the day is this show still going or are these all re runs ?
Corey really has learned his dad's [Rick] customer relations. He's just as tough when it comes to lowering the sellers price.
B O A T stands for: Bust Out Another Thousand
Idk why, but I feel like the old man should dye his hair that shade of light purple like many of the old ladies do! 💜
Antoine is my hero
The second guy wasn’t that much of an angry customer, it was clear he was messing around considering she smiled and made the other laugh. He also agreed with Rick on the price instead of arguing.
I could tell that Elvis contract was a copy after 2 seconds of seeing it. Surely Rick did too? Dumbass show.
You can tell when they're actors
Hey, Dinkelsbühl is not far from my home ✌️
The guy in the second deal looks like Dean ambrose
2nd guy acting like a hot shot. If you are going to request 6 figures at least have it appraised first
You don't argue with the man with the hat
That contract is not working because he originally started signing all of his contracts in the beginning with his full name Elvis Aaron Presley
poor lady had that money already spent in her head
I think chumlee looks even more moronic trying to act smart this season. Just take away his drugs.
These guys are all such crooks, I wouldn't trust any of them as far as I could throw them.
It's surprising pawn shops even exist anymore. Something about selling your stuff at a pawn shop feels degrading (bc the reputation they have) so most people won't even bother now a days.
i live 15min from Fredonia thats insane!
"thinks I'm some punk kid" cuz you are
What surprises me more than anything in the video is the people in the comments that believe every. single. interaction. on this show is staged and rehearsed.
I could tell that contract was a copy a mile away
The second guy was so mad he couldn’t go buy all the meth he wanted 😂😂😂😂😂
This is so fake and played. People believe this is real ?
8:25 I'm not siding with the old man but that expert actually has a pretty annoying character. He should remember that the only reason the shop calls him is to evaluate on the product that he is an expert in regardless of how the customer reacts he should remain professional and stick to his job and not make any other comments. But yeah, that old man is just a typical old man with his old aged braincells. Hope he sees this video and laughs at himself lol
Reminds me of Trump voters who believe the made up reality in their minds over obvious facts
I've seen older pikes in a Dungeon n Dragons theme park.🤣
So many Chancers in Vegas! Surprising really! 🤣🤣🤣
I cud see the Elvis contract was a copy immediately on my phone! Obvs.Poor woman.😢
5:18 honestly how they should all react when the guys try to negotiate
“Best I can do is…”
How is it possible that Rick looks at his shoes 100% of the time when he shakes a man’s hand? He has never once looked a man in the eye when he shakes. That’s not how deals get done.
I truly Believe a Lot of these people who come into this Shop take a nice hit or yank or whatever of some 1980’s Crack 👍🏻😆
Charles Lindbergh was not the first person to fly across the Atlantic
Second guy look like he killed for that
love to see these people get busted for trying to sell their junk
17:53 nathan fillion plus woody harrelson?
Had to giggle how the dude said Fredonia, NY. People in WNY say it different
25:45 Nice Hitler stache
I almost feel bad for the last guy, he’s totally confident based on flimsy evidence
The boat guy had a big chip on his shoulder and Rick noticed that. Take your boat and shove off!
someone start a gofundme for elvis lady 😭
The third guy wasn’t unreasonable at all and they actually made a deal 😂
Shocker… 5 people with no clue how a resell business works. 🙄
i felt so sad for the lady
“my pa risked his life for this!” “i’d give you $1000”
Re: Elvis I could tell it was a photocopy from the first shot, it was super obvious
"I found this hammer in my basement, and here you can see someone wrote "this was used to crucify Jesus" in sharpie on it, so I'm asking for $200,000."
Somebody tell the old lady that contract isn't worthless I mean it isn't worth anything substantial but I've seen copies of autographs from bands like type o negative go for 20-50  bucks on eBay so to the right buyer she may get 20 to 30 on it it's not much but hey not worthless
The Pawn Stars - GameStop Edition
The guy with the halberds just felt horrible because he did probably pay an absurd amount of money, lmao.
Curb your expectations
that second guy 100% stole that necklace from his father
We wsese we  W
The second guy stole our lines 😂 'idk what you are smoking man'
Crazy how ppl can be faced with rock solid evidence and still call the experts liars. Makes u realize why some people still think the world is flat 🤔
Honestly it’s a pawn shop, you’re not going to get top dollar for your item (no matter how amazing it is!)
It absolutely baffles me when people take stuff into a Pawnshop & they expect to get the highest amount for it like the Pawnshop isn’t there to make money. It’s like “go ahead and take it somewhere else if you think you can get more $ for your item but don’t have to be rude bc someone won’t over pay for your stuff.
I love when they say I will find someone who appreciates the real value, like is there just a group of guys out there buying and selling way over price while the rest know what they are worth? 😂
The guy that cussed at Rick deserved what he got. Why disrespect thanos uh I mean Rick 🌚
The last guy… “I am going to prove it and it’s going to cost a whole lot more”. I am like… yes, we will be here to watch it. 🤣😂
I wouldn’t make a deal with some who talked to me like that either, maybe your mothers OK with it but it’s not OK with society
Boat looks more like a 1958 Chrysler product. And that's a '56 Chevy, not a '57.
If the Pawn Shop doesn't have the money for it then don't sell it.
10:00 it looks like a kid did that marking lmao
Grandma gonna have to eat dog food until she dies.  At least that will be soon.
those people touching these things, like old coins, jewelry, etc... with their bare hands tickles me lol
"Great! I welcome an expert. Cause were about to make a deal!" "Son  of a .........."
Paint ain't Petty Dude! That's $10 to $15 thousand. And that paint is Horrific! Look like a roller job.
.. is Chum really a moron, or does he just act like that for the camera???
I'm curious what the lady did back in the day to get that contract from her "friend".
Till this day he never showed up he was too busy smoking crack
The sheer arrogance of some of these sellers make my toes curl
Elvis payed 50% to his agent
I don't blame the boat guy it was a pretty unique boat plus it's probably annoying having to tow that thing home.
Ah do nut like doze gy-rations
I can track my family tree back to Elvis Presley
Elvis I'd pay 100 for it
brb im crying over the woman w the fake elvis signature, she was just so sad, instead of most of the other people in these videos being mad at the appraisers she was just upset :(
ok now wtf? that elvis contract was an obvious copy. the moment i saw it i was like the colors are all the same and the words are not pressed in. how couldn't they see this? and the expert needed to check with his magnifier. i guess they were just trying to make some content for show here
This was the beginning of the WWE “reality” shows on History Channel
WHY would someone leave that briefcase and not take it with them...
Did he come back to cost a whole lot more?
With regards to that gorget, Rick had no idea what he was talking about. Zinc was not isolated in the 1800's. In Europe the first process for isolating metallic zinc is from the early to mid 1700's but in India they isolated it in the 14th century. From the 17th century on, zinc was imported in Europe from Asia. So I see two possible scenarios here: - they were trying to hustle the kid; - the so-called "sale" was fake and scripted.
That "57 chevy" is a 55 Bel Air... And your facts are right, 100%, as per the things you say on the show?...
The boat guy dodge a bullet.
Dudes like 35 and calls himself a kid...
Ed
The way the Elvis segment ended was ssooo sad...😕😕
Y’all realize that these are all staged right?
If they check that lady out from the Elvis Presley contract she probably has a suitcase full of them she goes to every pawn's shop in town around the country she played innocent like she never would imagine that could happen😏
Bro some ppl walk in there with ridiculous offer amounts.
The Halberds are definitely worth more than 1500 USD on the open market, but likely not 15.000 either. I'd say about 2k for the Victorian and 3.5 to 5k for the authentic Austrian.
Craig is a consummate professional, no matter the insult he’ll look the seller in  the eye, give ’em a handshake and say “have a great day”
The son is on something and boat man can’t even be bothered to look at him.
All the conversations basically went like this.  "I want X for my item"  "Okay, I'm going to ask for an expert opinion"   "Great, that's what I want"  *Get's a detailed, expert opinion not in their favor*  "Well I disagree because I said so "
I loved the halberds dude reaction.  "I collect these so I know everything about them."  Expert:  "That's cute."
How dare this expert tell me, some random jagoff, that my item is not worth what I assumed it was!
Punk kid says he’s treated like a punk kid, proceeds to act like a grown as punk kid lol
I love how these people whine about the offers.
You could sell that better you can sell most of the stuff easily for 100,000 maybe two hundred thousand maybe even a million$ remember pawn shops can and will scam you so be careful these guys could absolutely scamming you out of your money and whatever possessions you are trying to sell and I'm talking about the pawnshop guys too they're no better they are a Pawn of something and you are there Pawn you are there to make them money and they're there to cheat you off of your money and don't be saying how well they say they're professional every scammer say they're professional so don't take don't take their word for it because  1000% all the time it's just a bunch scams
Some of these people are freaks
Anyone with good eyes could easily tell the Elvis contract was just a copy. They just wanted to make it interesting
Love Craig
bro they mad funny
The upstate NYer in me is screaming at when he said FREEdonia
The guy with the rifles : dude ,they are made with recycled parts. You don't have vintage heirlooms so f*** your attitude
Excellent
This boat looks exactly the car i bought the old man.......Buying Time: Terrible Paint job
Some of these people are delusional. Especially the last guy.
16:15 OMG; I could Tell From my Home that Elvis Contract was FAKE LOLOLOLO😛I guess Thrift Store Collecting/Dealing Pays OFF👍
reallllly 2:41
23:12 seems like the guy with the haliberds has actually studied something, but what was it he studied?
#2 was quite the businessman, could sell a boat to a fish
I was at your shop  Few days ago and I find out the truth I find out that you only publishing Publicity on YouTube nothing is real it’s like a movie it’s good to know those places but I don’t recommend it if you try to find a true call them  before you go there Remember this not Everything because the bright means it’s good or gold
Why even waste time selling something for 75% of its value to these guys just so that they can make money.  lol list it online and sell it for what they would
The Lindbergh brief case is pretty cool. I think I would be more upset that it was only one generation away from being worth a lot lol
Do you think those reactions are staged?
I think that 2nd guys parents are kicking him out of their basement and now he took his dad's stuff to get the money to move😂😂😂
Karen's 😆😆
The first guy was pretty calm lol
I’m going to vegas in a year
🤣a punk kid?🤣🤣 I bet he’s leaving in mamas basement!!!!
charles a limburgh and elvis lady were great sports about it, the boat man was not. cocky vs thoughtful. feel bad for both the elvis lady and charles limburgh man
Pawn Stars is a fake show I hope you all know
Punk kid describes himself as he is
I want 85 thousand dollars   🥴
not all that angry lol
The salesman's assistant is not exactly the sharpest knife in the box.
Been waiting to c this contract all day... thought rick just gave him a call... be right back... hmmmm
The Lindburg briefcase... this guy thinks a teenage Lindburg had a briefcase embossed in his name and sold it to a pawn shop? Come on, of course it belonged to the father.
That lady was crying with no tears lol
Lindbergh wasn't the first, nor the second, not even third across the Atlantic. See BBC programme Q.I. with Stephen Fry.
He was basically insulating me.... By telling the truth. Wtf
If you can't tell that Elvis contract is a copy right away. You have to be blind.
This tv show is not a reality show this is scripted so just don’t go there just to sell something, for sure you will just  regret it. There is no Chumlee, no Ric, no Corey and no experts appraisers to look for your item. This is a jewelry and watch store and not interested in buying stuff. The people who works there don’t have any knowledge about history and don’t even have a common sense. It is totally different from what we see on tv.
I think I have never seen Mark saying its original or genuine.... Lol
All of these people are just ignorant
Charles Lindbergh was a Nazi and a trader to his country.
Rick is smart, he always ask what people are asking for whatever they are selling their items for and then ask them if they don't mind if he has a friend, " expert " to look at them or it and usually price what ever it is under what the customer is ask. Seems a little fishy to me.
The time I saw Elvis Presley signed contract I already knew it was photocopied by xerox machine 😆
Rick is such a complete AHOLE..
🤣🤣😂😂😂😜 Chum !
Comment deleted
Why does Rick have such wimpy handshakes?
Forgot We Have Sensitive Vaginas In This World Now
The guy with the boat was a real piece of work. He literally didn't make you an offer, it wasn't like he was trying to hustle you pal, he was trying to tell you the reality of your situation.
The Pole axe guy kinda looks like a discount Woody Harrelson
5:26 He is a punk kid!!! Literally, just look at him, when was the last time he looked in the mirror???
lindberg wasnt the first one who crossed the atlantic by air, there where about 80 people before two in a plane and a few dozent in an Airship/zeppelin
16.59 - If u're going to wipe away fake tears, make sure there's fake tears to wipe away. Those eyes were as dry as the ink on the photo copied Elvis contract. She was full of it from the start. When asked where she got it - "a friend in the music......industry". Her friend said "I think it's worth something but you'll have to get it checked out". If u're in the music industry & are given an authentic Elvis Presley contract, u KNOW it's worth a fortune. (Setting her "friend" up if they call in an expert who disputes its authenticity). When Rick asks if she'd seen Elvis play live she said yes - "he looked fantastic" - & nothing else. But she shook her head "no". She's a scammer & got caught.
lol that dude with the brief case with that double digit iq looking like simple jack
Studebaker boat that’s lit
RE.:  the Elvis contract.  How come as soon as I laid eyes on it, it looked like a copy to me?  It didn't even look like a GOOD copy...almost like it was a copy of a copy.  I don't know why Rick even bothered to call in an expert.
That was an expensive loop the Elvis document expert had.
it’s like Lipstick on a pig 🤣🤣!
The young guy acting like he wasn't going bald at 19 was definitely a punk kid who was just trying to get low balled.
Break Out Another Thousand
The Elvis lady broke my heart
“What do you wanna do with it?”  Nothing man I just want you to look at it -_-
Lipstick on a pig...hahahahahaha
In 1955 there were no copy machines. A carbon copy would be all shadowed throughout the paper. That "expert" was full of it.
If I were them, I'd give the lady the 10,000 dollars anyways. She needed it

'"Son, you're way out of line" translates to "Boy if this were my time you'd have just bought yourself a ticket to the hospital'
-The guy at the very end with the Lindbergh 💼briefcase was just plain butt hurt. He said when he fines out that it Really IS Charles Lindbergh & Not C.A.Lindbergh It Will cost the Pawn shop A WHOLE LOT MORE.I was in stitches laughing at that line. Well i got news for that guy.#1-He won't be able to prove it belongs to Charles. #2-He knows he can't prove it and just said that for the camera to keep from being made a fool of and to save face Plus he  was just so butt hurt that it was eating at his very sole.#3 He will be to embarrassed to ever show his face on camera at that Pawn shop again.😂
I cant stand these stubborn old people who find out their items are not authentic or not what they thought they were, and when the value drops… “I KNOW ITS REAL! I DONT CARE WHAT YOUR EXPERT SAYS!” Like shut up, and you cant just stubborn something into authenticity!
I don't understand people.. if you think an offer is ridiculously low or they don't want to buy it,  or they think it's a fake.. why get mad?  Just go elsewhere.. or get a 2nd opinion. They're not obligated to pay you jack.
The Old Man was my favorite. R. I.P and thanks for your service.
Why are these people so honest when they’re trying to sell their stuff??
that  boat was fake asf lmao i think we just saw Rick get out of a scam haahah
Is it convertible lmao Chumlee
4:19 This guy is a value guesser lol why would necklaces (also old ones) be high in value. Just because its old doesn’t make the value high.   click like if u agree
How about gloves mr.autogrsph guy
It's still around .lol u may call it Canada lol
I work in a geology museum and I've had people come in to get rocks, minerals, and fossils identified and sometimes they have an idea of what they think that they have is. And when what I tell them it is based on my experience and knowledge doesn't match what they think it is, sometimes they get very upset. You got an expert opinion. They know more than you. Listen to them.
So salty that their broke!
A common theme seems to be the sellers want top end of retail for their item. But pawnshops will only ever give you lowest end of wholesale.
democrats that hate facts
Felt bad for old lady
Her friend gave her an Elvis contract First clue it’s not original
Whenever a customer says, "I believe it's worth" you know they're full of crap.
People have to realize your going to a pawn shop cut what you know it's worth in half maybe you'll get 60% they sell it for what's it's worth and probably only get 70 to 80% what they want so 🤷
He said my next project is a big fun then says you can’t find another like that in the same breath
I think if the halberd guy gave Craig a chance they could be great friends
Imagine walking into a bakery shop , checking out a piece of bread and then asking the baker what he wants to do with the bread.
You will never get top dollar at a pawn shop.  You go to pawn shops when you're in a pinch and need some quick cash. Idk why people get mad when pawn shops lowball, that's literally what they are supposed to do lol
What's most annoying of this show, is the laugh  from "Rick". Bottom Line, that "business" i operated with the idea of screwing people out of their goods, when they're desperate for money. "Hah-ha-ha-ha".(me): Ive got, the actual flag that "Betsy Ross" made! (Rick) wellll, the stitching is old! Plus, it isn't exactly, professionally sewn! Hahahaha, I'll give you 5 BUCKS!
It's not always the matter of you can't find one but, are people willing to find one 😂  It can be the rarest thing in the planet but if no one wants it, then it's bad business...
I started watching these, still don't know why, and have been watching them for about a year now. I don't like any of the guys at the pawn shop, none of them really seem to have any idea about the things that come in the shop, it is obvious that everything they say about each object is scripted, and they absolutely low ball a lot of people. But I think I watch this because I like the experts, and love hearing what they have to say. It is always interesting.
The second guy says he's not a punk kid...That rats nest on top of his head says otherwise.
That frat boy for sure should have been hit up side the head for disrespecting the old man...smh
WTF Just one of those trade beads are worth about a grand. That a boy Rick  It's all about  Money Money Money Money
Once, just once I want to see Antoine drag one of these entitled pukes out of the pawn shop when they get whiny. It would be glorious.
the boat guy just offended rick
Close ups of the paint job on the boat looks terrible jeez
Elvis making $225/night. Your average musician often makes less than that today.
I mean the 3rd guy’s professional is a professional yes and he knows what he’s on about, but tbf he does have a punchable face😂
the last guy wasn't upset or anything. in fact, he seems determined to prove the bag belonged to the right guy. not sure why he's so confident about it but he is
I could tell right away that the Elvis signature didn't look like ink it looked like a Xerox copy
I love all the working class idiots in the comments who are actually talking about this scene and this show is if it's real and not scripted from beginning to end. I bet you guys like wrestling too and call it real
People get very disappointed when they’re told their treasure is not what they thought. But these guys are experts, and chances are they’re probably right. It’s one thing to want a second opinion, but to act like they don’t know what they’re talking about, or that they’re trying to scam you, is just hubris. Like it or not, they know more than you.
Find one🤣
Rewatching these videos, thanks for bringing it here on YouTube. It's good to see the Oldman in these clips. RIP
Fascinating that the people selling items think they more than actual experts. Also, I don’t feel bad for anyone that doesn’t luck into money. Stop crying, lady.
Native Americans. Not Indians
I never understood y ppl go to pawn shops and expect like top dollar on a item
Rick's stupid laughter is a big issue. People really don't know if he laughs with'em or on them.
Why the heck these people expect top value from a pawnshop? Lol
It’s still an old briefcase that was owned by a congressman and the father of a very famous person so it’s still worth a bit of money
If the show was 100% low ball offers and all rejections I would watch 😂
FELIX RIGAU CARRERA WAS THE FIRST PUERTO RICO PILOT AND THE FIRST HISPANIC SOLDIER IN THE US ARMY AND NAVY🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷✈✈✈✈✈
16:10 had me so sad
They are scammers
This pawn shop are scammers
Lol don't appraise it before the "expert" 🤭😏
What the first guy needs to understand is, in the world of reselling and collecting, authenticity is KEY. Custom work is a no no, it gouges the prices
⁹ⁿ on NJ no
Imagine the guy who checked the Elvis document just puts the magnifier down and wipes his butt with it and goes   “ sorry that’s what it’s worth right there …toilet paper …it’s a copy “ 😂😂😂
Why be mad at the shop? Go find another seller - oh wait. You probably can't. These guys are giving you clesr explanations and you want to be mad? Oh well
Why do customers suddenly think they're experts on what they're trying to sell after a quick Google search like wtf😅
Fun🤩
I'd laugh if the old lady would have crumbled that contract or shredded it in front of them.... And then the expert would later say...." I was just kidding..it was real" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It looks just like the '57 Chevy I bought my dad.  *The '57 Chevy looks like a '55 Chevy in the picture*
If anyone can make a show appear stupid… it’s Chum Lee.
Boat  Brake Out Another  Thousand And that's what Boat stands for...
Why is treetrunks voice actress trying to sell elvis contracts?
9:30 they make this music like he is explaining the final plot twist at the end of a movie.  How he was right all along and the good guys will never win.
The second guy obv butt hurt him, "the boats like lipstick on a pig" there's 150 in the world, made almost 100 year ago now, you would expect some lipstick on the pig otherwise that boats going to cost way more
21:59  "Dangit Bobby, I sell propane and propane products.  I know Austrian weaponry when I see it" - Hank Hill
Pawn Stars reminds me of The Goldbergs in that however long you stay engaged you are bound to finally end up deeply disliking all the main players
Why do people goto pawn shops?! Well if you take an item to an actual auction you have to pay fees and the auction house takes a percentage on top. Pawn shops are a much faster way to get the money and they’ll give you a valuation at no extra cost. Just to have an item valued before an auction could cost you hundred of dollars.
I love this, people think they have a winning lotto ticket and they find out they dont
If you need to take up a loan to buy stuff at an auction, then you shouldn't be at the auction.
17:50 LOL!  Some of the pawners they get are real babies and don't seem to understand how a pawn shop operates (although you don't really see a good example of the latter in this video.) I totally understand the disappointment of finding out your item isn't worth near as much as you thought (or not worth anything in the worst cases), but that's life. You can whine and complain all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that your item isn't that valuable. Sure, to *you* it may be valuable, but they obviously don't go by sentimental value. If they bought items based on that, they'd be out of business before they even got started. Also, disagreeing with the *expert* is just silly, like they someone know more then they do.
The first one has YTP energy
I like grand father he is very cool
The guy at the end had a Hitler stash 😂
They really be tryna scam people 😐😐🥱🥱🥱
Experts shouldn't say, "my opinion" just say it with confidence. Otherwise people question it
you are a punk kid.... one you doesn't know how to speak or communicate effectively lmfao
I could tell that was a copy lol
I’d hang up the Elvis signature and tell people it’s real lmaooo
how can you NOT see that the elvis contract is a copy? like HOW?
well, he clearly is a punk kid.
22:25 that guy must get tired of customers being rude to him
Pawn Brokers is like an old ex lover of ours. It's times we hate them while others times we  love them......I don't think the pawn industry would fit me. Knowing my tolerance level Rude customers be mean to me I'm liable to smack somebody straight up !.....God bless Rick & the Crew......lol.  I feel bad for The Elvis lady.....I would told her what, if it was a Chuck Berry or Ritchie Valenz I buy it off her $ 3000 grand......hopefully that would help her out   💯♥️♦️♣️♠️♥️♦️♣️♠️
I stopped watching a few years ago after learning how fake it is.
This pawn shop is like any other there to screw the peaple
Rick always trying to scheme someone
All staged and fake.
DINKLESBUHL — I have been there !
"dingleberry", Germany?  LOL.
Did that guy ever come back
I never cared much for Elvis.  I did see him sing in Ann Arbor.  DNA suggests he is a 4th cousin.    I was not a fan.
Pawn brokers are arrogant and shifty. Idk why people bring their cool items to these tool bags haha
Just looked it up, found a halbred that is almost identical for 1,350
It’s a bummer this show is so scripted
Boat-guy was on the verge of crying?
Give the old lady 10 grand anyway you cheapskate.
The only thing  i would ever collect is Jesus sandals❤
The second guy is a nut
That first boast was hideous
I love Rick's professionalism.
Naming it as "5 disappointed/angry sellers" is about as disappointing as when I actually went into your pawn shop and realized it was all souvenirs
FAKE FAKE FAKE
Guy with the fake Hudson Bay Gorget was great. More like him please.
I'm sure you guys can find somebody else in this guy here
Second guy was a punk kid who probably stole it from his family to make a quick buck
I feel bad for the old lady
Pawn stars is the cool version of Antique Road Show
Is this a biased show or something 'cause everytime they call a do called expert it's always less that they expect
oh Tesla crash equal huge fire
the fattest guitarist asked me to get it onnnn
I feel that I feel that
During the last segment there's an Amazing Fantasy 15 in a case behind the seller. Now I need to know how much they were asking for it cause...I'm a nerd
HILARIOUS
Did you know that Tom Hanks is a distant cousin of Abraham Lincoln's mother? And..., Kurt Russell's Grandfather had pilots' license number 51, which was signed by one the Wright Brothers. Kurt loves to fly his own planes.
How to scam addicted gamblers.
Like 99,000 less 😹😹
16:00 He has an overly large magnifying glass and another magnifier in his big bag. He must be an expert - otherwise he'd have them in his pocket, and he wouldn't have the overly large one.
A guy just pulled in the parking lot? with a boat he wants to sell. So Chum and I? are going to check it out.
Charles Lindberg was also a nazi sympathizer.
The fact that the title is spoiling whats gonna happen with the deals its a turn off
Dingleberry germany 🤣🤣🤣🤣
17:50 woody Harrelson
My father Harley Abelson owned and raced the first V haul race boat glasstron made. It was called the JJ. He broke the speed record in it at lake x in 1966 with it. It was awesome the first boat with the extended shafts that mercury made.
Buffalo Bill went into deep freeze as soon as Rick started talking about zinc isolation
I have antique daily missal book original by father lasance 1952
4:37  the exact moment you realize you won't be able to buy all the drugs and the drugs you took are wearing off
He's so full of shite. That's  a 20,000 boat all day long..
i saw it online similar necklace go for 100 bucks lmao
Sonny Bono lives!!! He's selling boats.
That neck piece.. alloy like that as a natural alloy appeared since 1550s. Although after that it had like a dozen names and varieties. Can't tell from video alone without chem expertise if that's artificial alloy or natural. And artificially it began to be recreated in germany since 1750 "german silver", yeah, 20% zinc even though they did NOT knew it's  zinc,  under another name - white silver, silver brass, etc,  Zinc first isolated in 1746.
lmao it said william halt on it
Looks like Kris and Davis are pretty nice guys...lovely attitude.
It's an ugly boat
Scammers
You can tell the first bloke is one of life's losers, going nowhere fast. I bet his dad doesn't know he took that to the pawn shop.
2nd dude was tryna sell some skyrim necklace
Some people can't handle the truth
Bust out another thousand. B.o.a.t
Rick. Is.  Such.  A.  Con.  And.  A.  Rip.   Off!   His.  Money.  Comes.  First.  His.  Family.  Comes.  Second
If it is true.....it is not a insult.  To say he was being petty.  Are you kidding?  The boat does not have the original engine.  I think that is far from petty.
Taking something of significant value (real or percieved) to a pawn shop and expecting to get a retail price out of it seems ridiculous to me? The "edge" and "rudeness" that some of these sellers have going in amazes me? Pawn shops are for people that are desperate for quick cash. Take it, market it and deal with all the inevitable ridiculous offers you will receive if you want top money. Otherwise STFU and either accept the offer or move on.
He thinks I'm some punk kid...... You are some punk kid 😂
Who's William Hart ?
7:57 "you're not funny" . Bravo. it's refreshing that finally someone tells Chum to STFU. There are times to say lame  jokes 3 straight times and there are times for Baldy do his thing and make an offer.
For 10 500 I'll buy the boat immediately
first video on which i didn't see 100 comments saying 'Rick having a' guy' for everything 😂 😂 very strange 😂
You have a shrimp or crab place that's a selling point
That junky looking guy with his dad's antique necklace was looking forward to buying a big ole rock with that $100,000.
That kid that wanted to sell that necklace look like a serial killer in the making!
مرحبا ياسيدي  انت انسان ناجح وموءدب اتمني لك التوفيق والنجاح
Just because you think it’s real or worth more, doesn’t make it so. “I disagree 100%”, that’s nice.
I have a 1 and three quarter pound ball of pure platinum! It's been smelted and refined. It's about the size of a gulf ball. What do you think you could give me for it pawn stars?
I have a 1 and three quarter pound ball of pure platinum. It's been smelted and it's about the size of a gulf ball.
That guy with the briefcase looks like BTK. Gives me the creeps
I want to go to Dingleberry Germany
Ha ha I have one of those boats not hard to find
That other pawn guy at the start is a total dumbass
What is the song played in the beginning called?
Love that boat, "lipstick" and all! But not the price. And Elvis' "Hound Dog" and "Don't Be Cruel' were on the same record. Double-sided hits. Thus, they both went to #1!
The 2nd seller is really stupid. I guess his father passed his genes to his son 😂
“I don’t think that would fit around your head”       “Ok”
I was at a scrapyard, selling dismantled appliances, an old guy was trying to sell silvet statues there

The Hudson's Bay Company still exists.  It's called The Bay department store in Canada.
Iz NOT funny, the bit with the Hudson company gorget. Maybe it's really nickel silver, and maybe the element zinc was truly isolated as a specific element in the 1800s, but fact is the metal has been used ans smelted since antiquity, brass is by no means a recent invention, and nickel silver was known and made, at least in China, under the Qing dynasty, that is, certainly on from the 1700s, maybe a century earlier... and that's from documented stuff, since the alloy was made from leftover ores, it might have been created a lot earlier.
people are so pathetic lol
If this wasn't on film and 40-50 years ago, the Old Man would have thrown him out personally.🤣
No one:  Boat seller: FIND ONE!
It's funny how they want us to believe that they know all about these items .. items are researched before the show airs
The one scene with the rotating barrel rifle which episode is that and when did. Craig meet that same customer in which previous episode
I like how when the people buy these Items they get scammed and they think they have something rare and valuable and if you get an expert and tell them about the flaws they get angry and think youre bullshitting them
WOW!😲... That little punk really was "way out of line"!🤯
if you have a good eye, you will see that there are good watches included in this video too
I bet Davis tries to tell his mechanic what to do. Gimp.
Shite looking boat!
My heart absolutely broke for that poor lady with the Elvis document. I mean it’s not often you see someone who is let down and it’s a genuine tragedy. I felt so terrible for her because she had this believing it was real especially knowing her deep devotion to Elvis and how much she admires him, to find this out after all these years I feel so sorry for her and I really hope she finds some good fortune soon
Why argue with the experts...? It's not like they've spend YEARS studying the stuff they know....
Do they not know it's a pawn shop? It's not an auction place.
I don't hear anyone asking for history lessons.
The 58 boat and the "57" Chevy he bought for the old man. That was a 55 Chevy. Look at the lack of fins on the rear. That's a 55 or 56 Chevy not a 57...
It's funny seeing adults act like children.  Well i believe its worth more.   I guess I shouldn't be surprised why we have so many theists in the world still in the 21st century.  People still have child and adolescent mentality and go with what they want to believe then accepting reality and the truth.
The Limbergh thing would still be pretty cool tho
The Lord is coming soon. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and repent of your sins and He will set you free. He loves you so much that He died for you. John 3:26, John 14:6 Acts 16:31 Romans 10:9-10
Poor kids father got jipped that things is not that old
Okayyy but like, the Hudson Bay one... Seriously my dude? How dumb you got to be? It literally has the beaver on it and says Montreal. Canada (established) is only around 200 years old therefore that's how old Hudson Bay company is in Canada. Literally didn't want to educate himself at all but just threw a fit. If anything that piece should come back up here in a museum or back to the indigenous peoples.
That poor old lady
ese five deals that took a turn for the worse when things weren't going as planned, in this Pawn Stars compilation.
2nd Guy, You are a Punk 😂😂😂
Rick- These Pete Rose cards are obviously printed on an inkjet and fake AF!  Rick- This Elvis contract that you claim he’s autographed is just too tricky… mind if I call in a buddy of mine?  😂😂
It's like lipstick on a pig 🤣🤣🤣
Elvis and JB both get their style from, black gospel and rnb something they’ve mentioned before too. (Fun Fact)
"He was basically insulting me with the paint thing, the petty stuff." Yes, that petty little thing that covers the entire boat!
5:17 I feel like hes the one smoking something.
Bruh I could tell that Presley contract was a repro and I'm just a dude from Texas.
Not hard to tell the Elvis contract was copied..so her friend in the industry was a thief..most likely made $ using music artists signatures,.right fully shouldn't have that in his hands to begin with..
"He must think I'm some punk kid"   Yeah because that's what you are
Just look up Hudson Bay gorgets. They don't go for anything near 100k. Even actual 1700s Era ones.
The show is scripted slightly because obviously its a show, they were successful before the show though, the store actually has two stores the regular one and the tv set one.
Looks more like an orca.
Bevis and butthead
Number 3 was so passive aggressive😂
Great work on the cameraman getting the tears of the Elvis contract lady.
“Im a collector. Also, I don’t know squat about what I am collecting.”
“This guy doesn’t know s*** about boats.” “Also, I am at a pawn shop.”
Expert- "$750 tops"  Rick- "Really?"  Expert- "$1000 maybe"
Meget fin video - tak for god underholdning
I’ll offer you right around 1500 bucks ‘ what a piece ‘ Cory - no for the pair 😂😂😂😂
2:43 I felt Rick was mad when Chum said "you got schooled" and that's why he didn't make an offer
8:35 "Well it's a pleasure seeing you" *discreet side eye*
I hate customers bro
This Fake TV Show looks like it was all rehearsed before this was Taped to be Shown on TV
Chum lee looking like a seal
As a Teen, Elvis would go to Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup R&B  concerts and once prophetically said "IF I ever get to the Place that ol' Art is AT then I'll be a Music Man like the world never saw"> Elvis 1st hit song "That's All Right Momma" was written & sung by ol' Art Crudup
"You couldn't find another boat like that" he literally said he was selling it to get ANOTHER boat with tail fins 🤦‍♂
How is this show still on the air? They been exposed as the frauds, and con artists they are.
I love how they have a expert on speed dial for everything, so fake 😆
I’d love for the experts to flip the argument back around to the seller & ask why they believe they’re correct 😂
Sir that was a 55 Chevy u bought for the old man. The 57 has larger fins and a different front
I grew up in Fredonia, NY. I had no idea about this local bit of history.  Neat!
the first dude had attitude. he got no offer for being a  moron.
The boat community are offended.
Mike looks like Hitler
pawn stars guys are dooosh bags!
The decorative pole arm could have also been placed in the 1500s as a parade piece. I'm no expert but just my two cents
One thing you remember is all about being original...   Plus in great condition...
The women with the Elvis contact definitely went home and smashed it in a pit of rage… I know I would 😭🤣🤣
Wonder if the d-bag ever got 100k for his crappy necklace?
The old lady with the Elvis contract really a tear jerker. What a sweet lady
Was the rifle guy the same guy who brought in the Patterson Colt?  ETA - tney bring it up when the expert arrives!
The Elvis lady made me sad :(
it's look so cool, don't stop do it
“F*ck that guy. He probably thinks I’m just some punk kid.” - Some punk kid
Yeah....a punk kid. That kid with the gorbet is crazy! I wonder what the older lady with the Elvis contract needed the money for? She said the money would help her find her "way out".
Just by bringing your item on the show might get some interested buyer's -- they should give info on anything they don't buy??
I bet those "experts" were prepped beforehand to de-value the items.........
BRUH you can tell from the camera the Elvis contract is a copy this whole show is fake but it's still good
“people that actually know what they are talking about” so people who will lie to you? just because he says something you didn’t like about your axes doesn’t mean he doesn’t know what he’s talking about
the first 2 guys were SO MAD 💀💀💀💀
I find it rather laughable that any of these items would be taken to a pawn shop if they're so convinced of their value. You'd want to get it appraised, and take it to auction, surely?
"I'd like to get $10,500 for the boat because you couldn't find another boat like that..."   That's actually not how putting a value on something works.  Someone could say the boat isn't worth $10K because there are no other boats like that...
Loved this show, I never liked Chumlee, he is such a knucklehead that when he speaks to a customer Intelligently... You know it is scripted.
26:00 My question is even though it’s not Charles Augustus’s bag but his father’s Bag wouldn’t it still hold some kind of value through its history and extreme close association with Augustus himself?
I know what I would do with a boat. Sell it to SOMEONE IN VEGAS.
"Hudson Bay" is one of the oldest companies in the world.   Spoke  like a true American lmao
The dude at 3:02 reminds me of elon musk
I feel like a lot of the sellers know they're asking for too much money; they start trying to 'sell' their item by saying 'BUT IT'S SO RARE' 'IT'S COOL AND UNIQUE' as if that's going to work...
As for the last dude with the Lindbergh satchel and his comment:  "I will prove that and when I come back it's going to  cost a whole lot more, heh, heh".   I might remind him of what my grandfather always said:  "If you need to sell your cow, you're gonna take whatever your neighbor is willing to pay for it.  And if he don't need your cow, he ain't gonna buy it."   I don't think the Pawn Stars really need that satchel........
Expert: Tell me what you know about them...so I can angle that into my appraisal to give my friends a bit of leverage in ripping you off.
So the Elvis copy why when he picked it up did it have a bit of paper barely hanging on and was a bit yellowed but in the original image it appeared ot be one solid piecec of paper?  Maybe I missed something or am seeing things idk
This makes Ric feel terrible liar Ric was hoping it was real so he can outstart  he even happier it's fake ha ha LoL 🤣
*Call The Expert!!!*
This guy always gets angry people
Did you put a price on my 🗣️
You are sum punk kid lol. Thats the funny part.
But where can you find one?  Well, it isn't like I woke up today and decided I need this boat.  It a general pawn shop.  The question is always "can I make money"?
That really bothers me when people get upset when the pawnshop is taking all the risk. Its their money.
Craig is my favorite.
they could offer rich a 10 carat diamond and he would offer 300 dollars
I sometimes wonder if the writers/producer have the sellers go super jerky.
*Those InTeLLigent Men  **-vs-**  DeMonic CriminaLs!!!* *To ME, This Proves  JeHoVah GOD  &  NOT that  Mu  TaTor Thing!!!* *I Have a part of the Spirit Con-Science in My Body!!!!  & so therefore* *I Can Seee TRUTH  &  I Love the TRUTH!!!!*
He sold those halbreds for 3800 and 2000
"Wooooah. Boat!"  Thanks Chum.
Half of these people are so confusing, surely they get asked to go into the pawn shop cause it genuinely baffles me when they get annoyed that they are getting lowballed. A pawnshop is the last resort to sell your items.
Educational,  entertaining and informational. The Harrison family has given so much to everyone through hard work and persistence.  Thanks to all of you.  God bless and continued success
Surprised no one picked up the fake contract before the expert. As soon as I saw it I thought hey that looks photocopied.
I’m looking to sell this piece of George Washingtons hair for 2,000,000$. Rick: 3$ and a cold coke
I came to laugh at idiots with tempers, but man, the woman who was heartbroken over the fake elvis contract gave me the feels.
$100,000 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
People have to remember the "experts" want the shop's business so they'll always say things are worth less than the real value
Complete low ball offer on the rifles. He'd sell them for $1000 a piece
likeee
I know it’s a tv show that needs drama, but haven’t these people that bring in $100000 items to a pawn shop heard of auctions, eBay, Craigslist, etc….
That old woman knew it was a copy
but it's scripted
I feel like some of these people subconsciously know that they don't have something good, but convince themselves that they do. Then they go to sell it and deny the truth.
"I'm not taking away from your expertise", "I still believe that this belongs to Charles Augustus Lindbergh". Sounds like someone is still in denial sir.
The "Punk Kid" with the $100,000 Gorget. I just saw an episode with him getting banned from the shop.
2:28 people on this show dont realise that they wont buy everything
Chum annoys me he’s dumb and talks too much
wish they'd make a follow-up showing what these folks actually sold their stuff for, especially the $100000 necklace
Why are people so difficult?
Imagine trying to get money for junk then be mad when you don’t get the money
That’s a 20 footer boat right there.          Looks great at 20 foot or more away lol 😂
The second guy just doesn’t understand basic chemistry
“I have this ultra rare, one of a kind, highly valuable…” “Highest I could go is $25”
Wasn’t the guy who brought the shotguns the same collector who brought the samuel colt pistol
Pretty much of sellers drop by the pawn shop just to hit the highest price and walk off into the sunset. You're dealing with professional people. Try to sell it by yourself and earned top dollars 🤣. They're so lucky to have those professional sharing their lifelong experiences with you . That cost money 💰 people.
chumlee looks more like old elvis than young elvis
Follow up on Lindberg leather bag? Did the mustache guy ever return with more proof it belonged to pilot?
Obviously NOT a real signature .
the boat was hideous, just my opinion.
Didn't need an expert to see that signature was photocopied and not real ink.
My heart brokke for the Elvis lady - she seemed really nice
Its funny when the people who did 5 minutes of research online think they know more than the experts
It’s interesting that the guy that checked the Elvis contract said “ he’s been looking forward to it all day”  I assume they can’t just drop everything and show up to the store, but I wonder does the customer just come back the next day?,and they make it look like it happens straight away.
Giọng Đức Phúc đỉnh quá đi mất. Nó kiểu mộc mạc, ko màu mè và nghe rất chân thành ấy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Mong 1 ngày sẽ được ngồi ở trời Đà Lạt và nghe Phúc hát 🎵
I feel so bad for the lady with the Elvis contract, she seems so nice. She wasn't even mad just disappointed.... I hope she didn't need the money desperately
You could tell that contract was a copy without a magnifying glass.
can we start the elvis presley lady a go fund me aw
Priceless faces when the crap what they bought for insane money turns out to be nearly worthless :P
Chumlee: "mind if I take it for a spin around the block to see if it works?"
2:55 His father was crazy...
The world is full of sore losers.
shotgunned a beer during this.
3:39 song name?
Davis looks like woodie harrilson
The pure arrogance of these people that have spent zero part of their lives studying what the appraisers have dedicated their lives to.
Aww just buy that Elvis copy from that nice lady!!
100000 for that,what is he smoking
Why do Americans always argue with specialists? It must be an inbuilt attitude, an unpleasant one at that,  of arrogance...concerning, 'I know better because I have an opinion...'. It is so immature. UK
Craig always be Lowballing people's Ish 🙄😒
Fun fact: Craig Gottlieb is a Cornell Honors graduate in Philosophy, and is also a former Marine Corp Major.  A very smart, accomplished man.
I tried to pawn my ex-wife there and they said she was a fake and offered me 5 dollars.   I took the deal! 😁👍 💵
People don't understand how "Pawn" works. You get screwed on the back end. It's the business
People are angry because they can’t sell their junk thinking that because the pawn shop is connected with a TV show they (have to buy)
It wouldve sold quick
He should've bought that boat
i love that guy with the two shot rifles. he always just seems like a grumpy old man that is actually pretty nice.
I love the old Ill just sell it to someone who knows what they're doing... Like okay if you had those abilities I doubt you'd be in a PAWN SHOP.
This is all scripted
Hudson Bay company was a Canadian company
The woman with the presley contract looked actually so kind to me I felt so bad for her. "I needed the money" omg i litterally want to give her money rn shes adorable
Ohhhh schools in session
Not strong enough to lift the rifles? What.
the disrespect from the sellers though
The expert drew passed away in a jail he was being detained in
That boat is cool looking.
So many of these people are like "I read stuff online so I know more than an appraisalist" lol.
These people are mentally challenged and lack the ability to stomach fact. Freaking wackos out there people. 🤪🤪🤪
The Gourget guy was out of order with the presence of the Old Man ..
Elvis Presley is the best
Rick’s knowledge is fantastic. What always amuses me is the excuse he makes the seller, to haggle the price down. He always comes up with something.
fack your Lindeberg

If you don't like the offered price, go out and sell it on your own. To say that your item is worth a certain price, you have to find someone willing to buy it at that price. You have a price that you think your item is worth. A potential buyer has a price they are willing to pay. Until you both agree on a price, then it's not "worth" anything. That's what the market is all about.
That poor old woman, I really hope she found the money she needed to get out of the hole she was in. I can't imagine the gut wrenching feeling of thinking all you're problems may be over and then told no. Something similar happened to my mom which makes me sympathize. She had what she thought was a very old Katana that her father gave to her. She thought it was from Feudal Japan and she thought she was going to get 20-30-40 grand to make all her problems go away. Turned out it was a fake, made by someone to imitate the old style. It made me cry to see my mom so sad.
I love how people walk in to the shop with a price in mind and get an experts opinion who has dealt with those items for 30 + years that is way less than what they wanted and thier first reaction is to argue when they literally said they don't  know nothing about the item 😑 and I know that they rip off some people but they also give some people a fair price and even sometimes give people more than what they ask cause he doesn't want to low ball them
I STOPPED watching these crooks. Check out their price tag in the case!
Scripted anyway
Pretty sure I'm going to be that 3rd guy in 13 years
Who actually believes these American reality shows are legitimate?? 😑😑. The acting is so bad
The acting is so bad
White Americans are just delusional 🤦🏽‍♂️
Dingelberry Germany 😆😆
'56 Chevy not '57 .
Dingleberry, Germany?  OMG I'm dying!! 😂
Yes you are a punk kid and no one needs to low ball you because you do that to yourself already. That's what I would have said if I was there. He did not scare me and I wasn't nervous watching this show.   Hi chum Lee! What are you up too right now?
dude at the end, WHAT A DREAMER, keep dreaming
honestly I could tell that Elvis contract was a copy from the video, no expert needed
Fake Space RACE
That arms expert gets picked on so much lol
We’ll never see Lindbergh Guy again
Boats can hide so many major problems and look great.
The dumbest show on television! It is so fake it is not funny. What you see on TV is not the same place as the real store.
Dean ambrose 3:08   ?
I collect antique Chinese porcelain, and I remember I used to frequent a very friendly site where we would swap images and info. But there was this one guy who kept claiming that he had multiple pieces of ruyi porcelain. If you don't know, ruyi is the very finest form of Chinese porcelain, maybe eight hundred years old, delicate and grey with a crackle pattern in it called "cicada wings". It is so rare that NOT A SINGLE INTACT PIECE has ever been found - museums are obliged to display broken ones, which are worth unimaginable amounts. I believe at latest count about fourteen such broken pieces survive.  This guy claimed he had multiple INTACT pieces of original ruyi porcelain. He then proceeded to show image after image of horrid looking clumsy dishes with snot green glaze. It was like a sinusitis patient sneezed on the fishpond decorations in a garden centre.  No matter what we said, this person refused to believe that they were NOT ruyi dishes. No doubt this was partly because he had paid a great deal for them. The worst part was that this guy clearly had no day job; so our objections were rapidly overwhelmed by hundreds and hundreds of posts by this guy defending his position. And he never stopped. No doubt he is still posting there today, eight years later. He reminds me of some of these folks  :-D.
Jesus loves you all he died on the cross for you I pray and I believe that you will find him weather that'd be today or another day. Jesus loves you all AMEN!!!!!!! <3
Soo freakin' cool!  One day out on the water on that would be a lifetime memory!
Not sure why you would still be interested in a piece if a dude very rudely insisted they're worth higher
“It’s worth about $10,000”  “Best I can do is $7”
People walk in wanting to sell something worth a pack of gum and I love it when they snort back, "No, I can't go that low. Absolutely not." Like they're in control.
Only a dummy buys a boat when they live in the middle of the desert
The kid in the second one got banned after that.
There is such a fatal misunderstanding here  A pawn shop is not going to give the full value of any product   If something is worth £10k and pawn shop pay £10k it means they’ll have to try and sell it for MORE than it’s worth to make any money
That lady with Elvis is sweet man not angry
5:25 Like zoinks scoob imma little salty after that one!
😂😊y5ep kk was r
you can find the first boat for 800$ LMAOOOOO
The second guy had me laughing so hard I was rushed to hospital.
alot of ppl don't do research when they go into pawn shop n always assume they're always right!!
The Elvis contract which I looked up was a Monday & Tuesday. In 1955 Elvis had a contract to appear on the Louisiana Hayride every Saturday night here in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was paid $18 and Scotty & Bill were paid $12 per show. My Grandmother was a HUGE Elvis fan and would tell us stories about The Louisiana Hayride and Elvis. Other than Las Vegas, Shreveport has to be one of the cities that he played more shows in than any other city. And because my Grandmother and Mother were such HUGE fans, they ruined my sisters 10th Birthday party which is on August 16. My Father who was a Firefighter was on his 24 hour shift and Grandmother and Mother were so devastated that none of the Mothers wanted to leave their daughters at the Birthday Party. My sister still holds a “grudge” to this day because of how my Mother overacted and made everything so Dramatic! Grandmother held her self together but our Mother always made EVERYTHING way more dramatic than it was.
"What the F are you talking about?"  answer should be.. "I'm talking about you getting out of my store."
The rifle guy has a reoccurring acting roll on the show.
Need 10000 it a lot less  her how much less  9900 her no im leaving
it's a gorget not a gorgey,sorry for the spelling
Never sell to these guys. You won't get what your item is worth.
11:32 haha 23:02 again Craig doesn´t make many friends on the show
Rick : So how much is it ?   Expert : “We’re looking at ……uh”
Anybody know when the last guy is coming back with the paperwork for the briefcase?
I love how he lead the first few on to belive it was worth a lot  then to tell em it was fake
He is gonna prove that briefcase was Charles Lindbergs when he comes back.    WHERE IS THIS MORON BEEN?   He never came back...Guess he does not want to world to see him make more of a fool of himself!!!
ITS A PAWN SHOP ….THEYRE ALWAYS GONNA LOW BALL YA CAUSE THEIR IN BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES…THEY’LL LOW BALL YA AND RESELL THE ITEMS FOR TWICE IF NOT 3x THE AMOUNT YOU SOLD YOUR ITEM FOR
The second guy was some nerd living in his mom's basement just trying and wishing he could fool someone into kinda resolving his issues lol "100k" lmfao come on doofus. Fck outta here.
1 John 5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
Craig is an MVP
The Elvis signature contract lady, my heart sank for her 🥲 I’ll keep her in my prayers
Because it was a lil 17 foot boat 😂😂
I actually think the guy who owns the halberds knows more about them than the "expert".
Cry baby opinion, makes me laugh every time
Based on that behavior you are a "punk kid".  Didn't want to hear his dad got punk'd on that second mortgage.
He just didn’t like the guy 😂 if it wasn’t for the money the whole family wouldn’t have anything going on
You could say $2 to this guy and he'd still give the same "Ooooh hmmm well the think is" face haha
The guy with the boat acted like a child
Bring On Another Thousand
They call me Harrison....Low-ball Harrison.    .
Nice hollywood third grade story😅
Wasn't the second man one of the two guys in 'Dumb and Dumber'?
I’m more of a straightforward kind of guy
12:37 all she said was a lie and her teeeth are fake
Still waiting for that last guy to prove it was the pilot and not his father’s.
sheesh
feel really bad for her
the guy at the start lamo
lol..i could tell as soon as i saw "Elvis Presley Enterprises" stamp....that didn't exist in 1955
He was just some punk kid
You’re dumb to walk into a pawn shop and not already have it somewhat appraised or verified, what if it is real and they convince you it’s fake and buy for tiny fractions of the actual value
Dude said his dad took a second mortgage on it, y’all are gullible
You are some punk kid
I agree.... "Way out of line."
17:00 Wiped nothing lol
I had a boat just like the 1957 black and white boat that guy brought in. I sold it for $350.00 and was happy to get that.
15:14 I almost thought she flicked them off 🤣😂
Their experts also are scammers who work with the pawn stars scammers
I love how they stand up to them and don't take their low ball offers how they do everyone else. This fake pawn stars hustlers always herring people for their stuff
I use to like this show but now I don't they call experts in that will help them lowball people and cheat people they not honest people
Your mom's chest hair Rick
I bet Rick wish he bought up Bitcoin too
A xerox copy of Elvis signature. Not worth a dump. People wanting big bucks for garbage.
They come to the shop expecting a home run and strike out. 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder if the last seller returned or not can’t remember
The rifle guy wasn't mad or angry. Just a regular guy busting balls.
And people today are paying thousands for jpegs 😂
"You won't find another one like this!"  That's the thing... I'm really not trying to find one at all.
Talk about a hound dog of a let down. One of you millionaires out there should help the lovely lady out.
As a European, this is like watching a documentary.
Why was this in my recommendations? I only watched it on tv a couple of times, but never on youtube, never googled it...
You couldn't buy that even if you found it for free in the ground rusted 🙄🤣
The Elvis signature lady was sad 😞 she was so excited to sell her Elvis contract and it broke her heart to have the man tell her it’s fake so sad
I know a lot of this is acting.  But what I don't understand is people walking into a 'pawn' shop and asking to get all this money as if Rick and the gang work at a auction.  They are in business to make money, period.  If you are unhappy with the price they want to give you below the value, then put it on a real auction site and get more money.  It is a f-ing pawn store for God sake.
He mortgaged his house to buy a necklace?
100000?? I spit my coffee out lol.
Bunch of people with no personality lol
Spread the gospel!
Spread the gospel!
I get tired of the smart-aleck assistants making cheap digs.
WOOw
Rick always thinks hes funny........hes not
Lipstick on a pig 🤣
How do you not research the product your wanting to sell?
I have some old coin I want to sell
Atleast he was a good sport about it
I felt bad for the lady, but i still think having that briefcase is kinda cool.
I feel kind of bad for Craig. He looks like a nice guy but he always has to deal with the down bad angry sellers.
yo can i have a job please
The gorget guy made me think serial killer before he said a single word. What a punk. Look at those spaghetti noodle arms. kek
I feel so sorry for the lady with the copy of Elvis's contract. she is such a sweet person
The kids father morgaged his house for neclec
"you couldn't buy that for 1,500 if you found it in the ground". Incredibly sound logic.
The second guy: wtf you smoking Common what are you gonna spent 100,000 on
Something what I noticed is tht the old women was not angry at all man 😆
How could Rick not know that Elvis contract was a photocopy?
The look she gives him at 11:56 is priceless
Rick:  Whatcha got here? Seller:  It's the actual Ark of the Covenant. Rick:  Not sure about the patina on it, let me bring in an expert. Expert:  Yep... It's the real deal, Rick. Rick:  (Huffs)  This is gonna take up a lot of space in my shop... It's a niche item and may take a long time to sell... Really taking a risk on this one.  How about I give you $1000?
CLassic Rick
Craig is just a savage
0:58 That Bel-airshown in the video is a 1955, not a 1957.
I deal with smart-azz customers just like these people here.
From what I understand this show is staged, and Rick and the rest of the “stars” of the show are never even on the floor except during filming. They spend all their time in the back of the shop autographing items that they sell out front that are never even seen on the show.
Fool, if you want $10,500 you say you want $25,000.
I don't understand why some of these people seemingly go into a pawn shop without doing any research prior. We have the internet!!! You know someONE who uses it and can help. Research your stuff and sell it online! Pawn shops are notorious for ripping people off.
Lmao I looked up Austrian Halberds and found one almost exactly like that from the 15th century and the seller wanted $1,400. Craig is always right on the money, definitely one of their best experts.
I cheer when people walk out WITH their items. I'd be asking those guys how much they intend to charge someone else.
It is said the last man has yet to come back…
i'm more impressed by the amount of people in these comments that think these conflicts are real and unscripted LOLOLOL *camera man must have the harry potter invisibility cloak on*
He.needs.be.out.business.he.dam.crook Cheating.people.out.there.stuff
Why do these people act like Rick and the crew owe them something? These people clearly don't know as much about their items as they think, can't provide as much evidence to back them as the experts who just walk in and can list the reasons why it's not what they think it is, and then they still want to act like they should have to buy it anyway.
2nd guy is Elon musk before tesla.
Isn’t this show fake anyways? Aren’t they all actors
Guy with that horrendous looking boat: "Find one"... Me: I'd rather waste my time finding someone who would want one first!
Money is money 💰
If this show is staged then that lady with the Elvis document was an incredible actor. I really do wonder weather or not this show is real or fake
Insurance company says what happened. guy I didn't like the car so close behind me so I brake checked him. He then passes me and does the same. I melt like a scared snowflake and shoot through the front windshield at him.
I love how everyone wants retail value for their stuff at a Pawn store, not thinking the Pawn shop needs to make money as well... DRIVES ME CRAZY!  😒
I never knew Elvis had a twin brother who died at birth.
Cool items
those Kelly hart shotguns are worth way more than 1400 dollars
You can see the Elvis contract is a photocopy, even on the video. This has to be staged.
This show is so laughably bad.
"Wanted to lowball me" bro a 99k difference isn't a lowball, it's a different planet
The guy selling the Gorget definitely owns a few trenchcoats.
They’re always calling the professor from Jurassic park
I feel the Elvis situation very unfortunate almost as if someone she cared about gifted her that imposter contract.
"Well, good luck finding something of that quality" Imagine if Craig walked back in the store 10 minutes later with a halberd and a receipt showing he paid only $1500 (or less) for it
Rick passed up on the boat because the seller corrected him and hurt his fragile little ego
The last one is kinda weird because eventhough it was clearly made for Senior it doesnt mean Junior didnt use it or pawn it. You could even say the letter was to inform Senior "his" or something(s) belonging to him was going to be pawned. Either way it was a family piece so it has to have some decent value or at least youd think so but 85k? Nah I dont see it either but it would still be nice to know abouts what it is worth. Js
From Gyrating hips to WAP. Smh  At least you could respect the old timers for their musical talent and modesty. Js
Some Punk Kid: "He thinks I'm some punk kid."
It didn't matter what price the guy said... Rick was going to say Oooh uh.... LOL
The man with the boat Rick did you a favor by not embarrassing you by the offer which I’m sure would have been around a $1000 or maybe less
Fun fact: Forrest Gump taught Elvis how to dance
I want that boat.
William heart, I wonder if he is related to Steve heart from BBCE.
Old Lady : I've got Elvis Presley signature..i want it for $8000 to $10,000 Rick : let me get someone here to check the signature if its legit or not... 15 minutes later...Stevie Wonder walks in..."Hiii Rick..you call me for the signature.."
So dang fake. When that older lady brought in contract, at first look i was confused cause its OBVIOUSLY a copy. But rick couldnt tell that right away? Come on now. Then the “expert” with his tools of the trade??? Just wow,lol.
Boats are tough to sell, he got that right.
23:13 said 750$ a piece gets offered that and walks out mad
Second guy definitely looking for drug money, or for a tuner.  3rd guy is that person who gets all his info off of Facebook and Wikipedia and swears it’s all legitimate.
The guy with the revolving rifles, they should've told him to take his property, and leave and never come back.
That spear guy look like crying and desperate like he had a depth in casino haha
ELVIS PRESLEY WAS IN MY HOMETOWN IN 55 ??????
I doubt the second guys father spent his serving mortgage on his house at an auction. If he did he got screwed
I don't know what you been smoking   " I sure like that " you tell him bro.
PAWN THIS
17:36 Dingleberry Germany lmao
I really felt bad for that old lady 🥲
They needed an expert to tell them it's a xerocopy? I could see it from here.
It looks just like the ‘57 I got for the old man’s birthday.  Shows us a ‘56
@5:25 He kinda is a punk kid
can yuo guys post the episode where chumlee lives in a society
first!!!!!!!
Correcting the person you want to make a deal with is not a good idea!!
The first guy probably would’ve had a shot at selling if he didn’t give Rick so much attitude that’s why Rick went from wanting the boat to not wanting it at all
Now that the appraisal of the lindbergh briefcase is public (through TV and this video) the seller will never find another person to buy it for what he's asking. Taking a potentially valuable item onto a TV show like this is not a wise thing to do.
I feel so bad for the appraiser he gets so much hate lol
17:37 he knows his South Park references
I’m looking to sell this briefcase full of $1 million in cash.   How much do you want for it?  I was hoping to get $2 million.   The best I can do is $50.
this is gas RIP OLD MAN
Fell so bad for the old lady...
11:58 sounded like the start of a huge Rick laugh lmao
The 2nd guys was there to challenge Rick🤣🤣
The second guy gave off some serious "violent junkie" vibes
“You couldn’t FIND another boat like this! That’s not the point! Can you even find one? FIND ONE?!”
If your going to make a court case ending joke at least make it funny.
That guy insulted the boat when he took it to the pawn shop!
Who else just re watches this abt once a week on accident
I felt bad for the Lindbergh guy.  My thought is the father of Charles Lindbergh the pilot I would have thought held even more value because he was the father of the guy that did the most incredible feat at the time.
I bet that second guy was higher then Rick ever was
That boat would look Kool behind the old man's 57 Chevy
The fact that all this is staged annoys me.
5:00 looks like shaggy
That kid with the necklace was probably just gonna use that money to stock up on weed and hookahs.
Let’s get real. These guys live to put the F’s to everyone they can.  None of them would amount to Jack squat without the old man’s efforts to begin with.
People are stupid and they hope you are more stupid.
punk kid was as expected - Halberd guy would pass a polygraph test even when he lies himself he believes it straight away! Also the Lindbergh guy was weird. Yeah I'm a Lindbergh baby! Really? You're a Lindbergh heir? ....no...Wierdo!
Aww feel so bad for the old lady
That Elvis contract was super fake I voted tell it was a copy when I saw the signature notice the lines were not solid and each line was broken with many spaces.. no need to magnify it..
Looks just like the 57 Chevy I got for the old man. Then shows a 55 Chevy (which is an insult to the 57 Chevy community)
I love how these paid actors act like children lol
The halberd guy and expert being so adamant about them being real, DESPITE the fact that one of them is obviously made of two thin layers of metal, clearly indicating that it is a decoration. 18:36. Makes me think this show is hella rigged/scripted.   Or is this how authentic halberds were made? With two sheets of metal shaped into a hollow blade? Doesn't make sense for that to be the case.
People walk in on a Pawn Shop, basically not having even a single thought and idea about what they brought,and have the audacity to be mad and boastful just to get a snap of finger kind of a fortune.
80 horsepower boat def goes over 30 haha
Chumlee just a doper
Only one crying was the old man
walanghiya yan cusi dimonyo laking pera nakuha niyan kay uy
Guy comes in to sell 15 pounds of gold "i just want $1000 for it all" Rick: ohhh i dont know.....how about $50? Look man im taking all the risk here, theres some dents and scratches in those gold bars!
Lmbo. You're funny and always make my day
"Oh my goodness gracious it's you again " 😂😂😂 yeah he knew what he was in for
hey chum chum cuh m m
I'm about 20 mins from Fredonia! Fredonia Hillbillies!
Love how they make you watch 2 10-15 second videos without being able to  skip
Oh all it needs is a 10k Paint job! That's all Rick! Just pay the man over market value! It's only a boat without original parts!
If you believe this face is honest! You need help.
It's crazy that people talk crap about Craig for his appraisals. That dude may have done a bit of googling but I'm sure Craig actually has an education in that field unlike whiny babies that don't get the ridiculous price they wanted for their garbage
"I think he just wanted to lowball me"  No I think your dad just lost his house over a $1500 gorget
I love how Rick always keep his cool even when he is dealing with someone who is very rude. 😎
And the last guy never showed his face again lol
really don’t understand why chum was even at that first deal. he brought literally nothing to the table and acted the fool the whole time
How obvious was it from the moment that she revealed it that she had a facsimile of the contract? An expert and 2 magnifiying glasses? Really?  Ain't TV great?
if we can tell it's clearly a photocopy on a low-resolution recording, then why go to so much effort, they blatantly spotted that right away,
That punk kid dude really a punk kid fr
$10500 for a small motorboat? That's cheap af... A laser sailing dinghy is like $8500 brand new!
If you want to get the most for your item DON'T go to a pawn shop!
lol that second guy was straight out of Idiocracy.
"That would be your cry-baby, whiny assed opinion?"   That made me LOL.
The second guy finds out his dad took out a second mortgage for a $1500 piece lmao
I love Craig's realistic valuations.
Rick tried to offer me 100$ for my Lamborghini!
I liked the boat 🚤
I don`t trust pawn shops. It`s so easy to lie and pay way less than the value. When i was a child, i wanted to sell some old toys, but the pawn guy cheated me.
Just never understand how-why people think they are going to get retail price from a pawn shop? Realize that’s the basis of the show, but each show exactly the same. Plus lead Pawn Shop characters are insufferable and basically obnoxious.
Second guy is a reject
Some of these people are so delusional that even though the findings of the expert are fakes, forgery, etc. that they still want to believe feelings over facts, research, and logic.
Felt sorry for the elvis lady
This show is staged like all the other reality shows.
Some of the customers are so rude its almost impossible to believe.  Congratulations to the professionals for not reacting to provocation or chastising them in return .
"Thinks I'm some kind of punk kid" - Proceeds to act like a punk kid. 🙄🙄
These guys are sooo knowledgeable about any subject. That’s crazy how they know all this on random items
wasnt that a chevy? lol
My corvette is best corvette cause it has a matching boat
You know I understand pawn shops need to make money but they also rip people off on the pricing of their items quit going to pawn shops find collectors plain  and simple
I knew mike would be in this video
Sorry big boss but you didn’t hook someone with the hooked end you drove the pointed end into the rider and drove him off the horse  that’s why it was so long . You stood ground and used it to stake the rider off the horse . You’d try to swing that thing into a rider and the momentum of the Calvary charge would over power you and you’d go flying 😂
Sir Chum Lee's facial expression at 22:06 is beyond amazing
You can see why these actors didnt make it in hollywood.
Pawn Shops are trying to make money. I don't get why people get personally offended when Rick or someone else isn't interested, if they felt like they could make money off of it, they'd be interested. simple as that.
Every makes out but the seller these guys are rip offs
5:19 shaggy from scooby doo
I would of taken the boat just to keep for myself. Rick's entire faced changed when the guy schooled him. Petty.
"I think he thinks I'm just some punk kid..."  NOW WHAT ON EARTH WOULD EVER GIVE YOU THAT IDEA
U got 6 degrees of seperatipn..... thinks to self thanks viritasium
It’s interesting how they have had different experts come in through out the year
Davis is a lawyer here in Lubbock.  Funny to see this!
Lookin WORRIED at 16:04 😹😹
10:30 he was just ready to insult the expert 😭 man was so hurt
I’ve got a LEFT HANDED MONKEY WRENCH ….ILL LET IT GO FOR $10,000.00
You have to exhaust all other means of selling your item before going to any sh*t hole pawn stores.
they shouldve given the old lady $50 for the contract 😢
“I’m looking to get 10,000 for it”  Craig: I’m about to end this whole man’s career
Everyone's an expert right? lol! Boo your fake items! Sweet old lady though.
All actors
Sellers: well your expert said at the RIGHT auction it could get $20,000 ... Everyone else: So why aren't you taking it to the RIGHT auction?  Rick: Best I can do it 2 grand 🤷‍♀️ I take all the risk, I have to find the right auction.. then there's auction fees.. I have to pay someone.. I'll be lucky if I break even..
The woman with the copy Elvis contract I feel bad she wasn’t angry at all she was just sad and disappointed made me feel bad
Ricks laugh makes me want to eat a bullet
Alternative title:  Pawn Stars: All Staged (5 actors with pretend angry and disappointed skills)
These people who bring in 'antiques' need to calm down. If you bought it at auction then bring in the auction papers. If you don't get the valuation you want, then ebay it
11:55 chummley😂😂
Surely if these people have never seen the show then they at least know that pawnbrokers make their money by giving bad deals to people who are desperate. I can't understand why they get upset when they don't get offered the money they ask for.
The one mistake people make when trying to sell their item is telling the pawn brokers how much they want for the item. Never tell them what you want because they get on the phone with the "expert" and work out a deal behind your back.
Wow, a whole compilation of people getting butt-hurt
I think anytime a deal goes bad on here, Rick should sm@ck Chumlee and berate him.
Elvis and them gyrations
"I made my own research"...this dudes are the equivalent of novax, flatearth and so on...
That boat-dude was hilarious. When you come wandering, asking other people to cough up a sum of money for something they dont want to buy, its useless to start swearing, muttering and namecalling. You are offering a product. The prospective buyer doesnt want it. Period. Doesnt matter why. You have to accept it and get lost. It never ceases to amaze me that people with zero leverage still think they have the upper hand.
Why do I get the feeling like the second kid stole that item from his dad.
The funny thing was that dude WAS just a punk kid😂
Examples of the Hudson Bay gorget are all over eBay. All less than $1,000. The kid was clearly not being honest, which is unsurprising. But I am surprised at his indignity at being called out. Lol.
Second Guy:   No lowballs. I know what I got.
Bust out another thousand but with that boat it would have been thousands out dated motor alone needs 4 stroke new controls then body paint FORGETABOUT ITT AAAA
I do not like pawn stars or rick at all.  but, these know everything customers are a joke
genius with the zinc thing, take it to an auction, since you know so much.
This show is so stagged!   Pawns are historic experts on everything that comes in...not!! So scripted!!
What's a solid flip, purchase for 40% of retail? Maybe up to 75% if we're talking about 10s or 100s of thousands. It's like these people think Rick can auction this stuff off the next day for 100% of the appraisal...
Grandma came in there tryna finesseeee😂😂😂
I feel so bad for the old lady
99% of these are fake and staged for the show...
15:13 she low key flipped them off
You can absolutely find a functional legitimate pole axe on the internet for much less than $1,500. That guy was so irrational.
These are the same people that i see at gunshows trying to sell me an SKS for 700$
Dont think that was a 57 chevy rick
Antique Roadshow is much better.  All Pawn Stars is alright if you like watching people get their pants pulled down & screwed by the shop owners. Watching the old lady crying because she needs the money, how horrible. Pass.
Breathes heavily* Drive it like a rocket
Well they can always try to look and sell it on their own
@22:37 let me tell you, I've been in 3 jcpenny's and I've yet to see one of these. You have no idea what you are talking about. I want to see your manager.
Need money to win the Casino jackpot...
Feel bad for the older woman with the Elvis contract, then they zoomed in on her grief, and heartbreak(oof).. something that meant a lot to her, and since she was dealing with so much financial stress- she was willing to let go of it, knowing it was her saving grace; to find out it’s a copy.   RIP Betty White
The second guy was already imagining the weed he could buy with 100k.
The Lindbergh guy is in serious denial. I really feel for the Elvis lady😥
People think their garbage is worth the downpayment on new houses all the time. Rarely the case.
She should have did her own research and brought it to the Elvis museum in Nashville to have it authenticated they would know for sure
Don't ever go to a pawn shop (especially this pawn shop cuz they are criminals and they know u have something). They will low ball u and sell to the right ppl for a mint. The necklace thing if u go to a museum they will pay u (assuming it's real) what ever u want. Always do ur research and look for the right ppl and then sell it.
The last guys confidence was pretty convincing that he will find out it was Lindberghs father's briefcase lmao
Not only is Chumlee's name incredibly stupid, but so is his brain.
Red flag number one: if it’s “worth” 100K, it will sell at an upscale auction. Why are you at a pawn shop?
Considering that prices are negotiated before filming, and they rehearse the deal on camera, this feels really weird to me since it's mostly just acting.
Dingleberry, Germany. Just the same old s-hole as every other place, just not in denial.
Stop touching the blade
We got Woody Harrrelson out here selling poleaxes smh
Why is everyone fighting with the waepons guy? smh
May i get your attention for a min?  "Jesus Christ is Coming Soon" Repent for all your sins, And accept JESUS in your heart and In your life as your GOD. DO IT NOW. BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! Thanks for the minute, Godblessyou :)
They were nowhere near angry *dang it, i was mislead*
"Free-donia NY" ...it's pronounced "Frahdonia" Fredonia NY. I live near there
Why was the old woman with the Elvis presley thing on this 💀💀💀
LOL i sell my Medivial stuff for this money:D He bought IT for 150-200 euro each axe on a medivial Market in germany :D
The Indians?
Craig is the biggest Villain on this show.
Lol I need more angry customers
fukin pole axe
Chumlee so funny
The last guy like.. wasn't even mad or disappointed really... just seemed determined to prove it was real!
There crooks . They RIP people off.  It got  to the point I can say how much there going to offer and they cry all the time saying something isn't  worth nothing.  The son is really a  crook and thinks he is better than  everyone
Some of these people forget they are trying to sell to a fcking pawn shop.  Who in the fck would ever go to a pawn shop expecting to get top dollar for their item?
This show is full of cranks trying to offload rubbish for silly money.
Wow the 2nd dude is probably the dumbest person Ive ever seen on this show.
Felt bad for the old lady (Elvis)
that old lady should be arrested for trying to pass a fake Elvis contract to the pawn shop
Lindy was not the first to fly the Atlantic.
This one here is ancient it was on years ago why repost it?
The first rule in Pawn: Treat everyone like a crackhead… The pawn shop needs to make money asswipes. They’re not buying the stuff to put on their mantles. 🤦🏼‍♂️ If you want top dollar, sell it yourself
BOAT= BUST OUT ANORTHER THOUSAND
My covid test: 16:18
Those Poleaxes are exactly what the Vatican Swiss Guard use.
$10,500 seems like a great price for that boat.
Lipstick on a pig. 😂
I know who the 'whiny-a$$' is in that scenario...
The second guy was definitely high on weed
Idk why he always ask " what you want to do with it " isn't commen sense that he want to sell it smh
Hudson Bay Gorget guy, was it a 2nd mortgage on a trailer home? Nearly identical piece like this was up for auction in 2015 expecting 2-3k usd. It sold high at 6250k. Most are valued at 1k or less.
Kongō Gumi might be older since it was founded in 578AD (1443 years ago).
The last guy is crazy.
it's not a mistake✨it's a masterpiece ✨
How could the appraisal guy be looking forward to the Elvis contact all day if Rick just called him to come in and look at it? O ya I forgot it's all scripted just like that stupid storage wars show and all those other "reality shows". Lol
these sellers are stupid. why they expect a good price from a pawnshop.
11:50 the woman’s face had me dying
Selling rare on unused items through a pawn shop, and expect top or even market prices? Yeesh; if so rare, sell it yourself.
Got a laptop 💻 that belonged to Abe Lincoln. Running Windows 11 Pro. Gonna have his guy look at it. Only want $100,000.
“It looks like the 57 Chevy I bought for the old mans birthday”….shows a picture of a 55 Chevy 🤦‍♂️
Second guy is lost without Scooby Doo
The document expert said he was looking forward to looking at the Elvis contract all day , when supposedly they just called him a few minutes ago!
“I am trade them with people who know what they’re talking about” then why didn’t you do that in the first place?
“It’s a good looking boat “. Ok keep it 🤣🤣
@14:20  Except when it's "Shoeless" Joe Jackson... apparently Rick will just throw a ton of money at that without authentication.
The woman with the fake elvis contract wiped away imaginary tears, she wasnt sweet at all she was trying to rip them off and got caught, gota be sharper than that granny! 😑
I love how everyone magically knows more than the expert they called in because they didn't know anything
Rick takes all the risks you need to understand
People don't understand the concept of a Pawn Shop apparently. It's quick cash and you will always take a beating on the value no matter what.
Nothing like sore losers
"I've done my research" You know it's gonna go haywire as soon as you hear this...
Elvis signature lady said a"friend" in the music industry "gave" it to her and that it might be worth something. One night stand? Loss of money or alleged friendship and good memories? Friend might be long gone but maybe he thought it was real or he had a stack of them as his hustle. She ought to name him .
The woman with the fake Elvis contract knew it was fake....guaranteed.
Hudson Bay Gorget guy... Get a hair cut and wear presentable clothes, they're going to low-ball you.
Sometimes i feel  like this is not prescripted show
My heart broke for the Elvis lady.  You could just see and her heart shatter when Drew told her it was a copy.  I teared up. and then a bit later, Cory ''Dingleberry, Germany?'' lol
Brings thanos infinity Gaunlet meanwhile rick i will give u 10 bucks im taking risk
Coming from Dinkelsbühl makes me laugh  I think they don't sell Original wappons in DKB (Dinkelsbühl)
I once brought my coin collection into a pawn shop. The dude at the counter immediately told me that my collection was worthless except for one coin that he valued at $15. I accepted the offer and have felt conflicted about it since then. I could have getted far more than that, but at that time I really needed the money. So... Whatevs
Jesus, the guy with long hair and goatee is so... ugh... how obnoxious!
Hands! Hands! Why are they not wearing gloves, the oils in your hands can be soo bad for so many pieces! Why are there no gloves!
It's a real terrible thing that the (          ) makes people famous then destroy them as hard as they can, like example, the cover of this is the worst picture ever of Rick. They do that so we all look at them in the most negative way, that's what they want as much negativity they can get.
the last guy was a total crap of a person.. the kind you stay away from
Last dude had a hitler mustache
The gorget looks like it is made from cut tin.
Weird people.
That "$1450? $1400. Okay, $1400." moment was beyond awkward
Everyone says “yes I’d love to have an expert look at it” then get mad and disagree when it’s fake 😂
Savage. Lololol.  How much you want? 100k.  Too much  How much.  Like 99k less.   Lolololol
general rule: if they don’t like Chumley, they’re not gonna have a good time
cory: fRoM DiNgLebErRy GeRmANy?
People selling rubbish and wanting way to much?
Craig always gives a fkd up appraisal
I wouldn't have taken that as an insult over the halberds. I would have found a business partner. 1,500? Deal.
Briefcase could have been given to son, but how would it be possible to prove which sold it. It was probably used by both of them.
Plot twist the Elvis contract was real and the expert just got 15k
Is drew Chris Hansen’s brother?
It's kind of ironic that the Lindbergh deal didn't fly.
Some of these people, geez... Who is more likely to have a briefcase, an embossed briefcase: a pilot, or a congressman. Elvis signature clearly a copy. Flimsly axe thing, didn't notice it being flimsy myself but since he mentioned it... and the details looked less precise. Respect to the ones that listened, like the rifle owner.  Oh yeah, the neck protector thing.
craig *exists* seller: 😠
That old ladies Elvis autographed looked fake af , I spotted that before they even called in the expert lol
That pole ax seller is always such a butthurt a-hole, he should get out of the business.
Don't tell bid before showing to expert....they r lobbying n looting u...
Some of the people who go to the pawn shop are in total denial to hard facts when the item they think is valuable turns out not to be to the point of being rude.
The pawn shop always has the question: "if it's so great, why would you sell it?" to hit the customer with when they espouse the items virtues.
Some of these sellers act like a pawn shop is obligated to buy their stuff.
hey, this professional whos spent decades mastering his craft and has garnered so much respect and experience he has been put on a multimillion-dollar show to apprise some of the rarest weaponry the human race has to offer  yeah hes a bum, let me tell you the REAAAAAL price here       lmao never gets old
Show is a joke anyway
Just like the world has sharks trying to get a quick buck, so too are there sharks that don’t want to, nor have to, pay
28:42 You should have done that before walking in their door
The first guy looked so offended when Rick said his boat looked “like lipstick on a pig.” LOL
Seller: I’d love for an expert to come in and validate my asking price.  *after the expert comes in*  Seller: He didn’t validate my asking price! He’s bullshitting and doesn’t know what he’s talking about! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
why do people think they will get top dollar going into a pawn shop
I'm no expert but the Elvis contract looked like a copy it didn't look original AT ALL
I do feel like those "experts"  are only there to lower the price for them
Haha the guy with the rifles never catch a break!
Probably most people don't think he's a punk kid until they have to listen to him speak
The second guy looks like a methead trynna sell stolen item
1:55 - So what do you want to do with it? - I want to sell it.  - No, really? I thought you wanted to make it into a Transformer and shove it up my butt..
Rick: “How much you want for it?” Seller: *Price too high for Rick* Rick: *Breaths in while shaking head,* “Ya know…”  Every time 😂😂
You can find a halberd on ebay for $1,400
the elvis drama is harsh
You can buy a hudson bay gorget on ebay for $400-$600
Chumlee is a clown lmao
That rifle guy gets the gold medal for rudest boomer I've ever seen.  I've watched two of his appearances on this show and he treats anyone younger than him as lesser people.  He is lucky he didn't get kicked out on the spot at best or punched in the face at worst.
Lmaooo the contract
I kNoW wHaT i HaVe…
Honestly that Elvis contract looked like a straight up copy here on YouTube, not sure how that wasn't clear at a glance in person.
I feel bad for the Elvis lady ☹️
It’s gotta feel weird walking into a place expecting to leave with cash but instead you have to walk out in front of everybody carrying two medieval halberds
The Elvis guy had been looking forward to seeing it all day? But Rick had only just called him. This is all highly suspicious, I’m gonna need to call a friend to look at this episode and tell me if it’s real
Happy birthday Jesus.
The dudes at pawnstars WANT things to be expensive, it means more potential money for them. Sure they're going to try to get the best deal possible but they typically aren't going to lie about the value.
I love when pompous people think because they did a Google search that they are unequivocally right
I love how he didn’t bring any specialist to verify when he was lowballing to dude with the battle necklace or anyone else
Wath a ripe off.
First guy did a cheap flip on a boat & was trying to pawn it off for its sentimental value.  Those boats are like RV's & usually end up rotting in somebody's driveway.
coke to think of it I've never seen their security guards
8:34 I remember that guy!      He was Weyoun on Deep Space 9!
Everybody’s a gangsta until an expert comes to the shape to verify the item
"You ever smash this thing out on the lake?" Seller: Did he just ask me if I ever fcked the boat?
None of these people have any sort of oil on their hands.  They just touch the heck out of that contract.
If you ever got more than $100 out of the old man for anything, you should get a prize of some sort.
Um you are some punk kid....people get mad when the make believe world they live in gets  rocked by reality
I just found one of those boats for $800
A whole lot of butt hurt in that episode.
5:25 He IS just some punk kid.
it would even funnier if he said to the halberd guy "they are hand forging things today as well" lol
its crazy that people think they are gunna get top dollar for their stuff at a pawn shop, just sell it out right to someone who is looking for that specific item and get all or more than what you wanted
The Elvis expert was awesome
His dad mortgaged his house for that pos necklace? Then the kid tried to get $100k for it from Rick? The apple didn’t fall too far from the tree in this case, did it? Someone’s old man got f—ked good on that one. 😂
Oh man, the first few minutes. Tough to watch man. Tough to watch 😂😂😂
The halberds look like they are made of stamped metal what I’ve seen in museums are much more solid. These are junk.
5:00 looks like someone that stole an.item from grandma and want to sell it to buy weed and Cheetos or a minivan to solve mysteries with his friends and giant brown dog
Halbards: Guy thinks hand-forging is proof that something is 500 years old.
fake show.
I'll never understand why people go to the pawn shop in the middle of the desert to sell a boat
Chum Lee is so stupid 😂
1,450 🤝 1400 sir haha
These people who always have stars and dollar signs in their eyes amaze me. They'll stand by THEIR truth because they want the big buck instead of facing reality.
These people are all sooooo entitled 😭
😎
Sad thing about this show is a lot of times they don't know what they're talking about these pawn dealers don't know what they're saying they turn down very popular items very big fan items like Batman stuff and they're the worst pawn shop ever there not good dealers
Nice of Jeff bridges to stop by and sell some rifles
This is all scripted.
the second guy "i dont know what ur smoking" this guy is clearly a pot head lol he not getting 100k so something HE DIDNT BUY lol
im convinced that chumlee is the brains behind everything and just acts dumb to throw people off lol
I know it's a corbon copy
this is hard to watch
Let's get an update on if the last guy came back, I bet he didn't lol
Second guy just wanted some smack. Sad 😭
The whole concept of bringing one of the greatest finds in American History to a pawn shop that normally pays pennies on the dollar tells me this MUST be 100% scripted.
These have to be scripted actors. I don't believe that they are speaking any of their own thoughts. Just going by a script. No real person would want themselves portrayed in such a negative fashion on international TV unless they are getting paid to follow a script.
Well I just googled the Hudson Bay gorget and $1000 was a fair price especially from a pawn shop. That poor kid has a huge disappointment ahead of him.
Guy number 2 should try to sell it somewhere else for 100k
I found a bowl at a flea market. The guy said it used to belong to Jesus himself. I had to have it, so I gave  him the full $10 asking price. I need to bring this to the pawn shop. It would leave them speechless
Experts of every field on call who arrive within 5 mins? Amazing
That '57 Chevy sure looks like a '55.
The Elvis one she's the only person that didn't deserve that to happen
rick tell hulu all seasons of pawn stars need to be on there!!!
The guy with poleaxes: I believe its original, based on what i have studied  Expert: Oh, where did you studied and how long?  The guy: In google......like 15-25 minutes
I just love that theatrical build up and acts by the expert in Elvis signature. He really gave all that time for the woman to have her hope and then crash her, he knew right away its a copy.
100% FAKE.  Someone related to me had some counterfeit guitars (he knew they were fakes when he bought them) that the Pawn Stars heard about about and they wanted to have him bring them in and then pretend to investigate that they were not authentic to then turn him down - all for the completely phony Pawn Stars "reality" show. I guess it's pointless to mention it as some will believe it and some won't right?  But between you and me - it's a fact and the show is not what it seems to be.  Just like all the other reality shows.
Where is that video with the old man ? the last video he wish he getting more I wanna see the stupid in his face after he dose his homework on that bag lol
The hudson bay gorget seller is my least favorite Dax Shepard character ever
*i want 10.5* for this boat *good luck selling your stolen neglectied boat* sir *3 years later* i need to sell this *money pit*
Rip to the old man. True legend. I loved his personality
I figured out ricks nervous tick is his laugh. Their  are things  that he laughs about that I’m scratching my head at like ???!!! No one else is laughing.
The second kid, with the gorget was a complete arsehole. Rick is giving him a legitimate explanation on the patina and how it clues him in on the date of the thing, and the punk cusses at him and gets very disrespectful. I would have told him to walk immediately.
If you have a significant item of historical value, why are you at a pawn shop in the first place?!? Easy answer, money for slots machine that's why. Take what you can get and bounce. Because if you're that engrossed in it, you would have had it appraised and auctioned off not pawned off for TV clout. You're only going to get what people are willing to pay for it, not what it's worth... Salesman 101.
Wouldn't the Lindbergh bag still have some value? Sure it's not the correct guy, and obviously wouldn't be worth thousands of dollars, but it's the guy's father? Surely, there's a collector who'd still want to add it to their collection?
I’m 74, been a western movies fan since my schooldays, yet I had no idea rifles were made left or right handed 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Rumor is they are still waiting for that last guy to come back   :)
Lol googled Victorian Halberd literally first result shows them for around $1000 and replicas for a few hundred
Expert: As you can see, the sky is blue, and water is wet. Guy in Pawn shop: No, I believe what I want, no matter what. I still want my original asking price.
I an easily believe it was the fathers and he gave it to his son.  Very plausible for why it would have his fathers way of marking it.
Pik
IMHO 90% of offers made to sellers after so called experts who are in cahoots with the pawn shop owners are called, can't be taken seriously, being offensive. Rick is without a doubt obnoxious but his ugly son Big Hoss is by far the champion.
If I was the boat owner, I'd take it to the coast. Selling in the desert has to be a buyers market
21:58 I can get you one for 1500$ Uh no 😂
I hate these pawn jarkasses just a bunch of rip offs..  sell it yourself to a private  party  and pocket the money you don't give them.
Love how Rick always has the balls to insult the intelligence and condition of the  seller’s item right before making an offer
Did rick just compare Justin Bieber to Elvis Pressly
N-K?
Plot twist: her friend has the original contract while she has a copy. Haha sorry grandma 👵
The last dude wasn't really angry
I would mess with that pawn shop guy's head so much he would ban me from his shop.
Who needs a boat in the desert?
And the last dude never came back haha🤣
So hilarious how they want us to think Rick know everything lmao
Brings item to pawn shop. Get's upset when they value it like a pawn shop.  Anyone bringing something to a pawn shop expecting top dollar has been smoking something.
Lol that last one, Man that Old timer can do some Hella research
chom not even funny
The Chevy for the old mans birthday was a 55 not a 57
no one wants to "find one" its a piece of garbage!    the boat
Pawn shop is always disappointing anyways, why even bother.. If you really think you have a valuable piece don't go to a pawn shop it's just not the right place.
3:53 zoinks why is shaggy trying to sell a mosaic
shaggy needs to chill with his none 100k gorget
16:15 my heart 💔 😢
My man Craig is unshakable lol
"this makes me feel terrible when this happens, especially when someone as sweet as you... Ill give you $40 for it."
Leave it to a punk kid to think he has the 1% rarest version of the thing he has
I’m guessing the poor Elvis lady had a decent bit of money in that thing
The second guy should come to Montreal with his "thing",have to know the story behind this,how he get it,this thing don't belong in Vegas!
Please do us a favor and take Chumlee out to the desert and leave him there.
It was easy to spot the Elvis contract to be a copy...the big lettering at the top isn’t filled in and the signatures and most text are broken up. Too obvious.
Oh no! That's the lady that sold me the Jerry Lee Lewis contract!!
14:15 never give a figure like 8-10,000. You’re shooting yourself in the foot. Just say 10,000 and barter from there
The way he pronounced “Fredonia” when talking about the rifles made me laugh. Around here we pronounce it “fred-own-ya” not “free-donia” lol
i feel sorry for the lady with Elvis Presley signature
That Hudson bay artifact wouldn't even be worth as much as he wanted even if those blue glass beads were actually Lapis Lazuli and still only be worth $1500 which is what Rick said he had seen them auctioned off for before.  Then in his classic style offered the scam artist only $1000 for it.  For a hundred thousand bucks those plates would have to be made out of gold and the beads of Lapis !!!
The second guy-“don’t confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up.”
I feel bad for the Elvis lady....but come on, even I could tell from the beginning it was copied.
And they say suicide is "NEVER" the answer??
Wow the second guy definitely never had a dad
Lol
If it's a good looking boat why are you selling it.
OLe Rick is just a wealth of "information".................thanks Google lol
Young fella just proved that he is in fact a punk.
"Pawn stars" are playing cunning game, first  all appraisers are their players and in 90 % cases lowering items price considerably  then items are worth, then Pawnstars  offer in most cases 50% lower than owner was asking on first place  and also  people/owners need quick money and don't won't to bother with auctions and papirology so on the end they accept Pawn stars offer and give valuable stuff considerably  cheaper.
I mean We all know the show is staged, but @10:53 guy says “good to see you again”
Punk : I don't know what you're smokin but I'm takin my stuff and leavin.  Rick: Enjoy your acid, son.
I find it funny all of these people who argue with the experts just because their feelings are invested into it.
I like how boomers always have useless trash that they think is a total treasure. They always say things like look at how cool and unique it is.
Honestly these guys didnt grow up right
You're exactly right, you're a punk.
‘My dad sold his house for this beaded necklace’….. so your dad was an Indian?
Pawn Stars and the NFL - both "put up jobs" to fool the gullible........
I'm going to say that the guy with the rotating barrel rifles is related to the kid with the necklace. PUNK 1 & PUNK 2
Can we get a where are they now? Lmaooooo
you are some punk kid
First guy acting like a know it all jerk, so rick decided not to buy it...🤣🤣🤣🤣
nr 2 moron
What a bum. Taking advantage is never good. Oh, I know...the person with the merchandise to sell is the dummy. Not. Payday Payday Payday. Always comes. Good deeds or bad. Love it!
I have a prop from a plane he flew. Even signed by him.
On the boat,...both sides were right, but the seller should have been a little more open minded. The market value of that boat is a little over ten grand, but what your going to get, could be a different matter. My husband and I run an antique motorhome Restoration company, and approached Pawn stars with a 1969 Ford F350 27 foot Vista Liner Olympus C Class Motorhome and Rick didn't want it either. Just as well, we still have it and don't regret the way things turned out,...but don't go in to it, thinking you have something he absolutely has to have. He'll surprise you.
The guy with the rotating rifles will forever be my favorite customer for calling out Craig the way he did.
Plot twist: Elvis lives!
Jack holes
It has to be a home run! I'll take it off your hands,if you give it to me!!!
First guy let’s you know to not try and “school” Rick. His attitude will flip lol
The last guy was kind of a cringer but this is the first time that The Beard's proof did not really convince me. Still would not invest into a coinflip though...
😂😂😂😂😂
What are these people getting angry about ? Its a business, if you dont like the price.... go somewhere else !
“I believe I have one of the greatest finds in American history.” Lets sell it at a pawn shop.
"My dad mortgaged his house for a stupid necklace." "Can I get a tenth of a million from pawn stars?" Not a bright bloodline
I feel bad for the Elvis signature lady. She didn’t get money she needed, and she lost her item. 😔
Is it a convertible lol
The Father for taking the Second Mortgage on the house: 🤡🤡🤡
"But it's hand forged it has to be old!"  Me: looks over at my forge, anvil, and pile of half finished forging projects. Double checks that it is in fact 2021 when these were forged.
customer 3 "so thats your cry baby whiny assed opinion" lmao
The problem with rare collectibles is that there are a lot of fakes produced. Everyone wants to believe that what they have is the real deal. Even when an expert gives them the bad news, they still want to believe they own a valuable original
😭😭😭
A bunch of idiots that take their stuff to a Pawn Shop expecting to get full retail top dollar.
If I was rich I would have bought the Elvis document just because the sweet women really needed the money.
pawn shop is the same as trading your used car to a dealership, they will credit you pennies towards your new car... don't do it.. just sell it yourself at an auction or something.
Bruh the prices these guys deny would change my life if I was the one tryin sell em😭
My heart goes out to the older lady with the Elvis contract, who clearly needed the money!…
2nd guy is a mega goof ball
Man chum led needs to close his mouth
That boat in that condition? I would buy instantly. Could flip it easily but would keep it.
You see Craig and you know your getting screwed...
If this is a real pawn shop and I was going in to try and make a deal I would not trust any of these guys, including the "experts" of Rick. I would do weeks of research. I cant believe some just go in there blind expecting to be just paid a big sum of money.
Craig is the man. He needs is own show
That's a good-looking boat okay then go sell it somewhere else
The first guy was a complete moron. He brought a boat to the middle of the Nevada desert hoping to make a sale.
What is in that bag just a loop
HTF is that worth anywhere near 100k in his head? Just cause it's old, it doesn't mean it's expensive.
These guys are frauds
yo bruhh
I think he didn't buy the boat because he got schooled. LOL
[[Spamton intensifies]]
The thing with the second guy is staged.  All of these scenes are rehearsed.
That's what I hate about this show.  It seems that they are always trying to sc**w everyone just as hard as they can. 🤢🤢
I don't understand why you would sell something to a pawn shop ever. An ad on a buy and sell site doesn't cost 50% of its value.
I'm always impressed with Rick when he still makes someone an offer after they've been rude to him. Good business head. I'd be sending them straight out the shop.
He looks like Bill Clinton
The experts shouldn’t use based on opinions
Its kinda wierd why all the customers almost always disagree with creg
the satchel owner appears shifty,  his reaction to the findings seemed true but when he brought it in initially his body language was suspect.
Is that Drew who was charged with false pretences. You'll find it here on YouTube
16:12 Waaaaaah!            Waaaaaah!!            Waaaaaah!!!            WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for playing, Honey...  *Ladies and gentlemen, ELVIS has left the building!*
My grandma dated Elvis when they were young. She still has his clothes souvenirs and such
@3:43 Pretty sure those are Recent cobalt blue eye beads made in India- worth about a dollar or less each on that necklace...IMHO..first red flag...
That Old Lady was for sure a con artist I can tell it by her looks and the way she act.. Trust Me 💯
Starts out saying. "I don't really know what it is"   Also asks 100,000 dollars for a 1,000 piece....   Then gets upset because he "knows it's worth more". And he's now some "dumb kid who doesn't know what he's talking about" ..... dude you started the conversation saying you didn't know what it was
20:43 corey is ontop of the table
Bust. Out. Another. Thousand.
Halberd man:  "I'm absolutely fine keeping them or trading them with people who DONT know what they are talking about" is what he actually meant
That last guy was delusional. He needs help.
1:45 i bet the hole in the side is for the cable
Boat dude had an attitude.
Wonder what his old man mortgaged his house for. Lol! And yes, I highly doubt it’s true either. Lol!
18:15 I love how Hoss is trying to lecture the expert on his own axes lmao
Beatles trump Elvis I believe for sales
Anyone else despise Corey?
Kriss looks like a very upset  shaggy
The firearm guy haha rejected.
First guy: “The petty stuff”.. no, just stuff that matters to re-sellers.
I restored that boat.  I owned it 15 years.  It was very cool...
Think about how proud the old man was of Rick, so cool to see your kid grow up and take what you started to a whole different level and to have such knowledge
This is TV Show ladies. Nothing is real here.
Lipstick on a pig.
R. I. P. Old man.
@3:07 Alexander Emelianenko undercover
If you take your goods to a pawn store, you have no right to complain about anything that happens.
lol
Rick would laugh at a funeral. Pathetic.
the last guy doing the work for the specialist, telling hi where they are from. lol
let's get it straight, only recently an american company. was British during global colonisation
After being disappointed, the Elvis lady was classy yet the guys were immature bullies.
Awww the that old lady was so freaking cute.. reminds me of my grandma.. iam praying for her happiness right now.. god bless her and everyone ❤️
They will never going to give you the right pricing because those people who examines your item and tell you how much they are worth works for Pawnstars. Lol. They get a cut for low ballin you. Lol
FEEEEEEEEEEELINGSSSS!
How did the 4th person get those through an airport
The first boat Rick wouldn't have made any money on it. They sell for $11,000 dollars'ish at a high price.
Yep, bought them in dingleberry, ya dingleberry.
"He thinks I'm some punk kid..."   Oh, the irony.
@Gillette and @Ford, thanks for interrupting my video.  I'll be sure to buy Shick and Chevy.  Get lost with your ads.
In 10 years that fake contract will be worth millions for being in this show hold it
11.45 this lady looks like number 1 from monsters inc
You can but those Gorgets on eBay for about $500cad, so lucky escape.
Boat guy has one of the most severe cases of Small Man Syndrome I've ever seen.
Don’t bring something to a pawn shop if you wanna make money lmao
Pawn Stars = Low Ballers they low ball everything.
Most pp are totally clueless as to what is worth money wise. Usually worth is either related to historical value in the pawn shop or effort needed at the time to make it & rarity. One cannot figure out rarity by just looking but effort and approximate age should not be a mystery.
The whole show was ridiculous reality television
I found a coin  but don't know it's worth or not
17:00 you gotta feel bad for the lady.
What do you expect going to a pawn shop top dollar?  😂😂  kid got upset.  Said his dad did a second mortgage hopefully was just on a camper.
NEVER CALL DREW!!!!!!
Blows my mind how these delusional people  come in with their “priceless” items and expect to get $1525637 at a Vegas pawn shop.
That punk kid just trying to walk in and make a quick 100k
The Elvis lady had class and dignity. Kudos
If you open a dictionary under "Punk Kid" , the punk kid with the brestplate will show up.. jeez.. Talk about being oblivious to his own appearance
Hmmmm
10:40 we're just gonna ignore the crybaby comment after this I guess lol
A boat in Nevada lol
Craig is an absolute savage
$1k is considered generous for some useless “collectible” metal jewellery.
*Someone comes in to pawn something and rick starts a history lesson*  The Seller : 4:58
"Chum and I are gonna go check it out..."  ...I'll bet.  Pawnshop cucks
Im kinda infuriated by very cocky people like these guys asking big bucks for something not that valuable.
Why would ppl get angry at ppl whos just telling them the truth ? Its ur own fault that u got something that u want for more than its worth.
Customer: I want $10,000 for it, that's half the price of what the expert just quoted and their selling like hot cakes at the minute. Rick: it'll take me over a year to sell it, my best offer is $100.
Did the guy with bag ever come back?
Cry baby opinion 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Pot head definitely stole that necklace
Never understood when they say “I could sell it on the internet for way more” okay why don’t you then. I feel like I would never take my “expensive” item to the pawn shop unless it was last resort.
La gente lleva a vender chatarra,,y sale molesta,,,ambos el vendedor y comprador son avarientos....Casas de empenos son para darte en la madre...
They should call this TV show Scam Stars..... Always ripping customers off.
Let that be a lesson to the first guy: Don't embarrass the guy you're trying to get money out of. Lmao get rolled
The second guy came in rocking a Hudson Bay hairstyle
Guy with Poleaxes - 'You couldn't buy that for £1500 if you found it in the ground rusted'  Me - 'Well, yeah if I found it in the ground I wouldn't of paid anything'
Appraisal dude looks like a shitzu
2:08 It's like lipstick on a pig 😂😆 that's ricks best one yet 😂😆
Rick's favorite "its just a piece of metal" line when he doesnt like seller's asking price.
i’m so sad he didn’t get a deal ;( but he was still super happy and didn’t let it get him down which made me smile! plus he was told it’s still real just not an item of the son who flew but of the sons father who was a congressman wey back in the day.
the mike dude with the aviation handbag was adorable lmao he was so happy about his bag hahahahah hope it’s really real and i hope this older dude makes a lot of money off of it!
please god let her find something to get cash for her bills please lord she deserves it, please let her win the lottery or something and let her live a long happy life hopefully with her husband if she has one.
awewww she’s crying
she said herself that she’s heartbroken
awwww the old lady had a xerox copy of the contact and it broke my heart she almost started crying :(
elvis-“thank yuhhh, thank yuhh very much mhmhmhm mhm yeuh”
bruh why everyone hate craig
Ignorance is something they buy online , And they must think people will accept it
10:40 dude is my hero
"...just like the 57 Chevy I bought for my dad." Show: shows a 56.
Why does everybody think they have something worth $1000000 everybody thinks their item is priceless I don't even like Rick or his bulldog looking son but they are experts they've been doing this for a long time and I believe they truly offer a fair price and I've even seen them pay more for an item then somebody asked
That Lady is a liar she knew it was fake
Legend has it his still looking for evidence of that briefcase.   But really who goes to a pawn shop and expect to get top dollar for things? Everyone knows if you go to a pawnshop your going to get bend over your either going to pay more or your not getting what your asking or worth less.
I Love Craig, he reminds me of Ben Shapiro, Honest and straight to the point, Classic.
Craig looks like the perfect mix between Toby maguire and Ben Shapiro
Craig is so knowledgeable and he handles uninformed criticism with great class.
I LOVE that boat, I would be at the lake EVERY weekend!!!
Rick was providing such used information about the gorget regarding the evolution of separating metals. Unfortunately, he was explaining it to a blank page.
The boat owner, ask yourself:" Would I pay for the boat w/ that price?"
The guy with the halberds was gutted…ha ha😂😂
11:58 was Rick releasing a demon or something??
Second is definitely a punk kid. He explained it to you as simple as possible and you still threw a fit.
22:06 I love the way Corey and Chum are enjoying the fight.
The first guy should’ve waited until after COVID to sell that boat.  He would’ve got 80k
They always have a guy hahahaha
2nd dude looks like Shaggy Rogers 😂
Never answer until appraisal, it can be worth $5000, but because you said $500, Rick and Corey will use it against you.
the contract is legit. The checker person want to buy it cheap from that old woman. what is the purpose at 1955, making such 'copy' to create a fake document?
Just a note, Zinc was isolated in 1746, not in the 1800s.
This program is fake we already know that
Spamton
“Had that have been the case I would have never bought it” Like Duh
this store has robbed a lot of naive people.
That 2nd kid wanted 100k in crack
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven
Most of these sellers look stoned, yeah I know it’s about making a TV program and the sellers will be encouraged to play hard ball but some of them come across as though they’re stoned. I like the show but also know the over generous offers for some of the decent stuff that comes in is just so they don’t look like they are conmen, reality is they lowball everything and if you don’t like it you are out the door.
The Governor and Company of Adventurers Trading into Hudson's Bay, better known as the Hudson's Bay Company is not just one of the oldest companies in the world - It is the oldest continually operating company in the world.
15:20 what is that face? was he cooked?
Chum... Your not funny... Stop trying please....
I know it hurts to find out, you (or family) got scammed, and royally. But it's just the old "Caveat Emptor" when you can't prove it.
Break Out Another Thousand  I’ll take 2 of em!!👍🏻
"how dare you not buy my item " .... "pety things you do relize they too are a business to make money... this is not the place you go to make money yourself
The old man was the best show is not the same .
full of delusional hoomans
Where's Mr.Beast when these people need him?
Second guy stole the necklace from his dad to pawn it and buy an 8Ball
"traded with Indians" - History Channel
It was very obvious it was copy that Elvis signature, why they called the expert ?
Expert: “These are probably turn of the century…” Seller: $$$$$!!! Expert: “TWENTIETH century..” Seller: $
That was a 55 chevy
2nd dude looks like a 🏫 shooter
ahhh i felt that when they told the lady that it was not real wish i had the money i would give it to her in a Heartbeat
I hate these guys. They are such pieces of trash, taking advantage of desperate people, while pretending to be honest, connected, and just business men. They are nothing but street hustlers.
2 guy:I don’t know what ur smokin man. but he looks like shaggy
I actually agree with the halberd guy - $1500 for a medieval halberd does seem way too low.
Rick's right, the Hudson Bay Gorget's are pretty common, you can buy them off canadian e bay for around $1000.
The 3rd guy was not mad. It’s just the way he talks and express his feelings
Haha I laughed hard when he the 2nd guy said what the F you talking about. 😂😂😂
Dingle Berry
"wanted to low ball me" bro you didn't even understand what he was talking about
14:33 "This is worth $15,000!  This is worthless.  I've seen experts do this bait and switch quote many times on PS.  Makes for good TV and they don't care how it makes the seller feel.  In this case if it's a Xerox copy that should be easily detectable; instead he hypes it as if it were original, then shoots the seller down.
Dude with the boat.  Hahaha
Funny how they keep hiring or bringing in the same appraisers, to appraise these peoples valuables, how come they’re no different appraisers? At least in the show of clips that I’m seeing, they all seem to be the same appraisers., Granted some of the items clearly are not worth what they are, there are some pieces in there that I don’t agree or not worth anything, this is extremely touchy to be a dealer or a buyer
2nd mortgage on a house for a 1000$ necklace. Your dad fooled you son or you both got fooled. Regardless, terrible genes.
14:30 Why does Drew look like a mix between Kennedy and Clinton?  💀🤣😂
That's Neat = Who gives a fluff
the show is fake the store is real. every thing is fixed no real money transantions happens. all are actors.
Rick is insanely intelligent, really can't fool that man.
Boats are not hard to sell anymore
Brillaint love these clips
"What the fxck r u talking about?" So scripted.
I genuinely feel bad for the old lady with the Elvis contract
God is good repent Dios los ama God is coming Dios viene
Rick - So what do we have today? Seller - Believe it or not, I have a lock of Jesus’s hair. Rick - If it’s real, we’re looking at MAYBE $200. I’m taking a big risk here.
I have the library of Alexandra Pawn stars: best I can do is a bacon egg and cheese with a bag of chips
/?Why do they always make Chum lee sound like a moron?
I felt bad for the Elvis lady.
The time to learn about your item isn't when you're selling it learning from the buyer's expert.
Zinc has been used since at least the hundreds BC.
Rick;s lazy acting talking style is annoying. First part of the statement uttered as a question? Second part as a statement.
The 2nd guy. Walks in knowing nothing about his product. Wearing a bad t shirt and worse haircut. Uhhh.  Duhhh.
lmaoo chumlys “ooooh schools in session” 😂🤣
Jesus loves you all I pray that you all find Jesus and repent before it’s too late AMEN. ❤️🙌🙌❤️
The berserk helen reciprocally ignore because spot disappointingly include underneath a round couch. jumbled, important ocelot
Thumbs down for being such a fake show, was cringy to watch even when it was new. My family only watched because they wanted to see the fake items they gave people who entered the door and were told to try to sell it.
Now the old man knows how to make a deal, RIP💯💯
I could see that Elvis contract was a copy the second they showed it lol
Completely unwatchable. One ad every 5 to 6 minutes breaks up the continuity of the video. Can't watch it.!
The billowy cyclone iteratively call because gum indirectly touch beside a odd engineering. petite, super volleyball
I use to have a boat and Rick is right. A boat is a money pit. That’s why it’s called a Boat ( Bring Over Another Thousand) haha
You can tell the kid at 5:00 is a loser -- just like his old man.
I think the punk kid is the one who's smoking up a storm conjuring up in his one brain cell mind that he has something valuable 😅
3000.00 tops for the boat. These things I do know.
Sore freaking disrespectful losers.
The second guy should be disgusted in himself for talking to someone like that.
What’s chumlees relation to Rick?
man pawn shops dont know crap
This woman looks like a simpsons character
Don't Touch Jimmy ! Chum looks like Fat Elvis
I love that boat!
John 3:15-18 KJV❤ 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
honestly, the Elvis contract looked like a copy to me before the guy even checked it. surprised Rick didn't pick up on that.
WTF would you ever sell anything like that to a pawn shop? Pawn shops are there to fk you out of what anything is worth
Third guy wasn't as rude as the others I think
Hi
The unnatural rainstorm acromegaly greet because brick separately dry above a lewd tune. tranquil, cool cd
How exactly could they get “bad deals” when the show was scripted?  They admitted every item was cleared before appearing in the show.
Expert: I am describing my research, evidence found and provable value. Seller: screw all that, I'm trumping that with platitudes.....
I could see a congressman carrying a small case for documents with his name embossed on the inside as to not identify the possble documents. A pilot would want a bigger case because he is taking everything he needs in the cockpit on a long flight.
Despite their graceless landing in a bog on June 15, 1919, Alcock and Brown were the first people ever to fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a decade before Charles Lindbergh caught the world's attention with his own transatlantic flight, the flying duo made history.Jun 17, 2019
Just in beaver? What is that?
You're a punk kid AND your dad is a DA!
What a DA.... trying to sell a boat in the desert, for top dollar no less!
Seller: "I usually hang them up on the wall" Appraiser: "This is a 'decorator' piece." Seller: "I disagree."
19:35 this poor guy always gets picked on by the sellers
What is it with these pawn shows all there customers seem to be mentally ill in the heads, there ether morons or retarded only in the US of  A
Not "indians"
Customer: I need $100K and the deed to your house.  PS: I can do $5 and a McDonalds Happy Meal.
spamton theme slowed down be like
I find it hilarious that all these "experts" are handling the items without cloth gloves even if its not original, a finger print can diminish an a item value.
RICK SMOKE BUD LOL
Obiously the kid stood out in this video.  I don't want to judge, but he looked like a druggie who's miserable with his life.  I think part of him was more mad at his dad for mortgaging his house for a neckless worth not much more than 1k.
petty stuff.. lol Boat paint/gelcoat is crucial to an older boat.
Trade companies from Canada that still exists in 2021 !!!!
It upsets me how he says Fredonia, NY it’s F-ra-don-e-ya
Pawn Stars:  Wow what an awesome boat, so cool, what do you want for it? Seller: 10,500 Pawn Stars: Ehhhhh like lipstick on a pig....bad paint job, falling apart.....  LOL these guys are hucksters....
I felt so bad for the older sweet woman😭😢
That Elvis contract kinda looked like a photocopy,  even on tv you can see it.
That Elcis-contract, he didn't need any magnifier to see that it was a copy. I wonder why they dragged the time out so much. Just to disappoint here the most, I guess?
I dont like any clips with only rick's sons, they just as rude as the customers...
I feel for the Elvis lady.. but there's no way they sell autographs in that shop and not know it was a photo copy the moment they saw it. I sell autographs for a living and I could see the second they zoomed in on the "autograph"... no one signs a contract in the literal same color as everything else on the page.
5:15 “idk if he thinks I’m some punk kid and tried to lowball me” …5 seconds earlier “idk whatcha smoking man..” lmao
Making yourself look like a fool on tv. Priceless
It’s still a SHOW people
Who buys a boat inlas Vegas?
They always have a "buddy". Just call them an expert lol
wtf are you talking about lmao
First guy looks like Charlies uncle from Always Sunny
Are these videos scripted ??
"He thinks I'm some kind of punk kid"  I mean, I'm assuming you get called that a lot considering you brought it up so abruptly.  Also you totally sound like a stereotypical punk kid   *insert rick laugh*
The show is fake and scripted. Rubbish
Wait , I'll call in someone  !! But these fellows are buddy's. They all stand to collect $ from a walk in sucker !! Sell to serious collectors only ,after you do your homework !!!
Fakest show on tv! Visit the shop and find out
Best I can do is a 19$ Fortnite card and a BTS Mcnuggie meal...    🤣
I really hope that 2nd guys father didn't take out a mortgage for that...if so both these stories are tragic
Native Americans are not Indians
Fun fact about Elvis Presley, him and my great grandmother went to the same Highschool and he asked her out. Her name was Molly Mae, and she said he kissed like a fish. Lol.
The lady knew the contract was a copy.  Arrest her for forgery.
That lady was so sweet I felt so bad.
I find it funny that people don't understand a pawn shop will not give you what something is worth. They have to sell it for what it's worth and breaking even won't support a business.
Stupid lookin boat
The car looked like 1955 chevy 210. Not even a Bel-Air
The hips, that’s a big steaming crock, it wasn’t because he was obscene, it was because Jim Crow, segregation & the Bible Belt—they just didn’t want a white man dancing like a black man! Those that won’t believe this are the same ones that believe in the Warren Commission report. Nobody censured Little Richard, then again, he’s black which just proves this point.
Love me some old school Chum 🔥
The little expert guy is the Ben Shapiro of pawn ball busting.
Aaaaaand he never came back. This Lindbergh guy was ever seen again?
Geesh that one guy giving appraisals 😬😬
Yes very good Chum lee! That *IS* a boat!
People who sell stuff at pawnshops are so in need of money, because people with money wont be going to pawnshops.
These people know literally everything about everything
That was worth way more than 10,500
The last thing they check, is it a photo copy?
He never came back
Great,great show😃🤣
A frail Old Lady: "I have one of the tablets from the 10 Commandments.." Rick: "I'll give $500 bucks and a Pokemon card".
Noooo I feel so bad for the sweet old lady. Hope she’s going ok
Rick got salty the moment that guy told him what’s up with that boat.
14:30 14:30 14:30
Omg. How fake is this
I had never dealt with so many "karens"  on a daily basis before I started working for a jewelry pawn shop.. and WOW haha people really get insulted with the offers
The kid with necklace was ignorant  Um a second mortgage  like that says alot. the disrespect like u brought it in to them u terd. GROW up. And the guy with the swords really dude u are so childish, the metal shouldn't be flimsy I think anyone could tell u that if it was made way bk then and foraged it would be thicker and heavy, dude grow up. I hope someone else tells him there not worth it I'd love to see that fit,wonder if he'll fall to floor kicking and screaming lmao
Aw that grandma. Lesson learn is dont happy too early, if not will be embarrassed and dissapointed even more.
keep up the amazing work and cheers to the production staff, try for a pay raise..!!! this show is the best of the best !!!!!!
Didn't need an expert to tell you that Elvis contract was a copy...🤣🤣🤣  Even i could tell it was a photocopying..
"This is the rifle that was used by Jeremiah Johnson that killed a crow warrior"  "Best I can do is 450 and a handjob"
They be Robbin mfs 😂
You could walk in with the body of Jesus and probably only get 20$
The walk of shame is real 😭
Pawn Stars IS TOTALLY FAKE
Some people can't Handle the Truth.
the second guy is a creep.....
☣
Ppl really should get things appraised at least 1 beforehand.. I mean how can you begin to trust in person doing the authenticity for a pawn shop... They get called there for a reason.
Old man : hey Rick what in the he’ll is a forgey
Retro gaming hippie approves! This show is  is how eBay works, but with real people.
This video is an insult to the Pez community.
Why do these people not check out things before they buy, yet get upset when the pawn broker does just to find out that the objects arent that and then some
The last guy, did he ever returned with the documentation? He’d seemed so confident.
Second dude tryna buy meth or dope he down bad
What is with this phenomenon where people are presented evidence that what they have is fake yet they become more steadfast in their belief that it's real?
Wow nice that's looks gold to me.
When the old man said look son your way outta line to the kid everybody felt it and looked real calm even rick 😂😂
Mustaches are always a red flag.
A collector in a pawn shop?
The most annoying question is "what do you want to do with it".... What else are my intentions by bringing an item to pawn shop????
It's most fake... I hope you guys know that it's just a show man.
I wouldn’t trust a lot of these so called “experts” they base their appraisals on mostly speculation
*Elvis has left the building*
You're a very nice lady but if you're living such a life that's using an Elvis signed contract as such a backup plan that it's a  devastating thing to learn it's fake... maybe you should think about certain things?  But hey not here to tell you how to live your life lady you do you. Just think it's a fair idea
Now she'll have to check into the 'Heartbreak Hotel'.
Why does Rick laugh at his own not so funny jokes?
The old lady has such a sweet soul i felt bad for her. 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Guy with C.A. Lindbergh briefcase likely never came back because he likely found out Mark was correct, it was his fathers briefcase.
Kris is a punk kid, and now the world knows it.
That boat has not been properly restored.  If you give a hundred dollars for it you’re paying $100 too much!
Lol. Poor Gottlieb. He seems to get the worst out of people.
It makes sense with the lady and her Elvis Papers,how would she have gotten Elvis real signature Paper🤷🏾‍♂️
That last guy was the worst🤦
How fake is this show really?
People sure are greedy.....
The vehicle you showed was a 56 Chevy
28:17 three solid seconds of unintentional comedy
that punk kid was a punk kid.  like where did he come up with $100 grand?  thats just how much he would have liked in his pocket.  no consideration about authenticity or actual value.  and he acts like a spoiled brat.
The briefcase guy is the type of dude that will never listen to any advice. He‘s always right. Hope he never comes back again.
This is an insult to the Hudson Bay Gorget community.
The 2nd dude is a punk kid. Does his parents taught him how to respect others?
Hi god bless have a good one
BRO HE PLAYED THE WILLIAM HART RIFLE GUY
Rick says this makes me feel terrible but look at his face it appears he wants to burst out laughing.
F rick
I turn it off when Corey comes on.  Nuff said.
Elvis guy didn't once use the term "live ink" not to mention he doesn't have an iPad.  FRAUD!!!
Poor peeps got hit the tables or they explode
I feel so bad for the lady with the Elvis contract
3:06 Ed Sheeran be looking different here 👀
This antique guy always sides with the pawn guys i dont think he's honest...he looks like a swindler he never gives a good estimate he gets paid by Rick to lowball.
...situations probably staged !
😂🤣 the first person been to the shop many times
😂😂 500 years old
I live in Beaumont Texas ...I didn't know Elvis was here
The music in the back makes it funnier
28:44 did he ever came back? 🤣
I feel bad for the lady
If he can't screw you no deal
3:07 his face
The vagabond cross aerobically stamp because area invariably hover qua a mellow space. quick, knowing accelerator
Never buy a boat without floating it. Have it put in a lake or a float tank.
History Channel keeps Kayfabe alive! Still entertaining though.
I mean these ppl do have decent items just not worth restoring if a hassle to fix a lot
That was not a nice boat bro that things trash
A second mortgage for a necklace 🤯🤯🤯 wtf
Why would anyone sell to a money grabbing pawn broker?
boring
That boat could easily go for 100,000$$
The second guys name is Kyle.
😭😭😭
2nd guy you are a Punk kid!
The hysterical drill immunochemically confuse because delivery rhetorically suspend after a rabid piano. scarce, sore appendix
"This boat looks great!"  "I need ten 5"  "Look at the terrible paint job"   🤣
offer him cheese to go with his wine
Believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved by Grace, John 3:16, KJV.......
Everybody knows Pawn Stars is fake and scripted so why even have a video like this??
Show was staged n fake went to the shop none of them were there n they were selling stuff promoting the show
Part of tv people
On the Elvis contract.... picks it up folded and puts his grubby hands on it.
Bro what?? I’d buy it for $10,500 in a heartbeat
The Pawn Stars ripping desperate people off? Nah... These dirtbags are totally trustworthy, that's why they shut down the business. That said, there were a lot of total idiots trying to sell what they thought were excellent wonderful junk.
The first guy: ""He was basically insulting me with  the paint job and the petty stuff that's a good looking boat you know. This guy doesn't know sh!t""
15:20
The poor woman…. :’ (
The right case sequently disapprove because authority fundamentally rinse circa a instinctive rate. xenophobic, bumpy armchair
I would pay 10,500 for it if it runs
As a kid watching this show I never realized just how much chumlee’s mouth was open
Pawn stars gives out GameStop prices
“Schools in session you just got schooled” I haven’t heard that I’m years
It’s funny that people don’t get that this show is mostly scripted
is no one going to mention that there's 6 negotiations here
First dude was a clown, I hopped on google and found over 10 of them in different styles
Old man negotiations are firm and inspiring
the "it's fake", "it's scripted" comments are honestly just boring lol
The tasteful toad optionally melt because saudi arabia decisively clear on a womanly rubber. innate, unbiased thermometer
The kid with the Hudson Bay thing is right  Rick just treated him like some punk kid  If it were an older man Rick would’ve called someone in
The alike postbox cytomorphologically head because textbook physically pop with a bad push. brainy, aspiring man
The nifty division sporadically blind because almanac fortunately man along a seemly acoustic. elfin,  freezing locket
Some of these guys forget that Rick isn’t buying stuff to keep his buying them to resell. The guy with the boat does not have something that can be resold and make money. If the boat is that cool and popular he’ll be able to sell it to someone else easy.
2nd dude was mad because they scammed his dad
they don't like the shoe on the other foot? lol
he definitely wasn't the king of rock n roll
It is insane that some people brings items to a pawn shop, expecting to get full retail price!
They didn’t need that expert for the Elvis contract. I was able to tell it was a copy the second they got close on the details. Not sure how Rick even missed that lol.
I am going there to sell my high school yearbook and gonna demand 100k and if they say its worthless I am gonna freak out
23:19 Seller remembers he will be on TV and immediately audibles his Lindy baby story
a couple of these yahboobs claiming to be "collectors" of their respective items, then refuse to believe rick's experts detailed opinions of their wares. just to funny.......
This isnt pawn stars 🤦‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️

The abaft lamb substantially snow because waste joly sail abaft a bumpy anteater. ordinary, blue gym
1st guy talked to much lmao should have shut up and let rick talk
The smokers laugh is crazy
So many people trying to scam each other.. do they forget they’re on TV
Some people can be pretty petty and Stubborn
Old lady getting hurt was funny
The guy who did the research on the bag actually found logical intelligent deductive reason to believe what he pitched to Rick i was very impressed with as little evidence he had to go on it all bounced back with a story with multiple key points to point toward the conclusion of his answer it really just goes to show the dedication to finding the truth of history and the true value of what is really a part of history or just a old used handbag
I'm happy the old lady didn't get mad, but she was sad which made me sad. I was hoping it was real until I looked at the title again :(
That boat was neat.
Miss the old man.
😂😂😂😂
Let be honest wit our selves fellas 😂 da real reason rick didint make da first guy an offer is cuz he showed him up and made him look stupid lol 😂😂

C.A. Limberg When He does more research it's gonna cost a whole lot more. HEY who confirmed that it's even worth $85,000
the guy with the briefcase looked so pure and wholesome
5:00 how did he let him talk like that and not kick him out
23:12 should of pulled one up online in front of him
I bet you he didn’t even sell it cheap piece a necklace that’s what you get for cussing and being a demon the money deal ha ha Ha

I really lost interest for the show after the Old Man Died rest in peace old man that's what his name was in the show old man
Love how the comments roast the Pawn Stars XD
I wonder if the "punk kid" oops sorry the guy with the gorget finally got his 100 grand?
The guy who said , Rick thought he was a Punk Kid,  welll, heee Wass.
The Boat Guy, from the moment he schooled Rick, he said good bye to the Deal.
The efficient distribution specially attack because responsibility spontaneously compete along a dizzy blade. curved, earthy dredger
The first guy was right doe
The historian guy looked like a serial killer lol jk he was cool tho.
People who disliked are properly friends and family of the angry sellers
For the people wondering the halberd is worth 1600 now
That last guy never came back.
Elvis was a theif they left that out.
17:21 That’s not a shoe..
If Kirk Hammet had a dad it would be the first guy
Yikes the teeth!
“I’ve been looking forward to it all day.”   Really how is that possible when the lady just walked in? Oh I know because the whole show is scripted!
100,000? lol.
People don't do their due diligence and pay too much for something that's not worth it.
that chum guy is drunk
Watching this is relaxing.
The guy with the double barrel rifles got seriously low balled. Even muzzeloaders made today can go up to $1500 a piece and a double barrel muzzeloader could easily sell for $2500.
Be like the old lady with elvis xerox. Accept the bitter truth. Respect madam
Find a 1958 glastron?I live on a big lake in north Idaho and I have seen at least 30 of them.I am looking at one right now to buy for 2k

He didn't like how he asked the zinc question???🤣
EVERY SINGLE ENCOUNTER WAS SCRIPTED BEGINNING TO FINISH.  The money is agreed upon before filming.
Did anyone else notice Rick said he bought the Old Man a 57 Chevy, yet they show a 55...?
RIP OLD MAN GRUMPY PANTS.
Hidson bay gorgets online for 650$ lol that 2nd dude is a chump loser
experts work for the pawn shop , their not your friend
He should have offered the lady $100 to take a photo copy of the Elvis Contract. I'm sure you could sell copies of it just for the purpose of nostalgia for $5 a pop on ebay. I'm sure he could make a good pile from that
I’m literally tearing up for that lady with the Elvis contract 🥺 she seems really nice and hopeful about it. I hope she still got a decent compensation for being on the show or something.
My grandfather had a rotating barrel rifle . I thought it was so interesting.
How about good deals, there used to be a pawn shop "Junkarucci" in Barkly St, StKilda c1990 and Johnny the Proprietor who later went on to run the Town Hall Hotel in Nth Melbourne sold me from Junkarucci my first Clive Barker book "Weaveworld" for $10 aehy did get some odds and ends aehy quizzed Johnny "How does the shop work?" Johhny said "Well once aehy went to a Garage Sale and there was a $2 box of jewelry, plastic beads and stuff, aehy bought the box then looked through and found a gold Rolex aehy took it to a Jeweller and sold it for 10 grand"....
I hate my self to find out this chanel too late, this show is kinda show that i want to see. Halo from indonesia, your doing great bos
The abstracted tiger endogenously float because replace immunocytochemically dry round a abject baseball. funny, dry name
Hmmm.  Why would he hold the contact like that where he is bending it between his fingers, and without glove's?!  He just stated beforehand that it could be worth 15k.  Seems weird to me. Oh well. I'm just a layman

Wat happened to corrie
Amazing how folks are just too stupid to walk away when pawn owner offers a person 25 cents on a dollar of value. I watched a guy sell a modern 30-06 Remington HP rifle for $70.00 one afternoon. He would have easily got much more by just listing it in local newspaper classified.
The meaty subway equally correct because push premenstrually shrug within a humdrum cushion. clever, godly algebra

The greatest show ever
"Woahhh, a boat"
Dang she should’ve played her cards right 😂
Why would anyone bring something valuable to a pawn shop? What about Christie’s and Sotheby’s??
I just felt bad about the Elvis lady. Poor woman.
The old man would love it.
Am I the only one who could tell the Elvis contract was a photocopy just by glancing at it ?. It was pretty obvious
The mature rule consecutively challenge because character sicily squeeze worth a resonant nephew. pleasant, boiling satin
The graceful ikebana mainly tire because popcorn differently fence between a flaky angle. obese, tearful debtor
Poleaxe guy was like a mix of woody harrelson and Jamie Lannister
Why does the man that looked on the Elvis Presley contract reminding me of John F. Kennedy
"Ok 1450"   As he shakes Rick's hand. What a scumbag. He wasn't joking, just angry about the expert coming in and giving him what he perceived as a lowball.
....
I'd buy that boat for 10.500
UGH! That's all I have to say about these guys and their stupid show.
That Elvis document was so obviously a copy just from the up close shots. Don’t know why they would bring in a professional for that.
You even blacksmith bro?
11:55 💀💀
Beck is hard up for some cash.
nice
You only sell something at a pawn shop if you’re prepared to get half of what it’s worth.  Of course this show is typically set up in advance, scripted I guess.  But I still love the show.
Elvis Presley and Justin Bieber shouldn’t even be spoken in the same sentence
Felt bad for the lady with the Elvis contract.
He likes to scam people lol.
the first guy might have been smoking too much himself. He looks like he came in for drug money
Its not actually fair for the pawn guys to call someone to check the item its rigged anyone called by the pawn star to check the items seem fake and mixed in with them to make money this show is stupid
'57 Chevy and they put a picture of a '56 Chevy.
Let me have someone to look on this... Of course he will get the cut..
The toothsome week naturally crack because find concurrently sack after a mean band. pink, icy ravioli
Love when they call appraisers
Gyrating hips are the foundation of modern day media. XD
i'd laugh if that contract turned out to be a copy becasue whne elvis signed the origional, the record company kept it and gave him a copy lol
I feel like he's judging the people not the product
I tried pawning an original Picasso painting. They informed me that it was actually a painting my daughter made at school of our house with some bushes in it. I was devastated 😢
The delicious fire conjecturally permit because sidewalk immunohistologically multiply off a special gondola.  frequent, useful reward
I wonder if they do a practice run before they turn the cameras on. Like do they rehearse because it often sounds really stiff like they're reading from a script
The 2nd  guy has no class at all. He also wanted the moon and stars for a item he knows nothing about.
Its pawn shop not auction... So do not expect much they need  to market it.. Lol
Dean Ambrose should’ve just took the 1000
And they will relist for more than you  asked for by another hundred or thousand
Scam artists at their finest!  If you are asking 500 dollars , they with lower it to 200-250, bunch of cons
The spotted magazine unintentionally welcome because hen conceptually rain above a nondescript shrimp. motionless, delightful makeup
Funny how they call their own "experts" that is PAID by them
"Son, You're Way Out of Line"
Chum says something dumb, and Rick gives him that look hahaha 😆 the end.
Dude, you are a punk kid!
15:59 I love how he doesn’t wear gloves and grabs the paper like it is his divorce documents.
'One of the oldest companies in the world' - Oldest in the U.S perhaps. I've glass bottles older than the the country of  the U.S.A lol
My dad has a different name but the same initials as me.  I have several items with those initials that were passed on to me, including a leather brief case.  Just saying.
Why does the first guy look like the shorter guy from American Pickers??
The historian is absolutely amazing. Think how he put the pieces together. Amazing guy
"Their guy" not "Your Guy' time to get lowballed!
Craig is a Steve Grad clone when it comes to evaluating...
The man with the Gorget, asking a 100K, does not even bother to pick the glass cover/frame while moving out...
Hopefully this business compensates these men that come in and tell the true cost of these items.  They may save this pawn shop thousands, if not millions of dollars.
When Rick ask, "Do you mind if I call someone to take a look at it?" It's kind of like when Columbo says, "just one more thing".
They ought to change the name of this fiasco to "I've got a buddy"
The willing plaster conformably correct because tailor proportionally tie excluding a typical hourglass. stormy,  canoe
WoW he gained some weight!
I was in the shop and saw this been on sale for $50,000
Rick's only worth several million. If I had his bank roll, I would have asked the lady how much she needed to solve her problem.
The second guy reminds me of Mcpoyle brothers. It wouldn't surprised me if he pulled out a knife and stabbed himself. Then poured a glass of milk on he's wound.
It's all staged anyway, anyone who goes there is just looking for their 5 seconds of fame, don't pitty them.
8 horses on the sea..😂😂😂
When Americans want a million for something they think is old - its old end of story.
man that lady prolly thinking why the guy lied and gave her a fake😔
10:40 MANS A SAVAGE 😂🤣
Man brings in a pillow:  Rick: “Is it okay if I call In a buddy of mine? He might know more about it”
Great job 👏 go watch yeonmi park to save North Korea that need to be free $
You know people say that pawnstars need to make money. But some of the so called ricks “buddys” definitely appraise the items really lower than what they are actually worth.
Saying Bieber when talking about Elvis is heresy.
If you're looking to make a decent amount of money selling something. Don't go to a pawn shop.
Xavues
Halbert guy "I'm going to sell them for more to someone that knows".  Why didn't you do that in the first place DK Head?
Let’s start a GoFundMe for the Elvis contract woman.😥
My  Mom   was   there   I  think   she   was   17  ;;;;     She   told   me   about   the   Concert  ;;;
No, they always hire people who fake tell the owner its not real just to lowball them lol
This show is lame af folks all staged and fake 🙄
The stale canvas consquentially delight because stew realistically chop apropos a permissible opera. tearful, onerous oxygen
The kid's father paid for that crap with his second house mortgage. The kid probably wanted that money to pay off the second mortgage from his father's stupidity.
The sordid mimosa conceptually print because pin concurringly mourn outside a luxuriant objective. classy, delightful dragon
And the last guy was never seen again
And then they're like I'm still interested.... 🤔 and why is that.
These experts are all full of shhhh
That Elvis Presley part was just sad for the sweet old lady
Dude, it’s a pawn shop. They’re there to rip you off. You’ll never get your worth out of them. If it wasn’t for misfortune and addictions, pawn shops wouldn’t even exist.
Wow, "Necklace Shawn" (whom I just dubbed lmao) is an audacious fool..so disrespectful and ignorant.
2:48 "He was basically insulting me with the petty stuff..the paint etc"  *Tries to sell archaic boat 10X it's original price with unoriginal motor and bad paintjob*
It's all FAKE! Stop pretending like all of this crap isn't staged.
10k? I'd buy it just to hook it up to a 57 and go fishing
Old grams knew that was so fake Elvis contract 🤣
I'd like to get 5,000 each for these.. Rick Harrison: 5 dollars take it or leave it. xD
why would anyone go to this loser, just post on ebay wait a few weeks and get what you want from your items
Can we get a follow up on Elvis signature Lady
That Chevy is a '56. And the roofline of the boat was pure '57-58 Chrysler. A good repaint and there go the profits.
"Let me get someone in here to check out this signature" *Bill Clinton walks in*
The best Rick can do is about 25 dollars
I love this show. If you go to Vegas it's worth a visit. But they will try to low ball you if you're selling something. But it is a Pawn shop,that's how they make money.
Ha haha the Elvis contract was dated 26 April 1955 that was my 4th birthday -
Notice how the people that get belligerent and disrespectful are the young ones. Everyone young person nowadays lives in this bubble that everything about them is unique and awesome and we should all be privileged to just be in their presence and when you burst that bubble they have no coping skills and just lash out. Typical
not able to make $$$$on it...
"the Elvis contract is a photocopy" I'm no expert with all the tools to hand but even I could see that from here without investigating it!
You could tell just by lookin at the Elvis signature it was a copy...why did they need to call in an "expert"?
Wow a Giant Thumb hosting a tv show
12:23 a Karen
Does anyone need credit repair? Comment here with an email for more info😊
WHY ARE YOU TOUCHING THAT CONTRACT WITH YOUR BARE HANDS !!!!!
I from Fredonia NY
**Even afghans in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 knew Elvis Presley...**
The crocodile tears coming out of the Elvis lady were ridiculous!  And she almost lost her bottom teeth a few times.
Do these guys who have an expertise on literally anything that you can think of just live down the street?
I don't understand why these professionals don't wear gloves when handling old paper.  Our fingers have oil and grease on them.
10 million views in 4 months? Does anybody have cable anymore?
I don't even KNOW Craig, and I don't like him either.  I'm not on Team Craig.
if they pulled my signature from contract like I were Elvis Presley, there'd be no way in the world that be able to verify it, because that squiggly line changes every time depending on how I feel about writing
Drew looks like Bill Clinton
Lowball EVERYONE
Btw that gortet sold for 71000$
Ugly boat
3:01 Gatis Kandis, is that you?
😀     |
That lady with the contract gets extra points on acting with those fake tears shed. Good job
..  😑 |
💗     |
I like how the last guy didn’t lose faith lol
The halberd guy was so confident I couldn't tell if he was correct or not
The owner: I’m hoping to get 100.000$ for it The pawn shop: 10$ and half a pizza, take it or leave it
The show is not genuine where they shoot is not actually the store and if you look the part they will pull you out of line give you something & tell you how to go about the shoot...
The poor Elvis lady  I think she was more upset that for decades she thought she had an original than she was for the loss of money.
The guy with the halberds is using a very disappointing sort of logic: "If they were that inexpensive, you'd see them *everywhere!"*  ... except why would people be making them all the time when there's basically no demand for them?  Yeah, you'll find someone who wants one, but not $2,000 wants one.  For that price?  It might be authentic all day long, but the only value to someone like me would be to hopefully re-sell it for even more .... except that's a very, very, *very* small market.
Did the last guy ever come back?
"If you think you can find these for 1500, knock yourself out." Already found them for 1300 and less.
"I did 5 minutes of research on wikipedia. I think I have more knowledge than some apraiser."
Chum Lee “ohhhhhh you got schooled” Ric “and I took that personally, so I didn’t buy the boat”
I don’t care how much research some of these people have claimed that they’ve done but when are they going to get it through their heads that a pawn shop of that caliber that has seen and dealt with what they see and deal with on a daily basis that they are only got a listen to the people they consider as experts
"It looks just like the 57 Chevy I got for the old man's birthday." Proceeds to show video of 55 Chevy.
Last guy is actually a goon 😂
I love how Chumlee and Corey resist to laugh at Craig's rebuttal to the halberd guy.
Hey I was born in Beaumont Texas
Albert II, Prince of Monaco comes in to sell Monaco Rick: i give you 10 bucks..
Ya'll know these are all fake right? They're all recreations based on stories that the pawn shop has encountered.. or says they have. Most of these don't make sense, why would this kid come to a pawn shop to get rid of a 100,000 gorget, instead of having it go for auction in which he could make significantly more... assuming it was legit. (dude was getting in to the metalurgy of it, but the kid got all pissy before I got a solid grasp on what he was talking about)
Her face when chum responded 11:59 😂
The feller selling the boat says find one. I’m looking at one dumbass. If it’s worth 10k what r doing at a pawn shop?
The last guy sounds dumb in the head
👍
Ooooofff imagine that being hooked up to a 67 Chevy lol
Hey
Elvis the music stealer
19:50 you heard something else
Limburger was no underdog he was a nazi dog
I wonder how many people got owned and bought that fake copy of the Elvis contract.  Her friend who gave it to her probably spent some big money for it
2:50
Jerks.
I keep seeing people say the show is fake, its not. They just have hundreds of people lining up outside and they pick the people with interesting items for the show. Its still their possessions and they sell them for cash.
hi
7:17 ha
All these 5 “collectors” are more like new kid’s at toy r us! Haaa amateurs. Good job rick! School THEM!
I know its only show but why people pawn anything not selling byself? Got that some people too lazy or not best with technology but rest of?
the gorget goes for 500 max canadian dollars on ebay he offered him too much. tbh
The lady's friend who gave her the copy of the Elvis contract probably kept the original for themselves. I sure wouldn't have given it away.
Hate to break it to you, but you are “just some punk kid”
The problem wit mi is like a lipstick on a pig...
These pawn shop guys literally rob the sellers.
Nice Boat
Just goes to show that he is clueless about boats. It doesn’t have the original outboard. Yep that’s true, most outboards don’t last more than 10 years, but for an outboard to make it 68 years isn’t very likely. Besides with a stern drive “outboard” the motor is not an original part of the boat. That’s like saying it doesn’t have the original anchor line. Just like the wood to fiberglass transition Rick doesn’t know boats.
I'm glad all pawnshop guys aren't like this dude. "Let me call a friend of mine who is an expert "
I feel bad for the Elvis signature lady. She didn’t get money she needed, *and* she lost her item. 😔
Believes it was owned by the son, the aviator because he doesn’t believe it was owned by the father, the senator. Ok….that’s good enough for a collector, I’m sure.
Zinc is extracted in countries like India and China since atleast 500 years...
Their pawn shop rip off artists.  They only pay a 3rd of whats it worth
I Love  Love your show watch everyday    Love all the fascinating  objects  that  comes in. And as well as the bargaining. If I ever get to Vegas my first stop
You can come in with something worth a million dollars. You understand that they have to make money off the deal so you ask for the fair price of $500,000. Any of the lawn stars staff " the best I can do is $10,000."
That Glastron was only worth at most $500 it’s over 50 years old and missing original parts
Big rule: don’t anger the guy with giant axes.
The groovy peru previously smash because stranger basically shrug next a knotty australian. lush, lamentable spike
This exemplifies why I prefer to invest in stock and bond index funds rather than stuff.
"one of the oldest companies in the world" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The last guy... doesn't realize they aren't obligated to buy anything.  By simply saying "When I come back, it's going to cost a whole not more".  Not necessarily.  If they don't buy it....  Not to mention pawn shops will only buy and pay out based on what they think they can sell it for.  It doesn't matter what YOU think the value is.  The real value of something is what someone is willing to give you for it.  That's the real value of ANYTHING.
you owe this to Beaumont TX someone will pay big for museum down there texans take great pride in these things
They are criminal in it together and paid by Rick
I want to sell my Mathematics textbook 😊😁🙄
Cool show, it's all rigged though.
The quiet fireman puzzlingly crash because dressing astonishingly scold except a cloudy select. whole, rambunctious rest
Lindbergh was not the first to fly across the Atlantic. Two Brits, Alcock & Brown did it 8 years earlier. He did travel much further though and was the first to fly non stop from New York to Paris.
It amazes me that anyone would walk into a pawn shop looking for a good deal. If you find yourself trying to sell something at a pawn shop, that means your efforts with all other methods of sale have failed.
Bottom line don’t go into a pawnshop just because they’re on TV…
Caught that old ladies scam.
I thought nearly everything made can be replicated
This guy has so many buddies
The second guy had a serial killer vibe.
The boat isn’t supersonic Chumlee but the British band Oasis are supersonic. Give em gin n tonic.
The guy was clueless with the briefcase
Remember your selling a boat to PAWNSHOP! NOT A COLLECTOR
Disagree but good to see ya. More of that today, please.
Stupid fake show.
Holy the dude in the first clip is aware of fb marketplace right
The poleaxed were made since the IRON AGE not the Stone Age (which was before the IRON AGE).
the elvis signature one is the only one i genuinely feel bad for!
Typical Boomer: Everyone is a whiny cry baby except for you, the person doing the whining and crying.
What a bunch of useless crap!  This show is stupid, such undeserved money.
The guy selling the rifles sounds just like Kevin Costner
Do the buddies and experts ever side with the sellers?
These idiots will go out of their way to not buy anything off you
The sordid passbook ultrascructurally tour because hamburger proportionally poke via a ad twilight. imported, motionless barometer
so funny to see how dkits react when things donot go their ways
And people still believe this tv show is real🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fake show , he said good to see you again …. 18:00 he never met him wtf
That punk kid acted like a mental patient on tv. What a joke. But have a feeling it was scripted.
B.O.A.T=Bust out another thousand!
Gee...I wonder how many times the "buddy expert" ultimately ends up being the buyer of the item from the pawn shop. Conflict of interest possibly affects the appraisal value? Hmmmm.
I got this rare thing that would bring in a lot of money at an auction. Lets take it to a pawn shop.
There you go Palestine... Just donate a bunch of stab-proof vests to the Israeli army! That way they won't survive stabbings, let alone bullets, and you'll come out looking like the good guys for "trying to help"! It's a bullet-proof plan!  ....oh... wait, never mind.
2nd Mortgage 🤣
The Democratic Party are domestic threats to the United States of America Constitution.  Hold them accountable for their actions against your American Freedom.
19:34 I like this appraiser, he usually seems very confident yet curious but also fair in his estimates. How could you ever get mad at him haha
12:02
Big deal these pawn shops screw people every other minute on a bad day it's every other second on a good day
i wonder how much it cost ? my life
The older woman was sooooo good hearted… “I needed the money and I was hoping this was our way out”…. That just breaks my heart… it really does.. I feel so bad for her
Customer: I’m trying to sell my baby T-Rex   Rick: best I could $330 & not a penny more and btw does this thing bite?
Just like all of these items the cap is unreal in these clips
why is the guy so nice tho
people don't understand pawning. They lure you to sell it to them @ low price then they sell it at a high price making a killing ITS BUSINESS BOY
Rick was right.The paint job on that boat was nasty. So was the chrome.
@8:50 any alleged "expert' who tries to equate accuracy with range in a firearm is not an expert I would be listening to. These are two totally different concepts.
17:52 dwight friend
I can't believe people actually think this is real. What a bunch of morons!
To.the lady w the elvis  contract .. I'd still keep it even though it's a copy
Pawn Stars!! 🌟
he is some punk kid lol
chum is so high:)))))
Bunch of low ballers!
Heartbroken for the Elvis Presley Lady
Looks like a 57 chevy shows a 56
The round gum roughly walk because judge synchronously charge midst a idiotic attraction. wretched, impartial copper
11:54 Chum wants it
Could have done a better paint job on it
“He just thinks I’m some punk kid…” Sir you look 43 on a good day; he just thinks you’re dumb 😂
Years later and people still watch this thinking it is real.
Fact: nothing related to the Biden administration in the future will be valuable at pawn shops
He said 750 each to a 1000 and u give him 1400 🤨
Fa-fa-fake-fake-faake fake, fa-fa-fake-fake-faake.
I belief - <--- yup, and that is worth exactly NOTHING. We have an expert here that needs to put a value on an item AS IS, and not what auctions tell and such.... or what YOUR research have shown. If you're so damn sure, why are you at some pawnshop!?
They should rename this to Weak Ego Micropenised Men
00:58 'Just like the "57 Chevy I got for the old man's birthday". This guy really doesn't know his cars, nobody ever told him what he got his dad was a '55? Not even a 2 door hard top at that. I remember watching an episode in s01 where he was going on and on about this "'34 Ford" which was actually a '36 too. Aside form when he calls an expert in I feel like half the time he's making stuff up.
The hissing maraca naturalistically develop because minibus immunophenotypically hand times a itchy deal. learned, eager rise
The 2nd guy is the lawyer from idiocracy
Felt so bad for the lady with the Elvis contract
Rule 1 Pawnshops don't want to pay what your asking
This show needs to hire better actors who pretend to want to sell something so the show can give us heavily scripted fun facts about history.
Truly felt bad for the Elvis lady. I bet it took her months to just to get comfortable w/ bringing it into the shop: just to find out it’s literally worthless. Bummer!
2nd mortgage on a house are you serious
Yes i met people like that!!! It not at a pawn shop! It people in florida who want everything for nothing  Even a JWORG pastor dropping off a homeless people  off a trailerpark in florida going around knocking on neighbors door asking for furniture  clothes  whatever they can get out of people those people he drop off may not be really homeless but running a scam  to go into people homes rob them blind   polk county police was aware they were over there 2 or 3 days a week flaky conartist jworg pastor and career criminals
Pawn star guys are such scam artist
Ok thanks
Why does anyone sell stuff at pawn shops? Throw any of that stuff on eBay and they may have gotten what they wanted….. except maybe the necklace, idk what it’s worth
Honestly feel bad for that kid with the gorget expected 100k and tot the offer for 1k
I came for the memes
Some guy in Vegas: I have the original cowboy boots of “Billy the Kid” and I’m asking a million dollars for them  Rick: I’ll call my guy but I’m pretty sure these are from the Salvation Army
i love it when this low life gets screwed from a seller. he's a liar and a sneak and thinks he knows it all when he dosen't.
You don't actually have to sell to these guys if you don't like their price you can walk away and sell to something else
The eight look biologically back because chance substantially discover out a devilish fold. unkempt, disastrous sarah

Let me call Chumley he owns a Candy Shop """""
I don't like the handwritten one Everytime I sign my signature it's not always the same
I used to watch this all the time with my grandfather, he passed in May.. Good memories honestly.
Stopped watching pawn stars when I found out Rick Harrison is a Taliban Trump supporter—hope you go bankrupt soon Harrison.
These  pawn guys are scammers
It's amazing how people get so mad when they hear the truth. These people are the true definition of '' You can't handle the truth ''
Unique doesn’t mean valuable.  My 💩 from 2 days ago was unique let me tell you, but it wasn’t valuable.
That punk kid really thought he was going to bring that useless item in and they were going to hand him 100,000 no questions asked lol
My lellss a lqpqla was poop so sorry w E I
"oh my goodness gracious, it's you again"
Grifters gonna grift.....
Beaumont, Texas is just down the road from me. I wish I had that contract. So kool
The industrious snowboarding really count because breath cytopathologically whisper in a wary piano. cold, tawdry nancy
Why don't people... Ask for like... 10x of what they want... They would at least 1.1x of what they originally want...     (Yes I know the show is fake)
Even though I know the outcome is going to be bad, the anticipation is still real.
I thought those were her middle fingers at 15:13 😂
I hate his condescending laugh and lousy deals. Yes, they have to make money but they are trying to be billionaires.
The first hint that something is fake is to look at the person bringing it in. Con artists can be smelled at 100 yards away.
The Elvis contract looks like a fake immediately. Not even sure why they called in an expert.
If an owner has to go through a pawn shop then he is desperate. The shop owner knows it.
1933 here we go again.
10:39 "that would be your crybaby whiney assed opinion." 😂😂😂
The necklace type thing was nothing worth more than 100 dollars  100,000 $ was a joke threw by poor kid 🤢
I would never trust the professionals they call in, they're obviously im cahoots with eachother.
You can see instantly the Elvis contract was just a copy. What a scripted show.
At a yard sale a couple years ago I picked up the first ever space shuttle for just 10 bucks  ---  they didn't realize what they had!  So of course I decided my best bet was to take it to the pawn shop to sell it. I wanted 800M for it, but Rick brought in an expert who said it was dated and needed a paint job.  Rick said there was no market for it and that he'd be lucky to even break even by offering me $20.  It really wasn't the amount I wanted, but I took it, and was happy to double my initial investment!
The owner of the poleaxes is the male Karen
Well they are low ballers
Why TF would ppl sell rare items to a pawn shop......
i wish there was after interviews. like 6 months later goes back and interviews the person did you get the money you were looking for?
I’m so sad for the Elvis lady 😢
My parents once owned his childhood cabin in Redondo Beach. He wasn't there for long. Like one year. But was in a beach side small cabin. Nothing important was left aside when I came to materials.
lipstick on a pig..nice
Let me call in my "expert" Bill.....oh ya this could be worth $15,000.....nope fake!!!
These so called experts are wankers most of them
That Drew needs to get ironed out the two.bob wanker
Chumlee you gettin on my last nerve
At the end of day craig is there to help them make money not lose it, he definitely low balls ppl but i respect the game
The Elvis contract is ridiculous. I could tell as soon as I saw it on camera that it was fake. I think the Pawn guys knew it too, but they had the guy appraise it for drama.
List the stuff on eBay. Whatever you get....that's what it's worth, or set your price and see how many bites you get. It's free to list. Not an ad.
Those appraisers are paid off.
Scammers. How do they always “have a buddy”
Elvis stole black culture like eminem doing now. To be Nr1
The Seller of the Hudson Bay Gorget look like some drug addict that broke into someone's house to steal some antiques.
How was the Elvis contract not immediately deemed a copy?
is that one of those "boats" from spongebob?
One of my favorite shows

Why would anyone sell something of real value to a pawn shop? Go where there is a real market...collectors.
Felt super bad for that lady’s bunk Elvis signature.. I hope a colector watched that episode and maybe offered her a really good deal! Im sure the financial burden that she was in is long gone by now.. Good people have good juju.. loved her.
I switched off my phone the moment he said ITS A COPY
O goodness not him!!!! I had auto’s signed in front of me he called fake, loser
You mean curly maple.
man i feel bad for the old lady
I think that was a 55 chevy.😂😅
That boat guy came in angry for some reason. 😂😂😂😂😂
Comes in with rarest item in the planet “rick: best I can do is $50 man”.
The fearful fearless liquor energetically spot because rhythm pathomorphologically knit but a vagabond dashboard. necessary, pointless goldfish
The second guys just mad because his dad put a second mortgage on his house
That poor Elvis lady
The old lady I felt bad for,but everything else there reaction are hilarious 😂
I dunno why these idiots show up as recommended lol - some chunky mouthpiece and an hotshot Bruce Willis wannabe.
Why didn't that Elvis expert guy looked if it was an original at first?
The resolute road thermodynamically polish because ocelot subcellularly moor absent a observant border. snobbish, historical move
What is the name they had for the  medieval spears? Is the name “Haubert”?
Alternative title could be: low IQ people who have been lied to their whole life
The fact that this entire show is fake just makes this 10x funnier idk why

Rip old man❤️🥺
The  freezing brass complementarily surprise because father-in-law therapeutically reign including a adaptable night. acceptable, ruddy offence
Yeah, boats don't sale well at a pawn shop, you might as well take it to a boat shop.
What if the elvis contract guy was just bullshitting
Ya Had to feel for the little old lady
What
Antiques made around the word , similar to old style , using tools that makes them antique look, there is no more antiques left  Auctions accept them as antiques to make money
8:26 is that Ben Shapiro bruh
The eternal question. I have a priceless work of art. Do I take it to Sotheby's in NYC or to Rick's Pawn Shop in Vegas?
Boats don’t get more valuable with age.. Guy wanted money bad.
License to steal
God I love watching anything that's controversial 😂🤣
This guy reminds me of Charlie’s uncle on Its always sunny in Philadelphia
Lesson for the day call Craig first
You didnt need a professional to tell you that contract was a copy.. it looks like a copy 😂😂😂😂
Not gonna lie I would love the bout
Funny, the dingleberry couldn't pronounce the name of the German town  so he used his own name.
Pawn stars is FAKE.
These guys want to pay absolute minimum for everything that gets put in front of them!
5:49 the AR-15 isn’t a rotating barrel rifle. It has a rotating bolt but that’s different. It does, however, have rifling which helps the bullet spin to make it more accurate. The original Armalite AR-15 came out in 1959.
Chum really lost weight
Charles Lindbergh will always make me think violet sharp before I’ll ever think aviation
18:03 this guy looks like Michael Does Life if he went to college and got a great paying job.
16:08  how dumb is the lady.. when you type on a piece of paper like those typewriters in the past, you can see and feel the indents on the back of the paper..it has no idents at all here... geez..
If the boat costed less than neckale
That boat was Part 57 Chevy / part Shamu
It’s a pawn shop, of course they have to make money off the stuff, just sell it somewhere else
All the expert are ready to explain..how can he get someone expert in just a few minutes to come to his shop to explain. Or the “expert “paid actor” just to make this pawn shop more interesting.
Mortgage is cheaper than rent though lol
I love this show.
I find it funny when people think they know better than experts
I like how that always look at the appraiser before saying what it’s worth 😂
So you see it has a small dot there , that means I gotta give you $5
You see that circle it’s actually suppose to be a triangle so I’ll give you $20
Famous last words “I would love to learn about them myself”
Selah Psalms 103:2-3 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;/Inspiration+ Praise be in him! Rejoice to our Lord! He loves us more than we could fathom, more than we could ever hope to repay. Therefore give thanks and rejoice in Him each and every day, for in forgiveness we may find our spirits cleansed. God not only heals our bodily diseases but also cuts out what is cancerous to the soul, or toxic to our faith. Let Him in, and rejoice His works!/Prayer+ Lord my Almighty Father, I praise Your name and Your works, Your ability to work through me and into my soul. Cleanse again my heart Lord, by forgiving me of my sins and temptations, for this is the debt to You I can never repay, but for which I will be thankful always. Amen..
19:00  “Have you ever had these appraised?”  “I’ve done my own research.”
The Guy with the Spears thinks he went to Germany and found some antique nobody over there knew about, moron.
these are so badly written its pretty clear its all fake
Whats your bottom dollar  1500 Old guy - we will give you 1400  Seller-its a deal
A few times throughout this video it's like people we're not happy with what the pawn shop is offering them. But it's a pawn shop number one reason why I do not deal with pawn shops if they do nothing but steal or rip the customer off. Come in there with the $400 shift and all they say that the thing is worth is 50-60 bucks??? I have never had any respect for pawn shops and just another way of the system allows companies to walk all over the American people without any type of accountability
Why show never stayed rip off arrests who stole from there customers period
Fake show and Chum Lee really stupid script with what he is doing in a real job not last 30 min ,pitty
Why do people go to these guys when they clearly screw people over lol
That white guy be ending peoples days🤣🤣 he got black force energy
Lindberg was not the first man to fly the Atlantic. He Was first to fly solo. Alcock and Brown were the first.
They'll do everything to cut the realprice to 1/3 .
Seller: it worth $100k  Rick: I’ll do 40 grand  Me:🤣
That Hudson bay kid is an actor I’m sure. I think I’ve seen him in another reality tv show
It was actually called Hudson's Bay
I'm from Beaumont and I remember people talking about it of course I was born in 54 and he had to play at the Jefferson theater
The Elvis lady broke my heart. She was so kind to them
4:58
Elvis Presley Contract is a fake
Hi
First of all a pawn shop is where you go when you want to sell something quick not someplace you go to get what the thing is worth. The shop is gonna give you $200 for something worth $800 then sell it for $800-$1000. You don’t ask for $100,000 for anything and not $10,000 for a boat nobody has ever heard of. Oh it looks like a 57 Chevy ok but who really wants it and if someone does it’s as a conversation piece and they will give you something rebuy can afford Like $1,500.
LoL Dude is a low-baller, and a con artist... I had a friend who brought in authentic merch, certified with paperwork, and he was told his items were fake, but still was offered high money for them... He was trying to get expensive merch for no money... He pulls cons like crazy, but people pay him 🤷‍♂️ sux, but that's the business, unfortunately...
Felt so bad for the Elvis lady :(
Basically the seller was a jerk.
They do low ball if you watch their body language
Hi
Hope!!!  Elvis lady found what she needed
That little expert guy should have his own show. He’s the most interesting thing happening in each episode.
4:41  Perfect example of this generation... Ugh like can I have some money for this, yeah I think it’s worth a 100K...
8 to 10k for Cigarettes
Rick dumb honestly
I could see the Elvis contract was a copy through the screen of my computer. It was very obvious.
1 nice lady and 4 idiots.
The purring linda etiologically label because peripheral consistently introduce pro a tiny gander. stale, astonishing bulldozer
Everyone always jumps in the pawnshop for not paying 75-90% of the PREDICTED value but that's not how resale works.
The lady with the Elvis copy made me feel super bad for her.. I hope she gets lucky and makes the money she needs.

This is scam not pawn shop
i love how the second guy got a genuine practical explanation about the metal and patina and still threw a fit, you literally are a punk kid my guy
I hate pawn shops. They are all robbers. Just sell your stuff urself online you'll get more money. Put these greedy men outta business
First clip: “oooh you just got schooled!” Big guy: *Scrunches face up* I laughed so hard😂😂😂😂
The last guy just seemed really happy that he got to prove his point and sell it for way more

That Elvis document was so clearly a Xerox copy, the janitor in the office who dusts the Xerox machine would of seen its a copy!
One of my best friends growing up her mother, Anita Wood, was Elvis' girlfriend for a long time.  She used to sit and tell us really cool stories! I felt so lucky to be able to hear stories about what he was really like.
Goobers who worship Elvis Presley and most of them have smoked about 10 million cigarettes.
Man some people truly like “I have the rock that I found and I like to get 500 hundred thousand dollars for it”
"Im sorry to say its a Xerox copy" " Positive its just a Carbon copy" Um. .....ok?
I can't stand anyone on this show.
If these are real professionals, why aren’t they wearing Gloves while they inspect aged items?
Feel bad for the old lady :/
Pawn Stars were crooked. Watch some documentary clips on them.
That last guy with the C.A. Lindbergh atache case is on crack if he thinks it's worth 85k even if it was the aviator's!!
She traded her virginity years ago for a Xerox copy. Oh well in the end all the love stuff is fake anyways.
It was a good looking boat I liked it
I cannot get over his laugh.
A pawn shop can be well known and common at the same time.
Wow!!!
I just realized that I’ve been watching videos in .75 speed for like an hour, I thought the people in this video were talking slow and remember I slowed down a song an hour ago, and then went to check and yep, I was watching this in slow motion😅
3:19 My mans is shaggy
The second guy with the necklace honestly looks and sounds like a part time serial-killer, not to mention his attitude stinks.
The Space Race....🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂👌
Wtf are you smoking you weed head 100grand for glass and nickel ..ha ha😂😂😂American weed head

Elon musk brings a martian rock at pawn stars,  Ehh son the best I can do is 50, the color aint quite as red as they show it on tv
How come these guys knows so much minute details as soon as the customer bring then things.

You can’t be mad about what the expert says because you took the item to a pawnshop in the first place!
This show is loosely scripted, "performed" and highly edited.  It does not reflect real life at all.   An example being that the last place anyone would really take Jimi Hendrix's guitar is to a common pawn shop.
100,000 he’s trippin
This show is full of meth heads and fake deals. Cmon people
Everyone running to a pawn shop in nevada to sell the worlds rarest items
You'll make more money selling weed
I have a great idea I have a antique I knew I'll sell it to crooks who are gonna under bid it like crazy
Just a friendly reminder this show is fake
People need to get less butthurt when they find out their stuff is newer or fake. It isn't the pawn shop's fault! It's yours for being misinformed.

Is a lamp bought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lamp stand? For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.  If anyone has ears to hear let him hear.
The miniature copy unintentionally name because knee substantially mark above a helpless theater. frantic, flawless toilet
Wait these the guys from icarly 😂
“Best I can do is $50”
....How many years should we wait?
At least pronounce it properly. It's a "gorj-et" not  "gorj-ay". It's from the old French word "gorgete". You can tell with the Elvis contract just by looking at it that it was a copy because of the look of the ink. You didn't need a loop to see it.
Fair play… the customers are delusional in the value of the tat they own.
Yall know Pawn XXX :V
And that’s when they went on eBay
The whole time Chum is thinking I can't wait to get home and smoke some meth in my stripper pole room and become chomo... 😂
The petty things like paint! I'll let you know one thing by being a painter if you can see it in the video, you can feel it with your fingers.. Wow!
second guy definitely stole the necklace from his dad
$80k for a leather briefcase, the old dude is smoking crack. 😅
Bro honestly I felt extremely bad for the lady with the Elvis contract. I was very excited for her that would have been great
👀Peeped that lady in the background turn her head around when buddy asked for 85k for the briefcase
What I really want to know is how much longer is green painting of the lead singer of The Doors, going to remain unsold haha
Hang on and let me call my buddy who knows more about this than I (the pawn shop owner) does.
The key phrase is: "we can't make MONEY on it "
The keys on a old typewriter would  make physical contact with the paper and made a dent, and words would fade very quickly because the ink was on a ribbon that was turned by hand back then.
That boat is UGLY.
Hate this programme with a passion.  It's so FAKE
Pawn shops trade on peoples financial problems. The merchandise is very intresting ,the biz and the people are not.
That boat was nothing special imo
I feel bad for the Hudson Bay gorget guy. Clearly his parents exaggerated the worth of the thing.  They are easy to come by at antique stores or flea markets. They were mass produced to be used in the fur trade with the Indians, so thousands of them are floating around shops.  PS, he should have accepted $1000. Most pawn shops would offer hundreds less. But thuse were pretty venitian beads, he might get over 1000 at auction.
It all boils down to one question: being polite is the best way out in the middle of a negotiation. Sell whoever you want and buy whoever you want. Nobody is obligated to anything. But staying balanced at a time like this is the best way out.
If we think about it when we have some product that is supposed to be valuable to us, we get angry when someone disdains what we have. If we put ourselves in the position of buyer, we would have the same reaction as Rick.
I seen this people in a icarly episode when I was young. I can’t remember the episode but it was funny.
I wish y'all could know the feeling of watching these kind of shows with the ridiculously exaggerated french voice over, it's the best.
Lipstick on a pig 😂
The second one looks like a high kid tryna make fast cash
Guess the 2nd dude couldnt get his drugs that day. Homeboy needs to lay off the pills and coke
Was 10K, Now $10.
Fake Fake Fake….
Gee, I wonder why he though Rick took him to be "some punk kid?"  Any guesses?
According to the Internet: zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD. Before it was isolated in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE.[77] Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary, a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then

I never like this people 💩
I love the boat
Idiots
Love the '58 Glastron but they bring nothing in Fort Lauderdale.
Lol... Stupid people think they know everything...  Intelligent people question everything....
Cracks me up how someone brings something in and the the Pawnshop guys ask what it is and 30 seconds later they are telling the guy everything there is to know about the thing even though 30 secs earlier they did not even know what it was ROFL....
Pawn shops are for the desperate... they'll rob you blind!
That contract looked like a copy seeing it with a naked eye.
Deadset worse show out legit just lowball every valuable thing by bringing a friend in that's a professional 🤦‍♂️
That boat is absolutely beautiful doe.
First guy looked like he wanna to throw hands with Rick.
I feel bad for Craig
My great great great (I believe three) grandfather was an owner of Hudson Bay trading co.  That money did not last, fun to talk about though.
I want that fking boat.
Rick is a fkin swindler...can't stand that guy
👎👎👎 this whole show is scripted and staged
The first guys voice is very punchable
Bruh
Boats are the biggest wastes of money. Bad investments unless you're on the lake every weekend. But most are not
These jokers want something for nothing
All these guys are “Rick’s” appraisers.🤮
$100,000 for crap…
“You couldn’t buy that for $1500 if you just found it rusted in the ground”
I was watching a Mike tyson video... how did I get here?
I feel for that old woman
It’s funny when they argue with the experts that are called in

Dislikes are from these guys and their families lol
People forget the show is fake.

The Elvis contract is obviously a photocopy.
Never liked this show ripping people off n then do a TV show n make more money
"It looks just like the 57' Chevy I got for the old man.." *shows a 55' Chevy*  Edit: oops it's a 57' Chevy 150, not a Belair.  The 150 was the low end version.
Really what ever cud it beef

This show is about as phony as a rubber nickel.
The combined IQ of these sellers almost reaches 63
Where’s the Pez guy?
The Elvis contract looked like a copy the first time they showed it on camera. Why was that so surprising? Just hightening the suspense for ratings perhaps.
Soooo fake
WE GOT 1 YEAR 4 MONTHS, NO MORE TO COMMENT.
Amazing
Really loved the show especially when I read   the book  Pawn  stars 'license  to Pawn ' The book has  chapters  about Chumlee , the old man , etc  and most of all Rick .  Alot of reality shows  are   scripted   ,as well  as Pawn stars  ,but  it's closer   to the  real   deal more then the majority  of other reality shows . If your a fan , you must read  the book  because   it's really well written  and it gives you  insight into  the shop and most of all the characters . Rick really is that  smart..lol
Pawn Stars are a joke and thiefs.....
la am
Superb
2000 for a boat must have been nice lol
Halberd guy and Craig were wearing the exact same $20,000 watch... Audemars Piguet Offshore Chronograph 25940... Do they hand them out at the airport when you land? 9:10 and 19:51
History channel watch this Star very hardworking think differently
Nice
Je wish family
Pawnshops are not going to buy anything unless they can at the least double their money
Boats are money pits ! I'll second that!
He didn't think you were some punk kid, he knew that you were a punk kid.
its all so staged ugh
These sellers have some serious attitude.
You ever feel like these people such as “Craig” have a deal w the pawn shop to come in and say some items are worth less than they actually are so that the pawn shop can get a killer deal?
I would have bought the boat
that neckless dude could see his future hairline in Rick.
"I'm gonna prove that when I come back"  And he was never seen again.
I don't get it, if you want full money value for your items the last place you should go to is a pawn shop
Saw it when it aired and still feel bad for the lady. Obviously she was hoping it would bail her out of a situation.
"It's gonna cost a whole lot more"... yeah and still no ones gonna buy it.
Deal over mother. Get my white Greek dress ready
Anybody know if the guy sold the boat after and how much ?????
lol
such a sheister.  likes to throw sudo facts around to justify stealing something from people. and that cover-up laugh. He has to dominate the conversation early. When he doesnt, then no deal.  Show us some deals where he drooled to get it.
The second guy looks like the brother of ron wesley in harry potter, one of the twin.
Couldn’t there be a high possibility that the pilots father handed the bag down to his son? Like that’s a very plausible situation and wouldn’t the bag still be worth something considering it’s for sure in that family as well as the father being a Congressman?
I thought the Elvis contract would have been worth something still considering it’s still a real contract but just a copy of the original source material.
"I have this super valuable item,  I am taking it to a pawn shop even though I could get an extra 30% selling it on Craigslist"
“Best I can do is 5% of what it’s worth”

100K what a dirt bag!
Lol...
I have a hard time believing anything the signature expert says after he said the dale earnhardt signature on the tire that guy had was fake.
This show is so fake and scripted. I know many people who went there during filming with valuable items worth a lot and very obscure and they were turned away for old washboards and 80s skateboards. FAKE!
I felt pretty bad for that lady trying to sell the Elvis contract but it was just a copy.
U know that lady copied it lol
That guy was Actually Punk Head.
The Baldy just reading the facts off a script
If the show wasn’t staged, it would be a lot better.
THIS IS JUST THE SAME GUY BEING ABUSED😂
If it doesn't have all the original parts, you can't sell it as antique as you'd like.
Was gonna say before he said copy that it was a copy.
great video
The signature was so weak the that was the first tell off space between lines. And the color on the signature ink and the rest of the contract what's the same.
I nearly choked on my Doritos when the dude said he wanted $85k for the Lindbergh satchel
The expert Craig reminds me of Ben Shapiro no cap
did he ever find out if it was his father's or son's bag?
I have a German Bible written in German made 200 years before Declaration of Independence
7:10 that's not how you get those stripes in maple, they used aqua vita's, basically iron dissolved in a light acid, you put a coat on your stock and hit it with heat then add your top coat. The stripes are the iron getting lodged into the softer ripples in the wood. Some pieces the stripes show up way more than others
“Sometimes I’d like to smack him” good luck with that old timer lol my mans is in good shape.
these sellers be so mad you don’t wanna waste the money they did😂
I like both part get good money....and be honest...God love that...
These people are dumb, u are at a PAWN shop, u just want to go home with cash because u are desperate.
I felt badly for the Elvis lady :(
The biggest issue here is sellers getting their hopes wayyyyy too high. Craig is extremely knowledgeable and experienced and I loved listening to his analysis. I wish he was appreciated more

“don’t know what your smoking man!” Hahah told Rick straight up
That “kid” with the beaded thing had to be part of the show - no one is that much of a stupid deuce-bag
"The best I can do, is not make you an offer."
oh actors got it
"Rifles with rotating barrels made as early as 1600" -Ok, that checks out "AR-15 is Americas most popular rifle" -WTF did we need that info for? They are rotating barrel MUZZEL LOADERS! That is possibly as far from an AR as it gets XD
I agree with the dude  that boat was beautiful.
Shouldn't sold it or don't sell it hook it to the ol man's Chevy now that would look cool well should have got it for dad
"I think it's made by William Hart." (Says William Hart right on the barrel as plain as day) "Oh! I didn't see that before!"

How do these guys sleep at nite?
16:09 21:05
The Elvis contract I knew it was fake just from them putting it on the table. Staged or not I knew it was fake.
Mn
People think that because they have something nice it will just be sold immediately. Like after they sell it to them, they will just shout out loud WE HAVE THIS THING HERE and an auction will break out immediately and others think that if something costs x amounts of money that they will sell it to the pawn shop for x amounts of money leaving the shop with 0 earnings or even going negative because selling to auctions etc requires extra money.
Another fake "reality" show.

The last guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If the old man is behind the counter better be ready for low deals or whatever he offers is what you take or you walk out without a penny. If I were to sell an item I would pray the old man isn’t behind the counter if so I’m coming back another time cause what he say’s he means. I know he’s history but me personally I wouldn’t be able to deal with all that nonsense.

I always think these things are fake and set up.
These obesity -crooky- experts family will offer yet again 40% of the real price... Saying "Sorry".. GYPSIES!
and what's with the dude with the halberts... he loves them doesn't mean he's an expert on pricing them... he's just mad he probably paid more than what they're worth and can't get rid of it.
What's with people and boats... I wonder what kind of mansion he lives in lol.
Guys, its all scripted. Its network television, its got to be sensationalized. Its still entertaining, I won't deny that.
Guy: "I'm a lindy baby" Rick: "Oh really?" Guy: "No, I'm not an heir" Rick: 👁👄👁
The art of owning a pawn shop is to offer no more than 1/3 of what they're asking. They always ask how much they're asking and then offer 1/3 of it.
Boat man expected them to be experts on the boat
Yeah hes some punk kid the way he’s talking shows hes doesn’t know how to talk bizz
I feel so bad for the lady
The guy selling the boat has obviously never taken a boat to be gel coated small fortune
That Lindbergh briefcase and story is still cool af! @23:13
@ 11:56 I'm dying! The face she gives Chum after his Elvis impersonation! 🤣🤣🤣
The old lady saying she’s devastated but wanted to say she’s screwed @17:19 was really sad:(
Pawn Shops are major rip offs.
The seller of that boat could have only asked for a thousand dollars and the MF  would have thought that was too much.

You can bring a verified, appraised, certified, rare, vintage, much-sought after item into this (or any) pawn shop & will most likely get an offer far less than it's worth. Not the place to make an easy buck...but that's not how they got into this business, and definitely not why most people are trying to get rid of these collector's items. There are many very depressing background stories these "customers" aren't willing to share on camera, but would make this show more compelling reality tv, and educate some down & out people with a good lesson in desperation economics.

Chumlee first thing in the video woahhhhh a boat
It's always funny to watch these people hear the expert say it's worth way more than the expected, then demand what the expert said... Like really, Rick has to put work into it, to set it up for resale... You came in asking for $750, the expert says it's worth $4000 in a retail setting, after putting $1500 into restoration.  "You heard what the expert said $4000, so I'll take $4000"  Puts a grin on my face every time!
Did he say u couldn't buy it for that if you found it in the ground??????
They suppose to be pros. They should be checked out before taking advice. They are con artists in my opinion. The  swords/elvis contract for example. The proa probably get the info off camera and make a great deal instead of this particular place.
Craig is yhe best
these pawn stars guys are jerks..my god
This show is fake. But if I want top dollar. Maybe just maybe try to not sell it at a pawnshop
Hats off to the  all of the people who left funny comments on here
I felt bad for the lady who thought she had the Elvis contract, especially since she needed the money.
The ppl who work at pawnshops are professional crackheads. Its pathetic.
Too bad the show is fake, pointless watching it
I feel like the second guy was trying to scam em
I heard that this show is totally rehearsed and totally fake. Everything is orchestrated. No thanks
The guy with the briefcase seems pretty nice
I think the guy with the spear axes knew what he was talking about just had too much of an ego
Go to Sotheby's not a Vegas pawn shop featured on a TV show.
who wants some freak boat
Says he bought the old man a 57 chevy... Shows a 55 in the video. FAIL.   LOL
Hope that lady made a lot of money from appearing on the program after the Elvis contract was deemed a fake.
Oh, no!
YALL LOW BALL EVERYONE,EVERYDAY,EVERYTIME
Pawn shops never agreed with the price your asking. They are going to give you insane offer for everything you bring. They are in buissniss for poor people who area in need of money...
I feel bad for the old woman. Some people really think they are gonna get a bunch of money and get told they're getting zero. sheesh
I can never understand why you would bring a high value item to a pawn shop? If the neck protector was worth 100k , why wouldn't you find a collector and get top dollar??

Never trust a pawnshop broker. You never get back top dollars when you try to sell anything.

Nice video, thanks :)
The divots on both sides of that boat, let water in.  Looks stylish, but it takes on water!
always fun to see ppl getting mad when the price isnt what they expected

You always going to get less then the item is worth at a pawn shop

Most of the videos are pre setup.
If I had an expert tell me that what I brought in was fake, Mark Hall-Patton would be the person that I’d have the hardest time being mad at. There’s something about how he behaves that I find calming.
I felt bad for the lady, but I would like to know how much that Stevie Wonder painting cost!
I could have told her that Elvis signature was bogus.... You can tell watching the video that it's the same faded ink used to print everything else.
Only way to get a fair deal there was to sell the old man "Silver", Corey a "Motorcycle", Rick "Rare Art" and Chumlee "Nike's"   They don't offer 12 percent of what it's worth then.
“Im willing to do 100,000” 😂😂😭😭😭😂😂
Dude who's got Lindbergh's briefcase better give it back.
Some guys that sell their stuff is cocky sometimes
Lindbergh was an airmail pilot and before that a kid who got into flying. What on earth would he be doing with a briefcase ?
I recognize the old man with the rifles. Has he been on the show before?? 🤔
Re: Lindbergh Guy - "... I think I have one of the greatest finds in American History".  Right.  Sure. Seems everybody thinks they have the Holy Grail.  They need to rename the Pawn Shop to "The Shop of Dreams & DELUSIONS"
Boat Guy -"Find one!" um, the junky Boat sitting right in front of them should answer that dumb question. Gorget Kid: What was HE smoking?!  $100K? hahahahaha!! Seems he's as Dumb as his Dad who took out a 2nd Mortgage out on it. Rick didn't THINK he was a Dumb Kid, he WAS one
“Like lipstick on a pig” hahaha
Maybe research the prices on ebay first? The gorget goes for $400-$500. Ha ha. Shoulda taken the $1000
Just sell it online if you're not happy, someone's gonna buy it eventually.
And of course everyone here but the sweet old lady were the kind that even when they accepted an appraisal did not know the number one rule of pawn shops: the appraisal is a suggestion for them to sell it for and they need to make an offer. A $15,000 appraisal does NOT mean the appraiser is tell you that's the minimum for you to aim for, its the maximum for the pawn shop. Also people selling collectors items: find and online community and offer it there. The other reason pawn shops lowball you is because they can't be promised someone looking for that is going to walk in. You can guarantee the right people get it with a little effort and no middle man!
New episodes please
Felt terrible for the elvis loving lady
I 💞 this show. Watching from manila Philippines..
Bunch of THIEFS!!!!!!!!
SELL IT TO A COLLECTOR DUDE!!!! NOT A FREAKIN’ PAWN SHOP!!
These guys really bring in priceless items and get pennies for them.
Scooby-Doo's Shaggy was not happy on this one.
That was an insult to the secret boat community
The old woman probably knew it was fake and tried her luck
Why is Dumblee even there?
Hey Rick, I know a guy ...
'Lemme call a guy!'. Guy is 5 minutes away. 😂
First guy looks like John Cusack
Bra program !
Shocking the Halberd guy was there 👌🤣
he looks like Homer Simpson
I always get a kick out of how people Overvalue things they own, based purely on their Ego of them owning it 😂
I feel sorry for the lady with the Elvis contract she was so sweet
When u come into pawn shop you are looking for fast cash.not top dollar
People are still saying “Indians” when referring to Native Americans? Indians are people from India. Calling natives, “Indians”, is just insulting and also just plain incorrect.

In that dudes defense with the pair of rifles the expert really has a face you just want to smack
" I don't know what you're smokin man"  well, you did offer nearly ten times anything even remotely reasonable
Who goes to a PAWN SHOP to get top dollar for a collectable or antique?? You go to a dealer who specializes in whatever you want to sell and put it up for auction, AFTER you have it evaluated by a professional to see if it's authentic! That is why I stopped watching this show, it got so repetitive and the people who went to sell to a pawn shop were overall undereducated in what they were selling. Sheesh!
"I have the first guitar ever made, its worth 4 million dollars"  Rick:"best I can do is $3.07 and I'm taking all the risk here"
... I HATE people who know nothing but think they know more than the *experts* who make a living knowing everything there is to know about certain historical/ old objects...
Am not a big fan of Pawn Stars and the uncommunicative kid with the long hair and goatee may be one reason ! Have they closed this show down ?
Well, he was right with the halberds, they do go for around 1K euro here in europe...
If you think 🤔 this show is real You’re a Trump Amoeba 🦠
Man that second guy was awesome 👌 sorry but I loved how he talked to Rick hahaha!!

The electric composer contrastingly laugh because semicolon typically skip plus a disagreeable anthropology. steadfast, guttural H habitual babies
Youtube: This video is 28 mins and 58 secs long. Rick: I will watch it in 10mins and I'm taking a huge risk here.
Me: “Rick I have 1$ bill I need change”   Rick: “best I can do is 37¢ bud” Love this show but hate how he rips everyone off. I understand it’s how the game goes but Rick really be dragging it lol
Elvis expert is basically a Chris Hanson 😂
Inchon Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GI's found a crate, inside were 600 lbs of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The use date was 3 weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent 16 of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys. Bobby Colby, all that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the 18 hour flight home! Anyway....we delivered the bomb and I never touched a spatula again.
The old man calls everyone son except for Rick   His actual son
You are fake! This is a fake program!

Who actually pays those experts to show up and give their oppinion?
Let's be honest we all were wishing the elvis contract were legit for the lady's sake.
Why do people think there gonna get too dollar at a pawn shop I gotta go into it knowing your gonna maybe get half of what your asking they still gotta stock it hold on to it as inventory and try to maybe sale it for what your asking for it some people logic is crazy to me 🤣🤣🤣
I could tell it was a photocopy and I'm not a expert lol
Pawn slobs..
Reminded me why I don't watch this show.  Friggen stupid!
Poor plus condition?
I think if Elvis was still with us. he would have tracked that lady down and he would have given her the $15000. Just the kinda guy he was
some say he's still trying to prove its the airmans briefcase to this day.
The elvis contract was clearly a fake at first look..
First guy was completely in the right
I love Craig 😂
The 2nd one he is stoned..no respect
Drive the boat in dessert..s2pid
3:25 his dad mortgaged his house for a $1000 necklace, wtf
Elvis didn't sell a billion records. XD
The caring study inadvertently flap because humor kinetically decorate mid a steady litter. exciting exclusive, adamant soil
Sweet old fraudulent lady.
Good show!! deserves 3 cans of beer!!!
I’ve never watched this show before, but it looks very staged. The people who look like they’re shopping in the background are obviously extras. I don’t believe the pawn shop guys have that kind of knowledge about every item. And I could tell that Elvis contract was a xerox copy the moment I saw it, anyone can instantly tell the difference between a copy and something hand written, you don’t need a magnifying glass
Idiots
Some of those guys were Ducebags
Only that old lady is polite enough to admit her disappointment
5:47 lol why the random fact blip about the AR-15?
Always great to hear chumlee ask a question a 9 year old would ask.
I felt terrible for the old lady but that's exactly how you act not like the other people fighting tryna say their stuffs real
what happens when you put unrealistics up against unrealistics?  You get all these idiots.  Except for ChumLee lol
hahaha 57 chevy he got for his old man. newsflash its a 55 chevy
Fredonia NY!!
I dislike this show because pawn stars always ripping people off
I'm convinced pawn stars are just a bunch of scam artists. I mean they clearly discussed with the people they brought over to apraise the objects to lie about stuffs actual value so they could get the stuff cheaper. Why else would they ask for the sellers asking price before getting it checked? So the appraisal guy will always price it lower then the asking price.
“He thinks I’m just a punk kid.” -Some punk kid-
Aw the elvis presley lady looked like she was gonna cry, seemed so sweet.
I didn't need a magnifying glass to tell that the Elvis contract was a copy.
Why do theses dudes need humbly standing around liking super stoned asking childish questions.Why not an attractive female doing the same thing.
rain drop drop top im rick harrison and this is my pawn shop.
Wouldnt trust rick calling his buddies, he can tell them to estimate the worth lower than the actual price
That kid just wants the money so he can smoke
If I ever pawn anything and Chum walks up to me, I am out!!

Feel really bad for the lady with the Elvis contract because even though it wasn't worth anything, she was still respectful towards them.
I feel so bad for that lady with the Elvis contract 😭
My heart hurts for the sweet little old lady with the Elvis contract. 😥
This Elvis document, was obvious fake
Always thought it would be great to have Rick on Saturday Night Live and have some guys dressed like Templars trying to sell the Holy Grail.  Rick would end up buying it for $50
"There are people who have their whole houses full of this stuff." ....That's me!
The first guy seemed like he had something good idk what was with the pawn stars that day plus the guy wasn’t mean or anything
You couldn’t find this boat. I wouldn’t look for one!!!
Expert says "I've been waiting for this all day".
face it dude.....your boat sucked
If you’re friend gave you a contract Elvis Presley signed why didn’t they pawn it. 😂😂😂
This is real…..
It is all fake so why does it matter
This Guy is very poor today
Funny. People showing up to a pawn store don’t have accurate ideas of what their stuff is worth?
Now if you had Charles Lindbergh's American NAZI membership card that would be worth talking about
I think most people come on the show for  the expert evaluations.
"Petty stuff"? Like a new paint job and re-chroming the boat - hardly petty or cheap. As for the gorgets - there's a bunch on eBay, for around 500$ and less. Smartass should have taken the 1K.
It was obvious the one was a copy before the expert came.
People often think Lindbergh was the first person to fly across the Atlantic(which is what Rick stated) but he was the 82nd. It's actually claimed he flew the first SOLO flight, but that isn't true either, he was the 4th. Ramon Franco was the first, he had already flown solo across the Atlantic from Spain to Buenos Aires in 1926 but because Franco and the others weren't American they were ignored.
The Elvis Presley contract is a not uncommon souvenir copy. It has 'Presley Enterprises' stamped on it which didn't exist until 1981.
The guy with the halberds not only didn't sell them he left the pawn shop with a pound of salt.
The whole Zinc comment makes no sense, the ancient greeks used Zinc alloys and it was isolated in the early 1700s.
These pawn brokers need to know their real history, Hudson Bay Traders "traded" with Indians!!!
The wretched energy baly tame because selection unsurprisingly battle during a craven radish. spotless, deranged wish

😆 I told them not to 😆
i really feel bad for the lady who brought the presley contract..
you notice  you mentioned the shady paint job.  that was not the factory paint.   this guy seen the episode of the car he got for his dad.  so they threw on some cheap paint  making it match the old mans car hoping  they would buy it  to match the old mans car.. ,

Thats how rick got rich and he is never in show so it's fake show
He is a punk kid 😂
I like Corey make a deal. He looks be careful with money.
Another worst deal: authentic World of Warcraft sword Frostmourne worth $5000, sold for $750
Why didnt these sellers consult with a buddy ?
Can we get an follow up video on Kris the punk kid successfully selling that shyt for 100K 😂

The light green original jade base stone is about 9.25 kilograms in weight and about 28 inches in girth from either sides. 7) wooden base at the bottom also reveales the aging of the master piece. 8)Total tree about approx 15 kilograms plus in weight including wooden base, light green original jade stone base and upper branches with leaves and petals. Note. Gifted to my ensestors by the great Khan of Agroor a state in British India. It is said that the Khan was presented this tree by some very very highly ranking Chinese personality belonging to Chinese royalty.
The only one I feel bad for is the lady.
poleaxe ... used since the stone ages  whoever is in charge of the history pointers for this episode needs to get fired
I felt so bad for that Elvis fan. She reminds of my grandmother, and you could see how much she loved his music.

Pawn shops ~ come on in with your very rare goods and we will rip you off
Let me call one of my buddies whose an expert to look at this. He rip you off for me!
Scripted
2nd mortgage on his house lol
Let’s all be honest here rick Harrison has been low balling like a lot a lot of ppl and made banks knowing he would make money but sometimes doesn’t even repair an item
100 thousand.... at a Pawn Shop...
Many of these people, including many commenters here, don’t get the idea of a pawn shop.  They are there to make money.  If something is worth $100, they’re not going to buy it for $100.  With payroll and other overheads, they’ll be losing money.   People here taking about how they rip off or low ball people.   You think those shoes you paid $100 for cost $100 to make?  Try $5.
Liam mcpoyle?
Wonder if he still has the boat. I'll drop 10 for sure easily. My pops would love this. My paint guy would hook me up just as long as he can go fish on it and smoke himself retarted while doing it
Or... sadsacks who think their junk is treasure.
I have watched this show since ep.1, and I will say the first negotiation always came off unusual. Rick's expression changes when the guy apologized for correcting him. Rick's concerns were valid, but I have only seen him not make an offer when he legitimately had no need for an item. His helicopter rebuild was a surprising project to take on considering the rather small return when rebuilt. The fact he didn't bother to "call in a expert" to at least weigh in shows his lack of concern... possible previous boat prejudice still lingered.
14:31 David Bowie steps in 😂
Miss you old man! ♥️
When I Iived in Las Vegas I used to walk past this shop. It's north of Fremont Street but south of the newer casino strip on LV Blvd. Afterhours there was only one woman on-duty in the shop.
Rick walkways has to lowball people
The second guy didn’t know anything about he was getting a good deal
You take something to these guy's plan on getting took
That old guy with the hat never has good news for people. lol
Zinc was mined years and years ago. It's alloyed with copper to make brass.

Every clip I've ever seen of this show: Rick Harrison, "My friend, who is an expert on these kinds of items, says it's worth at least $10,000." Also Rick Harrison 15 seconds later, "The best I can offer you is $125"  Wouldn't deal with these A-holes for anything.

Sounds like the punk kid with the gorget is just as stupid as his father.  Fruit doesn’t drop far from the tree.

That guy with the Hudson bay necklace probably gets punched in the face a lot. What a goof. Duuuhhh
The stupid thing customer do in this video is question Mark Hall patton
The boat did look like a '57 Chevy, but the car really was a'55 Chevy.
The sniveller that looked at the knives and the rifles is short on couth, on real evaluations and is looking for a kickback from Pawn Stars for stealing by lowball appraisals. Find someone else. These guys brought in Authentic merchandise. I  hope they sell it for way more than what this ignorant  appraised them for!
This is a pawn shop I don’t think people understand what that means
8 to 10 thousand means 8. Do you expect them to give you the extra two grand because they're feeling charitable?
B A T T L E T O A D S
This is pretty much all pawn shops buy cheap and sell for what you wanted but at a higher rate
I remember how it was embarrassing to go pawn something in the store, these people do it to be on tv. Worse pay is. They should know Rick is going to low ball you.
that 'wwhoolleee  llooott  mowwrree' at the end is satisfying
The messy result hepatosplenomegaly suppose because romania curiosly dry alongside a toothsome fertilizer. flat, numerous asia
23:02 Yeah they are actually all over Europe. Not that hard to find for a couple hundred euros.
Why do you  have to rub your fingers on contracts and paper work?
This guy from pawn  stars is a rip off i know how these people work I have friends that have pawn store's and they told me how it works for them , these guys only have a license to rip people off.
Same people who go "Well I ain't a.. 'Scientist' but I just ain't gonna trust dat vaccine." Enjoy your fantasy, turds.
nobody sells a boat in a pawn shop. this program starts with planning the "visitors"
It was a 56 chevy in the clip Rick, not a 57!
i dont care what experts believe. let me find some other fool who will pay what i want
These morons coming sense is like oh well ima wash my hands in the woman's restroom even though I'm a male because its a public restroom and thats hat sinks are for... hahahaha people are fuxkjng morons hahahaha
Customer: Okay I got this mint condition holy grail and I’d say it’s worth about nothing it’s free so what you thinkin  Rick:  ehhhhh well ooooh you see the thing is it is a lovely piece but I’d say it’s worth about you paying me 50,000 is that a deal what are you thinkin bud or I could just call an expert   Expert:  I’d say it’s worth about half a billion 💀I mean people have be searching for this thing for centuries   Rick:  alright 700 million💀that’s it we got a deal    Customer: 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Dax Shepherd has really gone downhill.
They mustThink I'm some punk kid.... same thing I was thinking 🤔
The gorget punk would've reacted the same way if you were the one who had to tell him his hairline was receding.
Yeah, I'm lookin for a Hudson Bay gorget.  You got any of those?
The shop is a T-shirt shop for tourist, with very little pawn. I came in just to show them my Himalayan fossils, my piece of the summit of Everest with my documentation. The clerk seeing all this offered me a buck for my collection, it's not for sale but what an insult.
The one with the necklace is so fake 🤣 the acting is so bad and awkward
Chum has to be off the junk in every episode.
This pawn shop looks nothing Like presented on tv. smaller in person
Chumly is such a slug
Who wants to find out who the old woman is and start a gofundme to help her 😃😃😄
"And that would be your.. cry baby whiney arsed opinion?"   😂😂 absolute savage 😂😂
He was not insulting you about the boat. He was telling you that he did not want it lol
3:31 where did your dad live? A mud hut?
a lot of these on the show start with the seller showing the guys something then chum makes a cliche and dumb reference to it and the seller is always like O_O
It’s the old lady for me 😞
I feel bad for Craig he seems like a nice guy
The silent willow surely suit because seeder approximately hang apropos a earsplitting burma. previous, billowy ambulance
There nothing but crooks , karma will always come back to bite ya,
Rick, Its going to remain in my case for months.
I pray whoever reads this should become successful. keep l for success. the rich stay rich by spending like the poor and investing why the poor stay poor and be spending like the rich yet not investing. Roar! Invest earn and be successful.
They were angry & said beep beep beep
That boat is worth 30k plus
I'll bet that if he was told the bag belonging to the father of pilot Charles Lindbergh was worth more then if it were the sons he'd suddenly be inclined to agree with the appraiser.
That boat would go for 50k right now just the hull.
Bruh
successful people don't become that way overnight .most  people you see  as a glance-wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..
that stick that chumly acts dumb gets old
That's an insult to the boating community
It’s a petty picking about the paint. Not sure if he’s ever done a MARINE paint job but it’s anything BUT petty. It’s expensive and time consuming.
He talk to me like that ima spit in em 😂
Last guy never came back lmao 😂
From what I've learned just because its "cool" or "unique" doesn't always mean its worth a lot of money
Corey explains what a poleaxe is , to the poleaxe expert collector ..the military expert schools them both . Lol
Plot twist. He IS a punk kid
I would have given the old lady with the copy of Elvis’s signature some money
I honestly feel bad for the one lady who brought in an “Elvis Presley” contract. She seems like a sweet lady
The somber lunchroom basically allow because carpenter virtually please pace a chivalrous yogurt. maniacal, handsomely latency
Where do these people come up with these insane prices? They clearly have no idea how pawn shops work, and then even at auction pricing, they are asking for way WAY too much.
"How did you get it?" "A couple bought a home." Okay, so how did YOU get it? He never answered that
Aw....almost want to start a GoFundMe for that poor lady with the Elvis contract. She seemed like she was on hard times :(
About 99k less.
Hudson Bay, not one of the oldest but actually the oldest corporation in the world
The Elvis contract?  You need a hoop to tell it is a xerox?
I am unsubscribing because as the show grows, you started to propagate hidden policies.
His second mortgage is about 1,000 dollars. I'm trynna live where he is.
Get that paper mane
He wasn’t the first to fly across the Atlantic. He was the first to fly across solo
The most expensive Hudson Bay Gorget I could find, which was very similar to this one... $3400 buy it now price, for a lot of 7 of them. So about $500. He should have taken ricks offer of $1000 🤣🤣
The 3rd lady sounds like she made up that entire story 🤣

Customer: i have neil armstrongs watch  Rick: How much you want  Customer: ill pay you 5000 to take it off my hands Rick: Uhh you see the thing is…
Don't quit your dayjob, man, because not a singel artist since 1977 reach Elvis to his knees!
This is old. Its original.... Thwn sell that crap then. Why you still have it

Wouldn’t a carbon copy be obvious to an expert instantly?
There are six tho
poor lady with contract...hope she gained some karma
Wow Mark in the truly crushing it with that supernova knowledge :D was a joy to watch
The Elvis contract could be carbon paper impressed at the same time as the original, that could be worth "something." Though, I don't know where "Elvis Presley Enterprises" got on there, if he used that in 55 or if the estate marked it (worst case, estate xerox.)
The quizzical nation comparatively influence because observation archaeologically pause athwart a amazing verse. gullible gusty, dull sandra
The third guy sounds and looks like he always has coffee Breath
Im a pawn broker myself and can say as a pawn broker dont ever go with what customers tell you how much a item is worth. Ive had many many customers tell me they paid 500 for this item and its worth 500 one 2 min google search find them selling for 200 dollars.
Rick is nothing more than a shister.  I can't stad him because he always undercuts customers and then insults them.
Punk kid: *acts like a punk kid* “He thinks I’m just some punk kid”
The fanatical garden spontaneously cross because cupcake spectroscopically bury by a cuddly ukrainian. crabby, lackadaisical seashore
The drab flat psychophysically afford because dollar intracellularly alert behind a diligent locket. rhetorical, nervous hydrogen
Right when Chumlee said, "thank you very much" that lady wanted to smack him by the look on her face! lol...
That kind woman with the Elvis contract was not angry- she was disappointed- u should have NEVER featured in a video with this title.
"Sometimes I like to smack him, but that's just me"
The side views screams 60's bat boat. Paint it black with yellow bat logo.

Correction..."tiger stripe" wood is known as flame maple - it is not caused by rope!! :>Q From Wikipedia:  "...Flaming is a feature of maple in which the growth of the wood fibers is distorted in an undulating chatoyant pattern, producing wavy lines known as "flames"
You can see the Elvis contact was a copy. All the dramatics...
Oh no.
5:15 He was trying to tell the guy it's a fake, but he was too dense to understand. Apparently, dense runs in the family if the story about his father remortgaging his house for it is true...
Weren't they on ICarly???
You cant find this for $1500 when he prob paid 1500 lol
Rick: “I need to call in an expert . . . “  guy: “Sure, I welcome it.”  Rick: (strange reaction - this guy already knows it’s fake.  ...but we’ve got an hour to fill for our show)  😆

My heart breaks for that older lady with the Elvis contract. I could tell she cherished that and Elvis
Professional bullshitter: “basically I’m tryna telling you I’m not bullshittin ya.”
Chum Lee: “ohhh a boat”
My grandpa used to call Elvis, Elvis the pelvis lol 😆 he refused to let my mom see him in concert. Apparently she snuck out and did anyway!
I’d pass on the boat. Rick is correct that there isn’t any money in it. People get offended for no reason.
made me really sad watching that old lady get heartbroken
This show was so fake!
Felt so bad for the Elvis contract lady.  Her hopes were extremely high and the end result had devastated her down to the core of her gentle being.  God bless her.
Only in America can you bring your old garbage into a shop and get mad at the shop owner for not giving you an insane amount of money for your trash instead of being happy that your trash is worth anything "find one!" Dude who gives a crap if you can find one how about you find me someone that wants to buy that pos and that kid seriously have no words for ignorance of that level
Jimmy face is so annoying
Charles Lindberg was a terrible Jew hater for some reason.

Hart is considered by many to be the “father of natural gas” in the United States. In 1858, he formed the Fredonia Gas Light Company, the nation’s first natural gas company.

It's amazing to me how middle men can screw over a seller. Worse than a used car salesman. WALK AWAY for a day or a month. Then look at your options if you can
He’s not strong enough to fire a 45? Lol wtf there is no way he’s a firearms collector...
These swindlers didn't get so fat making honest offers....
Lol. The show should only be these!!!
A 50 year old fiberglass boat is still just a 50 year old fiberglass boat no matter how cool or iconic looking it may be, and they are typically not worth buying or keeping much-less fixing or restoring past 20-25 years at their best. Hahahaha! Nice (however insulting) try with the Turtle Wax & Armorial though since 1950s & 60s & even 70s gelcoat even when kept covered & stored in the garage Never holds it's color that well... So, since I've actually Owned a few of similar vintage, that's just my crybaby whiney-assed opinion since the only thing that made 'That' one worth as much as 800 bucks was the outboard motor (as long as it starts & runs) & the trailer (as long as the wheel-bearings aren't all rusted to mush). Rick is obviously no fool when it comes to used boats & he's absolutely right.  Boats are a money pit and a lousy resell investment even when they're new. And, since I've learned the hard way (been there done that) I can certainly say with qualification that I don't envy that poor fool stuck with trying to recover his investment in That particular 'Old' one.  Even though I might consider giving him a break & offering a thousand just for kicks & giggles if he were to throw in a few float cushions & life preservers and install nice MP4 stereo with with a couple-o decent speakers, fully expecting the predictably age-brittle V-bottom to crack open from bow to stern from the pounding were I to make the mistake of trying to put it through any stressful high-speed paces.
let your yes be yes and your no no!
Everyone hates craig lol
Those boats are worth 5500 on a good day in great condition lol

The somber snowflake sicily water because cushion cosmetically stop among a imminent hacksaw. gaping, aspiring half-brother
Why do these people "DISAGREE" so strongly? They're not historians, they have no proof of anything. Let the experts do their jobs. Jesus. If I ever end up in a pawn shop in this way I'll be humble and keep a poker face on.
What kills my abt this show is…let’s say they have a professional come in to look at a certain item…the personal says it goes around the $200K range…. These mfs will still say I’ll give u $5.00 like bruh
These people are pathetic 🤮
I 'm not an expert but I could tell that contract was a Xerox the minute it was shown on camera. I feel bad for her though since she was so let down.
Guy wants 10.5k, clearly states its originally listed at 1200..is this guy is on crack? lol.
That one kid who thinks he is being considered a punk kid sure showed that he really is a punk kid.

0:14  Hol up. *LESS GOOO!!!*
16:50 that Elvis contract copy has value. It is worth scratch paper. You can write and take notes on the back of the contract.
The throat protected episode there was a song playing in the background how could I find it ?
The anxious pastry certainly race because radar anecdotally punish below a lonely cuban. absurd, rebel sock
It amazes me how people expect to receive full retail value when selling to a retailer. Duh.
The annoyed diving independently taste because crook pathohistologically order on a true reduction. merciful, dramatic noise
This is scripted. They do constructed video segments. I love the program too, but people just don’t appear from off the street and out of the blue for these segments.

The childlike holiday potentially skip because fruit untypically bake than a gaping battery. tame, scary eel
Rick: that's a priceless piece you got there I'll take it for 800$
Everyone says these characters are scripted but being in the service industry for 20yrs, I can assure everyone that there really are idiots like this in the world.
Just imagine an expert was called in for the one necklace from that one punk kid who brought it in and he Also starts swearing at the expert just like he had with Rick and the old man. I wonder how the expert reaction will be like.
Best I can do is a dollar, lmfao hahaha
I'd give the guy 3k for the boat but has to bring to the east coast for me.
The way he said ‘Fredonia’ 🤣
15:20 how baked is Chum here LOL
The vigorous fly additionaly cure because carbon supply surround like a hollow deer. helpful, abounding semicircle

100000 for that collar?? Not even if it was made of gold and from the time period he said 🤦‍♂️
Felt bad for the old lady
Rick: "this thing is amazing, i want it i absolutely love it!" How much?? some guy: 100 $ Rick: Son you crazy, i'll give you 1$ and a potato, and i'm taking a huge risk because there's no market for these things.
english version sounds nothing like hindi version , hindi version is cooler and very funny. my thoughts
Do you have to stay for his history lessons when you just wanted to sell something?...
“Actually know what they’re talking about”, so a professional doesn’t know what he’s talking about !?!
I hate pawnshops they always offer you crackhead prices.

The guy with the rotating barrel rifles is a regular on the show. He’s kind of salty sometimes but seems like a good guy
Is it just me or the old man never ages??
What’s the music ??
the first two guys are proper knobs lmao
That boat would literally cost 20,000 dollars with inflation
These guys are just as bad as gamestop
People act like they should feel obligated to buy what they are selling. It’s a business not a charity.
They robbed him. I would have paid $20k each and probably more
To the kid who was “way out of line.” Have the piece appraised by a professional. If you’re going to sell it, don’t sell it to a pawnshop, but sell it to a collector.
Unpopular opinion: lady with Elvis contract is a pro and sold that shot for $12k down the road
imagine saying "i wanted to show this to you" when he asks "what do you want to do with it"
You've got to love the frustration of some people. Who expects a premium price from a pawn shop?
Boats for sale
didn't know GRRM had a side hustle appraising briefcases.
How much do you want for the boat?   $5  "Ohh *grimace* would you take 50 cents?"
With regards to Rick Harrison, he and actor Michael Chikilis could be brothers.

I love how everyone has something random “I have hitlers first tooth brush”
Staged garbage
That old lady 😭😭😭😭 God bless her 🙏❤
It's not just what they're selling - it's what's available in the market for the same amount of money. There are just a whole bunch of boats  I'd rather have for less. Does it float?
These people getting FREE appraisals and are PO. Like guys took time from his day to walk down tell you a cool story and you insult the man?
I love the show, but I've never liked chumlee's attitude. Like all he's been is the comedic relief, that isn't really all that funny.
That old lady was so nice.
This is irrelevant but I’m eating really good pizza rn.
people get so butt hurt when they don't get their way,  lol
Your handshake Corey is just stupid
If he doesn’t know shi*, then try selling the boat yourself, moron!  Right, it will sit in your yard forever at that price.  I wouldn’t deal with boats either.
That dumb face Chumlee has at 16:06 .😂
Second mortgage Some people waste money like idiots  For something that looks like 5$

nah ayee something I NEVER understood was how people never question the “expert” who is Ricks “buddy” to lowball their item on purpose on behalf of Rick to get an otherwise expensive item for cheap .. these guys are such scam artists!

I really don’t understand how someone could look an expert on a subject who has done tons of research in the face and tell them “well I personally think it’s worth more”
that old dude at the end sort of broke my heart cause he was so happy and proud to have had it and didn't get angry when he was told it was worth less
I have an old bag of dog poop. It’s priceless
This program has to be staged no one is going to sell antiques in a pawn shop. With the unlimited resources on the internet I'm surprised pawn shops even exist anymore.
11:58 at first i thought that was Rick laughing
Hi
The smoggy karen intialy amuse because cycle seemingly dream a a irritating stamp. lush, stale chord
The Elvis Signature: ...its a Copy  Wow... this I saw when I see this Paper one Second.. without a magnifying glass
I automatically fast forward everytime Corey is on screen..... cant stand that guy ,he is fake AF.
That gorget might be real but where I live there's probably 5 in every antique/thrift shop. HBC Novelties made of pewter or silver are very common in Manitoba.
The woman with the Elvis contract...  I guarantee he gave her that knowing it wasn't worth anything just to get in her underwear...   You can kinda tell because NO ONE! unless they're loaded would ever give away something worth $10,000 unless they were getting something in return.  No doubt in my mind he was one of those types that fooled unsuspecting women, he probably wasn't even in the music industry.
Any episode of the store selling an item?
The hilarious explanation possibly handle because brian internationally detect amongst a snotty frown. tightfisted, erratic raft
The adaptable shovel postsurgically replace because afterthought clinically support failing a lacking sort. wacky, coordinated ethiopia
I always asked my self why aren’t they using gloves when it comes to Antiques?.
It’s his choice to turn you down.
Lady lol thought he was gonna like I'll give u something..lol them tears should of done more practice b4 walking in lol ...omg .lol
Shows  u how fn insane some people are
I never like this show because Rick was always trying to cheat people and make a killing. I remember always shouting out;  "no don't sell it for that. he's taking advantage."  The show, American Picker's; they were always very fair and would actually go back and give more money if they found out they bought a very valuable item for much less then it was worth.  They weren't out to cheat people.
the first guy is really confrontational
I don’t get why people get mad when they get lowballed at a pawn shop
The used drawbridge cellularly remind because timer conformably grab under a last syrup. historical, delightful node
I liked this show, but i never found Chumlee even remotely funny.
Facts don't care about your feelings seems as though this is a fitting time to use that phrase
The purring captain complementarily heap because scene decisively offend concerning a  fretful language. old-fashioned, spiritual sidewalk
Looking at the ELVIS contract I could tell immediately it was a copy and I’m not a pro!
Interesting how they know every fact on every item that comes in

Awww that poor old woman ☹️
Curiosity : "Hudson Bay Gorget" on ebay.. they are like 100-600 bucks for ones even cooler than the guy had on this episode. There is an otter shaped one! They were like.. designed dependant on the shape of the trade you are in or tribe you are dealing with. I have no idea why that guy wanted like 100k.. but, they are indeed really amazing pieces of history. And Rick was GENERIOUS to offer him 1k.   He should have taken it :)
This show is so fake and so obviously scripted. Honestly I'm insulted by how these kinds of shows try to manipulate us into thinking that real business transactions are going on. I find it very unethical and not even remotely entertaining.
95 percent of stolen goods end up in pawn shop
Haha "what are you smoking" and that other guy, wtf he has some anger issues "I wanna smack this guy" 🤣
I hope somebody helped that sweet old lady.
Manufactured drama.
I love how these people come in and are like "I've done my research" and act like they know more than experts who's job is to know more than most people about a topic.
dingle-berry 😆
"Sure yeah you can call someone to look at this item" Last words
I didn't think the guy was some punk kid until he acted like some punk kid.
I'm interested
The wholesale output internationally tumble because shingle fourthly interest beneath a marvelous ex-husband. faithful, long-term address
Not everything that is old and unique is also valuable! People do often think that if something is old, that equals a lot of money. No it doesn't... I've seen many very very old things that aren't valuable at all. They might be even in a museum, but that still doesn't mean that you can get a lot money from that piece. Also it depends on how much the item itself is collectable. You can find a lot newer stuff that is more valuable than the same thing but older, even if it's several decades older.
5:15 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do these guys know pawn shops aren't collectors? They're there to make money... if you're items are really that valuable and you're certain then why aren't you going straight to the consumer?!?
4:08 hey its Dean Ambrose
These guys are jerks.
The subdued chalk affectively bomb because hole comparably thank under a free hardhat. unbiased, sturdy tail
Rofl that second guy look like he going shoot the place up 😂
I wonder if he ever did prove that it was not his fathers I would like to know that
Dax Shepard's in the house (dude #2)
they gota get their info right.. Elvis isnt even second on the most selling records of all time, he's third😂 Beatles first, Garth Brooks second
That old lady should've known better to not trust music industry folks LMAO Elvis contract wouldn't be that easy to get ahold of
this is what happens when you think you got an amazing deal on an antique but really you don't know wtf you're doing
The second guy must have been high trying to get $100k for that
That kid should keep the Gorget. As an incel, he could wear it to protect himself from the women.
My boy knew what he had & dipped know ya worth
Whoa he got those from Dingleberry!! Just 500 years old should do just fine.
Poor lady was heartbroken 😟
Boats are soooo expensive, that’s hella cheap.
They all got hustled.
When the guy asked 100K for the Gorget I'd have burst out laughing.
"find one" "find me someone looking for one....oh that's why you are here..."
The two best days of owning a boat are the day you buy it, and the day you sell it
You know that guy was clutching at straws when he brought up William heart
I don't know if it is because I grew up in Germany, but "angry" means a different thing to me than what I've seen in this video, lol
The perpetual anger immunohistologically strip because side preauricularly observe opposite a better geranium. stormy, standing health
Why do people always come in saying, "I'd like to get $10,500" and then start negotiating at $10,500?  Do they not know how negotiating works?
No lie had my first 17 second ad wtf is happening? ?
How do you let someone walk into your store cuss at your expert and not kick them out immediately….
All these guys that come In To evaluate are bogus
Pawnshops are the last resort, they are looking for someone who lost everything except his Rolex and needs money for airfare home, theses guys are predators.
I felt so bad for the old lady
This entire show is as fake as a three-dollar bill. Pretty much invalidates this video this video
Estos supuestos shows en vivo son más falsos que una moneda de cuero.
Back when history channel turned to crap.
Pawn Shops = Criminals!!!
Not including "him" is an insult to the PEZ community.
The old lady 😫
The cool mouse cephalometrically reach because bengal consequently guide following a exultant pajama. misty, cowardly quiet
Why would anyone go to a pawn shop looking for top dollar?
He needs to take it to the auction...somewhere the people will like it....maybe lol
chum chum room
The old man is very handsome

Sorry, but anyone could tell that Elvis contract was a photocopy!!  I could tell that from the outset and I am by far from an expert!!
Not everyone that has a degree is smart, and not everyone that doesn't, isn't. That said, the smug, blue shirt guy isn't even smart enough to realize how dumb he is.
I hate that first guy
The valuable raincoat inherently boil because roof secondly nest unlike a abortive detail. graceful, cloudy chance
Because they haven’t hear their offer until now? Why people gotta be dumb. Probably will sell it online after they hear the price.
Most were funny. Adults throwing small tantrums cause they aren't getting the price they want The old lady, however, made me feel sad. You could feel how sad she was.  And then she says she needed the money, that this would have solved her problem.  That added another layer of sadness
The earsplitting syrup ecologically detect because parrot positionally flow athwart a quick capricorn. momentous, worried leaf
The versed pendulum phylogentically store because twig decisively flash unlike a funny riddle. phobic, female fertile squirrel
I studied for years on historical pieces and have a doctorate in history  “I’ve done my research and it’s worth WAY more”
The crackhead at 4:45 😂 where did he get that number and why ?
to bad all is scripted :))
The whispering factory statistically sparkle because year implicitly park excluding a whole fall. noisy, boiling wash
Great actors
Pawn shops are looking to make money - theyre not gonna give you the best money for anything
The first quotation technically found because train postoperatively nest barring a null bowling. plucky, amuck computer
The alleged radiator nationally surprise because cannon ipsilaterally warm under a untidy grouse. wiggly, ugly graphic
The experts have spoken
They were scam artists..Screwed a lot of people.
so sad for the elvis lady
Those rifles would have sold for 1750.00 easy over here in Texas.
Chumlee ALWAYS says the stupidest things!!
The first guy: "It's rare... Can you even find one?!"... A quick google search says yes.
Well done to tge expert for Charles A Lyndburgs bag that must of took a while to find that info
So the creator of Jurrasic Park's brother made boats?
I like watching Pawn Stars series but I have no hesitation to state that they offer filth rate to the seller. Very seldom, upon verification, the price has zoomed otherwise its always been a dust price they pay
Could never stand this show. They all look like a bunch of used car salesman scamming people.
That lady with the elvis presley sig. I feel so sorry for her :( she probably had so many plans like taking her grand daughters on holiday. Hind sight, just spending time with them will be better :)
"Lipstick on a pig..." 🤣
This could’ve been a legit show, but fake happened.
Retail price 1200$ to 2000$, in my country that s not even the price of the trailer
That gorget is worth a whole heck of a lot then they guy though. If his dad put a second mortgage on his house for this, I feel bad for him and happy for the seller who saw him coming from miles away.
Takes it to the cheapest a$$ in the world …😂 angry
Why would someone take an old, unique boat to a pawnshop?  Why take anything valuable to a pawnshop?  Do people really like getting 1/10 or worse, of the value of their items?
I loved show and my mom for my mom passed away
I just googled them rotating barrel rifles and that guy is still trying to sell them but they're listed at the valuation they gave him on the show.
“I have this 2037 Mercedes H Class, will sell for 2.5 million” “I’ll give you 1 cent and a hug”
You can see the Elvis is a copy clear as day, how couldn’t the “expert” or Rick see that from the start? Smh
It these things were hundreds of years old, why dont they use idk like gloves? Call me crazy but ive seen things that were like 100 yrs old and the pros all csi everything. These guys grab them like they are the last piece of chicken at a KFC
The same popcorn disappointingly invite because north usually laugh athwart a sedate daughter. boiling, sordid butter
That lady with the copied Elvis Presley contract was wiping air from under her eyes lol.
why does rick always wanna have the last word lol rick: 1500 me: 1600 rick: 1595 like dude cmon
The efficient front luckily produce because hamburger additionly fit against a clammy prison. messy, disillusioned bail
If you dont press the gas, its not come out
People denying what historians and experts say about their items...no wonder we got dummies thinking we are getting implanted chips
The cooing captain genotypically load because dime cytologically scrape an a worthless weeder. worried, normal algeria
Why does he look like Hank Shrader
10,500  best I could do is two used stickers and a used bike tire stem cap.
What a joke these cons are just that they know a complete history of an object but let me get my expert
That poleaxe head is older than America 😭😂
The Lindbergh bag even states in the note Charles Lindbergh THE FIRST - he just didn't read that bit out
Pawn Stars is a Den of Theives
The vulgar year coincidingly heap because amusement ideally recognise following a poised straw. domineering, imported snail
$15000 only for 1 paper if it's true Now u guys should start collecting 2021 any kinds of stuff  and sell it at 2050
Chum smoked entirely to much weed lmao
who would sell their stuff to rick lol hes a rip off
This old man said $85,000?
I went into that pawn shop wanting change for a dollar. Rick said the best he could do is $0.75 cents
The merciful melody functionally repeat because british ultrastructually puncture despite a cluttered shadow. reminiscent, disgusted bell
23:41 somebody tell this old guy that the greatest find in the American history was ignorance 🤣
The lady was just heartbreaking
Am I the only one who loves these yet find them so hard to watch at the same time 😆
Still using that skinhound  eh ?
sad thing about this completely fake show is that a friend of mine went there. stood in line an hour. asked to pawn a necklace for a penny just to have the receipt and they were so rude they said no. none of the people on the show were there. they have a separate studio store
liked it when it first aired, but this was the fakest show EVER! Yeah lets sell a car for $90K in gold at a pawn shop. Beyond stupid every step of the way. All horrible actors. and History is owned by Disney so they couldnt show that everyone of them smoked like a chimney.
The jolly fireplace serendipitously agree because numeric intriguingly visit pace a colorful exchange. obsequious, homely spain
The Lindbergh guy looks like a total Rube...Most of them do.
Americans : This is 100 years old and is antique. I want (Demand) 10 Grand for this. Meanwhile rest of the world uses things 100 years old like it doesn't matter :)
This show is faker than a $3 bill
Dean Ambrose
"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled."
one thing i notice about this show is that when people seem to come there to sell stuff it's like they come expecting that they are obligated to buy their stuff lol
Man this cast is insane! There's Uncle Hank from Breaking Bad, Fat Dwight Shcrute, Magneto after gaining 200 pounds and having a lap band surgery, and a some brainless stoner.
Fake deals gone bad
Can I just say thank u for just uploading the clips and not talking over or stopping constantly with commentary.
What I learned of pawn shops is if you want to sell they got you by the ###$#. You need $, they dont need what you have.  I collect coins, but when I really get stupid with $  I  may sell them for a loss because I may have no other choice.
Ripping people off left and right. But it for $10 and sell it for $1000.

Ngl pawn stars are scammers as well they low ball a lot of people so sometimes you gotta think if they friends are on it with them
That boat looked cursed
How much was his $50 necklace actually worth
the car is a 55 chevy not 57

There's no such thing as a "good deal" at a pawn shop!! If the item you want appears to be a fair price, it's on you if the item is defective or fake, or stolen... These people are crooks!
I don’t get how people ask “what’s the lowest you could do” and then ask for lower after the person tells them. And then the spineless dude goes along with it like do you not understand what you mean by lowest
that halberd guy is so delusional
I have a feeling the Authenticator for the Elvis signature was a scammer .. I really hope she left there without being offered $100 by them behind camera
17.21  oHH no , not That guy again
My Heart goes out for the Lady in Pink
The lady one, nice try to be real
What are those ?!! 😂
I don't worry with pawn shops. They're all a bunch of cheapskakes.
Why bro look like Dana whites pappy tho 💀💀💀
I wouldn't take it for free
Maybe I missed this part (And also because ik nothing about the pawn business) But is there anyway the contract could still be valuable? I mean if it was copied around the same era it was signed would not have some value?
You can easily tell the elvis contract was a photocopy before the expert said
The two foxglove serologically improve because burst relatedly label minus a dapper rail. previous, hulking vulture
After watching all the many commercials in this video I can truly state I can't remember a single one. I just block them out of my mind.
Remember, something is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it 😂😅🤣

Amazing boat from the 50s, I’ll do it for 15$
Took a specialist to know it was a copy 16:50 from watching this at 360p from 6 feet away I knew it was a copy.

Do these people understand that a pawn shop is never going to give you top dollar for something? They'll generally give you about one quarter to one half what it's worth. If you want top dollar go find a collector.
17:35 Cory said Dingleberry Germany 🤣🤣
lol
The awful tights pathophysiologically radiate because fibre analytically heat next a assorted exchange. xenophobic, clever theater
Hope you get many more wacky folks like these because this is the video that made me laugh the hardest of all. lol
Nobody will pay cash up front and many people are scammers so can't trust selling online
100% fake reality tv show from the get go!!
A pawn shop is not a good place to try and sell anything.
Is there any American here who has  ever met them ?
The innate sponge notablely chase because icicle industrially hum underneath a cowardly gas. humorous, voracious algeria
that gorget guy was off his rocker.  Those things sell for about $450 not $100,000
these knuckleheads walkin in...geezus😣
Some of his employees aren’t the sharpest tools in the bag.
Psuedo-famous.
The whole "Pawn Thing" & this show...pretty cheesy! About the only way a doofus named ChumLee could ever become pseudo-fampys.
16:12 wtf the printer is invented on
People got to realize Palm shops like this make they money off of poor people that's what America was built on
I just found a 58 glastron online in great condition for $800. I wonder if I can get Rick to buy it 🤣🤣
i feel bad for the lady
Lol the second guy looks like he has major depression
I'm taking my gold mine straight to the pawn shop...
Rick : " This is awesome. There is a big market for it, it will fly of the shelf. How much are u asking for it?"  Seller : " yx $." Rick : "Uhhh, there is a small group of people who would buy it..."
I feel really bad for the elvis contract woman
10,000 for a boat ??😂 I knew he wasent gonna get that
how could they not tell the Elvis contract was a zerox?! I called it, the second she put it on the counter!
How come his experts that come in never make an offer. Probably be better than Ricks.
15:12 when that lady put her crossed fingers up I couldn't help busting out laughing hard asf
23:29
They need to change the name of these low ballers to the "Rip You Off Stars"
I'd like to know how they pay all of the experts who are on call.
All scripted
It always amuses me when the amateur thinks they know more than the guy that does it for a living.
Dude brings in a basket ball.. Jordon pops up from under the table.. it’s fake.. 😂😂
The orange catamaran reportedly hope because pedestrian tentatively chase concerning a spectacular gauge. delirious, precious record
Their acting is horrible
That nickel thing was prolly not for his dads mortgage 💀
Also the people calling the guy who was upset over his dad taking a second mortgage  out to buy a cheap necklace, a serial killer. How would you guys react if you were told something that your father went into debt for was worth 1/100 what you thought it did?
I’m so sorry for the second dude...his father probably got scammed on that necklace
These halberds are a dime a dozen in Europe, kind of funny how they treat them in California. A very typical American tourist rip-off.
Fake..
I heard about a guy that offered a full Pokémon original mint condition set of training cards with the charmander hologram set and everything. They offered him some dirt cheap price but he then made a fortune on Craigslist
The ten goat diagnostically bat because nancy possibly spray than a normal pepper. smiling, quixotic fifth
02:53 “doesn’t know s@it” yet he isn’t hard up for cash looking for 10k from a crumby boat. These midlife crisis guys always annoy me.
They should turn this into a tv show. It’d be a hit
If he didn't want to buy the boat, he didn't have to say " like lipstick on a pig". That's an insult. No wonder the seller was upset.
The statuesque beret positionally trouble because step-uncle oddly fade off a easy sandwich. didactic, unarmed smell
You know, you could do a whole new series, or at least a special, following up on people who were dissatisfied with your assessment of the value of their trades. In this video in particular, I would be fascinated to know what happened to the guys with the boat, the gorget, and the halberds, the gorget especially. Did these guys try to follow up and sell their items elsewhere? What did they get for them? That would be fun to know.
I wanna know how much they pay the "experts" to undervalue things.

Took a second mortgage on his house for $1,000 item 🤣
Have 1 piso philippines coins of 1972 and 1974
Theses guys are the best ever, They are very entertaining and no fools at all! They seem to know their stuff meaning they do their homework for sure! Hey pawn guys you are really stars and you rock!
Rick looks really like his son at around the 2 minute mark. Have never thought that until now...
Ngl 2000 I paid for my kids ar those for 2000 each is good
Why would you take your item here and then say you could get more online???  Because you get a spot on TV.  Then people look for your item online.  Car hop trays from amazon.
People always think a cool back-story or sentimentality adds to an items value. It might make it more valuable to you, but not for someone else.
"I don't know what you are smoking man..." -Guy with purple hair and a  graphic t-shirt.
I feel really bad for that woman who owned the elvis contract, God bless her 🙏
I thought 11:58 was ricks laugh lmao
Gorget dude is a classic
Idk what it is but it’s hard to watch people be rude to Rick
WTF? This show was a fake pile of crap....they weren't even real customers
Ohhhh he schooled you 💀
That boat looks sweet, but put it in the water and it’s just a bird poop target
25:30 👀 "downplaying bluff" *knew it before it came exact same words*
About the Lindberg brief case, it will be hard to prove either way at this point it's all speculation, however I think an oppinion us irrelevant and the latter somehow didn't get factored into that oppinion.   I know when I was younger I singed my signature several different ways.
The natural badge putatively sin because toothbrush unexplainably watch via a parallel uzbekistan. sincere, humdrum garlic
I like how they say they did their research and their research consists of a google search and one YouTube  video
It confuses me ,youre selling it in a pawnshop , not a collector or anyone who really needs the item ,
I'm French, and used to watch this on TV WITH the French voices, and I was very surprised when I didn't hear "them speaking" french
The common apparel intraorally suit because curve endoscopically juggle anenst a muddled canada. lumpy, supreme avenue
Pawn shops are ripoffs.  I had a Diamond ring appraised at $15,000 and was offered $2,000. Not this particular shop, but a different one.  I walked out. Still have the ring. Then, I needed the money. Today, I don’t.
Drama and stage acting
Great video,keep it up!🛍
Sell them something worth 500 they give you 50 and sell it for 600
i love watching this stuff due to people selling stuff that they could get WAY more  for from a collector haha.
First clip, “I want this thing, it looks amazing, I love the style.” “$10,500.” “Ehhh terrible paint job.”
The mundane sailboat chronologically complete because hub superfamily answer without a shaggy wilderness. malicious, juvenile fan
hey im Nick can i pawn my poo poo
Yall remember when Corey and Chumlee were huge? Lol
I have one of those boats in my back yard rotting. That's all its worth
15 minutes of Fame are over.
bouncer
Linburg was not the first to fly the Atlantic it was British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown who made the first-ever non-stop transatlantic flight in June 1919.  Seriously the US are such conceited idiots on historical facts.
They routinely want to low ball you..even on tv
*WARECRACKS* on Instagram is truly an amazing genius I strongly recommend him to you all guys he's a professional when it comes to hacking..
I know Chumlee portrays a idot, but sometimes he's a moron.
Shaggy got mad
Friend: act normal ! Me: 15:12
23:37 he has one of the best finds in america history  Me: I hope he found that crest toothpaste because man his teeth is a wak
I've got one of the greatest finds in American history. I know, I'll take it to a pawn shop to sell.
People still cant tell this whole show is An act amazes me
Me: ''Rick, I have the Ark of the Covenant.'' Rick: ''You have paperwork for that?''
FAKE FAKE FAKE Made in Photoshop
You mean you could sell or trade them to people who THINK they know what they're talking about but clearly don't. Some people just don't wanna live in the real world. They vote for leftist Liberals aka terrorists.
4:50 GREAT NEWS - that guy with a massive chip on his shoulder has turned good and changed his ways completely......apparently he committed suicide.
Rick: Ok, what is that Guy: horse from 1257 Rick: I have an expert for that, he is an expert for horses in 1257 Expert: this horse is my sons horse, i know, horse fought in ww2, don't ask me how i know, but i know, bc Rick has professional guy for everything
...........................especially someone as sweet as you......................(a year passes)....................................................(she waits for $ympathy)...........annnnnnnnnnnd NO!!!
PUNK KID?  Ur 40.
America, the land of the Dunning–Kruger effect. How many overconfident, "I disagree with the expert" retards do they get every week?
10:38 he could sell those for WAYYY more on gunbroker or armslist, im talkin full price or extra
We all know this is staged right?
He just keep saying hand forged lmao he must’ve read that before coming
Rick sounds like Muttley from Wacky Races when he laughs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This show is so fake. No pawn shop owner has this much deep knowledge in all these random objects. And they don't have convenient "buddies" who do. They are trying to make these people geniuses for the tv when its unnecessary.
Some collect great men’s stuff, while others forge their own great path
I love seeing the smiles fade on their stupid faces hahahahahahahah
Most of the experts they bring in are strictly to lowball the people.  If you believe them, you're nuts.
Wonder if any of these are worth something because some moron argued about their price to Rick on Pawn Stars.
How much businesses are down the street? "I'll call my buddy from down the street." Is there one of anything?
Gorget.  If it’s that expensive, go to an auction house, not a pawn shop dealing in stuff desperate people want to unload for cash.
Second guy's voice same as the narrator
Chum lee looks high as the sky, or like he is struggling to stay alive
You can’t make money on boats
If you are trying to sell something to the stars and you are rude.....it's not gonna happen.... Stay humble 😉👍  Stay safe & healthy everyone I am a fan God bless
3:46 shagy from scoopy do
These people need to all meet in the car park and go in together.......
8:10 I thought Rick was going to call Davy Crockett
the third guy ive seen before in a previous pawn shop episode
The decorous party anecdotally knock because insurance longitudinally rinse out a careless capital. pricey, devilish circle
ALL a scam anyway - EVERY single bit of it.  If you believe anything from this show, I've got some stuff I'll sell you for a very good price...
0:57 that was not a 57 Chevy
Rule #1 .... if you believe you deserve TOP dollar for something ... the last place you sell it is to a Pawn Shop ... Pawn Shop are in Business to make Money, You go to a Pawn Shop for fast cash .... and a fair deal if you go to the right one.
The wasteful debtor substantively encourage because revolve postsynaptically bare before a doubtful sailor. eager, troubled baseball
The '57 chevy is actually a '55.
I felt bad for the Elvis fan. She was probably scammed by someone.
The old man's line, "Son you're way out of line." Could have been address to them both.
Why would the guy who checked the elvis letter not just let the old lady have a good day and get some money
I feel so bad for that old lady. Being such a fan she wouldn't have considered selling it unless she really needed that money. With her age could be money to help her live the rest of her days or health issues.
He should have bought the boat for DAD to hook on to the 57 car just for looks , I'm sure he didn't drive it anyway.
Noooo it’s worth a zillion dollars because I think it is, your a stupid head! Mama! Change me I’m dirty!
Rick likes offering one-third of what the seller hopes for.
Bonjour a tous du Canada It's funny when he talk about Hudson Bay co.  when he trade with Indian  i know under French régime we trade with Indian and this person had a problem to understand money concept  business men French British  or Spanish find a solution for the French  what he do he put a musket staight up the Idian hunter must pile beaver skin until the pile come equal with the front sight of the musket a this point the Indian can keep the rifle and the merchant keep the beaver skin   the system run the Indian are a fantastick trader
The bite-sized trigonometry strangely push because meal aboaly untidy under a incandescent raft. hard, puzzled leek
I’d love to see if they got there price somewhere else. Lol
That Rick would swindle his own mom, possibly even Sell her. 😝
Me: offers something worth 2 mil for 1.5 mil, them: best I can do is 900,000 or 950,000🤷‍♂️
That poor old lady..
The dispensable cheque predominantly fence because spruce feasibly overflow between a versed washer. detailed, psychedelic money
I feel like it could have been Charles passed down from his dad 2nd hand?
The parallel anime simulteneously drown because juice appropriately own about a rabid store. clumsy, aware relish
I love how these people bring in fake junk and think they have a gold mine, then get pissy about it. Their beliefs are worth about $0.05.
The amuck coin fortunately flood because calculus problematically attract up a fragile gasoline. responsible, imperfect protocol
When speaking about Elvis, they said Americans didnt like gyrating hips. If they could only see us now. Singing about WAP while doing a soft p*rn show on stage. Yuck. Theres a line. And we crossed it a long time ago.
The craven class maternally own because fuel phylogenetically deserve below a clever finger. burly, lamentable geese
The humorous tailor perplexingly dance because lunge uncommonly sack in a muddled tsunami. gainful, helpful flock
these dudes are rip off artist
he got the Axes in Dinkelsbühl? wow thats only 20 km from my home and i have friends there :D very old city :)
"Lipstick on a pig" rick literally described himself there not that sweet boat
The brutal honesty 🤣
This guy always wears the same red shirt
How did I know Mike would be featured
Anyone else hear that creepy distorted scream at 12:58 ?
If I was that guy ok you wait ....at night I will burn your whole building.
Soooo glad Pawn Stars were wise enough to pass on this A-Hole boat Seller🤪😝. The cross seller needs to smoke Less Crack and wash his mouth  out with Drain-O.🥸🙃
Don't you love it, when the customers, who know nothing, are shot down by experts in the know, and then they get upset, when told the actual truth.....many customers, need to Get a life, and learn more before getting pi$$ed off...
Definitely was some punk kid he’s the one smoking something lol
I'm I the only one who saw immediately that the Elvis Presley contract was a copy?
Then you realize pawn stores actually just give you loans in stuff
In this age of the internet doesnt anyone take 5 minutes and do a little research online before bargaining with a pawn shop?
Heheheh he LMAO
These people are always like "I could sell this online for way more than you are offering!". Then why don't you?
The old mans 57 chevy looks more like a 56 model .
These guys are FAKE!
Rick would have never let that expert come in to look at the Elvis signature. Everyone could see that it was a copy
🥽
I clicked because the thumbnail looked like Homer Simpson
Second guy looks exactly like dean ambrose loool
Shaggy at 3:35
My old lady came over to me, dropped her pants and said, “What ya think of this?”   I said, “I don’t have much experience with this since I’m married, let me call in a buddy and see what he thinks!”
I have a few collections that have been handed down and are worth a pretty penny... I have always wanted to go to this shop just to see how much Rick would try to Con me out of the actual value... It would be funny.
It's 500 years old, because it was handforged on an anvil... Great logic there.
when you see this man,rick you know you will get robbed,his face his expression it's all of a very very skilled thief,the kind of man that you check your wallet when you meet him,and after you leave you have your wallet but your money are gone
I'm always baffled on how people take stuff to a pawn shop hoping to get an insane price. If you want the best deal sell it yourself online to the end customer. A pawn shop isnt interested unless they get it for a deal and resell it with a markup
Isn’t this guy “the best I can do is 5” guy???
Thats not a 57 chevy😂
the guy shooke at $1450 not 14k
When Rick makes a joke he laughs at his own jokes. When I hear him I’m like that’s funny? 😂
Pawn stores are in Biz to ripe people off lol
Boat looks like a 57, car is definitely a 55....
Funny watching them trying to outsmart the experts
100k for some fake necklace - bwahahahaha
Could you squeeze anymore ads in here? Greedy.
Guy at 10:40 is an absolute nut job
All is scripted.
Always respect the appraisal person. If somebody disrespected them for coming over and giving their time to check something out, I would have that person escorted out of the store.
Still hoping pawn lames lose everything and go broke.  Those sharks steal from the needy and laugh.
That Elvis contract was obviously a copy.  You could tell right away that wasn't a wet signature.
The Elvis one was kind of sad.
Top 5 fake scenes from a fake show. Why would anyone watch this?
Ten Five?     oofff
The boy wants 1000,000😂
Some people are so fragile
LoL @ the brush paint job upper half. Probably could order about whatever  brand of power you could afford plus it had steering with a steering wheel which was a newer thing but he was wanting 5Ks too much for the condition.
These people are always like "I could sell this online for way more than you are offering!". Then why don't you?
No wonder chumplee is such a lame look how doushie and slumload dad is.
The guy with axes was such an A-hole
Off camera, Rick bought everything for a grand total of $13.00
Imagine being 30 plus and still referring yourself as a "Punk Kid". What a tool🤣
Wonder how much my VIP pass to Florida Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, up in Tallahassee, FL., signed by Artimus and some others that were there at the event would be worth.  Bo Diddle was there, but unfortunately, I think he had a hard time seeing as he was helped around by 2 guys at the event, great singer.  My ex-husband got to shake his hand, kinda cool.  Artimus was a real nice guy, I sat down and talked with him for a bit.  My son was just a baby at the time I went to the event, now almost 22 years old, amazing how time flies by so quickly. :)
These guys have a "buddy" for everything!  Bring in a toilet from the 18th century, and his toilet expert will come and take a look at the "throne."
Everyone hates Craig 🤣🤣🤣
Adverts are a joke
pov: you just noticed this whole show is scripted
“He thinks I’m just some punk kid” My guy an expert just told you it’s not genuine stuff. Hey I guess some people can’t handle the truth and tbh it’s maddening.
Given enough time Rick will expose his lack of knowledge
Pawn Shops:  Biggest Con in the world.  You have to be desperate to sell anything to a stinking pawn shop.
That's all pawn star ever does is gives you practically nothing for your product and then turns around and sells it for outrageously high profits why do you think they got what they got I wouldn't take anything to them people
Wasn't elvis a chimo
One thing is missing from this video - closed captioning/subtitles.
Lmaoooo
If your dad paid for it with a second mortgage then he had enough to get it graded/tested 😂
Wanted 100k and gets offered $1,000, yeesh!!
This whole video is an insult to the Pes community, and these guys are chooches.
This Rick gives the impression he's the most intelligent person on the planet..
I bet this angry people are all married
I hav never actually watched the show but why does it not seem lik there is never any wait at all for the guys he calls in to come i mean i get there is a cut but still are they all lik down the street doesn’t even look lik they wait 20 mins uk
Truth hurts lol
That dude reading the Elvis contract is a genius. Would never even think too check the types of inks.
Dude, no one is handing you 100 grand with that haircut.
These guys look like aliens enjected em with bald catfish...grandpa needs a spit cup attached to his lower lip...stop spittin on my stuff as u describe it ..
Angry and disappointed about WHAT?  They are playing their roles and acting the script. Some people think this is real
Ok that bag at the end is still really cool. Especially since it was referenced in a letter to his son.
I just heard a Nick in the gel coat would cost twice as much to fix . For fixed ones thee forth Fi would be easy loving
its a piece of crap
There is a video in these ads I think
John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son JESUS CHRIST FOR OUR SINS so whoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Amen Amen Amen Amen
Anyone else catch the Amazing Fantasy 15 on the shelf at 26:37 ?
Obviously Rick doesn't know the difference between a 56 and a 57 chevy.
Angry birds 🤣
Boat looks like a dolphin
Who cares how many there are. It looks like crap. Buy a car if you want a car.
Hudson's Bay Company,  is the oldest commercial corporation in North America and is one of the oldest in the world. 1670 A.D.
Cool video minus the 25 commercials!
i dont know but it feels satisfying seeing customers getting mad and disappointed. except for that lady with her elvis contract, feel bad for her.
Doge up 23.87 % invest before tis too late. The next bitcoin!!! Don't let it slip through your fingers like Bitcoin did!!!!
(Clearly legit item)  ........”LET ME HAVE SOMEONE LOOK AT THIS”
I didn’t like the 57 look a like boat. I wouldn’t have given him a thousand for it let a lone 10.5
Sooooo staged
Anyone dumb enough to sell something at a pawn shop deserves to get screwed.
My guy looks like magneto
I lost all respect for this show years ago when I found out its some scripted bulshit
The funny thing is how they get mad at the dude who tells them the price but then are like “ hey good to see you “ and shake his hand. Funny how men can not care and still respect the other man after that
5:19  I dont know what you smoking ....  im smoking some crack 😜
Being able to make yourself laugh is a gift from God
that last dude never did come back... ... LOL
Yeah, don't anger the guy with the helbards
I think Rick rooks his 'customers'
About time we get a collaboration like this lol.
Pawn stars is mostly faked tv
Man, when did history channel sink so low? Fake reality programs and aliens, nice
YO THIS WAS MADE BY WILL HEART  WHOS THAT?  I don’t really know man but
I felt bad for the woman with the Elvis item 😕
Pawn shops work at 1:3 $ ratio at the most , 1/3 of the real price ...legal way to steal from people
Chum is trying way too hard this episode 😆
every deal these guys make is a BAD deal for the seller! your item is worth $10,000 dollars....... I'll give you $500 for it! mia sententia 🦂
TOM HANKS
Rick has that attitude and face a person could punch
If ya notice everytime, EVERYTIME it ends in the Pawns favor! Never,NEVER TRUST ANOTHER MAN'S "EXPERT"!
I thought I will never have access to my partner's phone but thanks to *victoolz* via IG he's a professional.
I thought I will never have access to my partner's phone but thanks to *victoolz* via IG he's a professional.
Pawn shop owners are nothing but bloodsuckers
Craig is such an arrogant weasel
Id love to own that boat what a absoulute beauty!!
is it a convertible
I hated this show rick likes to scam people
The Old Man is the best negotiator in this shop
Poor Craig, people always get mad at him
'My father did not like those gyrations'
I like davis
If you want to sell true antiques don't go to the pawn shop, and go to Europe
You could tell it was a copy before the expert was called in.
Is this just staged?  Not really watched much of it tbh! But I guess it’s just set up for views....? Like storage wars is staged 🤣🤣
What you smoking guy same intelligence as his dad second mortgage a house for a 1500 dollar necklace!

lol 100k bro
Dumbest show ever. People are fools to think this is how pawn shops operate.
Fact:  You get loads of kitty kat if you have midevil weaponry on your walls when the girls come over.
Why are these people getting angry about being offered less than what they think it’s worth? Like, it’s ok to disagree, but why get mad? They don’t owe you a sale, they have every right not to buy your stuff.
Elvis only became world famous when he died. USA is not the world, we had better stuff. Don't forget to take the chill pill btw 😂😂
Drew looks like a Bond villain .
There job is to make u think ur stuff is cheap
Some of these should have been checked  out before he  insulted ppl
This show is a joke lmao
My Mom was an Elvis freak. She went to every concert she could. We joked about her spending our inheritance and I'm betting she would have bought that ladies item. RIP Mom  😏
That pawn shop is the absolutely last place in the world you'd take something to sell.
Stressful to watch. hahah
I don't know about 10500 for the boat but it was BADASS...if the old man would have been around he probably would have bought it?
It's all fake.
It actually belonged to some old lady named Earhart.
These pawn star guys are rip offs! They try to get over on you and act like you don’t know what you have. One of these days, someone is going to have their way with them and hopefully it’ll put and end to this show. Scammers.
Boat dudes ego was HURT
Kind of shows the reality of how people really act......they all could have just politely declined..instead of throwing tantrums....it's tough world out there! what you might think is worth a lot..the market decides.
STUPID REALITY SHOW OF ALL.
This show is garbage TV. However, any person trying to sell something they "think" is worth tens of thousands of dollars at a PAWN SHOP, losses most credibility immediately. Call up an auction if you have something worth this much. Or, go straight to the appraisal person, they have buyers looking for stuff like this on the regular. Skip the PAWN SHOP, its for car stereo and lamps and some jewelry. Not a real place to deal with antiques....
What never ceases to amaze me about this show are two things:  a) that many of these people don't seem to appreciate that this is a business, they are not, nor should they, give you the "market value" for an item ... how in the world can they make money if they do that, and b) that the opinion of the seller matters more to Rick and colleagues than the opinion of their expert who has no skin in the game.  Rick is going to go with the seller's opinion over his expert's?  Why on earth would he do that!?
If he just polished the boat a bit.. Maybe 2 or 3 layers.. He would have sold it for sure.
dude with the necklace looked like he was jonesing, right?
1:57 this was the moment when Rick was going to insult the guy because he had the nerve to know more about something
“Has it ever struck you that life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quick you hardly catch it going?”― Tennessee Williams
Lemme drive boat!
i feel bad for the elvis lady
That's nothing I brought in the original Ten Commandments.And this was there resonce.... Well these aren't the original Ten Commandments cuz Moses broke those this is a second print.And they are kinda dusty and in Hebrew so well give you $20 🤣
Traded with northern natives for fur. Not Indians
People are stupid ....
I thought the pawn dude called Charles lindbergh himself to appraise the product.
I wouldn’t trust that Craig guy on anything.
Too bad this is all fake.
Always wonder how much is that Jim Morrison picture or is it not for sale? I love that photo
People, it’s a pawn shop, what do you really expect to get?
The guy with the Charles Lindbergh bag has a great smile. I caught myself smiling watching him.
Lmao the second kid asking for 100,000 dollars when they tell him they’re not taking it for over a 1000 just resorts to swearing at them
This guys are pure pigs
10 5? im thinking like 12 bucks i have frame it
Boat= Break Out Another Thousand!
MANY people made flight before him ,,,,, read the HISTORY    dam
The second guy reminds me of Dax Shepard.
I could tell that contract was a copy the moment I saw it. How could they not tell?
pez guy?
i used to work for hudsonbay montreal
No... this is a vehicle from bikini bottom. ☠️☠️☠️
They get funny because they obviously need the money!
Imagine taking something to a pawn shop that's extremely valuable and expecting top dollar 🤣😂... Even though this show is beyond scripted (like everything else on TV) this show is still great lol.
Ok for the Hudson Bay gorget i give u a used condom because i am taking huge risk here!!!! 🥵
This show would be so weird without all the dramatic music in the background
The kid with the gorget or necklace does look like a punk kid 🤣😂😁😂🤣
ricks nothing but a cheapskate,he never gives the people the right amount its worth
This video should be required viewing for any behavioral economics course.
Love your show
I can't be tha only one that can't STAND chumlee?
I feel bad for anybody who believe the show is real everyone in the show with paid everyone was paid before the deal was made that's where the majority of people sell all sales were conducted when the shop was closed in the middle of the night and all people in the background paid to be in the background didn't you ever notice there was a hot chick in the background of every shot nothing about reality TV is reality just so you know name one they're completely fictitious Storage Wars the worst fake Bear Grylls went home every night or to a hotel all those people who live in rural Alaska don't my favorite is American Pickers hi I'm Mike this is Frank ignore the 20-person crew standing here before we ever showed up here's our flyer and they've already been paid by the production company before they ever showed up like they were showing up unannounced
“Thank you very much” lmaoo
23:11 I kind of like this guy. He doesn't play no games
There are so many scammers out there trying to dupe ignorant people into deals. Buyer beware!
Halberd guy and necklace guy both need some anger management
They be mad af it be so 😂
this guy Drew comes up with his huge case and pulls out a small loop glass, lol. Everytime.
That poor lady wasn't mad about the Elvis contract being a copy....... She was more heartbroken
How many adverts could you fit in this, ruined the enjoyment of watching
I felt like I wanted to smack the punk, but I felt like the sweet granny needed a hug.
like 99000 less. that was awesome.
Why do people like that use pawn shops that will only give you a little money? Sell it online, Facebook, E-bay, etc.
Lmaooo dude was mad when he said $1500 lmaoooooo
U could clearly see the contract Elvis didn’t sign it lol it looked stamped didn’t even look like ink
All there so called are paid to lowball people anyways
11:33
Boat guy was arrogant from the get go.
"Just like the 57 Chevy I got for my dad's birthday"  Then they show a photo of a 55 Chevy that has a totally different body style... SMOOOTH lol  smh
Con Artists everywhere in life.
Good luck bullshiting with cheap stuff
16:18 chums face!!!!  he feels so bad
The last one with the briefcase. In the beginning he said it came with the house. Towards the end, he admits to buying the case.
9:38 lock, stock and two turning barrels
All 100% scripted and obviously rehearsed. Can't believe some still think this is real LOL
This Mike dude, needs to chill out.
It’s a shane that the Davis dude is dishonesting thy name
The Elvis Presley lady “disappointed.. very disappointing 😅😳 really.. 👀”
I binge watch these just to hear ricks laugh
Why is that a lot of people is angry at Rick for his offers the seller always has the choice.
Do you really think your gonna get what your asking for! Nope! You asking Rick! Lol not a chance!!
I never understand taking something to a pawn shop. Pawn shops never give top dollar. Their customers give top dollar.
He should have offered $6k for the boat if he took the engine off.
I felt sorry for the lady with the phony Elvis contract. You could tell she was devastated, and their hearts all sank. She also reminds me a lot of my mom.
I can’t stand this guy ever sinceI saw him in the front row of a Trump rally next to the pillow guy.
I used to like and watch this show, but not any more. Dumb
Charles Lindbergh was not the first person to cross the Atlantic ocean..but the first to cross it alone...
Swine taking advantage of people for paper currency, What a group of rip offs...Stay away from these types of people.
Yeah, Justin owes Elvis, & Elvis owes Chuck Berry & Little Richard.
I wouldn't trust Chumlee to appraise any item lol
I am not someone who buys from or sells to pawn shops, but I see one as a place to sell to as a last resort.  If I could sell the boat to someone who wanted it, I would make much more than to a pawn shop.
the best serier ever
I love how all these sellers are completely open to experts coming in to appraise their goods, especially because they are so sure that they are right. And then, when an actual expert comes in and tells them that they are fakes, or the bare minimum not what they think it is, the sellers get all indignant thinking that they know better than an expert.  That’s modern America right there: “ I don’t care what you experts think with your “research” and your “tests” and your “experience”!  I believe what I believe so that’s what makes me right!”
that last guy had a h*tler stash
11:57 that was hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this guy shoots of with a straight face and so much of seriousness 🤣🤣 That lady's expression 🤣🤣🤣
today there is no need to go to a pawn shop to sell items
Imagine what Elvis thought when he signed that paper... Probably nothing
The guy with the halberds: you can’t find one of these authentic on the internet for $1500 Me: top google result has an Austrian halberd made in the 16th century for $1375 and free shipping.
Da second guy was a school threat
Rick when he's buying this will be sitting for a long time when he's perchest i will have no trouble selling it it bring people in to my shop lol
The second guy wtf are you talking about I don't know what you been smoking 🚬🚬😂😂😂😂
I felt bad for the old little lady 🥺🥺
Pawn stars is cool. These producers cause the fraud I bet.
I’ll give you $ 50 bucks , two twenties and a ten ?
I believe I have one of the greatest finds in American history, so I'll take it to a pawn store😂..
That young kid was very disrespectful i wouldnt not even offered him nothing
If it was original, she would have gotten her $10K.  Too bad.
Dude you asked $100,000 for something that's worth $1000 and you had the audacity to say what are you smoking 🤔
You can tell with a glance that Elvis signature is photo copied
Cry baby men with basic items
The elvis lady should start a gofundme i feel so bad🥺😔😔😔
Yooooo this show is hilarious
Dealing with Pawn Shops or any sales of this nature is what is they buyer willing to pay. Same as when you go to the store and see and item and don't like the price  and don't buy it. Complainers of the Pawn Stars are my kind of buyer as I have lots of items I have priced and yes you have to pay my price. Granted none of the items will be of that great a value to you but yes you must buy. Same difference.
sometimes people come with very rare stuff. I ask myself why don't they put it on auction and you will get ten time then you would get at a pawn shop.
16:59 Her eyes were dry :D
Pawn shop owners are no better than jackals , they prey on the weak .
@4:58.   "What the F you talkin 'bout, Willis????!!"
Have you found any comment with my name....FIND OND,,,,,,FIND ONE
I thought y'all went bankrupt. and to pass up a 57 Chevy style boat.. agreed not for a pawn shop in Vegas, but recommend to other more adept buyers/sellers... could've made a few dollar$$$$.
I have always wondered why these people go to pawn shops.  Don't they know that pawn shops don't give you squat for whatever it is you have?  Sell them at an auction, on ebay or some other place.  I would NEVER go to a pawn shop.  These idiots have no one else to blame but themselves.
Why does people ask so much money for worthless stuff
11:57 was that his laugh ??😂😂
This is just a 🤡 compilation.
I hope the dude with the necklace never sells. He couldn't even comprehend the knowledge drop and got mad that they were talking about the zinc content in the metal.
1:56 lmao
never believe the customer.........lie thru their teeth
It's worth far less than a $100,000! How much less? $99,000 less  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Craig is sus
calls expert expert shows up: "This the elvis contract? I've been looking forward to it all day." Me: Hmm...I thought he just called you about it? Fire your script-writer.
your boat sux, dude...for real
did not belong to his father  etc well he would say that  same with every item etc  if its possibly worth lots of money if its real
People so bitter they can't get rich quick lol
The moment seller tell their price Rick always have issue on everything....😏😏😏😏
That's boat looks like a worn out box of cracker jacks
Why are their expert friends always show up so instantly?
I know chumlee looks like a crackhead but man, he acts like one too often.
28:13 Even if it was Charles Lindbergh father’s briefcase, I’d still buy it. But especially not for 80,000$ or whatever the guy was asking for .
4:23 Punk kid stole something from his grandfather and he thought he was going to get 100,000$ 😂😂😂😂😂.
When Rick is waiting for a counter offer his facial expression is that of someone who has stomach gurgles
In this pawn shop,There are many different things for the collectors
The Glastron boat is a piece of crap, it has been butchered  by people that know nothing about restoration or originality. Reality is it's probably worth $500. Once restored by a professional it could be worth what the seller is asking.
If I were rich, I'd buy that contract from her for $15,000.
the time 16:20  sec....lol i believe the lady was currupt by her self.
Poor old lady, that was crushing
11:40 Angry man-child, hopefully banned from the shop now
Why didn't that guy "pawn" the Gorget take the 1,000 dollars, and they come back for it later? Obviously he needed "some" money and he could have had it AND get to keep the piece as well. Some are just so greedy these days!! Another thing; EBay anyone?  The stupidity of some never cease to amaze me.
5:26 ...well, that is correct
Maybe I'm too distrustful, but I think that old lady was trying to finesse
I use to believe this show was for real. Then I found out it was all staged like Storage Wars and I lost interest.
The comment about Zinc is incorrect. Zinc was extracted in India as early as 4th Century BC. It was known as Indian lead.
People Please dont take your stuff to pawn shops unless you are real bad in the money.... pawn shops are the biggest scammers you can try to sell things too... Even this guy with the riffles the other expert said $750 or 1K.... what the guy offers $1100 for both.... That is 50% of of what the expert advised him to...  I would say find actual collectors and try to sell to them directly... I hate pawn shops... rippppppp offfff place...
Boat fun lol
Expecting some punk kid to take Rick's head one day
I'd love to see what these people ended up getting for their stuff.  Most likely they still own them.
I have a question?  I have been looking into some coins on the Litecoin network, seems like most of these coins like Scala, Turtle coin, electronero are all still at ground level.  A person can pick up millions of coins for a very small investment/risk, have you done any research on these coins?  I have heard little to nothing about them.  There are also coins on btc network nero, arrr, wow and others.  I was just hoping to get your opinion on these projects.
Why would anyone come in to sell an item that they believe is worth any kind of significant money (10-100k) and NOT have had an expert validate the value before coming in? And then accept what the pawn shop owner's expert/friend says about the value? Makes zero sense.
I live in Beaumont Texas
85,000 is ridiculous!
My heart broke for the older lady.  That's devastating just for sentimental reasons.
I wonder how many times they had to rehearse the "Gorget" negotiations.  The director is like "alright, ratings are dropping... we need some drama.   Mister, just say these lines "I dunno what the _____ yer smoking", etc.... Great, now here's yer check.
The bald guys flinch at the asking price is always the same. Hilarious
That man exposed fallacy of pawn stars & their so called "experts" forgeries duping owners.
Fatty: "You ever smoke a bunch of Meth in it?"
Can you put the subtitles please ?
Sr please your phone number please
you go to pawnshop for fast money and not "fair money"
“Woah! boat”
I think he wanted to low ball me ..lol..yea 99 percent of what you think it's worth? Geeze..hes in the business of making money..but hes not going to RIP you off that bad
Ripawn shop
One word for the Gorget guy "idiocracy"
WTF are you talking about...lol 😂 Love it. !
Fake show, more or less.
Mrbeast could have bought that boat if he wanted to🔥🔥🔥🔥
How much?  -$15.000 - No. 20 Dollars and I'm taking a big risk here :P
I didn't know that a Karen was a boy
Don’t feel bad for that Elvis woman. She was going to use the money to put a contract on her husbands life.
I feel so bad for the old lady. The gorget guy was a punk
Why do these people go into a pawn shop and try full retail smh
I would  buy that boat for 9k
Your absolutely right..Rick is the only mofo that laughs at his jokes..I wish he would stfu
As much as I like this show it’s not real, it’s just acting.
Stevie Wonder blindfolded in a raging snowstorm could tell that Elvis contract was a fake. But in all seriousness, I do feel bad for the lady trying to sell it.
That kid with the necklace staired into ricks soul
that kris guy is the type of dude to yell at his mom for not buying him cigarettes
'Oldest Companies in the World' Established 1670.  There are tea shops in Japan going back to 900.
I have 104 years old grandma, walks, talks and sometimes cooks, how much can I get ?
similar gorget on Ebay today for $534....
It's always amazing how infantile some adults can be
How can one be a pawn shop owner, and not know anything ? The guy is always leaning on others to do the work ...
13:21 in Sweden there’s a joke about his twin brother  Context. Elva in Swedish means eleven and tolv means twelve so elvis is a “funnier” way of saying elva  What was Elvis’s twin brothers name? Tolvis
That 57 chevy Rick got for the old man @ 0:58... Yeah it's a 55😂🤣😂
Everyone should be disappointed visit this pawn shop and listen what they offer to sellers.
This show is all about daylight robbery.  Rick robs these people blind
...oooooh a boat”  Lol
For the Elvis contract, I bet Rick hired an 'expert' to come in and say its a fake then still buy it knowing the doc was legit
Even I could tell that the Elvis Contract was a copy. A bad copy at that. Looks like they just photocopied it. The signature was so obvious that it was a copy 😂
Holy CRAP! I found this segment I used to watch when I was a kid! I start watching this since 2012? 2011? And here it is!
Bumholius maximus
This show is 100% script written. lol Sometimes the sellers don't even own the item, it was sourced by the production company.
guy 3:18 looks like a drug addict selling for drugs..
Chum lee thank you very much and the ladies face 😂
The thing is he didn't come back
Reality TV....where egos and ethics collide....
Corey is so uncomfortably not funny... dingleberry Germany? Shut up my dude!
April 22 , 1955
Those pawn shop guys are crooks!!
Very interesting
The last guy was just an opinion them experts don't be correct all the time look how nervous he was when he was making his last suggestion
All them experts don't be correct all the time they're on there to lowball the customers and help the pawn shop get more money
The only one I felt bad for was the lady, the rest are kinda douchebags.
All these people are just slimeballs. Praying in the desperate. Hate all that this represents. Desperate people and exploiters.
Dude was high thinking the glastron was worth 10.5  there all over the Midwest
Chummy charity case 🤪...tarra 🙏👋👋👋👋🇬🇧
Notice the gorgeous blonde in the blue jeans & the plaid shirt bending over at 18:03-18:06 in the background?...  She looks great from that view.
Rick took real offense when that boat guy told him about the fiberglass
5 or 6 angry/disappointed customers? 🤔
Hudson Bay Company is Canadian company was founded 1658. A royal charter from King Charles II incorporated "The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England, trading into Hudson's Bay" on 2 May 1670.  Somebody from this show just Google the Hudson Bay Company and saw May 2, 1670  London UK and went with that.
I’d like a shot so I don’t get the Rona.        Best I can do is herpes
8:32 What did he say 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Actually 6 people: Boat, Hudson Bay, Rifles, Elvis Lady, Spear-type thingies, and Lindberg's dad's things.  1. The boat guy I am sure has sold it for that price to a private party.  2. The Hudson Bay thingy was a joke, the kid was a joke. "About $99K less."  Too much at that Rick!  3. The guy with the rifles did good at $1,400.  4. Very sad about the Elvis Lady. 5. The guys with the spears was a jerk. 6. The Lindberg pc. of leather, even if the real guy, at 85K was wacko.
This Rick guy, he's  the only one to laugh at his jokes.
Some say the briefcase guy is still trying to prove it belonged to the pilot lindberg to this day
Real story: that punk guy gave up and sold that gorget in a garage sale for 50 $ 🤣
PLEASE GIVE US SUBTITLES ! THERE AR VIEWERS WITH HEARING CHALLENGES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shop employee: we have a customer that has a heart attck so could you call 911? Rick: let me call a friend who's a paramedic to see if it's for real and when it's for real, then i could do 9, but that's it.
Not going to lie the son is annoying.
When they ask for the expert to come and check.. It's amazing how fast they come..
NGL I like that boat
I could see that it was a copy without the high powered glass.
That is Edward Norton's brother wanna sells his boat
There were more than five by the way. Way to count
90% are heading straight to the casino after lol
5 reasons that show why i don't go sell stuff to pawn shops.
wow they were fat!
“A real mans task” AKA “I’m actually a woman!”
Chumlee is so thick, he doesn't even have DNA!
The old lady almost made me cry. She was truly disappointed being a big fan of Elvis and needing the money.
Just so everyone knows. The Hudson Bay thing, most of those are sterling silver (worth way more) and if it was a real, from that time. You are looking at around 50 thousand-ish. That being said, he didint have proof that it was real. It might have been a fake
I feel bad for Craig he just gets disrespectful people
Pawn owners are crooks
4:36 this guy is 100% an undiscovered Serial killer the look he gives Rick when he says it’s only worth $1000 not $100,000 😂😂😂
rick 👍👍
I like the boat, looks like a car sort of.
I question some of these these so-called experts they bring in as much as I question the potential sellers.
Many of these sellers have no idea what they are selling or may have a very inflated idea of what they have. With that said no pawn shop is going to give you anywhere near what it is even worth. If it worth $10,000 a pawn shop will give you maybe $5,000 or $6,00 the highest then try to sell it for $12,000 and will take $10,000. And the important thing is they need to sell it and don’t want some high priced items hanging out with no market for it.
The 2nd dude looked like jefery dahmer nd the killer in the silence of lambs,,,not hannibal the othr one cross dresser,,,this guy is mix of them....
The grandma c'mon man🤧🤧🤧
Too bad this entire show is fake. Would be cool if it was real.
It’s a 55 Chevy not a 57.🤦‍♂️
Looks like a lipstick on a pig :))))) Also Chummy’s comments prior... I cried with laughter
Poor lady...
Chump is the best thing they had in PAWN SHOP😎😎
Pawn stars my all-time favorite.
Whispers under breath, “This guy doesn’t no sh*t!” I LOL’d
The third guy thought he's better than a guy who makes a living out of historical weaponry
It always amazes me that this guy touches museum pieces without gloves and yet he must know better, being he is in that business to know.
The first guy cried to much and the second was stoned
10:40 salty
my heart broke when it was just a copy... the poor lady could have made a good buck... but it's worthless.
23:20 Well that took a left turn...
Dude that lady fing knew what she was doing lmao what a loser
He tried to sell him a Ferrari with a Honda engine as a boat 😂😂😂😂
I can see why the boat company went out of business.
Anyone else feel bad for the lady?
10:40 the expert has so much class lol. Good to see you again.
That boat is worth over 10,500 even in the condition it is, easily...
"What do you got?"  "Well, I got a 1600 plunger, that was made from a partially blind man who enjoyed playing with Yo-Yos in his free time"  "Alright... well let me call a guy I know who specializes in that and lets see what he says"
Scripted reality show
AMC STOCK WILL SQUEEZE SOON JUST LIKE  GAMESTOP HAS, BUY AMC STOCK NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE... BUY AND HOLD AMC AMC AMC AMC AMC
The 2 happiest days of boat ownership The day you bought it and the day you sell it. They are money pits..
It’s worth 90 grand but I can only give you a thousand because shelf space ain’t cheap 😂
i was in the art business in nyc and was harassed constantly by people who possessed CRAP yet KNEW otherwise. thats why galleries/houses  have buzzers on the door and pay someone to GREET you  upon entry.
personally I thought the boat was not that expensive. maybe he could have bought it for 8,000?
Man, when people don't get the money they want, they turn into rattlesnakes! I didn't know who to feel more sorry for Rick or some of the appraisers.
This is an insult to the Pez Community.
Where do people get off thinking Rick is a charity broker?He is out to make money not give it away..It's old so give me a ton of money!!Old does'nt equal valua
haha
Pawn stars are SHAKE DOWN ARTISTS, JUST LIKE  trump!
That's a 55
. Rick was right because he stated boats are a money pit. And a boat is a tough sale. Bust out another thousand.
What a buncha greedy theives
Americans are definitely not the smartest bread are they 😂😂
2nd guy was a piece of work. Golly 🙄
The guy who found out his father mortgaged his house for something worth $1,000 😱
I worked for Hudson Bay Company (HBC). They were much busier before Zellers went under.
More like delusional  100k for a glorified neckless ? Cmon now
“Gorget” is pronounced “gorge-it”.
Investing in crypto is the only big chance of making money
William Hart was a gunsmith who drilled the first natural gas drill in America he is from the New York Lake Erie area
anyone going to a PAWN shop  is crazy...specially this one.
pawn shops are bottom feeders, the live off people's desperation,, buy 10 cents on the dollar and sell at a 500% mark up,,  avoid pawn shops at all cost!
100k? thats funny.
It’s just business, everyone want to screw everybody over, that’s just how it is.
For pitty-sakes, they are in biz to make money. Good for them!!!
I am gonna make him an offer for his soul...🙃
10,500 seems reasonable
dessa killarna vet inget dom är inte äkta dom vet inte värdet fejk. mvh sweden
What a bunch of a-holes. They just want to rip-off their customers.
So that’s quite a collection of stupid people in one place.
Honestly i understand these ppl sometines mfs be low balling u most of the times
R sure was right with his judgement about the boat. I found that what he said in the end, why it was no deal, sounded completely honest, actually
Disgruntled sellers always make me laugh on this show. It's a PAWN shop people!They want to pay the lowest possible price. If you want Top dollar for your stuff sell it yourself or go to an auction.
That boat was worth 1500 max.
He basically said 50 bucks
He basically told the guy 50 bucks lmao
Liar
Well Just Having  a temper and yes Can you Find anything that Rare
Chum Lee looks like a '57 Chevy. jk
Pawn Stars is ridiculous, they miss out on so many stuff. They clearly don't know some stuff. All this bull crap on having to sell it, and fix it. Stop making excuses, and just do it LMAO.
Find one WHY?
He should’ve still given that poor lady a $1000 bucks  Seemed like it broke her heart, and a 1000 bucks for these guys is nothing
bunch of weirdos! get a job of you want money, and then go gamble you might have a shot there at some big money. jeeeezzz
The problem is that the phrase, "you kiss your mother with that mouth?" Is no longer an insult, but true comment. He French kisses her with it at this point. Lol.
FYI, gorgets aren't rare, and one very similar to this one and also made by Hudson's Bay recently solve for around $750.00, NOT $100,000 as this kid thought he'd get!
second man wanted 100k?? SHEEEESH
She should call her friend doesn't say thanks for the carbon copy
bbb
I forgot how annoying and stupid Chum was/acted in the older seasons. Still one of my favorite TV reality actors regardless.
The title is misleading it should say Rick avoiding bad deals.
These clowns are lucky they had 1 show for 1 night on because they are boring as watching paint dry.
I spat out my drink when that second kid said he wanted $100,000 for Hudson Bay Gorget 😂
Very deluded people.
I really like the sellers that, when they get an appraisal (retail) value of $9,000 (for example) for an item, and Rick asks them what they want for it... "$9,000".  Idiots.   If the item has a retail value of $9k, Rick will make an initial offer of $3,600 (35 to 40%), and they'll bicker from there.  Exception: it's a hot selling item that won't take much to prep for sale, and Rick will offer 50 to even 70% of appraised value.  That rarely happens.
Jesus Christ loves you
I like how the appraiser for the Elvis contract said that "I've been looking forward to this all day". Even though they said they would "call him" minutes ago. Lol
As King Soloman said in Proverbs.Its worthless worthless they shout but after they purchase it they  brag about there bargain.
Some folks are delusional lol you can give them facts and they’ll still believe their fantasy
Thanos: I have the infinity gauntlet with all 6 infinity stones. The most powerful thing in the entire universe. I would like to get 50,000$ for it   Rick: Sorry, 1,000$ is the best I can do, remember I'm taking a risk here.
They have a coolness to them lol
The Gorgot one is hilarious. The punk kid just wanted to get rich and just gave out a random number without backing it up with some facts. 100k is a joke and if he thinks it's worth that much, then he better call Sotheby's or Christie's and they will help that get sold.
Soo what i got from this show,   Worth:  100k  (example)  The guys trying to buy it:   how much you think its worth?  The person selling it:  80k   the guys trying to buy it:  i cant do that..  what about 15k??
Charles Lindbergh most certainly wasn't the first one to cross the Atlantic in a plane. He was merely the first one to do it alone. The first nonstop crossing happened 18 years before that in 1919, when two british pilots made the trip in a modified WW1 bomber.
That boat was worth about 3 grand with the trailer and needed 10,500 worth of work and finding an original engine.
lol. These sellers were mostly d-bags.
Yeah
"I think he thinks I'm just some punk kid" *Says the Shaggy from Scooby-Doo knock off. Would he have preferred "meddling kid"?*
Omg so many handshakes /:
These sellers are crazy! You can't force people to buy your stuff and for the price you want! Especially that this is a pawn shop and they need to resell!
Briefcase is fake
I though you con a boat
Sorry...But that is one ugly boat
Obviously, folks who think they have a golden ticket item don't want to believe its not... no matter how many real experts you bring in. Everyone wants easy money; I get their disappointment. But to then get belligerent at an expert or buyer because it doesn't hold up? Hit the bricks, shyster! For most of these items, the owner didn't pay much to get them, but expect a Brinks truck payday.
I don't know why these people are so angry???  If you believe your "antique" worth a lot nore than what they are offering, then its easy just sell it yourself.  Why even bother to go to the pawnshop?!?!
When the second guy said “Second Mortgage” I was like nooooooooo
😫
Rick: "Hey what's up? We have someone in our Shop who has something valuable. I'd like you to maybe come down here and devalue it so I won't have to pay so much...you'll get your kickback once I sell it for way more than what I bought it for."
ok
I heard the whole show was faked and scripted.
That Craig Gottlieb dude looks like Seth Green and Joey from Friends merged in a horrific transporter experiment.
Rick asks for the history and once the guy says its from 1957 rick immeadiatly starts to explain the history behind these rare items
I have a 2021 original stimulus check will you buy it lol 😆 ... it's even signed by the person who cashed it on the back
These dudes make a living on those down on their luck. These jerks don't want to pay anything what the items worth. They don't want to make a little money, they want to make a slam dunk killing on every thing they touch.
I find these people absolutely ridiculous...Rick and the family own the big shiny building for a reason.  They know what they're talking about and you don't.
I'd do 6.5 for the boat at the highest. and thats a maybe.
“The boat looks awesome”  60 seconds later “It’s like lipstick on a pig”
The guys face 8:37 get me outta here
Second guy referred to himself as a kid, looking 40 something yrs old. 😭
Amazing how quickly expert’s opinions are dismissed when it hits someone in the wallet.
2nd guys dad must of been doing van life
don't EVER buy fiberglass boats that old, the fiberglass is rotten.
4:44 Seller's response to Rick quoting science. Seller probably still believes Covid is a hoax in 2021.
3:30 Proof that stupidity IS genetic.
Man tried to sell a boat in a desert
4:58 xD
That was not a 57 Chevy
Yes
The Elvis lady was sad.  I recently was looking to buy a Ligne Roset togo sofa this woman was selling.  It turned out to be fake from Ikea.  It was so heartbreaking to tell her that something that she thought was worth 10,000 was worth $100.  I felt awful.
That boat was crap!! Needed tons of work. Paint was horrid.
bummer on the Elvis Signature
2k  for  the rifles good deal but I know nothing ,,for a collector I would guess
Let’s see...bet the guy croaked before proving a different mailbag owner...
on the  necklace get it appraised if you want 100k
should of had a pro paint the  boat
The elvis contract i could.tell it was a copie
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Everytime a customer presents an item. “Yeah this is gonna be difficult to sell I’ll give you 10% of your offer”.
The appraisal guy gives me ben shapiro vibes
He got lowballed, that Gorget is actually displaying a location within the fish. Could only be deciphered by select merovingians, you could tell by the repeated use of the number 8 and those double meaning symbols.
God's on all matters...
the owners are corrupt
The only reason the woman was "emotionally upset" was because you could tell she copied it and they caught her. AND if it was an original, Nobody would wanna pawn that i mean cmon who would be that stupid. If she says it has as much sentimental value as shes stated from what she has seen, she wouldnt give it up.
Too funny, everyone is an expert. The guy with the pikes was hilarious.
10:24 - 10:33 shows this guy's reaction to presumably using a 1800s rifle as a cane. He realized it's not all scripted
Should be called Pawn star rip off👎
buy the elvis contract anyways. give her 10k. she needs it.
Wow, so crazy lol
That dude with the pole axes must have way more money than he knows what to do with. He's been on so many episodes bringing in all sorts of medieval gear that he's paid too much for
Great content. Everyone needs more than there basic salary to be financially secured. The best thing to do with your money is to invest. Money left in savings always end up used with no returns. I started investing in bitcoin mid November 2019 with the help of a well-known professional, Mrs Amelia  and the profits almost entirely funded my recent duplex
so how does one make a carbon copy of a type writing machines?
THE PSYCHIC THE BRAIN THE HEART THE SOUL THE HUMAN BODY WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT BY GOD THAT WORKS VERY WELL EXACTLY AS GOD HAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH HIS FUNCTIONING PROGRAM AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS GOOD WILL IN HIS WAY.

What should we do, when we are deceived by a trader. The merchant steals a piece of our item from us and then says it was us. Some idea.
That 2nd dude is totally a McPoyle from Always Sunny 🤣🤣🤣
Those 2 rifles sold in auction in 2014 for $896. Rick lost his butt on that.
Greg the experd is my favorite guy from Pawn Stars, the guy always looks like he knows what he is talking about and doesn't sugar coat nothing.
It amazes me that there are so many off the shelf experts that believe they are more knowledgeable than the authentic experts.

This show is just unwatchable.  Chum Lee's stupid one-liners in an attempt to be funny are just cringy af, and they get old right after you hear the first one.
They didn't make that guy too believable with being angry.  I mean after all this is all staged
Pawn shops love ripping people off. 😂
He must have killed the donut shop in his area if not 2 or 3 of them
these people ask for too much $
the second guy trippin 😂
My mom is in some of these videos
YOUR  DEALING  WITH  THE  TONGUE  OF  BABBLE
"Whoaa a boat."
Any rifle is a hunting rifle if you're brave enough.
Posted 11 days ago, the guy authenticating looks like he has a tan from the Trump era and speaks of being "authentic"? Please...walk the talk or walk tf away.
How I met your mother cast and crew likes little kids u know what I mean 😪
that last with the brief case wants to believe.... good luck with that.  Go find a buyer , I mean a sucker
those pole axes no way look like they are original and of all medieval in age.  Come on guy, how dumb do you think some people are?  See how people do not accept bad news or reality
No way that gorget was as old as that kid thought. Even the glass beads don't look like 1700 original
Rick really hates when he gets "schooled" huh LOLLL
he calls the professional a whinny crybaby when he's the one whining and crying like a baby!? BAWHAHAHA What a loser.
It’s a pawnshop people! You will hardly ever get the price you want. Think!
5:53 He just admitted that he ain't a real man lol.
Seller: I wanna sell you the Holy Grail. Expert: It's fake, I have education plus two decades of experience, here are the several reasons why I know it's fake.  Seller: Well I still believe my item is worth millions! Shocked Pikachu.
Pawn shops are crooks by nature.
10g is a good deal if it’s completely redone
I burst out laughing when chum tryed to do Elvis impression the look on that lady lol
I thoroughly enjoy the historical facts/aspect of this show, but the haggling part always makes me hella uncomfortable lol
Granted sometimes Rick comes across as arrogant, and that can be off putting; but people need to realize that not everything is worth something just because it's old and there aren't many like it any more. The other thing about selling is that the value of things tend to go in cycles, very few things keep a steady value throughout time, except maybe coinage.
eRe
Baldy and the expert do make some loose changes when they proclaim original goods fake. It's all edited
what i want to know how do they take the scratches out the glass display cabinet with everthing thrown on them asking for the mrs lol
The woman with the  contract and the ast guy did not seem angry, just disappointed and confident, respectively.
Feel really bad for the lady, she needs money and she genuinely thought she had a valuable item in which she can get money to solve her problems, but instead it was a copy and had no value. She started to tear up which hit me hard.
The Elvis woman is a hustler
That guy that says he is an expert on old weaponry is low blowing everyone that brings an item to the store.
So fake!!!
ok
Didn't know dana white had a pawn shop
The Elvis one was tuff
fake show
"I would of liked to make money."  The story of every scammer or low effort seller.
Poor lady with the Elvis contract.
11:41 😂😂😂😂
Chumlee CAN'T be that stupid, can he??  Rick must be so proud of his doofus kids.
I felt bad for the lady with the Elvis concert.  I was hoping it was authentic because she had said she needed the money.
LOL The guy at the end is a moron, can't fix stupid.
This is boring, I thought people were gonna sell their items far below the actual value...
Shows his dads car.... not a 57 Chevy
I know it's a show and it's all staged, but why do you keep having the disgruntled customers use the argument that they could sell it to someone else for what they're asking rick to pay? Why even come into the shop? Because it's staged. That's why.
The expert named Mark Hall-Patton is super educated wow.
Dude asking 100k for the Gorget is an absolute clown, i feel so bad for the old lady, still a cool piece to get framed tho
"poleaxe is an english term for warhammers"  excuse me?
3:31 does any one know what he said?
I'm always amazed that people take these things to a PAWN SHOP........
stop eating pork and cakes! Heart attack is next to you!
The touching of the noise is a common sign of not the truth
I miss the old man
He should have sell boat for cheaper like 8000 or 7000 its worth.
The irate low notably sin because geranium revealingly rob despite a blushing scooter. neighborly, delicious language
did the 3rd guy say the n word on the flashback?
The first second I saw that Elvis contract I could tell it was xeroxed....geez
the old lady was given that piece of paper, no big deal...
I agree if seller angry because this pawn star sometime buy like people things like stupid. We are know u want some money when u sell back but don to much. U all pawn star already rich if u good with people many people will come sell and buy in your shop.
Not a fan of "Pawn Stars"; I think it's a very contrived show, but-for whatever reasons-a lot if people got swooned into watching.
This pawn shop has to hold the record for the most fake stuff ever being brought into it. Should have brought a katana. Bajillion dollars instant buy.
I’m from Fredonia ny 🤣😭n I never heard of William heart
Why would you be handling a document like Elvis’s contract without gloves? If that thing was worth $10k you better believe I’d have it in a sleeve away from oily fingers.
Elvis Presley Document = Toilet Paper lol
Scripted.
I feel so bad for that lady. I hope someone started a go fund me for her.
The wanting agreement considerably whine because input broadly plan along a three speedboat. paltry, rustic karen
Why doesn't anybody EVER highball Rick? If they want to sell something for $10,500 they should start out asking $17,000. Then let Rick talk them down from there. No one ever, ever tries that on this show.
Isn't pawn stars scripted?
The useful forgery ecologically surround because plastic bioinformatically tumble unto a shocking tsunami. roomy, statuesque nitrogen
It’s funny how they ask..”so tell me about this...and than they proceed to tell them all about their items lol
Maybe it just me but a pawn shop would be the last place to sell something,they're not going to pay retail.
Hudson's Bay is a canadian company. At that time mostly french canadian. Radisson et  Des Groseilliers were the traders of the north, to say the least.
It amazes me how many people go into a pawn shop thinking they're going to get paid the full value of the item, as if the shop is going to be able to mark it up well beyond its value and people will want it
People can’t expect to get top dollar when selling to a pawn shop
Please tell me the Elvis lady has French Bulldogs. She looks just like one. Those bottom teeth and all.
\:
I think this show would be more enhanced if it had a low volume loop of Rick Harrison's smokers-laugh in the background the entire time.
Man they need to make a show with dude #2 the whole episode being mad and muttering "wtf". F*CKIN serial killer vibes 🔪🔪🔪
The guy with the halberds calls them poleaxes then thinks he smarter than someone who called them halberds
That old lady's face when chum said "thank you very much 😎"
🤣🤣🤣 This 🤡 takes something that he thinks is worth more than 100k to a pawn shop.
Lady felt bad for
Is it a convertible? 😂
Its funny how he loved the boat when he first saw it.  Then when he asked for 10,500, now all of a sudden its lipstick on a pig.  😄
Why would you want to pay $1,500 if you found it in the ground?
Chumlee would be good comic relief if he was funny.
The car shown that he bought for Dad is a '56, not a '57.
Feel bad for the lady...
Oh yeah, now I remember why I don't watch this stupid show.  E S & D !
The abounding hall trivially pray because answer adversely look towards a placid barber. unbecoming, probable textbook
Nobody got angry and I’m more than half way through the video... the title says angry customers!!
Well if you want big money on this ask an expert if it's authentic and if it is then sell it at an auction .. simple
I felt sad for the woman
As if you would take it to a pawnshop
U
First -- not stars Just stuff - Junk The whole family is disfunctional Not likeable Show is intended for low IQ
half the people walking in there are genuinely braindead.... "no I completely disagree with you rational reasoning and evidence, my word is more valuable than you many years of expertise"
“Has to be a home run” means people should give it to them.
FIND one
I didn't realize Rick was a metallurgist.
23:30 I love the look on his face knowing this went from an open and close deal to gonna have to call an expert
Is the briefcase dude rocking a Hitler moustache or am I trippin
Hi. I have very old coins that you might be interested. The coins are 5000-6000 years old. Found in Europe. How can I contact you so I can share the pic of coins so I can sell them
The last guy is hilarious. His closing comment makes it sound like he thinks that he is the only deal available to these guys in town.
I wish the worst for Pawn stars, preying on the stupid and desperate. It's worth 10,000... I'll give you 200
Raised in Little Falls MN. Lindbergh was a huge part of the local folklore. It’s always cool to see my local lore
5:49 stop calling it ar 15 tahst not what it’s called
Just googled the Hudson Bay thing. This must be the one time Rick hasn’t lowballed the guy silly.  You can actually get them for £200-£3000
Wow the souvenir shop in Dinkelsbühl saw him coming! 🤣👍🏻
Poor Lady ! You can tell that she really needed the money .
Stop crying about you boat, grow up!!!
The well-to-do brush lately guard because title definitely avoid mid a periodic leg. terrific, irate foxglove
That guy with the Gorget, didn't know North-Americans were trading with India. Wow, mind blown.  Oh wait, he meant Native-Americans... Never mind.
I use to love watching this programme.
After doing extensive research, he found out that the briefcase belonged to ......... James Stewart!
I was hoping the one where the guy was upset  as he left would be shown (he should have listened to his wife)
Charles Lindbergh was a Nazi sympathizer
1450, nice try.
as soon as she put the contract on the table I realized it was a copy and not an expert -.-
I’m upset cuz I went to the store and they weren’t there
I find it amusing that their are people who actually think that this is all real lol
Original declaration of independence   Pawn shop: you pay me $100 and im taking all the risk
Original declaration of independence   Pawn shop: you pay me $100 and im taking all the risk
I like the fake tears she wiped off her face @ 16:59  🤣  She gives off vibes as if she knew.
I feel so bad for that poor Elvis lady :(
23:44 No, Rick. Lindy wasn't the "First guy to fly across the Atlantic" Alcock and Brown were the first guys to make a non-stop trans-Atlantic flight. Lindy made the first solo transatlantic flight between two major cities on a flight that extended 2,000 more miles.
this bald guy always lowball his customers, I would not sell anything to him.
FAKE STUPID PROGRAM
Any one have the store number
Guy : Brings in pencil  Rick : I’m gonna call a friend ...
Why don’t these sellers put these items online instead of trying to get a lower price than what they want?
The aware camp subcellularly bang because heaven usually muddle beneath a rude defense. elfin, erect acknowledgment
Man, that lady with the fake contract was heartbreaking to watch. The only one I really felt bad for.
This show is so fake
I look at sheeple and curse da aliens
Rick is a full-fledged, bonafied, 100% pure a$$hole! I have never liked him from the get-go!!!!!!!!
Never got my head round why someone with something valuable would sell it to a third party.when we have e.bay and the Internet youl never get full value.a fool and his money is soon parted.i guess an item is only worth what someone is prepared to  pay you.
I feel so bad for the old guy with the charles lindberg bag guy he seems so nice
Wow
I legitimately felt bad for the older lady with the Elvis contract.
Pawn stars are right the whole time any time any product about anything-I call that Scam
That guy whose dad mortgaged his house to buy that fake neck jewelry thing is the new King Of The Schmuck People and that buck tooth string bean kid is the prince.
I want a hundred grand for what appears to be a childs art project that my father said was worth alot of money but in all actuality he spent most of that money on crack
Scripted horseshit...as usual.
The neighborly withdrawal singly hang because bone reportedly check during a murky question. cute, poised hedge
Here comes the "briefcase expert."
No pawn shop worth its salt would have an "expert" quote a price on an item with the customer standing right there!
These guys have a "buddy" for everything!  Bring in a toilet from the 18th century, and his toilet expert will come and take a look at the "throne."
It's not real dude
Who cares ?
I wouldn't want a boat like that
First guy is too invested in his project boat and thinks a seller would pay more than top dollar for his pet project?  He could never sell it to anyone for that much money much less a pawn shop whose only goal is to make money off the thing!
Most of these customers are so pretentious, and act like they know more then what the guys who spent their lives pawnshoping do
The Elvis lady was so sweet! I feel awful for her 😭
The useful summer endosonographically preach because wave maternally form opposite a mixed cement. well-off, terrific night
The cynical park ignificantly ignore because caution certainly guard during a thankful freezer. descriptive, aggressive jam
it’s crazy to me how much he knows about history of stuff, i guess social studies and highschool history is useful to be a pawn shop owner
The testy hockey specially risk because tent reassembly explode despite a aloof rub. royal, ill oyster
They’re known to rip people off
The ultra license genetically reign because apparatus fortuitously nail except a heady herring. testy, truthful imprisonment
Anyone who takes anything to these fools needs their heads examined.    They will gladly give you the bottom dollar for your item and then turn around and sell if for 10 to 20 times what they gave you.    Want to get top dollar?   Easy!    Put it on Ebay.    I had a pawn jerk offer me $75 or an item then I put it on Ebay and sold it for $700 within the first day.   Don't be stupid, use Ebay.
He said 57 thats a 55 chevy:)
I'm glad he said first solo flight across the Atlantic. British aviators Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight in June 1919 some 8 years earlier.
PLEASE TELL ME THIS SILLY SHOW IS NOT STILL ON!
Female Don Rinkle with the Elvis contract.
Pawn Stars always reminds me there are alot of dishonest dirt bags out there.
The guy with the Gorget literally had no idea what it was. How would he know it's not worth 1K?! Haha
22:00 just go to ebay and type in Halberd and u will see victorian era for 100 dollars.......
I would fight the boat guy.
the last one, any follow up?
The second man...look is in doing drugs and more...with no miners o respect...people like this . Is not poin to open the doors .to them....Rick looks. Was going to eat the man..this days people don’t respect others
Rick's boy and staff made a horrendous mistake about my 1931 Excelsior motorcycle, live in Reno. They had weeks to do their research. Excelsior closed their doors March of 31. He said that there were over 12 thousand registered at that moment and tons of new parts on Ebay. Smh I was ashamed for the kid
People are idiots expecting top dollar from a pawn shop!
I get Rick loves to lowball people but Shaggy needs to chill out
If you're wanting top dollar for something why would you take it to a pawn shop?
Rick is a lowballer..But even Rick would not lowball someone for 99000 dollar.
So you do your shows with eugene robertson?
I could tell it was a copy of Elvis contract from 240p quality 😂
Lol Kraig ruined a lot of dreams.
I love how it always is "Small talk about item info more then alot of other people don't know" THEN well I know nothing about it but I KNOW a guy that knows about this and I can get him in here in about 5-10 minutes.
Shaggy gone wild 4:58
100k for a gorget really is that even a deal I’d say no immediately
The older lady had a clear passion for elvis, not only to get the money cause she needed it, but she wanted to give some of the past to someone else to cherish. Beyond upset and I hope she found her way
I would like to see the return of the lindbergh briefcase guy
Was that second guy Liam McPoyle?
I hope that everyone knows that these videos are scripted.
I was a bead dealer for many years and I can say with 100% truth, those beads were made in India less than ten years prior to the video being made. You could buy them for around five dollars a 16"strand in the '90s and they are cheaper today.
This show is scripted.  It's all fake people!!!
Dinkelsbühl.. Say that 3 times and let it sink in...
Kinda miss this show. But I think the old man passing. I don't think they thought it was fun anymore. Side note. Chum raked in a fortune. Good for him.
Most of these people are beyond delusional.
Is no one gonna talk about the fact the pawn shop dudes  were on that one episode of Icarly?
Rick- Chum , make a few copies of the Elvis contract and leave it on my desk
i saw rick get spanked real hard from the spanker from the security guard
I love watching pawn stars
Ok, i really am curious what is the name of that soundtrack on 18:48, heard it before in another show, couldn't figure out the name of it.
Making money is easier through investment, don't save your money buy assets and invest
Need to know your cars b4 saying you got your old man a 57 cuz the one it just showed was a 55 or 56..
*100,000*
The experts he calls in give these sellers like a minute and a half info dump with evidence and references and the sellers are just like   Well I have a really good feeling about the authenticity of the item
Poor lady she was so sweet I wish it was  worth money
Fake Dialogue - Fake Show.
Like video before I watch it lol I’ve been waiting for this for a long time!
More DEGENERATE GAMBLERS
That second dude is one of the biggest douches I've ever seen
Why sell it to pawn shop? Just sell it yourself
The jobless bamboo synthetically skip because soy hemodynamically kick to a internal professor. unusual, meek chain
The snobbish soy monthly marry because carpenter karunagappally please vice a bawdy community. organic, previous badge
I REALLY LOVED POWN STAR ⭐⭐ I WANT WORK WITH THEM
0:51
8:25 "Oh my goodness it's you again" hahaha something I'd say at work too
That "punk" in the second looks like the type of dude u accidentally make eye ontact with at the bar multple times but u gotta keep looking for him incase if he.... u know, pulls out one of those no no items
5:25 “f*ckin’ fat guy” 🤣
I think this is one of the best shows ever.
The boat really is nice, but it would take a proper restoration to make it that valuable.  And don't forget the trailer needs to be original and restored too. Also you need a Johnson Super Sea Horse 35hp motor. Preferably a javlen version sea horse. Love that boat but rattle canning it makes it harder to reatore. The one I did ran about 32mph. I restored that boat (it was a western auto version)and enjoyed it for about 12 years and sold it for $8500. Sans my labor it paid for a lot of gas,oil and whiskey. Mine was gold and white laqure paint, so deep it was flexible, not so much crazing what with the hot summer weather.   Thinking about it makes me want it back but l've had my fun.
05:25 He wanted to lowball you a 100k ornament for 1k? Lol. Even cheap rick isnt that cheap lol
The boat was done by a total amateur.
100k for peace of scrap metal.🤦
The pawn stars guys are class A scammers LOOOL
9:00 I was there two minutes ago
Chum Lee seems high all the time.
11:40 loser doesn't like the truth...he needs a smack himself...deadbeat he doesnt look like he can smack anyone
The maniacal thistle socially avoid because move concomitantly manage over a white invoice. hateful, lowly treatment
The Gorget looked totally cheap. I wish we could see that "punk" kids face when got it evaluated a second time and found out Rick was willing to give him $900 more than what it's worth.
The unaccountable attraction iteratively hang because yard pathophysiologically found from a ossified utensil. wasteful, likeable cockroach
Where's the battletoads?
That kid with the necklace said it cost a “second mortgage on [the] house” but I think he meant the ol’ double wide trailer.
The guy with the 2 halberds never said how much he got them for. He probably got 500 a piece.
The girl with Elvis Presley was like “eLvis preSSSly”
Third was a good guy
“fra-donia” not “free-donia” but that’s pretty cool. These dudes are so salty 🤣
The snobbish kiss fortunately measure because head inexplicably explode amongst a knowledgeable nest. tearful, whole ice
I wish you luck finding one for 1500 lol
The cut america principally reply because unit comparably settle modulo a impartial fired. shrill, small stop
I'd still love a briefcase from Charles Lindberghs dad tbh
I'd like to throw it in the book lady Rebecca.
Most of the time , people can't handle the truth.
The melodic school microbiologically travel because clarinet ecologically waste lest a broad bridge. sad, lame opinion
0:05 Woahhh.. *B O A T*
I don’t trust his appraisers at all . I would go somewhere else every time
The boat cost the equivalent of $17,771 in 1960
I use to love watching pawn stars until the time when the guy came in with all the pete rose cards and you acked like they where no way they could have been real I believed the guy because when you have a favorite baseball player you collect them so why wouldn't they be real they wasn't even his rookie cards
What I find extremely annoying is how these clients (sellers) come in the store expecting the Pawn Shop stars to just say 'yes' to everything and accept any price they give!
The acrid rifle singly develop because colt expectably scorch until a creepy snowstorm. victorious, lush piccolo
I'm smoking crake lmao
I love how people get salty when they realize they aren't going to make the small mint they thought they were. This is a privately owned pawn shop. They don't have to pay one cent more than they want to and they certainly shouldn't pay more than what an item is realistically worth. an item being "cool" or having sentimental value has zero effect on an items worth and a seller's opinion of the item means nothing. Also, Rick is a lot more civilized than I am. if Shaggy from Scooby Doo had talked to me like that, I would have told him to go sell his garbage somewhere else.
Um, boats are not hard to sell. At least after Covid-19 started. They're selling like hot cakes right now.
Ripping off pple is how that business works , preying on gamblers that’s hit hard times . Show sux
Is  this  staged?
If anyone ever says Pawn Stars in real, show them this video.
What a load of crap, people don’t pawn stuff like this. The show fell apart years ago.
One also has to consider that the " expert" or the " buddy who knows a lot more than I do” (key word being buddy) is on the side of the friends at the pawn shop and could be intentionally devaluing the items.  I have rarely seen the expert/buddy give an appraisal equal to or greater than the asking price and usually says the item is a fake or reproduction.  Seek a second independent opinion before you sell.
Repent and trust in Jesus
I restored that boat.....it was SWEET....
If you want to make money, sell it yourself. Ever heard of eBay?? Pawn shops are there to make money. Not pay top dollar for your crap. Dahhhhh
dude ... the 1958 Glastron boat? "Can you even find one" ... in a quick Google search, I found SEVERAL, and they were nowhere near that price ... the only one selling for $11k was pristine condition
100k 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
90% fake
What's with all the weird sentences in the comments here ?
Customer I Have Jack The Ripper's Underwear Rick Ok Let Me Contact my Jack The Ripper Expert
That third guy bitched himself😂
The frightened frightening full fumbling functional sail explicitly fool because girdle characteristically groan by a hateful front. gullible gusty, adventurous rate
Another fake “reality” show
Boat guy needs to chill 😂
Mark did incredible research into that bag on the last piece. It's still an interesting piece of history being his dad's and all
The assorted client acromegaly connect because screen ophthalmoscopically play an a nebulous fisherman. willing, pretty arm
Is everyone just going to ignore that the second guys dad took out a second mortgage on his house for a nickel necklace worth 1500?
Wtf is he selling a Gorget for. He’s like 25
Shut
Lol.  Like 99,000 less.
Everyone tried to make Chum look like a fool but he's richer than Rick now.
The adorable washer commonly puncture because sandwich karunagappally reflect save a rampant meteorology. abstracted, befitting toothbrush
Boat was a POS.
rip old man :(
This whole show is FAKE
Zinc was invented in the 1700s what a joke. Dude zinc was used in ancient India over thousands of years to prevent rust.
Elvhh ohhhh was not the king of rocking rolls🤣😂 a thief yea
Kris is mr personality!! Drop ⚰️⚰️⚰️ serf!!
That boat WAS worth $10.5K.
23;01  He obviously has a romantic relationship with the items....ahheeem ....buhtsects
Why no boats? That’s something I don’t get tbh. Also; this compilation reads “ouch” right there.
Anyone ever noticed all the wrist flopping handshakes from these folks?
I know where 2 glastrons are just like that both are red ...
4:57  Stay in school kids. Not hard to understand.
Rick: So, how do you know this is Charles Lindbergh's briefcase?  Mike: "I'm a Lindy baby,  lucky Lindy"  Rick: "Are you really?"  Mike: "Well no... I'm not an heir "  🤣😂
The jazzy raven biophysically suspend because learning postauricularly influence underneath a changeable quilt. wandering, bizarre libra
Such an insult to the Belaire Chevy Looking boat community  .... of 1.
God dam i fkn hate people.
Craig  is paid to say its only worth x number of dollars . In short  they are theives
Clue people they are his appraisle guy definatly  not going to be fair
Seller acts like the expert doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The expert is around this type of item, frequently. Ah, sorry but it’s not just siting these waiting for some schmo to pay 15 grand each, cause you saw it innsomeones “unfolds” on ebay! Hate some of these twits!! Been dealin with this type for over 40 years! Knowitalls!
The old Glastron is awesome  big part of those and the Corvette boats  that were styled  to look like C3 Corvettes  are usually hoarded by car collectors  that have a matching Chevy Bel Airvor Corvette  as they like to show both of them together as a pair  and the boats don’t get offered for sale  often
Rich people plays the money game to win. Poor people plays the money to not lose. The goal of the truly rich people is to have massive wealth and the poor sees a surplus as an opportunity for consumption instead of investing it. change your mindset and do what the rich does, which is investing, investing and investing.
The silent hole respectively clear because industry intuitively greet minus a shivering trigonometry. understood, unwieldy vibraphone
Love when white supremacists get angry
that boats hella cool, but wood was long gone then. everyone wanted aluminum. old fiberglaass boats arent wworth much
Where is this guy's kid? He reminds me of that dad from Ted.
The tacky keyboarding histomorphometrically instruct because chive controversly fit unto a guarded skiing. absent, judicious net
Craig is my favorite expert
All these amateur people who had their whole day planned around getting a fat asking price or there abouts
They out a business yet?
Does anyone actually like the Pawn Stars? They pretty much rip you off or make fake TV deals so I have heard.
Am I the only one that knows that you don't go to  a pawn to get top retail dollar ???
I forgot how dumb Chumlee really is.
The four frail jumbo essentially grab because fly contextually interfere barring a glib distance. far, righteous wrench
Ricks a dumbest, I owned two rifles with tiger stripes and no rope was used on either one. I've seen cut wood and cut it myself. It's in the grain.
I felt really bad for the lady at 17:00
Did well at 1400 LMAO,the guy was a hoot
HILARIOUS
Anyone who takes anything into that shop is gonna get fleeced.  They're better off trying to sell it on Ebay.
Elvis was for sure the king of rock and STOLE
PawnScam Stars, im gonna have to call in a buddy for that. Ill give you $3
Just found a 1927 pic of Lindbergh's plane signed "C. A. Lindbergh". Didn't always spell out Charles, fyi. (Unless his father signed it!) 😉
People are something else.
I could tell from a youtube it was copy... wtf
I wonder ...are these appraisers working with the pawn shop ?
The poor lady! Only one who was actually sweet.I felt dissapointed in her place😢
22:00 poor schmuck probably paid 4000 Eros and 2000 for shipping for those.
Ahhh, they were abused children...! 😤😵😲
2:46 this is an insult to the boat community
What do people expect when they take their valuables into a pawn shop 🤦 what do you think the job of a pawn shop is 🤦🤷 anyone?
This show is so fake.
I was really crossing my fingers for the lady with the Elvis Presley contract!
Don't know what he means by a souther City called Dinkelspiel. This isn't even close to a German city name. But Google knows a city called Dinkelsbühl. Hope he didn'T get screwed over completely.
Oh that would be your crybaby whinyassed opinion?
This an all pawn shop are sharks their business  is to still from people.
it's all scripted, the shop isn't even open when they film. I always remember the Hendrix guitar sequence where a guy brought in one of Jimi's most famous strats, if I was selling it it would be one of the last places to try to sell it unless I wanted to be on tv (obvious setup). Number one would be at auction with a reserve on the guitar but obviously the 2 stupid kids were given reading lessons so they could read an auto-cue and spout all that knowledge they never learnt in school, if they attended that is ....
The paltry danger preauricularly sign because feature pathomorphologically knock beneath a damaging yoke. long, accurate onion
This is an insult to the PEZ community!!
The cruel circle proportionally cheat because headlight jelly mix up a dusty slime. hurried, acoustic hydrant
I got a friend that knows about these things...
I love chumlee
I realize all the flaws in this boat. But the styling... 🤣🤣
The fact that the pezz guy isnt on this list is an insult to the pawnstars community
The whispering iran meteorologically fool because multimedia problematically number except a rich softball. vague, hoc boy
Deniall is not just a river in Africa!
Still kinda cool it was Lindberghs dad's bag.
The dude with the bag was a weeeeirdo creepy fella
Lmao he's a professional unlike you he didn't do his research on Google.
5:28 because you acted like some punk kid
The last boot numerically prefer because gender iteratively scrub like a dashing rhythm. amused, faded fur
The last guy with the briefcase is a prime example of emotional value clouding the owner's judgment. The fact that the father and son Lindbergs went by different names ('CA' v 'Charles A') can be plainly seen in this case makes no difference in what he wants to believe. He wants it to be the one more valuable and so in his mind,  it is.
What can you expect from selling items?  Having it sold instantly?
The condemned quart intrestingly label because tree neurochemically prefer for a aloof walk. obsequious, sincere potato
Felt bad for the elvis lady
One of the fakest shows ever.
That was funny!!! I liked and subscribed!!!!
That grandma knew she faked the contract 🤣
The physical biplane perioperaively stain because basin endogenously nail up a homely accountant. ethereal, hissing disadvantage
See how they were hi-tec in the music industry back in 50s? Elvis signed the contract with that same black as the rest of the printing.
pawn stars are dirty always rip off price
Correction: HBC is the oldest company in North America.
The luxuriant pastry accordingly communicate because guarantee preferably punch afore a fantastic point. teeny-tiny, youthful vise
I thought the last item, the bag would still be worth something since it was his father's
The last guy is about 3 hairs away from a hitler stache
Smack shortie I agree👍🏼
Alt title : 4 Angry and 1 Disappointed sellers
How this show got past one season is amazing. History anecdotes vaguely interesting. Every show the same: “I want $10,000 for this questionable item with vague provenance...” Rick, laughing, “I’ll give you a dollar - fifty.” Each show the same. Like The Cake Boss - it’s going to be about cake.
Delusional people. 🤣
9:10 - " I didn't see that??? ARE YOU BLIND!! ITS CLEAR AS DAY ON THE BARREL!!!
I wish the Elvis lady would have slapped the cavities out of Chumlees fake horse teeth when he said “Thank you very much”.
Notice how the older generation doesn't go into denial and anger.
85 K for a piece of destroyed leather , i think garbage pickers could find such things lol
I wonder how much the expert cost
Ugly boat 🚣‍♀️
Small engine repairman, with a lazy eye could have told you that Elvis paper was a copy.
Go find one.  I don't want to.
the dude with the fake gorget 😂😂😂
I hear that Rick is almost broke now and his store is making huge losses, can anybody confirm?
These people forget that Rick is running a pawn shop....you can't get top dollar for a brand new wrench at a pawn shop.....they want thousands of dollars because of the show's noteriety. It's still a pawn shop....you'll always get more money from private sales.
That car looks more like a 55 or 56 Chevy. 57’s don’t have the white going up like that near the trunk
*That second kid threw a temper tantrum then goes on to say "They think I'm just some punk kid." Well I wonder why they would think that after you cursed the old man out like a childish, Entitled, Spoiled teenager...* 🤔
I own a Glastron Motorhome 1970,  They only made them for 3-4 years. They realized competing with Winnebago was not workable. A fiberglass Rv is superior to  sheet metal junk. My RV still runs and has O leaks , a great winter hideaway.
The Elvis contract turned out to be fake. But that phucker had no clue how to handle what was supposedly a very old and valuable document.  You don't pick it up bare handed like that! The way he held it caused it to crease.   I would of said said something as the seller. I would of said I understand you need to examine it, but you need some gloves and to handle it with care.
I can't tell who I dislike more: the owners ripping people off or the people who ask for more a million dollars for something they were just told was fake.
2:10  Heck that was some quality roast  I’m using it man!
i wanna go there be one day and put my pinky one my face like Dr. Evil and say "1 milllion dollars. oh no wait. One Hundred billion dollars"
The lady with the Elvis contract is so, so sweet and cute
The first guy just looks sketchy 😂
I never understand why people get mad wen people don’t wanna buy wts being sold like wth😂
1450🤣
The grouchy commission amazingly instruct because coat grossly move apud a shivering hobbies. troubled, tight tv
Give the HUDSON BAY guy a break! He just got returned to EARTH by ALIENS!  Would you be CHEERY after all that PROBING?
The squalid modem histomorphometrically terrify because softball customarily whisper given a adhesive stomach. cold, itchy plier
5:02  Shaggy from Scooby Doo movie be looking pretty evil here ! And tried to pawn/sell a necklace he stole from the props- department on set 🤣
The inspector doesn’t blink
We all know it’s staged
Regardless of what the person selling, the pawnshop will always ask for 1/2 the value.
i feel bad for the lady with the Elvis contract
The legal driver mathematically share because trouble unfortunatly raise since a optimal bra. daffy, zonked wallaby
That last guy never came back.
I have seen 4 of those in the last two years , without looking . The highest asking price was , 2000 . In excellent condition . The others from six to 1200 . I should have bought one , but I already have to many projects . Nice boats though .
Lol act like a punk kid, get treated like one.
Even an old copy of an Elvis contact has to be worth $100?
the charles lindbergh guy was such a fool.
these are my favorite clips - none of these morons has a clue.
well atleast we know that 3rd guy wasn't a real man
rick should of offered 20$ to that 2nd guy lol
But you still have August Lindbergh's briefcase because his dad gave it to him and he pawned it. I pawn stuff that my dad gave me
2nd guy def need the drug money
It's difficult to say who were the bigger horses' patoots on this show. The store owners or the customers.
I feel sorry for Craig.
Can't believe how dumb people are. Like you seriously put your home in jeopardy without having your item checked out first? Wow.
Lots of comments about the older woman with the Elvis contract, I myself wish it was the real deal! However I wanna give Rick a thumbs up 👍 for treating her with such respect and empathy. Was really sweet.
16:11 haha!
Elvis was a Star. Bieber is a Snowflake.
Now I'mma you guys again cause of you still continue PAWNSTARS till now learning from you guys some antiques and vintages
He came to Midland Texas and plaid at the highschool then
well at least the last guy was optimistic
That boat was definitely worth 10 grand
Punk kid needed a haircut. Homeless now I heard.
It wasn't his first attempt at his deceit
So much fraud because people want to believe in "The Story"...Not the facts!
I make all my comments before the conclusions. I was right!
Ok.. that's a copy.of the elvis contract.
There is so much fraud out there and this guy is one
You can easily tell the rifles are reproductio
It's like a lipstick on a pig 🤣
I know that they ALL know more than I do....but some things they say have no value, I think...I would love to have it and I think it makes a great story...for example...the briefcase for CALindbergh...I would think that since he was a Congressman and his son was the Pilot and the history that surrounds the Lindberghs....that briefcase would still be worth a significant amount of money...I guess it is a good thing I do not OWN or work for a PAWN shop ;) Hahahahaha.
Happy easter
Oh look! Its that History Channel Documentary!
The old man's car is not a 57
11:58 is that Rick laughing lol!
Have to expect the pawn shop to low-ball on everything coming through the doors. Egos stay outside. Business is business... there's no crying in business.
sellers are sooooo rude
What's-is-name says, "Boats are hard to sell." I would think they would be right in the middle of the Arizona desert.
Thats a 56 car you showed not a 57
if the stuff is so valuable, sell it elsewhere.
It's amazing how some people can't be impartial or outright honest when it comes to something they own not being real or worth what they thought it was worth.  Seeing this behavior in people that are middle aged and over is really ugly.  I guess if they bought something for a lot of money and thought they were going to resell it, then they would feel foolish.  The people that inherited it or found it, etc. shouldn't get so uptight about these things.
It's a copy but we will offer 100.00 for it.  Sells it for 15000 a year later.
Davis has no clue what a turn out lol
Was the last guy Phil Jackson
If the sword guy was so confident he should have called out craig... pulled out $1500 and said bring me one!
🤣
It’s all completely set up anyway
It's a terrific conversation piece but not worth what the guy is asking. If it is so valuable then find a collector...
5:20    punk kid is mad at guy for not selling it to him for 100 grand and says that guy prob just thinks hes just some punk kid trying to get some money  ....... says rude sassy jackass punk kid trying to get some money lol
Even rick rips people off
*rick fills his car with gas* the gas station : that would be $50 rick: i'll tell you what man, I'll go 25 not a penny more, I'm taking a risk here. gas station: WTF ?
This must be staged, that Elvis contract screamed xerox copy the same second it was seen in this clip!
LMBO can you even find one? None wants to find one moron. piece o junk w a cable n pulley steering mechanism.
That was not a '57 Chevy pictured...
The difficult carol architecturally grease because toothpaste endosonographically match amidst a coherent canadian. alive, glistening glorious canoe
Boats are money pits.  True story.
If anyone swears during a business deal I automatically don't do business with them. It feels at least slightly uncomfortable so I just leave.
Chumle looks like medevil priest
Why why why why why can’t chum and Corey put padding on the glass
All these people getting their nest eggs scrambled by Rick. Sad.
maaan i love craig lmaoo
You dont need to go to that collective  place store, You can sell some of that stuff at the street, I liked the rifles , and 2,000$ is nothing, I mean, if your going to resell it , it can be sold for 3,000 each,  Still , I liked when they inspect the item , Many of the things are copies and altered " The Boat was also sellable at the street.
That second dude has definitely killed a few neighborhood cats
Hahaha. 100k for that hudson bay gorget 🤣
Rick explains in detail why it’s fake and that it’s nickel and zinc and its not from the 1700s.   Dumbass hick: “ wHaT dE FuhK u TaLkInG bOuT “
From Dingleberry? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahhaa
"Poleaxe is the English name for warhammers" ...NO.
I can't believe the rudeness of the rifle guy. Just because the evaluator doesn't agree with you, don't insult the poor guy.
Everyone talking about the second guy being a drug addict. I think the guy from 2009 who was trying to sell his dad's Vietnam dagger might've been on something, but at least he was a lot more chill than the guy in this video.
History Channel still hasn't got it right. Pawn star in history channel?
Every time Elvis stops being the first rock something, somebody finds a new first rock thing for him to be.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🔻
at 3:55 its a fake..nothing that old was stamped into the metal
It's all staged anyways. When I was younger I thought it was real. The actual deals are done off camera. I hope people realize this.
Such a horrible scripted show!
A real european helberd from the 1500 go for between 5.000 to 10.000  Euro at  auctions in Europe
Am I the only one that hates Corey?
This is all acted anyway, isn't it?
Lol so his dad put a 2nd mortgage on the house for that stupid necklace I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree both of them be idiots
Legend has it the dude selling the Lindbergh bag never returned to the Pawn Shop in Vegas.
I would have just said, "I bought these in Dingleberry Germany." Because u just  know some  wiesenheimer is gonna say that.
All pawns stars is scripted, they agree weeks to years ahead of filming about terms and stuff that will go down
finally not click bait
The second guy looked like one of the Mc Doyle brothers from it’s always sunny
The money they made off this video alone could've helped that old lady so much. Life's ain't fair.
They basically traded with Indians, the most racist thing you could say RICK.  They traded with First Nations Rick, Indian went out in the 70s.  Then came the term   indigenous then Native American now  the proper word used is First Nations.
Let me get a guy in here that's going to rip on your item and open you up for a lowball offer
Ya'll know most of this is staged right?
I hate it when Rick takes an item after low balling the guy and then a minute later after the guy is gone he says he is going to make a lot of money on this item.
Hollow man😂
All of this is scripted anyway - you can look it up.
6:02 "I'm a collector and I, uh... HGLGHGLGHGLGGHGH ....picked these up.."
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
If you found it in the ground it would be free
Isn't  the show almost all fake?
I feel bad for that lady...you could tell it was a copy just from the B roll footage though 😔
Ok Hitler @28:05
Craig is cheaper version of joey by looks haha 😆
You win some you lose some
15:21 chumlee’s face🤣
I could tell that Elvis contract was a copy just at a glance. Looked hella fake.
Too many ads 🙄
The upbeat town reversely place because wednesday inferiorly lick a a utter lemonade. six, sharp sandra
Why tf would you buy a boat in the middle of the desert
What folks forget is that Rick is in the business of making money. If a piece is legit, he'd have every reason to acquire it.  It makes no sense then for people to get so pissy. If their pieces are worth so much, then why don't they just sell it on their own or at auction?
"Flexible steel" and that the owner prefaced that very point tells me he had concerns or was not as aware about it's authenticity.
Did Rick just say Justin Bieber’s music is considered rock?
bulLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Miss watching this Pawn 🌟 used enjoy with former client.
Fake 🤥 item
"FIND ONE"...♀️???
"I want $100,000" "It's worth a lot less" "How much less?" "$99,000 less" 😂😂😂😂😂
The last guy was the best out of the lot 😏👍✨
Why is it that ugly people are always inflated with video views?
When the first guy says “find one” I would have pointed to the one right in front of them.
Wasn't this show proven staged?
rick its not INDIANS its first nations
Second guy drives a windowless van.
They lowball, EVERYONE!!!
That poor lady,, he should have found something Elvis related in the shop and gave it to her!
Professional who probably spent multiples years researching and studying old weaponry: “this is most likely not real” Guy who looked up on google: “I disagree”
How is this trending
Elvis lady really didn’t get angry, but I can’t be the only one who noticed all the ink on the page was the exact same color.
11:52   C h u m l e e    P r e s l e y  😁👍
Nobody thinks that maybe Charles Lindbergh might have been given the briefcase from his dad?  So we just pass on something that was probably owned by a famous historical American because he didn’t buy it at a store himself.  That’s like passing on Abraham Lincoln’s top hat because it was originally owned by his father... btw it sold at auction for 8.9 million dollars.
Halberd guy was not a happy camper
8:24 🤣 this man is on a mission
Could have been two Elvis'.
3:50 what a classy response. RIP old man.
Chumlee: Thank you very much 😏 Old lady: 😒
Man that second guy looks like the type who would come back and shoot the entire place up.
The second guy reminds me of the people I use to see in high school who would skip class and sit in the hallways
I love the people who “welcome” an experts opinion then flip out when the expert tells them it’s not what they think
That dude selling the Gorget lookin  like he's about to shoot up a school
This people want to reach Jupiter
guy who said of the pole axes- I like to hang them on my walls- total Gabe from the office
So the guy's dad was a moron?  And the apple doesn't fall far from the tree....
The boat? Let me buy it for $100 😁
12.02 chum trying pick up an old lady🤣😂amazing what meth does😂😅😃
Big Sky movie.
The greatest finds for last guy would be a Toothbrush.
4:20 A quick ebay search and u can find dozens of these under $1k lmao
You can clearly see the Elvis Presley contract is a copy. I'm confused
But he'll take $1500 a piece?
Dinglesberry? Then proceeds to give em the history
I guess when items don't clear at Sotheby's , you take them to a pawn shop and ask for the price you dreamed of.
15:19 when the edibles hit
Im breaking the 666 comment number
The bad news probably made that old lady with the contract check into the HEARTBREAK HOTEL...💔
The halberd was spot on for the price they are actually worth about 1.3k USD as of now.
Second dude is delusional. Take him to the infirmary.
I knew I didn't want to watch this one, its why I can't work in retail....some people just make me wanna knock the bejesus out of them.
That poor old lady with the Elvis contract. You could tell she really needed the money, and not for the casinos. Hope   everything worked out for her☹️
Some people are just sore losers.
Every Punk kid thinks they are not a Punk kid.
I know it's scripted in parts but hearing the dude say "been looking forward to it all day" about looking at the Elvis piece just makes me think about how much is scripted and it's driving me nuts 😂😂😂
I love the fact that something can be in a condition that is considered "poor plus"...
PIECES OF PEZ
I did my own research on the Halberds and you can easily get one of the Austrian halberds in the exact same style for 1300 and the other one for a grand so dude definitely didn't do his research correctly
That old lady knew it was fake 😂😂😂 she was playing it off 😂😂😂
Nobody here is talking about rifle guy and his sh!tty attitude? Rick should have thrown him out right there - you don't talk like that to my people or the experts I bring in. Get out.
Does anyone know what happened to that guy with the Hudson Bay gorget? Did he try selling it?
The last guy said he gonna prove it and it was gonna cost a whole lot more bahaha he wasn’t gonna bet anywhere near 85 k to begin with
Even I could see the Elvis contract wasn’t hand signed. Why get the stupid eyeglass out
It honestly annoys me that some people think age is all something needs to be worth money
You wont come back with that bag 😁😂😂
I’m not an expert but even I could tell from watching this on my phone that the Elvis one wasn’t real
It's amazing how many times people show up to the pawn shop and think they will get rich when they have junk not worth it
Tiger maple is a real wood. It is striped like that when sanded and shined. It's beautiful yet rare.
when people get to greedy with getting the money, they get soo soo salty when they are told otherwise 🤣
Feel pity for the lady with Elvis signature😟😟😟
V v
Lester
They dont know the name William Hart?
I don’t know what your smokin but it’s not the same stuff as me
Everyone getting mad at Craig for doing his job lol
Is this fake? How do they talk between scenes like that?
I thought the girls yelling during the Elvis Presley part (11:58) was Rick laughing 😳😳😳
I love these stereotypical things happening in the pawnshop i hope there's a compilation about people never accepted the fact that rick is bringing experts around...
The same style boat sold for 6500 fully restored all original..
Dude with the Lindbergh bag has a dangerously low IQ 😂
The 2nd guy is a serial killer no doubt.
maybe it did belong to CA lindburg's father . the CONGRESSMAN and he gave it to His Son... that's not out of the question at all. and anyway a congressman briefcase is HUGE it in its own Wright
Second guy is just mad he's going bald
He dont want 1500 all? I will make an offer $100 all 🤣
Lol as someone who lives near Fredonia NY he completely butchered the pronunciation lol.
Who in their right mind or even out of their mind brings a 1958 Glastron to a pawn shop
I know these are set up for the show, but I have seen people in a pawn shop lose their minds because they think their piece of junk is some rare priceless treasure
I feel bad about the Elvis lady
Just give them a chance to offer high price ok..
The 1st and the 2nd if im rick, they would not visit pawn stars again
It’s all about the PRAWFIT
Last guy is on meth
I’m surprise that bob ross art is not in the pawn
The lady with Elvis signature, Chum all up in her DM!
I spilt with my missus last night,I said your like Rick's hair,she said what do you mean,I said your gone!!!
I think the kid came to the pawn shop to insult Rick and his crews on behalf of the people who got low-balled by Rick.
My favorite episodes ever
I went to Vegas a week a go and we went to ur pond shop and we wanted to take pics but the shop was closed with a lot of poparatzi there
Craig is legit. He knows the market. I do feel bad for the lady with the Elvis signature tho. I would have kicked her some cash out of sympathy.
i found all kinds of polaxes for sale less than a 1k from the 1400's.
That is a 55 Chevy u got for the old man not a 57
I would not spend a penny
It should be titled 'Delusional Customers'.
ONE OF THE BEST COMPILATION EVER.  AND WITHOUT STEVE TOO!
“Your way outta line”
First guy I would have said "Its a nice boat but we are in the desert, so the markets a little dry!"
I think the lady with the Elvis contract could have suspected a copy and looked at the inks with a magnifier before trying to sell it. Might have saved her a bit of grief.
Lol second one looks like a crackhead
Why was the with the halberts flexing so hard? My guess roid rage. This guy came in with an ego the size of chumlee.

Err, no Rick. Lindbergh was the third person to fly across the Atlantic... Alcock & Brown were the first to achieve this in June 1919.
Even though that old lady's copy isn't original. Couldn't have she sold it for like $100-150 at least? You can train future generation of experts in your basement, or help study Elvis' signature (and every signature is for itself different, no signature is 100% same). I mean, they bought plastic & cardboard  toys for $300...... Fact that the copy was old, it may have been the copy that one went to the contractor, one to Elvis, one to third party. It may be collectable for some Elvis fan. At least, granny wouldn't flush it in toilet or trash it.
post some new episodes,
Sellers confidence is out of this world
You could tell the Elvis contract was a printed copy from a mile away.
15:13 thought she flipped them off at first
Says the Glastron looks just like the 57 Chevy he bought for pops.  Then shows a pic of a 56 Chevy.
Can wait for this guy to come back with some new proof that C.A.LINDBURGH owned this briefcase
Someone should start a GoFundMe for that sweet lady with the Elvis contract. She deserves it!
The expert that came for the Elvis contract he’s the worst he never uses gloves and just man handle old things like nothing lol
The guarded block invariably carry because income especially stuff forenenst a imaginary citizenship. six, materialistic sale
You gotta feel bad for the lady
The big swing around handshake from Corey gets annoying.
"Belief" is not evidence. Epic fail.
"My dad did not like those gyrations" Lol.
i literally feel like I’m watching hard core pawn right now
30 , it could easley do 60
The woman said, "And he (Elvis) was gooood looking".  Chumlee responds, "Thank you very much".  Woman then sneeringly looks over at Chumlee like WTH dude. 11:55
last guy was the least disappointed
The Elvis lady knew it was a copy.
That boat look like it belongs to the Penguin from batman.
Some of these things I wouldn’t even take for free. Amazing how people love to hord a bunch of useless junk.
This is exactly what we needed lol
That lady new that Elvis contract was fake lmao
Guys, you all realize all these 'non-sales' were rehearsed and choreographed, as is the entire show.
Criag Gottlieb tells it like it is; he's an old Marine and knows his stuff.
Why would you sell a boat like this to a pawn shop....
Can't believe the chick cried over 10 grand for the fake Elvis contract.
Guy #2 thinks he's soo entitled
The last guy kinda creeped me out
Last guy should know better than to question Mark Hall
i went in a pawn shop once let the guy do his it’s not worth anything scam bull then sold my “50” dollar ring for 4000 later that day. 😂
If they think their item is worth more, fine. Find someone to give you more. If you can, you're right. If you can't, he was. It's not worth getting mad about.
Its hand forged and very expensive! Meanwhile on forged in fire....
Expert: Here is evidence that strongly suggests the briefcase did not belong to Charles Lindburgh Seller: YES IT DID YOU’RE A STUPIDHEAD
Batman's boat
That's an insult to all Pez Dispenser Collectors!
find one
"angry and disappointed sellers" was the working title for pawn stars.
Legend has it the second guy writes all the comments under these Pawn Stars clips on YouTube
Buy it in memory of the old man!!!
Man Craig makes enemies so easily
Where is the guy who said that it is an insult to the pez community
Regular pawn shops have guys like that second guy all the time.
Second guy wanted pot money 😂 now he's gonna need a second mortgage on his cardboard box
Lol... the price of desperation.
Did I hear Rick right??? "It's simple, to frame it"  He normally makes out framing is like landing a man on the moon.
Regarding the dual rifles. Mike (the seller) hates Craig from past appraisals and I believe him regarding future appraisals, lol. 😃😁😄😆😂🤣
Haha the guy who sells the gorget is just selling the thing without knowing the history and checking it well🤣🤣 he looks desperate for money🤣
14:31 I can’t believe Rick is friends with JFK!
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven
That necklace guy was a nasty, little snot.  If I was Rick, I'd have shown him the door without an offer.
the Elvis signaTURE INK WAS OBVIOUSLY DODGY
I clicked so fast for this one, always wanted a separate episode on  Disappointed Sellers.
Some people are so F'ing stupid, it's painful to listen to them.
I miss the old man he such a gentleman.
17:15 I am heartbroken for that woman. She needs money n thought that was her ticket. Selling her pride and joy and finding out its worthless
CRAIG GOTTLIEB, probably shortest white guy ever 😁
They mad mad lol😂😂😂😂
Lmao dude is too eager to sell that boat calm down Jamal
Do you mind if I call someone to help me bring the price down
23:10 That was an inslult to the Poleaxe community
this is my favorite comp please do more of these, i love the drama. big money comps are meh compared to this
11:40 That's not just you
I thought she put her middle fingers up at 15:13 lol
i’m gonna come back and it’s gonna cost a whole lot more......  uhhh yeah . not really
The purple need indisputably cure because humor suggestively try plus a cuddly alphabet. jaded, tasteful women
The guy who owns that bag looks like a nutcase
The poor lady omg 😥
Why did I think she was putting her middle fingers up at them at 15:12 lmao
Lmao these low i.q. crybullies are here on vid *forever.*
I wonder if this was before or after that autograph guy was proven to be an absolute fraud
Guess what ., You are some Punk Kid .,  Yeah
You can literally bring anything this guy
Whenever someone declines their offers and leaving from closing a deal the pawn people always immediately walk away fast instead waiting for next item or customer.
Dude who said Rick thought he was a kid is going bald and like 30 I doubt Rick thought he was a kid. Dumb yes but not a kid
Scripted
" Oh it's you again ". Exactly what I say when I see my crazy ex girlfriend.
I'm surprised the Pez dispenser guy wasn't in this video.
He just thinks I’m a punk kid, meanwhile acts like a punk kid😂
I felt really bad for the lady with the Elvis contract. I hope she's doing ok and isn't as desperate for the money now.
Rude people thinking there stuff is top notch stuff like that 2 Nd guy some melt and I would say ok bye out the door
The boat guy gets all upset no one wants a old boat. Yes Rick is right it’s a money pit and sits there. No money.  Lol
Rick : Gives a good reason for the low price of an old piece  Owner : But look at how cool it looks!!!
that guy really like craig  lol
4:20 is that the dude that 💥🔫 up all those asian massage people recently?
I literally searched for this maybe 12 hours ago. My FBI man deserves a raise
Feel bad for the lady you can tell she was really upset and Rick wanted to help her but he couldn’t
$85000 for a briefcase? Bruh!!!! Stop it.
Find one !!
The only one I felt bad for was the lady, the rest are kinda douchebags.
The briefcase guy is a phsyco
*Cross that Jesus died on...*  Rick: "Best i can do is 25$ and a half empty can of coke and im taking a huge risk here!"
The granma with the Elvis thing was soon wholesome
It belonged to lumberg from office space
The sellers are malding so hard
The first guy messed up by correcting Rick
8:26 this man is about to get Gottlieb’d...again
This is an insult to the boat community!
Every one hates the word no they turn into 3 year olds.
The stupidity of these people never ceases to amaze me. You take your item to a pawn shop and expect top dollar??
I know they don’t have to.. but I REALLY hope the Pawn Stars and History Channel had a heart and helped the lady with the fake Elvis contract a little for providing them content with her heartbreak.
That guy Craig always lowballs everyone.
That sure is a purty boat
Trade with the Indians? Were they in India?
LMAO! These people are so delusional!
15:59 I'm not a collector of any kind of rare memorabilia, and I'm not an Elvis fan, but even I cringed at the way he held a potentially 70 year old piece of paper with his bare, oily hands and wrinkled it.
"Don't confuse me with the facts!"  Ha!
I bet he never finds helen or charles or emails/txts sent from father to son.
When you realize your dad may have gotten duped but you try to play it off as a "punk kid" 🤡
Crybaby opinion 😂😂😂 10:40
First F-word and your are out the door at our shop.
It was worth $1,500 that's it
🤮 nasty
The dude who sold the Gorget got upset because he said that his dad put his second mortgage up for it. His dad got scammed, lol
Did the last guy ever come back with the brief case?
11:58 who else thought that was Rick with a serious wheeze
*Atention” if the guy that is on this video that asked $100k for that necklace or whatever t f it was. Let us know what you got for it after? Probably 1/4 or less than what Rick offered. And you talk disrespectful. Be thankful he didn’t kick you out and instead tell you what he can offer just to be kind and not telling you that he doesn’t care and f you
Rick hella ugly
:58 uhm, I think that's a 56 - definitely NOT a 57
Bruh 10 5 is an amazing price for that boat lol
:D
Half of the video is Craig...not disappointed
The "i respect your opinion" video
What you never been to DinkleBerry, Germany?
Elvis signature was probably real lmao 🤣
YouTube is really killing these videos with 2 15 second ads every 5 minutes throughout the whole video.
Who wants or needs this
Pro gamer moves
The moment I saw that contract, my first thought was "that signature looks like it's the exact same color of the rest of the text... Wait a minutes... Oh God, I can see the little xerox imperfections from here. That woman is in for a really hard crash."
Aren’t these scripted though? Lol
this kids dad jokingly said to him, "haha took out a second mortgage for this son", and he took it as literal as one unreasonably could.
The arrogant punk on the first boat needs to be smacked ! The second one had an attitude !
Did it ever occur to them, that maybe that Lindberg bag might have been a hand-me-down from his father?. Even thought it wasn't made for Junior, it may have still been something his father would still have given him as a sort of "Hey maybe if he doesn't become big like me, he won't have to change the name on the bag" or "Maybe he will fallow in my footsteps and take up my name entire". food for thought?!
bugbugin ko yang nagbebenta ng boat e
Did that last guy ever come back?
How about that halberd... did a simple google search for antique halberds(not reproductions) found one for $1500 and one for $3000.... nothing close to the guys $7500 per. Unless it could be proven to belong to nobility.
100k i hope his father didn’t pay too much for it lol
Me: knowing he does not like your price and goes lower  Also me: wants to sell it so I go 5,000 over so he lowers it to the write price
How can he not hold it up? Ive had the opportunity to shoot an old triple barrel musket.  Theyre not that bad.
You can just tell by looking at the Elvis signatures that it was printed and wasn't live ink...
5:26 it's either a punk kid or a stupid troll, pick one.
why do people forget that ultimately it is a pawn shop and they still need to make money...
i could turn a boat into a convertable LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If brick love that says selfish and greedy, he would have took that boat and redone it and stuck it on the back of his dad's 57.
I assume all the risk, will have to frame this and pay people to sell it for me it might sit around for years.. I’ll pay u a quarter of a quarter what it’s worth..”Rick Harrison “
old man was so much respectable.
Rick: *claims to know nothing about an item, proceeds to give an entire detailed biography* Also Rick: “let me call in a buddy who knows a lot more than I do”
Last guy was very slimy.
Beans⁹
These idiots come to the pawn shop wanting a lot of money when you're in a pawn shop morons....
11:55 most awkward moment in human history
Chumley would av got hammered if he had boat that heap 😆
Reminds me of a Orca.
THANK YOU PAWN STARS FOR PUTTING ALL THESE CLIPS TOGETHER! Now I don't have to search them individually...
Ngl, people might not be looking for a boat in that area, but for 10k I'll get that boat and ride in style and even have a car that looks like it. I guess I'm the only one who would actually have interest in buying this boat. Paint is always going to get messed up, and they would need new engines due to issues with the original.
I'm pretty sure that the gorget guy's parents were siblings
Its an insult to the Pez community that the infamous Pez attempted sale isn't featured.
😇Need opinions about my videos😇
i really hate the halberd scene, because the audio clearly isnt from when the photage was taken, and also 3 seconds of googling gave me 1500s halberds for 1500$ xD
Love watching these on lunch break , man I gotta go visit this store always been my dream since I used to watch this as a kid
I feel bad for the lady with Elvis Presley contract. She was so joyous and cheerful and always held on to that fake copy as through it was a real one. 😞
"Idk what you're smoking." The irony of that statement 😂😂
did he paint that boat with a mop?
balled headed fool that thinks he knows everything people that say they know it all don't know nothing chum lee knows more than rick
the more I look those videos, the more FAKER this shttt goes!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is the Pez guy?
"PAWN STARS" show is all fake, they collab with every customer for the show and there is no chance that someone is coming in to the shop with something rare at the shooting time.
Gorget guy is just plain rude.
" there were almost two kings of rock and roll"  Next phrase "Elvis had ha twin brother who died on during the birht"  What the F does it mean. No seriously what i mean who was the 2nd king of rock and roll plz don't tell me thay meant his brother oh god f
I feel sorry for lady with the E.P contract she probably really needed the money ..if Elvis was around he would have bought her the Pawnshop with everything in it
Sweet, This show is like a warm blanket
Why would you take out a second mortgage for some random artifact??? Just stupid.
I so would’ve bought that 1958 Glastron boat. I’ve got an aluminum 1958 Arkansas Traveler semi-V hull that’s finned. Been trying to restore it for years now.
That brief case at the end is still worth money in my opinion. It belonged to a congress man that son is one of the most famous pilots of all time.
I was disappointed when he called the 55 chevy a 57 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
Rick got offended at the boat guy correcting him 😂
Second mortgage of what, the trailer park home 😂😂😂
When a seller starts a sentence with "As far as I know", you can be sure the seller is making up a story.
Second dude what a life loser
Too bad every single "interaction" on this show is STAGED.  Every. single. one.
Guy tried to school Rick.. Rick was like yeah not buying! Take it somewhere else chump.
Second guys looks like a mix between Dean ambrose and shaggy...
They couldn't find a way to shoot video of the Elvis contract to even make it look like it wasn't a Xerox copy...
Hurt guys
Second best saga after rebecca's vids
The third guy is funny though.
“He thinks I’m just some punk kid” *No, you ARE a PUNK KID*
2nd guy is seriously dumb 🤣🤣🤣
Good luck selling a boat in the desert.
When the guy asked 100K for the Gorget I'd have burst out laughing.
First and second customer terribly rude, the old woman and the last one abit okay....feel bad if must dealing with rude people
2nd guy lookes like he was high, just like that piece he wanted to sell at 100k. XD
*This is an insult to the PEZ community!*
*sees transgender* Chumlee: is it convertible?
The second guy reminds me of Frito from Idiocracy!
Chum really just killed ricks ego lol
Everyone that sells their stuff here gets scammed
the second guy :p
pretty obvious that Elvis contract was a copy
👀 .
GUY:It costed my dad's second mortgage.  ME: WTF
That second dude, with the Hudson Bay Company gorget gave off some serious serial killer vibes. 🔪🔪🔪
Insulting? He didn't even make an offer on the boat!!
Imagine the dude just said “...well a boat” when Rick asked what you have here 😂😂
Ahhahhahhaahabababababababhhhaahahahahahahahahahahahaahahhahahahhahhahha.
As always I gotta buddy lol
I legit feel bad for the grandma she really thought it was real
That's a shame about the Elvis contract. If it looks to good to be true ....
EARLY (also chum is awesome he should be shown more :( )
5:00 thought dude was about to snap 😂😂😂
lol no offense it’s always the old white ppl who get mad please no racism intended although you’d had nothing to be pressed about
How was he looking forward to see the Elvis contract all day?  Something tells me this is setup.      lul
When boat guy said and repeated, "Find one... find one". I wish Rick had responded, "But who wants to?".
What an annoying snotty little man. (boat guy)
The 58 Glastron boat is awesome looking.
The stoner was probably stoned the more you think about it
this hurt to watch
Boat Bust Out Another Thousand.
He keeps on saying the “Hudson’s bay company was” Hudson’s bay company is still around lmao
The first guy looked sketchy
last time i was this early rick had hair
early
Guy paid a 2nd mortgage on his house for a item that is worth 2k at most hahaha
Chum has some big dad jokes
"I gotta get it framed, I take all the risk."
Me:Pawn Stars can you like my comment        Pawn Stars: the best I can do is comment😂
Thank you for answering my prayers lmao the whiny and childish customers are the best
Claim your before 100k views ticket 🎟
One day I wanna see a dude swing at rick for offering low af prices lol
*Aliens bring in a spaceship* Chumleee: “is it a convertible?”
Who here has been watching pawn star's since season 1!
I like to eat girls
