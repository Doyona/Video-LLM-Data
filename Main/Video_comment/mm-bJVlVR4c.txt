But idiots rate maguire cause he had a half decent game against Ukraine
Super volley 🔥
Surprised Bruno's back isn't broken with how much he carries Man Utd!
United would be 12th without var and varnandes
I thought Bruno was the guy to set up the rest starting to look like we need a ozil like character to assist Bruno n Cavani now 😂who would u pick to play behind them in all honesty I’d take Jonjo Shelvey
Up the Albion
I don’t care what anyone says how was West Brom’s goal not a foul? He had his hands all over lindelofs face?
OLE FFS. MAGUIRE AND LINDELOF ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!! What does he not realise???
Stunner, didnt anyone see firmino/salahs goal. Or was that because the other team were playing bad. City fan btw.
Man U are terrible for a team at the top end of the league however how was West Brom’s goal not a foul? Isn’t that what VAR is for?
Bruno with the flukiest goal of the season😂😂 Not bad though
Spelt shinner wrong
Penandez? Shinandez?
That was a shin volley if ever I saw one
This is uniteds best chance in winning the prem and they still managed to bottle it. They're becoming smaller and smaller as times goes on.
As soon as van de beek came on for Fred and greenwood for martial we played better play donny man
Draw against West brom. Utd are garbage
Thought Man U was winning the league oh well maybe next year
Go on slab head
West Brom goal was a clear foul, but united were shocking all night as well tbf
Man Utd don't score enough goals to win a Premier League season. They need to consistently score 2,3 or 4 but instead it's usually just the one.
United's dip in form has coincided with Ole dropping Bailly. Don't get the obsession with Victor Lindesoft.
Man United gunna finish 6th. Mark my words.
Manchester still red ... for Salford
Might as well have a blind person in net instead of de gea
Man Utd are still a big team.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a Fantastic goal from Bruno ! completely!
To all the United fans thinking that it was unfair that you guys got knocked out of the champions league this is evidence enough that you just didn't have the metal to be a part of the champions league
Big point for West brom
80 million 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Harry Maguire is genuinely diabolical.. This isn’t a dip in form, he’s been awful for three seasons now.
Bailly has 2 top class performances? Hmm better drop him for lindelof, the Swedish Phil Jones
How wasn’t that a pen?
Ole at the wheel
United were robbed of our penalty!!!  We should of score more where as that shouldn’t have mattered!!! Come on United get it together ffs this is ridiculous!!! 😈s 🔥 🙌🏽💞💯
Maguire diving was hilarious 😂
Dat should  be a pelted
What the hell is with this title. It was an EQUALISER.
No bruno no top 4
Good seeing Maitland niles start
I’m sorry that first goal should have not been given the striker has his hand in Lindelofs face
Ay! That lad’s got Sadio’s trim!
Shaw n Bruno
Wow, the West Brom keeper and defender paired well in that double save 😲Poor De Gea, what a contrast 😬😂
United would be better off with cheech and Chong in defence
bruno is ugly af
00:23 Pro tip for the Premier league, put your hand on the defender's face to score a goal, you won't be penalised... Not a ManU fan but if that's the other way around the striker goes down and it's a peno any day...
De Gea always makes us draw or lose it’s so annoying we need a new goalkeeper
Fair play at first but then Lindolof  and  Maguire blocked Dea  Gea
1 man team need I say more
Maguire/Lindelof partnership. 2 Holding midfielders against the worst team in the premier league. Rashford forced on the right where he's useless to make way for Martial who's been useless. How long will Ole continue to stick by these awful decisions.
I’ve never known a centre half to dive as much as Harry Maguire
These headlines/titles are so boring. Such a United bias
All these games with VAR with silly decisions being made and about 95% of things being checked by VAR and some how West Brom’s goal wasn’t checked for a foul 😂
Great game of football
Glad to know you can now grab defenders by the face and it's not a foul. VAR is literally deciding the league at this point.
Without Fernandes United are a mid table team at best
Foul
Westbrom nearly always draw with top 6
Imagine the club without bruno
Bruno is the next giggsy
‘Pen merchant’ lol
Harry and victor are literally terrible defenders who just get bullied
Don’t get me wrong I think Fernandes is a brilliant player but i swear he never gets marked😂 my point is if that is kdb , muller , firmino etc there is guaranteed every man around them lol
Man U are so bad but Fernandes is on another level he will be gone in the summer
Diagne is world class 🇸🇳🔥💪
Leaky goals De Gea letting goals in as normal, martial not scoring as usual. They should swap positions..
That’s about the first time a referee has used the monitor to overturn a clear dive. Hopefully there will be more to come.
Don’t worry Man U beating big Sam isn’t for every championship manager
Penchester utd ,didn't get a penalty!
Unlucky west Brom.  They deserved to win . Man United was not good enough today but what a goal from Bruno!
Man united sometimes are good and sometimes are carried by rashford and fernandes. I wonder if anyone could guess what this one was. Neither. Carried by Fernandes
Trust De Gea, Lindelof, Maguire, Fred, Greenwood & Martial To Mess Things Up Again!😒  Kick Them All Out Before Manchester United Go Through Another Season Of Embarrassment!😡
0:21 Lindelöf would have got that if his head didn't get pushed down.....
How is that not a foul on Lindelof for the first goal? If it had been the other way round it would have been a penalty!
Man UTD are mid table without Bruno. Their CBs are terrible.
Shaw is the most underestimated player in the prem
Diving maguire
Can't beat Westbrom and definitely won't finish second. Need at least 5 new players to compete next season.
MARCUS RASHFORD IS THE WORST PLAYER IN A UTD KIT, THA GUY IS LUCKY HE FEEDS CHILDREN BECAUSE HE AINT ON THAT PITCH FOR HIS TALENT , HE HAS NONE HE JUST FEEDS KIDS SO HE GETS A FREE PLACE EVERYWEEK , UTD ARE DOOMED
Our captain should be ashamed about his comments after the game....blaming VAR instead of his and lindelofs consistently terrible defending!!! Get Robson, Keane and vidic in a room with him and let them teach him how to be a united captain.
Diagne should have 90 strength in FIFA lol
Utd were lucky
Linderlof and Maguire has to end
After that performance I really hope that they can beat the drop and stay in the Premier league - and West brom too 😀
Mguire didn't go down like that in that punch up in Greece.  Cheeting nob
Maguire diving, typical United cheats, glad it got overturned
As a goalkeeper myself I can safely say that Johnstones save was impeccable
they rely on maguire way to much
Maguire runs them onside then waved his hands screaming offside. Also that was a worst dive than salah last weekend
oles fuking clueless
Tell you what Maguire yr an absolute disgrace trying to con the ref...you shud b out on the streets pick pocketing for a living cos that's all your doing at old Trafford...
As much as I would hate to see united win the league I dont think i can take another 3 years of those oil hungry tossers get praise for having the biggest purse and filling the bench and first team with a billion euro each. Teams like the liverpool team of 19/20 are extraordinary but they're rare. It'll be a long time again before any team in that league can beat the power of money fraudster and his saudi pals possess
Wasn’t all that
stone wall penalty  thats crazy   why have var when u make the wrong decision
Bottled it utd🤣
What a goal from Bruno and a great save by de gea but the centre backs are really letting us down we need to see more of Tuanzebe and every time we don’t play Bailey we miss him
As usual, man utd diving to get a pen
1.foul on victor 2. the ref called the whistle when we are attacking
Pep: It was the West Brom draw that started our unbelievable run. Ole: 🤔 💡
Imo it doesn't matter about Maguires price tag at this point, he's had time to prove his worth and he hasn't and that's the bottom line, time to look for a partner for Bailly as long as he can stay fit. Bailly is the 2nd or 3rd best cb in the league when he's fit after Van Dijk and Dias.
Maguire flopping like a forward, needs to show more strength. Hes playing like a wimp.
Is face grabbing allowed now ????
What are man united going to do if he gets injured 😂😭
How is that not a foul
Man United will win the World Cup and Arsenal will win Euro 2022
United won't win the league with a scared GK in De Gea, They won't win the league with no commanding CB, Lindelof isn't good enough, Maguire can only bring the ball out from the back, and win headers other than that he sits to deep and is to slow, Fred always gets the ball on the edge of the box and can't score a goal or set up a goal, offers nothing except closing people down, Martail, Rashford go missing alot and never get subbed off because there's no competition for places, Cavani can't get a cross to him with them 2 out of the wings, Greenwood aswell  No need for De Gea at United anymore we have a younger better one and a good back up, Is there any CB leaders out there these days? we need a CM who can break up play and pass and score a goal and get rid of Fred Pogba is leaving in the summer I think Jack Grealish should be bought and played LM and we get rid of Martail    Greenwood is very young and needs to improve, but doesn't get a look in at CF  buying all these young players who are inconsistent and lack leadership isnt going to win us a title soon, we need proven quality like Bruno, Cavani,
United are a small team we'll never win the league again
Maguire is not captain material, too soft
Imagine if West Brom had a clinical striker, then it would be game over... Maguire needs to go
11 points dropped now. Joke tactics by Ole...
That was a clear foul from yadna he elbowed lindelof in the head clear free kick
Fernandes is gold! Underrated I think!
United have got the same amount of points in their last 5 games as Liverpool 🤭
How was the first West Brom goal not a foul
Cheating United finally not getting the rub of the green from the refs you love to see it😉
The manager and captain complaining about decisions going against them just shows what a joke Utd are.For years every team that has played in The Premier League has had to put up with absolutely loads of dodgy decisions going Utd's way especially at Old Trafford or The Theater of Dodgy Decisions.They are the only reason why Utd are in 2nd and why they got into this season's Champions League.
Unfortunately denied another win today due to poor refereeing decision. Maguire and lidelof clearly fouled. If you think otherwise, imagine if it was your team.
Looool maguire at 2:50 come like randy orton getting ready to deliver a rko
Dont think west broms goal should have counted he had his hands on his face
Maguire going down like had just been shot hahaha
Banger from Fernandes
Lord Lingardino leaving was the biggest departure since CR7 leaving Real Madrid
No way that’s a goal by  Grady Diangana he had his hands all Lindelöf even his face and watching MOTD2  Ian weight talks total crap if that was a arsenal player he be creaming no goal, bad refereeing.
Since when did Mane sign for West Brom 🤣
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You can tell.......☺️ Lindeloff was so determined to clear his lines??? What a PLONKER.
SOLSKJAER IS A TOTAL PRAT 👈
Diagne fouled Lindelof on the Bromwich goal, think about it this way if Lindelof would have done that to any West Brom player in the box it would have been a penalty so why should that goal stand?!?
Maguire the goat🐐🥶
Lindelof is not a United player. Vidic would literally die to head that ball away.
West brom needed Charlie Austin here
defensive is very bad for Manchester United
You've spelt shinner wrong in the title.
Luke Shaw whipping the most incredible balls in from the left.
Clearly man United are just happy to get top 4
Lindelof was clearly fouled at the beginning
Oh look west brom lost ball in the middle of the pitch and they only have 4 defenders left. Let’s pass the ball back to Fred who will then pass it to maguire and then to lindelof and now west brom has 10 players in the box after letting lindelof and maguire drag the Ball for 30 seconds 🤦🏾
Oooooo bruno
Please no hate on reply I am not here to start a fight I am simply stating something i think is fact: I find it a bit annoying how a lot (I mean a lot) of VAR decisions have gone Man Utd’s way this season and after it didn’t help them today then people complain like it’s the worst. Post-match Harry Maguire said he was furious after not being given a penalty. With the luck they have had with VAR they should count themselves lucky. At the same time VAR refs make mistakes and it is not VAR but the people who use it. It seems people on VAR forget it’s suppose to be used for Check not Correct. It feels like whenever something goes to VAR the people on VAR simply just agree as if they only care about the pay check. So to sum it up Man Utd shouldn’t complain after so much VAR luck and they do need to change VAR as well. Thank you for reading.
This headline in fairness should read: West Brom unlucky to not beat Man United.
People keep saying Bruno isn’t that good but he keeps on proving them haters wrong can’t wait for more
I mean it was still a draw against a bottom team so it’s very bad for united
So all sky sports do is fantasise over Bruno Fernandes he’s not even that good
Who remembers that time when Manchester United fans thought they were gonna win the league
0:43 rashford when bruno gets a new cut
How are United fans complaining about the Diagne's goal when they've had _countless_ controversial decisions go their way...
We should focus on winning games not the title race
Anyone else notice Bruno mis-hit his shot for the goal.  Yeah nice goal and all, but it was fairly jammy considering he didn’t even kick it he shinned it
Jesus is coming soon He loves u and died for u pls turn to Him
I am not sure why are the people  sayng man u have a bad deffence . After all they re deffence helped 19 teams this year. All the teams in the premier league exepting one which is man u. And now i saw a footage of de gea wearing a mask, and i don't get it ,he did not catch anything recently.
One man team
Once again our centre backs ruin it for us
rashford would be the top scorer in city’s team this season. Gundogan is city’s top scorer with 16 rashford has 16. He would be second top scorer in Liverpool team only behind salah. Put some respect on his name.
This league has 🤡 Referees
I felt that even though Lindelof was weak i still thinknhe got fouled.
Why lazylof and Maguire play for this biggest club???
Nearly 10 years now since they last won it.. Hardly beat their record of41 will they?  480m   in debt... Ooooooh
Title is over utd are not consistent enough  man city will run away with it at present no team good enough to stop them. Best team by far
Why doesnt he play maguire cdm or even cm because centre back not workin for im ee looks more dangerous up the pitch 🤔
Every game Maguire makes a mistake that leads to conceding a goal, or at least to an extremely dangerous opportunity for the opposition,every game. He needs to be dropped, astounded by how blinkered the English sports media are in relation to him. Petulantly beating the ground when his last header was saved while the ball is still in play is a good indication of the quality of the man.
Maguire is actually brutal my god.
How is that west Brom goal allowed? The striker has blinded lindelof with his hands for a free header, and VAR didn't bother to check it? Absolute joke, VAR is so inconsistent.
Hahahahahahhahahahaha
Ole says Man U won’t settle for second! Leicester will finish second Man U will finish third! He also needs to understand Man City won’t settle for second
How TF is he our captain? .
What a dreadful team, should be winning these types of games at home with ease. Defence is an utter joke & the forwards are nowhere to be seen. Need a real manager not this clown.
Cant win Premier league with one guy. Even the great Ronaldo had Rooney Giggs Scholes Ferdinand. Bruno needs help alot of it. City to win this year thats confirmed.
Rubbish so called world class team can’t even beat West Brom. Crap..
Bergkamp level that goal
West Brom deserved to win with the chances they had
Bruno shinned it fluke
Can't believe that west brom goal wasn't ruled as a foul on lindelof he has his hand in his face and is jumping on him, Maguire had one ruled out for less a few games back absolute joke
What a set up that is from gallager for diagne and tbh hes could be decent for west bron diagne but i dont think their staying up
What made Maguire even worse in this game is by diving to try win a penalty
I know maguire is angry that he missed, but what is he doing at 2:50 😂
Maguire is far too soft
Bruno Fc.  Time for Dean Henderson to be in goal
Nah maguire is sick hes just been out of form since his fuckinh debut for man utd
So shocked the ref ended it there... A 4 on 1 counter attack were Those 3 points would be ours. They need to sort this out it’s so unfair... I don’t blame the Man U players for arguing with the ref! What a wrong decision.
Thank god they overturned that pen. Stupid decision.
I have had it with this club, if we can't beat a small club like united I'm leaving and going to arsenal
ManU not getting pens? Something ain't right here 🧐
The fact he blew the whistle at the end of the match as United were on the counter was unfair.
Where’s the Utd fans laughing at the WEST BROM GAME VS LIVERPOOL now
How is that a goal with his hand all over Lindelofs face ? Where is the consistency with decisions in the game these days ? Pile of crap.
Imagine how bad United would be if bruno was injured....
same spastic who red cared luiz when he stood still and other guy kicked him he really wanted to give man utd another penalty u can see he upset when he has to change it cause of VAR
0:20 OK but how is that allowed
Man utd play good one game then the next it's like that I mean cmon we lost to Sheffield
Lindelof defending was embarrassing wow
Fernandes goal has eclipsed Pogbas greatest volley of all time(which took a deflection)
That goal should not have counted at the 2nd minute he grabbed him n covered his eyes
Why is no one claiming a foul for the first goal? Diagne had his hand covering Lindelof's face and he stopped him jumping.. Can anyone explain?
Why is no one claiming a foul for the first goal? Diagne had his hand covering Lindelof's face!
Just me that thought West Brom’s goal was a foul?  And before half time united should’ve been able to play on
Now we know without pogba man united can never win any single game he’s our very important player I wish his very speedy recovery
How did Maquire not get a yellow card for diving, it should be a harsher punishment since its cheating. Guess that's one good thing for VAR to pick up.
Luke shaw has been excellent recently
West Brom should be disappointed. They should have taken all 3 points.
Diagne bullied united's defenders
Salah would've been awarded that penalty.
Bruno what a finish laddd
0:40gassed he didn’t score a pen for once 😂😂😂
So Andy wnkr Goldstein. We spend millions and millions, ohh but we are not ready to win it, even we are close to City. Let’s laugh at Liverpool instead. What an absolute wnkr.
Nice one West Brom!
Lowton’s goal was better
Get lindelof out get maguire out get 2 cbs in and stop being stubborn ole
If its not penalty it's got to a card for diving surely?
First goal is foul shoving hand into the face
No penalty no joy for the scums😂😂😂😂😂
If it wasn’t for Burno Fernandes then we would’ve been fighting for 17th place
Sorry to say but Maquire and Lindeloff are Liability. Agree with some people we need Bailey to start with either one.
Bruno's last week/this week's goals...amazing
Maguire, if he didn't dive,  he would of got to that ball and who knows,  head it across the box to be knocked into the net.  Poor decision.
Harry maguire with that reaction when he hit the post .. make my hate for him even more so
Lost due to bad ref  decision story of seaso. Ruby tackling a defender to score a header how it even was allowed to stand is baffling.
Maguire should have been booked for that swallow dive,disgrace
Manchester united have spent over 240 million with ole and still haven't won shite This includes maguire 80 mil,wan bissaka 50 mil,dan james 15 mil,bruno 40 million, donny 40,amad 30 million horrible recruitment getting maguire and donny could've spent that money on something actually needed for the club i don't know who does the signings if its ole than oleout
Usual Man Utd. No cohesion to their play at all, defence looking like a bunch of amateurs and Bruno the only shining light
Man United could win things if they didn't have those two donkey's Maguire and Lindelof.
The lucky scummers should have been beaten
The last few results show Manchester United are miles away from city and it's no surprise
So this week Craig Pawson reviews the penalty decision on the monitor yet David Luiz gets a straight red and he doesn’t even think to review the monitor. Mmmmmmm.....
Fantastic shin dig from bruno 😞
As usual the 2 centre halfs, Fred, martial, wan bissacka, all not good enough to win anything.
Great goal from Bruno but Man U are still crap
how that isnt a foul on lindelof is beyond a joke
united genuinely a one man team
“De Gea in 2 minds”  He gets so much slate from the media that they’re not going to address the issue that Maguire and Lindelof just don’t work
Hahahaha this was the team who thought they were title contenders
Man utd have one player missing in pogba and look at the difference. On the other hand liverpool at one point reach double figures
If I was lindelof I'd have been kicking the ref to check var I wouldnt be able to see if someone had there hands over my eyes what a joke var is they look at someone having there hand held yet not putting ur hands all over someone's face
lindeloff.looool. dead baller. got manhandled for that goal.
0:35 Maguire going of again😂, bro he has like 1 pace
Great penalty from fernandes
United fans a few weeks ago- we're going to win the league. In ole we trust.  United fans now- we knew we never had chance of winning the league. Ole out...
Our defence is like a cloth condom leaking every time
This game sums up Bruno for me. Poor most of the game, scores a goal and gets called world class 😂
How is that not a foul on Lindeloff? 0:23
He’s Portuguese he’ll score goals and what a goal in such brilliant form wouldn’t think about turning back the clock and not buying him like some other players
Not exactly a stunner though is it
maguire = 80 mill rip off. never buy of LCFC again
Let's go Bruno
Who thinks Brunos just gets gassed to much
Man City are 100% gonna win the league get beat in
West broms goal is a foul
My interest in football as disintegrated with no fans and kneeling before ko.
United are the definition of a one man team, no Bruno, no Champions League.
I wonder what's happened to 9 goal man utd this time? , . . . . Let me think , . . . Oh yeah , . . that's it , . . . I think I know now , . . . (man utd fan, Mike Dean wasn't refereeing). 😒😒😒.
Sam Johnston had no right to make those slaves. He should be ashamed.
Hardly a stunner
Every team can rely on their captain 99% of the time, relying on Maguire is another story
Not sure why lindelof even starts.. man utd tactics - pass on the wing and try cuttin in or crossing the ball.. martial not sure why he is even wearin that shirt. Ole really needs to start bailly and if bailly is injured then start tuanzebe but NOT lindelolf
Still Unbeaten away,however I feel Rashford and Martial offer limited invention or creative play these days.   Rashford was doing a little better today on the right,then when he went back to the left he had forgotten what to do there!!
Time for Martial to go. Dreadful player.
gary neville blaming de gea for utds struggle is a joke, everyone knows it's the defensive partnership letting is down. gary is joke, he should be ashamed
Title run is gone now
I can't stand united but how has that West Brom goal been allowed to stand??
​For all the Ole in fans i hope you are happy now. United fans yet again  blaming anyone except the manager who's had multiple windows to fix his  abysmal defence and hasn't.
You won't catch me arguing for United all that often but that was a clear foul on Lindelof for the West Brom goal. Clocks him in the back of the head *and* clawing at his face as he scores.  It was never a penalty though, they got that one right.
Why is no one talking about match fixing ??
Actually feel sorry for Big Sam...  It’s these easier matches they really should be winning
Maguire is a professional. Lol
Utd are crap , and city will be untouchable .
Bruno’s goal is giving me Zidane vibes
ha ha. This bunch of mugs obviously don’t want the league.
Does no one realise its in the past why we debating?
We will win the league they said 🤣🤣😂😂
Maguire is miserably pathetic.
United are a one man team
Did Maguire forget he's a defender
Nobody understands the rules of football game nowadays.🤷🏻‍♂️
You drop 5 points against the two bottom clubs, and you should be given the tin tac...
Maguire needs to brush upon his acting skills.
He took those penandes comments to heart
I'm surprised Bruno hasn't injured his back from carrying man united for the past year
Fernandes turning into prime Zidane with that volley
Well cant see Bruno Fernandes staying at united past next season. If that.
Ole oot ..
Not a united fan but how that isn't a penalty when the Salah one against City was is ridiculous. No consistency and VAR has made things significantly worse!
Who else counted the amount of times maguire was out of position such a bad cb you only take risks when your good at your job when ur bad you keep it simple press high what an arshole bailly or tuanzebe should be first choice not del and rodney
Man U lucky to get a point ngl
First goal was a foul on lindelof, covered his entire eyesight
Big slab head Maguire should never go down like that rediculous
Mancs dropping more points...inevitable. Maguire's turn to dive for penalties now I notice. Must be working their way through the team.
As much as lindelof is nowhere near good enough, he was definitely fouled for that 1st goal. You can't put your hands over a defenders face and cover their eyes.
Bruno is the man honestly
I don't think that was a pen but everyone has different opinions
I reckon Johnstone deserves a transfer to another PL side if West Brom go down (which they will do).
Anybody know when they will add the Bruno stunner to these highlights?
Diagne looks like a great signing. Yes he shouldn’t done better for those 2 chances, but he’s showing the grit and determination needed in the Premier League. Showed great strength for his goal ⚽️
As a Bradford city fan I can say that was definitely a foul can’t go round grabbing peoples face like that
Why does the ball getting hit sound soo good today??
Man utd need to stop relyin on bruno because if he gets injured that's us out so we need to stop relying on him he can get injured and then what will man utd do so come on
Flipping team is getting me depressed. I bought a box of 24 Ferrero Rocher for the Mrs for Valentines day which I ended up eating all by myself watching us play sideways all game plus with this centerback pairing not working...
maguire diving lol
De gea would be world class if he had a better and stronger defence in front of him
United got the taste of their own medicine lmao
we only drew because fergies last game was a draw against west brom 😉
The excuses will follow for ole and his bottlers after another disastrous result. And harry slabhead maguire saying west brom is a tough place to go just shows the mentality of this clown. Awful performance.
banter fc no united fans @me
He shinned it
Eric and Harry are the best central defence combination on the remaining league fixtures if Man U wants to put pressure on Man City  Ole food for thought
Let’s all hope the Ramos rumours r true so that lindelof can disappear
Ah yes, Fruno Fernandes, fantastic player
Not in a million years does Vidic get bullied the way Lindelof did for that first goal.  Just so weak.   Embarrassing.
Apparently man utd was going to win everything this year?
MUTD tbh should of won
We definitely need to invest into cb position we never gonna win the league with maguire and lindelof absolute disgracefu!!!l 😤
West Brom goal was a foul on the defender. I’m not Man Utd or West Brom. Simple
Bruno the pen machine is a fraud
I actually feel sorry for united fans that maguire is there captain he’s pathetic
Hahahaha Maguires reaction to his header at the end, like a little child. Most over rated player of all time.
Hahahahahahahahah Man loser Utd at it again they won’t win anything for another 8/15 years.
Lindelof with blind fold header clear
I mean Lindelof is terrible but he was surely fouled... lol  joke VAR again...
Man u fans crying about west broms goal but forget what united players do in other games 😂😂😂😂 biggest bunch of crybabies in the game
Maguire playing like a second striker.
They would be lost without Fernandes, they better hope he doesn't get injured
To be fair, the home crowd created quite an intimidating atmosphere.
A consolation is that greenwood did a very good job when he cane on, brought some energy into the team.
0:23 so grabbing someones face is allowed?
if Fernandes gets injured utd. are in serious trouble
Two very well taken goals there. Maguire with some loose touches but my main criticism is that he should have made more of the chance in-play rather than look for the pen. Rashford has been labouring under Rooney-itis for a while now: too many touches. Come on, Ole - what we need from Rasher is bang-bang-bazooka, less of the clever stuff.
Lindlof has the strength of a 14 year old girl and Maguire is a cart horse.
Wow man u are trash
west broms goal should hav been disallowed, he put his hand in lindelofs face which prevented lindelof from heading the ball out
Should have been var at first goal.Defo faul over Lindeloff!
Utd fans  crying about the ref im like  wtf
Seeing the Manchester United players play like this, well it’s just upsetting.
West Brom should’ve well won that with that 1 on 1 chance and then that Diagne chance as well
Anything is truly possible.. man u denied a penalty ????
Bit confused how it’s not a foul on lindelof when he grabbed his face so he can’t head the ball ?
Let's hope Bruno doesn't get injured.... It'll be Vauxhall South boy scout division pub league if he does
United not getting a pen and bruno still scoring must be a record
2 defensive midfielders against West Brom! Its West Brom not Bayern Munich
Bruno goal was amazing.......& im a huge Utd hater
I though Ole was wrong for saying United were not title contenders, I hated the negative perspective, and effective put down on his group of players. However after the last couple of performances he was right to save himself the embarrassment. Everyone should have figured by now that the best way to combat United is still 10 players behind the ball and hit us on the break, down the middle against Lindelof and Maguire.
Superb goal but only papering over the cracks. Without him an ordinary mid table team. Sorry Ole nothings changed  !!
It looks like Ole's taken united as far as he can.. Would the end of the season be a good time to look for the next manager to take us to the next level?
Manu won the league on January 🤣🤣🤣
Ole Out
Ole in err no Ole out  no Ole in no get him out err Ole in
W Brom deserved to win.
Ole mate please stop playing lindelof and maguire we badly need a top class centre back
Diange should of had a hattrick
Good god this team is so inconsistent!!
A cross into the 6 yard box. Where's the keeper?
All the Man Utd fans saying their gonna charge to the title where are u now 😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
The problem is ..... that nobody can touch an opponent without them giving away a foul. It’s a shame but that’s what happens when football is influenced too much by foreign football and rolling around on the floor for 2 mins after someone stood on his shoelace. Imagine vidic Keane Viera keown playing in this era. They’d all be sent off three times a match 🤣
As arsenal fan Bruno fernandez should leave united he should be playing with better players.
Maguire trying to cheat a penalty manu players must do that in training near as bad as spurs players
Lindelof is overrated 😴
2:07 can you imagine if keane was on the pitch and maguire did that he would be yelling at him
Why is the title written like it's a man utd youtube channel 😅 the bias is incredible
Just imagine where utd would be without fernandes??????? Talk about relying on one man week in week out
All praise to Sam Johnstone amazing performance!
Fernandes could be balling at Barcelona but chose Manchester 🤣🤣🤣🤣
United THE NEW BOTTLE JOBS OF THR PREMIER LEAGUE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Again United can't break a team's park the bus. How is Maguire literally playing like a striker?
Well then it’s fair to say city are winning the league
Only 1-1 hey
Apart from the goal, Bruno was hopeless, far too many poor passes. Lindehof is, and always has been a disaster. I really don't understand why Martial keeps his spot. He has no movement, no appreciation of what is happening around him. sulks. never tracks back every time he loses the ball and he stops Rashford fom playing on the right where he is far more effective. At this rate top 4 looks unlikely.
BTEC Sadio Mane out here taking freebies. crap defence why didn't we buy CB in Jan window
Media suck off bruno
West Brom had 2 great chances to win the game. Lindlehoff, Fred, McTominey and Martial are not good enough to play for Manchester United. Rashford needs to wake up as he has been useless lately. Greenwood has real ability but needs to step up now. Without Fernandez, where would United be?
Bruh so the referee can give Maguire and varchester United a penalty (even if it was overturned) but when Maguire rugby tackles azpi again, the referees will act like nothing happened
Why wasn't maguire booked for simulation....
Man United don't even deserve bruno Fernandes, they only brought him cause fans that were to impatient to watch their club grow attacked ed Woodward's home with flares, great fans they are
Maguire doesn't do clean sheets on Valentines Day
How was this penalty over turned but David luiz wasn’t, same ref as well btw
Lindelof is weak man
I don’t understand shaw’s positioning for the West Brom goal he’s not marking anyone either go out or mark someone
Bruno leaving after the end of this season. Utd is not on Bruno's level.
😂 total shite 😂
I hate this team.
Everyone subscribe to the channel
"Title contenders" 😂😂😂
Bloody United no Bruno no United sad but true the rest it’s just standing there doing nothing
Dw Man U fans beating West Brom is not for everyone LOL
OLE OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:23 are you allowed to cover the eyes of the defender?
Genuinely feel bad for Bruno fernandes
HARRY IS A WALKING FRIDGE
A big Sam masterclass
Diange is the new heskey and big Sam loves it. We'll be playing hoofball in the championship.
I cant be the only person that thinks Leicester getting £80m for Maguire is daylight robbery. I think he is worth several hundred million To every team vying for the top 4
When will Ole (as much as I love him as a club legend) learn that the centre back partnership is just not working?
United will never win league . Need to replace manager and center back s.
What the team should look like   De gea,awb,bailly, Maguire, shaw,pogba,mctominay, Fernandes, Greenwood,rashford, cavani
Top of the league hahahahhaha
Looks like City are walking the league this year. Liverpool are a shadow of their former selves of the past 2 seasons and the other teams in the chasing pack are nothing but pretenders.
What's that little Maguire tantrum (after he hit the post)???
Man Utd can not win anything with their back four and de gea
Bruno goal similar to zidane goal in ucl final👍⚽️😀
man united back to their days
Well done Man City on winning the league!, don't think any other team stands a chance now......
Very poor display by Utd especially Rashford and Martial . I just can’t see how the Baggies goal was allowed , a crazy decision by ref and then by Var. But that’s no excuse for how poor Utd were today.
Only players who want to win are bruno, cavani and shaw, rest just happy to play for fun
Wasnt even that great of a goal.
How can the West Brom goal stand, when the forward had his hand block Lindelof face? Did they use VAR?
Diagne caused havoc to the United back line
How was that not a foul on lindelof?
Ldmemes1 on tiktok
What's worried me is we didn't have a worldie last match, that's usually when the next game we go behind in the first ten seconds and then have to beat a back 10.
Alternative title.  Brunos Equalizer draws the game
Man did de gea save Maguire from becoming a LOL meme or what
Maguire is such a slug
Luke shaw and Bruno are two of the most overrated players in the league atm closely followed by grealish u can’t disagree
Dear Man City, congratulations on winning the 2020/21 Premier League. Despite all the doubt in people's mind, you managed to pull through, thanks to new signing Ruben Dias as well as the regeneration of Joao Cancelo and Ilkay Gundogan. We don't know how next season will go for you, but 3 titles in 5 seasons is a hell of an achievement that would ibkt be reached by the 'Centurions', Man City P.s. Not a city fan, just felt it suited the game.
Stunner ??? O how football has changed
My god Lindelof is awful. He’s a centre half, he has GOT to be strong and at least put up a challenge in the air. So weak. The only thing more painful is watching Rashford and Martial trying to attack these days. So off form it’s unreal.
loool liverpool fans are back to the man utd draw comment section. you wouldn't find one one them in their matches when ever they draw. they drew to west brom so idk why they are so big and criticising united players.
just handing the league away aren't they, dropping points to relegation sides, great goal by fernandes though you just feel he is wasting his talent at manchester united
Lindelof isnt a CB  - that being said his face was grabbed and he was hauled over for the first goal -  never should have stood
I don't even know why Maguire pulls a defenders shirt on, I'm sure he wishes he was centre forward. Fernandez must be regretting going to United
Only man u can concede within the first 2 minutes n have their fans complain when the other team park the bus
Great goal by Bruno on his weak foot
Bruno for me is probably the best cam in the world right now, not even a man United fan but he is incredible
More proof lindeloff and maquire don't work and that martial and rashford just aren't good enough
Bruno penandes only scores against small teams
Uncle Ruckus.....wheres the excuses
2 pathetic dives from Maguire. Leaves his leg in to make sure there's contact (he should have been booked for that) and then someone snipes him for that challenge near his own goal. Absolutely ridiculous. Football is a contact sport and this is the men's game. Start acting like it and stop trying to cheat for cheap penalties
De Gea is made to look so much worse by incompetent centre backs in front of him.
And they said he can only score pens and free kicks 😅
How is Maguire captain... he can’t even lead a back line let alone the whole team.   Make Bruno captain.
I just hate the constant diving, it’s basically cheating and it’s every single game now
Farmers league
Utd fans right now “That goal was better the Zidane’s volley in the 01 CL final.”   🤣🤣🤣
Lindolf and fred can pack their bags
Bailly is our best defender consistent games he’ll be one of the best bruh
Sign two def defenders and and a defensive midfielder before we even think about a right winger. Sick of this nonsense.
Ole is not listening to the media about his goal conceding centerbacks and keeps starting them and then has to take two mid fielders to protect them..leaving the midfield wide open, Ole is totally to blame when these two concede also for today's loss because that's what it is classed as Come the end of the season if we don't finish in 2nd place I don't think he should be offered another contract, we need a manager who is not afraid to make changes in the first and 2nd halfs if need be!..Rant over!
Embarrassing result for United.
Maguire should be done for diving. Featherlight touch on the shoulder, go down. Penalty. Thank you VAR, for once it went Baggies way.
Penandes scores one good goal and everyone thinks hes great..  hes average at best  Up the Albion Sams at the wheel   Diagne > Rashford Martial Cavani
Fantastic first goal
Tbh ill take a point out of the game with how bad we defended.
Poor dive attempt from Harry Maguire. He needs to do a star jump like Mo Salah. That will get him a penalty!
ANYONE BUT THE MANCSCUM
Haha. What a joke. They couldnt even beat one of the worst team's în the league.
Lol
Marcus Rashford.... your top quality, but you need to start being more selfish in front of goal.... to many touches, just hit it !
I'm United in disappointment.  WBA for God's sake.
Shinner not that fantastic
stunner? swung his leg at it, came off his shin and flew top bag...
Surely if that was no foul on Maguire then he should get a yellow card for diving as he deliberately threw himself to the ground
people should get off man utd s back for a small club they played their best football they are able to play against such a heavy weight club like west brom
West brom should of won
SHUT UP GARY
Tell me about the goal of Bruno Fernandez it was out standing
Sick goal but terrible perfomance
How is that a stunner ?
OLE has once again shown he has not a clue starting with 2 holding midfielders against a 2nd to bottom side! If teams are not there for a counter attack United do not know what to do and OLE has had over 100 games and still doesn't have a plan B. Don't be surprised if united do not finish in the top 4 and there are supporters who think we're heading in the right direction!!! No team can win anything relying on one player alone and nor can OLE rely on Bruno to save his skin each time!
Why is OSG still playing Linderflop?
"pen merchant" they said
Maguire and Lindelof is such a poor combination tbh
I'm a City fan, but surely that first West Brom goal HAS to be a foul?!? How can you cover someones eyes and stop him from seeing? lol. Why didn't this go to VAR. Absolutely pathetic decision to not see that?
Everyone saying insane goal from bruno but shaw with the cross.
why play lindelof, how many points have they cost us !! two defensive midfields against west brom, why why, dose ollie never learn from experience
Stunner it wasn’t even an  amazing goal it was average
Can’t beat a team that sits back and defends same thing time and time again, only look a decent side on the counter like. Shocking tactics
Reminds me of the zinedine zidane goal
MU, a top 2 team, is luck not to lose a bottom 2 team. We can't tell which is which!
Man u games are random
First off. Not a stunner  Second. Stop bumming Bruno
Captining Bruno was not a managerial masterclass
Where are the deluded trolls that insisted MU were winning the Prem cause they managed to string a couple of wins together?
Wait wait wait can please someone explain to me how WestBrom’s goal stand when Diagne covers Lindelof’s eyesight the exact time he headers the ball? That’s fucked refereeing🤨
I don’t understand why people are angry at de gea, today he saved united but because he isn’t English he won’t be appreciated when he plays well, maguire and lindelpf were a meme
United fans been real quiet after this one
Man Ure a bit like Fergie's last premiership bunch - pub team + Van Persie / Pub team + Fernandes.
The United defence are useless
Ha ha ha Well done West Brom 👍👍👍
Good thing United won the league back in January 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Odd bunchester united
David de gea has let in 61% of shots this season, more than any other goalkeeper. Was shocked at that stat as de gea seems to escape any critism
The sooner the likes of west brom and sheff utd get relegated the better , cant be bothered with these type of teams who pick and chose how they want to perform against certain teams , roll over for city and leeds lose 5-0 , turn into prime Barcelona and scrape a draw against utd and their keeper turns into superman and saves everything.  How wasnt that a foul on lindelof btw? His hand literally all over lindelofs face , hopefully cavani rashford bruno etc take note and do that in future to other CB if thats allowed then
Okay but how wasn’t that a foul on Lindelof?
The var guy must off had hands all over his face that he didn't see foul on lindof for West brom goal. 🤔
Bruno is crazy good
1:38 how does Maguire not get a pen when Salahs dive is even more blatant  against city and thats a penalty???
Mbaye Diagne a beast !!
Is it just me or is that a blatant foul on lindelof for the first goal
Maguire is stealing a living, he's literally an air head when it comes to defending.
I don't know what's worse, the officiating or gary neville commentary. Not a single mention of the hand in the face being a foul, or the corner not given, or the no extra added time at the end of the first half during a united counter attack, or the studs raked down the back of rashfords achilles.  Just awful. Then again, I think united's defense is worse than both of these things.
We don't deserve a top spot we are just an average team now
Was the first goal not a foul? So attackers can now grab and cover someone's face?
I hate Bruno and united but I can’t deny he is world class
I feel sorry for bruno he carrys his team with a wonderful goal and noone can do anything else against the second bottom team
West Brom goal was a clear foul
Is this suppose to be progress?  Ole Out!!
What a pen from Bruno
United will never be challengers until they sort out their cab pairing
Wow man utd's defence is shite.
Why are we still using Slabby and Lindoloft.??? They always seem to be playing for the other team. De Gea gets no support from these eejits. 🤯🤯
We won’t even get top 4 this year. Dreadful yet again. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Istanbul Yubuks (cost us the champions league qualification), Sheffield Utd all beat us which is a disgrace. Terrible season. Title contenders for 1 week. Utter crap.
Maguire can’t even dive properly 🤦🏻‍♂️!!! Twice he’s thrown himself on floor in that game
Why didn’t McGuire get booked for simulation?
As a Man City I must say bad luck united.......BWAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAAAHAHA!
Off his shin
Once again the ref and Var are inconsistent, its a foul on Lindelof for West Broms goal, yet there was a goal struck off for Maguire a few weeks ago for something similar
Stunner. Wonderful controlled volley. Even harder when using his shin.
United are nothing
You would think playing a team 19th in the league, Ole would play an attacking midfield, yet he chooses mcfred and yet they still concede.
De gea cannot be blamed when he has 2 donkey Center backs infront of him
2:49 Maguire would not make a good bunny
Maguire should leave it too salah and Bruno. 3/10.
I’ve got a funny feeling they’ll be a 5 minute clip coming soon of how the first goal was De Geas fault by sky sports
Danny Van de Bench !! Played too. 😂
why is nobody talking about that amazing sam johnstone save
ole in
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the mighty west Brom 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ole's at the wheel 🤡
Anyone blaming de gea for the first goal doesnt know football. The ball was put in the area that is impossible for the keeper. Dont know how you dont give a foul lindelof couldnt see because of the west Brom players hand in his face
Hate man u  only time when I'll b supporting sandwell when the playing the rent a fan tribe...any manc fans from manchester I wonder...
They need to start handing out 3+ match bans for anyone caught diving for penalties.   I'm a Liverpool fan and I know players like Salah do it far too often.  If you can't beat a team without diving for penalties then you don't deserve to win anyway.
Ahahah how do yous draw to west brom
Without Fernandes united would be mid table 100%
That West Brom striker is a cb worst nightmare  Plays like a bully could be what they need to kick on
maguire is awful.
Loving the united fans today haha. You're a diva when your hungry...still be divas come may
Utds 2 CBs are comical, they haven't had a good defensive partnership since Vidic & Rio, that's over 8years ago.
'Stunner'. Man Utd fans at Sky and BBC trying to convince people to like Bruno Penalt-des as much as they do. Not happening.
Why Maguire keep failing over like a lil girl
Saved by De Gea today
maguire put is hand up on clear goals as if var will help him
He shinned it, just like rooney
Their first is a foul on Lindelof all day long.
Anyone catch Maguire's reaction after his header being saved? Hilarious
Pogba so under rated. Best player in the league by far and hes still only 23. Future star
If maguire is worth 70 mil im scarlett johanssen, only united can get to a great position that they are then lose to sheffield united, draw last min to everton And draw to west brom which most people put there money on for united to batter them
Fernandes to good for Man Utd ,Madrid come knocking soon .
Why can’t we do anything without Bruno?  Why is our defense still a shambles? Honestly these tactics need to be changed. I’m still ole out tbh, if we want to to seriously challenge for a title or any trophy.
It was worth it to see Bruno's STUNNING strike!
How does west broms goal stand? Literally got his hand over lindelofs face. How can anyone meet a header blind?
Lindelof - what a joke of a defender
Ole out
And no doubt the deluded united fans think they're title contenders still 😂
Good game for everyone
Bruno's goal reminds of agueros in the Derby between City and utd
If u hit a ball with your shin u can’t tell where it’s going so it’s just so lucky. United can only ride there luck for so long
Typical Man Utd, can't beat the bottom clubs. 😂
Look at Fred when Fernandes scores.. He ALWAYS celebrates goals like it's his first.. I love this guy.
Slab head couldn't finish his dinner cheek untied fans laughing at liverpool get back to us when use actually win something 💩💩💩💩💩
Lindelof was fouled when west Brom scored. The guy had his hands on lindelof's face.
Does Bruno need to move to a big club to win trophies?
You all shite today too much ego on the team
Where’s uncle rukus
Does Macguire play a central attacking midfielder? He’s always up field trying to get a goal. Liability.
Ladies and gentlemen this is the team which supposedly said they'll win the league 😂😂 their fans do know what pure humour is for sure
Better call KwikFit, The wheels have come off again
Can someone tell Rashford he is not RONALDO either shoot or pass !!!
What a player  Dianga not bruno
Lindeloff and slab head are both shocking! GLAZERS OUT!  OLE OUT! WOODWARD OUT!
I'm a city fan ... that was a pen on Maguire
Harry Maguire interview after the game: "We turned up with out Utd shirts on and it should have been enough to win the game.  I even flung myself to the floor from an offside position in a blatant attempt to cheat and it wasn't given as a penalty.  It's just not fair"
"Highlights" there wasn't any.
That utd defence is really letting the team down
Glad to see maguire paying tribute to davinson sanchez
If it's not a penalty, surely Maguire should be booked for simulation? I haven't seen a card given for going to ground too easily for a long time.
De He's needs to be dropped now for sure
man u are losing far too many points and won't win the league will get top 4.
Was hardly a stunner
We should've won that
Maguire and lindeoff don’t work together they should change the formation
Can someone tell Rashy that passing is legal in football? The amount of time he looses the ball or makes poor decisions because he thinks he is Ronaldinho...
That hand in your face would have gotten called in any other game. Cmon now
Rashford, martial and Fred should of all been subbed off at the same time, they were all useless, it’s time for diallo now
I’m down with physicality and it’s a good header but  surely blinding someone by putting your hand over their  eyes is a foul..
Bruno is fuming. He deserves better
Mc Fred have no creativity to help Bruno out and our cb pairing is awful I don’t understand why we make the same mistakes game after game I’m not saying ole out but this isn’t the guy to win us the prem or champions league again it’s harsh but I think it’s true
How's number 17 for WBA allowed to cover Lindeloff's face?
relegation form , the manager uses the same players , same tactics every week , not giving a chance to other players he sees only Rashford , Maguire and Lindelof  even tho Bailey showed that is the best cb in the squad right now
Bruno’s goal was quality but we failed again today deliver .. Cavani got no service at all again even though you could see his moves ..  martial was poor again today meaning Rashford again played out of position to accommodate him and we lost Rashford to the right wing ..
Blatant foul on Lindelof when WBA score!
Honestly,  West Bromwich deserved to win the game. Look how many clear opportunities they missed.  Bloody lucky Man United!
Bruno dragging United out of the proverbial, we're would they be without him?
I can’t see our stricter what they doing
West brom shouldve wom.
Congratulations to Man City for winning the league 🎉👏
Brunos shot The sort of goal you did in school with ya big black clogs on from clarks shoe store claiming you was meant to score like that and swearing on your life it wasn't a fluke
Stunner? It came off his shin
How we gonna win games if we have Lindeolf and Maguire in defence 🤡🤡
Goals get overrated like players these days.
I’m not jumping on the lindolof hate train. From a chelsea fan, that’s 100% a foul. Shoving his hand in his face
They need more players like Bruno Fernades
We'll see alot more of Sam Johnstone next season, his performances have been chalk and cheese above the quality of the team
Banter FC LOOOOOOOOOL
bruno is are Best Buy in 10 years
Bruno Fernandes' back must be close to breaking from carrying the other 10 no-hopers this far
Bruno potm only trophy United getting
I don't watch a lot of football, that first goal in slowmo it looks like the striker for wba puts his hand over the defenders face. I thought stuff like that got reviewed?
If macguire was any other nationality he’d be shredded by English press.
Bad Penalty from Bruno got Lucky there
What a performance from Gallagher
Bottlers
Im watching MU games since i was a kid, close to 2 decades, and i seriously think Lindelof and Maguire is the worst central def duo i saw in our red dress 🤦‍♂️ Jones Smalling is a serious contender tho
Referees being paid of by city
Defo need another centre half and a striker martial not good enough
Makes a change for it to not be a penalty
What a save btw at the end from Johnson
Bruno deserves to be playing in a better side
Embarrassing can’t create a chance against West Brom apart from a corner
Linderlof and maguire will get ole sacked
Never a pen, united fan.
Man utd reality check, you love to see it.
hahaha
Fernandes needs to leave UTD if he wants to win things.
Surely you can't award a goal when someone grabs a defender in the face like that. Fs what a joke
Title contenders😂😂😂😂
Why didn't Manchester United win today.   Graeme Souness: well it's Paul Pobga fault.
Man City just killed the league again 🤣
When Bruno was at Sporting, he was really our savior, easily our best player. Did not expect him to be Manchester United's savior and easily their best player, is he prove that the rest of the team are severely overrated? or has he managed to become a better player? His goal and assist stats are improving which is a massive surprise.
I mean I know the defence is shocking but there goal was a foul
Would have loved to have heard what Roy keane had to say about that first half from Man United
😂😂😂
Even his stunners are scored from the penalty spot
Bottlers fc
So grabbing someone’s face to climb across them is allowed, that’s a new one lol
United throwing as usual
You can see the lack of quality dip since Jessie Lingard left.
Bro if Ramos goes to united are defence would be 🔥
Bruno was shocked he actually didn’t score a penalty
if its not a penalty then surely Maguire should be booked for diving??
the United players have had that many penalties by cheating that it has become second nature to drop to the ground with no contact, Maguire trying what Pogba, Rashford, Bruno, Martial and Greenwood have done all season!
if any top 6 teams had the same chances as diange Man U would have been gobbled
Maguire likes playing people onside he even does it at the wrong end of pitch🤦‍♂️
Wonder how long it will be until Real Madrid comes calling for Bruno.
Typical united defending
Didn't realise deliberately trying to claw someone's eyes out was now part of football
Maguire you cheating bastard
1 like= 1 mill  to fix man u defance
This man knocked tens of millions off the glazers wage bill while saying 'they've spent loads of money' about those same owners who have removed 2 billion form the club.  Make no mistake, this man wasn't hired to bring success
Was a good finish, not a wonderstrike
Man United shiudl be unhappy becuase they drew with the  team in the bottom three
Rashford played absolutely woeful on the left. He’s so scared to use his left foot. The amount of time she had acres of space to drive the ball towards to the by line and get a cross in but instead cut inside and lost the ball is insane. He needs to be played on the right.
A quick CB. A proper right winger. An attack minded right back for teams that sit back. And i think man utd are in business. I genuinly think man utd will be a proper threat next season. Still in process.
Lindelof you pussy
The commentary’s are so up brunos ass
United really does not want to win the league
I'm a Liverpool fan and I can't even laugh😢
To me, if you don't or actually can't win the game, no matter how good the goal is, it doesn't matter. A win is more important than a world class goal. United are struggling to beat relegation battling teams and that is sickening even for a struggling Uniteds level. United definitely need a new centre back partnership. Lindelof and Maguire are both not the right pair. They also need a goal scoring good crossing and dribbling right winger. Give Diallo a chance from now until the end of the season. If he doesn't do well enough, then that's when you sign another player in that position
Good shinner 😂✌️⚽️
Bruno’s on form mad goal by him
Can you believe that there are people who say that the refs are on utd's side
man u are the worse team of all time
I have that feeling bruno might leave next year for a big team dont know why
Referee supports West Brom
the strategy of scoring via free kicks and penalty with penandes only takes you so far.....
Great goal from Bruno!!! Unfortunately our defending has let us down AGAIN FFS GET IT 2Gether guys!!! This is ridiculous come on!!! We’re United Not just unity!!! 💣🔥🗣💯
Penandes the most over rated playing in the Prem
Bought a Fridge for 75 million pounds . What a waste
We need 2 new CB. Both Macguire and Lindeloff are not good enough to challenge a cup never minnd titles.
When did mane sign for West Brom ?
YES COME ON GET IT!
Finally dvb played his position
just sell lindeloff and maguire this summer and get some new DF.
When the ref blew the whistle for half time we were on a counter attack. Why is no one talking about that
Superb goal bruno . Sam johnstone another great game in goal for WBA against united .
Diagnes hand was in lindleofs face for the first goal which stopped lindleof from heading the ball but we can't make excuses. United need to get back on form
Shaw is underrated with his crossing smh
From Vidic and Ferdinand to Maguire and Lindelof. How the mighty have fallen.......
Get you a girl that wants to give you head as much as Diagne wanted to head that ball.
dont understand how maguire wasnt ruled offside in the first place before he dived corrupt utd aupporting refs i guess? 🤔
Foul on lindelöf
Manchester is Blue and always will be
Seems a bit odd that you can put your hand across a defender’s face to obscure his view and then your resulting goal stands. Great header though, but still seems a little unfair.
Man City has this premiership.
The centre back partnership at fault for the goal but the media will blame De Gea
Wahey
united lucky to get a point
Diagne is a MMA football player . He is going to tear apart PL defenders.... lmfao
the way i see the highlights looks like a 3-3  or win for west brom,i think is a fair draw
Not a stunner 😂
West Brom away isn’t for everyone
Need to get rid of maguire and lindelof
Disgraceful from United...
Lindeloff and Maguire do not work well together it’s as simple as that..   Bailey is a machine give him more play!!
Miskick from Bruno, lucky baggies didn’t run away with it
Who’s here after United main target upamecano joined Bayern Munich
how can anyone still back ole, mans a fraud and needs to be let go this summer
West Brom actually are decent against top 6 teams
this was a painful watch  and i'm a neutral party
Solskjær’s intern at United is nearly up. Get in a proper manager United please.
United dropping points again. Congratulations to City for officially winning the league
Pmsl win a league title can not even beat wba
Looked like a foul on Lindelof for the goal. Point away from home against rugged and determined opposition. Take the positives - still 2nd
Man Utd is in the top 4 just because of Bruno Fernandes, if Bruno doesn’t play or leave then Man Utd will definitely overtake Sheffield United for the bottom place. Man Utd has become one player team.
Bruno Fernansch
Matial again was absolutely rubbish. Just hasn't a clue and has zero talent
Lucky get a point, god united were dire today....... Been like this all season
Ngl bruno is running the show in United
Well United were linked with upamecano   Well guess what  He’s gone to Bayern Munich  No defender coming then
Slabhead showing how useless he is again.
Maguire you are the worst captain we have had ever! Take responsibility you are really poor and need to step down
Finally a good decision on a pen
Disappointed, it wasn’t a penalty!
Nice goal
Apart from the poor performance Brunos goal was world class
Maguire, you follow the ball till the end, not cry and roll like a baby in the supermarket. How tf are you a man untd player, with that atitude!!!
johnstone save of the season
Harry McGuire Manchester United's wackest player, he is solely to blame for everything wrong with this team..
0:22 Surprised United didn't get a freekick for that. Was expecting VAR to take it back and give United a pen for something random.
Bruno Fernandes steps up again.. with a rocket! No stopping that one. Ahah! 😁
Maguire taking notes out of Salah’s book
First Sheffield then west Brom better not play Fulham ..Uniteds defence is shite
I actually feel bad for De gea when he's got Maguire and lindelof in front of him. They offer about as much protection as a cheesecloth condom.
I think I’ve just seen a reincarnation of zidane 😳😳😳😳😳😳
I swear the west brom striker legit blocked lindelofs view with his hand on his face wtf
not going to show brunos dive again then 🤔
Diagne would be bought once they go down. Strong player💪💪💪💪💪,
Can't argue with just how good Bruno Fernandes is right now,Manchester United would be nothing without this guy!
Johnstone deserve an England call up
I hate Man Utd how can they not beat west brim I am so 🤬😡
Here we go again how can he justify playing martial he does absolutley nothing with greenwood on he brings a better balance to the team
Let's all laugh at Man Utd !!  😆😆😆😆😆
Who said these clowns were title contenders again? 😂😂😂
Why can't ole see that lindelof and maguire don't work and mctominay and fred don't work he needs to put vdb next to mctominay or fred and bailly or tuanzebe next to maguire
Late subs and even when we make subs we play the same
That brom striker looks hungry to score and doesn't care bout being rough
02:05 maguire showing us why hes a £75million pound defender
Sam Johnson saved the day for West Brom and he’s another ex man united goalkeeper!
1 man team.
Forget the title race, we out here trying to beat leicester for 2nd!
Left foot volley (click) sweet as a nut.
Lol Man U were soo lucky to come away from this game with anything!
This is what happens when you put a PE teacher against an experienced manager like Big Sam.
Just give city the trophy already
Ole Outttt—sttanding with another bottled performance 🎭. Realistic top 6 finish. When will the excuses end?
I'm not gonna blame it on the refs because we weren't great but some of the decisions imo were very questionable
we all new we wasn't going to win the league, still proud of the effort some of the boys have put in this season, hopefully a 2nd place finish <3
We should have got that pen and that opportunity right at the end by harry was so close that could have been 3-1 there but let see how man utd go common you REDS Manchester United
Here to warn you all not to watch, don't waste your time
Win nothing with that back 5, could have 3 brunos won't make a difference
im a United fan and i gotta admit. We don't deserve Bruno.
Rubbish highlight. No Garry Neville "oooooo" sounds
This is why nobody takes united serious anymore LOL
Bring back Smalling
Congratulations our noisy neighbours for winning the premiership in February.
That Fernandes goal was almost reminiscent of Zidane's volley.
West Brom should of won
Can we appreciate Luke Shaws crosses
Just isnt a stunning goal
I wonder who will get PFA player of the year
That Bruno goal is classed as a "STUNNER" now? Really? Jesus, the PL is going downhill fast if that's the case....
Ole is an imbecile, every single game it's been apparent Lindelof and Maguire are terrible as a pair, they don't have the pace for a high line and need to pair one with Bailly who has that pace. Diagne bullied those centre halves with speed and being aggressive. It could have been so different with Bailly alongside a composed Maguire
Worst man u squad in living memory
What is your excuse this time Solskjaer ?? Should have played Henderson and Greenwood from the beginning.
All united fans with a bottwr taste in their mouths thinking all this time they were title contenders haha. You should know by now that united ain't gonna win the league for another 23 years haha
That’s Utd not winning the League ffs
Breaking hearts even on valentines day
I dont think they will win the league now tbh but i hope they win a trophy this season!
West Brom deserved to win this but how was their first goal given? His hand was in the eye of Lindelof
Hand on face = no foul  Maguire one finger on players back = foul
I’ll always back Ole but he’s starting to really annoy me & most the fan base. Maguire & lindeloff don’t complement eachother. Also when we concede early there’s no intensity, it’s as if they think ‘it’s fine we have the rest of the game to score’
These man are jus inconsistent it's why I don't think they'll win the league this season
On behalf of all Liverpool fans: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Where would Man Utd be without Bruno?
Ole cant use the 4231 it's getting abit boring needs to try something different cus teams will start to now we camt defend low blocks
More like..'utd hold wba'
How this team is second baffles me, the quality of the top teams in the premier league is worryingly pathetic.
Bruno never gives up
All teams find it hard to defend the title after all Man Utd win the league three weeks ago
Title Contenders?? 😂😂😂😂  Have a Day off 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂
I remember last month when people thought united were gonna win the league
United should forget about titles. Go join west Brom and Fulham and them man there....
Maguire and Lindelof are one of the worst centre back pairings in the league. They just bring out the worst in each other so Man U have to play two holding midfielders to shield them.
2:44 you've got to give credit to Sam Johnstone there!!! What a save👌💪🏻
For West Brom this will be a win For united a loss
Both west brom goals were fouls on the utd player.
LMAO AT THE MANCSCUM 😂😂  😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
God only knows where Utd would be without good old Bruno🤔
Get rid of these motherf defenders
The ref was an actual joke. How was the first goal even given and Mcguaires header a couple games back not?
When will fans realise that ole isn’t this manager to take us back to the top 🤔 let the contract run down after he’s built something that can be built on
I wonder if the city rumour for Bruno is true be good to see him in good team 👌👌
Maguire was offside, but if they gave a penalty, there would have been a riot, If your offside it doesn't matter if the West Brom player fouled Maguire. Utd get too many dodgy decisions Game after Game
The most lightweight centre half who dives every week...
I hope 2 god United buy a top quality CB in the summer, coz United r gonna win nothing with that CB pairing.
Because ole keeps playing a defensive midfield against defensive teams then realising we are not creating enough too late 🙄
Bruno united lucky to get a draw
Tbf west brom were great defensively and played well ,and goalie played well for them well deserved point to them
Defense wins you titles......   Goodbye
Ole master class! Big Sam will be disappointed with only a draw for sure
Wheres mark goldbridge
Why wasn’t Bailly playing 🤦‍♂️
Lol.
Remember when people were saying man united are in the title race
Not like last week was enough evidence. But looks like it’s City’s to lose 😉💙
United need to get rid of the centre backs and goalkeeper. Martial given chances but not consistent needs to go. Should have brought Grealish and Maddison/Sane in the summer.
Slab head played well 🤣🤣
Used to slander Bruno now I jus feel sad for him that he’s playing so good whilst the rest of his team is subpar
I've never seen a weaker cb than Victor Lindelof. He makes clumsy maguire look like Hulk Hogan.
Why do Man Utd need to go behind to start playing well?
United are just weak from the management right down to the players
What a fascinating match to watch!! Excellelnt goal by Bruno
Big Sam literally strikes again!💪
don't know how someone can seroiusly rate Ole as a (top 6) manager besides his man management - new coach /manager needed for next season.
we were gonna score on the counter attack and then the ref blew for half time ffs!
Where is uncle ruckus now 👀🤨😆
Stop calling them albion I'm a Brighton fan and we all call it albion I thought we'd drawn with United
Albion deserved to win this!
Craig pawson taking away a penalty from Bruno. Things I never thought I'd see.
United without bruno = 9th  United without VAR = 15th  United without Bruno & VAR = 2nd in the championship
How tf did west ham have more clear cut chances?
I love watching Cavani kiss Bruno’s head.
I see no complaining about ref decisions here since Diagne nearly gouged Lindelof's eyes out... imagine if that was the other way around.
Clearly fouled Lindelöf but still. We should’ve put the game to bed.
Fun fact neither lfc,man city,Chelsea,man utd could beat West Brom
These lot really pray for Bruno to save their skin week in week out 😂
I think Fernandes may just be ... the greatest signing of all time! Like if you agree and comment if you disagree
Manchester is blue!!!!
I fan man u
Great penalty from Bruno that
Harry maguire cost £80 million..let that sink in for a moment
wow
Penandes and Maguire diving to try and cheat West Brom 😂 they’ve been doing it all season so glad the ref didn’t fall for it. Penchester Urinated never fail to make me laugh 😂
until we start playing with consistency, we won't be serious title contenders. hard truth every MU fan has to accept 😔
As a legendary manager once said: Attacks win you games, defences win you titles This is why we won't win the title unless we get a good cb partner for Maguire
Bruno needs to move to a big club. Wasted at Banter FC.
Man United are going to come 4th in a "two club title race"
Bottle jobs again
This league is city's to lose. United just need to accept that and move on...
Let me remind You what you can get with the amount of money Man United Payed for Maguire  You could get one of the best midfielders in the world for 45 million partey You could get a world class St for like 40 million  Or you could just get Halland with all that money
"Bruno's Stunner" - kicks ball with shin🤨🤨
What a Fantastic goal from Bruno !
Lindelof and maguire are a joke
Just can't win without a penalty. Shocking dive and defending from 'captain' maguiire
Ole playing his favourites in Maguire and Lindelof will ultimately cost him his job, if he wants to keep it, play Bailly when he’s fit and available all the way until the summer window opens.
Give Ole a 10 year deal
and people say man united are title contenders.... man united got lucky with that draw the bigger club just wanted play easy against Man United
You spelt shinner wrong in the title. Let's face it OGS can not deal with teams sitting in and defending deep. I don't understand why we don't use Mata for 20 odd minutes. He is a magician who can unlock defences. Wan Bissaka is horrendous going forward, which is fair given he is a right back but we need an out and out right sided winger. Moving Rashford there both destabilised our left side which is our strongest and means we play Martial who is the laziest silkies player I have ever seen play for United. He has had his chance, give it to Greenwood and give him a long run.
Credit to West Brom. Solid performance.
Maguire cheating again.
Fun fact: this is the first time Manchester United has had a var decision go against them since Bruno Fernandes arrived
If Bruno gets injured then united rest in peace
Maguire, Always after a pen or a foul in his favour.
1st goal shouldn't of counted. Lindelof was blinded by the west brom player
Big 2 points dropped for United, city’s title to loose now.
Thank you, West Brom.
Glad utd fucked  it up cant  stand Bruno  and cavani  as well biggest  cheats going
bruno is the goat of the premier league
Title should be West Brom fought for a draw to keep survival alive
No ones going to talk about diagne absolutely destroying lindelof and maguire lmao 😂  🔵⚪️
Bruh, when Man City drew against West Brom in December, United Fans were laughing their heads off cuz it meant they'll go ahead. Look at them now. What goes around comes around.
Man Utd fans got on their high horse for 2 weeks celebrating we are the top of the league trophy. Now they got the reality check they needed
I think Bruno’s back is quite sore from carrying man Utd too much....
Lindelof and Martial are useless
United are never going to achieve anything more than Top 4 with Ole as manager and a spine of Lindelof, Fred and Martial, which is mid table standard.
I feel sorry for Fernandes. Even though he scores bangers regularly people still think he’s a pen merchant.
SURELY THE END OF THE UTD CHALLENGE?
De gea saving maguire as usual
maguire was awful
Rashford needs to be dropped for a few matches having no impact him and martial
Next season we need new refs it’s awful the amount of stupid decisions they make
West Brom were all over you
Absolutely awful, especially when west brom have conceded 50+ goals this season
We’re not winning the league😔
Maguire+Lindelof partnership is horrendous😩
West Brom should have won this. Maguire diving with his fat head pathetic.
City are winning the title
Man U without Fernandes r relegation candidates
People actually thought united were title contenders dpmo 😂😂😂
VARCHESTER UNITED
As a Chelsea fan, I’m absolutely delighted that we’ve got Gallagher, absolute baller
If Man City win their game in hand against Everton on the 17th, City could be 10 points clear of UTD 🤭
Ole really needs to understand lindelof and maguire DOESNT WORK
Want to sleepwalk for 40 minutes then start playing. We got exactly what we deserved. Any little hope of a title we had has now gone with our last 2 draws.
man u are washed up ngl
Liverpool's drop in form started with a 1-1 draw with West brom. Here's hoping the same happens for United
Bs sala got a pen for that so why carnt Maguire
“Its a one sided affair.” - Martin Tyler
Bruno Fernandes FC simple as that
Early
Drew against Arsenal 🙄.Lost against Sheffield United😪. Won against The saints but they were down to 9 men in the end😒. Drew against Everton 😢 and now we've drawn AGAIN!!! against WBA. Someone do the Maths please and let OLE know this isn't the standard required to even be in the chasing pack,let alone win the league. This capitulation of points is embarrassing,and absolute disaster. Well done City 😒
Arsenal V Leeds Predictions I’ll start  3-0 Arsenal Aubameyang brace and bellerin with 1
"He can't take it, I've out-tacticed him!"- Fat Sam
Can't believe Bruno Fc drawed against west Brom
"we've outwitted him he can't take it."
How is there no identification for a midfielder who controls the game for United someone who looks after the ball 🤯
Almost as good as Zidanes in the CL final
Diagne should’ve had a hat-trick
United would be truly fucked if it wasn’t for Fernandes
another day, another shambles game
Can’t believe the red blew the whistle when they were going on the attack
Stones is 100 times better than lindelof.....
Maguire and Lindelof are not United standard!! Period
The table is so deceiving United literally been carried by Bruno since he arrived & United claim “challenge” for the title it’s a one man team
It says enough to beat Albion but they draw
Yes play two cdms against a relegation team. smart ole🤡
Fun Fact: Maguire is the worse centre back in the premier league..
I thought man u won the league when they won 9-0....
Rival fans be like: “He OnLy ScOrEs VoLLeYs”
Bruno lad your back must be shattered
Wheres the hype for 21 is coming gone 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
The commentator said "de gea's in two minds" when it wasnt even his fault for the first goal
stone cold stunner would have been enough tho
Manchester United are nowhere near Manchester City. I predict City will win the league by a 15 point gap.
Utd should have won that match
Another example of poor management from ole.... No idea about tactics I doubt he understands the term attention to detail 👎👎👎simply not ready to win an argument let alone league title.
Bug samm
People talk of Phil Jones but Maguire is absolutely dreadful man! 80 million robbery
Let's be honest utd are 1 Fernandes injury away from relegation
How the hell isn’t  that a foul on lindlof 😂😂
who's in top 6 rn
lindelof and maguire can go to the under 23 with ole..
“Of course it’s Bruno Fernandes”  Carries Man Utd
This may sound harsh, but we have just drew to a team with nothing to play for (already relegated imo) who are worse than Burnley (somehow) and city will now run away with the league (common knowledge)
Congrats city on your league title
Another great penalty from bruno...
United are literally Bruno FC at this point
Shitty CB’s
Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any Premier League highlights this season ► http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub

The more you see it, the less impressive that goal by Bruno seems...
Man United are on the decline they always have 3 months of playing very good they are too inconsistent that’s why they will always be Banter FC. Taking 4 points from the Bottom 3 West Brom deserved the win definitely
Bruno Fernandes Is Just Inevitable.
Manchester United: The only team to score 13 goals in the last 3 games but win only one of those...
How on earth has West Brom draw with both Manchester club, Liverpool and Chelsea
this really is Bruno UTD and the rest
You know it's a bad game when Maguire was our most attacking threat
Hes stolen from you He's stolen Fromm youuu BIG SAM he's stolen from you
That Bruno finish🔥
Lindelof couldn’t mark a toddlers spelling test, “mark goldbrige”
United without Bruno would be a solid midtable club
it’s getting a bit ridiculous now how much bruno carries united
Naaa ahahahahahahahaha
Never gonna win the league with our defence. 😩
The referee had a shocker
MAGUIRE AND LINDERLOF DONT WORK!!!!
West Brom are so weird. Also top 4 is wide open. It could literally be anyone
Who else kept refreshing their page?
Utd fans we have to admit City have the league now 😭
Let’s remove the bias title and re name it  West Brom get much needed point in their fight for survival?
*They made the title sound like West Brom are an unbeatable side XD*
lindelof isn’t good enough for UTD and that’s a fact
I have took shits that are more valuable than Maguire & Lindelof.
Bruno Bruno Bruno
Fun Fact: If chelsea beat Newcastle on Monday they go 4 points away from second this is a crazy season! UCL places are on!
We don’t deserve Bruno
Since when has Fernandes been called Bruno over Fernandes
First
Man utd have been keeping possession all day how have we not won
So basically United crumble when the spot light is on them. what a chance this season was to nip in and take advantage of the league but they’ve fucked it, embarrassing
Rashford genuinely thinks he’s Messi
Rashford needs to go on Loan Like Lingard and them Defenders changed
Bruno’s class
Can’t believe Maguire said it was a penalty in his interview after the game. Man this game is going soft 🤦‍♂️
Well Man Utd’s title challenge was fun while it lasted! 😅
Didn’t know Mané played for West Brom
When will Ole realise that Slabhead and a Mealted Ice Man doesn't work in defence
West Brom and getting draws against mediocre sides from the north west, name a better combination
Say back for there lives
Bruno is overrated
attack wins you games, defence wins u titles
Cities title to lose
Let’s take a minute to laugh at Man U because they could of lost.
McFred is a joke
Bottlejob fc 😂😂
As a Chelsea fan, I’m absolutely delighted that we’ve got Gallagher, absolute baller
Damn as much as I hate it Bruno is more than just pens he's a incredible player
No views and 121 likes makes sense youtube!!!
Bruno is not a playmaker and shouldn't be compared to players like KDB, he's more of a second striker. Doesn't know how to pass.
Liverpool fans (including me): were not so different
This united team were never good enough to win the league...prove me wrong 😑
Ole needs to understand that Lindeloff and Maguire don’t work together. He needs to start Bailey
Not like anyone was expecting this🤣
Fernandes is just a worse Jesse Lingard...
Fernandes has won Utd 46 pts this season
Congrats to city on winning the league
United can’t rely on bad calls in this game
Wonder strike my arse
With all due respect, United fans should have fully seen this coming and they completely deserve it
Shocking loss we needed them 3 points
our centre back pairing will be the death of me i swear to God
Still ole is the best 👑👑
