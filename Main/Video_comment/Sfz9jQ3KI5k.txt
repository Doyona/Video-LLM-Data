Раньше не понимал фразу: "Он легенда - ему можно." Сейчас понимаю =)
I love that Kyle being in his underwear implies that Jack just was wearing that under his clothes 😂
Ewidetnie mentalność typowego Jana Czarnego ;-)
Don't miss next time

underlying this ...Jack's voice, and everyone else's AMAZING comments....the LOVE AND RESPECT THESE TWO GREAT ARTISTS HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER.....
Why was I not notified of this???🤨
There's a whole song left to sing why cut it so short jack?

Ils chantent super bien franchement
Нираз замечал, что именно в этой песне Джек торопится! Надеюсь вы поняли о чем я😅 на х0.95 звучит офигенно!

I learned happiness from this is real.
It's the best day of their lives.
It's beautiful.
There's a shark you better run.
Now I've seen it all.
You don't have to do the ocean deeply...you can shallow hal the ocean...its okay.
Is Wicked original singer from Boston?
I love the ocean this much too.
What's the D stand for?
Did you know Jack Black was a band?
is that a hernia flopping around in Kage's shorts or is he packing serious heat?
<3<3<3
어르신들 오래오래 건강하고 행복하게 사세요
What a wicked game to play….to make me feel this way…..what a wicked thing to say…..that there may not be anymore D today…..
Shit 😂
We all need more of that kind of time with each other ❤
I was a flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will yes
jack black and rye magic game song

Jack sold out Kyle.  Fuck him.
What a feel good video with a sad song!
Wish they would finish the cover
Just beautyfull
They make the world a better place to live in.
I love how jack looks genuinely happy to just be hanging out with kyle in this music video
Still the best
На этих мужчин НУЖНО смотреть. Избавляет от тревоги и восстанавливает потенцию.
Love IT
Dam bro this guy got all the talent from the last 5generations passed down all to one guy who worked his Ass off and pull this off!!!
So cool see the jack black and Kyle Gass have fun
The greatest bro-emotion you can ever get. 🥰
Horrible! He's trying to cover up his lack of talent trying to be funny but failing at both.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you 💔
I wished the same thing on my birthday. Come back.
Please come back 😭 some music festival appearances would be amazing. Please come to bonaroo and give the greatest live show of all live shows in human history 🤘🤘😮
He obviously had the POD when he sang this song.
I,m from Germany. 72 born and you two make Music i love. Our Bodies the same. But you are the Models under us. I love you two Guys and i love you Music. Greets from a old Man rocker Man in Deutschland. ❤❤❤

WOW WOW WOW!!! F'ING WOW!
De cómo una versión tan cojonuda se vuelve magistral viendo sus pares de  ‘bolsas de magdalenas’ botar al ritmo que ambos corren across de water. Geniales 😂
❤
if brutal legend 2 comes any time in the future this is a must be
2 years ago in radio they've said, that you cannot unsee this video. This is accurate.
Omg! Hahaha hahahaha
kyle gas is packing some heat in those briefs

I love you guys with all my heart

C'est une pépite encore 😂
RIGOLE 😂😂😂😂😂😂💯
EXCELLENT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahahahha 😂
Found this a couple months ago right after a 20+ year breakup. Never truer word sung. It’s a daily listen. Nobody loves No One. Sucks at 60.
lindo
Sometimes, the truth is ugly and Kyle was right. Period.
Beautiful.
BabeWatch at it's finest!!! ❤️💯 this made my day. ☺️
If everyone have some of Jack Black in their souls there wouldn't be evil in our worlds.
Why I can see Bowser singing this 🤣🤣🤣
I FU*NG LOVE THEM!!!!!
Such beautiful music with such an eyesore hahahahah
I LOVE you jack
Это самое прекрасное видео, которое я видел в своей жизни!
🤪🤪🤪🤪
saw ur ass in chitown good times brother!
acreditem ou não, mas cai em lágrimas assistindo esse vídeo. AKAKAK  perdi meu melhor amigo tempos atrás, onde nos identificamos muito com estes dois, como irmãos. Mesmo já tendo passado bom tempo, todas noites eu sinto ele comigo, obrigado por representarem em meu coração a melhor banda de todas ❤
This is what 🟠 took from us
Why gringos are that fat?  take care guys, and keep music flowing...
When u and your bestie spawn the first hour in a fresh Rust wipe
The greatest thing on the internet!
Jack and Kyle like two parts of one puzle  Lucky man's
Love them both so much.
Theres gotta be a full version right?
I don't remember this episode of baywatch
I love how the video itself is just middleaged potbelly men with golden retriever energy running through the waves and having fun, nothing over the top, no dancing or transitions or anything like that, just the purity of two good friends having fun, love it.
🔥🤘🤌
legendary
Fr we need yall back.
Santa Claus and his gay lover on holiday. What a well deserved respite, old chum.
No se puede tener mas arte, talento, personalidad y sobre todo humor. Simplemente genial. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
We need more of this before this man and his legendary voice before they snuff it. Perfect way to do it is tooo...... make Brutal Legend 2 already goddammit. ahaa
Hell yeah... Defs need a longer version of this 😢
Fuck yeah
So sehe ich mich mit meinem Bro in ein Paar Jahren 😘
Chops
Another year gone.. pleeeeease make a full version ❤
Wish this song was another 5 mins longer, absolutely love this song, so simple and so perfect.
Goats..
Godamn this is good
Love story ❤️
The beautiful rendition of this great song is in stark contrast to these two lumbering about, tackle swinging. ❤
Thank you.
1 year later. I WISH KYLES BIRTHDAY WISH HAD COME TRUE.   Jack betrayed America. Kyle is An American Hero!

This reminds me of hanging out with my uncle and his friend at our bbqs. Good times. You guys tear it up.🍆

GUYS, WE NEED YOU BACK!!!
Better than the original. I love it
Man, this voice… this song… love you guys
they seem so free lmao
What a wicked game to play, to give us only 1:50 mins of this 😢
Um ator e um  cantor natos e shows
I like to think that when I die, that's how I'll find my father waiting for me, just as joyful and full of laughter as we always were together.
I love U @Joeblack🫀💯⚘️🤟🏻😘
Thing is. If you played that live, people would actually party like that
This is the worst thing on the internet
that little proposital voice crack give me goosebumps
Tds idiots.
We, The good people of this world, demand a full cover of this song by Tenacious D. We do not deserve it, let's be honest but come on... please? 😢
Ok so hear me out, i love your movies jack, but dude you shoulve been a singer for real dude, youre a freakin monster! You have an insane voice! I love it brotha! This is awesome!
This was real. I loved it, i felt something. Humanity
Nice ode to complex carbohydrates.
Jack Black Training for Rocky VI
Come on guys , where is the album of covers that fucking send us to the stars ?
Wicked game intro
Looking so sexy ❤
This video is the pinnacle of the internet
majestic creatures
Uma das pessoas mais talentosas do ramo. Sabe tocar, cantar, atuar, é engraçada e ilumina qualquer ambiente. Estou morrendo de rir enquanto escrevo isto.
JAJAJAJAJAJa!!! buen tema !!! solo eso diré jajajajaj
where's the bendy?   You gotta put a bendy in every once in a while.
A voice so fuckin powerful one might say he needs no microphone. It Blows my mind.
Everybody talkin bout JB but how bout we recognize that Tenacious D floppin around in KGs jockeys.
kyle hiding the shrinkage
Never underestimate the power of LSD......! ;-)
I fucking love Jack Black!!!!!!!
Awesome!!! Rock!!!!
put that in 2x xD hahahahahhahahahah
The Rage Cage is packing some heat
And next to the wonderful sense of humor. It's really beautiful, the guitar, the singing ❤
Me pregunto qué se sentirá estar casada con Jack Black xD
best video in 2025, 2025, 2026....
❤❤❤❤❤❤🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
This is perverse
马里奥和路易？
This is just a tribute
And the peculiar thing is this my friend, the song we sang that fateful night, it didn’t actually sound anything like this song!!!!
This is not the greatest song in the world, no. This is just a tribute. I remember the greatest song in the world, no no, this is is a tribute. To the greatest song in the world! It was the greatest song in the world!
There’s no way you separate forever. nobody loves, loves no one. But jack and Kyle were more than that. Politics aside. That’s your brother is forever. A little political difference doesn’t mean the end of an era, you know Kyle and you love him. Don’t pretend otherwise, y’all been hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road. Look  at each other (we said o.k.) and bring it. It was destiny.   “Be you angels?”  Nah ye are but men.. ROCK
Performance Perfection
I don't even hate this song anymore...
This hurts
KG is carrying a different pack than JB man.
Where is the rare saxofon?
Sublime with headphones/earbuds 😊
What a wicked thing to see........
A funny Version 😀 I love it 😀
xD I love JB haha
May,'25!?
Petition to cover the full song
Cant get past him singing  wit chew
What real Minecraft Lore vid?!? HOLY
Need a longer version as this is one of the best songs of all time and this version but these two,especially Jack
Long live The D!!!
I REMEMBER seeing a mario and luigi version of this but with the Chris Isaak - Wicked game song.
Jack Black voice is just hypnotizing 😩❤‍🔥🤧
los amo Espero verlos en Uruguay algun dia salgamos a pesear
Purer Sex
I hope Jack watches this and cries each night for the way he treated KG
Long live the D
Best thing I have ever seen ❤
2025
Best friends until the end….
I was very sad today. I miss my father who passed away. I put a gun in my mouth several times and thought about ending this. But I wasn't man enough. But then out of nowhere I watched this video. I laughed... I didn't understand what the objective was... I love you both. Tenacius D is the most badass band in this universe.
Two gods!
CAN WE HAVE A FULL COVER OF IT, PLEASE?!!!!!!!!!
Hey man why did you only do one verse one chorus?!. So you did mean to make just a joke alright? Pitty, JB has beautiful voice and I would be happy to hear him the whole song
Sexy is about voice, not about body😂😂😂😂😂
was the video idea a story about two giants with huge domains on both sides of an ocean (the sea was their common playground?)
this is what we all wanted  to see jack black and kyle gass  in underwear /100
The lyrics and sound is so sad and beautiful that you are only able to get along with the pure joy of the video ❤
JACK !!!  Phucing BLACK   🔥
I wonder whats the lore of this, and what happens after the demon's soul possesses him
OK.....that was just weird.
I want friends like that .
I love you guys
Here after minecraft movie
Wait is this a cover of wicked game by HIM
This is absolutely INSANE!!!
laughing with warmth in the heart.
Bellissima canzone e loro sono fantastici ❤❤❤❤
This is how peak male performance looks like
Bummed they didn't cover the whole song!
I thought this was a perfume commercial.
This man is one of my all time favorite singers. His vocals are so insane it baffles me.
LONG LIVE THE D!
Hahaha happies brothers
the bulge is huge
art
You guys are awesome
Hey pal my eyes are up here
This is not the greatest song in the world, no This is just a tribute
You love what I'm doing. Not who I am and how I function. Did you love my voice or the message redelivered from past lyrics? Think about it for the younger viewers.
Not impressed
era necesario un video asi ajajajsjs s
I cannot be mad at all when it opens with two almost naked fat guys running on a beach, I know this is gonna be good
Blubber Quakes!
Extraño esta amistad.
I need to put this as my morning alarm
Never thought I'd be hypthonized by looking at 2 middle aged men playing in water in a non-erotic way.
They are so agile and graceful
Man i just love you ❤ nothing Else to say ❤❤❤
I hope they live forever.
It's freak to hear Bowser singing Wicked Game😂
RIP to the D
My Spiritual Brothers, Tenacious, and Deadly.
Lmao
Falling in love is the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced and I had stage 3 cancer
Me and my Mate recently went to a concert in Dublin I live in Ireland for 20 years but it was an experience beyond description. We are originally from Poland I remember when we had nothing and we watched them on an old CRT TV. We are now young grandparents like them. A wonderful experience. We went back for a moment to memories of our youth. Great concert I wish you a lot of health and I hope to see you live in the future
They have sure gained a lot of weight😢
So this is what final stage TDS looks like.  What an epic fall from greatness from Jack..who is this gay lover of his?
Absolutely beautiful ❤
Я такой же атлет)
LOVE YOU GUYS
I cri ebritiem
Inspierd by ....https://youtu.be/3s_ksetSS_Q?si=pedAFKcRI9Uzwawn
Damn near perfect acoustic guitar and an incredible vocal range and inflection to go with it. Need an entire album of these please
🙏💖🥰
Getting your song covered by THE tenacious d has to be one of if not the biggest achievement you can EVER receive in the music industry 😂
The real hero here is the person that recorded it
I am watching 2 fat & old man running! Just because it is TenaciousD.
Perfect mixture of deep emotion , and never taking yourself seriously ❤ hope to see ya'll back
AIM BETTER ❤
I dream this video every night for decades and then it happened
First You Need to Cross Of Bridge Then You Need to Cross Of Sand Hills And Finally You're Going to Get To the Beach
must maintain eye contact. must maintain eye contact. must maintain eye contact. *eye straining*
2024?
A year later and boy, the mighty have fallen just a few simple words out of Kyle‘s mouth destroyed Tenacious D forever. It truly is a shame.
Rip
I need a full cover, even if it’s just the guitar
Duuuudes! 🤩
"Friends will be friends, they're running naked in the sand"
Just the vocals are awsome .... But the video .... That's just next level
Great
The wicked game is the fact its not even 2 mins. Full version. This is what we NEED.
Nobody loves no one More like Nobody loves you Ha ha ha funny joke
Still can't believe they didn't release the whole version, jack's voice is something else 🙏🏻🔥
Can we please hear the entire song???
I Love this Guy
ПАЦАНЫ
Is Kyle stuffing or packin lmao
You may see two fat men jumping in the water, but I see two friends who traveled a long road and composed magnificent songs and embellished it with a very fun and unique humor.
The song is kinda reminds me of Baywatch
Thats what i call living! Truly fun moments in life!
dear Tenancious D can i make a cover remix of this beautiful song?
I always thought the original lyrics were great but the vocal was too polished to really enjoy it. Too clean somehow. A bit lacking in the emotion. This one makes up for it
2 beards 2 bellies Strong men friendship Forever
This song hits so fucking different now
brrrrrrrr
So, they made the greatest song in the world and now they've the greatest video in the world. What's next?
This song feels different these days.
What wicked thing to say, to wish the death of a president. Rock on TDS, rock on.
Im watching the video but my mind is floating on a beautiful cloud of lyrics and strumming.  Also, major appreciation for how ripped they would be if they did a cut. Those dudes are muscle houses with some padding for warmth.
The guitar playing skillz are off tha hook Mr. Black
What a wicked thing. *Sigh*
Just two straight dudes enjoying some gay fun 🎉 I approve this message
I listened to this song so many times a year ago and it brought a smile to my face each time..  Now I'm just sad.  [Edit] Looks like they are back together??? Sadness no more!
esse vídeo parece que foi feito por IA
Never gets old! So awesome!
Where is the fire truck?
you may not like it but that is peak human form there.
The thing I love most about Jack Blacks singing - is how he somehow manages to add those tiny bits of projected humour, yet sing with such an outstanding voice. P.S. If you've ever listened to Baby from the Pick of Destiny Soundtrack, you'll know exactly what I mean.  ; )))
jack black omfg that voice!!!!
your the best band in the wolrd!!!! facking love you guys sooomuch.......<3
So profoundly sexy to me.
Awesome ai
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I literally cannot tell when he goes from falsetto back to his normal voice. What the fffffff that’s incredible.
only jack black could do what i just watched and make it totally cool and somehow totally understood
Sooooo sexy
So gay!
You know, I think I am done with you boys. You turned out to be shitty humans.
What a fantastic voice! Gives me goose bumps.
if  jack was not a successful actor/ musician he could have worked for the WWE....
Yes, I have 50 years left until retirement. wish you success
This is why they can't be together....na+h2o....these guys are crazy 😂....had to edit this ....they are the best 😊
I can't believe I just watched this
This is already a crime LoL

Unique ❤️‍🔥🤟🏻
Next time they aim.. i hope they don't miss..
Great cover! No judgement. I support you, regardless of your swimwear choices ❤😅
These guys are amazing!

29 de dezembro de 2024 e eu aqui vendo essa obra
GIVE US THE FULL COVER PLEEEEEEEEEASE
Oh my… what a BEAUTIFUL version… 🎉 Mr Black 💋
Love the cover but I'm never going to be able to unsee that white bathing suit.
This is why we need too keep our beaches cleaner!
Fkn EPIC 🤘🏼🎸
I could’ve more easily just listened to this on Spotify, but for some reason here I am again
This vision exudes a canine joy, like clever golden retrievers dancing freely on the shore, intoxicated by the salty breeze.
Conn quelle pance normale.xhe non hanno freddo. Complimenti per la musica
I finally got to see him in concert 2yrs ago, bucket list moment.
Too weird to live and too rare to die... 🥳
I don't know how I am just now finding out about this masterpiece,  but it was needed. The video is perfect
Come back Jack , Don't be a diq .... no reason for all this
This song is so good singed by you !! I wish it was longer
Bruh thanks a lot fellas. Now I’m literally rock hard after watching this
Jack is the music lecturer for the School of Rock
eternity cannot touch ten million hearts But Jack Black can do it in one minute and 49 seconds
Lol, you SOB, I hate/love that you still brought a friggin tear (or two) to my eye. P.S. Didn't actually watch the vid, only got the audio pleasure only, thank you.
wish they would actually make the entire song for us to listen to
Beautiful guys!!
Best voice :) i love it :)
juste wow  la voix puissante de jack black
I love jack Black's voice so much! It makes my heart strings ring!
The temu version of Linkin Park

To jest Przyjaźń, którą chciałbym kiedyś mieć 😊
The first song I learned
Love it! ❤
That me and best mate Colin when were retired 😂😂
I love Jack!
mögen alle götter der welt euch noch lange leben lassen ♥ ♠
The time of their lives.... Have fun Jack and Kyle.
"Wit chew" 😂
What has been seen can no longer be unseen😵‍💫
Pair of fine specimens
Esse cara é uma aula de canto viva
Your talent & intelligence would have me picking my jaw off the ground BUT i won't let your spell ✨ interrupt me....beautifuLL
i love this guy
Tô começando a ficar desse jeito 😅
What a gracefully beautiful moment. The ballad accompanying a gracefully awkward dance in the ocean makes me want to do the same thing minus the police and people.....
i saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw di saw d i saw d
damn kyle is packinggg
Brilliant video about a great and brave hero of England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Whose coming back to this in 2024 knowing the situation with them now? Is tragic what's happened
Jack breaking the wave for Kage😢
My question is are they both on shrooms? Because they both look to be having fun beyond imagine. Great friendship, great cover, hilarious jog along the beach!!!
Лох полный. Втащил в крысу, но сделал это неумело и слабо. Пиджак бы его сделал в одни ворота, жаль растащили. По факту ему бы сломали ребра
Love the swinging ball sacks
We need more modern day Tenacious D music
Wait until you guys hear about Michael Jackson lol. It is wild to me that people can't separate music from the artists. Don't deprive yourself of something you love over politics
Top
I don't want to live in a world absent of these two magical creatures. I mean I'd do it, but it'd suck balls pretty bad.
Hi Jack and Kyle… I hope next time THAT I DO MISS YOU! I’ll never watch or listen to anything you ever have or will produce due to your extreme political views and openness to political violence.
Greetings from SUOMI-Finland! 🤘
I hope you get canceled
The D means Tenacious DONE. 😂 Good Riddance weirdos
I'm going to do the appropriate punk rock thing and use my Pick of Destiny to scratch my taint because that's how much I respect you now, don't give a crap what your political views are you have a ride to your business but when you start doing that crazy Kathy Griffin nonsense you're not an American anymore, I was a fan of you guys since your HBO show and a fan of Jack specifically since that rollerblading movie he did with Seth Green back when they were both no bodies, turns out Jack is still a nobody
Two fat kweers running on the beach.
THIS BAND IS PATHETIC , TRUMP FOREVER,
Two old fat guys that could clog up a toilet and sewer system with one dump.....give it up retire already
Pricks of Destiny.
Rip TD
THat's it? No cuddling scene?
Tenacious D! ❤
What a wicked thing to say. The way you spread hate.
I suppose we're supposed to laugh at two morbidly obese guys running along a beach to a Chris Isaak song.  Okay, thanks!
Just two morbidly obese lover frolicking
Hermoso saludos desde chile ❤ la mejor banda de rock 🎸
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
I used to really like you guys. For real, now...nope.
I see that carbo hydrates did NOT miss these guys... Rest in obscurity.
You guys suck now. I'll be listening to Cory Taylor's version from now on.
You might not like it, but this is what peak male physical form looks like
Remember the great times and don't let one comment change that!
Two assholes!
🤮
Hollywood 🌈
Over the years you have brought millions of people together through laughter and amazing music. It seems the only "comedy" allowed these days is that which glorifies the murder of political opponents. Likely half of your fans are conservative and also love freedom of speech with edgy comedy. Not only are you ok with alienating half of your fans (the people that gave you the lifestyle you have) but you're also ok with glorification of murder. The company you keep brothers, the company you keep.  You guys have always had the power through laughter and love to calm tensions at any moment but you chose the low road this time. Stay safe and enjoy life with maybe a little introspection one day.
This has Epstein island vibes.
Your deleted of my best music library for the D.Trump comment . I was a fan  Not anymore bye bye
You look like two egomaniacs to me now. Cant belive i was ever a fan to begin with. Atrocious behavior!
A couple of gay fat dudes wth is this garbage!

Gravity has hit these boys hard😂 great cover
talent is exactly what we're seing here...being able to do something where anyone would be ridiculous in it and creating a masterpiece...tik Tok is the exact opposite .
Sounding a bit like Zack Wylde there. They should duet.
This is insanely good! What a beautiful friendship !!Absolutely brilliant🎉
Biden?
I’m so glad Jack Black exists.
No way 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[Verse] What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you  [Chorus] And I don't wanna fall in love No, I don't
This is one of the most hilarious things that the human mind has ever created, and most likely ever will create.
this is Love
Thank you. I really needed that.
This brings me back to HIM's Uneasy listning album ...
Just a couple of older gentlemen, running on the beach in their skivvies. Genius.
They could do more than just Comedy Music. Jack Black is an amazing singer and Kyle Gass is an amazing guitarist. They could cover many songs
Love ya jack black❤❤
Has to be a 2 pack of Wilson socks down there 😂😂
какие веселые скуфы)
Best fucking video ever 😂
잭 블랙 형님 건강하게 우리 곁에서 웃음을 주세요~뱃살마저 매력이신 분이지만 건강에는 좋지 않답니다ㅜㅜ
True Friendship like kyle & JB <3
This is so funny and human and good❤.
Не знала, что он так поёт ❤❤❤
It's nice to see Jack takes KG out for walks sometimes.
Shrooms on the beach with my brother. One of the best days I ever lived 😂
Majestic
Beached whales you say? Not so fast!
Sounds good.
🤟🤘✌️❤️❤️❤️!!!
Love y’all!
I was the cameraman ;). cheekbones dont lie. Great tribute to a great song
Kyle is packing major heat
I need a guitar coz of this song, thank you Jack <3
Jack Black is a National Treasure.
Alls I sees is heart attacks and diabetes.
It really is hard to take them seriously as they are so funny but they are a brilliant band, Jacks Voice fits this song perfectly in my opinion
Теперь хочется, что они сделали кавер на всю песню
Such grace, such poise...
I miss cool Jack Black.
Bowser be jammin-
Sad about the Biden endorsement, but how can you not love this man
Biden 2024
спасибо мужики я рад что знаком с вашим творчеством ! примерно так мой отдых проходит с другом на море =))) собаки мопса только не хватает
I liked you more before you got political....
When Manatees play
It’s amazing! Boom&Love after you… clear
I honestly don’t know why I had!’t already subscribed to this channel. 🤗🤗🤗
I am laughing hard of the music video, but they are nailing this song so hard it is beautiful!
Šlechta podsvětí 😂😂😂  More, kde je zase můj komentář!? Ty mafiane!?
This video was part of helping me overcome my thalassophobia. These men are healers!
This gives a whole new meaning to Santa's sack. 😮😂
The shoot was dangerous.
If the camera on this was steady, it would be terrible.  The shaking camera makes it great.
marvelous
Bringing back nostalgic memories of me and my little bro listening to tenacious d 20 odd years ago.. Jack's a 🐐
❤❤❤✨🫀🌼
Headshot…
If you don't like Jack Black you're mentally ill.
Fuck I love you guys!
Such Garbage, but what do you expect from a Communist.
Funniest thing I've seen today. Thank you.
I rock with this
Why did you go political!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We seriously need a full covers album from these guys. They're incredible and always have been
Love ❤
Way to ruin a great song guys…
raise your hand if you would buy a Tenacious D album of just cover songs.
Trouver l'amour. Le seul vrai sens de la vie!
wowoewewah
What model of the guitar in it Song?
Am I the only one unironically in love with this song? I love JB...and Kyle Gass...and just music in general, and I god damn love this
Man has perfect pitch
“Witchu” - what makes it Tenacious
На отдыхе со своей бородатой бабой 😂
someone can tell me why Jack not in g-string extreme swimsuite?
Ooops ! He did it again…. People you are amazing ❤😂😂
Ciao
I’ve heard that Trent Reznor mourned the loss of Hurt when he heard Johnny Cash sing it. He knew it was no longer his song. Chris Issac probably feels the same way after hearing Jack Black.
Smily, fellows, but , please, don`t get to the rainbow side ;)
Який класний комбідрес!)
I didn't know he sang to give me goosebumps.
Waiting for the black sand to be all over his face and body
That's real men right there. Let those tummys frolic!
Mr Jack black proving once again that he does actually have an amazing voice.
wtf
You know  I can't unsee that right?
Это жоско
Art
This is frickin awesome!
что в мешках?!
soooo when are you making a longer version? :P
TF I just watch.
✨IT'S BEAUTIFUL🤘
I would let Jack Black watch my drink
Stop edging. Do the whole song.
Guys, thank you for this song. It is a gift to the world. Keep making music for as long as you can, I will always be there listening.
Chris issac. Fuxxing classic bro and wicked genius.
Hugs ❤❤❤
where is the full 😭😭😍❤️💕
Lmao 🤣
Стебалово 5 балов...
What if…  I love tenacious D, but what if he took his singing talent seriously
I hope I can find the Kyle to my Jack one day. This is such a beautiful friendship.   I love these men.
Till waiting Tenacius D 2 .... come on guys!
😂think of THE KIDS jack lmfao, crazy old men. Terrifying but hilarious as usual.
I love you guys but YUCK!
Jack es clavado a mi marido 😂😂😂😂parecen hermanos, ❤ me hace gracia cuando lo veo
Magnificent Gentlemen Absolutely  Magnificent
These two are friendship goals. I loooove them.
KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Knuckleheads
❤❤❤❤❤❤ eu amo tanto esses dois 💞
First i thought it was Rocky and apollo... Then....
Бля это коры😂😂😂 какие же они ахуенные тролли))
My parents caught me watching this. I kept watching it and faced the consequences.
Just amazing. I’m watching School of Rock today!
Это де его сын? Верно?

A video to sum peak music and peak human form
Is that Jack Black?
I can never unsee that.
PLEASE give US the whole song🙏💜
а что в мешочке?
Love these two
As good as original ❤
🫶⭐️
Omg. 😂😂
god love these two
What a shame it's a federal crime to pet these majestic sea creatures.🥲
Would be good to see them lose some weight. Not for looks, just for health. Don't want thee dudes to croak anytime soon...such talent.
They did an acoustic cover of Theory of a Deadman’s version - Bravo
Love it, no fucks given, two fat blokes just pissing around. But they have incredible talent. Legends
I’m sorry but he’s too old to still act this way. Used to be a huge fan but watching him act like a toddler is just uncomfortable
These guys are national treasures.  Watching them is pure joy.
love you brothers
Убрать -30 кг и было бы гораздо лучше и не так отвратно.У мужчин бывант 3 степени ожирения: 1) когда не видно как член висит, 2) когда не видно как стоит, 3) когда не видно кто сосет..Удачи друзья.Надеюсь они не гей-пара?
Peak male performance, you may not like it
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jack should have an Oscar for School of Rock!
O my gawd 😂😂😂
Jack Black's vocal chops MUST be include in the discussion of the all-time rock/pop greats.
You look like puppies!
this made me cry so hard no words can be placed here !
😎😎😎🤟🤟🤟🤟👍👍👍👍
Что за горбатая гора
La pure joie de vivre💖
Thank you! This video is beautiful and your voice is beautiful. I love your voice. Many thanks again.
Any time I'm feeling down and crappy, I watch something funny from jack  always makes me laugh!
TD combination of absurd visuals and thrillingly great music is a novel artform in of itself
Just saw 2 videos and had to subscribe, dafuq is this voice xD plz give us more
Do the whole song... The original is 4:50 long
This is one of my favorite songs and I really wish they would have done the whole song.
Did I need this in my life? Yes. Did I KNOW I needed this in my life? No.  No lesson, just an observation
What I wouldnt give for them to release the full version of this.  Better yet, an album with covers like these?
Gotta Salute My dudes Riht Durr... HAHAHAHAHHA GYEAH       WICKED GYAYME DEM a PLAY NOW BWOY
Yall ain't right!!❤
J Balls one of the greatest ... and Kyle too of course ❤
You cant kill the Metal !
i can't unsee that.  awful
They can't make a full video, because no body loves no one
🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
😂
Я его обожаю❤❤❤❤🤷
Когда моя жена зашла ко мне в комнату ночью, я смотрел этот клип. Было очень сложно объяснить ей, что это просто такой клип
Я считаю что это видео под эту музыку - ответ на вопрос - зачем человек живет и вот вам верный ответ. Браво тинешс ди!!! Браво!!! Гениально!!! Я в восторге!!!
Hypnotic
Mario and Luigi grown up
Want this swimsuit more than Borat swimsuit
Wonderful voice
What a nice girl!
Are they a gay couple ?
Просто гениально Маэстро
When your boy hasn't been online to play with you and you start reminiscing over the times you shared together....it's been a long time since I've seen you my friend 🤣🤣
Best clip of the history aahhahahahahahaha
I wish there was 4K
Tenacious D.... please please please do a cover version. of Green Jelly's "Three Little Pigs"
не знала что у этого актера хороший голос
i miss being this happy
This makes me happy
What a fffffff😂😂😂😂
🥵 🔥🔥🔥
мои мальчики
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i like to think that during the recording of the song jables just randomly said "hey wanna go to the beach" and so they did this instead of doing a full cover of the song
emozionante
that singlet needed to be shorter
❤ i just love those guys!!!
Just unliked this video so I could like it again 😊
My new favorite song. I'm sure of it 😀
Ляяяяя Какой Голос,кто скажет что таких Много Скажу Нихуа,Настольгируйте пока есть миг!
😂😂😂😂😂
Wait… is this Jack Black and are you telling me he makes music????🫨
Jack, you are the boss of that unitard!   This song is so good from tenacious D ⭐️ thank you
Appreciation for being a clown and at the same time, giving justice to this awesome song!
That is how Happiness looks like!)😅
Love!❣
My favorite band, the Motherfuckin' D, covering my favorite "guilty pleasure" song, and being absolutely WAY too adorable for words while absolutely KILLIN it? MMMnyehhh. check pleaaaaze!  I can't lie: Jables has always my most adored demiurge, and m'dude Rage Kage? Well, THAT sweet, precious man is my absolute spirit animal. I just... I just love him SO MUCH that it's been called "unhealthy" more times... well, more times than I care to admit. Regardless, though: can Kyle be my dad?   Uh oh, holy shit guys. HOLY SHIT: is this... did I die? Am I dead now? Frankly, I SURE FUCKING HOPE SO, because this is exactly what I've always, desperately hoped and prayed that heaven would be like.  Godspeed, you Sacred Sonic Cock-smiths of Divine Destiny... GODSPEED.
Jack, you and your buddy, need to lose those stomach's, it's a heart attack waiting to happen. Trust me......
The sexiest Music Video ive ever Seen 😉❤️
We must protect these fella's at all cost.
This guy really sux.... not funny at all!
Great cover!
This hits me ❤ Since hearing it the first time, I listen to nearly every day

This is simultaneously hilarious and oddly beautiful.
Gross
How is it possible to be like them? This energy has been great for many years... It's so depressing for a normal human. These guys are overall awesome.
They are lovers... I see it now.. it all makes sense gross.
Damn .I wish they’d sing the whole song. Love Jables voice ..
We're almost at the 1 year (ago) mark. Please release a full version (on the first of June?)! I'd pay money for that.
I am instantly inspired to take my dad on a cruise and find some laughter before hes to old to enjoy it........ Jack, you probably get this all the time but, thank you for your unselfish warmth of just being human. Thank you.
ONLY A MAN.......can glory in his disgusting essence & make it something to praise to HEAVEN!!!
Ok that’s the best thing I’ve seen this year. .
where is the guy with the lyrics? 🥺
Love it all.
God damn! So fuckin good
This is the first time i can type something like wow look at the quality of the music this is totally y im watching this video and its not cuz of how skimpy their outfits are and mean it.
hilarious
Jack tanks the wave like a motherfluffin boss!
This is what I have with my school friends and I'm 42.  Rock on guys, rock on.
1000x better than the original !
Ребята, вы восхитительны. Видно, что из вас исходит какая-то супер сила рока. Спасибо за ваш труд и отличное чувство юмора.
how people be happy
❤❤❤❤😅😂😂😂
"not a huge known giver of f*cks" lol
When a demon gets you hot in the middle of the road— nothing stands forever in front of poetic justice.
Как это развидеть?…

Обожаю эту песню. А в исполнении Джэка - это просто бомба!!!
lord knows i threw a cold one
😂😂😂
coulda been a solid musician if he would give up the silliness
Jack Black is our new Betty White.  We miss Betty , but we need Jack ❤
The juxtaposition of video to audio  🤌🤌🤌
I need to tuck this away somewhere for when I am having a bad day
The way jack black’s voice shifts is so beautiful
Hahaha hilarious 😂 the original wicked game video was so good though.
2 boys are playing  through the waves

Please, put at the link, the source of the swimsuits
lol. I love this song, but when I saw Tenacious D  and Wicked Game and the Beach, I could not resist! I am surprised and not surprised how much I love this. I absolutely love the pure joy in contrast to Chris's video and the tonal range of Jack's voice. Tee hee, I giggle. Well done Jack!
I look down and the take one look and say”dang, Jack black is hung”
I love this ❤
Awesome!
LOL
Michael Eavis has let himself go
Who ate all the pies?
Une émotion … incroyable… ! ❤️
Waouh … cette voix !!
He can sing indeed
Life is beautiful.
Said last time to my girlfriend, that here's an angel singing... she looks at the video... "You mean those old ugly guys in their underwear?" Philistine...
Jack really does have a fantastic voice!
This is a great rendition..goodness me! I wasn't watching video at all..
I would love to see Chris Isaac's comments on this!
I can't keep my eyes off them and keep looking down.  I think in hope that something might come out.  I've learnt a lot about myself today, and yet it has generated in me many questions.
Little child inside u 😂😍
красавчики )
jajajajajaj🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This isn't a song. It's a hymn in it's own belief.
Dudes, put down the doughnuts.
este video es felicidad pura...gracias!!!..me alegraron el dia
Buddies!   Love it.
What an amazing sight to see in there natural habitat...Unicorns frolicking in the ocean.
Fucking why so short, when the golden tunes continue inside my ears 🤘
Kyle Gas is a seriously beautiful guitarist ❤
This has me wishing my father took me to the beach or i at least had a best friend to go to the beach with.
Jables and KG singing this has to be the most beautiful, amazing, incredible cover I've ever heard.... absolutely breathtaking.  Please please please record and release the full song.  I don't think I've heard anything as haunting 😭😍🤯  I think music has just peaked right here for me, RIP.
I'm not crying, you are crying.
Thank you for advertising these bodies some of us ladies drool over. This is sexy to some of us. I'm tired of being criticized because of my likes .
That’s a lot of meatball subs!
better than the OG, unsurprisingly! ❤
LOVE You So Much ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is enchanting and hilarious at the same time! Once day I will get to meet Jack Black!
Jack black can't fail musically
Джек Блек тут конечно кринжовый но 9,2 миллионов говорят о другом...)))

🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️
O mais engraçado é os enchimentos kkkkkkkk

Que visão do inferno, cruzes 😂😂😂
Except for the mankini 😂😊😊.  PS I'd like to see you get Chris Isaak into a mankini running along the surf. He'd REALLY deserve that!  Whereas you two, as far as I know, are innocent boys. 😂
Know its supposed to be funny...but i got chills &:even cried! Such a beautiful voice & the joy in this video-too much❤
Wicked gains…
This seems like my A.I. generated nightmares lol

I really wish you would do full songs Mr Black
ok this is amazing and all and i love jables in all his glory...  but i cant get the tag "objects may be larger than they appear" out of my head when i watch this
Imagine seeing these 2 idiots at the beach. Golden
BFF 🌈
I find them and their complete abandonment and lack of giving a shite so endearing... xxxxxx. I'm off to Manchester where, hopefully, I can get a ticket
out of all people in hollywood, these are the ones that have stood strong. I dont think youse get how special that is.
Ficou bonita cantada por ele👏👏🎶❤️
I like that they are having fun in the video
Como me encanta este hombre ❤
A majestic frolic between two close friends
They are beautiful 😊
привет из россии. я такой же, и надеюсь в старости буду таим же.

Most expensive Video Clip ever
Majestic AF
Dam that was Sexier than hell! I have to go change my undees. Thanks guys your the best. Seriously though you fuckin Rock!!!🤟🤙🤘
They say that you are your own worst enemy and thats the wicked game we play,I woke up this morning feeling ill from over night  substance abuse,i looked at my bank account and there is zero $$$ in there, i looked  in my fridge and nothing but 3 week old lunch, a tin of corn, and stale bread, and i feel that all of this is happening because i am being my own worst enemy and i just want myself gone, till now Tenacious D wicked game just said to me that i am  not going to take my self out and gone today, No' i will fight this enemy of my self  and beat it out of my life.
Man... THIS IS SENSATIONALIST
Pretty impressed by Kyle’s sack, not gonna lie..
Legends in their own right.
DUUUDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🤟
I knew what I was getting into from the thumbnail. But still I couldnot skip it. Now I have to scratch the memory area in brain with a sandpaper. So I can watch this again.
Now that’s a way to start a morning 👏🏻👏🏻😂
Jack is the voice of every generation
2 minutes of Kyles balls flapping around and its beautiful.
Almost too far?
😂❤❤️‍🔥👍🇷🇺
Totally mesmerising, I just couldn't look away 🥰
Gross! 🤣
COOL AF! Simply by not trying to be.
truth be told, all that running around got me outta breath
Я плачу... Круто!
I think this vid seriously needed at least one stomach bump...
I got my friend to watch a full 45 seconds.
I watch this often to keep the spirits up
That's some Big D energy right there. Lol Someone tell kari Lake she had it wrong.
should have been warned before sitting down after drinking a very large cup of tea...
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Почти дельфины❤
I freakin love jack black, Get that corner to my face. Ooh smells like cookies.
Why the hell it’s only 1:50???? We want moooooore
this is a real friendship
This gives me immense confidence to stay topless in my house right now.
Nice - love it- now it's time for women to do the same- run through the ocean waves with pure joy with a friend and be okay with not being "socially" OK 💙 I'm not a superstar, just a teacher ❤ I will do it...not for the sake of feminism or anger, but for the longing to be free and feel okay in my "unacceptable or not enough-ness" I love how Jack Black has just been himself- period- I respect that so much. Women can do this too. I don't want to bring in other issues- just being a girl, a teenager, a young woman, a woman, a wife (or not),  mother ( or not) , a full time worker, a professional, a lonely wife, a divorcee, a woman on her own at 50 years old- how do we do that and still be able to run through the ocean waves with a sense of joy and freedom?  We can, but we need each other
Your diets are working out great!
Great singing!! Video… 😵‍💫
This is the greatest and best cover in the world 😂❤ You should have done the whole song!! Love you Tenacious D!!
The part where it seems like he about to greet you...but the music plays nobody loves no one;😔😔
❤
Way to bring me back to my childhood 😂🙏
best sexy gay dad‘s❤❤❤
Oh my be still my heart.  Its hard to contain that much caged heat!
Lol.....lookin like the "bush wackers"... from WWF😂
Gross how 2 whales can be popular for being obese. Sad times we are in.
Tenacious D IS my inner beast! 😂🤣
Love you guys! ❤️😊
He actually is a talented singer
This made my day.
i came, and i cried  but i mostly came.
If you are not familiar with it, go watch the original Chris Isaak video for this song. This could have gotten much weirder.
I love jack black
Great voice
😁👍🇨🇦
For a minute i thought it was tom from lucifer
Awesome, hilarious, and JB's voice is so emotional... No autotune I'd guess. This video echoes the original one.. in a different way.
I can never unsee this 🤣🤣🤣
0:41 best buds for life
This is exactly how I imagine Santa on vacation.
👋👋👋👋❤💙💓
Judging myself. Will I piss my pants? Absolutely. Back from the bathroom. Bring it D.
Why didn't I think of this
Tenacius D manda!
I could hear Jack Black screaming the whole day, full of joy.
I wish this was every video!
This is beautiful!!! Tenacious D 🎸 🔥!!!!
Falla tutta cazzo
Exactly where does one order a swimsuit like Jack's?     Nevermind, I couldn't pull it off.
Those jiggle physics are insane.
🤡🐠
KING.
God I hope no children were harmed during the making of this video 😂😂😂
Damn goosebumps from the moment Jack starts to sing ❤
The very best Music Video i'd ever seen!
моя мечта, что бы мы стали трио!
This is the best song in the world.
That is proberly the most sexy thing I've ever seen.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Youtube for taking me to videos like this 💖
Great voice. Absolute amazing person
I can't stop watching Tenacious D HBO episodes and The Pick of Destiny and I can't stop listening to the songs by Tenacious D, I always loved to listen to the songs by Tenacious D (The Greatest Band In The World).
I like it when the video clip matches the song.
this is how real peak performance looks
1:34 it looks like josh hutcherson whistle meme
Why do they look like they are running in the same place in the beginning
Lol so good i was grooving to it.😂😂
This is an Outstanding clip!!!!
Music Only👉🎵 https://youtu.be/_9cEXQDdn7M
This was me at COCO beach!
Nice!
All humor aside he has the most gorgeous voice and I wish we could hear all of this songs from beginning to end please.
Who is the guy with Jack? I didn’t understand the video with both together...
Soulful singing.
Full Track please! I heard so many versions of Wicked Game (Favorite from Ursine Vulpine) but this one nailed them all!
The D is a national treasure
(In sir Richard Attenborough's voce) here, amidst the rumbling waves of the bay of california, at the crack of dawn  we are priveleged to witness one of greatest natures wonders. Two of the natures most regal and majestic being s: Kylis Gasis Ragis Kagis, and Jackis Blackis Rockius Maximus engaded in A truly sacred ritual of lighthearted tomfoollery and shenanigans . A proof that there's still hope for our conflict stricken word
Where is this filmed?
Do full version!
OMG I love this so much!!!
Das ist was Cooles was Homosexuel ist und das muss man Unterstützen . Nur bei Kindern und Jugendlichen sollte man haltmachen.
What a powerful voice!
Клип ужасен. Диз
Sheesh.  How shameful to run in public looking like that.  I bet they think they look cool with their big stomachs sticking out.  Heck, you wanna see fat!  I'm your girl!
Great video
😂✌️
@Jack Black what a notes... OMG, I don't have any words! REEESpect!!!
While the world out there is falling apart, we need more of this magical stuff. I want a full length version. And a version where they ride off into the sunset together. Maybe to the sounds of The Power Of Love.  I discovered the gay part of me today and gladly integrated it.
What majestic beauty is this
This is so amazing on so many levels
I did not need to see Jack Black in that swimsuit.
Majestic and Beautiful, also a good song.
A voice of sweet, sweet velvet
Faccio una precisazione,il video non era in slow motion😂
Thank the gods this exists
Diablos son unos genios
Absolutely brilliant ❤😂 love them
What a wicked game to play To make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do To let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say You never felt this way What a wicked thing to do To make me dream of you  And I don't wanna fall in love  No, I don't wanna fall in love  With you  Nobody loves no one
i love you Jack 😍, me encanta el cover
Yes
OMG
❤
Kyle Gass is probably one of the most underrated guitar players ever. The man can do anything.
Great cover of one of my all time favorite songs! Just wish it was longer! It's so refreshing to see you two dad bods frolicking in the ocean!
Soemone just woke up from a 15-year coma and went to YouTube to check out what their favorite band Tenacious D is doing in the 2020s and said "Yep, this tracks"
Just close your eyes and listen to the music. Whatever you do, don't look up at the screen.
Vocals are top notch as always. I wish you had some Evenescence covers. Emy Lee and you have something similar in terms of deepness and emotions.
KG is hottest Man on earth
What a dangerous channel to watch while drinking hot coffee 😅
Астерикс и Обеликс прям 😂
Love love love love them!!!!!!!
el mejor nachoooooooooooo
Wow just wow
My eyes are burning but i like the song
I will never be able to sexually recover after viewing this....................
Life is short ⏳
Tighty whities in the ocean got to love it
They are indeed truly HAPPY
love both them smile
1 bathing suit 1 eggplant 0 fuks given
This was sooo gooood! 💖
Imagine being there for the filming of this
God, I miss the ocean.
The water is luxurious looking. The singing is wonderful.....but I'm seeing way too much junk.
😂😂😂😂
Jajajajajaja amo como la canción y el video inspiran sentimientos completamente opuestos jajajaja
We NEEEEED a fuull song of this!! 👌🏻🔥🔥🔥
two kids trapped in old man bodies. god i love these guys
KG has a fuckin piece
2  Buddha's  blessing humanity with their presence.
Que coisa mais linda! Vcs são muito bons! rsrsrrss
Love his voice.
One thing i love abouth Jack is that he keeps Kyle by his side all the time 😁
Guys, sometimes I feel how wicked game you play with music. Somehow it's hunted to be wanted. But, the other ways, I'm still listening to you songs like a madman
Thank you jack black, if it wasnt for your song i wouldnt be able calm down before coming out of the closet as bi🎉
What the??  Best version ever, I am in love with this! ❤
Why am I only NOW hearing this cover?!?!
😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
It's not Bo Derek. Leave it there.
... legendary af
This is a perfect example when the cover improves the original. I feel like i needed more than only 1:50
Meu Deus, anjos.
I'm still longing for a full length version of this cover.
my man KG has a hog!
Belleza, good voice
Оскар, однозначно.
😂😂😂 he really is a happy over 50’s with no limits.😂😂
hypnotic.
Excelent video !!!!
*the only time this song has ever brought tears to my eyes
I died of laughter, and when I was reborn, it turned out that I was running along the waves with some naked old man.
Fact 1: we watched at two bearded naked men for about two minutes Fact 2: we watched to the end and it's video perfect }8)
: )
What an incredible song 💗💗
What a wicked song!
Esses dois sao muito loucos..... Lembrei do video do  cantor original dessa musica assistindo esse e rachei de rir
Wow that’s body positivity at its finest
I love the fact that I can see the genuine friendship in this video.
I thought Kyle was running around in his tighty whities but at the end I saw the brilliant sequence! They even rock the fashion worlds!!!
It warms my heart that Kage & Jaybles are still making (& covering music) all these yrs later. I've been a fan since i first saw their hbo special in the 90's. if you're a fan & you've never seen it, you're not a fan. 😏🤭 Kage is one of the greatest acoustic guitarists of our time & Jaybles will go down in history as one of the most talented singers. I've always believed this. I had the absolute honor to be front row, just feet from them during an acoustic tour in 2013 & it was magic.
Every day I play this. In my apartment.  Number 4. Easy to remember.  My door is 4
Isso é insanamente engraçado!
I love this guy😂😂😂😂😂
Jack Black needs to do more of these gems
worst video clip ever, but  i will put a like for the effort and the calories burned
extravaganza 😮
😂
beautiful
!
Jack Black is literally so sexy tho.
This guy looks a lot like Saurabh Shukla from Bollywood
Oh boy…!😂
Jack solo escuchare tu voz porque el video es tooo much for me😅😅😅😅🙏🙏🙏🙏 Por favor con ropa el próximo video .
tintan y Marcelo juntos otra vez
Tenacious D. We will love you forever. <3
You guys are killing me! 😂❤
🔥
What a great Voice....
Çould listen to kyles acoustic playing all day
Eu amo tanto voces <3  I love you guys
❤
Никогда не думал, что так весело и приятно будет смотреть на то, как бегут и дурачатся пожилые, толстые мужики).
Los dos se súper divierten!!! Eso me encanta!! Seres humanos así como los ves!!  👏👏👏
Esa voz la usa tan genialmente!
El tipo pasa tan bien con lo maravilloso que hace!!!
👏👏👏👏👏magestuoso!!!!! Jack Black es espectacular!! Y su compa de Tenacious 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Джей Би, плагиат или восхищение исполнением и аранжировкой? https://youtu.be/M-znD6QKbrg?si=bLfQ-yNAm6h8YVPc
Imagine going to the beach and seeing this
Rick Rubin
Nobody loves no one 😂 hit me😅😅
Cognitive dissonance at its finest 💕
I never get tired of seeing two fat dudes making a fool of themselves.
The model from the original was overrated anyway. Too much mud on her ass
Just Wow
STUDS! Let’s F*N GOOOOO!
The D is FIRE 🔥
Jack your voice is amazing
Так хочется вместе с этим Сантой и его сыном бегать по воде...
They'll be great at WALL-E live action movie...
It's a great song... This version is great, but the Pipilotti Rist is spectacular
Excellent
❤😎👍👍👍
Que bien me caen estos tipos!!!
This needs extended, you are such a great singer Jables i love you man !
porn in utube?
Needs to be longer
This is the definition of PEAK MALE PERFORMANCE :D
These guys should stop covering songs and do dances instead.
Show no Brasil? Quando terá?
❤🥹🤬 YEAH!
I can’t look away
The smiles…the panzas…the vocals….fabulous. It looks like as if they spent the day at the beach and as they were wrapping up, they said, “you know what would be fun…”
Enjoying life through passion and positivity.👏🏾
Just me, or is Kyle packin’?!
Wish they would do the full version. I'd listen to it on loop all day
You guys are the best. Thx for every special moment you gave me.
What a wicked game to play… Only giving us 1:49 😩
Im dead😂 new fan over here
Confidence is something these men have stockpiled man. Gotta love these gems
Как же я хочу нырнуть там вместе с ними!
This song needs to be longeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr
Came for the leotards. Stayed for the "wit chu"
As much as you hate it, this is what peak male perfomance looks like.
LOLz!
I am in the mood when I'm going through my playlist of kind of hard hitting music. Dimmu Borgir, Behemoth, etc. This came on randomly and every single time that it does (and it has been at least 40 billion times) I welcome this piece and appreciate the masterpiece behind it. <3
This is one of my favourite songs, but KG's guitar made me feel things I've never felt!! ❤❤ The emotion behind it is just beautiful 😍!!
Really beautiful man
❤❤❤❤hermoso
Jack Blacks voice is incredible
Wow...Trumperica does Not to be Trumperica 💪
Jack's mankini 😂🎉❤
X DIOS QUE VOZ!!❤
Is this a Bond song? it has the same vibe kinda
The best version of this song is the original with “HIM”. No one makes it better than them. But your version is better than Peter Jöback’s version.
I am in love with these two!! 😂❤
peak male physique
I love these guys. Jack has the BEST voice and Kyle....well hes a guitar picking DEMON!!!!
things that can't be unseen for $500 Alex....
This is a surprisingly excellent cover
Haha, what the hell did you guys stuff your crotch areas with?!?!
Just a 1min49?! You must be kidding  me((( Its not enough need more!))
Such a beautiful song!🎶
This has huge "taking my golden retrievers to the beach" energy
Men of culture ..wait, no yeah ..men of culture we meet again 👌
i am begging for a full cover my leige
i seem to listen to this every night I get home from work because its stuck in my head all day. is there any way to get a hold off just the guitar from Kyle? I feel like my brain is fixated on the way he plays this song for some reason
I have a request: try a Joe Cocker song next.
this shit slaps
❤❤❤❤❤❤ 🇩🇪🇩🇪   Jack black The best
best band in the world!!!
I see that bong still works
Some say they're still on the beach to this day.
Yessss
Is this his father?
i dont know why i love his voice so much....
Theyre so fkkn awesome. He really has an amazing voice.. And he's hilarious too.. I'm sold. when I first saw him in Orange County, he immediately became my fave foreva! And he jiggles in all the wrong places, I kinda love it
I wish it was longer
327K?😂
Is this far way better than original one?
Oh my gosh soo fun 😂😂❤❤😂😂
Damn you, you sexy sons of playas.
Złoto
The only bad part of this song is that it doesn't last longer.
Seper sexy dudes
Omg, it's better. ❤
jack black . lets make a duo .
Me when I make it to the beach and get 109 seconds of happiness.
Amazing vocals with an utterly ridiculous video to go with it
BRAVOOOOOOO
Everyone talks about Jack Black, but no one mentiones how cool Kyle Gass is. Long live the D!
My boyfriend loved this song that he has ended up sing this song twice. While I was tagging along
HIM approves this version
Please, Tenacious D, I want the full song
Tenacious D meets Mazzy star and I'm digging it
What a wicked game to play, to make the D feel this way. What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you. What a wicked thing to say, you will let the D feel this way. What a wicked thing to do, you let me dream of you. No I don't wanna fall in love. No I don't wanna fall in love. With you. Nobody loves no one.
Long songs bro we need them
I clicked on it expecting a cracky video and ended up downloading this masterpiece into my phone))
Makes me happy to see how happy they are. Long live the D 🤘🏻
Eu chorei assistindo 🖤 Ficou lindo demais ❤
風邪ひかないでね二人とも
i need to wash my eyes
This reminds me of baywatch. But better
Kill me now
That is the most beautiful original acoustic rock song.
Man what a Tenacious D video.
This video makes me uncomfortable in a very joyous way...the audio is stellar, a great recording, the guitar is so crisp.
just like ROCKY III beach scene
😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Surprisingly majestic.
This song literally shivers my timbers.
nobody loves no one!
kyle is packing xD
I haven't heard this for awhile & resonates with me very deeply right now.
Chris, Jack & Rage Cage should just sit down and play this one from start to finish lying on their backs looking up at the digital stars in a science museum.  Jack innocently rolls into a juice box, makes eye contact with Chris and giggles.  Camera pans over to Cage who gives a nod of approval.
Masterly! 🤩Love from Sweden 💛💙
The only Wicked Game cover I'll ever approve of! 😂
Best 'Smile while running award' goes to Jack Black !
Love u 💓
Fun and games aside, Jack Black was gifted with an amazing singing voice
In m'y hearth
I watched this in 1080p enhanced bitrate 😂
hehe. great!
❤❤❤
This is dichotomy ❤😂❤
Omg, why do I like this version waaaaay better than the original!?!?!
This is one of them songs you can feel
why is no one talking about his penis flopping around
Плющев?
Don't be enslaved in others' delusions, be free: The Connections (2021) [short documentary] 🙏
i have never enjoyed watching two fat men running on the beach more.
Just my opinion, but i think that Jack Black and Andy Bernard have the same voice tone.  By the way, I love this video, it's a masterpiece.
Let's be honest - this is just joyous.
Kyles Belly has two little bellies 😅😂
So happy they’re still making videos!! ❤
I love músic and feeling fine  So im in love with tenacious D U HAVE TO PLAY IN ARGENTINA!
I truly envy these legends friendship and wish I had a bromance like theirs in my life
I kept looking around to make sure no one walked up behind me while watching this video. Lol. Just saw that How to Draw with Tenacious D video the other day. I love how Jack Black is a famous Hollywood actor but still feels free to do whatever weirdness comes to mind
This is exactly how I imagine myself singing this song in my head when I’m sad , thanks Jack and Kyle you’re awesome !
These guys have balls of steel, big flappy balls of steel, talk about heavy metal 😂😂❤
American fat fucks destroying a perfect melody.. perfect
Love this!
🙂😄🙂😄🙂😄
This is what happiness really looks like 🙂
Кайф!
What a wicked way too wake up😂
Крутой хромач! И песня крутая, хотел бы спеть вмести с этими мамонтами рока, в хорошем смысле)
this video made me randy down low and the vocals made me spew in my special sock
Great cover ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful
Lol, love it!
Only complaint. It wasnt long enough 😂
I  <3 this :)
We ride and we ride and we'll never subside And we'll ride till the planets collide And if you say that we do not ride I'll tan you're fucking hide, RIDE!
Jack black never seizes to be my #1 hero
Who here from the alcoholic pug video
danmmmmmmnm
gregs awhile spaniolv yep
Awww, i didn't know they were a couple!  How cute 😁
The greatest song in the world 👏
Love those guys with love from Ukraine
I don't know if I've seen anything this awesome in past 10 years. Respect, Tenacious D
Just as sick as two fatty guys can be beyond midlife crisis, but having fun, playing music, shooting a movie on overages crazy rock maniacs with bellyguitaring with Dave Grohl masked as the devil and growing huge beards while they never stop doing these. 👏👏
THIS IS ART; IN MUSIC TOO :-)
That D is... tenacious
Why isn't this a full song!!??!!???
Great now I'm Horny, Thank-you...
Jack is liberal trash. Never liked his over-acting. Talentless slob.
Guess I’ll be having nightmares tonight
Tenacious D: "The Magnificent Tits" album when it comes out.
So good 😂
He is the modern day John Belushi - without certain side effects. 😂
Tenacious d what a great act😂 jack blacks voice never fails to deliver❤😂
At the end Life Is Just a run through the waves...Just keep it smiling
Nobody loves no one...  That double negative never hits not hard.
This is my favorite song of all time, and this was fantastic.
we dont deserve this-------
THEY ARE CARRYING A LOT OF EXCESS WEIGHT THEY SHOULD LOSE WEIGHT THEY SHOULD CUT OUT CARBS THEY SHOULD CUT GLOOTEIN RBBRBAAGEGEGS CUT DAIRY ENDBSBSN EAT ONLY MEAT WBABABABA FASTING ETC I AM TOTALLY AN EXPERT DNDBX S AAAAN
Chills down my spine
THIS is peak male physique ✨
Isak frm the bst ✌✌
I have never been more turned on in my life.  Love my D hotties❤
paul simon and garfunkel nah this duo is the best
son dos pequeñas sirenitas disfrutando de la vida que bueno verlos de esta manera !!!!!!
Excellent 🤣😂👌
These two have something Hollywood  will never have. Life.
And people rated The Sound of Silence cover by Disturbed as the best ballad... THIS IS IT.
Beautiful
I see joy.
In a world full of tenor voices, thank heavens there's still bass
If only everyone had a friend like Kage is to Jables.....
Poesia
Damn I was hoping for a full cover! Gorgeous rendition, thank you for sharing!
Grateful I found this. The juxtaposition is incredible. Tearing up while watching two fat men run through the ocean in their underwear.
Everyone should go and pay homage to the original afterwards. What a song
Mans packing
Greatest video I've ever seen!
Forzaaaaaa horizonnn
Beautiful!!
шедевр
JB has a legit great, powerful, emotive voice.
Are Tenacious D going to remaster more classics like this ? Because I’m already nursing a semi-on over this version
Заебись исполнили!
What a wicked thing to say, I'll  never float like you.
I really wish they did a full cover of the song (aka longer!)
rip kyle my ever loving santa clause and master of the dick push ups
It's not easy to watch but hysterical none the less
I can't listen to this song just once.
Please tell me they are going to be rolling around the on the sand together....🤞🤣 Edit: Dammit yall disappointed me!😅
Hey guys. You're the best there IS. Please do the entire version ,it Will be magnificent. Thanks
Nice😂
Beautiful. #KeepTheChildAlive #RealMen #sexophone
Did Tenacious D ever release a full cover version of this song?  Sometimes less isn't more.
I don’t know if Jack Black has ever done any country, but I’d pay for that.
what a treasure this is.. part comedy/satire, part emotional/innocent- brilliant
We absolutely need a whole song recording of this pleaaaaaase!!!!!!!!!!!! You absolutely kill it!!!
Never heard these lyrics properly until you guys did this rendition. Absolutely Superb!
Ah... Jables n Rage Kage ❤
Tenacious D always puts me in a good place.
Thanks for creativity 🤘🙌
ngl I did not need to see that much blubber today, but Jable's outfit was impressive enough to make up for it.
Just go away Jack Black, please just go far far away. 🥴
Its criminal making this song so short
I need one hour version of this! Brilliant! 🤘🔥🤘
This is a pure love story between two brothers, what a beautiful storytelling. ❤‍🔥
Eu quero prestar atenção no som, mas não consigo heheheheh... Foda demais, Mestres
KAJU
Amazin music video. Probably took you so long to catch this perfect angle.
Po singing to his plate of steamed buns 😂😂😂
I have never laughed so fucking hard in my life! LMSFAO!
Thanks Jack, that was way more of your schlong than I needed to see...
Such a beautiful scene
My God, I love you 2 so much! 🤣🤣🤣 Why is it that THIS is the version of the music video that I needed all along, just to wash my eyes out of the original that I HATED SO MUCH my entire life, that my sister and I used to run screaming from the TV away from what we still call, "the butt mole licking video"? Yes, butt mole. We were SO MAD that we had to watch 2 people rolling around on the beach, licking each other's butt moles. No, there are no moles, of any kind, on the Chris Isaac video. It just FELT like there were. We just wanted to watch Metallica, for God's sake!
Still in stitches! EVERYTHING looks (and sounds) better in slo-mo; even a couple of old fat farts with droopy testicles.  I CAN say that because I AM one!
I can't believe they're allowing porn on youtube now! Gorious!
Молодцы. Смешно и задорно. 😂
I'd rather listen then watch...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.... What is this?!?...  Paradise ?!!!!!.......
Hypnotic
Tenacious D are a national treasure and should absolutely be recognized as such. They belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Hermosa canción 😊
Baha I hope when I'm an old devil Ive got friends as tight as Kyle and JD
Me encanta su voz, su energía! Grande!!❤
Masterpiece
Man we need a sequel to Pick Of Destiny.....
This is the Spirit.
There are a few things as awesome as this video when you're stoned.  100% recommend.
Too many carbs, baby.
O vídeo perfeito não exist...
2 Pitbull's when they see an unattended kid on the beach.
True friendship!
guys you are cool! 😘
they dont care being fat... american culture full of fat sickness...
Aristotle and Plato
320 тысяч....ебануться,мягко выражусь...
1:42 Those shorts!  I assumed that they were boring tidy whities and was shocked at the last scene.  Two kindred spirits there!
For a second there I thought it might get weird..
How have I not heard tenacious d cover Great Ball of Fire yet? Random thought but yeah, come on now. Kyles golden fingers mixed with jacks godly voice on that tune would be a masterpiece
Please tell that no one suffered a cardiac arrest in the filming of this video….
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black#Early_life_and_education
You may not like the look of it, but this is what maximum human performance looks like.
I loved your performance at Auckland with the Foo Fighters the other day.  I hope you can bring brother Kyle over to New Zealand and do another Tenacious D concert!  Love your work, as always!
parece dois cachorro novo epilético, que fofo.
singing and guitar are so tasty, as is all the jiggly (may I call you Jiggly?)
Two bears go swimming......😅
literally Ilyuka Mad and Grusha Khovansky
😂😂😂
1:03 that transition to falsetto and drop back to chest voice is unbelievable
jack can sing all BS a side
Thank you for this Masterpice❤
WICKED GAME ......  I WANA FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU
You have just killed Chris Isaak. Blasphemy of the golden kind. A diamond.
Yes, someone will make you a ten-hour version already! I'm really tired of rewinding these two minutes.
Is Kyle wearing bejazzled trunks???
What a wicked thing to do , to make me dream of another song by D.
Immer ..  wieder ..  von ..... vorn. <3 - See you in Kopenhagen, hopefully. :)
Just gotta ask, why is Cage stuffin' it? #sparkleunderpants
I'm not gay but...
Hypnotic
Hearing this song, THIS SONG, with an acoustic guitar and Jables voice makes me want to find Chris Isaac’s house and protest in front of it until he lets the full song be sung like this
This is shockingly beautiful.
Jack, Kyle; FULL SONG guys, let's go!
This is what the world needs.  You have no business being that funny and talented at the same time.  Thanks Kyle and Jack
Vocals are so gorgeous 😍
Brotatos 4 life🤜🤛
The pure perfection of Kyles’ guitar combined with Jacks’ stunning vocal in this song is .. *chefs kiss*  I can just listen to this tiny segment over and over again, and still find that it gives me goosebumps!
Good song
Te ma zo. Y el vídeo es hipnótico
Stopped at 1:30 - such happiness !
This is pure gold. Thank you for bringing joy into the world
Gapisz mi się na bebech?
Jack Black still has great vocals. The power and force he puts into his voice is so effortless.  I like the comedy/rock songs but more serious ones would be much appreciated too.
two magnificent beasts cavorting in the surf, realizing the ancient mating ritual of their forebearers once lost to the fading sands of time.
Me hace recordar cuando de pequeño llegue a ver la playa por primera vez, y fue que me acompaño mi amigo que recuerdo
He is one of my favorites!!
I wish this was longer
Gotta love Jacks voice
I love how honestly beautiful this is: They are fat and their small cocks are fluffing around while having fun.
WITCHU
Somewhere Chris Isaak just said 'Damn', smashed his guitar, and walked away in defeat, shoulders slumped.
❤❤❤
🤘🏼
actually fire
BIG PENIS
I'd love for Tenacious to do more sincere songs. It's just so beautiful! ❤
not every idea needs a video guys
The top, the bottom or just mediocrity, they have seen and done it all! Only once you have *tasted* the _whole_ spectrum, you can claim true fulfillment. They have chased the music from hell to heaven and back to earth. JB and KG are the true gods of male accomplishment. I accept their whole essence: everything i like, everything i hate and everything i don't really care about ... all of it. Anything else would simply be blasphemy.
can we pls get a whole song?  because this is just amazing
You'll see high production music videos from time to time, and then you'll see this.  This is better.
Two fat men running on the beach will never not be funny. And with such a serious song playing behind it. Comedy genius my boys
Two beached whales. 🐳
incredible
You have no idea how much I love you TD ❤
Πολυ καλυτερο απτο μαλακα με το λαστιχο και το σκυλο
Весёлые карапузы😅.
Who hurt you Jack
2 happy bearded babies playing with the waves
Ребята, я Ваш большой фанат. Привет из России. Джэк, Кайл. Приезжайте ко мне на день рождения в Новосибирск. Денег у меня нет, но я буду очень рад. Люблю Вас!!!
I just love his voice. A very uplifting video. Made me smile
это лучшее что я видел
They think it’s sonar that makes them end up on beaches
Tenacious-d smuggling pork shoulders over the border in his front brief pocket!!...
If I had to choose the best Duo that has ever existed, I'm choosing Tenacious D
😀🤩😄😄😄😄😍😍😍😍😍
Nothing like seeing to old dudes  running around in what only  Could only be  descibed as diapers in the ocean. If I gave jack a straviorious... he would put it in a safe  and go to the nearest  toy's r us store and buy a sax o boom  and make a fking rock song genius young blood.
This is the kind of masterpiece that reasons have nothing to do with.
🎧🎵🎼🎶🎹 it’s beautiful
😂😂😂❤
Damn what a voice 🔥 the legend jack black
There is nothing more beautiful than confidence and humor ❤
very gay....not that there's anything wrong with that....
God damn, everytime i listen to this song im crying. Bless Kyle & Jack! Superheroes for so many ppl out there! 🤘✊️🖤
Well I was a straight man up until this
epic
This is Tanuki!
Jesus. I love everything about this.
This is the second verse to Encarnación prove me wrong
This is…crazy good.
Felt like these guys are still kids trapped in adult bodies
The music video really speaks volumes about life and death and love. Truly beautiful.
Это лучшее что может быть в этой жизни. Свобода, абсолютная свобода. Вкусная еда, плевать на внешку. Делать все что хочешь, где угодно. Не зависеть ни от кого. В любом смысле.
Jack's voice is much powerful as Eddie Vedder and David Draiman are.
Love it! Hey! Will you guys please cover Mandy? Yes. The Barry Manilow song!
sensacional.
Супер!!!!❤❤❤❤
its so fatty ❤❤❤❤
Smexy Guys 😋
I loved her.  I screwed her.  I screwed myself.  I fucked me.  I fucked her.  I fucked myself.  I am pain.  I feel pain.  I feel myself.  I lost me.  I lost me.  I lost myself.  I love you still.  To this day.
О Господи... ЛЕГЕНДЫ СНОВА В ДЕЛЕ!
Bar the rendition!  I ove the fact Jack breaks the wave for kyle to lessen the imapct! Brothers! ;-)
If Jack Black ever gets cancelled I don't wanna know why and I won't care.
this might be the best the best duo since jhon and paul... supreme! you can't laugh and make superb music at the same time... well, you guys can!
jack blacks junk going up and down
Fuck yeah ❤
Эти толстяки, это я. Печально.смешно и грустно.
Okay ))
Ох уж эти веселые прыгающие сиськи 😂
Wholesome..... Well done, my life has change, forever.
Jack Black, you´re crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂 LOL Thank you 😂😂
Do the whole song Jack!
I remember the times when Jack Black was a teenager...😂
Never need to see this fat hairy guy half dressed again. Just no.
The only thing wrong with this is that it isn't 5 minutes long.
Браво Маэстро, восхищался и восхищаюсь вашим юмором и тем более талантом. Спасибо за видео.
These dudes make me comfortable with idea of getting old
This happens to all old men eventually - they get drunk and runs to drown in the sea :D
Y si dejaban algo a la imaginación?
They really have big schlongs
Jack's voice is so perfect, I wish he made more music like he made in this cover. I'm in tears.
Jables and KG, I’m gonna need the full cover plz ❤
Is it just me or is there is a MASSIVE elephant in the room in this comment section???
Huuuge heart gold💛💛😢
Крампус и Санта- достучались до небес...

Why is the guy from school of rock chasing Santa?
Im oddly aroused
Трусы с зеброй просто прекрасны
Can’t take my eyes off Santas sack
I really wish you did a full version.  🙏🏻
Really makes you wonder what kinda masterpieces we'd get if Tenacious D was a serious band.
top 10 musicas fodas

This is an incredible tune
Love these guys
They're running naked in the sand!!
Ok i need to lose some weight.
Muito top.
Both are in perfect shape to play Santa🎅 in some wicked Christmas comedy.. Just saying 🤷‍♂️   Now do it!! 👨‍🎤
Incredible. Want more.
Fucking beautiful
pure majesty!
I can imagine Jack going like: "C'mon Kyle we're gonna run on the beach in our underwear. it's gonna be epic...."

Can relate 👍😎
🙌🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥
this is hard.
Mesmerizing... I love how they look like they are running in place :D.
original Tenacious D 😆👌
I’m 52. Thank you for making me feel good about my body.
you guys are gods! peaches
Bert Kreischer really has gone to shit these days...
Baywatch would've been +20% curvier with these two magnificent pregnant nightingales ❤
what i have learned from this is kyle has a huge junk
Everytime I see Jack's facet makes me happy. Specially with a smile on it💖
Props to the costume dept. here... bravo
😂😂😂😂 ❤ these 2 dudes!!!!
1:50 minutes I needed in my life.
Have they ever done studio versions of the 60s Spider-Man theme, or their cover of the Flash Gordon theme? Both are great.
americans have perfected the game of being fat without dying
If this video doesn't make you smile, go see a doctor
Helena Christansen still has the better breasts. It's close, though.
SANTA CLUS IN TEH BEACH?!
Это не дикая игра это дичь полная. Мне кажется они употребляют что-то запрещённое
"You guys should do a serious song."  "On one condition..."
So disturbing.....
it isnt in slow motion
This is my 2nd favorite version, coreys version hit me more.
We demand a 30 minute version.
This is what the internet was made for
<😂img class="small-emoji emoji yt-formatted-string" src="https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u1f602.png" alt="😂">
When you're learning a song by ear by watching two large men in their undies running on the beach in slow motion over and over and over.
Some people are just special. Effortless talent. Normally talents like Black die young. Lets just be grateful he is still here.  I do long for a time for him to get "serious", and make music that isn't based in comedy. I think he has somewhat painted himself into a creative corner, so to speak, with the whole Tenacious D schtick.
This could not be more beautiful!!! 😀
жесть у них животы огромные канеш.😀
Here's the thing JB is a sneaky fabulous singer. The other part KG is kick ass on the guitar. I'm such a fan been following you guys forever 💓 Serious love from Colorado 😂
No irony here: I love how this video reference is about thirty years old.
I once was thinking about ending my life like that. Eat everything, sign songs, write poems, and just enjoy the life till my heart drops.
Два толстых пидора бегущих по побережью -это романтично. Что за хрень?
They are so happy!!! I feel this emotion!!! Gorgeous vibe!!!
That's cute)
Does this make anyone else wish that jack black did more super deep covers? So fucking good
WHERE IS PICK OF DESTINEY 2?!
this is so hot
Thought Jack had some wild belly hair going on for a minute  haha. Great song as usual.
Simply beautiful.😀👍
Jack Blacks body is designed to be a furnace that generates charisma
I died laughing at "whichyoo!"
1:39
i dont know if the story about Chris Isacc getting a boner in his video is true, but i do know this video gave me one.
Someone explaine??!!!....
Good. But not Chris Isaak - good.
Bahahahaha
obligé de m'abonner la dessus...
Master of rock😂❤
Wicked sjit🎉
Just people, living in the moment!
It's odd to see Kyle's dad in video. But it's nice they gave him the spotlight for once. Hope he's doing okay.
No love compares to the love between JB and KG.
LOL Zero F's given
GeneralCrispz is a nerd fr
Living legends!! Simply the best !!
😅😅😅 this is great!!!
😂😂😂😂
Pure art! Love it!
Kyle delivering more packages than FEDEX
Jack Black has an amazing voice. He is very talented.
Amazing 👏🏼
Ну и уроды...мерзость
Cette vidéo a réussi à me mettre de bonne humeur 😂
Красавы оба .И классные музыканты .
True American Fat Metal 🤘
HOW BOUT YOU WRITE A NEW SONG VS SINGING SOMEONE ELSES
I wish JB recorded much more songs like this, he has such a beautiful voice and range and Kyle's guitar is a marvelous thing to listen to.
Kage and jables still able to have such magical chemistry after all these years gives me hope for the world
I've been a fan of Tenacious D for years but I have to say I found out about this cover from The Charismatic Voice
Пародия )))) a parody https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qenpPw_0za8
LOVE IT Sung from the Heart
Time is a ruthless bitch boys....
FULL COVER! FULL COVER! FULL COVER!
This song should be the start of the second mario movie. As Bowser decides he cannot allow himself to love the princess anymore heart broken. All he now wants is revenge on everyone.
you two.....
This is actually a really good cover. 😅
Golden voice and master fingers. U are true rock gods!..!
Seeing KG with a big grey beard makes me feel old but... in a good way?
Is watching gay porn a sin ?
Jack's plaintiff wail on the "i" want to fall in love is chillingly good...
This is better than the original and any other cover I've ever listened to!
So funny but also so good! ♥
Video of the year right there 👌🏻
How they are fills!
Hope that new album is still coming.
For me it is pure art. These two older guys playing catch and are happy, that is freedom and life. Thank the D.
Add for the new jean paul gaultier scent - ultra beard... elixir (salt)
this was amazing! ty for rocking this one out! and if i can ask for something it is that yall would do the whole song please?
I was anxious the entire time hoping we weren't going to see something we weren't meant to see....
Epic voice and epic voice control!
Piece of art Guys!
OMG, I am here because Charismatic Voice, and now I understand why wine is required
You are gentlemen and scholars, and I salute you!
Please more of this
This need to be extended to a full song jack blacks got an amazing voice
I was just about to watch 50 shades of grey. But this a game changer
Они существуют! Они существуют!  Трусы на подтяжках!
I think the "with you" that sounds like "witch you" in this version ties perfectly into the topic of the song 🖤
Imagine two women doing that...
Muy bueno
Ah, nature.
Don't know if I Eva wanna go to the beach again, after seeing two fat as white man .... Frolicking????..... Who am I kidding..  Both very talented , fat, yes, but, men with humour in their hearts.. Good Old Desk bless 'em .( anyone get that ref.)
We need the full version!!!
It's actually kinda nice ta see 2 grown men running on a beach just having fun it's positive.
i need a 10 hr version
My day is not complete till watched AND listened  to Jack. I believe this  track could cure depression  100% Jack i bow my hat to you.
This is perfect
Звуковая интерпретация понравилась, а вот видео ряд полное гавно....
I'm falling in love right now
и вообще не верю что я это смотрю! ))))
отжигают мужики! ))))
Full version on the next album, right?  RIGHT?!?!?!?!?!?
Так трогательно. 😥 наверно каждый хотел бы, так же с Батей пробежаться
lmmfao you goofy bastards.. ill never quit the d
Only in a first world would dumb crap like this even sell.
Probably the best or at least one of the best bands nowadays.
You can see here some peak male athletic form
Чуваки! Вернулся посмотреть еще раз и сказать: вы прекрасны!
Kyle gass in tighty whities lol 😂😂
Tenacious D can put out art as silly as it is beautiful like no other 🥲
Please do the full song!! This is such a tease (not just talking about the sexy beach running either :p)
I’m a straight man, but this has me questioning that.
sublime
Yes!!! Just... Yes!!! The magic that *is* Tenacious D!🤘😜
Jack Black is the talent of our generation.  Kyle Gass is a great companion too.  He's perfect.
Still hoping for a FULL version of this song
True Bromance
Mommy, why is the fat elf chasing Santa on the beach??
There goes mah lunch
The contrast between the serious skilled singing and guitar playing and the video is just wonderful
what would your mom think ?
Lmao!!
Possibly the greatest visuals on YouTube
I mean... they seem to be enjoying themselves. 💜
these men are packing, jeeeeeeeeez!
Jake black😎😎😎
Chris Isaak WISHES his video had the same raw, sexual energy as this one.
The only thing missing is them splashing water like childs. It is the best video of a friendship. Best song in the world, not a tribute. Best song for HIM, best video for TenaciousD. Even if I like Jack Blacks Vocals.
God. This is so moving... And then there is the song.
Приемлемо
Next Mario movies gotta have this in it, Bowser just being utterly heartbroken probably just before meeting Wario and Waluigi lmaooo
more than man
incredible
What I like Is the fact  that the people  Who write the comments with congratulation about  the music are more then who comments about how comic this video Is .. ( I like both video 😂😂 and awesome music❤)but Is wonderful notice that   people still know listen :-)❤
This is true art. Sorry Piccasso.
VERSÃO COMPLETA!!!
i hope i can live to be an old man and have a cool not gay friend to do dumb shit like this with
They look like too giant toddlers having the time of the lives. This is gold.
This is wholesome af
Best music video I've ever seent in my whole dang life.
Going to be my wedding song, with this video on the big screen.
..the sparkling Tighty-Whiteys✨😄💕✌🏼
We all have David Lynch to thank for this.
Ah sim.. esses romances acontecem sempre nas praias do Rio Grande do Sul..
yeah so we get your funny and i do think your funny... but did you know you also have an amazing musical talent? like ive been listening to your shit literally for decades and its fire i dont understand why you mix it with comedy.... i would like to know why this has become a serious inquiry.
Y'all did pretty good for about a minute and a half!   I mean, with slow mo...
Why was I absolutely sobbing by the end of this? 😭
A Dad bod is good to find.
This made my nipples hard.
I started covering this song when I perform because of this version, and every time I sing this part in that classic D style people freaking love it.
oh i love this
0:48 Amazing job of blocking the wave for his bro.
I wanna be happy like them :O
I was surprised that they could run like that. Especially while smiling.
JB's freeze-framed face from 1.19(ish) to the end of the vid is how i feel. Frozen. With everything happening around me.
I am waiting.
Gorgeous
О что за красивые мужчины наверное между ними хорошая МУЖСКАЯ дружба 🤝
Simply BEAUTIFUL.
The best 1:50 min in my life
Damn Jack
Friendship is rare do you know what I'm sayin to you😮
Incredible!!!
On another note, I think I put an exotic dancer through college because of the way she danced to the original song. She moved like a damn snake wrapping around my body. I was only working in that town for 6 weeks. 😂😂😂
สุดยอดตำนาน😅
I'll never not love Kyle and Jables.
He is mighty tighty whitey and he is smuggling plums
The most erotic video clip I've seen in a long time. Yes, we live in a-waken times !!!
Is it bad I was staring at their crotches the entire time
You guys have motivated me to workout again.
I want a full version of this song.
May this video reach the stars
As much as this film clip is hilariously taken the piss out of a emotional song... Fuck this is an amazing cover!!! Well done!! I do think the last part they should have harmonized but that's my only critic... ❤❤❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIRERiLgakE&t=21s
The legends
Jables and his dad getting wet, nice
It's bettet, than original 😂
Kyle knows how to play a damn guitar, and JB learned from the master :D
Look at these fucking majestic wizards. These old bards.
You guys still got it rock on dude's
I've never been so happy by watchung two grangdpa running at the ocean :)
This video make my day.
Please more covers like this, it's beautiful!
Real men don't grow up, only the toys get more expensive. Greetings from Germany, Olaf
Cage looks like a Sokrates❤
Chris Isaacs come see here! The fun in the video and seriousness in the song... what a clash but so brilliantly executed.
... and they said there would never be a live action Ren & Stimpy ...
This is truely one of the music videos ever
I love that these two are still the same D after all these years.
You guys... are just too damn good. What a beautiful short version. Thanks.
Спасибо Вам! Это лучшее, что я видел  на YouTube за всë время! 🎉😂
I want that feeling. That goofy bliss on JBs and KGs faces. And that voice, those strings *swoons*
Imagine seeing this out of context
just beautiful...
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
I fuckin' love you guys, rock on and LONG LIVE THE D!
Chris Isaak now has to cover "Fuck Her Gently".
I did not need to see this. I did, however, need to hear it.
You made me happy. Thx
Kg with the BD Energy?
we need a full version of this
100 лет тебя не видел))) повеселело)))
Listening to this at max speed sounds like a classic TD
Absolute Rockstars
I do one cock pushup every time I listen to this.
7.2 million views, holy heck dude. I hope that Jack knows how much we love Kyle Gass and want to see them ride into the sunset together as the musical GODS they are!
Love it! 😂
Where would we be without Tenacious D? We'd always be fucking her hard, the devil would have gotten his tooth and made Kyle Gass his bitch while simultaneously destroying the earth. And the most important part, we would have never seen this masterpiece of art.
Kyle's got a big ol juicy hog
Stingrays! Don’t run.
which one is Helena? too close to call
Jack Black you and your buddy are really that's about the gayest I've seen
Kyle got a sack of nuts on him.
2 endurance athletes right there
No I don't want yo fall in lol
Mein neuer Lieblingssong ❤❤❤❤❤❤ unendlich viel liebe für euch ❤
smash🤏
you can't help but love this
Jack you got some voice on ya, hope to see you live some day. Very underrated singer , deserves more recognition and love
It has been said!!! I’m sure!!! That was not long enough please for the love of everyone do the full song to save humanity
Something about this is just so majestic

🖤 oooh but the most important ones love you.
Massive love to you ! 💚
come on folks how good is this
JB and KG - the duo that the world needs. So long as Tenacious D keeps rocking, I'll sleep soundly knowing that the Earth is safe.
lol
Hillarious :D
Why is this song so FUCKING good?!
I heard many Gen Z Sharks were attracted to this version of Wicked Game.
Y'all gonna make me cry with this song
It’s really impressive how effortless that pitch change is at the chorus.
Have I been a fan of Tenacious D this long? It is marvellous to see you this full of energy and full of joy! You are shinier than "a shiny demon"!
Speechless
Being short is the beauty of it.
The metal 🖤☠️🖤 you can't kill the metal
holy hell Kage is PACKING
Best version of this Song. Strong voice from JB and nice guitar playing from Kyle💯💯💯💯💯
Cage & Jables 4 lyfe!!
the mutts guts
I had to come back and say something! There aren't enough emoji faces to capture what I'm feeling right now! I just read your biography! Where have I been? In a time warp? LOL... You realeased music in 2001? I'm so sad I didn't board this train when it first took off. However, I'm a fast learner. I don't watch a lot of TV and don't have HBO... there's part of the problem... I've got a lot of catching up. YOU TOURED and I MISSED IT!!!! My heart is shattered. lol... for REAL >>> How fun to be able to be in a place where you can just pick up and tour all over the place!  I love that you claim to be the best band and are the best band! If you build it... it will come!... and Grammy's.... and fans.... and the whole big sha-bang! GOOD FOR YOU GUYS! I'm still working on going on the VW Van Tour...lol.. for real... somehow ... someway.... lol... I'm going to pick up friends along the way for a leg on the tour... then they will fly home from wherever they land with me for a concert and then I'll pick up the next group of friends... lol.... It's a dream I've been talking about since my 20's.... I need you guys to start thinking about being a surprise friend...lol...well first a friend....I'm cracking up... haha... on a leg of the tour.... haha... just think about it....  I've have lost my mind hearing you guys this morning. Well... it never hurts to ask... but I have to figure the VW Van out first.... haha!  I'm just a gal... grownup... who loves classic rock music although I've sang all kinds of music but the bands I have always been in are classic rock. Maybe an acousitc tour would be fun too.... Okay, I really think I'm losing it over this.... hahaha... I'm inviting Tenacious D into my dream tour... which will be much much MUCH smaller than your tour...haha... but none the less fun.... a music extravaganza... haha!  I'm not a crazed fan either! Haha! A fan yes... but not crazed... just have a little Italian in me and end up expressing my feelings in a grandios way sometimes! If nothing else.... finding this song this morning made my WHOLE DAY! Love it~!!!! It's brilliant~!!!  Whew... Okay, I think I'm done having my Tenacious D melt down. 😂😋🙃🎶🎵
I don't even know what to say... but since I have a million words flying around in my head I'm going to try. OMMMMMGOSH! I'm listening to this as I type and I have goosebumps all over. No... for real. I'm a vocalist... I've been in bands and sang all my life... HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS? I'm on YouTube ALL THE TIME and just ran across it. I am blown away... you both are so talented. I just keep starting it over. The video is cute too but seriously... I mean really seriously... I knew you could sing but I guess I didn't know to what depth. I can tell it comes naturally but you are in full control of everything you are doing. I love the smooth silky notes and then when you open up and throw out those awesome throaty phat notes... at least that's what I call them... lol... I think you know what I mean... I know you must. Then you slide up effortlessly in those head notes.... I'm SOLD... SO SOLD... and I don't know what to do about!!! LoL... This is just so A.W.E.S.O.M.E. The music is beautiful. I am flipped right out! I needed the whole song~!   💙💜💙💜💙💜💙
You don't see that level of athleticism everyday, they're actually in a full sprint throughout this video, and seeing KG pivot and change directions like that reminded me of Dante Hall in his prime!
Garbage. Sorry. COVID isn't life threatening to those who choose to live a healthy lifestyle. I will not be compelled to comply with mandates just because fat diabetics are dying from COVID. Educate yourself.
Olympic games
I love this video very rimantic
Whi'chu
I love it.... tickles my soul....
in the pick of destiny
Hustý plavky
I thought this was a rape scence in greece. Nope.
1 minuto e 49 segundos mais incríveis
Absolutely fantastic cover, and LOL yall at the beach, really ... Dang it man, too funny
Way sexier than the original music video
Why do I wanna cry
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!! INSPIRING AND INSPIRED.
Talent bows to superior talent. Gold, Jablinski….just GOOOOOLLLLDD!
Friends will be friends they’re running naked in the sand
dude i think jack black is the only person to except 100 percent of life and still make it his bitch ,just a great dude being great.
Masterpiece. 😌
Disgusting
You guys are THE best!! Love you both ❤❤❤
@TheCharismaticVoice please.
We are the Devil but you are the D. And I'm greatfull for this. I Love you.
@Tenacious D. Please make a full length cover of this song, your version is absolutely amazing
i 100% thought he was about to charge, barreling into the camera at the end there. he locked eyes DEAD ON, and was on a mission to run them over
This should be will smiths anthem
Can we have full song please ???
This just a tribute -everyone
We so need more of this song. This is so good. You know when you get these guys together its going to be epic ❤
holy shit.
açmayın, dedeler..
Jeez Santa's got a big sac
When people say men aren't born stronger than women...... Just look at the size of the shoulder muscles and arm muscles underneath the mesmerising bouncing flab of these two absolute legends.
These two look like they are genuinely having a good time, other music videos don’t have the same heart and emotions as these two legends
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful.
This honestly might be the best Jack Black has ever sounded, and that's really saying something. Dude's voice is aging like a fine wine.
rip marko !
Man how I wish this was longer... I know you can have too much of a good thing, but this cover is amazing and it NEEDS to be the full 4m46s :(
They surprisingly fill those bathing suits well
Can we please please please have a longer version ? Love this <3
Jack really does have a underrated voice and this shows he can do serious songs not just comedy
Great 😮
Best 109 seconds of my life... 😍🥰❤
Bowser after finding out Princess Peach didn't love him back...
I just wish this was the whole song❤
This is Rocky 3 Apollo creed and rocky all day
🤣
Superb! ❤❤❤❤❤
It’s so majestic. Is it gay if I’m crying and getting semichubbed from this?
The world is not ready for this blessing
I will always keep this vlose to my heart!❤️‍🩹
I love the art you put in this video!
all the acid made this guy crazier than charles manson
Awesome!!
A+ for that bulge jiggle!
I am disturbed
0% - sware words 0% - nudes 100% - happiness
Wow you never see fat bearded men in the wild any more. I've only seen them in captivity. They seem so happy.
Grande Black Jack Te re Banco mostroo LJKASDJKLASDJKLASD
son los mas lindo que me paso en la vida! gracias por existir y ser tan poeticos en cada cosa que hacen!
It’s pretty cold and miserable here in the Scottish highlands just now.  A clip of Kage frolicking in the waves with his hetero life partner is something I desperately needed to cheer me up!  Thanking you most kindly fellas 🥰
This is so freaking good but man I wish it was the full song.
I lost count how many times I have watched this, brings joy each time!
Listened to you guys since I was 11 years old, bought your first ever album which was my first album I ever bought. My favourite duo of all time. Talented in so many ways.
Probably the best thing I've vever seen
Hysterical. Need full length.
I'm starved, it's been 4 months, any new D goodness on the way?
Why is he so fucking good oh that’s right it’s  Jack fuckin black boyy
This is the best song ever combined with the best video clip ever in the whole world.
If you don't  like this.  Go get more stipiterer.
Please oh please Jack do a full length version of this song!!!
PLEASE RELEASE THE FULL SONG
Damn you Jack Black, there is no way to unsee this.
KG should have a Santa cap in this video 🎅
wild, no its great, awesome, thanks, for advertising tenacious d live tour, also providing links to purchase tickets, which is also pretty cool... fffffffffffff except everywhere has sold out everywhere from soho down to Brighton, flip your silver ball
Majestic.
Yo Kyle is packing
I don't understand,some kind of enjoying???
Love these nutters!
this song is acctually really good
Insanely funny to watch. But DAMN GOOD vocals.
Hey D. Remember that time you rocked?
OMG, I need fat friends like this!  They live proud and wild!   I'm embarrassed of being a fat 50 something.  These folks are just embracing the hell out of it!   You go men!
Yo y los pibes cuando gane Milei este domingo 😎
Real men right there
A música é ótima mas os atores do clipe nem tanto...kkk...
I need a 10 hour version of this
no.1
HOLY FUCK THAT “AGHHHHHHUGHHHHHH” TAKES ME BACK TO ELEMENTARY VRO! ITS THE D ITS ALWAYS BEEN THE D!😭😈
If your goal was to get me to reluctantly stare at the giant grapefruit caroming around in KGs skibs , you win.  I surrendered to no one until now.
That guitar makes me feel like I found an oasis in the middle of a desert.
hot damn this is actually so good!
Wow I watching one of my all-time favorite movies, Tenacious D and the pick of destiny, looking back at what total fucking babe that jack black was back then. Nothing wrong w him now , but I love the look he had in that movie but I’ve always love me a nice little belly that can climb up like a fucking tree.
😂😂😂
Beautiful
I walk in on my grandfather masterbating to this!
PLEASE do the full song! 🎤🎶
why isn't there a possibility to give more then one thumbs up?  this. is. crazy. good.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
I dont know why watching two fat guys run in slow mo is so good
I LOVE IT 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Amazing video
JACK COHEN is so funny !!!!!!!!
There is......a lot going on in this video
We need a longer version of this pls tenacious D 😣 🙏
Tenacious D are pisstakers, messers and have been the comedic backbone to my adolescence but here they have cut to the core of my soul. Gosh darnit JB & Cage xoxo
Amazing to think the greatest rock band of all time is just a couple of goofy dudes.
Ficou linda demais a música ❤👏🏼💋😘🙌🏽🫂
Please the whole song !!!
Чёрт! я от души поржал, спасибо Джек, ваша группа удивительна и незабываема, накрутити шары рогатому, продолжайте жечь МЕТАЛЛ! =)
Pleeeeeease do the full song, the need to belt it out sing-a-long style is great.
A friend pointed out to me that every time kyle jumped is jugulars bounced, we are no longer friends
o pop com superproduções nos videoclipes. The D precisa apenas de uma praia, sensualidade e poder.
those games are so wicked!
Iiving their best lives ❤
This is impersonation of 2 old friends having fun, despite the fked up world we live in where only looks and money matter. You people with iPhones and Gucci should think about yourselves if this is the world you wanna leave behind.
Great cover!!! Wished it was longer!!!
Came for the music, stayed for the video
I have remove that song from my playlist
I was wondering what Tenacious D is up to these days, and her you have it 💙 Can we get an extended version please? 😁
So good.
Wtf! Where's the rest of it Tenacious D😢
🤘
Please make a full version this is better than the original 😊
VI AMO!
*Jack didn’t initially like KG when they first met in 1986 and he definitely didn’t want to fall in love with him but he’s been falling hard for over 30 years.*  *This video is evidence that the feeling is mutual.* 👬  *Power Couple* 🤘🏼⚡️🎸
Why are american beaches empty? Water polution?
genious Tenacious D
😂😂
ill never be able to unsee this.. Thanks lol
I love tenecius d but wicked game  from valen vas the first and defentive best. Love that video from valen.
Takhle běhá Mulač se Šubrtem za ruku na Kubě?! :D  Jsou vzrušený nadšením, jak jim to komplikování mého života vychází :D  Si navzájem honite, co :D :D
To Tenacious D  Tenacious D I got some Weed and it would be awesome to meet you guys and we all take a rip from The Bong Of Destiny  That would be so awesome too because I'd freely give you guys my still working acoustic guitar that a stranger gave me.  I hope we meet because you can use the guitar in your show too.
It's funny and i even laught... but then i started thinkng about it.   Grow old, have a friend, go to the beach to have fun and truly smile... that's a goal in life.
I NEED THE WHOLE SONG! WOW AMAZING COVER! PLEASE DO THE WHOLE SONG! I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!
Thank you!
Beautiful song 🥲😪🥺🥺
My husband and I love the, D!  I have an odd request. My husband turned me onto you wonderful individuals during the hardest year of my life. I got very ill last year, I was in the ICU for much of the end of last year. I was in a chemically induced coma for two weeks, they woke me up on his birthday. This is almost a year ago that this happened. His birthday is October 16th and I was hoping if you and Kyle have the time, could you maybe give him a birthday shout-out? It's understandable if not, we love you guys. You, along with my husband brought me out of a very dark and unexpected place. Thank you so much for just being you. Love you guys!
The ending where JB stares at the camera while KG looks off behind while they run up...WTF? How did they do that? It was pure beauty.
Jack black has cracked the code to living life exactly how he wants it and kyles along for the ride
well...I WAS eating.
Anyone else notice how kyles ball casually flew out? 😂😂😂 1:02
mmmmmm 🥵🤤
Das schöne ist hab das Lied geteilt und alle sagen , jup das bist du. Ich liebe euch.
Gonna make sure i get tickets for you in Dublin!
Que voz tan hermosa que tiene esto gordo precioso hahaha
Que jamas mueran, amo a estos tipos, amo a jack
we need the entire song!! this is just amazing
Can’t get enough Tenacious D
I love it I love them both!
Pure magic, right here!
Whoever is dressing you guys need to be commended. Or arrested. Commended then arrested. Indecent exposure should be a felony in this case
Это Джек Блек?
Oh my god they were roommates
The joy.
Tribute song ok
всем привет кто от Мэда
Need more Kyle and Jack in our lives❤
I am never surprised when JB really sings...he has had serious chops since the start.  I'm happy he is allowing the world to really see that now.  (High Fidelity being the first example of this with his amazing cover of "let's get it on".)   Commit to the full cover Jables, we all want it! ;)
Full version…please…PLEAAAAASE
I couldn't stop smiling this entire video just seeing KG and Jack Black so joyful😅
Just a couple o guys.
Spotted 2 gozilla at the beach today
omg....pls...someone send me some acid for eyes.   Not lsd...pls.   1000 hits is my lifetime limit.  pls send a  new ear to replace the one that blew up with an eargasum.
These guys are legends
Mr Black, you crushed the vocals to super-criticality. You're a public menace. Don't ever change.
Love love love you tenacious d!!!
The sheer joy of being alive.
I for one say; 'who needs Helena Christensen'. Also me 'i do!'😆
sorry boys coreys version was so much better
that's the god like "fuck you" status for life! enjoy your life and love yourself!
sex is dead
imagine being at the beach and seeing 2 older men, one of them looking like jack black, doing this. awesome
These are 2 true red-blooded American men. 🫡
amazing  -- why just partial cover? wheres the full version
They are lovely brothers, a true brotherhood!
This is beautiful and majestic, can we please get a full version, Tack så mycket. lol

One word. AMAZING 👏
Why is this so hypnotic 😂
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
stunning cinematography

LMAOOOO WTF
Mesmerizing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Body Positivity Level 100.000
Can you just imagine being there on the beach randomly trying to enjoy your day and then you see these two old fat assed men running through the waves with the biggest smiles on their face and one of them just wearing their tighty whities??   The world needs to have more of their energy!
To bad there lefty bootlicking cucks. Freethinkers are real men
JACK DO THE FULL FUCKING COVER FOR FUCK SAKE
If this isn't the visual definition of unbridled joy, I don't know what is. You simply can't help but smile...🙂🙂🙂 Thank you Tenacious D!
Tenacious D, the best band today!!
not so bad...... just funny....;)
So i hate to say it but when these 2 are gone. This is what we are gunna remember.   Those faces of pure enjoyment is what we are gunna remember.
Love it
This is art.
THE GREATEST BAND TO WALK THIS EARTH 🤘
Two national treasures in one video
I still have a dream about a second movie
Is that where Kyle Gass keeps his guitar?
Wödklasse
F*cking awesome. The intro is little bit more great as the rest.
Every time I find myself feeling down, I come back to this video, and it never fails to lift my spirits. It's like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, and I can't thank you enough for sharing this. The positivity and joy in this video are truly infectious. 😊💕 Keep spreading the good vibes!
Вот как нужно встречать старость
One of .you favourite romance songs. You smashed this part
It's like baywatch all over again 😂😂
Wtf 😁😁
Not only are they funny but amazing musicians and singers and they don't take themselves to serious so they can enjoy life. Huge fan for life, love these guys!
In the end, only moments will remain...
ahhhh, love..........who needs a feminist?
Ive been thinking about this for months. Almost every day. luvvies
The man can sing....
They've never looked sexier.
J'adore toujours autant la musique de ce groupe, ils ont toujours the pic of destiny !
Fan since the first time wonder boy first came out. i liked jack black as an actor but love him more as a singer.
O instrumental dessa musica que é maravilhoso ❤❤
You guys are nut cakes man, I love it.

Perfect 💔
They are huge ❤
The Year of the D!

Watching you two running on that beach makes me wish I could run along a beach too :(
Shame they didnt do the vocals
cine
Wtf
how dare you make me laugh while i'm crying
Just one word... Majestic
so graceful
JACK! AND JB!!! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!! I feel if we met back in the day you would have a 3rd member!!! anyway I would love for you both to collaborate with the Gorillaz!!! it would be epic! I know that you were in the video for Humility by them but to do an actual Collab would be epic!!!!  just a thought! love you guys!!
Meu deus....to rindo demais...Jack Black é foda
Not gonna lie this is beautiful.
osos maduros
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA HAHAHA
Best, but i can't stop laughing .. whatta do ?
That's the most running they have done in years.😆
Every day I wake up and realize that I'm not married to Jack Black. I love my husband though. BUT MAN!
Great singing!
Fkin masterpiece. Please do Radiohead's creep
i miss her, with her nipples falling down :(
damn this slaps
what’s the name of the original song? pardon my negligence
Dragon warrior
we  all wish we could enjoy life even 1/4 as much as JB and KG do.
We need a full version of this song..
We want a full version! ❤
Hasselhoff ain't got half the bounce of these two! 🤩
Great cover-  Retort: the OG song was so beautiful that every good cover is an amazing cover no matter what.  Tenacious D delivered masterfully!
Coming from 'Tribute' to Wicked game is just pure bro-mance. Love this! 🔥🔥🔥
This isn't a cover...its a tribute
Bigger version, PLEASE!
Please don't have heart attacks, you must live forever.
Love the singing. They are adorable <3
I knew a guy that was in the Marines and one day I saw him exercising.  Later I said to him, 'hey, I saw you jogging earlier.'  He looked at me and said, 'fat men's bellies jog, I run.'  This video clarifies his point.
whole song pls :*
My favorite song now.
crazy guys))
Perfect 😁
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🪔🪔🪔🪔🪔
🤣😅😔😑😢😢😢😢.
heckin` MASTERPIECE!
I'm not sure if you will ever read this. But thank for for this video, it has done alot for me.
Two fat guys running in the surf!! Inspiring 😂🥴 musical interpretation of a great song.. AWESOME
YES!
I just realized they both finished the main quest and all side quests in their lives, now they are just exploring what else is there to do...
Вы просто невообразимые 😊!!!
Они такие счастливые
This video and song has a powerful message. It's open my mine and gave me new out look of what the universe is.
Make a longer version!
I hope he loses some weight hosing JBles would be a tragedy for everyone
This makes my heart smile and I’m a little chubbed.
🎉
Am I the only one who loves this song, but finds the video, "Ha-"bear"-rious?  But, seriously, "Just do you Boo".   "Follow your joy".
Jack Blacks voice is slept on.Because he is funny and messes around a lot he doesn't get the credit for being a bloody good vocalist.This cover rocks
Y'all killed it in Franklin the other night. My wife and I celebrated our 21st anniversary and came to see you guys. Kage killed that recorder solo, and Jack you brought some high energy my man. You have amazing talent. Rock on!
chris isaak is crying when look at this after his wet hugh with that hit girl from his video :)
Currently heartbroken after my ex walked away and this sing has been glued in my head for 2 weeks now
Legends
Nice
Watch those packages jiggle
LOVE❤
Chris Isaak is impressed - masterpiece 🤩
Amazing
Just seen them preform this live lastnight it was amazing ❤
Chubs, chubs, CHUBS.....💓
Tenacious D is like wine, the older it gets the better it gets
Yes, yes and yes!
It sounds like he has peanut butter in his mouth while he's singing.
Love you so! Thank you for your joyful spirits 😊❤
- So how can we make the most awesome video of all times? - mmm... How about the two of us running on the beach in our underwear? - That should do the trick🤩
While I LOVE a leopard onesie, I wanna see the version where Jack B is wearing jeans, a cowboy hat, and a sassy glare staring you downnnnnn because that voice is serious business. #Sensualeeeeeee
Tenacious D 2 the D is back please make a second movie love u guys
American Dream 😂
Holy fucking god, never did I think my two favourite artists would be combined
Joke bands better than real bands much of the time nowadays
"I don't need a microphone cos my voice is f***ing POWERFUL!!"
I could listen to these guys cover songs all day.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anybody else realize that this is a semi continuation of their music video for you never give me your money/the end?🤣🤣🤣
Such a tease. I need MOAR
One of the few examples of the cover being better than the original. Nice work guys! Would give anything to hear a full version though.😊
I am here cause my Corazon brought me here ❤
Best music video
Bowser is singer now? (JK i cant take the voice out of that turtle)
You see the video and wonder how you can take these guys seriously, then they play/sing. Like what???🤯🤩
Love this Jack black your the goat
This reminds me what music is really about
Coulda made it big as a legit singer but i love everything they have done!!
is that natural Kage or he got a cucumber in there?
This is a master blaster
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE cover the whole song guys!
COVER THE WHOLE SONG
We live in a society where if a normal person does this, it’s weird. But if jack black does this, it’s funny as hell
Véio sacudo da porrra kkkkkkk
this song made me feel the closest to being in heaven
1000 mal besser als das original
The look of sheer joy on their faces as they gleefully skip through the waves has made me reinterpret my life. Why can't I be that happy about anything?
This is how it felt having my 2011 RRMS diagnosis wrongfully recanted  in 2018....now i have PPMS...
how many socks were sacrificed for this masterpiece?
People think that old age is boring:  Me and my friends in old age:
It's the same picture!
This needs to be a lot lot longer.
I ADORE Jack Black's voice! Love this so much <3
J adore ce mec,belle découverte merci
Kyle looks like Santa on vacation
❤
How has no one mentioned Kage's package.  Holy Wah!
Poetry in motion.
Bring out an album solely on covers please!
Your versions is WONDERFUL!  Make this song longer PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Audition reel for Bill and Frank in The Last of Us
I am literally in tears here.
이형들 너무좋다
Absolutely beautiful 🤩...the vocals!!🎉
Glad Kage convinced Jables the band was worth it. Best buds.
As a gay guy who's into bears and chubby dudes... yeah, this clip is great in more ways than just the musical one.
Love u Jablinski  because platonic love can exist between two grown men: Wayne's World
С любовью из России!
So much power here.
Idk but this clip make me so sad and i wanna cry
Excellent twingy twangy and bassy bass 🍇🍇🍇
🍇🍇🍇
I heard it like 30 times in a row and still have goosebumps (I hope they‘ll go away again haha) I love how Jack‘s voice aged with the years and hope we have left a lot to hear in the future of our beloved rockstar teddybears❤ By the way it would be sooo fukin awesome to have a full version of this cover 🔥
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is so good, just wish it was longer
Those two mins make me realize again that we need a 4k release of „The Pick of Destiny“
World needs a whole version of this 💯
never ever in my life i felt two minutes so short
What a cool guy
I love how as soon as I first discovered this song these mofos drop this 🤣
Have you guys ever visited Newfoundland, Canada? It occurred to me recently that I think you guys would love the sense of humor here and in our music. That might even be why I love what you guys do so much; it's so playful and unapologetic, it reminds me of better times, and of how things ought to be.  PS: If you're ever interested, I legit know the perfect place to get screeched in! ;)
This video must've cost a fortune
yoOOOOO KG'S PACKING
best music out there
Eternal!
Protect Jables and Kage at all costs
The is what peak masculinity looks like
When you feel sad, just listen to this dudes, then you don't feel sad anymore 🤩🤣
❤❤❤❤ I only dream of having this much fun. Keep slaying
kyle makes me ugly laugh
Needs to be a full unplugged version
i cried alittle
Run Nacho run
The world needs short remakes of songs done by Tenacious D like....weekly.
Thank you for releasing this ! I can’t wait for more magic for my ears 🥰
PLEASE DROP AN ALBUM PLEASE
damn kj i wanna see that master exploder
How many mushrooms were y'all on? See it in the eyes! 😂😂😂
Damn damn damn... i am mesmerized.
Sooo, Bad...... 🥰😍🤩
I've watched this so many times...
I don't deserve it ! But a full version of this would be amazing!
Hey Jack, can you sing the song Biggerring? It sounds like your style.
Perfection! I love these guys. I need moooore!
Longer version please 🤩🤩🤩
I had to watch a Domino's ad to watch this.  #irony #lossofappetite
Каждый раз улыбка до ушей)
just dudes having a good time love it
i want what THEY'RE having!!! silly boys . . .♥
Jack you are god😊
People rave about JB's vocals, rightly; but Kyle Gass is such a damn good guitarist.
The only problem with this song is that it's too short
🤣🤣 pure winning lol.
Jack black for rdr movie soundtrack and as a character 🤣🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for that.
🤣😂💥
It only crossed my mind now that JB dyes his hair, lol
Thanks ❤
Gosh, its like The Pixies video all over again (kidding).
Browser sing'n Wicked Game
This was amazing! I wish they did the whole thing...like how can u do that to us? Leaving us on cliffhanger? Limbo? Purgatory? For how long? Masters tell us please? 😂😂😂😂
Oh my God they are so funny and talented!!!!
The unitard JB is wearing here was made out of an actual outfit that David Lee Roth wore in the 1986 Yankee Rose video.
This was amazing. Perfect Nostalgia
I fucking love you guys!! 😍 😂❤
Боже, как охуенно! Зачёт мужикам
If this is wrong I don’t want to be right.
Some things never change... and I love that
Eddie Hall and Brian Shawn vibes
This song didnt pull my heart strings it ripped it out along with my soul and scrambled it in a blender then baked it at 450 for 2 min. Slapped some butter on it and punched it back into my chest. I can still taste the melted butter.......that guitar riff in the beginning? Faulkn whaaaahhhhh.....and jack blacks voice.......ahhhmerrrhhgaaaawsh...
🫣😮🫨🥺😱😭🥹😭😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹😱😭😭🥹🥴🫠😶‍🌫️💨🕳🫶
1993/1994 literally every time I walked into the students union the Chris Isaak version was playing. This is much better. Thanks TD.
Woah this fricken beautiful
Kinda disappointing, was expecting and excited for the whole song. Still gold. Definitely love this lot than words have meaning..
Santa on his holiday with his hard rocking elf😂
🤣🤣🤣 great cover and a fantastic funny video
you are both idiots, and i love you both.
pure happiness
this is how i dream of the afterlife being like
My wife has just blocked my Amazon account, due to my desire to wear white speedos... Coolest video, right now... NB11.
это самое красивое и чистое видео которое я когда либо видел
The fact that when Jack shoulder checks that wave it splits it around Kage so hes barely affected makes it 1000x better on a already flawless song and video
Did I immediately look down and see Kyle's junk bouncing around? ...Yes, yes I did.
I’m so ready to see you guys!!!
Love you Tenatious D
Bro Jack's voice is amazing! We need more of this.
We want another movie
It makes me happy seeing Jack black seek his true happiness. I wish I could do the same……
Masterpiece
This is such a tease.. I LOVE IT, Full verson? <3
Rage Cage is majestic as f@ck
Please more!!! We LOVE The D!!!
There awesome😂👍
Request. I would LOVE to hear The D do Don’t Stop Me Now by Queen
Good man. 🙂Václav
I love you guys 💯❤ Growing up I didn't have my bother around but the memories I have of him was when he showed me the pick of destiny ❤
Tenacious D 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
This is so beautiful
I've just ran about my garden in my boxers..... An absolute gem for the beer belly community... x
jack black taking a hold on 2023
Why dose he sound so good😮
Some talented rotund gentlemen right there.
Almost cried in a few places. The crystal pure power he put behind his voice..."How bout the power to move people...that do anything for you?" You moved me Jack ❤
I know there are a lot of things to talk about with this cover, but on my most recent re-listen, it's Rage Kage's playing that stood out. The guitar tone and subtlety in his performance is incredible. Somehow the notes sound so succinct and crystal clear while still invoking a distant, echo-y element. It's hard to describe....forlorn, present, but fleeting. Bravo.
gotta watch this every time i need to refill my soul
This makes me think of the axis of awesome, may we get a moment of silence for our fallen soldier 😢
Hahahhaaa…. Muito bom!!!
They need to wear "Bros" for extra support!...LMAO!! Awesome performance!!  TD is sooo underrated.
I love u Jack u really make my days easier I have this on repeat u can really sing my Dude! #SchoolofRock
And that’s how I met your mother
I thought it was Jack and his dad running through the water, sorry Cage, dude...
I love this version😑🎧🤙
Is it me or does the inertia of Kyle Gass's bulge suggest that he is carrying around an eating challenge sized pizza dough package down there?
After the thousandth watch.. I just got Mr Marsh Tegridy vibes. I imagine him frolicking with the Boys! Livin his best life!
Mr Gass!
This world is only gonna break your heart. ❤
Lmao wtf.
Genios totales, ame ver como disfrutan!!!!
This is amazing ❤❤❤
cheapest  music video in history^^
Tenacious D are on their own lane,a rock duo that can be funny and serious is vocals in music is just pure gold. Truly originality at its best.
Please cover creep
Jack's face at the end says it all 😂👑s
Please for the love of god release a full song 😂 because i really like this, props to chris isaac but this fucking rocks.
total freedom...
Majestic... doesn't even begin to describe this. Kyle, Jack, never stop being you
I’ll always love and adore Jack Black.
Why is this actually just a good cover?
If there was ever a time for a love button...
Daaaaamn
Gloriously untainted joyfulness 👌
This......this right here...is exactly what the World needs!!!!
Straight up STUDS
JB & KG live up to their band name, fo sho! ❤
Disgusting :/
I Like this number better than the Chris Isaak version, Jack black just have this wonderful voice!.
😢 gives me chills bro talent yal pure talent
If they want to release a couple cover albums I'd listen to them
🥰🥰 beautiful 🤘
somethings wrong, they myth says there was only one Aphrodite born from seas foam...
KG killed this on guitar.
Chris Isaak would be proud to see this
Imagine being their age and beloved by so many people after all these years
Lovely!!  ❤❤❤
Jack's Bowser voice really paid off.
Why do old people get that split belly what is that
Jack Black is living proof that women really do appreciate charisma
Genius
افلام سكسيه
I can't stop watching....AHHHHHHH its perfection
Please Tenacious D, please do a full version of this song!!!
Im Pleasing for the Fullversion
HAHAHA!!!  Would love to hear Tenacious D's cover of Conway Twitty's "It's Only Make Believe"! You guys would... T...E...A...R      I...T      U...P...!!!
Love the "witchu" at the end lol
KG's Santa costume is really coming along
This is hot❤  Im so ready to rock❤
how is there so much comedy and truth to it at the same time?
We absolutely need extended version of this!
i first made love to this song
in german: genau so !!!
There might be a little too much of the D in this video!
I always come here when on whiskey.
Majestic
This is so funny, but don't let that distract you...  this is an amazing performance you are listening
I love this beautyfool Video and Song, it makes me happy ❤
this world is only gonna make you laugh
The dudes are amazing at producing music I wish there was more and dang it they need another movie or 4 😊
top G video
Awesome
Oh god!!!! I love this band!!
man, tell me the Rage Cage isn't getting side work as santa somewhere
Tenacious D is a gift from god no doubt!
Sing 3😂
Young souls
lol  S T R A N G E R   D A N G E R  You guys absolutely  SLAYED this!!!
Where did you get your swim suit ?
Witchu...
this is way to short :(
Best Video of 2023
A pleasure for the eyes and ears
형들 좋아 보여서 다행이야
Rip Alex Hicks.  I know you would love this bro..
Was having a bad day….. I’m good
If I had known Tenacious D wasn't a rap group I'd have checked it out sooner. Good work guys, good music and a fun spin on a heavy song that does work.
I need a 1.10x speed version of this.
This is something I never knew I needed in my life but I did
Fucking more. Please realise how legendary you are. You are two true heroes
😂
🤘🏽
this feels weird... no
Chris isaak smiles upon thy ❤
That looks cold.
" The most beautiful song in the world"
Male peak performance <3
Talented on another level! Keep it coming.
Can you double like something on the interweb?
Best Bromance ever!
I want the full song god fucking damn it
Damn kg got some low hanging fruit
This wasn't long enough ❤
Noice.
I want to be that happy. Amazing!
Tenacious is the next MeatLoaf!❤❤
sooooooooooooooooo sexy
the cover is great and i love to hear it🎶  i think a tenacious d cover of chicago - „if you leave me now“ would be nice too 🎧😊
This made me smile. Thank you Tenacious D
❤❤❤😁❤❤❤
Never been to a concert, ever,  and I've waited what feels like a lifetime to see Jack on stage. He'll finally be in Franklin on Sept 7th. Of course I can't afford to go. Life has a funny way of being problematic lol. I can't wait to see clips floating around here on YT though. I know he's going to blow everyone's mind. He never disappoints.
I need the whole version.  This is soooooo good!!
I NEED A FULL VERSION
That was a challenging wank
This gave me extremely strong Rosemary vibes by Foo Fighters. I know ya’ll collaborated before so perhaps there is still continuous inspiration?
Thanks again, these two goofballs have helped me through a lot the last year. ✊
Jack Black doesn't get enough credit for just how talented and skilled of a singer he is.
Awesome on a whole new level.
please can we have a extended version this is perfect...
We need a long version
Is this natgeo ? Cuz i see two poo running at the beach
man could have been huge if he didnt feel like making it a joke all the time lol. amazing voice
бля, Джек и Кайл, вы настолько крутые, я из-за вас купил себе гитару, и научился играть большенство ваших песен, это круто!!! РОК!!!!!
My brother Kyle here is hung
Heart strings 😭 here's me thinking London grammar was a peak experience.
Pls full song
Wish this was the whole song
The beauty of this: you can enjoy and appreciate the concept with or without prior knowledge of the original Chris Isaak video. You can view it as a parody/tribute or simply two goofs running on the beach in their undies and its great either way
they fr got huge junks
Brutal cover. Poor Chris Isaak
Really wish they covered the entire song because this shit is fucking insanely good
What a beautiful way to share a 20 second run
we need ful version of this PLEASE
Full Length Song for everyone wanting it    https://youtu.be/rwH314yS9cU  And people who’ve been enjoying it might also enjoy Stone Sours Cover on it https://youtu.be/E3DwWhV6Ps8 Corey Taylor crushes it imo and it’s amazing to see his range from this to his vocal work in Slipknot it’s just crazy one guy has that much talent   And obviously for anyone who’s unfamiliar with the Original By Chris Isaak I’ll link that right here as theirs a reason it’s been covered by multiple higher profile musicians/bands  https://youtu.be/oadhHk2xs6c
Me hubiese gustado que sea más larga. Realmente me encantó. ❤️🎶
FIREEEE 😍😍😍
I've been listening to this cover almost daily since it came out. I really hope there is a longer version on their upcoming album.
jb and kg foeva
That's the Body Positivity i want to hear!
Yes 🦀 🌊
Give us a full gold old album with covers of old gold songs 🙏🏻 That voice should be in stadiums.
The beauty brought me to salty tears.
This is the best thing I have seen in my entire life. The pure joy. The unrepentant happiness. The biting of the thumb towards doldrums. The celebration of a fleeting moment. I submit that this should be included in the library of congress. When I reflect upon the joy that life can articulate, I shall think of these one hundred and nine seconds of film.
This song hits close to home
Seriously, hands down, one of the best covers ever!
So glad i heard you guys cover this song 4 weeks before i saw u live in london last month ❤️ best gig i’ve even been to and this song is 1,000,000% better with the jack blacks voice amd kyles guitar sexyness 👌🏻
The big dick energy from this is insane. Love you all so much.
Any chance of the full song coming out? 👀
I need a full version of this now
When I’m feeling a little down, I just listen to this song by you guys. It puts things into perspective for some reason, wish I could better explain but all I can really do is say thank you. 😌
This song should’ve been 5 minutes long…. So I don’t have to keep replaying it as much
These guys look absolutely delighted. I guess 'wicked' means "Wicked Good!"
The original pales in comparison ❤
I smiled the whole time. If this doesn't bring world peace, nothing ever will!
two almost naked fat guys running across a beach to a sad music can never be funny Tenacious D: Hold my beer
then: kidz bop now: jacks bop
Jack Black is so fucking underappreciated as a singer. The range on that man is insane.
Reminds me a lot of Mad World by Gary Jules AND So Good by Stick Figure. Dig it, we need the full length version!
@Vsouce🎉 0:23
If you watch this every morning, sure to keep you smiling all day :D
man what a voice
Chills.....literally Chills
You'll always have a place to crash if you're ever in North Alabama. Just look for the man that has the sun and the moon caressing his face. Check out the haunted house we Monster for and hang out mang.
It’s beautiful
Where is the next album?
This kind of energy...  This... This is the Tenacious D we all need back.😎👍.
here I am again
I love how this video was foreshadowed by a song they did talking about friends running in the sand like 10+ years ago.
this is so tribute
Beautiful song
TY D MATTY
Damn.  In some ways it's better than mine :D
If you don't have a big grin from ear to ear watching this you have issues
KG looks like he is about to die at the end.
i saw a lot of things i should not see
I just found this channel, Chibson USA - they're really funny and really dedicated. Not only that, dudes? But the production values are pretty tight, y'all!  I don't know them. I don't need them. This affects me not a smidge. But I really think that my fellow TD fans would really like them. So go! NOW!
Time for my daily listen to what is the third greatest song in the world
Would love to hear you guys sing Sound of Silence
I thought watching the waves roll in was the most relaxing thing ever until I saw KG's belly. I could watch this for hours!
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jNvz_EJaMlk
Jack you are a frikend god!!!!! Your voice is fucking awesome
Please give the world the full song 💗 I love this version SO much & want it in my life on repeat for weeks 😍
- You're old and fat, no one will look at you ! - sorry, what do you mean ?
I have to play this song twice in a row because it’s to short
i musta watched this half a hundred times already and only just noticed Kage is wearing the same underwear as the chick from the original
This cover is part of my routine before work
How do I unsee this 😂😂😂😂
Классные ПУЗАНЫ !
bahahaha... this is absolutely amazballs!!...   love it..   can youz guys please please do a cross over vid with @theslowmoguys  (gav an dan)...  after watching this vid... maybe doing a running ..."hehe running".. jumping chest/belly bump... in super slow mo.. haha ..  .. the 4 of you together would be super crazy chaos i rekin.
OMG I can only imagine what the ladies think of you..... You got me over here all dreamy smiling with your dreaming 😂
The video is filled with awesomeness!!! 😂😂😂😂  And thus makes the song even more awesome.. 🤣🤣
So majestic!
haha that is dope
This is life goals right there, to just mess around without a care in the world
omg his voice is amazing tho
Whats the original?
The brotherhood bond they have ❤
im so happy to see these two again!  their music is by far out of this world!
I need a longer version of this!
If this isn't nice, I don't know what is. 🥺
Greatest band that ever done seen the the rays of the sun.
Tom Bombadil and Farmer Maggot sure were best of friends.
Awesome
Man, I miss drugs.
Sole tolk
OMG!!!!... soooo fucking good
i need more please
When i hear the word "Bromance". It is impossible to think of anyone else. Than these two.
Tenacious D and Tom Ellis should do a Duett with this Song!
Take a moment of relaxation With the coolest band ever
Love it🤟
It' the out of tune guitar at the start that had me snort-laughing
This is absolutely the best thing I`ve ever seen. Also, did anyone notice the sequins on Kyle`s bathing suit? You can only see it by the end of the video when you can see it closer. Absolutely loved it!
This is incredibly wholesome
Второй лайк не поставить, поставлю тут 👍
so damn good 🤯
Man Jack can sing
I need a 10hr loop of this, mesmerized!
His voice, I’m obsessed with. Acoustic guitar. Sounds ultrasonic. Divinely masculine 💙
i very much like this
How gracefully your bellies bounce!
This song ain't long enough
criminally short
Need a longer version.
Seeing KG snd JB still goofing around together being best buds really warms the heart.
JB and KG! THE BEST BOYS!
And here I thought he was running to me..but it was the girl behind me🤷🏼‍♀️..I just can’t “which you”😂
Kyle should change his name to Arby’s cause he’s got the meat. Jack, not so much.
WTF did I just watch?
что за жесткий стеб)
There is something oddly satisfying about this video...
What a wicked game to play To make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do  To make me dream of you  What a wicked to say You never felt this way What a wicked thing to do To make make me dream of you And I don’t want to fall in love No I don’t want to fall in love With you… Nobody loves no one. ❤️‍🩹
Damn kage got a hogg
hey tanshis d  i think you should make a song about kyle cas
I NEED more Jack Black movies!! We miss you Jack! Nachoooooooo ❤❤❤  Also, you and Kyle are AMAZING musicians! Can't get enough of that incredible voice!!
Total greatness
My god, I'm tearing up! 👍
bliss
Ok
It's look like a good Charlie Chaplin whis good sound, ty for the happiness.  Merci messieurs, from  Paris.
FINALLY!!! A song that properly expresses the feeling I get each time I snuggle my cat.
He did the bendy every once in a while!
❤❤❤
I can't know the truth but I like to imagine those two had great lives & great friendship
TEMON
I couldn't belive in my ears... The gods of metal are back.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Unirocally my favorite versio
Super disturbing and amazing in the same time 😂
Nonsense. Lol! Jack Black seems like a cool funny guy.
Never thought a Tenacious D song of all songs would make me cry lmao
For sure Iove tenacious D
🌜🌟🌛
lovely children playing in god's tender embrace..✨
Please please please full version!!!!❤
I like the talent
this is the most tenacious thing the D has ever done.
Shame  its not longer
I was feeling down & depressed then I watched this .I feel much better now .  Brilliant. To quote Springsteen ( " It aint no sin to be glad your alive " ).
I used to think the Chris Isaac music video of this was the sexiest video ever……not anymore.
No pueden ser tan crack! Los amo
Man I wish this was longer.  (Maybe just like 27 minutes longer would be good.)
The embodiment of best friends goal
0:40 Is this the voice actor for bowser?
Kyle gas looks like santa claus for some reason
This sounds unreal!
Jack Black has the best voice in music.
Okay I just came across this song while watching a reel on fb of a death head moth (having buffalo bill vibes for a moment lol 😂🤣) hearing this on the reel  I was like "Hang on,... That's Jack Black doing a cover!..." Sure enough Tenacious D putting there magic. I like it, hope you bring an extended version 😊👍🤙🤘
Omg 😆 love it! 🎉
Blue print to true happiness
This is positively beautiful.
The two greatest humans to walk the earth ❤
Poetry in motion
This is on a different level than im used to with Tenacious D. And im here for it. I would like a full rendition though please. 1.49 isnt enough for a song like this.
If Chris didn’t write this song, part of me feels like Tenacious D would’ve released exactly this! 1:50 seconds long too😂😂
Son - "why is my sisters name Rose?"  Me - "because your mother loves roses" Son - "thanks dad" Me - " no problems Wicked Game - Tenacious D"
ماشاءالله تبارك الله ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Uffff amazing, please a complete version 🙏
bjuutiful
i hope i have the young, carefree, childlike spirit these two show when i get to their age.

Jajajajajaj geniossss
Exteremly cheap song avoid it

Охх ребята вы великолепны, даже ваши ремиксы всегда имеют потрясающую душу, спасибо Вам за ваше творчество.
Yes boys!
esta mejor que la original.. jack black tiene mucha potencia en la voz
Seriously. I am a huge fan of covers and this is probably in my top 3 now.
Why isn’t this song longer
0:08
Bowser's breakup song
Idiots
no seriously when full version?
Who ever for that fleeting instant ever thought they would see Jack Black running in the surf fat and happy-I sure as hell didn't,and it made my day!!!!
Just saw Jack Black in the movie the cable guy and wanted to listen to tenacious d like I was in high school again. Almost forgot about them
Honestly, these two guys are amazing. I feel like they have gotten better with age. Almost like a calm, high energy. I can’t wait for more.
Holy shit he is packin
Wit Chu 🤣
Bro, Kage Rage is packin’ 👀
Amazing wow I love it
They really need to make a POD Sequel...
I love this so much. FYI my three year old says you guys look buff.!!!
So much better than the original 90’s video 😍
Happy free individuals. What a wonderful place we'd all be. If.
I've listened to this 70 times, then I finally watch the video and die laughing. What is this? 🤣 Such a somber song then I see two talented men frolicking through the ocean
What a F*cking voice that man has!!! Unbelievable 🙏🏻
This duo is the best. Blows my mind. PLEASE make a full cover of this. Truly masters og the musical arts.
Excellent 😂😂😂
Majestic
My body your body!!! amazing song!!!!
My only wish for this song it was a full cover of it.
❤
I am 1000-bazillion-hundred-2% sure Chris Isaak *loves* this cover!
One of the only songs that is to short. 🎶🎶🤣I will see you both in Charlotte. 💛
Always loved these dudes
D Forever
I would like a full length cover of this song please. It's been stuck in my head for weeks but the original just doesn't hit like this one.
omg this just cuts right through me. the song always made me feel something but the D just gave it a new profoundness. I love you JB and KG, please keep making albums and touring! <3
It's weird knowing it's Jack singing, I share his name, yet his voice is still so good for singing. You'd never know how fkin funny he is if you only learned about him through this song lol.
Please release a full length version so I can jam in the car
My only problem with this song.    It ends
Kyle and Jack, you are my heroes, keep doing you.  You are making the world a great place and era to be alive
Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches
We need more!! The whole song and more average, middle aged men running around a beach in bathing suits!!
"I don't wanna fall in love. Witchu.."😂
The gods have spoken 😂
❤‍🔥
Beautiful
I’m glad that you guys are getting all this mainstream attention! Me and my dad love to watch the tenacious D show and we are huge fans. It would be awesome if you could make a season 2 after 20 years. Love you guys!
I love you guys. I recently went to a bachelor party and all my friends and I sung the entire pick of destiny set in order. Jables and KG have a special place in my heart

Love this song, wish it was longer!!! 🔥🤘🤘😈

Pure friendship
Bold move, lads!

When you're proud of your body, and anyone else's opinion can go fk themselves.
No, but seriously, where’s the rest of it?!  It’s too good. There must be more!

Jack Black has one of the best voices in Entertaiment. He can Rock it on Broadway.
I love their movie

I wish you would have done the entire song. You rock ❤
I listen to this once a day

HAHA loves it, sounds better than the original, but the whole 30 second beach clip put in slo-mo was funny as.
i need a full cover
this is a epic song and song cover i herd the the starting cords and smiled
I mean, how has all the world's problems not immediately disintegrated to dust in the immediate aftermath of this release?

Yeah. I looked down. I am not ashamed.

They're in their 50-60's and still have silly fun like they were a couple of young fools and i inspire to still have that energy at that age, They're just having a blast and nothing else honestly
This is kind of hypnotic.  I don‘t know how often I‘ve seen this in the last days, dozens of times…
GIVE US MOAARRRR. ITS HIGH TIME FOR TENACIOS D 2 THE BONG OF DESTINY
Temazo! (a spanish word to say "f*cking big song")
Can even make a grown man cry🤣
♥
!this doesnt look healthy but sure is fun! lol keep up!
I've found, at long last, a way to bear hearing this song.
this is a serious song and a perfect cover .... why does jb need to turn it into a joke?
Omg this is sick
Can I report this for being TOO AWESOME!? My dad would have loved this. He's the one that got me into Tenacious D. I love ya dad, I miss ya buddy. Thanks guys for making such a kick ass childhood for me and great memories I get to have with my dad.
great version of this song and hilarious video.
I can NOT get enough of you guys! Please keep giving us more, more, MORE!!!!
versión completa yaaaaa
The aspect ratio says it all. You've been a Hollywood man for years and it reflects in everything you do Jack.
KG & JB are such majestic creatures.
Great song. Great band. Keep it up tenacious d
🙌
This is not the greatest song in the world, no. This is just a trailer!
wiged game
that switch up in the guitar riff is ungodly

Just two old boys making music and having fun. Nothing more nothing less.
Probably the best thing to happen in the past 3 years.
I miss the nights when Art Bell would roll out or back in to or from a commercial with the opening guitar to this song. Those were some great nights.  This video makes me too happy to be depressed by the great passage of time since those Coast to Coast AM road trips.
Look at KGs right hand. He can never let go of the pick...always carries it.
Gosh dang-it this brought a tear to eyes.
Either we get those things off or we get a full version, pick one!
Jablez and Rage Cage are just the pinnacle of human physique. A true testament of awesomeness!
Why is it so short??? I need more of this!!!
So good 🙏

I have to admit that was one of the sexiest things I've ever seen, prime man beef on display - it almost turned me....

That voice is something special

wish this was longer
We need a full version of this ! Truly amazing !
Only Tenacious D could make me watch a video of old men in their underwear, and then rewatch it 😂
After two weeks still intact the glorious feeling of press play. Long live the "D".
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
To jest takie piękne!
Daaamnnnn too short 😢
The D in Tenacious D is evidently a big one. Them boys be packin

I love These guys
The best baywatch i have ever watched! :D Absolutely stunning! :)
Thus is art!
Those are two handsome lads 😘
Tenacious D is the fucking cure for depression.
Literally had this on repeat all day, wished this was longer
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Better than the original for real🫡
Goated
best than baywatch
They actually covered one of the songs from my favorite band 🥲  Update: just found out this song isn’t originally made by three days grace
Baywatch 2024
Jack...Kyle...Thank you❤
In all seriousness if he did attempt to sing this song seriously it would work....
It totally sucks because it's too fucking short! JB you fucker what a manly voice god damn
Love!  ❤
The amount of times I’ve watched this? ….. YES!  Honestly gives me the biggest grin I love it so much ❤
I'm sure most people understand how talented he is as a vocalist, but if you're a singer, I think it hits you differently.
As a Japanese who can't understand the lyrics without having them written down, I don't know what emotion I should have for this, which suddenly came up as a recommendation.😂
such beautiful creatures
how can I get this out of my head, maybe please but no xxx
You're gay if you don't love this video of the two sexiest men on earth
That fat guy with white beard has a baby seal in his undies
What a wicked thing to do...  To make me dream of dudes
Perfection!
Amei 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Awesome. I love tenacious d
Should definitely cover the whole song it’s amazing the guitar is absolutely exquisite
This reminds me of when "Loiter Squad" (Jasper) did a version of D'Angelo's "How Does It Feel" and now I can't unsee either version!
Listen... be greatful we get to live in the same time period as Jack Black and Kyle Gass.
Genius! Brillliance! Period. End of story. You can't even argue with me. That is just the fact, Jack!
Amazing cover
Why can't i look away??
This is art
SO GLAD TENACIOUS D IS FUCKIN BACK!! Not that you ever went anywhere.
shit, i cant give more than one thumb up. :/
Can we get shirts with this? Just a random frame of this video, don't really care which one. Thanks <3
I laughed, I cried, I, fist bumped the air!
Hot af🔥🥵
Whatever happens in future guys. Thank you. I was in love from the Pick of Destiny and I still love you guys.
Best mv ever. Love t d.
love it so much !!!
Bro how he got big.........
I can't stop listening!
Fuck man, can't come tonight. Dad's in A&E. Play the hell out of the show boys and please come back to London quickly
Probably the very best thing on the internet.
Is this some sort of curse that you guys can only bring out bangers? Because i never heard a song with such joy, it's just amazing
One of the absolute best covers of all fucking time. Full body chills every time.
Living their best life. Love it.
Too short by far. The original by Chris Isaak is one of those performances where you don't think someone could do a better or credible alternative version, but TD have just proved that they can do a performance that matches in quality, which is high praise.
Damnnn this is so good! 😲 Hope they will make full song... 👌🙏
Masteripiece!  Love you guys. Changed my life
They jiggle like the most majestic of jello's
Make a longer version!!!!!!
the fascinating relationship between comedy and sadness
I can’t wipe the smile off my face 🤣🤣
Why is this soooo damn INCREDIBLE!
I cried in happiness and pure love…

Holy shit this is so good
Once again, sex sells.

We want fucking more .
Im dying ❤
That moment when you realize what they are wearing
Best thing i seen in years😂😂😂
Reminds me of the first time I saw Chariots of fire as a Young boy 😂... Tenacious D fears not your judgment! I've loved these dudes as long as I can remember.
It’s like watching two stallions run free🖤
My god his voice is incredible
We need the full song now… we are not worthy 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
We need a longer version ASAP
Muito bom,...
Dankjewel!! from Rottterdam
Now this is art
What colour was the boat?
This is better than the original ❤
Ihr seid echt die Besten 🙂👌
Listening to Jack singing here, I have to use one of my favorite quotes: “Well sweet mother Theresa on the hood of a Mercedes Benz! You sound like a majestic f#cking eagle!”
The goats🤘
Very very good.
2 bears 1 beach
LONGER
Sexy
Tenacious D cover album would fucking slap, love this.
yes full song please <3
Are they going on a 'Bear Cruise '...?
Hope these two enjoy their time in life at its fullest. They look like soul mates. It will be really sad when they have to part ways.
This is so beautiful, I put down both Twinkies and just basked in TD's radiance.
This is so fantastic. I now crave the full version.
My crush on Jack Black is eternal. 🔥🩷
Magnificent!
Funny, beautiful, simplicity.
so much happy in one short video, i love it.
This is for Lily
Don't. Ever. Change. I love you guys
my life has meaning again!!!
Jack, would you do the whole song please? 😍
Those pipes, man. Angelic. Booming. Unreal.
One of the most beautiful songs sung by some of the most beautiful men
If humans can make something as beautiful as this, we can't be that bad, right?
guitar was giving me really strong Outer Wilds vibes at the beginning.
Why no mention of HIM?
Beautiful.  The song isn't bad either
Got to be one of the most lovable and talented men. God bless the guy.
His voice is amazing. I've always thought the most talented entertainers start out as comedians.
Kyle is so cute. I love those big chubby ‘daddy bear’ types! 😘
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll close your eyes but open them back up to a whole new view of everything.  You guys are great and the vocals are outstanding.  Thanks, you guys are the best.  😀✌❤
absolute banger
kyles got the package
Full version on new album I assume?
Fantastic!This should be number 1 and Longer!!!💯👌👏💥🤘😎🤘
It’s amazing how the tops of your abdomens stay so far out while the rest flops up and down. Hmm.
It's like watching Baywatch but better 😂

This put a mile-wide smile on my face.....too short, this much happiness needs to go on longer!   You f-ing clowns! 🤣 .....talented clowns because musically you nail it too.
If Cole Bennett doesn’t do a video for this then YouTube is broken.
LOL. Love it.
This may be the most beautiful thing ive ever ever seen!
The beginning sounds like the Jackass theme is about to kick in!
fantastic lol
This middle-aged hetero woman has never been so happy to see such lovely bouncing titties 😍
Baywatch Who?
I played this song more than 20 times and am still repeating it 😅
PLS PLS PLS make a full version of this!!!! This is so beautiful
Jack Black mocking his amazing voice still will always give me chills, guy has the fuckin pipes!
I thought there was no such thing as perfection only perfect intent, I was wrong
I await the 7 minute full version of this with KG's harmonies
These men are a gift to humanity 🙏
Just absolutely fantastic, so happy it was released as watched the live (& even better) version  dozens of times
Its hard to see past the joke but he unironically has a stellar voice
Am I the only one still hoping for a school of rock 2..?
We're in the timeline where Kyle is thinner than Jack???? I think it split when harambe got his wings
😍😍😂😂❣️❣️❣️
Sounds like drunken kareoke
Love it. They look so happy.
ow yeah that's hardwork♟
Why can’t this be the whole song?
🙏🏼Bands like yours conected me to music men to music men and to the Gym in a magical way
Honestly, I couldn't be arsed with the "video" cover, (unless Helena was there), but I closed my eyes and actually thought my god. All who said too short is right, I'd listen to this every day of the week and twice on Sunday
I just saw them few days ago live in Berlin with my Brothers and it was EPIC ! These two are Living Legends and it was Honour and Privilage to see them up on that stage :) wishing all the Best to them and to all of us fans of the Best Band in the World :)
Amazing cover, needed to be about three minutes longer.
I love your voice!! Great!!!
I need this in 4K
The most joyous thing I've seen this week
Я впервые вижу этот видос, почему он у меня в избранном?
Is this not just what they did live on that talk show? It doesn't sound any different and is the same length of time singing in both vids. I guess my question is what was the point of this? I mean it's great don't get me wrong but they've  done it already so why not release a full version instead or is it just a short song in general? (I don't listen to the original so I don't know)
this is one of my fav songs of all time, and for td to be making a cover of it has just made my life complete.. thank you
Is this a continuation of a story following the Beatles cover song which ends on the beach in these same outfits?
This song is soooo much better than the original !!!!! + great video :)
It's like witnessing two majestic unicorns enjoying the beach
I need a full version of this
What a wicked game to düüüüü
This has reinstated my faith in humanity's beauty
Almost 2 minutes of simply pure, raw talent
The generations Jack Black has made laugh is amazing
Just take my money, full acoustic nostalgic covers album GO!
This is the best what i see)😂
Full version please! 🙏
Kage and Jables. Friendship. Freedom. Many of us grew up with them. The happiness is pure ecstasy.
Holy Hell Tenacious D U Made A Great Gob!
i keep coming back daily for this bitter sweet 2 minute treatment
This has made my year ❤
Good lord, that voice is legendary.
Настоящие мужчики ♐dunger master♐
I need more content from Tenacious D right now😭😭💖🖤
I really hope they don’t release this absolute shite cover of a beautiful song……….it shouldn’t be aloud!!
for me they look like chiken runing
My favorite thing to do when picking a few songs at the bar was to slip in Wicked Games at some point, and watch the bar dudes lose their shit. After this, i'll never be able to think of anything else, and when I start giggling... they will know it was me. I shall need a quick extraction, so get the scientists working on the tube technology.
I think we can all agree that not only do these two dudes rock, they have a friendship that we all envy
Did KG have bubble wrap underwear on?
In these troubling times, one band could save us from certain destruction. It’s the name of their fuckin band dude.
Leave it to the D to make me realize how beautiful a song that I’ve heard hundreds of times really is. Apologies to Chris Isaak for not recognizing it sooner.
Sex Sells
amazing
Oh my goodness!  Is Jesus in the sky?  Awesome JB and KG!
In all seriousness- the Chris Isaak was my mum’s favourite. This would’ve made her laugh like fuck. Thanks D You took that terrible memory And turned it into Beach Poetry   Now, I don’t mind if Wicked Game comes on - picture flipped right there bitches - thanks man 😅
This is so good, that if we had a full version, we wouldn’t be able to deal with that magnitude of  beauty whether it be emotionally, psychologically, or physically.  It’s like trying to fill our 50 gallon souls with 1,000 gallons of majesty.
Finally, the long-awaited sequel to the Abbey Road Medley video. <3
your songs are great
Love it!! Thanks, guys. These times call for some levity. 😊
The ocean, the sunset, the music, the bouncing nipples, everything is just utter perfection!
Many years ago I recall a YouTuber listing things and calling it content, one of the things she listed was 'Jack Black not being funny', I struggle to remember her name, I may of scratched it from memory due to her unfair appraisal of a man that doesn't court controversy or scandal and just likes to entertain.
Love these 2 😂😂
Kiss from a rose when?
We need more!!❤❤
What a voice!
Super nadal ❤❤
❤😂❤😂❤😂❤
Wish he would do the whole song 🫨
This is just a tribute 💁🏻‍♂️
I jerked off crying.
Hey Jack Big Fan. Just thought to write you because my mom passed away today. One great memory I will always remember with her was the day we went to see Nacho Libre at the theatre together and how we laughed and cheered at the end when you did that swan dive move on Rameses (Rip). It was a really good memory and thanks for being a part of it ❤   Message...
Tighty whiteys at the beach is a bold move
I got Tenacious D tickets
Gotta ssy, kyle is packing! 😅
Brilliant big-boy energy right there.Tune of the millennium.
finally women have an equivalent for girls gone wild commercials in the night

Time flies.. and the people who made me laugh and love music as a child are still bringing a smile to my face. Love you guys, thanks for the memories!
Absolute stunning!
I laughed and I cried
Что это было?
If it's not the full version of the song and literally 1.5 minutes, f'ck off and don't upload it.
Extended version pls
This gets me goin!
They're running slow motion in real time.
Best cover of the last 5 years!
....... pur aesthetics ......❤
awesome!
J'aime tellement cette chanson ! Pourquoi est elle si petite elle est folle et le clip aussi ❤️❤️
Ahaha like 75 y.o. babies:) So nice
when does the full version come out ?
This is the greatest thing I’ve seen all year 😂
Lo malo de todo esto es que me imagino a Bowser cantando pero si os esperamos en España con los brazos abiertos 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol amazing
this could be us but you playing
So it's funny because they're morbidly obese?
These two just can't help themselves from killing it day and night with their sick musical artistry and majestic sense of humor. What a combo!
MORE!!!
Man I wish I had a friendship with someone like Jack does with Kyle😅😂
What an iconic 80s duo!
Amazing
lol… hadda get to the end with the closeup to see those were not just BVD's but some sort of 'special' rhine-stone encrusted trunks.. Praise be he didn't instead try to rock a hammock!
Very nice!
They is both gonna be tormented in hell with there daddy satan.
My wedding song is chosen
Brilliant! Well done and so joyful 😊
2 best friends... knowing life is meeting ends, gripping to all valuable moments, regardless as to whom feel different. Appearance says it all. Be yourself all you can, Jack black taught us that as a teacher.
Excellent version.  Reminds me of the good old big daddy and giant haystack days.
God,  I love men
Totally need a full version of this! Amazing Jack!
Jack blacks voice range has always been so crazy and wild but ive always loved and admired his style no doubt😂😂😂
I'll say it....A 'D' covers album!
Amazing.
Art at it's most beautiful, perfection....
Jack’s voice is all that and more
And what about this?? From a 12 year old?? Angelina Jordan "Wicked Game" https://youtu.be/5IAMF4FDfw4
I hate my intrusive thoughts, but if we were ever to lose either of these two, going back to watch this video will make me bawl my eyes out.
Tenacious D making my life better again ❤️
Jack killed it
Pissed Myself....Brilliant stuff
Need the full song, absolutely stunning
this is the greatest content on this platform
True beauty… in some twisted way I do absolutely mean it! ❤
I Fucking LOVE your voice . It would be a dream to hear this voice live .
How good are they 🤯
How hypnotic it is to watch two beautiful men frolic majestically through the stunning scenery.
Gotta do a full cover!
Pense numa hérnia
Greatest Band Ever!
this is the most authentic video i have seen in years
cine🚬
The D - majestic, wild and free.
We want the entire song 😍😂
Another song to remind everyone that Tenacious D has insane range.
Shot on location at the epicentre of Fukushima's nuclear meltdown.
Bill e Frank???
Thank you for this ❤
What a wicked game indeed. .
Undisputed
America has never needed the D more than now.
Which you....

This was absolutely joyful and beautiful…the singing was also stunning (as always). Love you guys xx
KG definitely got that Tenacious D going on
Please can you guys sing a full version. So everyone can enjoy your master piece a little bit longer😎
Do the whole song please——
I love this!!!!
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Love it.
Too short.
Come to Denmark. 🙏🙏
❤
There are no longer words needed to grasp how beautiful this is. From my heart to your heart is all what matters. I already gave and give you everything i ever had. My truth is already in the unconcious of your heart and always will be. The call of the heart can no longer be ignored. Know no matter the fuck u think u did its already forgiven and forgotten. U wanna know why??? Cause it all came from a place that is not u. It all came from the shackles of enslavement and we are everything that ever will be and also nothing. There is only love. U already gave me everything i ever wanted and if i die right in this moment i will have tears of infinit graditude and joy cause nothing can ever change that. Never hold back your tears cause they wash away all the dirt u collelcted in this life where they tried everything to hold you back from the only truth. Its already over we aint takin it no more. Just sit back relax and let your heart take fully over. We are getting one once more no matter what the fuck u do now (: Share this message or dont. You are already free. Iam always there to love every single one of you cause we are all important. What i experienced means nothing without every single one of u. U are safe...time will tell 😄❤
EPIC!
Well, that was a tease. Come on, man?!
Santa's junk is hypnotic
Another masterpiece to pay the rent.
fuck :(
Great 💪💪💪💪
Jack Black has an incredible vocal range
The greatest band of all time
I remember when tenacious d songs were longer than 2 minutes anyways still being great
Simply perfect
The way Jack stares at the camera as he runs straight towards it cracks me up for some reason.
kage is all balls
WTF?
❤
You guys ever just livestream jammy seshess and fwee write stuff ? Idk it just seems like too long since I seen something . But you guys rock and I love you. P.s. Kyle's dong is number 1 ...
I lovew
How can people eat themselves to that unhealthy and disgusting state is beyond me.
Oh my dad is gonna love this.
Thank god for a little piece of "normality" in these crazy times :)
love you guys! ❤
We need a POD pt. 2. Come on,guys. The world needs this.
The guitar arrangement for this is STUNNING....
Pure joy! Best friends having rumpacious fun.😊
Wow! Bowser is really branching out
This is Rock and Roll!
We need a full cover asap! That was fucking magical 😮‍💨👌🏻
Kung Fu Panda really went hard with this one
Please please please cover the whole song! I want to love you even more!!! 💚💚💚
JB‘s vocals just hit different man, idk
Please!!!!! Make an extended version....such a good song
I love JB and KG! Woohoo! :D
That was a cool rendition, thanks!
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.   Thank you so much for such a wonderful gift, gentlemen.
It is... brilliant. Sublime. Hilarious.
Friendship is rare. This is a good representation imho.
So funny😂 The original chris Issac song, and the video!!!! Are stunning
Amazing how much this made me feel with how silly it is on the surface. I’m in tears. 😅🥰
The running made me laugh with joy. And god DAAMN you have a good voice 🤘
I love you guys ❤️
Kyle has such a delicate touch on the guitar.
Dudes have huge penises for being chubby.
so happy to see this sort of lgtbtq representation from bowser \  fg
WATCH IT AGAIN BUT CLOSE YOUR EYES!!!!
The meanining of music in one song.
YES
Wow, even better than the original! Please don’t tell Chris I said that.
Damn that’s good
4.5 million views for less than two minutes of pure joy, love and rock. We need Tenacious D back more than ever.
The best video i whatch in my entire life. The cumpliciti bethween brothers. So special... (Sorry my English) want to see you in PORTUGAL
You can't unsee that
Somebody please tell me where i can find that suit Jack is wearing- i must get one for my husband 😍😍😍
Tenacious diabetes
This is the GREATEST video to ever grace the internet with its presence.
I love you
Osos maduros
I just showed this to my wife. Her reaction was one of them should have held (hidden) their moobs like the original video. Hysterical!!
This is absolutely touching and beautiful
Is the grey guy wearing pullups????? 😂😂😂😂😂
Wicked
This is so wholesome! ❤
This video is art in its purest form. "JOY". Such a rare and beautiful thing now a days. The video, in slow motion. The beach and two Great friends enjoying a simple moment in a stunning setting. It really is perfect.   While everyone is pleading for a full length version of this song, I would disagree completely. This short moment of vocal bliss is perfect. A cliff hanger that leaves one needing more of it. This is brilliant and perfect. A 5 minute rendition would likely be too much and have everyone thinking, thank God it has ended. Everything about this version is perfect and that includes the short verse and chorus. Tenacious D delivers a masterful version here. Proving that its not the size that matters, its how you deliver the D that counts!.  Thank you Jack, Kage and the Mighty D!
Their rock is strong!
You see, i used to think of the H.I.M. version of this song when i think of "Wicked Game". Now I'm pretty sure I'll be picturing Tenacious D on a beach, nice!
Thats awesome😵‍💫
You are both so so loved 🖤
The world really needs the full version of this ❤❤❤ you guys are stunning!
why I am watching this already 25 th time
Full version! This is Awsome ❤🤘
Damn.. Those tighty whities...
I love how they just leave the comedy for the visuals.  the audio is stunning.   the visuals are hilarious.  Perfect combination
Finally been waiting for this ❤❤❤
Legends!
Acid eyes
not sure if hung like rhinos or fat blods bouncing. either way i cant unsee that...
This is just too much. I love it
What a lovely tribute to all the Bears for Pride Month. <3
so much balls
Boy can Jack sing, awesome and I love the 2 Great Whites frollicking in the water 🤣
Ah yes, reminds of HIM at it's prime.
I’m so turned on
luv the stuff
Makes me question my sexuality
With enough man tits to topple of the south American government
And that's how you kill the classic. Forever.
New fany
You two are fucking awesome.
There friendship is beautiful
Woow
Somehow still less g** than HIMs ver
Love me some Jack Black and Tenacious D. Love this, made me laugh a ton. I needed that.
we will meet in zurich 12/06/23 , and it s after tomorrow , i cant wait to see them in the stage , best ever
Very relaxing. I wish they would relase full version of this song.
Love you
Love it!
mama mia, tremenda versión! muy bueno... premium!
This made me laugh more than it should have....
They should redefine the work "Happness" in the dictionary to a link to this video...
Fuck me GENTLY, great cover, but these fellas SHOULD do something about those guts! They WON'T be with us much longer like that! (And don't worry I am NOT pointing the finger!)
This simply has to be the greatest overall musical release of all times.
this is magic . . .
Oh to be that happy……
😢
He Looked like the burger king
i wish this song was longer, so beautiful
Friends will be friends, they're running naked in the sand Friends holding hands, they'll someday surely form a band
This version Is more chill...
kudos on the high notes Jack!
Is ....KG wearing.... diapers?
Majestic beasts 🤘🏻
I'm struggling. HARD. Tenacious D are medicine
I'm so sorry they made you do that peaches song.. 🎉
Oh my god they're so cute!
bloody freezing lol
Is this just a teaser for it? And already has millions of views in just a few days? The D, The huge.
🫵👽🫶
STRANGLY ROMANTIC IN SOME WAY 😂😂😂
I'm sure you have recovered the pick of Destiny guys❤
I just love these two guys. 💖💖
For all the younguns out there, this is funny because of the juxtaposition of this to the original video.
thousands of songs you could cover and make a new smash hit, this is so good
Please do the whole cover!
Please do a longer version i can't explain how much i need it 😭
This is some tasty Tenacious D!
Stop worrying about your looks and have fun haha.. thx Kyle and Jack!
Tenacious D ... my shool days, me and my friend, what a harisma:) remember me and my friend ... two dudes in the city of Ukraine in mid 2000s singing the Beelzeboss.  Tenacious D " you blow those fuckers down"🤣, thank you for your performance!
They should do a whole cover album
I’m not crying! YOU’RE CRYING!
criminally too short!
They need to do the full version.
Tune !!!❤
Even though Jack is an Atheist his voice combined with the tunes from Kyle's guitar transports us on a straight path to Heaven. Thank you guys, this is so beautiful.
it would be hilarious if they recreate the original wicked game clip on the beach, jack black as chris isaac and kyle as the model
I want the full tune!!!
This is just a tribute….
that's actually so good wtf. listening on repeat
Like, Why isn’t this a full version already? Omg, I’m pretty sure even Chris Isaac came.
Perfect.  Please release a full length version.
So great to see joy 😊. These two just having fun running on the beach….
My girlfriend just walked in whilst i was listening to this with headphones on. She now thinks ive got a thing for Jack Black in swimwear.
Привет Джек Блэк !!! Из Сибири .
I love Wicked Game and Chris Isaac and never really enjoyed covers because they can’t compete against the original. JB’s powerful command of his voice is incredible and I loved this cover. Please more of this and more covers! It doesn’t even have to have that jokey Tenacious D tone, I would love a serious version of them just playing and singing
Goosebumps... Love u guys <3
Can't help thinking when they are  both dead, this is how they want the world to remember them. Frolicking in  the sea, just not giving a shit.
Weirdly beautiful.
"What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you."  Loving you was a pain, whether it was a blessing or curse, that I'll never know. I just know that...I don't regret loving you.
Lol! Funny and beautiful
Too short! more please
It's only a wicked game if you don't know how to play it?
😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👏👏👏 Талантливые люди талантливы во всём ❤❤❤
F**KIN RAD AS HELL 😢🥹
it just hit me that Kyle Gass and Rick Rubin are actually the same person!
Oh my good I didn’t know I needed this
Wow !
I just fkin love these 2. Incredible musicianship quality and talent. Whatever Jack Black sing sounds great.
This is officially started my summer off to a great start 🙌
Chris and Helena would be proud.
That just made me feel better than I did after a David Packman clip.
I was both overjoyed and terrified.
Ok I love u guys Love ONLY LOVE!!!
i hope they capture one of those creatures and puts it in a zoo, I'd like to study them further.
Full version please cos I need more
Awesome cover - this deserves a full version.
That’s priceless 😂😂😂😂
my goodness. that was so just RIGHT. D - thanks for the deeply beautiful music, and the deeply free smiles!!
Nice cover.
Their friendship makes me so happy.
It's crazy how shredded Jack Black is beneath that buoyant beautiful body. This band is life. Tool and Tenacious D.
Justo el cover que necesitaba de tencius la neta me dio 100 años de vida❤❤❤
❤
They look like two majestic badass walruses livin the dream and still kickin ass
haha, i needed this
I can't stop watching this lmao
Genial  🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍
Mike White needs musical entertainment for The White Lotus season 3.  Hint hint.
actually  quite  beautiful
La felicidad de la vida misma en estado puro, .. Lo simple, lo eterno lo que nos queda... Esos momentos❤❤❤
Wow. Now I can't ever unsee that. So joyful. Fantastic cover. Too short as everyone else says.
Did Jack Black take vocal lessons from Andy Bernard? Please say yes.
Made the hairs on my arms raise. Nice!
The only thing that could make this better is if Jack and Kyle jumped and hugged like Rocky and Apollo.  Brilliant!
perfection.👌
I love Jack Black
TENACIOUS D 4EVER!!!!!!!!🤘🤘🤘🤘
To wszystko, muzyka, tekst , nastrój jest piękny. Zawsze będę dążył do tego co i Jack Black chciał zrealizować. To jest właśnie muzyka. Dziękuje że dajecie dobry przykład.
Increíble!!!
arousing and disturbing.  silly but sombre.  poignant yet frivolous.  i don't know whether to be sad or horny.
Proud to be different 🤷‍♂️
This simply might be the best thing ever
I'm crying
I guess JB's out of practice.  Back in the old days, he would have been able to hit those high notes with no problem.
Wicked!
We miss you guys😘
Kyle needs to splurge on some sunscreen.
Their version of this song inspired me to make a little Red Dead 2 video to accompany it. I hope J.B. and Kyle don't mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4yFOaOohaI
How about the full version, please please please 🙂
Oh my God !
Nothing like a good ol' romp on the beach... Marvelouse Maan, I just didn't know where to look! Making waves!
Can someone please make a ten hour version of this, my finger hurts.
Even Chuck Norris will cry at this song 🥹
Big up, ma Brothers in mind.💯
Okay I need an advice PLEASE- There is a concert next week and my husband bought tickets for our 8yo son, he LOVES tenacious D, it’s his favourite band. He doesn’t speak English so he doesn’t understand swearing and he is instructed to close his eyes when my husband says… is it a worse idea ever? Are we gonna burn in hell? 😁 I am aware it’s not appropriate for his age although the concert is not Age restricted but I haven’t been to their concert so idk what to expect… heeelp
masterpiece!!!
It's like watching magnificent whales breaching in arctic splendor.
This should be as long as Kyle's ballsack.
The water was soo cold!!
Jack Black is starting to look like Phil Magera (Bam Magera / Jackass) 🤣🤣😂🤣
I love you 🤣🥰
love u all
I love the frolicking.
These are two unique mammals captured in a wild by National Geographic
Such a great cover, I wish it was longer.
Fucking Legends!
that look like some dirty ass jersey shore water.....where they at?
The day whales became human
Looks like a Lana del Rey video made with the actual fan base of Lana del Rey ❤
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you  And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) With you  Nobody loves no one
Ville Valo cry, Jack sing better)
So joyful 😻
wow good cover
🔥🔥🔥👏❤
His voice is too firm.
Am I the only one slightly aroused here?
It’s just the best thing I’ve ever seen 😂
❤
It’s so awesome and hilarious that I can watch those two run slow motion in they’re undies and love it
Classic. They don’t give a shit about anyone else. 😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
I haven't seen that much flopping since Lizzo running up to the buffet for last call..
never see santa claus running in the Ocean at summertime, GREAT
What did u just watch?
Radiant male beauty. ❤️
Thank you 🙏😘🙃🤣
Damn Jables, his vocal range and transitions are so smooth man
Satanists day at the beach. Life is good for those who submit to Lucifer.
i didn´t understand this
Well, DAMN! 😯😏
Release the full version!!!!! for the love of good music!!!!!!
Breathtaking.....
Chris Isaak, if you see this post. For the love of God please tell Tenacious D to release this as a single...
Well I'm turned on
Its the most erotic clip I ever see in my life
Dats Right!
Dear God I love you guys <3
Did these boys stuff their cockles or are they just hung like elephants?
❤
Jack black is my fucking hero and I wouldn’t be here without Tenacious D
Like dolphins on the crest of a rainbow❤❤❤❤
Release the KG cut! We need the full song
Mesmerizing
ButUJus Can’t Help It❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🐽💋💋💋💪💥😘
Wonderful
wtf man
If I had one wish in my life. It's that everyone hears the God given talent these 2 weird, large men have. Everyone.
If only you would sing authentically. Feels like you’re hiding behind humour. You could be the male equivalent of Adele. I challenge you to sing an intense song authentically.
Its interesting. And funny. But I don't see what the big deal is. They didn't even do the whole song. Whats up with that?
That was better than the original. I want to see Tenacious D do Billy Thorpe's "Children of the Sun."
😂😂 epic dudes!!
I always forget how insanely well jack can sing
Best music vidéo éver!
Sexy 😎🤘🏾
Man, Helena Christensen has really let herself go.....
Love this music!😊
Apparently Jack wasn't good enough for American Idol, these vocals beg to differ.
Patiently (maybe naively) waiting for the full version release
Been saying it for years. Id absolutely love Jack to do a massive covers album. Just loads of awesome songs that just sound incredible with him singing them. I loved how good he sounded for the Rocky Horror song. I just think it would do so well
🤍
At the end I was half expecting to hear, "Wicked Gane, a new fragrance by Yves St. Lauren."
This looks like it was filmed and then played in reverse. Crazy level of commitment to get that shot.
I've been waiting for the D to cover this song my entire life. I can die in peace now... seriously u guys, this was the only thing keeping me going each day and now that it's here I guess I've got nothing left. So thanks?
Best version of wicked games….period!
LOVE!!!
Netflix
Cocks all flappin around 😏
This is CGI?!?! :D
Oh man why couldn't they sing the whole song.....please!!!
Omg 😆…I was looking at this and crackin up, thinking that reminds me of something Jack Black would do with his bro!   then clicked on it  and saw Ten D !!!! 😂
WE LOVE  YOU !
so many emotions here thx guys
One take video.
took the dogs to the beach today!!
Love it!!! 🙌🏼❤️
Does anyone get the message…. Either there is no Love in this world; or we need more Love and spread it around…… A simple but not so simple choice……..
It's beautiful I've looked at this for 5 hours now
Magestic.
Where is the rest of the song..!?? I need more.. its so beautiful ❤
The most underrated band in history :)
This would make my whole life finding these two on the beach in the wild
I can't stop watching it
Your expressions!!!! I LOVE THIS!!! So wholesome hahahaha
I wish I was between them. I’d love to be gay with them ❤️🥵 Love how hot of a bear Jack Black is
The world needs the full version of this (perhaps with Kage harmonizing) immejately.
므찌노
Yes, more please ❤
I will never be able to get these images out of my head again...thank you Chris Black and Kyle Isaak, with love from Italy.
the best thing I saw today :-D
Sexual
Loved you guys at Rock am Ring in Germany <3
So good. Simple & brilliant. I wonder what Chris Issak thinks of this? I think, like all of us, would love it. Tenacious D forever.
😂😂😂😂
ПИДОРЫ!
hahahahh OMG Jack
wow her voice.....
❤ i love this Song...i love Tenacious D
PLEASE PLAY WONDERBOY AT 02 LONDON 😢😍💕😍💕💕💕😍😍
PLEASE PLAY WONDERBOY AT 02 LONDON 😢😍💕😍💕💕💕😍😍
PLEASE PLAY WONDERBOY AT 02 LONDON 😢😍💕😍💕💕💕😍😍
I didnt know i needed this - thank you jack
By far, by far... the most beautiful rendition i've ever seen of this song.... please... a longer version!
Pure fun! I really want to go to a beach now!
This made me cry for some reason!
I thought that was a huge ball bag bouncing around in those white jocks but on closer examination I think it is flab folds being deceptive
My eyes! Love the music though.
The video makes you wanna laugh, the riff and voice makes you wanna cry with greatness…I’m just frozen here between emotions
Joy added to life. Thank you ma brudduhs!
Always a treat! Every time!
PLEASE release the full length song!! <3
They probably couldn't run any farther, is probably the reason they didn't go any farther. They did a lot better than I could have in my pathetic physical condition!
like ´lil`Jack said it once...."it´s magical and rad." simply beautifull....
amazing version❤
Wtf did i just see ?
Awesome cover
Fuckin... rising again like a phoenix. And that's what I like to see >:-]
My youngest will not go to sleep until I play her this song!! PLEASE release the full version 🙏🙏🙏
Dudes, I totally miss you...
OMG, this made me laugh so hard.......I have a stressful job working in a hospital and this was just what I needed for my end of day decompress 🤣🤣
Apollo and Rocky
In Australia we'd just say "There's a couple of knobs on the beach again"
Thang to doooooooo <3
I can’t unsee this
True friendship is eternal.
Really wish there was a full version because this makes me so fucking happy
Beautiful moment ❤
When are you gonna star in a cowboy movie, you'd make a good cowboy with that voice
One of the best Chris Isaac covers I've heard. The sequins at the end just topped it off 😉
two friends having fun ♥
It's kind of screwed up that whole Helena C  thing I had going on
Fuck yeah!
Holy shit.  That was really damn good.  Jack has a amazing voice
more more MORREEE!!
He wearing white briefs, he is so brave
The sight of you two powerful beasts galloping majestically in the surf! Glistening manes... er or beards ...flowing in the wind. Tatas swayin?!?😱  Sexy!!!😍 Makes me wanna sing a lil bit babay!  Oh yeeuh!!!        Ohhhhhhh 💞    AIIIIEEEE-yuhh❤ Wanna fall in luv! 💋
It's why slo-mo was invented!!
Thank you so much for another, even more beautiful peace of art! So Wonderful. I want to listen to it over and over again. You guys made that song perfekt. Wondering how that was even possible. Please, everyone wants to hear the whole song from you!!!
The Whale 2 (2024), by Darren Aronofosky.
Top draw musicianship right there🔥
Aguante Tenacious D la puta que lo parió!!🤘🔥
This could be us but u wanna play
True love
Sexiest video I've ever seen :з
Together is the best way to be.  Totally fukin miss you, dude.
That Canadian Chef will do the crazys things
This makes me so happy 😂❤
finally the version we've needed
TENACIOUS D
I have wet dreams every  night since watching this marvellous music video.
Jamie Foxx is probably the only other person more talented than Jackie
Peaches peaches
Beautiful masterpiece
Nobody loves no one. 😅 With so much passion. 😂
Dope video
Imagine being this happy as an aged man. Amazing.
esse clipe custou 7 milhoes de dólares.
This isn't the greatest cover ever, this is just a tribute.
Mesmerized
JB PRESIDENT
EPIC!
anybody catch homeboy's unit?
we need a full version of this!
I always thought their name was Voracious D.
As a tear of joy falls down my cheek, this poem and moment of time will forever push and act as my momentum. I look for a friendship and passion this true
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
This might just be.... the greatest song in the worldddd 😂
Sounds pretty good. And I don't hear auto tune ....
they have no shame and that's what makes them so good, they don't care what people think about them
This was utterly joyous. Thank you 💚
What a voice ladies and gentlemen.
Now i can die.
This makes my day😂, great song!
Love the video!
Vous êtes complètement dingues ! J’arrive !
This is fantastic
Джек блек крут!!! медиатор судьбы !
Legionary. Their cat like moves are awesome.
Massimiliano Antonio Cavalera
good shit
"You'll never go in the water again!"................Jaws 1975....................;)
Man, bad memories with song. I hate it!
I just come back and watch this again and again. Sincere. Open. Can we all act like this? To our family? To our colleagues? Without covered intentions, without shame and disgrace?
my god..... beyond words I need therapy....
short and so sweet
I have only 1 question: why is this masterpiece so short? We need more of this pure happiness!
*sigh* so apparently I find Jack Black hot now
Kyle G looking good
Che immagine poetica! Altro che pamela Anderson
This might be the most awesome thing ive ever seen before in my life
"Fat guys have tiny dicks". Proof it's wrong.
The bedazzled trunks. Love it!
*Скупая мужская слеза*....
Jabels and KG  this is the gayest (love it) vid ,great, cover, love it ! you guys work out before filming  you give dude s a soft on
В самом начале я подумал, что это пародия на лунную походку. Отлив волны подыграл)
EPIC AF 🤌 You so inspire me!!  #DJGhostCYaN
Too short!!!
When I was a child I was at the beach and saw 3 "queen sized" elderly women in their swimsuits playing in the waves and they instantly won my heart and admiration. I said I wanted to be just like that as an adult, always carefree, not being restricted from having fun by worrying about how other people might judge! So I especially love this video of frollicking men!
hahahahahahahaha
Was watching this at work and my boss walked in. Thanks, D.
Beautiful…
This is as beautiful as it is too short :'(
2 beached whales lol
the sparkles on swimming trunks... love it
Stunning, as always! I love those guys!
Beautifull manbody and energy, just as God made it. ;):)
Two guys living there best life
Wow, Kage is packing
Santa Claus IS real...  And sexy AF. 😂 This made my day, haha...
I don't want to say it, and I don't even know what it would be, If it's even possible, or what it would even sound like. Nor is it for me to even say. But this is the closest we've gotten to a non sarcastic JB vocal.
Two gay fat guys at the beach?
Wit chew 😢
OMG.... I need coffee first. It's too early for this shit 🤣🤣🤣
My goal in life: be happy like them!
Jesus Christ, record the whole song, you assholes. This is way too good to leave at a minute forty. Also, the real music video for this should be a shot for shot recreation of the video for the original song, but Kyle in the Helena Christensen role, and they're sensually feeding each other Mexican food.
i hope a day you will make the full "computerman" song... actually to listen to that i have to loop the scene in "school of rock" xD
Иногда ютюб действительно радует своими рекомендациями😂
looks like my drunken dreams
priceless.
some of the funniest shit I have seen
Это легендарно!!
1:50 only ? Need longer version
this video is 200% bullet proof evidence that beauty comes from the inside
For a song that means so much to me, it's a huge juxtaposition to see it in this light.
Harpoon accident waiting to happen.
this video should not have dislikes
You guys are so awesome, amazing you guys are still you guys! If you know what i mean.
Can someone tell me where I can find the  jack black swimming costume
I could totally see him singing this lol. His eyebrows lol. He’s actually a great singer! ❤
I´d kill myself for an ounce of the self confidence of my own body :)
In all seriousness, this is beautifully sung and played.  Of course the video is hilarious ✌🏼
What a wicked wiggle of peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
this ain't funny video it is rather disgusting watching these two obese men
HAHAHAHAHAHA😭☝☝  AAAAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.... BEST GUYS!
Їбала жаба гадюку, просто супер, просто класс, о вери гуд, о вери данс😜
I just love this song ... your beer bellies are not interesting)))
Phoenix AZ would love to see you live!
No puedo creer que le de like a esto, jajjaaj que temazo, larga vida a Tenacious D
Why it is SO funny, WHY?
The extended version is for adults only.
two dudes enjoying life nice
7am: that's enough internet for today.
Gotta love this country.
Masters...
Amazingly talented artists.
holy shit
wicked games of happyness
wtf did I just watch?
Gonna need a longer version asap.
The jiggling is almost hypnotic…it’s like a lava lamp
This video ahhahahahaahhHhahHha
Hi man how are you today...looks like you had fun filming this video, there's this one dude in my HOT YOGA class I always thought was KYLE, but he does not have the white beard he looks like Kyle from 2010. My name is Christian O. Your Biggest OG Fan.
LOL. That was wicked. LOL.
I Love Jack
That looks absolutely frigid.
Old boys
Ahahah
It's really poetic, i loved it. Long life to Tenacious D.
Nothing to say but I love Tenacious D
Words can’t describe how beautiful this song and the video are 🥲
lmao
Perché algoritmo perché?
Yall are so cute
OMG! My eyes! Old fat man danglies in  a one piece and tighty whiteyes! This has got to be the best parody of the millennium!!!!
Can you guys repeat this with chris isaak? ❤
love it
WTF?
Genius.
I want to know if Jack had that singlet or if he bought it. I'm leaning to him already owning it. Dude's a legend. Also Kyle is cool too...
[Verse] What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you nеver felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to makе me dream of you  [Chorus] And I wanna fall in love No, I don't wanna fall in love With you  [Outro] Nobody, loves no one
Holy Snikeys, The D got some mental bulges... it makes me feel shy about my own acorns.
Next Aquamen for DC
Kyle's face at the end is screaming "I'm never fucking running again"
Kage and Jables, back at it again!  Love you guys.
This is beautiful.
Perfect
I think we will go to the mountains for a change this year.
Give us a full song cover, we need this❤
Well that was fun
Я почему-то подумал что это "YKWIM?"
These guys know that bouncing titties sell
Andrew Weil and the Jack of Black out for their morning run. Picked the wrong song, perhaps?
Synchronised belly wobble...how poeticly justified.
I didn't get it at first but after the thirtysixt time it clicked.  Beautiful peace of art! When you think of it it's mindblowing.  For me personal this could be a life changer.  Thanks.
x1.5 speed is what I expected a Tenacious D version of Wicked Game would sound like
Man I wish the song lasted longer its sooooo good god damn
KG has a huge fucking schlong
I ask everyone to help me. I lack air. I am unemployable. I need money to buy air conditioning. Without this I will be bad. Raiffeisen Bank card 4149510097509303
Ну что можно сказать в этом видео все прекрасно!
It's almost too much Man  For one frame to hold Thanks for not being afraid to Feel
The D has been a major part of me life.. thanks for the uplift gentlemen Music is magic "Let's Fight his music with  Our music"
Bowser has some incredible range
I find no way to describe happines best than this video ... on the other hand, all this song versions I know are incredible awesome ... but this short one really gutted me ...
Jack Black lives life as a big child in every sense of the word unabashed. This vid makes no apologies ❤❤❤ and it shouldn't. In your face, Entertainment Industry!
I mean it is funny.... but I don't need to see this.
Thank y'all for coming to Arkansas. Talk about a dream come true!!! I am beyond stoked to y'all ❤❤
Helena Christensen chi???
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed.
Para for curva, ft Anna mclab.
I see....
Was bin ich sehend?
It's just pure joy
Dude. Your voice on this is absolutely stunning…I’d buy this version !!!!!
I might be completely traumatized, but this is GOLD!
Magnificent! <3 Could you please make a complete version of kiss from a rose ? I'll be always grateful
AMAZING :)
Chris Isaak has to be so proud of this!🎉❤
lowkey really love his vocals
Tenacious D is incapable of disappointment, KG and JB always deliver.
Full version along with a full version video please.
fuuuuuuck need a longer version 🔥
Helena Christensen punching air rn
I´m ded
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bowsers influence noice pick, though.
That’s hot!
I like it! I'm from Korea.
Peak Male Performance
jaja, que linda amistad!! me alegra mucho por ellos!
Like two majestic escaped farmyard animals.
Back again, we all need an album of covers by Tenacious D, Jack's voice and KG's fingers are a match made in heaven!
Сука,это гениально🤣
Just incredible! Love his control and pitch, classic D style.
😂😂😂😂❤
слеза потекла
This looks like pure, unadultered fun. <3
Мэддисон сказал что клип классный
I've always wondered what it must be like to feel no shame.
Epic Guys, Music, and video EPIC
Thank you Kage. Thank you Jables. This was absolutely beautiful.
This song is WAAAAAAAAAAAY to short!!!!!!!!
Best covers always
Obviously a Teaser    lol
oh dude - i love them
That was..the most beautiful thing  i've ever seen🥹
finished listening to this while looking at my dog singing harmony to it, and he was like "What the hell are you doing" - and yeah... case in point - No one loves nobody - gosh I love this little dog, and he clearly loves me.
Just 2 dudes living their best life 🤘
The most joyful thing I have ever seen.
"So whats gonna be Kyle? Tiis, or destiny?" -Tits with destiny
nice couple and these Americans how foreign they are
looks like bay watch 40 years later and 15 tons of pure beer
The smiles, Jack’s attire. Truly majestic.
Still better than FastX
Ok, I clicked because I knew it would be hilarious, and it is, but honestly that is a pretty good cover haha. The video is distracting from the actual quality of the song in a way
Mesmerizing.  The song is enchanting too.
I was not read for these views of KG
This. Is. Art.
How lovely...
i love it (in  an not gay way (gay persons like it maybe in a gay way))
There is enough CRAP in the ocean without these two entering it
I saw this as a suggestion and I laughed before I heard a single note
Jack Black, the voice of a generation
A gift from the universe these two are.
🙏🙏🙏💓💓💓💓
I love the original, so happy to hear you two covering it. Love your work and progression as artists.  Don't ever let people put you in boxes. You can be both a musician and actor, and you can be any of the countless other things that you want to be xx
süß
Uncle Albert is still with us 😂
My mood sky-rocketed after watching this. I don't think I'll ever get mad again😃
Thats the best cover I've ever heard. I would really appreciate a full version <3
Best music video since long time
These are such beautiful men. I can honestly say I feel love for them.
See you in London baby! Always loved this song, this cover just rocks
Jack has such an awesome vocal….just wish we could hear the more serious side of him more often!
😂❤❤❤❤
Liewe fok! Het nou lekker gelag! The best video of you guys ever! Kind of freaky and adorable at the same time ;-D
Lifegoal!
You're the bests
First song, "video game" second song "wicked game"   I'm starting to see a pattern...
I thought this was going to be a movie trailer.
Thanks bois
Kyle looks like hes been doing dick push ups!
Best of the best🤘

Absolutely magic

OMG ! TENACIOUS D!! Woohoo! love you guys!!
I wanna be your buddy
Please do the full song
Great cover song! Much love from Wisconsin
Best videoclip ever...
Two lions, fierce and regal. Bounding through their territory. What majestic creatures.
Jack Black's voice sounds so good on this track. I loved the original, but this was 👏
damn Jack black made me tear up.
...and sometimes you have to run semi naked on a beach to a way too serious rendition of "Wicked Game"...with nuts....manufacture Inspirado...
This is art right here gentlemen
I've played this over and over and over. Oh, how I wish there was a longer version. This is hauntingly beautiful. Thank you Kage, thank you Jack, thank you TENACIOUS D
Olha o carro do ovo
Stuff of legend ❤
Fuck yeah!
"Nobody loves no one" because all loves are one, and that's true love which is unconditional, so there can't be the condition of someone being that person for you to truly love them. In other words, "nobody loves no one" is the same as "everyone loves".
Best version of the song. And this one doesn’t require forwarding & rewinding your VHS rip of MTV to find the nip-slip. 😊 (If you know, you know)
Hilarious
*chef's kiss*
Love is love ❤️
"sometimes a man needs to wear stretchy pants"
Love seeing y’all together 🥹🩵🩷

And they say there is no beauty left in this world?  Bravo my Dudes, Bravo!❤❤❤
Awesome! ❤
DAMN GOOD
🎉🎉❤❤❤
I love you!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Saw these guys open for Weezer like 20 something years ago. Somehow they never lost that appeal or artistry that brought them their well deserved fame. I love the D!
im sorry but.... Kyle is packin some......shmeat....
Happy to see two heavy blokes wading.
Me… me and kg… sex supreme
When I die I want this video played as I close my eyes. Everything about this video is so majestic and peaceful.
True masterpiece
love that guys! they gave me a lot of laughter
An instant classic
KG got the package of freedom
Never thought I would be so entertained by two grown naked men running down a beach.
I didn't think you could make Wicked game even sexier. I was wrong.
But shouldn't there be a nacho libre 2?
Omg!!Just in time for pride month...beautiful!!
Perhaps the most beautiful bromance ever to exist.
Nobody asked, everyone needed.
Lacked rolling in the sand part 😀
Please release the full version of this song!! It's one of my favorites and you guys are on fire 🔥 I love this cover!!
Just like watching Helena Christensen frolicking in the waves with Chris Isaak.
FYI There was no slow motion effect added to the video.
1:37 : when you help him find his puppy
I never knew I needed this video. Thank you.
Amazing ❤
Santa Claus and I do not know who is the other guy!
Two no talents
Ame este pequeño cover Sobre todo el vídeo 1:50 min  Lo disfrute 😂❤
JB: Wear something scandalous and flashy…  KG: (shows up and just takes off his clothes) PERFECTION
love it!
🙈
Thats what its all about. They got it hahaha beautiful!
They don't call KG "Horse" because he runs fast
The man is an inexhaustible source of pure joy and talent
legends!!
No way 😂❤
600 pounds of talent right there.
they act like a bunch of kids... I love it
We need a full cover Album Please!!!
PERFECTION
Hah, nicely swimsuit ;)
Love this.
Jack looking more and more like kung fu panda as the years pass
gutted as i thought they covered the full song but what a video
Where did JB get that Mankini?
Outstanding
please do full version
😂❤😂
This is the most disturbing and cringe-worthy, yet very funny, video I've ever seen!  😂😲🤮
Ihr seid so geil gewesen am Ring! ❤ Danke!!!
Gods
Don’t know why this made me feel all happy and warm inside
BIG LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
What beach are they at? Probably in cali...
Wicked indeed; taking a song of joyous celebration by The Banana Splits; a song of the splits becoming whole again. I will concede It’s a fantastic interpretation of a classic none the less, Bravo!
Pode soar louco, mas enquanto ouvia essa música vinte vezes seguidas, eu me inspirei para escrever um poema;   O mar recua minhas tristezas e quebra minhas ansiedades contra ele mesmo.   O som da água e a imensidão celeste dilui minhas incertezas em meio a tanto, que não sobra mais com o que se angustiar.   O coração sincroniza com o estilhaçar das ondas de forma rítmica e encontra paz nessa canção.   O mar que transborda os olhos se mescla ao redor e retorna meu corpo ao infinito.   Não há como sofrer quando não sou mais eu, quando não sou mais um indivíduo excluso da realidade, quando sou um com o mundo.   Em um dia eu me desfiz em abismo, em seis já me construí ao oceano, em sete eu morri em meu descanso e acordei com o raiar do Sol em uma nova vida.   Nada sobra frente ao mar.
I have never seen a more profound and mesmerizing music video in all my lifetimes.
Living their best lives <3
Yall think this is cute? Two obese half naked devil worshiping slobs holding hands and loving on each other on a beach??  THIS COUNTRY HAS FALLEN!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💔💔
Goosebumps
lmao jack used to be the thin one between the two of them-- i love how he caught up. super dad bod. not being sarcastic, i really think he's glowing hahaha

I fell in love
Perfect how it is 👌
I love these 2 so much, friends till the end! ❤️
I NEED the full cover. Missed the lads and its great to hear Jack's voice has aged like a fine wine!
Can’t see past the HiM cover ever with this song.
Legendary cover.
Гениально
Thought I saw genitals, its just Kyle's thighs.  Thighsman Trophy Winner 2023 - Kyle Gass
Nope, and also...ok
we asked, and they delivered.

I usually reserve the title hero for a very select few. But....
Love the video so much
Wow release a mf album I know I'd buy it
Best summer video ever!😁
Нее, один хуй, очень круто!)
I used to love them the love is still strong what a voice jacky boi
You bring this song in a another level guys. Thx so much!
Please - I beg to the Beelzebub of Dave Grohl, do the entire song.
Witch youuuuu!!! 😂
This is the longest I've stared at two penises for
Два жирных престарелых "весельчака" бегут, размахивая детородными органами. Понятно, почему Америка приветствует завоз мигрантов, иначе население просто вымрет.

Use me as a "full version encore" button. Causes this was beautiful.
The comments in here make me want to drink myself into an early grave
Jack Black does it again. Utmost respect for this guys talent and confidence. Lol
Beautiful voice ❤
The Witchz is one of my favorite bands and here you are covering the song my partner had me listen to that got me into the band
magic!
E Chris Isaac muto.🤟
Beach boys 😎
Best 1:50 of my day so far lol
I love you guys!!!! Back in the Myspace days I had the Wonderboy music video play as my background. You have an amazing voice that even when your just joking around your vocals are crazy! Much love...God bless!
As a member of a nice men belly, anyone can tell me where to find these epic swim trunks from Jack? Or what are they called?
Kyle : Dude we gotta film a music video for this  Jack : Just use any clip of us hanging out, it'll work.
The Greatest Duo That's Ever Been Known, Your music raised and changed me into this silly happy human. Thank you for all your music and the dedication you made to the art. I will forever remember seeing you guys in concert "house of blues rise of the phoenix". I Love You TWO!
I wish I had a best friend for so long I could do this with, even without the god-like talents. Very inspiring.
This is fuckin' masterpiece!
Kyle is packing some heat 😂
Legends
Not sure what was sexier, the voice or the tiger thingy suit. 😉
having a bad day? This gives every human a minute smile on their face
I remember being 11 and watching tenacious D for the first time 😂 that shit opened my eyes fr fr
Goddamm Jack Black. What a treasure
wish we could all be happy as you guys are here
I love you and i'm so sad because i can't go to the Helfest
KG IS PACKIN SOME SERIOUS GONADS
Well done  Goons!
Lough and cry at the same time. Pure beauty. Amazing!
저 아름다운 몸매들 좀 봐. 정말 자기관리 끝판왕이라고. 괜히 정점이 아님 ㄷㄷㄷ
More please!
Gayest shit iv ever seen
Fn EFFF YEAH!!! Tenacious D LIIIIIIIIIIVES!!!  CANNOT WAIT FOR YOUR NEW ALBUM YOU PROMISED OZZY MAN NEXT YEAR!!!
I wish Jack Black would just not talk about things he's not educated in and knows nothing about. Annoys me when someone with a giant platform spouts dangerous identity politics as if they really even know or care what they're saying. Perhaps educate yourself before you go on and sound like an idiot. Cool cover tho, whats funny is they probably intended to cover the whole song but they just simply couldn't run for more that 1 minute.
Majestic
it was epic
Thank you for bringing levity to this song, it’s so crushing especially when Corey Taylor does his rendition, this being said I never thought to husky men in onesies would make me tear up 😂
🧚🏻‍♂️☯️🌌😆✌️
I want to listen to Tenacious D for many more years. I always want to see your extravagance and laugh at your follies. Everyone here always wants to be with you, follow you everywhere, because we love you so much.  This video is wonderful, in slow motion, with splashes of water flying in the air, even more you can see your huge bellies vibrating in slow motion.  The Guitar sound and its dynamic is perfect, the interpretation with which you sing this cover is magnificent. Please, I ask you from the deepest of my heart, for your health and well-being, you both need to lose weight. I know that for you the belly could be an icon, I know it's nice to eat tasty and greasy things, I know it's nice to drink beer and then another one. But the people of Tenacious D want you to always stay healthy, we need your vigor and carefree.   Be Tenacious and Lose Weight!
Tenaciously wicked
The dream team ❤🎉
i wished my mother could hear this. she loved that song and she loved you guys! just hard chills man. ☝
Make me feel happy... just  .... HAPPY! :)
The sexiest clip ive ever seen 😂
Lmao......Jack Black does it again!!! Dudes doing a great job making us laugh our A$$e$ off !!  🤘😂🤘

Incredible! *bites lip* we need a full length cover....IMMEDIATELY!
"Whichooo"?

Hypnotizing, like a lava lamp
poetry in motion
Stunning and brave.
В видео прекрасно все))
they're  back baby! tears to the eyes
That was every kind of beautiful
I have heard that song before. In Lucifer Morningstar
This reminds me of Friends
Despite how goofy the video is the song kinda struck me at the core
Jack Keeps getting older, but Kyle stays the same age
Please, Please release a full version of this!
Рure art.

Every woman wants them and every man wants to be them.
very nice!
We need a full version of the song 😮😮😮😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

They only actually ran about 6 feet into the water and then back …. That slow mo lol Man they have me rolling … and the joy on their faces lololol😂
Продолжайте радоваться как дети! И не важно сколько вам лет и что о вас подумают люди! Просто будьте счастливы так же как и эти два джентльмена:)

🤣🖤🖤🖤
Sexy thick bois. F yeah
Came for boobs, stayed for boobs.
My only complaint is that this song isn't longer 😂
Most Awesomest Shot In History!
Great work boys .
I've seen sexier videos on the internet but this one does have its allure
Pleeeeaaassse give us the whole version!
Anyone who likes this is my kind of person
need full version in my desk now!
One of my favourite songs just got a whole lot better😊
i was a little afraid that kyles trunks will go off. is it just me?
Hey guys, I have an ass mark too. Let me join and we can become Tenacious D...ick pic. BTW, that was awesome.
The best way to start a summer
Этот клип очень дорого стоит, но думаю, поебать, сколько он стоит. Это видео отбивает все бабки полностью: от и до. Если бы они выпустили только это видео и его можно было бы смотреть, то я бы купил его за семь тысяч, и мы бы смотрели его на стриме по КД. Вообще по хуям, сколько стоит этот видос, вот эти деды окупили его с ног до головы. Если вы скипнули этот клип то вы просто гетеросексуальный урод и невежда.  Это ебаный шедевр и скачок от Tenacious D и Джека Блека, который никто от него давно не ждал и не верил. Мы были как настоящие фанаты, как Зулин со слезами на глазах, ждали этот релиз, понимая, что там все равно будет говнище века.  Но нет, удалось выпустить хорошую песню и клип. Я просто в шоке и хлопаю этим ребятам стоя.
Let's get the full version please!  I can watch it forever!  😂
Also since body shaming and fat naming is not good anymore- they look hot, i want body like that
Full version please!! <3 we have the pick of destiny <3
Men are fucking awesome.
🐖🐷😂
Im hard
Stay weird my friends!
adorable
I need the full version please
Jack is a great singer. I'd like to hear him sing a bit more seriously and less tongue in cheek though. I feel like he's hiding behind his comic chops and not letting us see the real, vulnerable amazing dude that he is.
murri🤭
This was adorable shot. The actors' play was awesome
hey guys, I've a joke for you : Santa claus and bowser running on a beach...
I'm a proud 86 year old.  Is this what the computer is?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍
Fuck me this makes me a grown ass man cry like a blubbering whale by half way through every time. It's so beautiful. These people are beautiful. Love yourself folks, there isn't enough time on this shitball of a green earth to hate each other and ourselves.
I was happy and then I saw this video. Now I'm the happiest person alive. Thank you.
We need a full cover of this song, please. Don't tease us like this.
What kind of drug?
Мама, это лучше, чем владеть всеми богатствами мира.
HOW COULD THEY TEASE US LIKE THIS!!

素敵な体型やな～手ぶれで酔いそうやけど✨
Thanks :)
highly disturbing
🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Sick!
Two beautiful Mermens . Is this kind of stuff that elevates Tenacious D to a high level only available to the greatest bands ❤
Pls make of full cover album❤
Santa claus in underwear! 🤣
Absolutely beautiful ;)
I love it 🎉
Never has the human form been shown displaying such grace and beauty.
The live performance has more heart jack.  I feel you there, not so much here.  Regardless of my opinion, (I'm a nobody anyway) you are still incredibly talented.
Santa Claus and his little helper after selling all gifts on ebay. Enjoy the little things.👍
What a magnificence!
Это пародия на геев чтоли...
why so short?
That's so damn authentic i spontaneously grew a beer belly
True masterpiece <3
His voice is hugely underrated.
next chapter needs to be both of them frolicking in the woods
Where's the full version damnit!
Great track, great cover, just a shame JB sold himself out to Pharma, but I guess when you make a deal with the devil you've got to pay your dues when he comes to collect.
Who needs a filter if you are that aesthetic
Perfect!
To some people a little chubbiness looks good. Here is a prime example two species of human. :D
My boss caught me looking at 2 fat men in their underpants running in the beach. We stared awkwardly and i said, "Tenacious D" and he nodded with approval
❤️🙏
sorry forgive me
This is why I love you guys!
They already made the best song in the world, and now they made the best video in the world.
Heafty peckers gentleman
This cover did not need a film clip
Ребята вы крутые!
Two fat grandfathers brrrr. How did it get so many views at all. That you have cockroaches in your heads or something🤢🤮🤮🤮
So nice to see this man taking the p... out of themself and showing their inner child....Epic!
Legends ❤
Wtf Creepy
And they were never heard from again……….
Awesome
D for diabetes
Another masterpiece👌
This is the best thing that I have seen in 2023.
This is what this society needs: A glimpse into what real world happiness is
Why does the underwear have to be thin and white 😃 😀 😄 😁 🤣 😂
so good so cute XD
please lean into this more fellas! Redo of sweet baby Sass quash?
Love this guys
WHERE IS THE REST OF THE SONG
hands down the best thing ive seen on youtube in a while
Great, now all I can see is Bowser... -_-
This is what real love looks like! 😍
He's getting beyond weird
when i look at those guys: 👀 HOLY SHIT THATS BALL-
Вітя, то ми, два діда!
I've been in love with Tenacious D from the beginning. Jack black and I will be married at the age of 70 😂😂😂❤❤
Jack breaking that wave was beautiful. Whether he was just bracing for it or that he broke it for the two of them. It's amazing
I'm in tears
Effin love it. Y'all are great shizz. Life goal to get to this level of awesomeness.
Why does the instrumentals sound like Dwarf Fortress LOL
Too bad this isn’t the full song, sounds great
I'm traumatized
why is there so much auto tuning on it?
I have a lot of regrets in life. Seeing Tenacious D open for Ween at Red Rocks circa 2000 is NOT one of them!
KG is packing at least a full KG in those tighty whities!
Like a children! Awesome!
Hi from Ukrain!
Это американский пророк самбой ?
“Gas” is definitely an appropriate name with a hog like that
peaches peaches peaches... xD
This video gives me pure joy!! Love these guys.
I don’t know how to make a sticker of that moment Mr Kyle Gass gets literal water wings, so I’m asking for your help. Lol, I don’t know how to message them either
I’m not sure what just happened or what this made me feel?!?! But I’m forwarding to many people 😉😉
He gets literal water wings at :50!
Sumo sings on a beach.
Oh man....the HIM version was always my favorite but this might pass it up.
This video made me believe in god again
At first it made me smile, and then his voice took over. Truly one of the greats
Love it !!

my sister hate this song, bcs her crazy ex bf made her listen to this song repeditly. Im going to send her this video. So she can laugh and close that chapeter of her life.
Glorious
😢
So beautiful!!! Tenacious beach😅
Every single moment was the best moment of my life.
Дядь Джэк, ну охуенно же!
honestly.. i love the D. so hard. But I feel like they didn't even try for this :( Literally ran on the beach for 45 seconds, slowed it down and called it a music video. The only humor was the swimwear. The D is better than this, and us D-iscples deserve a little more.. Still love them so much, but lets be real
Ok, but can we talk about how they are running in place the entire time?
I Love you guys ❤️ You ruined this song for me personally with the gay shit.
So I caught a feeling...Had a moment came back for seconds sang along with my dygierdoo nieghbors think I have monkeys in captivity
Just send this randomly to whomever you are closest to lol
Perfection!
Chris Isaac may have launched this song to its iconic status, but The D is keeping it alive with pure majesty.
Me, me and KG talkin bout some sex supreme. Peaches and cream. Just saying this song would also be excellent with this footage.
What a wicked thing to deaue...
Obesity is no joke. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't stop just seing 2 kids running from an old 8mm film
awesome
I thought I would just watch it for a few seconds, then laugh and move on, but got damn once those vocals hit, I just could not stop listening
I NEED THE LYRICS!!! why isnt this closed captioned though :(
Best music video of 2023!
now thats art
Can’t wait for the whole album 🥰
Fuck KG is packing! Am I right???
Aw cmon I thought they were gonna start rolling around together on the beach.
Please full versión
😢My only Wish..have 10 Minutes with my Soulmates ❤ Anyway how much Time is gone 🥺🎯❤️
The Rizz is real
i love these guys😂❤
TD❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
GROSO!
JUST PURE LOVE...I can watch this over and over again. Hair on my hands, arms and neck are all the time on duty. I TRUELY desire Jack and Kyle soft OnlyFans😅
Tenacious D forever 👊🏾💯🌋
MY EYES
I don't know why, but I wanted to use this song in shorts, and his vocals reminded me of Peter Griffin, am I the only one?
i f****** love these guys
Where's the rest of it?
it really is beautifully done
Nothing beats seeing JB with the beefing face of exultant joy and ultimate satisfaction. 🤩 🧡
Tenacious D 2 let’s go  😂😂😂
I love that these two stayed together after all these decades. A good adult friendship that I have witnessed for 20 years. From men to old guys, still being weird.
I bet they did this to finally combat the 700 other bands that have redone this song.  This should end it.  This was the End Game!!!  Loved it.  Made the most sense other than Chris Issac and that hot chick.  Just saying.  🤨🙃😉
Absolutely love this and video and what an amazing cover they are fantastic- wish I knew them ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
As a fellow volumetrically enabled man, I love seeing Jack and Kyle own their shit!
I know it’s meant to be funny but there’s something genuinely lovely about this video, love this cover too.❤
hahahahaha ughhh hahaha Im still laughing hahahaa
This is what peak performance looks like
Damn did a beluga whale get caught in Kyle's underpants
Sounds like bam Margera a little now😂
absolutely not
goddamn this mans voice never fails to amaze me. every single time
Tenacious D being awesome as usual. Please release a full version of this song.
Friends will be friends running naked in the sand
full version NAOW or we riot!!
This version is as soothing as that beach 🤘🏻🎸
Great performance. This made me want to go to the beach in my underwear.
beautiful.. both the sound and the video, 10/10 would watch it agiaN!
I already regret having started this video because now I'm going to be inundated with Jack Black shorts. WHYYYYY?????😢😢😢
Really want to hang out with these dudes.. Seems like they’re always super happy and chill.
all that jug and wiggle i love it
Chills from start to finish....watching them running in slow-mo...😆. 😍 my ears want more thou!
Damn I wish it was a full cover 😢it’s soooooooooo good, I love you guys so much
Потому что так и должно быть :)
EPIC
F#CKING GENIUS!!!! PRETTY AWESOME LOVE YOU JACK!!!
God love you fat babies.😊
Love it
nobody loves no one.
Amazing… that clip turned me on and off at the same time.
Heart wrenching and beautiful
burn my eyes, please.
well the tits got a big saggy, but either than that they've edged like milk!
Some say they are still running on that beach to this day.
😍😍😍😍😍
Love you guys!!! You live forever!
I like to see Jack & Kyle play and sing "Living in America" - Rocky 4 - James Brown
This is what peak performance looks like
you two...the best faces on the internet...thank you for the smile you put on mine.
They gonna do this again? Next month? Next year? I’ll admit they’re talented, but it’s so repetitive. Seems like they only get together for some extra cash. Glad you guys are still good friends. But, I’m out.
Pure Art
Stop making peak content...     Never stop making peak content
The song: oldies, vibe The video: 60 year Olds running around the beach in underwear
Bro that's crazy but yeah all their past songs fill me with hope and joy.
Sexier than Helena Christensen. 😂
I can't believe there used to be a time when I didn't really care for Jack Black. I was just young and stupid. The man is a great actor, singer, and clearly swimsuitmodel.
Jesus Christ my eyes  there is no God after what I just witnessed just why why for the Love of All that is holy
I needed this #tenaciousD
So many great young bands working their asses off to make a living and a famous actor's novelty cover band getting 4m views in 5 days. God help us
Kyle gass has a wicked thing
I don’t know where to look, so I’ll just listen lol
Jack & Socrates?
PLEASE BE A SECRET GUEST AT GLASTONBURY!
I remember wishing to see tits in the original Chris Isaak vid.. I wish I hadn't in this one
How can you run that hard and make it nowhere?
Right
what kind of camera is the video made with?
How do they still have it? Can you not take a single L. What magnificent boys.
this clip broke my romantic evening with my wife
4x it's the perfect time speed to see the original video
this... this is art.
Why is this so short?? i want the full song. Actually like it even better than the original. Even more heart wrenching
Huge! Great! Wonderful! I can not find more words
I am obsessed with JB's voice, it is everything
Mustve watched this pretty high the othr day because i just listened to this masterpiece and thought these guys never fail to amaze me to then comment to see a comment from 2 days ago saying "never fail to amaze me"
Kings.
It's funny how obviously they put a fat rock in their crotch to make it look big... *sniff* I hope
What happened to the older music this is an entire different genre but I still like it
Probably the most romantic video ever made!
Give me eye mixer pls
damn man, i wish i could be this happy
Fantastic Track! Too short :(
Majestic
No woman could ever be as funny as a man.
That was so joyful! ❤️ It.
breathtaking
Put a smile on my face, thanks guys ❤
Yeah we definitely need a full version!!! That was dope!
KG is fantastic guitar player ❤ loved every second of it and JB voice is melting perfectly into the sound of the strings vibrating 😊 It's funny how they managed to make such an beautiful peace of art and they are just two dudes running thru the wawes with bellys jiggeling 😅 and also the KG swim panties are sparkling 🤩
Not my proudest fap
Here for the giant hog comments…
♪♫ Lyrics: What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you  And I don't wanna to fall in love No, I don't wanna fall in love With you  Nobody loves no one ♪♫
very tasteful!
god i love this
Masters at work
Time waits for no man. Enjoy your days on this earth.
This Was A Dope Cover
made my Day!
Holy sh*t :D :D Perfecto!
I love these guys so much.
The struggle for happiness is what makes it for me one of the greatest videos of all time.
you may not like it but this is what peak physical fitness looks like
that's one way to business expence a trip to the beach :)
i love this tune, this covers amazing
GIVE ME A FULL VERSION RIGHT NOW 😠😠😠😠 this is so good
Tenacious D for life!
magic
Genial ❤
Тот самый момент, когда батя с дедом выбрались в Сочи и балдеют по полной))0
They're very funny guys, but do we really want to watch them become an old gay couple who look like they're on their way to a hobo lemon party?
ITS ALIIIVE
LONG LIVE THE D!!!
Kyle gas has been working on his cock push ups
HAHA Chris Issac remake
Tenacious !!!!
His Voice in Kombination with the Guitar giving me Goosebumps! Just perfect!!!
Sigur Ros would be so proud.
This should be banned, too many boobies bouncing around.
Legend says this music video cost 5 million dollars to make...
This cannot be unseen
The best and most majestic people ❤
Beautiful
We need a full version... nowwwww
Wonderul
RIP Chris Isaac, your one song where you licked sand off a super model will live on for eternity
Nice swimsuit Jack.
🤩🤩
At first I was worried that you’d ruin a classic song, luckily you performed it beautifully and I only need to gouge my eyes out.
IN YOUR FACE ....Gym influencers...
I just imagined the big hole our world would have without Jables and KG. Pure love for this guys ❤
Y’all r a fkn international treasure! ❤
It’s sometimes easy to forget just how talented Jack and KG are.   I wish they’d release a longer version of this, it’s incredible.
Funny how we all look like babies in our old age
The voices wow 😯😯😯
No notes. chef's kiss!
Lol I fuckin love this guy.
Imagine you’re sitting on the beach and these two run by
jack black will forever be my hero in all aspects of the word
this is a how to cover a song and make it even better
"Like watching the Gods return to Olympus"
⚡💯
What in the fuck does Jack black have to do with it
I still haven't seen a studio version from Tenacious D of Kiss From A Rose by Seal, the live version of which Seal himself said was the best version ever when they did it on American Idol
Because I've learned that platonic love can exist between two grown men.
Sublime.
This is to princess peach
🥹
This voice man. THIS VOICE!
It's as if you took 2 garden gnomes to a beach and they came alive!  This is what I believe they would do! Awesome!
We dont deserve these men, these hunks, thank you Tenacious D
I once loved
I think Jack Black and Dr Disrespect are the two greatest entertainers to have ever live. Your opinion could surely differ but would be, objectively, a subordinate opinion, indeed!!!
JB's voice...ugh  so fucking talented
That. Was. Wicked.
Rocky and Creed haha
This is how freedom feels like, Merica.
Beautiful guitar, the voice is pretty good but I think this video was banned in 14 countries.
OMG. I value authenticity above all else in the human experience. This is authentically...not sure, but it is definitely "authentic."  Can you claim that something "is" and put it in quotes? Hah! On another note, The Who is my favorite band of life. I am 59, and my 23 year-old daughter Lily bought me a vintage Who t-shirt for my birthday last year, which rules.  : )   I love that band for many reasons, chief among them being authenticity. I have also been known to claim that they "invented punk."  : ) Anyhoo, because I am clearly psychotic, I liked and subscribed and will forward this to Lily so that she and her boyfriend Brian can get inspired to recreate this scene somewhere in Maui where they live. Lily's father Lawrence and I live on the Big Island of Hawaii, so we will be recreating this scene somewhere on the big rock.  Finally, I will not even venture a guess at how many times Lily, Lawrence, and  I watched School of Rock together. So Damn good. Mahalo and Aloha. : )
This is so funny :D
Amazing
When the Bromance is getting to be a bit "SUS"
No disrespect to Rage but Jables you are the fucking man!
felicidade abundante =)
After the response you 2 received from this shortened version can we get a full length song? Please.
Why is this not in 4k?!
A vitória da beleza americana! kkkkkk
Better than the original
Wholesome ❤
Imagine being at this beach and randomly seeing these two legends!
This video clip explains why I love these two ❤😂❤
I crave the whole song.
Now all I need is a Tom Ellis and Jack Black duet of Wicked Game and I might die happy 🤩🤩😍
It’s official, Tenacious D is my spirit animal!
Heard it 2 days ago in Prague live. Amazing, amazing concert, amazing show.
There will only ever be one Jack Black.
why did i click on this ?
This video makes me want to drink a glass of water.
Awesome vocals by JB as always but still surprised by it. Also KG guitar mmm mmm (chefs kiss)
RUST
beautyfull . god send this angels to us
we need a longer version, below 2:30 it's not a song is a refrain!!!
Two beautiful people, give us a full version!
The sea.. the waves.. the freedom and friendship. The bouncing. Legendary.
Wow, incredible, both Jack and Kyle killed it and now I just want the full version
I thought cold water made it shrink :O
Jack Black in every video or photo he's in: Look how fat I am! I'm relatable!
You absolutely LOVE to see it! How can you not smile with pure content when watching a piece of art like this!?
My wildest dreams have come true!
Mint 😎👌
What a great persiflage/satire to that weird chris isaak video.
Masterpiece
this is the best slow motion I ever seen
Jack Black what can we say
😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏
Lookin' ripped ^^
Ah, yes, the rare sighting of Tenacious D  Sapiens in the wild. Bravo. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😊
Bow to the D.
One of the best covers of the song ! 9.5/10
Valió la pena nacer
ALTER NUR SCHEISS SCHNAPS UND BIER WERBUNG DRECKS SCHEISSE
Tenacious D...who has, _for decades now,_ repeatedly gifted us with the very things we didn't even know we needed. 🤘😆
I thought Johnny Cash died.
Too short ❤ I love it ! But tooo shoooort !!!
Omg😂😂😂 is Jack Black actually singing? Sorry… yea I live under a rock.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Ha ha
somehow hypnotic. can't stop watching
Tenacious D does life right. I love it! MV is ✨Muwah✨ *chefs kiss*  And the cover gave me chills!
Look at these two athletes!
Most pure music video I've seen. The slow motion was just icing on the cake.
If you have ever wondered --->   why so many lesbians ?  ....... well here it is........
Beatyful😍😅
Ахахаха, Джек Блек просто жжот 🤣
Needs to be longer !
Lmao
This made my day ❤
Chris Isaak has been awfully quiet since this dropped.
I absolutely LOVE these guys. My life would not have been the same without having found The D lol
Goddamn Jack has an amazing voice, he could be quite successful with his music if he'd take it seriously
😢 Just Pure Art❤
I seen a sock
SO god damn majestic
Omg full version please!!
It's too short, we need more!
Bert has gotten really fat
Guys you're soooo talented! Love ya❤
2 beached whales 🐳
Only the D can pull this off!!! Hello yeah!!!
Impossible not to love Jack black. What a huge funny soul :)
😂😂😂
Not the best song in the world but pretty close.
Art
Love you Jack and Kyle!
Hilarious 😂
Wicked cover and the perfect video to go with it! BUT WHY NOT THE WHOLE SONG?
These boys are aging gracefully
The best video of 2023...
Am i the only one gony mention the white Y fronts 🌭 🤭 sweet jeezus!
это пиздец. Этот клип очень дорого стоит, но думаю, поебать, сколько он стоит. Это видео отбивает все бабки полностью: от и до. Если бы они выпустили только это видео и его можно было бы смотреть, то я бы купил его за семь тысяч, и мы бы смотрели его на стриме по КД. Вообще по хуям, сколько стоит этот видос, вот эти деды окупили его с ног до головы. Если вы скипнули этот клип то вы просто гетеросексуальный урод и невежда.  Это ебаный шедевр и скачок от Tenacious D и Джека Блека, который никто от него давно не ждал и не верил. Мы были как настоящие фанаты, как Зулин со слезами на глазах, ждали этот релиз, понимая, что там все равно будет говнище века.  Но нет, удалось выпустить хорошую песню и клип. Я просто в шоке и хлопаю этим ребятам стоя.
😆
Great wardrobe choices. You have to love how much Kyle's suit looks like tighty whiteys.
Saw u just this weekend on Rock am Ring, and now that i see the video, i finally understand the life.
This is so beautiful. Both video and song.
What a noble creatures ❤❤❤❤
I love Jack's voice, and just how he is what he wants to be.    Life goals!
From Nacho Libre to Pearl Jam vibes
А на нормальную камеру нельзя было снять?!
Бесконечно можно смотреть на три вещи: на горящий огонь, на звёзды в ночном небе и на полуголых бегущих толстяков в замедленной съемке.
makes me want to go surfing in Borat swimmsuit
Ummm someone Spelt gay wrong
Best cover ever
Damn, TOTAL MISSED OPERTUNITY. I'm sure these guys could have pulled off a total ripoff EXACT COPY of the original vid. It surely would have ... BROKE THE INTERNET.
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!!!
These were by far the quickest 2 minutes of my life.
Maaan, I looped the shit out of this. This cover as short as it is brings so much emotions. Thank you JB/KG❤💪🏆
Ooohhh Gott 😂 Watt wenn die Windel fair rutscht 🍑🍆 #Glück🍩🍄😂😅
ΟΛΟΙ ΓΕΛΑΣΑΝ..ΑΛΛΑ ΘΑ ΗΘΕΛΑ ΝΑ ΜΠΟΡΟΥΣΑ ΝΑ ΤΟ ΚΑΝΩ ΑΥΤΟ ΣΗΜΕΡΑ ΜΕ ΤΟΝ ΠΑΤΕΡΑ ΜΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΤΟΝ ΘΕΙΟ ΜΟΥ..ΠΟΥ ΕΦΥΓΑΝ ΝΩΡΙΣ..
looooool
Best music video ever, sometimes less is more.
His eyes at the end fixed and passing the camera like that a complete art of genius 👌👌
Not sure what this is about, but it certainly has a happy fun vibe, cheers for that! 😀
With all the woke / gender political rubbish going on in this crazy world right now, there's always light at the end of the tunnel
If this doesn’t win some kind of video award I’ll be shocked 🤣🤣
Full version… please lads. Stunning cover.
Another inspirational moment from Bowser, thank you.
🐾🐾🐧 # meg pain lich🌬🌊🌋 stronger VOICE 💣☻😅
Wichu
That camera person has seen some shit.
I really was hoping they won’t catch each other
This is so good, what the actual fuck
Thnx for this “good morning” !
what a masterpiece
some dont like it but this is what peak male athletic body looks like
My girlfriend watched this and said "Aww this is cute, jack black made a video with his dad."
Man I wish I could be that happy
“We chew”
Long live The D!
Reminds me at the big splash scene in rocky 3
Ville Valo of former HIM sent me here. Wasnt disappointed. 😂👍 Thanks, you guys.
hahaha <3
wonderful guitarplay and voice singing.
How have I come here?!
💥💥💥 Красавцы 😊
You are like the Gods returning to Olympus
This clip is actually quite beautiful  and profound eve. Thought they taking the pies
friendship goal
Wunderful interpretation and such a authentic clip, quite sympathetic
best version ever
I love this so much. Until Jack Black sings "witchu" instead of "with you" and then the whole thing is ruined.
Why am I in tears 😢
Дедушки снова забыли принять таблетки 🤣
beautiful
Chris Issaak was tenacious
Тупо топ!, пожалуй лучшее что я видел.
Seriously under appreciated set of pipes the black has
Here's a lesson on living.
Kyle looks like Santa ona summer holiday and Jack is his elf helper xx
I think my favourite thing about this video, is that it really just lands sexually for a select few. Good for them. Hope it makes their week.
ok
Legends👑👑
The friendship these 2 have is just above and beyond ANYTHING I could ever hope for. If these 2 never met…. Just imagine
Wow...I had no idea slow mo wet 'meat and veg' was just what my day was lacking...until now
Best of all !
Damn, you guys still rock, I'm a fan forever
This clip right here encapsulates why nobody even past, future or present can replicate Jack black this man is a legend.
Anyone else find themself getting quite nervous that something they don’t want to see is coming at the end. Strangely dark for a pair of Santa’s frolicking on the beach.
Outstanding
😊
Where is the full cover!? Welcome to the wait everyone who is just watching this for first time.
Day made.
Bring back Baywatch! :) Seriously though, what a fantastic cover!
ALL OF THE SONG, YOU TRANSCENDANT BASTARDS 🖤🖤
What a way to start the day.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
grace to the fullest
kyle has a big dingus
I didn't know I needed this until I saw the video.
Santa and his elf go to the beach
Sexy hairy chubby daddies run at the beach.... That is pure gold ❤
Can't believe they got Socrates to do a cameo.
GOTTA SEE JACK BLACK ON THE MASKED SINGER !!
My eyes! They burn ooh.
Это пиздец. Этот клип очень дорого стоит, но думаю, поебать, сколько он стоит. Это видео отбивает все бабки полностью: от и до. Если бы они выпустили только это видео и его можно было бы смотреть, то я бы купил его за семь тысяч, и мы бы смотрели его на стриме по КД. Вообще по хуям, сколько стоит этот видос, вот эти деды окупили его с ног до головы. Если вы скипнули этот клип то вы просто гетеросексуальный урод и невежда.
That'll be the 20th time in a row I am listening to that sound, is everything normal doc ?
😍🥰😭😍🥰😭
Dude Kyle's fuckin packing
Why is Jack running on the beach with Santa?
Unfortunately  uncomfortable to watch,  but awesome to the ears.  Go blimskie
The imagery is reminiscent of the photography in the booklet for their debut album.
I wish it would be longer.
Ugly and fat is the New beautyfull!
I beg you, give us the full version!
Second only to HIM!
Iliuka Maddison’s favourite clip.
beatiful! simply beautiful! in our hearts we all stay 16 forever! :)
Скуфидон
This video is so wholesome, this kind of happiness is the peace I aim to experience in life
Скуф из лайф
It makes me happy to know that this will remain on the internet for all of eternity.
These two...i love them
Awesome… tenaciously tasty
Kyle gas got a big  Helmet head
I've never seen such an esthetic piece of art 🥺🙏🏻
If I close my eyes and listen to this song I see Jax and OP from SoA ronding there bikes in pure joy
Just the nicest, purest guys with insane talent ❤
we definitely need the d now more than ever... that was awesome.
That was majestic as fuck
Who asked for this? I want to know...
Малютки здесь?
Jack and Kyle are probably two biggest and most hilarious musical weirdo duet in this era 😅
))
Cant wait to see you in Rotterdam net week
I did not recognize Jack Black and thought this was some gay bear thing from my algorithm.
As these two Rock Gods crash into the waves, I am reminded of the fiery licks which flowed through their finger 🤘🏻 tips, as they gave Satan 😈 himself a run for his money, which revealed their legacy
It's almost hypnotic
Don't even miss Helena Christensen in this one, the joy is beautiful to behold
Perfection.
The Majesty of it, I need to up my beer intake big time 🔥
Honestly, it’s about time 😅
Genuine artistry and good guys! Shine on you crazy diamonds <3  PS: Good to see Nacho Libre still following the Lucha training regime :)
😂😂😂
So.... Jumanji 3 confirmed?
I love this so much!
FINNALLLYYYY!!!!
I instantly fell in love with Tenacious D!
Bowser sings pretty dang good!
Glorious.
So unhealthy. Gluttony, zero self-control, zero respect for their own bodies.
Better than original!
😮😮 Ok now HIM has the 2nd best cover of this song in my heart
Une version longue c'est possible ? 😊
Need an extended version
I swear this is better than the original
Imposible contenerse ante tanta sensualidad tan poéticamente presentada. ❤❤❤
There's a certain group that they are gonna like this for other reason
Two of my favorite heart attacks in waiting trotting over the water like Jesus Horses.  Amazing.
Greatest band in the world love you gentlemen.
Stupid
Dear all, Muistikirja has just released a new remix of the legendary Chris Isaak's Wicked Game, called "Wicked Isaak". Enjoy!  https://youtu.be/vG6ZXD2HZTE
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
why is jack black "hanging out" rob reiner?
i feel like some prosthetics were used in filming this lol
Kyle rocking a solid gut.
Men with big titties scare me!!!
Hilarious and worthy cover
peaches man
Do a kickflip
Funny as shit but for gods sake its beautiful!
Body positive❤
Might this be the greatest video on YT!
I absolutely treasured that video. Beautiful work, fellas!!
:)  A teaspoon of baking soda mixed with water after each meal. It releases gas and reduces the size of the "abdominal muscles".
My heart ♥
what a fucking masterpiece. less than 2 minutes and captures centuries of emotion
👏👏👏👏
Bravooooo!
lol Jack is so weird in the finest possible way. I hope he has kids because he would be such a fun dad!
Two talented fat guys struggling in ankle-deep waves for 17 seconds. The Art Of Not Giving A F**k...so perfect.
Блять! Это просто великолепно! Я даже не знаю, как лучше выразиться, чтобы передать всё великолепие! Конечно, это гордые и смелые мужчины честной судьбы!
It's like watching the most majestic manatees.
Noh boday, luh noh woahhhhhnah
🐈👈🙀
Man this stone tastes quite sour
I mean this is heavenly
We need the full cover!!!!!
My god....masterpiece!
Glittery tighty whiteys. You thought of every joyous detail. 💖
Amazing
well i don't know for the lyrics but i love you omg
4 million in 4 days , People still want the D!!!
Bowser will go far!
Ummm, just no.   : )
jack Black's body giggles less. dude is tough.
I love you guys
I love JBs falseto, it's so natural and pretty
Singlet On Jack Blacc Wrestling Now Yall 😂
Bowser !!
#jackblack
Growing up with the D has been one of the greatest blessings of my life.
Go wonderboy😂👌
thank you!
Maravilhoso in so many ways!
This is so majestic
would love to have the chrods for this song
What IS THIS GARBAGE 🤮
this song is one of my favourite and for you guys to cover it makes it that much more better
This would make a PHENOMENAL screen saver!
Love it or hate it, THIS is what PEAK masculinity looks like.  There's no denying it.
Should be a crime to be this sexy
This the only way possible I'm watching two pot-bellied middle-aged scantily-clad men running in slow motion on a beach and I'm perfectly okay with it.
Majestic
"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away from but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you." You Know Who from "You Know Which Show"
This.. was actually beautiful. I knew it would be great, but didn’t know it would be so lovely.
This song always makes me cry.  Now I cry then laugh.  Thanx Guys!
The greatest piece of video footage since Gary Patterson filmed Bigfoot.  This could change everything we know.  God speed gentlemen.
Jack's just showing off his massive package XD
Amazing as always ❤
Tomika
Kage is absolutely PACKING.
Que lindo!
That's some good man-boob.
I want to know how long it took for  these two to decide to do this shoot.    My gut says seconds, not days or weeks.
It's criminal that this is so short.
Body positivity.
Remember that rocket full of all the best examples of human civilization and advancement in art and intellectual achievement? What are we even doing anymore.
Helena Christensen did it better boys 😜
There is only one Jack!
Damn I didnt know jables was packin like that
Love this
Кто тут тоже от шмыги?
Waterplay with Santa
😂😂 I love these guys 🤘
Good music.
goofy as they may be, this is a legitimate cover.
Love this version. My names Lee😊
heart up out of the gloom like no one else fuck
I think.. I fell in love!
Hellfest ❤
The guitar, the vocals, the cinematography.... It doesn't get much better than this 😂  Jack Black, and the man who's going to kick my f**king ass (you know...his name is Kyle Gas), you guys are still rocking n f**king rolling strong, I love you guys.
I don’t think I’ve listened to a song this many times in one day.
wealth
This is the kind of joy of living that everyone should be striving for. :)
The cover of the song and this friendship are two beautiful and great things! I love you Kyle Gass and Jack Black! ❤❤
This has killed my favourite song so hard. An instant classic, an instant ballad of pure art. My only criticism is that it's not long enough, I hope you release a full cover of this song as it hit me in all the feels and more.
Jack Back patrimonio dell'umanità
Instant banger!  "It's a cover dude."  I SAID! "INSTANT BANGER!"
this is what it feels like when you are running in your dreams
Well hey it’s Pride month so you know Bears get to frolic too.
Why haven’t you done this song years ago because Jack has the perfect voice for this
Beautiful in every way. I’m not being sarcastic. There is genuine beauty in this.
Love it! You guys should do a cover album and add behind blue eyes
Beautiful
Hahah too good looking fella
watch this on 2x speed, muted
This screen is wider than my ex.
That was nothing short of fantastic
Beautiful ...... and the music is pretty good too .. 😄
This Baywatch remake is going to be awesome.
😂🤣😂🤣
There’s beauty one can’t unsee, forever lasered into the retinas. The thought of missing something extraordinary securing the eyelids aghast! Poetry in motion, and the soundtrack to exquisite majesty. Nailed it! 😂
Good vibes bruda
Best clip ever ! ! ❤❤
Majstersztyk :D
Still crushing ❤
Least someone's having fun
Im mad just caused lol
I love it Justin caused
why is everything flopping?
Two bears at the beach
Jack Black rockin the Scott Steiner early 90's wrestling tights 🤣
"the men were drawn to the sound of the Siren's Song"     Me: "i ain't mad that these 2 guys are the Sirens"
This is great!
🥰😍😍🥰
Yeeesssssss
Majestic.
Os véi do saco
Dude KG looks like he’s packing some serious meat when he’s first running then he runs up to the camera and you can tell it’s mostly balls
What legends before us. ❤
This world needs the D now more than ever, thanks babies
Need a full version so bad!! pleeeeeeaaasssseee I’m begging! One of my favorite songs 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Romantic one
Beautiful ❤
Kyle is looking more like Rick Rubin than Rick Rubin does rn
Damn Kyle is PACKING
This is the greatest and best video in the world...
What a great song
Kyle's packing some serious heat. Looks like he's smuggling a summer sausage in there :)
I got the chills <33333
Kyle, the beard it's just... How do I say this other than Majestic!
Never have I been more aroused
Не знаю че так Мадисон проперся с этого. Это даже не их песня и у них есть намного круче
Siete dei fighi!!!
Please give us the full version! The vocals and the guitar are both too awesome to not have a full version. That said, this video is a masterpiece 👏
That was inspiring and motivating and I must try this.
Такие молодые
OMG, the tighty-whiteys!!!
Why did I feel so nostalgic watching that? 😂😂
So amazing….
I hate to say it but this might be better than the original…
Epic ring entrance for the Royal Rumble and the next Intercontinental Tag Team Champions!
Silliness apart - the man can sing :-)
Godlike sensual!
Wow true friendship❤
Ich bin dein deutscher Kommentar.
I'm happy to see u happy
youth is in our head and the rest doesn't matter anymore! ❤

This is the best song in the World.... . . . . . . . . . . . . tribute. 😁
Fantastic
love it
Now go and watch the original Chris Isaac video and realize why this is such a genius video
Now we know what "Tribute" was about.
Thank you
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaay chicken
MMMMMMMM BOOBIES!!!!
The video is only slightly hiding the fact that JB rocked our socks off with his voice on this one
Minus the shrinkage, this is solid!
Dude you guys try to be funny which you are…..the funniest, but you guys also really tap into that thing. That real thing. Y’all are talented AF. AND bring joy constantly to the world. Love you boys
Wow The Natural Disasters ! Earthquake and Typhoon what a tag team ! Never new they could sing👌
What graceful kelpies are these?! 😯✨️
You simply cannot not love these guys ❤️
Jesus Christ why did i see that???
Im a giraffe 🦒
Love this cover and RIP the beach will never be the same again :D
Супер! Браво!
This actually belongs on porn sites.

Hollywood Jack finally got off his high-horse

I am no longer afraid to go back in the water... I'm gunna find the massive movie shark and hug it... Be calm my toothy friend, every thing will be just fine. 😂
So tragic and beautiful, but where is Val Kilmer?
Chris Isaac's done right, lol
This video is great on so many levels.
Just in time for Pride Month 🏳️‍🌈
wtf did i just watch
I expect to see the sequined underpants on the merch table at the next show, please.
Why tho you want credit for a cover that's crazy release your own shit
Amazing singer.
It always amazes me at how well Jack Black can sing!
selling your soul is never beneficial. you were already talented
Totally love you guys and just got to see you live again this weekend at Rock im Park while volunteering as an emergency doc for the festival and I gotta say that you guys alone already made it all worthwhile <3 All the best to you lads - may The D rock on forever more!
Damn, Jack Black sounds a lot like Zakk Wylde in this vocal style
😂
Its like watching a horrific car accident while listening to beautiful music, and wondering if these studs are going to mate offscreen. You cant unsee it.
Sarcasm is not art
🤩🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everything bounces
I want a full version for god sakes !
❤❤❤
So cool
это лучшее что я видел за день))  p.s. а кавер классный. очень крутой голос.
Это пиздец. Этот клип очень дорого стоит, но думаю, поебать, сколько он стоит. Это видео отбивает все бабки полностью: от и до. Если бы они выпустили только это видео и его можно было бы смотреть, то я бы купил его за семь тысяч, и мы бы смотрели его на стриме по КД. Вообще по хуям, сколько стоит этот видос, вот эти деды окупили его с ног до головы. Если вы скипнули этот клип то вы просто гетеросексуальный урод и невежда.  Это ебаный шедевр и скачок от Tenacious D и Джека Блека, который никто от него давно не ждал и не верил. Мы были как настоящие фанаты, как Зулин со слезами на глазах, ждали этот релиз, понимая, что там все равно будет говнище века.  Но нет, удалось выпустить хорошую песню и клип. Я просто в шоке и хлопаю этим ребятам стоя.
Это в миллон раз круче чем синематики в диабло 4.это настоящий прорыв!
Dad?
MORE!!
I think you just won over the whole bear culture...
Absolute UNITs, I'm in awe of these lads!
адепты мэндельсона объединяемся
tenacious D 2 PLEASE !
why? why did you make me watch this?
If they were never comedians then they would of been the best rock stars .
XD
Jack Black's voice is a combination of Fergie and Jesus. If you close your eyes while listening to this you can picture it.
For glory boys.  For Glory
this version also brought tears to my eyes
Full version!!!!
This is what peak male performance looks like.
haha they're definitely eating whatever they want...take two of those nuggets and throw em away...long live the D!
The Legends are back 😂🎉

HEY RIGHT THE FUXXXX ON FAM!!! LOVE IT! 🤘🤘🤘💙💙💙 😈BrownSugar 😈
Classic & Epic👏👏 them looks on your faces is the ultimate 💜🤘
High School Musical 20 years later.
Yall give me hope for the future!!!
Que le pasa a Colacho y a Bowser? XD
The cover is great, and the video SO HOT!
I needed this. Thank you lord. Thank you Kyle and Jack. ❤
This is a ballad he serenades to the wicked witch.
Peak male physique
This may be a good rule of thumb, but the balance is more important relative to your foot position. Your centre of gravity should be over the centre of lift of the foil, which is approximately 30% back from the leading edge. If you have foot straps, this should be fairly easy to visualise
Love....
🤣🤣🤣🤣
KG looks like he's smuggling potatoes in that thing
The D ain't got no kinda sense!
They played this 2 days ago on the RIP Festival here in germany... they brought big dad energy
Full + extended versions pls 🙏
Majestic.
Why is this the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced 😂
This is beautiful ❤
we now know what santa does during the summer...
Hot Bear man energy <3
Magnificent.
That's scared the shit out of me
Look at those beautiful fat bastards
Is he singing to his bathing trunks?
Jack Black is a sellout! And the music sucks donkey balls.
This is a clip from Sirius XM concert....not the real song...we want the full song!!!
Actualy it's beautiful.
Кто от Короля?
how is King Koopa singing thing ??
Since 4 Days in my fucking Rotation... Yesterday i listened to it 2 hours in a row....one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard in my life. Songs like this make me wanna fall in love again🥲❤️
All that jiggle for real gave me motion sickness
I am a little older than Kyle, taller and heavier, but about the same body shape, like we could be twins there. And I have a long scar over my sternum, guess why. It made me feel good to see Kyle running down the beach with his awesome buddy what's his name (it doesn't come to me intermediately) and I feel much better about myself. Love the sequined trunks!
can i have baywatch? no, we have baywatch at home baywatch at home:  p.s. mesmerizing
Pause on the video… but his version of wicked games is elite, love it l!
FULL VERSION, NOW, PLEASE!
david lynch shouldve used this version in Wild At Heart
Andy Bernard vibes. I like it. Picasso!
Literally just turned my friends on the to original like last month. What’re the odds, came out so good!
Like two mermaids, I love it!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
порадовали, плачу жирными слезами :)))))))))))))))
Άρε Μπαμπίνο Φρουτοτρελιάρη, παντού είσαι…..
Would have liked to see some rolling around in the sand ngl

Happy pride month, y'all!
Kg is hung like a bull loool
Awesome 👍
I'm grateful to be alive in the time of Jack Black
El mejor video del mejor remake del año!!! Jack Black y Kyle Gass  son lo mejores!!!
OH man this made me smile so much thanks for brightening up my day :)
LOL
This is perfection. Period.
The full version will break the internet......
🤣🤓🥸
You know I've never been a fan of covers, but this one is the crucial exception. :)
Kyle is packing heat! He missed his calling in Bear porn but it's not too late
art in it's purest, most majestic and spiritual form. transcendent from start to finish.
This is the absolute JOY that I needed to sea today!!! 🌊 😂🎉 Thank you ❤
My god lol
Big men taking small running steps
An image that will follow my minds eye into the afterlife.
perfection....
Full Release with video, please, we need this.
Been listening to these two for 20 years now. 2 treasures.
Where's the rest of the song? This song isnt only 1:50 long
There is simply way too much sex appeal in this video.
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you 😐
This is so beautiful... 😢
goose bumps when I thinking my dad , my best buddy all time !
A almost naked Jack Black, who doesn't click on this right away! 😅 and the song cover is perfection 💞
The Last of Us?
Pure majestic art,that voice is pure art.
I hope nobody died of a heart attack after this marathon.
Is that Jack Black
Kyle looks like Santa Claus on December 26 after flying off for a well deserved vacation in the tropics somewhere, lol.
Long live the D!
I had an ex girlfriend work for Chris Isaac and apparently he is a diva narcissist grade A jerkface.. not like these two!
Ok that was wierd 🤣
Amazing.. ❤ we should all be so free and so talented
i just want an album of all covers ..... that vocal range never gets old
It's like a fucking pair of lava lamps. Can't..turn.. my.. eyes.. away...sexy.
Есть тут нормальные Славянские мужики, кто смотрит топ клипы?
@Tenacous D, i just love it how you guys just do what you want to do 💞💕
Dunno but this reminds me of peaches. 🤔🥲❤️
Now i understand when my GF says that 1,50 is too little 😢
MAJESTIC
I thought that was Bert kreischer running at first.

Tenacious D: The legacy continues  Coming to a theater near you soon
what a beautiful video ! lol
Кто от Мэда ставьте лайк
Tenacious D out here putting in minimal effort achieving maximum results
Its so hot!
I think this is the best music video of all time - and I’m not fucking joking
This cover and Video remind me not to take life to seriously.
This actually makes me bawl my eyes out
The internet can end now, it won't get better than this.
Pure sophisticated elegance
"Nurse, cancel my 1 o clock"
Gotta love a couple pair of titties floppin free by the ocean
Refreshing
OMG... Jack Black 😂 ahahhahaha
Ich liebe es
This is a wicked thing to do….the video. 😜 Great cover
Awesome job, Jack! Sounds amazing! Better than original! Only negative thing I can say is your West Coast/Pacific oceans are shitty. Gulf coast is so much nicer if comparing U.S. only beaches.
For a moment, I was thinking why Dr. Weil is making music with JB and having fun on the beach LOL 🤣🤣
We need a full version of this song because Jack Black does a beautiful job singing this song. He truly has a great voice .
медисон одобряет
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen
KGs got that HOG
I was waiting for the smoldering, rolling on the beach whilst the waves crash over your bodies montage. Or slowmo running in a circle while clasping each other's hands with the camera panning between your faces. But this works just as well. Love what ya'll do. 😅
Beautiful🤩
Самое прекрасное видео в моей жизни
FANTASTICO !!!
Too bad it wasn't sunnier to get Kyle's suit sparkling even more.
Kyle's packin'
Yes, yes, yes!  More tenacious D please!!!
I tell you this beautifull shit will have at least 12million views
Я от Медисона 😅
Кто от Мэддисона?

Men of the true fate
A melhor versão ever!
Love jack black. Don’t die on us please.
We dont deserve cage and jabbles <3
No auto tune. 😎 rad.
Kyle gas is packing bro
Every other cover artist after hearing this: "Let me just go ahead and delete this video of mine will quick."
This is cool ❤ love TD Jack sings lovely
Today I will be jamming to tenacious d!  And doing 🐔 Push-ups
❤
Клип для мужиков честной судьбы
Dang bro, Kyle looks like he has a hog and fks hard lol!!
Ода настоящим мчс
I have a hunch Chris Isaak loves what Tenacious D has done with his work.
Ruined a great song....
We all know how JB is good at singing, BUT WE CAN ALL TAKE A MOMENT FOR KG GUITAR?! Maaaan the expression he's giving thru the strings it's something mind blowing!
I've only watched this 394 times. I'm ok. 🐻. #woof.
Spicy Awesome Sauce from the D. I expected nothing less! Keep, keeping it real lads! 💯🥰🤗🙌🙌
Whichu
Eto pizdec!
They look like two angels came to our world to perform this song
The way Jack lifts his knees makes him look like he’s floating.  Awesome song and video
this is the most beautiful music video i've ever seen!
This song was phenomenal live in STL
Voz poderosa! Lembra Zakk Wilde.
So good but too short!
Your killing me!
Awesome!
I love this guys! 😂😂😂
Jack Black's talent remains undefeated.
Pretty surprised either of them could run that far.
why do I feel like I just watched Santa and his little elf buddie on summer vacation? 🤣🤣🤣 I love this🤩
Mega ! I love it. 😂❤
Full version please
Full version?!
this is the life i wanna live in
"All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well"
I’m officially hard
Настоящие мужчины честной судьбы
Why are they running but getting absolutely nowhere at the same time
Nothing short of majestic! I hope we get a full version one day!
Excellent ❤
Скуфы на месте?
You can tell this is what true friendship is.  PS, Kyle is packing a 10 incher easily. He was making waves
Came here expecting a cover of The Weeknd or Beyoncé’s Wicked Games….still pleasantly surprised though.
What a couple of magnificent creatures 🤩
Как близко счастья и как далеко
This just made my day. Thank you.
Все скуфы тут!
That's me and my bro)))
TEN D BEST BAND ON PLANET EARTH!
Full song please
I needed this so bad
The fact that jack black is still making music, is heartwarming. Beautiful music
Elegantly beautiful, like watching a sunrise or a lunar eclipse.
This is the e definition of “we don’t give a fuck”. I want to be like them when I get older. Running free!
Poetry in motion!
Привет от мужчин честной судьбы!
they just get it...
This is Epic
I've never stared at jack black's dong so much in my life.
I needed this in my life.
Wspaniałe pozdrowienia z Polski
Have fun- take being too serious outta your agenda and make a loving mess to rally those who suffer for love and truths sake to spread. Bless you all!!
He can’t help but fall in love time and time again…..
Riding on big ass steeds the rode and smoked some weed. Then they ran down the beach for a Wicked Game of Tag but they both sucked at Tag so forever they must drag  The flag, the stag, the Unicorn and Lion!  Tenacious D Rage Cage and JB!  Flying down the sultry sand hand to hand as they tag forever more!  Running across imaginations there upon the shore!   Nudeacious Devo!!!
So sad song.....  The D is back (someone say)  the D never stopped! (We say)
He is such a good writer ❤
Travesty.
Imagine having a duo mate with a shorter name, but only hastagging Jack Black.
WHY WAS THATS SO BEAUTIFUL LMFAO
Sounds like The White Buffalo
Jack pure talent. Legend👏
Oh how far they’ve come from the Rage Cage nearly dying and Hollywood Jack telling the doctors they must use the techniques of their trade to retrieve him.
This video is so hypnotic to watch and I'm not even sure why 🎻😵‍💫
Kyle and Jack is the ultimate bromance. So cute
This is the world I love to live in! Thank you Tenacious D!
Legends!!!
😂😂love it
OMG THIS IS SO GOOD
Wicked Game  is one of the best rapper alive. that's true *AUTHENTIC* *VIEWS* gave him the boost just like many other famous artists but no one can deny the fact he is super talented!! Thumbs up who agree with me
😂😅😆🥰 I can't think of a better way to start the day! I been slayed! Lol!!
cool, I also watched this video and it really came out very cool.  I really liked their work 😎
"Witchoo..." 😆
The heroes we need right now!
EPIC A F! love you guys

Какие милые медвежонки, так бы и обняла их
when a colab with Jack White?
This is pure joy
Bowser droppin another banger.
This is EXACTLY how Chris Isaak wanted to do the film clip, but they forced him to work with Helena Christensen instead.
Bowser covering Chris Isaak. I love 2023
До чого мы дожили детка
Ilyuka was liked this goddamn great song 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
It’s masterpiece
This clip is mesmerizing and riveting. That's what real art should look like. Hope to see the full version
Perfection.

Such clarity. I could see jack smiling the entire time! Beautiful 🔥🤘
This made me happy!😃
Poetry in Motion 😅
I was surprised at how well jack did that. Impressive
Pure Love. Made my day.
Thanks. I can't unsee this 😳
Came out same time as d4 early release 🤔
Baywatch reboot 😂
No one can match Jack’s voice IMO, his satire song and video choices are hilariously original as well, but the man is just pure vocal talent
So that’s what Santa gets up to in the summer
I love the love between these 2 ❤
Magnificent beasts
😎🇺🇸May God Bless You…But(t) Jesus H. F@#king Christ Put a F@#king Real Swimsuit On Before You Scare Away All Those Poor Little Fish That Live Along the Shoreline…😳At Least  Any Children Within Eyesight Of That Horrid Spectacle Can Go To Therapy 😳🤔😂🤣😂🤣
Brilliant 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏
This is the most beautiful piece of art I've ever seen
Fat people running. Hilarious 😂
I f*cking love this. Thanks so much Tenacious D.
This just a pure mockery of a beautiful song.   You guys suck....no talent hacks.....Chris once told Dwight.... to stop doing this song....you need to stop....
I wish I could sing like him. So funny and so good all at the same time
Funny how we all drool over two plump men fooling around. But if them were two plump ladies doing the same with same soft bellies and fleshy arms and legs, we would not be as benevolent
It looks like they're barely moving forward because of the waves going in the opposite direction 😆
Fuck Chris Isaac.  It’s all about the D
sweet jebus!!! is that a grapefruit in there??
Just waiting on the studio recording.
Why does it feel like they are jogging on the spot?
hmm...only 3M views ? I thought it would have been more by now.
That got me a bit emotional to be honest 😭😭😭😂
I love this two man
legendary
Can we not send out a few million drones playing this song and bring about world peace?
Love you guys keep on ROCKING.
I didnt thought Alexander Supertramp is still alive, but he is and he didnt change. LOVE IT!
So awesome. So amazing. ❤
😂😅👏👏👏
Kyle was packing heat until that wave hit his midriff
That open b at the end....lovely
I'm obsessed with this cover. His voice is mesmerising!! Give us the full version please!!!
geniuses
God dam I wish this was the full song, I need more then 2 minutes of these 😭😭😭😭
Made me smile..
Black Jack somehow manages to sound silly and like one of the greatest singers of all time at the same time.
That’s exactly the dream I had last night. Coincidence? I think not.
Two majestic men galloping into the ocean waves
Kyle being brave with his white pants on
👍two thumbs up 👍
If it weren't for the waves in the background, I woudn't know this was slowed way down.
So much D!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Kyle Gass packing a hog
Can't believe Tribute is about twelve years old now  o.O - feels like yesterday
This is wild...
I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. Beautiful 🍀
Jesus Christ Kyle now thats a Package weehw. Watch Out Girls
This is how peak male performance and form looks like, deal with it :)
You bring joy to the earth, mankind is lucky to have you both.
"Witch you" 😂 "Nobody loves no one" Killing it with such a beautiful voice, yet my side hurts! 🤣 We need the full version 🙏
Kind of hate how he makes his singing sound like a joke tho…he’s got such a fantastic voice. Just sing it sincerely ❤
Gold.
@_@
#lifegoals
Not only best band in world but supreme athletes too .
Majestic and beautiful. The mesmerising yet meloncollie rhythm and raspy croak of Black's voice reverberated deeply to compliment every memorable  jiggle of belly fat. I cried once, twice and then thrice and will do so again whenever I visit a sandy destination. This has healed all wounds.
Omg Jack! 😮You sound so good as Chris Isaak!! I'm like In Love with you! 😅🎉😂❤
😅❤😅💕😘 Love You Freaks!!! Forever And Ever!!!
Hypnotic.
Jack Black looks just like my mailman.
KAGE AND JABLES!!! THE UNIVERSE NEEDS THIS SONG IN IT'S ENTIRETY, OR ALL OF HUMANITY IS DOOMED TO MEDIOCRITY AND FAILURE!
This made me smile 👍
Perfection!
Majestic!
Sublime...
Disappointed! No rolling around in the sand? 😢 come on Jack, you can do better than that!
fully my weight class! Best of all is the swim trunk (in German "Badebüx") in glitter. Kyle Gas must have stolen it from a unicorn, which now sits sadly under a tree. 🙂
jb putting borrat's swimwear to shame. and i thought it was impossible....
Corona, Ukraine vs. Russia, and many things more..... but seeing and hearing this.... faith in humanity restored. \,,/, Rock on guys!
They did this live last night in Prague. Full house and everyone joined in. It was beautiful <3
Cage, jb, please do a full rendition of this 🥰
Anyone else see the UAP in the first frame? must be a hidden message, wicked game indeed
Well that's just beautiful you sexy bastards 😂
We truly are living in the best dimension of the multiverse
This song hits different to me.. I'm actually into depression for a while and I'm supposed to come and see you guys in a few days, 13th of june in Brussels, and the fact that this particular song comes out at this particular moment is priceless. Thank you KG & JB for that, can't wait to see you guys on stage for the first time <3
We need a new Album !!!
why are these guys so cool?
This made my day! Great cover, it's amazing, this video is outstanding! :)
I was attentive enough, to notice glittering sequins on Gass's pants. My greatest achievement of the day.
This made me so happy to see.
This is what joy looks like
man look at them baddies swing
Please tell me theres a full version of this coming and this is a teaser
묵직하네요 젝형
Peak male physique for running gracefully on the beach 🤙
I don't know why...but this song makes me smile from the start until it's end. Thank you tenacious D 🙏🙏🙏
Are you here?
So sweet :)

LOVE YOU GUYS!
wtf did i watch?! Can someone dig out my eyes for me
I think i am the devil, i managed to stay focused and not laugh
Pure beauty! And the song is also ok.
fun fact, this was not filmed in slow-mo
You all need some BUD LIGHT. #OXYGEN, #PUFFEDOUT #SLOWMOTION #TANKED.
If I heard the first word of this I would have known it was Jack Black
too short damn, too short!!! <3
omg perfect cover
His vocals sound incredibly good
The video reminded me of my nephew and I fooling around on the beach. I have not seen my family for over a year, but I hope to be reunited soon, after the war.
Why do I cry!? Wholesome just hits me so hard.
About to become my ring tone
Fat men act silly.  It was funny in 2003, it’s not now.
Boobs.
Just imagine that you went on a walk along the beach one day and you witnessed this live
Someone please call Greenpeace and report a beached whale sighting
god tier
I'm watching thinking "PLEASE don't get it on like Chris & Helena, PLEASE don't get it on... PHEW!!!"
❤
Damn, I thought Villie had the battle won. It took old ass Jack Black to dethrone him.
I dare anyone to watch this and not smile.
🤣
long live the d ! 👊
This is perfect 😂
These slowly moving guts are hypnotic.
Majestically frolicking in the ocean, nothing but love.
Body positivity at its finest 💪
Brilliant 😂😂
Noooo I checked Spotify and it's still just the short version?? Why tease us! We want a full length version of this song
We need the full length version of this, it's far too short
Fabulous!
Cuppla stone cold foxes running through the waves, what's not to love?
Full version of the song, please!!!
disgusting
Diablo IV is a wicked game
Великолепный трэк
Art -   Fin
Do the full song, it was awesome
Playback speed at 2 is audibly and visually appealing. The guitars shred and the D is pretty hilarious.
Need the whole song!!
Hahaha love it !!!
can we just appreciate how great Jack Blacks voice is?
Love them for pure steel string guitar sound.
Teasing us with only 1min 49 secs of this awesomeness is a wicked thing to do.
Fantastic
0:55 it's so beautiful
Прям балдею
🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need a full version so bad
<3
Don't forget folks, we live in a society!
I like this but it have to be black-and-white video though. Just because of the original one.
Goddamn Kyle looks so much like a Greek phylosopher, suits the song too.
I just imagined Bowser singing this one.
Some company actually makes _that_ swimming outfit...?! 😬
this is p0rn
Looked like the butt baby thing !
nah man, mute the song, open a new tab, search and play Careless whisper, enjoy <3
They really need to do a full cover album

Awesome! You must do a full cover
Energy.... living in the moment

They are really having the best time of their life
I Love This!
Fantastic ahahha 🔥
"Bromance by Jack Black"
Прикольно)
Not sure if Jack Black or Zac Efron.
Sounds like "Peaches" by Browser 😂
This is bliss! Second, damn they are in good cardiovascular condition! Running on the beach is hard as f
I'm not gay but you boys had my blood boiling haha
The Song is just so short, because the water was too cold right 😅? Love that version!
So sad, those poor sick men are so obese
Отдых в Крыму
The leg strenght to keep these men upright is incredible.
For me this song and videoclip will always be linked to Beavis and Butthead :D
OMG 😀
it's like a traffic accident, you can't just look the other way
"written and directed by terrence malick"
This takes Pride month to the next level. But 1:49 is a shame, i miss times when the songs were 5-10 mins :( now it ends as fast as an average guy last in seggs.
It's cool, but I need the B/W version.  I mean, what are we doing here?
I cried.
D is my favorite band of all time. Keep it up.
Əffet, afət, kəşfet, məhvet şibəlşək

Better than the original honestly
So wholesome and pure
From the album "Brain Bleach".
Not knowing whether to appreciate the beauty of the song cover, or laugh out loud at the beautiful strides by two smiling overweight old and half naked men running on the beach is a Wicked Game.
This will make more money than Little Mermaid ~
They're not the only ones moving
Cheers, crying on the toilet now
FYI this is s COVER. Go look up the original it's great and makes this even funnier.
Tis a Masterpiece!!!🤘❤🌠
I know most people see this band as a parody band. But they have some SERIOUS talent. Great music man.
Me encantó.
This is definitely the audiovisual definition of the word "Wicked", and it applies to all of its connotations.
WHO LET THE HAWGS OUT!!!!
Please burn my minds eye out !
chris isaak feeling
Why is Santa Claus in his underwear
Wow!!! Wasn't expecting it to be this good! 👏👍
You may not like it, but this is what peak male performance looks like
This just brings a smile to my face.
OMG is this the full version I have been waiting for!?!?!
great ❤😂
Full version vote. Upvote here:
those majestic m'fers

magnificent barrel chested specimen
Сподіваюся на колаборацію з Літл Біг
только не говорите мне, что они это делают на трезвую голову)
kkkkkk
Thank you for 119 seconds pure happiness.
That’s some Tenacious D, alright
Best music video ever
Wonderful! Much love from Acapulco.
Well that was both beautiful and hilarious.
It's too late Jack, far too late.❤
That voice ❤
I know everyone is already saying the same thing but I want these guys to scroll the comments and realize every second one is PLEASE MAKE A FULL VERSION! We love you both
Great voice❤
🏳️‍🌈
This is gold. I love everything about it. Literally could fill a page with all the shit about it that is rad. But this comment is just a tribute.
A stunningly beautiful rendition deserves a stunningly beautiful video such as this.
Riveting 👏
INSTANT CLASSIC
Identical to the original video 😂😂
Man i had no idea until recently that "jack black" is actually just a European sounding pseudonym, his real name is yiddish. The more you know, I guess✡
I guess this would qualify as soft core?
You guys got serious problems! 😂😂😂😂😂
These guys can still bang out more cock push ups than all you fuckers and myself included combined!
From that first Tenacious D VHS tape I enjoyed with friends over beers in the 90s to this majestic masterpiece, the D never cease to entertain.  Bravo!
Two words, "F***king Epic."
Shrinkage!!
Tenacious D, please make a longer version of this! It’s so beautiful but so so short! Please!!!
This is phenomenal.
Am i the only one who got put in their feels?
How do they get anything done as I bet when they are together it’s Comedy Gold 🙂
great flash back horrified by two fat guys running on the beach though lol
I think Jack's choice of beach attire is early 90's Rick Steiner's wrestling attire.
Good song. Also... For free? Damn.
Inimigo da timidez
It was of my destiny that the algorithm chose to pick this song for me.
Jews glorifying men being slobs
You may not like it, but that's what the ideal male body looks like
👍
Just scroll down so you can't see them!!! The song is awesome!!!!
this is the greatest! THE BEACH!  🎶beaches beaches beaches beaches beaches....beaches beaches beaches beaches beach AHHH LUUHH-UHHHVVV YOU-UHHH🎶
Oh IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII DON'T WANNA CLICK REPLAY (does)
People need to read the description on the video lol
So glad you guys are still making music. Love it.
This is the truly best thing I've seen this year.  No, scratch that. This.... This is the best thing I have seen since the start of 2020.   This... This is the stuff that radiant hope and happiness are birthed from. Thank you, you glorious beams of love and rock, for creating this! 😭✨🙌🙌  Such magnificent beauty.   I also feel like they were on shrooms
Daisy Gray Vibes 😂😅❤
Very nice
Looks Biblical
Disgusting physical specimens. Beautiful song, wonderful rendition.
Original is an absolute favorite song. This is a phenomenal version.
Hilariously Beautiful.😂😂😂
🥺🥺🥺
We all live just once on this beautiful planet.  This is the way to approach every day. Discard fear and just be!!   Thanks.
My eyes…my beautiful eyes 🫣
Long live the D!
I thought this is an ai video
“Wit choo”
This is likely the most cinematic music video ever made. What a masterpiece.
so good i got chills
Rather see Jack black in a manikkini then lizo wearing stupid stuff
Such a beautiful sounding nightmare inducing video.
The end, when you think that smile is coming for you, and then it just passes by, with a kinda zombie stare, is both heartbreaking and terrifying.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard anything so beautiful before
The other half of the song will be released as soon as their baby was born. 😁
So did not need this...but 😮. Stay blessed as it is evident you musty!
Yes!!! Are we getting some new music and tour?!? Greatest Phucken band ever!!
3 days, almost 3M views wow. Nice work lol
Sexy
Rage Kage packing the heat!
Reminds me of the old Diablo soundtrack
and the beach was never the same.
TY FOR THIS
Y.W.G - Young Wicked is also a Wicked Games Cover
Love you two lol
They are same sex partners
The look in Jack's eyes at the end when he's looking right at the camera... if I were the cameraman I would have been thinking, "oh no. oh no. What is he going to do to me?!?"
Magnificent.
Hearing Bowser singing this song sounds actually good
el Gran Jack Black!!!
This is awful. They look like they are about to die.
awesome!!!
Damn big ten D energy
Nice
I didn't know that i needed this
why do I enjoy watching these two fat dudes run in the waves so much?
Could I have a shoutout pls
that first note
Big Dick Energy
we need the complete version
I love you.
Take some brazilian love straight to that fat badass belly of yours! I also loved the cover too!
I loved this video! As a 50 year old man finding this kind of happiness is hard to come by. In addition to the video the music and singing is great as well! Keep it going Jack and Kyle.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best videoclip ever
I’m so glad Kyle Gas of the Kyle Gas project let jaybles into his band
Friends will be Friends they're running naked on the sand! Friends holding hands will someday surely form a band!
HAHAHAHAHA TOP
The Obese brothers
thats some real man blubber right there respect
It’s the slow- mo scrotum bouncing for me 😂
But why?
😂😂😂😂
seal on the beach with a tiger retriever
This countrified leaning cover is actually the right way to do this song.  You just have to do that voice and feel on a full cover, no question about it.
Nearly 3M views inside of 3 days.  Not bad guys.
Cant... stop... Watching... Kyle's junk bounce around 😐
Never knew I wanted to see Jack Black do a cover of Chris Isaak
Wicked.
Wicked game is one of the best songs. This is one of the best covers.
Man Kyle is getting so old but love the energy he still gives
They brought them beach(ball) bodies!!! Straight dad bod enegry!!! Feelin it.
I thought those were whitey tighties, so imagine my surprise when 1:43 revealed that those things are sparkly!!!😮😂😂
I can't unsee this! Oh well, lol. Great fun and song cover
I got to get me one of them ❤
Greatest cover ever…tribute
Tenacious D is BAAAACCKK!!! we need 7 more mins of this😭😭😭😭
Oh so very sorry as I forgot to say how very sexy you both look😁
Wicked game is one of my all time favourit songs, thank you for covering ❤
So wrong in soooo many ways. Disgusting.
The only thing wrong with this cover is it isnt a full cover! Not often covers are better than the original but god damn, this is a masterpeice
this is a fantastic cover
Jack Has such a unique voice, when is Tenacious D 2 and an Album coming
Brolationship goals.
A decision was made here.
It's a very thin line between confidence, and lack of shame.... I'm not sure what side of the line they're on. Lol 😂
Equally as erotic as the original music video.
OMG I am so in Love with this video! I love the Chris Issak video but this is extra special! When I made my family look at it they smiled liked I did! 😁🥰 Long live Rock and Roll Tenacious D🎶💃💖💞
lots of work went into this one.
Beautiful..... and the song is nice too.
Well that was a coked up video :)
OMG… Love this… 👊🏼💯💙
Breathtaking!
Oh god… my eyes😖
Howdy
Such a beautiful scene which bursting at the seams with pure emotion, sexual tension, and an air of mystery. Creative and inspiring.
Art🚬
I’m sorry, but this wins 2023.
Looks like the water was cold.😂😂😂😂😂😂
KG's huge bouncing balls will now haunt my nights forever.
OGM, this is definition of happiness.
Jajaja es increíble lo bien que canta Jack black
Found my new favorite cover.
Do the whole song! This is amazing!
It really is for the ears only right... XD
i felt like this song lasted at least 3 minutes
Tego nie da się już odzobaczyć
I want Chris Isaak to officially make the same statement than Nine Inch Nails, after Johnny Cash did a cover of their song Hurt,  "What a powerful piece of art. I’m happy I contributed in the way I did. It isn't my song any more.”
OMG!! PLEASE let there be a full version of this. This is the best video I have seen in ages.  You guys make me smile to the point that I can't wipe the smile off my face.  Just the greatest!!!
Ok, 10/10, but where’s the full version? 😭
This just makes sense!
I hope jack black is doing okay. Seems like he is happy . Good for you man you deserve it
Not sure why I find it so interesting how much leg muscle fatter people have.
Jack and Kyle’s excellent adventure.
As long we have music like this we will win.
what peak human performance looks like
I'm conflicted. Impressed by the cover but disturbed by the video. I shouldn't be surprised, they've been running around in their underwear since time began.
Kyle looks like a fat Santa.
What a beautiful friendship
Hope to never watch KG run without a shirt ever again.  That was Wicked
We need a full version of this right now!
Santaaaaa
Jiggling fat is mesmerizing
It's always the simple things in life!
99% of the music I've ever heard, I find myself favoring the first version of a song I listen to. This cover falls within the remaining 1%.
Das schlimmste video ever
One day I want to be like Kage and Jack!
frolicking fat men
Tenacious D too overpowered, need to be nerfed in the next Earth patch.
Imma need a full length version. Sounds amazing
Just 2 guys running along the beach side, and yet it's so LEGENDARY.
Just last night I was watching Cable Guy and saw not one, but both of these fine biological samples on display. It was whipersnapified versions, so not as majestic, but still a good dopamine bump.
What a great take.
One word...majestic
my girlfriend heard this version for the first time and genuinely loved it. She became quite confused upon seeing the music video. Rock on, TD!
I clicked on this (despite? because of? the thumbnail) because I really hoped it was a cover of the brilliant song by Chris Isaak by that name. Absolutely brilliant!
Kyle's hand is locked in guitar pick grip.
I had the pleasure of meeting both of them in Hollywood, CA. Literally 2 of the nicest human beings I’ve ever met. I wish them all continued success and happiness.
Damn you guys…..now I’ll never be able to listen this song without thinking about these visuals.
The absolute crime being commited here is not making a full version longer then 2 minutes.
This video changed my sexual orientation forever. 😊
They probably didn’t even use a slow motion cam
Thanks!  Now, I'm going to have disturbing nightmares involving scenes from Chariots of Fire, "10", Rocky III and Shallow Hal! 😨
Nah mate, Chris Isaac's is the only true wicked game
I like Tenacious D but this was unnecessary
❤❤❤I love everything about this.  Perfection in both the audible and the visual joy!
A Toast the the best bards in the Milky Way, hats off my friends o7
that was beautiful
this is better than the original
legends
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I adore these grown babies
Need to be in black and white
Gesundheit for 1:20
If there is such a thing as an eargasm then Jack Black deflowered my ears and continues to do so everytime
Full version?
For me, this could so much have been the Super Mario Bros. movie end credits song.
I remember seeing this video in the 90’s and I don’t think I had ever been so turned on.
Hell Yeah
Pure Cinema
Meh.
Friendship so beautiful, I'm not even gonna wish it for me, I want my children to have this someday. You guys rock!
That's Kyle holy shit I haven't seen him in years, god bless you tenacious d
"To make me dream of youalallallallala" classic jack black
As I sit here staring at this guitar I inherited, contemplating the enormity of learning how to play, I think this is a song I would like to learn.
I just blew brussle sprouts out my nostrils 👃 lmfao
Taking ur cultiest satanic lover to the bitch.   Disgusting.
Amazing!
I hope I have this much joy when I’m old and fat. These guys are inspirational
They're so happy!! 😄😄😄😄 Like four year-olds having the time of their lives 😄
Was anyone else waiting for Jack to pants Kyle?
The real Bill and Ted
Goddamn!  This is proof of a higher power!
The cover to beat all covers A+
I wanna see myself in the mirror and fall in love... again.
That juxtaposition tho.
I WANT THE WHOLE SONG
I love how JB's voice has gotten more textured with age. Almost Bob Segar-esque with his vocals. Lots of emotion showing through his vocal style.
This is art!
D stands for Alfa
This reminds me of a Blue Rodeo song
POEM TO MY MATE JACK BLACK IN FRENCH**** poèm  for Jack Black  from Ameride south coast France narbonne   '' quand jai vu ces deux ours courir dans l'eau,   Je navais jamais rien vu d'aussi beau .   Et d'aussi gros .    Mais c'etait ton grand coeur sous ton bidon tout chaud   Qui glissait sur les vagues   Comme un pt'it baleineau.   ''    Love Ameride ****
angelic
💙💛 Make the full song please)
The version of this video must be so weird without music
WEN FULL SONG YOU PERFECTLY SCULPTURED MFERS
Beautiful
BEST FRIENDS FOR FANCY FROLICKING
If aliens ever invade us, this is the type of Art they should see.
The greatest friendship of all time. Women will never understand the friendship men can have. JB crushed this song. Makes me wanna pick up the guitar.
Where can i find the tabs for this !!
We need a full version pronto
wit-chu
Literally the sexiest thing this year has presented to us. Incredible song and what majestic beings
I like how they're prancing along and not looking like they're going anywhere.
Rage cage and Hollywood jack are true legends
We dont deserve them
They look the same as 20 years ago, i guess humour IS the best anti-age treatment
This is a really funny idea for them to make this video but I have to recognise that Jack Black is a great singer, Kyle is a great guitar player and the original Chris Isaac song is beautiful. Tenacious D are really funny but their music is also really really good.
immaculate vibes
There is strange beauty in this video😢
Great cover.
What diet are they on? Awesome shape
Could this be the greatest cover in the world? Or is this a tribute?
Is that a microphone or you are happy to see me?
Two men at the peak of their masculinity 💪🏼 gotta love these two gentlemen 🤙🏼
The twist: this video isn’t really in slow motion.
I want to be the third wheel
Oh hell yeah... now we need to get together over her in bama to wear thongs and bendover to setup towels and umbrellas in front of pretty girls.
Absolutely gorgeous
Just old balls Floppin all over
My heart was so unprepared for the overwhelming joy that I was moved to tears
Is that Bowsers dad?
I know it's meant to be light and it is funny as hell but Kyle is an incredible guitarist.
I just lost 2 minutes (and 2 pounds) out of my life
I'm left footed and left handed but play guitar right handed and after watching this i had a tear roll from my left eye only  whilst the right one was like the atacama   .  Btw Jack .. When you get time gimme a call Yeh  ? I  do happen to share the same name as your buddy but can't remember his name  💃👍✌🍰🍰
Magnificent!
...kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.....
BEAUTIFUL 🤘
This is what real men look like.
This is the best thing I've seen in a while. I so needed this.
That singing was sensational!
The package on KG has always been underrated
Thank you, Cage and JB, for this. i'm glad I'm alive to see this officially.
Although I find TD and Jack black amazing and funny, I will have to say that I prefer the original to this, by La Ley-Sin Ti. Honestly my favorite song of all time.  But This came close and make me chuckle for sure lol
This is just a “Tribute”
So kool
Homie looking like Santa during the off season.
Ich dachte das wäre ein Gay Bear Video. Wtf dann sehe ich Jack Black. Alter….hab ich was verpasst? Geiles Video, aber was geht ab. Jack Black is nicht gay oder? Geil wär‘s 😂
Haha nooooo. My eyes....
wow. :D tits or destiny?
I love this in so many way. They exemplify how you can age, but always stay young
the guitar is so simple but not. So amazing
we need a bowser spin off version the imagery of peach leading bowser on then gaslighting I'm and he's singing this... epic
Охуенно!
You guys are damn legends!! Never change!
Cool cover
Man this game j I g g l e physics are the best I have ever seen 🎉     *Man, I feel I'm going to heck, what a wicked thing to say 🎵 😈
anyone else noticed the MASSIVE BALLSACK of Kyle Gas on this video? Dude has 2 dragon balls right in there.
I know they had big dick energy, i just never expexted to this degree especially KG. That aint a package, my guys packing a crate.
MOAR!!!!!!!! MY GAWD MAN!
That was trippy
I know it's not just me, but is it just me or does Jack Black's voice get even better with age?
The fuck did i just watch 😂
Pure artistic gold❤❤❤❤. A true tribute of love between men and buddys.
might have to gouge my eyes out now...but the song was good.
Jack Black is peak music 🎶
Peak masculinity right here.
👀👀👀 LOL!!!
Thanks for the nice summer vibes!
I need this in 4k and 60fps
It’s not to late Jack
Content we didn't know we needed... thank you internet
У каждых друзей на отдыхе должно появиться подобное видео
I hope I am as pure as these two when I get older <3
Kurwa jak ja was kocham ziomy ;) 😊
Mind blowing ability, and pipes, with the mind of Salvador Dali, and Mike Patton, and then ........ '' wit chew.'' The fuggin ''D'' man.
JB sounds like he's always having fun and joking around while simultaneously absolutely killing it. 10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰/10
body positivity is disgusting
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One can not simply unsee that which has been saw😅😅😅😅😅
Man how are you good at everything you do. Even make a toy sacks sound good. Keep up the good work 👍👍👍👍👍
Anything you can do Kage and JB can do better. ❤❤❤
Dear Jack Black, I still would!! 😘😘❤️❤️
If you look past the fact that they’re dressed ridiculously and it’s not the most pleasant sight, you can see two people with a tremendously true friendship continuing to have the time of their lives together even as they get fat and old.
Looks like Rick Ruben
In the midst of a deep depressive state, I come upon this.. something that I never thought I needed until now. Got to see the majesticness of the D at Riot Fest in Chicago, 2015… although the stage adjacent The Prodigy was using far too many flashing lights… glad to have finally witnessed both.. ha!
Wow I’m always reminded of what great musicians these two are when I hear something like this.
Its your life. Enjoy it. ❤
Gold
Please protect these two.
❤
Joy, personified.
Suena un poder ese tema
Fuckin epic! I need a full version of this, or else... 😂
This is for Peaches, isn't it?
“I wish I could write my own song. No one likes them too. So Iiiiiiiiii……do covers. At present!”
They always leave me speechless😂❤
AI make video of 2 santas running in water
Best cover by these two legends ,l..l
damn... kyles package is 100% balls 0% dick
Gigantic😂
A bit gey. haha And now burned in my memory forever.
All about this is pure joy!
I feel like I just watched the next Budwiser advert
What the actual fuck! Haha
This made my weekend. Thank you Jack and KG
I expected kissing.
It’s about time guys!
❤️
Miss you Johny.
The song _and_ video need to be on the golden record on the next probe that leaves our solar system. It would be unfair to keep this from the universe.
Love the lecherous looks between those two
That was a challanging wank.
Holy shit what sexy beast bears god dayum. All the gay chasers swooning right now lol.
Omg this is darling. <3
There's me thinking the D had seen their day, and they kick off their new era, which is the most wholesome grandad band ever....
I feel like this is an announcement trailer
so good to release them into their habitat
Expected some rolling in the sand action... now I'm sad...
Illuminati scheduled humiliation ritual.
For the first 1 minute and 50 seconds I was figuring out if I was watching an AI generated video.
Beautiful.
That is real male beauty, right there, both graceful and majestic....
Kyle has some serious strength in those arms, shoulders and pectorals. Beer gut aside that man is built like a pack horse.
Why's it only 1.50 long ?
30 year old song sounds better than anything out there today
Jack Black is America's oldest kid
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
#relationshipgoals
Some major big Jack energy coming from this song
Two whales two gigachads
Ah, the unachievable male ideal
This is beautiful in every way
Einfach nur schön.
Had to cover half the screen 🤦‍♂
Is the full song on its way ?
fucking legends man! made the greatest song in the woorld!
This was not necessary...at all.
At some points in this video, they are running but barely moving. Obviously fake
This is amazing but where is the rest if the song. I wanna hear the rest.
I never thought I would enjoy watching two old men play at the beach together.
Still waiting for the full version! Tremendous.
That “nobody loves no one” line goes so hard 😭😭
I didn’t know I needed to hear this song or see this video but I’m so glad I did
"Friends will be friends they're running naked in the sand.   Friends will be friends hold the candle, someday surely form a band."  They sure did. Well done fellers, never stop being you and raising smiles round the world.
Piece of art.
Как это теперь развидеть?☹️
Super cute!
Race for the heart attack?
The song has so much more impact with those visuals... banger
That last pan out had me worried, then I was relieved it didn't keep going over to his bulge.
Art.
:)
Santa and Hagrid decided to go on holiday together. They deserve a break too, you know!
Majestic.
god i really hope they release a full version! i NEED it in my life
One of the my favorite songs of all time. I always love listening to all the different covers from it, really good Jack and Kyle!
I showed my mom this cover, and she stares. Said she really likes Jack while watching this video 😐
this is healing my chronic depression and anxiety. life-affirming
National Treasures, these two!
I can't help but stare ❤
My friend heard what I listened to and she asked me why this guy sounds ridiculous and amazing at the same time XD
Why can I only upvote this one time?
They both probably rockin horse cocks.. juet sayin..
Santa Clause & Fat Tarzan! 😂
the last line "nobody loves no one" if u think about it actually means everyone loves someone. Deep.
Beautiful cover version but why the clip from Chariots of Fire?
Majestic beasts in their natural habitat. Brings a tear to the eye.
Hard part to be gay and attracted by fat people is this two.
too short, but enough to make me cry
Jack's voice in this cover is absolutely on point.
That was cute. Good song. Good video.
This is simultaneously beautiful and hilarious ❤😂
I had NO idea I wanted this until now.
😅😅😅😅
I love this
AND THE D WILL RISE AGAIN!!!
These are some magestic man-boobs 😜
It's like Santa is on holiday with Juan, his latin lover. Beautiful, you guys!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
AMAZING cover of one of my favorite songs, and a wonderfully ridiculous video 🤣
I don't care if Jack is messing around. I am higher than life listening to this version!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I don't care if Jack is messing around. I am higher than life listening to this version!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Perfect.
Jack Black = THE GOAT !
Pls pls pls do Overkill by Men at work next 👉👈🥺  Bonus points if it's a metal version 😭
EPIC!!!!
Wholesome asf
11/10
Jack can legitimately sing, no doubt
Fire!!! ))) \~/
Godamn beautiful. Made me tear up. The song was good too
Great music Video😅
me in 30 years
10/10
This wasn't the full song it was just a tribute
video: funny and childish song: serios AF, highest quality of singing and playing ever
That was beautifully sung.
Вот это голосище!
I smiled the whole time
The return of the two kings!!👑👑
Why is this so short? 😭 Btw the music sucked.
Pay attention, Ladies: This is what peak male physical conditioning looks like.
Beautiful 🤩
You’ve just watched two old ass goofy goobers running naked on the beach in slow motion for two minutes admit it
Shit. This is really good.
No shame in their game. You gotta respect that.
😂funny vid from some greats
Love your voice JB ❤  Please do a cover album!  You &Kyle could let the fans pick from a list!!!!!!
There's no way Tenacious D can keep pumping out banger after banger, even after an eternity! The band we need, but dont deserve
Pure masterpiece
I never realised I gave my son the gift of tenacious D and you in turn have been the inspiration for his success in too many instruments songwriting and death metal! ❤❤❤
This world is only gonna break your heart
Pure masterpiece
God bless youtube for videos like this 🙏🙏🙏
Oh wow
I just love Jack Blacks voice!  So crisp and perfectly in tune.  It always gives me shivers.  Amazing!
It would have been funnier if Jack Black and Kyle Gass recreated the movements of Chris Isaak & the hot model
по ходу где-то в Мелекино снимали
:-) & :-)
legend!!!!!
YESSSSS😢
I will now require therapy..
So simle and so funny👏👍👍👍
The cover is amazing and the video is exactly what I thought it would be. 😁
I love how beautiful this cover actually is. BUT  WE DESERVE THE FULL VERSION
You guys are amazing!!!!
God damn they're packin
Look at these majestic stallions, striding along the ocean waters. It’s art, it’s magic, it’s fierce ❤
Ok it's official I can no longer hear Jack Black singing. It's Bowser
What a wicked thaaaang to deeeeew. No hiiiiiii dun wanna fall in lerve, witch you.
Such a beautiful video i`m so grateful i witnessed it!  I love Tenacious D
Loved every second
thanks!
When first saw this I thought, great they're forcing gay pride month on me with a couple of bears frolicking in the surf, and then realized who it was. 🤣
And Iieeeeee wanna faaall in looooove~  And Iieeeeeeee am glad I fell in love....   With these twoooo....
Wow
we NEED a longer version
Ha!
Lingua ignota might out sing you, but seeing two grown men frolic on the beach was worth listening to this.
Can we get a full version?
What is in the rage cage’s shorts?! Looks like he’s got a wee bebe in there
With everything that's wrong with this world, we're so lucky that we still get Tenacious D songs/video to take away the pain for 3 minutes. Close your eyes, and you're listening to an iconic version of an already amazing song. Open and try not the smile. Thank you guys
Now this is what I want shown at my funeral!
Tenacious D for president.
I'm disturbed by the monstrosity that KG has 🤣🤣🤣 tenacious d finally makes sense lol
The D-naissance is here!
I can’t believe there is still people who think jack black said the n-word 😂
😆🥰
Masterpiece! Perfect!
Kyle packing the heater! 😂
I remember you supporting Joe Biden for president with your time warp song lol.... Nice to see the USA is now burning ey??
New Song....."Bulges"
That's real Heavy Metal 🤟🏻
hermoso cover hermosos ustedes  los amo <3
10-hour version, please.
Too short. (Not talking about Kyle's underwear - those are perfect).
Great to see Rick Ross still making music
Ethereal.😂
WHERE'S THE REST OF IT? I NEED MOOORE! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!
I didn't expect this to be THIS kind of masterpiece.
Now this is what I fucking call ART
You should do Entheogens🍄◽️✨️🍁 They will change ur life, we're all the same consciousness creating reality through the mind🧠👁 our souls are all connected we're all God having a human experience ☯️
This is how you commit!
10/10
TENAC!!!!!! <3 So much love!
YES!!! I’ve been waiting for the studio version. You guys absolutely rocked it live.
I could see them deciding to film this spontaneously and their outfits were actually just what they had on under their clothes.
How amazing is this? wow
Kyle is so gassed by the end of this clip.
🤟😆
Please come to brazil
who else is hard?
I love Stone Sour but this cover was something else. And the video... lmao
Those smiles.
I don't know if I'll be able to handle myself with this video when Kyle or Jack meet their maker.
What a man <3
What’d I’d give to be Eiffel Towered by these two. 😍🤤
Still a better love story than Twilight.
I was nor ready for the sheer volume of junk Kyle has in his shorts....
He would be great if he wasn't a DEMOCRAT and didn't follow all his buddies in HOLLYWOOD
Giving the gay community what we really want... cock and balls
Jack: Were you recording that, Sam? Jack's son: Uhh yea...? Jack: That's the music video now.
Yes!
This makes me miss the 70s eventhough I was born much later...
Maaaaan this cover need to be like....3 times longer
I grew up on P.O.D and its music so this makes me very happy to see. I wish they spoke more fondly of P.O.D.
This is funny?
Stunning and brave.
Too late! I think they have already fallen in love…
Whenever your local veteran indie wrestling tag team hits the beach.
I'm just glad Kyle's tighty whiteys didn't get too wet
I don't know hopefully one day I just run across you so I can say hello you're amazing I love you dude no homo
That's life❤
As goofy as you can be you still have a good voice bro I'm surprised when you retired or stop making movies you didn't jump to music technically I always thought that's where you were going to go
tidy whities are such a bad/weird choice...
you guys are kick ass!
You thought that those were regular old tighty whities...  Oh you were so wrong.
STILL TOO SHORT!!! MORE!!! WE WANT MORE!!!!
Omg we need a longer version!
Lose the weight guys!
If I had one “critique” for this video, I’d say that the choice to shoot in slow-motion probably wasn’t necessary with these two… they’re already _really_ slow 😂😂😂
God, you had a great voice
I didnt realize i needed this in my life
I love that Jack Black is still  basically the same as he was when I was 12 (now 33).
We ever going to see a tarnishes D 2  aka the bong of destiny lol 😂
happy pride
😂👍
They're running but they look like they aren't moving
<3 so good!
"So Jack, with all that Nintendo money, what's the first thing you're gonna buy?"
It breaks my heart that this so short
Gold
Less is more. Except when more is more.
I like how this video is the continuation of another of their MV from over a year ago, watch?v=N0hFf-twPlY
Sexier than the original
I don't know how i got here, i was dead asleep and my phone was on YouTube when the i hear this music playing in my head, a open my eyes to see what was going on when i realized i was trapped in this nightmare where Jack black was running through waves in his speedo's. I have yet been able to wake from this horrific event.
Tenacious D.... SUBSCRIBED!!!!
I saw the thumbnail and I already knew this was a great cover
😆🤣👏👍👍
Taylor Stephens' magnum opus
S tier video and song.
Best Bud Light commercial ever. This will save the brand.
This is why we have the internet
Not only did I love the visuals on this more than the original video, I much prefer the vocals, as well.
Didn’t expect this cover, legendary
Ахеренно
Why nobody is talking about KG's MASSIVE package ???
Where is the next trip going? Coz boy, that daddy is packing!!!😅😂❤😮😊😅😂😂😂
at first they look like are not moving
Best. Music. Video. Ever.
finally a video for this...I've been sittin here waiting...you f**ker..you f**kin bi*ch
And here I thought the original video was sexy
So much bouncing!!
So this is what Santa and his little helper doing during summer. Made my day, thanks boyz.
The most american thing I've seen after Sharknado
clicked on this hoping to hear chris isaac. was not disappointed.
Jack 'n' Kyle jus lovin' life!
Kyle has a nice bulge and I'm not talkin about his wallet 🍕🍕
Never go to the beach, packing
Wait… is this a “coming out” video because of Pride June?
I cant imagine life without tenacious D
Yeah only Jack Black can pull off making a music video that has almost nothing to do with the song lol
gayge
Mens doing Mens things for the Womens and Mens who enjoy these Mens doing Mens things.
I feel like this was more tenacious d than I was prepared for.
I am so fucking in love with these men. They saw their wicked game cover blowing up and made this masterpiece of a video.
I think the video doesn't have slow motion at certain point, i swear
Thanks for being Awesome! Love it!
Absolute international treasures these two
Gross 😂
2 absolute fucking legends
So these guys have massive dicks.
Kamal Harris is taking the video
I cried at the end when the whales beached themselves.
I never expected to watch a half naked Jack Black and Kyle Gas play around in the ocean for almost 2 minutes... My life is complete.
傑克 你是我看過最抬頭挺胸的胖子  唱的真好
Ok that’s great cool yey 🙄
art
Dirty D
Now if they cover bad bad thing, I don’t have to listen to Chris anymore. 😊✌🏻
2 weeks ago me and my daughter did the same in the ocean,  so much fun, I felt like the world was free of problems, for a good 30 minutes.
Great song 🔥
where is greenpeace when we need them?? 🥺
Is that his dad?
They running so fast but yet so slow. Magic..
Fuck yeah!!
hahah YES! LOVE IT!
This cover is an improvement on the original
Love it!!!😂
At first it was funny that Black could sing well...now im like damn this shit is good!
too good
Just two boys having fun.
Kyle Gas looks like a magical Santa Clause 🎅
Kyle Gas loo
This is what peak masculinity looks like
This is not the best song in the world,this is just a tribute.
They're living their best lives and I love it
Only thing wrong is it’s not long enough!
That's a lot of skin
Faith has been restored
Is it me  or does KG look like he is in bit better shape than usual ?
Tenacious DEEZ NUTS
I got up from the sofa. I went to the window. I thought a lot. I cried...
Just creepy ...  Had to watch it thru tho.. like i was hypnotized..  😮
Magnificent creatures are D's
Now it's official. Everyone has covered this song.
Jack Issak
I always think to myself jack black could be such a great musician if he wanted. But all his songs cut off in a minute or so and most the albums are just talk
yes, yes, and yes! beautiful ❤❤
First off.  Absolutely BRILLIANT! Give us more of TENACIOUS D! 😂❤
I never thought I'd see the day that I would see two slightly over weight but very talented guys running through the surf
When we make first contact with extra terrestrials we need to send Jack Black and Kyle Gass to meet them. It would be impossible for them to attack.
see you at Graspop soon :)
Tenacious D for life!u Guys r just something else,i love u!
Chris Isaak copied this for his video
Happy pride!
fucking legends
The song is awesome but the video is just painful to watch😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Really looked like a dream caught on video with how they were almost running in place
Wicked games are child's play when you posses the pick of destiny.
yussss
Looking awesome as always. Love you guys!!!
This needs 10h vid.
Jeus, this is amazing.. thank you for this video, music and visuals on point!!
my eyes experience pain but my ears are filled with pleasure
Goddammit 😂😂😂
This might be my favourite music video ever
Love the awareness that we were all clamoring for a longer version of this. You guys are the best!
I hope you realize Chris Issac originally did this.......they didn't write it.
Just beautiful. The song, and those hot men on the beach.
This is awesome! Greatings from Ukraine!
The happiness in Jack's soul at the end. 😂❤
Hypnotic…
His kids decided to be there, but they were sitting on the opposite end of the beach ' I don't know him '
The only person who is my favorite actor and musician both.
The 🐐s..
Absolute GOATED.
I need a Full version of this
❤❤❤
I saw them 2 days ago in Germany, it was amazing and they performed this song. And now seeing this beautiful masterpiece... just amazing ❤
Kyle Gas and Jack Black making music is still he Greatest thing to happen on Earth!
The Best!
Amazing....just...amazing
i think i love jack black
What did I just watch?...
Pfff... with the pick of destiny i can do this too!
Mesmerizing...
This is so good! Please there needs to be a full version 😭
❤😂SON LOS MEJORES!. ES UNA DE MIS CANCIONES FAVORITAS!  LOS ADORO REALMENTE Y TE AMO JACK!!!🖤🥰
Those tighty-whities on kg sell it
Killer Whales.
...Fall in love wichoo!
Please make Pick of Destiny 2!!!
Thanks for the memories TD
This! This is art!
I thought this was years and years old..
Cage lost weight, jack didnt
Two Besties just out for a little ocean romp...brings a tear to my eye.  You be you UBU!
amazing moonwalking guys, it looks so much like running i almost couldnt tell
Song length possibly controlled by jogging stamina
nice cardio
Ребята, вы огонь 😅🎉❤
Two walruses playing on the sand how cute
I thought I was going to cringe, but they instead, liked the idea of running like childs at the beach and smiled the whole video!!!! ❤❤
Jajajajajajaj😂
very fun
Ville Vallo's version is unfollowable, but this is a nice attempt, if a pale shadow.
Sexy as F!😍
Fine specimens of men
and the jellyfish swam away......
Magical 🤌
Jack’s outfit tho 😂
Hahaha nice! The original is G Eazy if anyone's curious.
Ok Jack, I forgive you for being in the worst episode of The Mandalorian ever made. You made it back bud.
Those are some sexy all natural men....congrats to bringing reality back and what a lovely song
Pure erotic and romantic
I just am thankful they didn't start rolling around together and kissing 😂
The very definition of sexy. The D in their prime. Marvellous. Shaped. Hydrated. An example to us all. I watch in awe and silent appreciation. I see sense and direction in my life. Jables and Kage are here for me, for us all. They bring joy, happiness and serenity. I am at peace.
Why no bathing suit tho?
My dog meets up with buddy!
This sparks such joy.  Thank you.
It hard to listen with all that hog meat swingin!
I would never have thought, but these two guys are more fun to watch than the topless beauty Helena Christensen in the original clip.
Now that right there is peak male performance.
W.P. brother bring the ICBM'S
The song does not make any sense anymore without this footage from now on
genius
Love this song now  done by tenacious d , Jack Black has the best voice . Love tenacious d , always make me laugh
With KG's fingers and JB's voice, I just wish they'd like ... hire a writer or something to make some real music lol
JB morphing into ernest hemingway
The Greatest Cinematic Masterpiece Ever ...Coupled with a superb soundtrack. Thank You.
god i wish he'd have an actual wrestling run
Much better than Rocky 3 🤣
Looks like Santa's bringing me lots of goodies.  Thank you, KG <3
Am I gay?
The music and video as a combo is somehow incredibly wholesome.
only 2 minutes?! you're killing me, smalls!
priceless ❤
Mesmerizing!
Simple joys of life, just a wholesome fun day for these lads
Jack Black in Mars Attacks! was skinny.
oh I love this song and you guys so much, this is just perfect ❤
Wow, this is F'n revolting
Watch that Myocarditis doesn't get the pair of you....
This slaps harder than my Step-dad!
hahaha  love.-
That was a very short song but cool!
Blinded for life
Didn't know such a beautiful video could even exist.
Don't get turned on don't get turned on don't get turned on don't get turned on.. get turned on  GODDAMN IT KAGE, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU MY SEX SLAVE, YOU'RE GONNA GARGLE MAYONNAISE
u make me wanna karaoke
I thought this was that iconic scene from “Rocky |||”!
Peak performance. on both counts.
When I closed my eyes and listen to this song, I can see Bowser singing 😭
You are BREATHTAKING! It was EPIC >:3
I'm going to the beach righ now. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gods amongst men
Banger
BOARD GAMES ?
I Love You Both, and You All.
❤
This is one of the best things I have ever seen on YouTube. Top 5 videos.  No question. It’s like a 1 minute 50 seconds antidote to all the stupidity and unpleasantness on the internet.
This is one way how you know Chris Isaak was the Bomb back then.
Lol crazy cover
kyles junk is huge!
Awsome just awsome
beautifully meshuga
Funny haha but respect Jack blacks vocals
Great to see Andrew Weil doing so well at age 80
This Song have only One defect... It's too short
Is this 2004 I’m listening to new songs by Tenacious D
Gold every time
If that's not living the best life Idk what is
That's all ??
This gave me chills.
❤
😂❤
Love it!!!
bahaha  so good
We wish there was a full version
Santa & 1800’s Strongman meets Baywatch
Best cover ever but not the full song. That’s the ultimate sin
Beautiful
That voice matured like cheese
Man. You know how he is an amazing artist. He has 1 m followers. And this video has more than 2 m views in 2 days.
you had me hooked from frame 1
Non so che droghe abbiano preso, può anche darsi nessuna, in ogni caso le voglio pure iooooooo
Tonight in Prague!
Goosebumps!!
Glorious

Amazing, I’d love a full version
That was exactly what I expected before clicking on it, beautiful music, hilarious video. A really unique way to share some good feelings, thanks
Video is true art
Is this bromance??...
Tenacious D...you guys are legends!
Yup! There’s that PERFECT PITCH…
Haha lol 😘😘
amazing voice and guitar skills 🥹
I Can't put in words how proud I am of my lords, my shiny golden gods, the two kings! They've blazed across the rock universe blessing us all! I've been a worshipper since the pick of Destiny and y'all have NEVER lost that touch, that groove, that ELECTRIC DYNAMITE!! It's been hit after hit In my book. Love you guys and your music, keep on rocking and Never stop!
this is not the most covered song of all time - it’s just a tribute
They be livin their best lives ❤
I literally couldnt look away. I was transfixed. When it ended I laughed out loud. Joyous experience. Frission to the max.
this might be the best music video of all time!
This is actually making me want to grow old
The passion is so powerful
At least they do some cardio. 😂 Love them!! ❤
thats so amazing but why so short ?
Bowser animation/animatic when?
water must have been really cold
Are they Gay ???
just what i needed
This looks like a Bud light commercial.
Dude, Jack Black outsings all of the covers of this songs as a joke!
I want a full cover!  Please take my money!  Name your Price!
It's so wrong,  it's right.
This song moved me to tears
it's beautiful.
Still a better love story than Twilight
日本から愛を込めて
Lol.... Awesome
Sei un fottuto sognatore....... 😂
while my guitar it gently weeps
Never lose your inner child! but might be beneficial to get some distance from depression relief eating.
Extended Version - Pleaaaase !!!
Hahahaha
This kinda takes the expression "I love the D" to a whole new level.
💔 this made me so sad, stirred up so many memories
Caput Laboris
Omg 😂
Okay maybe I have a type 🫣
I suppose it is meant to be funny, but I found it quite endearing. Just two fat people enjoying the simple pleasures of life.
That was beautiful... thanks boys
Reminds me of Apollo and Rocky training in 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Love you guys
I love him for this. More than I already did. One of my lifelong favourite soul-rending pieces of music, done partial justice by a pair of* souls I value in this world.  Do the whole song, D*!
Wtf is this
This video made my day😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
When he's not being a willy jacks got a really nice voice
I want a reshoot of friends with this version
✨🤘🏼❤🤘🏼✨
Once had a love, and He was a Gas. Soon turned out, He was also Jack Black. Seemed like the real thing only to find, tee-hee, hee-hee, for all mankind. GO, D! With your Tenaciousness! What a Wicked Game, making us fall in love with an entity that is actually 2 energies come together as one BEING of He He He He. 😊
This has to be the quickest clip ever shot, the most unrelated. Yet one of the best stunt ever
And this is what we call happiness :)
What color is the Ocean 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wicked thing d’duuuuu ❤
If I saw you two out in the wild on the beach, it would be like seeing two unicorns.
If there was one thing I could show to our ancient ancestors, it'd be this.
now make it slowed and reverb
I’d like them to go on a diet, so they live longer. The world is more fun with them.
Guys, you should play in "The last of us"
This is fucking great!!
thanks for reminding me I haven't subscribed.... your channel is fire XD
essa melodia transforma qualquer coisa em uma bela sei la oq
Life,  Live it!
AMAZING, I AM SOOOOOO HAPPY that the D is making music again
I see two almost naked men and I have tears in my eyes... What's going on here? 🥲 I hope you two continue to make music together for a long time. 🤘❤
If I end up like that, please shoot me.
Surement la plus belle vidéos du Youtube Game 🐎🐎🤩
SEE YOU IN ROTTERDAM, I WAIT FOR THE D ❤
That's exactly what I picture in my mind when I think about falling in love: two old semi-nude fat guys frolicking at the beach, cheers 🏖
yes.
This is god damn beautiful.🤣
Preparation H, allows you to wear white knickers to the beach again.
I see this was devised entirely to arouse me
Best friends 💚 🤘
I wanted to hate this but I couldn't.  You're still idiots
Magnificent specimens!
I love how such a deep song can be so funny LOL
Googled 'Zen' and it correctly redirected me here.
holy shit..this is deeper than kyle's belly button
Guys I am genuinely begging you for a full length cover of this song, it is far too good to only last 2 minutes 💜
Wish it was full song
Would love to hear a full cover of this from you guys.. Your voice is amazing for this song.
Your voice rocks 🤘🏻
Not what I expected to see with this song but hey here we are!
If you close your eyes you can almost see Kung Fu Panda doing karaoke..
I think this is the greatest and best song in the world
No idea what I just watched but this is hilarious 😍
❤
Magnificent creatures
Nothing against this video but i think it was funny that a bud light add played before this video 😂
This is Cinema.
At a certain point they're just some of the great american songwriters of all time right? Like hahah school of rock but this made me cry
Am I the only that is royally pissed that they didn't cover the whole song!?!?!?!
Tenac are the purest 🤘🏻
friends will be friends running naked in the sand
I was just getting into that and the song ended!
The sexiest video clip of a decade
I first learned of Jables from School of Rock. He had only ever surpassed himself since then. Keep on keeping on
santa on the runn😂😂😂
It's beautiful
@Tenacious D I've watched you growing up and you are my idols would you help a father out by getting me into the acting industry I am extremely musically inclined as well as technologically inclined. Much love a forever fan. P.S. My mother was a cover model in her early years which she gave up to raise me.
That was amazing!
It feels like my doctor can hang herself. I am proud of my chips boobs.
I miss Jack Blacks voice, easily one of the best in the biz
Kg got that thang on him
Please do the full song, great cover
Jack Black have mad acting chops. I mean, that's a fact. And he's one of the funniest man alive.  But, his voice... his voice is more than just the best singer alive. I feel like in the future, people will think of him primarily as a singer. That voice is beyond surreal. Take my money - I wanna to hear the whole song!!!
Ded Metal
Deux Super gamins Très potes ✨
❤
Gotta love JB n' KG
Ahhhhh, yet another super sexy Sports Illustrated shoot.
The played to eye of the tiger better.
Hahahha😂😂😂
Like two children 😂
Amazing how fat Americans can get.
Kage’s tighty whities are *right on the edge* of going full “wet t-shirt contest” lol
I love you guys ❤ you are amazing!
I genuinely cant wait to see them live in a few days!
this Man tho, always makes you smile, no matter how down you are..  Based
Guys!!!! Are you trying to kill us, only giving us a sample?!? We need the whole song!!! 😝
the title drop looks like a fucking A24 movie
God i love these two.
Those guys are just amazing!
damn, just tears left.
Now i will never watch the original the same way...
Every man dreams of such a summer
I'm having breakfast, so I can't go through with it right now, but I'll be back when I can enjoy the funny.
jack black es de los mejores actores y comicos que he visto en mi vida
Are all the songs on this album gonna be less than 2 mins when they should be full length? Like ‘Video Games’ ??
love you guys
i wish it a bit longer
That’s the JB voice I never thought I’d hear again, fucken legends, better than the original 🫡
Looks like there is a Tenacious D swinging around in Kyle's tighty whities
better than the original. change my mind.
Meaty meat
We see a majestic Jables frolicking in his natural environment
Now I'm sad you didn't perform at Rock am Ring in these outfits. But your performance rocked!
This had the power...to move me!
Disgusting and pathetic excuse for men
I wish I could sing like jack.
Just beautiful!
This is so wholesome
I edged to this
Peak male physique!
Please make more Music JACKY BOY
Okay.
Шикарно!
This is what life is all about. Having fun with your best friend for life. ❤💯
That's an amazing cover, please cover the whole song
Goosebumps...
Not true. I love you Jack
It’s been up for 2 days. I have watched it 5 times.
'OLY SHIP!!!!! YOu guys are legends
This is exactly what Game of Thrones needed for the ending. Would have been a way better.
Everything you both deserve is love
Why was that sooooo good??
Absolutely slayyyeeedddd it and needed this so much, thank you very much for blessing us Jack yeeeee!!!
man... I miss the ocean
This is porn for me😍🥰🥰🥰
This is art
For a second, I thought this was one of those weird videos created by AI. 😆
Any place I can get the explicit version?
Это прекрасно. Я смотрю на это уже шесть часов.
Never imagined watching 2 middle-aged man play at the beach could be a very enetrtaining MV lol
Just FANTASTIC!!
This was amazing. Am i surprised? No. Y'all have been blowing my mind since '02. Luckily i found a burned CD with wonder boy and tribute on it in one of my junior high classes. Oh how time flies. Keep it up guys!
They are a brutal legend
Lol. I love you guys.
My wife got pregnant on the night of yalls concert...
This was both hauntingly beautiful and beautifully haunting. Genuine chills TD4lyfe
I despise this song but for some reason when Jack sings it I love it so much
Pure beauty.
I can’t stop watching this ❤
I love you guys
pov of having money
Please make the cover of the whole song!!!! 🤘🤘🤘
Thank you guys, for putting smiles on our faces. 🥰
Please dear god, let those bathing suits hold! Hold! If you have any mercy at all! Nobody asked for this (crying in the corner "I just want to go home now...").
Disney: 😐
Tenacious D and Weird Al rock and roll forever
Two Dionysuses... Dionysusii?
That’s beautiful man
now I know why they're called Tenacious D
Что за ужас?!😢
What the hell am i looking at
We needed this... Thanks
What ever the D is doing, I’m here for it.
Doing half a cover this beautifully is a wicked thing to do.
These two idiots I love them so much it's not even funny, long live the D
God's among men
That would be awesome also by drdisrespect singing it
This is very hypnotic like a christmas tree lights
isso aqui é ouro puro
Do the full song ❤
10 seconds in I knew it was just gonna be one continuous shot.
I better stay seated for a few minutes after watching this one 👀
Make jack blacks music career finally happen!! Outside of an endearing joke
Long live the D
i did a video for this first, making me the trendsetter. here's the re-upload, because youtube cancelled me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugpzfbnEMHo
Super Mario messed me up now all I can think is Bowser singing this. 😅😂
Legendary.
The 2 most wholesome dudes known to man. Just….. just absolutely precious these guys are.
Jack’s inner child never left ☺️
My life has new meaning!!!
So much bouncing dong 😂😂😂😂
Need the entire song!!!
Looks like what they shot after the end of this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0hFf-twPlY
Santa got something huge hiding there.
damn do a full cover please !!!
look at them just being alive an happy it's gorgeous lol
Best run on the beach since Rocky III
I love youse guys
this is deep af.
Era o comentário brasileiro que você procurava, essas lendas fizeram minha adolescência melhor.
Not fatter and gayer. Just older and better.
ONLY .....JB and KG can run almost naked in real time on a beach  for 15 seconds in there 50s and put out a cover that gets 2.2 million views in 2 days .....epic
Tribute
THIS. SHIT. HITS. SO. HARD.
It sucks but it's better than that terrible "Peaches" song....so that's something.
This took balls. 😂
Flawless 🥲❤❤
Chris Isaak is rolling over in his grave....and he wasn't dead until this came out! :D
We need another Tenacious D movie
I am enchanted by these creatures who frolic as one bellows a wicked melody
Jack was sounding a little bit like Puddles Pitty Party there at the beginning. … I wonder if they ever sang this together.  That would be AMAZING!!
epic
The best song in the world!
Ok YouTube shoe me bros being bros while playing bro music that I love.
Reflection of Trump and Kim's love https://youtu.be/fYp3bGjADek
I wonder how many bears are enjoying this video unironically? 🤔🐻😉
I just want them to live their best lives. <3
See, it’s funny because they’re morbidly obese and frolicking in the water in slo-mo while they sing an old “sexy” song. Damn, it’s so funny. How do they do it?
so much better than Lizzo.
Today I learned that Tenacious D have like, infinitely more body confidence than I do.
So good..the entire Song, please.👍
Move over, Sleep Token.
The song is a bit too short. Too good for less than 2 minutes.
Is that Swim suit made of Water Buffalo stomach...?
How can a man embody the bear lifestyle so fully while remaining so pure and sexless. Kyle gas is less a man and more a gift to a restless humanity seeking the guiding arms of a loving papa.
Omg amazing
#summerbod #yum LoL
This is sooo good!!
What I like about TD is how they write songs. They don't drag the song or shorten the song to fit a radio format. They write songs as they must be heard
I guess this was that 5.4 quake I felt in San Diego last week
This is Bear Porn!!
Can't help but see Bowser singing this for Princess Peach.
Majestic.  Sublime.  Perfect.
I'm crying. Thank you. We needed this. ❤
The true frat boys are these two
Is this ITYSL?
What beach?
Can we appreciate how Jables took the wave for a very clearly young Cage?
lol'd. Jack Black powerful vocal, tho.
Jack is ABSOLUTELY chubbed up :) He also looks like my pastor from my hometown LMAO
best ever
Bowser crushing it this year.
You're doin' the lord's work and you always were.  Watching you guys from all the way back in the HBO days until today has made me laugh the whole way.  Fuckin' love you guys.
Love the Twunk Trunks!!
I have wild dream: jack black - adam sandler
Peaches! Peaches! peaches!
I was lucky enough to see them on The Slicy Meatball  Tour. I've been to dozens of shows, but never had I been to a show that made me as happy as The Fucking D did. Screaming lyrics about dicks and farts was therapeutic beyond any explanation I could conjure. KG's guitar licks make panties drop and Jack's high notes cause unstoppable rock hard boners.
out of words
Sure, Jack’s voice is great and Kyle’s playing is *chef’s kiss* but is this the best song in the world?  No, this is just a cover…
They can do no wrong,period.
Bruh, even dogs would look at their energy and go 'naaahhhh
I love you spiderman!
Jack Black is actually singing about his love for peaches in this song.  If you don't know what I'm talking about...well you'll know someday.  You'll know someday.
My man Kyle G is packin some schmeat
This is actually really good 💜👌
Jack black is an American icon. Love how much he loves his craft.
This is somebody's kink  it's me  i'm somebody  finally
Those are my parents UuU
I appreciate that these penis having homosapiens with the potential to be sperm providers did not have engorged phalli nor provide examples of their potential to provide sperm.
Chills
To short! I want to hear the entire cover now!
We 100% need the whole song version, i beg i beeeeeggg
i have just one dream that is to meet jb and kg
That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve heard in a long time. Thanks
KG be packin son
This song has always haunted me in the most magical way. I needed this cover😌
Guys , the song/scenery...sums it up...old friends, youthful rebirth.. water life is eternal...🔥👍 😂
😂😂😂😂😂 MEGA !
So 2 Obese Fat men get more views than Actually Healthy people what has the world come too praising people for being fat and dying at the age of 50 Pathetic
Thought this was gonna be an AI cover of the The Weeknd song...
Thought you were going to chest bump jump in a wave XD
Human kind needs a full version of this song ASAP.
Two magnificent beasts playing on the beach. I did not know I need this, but I need this. A wonderful cover of the song. So heartfelt vocals, the guitar perfect. 👌
Fortunately they got it in one take cos after 2 minutes of nonstop jogging, they were exhausted.
Biggest bro-mance in history!!!
WOW this video rules
My Favorite Koopa. JB is the big one
Magnificent bastards
TENACIOUS D FOR LIFE
This song has been very popular to cover lately.. does anyone know why?
Who would have thaught kg hung that much dongage
😂😂😂😂
Friggin legends! love these guys :)
Maravilloso
Might have been a Chris Isaak cover but had some major Chris Cornell vibes.
I know cuz he's silly, this might sound silly, but I think he has one of the great voices ever. Not even kidding.
If my moobs bounced like that, I'd never leave the house.
Wooo!
Oh the difference 🤣.  If this had been two middle age chunky girls like myself ….it would be gross! Omg disgusting! They have no shame!  Yeah Everyone crapping on LIZZO    MISOGYNY AT ITS FINEST AND HYPOCRISY 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️‼️.   cause it is 2 fat middle age dudes with their junk hanging out BEING Ridiculous
Somehow this made the human race inherently better.
Gave me thats what i want to do after i retire type of feelin.
Masterpiece.
Incredible
OMG! I ACTUALLY F*CKIN LOVE THIS!!!! 🤘💀🤘
Stone Sour has competition for the best cover of this song.....  Rock on you Y trunks old men
the video was short because they ran out of stamina :D
No body loves no one? No sir, I love you... I love Kyle too...
He really went full Wolfgang there.
What even was this video though!?! 🍆? 🥒?
Wichoo
How not to love them? They are magical creatures
ooh la la
I just watched two meatballs run for 1:50 minutes
damn we are so back
Jack can sing tho haha what a legand
Get goose bumps everytime I hear this. Please do the entire song. Its amazing
You Majestic unicorns🦄 you.
KG is so tan 😂
that is a nice beautiful beach
I'd argue that Arcade Fire is about as good as the D at this point
Jack Black Meatloaf Bio just a thought.....
Man, I this takes me back. I got into Tenacious D when I was 12 or 13, first song I heard was paying guitar hero at the arcade and just loved the hell out of The Metal. I’d go every chance I could to play that song.🤘🏽
I bet they don’t do that every day…run
Bora fazer uma dieta Jack kkkkkk amo você meu querido 💓
I think I'm not straight anymore
this cover makes me ascend i love it so much
Sounds like Bowser's still not over Peach.
*HIM* Did a much better cover...
I wish for once I could just take JB seriously. But he makes it impossible even with a voice of pure gold.
I never thought two burly guys running on the beach just in their undies could look so gracious in slow mode lol
damn SWEET
Fat shaming...I'm triggered!
You, Kyle Gass is packing some serious Tenacious D.
Yeah this is funny as hell but I wish they would take better care of themselves because they need to live long healthy lives. We need them around as long as possible.😊
Thanks for putting a smile on my face once again Tenacious D
Perfect cover!
CARALHO MUITO BOM KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK SIMPLESMENTE FENOMENAL!!!!!!!
Perfectly innocent and majestic. Jack Black is a national treasure
so majestic. the peace… the grace….
Just a regular day at the beach for The D
smash that like if Santa gives you a hard-on!
Can we please get the full song?!?!😢
good lord i hope they release a full length version of this
Dishpans hilarious. Thank you for normalizing ugliness.
Love these guys!!!
Fucking genius
They'rrrrreee  Baaaack!
Extended edition!!!
It equal parts funny and awesome at the same time
So beautiful!
livin their best lives.
Awesome cover
Love it!!
Give us a full version, this is so good
This is one of the best things that has ever blessed my ears, I'm not sure I will be able to sleep until there's a full version
top tier video for background
Dude, I wish Kyle and Jack were my dads :(
Gold
Man, yall can really "Take My Breath Away!!!!"
Chris issac would be proud
Kyle has quite a Hog on him it would seem
What a classic...
Thank you, I sang along the whole way!
The character arcs are pretty amazing: they go from dry guys on the beach to wet guys in the water. Yet when they get back to the sand again they are still wet and not dry like before.
o..ok!
This is peak music
This has made my day
CTM .. la wea ..... 🤣🤣🤣
That was ridiculously awesome!
This is the best video ever, everybody can stop making videos, it's over.
latest Hugo Boss commercial. Amazonian The smell of a real man
Dude JB just broke that wave before it hit his best pal
What a Nice photography!!! 😂😂😂
I'll never 'hear' this song the same ever again.
Some say it was the music that slowed time in this clip
Why does this only last 1:50 minutes?
What has been seen cannot be unseen
Those tighty whiteys are holding on for dear life
Beautiful 😍
Will always love you two!! Pure comedy gold!!
god damn that was pretty as fk
these fat dicks shaking in compass with these huge and flacid bellies is what I call art. I really mean it! Take care of your health, dude! Love from Brazil, Love from Daemon!
Dios mío! La voz de Jack Black!
Poetry in motion!
Sons of beaches.
buffering
nice
What tenacious D cover can be wrong ?
These two are a national teasure
You boys have to make the next red dead redemption's sound track
😂😂😂😂 wtf did I just watched
This is ai right  ?
Just guys being guys
WE NEED A FULL VERSION!
"Santa and Jesus have some fun on a beach"
Idiots
Accidentally bought tickets to their Milan concert. If anyone needs two tickets, hmu.
Now we need an edit of Bowser singing this
Infant Annihilator 2.0
WILL NEVER GET ENOUGH OF TENACIOUS D 😢🎉❤
It's interesting to hear an evolution of Jack's voice. It got    deeper
This is way sexier than the original video.
Baby making music right here!
Sexy video
oh my
Why didn't they do the whole song? Excellent cover.
Kyles got a donk
Why is it only 1:49 :'(
Jack Black has an amazing voice
BRILLIANT JACKS THE MAN, SO MAJESTIC, FUCK1 BRILLIANT
give him a grammy award.
Joy incarnate
Amazing cover but its hard to concentrate with those packages bouncing around the screen...
Need a 1 hour version of this so bad
Jack Black's unfulfilled aspirations to be a rocker has turn into a pathetic  display of continuous failed attempts bia imitations and forced situations in his movies. I like him as a comedian...A rockanroller he is not! Sorry Jack I'm sure you must have a lot  of 'friends'? but if they are, why don't they tell you to stop pretending to be a wannabe!  You kill to Jacks 1 the rocker and 2 the comedian!
Kyle definitely stuffed those trousers with some toilet paper
New tenacious d film please jablinski
PLEASE DO A COVER ALBUM
Was expecting Peachs   Was not desapointed
KG is packing lol
This was really cool but am I the only one that couldn't take his eyes off of kg's package lol😂 Man's got it going on down there
As a muslim Arab  I never thought I would one day enjoy seeing two fat white men running naked on the beach !
🥰🥰
The choice of swimwear is spectacular
all i see is kyles dong flopping around, is that where the band name came from?
😂
The greatest thing I’ve ever seen.
Well, I loved the song but I'm not quite sure about the imagery.
Ah. Such an amazing cover from you guys! Plus I suppose it's your take for pride month, yes.
Holy damn Jack! The vocals are incredible in this!!
They needed Chris Isaak to play the part of the model, with the same swimsuit, unironically.
Gnarly!  Which applies to both the sounds and the visual, haha
recoil
I wish they did the whole song. Awesome cover.
I wanna be the next jack black, hi jack
I demand the full song and video rn
I have 3 different versions of this song saved. Guess im adding a 4th.
Oh, to be so free!
brilliant, thank you
Shit, why am i crying?
TÃO LINDOOOOO
I remember when they first came on the scene, feels like yesterday. Long live the D
weirdest video i'm glad i watched
JESUS SAVES!
Stop standing by and help these poor creatures get back into deeper water.
Lol you crazy fucks
WE ARE NOT WORTHY WE ARE NOT WORTHY WE ARE NOT WORTHY!!! Awesome.
ok
MAGNÍFICO!😂❤️
I love how you can close your eyes and listen to this and it's a beautiful piece of music, then open your eyes and laugh. Never change, Tenacious D.
these are the worlds oldest kids
Are we gonna talk about it or no? I'll be here when we do.
I think they’re in Love…. 😂😂😂😂😂
TA BIEN GUEVUDO EL KYLE GAS ¡¡   XD
Kyle and Jables are packin.
Best version of this song 1. Tenacious D!! 2. Chris Isaak 3. HIM 4. Corey Taylor  Kyle and JB are legends!!
The D is back baby.
jack black is LITERALLY the only musician on earth that can turn everything into a joke and it still be perfection.. sings funny over a funny video and i still watch it 20 times in a row because its an amazing cover.
You may not like it, but this is what the ideal body and performance looks like
haters gonna hat but this is what the peak male physique looks like.
Life Goals right there....
I'm truly mesmerised
And now I can't unsee this.
Beautiful song. Great rendition.
my man Kyle packin
That was beautiful.
This song is gold to be real
I rewatched the tenacious D movie and all I heard was vowser
Can’t … unsee…
not tenacious d causally dropping my favourite song for pride
These two are definitely raw dogging each other
🔥❤️🔥
If this gets 3M views I swear we gotta get a new film announcement hammett!
absolutely beautiful
incredible
best video of 2023
this is the greatest thing ive seen in my whole life.
This is the greatest and best video in the world.
I am way high right now, thank you so much for that!
Strange.
Need more than 1:50...so epic
Not gonna lie... bit jealous of the cameraman
Just saw you at Rock am Ring, the show was awesome!!
This is what peak athletic form looks like and there's not a fuckin thing you can do about it!
Best Bromance EVER. Simply Beautiful! Just like that.
Really need a full version!
What wicked thing to do 🤟🤟
Great cover of one heck of a track!
The both look happy so I guess the sea was not cold. Good cover of the song btw.
❤
😭
Wouldn't it be awesome to see them on America's got talent?
I chose to believe this video was AI generated.
they are amazing!!
Who would have thought kg would have a hawg like that. Nice
The song/video I didn’t know I needed. ❤️
Chris Isaak sang this with real emotion in his voice but with Jack you can almost hear the smirk
In a world obsessed with image, Jack Black is the turd in the punch bowl...a true musical talent that nobody can deny. ❤🤘🎸
They look so happy
Should have done the whole song. Would have liked to hear some Wicked Gas licks.
The day I'll be able to bee as free spirited as Jack Black, it will be the best day of my life... but I'll probably die before reaching that day, it's literally impossible for me to be so free spirited, without any worries.
Thank you
Is there a better band in 2023 than THE D! I would say absolutely fucking NOT
omg THEY'RE BACK
Gotta get Bert Kreischer out there with you boys 😂
The 1st thought that came to my mind was: "Is this some father-son bonding moment ?"
For men, there's nothing quite like the love for your best bro
Uncle Jack, we need Brutal Legends 2!
Damn, Kyle is packing
Ah great. Now I have beachphobia. 🩲
True definition of "fat and happy" 😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉
My gosh this is f*cking beautiful
is that swimsuit tuck friendly?
What's crazy is today I just found an old Tenacious D cd from 2001 & now this pops up!!!
Looks like Jack dropped the long beard. It definitely makes him look younger but i liked his beard 😂
0:48 - Jack Black takes the full brunt of that wave impact, leaving no power left in it to trouble Kyle.  What a unit!  😆
Pls collab with NSP!!!
Is it Ron Howard?
What an inseparable duo of friends ❤
These two majestic beasts are the definition of HUMANITY
They are so underrated!! Tenacious D for life!!!❤🤩🥹
Thanks for the laughs gents. Jack breaking the wave and Kyle not pitching forward took how many takes?
Well, you got guts.
Jack black things 😫
!
This made my day 😂
You can almost see Tenacious D's Nuts
😂OMG...
perfect it was perfect right down to the most minut detail
not even a cover, just a few bars. lame. Go all in or nothing. Since he ruined the Mandalorian with Lizzo the Hutt he thinks he's a big shot now, as if
So Effin’ amazing guys!!!😂❤❤❤
Don't look at it don't look at it don't look at it... damnit
Woke fools
Please come back
ASMR
Beautiful! ❤
❤😢
So, 1 minute songs are a thing now then? Did the attention span get that bad ffs. No go home
here they come, out of the side hatch...
Much better than the original one.
What a bromance! ❤
No.
This is art.
Kardashian Gass with the sparkly ass XD
*We need the Tenacious D 2 Movie!*
It just doesn't seem to matter what comes out from JB & KG its always brilliant!
I was crackin up when Jack Black came out in that swimsuit but when he started singing I started feelin somethin for real
Dear God this is beautiful
мне нельзя ставить лайк но , это лайк
This is a masterpiece
What we got here, it's Santa Claus and his shorty, fatty, chunky assistant... 🙄🤮🤔
Sounds great! Could have gone all day without seeing that! 🙊🤢
Cannot unsee..... 🙈🙈🙈😂😂😂😂😂  Makes me want to add this to my acoustic set list though!!
Baywatch 2023
Truly Epic!!🙌
I Love you JACK BLACK, and I don't ever not love some nobody. Especially dirty libs, yet you're my favorite.... besides my inner dirty lib.
I can’t unsee that 🫣
“Americans”
Its a visual masterpiece let alone the heart wrenching vocals
hypnotic
Years ago i was on a Concert in munich and your Show was so awesome 😊
pretty shure somone got wet by this @Tenacious D
Daaaaaaaaayuuum that was HOT!
Goofy af, 😂😂😂.
Got damn son, now we know what the  D in Tenacious D stands for!
Mom!?............is that Santa Clause?
We need a longer version!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahahahahahaha, retards ... xD hahahahahaha
I DOUBLE DOG DARE CHALLENGE TENACIOUS D FOR BOTH OF THEM TO MAKE A VIDEO OF JUMPING IN A POOL OF GLITTER TINY GLITTER SEQUINS DONT COUNT SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO A SEQUIN FILLED IN A POOL AFTER.
Now let me hear this song in a loop for the next 47 hours
I'd like a nice man that'll enjoy a chunky lil native like myself like those 2 friends are going all out on beach. Had to double check tenacious d for a min thought it was mud Neva mind. And Kyle's suit very nice sparkles
Just a couple of legends having a romp in the waves. 10/10. Also I love that KG's shorts were covered in glittery rhinestones, didn't notice that till the close-up at the end.
I loved this song already, but this is an amazing cover!
This is the most wholesome video I've ever seen.
Tears in my eyes …..🥲
what a rollercoaster of emotion.
Reminds of when Frank and Jane clotheslined that other couple on the beach.
they are beautiful
Damn kyle, you packing🥵🍆
Why he's wearing a regular pants instead of a swimming pants with a jiggling di*k? it's not hygiene
im not gonna lie, came here for the bulge
DO THE WHOLE SONG!!!
Damn. I’m only human. 😢
This is a beautiful rendition.
Post the full version we demand it!
Guess I know what band I’m listening too while I do the yardwork🤙🏽
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Art, the god’s have come all the way down to give us this piece of heaven
Art
The majestic nature of the land whale is so calming and empowering 😏……😂😂😂😂lol ❤😘🥰
💕
Witchooo
2 days ago I got the urge to listen to your music and it was the same day you dropped this. Connected to the D 🗿
Dad bod's forever!!!
Sexy
Way better than the original.
Boss ! Loving it...XD
All of the s*** going on in the world today it's nice to know Tenacious D is having fun playing in the surf
I'm so wet right now (I'm a man)
This is what the world needs right now! Tenacious D will lead the way! ❤
cringe
👀💦
they should so do a tenacious D covers album
dafuq did i just watch?  i'm gonna watch it again!
The sexiest music video of all time.
How do they make me laugh? I don't understand why I'm laughing. xD
This is the way.
I had a pretty wonderful day today, and then I saw this and it capped it all off. I laughed at the jiggling joy, I felt the emotion of the quality cover. What a deadly mixture 😅 x
It's nice seeing large gay males actually comfortable with their bodies especially frolicking on the beach I like seeing that, these are two real bears grrrrr!!!!!!! I suddenly have a longing to be a cub and hibernate with these two in the cave of love.
Kyle got that HOG! Good for him 😂😂
We are so back!!!!
Confused boner
Too good for this world 🥲 we are blessed, friends
Like Kids playing in the water😆
I read the title as “wicked” like rhyming with “picked”, felt embarrassed once he sang the title… 😳
love it
Estos monstruos realmente me alegran el día 😂
One of the best little songs... 😂and the video is pure gold 😭
JB and KG are beacons of hope and happiness in an otherwise bleak and depressing world.
Kyle B Packin LMAO
I would never think that the white boxer would be better to swim in.
Chris Isaac would be proud of the music. Stanley Kubrick would be confused by the video.
Already fell in love with you years ago
Me casually taking a shit while listening to the gods, would rather it no other way
this slaps
❤🔥
I love this just 2 best friends
Dammit why can't this be full length
Props to the camera man, I have no idea how they kept up with them. Magical beasts
All hail the D!!!!
I can't unsee or unhear this. 😢
Chilling DX
Cory Taylor woukd be proud too
This is pure art dudes.
it's like watching poetry...
Keeping it funny…always!! 😂😂
the amount of people who don’t know this is a cover baffles me
Jack Black, turning straight women gay, and gay men straight.🤣🤣
Was the water warm? 😆
Is this Rick Rubin and his mate?
nice! edit: The song is cool too!
They really need to drop new music. This was incredible lol
Awesome to see their brother like friendship still going strong! 👏
Ha! I've been listening to their cover wishing for a full version, and got this gem. And it is a gem.
Jack Black is a great vocalist. There, I've said it.
full song pls!!! its so good
There’s way too much floppage in this video 😂
Beautiful 😍
Missed opportunity to tweak each other's nipples, but otherwise a satisfactory cover of the song.
babemaking music..
Que alma tan libre y hermosa sos Jack Black te amoooo
omg i'm so glad i'm still alive
sing it allllllllllllllllllllll plz jack !!!
Thanks for getting peaches out of my head 🤘
This is insanely beautiful. PIease do the whole song. I’m blown away.
This does bring a smile to my face
This is NOT funny.  How can I be on the verge of tears watching two half-naked fat old dudes frolic in the surf?
I'm loving all the tenacious D content this is amazing
This is most wonderful video ever made.
Guys, we need another movie with you. Like, stat.
So glad this band is getting revived
Better than the original video 💯 !!!
Move over horses. There’s a new dream in town.
LES GO STONE SOUR
Now I can rest in piece.
Fuck yeah!  😂😂
Another movie!
Are they stuffing or just hung like horses?
Fucking A in the sand my BOIS! Shout from SA! Come say at my Guest house!  - -Ocean Bay Guest House. The best in Port Elizabeth / Gqeberha!
😄❤️
Kyle has old man balls
Santa having fun with his favorite elf❤
It is amazing. I wish it was a bit longer. Jack’s voice is amazing. I love it❤️
They are putting the D in Tenacious D
we need Jack Black as a president of the Earth for sure
What the hell did I just watch?
This is disgusting.
Look at Jack out front at 0:47 taking the brunt of the wave - protecting Kyle - true love.
Their faces!!! Nothing but happiness and joy!
Wonderful. Actually brought a tear to my eye.
petition for a full version
Love it ❤😂
Literally the most wholesome thing I've seen this year!
Nobody loves no one.  I love u all!
LEGENDARY✊🏼😎🤘🏼
Some love stories should remain unseen....
Bravo 👏
I can’t explain why but I needed this today.
ok, that was touching, pure and funny all at once
Jack and Kyle you are the sexiest men alive!!  😘💋💋💋💋💋💋 Bring back parody music videos! I need it, you need it, we all need it!!
How is this sexy filth allowed on youtube!?
Awesomesauce!
The camera shaking makes me feel like i am watching this in VR
They are majestic.
Too short! Didn't realize Jack could sing this well.
For all the fans of Wicked game, this is exactly how we aged. From young and sexy, to this ⬆️
I can never unsee this.
I cried, I laugh..
Cine 🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬
06.06. Hamburg Germany -  I ll be there <3
Faboulous lungrai mortal9
This is honestly beautiful
Can't believe this year is the year I'll see them in a concert.... This is a dream come true ❤
This is awesome!
just a yidshit and his shabbos goy trying to cash in on memes
500zxrr 800 a dayrir
Holy crap, Mr. Black that sounds awesome!!
The world is not deserving of these GODS!!
Put down the Twinkies and go to the f*cking gym, this is eye rape. I can't unsee this.
If they don’t make a giant comeback I will be mighty upset
Like sacred whales of Neptune frolicing in the sea.
This is going to be featured in the second Mario films post credit scene after Peach again breaks Bowser’s heart.
This is the sexiest thing I have ever seen in my life... and I am a etero man.
So normally I can’t stand Jack Black, but to be completely honest I like this, and want to hear him do the full song! 😎👌🏼
<3
Can we take a minute to appreciate the elastic on KGs briefs ? Containing those puppies in the surf is outside the laws of physics 😮
Wow they got Bowser to make a cover of wicked game!
When your willie flops freely in your underpants kind of happiness
BEST vocal voice of 2000's  🎵 🎙️ 🎶
Came
The first thing I thought was to send this to my girlfriend... And I did
😭😍
this really made my day <3 ty D
Pure Joy😂
Imagine going to the beach and seeing Jack Black and Kyle Gass jogging along the waterline in their underwear
🤣🤣🤣🤣sois grandiosos 🤣🤣🤣
Full Version, Take My Money!
Tenacious D really stepped it up for pride month. Bear lovers worldwide are drooling
If they rolled in the sand together then Yes... but no such luck. Mediocre guys. I expect more from the dynamic duo
This is hyping me like crazy ! See you in a week in Milan ! ❤
Everything they do just makes you smile. May Tenacious D live on forever mind body and soul 💖
its insanely good singing, dot need the bizarre video still lovya i seen tenacious d on school 16 yrs ago
🥰 JACK BLACK IS MY HERO  I LOVE HIM  2023-06-03    I WILL COME BACK CUPLE YEARS LATER AND LEAVE ANOTHER COMENT  MUCH LOVE   #JACKBLACK

I've never seen anyone walk slower in slow motion
This is what happy people look like
Such beautiful souls, god I just love these two!
Puhhhhleeeeease a full version of this, my hard rocking amigos!
Makes me think of Leahy and Randy from Trailer Park Boys
A true masterpiece
Everyone needs friendship like this, world would be such a better place.
I really really really want to hear a full version cover
OMG, those were majestic vocals, i wish i could listen to a full 4 minutes 49 seconds of this. oh wait, ill just go listen to the throwback banger, thank you, you tenacious beasts
Fucking Awesome!
❤️💜💙
♪One wiener alongside another wiener♫
You know damn good and well you were watching KG's package flop too....
I need that confidence in my life rn
Jack Black is a fun, fun dude.  I'm pretty sure I've enjoyed everything I've ever seen him in.  Tropic Thunder is my favorite.
I did a laugh out loud. It still sounds beautiful.
They’re back at it again ONLY A FEW WEEKS!
Damn kyles tenacious Dick 😮
Yayyayayayyayayaya jack you crack me uppppppppp! You wicked man!!!
Amazing, this is pure art!
How did they get the copyright to use the training montage from Rocky III like that?
KG is a shiny golden god on guitar but I am grateful that he stuck with 6 strings and didn't choose to wear a 7th.
Those are the fanciest whitey tighties I’ve ever laid eyes upon.  😢 beautiful
now you have proof that they're packing
Orran vovô sacudo kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Why they so good? what the fk is wrong with them? for reals
This was already out there. cut the crap guys
Frustrated singer
Disgusting

"It was just a normal day in Rust as a naked on the beach"
Thank you for your blessings oh gods of rock

Esses gordos lindos❤❤❤❤❤

Jack Black and Kyle Gass focusing On Tenacious D!. I've wet my trousers twice and forgot to zip my fly once.  10/10 review.  my 2 cents.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
The first 'I' in the chorus is actually so beautiful
You are national treasures.

Their jiggling is almost hypnotic… it’s like a lava lamp
I need a tenacious d movie 2
I need more. Need more. PLEASE
Ok time to watch Pick of Destiny
Fucking majestic.

Бегущие моржи в погоне за лососем и эйфорией🤣 Уманчук

Ahhh man, I was hoping it'd be a full version. This is just the same version they did on Sirius a few months ago... Still can't not love it.
They look so happy

MEGA-EPIC!
lol
This is really chill.
for fuck's sake, guys, where's the full version?! my heart just exploded in sadness, the cover is PERFECT!
Just 2 majestic beast running on the beach
Simply the most majestic piece of music ever recorded & captured in 4K. *GRAMMY*
the best band covering the best song? the universe is healing.
Gross
Love this guy
They finally remembered the best song in the world!
Trying way too hard and failing
Thank you, Lord, for allowing me to be born in this era so I could bear witness to this majesty🙏🏾🥲😆👌🏾
please adopt me?
gracefully aging
The funny thing is that them running isn't even filmed in slow motion.
So beautiful guys, we love you
😂
I have never seen two grown men look more happy in my life! I love these two! ❤😂❤
Legends!!
oh my god, the beauty can bearly be contained.
Epic
This is the sexiest song of all time. These two knew exactly what they were doing when they covered this! 😉
fucking gorgeous dudes, I wish I was running with them.
I love TD, but this was pretty mid. I've heard better covers.
Dayummmmm, I love you guys 😅❤👍👍👍
Why am I laughing so much while watching this? Help me!!!!! 😂😂😂
It was always the D
When's the CD come out
Wow.  "All Balls" Kyle Gass.
I live near a nudist beach, where men of the same age and build do this naked. Now all i wanna do is film them in slowmotion to this song😄 Not exactly sure where to upload it afterwards though..🤔
MY GOD, MAN!!! Absolutely amazing!! Need the whole song!! RIGHT FUCKING NOW!!
Nobody will ever love you more than Jesus.  Chase the living water brother.  You're a great child of God. Bless you and your family brother.  God gives you his blessings.
I can't seem to look away. They are so majestically terrifying, like a really pissed off unicorn. Love the song!
Thank God for TD.
I ❤❤❤❤❤ this!
We love you guys keep up the genius work❤️
🎚️✔️
I really wish they would record the full song
Just like how some children only can be loved by their mothers, some bands (and covers) can only be liked by their fans.
This music video makes me happy
What can you say, true love!🥰
Whichoo
when one of them die, i will look back at this and cry
Man, that's a lot of balls.
This could stop all wars and conflicts worldwide now. Share with reckless abandon
Estou preso no botão repete. Alguém sabe como sair? 😅😊
Nobody guitars the way KG guitars. I feel like I've been pushed into the deep infinity of an acoustic abyss ❤.... that lasts 1:50
If nudity were socially accepted, these  guys woudl be totally naked 😂
Kyle needs to see someone about those giant old-man balls bro.
👅🐻Delicious
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
God I want them to do a cover album of beautiful ballads like this
Like watching unicorns
Beautiful people doing beautiful things. xoxo
It's me when i swear that i'm having only couple of pints this time
Exel +
Good lord that was unnecessary!
The world needs the D more than ever, I hope there's an album on it's way.
we need a full 3 to 4 minute version of this !!!
Beautiful
Love it. 🤣
I pirated their title album when I was a kid in 2002. They were the first band I loved so much that I actually saved and bought their album, it was the end of my pirating escapades, they taught me artist appreciation. Me and my friends were probably some of the first listeners of these two back in the early 00s. I just wish I had the foresight to buy their vinyl.  When they come to my town their stage had a giant erect penis
Wtf.. This is 1/4 of the song. I DEMAND more!
I did not know I needed to see this.....
OH MY GOD IS THAT JABLINSKI GAMING???
Majestic frolicking bearded med. ✨️
I didn't think I needed to see this today... But I'm glad I did 😊
This is AWESOME!!
So happy we still have REAL artists! A.I. wouldn't think of that. I want to go to the beach now.
D 4 LIFE
Is this what yall did after you beat the devil in a rock off
Kage lost weight
Another romp with the D, as their rendition puts a gleeful spin on the wicked game of music videos, they convey a refreshingly lighter version which I find endearing. Kudos to Jack and Kyle.. entertainers extraordinaire.
I'm crying
Kyle got that meat
The most majestic sight these old eyes have seen. I am inspired. Motivated. Moved. Happy and sad all at once. Thank you. JB and KG.
And also Witch you.  Great stuff.
Corey Taylor did it better
This gave me a massive smile on my face for 1 minute and 50 seconds 😁
No gargling mayonnaise here. Just majestic creatures where the ocean meets the sand.they are forealz.
Need the full cover
Wish you we’re coming to download festival 😢
THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME
This is exactly what I needed and I knew I needed it. This is why I come to the internet.
FVCK, thats beautiful :'D
Finally
Jack black can do anything he wants
I regularly watch middle aged men on the beach here, this video got the best background music by far.
This has been my favorite song my whole life and Tenacious D a favorite band lol
it looks like they pooped their pants but out of their dicks and not their ass
I came so hard ………….so Godamn hard
Rock those guts!!....you guys Ruul
Love love love it! Thanks boys!
The internet NEEDED this.
absolute legends.
Saw the thumbnail, saw where it was from and here I am ready for anything you want to give me.  My late son is sitting on my shoulder as I watch.  He was such a fan, too.
O saco do KG parece slime
I just pray Jack Black doesn't go all Hollyweird. He's bounding on corny
Everytime I see Jack Black I do a doubletake. He and a classmate of mine could be identical twins down to their beard patterns.
Like Mario and Princess Beach
i love this era of the D cover songs
Majestic
That was beautiful ❤️
its a master piece but its way to short 😢
This is just beautiful.
Yo, Kyle’s PACKIN!😂
It's no 'Fuck Her Gently' but it'll do.
That was beautiful and at the same time, hilarious. I love Kage and Jables.
Rob riener?
Bromance?!
Like when Johnny Cash awarded the definitive version of Hurt to Nine Inch Nails, Chris Isaac should, imo, should acknowledge this cover with a blessing, it is so damn good
I was so wrong.. fat can be beautiful.
wow! I really love the original Chris Isaak - Wicked Game but this is also really nice
Now do the Crying Game!!
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen for a long while.
🤔Fascinating...
Guys come in Riviera Romagnola to play this masterpiece!!!
Totally cracked me up love it lol❤
On behalf of all overweight, middle-aged man around the world: Thank you!
They say you can't define what is pornography, but you know what it is when you see it. Shocking this was on YouTube.
Are they actually back
The power of super mario bros movie!!! Tenacious D 4 eveer hahahah
that boy jack flopping a HOG
This is how I run in my dreams.
Simply erotic.
Alright Jack, one more time but play it straight. Sing one without having your chin tucked into your neck.
Esto no puede durar tan poquitoo aaaaa
Choose to be happy friends.
This makes me think of cousin who just recently died in April. He was a huge TD fan.
I hope your friendship is real and its never ends. Please make some music!!!!!!
No one talking about how jack is absolutely packin
Man, they're slow. But they look good 😃
Watch out for Sharks!! 🦈
That voice 😍 👌 🙌
This is just so god damn beautiful! Absolutely hilarious😂
Is that his Dad? They both got the same grin. A son’s love for his father.
Just 2 goat's doing goat things. We love you tenacious D!
Not only is this song incredible.  But Tenacious D cover?!?!?!? My fkn heart is complete
As we see here, in their natural environment, a couple of Tenacious D specimen. Note the joy and excitement in the eyes. This leads to wonderful, melodious songs which come from their golden throats. Some could say the best songs, but nay. Tis but a tribute.
Best musical appearance by@tenaciousD 😂😂😂😂  Well done. The world needs more humor 😊
The bear community is going places
This is the greatest and best song in the world... Tribute.
I love this song.
Dude, I totally miss you! 😢
True art
We need a full song asap!!! To good for just a sound bite. You guys should do an acoustic covers album.
Tiddies lol
Love you guys,since you made the movie Pick of Destiny im one of your biggest fans❤
F'ckn Love this hahahahahahaha
KG: "I thought we were just gonna show up in our underwear"  JB: "Yeah that's what I did"
It's actually tremendously beautiful.  I wish they would do the entire song.
Ladies and Gents, we see here two majestic north american Bears in their natural habitat. Just enjoy in full awe this display of natures best work.
When I heard HIM cover this I thought that was tops ...  Well, how wrong I was.
Sounds so good
WE. NEED. FULL. VERSION
Jesus Christ is King
Jesus that's good
Now my life is complete 💞
It reminds me of Swans!!!
ultra wide video ftw!
The way he covers this song with so much emotion is mazing. Jack does everything with 100% passion.
I love this song and don't usually like covers much, but this was absolutely stunning. Jack's voice has matured beautifully.
ART
Bowser has such a beautiful voice.
My god, yes.
What is happiness? When I watch this video, something touches my heart.
😂 WTF
I like how their cover videos have their own story. In the last one they dove into the sea at the end, now in this they emerge from the sea, victorious and energized.
Excellent, but considerably too short. Just when you start enjoying it, it ends.
Now this is totally what the world needs - cheers guys!☺️
Mesmerising
That right there is what peak male alpha dog looks like.
2 beautifull whales❤
YouTube has peaked. It can only go downhill from here.
Glorious
Kyle Gass is pretty underrated guitar player! Carries the tune so well while Jack Black's voice blends seamlessly in. Superb cover! Wish they did the entire song!
Fuckin love these guys
you may not like it, but this is what peak human performance looks like
Bulge City
Bring the D! Bring back the D! And don’t come quiet!
Thank you, I needed that laugh.
Bellissimi <3
Contraje de baños y armados hasta los dientes
I wish I could look this fabulous running in my swimsuit :(
Bliss
this is the greatest cover of one of my fav songs ever. truly better than the original.
I’m dead 😂😂😂
Best!
Oh my goodness.  It's beautiful!
Camera man ruined the end by not panning to the sunset smh
This is great
lol it was you guys !
Nice that the Steiner Brothers appeared in the video. Didn't know they were fans.
This is the least aesthetic thing I've seen ^^
Sports Illustrated has not gone dark
Kyle Glass's ( • )( • )   >  Helena Christensen's  ( • )( • )
Chills
Oh no....
Witchu 🤣
God got carried away with the Talent and Absurdity when he created these two.
Finally a bit of sanity in a world gone mad.
What has been seen, can never be unseen... And I am loving it!
anyone else end up just looking at kyle's bells flop around for a min & half
Amazing! I love the fact these guys have no ego or shame when making a video like this!!!
Sharan! ❤
we need a full version of this song
🤣😇🤪
Majestic, like a couple of Narwhals diving out of the ocean. o7 Salute to you, Tenacious D.
Too short
This is glorious!
Legends
Love u guys
We had to play this song for school band back in the early 90s.
Tenacious D more like Dad Bod Gods.
Jabels and Rage Cage. A true bromance that even Satan couldn't break up.
Oh! The waves!😂
Play at 0.5x speed. Ethereal.
Truly beautiful
They're Phat
2023, tenacious D covers HIM.. and run naked on the beach. Humanity has got hope back!
Would love a follow on from pick of destiny 🤣
The shortest 1:50 minutes of my life
I've heard the audio before; Jack Black has got some SERIOUS vocal chops.  👍
We are the D!
10/10
I need a pick of destiny sequel
I love them so much it's insane
This is the best cover of this song. No one, I mean, NO ONE !! has the voice, feel, and bouncy stomach of Jack Black.
Baptized by fire and crucified in passion. My lord and savior...  TENACIOUS D 😮
So good
Jack Black had more talent in his jokes than I have in my most concerted efforts.
😂❤
We need either or both, a serious and/or cover song Tenacious D album
10/10 perfect!
Nobody loves no one… 😂
A blessing from the gods
😆😆😆😆 OMG! THIS GUY!
Jack just enjoys the shit out of everything he does.
We have been blessed
HOT!!!🤤
Omg ! I love this song…❤
just wonderfull, everything... thank you!
Made me cry
I didn’t come on the Internet to cry at the beauty of humans being happy, but I’m sure glad I found it.
Perfect. No notes
I swear, these guys are having more fun now than when they were younger. They’re awesome
Sounds great
Dear Apple, please give us a “lit lighter emoji” your PC is screwing up everything that is “rock n roll”
i just want another tenacious d movie where they are now old, have families, but they go out on one final adventure.
Omg i love this vibe!
Dude some of these short D tracks absolutely kill me. I *NEED* more of this, injected right into the 'I'm in love' part of my brain.  Also, realizing Kyle was wearing studded underwear at the end was great.
Still love these guys.
Wicked game will never feel the same. Loved it❤❤❤
The childish joy. I envy them.
i think it's the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my Life..
Just guys being dudes
Will this ultimately lead to a new, BETTER album? The last one completely sucked!
What a great 1:49 spent today <3
Great classic 90s song! I can also sing this entire song on par with Chris isaaks vocals
Is there anyone else who enjoys life as much as Jack Black?
I want David Attenborough narrating the frolicking of these magnificent beasts
The D will forever be the awesome sauce that makes the sandwich of life worth eating!
And that was the moment Princes Peach came to a heartbreaking realization. It was Bowser. He was the one that got away…
Love this so much lol I’m beaming and grinning ear to ear in an airport right now listening to this on repeat ❤  Also love the video these guys are great 😊 ❤
Amazing. And 10/10 for the softporn. As a gay man that digs bears, I approve
Love it
It feels like a near death experience. An eternal moment of peace and love with somebody who truly loves you. Peace.
Happy Pride Month 🎉🎉🎉
Jack's voice has always made me laugh, but today it made me cry.
These mother fucker are just next level. Thank you.!!!!
It's disgusting and beautiful at the same time😅
Protect these men at all costs!! Love you tenacious d 🤟🤟🤘🤘
Having a bad day????! Now you're not............#jackblack #tenaciousd #kylegass
Be you angels?
Just guys being dudes
One of this the things I've always loved about Jack, not his acting skills, or his singing skills, his comedic skills. He has all these in awesome abundance. But it's his ability to have taken all the fucks to give on this Earth, put em in a rocket and f***ed em off at the Sun. I truly wish i could have been  like this. I wish nothing but continued and great success for  Tenacious D.
May these men live forever.
Kyle is so cute
They took a beautiful song and made 100 times more precious.
I have somehow fallen in love with this short song
1.7m view as per this comment, just 139k likes, don't forget to like!
Jack is a national treasure
So glad I didn’t watch just fast forward through this. Stooped!!!
That's fucking hilarious
The LGBT community should support this!)))🤣🤣🤣
beautiful
dope son !
Hopefully they dont think these 1 minute songs are enough. We need some full length material!
Post again in Black and White. Way sexier!
Baywatch don't have a chance now
The vocals are really good. Fun video. 🙂
Chris Isaak would be proud
Santa on Vacation with his son and future head of the Christmas Machine....love KG and Jables
HIS VOOOOOICE IN THIS COVER!!!! UNBELIEVEABLE
Your Frickin voice tho! Mmm
Fucking EPIC
Was he wearing bubble wrap?
Fuck, now I'm blind.   STOP THAT!!!!
Two living heritages of the best that modern humanity can produce.
×D
thats sexy
Hummm, Santa on underpants, anyway magical 🙏🇧🇪
you know. i was expecting a perfume brand at the end and i would have bought it. no lie.
Fucking majestic
Happy Pride Month from Tenacious D.
Now my life is complete
So majestic, so lovely
We couldn’t even get a full song version?  What is this?! Lame…….
Legends.
Aaaahahaahaaaahaaa
So soothing too watch 😇
At first I thought that the sea had thrown 2 whales ashore😂
Nobody loves no-one= Everybody loves someone!
Greek god body !
lol its some kind of weard watching this and smiling xD
this is what peak male body performance looks like. This is what I strive for, to be when I eventually hit my late 40's with my musical partner as well. Nothing gay about giving a little slob to your best mates pecker.
idiotZ
I love this guy with all my heart! He is my idol! He brings me pure joy when he does things like this!!
Being fat is funny. Unless you're a woman. Then it's beautiful and empowering.
I…. Did not know, grace and beauty could make a man sob 🥹 it’s must of been the synchronicity. So much poetry, so much; Love! 🥰✊
The lyrics destroyed my heart The singing destroyed my soul The bouncing nutsacks on those two destroyed my visual receptors
Need a new album to drop!
Needs more saxaboom
Grew up listening to chris isaak and this is a great throwback to that time
Why arent you guys worries about your health have you tried eating healthy
MORE!
The D needs to get back!!!!!
tribute
I love it….all of it!…. The whole packages.
i love these guys. great musicians and comedians. easily make you laugh but then throw out a amazing cover like this. The D forever!
I just wittnessed the top of the foodchain reveil themselves.
i aKshally love this video. Wair didju getcha cozzi from? i need one for a friend.
What lovely D
😆
Wow that chorus 😮
The parallax effect y'all created with this frame rate and movement speed is epic.
KG got the BULGE
I fucking love this band. They are the best band ever PERIOD!!!
Spectacular 👏👏👏
Cant help but love these 2 guys. So fun and entertaining.
Damn I completely forgot about these guys.  Now it’s time to listen to there old shit again.  Memories
I’m all in for this remake of Chariots of Fire!! Awesome stuff, when is the movie coming out?
It's a cover of Chris Isaac
That voice is insane
I wish it was longer.... *sigh* (puts on repeat)
KG looking like the most athletic Santa Claus in history
Majestic.
I was so scared to click on this video, I thought jack black was wearing a speedo
That looks like so much fun.
I know that water was cold af.
Tenacious D are pure hope in those desperate times.. Thank you so much guys
jiggle effects look real 👀😂
They're living their best life
What have we done to deserve this majesty?! I am weeping. I have seen divinity and the remainder of the world has faded to monochrome. This is the poetry of the fabric of reality reaching into my synapses and blinding me with abject bliss. I’ve watched two men transcend…
KG lookin good!
women of culture here we meet again!
The D The true rock gods
Love the song, but the lads look like a 1980s wrestling tag team in those outfits.
What a view...
😂👍🤘
JB and KG are frollockin!
Dayum! Kyle be given off them Goblin King vibes up in the front  🤭
This instantly made my morning. Very beautiful, the song as well is beautiful
🤟🤟🤟
beautiful song
“Wit choo” 😂😂😂
YeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaasssssssssssSSS
Their facial expressions make me happy.
Moob jiggle
This is brilliant.  They make a master piece through this cover but force you to watch this absurd video to enjoy it.  Perfection.
*Jables and KAGE* We need a new Epic like Wonderboy!!!!
First WEIRD… now these TD video drops?! Truly the Lord is a merciful & benevolent God 😂
Boys.... its time for another Tenacious D movie
Look at those HOT man bulges~ lmao UwU
I'm the only one who has noticed the package of Kage? 🥵
You guys are fucking lame!
I'll be in my bunk.
Kyle Gas looks like a greek philosopher
My favorite duo, ever in history.
Great cover, beautiful, but the huge bouncy bulges!
whats wicked is, it isnt longer. Jack, your voice is still insane. Thank you both.
So sad I missed out on seeing you guys yesterday here in Germany… I didn’t realize rock Im park started this month…
Are we getting an album? Oh I hope we're getting an album
Jack taking that wave was majestic.
I love thisssssss🎉
I thought I ate shroom for a second
just wish they didn't simp out so hard during lockdown...
This is what the peak male form looks like.
This is just beautiful. I love you guys!!
The original is 4:47 min long. Chris Isaak from 1989. It's a funny video but they could have done more with it.
Tribute came on randomly for me the other day and I realized I'd been neglecting the D for about a decade and, then Lo and Behold a new release is recommended! All angels sing and round us ring the spheres!!
Cine 🚬
Boys just wanna have fun
wi choo 🤣
You really made me laugh and the available weekend😂💙   Greetings from Croatia 🇭🇷✌️🤠
Me so horny and sentimental crying after those images
These are just men. Innocent men.
Damn. Jack has pretty good cardio
That was magical.
Majestic 🔥🤘
por que me dan ganas de llorar ?
Awesome!!!
Jack Black looks like he could be Rick Boogs father
One thing is that super funny video, another thing is that extremely great voice that Jack has, and also shows on this "cover"-song
Too sexy for yt
Jack likes bear porn, no news to me 😝 lol
Endless bouncing.
Guys, please, we're begging you... do a full cover of this.  You've nailed the tone of the guitar and the voice. It would easily be the best version of this song.
These two hold a special place in my heart! Tickle your fiddles and shake your gibblets boys!
So good and so fucking funny!
Now I understand Killmonger when he said          “It's beautiful”
I see slow mo running and immediately wish it was a cover of baywatch theme
Honestly think pick of destiny would've done so much better on a streaming service. We need another D movie
On repeat!
why it looks like they dont move hahaha just run in the same place
D even a straight man can accept
Two years ago I lost one of my best friends to a police shooting…  One of our favorite things when drinking waaaaay too much was to sing along to  Tenacious D….This song hits right in the feels.   Thank you Jack and Kyle for helping me remember my friend again and again with your music.   RIP Jeremy   Love you brother
Never change! 😂
Do ya'll think Kyle stuffed for this or.... what?
Ahh this greatness takes me back!!!
Love You guys!
I love you both. You two have a beautiful friendship.❤
I cry.
what a wicked game to play. . . gay chicken
I need more of this
The boys are back!
I need the full version of this song, right fucking now
Pretty sure this isn't new audio - its the same cover from the Sirius XM performance. They just did a video for it - awesome.
Two magnetic, majestic, unbelievable and talented sonsabitches
Love it ,no fucks given
The best anti-body shaming PSA I’ve ever seen
Pure Gold!
Wow.  This song suits Jack so incredibly well.    Literally gave me cold chills.
That's true love right there
Nice,Cardio for this week done!
Top renditions of the song together with Corey Taylor and HIM.
That's the quintessence of well done covers
Dude, this isn’t LSD! It’s EPT! I told you I didn’t want to have to piss on anything to get high!
Please cover this entire song. I’ll happily pay all the money.
This is everything I never knew I needed
This need to be trending… what a talent
Looks like my dad and his friend trying to put our dock in the lake the other day😂
Goosebumps
Сам такой. :)
Seek therapy
Love a person who doesn’t take themselves too seriously. Woke minds, take note.
Es como una obra de arte del renacimiento. Ni Miguel Angel pudo crear algo así.
Beautiful! :) Loved the song too! :p
Why have I already watched this 5 times! Please come back to BEND,Oregon!  I nnneeeeeddddddd
Great singing. And awesome to see people loving life and frolicking in the spirit of youth! (Hope you don't mind if I don't watch though, and just listen.)
Jacksback ❤❤
L E G E N D S !!!
i wish there was a full version of the song. this is sooo good.
I fukin love you guys!

I love how it has music director in description 😂😂😂😂.
I love Fun and Joy and the big blue sea ,so of course i love this video from Tenacious D!  Great::)
I ain’t gay but that very obvious thing is making that Dawg in me come out
No bodyshame I love it
I love you guys.  Holy shit you're stellar!
Jack Black must get some ass like every day! Poor Kyle...
Jack Black =Jack of all trades
Well fuck if this isn’t the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen and heard
2023 needs this. So so very bad.
Not for nothing but Jack’s voice is crazy good! I’d stack him against the best of them.
Art
Our very own singing Narwals of the land. We are so... blessed? Love you guys!
Yall should do something with the weekend idk why but I feel like yall would put out some bangers.
I hate these half naked models running on the beach music videos, which have NOTHING to do with the song.
Is it Baywatch?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Long live the D.
Simply hypnotic - I am entranced.
Couldn't take my eyes off of Rages bag man, absolute heft! 🤟
Thank you❣
So good... 🥲 My Heroes❤
Is there a longer version of this song by the D?
Absolutely insane and in apropos of nothing. Well done gentlemen
I had this fucking song stuck in my head on June 1st and kinda sang it like this. Has anything more perfect happened in my life.
Gei lol
That guitar makes me think you guys would kill a cover of Cinderella from Firefall. Great work!
holy cock kyle
It's nice to see best friends doing best friend shit!!
😅🤣😂
Amazing
AI generated fake bullshit! KG would never run without socks & sandals!
Trevor Something dropped a cover of this track recently too...
a cover i did not know i needed<3 i would slobber all over jack black if i only could
LOVE
No IIIIIIIIIIII wanna fall in love… with you… no iiiiiiiiii-
Mesmerizing
Majesty is the literal only word that comes to mind.
ahahahah 😄😄😄perfect ! absolutely perfect !
I have listened to this song.
You guys are weird
You 2 are simply living the Gen-X'er dream! I personally would love to prance around in my tightly whiteys with my BFF while listening to the sweet and soothing tunes of Isaak as the soft sand and cold ocean wake up my old feet. Gen X, the original Rebels of the 20th century!
Should have been called "wicked shame" 🤣🤣🤣
Fully sick bra!
Better than coffee.
💝💝💝💝
i blasted this and my ex came running into the room at the end super over excited and asked  "WHO WAS THAT?!" and I just give him a devilish look and respond, "You know damn well who it was." Then he says accusingly, "Jack Black?!" and then I say, "Duh! Now go to your new lady friend and let me eat my cheese wheel in peace you son of brisket!" doors were most certainly slammed. I feel like I won though... forever alone!!
Words are futile.
Omg I never thought I’d see a music for this
I just sent this to my wife in order to make her miss me. So wild, free and unfettered by their own majestic beauty.
Outstanding cover boys
no  you didn't.
JB is a national treasure
Jack Black is my spirit animal!!
Masterpiece
Give me your money.
Great song, disturbing visual 😂
happy pride month to my favourite couple
I got to admit that Jack Black looks adorable at the end.  🙃🥴
Just two guys being dudes.
I am fully prepared for their country album
That run...the moves, the pace, the grace, the technique...its allways amazing to witness makind achieving perfection
RELEASE THE ISAAK CUT
Kings ... simply kings ...
So nobody's going to mention Kyles huge package.. nobody? Ok lol
Hahahaha.. I was hoping it was this song.  One of the best songs ever.  There are a couple guys that make me feel this way, but I'll never say names.  The dude with the white beard looks like my stalker at work.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does this mean the D is back?
I wanna see this video clip at normal speed with the sound 😂
Taylor Stephens is possbliy the best Music video director on the planet right now.
<sigh>  "OK...."     <zzzziiipppp....>
We don’t deserve Jables and KG.
sportin that singlet!
Majestic!
Beautyful
God DAMN
So many dislikes... WHY?!?!
BROO
Can't wait for the cover album "This is just a tribute..."!
😮🤘💣💣💣💣💣💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🗯
Like it or not ladies, this is what peak male performance  looks like. Absolute chads.
Did no one notice... every single part of KG..? Like... EVERY part?
OMG. Beautiful
Everyone is all JB,but what is he without KG?
Jack Black is so frickin awesome!
"true art is so hard to capture these days"  jack black: hold my beer
The most beautiful thing I have witnessed in my entire life.
Two proud stallions marching in the surf.
Sweet ❤
It's a wicked game but a thing of beauty Tenacious D play ❤
sparkly shorts!!!
Happy to see you two guys in such a good shape. Looking forward to seeing you in Berlin. 👍🤘
I love you guys ❤
I wish i had a bestfriend like that. #LonglivetheD
True happiness
Ok cool Song. But i have one Question. Why ??? X-)

necesitamos ea versión larga! PARA ESCUCHAR MIENTRAS UNO SE TIRA A DORMIR Y DISFRUTAR DE LA RELAJACIÓN
I used to loathe Chris Isaac’s song as it came on VH1. It was so boring. Sure the woman was hot.. But this? I can’t touch this. Beautiful.
You beautiful people!
Wish they'd stick to D originals.
I think they’re lovers
I don't know how it would work, but I want a Tenacious D and London Grammar collaboration
I can't comprehend what I just saw
Not my proudest fap. Bookmarked anyway.
Yes. Just yes.
Great song & video!  Next time I will join you on the beach 😁🏖
And the whole thing was done in ONE SHOT! Epic cinematography!
Magnificent. What a majestic creatures you are!

And why does Santa Claus have panties in rhinestones?
Visuals are 10/10
This is honestly an amazing cover. I might like it more than the original.
PERFECT❤❤❤❤
For almost 2 minutes i stopped thinking about Pamala Anderson.
This video has motivated me to run to the beach to look for peaches
*PAUSE*
Masterpiece ❤
The worst thing about this song is that it's sooo short!!! Ughh 😭

Bears🐻🐻‍❄
WTF WHY WHYYYY 😂😂😂
🤣🥰🥰
me and my bro after we both endured a rough come up
👍👍🔥🔥
Pointless clowns! Something not right about these two🤔

This brings tears to my eyes and I don’t know why 😐
Zu geil XD XD So viel Männer Erotik
When’s the new tenacious d move guys come on we need a move reboot someone needs to make a petition so we can get it I would empty my bank for it 😂

#freethenipples 😂
Waiting for the note… and yep chills. nailed it
LOL
Omg
Very sympathetic Music Video
Schmoooooth! 😎
Never felt like this for a long time but Jack Black voice for me is metal god level. Like Freddie Mercury he is the one of a kind
Jack Black fans are eating good this year.
Why is this too short?? I hope a full version^^ jack jave a huge voice talent, but when he sing a real song he can do it really deep😊
Thanks you por hacerme happy toda mi life
Cage packin heat.
Still waiting for the promised live gig with German singer Helene Fischer 😂

Well, Bill Murray is fat as f in this
This is a HIM cover
Jack's voice never stop amazing me!!! Awesome!
The carefree energy is really contagious!
man. I wanna be like tenacious D when I grow up.
You have no idea how much I needed this.  I’m sitting here holding my cat, knowing that she’s going to pass any day.  😢 I got a beautiful song to cry to, and a few too many laughs in between.  Love you both so much.  I can’t wait to see more.  💜
i unironically fucking love this song also look at those hogs i mean their dicks
kiss, kiss ,kiss😆😆😆😆
😂😂😂😂
This is even more majestic I thought it would be
I need a full version of this so bad
i think a rock cover of wicked game like HIM would be the greatest thing ever
HIM would be proud
Tenacious D... Dancing in the tears of Chris Issac!
Magnificent beasts in there natural habitat. Beautiful
what a reason to spit out my morning coffee
Why just 1,5 mins tho?!? Crushed this cover!
Just when you thought this song couldn’t be remade into something better, these two rock my socks off!
This is based AF
This is such a good cover, you guys need to release the full version!
Love me some Jack Black man ..... lmao
its crazy cause the past week i started listening to the original constantly
This is peak male performance!
Jack splits the wave for Kyle so it doesn't knock him over at 0:45
Love the song 🎵 Love the shorts 😝 Love the video 🥰
play it at double speed for how it really would have looked xD
PLEASE make a full version! would be amazing.
Damn... Life is fleeting
Tenac
The HIM version is the best, but Jack black is good.
I loved every single second of this masterpiece 😭💜
Why do they look like overgrown toddlers 😂
True frendship
Why and how is this guy all buddy buddy with JACK BLACK!?
Full Version Please!!!!!
A full version would be amazing...
the best footage of bellies ever
I think they feel all messed up for supporting joe biden
Lol I fucking love you guys so much.  And mr black, you made me dream of you lmfao.  Your fault 🤣🤣🤣
so these are the mythical beasts Rhett and Link are always talking about
This is what a real man's body looks like xxx
No one notice the apsolute BULGE on the majestic men?
This music video got my laptop pregnant
Me when I'm joyous and frolicking
Disgusting forced inclusivity. They wouldn't be in the video if they weren't fat and man. 🤮🤮
you can see the moment it goes from fun to a not fun hahah
HIM did it better
Wow, really wish they do a full version of this. I couldn't love this more, it's like butter going down my ears.
literally woke up sat at my desk rolled one and watched this first thing in the morning, love it!
Is this Death Stranding 2 ???
Did the camera man just try and zoom in on Rage Cage's 'husband bulge'?
I know JB sings this while playing as Arthur Morgan
This looks nothing like a chode to me.
<3
WHERE'S THE FULL SONG!?!?!?
They look so happy 🤩😆
They ruined the video clip 😉😂
"Yucky"  -absolute degenerates not recognizing the awesomeness on display here
Oh yeahhhhhh
More more more
Love it! Love to see y’all living and thriving!
The year of D
Awesome
Pure beauty and grace
This is just in soooo many ways BEAUTIFUL!!
OH WHAT'S THAT? JUST ONE OF THE BEST VOICES IN THE WORLD TODAY DOING A DREAM COVER OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS?
This is actually the best version of this song I have heard
awesome 😍😍😍😍🤘🏽
Fantastic song ruined by this GAY video.
I'm beginning to suspect Jack Black is gay.
Day one Adam and Steve banished to earth. So majestic.  (Eve held the camera)
Anyone else getting Baywatch vibes from this?
This is a good cover. 👍
Proudly galloping on the beach.
Kyle looks like Santa Claus on summer vacation
we need more comedy movies with you Jack
Playback x2. thank me later.
‘Friends will be friends, they’re running naked in the sand’! This clip made my day. All hail the mighty D!
Wow! Just..... WOW!
never thought they'd become cringier
Is it only me that i am listening and i see bowser singing it in my head?
"me sees video games" me: oh that's cool  "see wicked game" me: oh oh oh this is going to be a good year
i cant stop smiling
Это что-то прекрасное
This was so out of context for me. It just came up in my recommended randomly and I had no idea who Tenacious D is or what this is supposed to be lol
beautiful, sensual.  gotta love the D🥲
Touched me in ways Iv never been touched before🥲
Hipnótico
What about cover of D'Angelo - Unshaken
I literally kept thinking 🤔... why am I watching this??? I'm sure I could get the audio without this  video? But,  I couldn't stop watching.   Beautiful cover BTW 💜 Thanks guys 👏👏👏
Can we please see a Chris Issak reaction video?
Amazing
LMAO
This is why ai cannot replace humans
I hope they had a defib on standby...
Whatever our size or age boys will be boys.
The yearly tradition of watching pod hits different this year things are going great for jack always knew he was a musician ffs when u can get led on board with something yk youre special edit: HE MET MFKN RONNIE JAMES DIO
Still HIM takes it for the best cover of this song
Tenacious D's had a thing with games lately
The video wrecks the song.
I hope to have at least HALF the energy these guys have at their age, I love it!
I'm not dropping a "underappreciated" on a video that got 1.5 million views in a day but Jack sure got one of the finest voices in modern rock and metal. Voice coaches could probably tell why but for me it is because even on a 30-second parody or comedy rock song, he always puts 100% feel and emotion into his vocals.
Beaches, beaches beaches beaches beaches iiiii love yoooouuuu
just the first scene alone is beautiful... Amazing work
Production costs must be millions of Dollars. Awesome
You both lost weight! Congratulations!
This music video is better than the actual song
Sometimes I think this world doesn’t deserve Tenacious D. ❤❤
oh its KG and JB
Damn KG is packing shmeat
God these men are national treasures
Going to tell my kids this is the original 😂
What can I say…I’m hearing new colours in your voice. Richer timber, smoky and still giving a irony too. Great work gentleman. Bravo 👏🏼
The most majestically mesmerizing thing I've ever seen 🤩
Imagine a movie sequel directed by tarantino ❤
Even sexier  than original video.
This got to be the sweetest video I have seen in 2023
wow !  This is the most powerful thing about love for life  I have ever seen . I cant stop watching it it brings me so much joy . cover is great too :)
You guys are amazing. So much love ❤
OMG. I need the full version.♡♡♡pplssss
It's just GOTTA be filmed  in black and white LOL
H.I.M
❤
This is so awesome!
this is art
Try not to c*m challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
Powerfull !
Beautiful creatures, save the oceans
Run Antoine Doinel, run...ah no, wait...
Jack black's voice , damn
KG was like ooo fukk dont tackle me😂😂😂
Secret homo lovers
Bowser.
This video is far too sexy for youtube.
АХАХАХАХАХАХАХ
i love the bendy at the beginning
Wtf did I just watch lol
The most beautiful thing I've heard since FHG
Love you guys! x)
Did I just watch 2 Minutes of KG and JB running naked on a beach?
😊😊
Were it not for the video I'd be crying so hard
Peak male performance
I just came.
Lmfao
I bet you guys are so much fun, unironically jablinski games is incredible and I’ve been a fan of the d for years. Love you guys, have fun with it.
damn what a time to be alive
Weathered Jables And Powdered Gass!
When we needed them the most💚
Kyle is packin.
Algorithm
Genius.
It's like watching a lava lamp.
beautiful.
Venture out into the coast, discover what happened to this town, and find out who you truly are: Spartrian Field
I cried.
It makes me so sad to see such talented dudes continue to be so fat. They won't live to ripe old ages if they don't get it together and get healthy....
A cover that can rival Johny Cash’s rendition of Hurt! Truly the D is the best band of all time in the known universe and unknowable multiverses!
On the 8th god created the D…..
Gollum game: relises TD:
No shame. No ego.  Only Destiny...
Awesome!!!
*Friends holding hands are running naked in the sand*
The song: emotional love song The music video: two middle aged men running half naked on the beach
They are walking so peacefully😇 [ i liked my own comment]
TWO FUNNY MEN HAVING FUN!
Im absolutely love hearing TD again after all this time. and I cannot get over Kyle XD
Peaches Peaches Peaches!
Looking good :)
Take a good look everybody, thats what two Alpha males look like
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.  What a wicked thing to do To let me dream of you.  What a wicked thing to say You never felt this way  What a wicked thing to do To make me dream of you.  No I, don't wanna fall in love No I, don't wanna fall in love With you.  Nobody loves no one.
Tenacious D have good music
I can't express to you the misery I feel knowing this is only 1:49 long, i need the full version
dad?
Gave me chills
JB sounds soo much like Dave Grohl I want them to do impressions of each other-- maybe even cover each others' songs!
Jack's tits are firmer but has saggier nips.
the best duo
It's so majestic ❤ I've been a fan before  i even watched  school of rock i feel inlove with that movie 🍿
#37 on trending! Let's fucking go!
Kyle and Jack -gift from god of fat ass rock god.
We need a live action sequel of Tenacious D
Glorious
https://youtu.be/5zHpBd6gbjw🔥
Will they drop a full version tho?
I didn't know my day needed this.
Release the full song!!!!!
Didn't do the whole song? 😔
Damn you JB & KG for making me enjoy watching 2 ole fatties frolicking on the beach for almost 2 minutes! 🤣🤙🏽
wish it got a longer version
This is very sweet. *holds tears in*
Eu chorei e ri ao mesmo tempo
Long live the D….
Jack the Black is AAAAAAAAAAAAH AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Wait.... Jack Black is gay?
Is it just me or were your eyes also glued to their junk?
im gonna need more please
This band changed my life
Kyle has a Big D
People might talk about eye candy but they never forget the eye main course.
What the holy bat shit was that! Nice cocks!!
KG's underwear are a paid actor and deserve every cent.   How the hell did they stay up?
just the visual alone can make a man cry
Corey Taylor baby!
So elegance.
Beautiful
First video games and now this great work guys and keep making the best songs in the world
I always thought this song felt too long. Now I don't feel it's long enough. Amazing cover.
I always loved this song and the fact that ya'll did a cover just made my life.
I love you ❤
What magnificent beasts!
Really praying that this is all leading up to Tenacious D 2: The Sequel
this is what happiness looks like (24/7)
LONG LIVE TENACIOUS D
You can feel and sense the bromance.
No matter what happened in the past or what will happen in the future it won't change the fact I know I was born at the best time possible because I get to experience Jack Black
Smash
Why is this so good when youre only half serious?!?!
I was not expecting more Tenacious D, but I’ll gladly accept it with no exceptions
this is silly, but somehow i want to be silly like this when i grow old ahahha and happy
HIM 🔥🔥🔥
this is glorious
Ive lived..loved...fathered.... I can now, after seein the D frolicking on a beach in Speedos, finally die in peace.
I still remember the day my belly touched KG’s belly at the second festival supreme... water has yet to touch that spot!
Peak male bodies
Look at those boys bounce...*wipes tear*   It's BEAUTIFUL!!!
Take my money 💸
i am suprised at your age you can do this omg
Badass
lol ❤❤❤❤
Jack's vocals plus his amazing friendship with his pal makes this video godlike. Tenacious D will Rule 2023!
🤣🤣
I love it! (I’d like the whole thing, please!!!)
why he kinda packin doee?????
Where are you guys? Wish I could have been there. 😍
Peak of peak boi's rock on
You beautiful humans! Been waiting on this for an age! ❤️
That is some powerful singing. Love it!
Forget Rocky and Apollo hugging on the beach in slow motion…we got the Rage Kage!
Men. These are men.
And lowe, two angels walked amongst the waves of the sea, and the people did know true beauty
This is so umami, unless umami is a Puerto Rican drag queen . . . then it's not umami
You're back! What majestic things
Wicked indeed. Wonderboy and Young Nasty Man strike again!!
Truly breathtaking. I wept...
😂Ahahahaha
Ville valo.....
Kyle’s hogged out. Respect.
Awesome cover, the D rocking out a classic jam.
My fiance said it was Santa and his son going for a run!!!
This is content meant for onlyfans 🤣
No way these two are real Is this cgi??
Gross...
No matter how busy these guys get, there's always time for the D 🤘🏽
Nothing like watching two beautiful friends frollicking through the waves together. Magical~
😢😂😂😂😂
A manatee sighting on the east coast? That can't be right!
Put a HUGE smile on my face. We can all se a bit of that so thank you =)
Pro tip: do not sing this to your new love interest at karaoke night. It's not as sexy as you think it might be in your drunk brain. For that matter, if you're at a karaoke night, check the lyrics before you sing.
Here I am thinking “ah another Tenacious D video, this should be funny”, and then Jack Blacks voice actually melts my mind
JB and KG forever!
One of my favorite all time songs has been dethroned by a cover. Simply angelic.
Packages ❤haha 🎉
This is the pinnacle
The D is so hard right now
My headphones when I’m walking to class ( I’m the tiger on the Frosted Flakes box )
Always makes me smiles thanks boys
majestic.
Oh lawd, im gettin bricked up rn. Dont @ me
this K-Pop ?
I'm not ashamed to say I'm a bit chubbed out right now.....
Breathtaking!
Just here to add my voice to the masses calling for a cover album, k thanks
The fact that this isn't the whole song leaves a hole in my soul.  I FUCKING LOVE THIS BAND. THEY ARE THE BEST BAND EVER. PERIOD!
ahh yes, two gaming songs in a row
I’m so glad we are here today. The world would’ve been a real different place if the devil took KG back the the underworld to be a sex slave. So glad they won that rock music battle against Beelzebub
mature bears XD
we need an extended version it sounds so good!
NGL, I couldn't stop staring at Kyle's hog.
I can't stop replaying this
Do it again!  This time with hats.
can you please release a full version of this song???
The raw power and beauty of nature.
That was 1 minute and 50 seconds of me staring at KG dick.
Wtf 🔥
sickness
I love this😊😊
I'm sorry, I was mesmerized by the swinging balls.
That was the greatest video in the world… tribute.
YES FINALLY OMFGGGG
f*ckin madness 💙💯
It’s impossible for me to not hear the song he sang from nacho lebre😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
True Friends
Try to watch the whole video without looking
Great song.  Redone.
The video - Majestic Golden Boys playing like the gods they are The song - art. Literal art.
Jack looks like he has a tiny pecker but dang if Kyle doesn't look like he's packing heat.
Even better that what the thumbnail promises!
This video totally changes the meaning of the song for me. I think the love can be read as the love between these two lifelong friends. It is something that deserves to be celebrated more in songs referencing love!
Kyle is ‘gassed’ at the end
In my free time, i usually watch video two overweighted middle-aged men running along the beach side.
beautiful. music's good too
DAMB! this is a really good cover.
lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't be the only one that wants the whole song with Jack singing seriously?
Better than Isaaks version
🤠
All jokes aside, jack blacks voice is so amazing! Yes he jokes a lot and puts on a show but man, this guy has some pipes for sure. Long live Tenacious D🤘🏼😤🤘🏼
I remember listen to him while driving out of town
MM mmm mmm look at dem tid ol bitttes!!!!!!
I don't get goosebumps, and randomly just got them...
What a PERFECT video to release on the first day of PRIDE MONTH.
This is giving “high in the woods with my pants off”
Is anyone else just staring at how much their man boobies bounce up and down in slow motion or is that just me. Literally whole video while jack black is singing all I can look at is his bouncing mibbies no homo
This is True Love ❤
I aspire to have a friend to be a duo like this.
Plz do the full one
Bro was gambling with those underwear👀
Holy shit this is piece is gorgeous
I was absolutely dying when he pronounced it “witchoo”
mythical creatures spotted at bay
Hello to the D from The Ghost of Bay City MI, hey Jack, and Kyle my name is Wraith Smith, my dad met you at a concert once he told me he shook your guys hands, and got an old shirt signed by y'all, I guess you didn't expect his son to reach out, and say hi
This is a fever dream
My eyes are up here
As a member of The Bear Community all I can say is......WOOF
Chris Isaak and Helena Christensen got nothing on these two. 🕺🏻🕺🏻
The amount of sex appeal can be seen from outer space! Almost cried
This isnt the best cover in the world, its just a tribute
Fcking beautiful. Most majestic thing I've ever watched
Wicked!
This better be a precursor to a full album
I can't stop laughing
Masterpiece
I’ve been having a rough couple of months and this just made my year. Thank you.
leave me alone babe, i'm listining to Jack Black sing over Kyle Gass guitar.
wtf....
This is amazing! Need a longer version!
I'm not sure about the direction of this new Baywatch, but the sound track is gonna be great.
How can anybody not love the D?
its kinda funny how theyve just been doing goofy stuff for years
Damn, these lyrics are deap. Awesome video.
金溝錐
Bowser now with the covers😂😂
Why in the HELL did I click this video...
Sublime. Mágico. Excepcional.
Wish their songs were longer. Peaches, Video Games, now Wicked Game. All under 2 mins. They’re barely songs.
i repeat the song is amazing
I love that these 2 are such awesome friends and so goofy with each other. Very wholesome and very good to see. 😂
The D has Risen!
Beautiful
art
That look in Jacks eyes at the end tells me that he knows the secret of true happiness Love you man !
Oh my god
Wow. Who knew I needed this in my life but apparently I did. Thank you!!
I never thought I’d be so excited to see a video of two grown ass men in there undies running on the beach😂
Thank you D for keep making music! You're great!!😭
The Little Mermaid looks beautiful
Love Chris Isaak! Awesome cover!
Their jiggling is almost hypnotic
This is wicked
WE LOVE JB AND KG ❤❤❤❤
This is beautiful.
I love those guys! Great awesome video! I love the look on their faces! Great vocals too! Best video & song EVER! I must say I love Chris Isaac's original version, however Tenacious D ROCKED THE HECK OUT OF THIS GREAT UNFORGETTABLE SONG! THANK YOU! DESERVING A GRAMMY AWARD!! ❤❤😮😊😅😅❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Perfect
Wicked Games - Parra for Cuva
the sexist thing i have seen today
The amount of meat in this video, it's like once you see it you can't look away
There's just no way that we can win, that was a masterpiece!
So weird
I miss the days when i lost track of time in shrooms and tenacious d just relooping in the back ground
Man I fuckin love you guys
I can die now...im for real this hits harder than a stepfather
Such a young heart. You guys never grew up and please keep this up.
Not my proudest fap......
Friend goals
Never in my life have I wanted to get laid by Jack Black more! Such a glorious person! Such a spectacular unicorn 🦄❣️And he can pull off that singlet, in more ways than one!🥴😍
The D Returns Full Shaft!!!!
Kyle packn heat, jesus christ.
That is what peak performance is like... the song is alright too.
Life is short  so live hard ❤
Oh man, what a time to be alive!
This may be the most beautiful thing to have ever been released to the internet.
seduction at the beach!
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time I watch 2 musical artists run around with the lead singer in a leotard, I'd have two nickels - which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. (the other being NSP with Dan and Brian)
Wonderful.
Man...
Uhhhhh. Corridor Crew called.. We may have problems..... ;)
w00t! The D

"Santa Claus frolicking at the beach" is not as majestic as it would first appear.

What a wicked game you play by making this song so short but so beautiful 😢...
This gave me chills... Love this duo of all my heart <3 Simply amazing
*_Goals!_*
The most majestic humans that walked this planet.
Too late. I already fell in love with Tenacious D❤️
I require a full version!
Pure Gold!!
Tenacious d does final tour about a year later Jack black does a song for Mario remembers how much fun and joy he got from making music now we have more tenacious d and most likely new tours thank the gods
Instead of peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches we got two dudes dancing on the beaches beaches beaches
Such an underrated voice……no matter the song or the insanity of the lyrics you can feel the raw emotion every time this man sings
This is beautiful! 🤣
Love it!! 🤘
Everything a post-pandemic lifestyle should be
I'm scared to hit like, I'm afraid I see these two running on the beach again....😂

Jack is now the best singer i know❤
Tenacious D...twice as big as they used to be!
I’d love to see Kyle Glass’s!  Such a hot #DaddyBear!
I'm not usually one for covers but this blows Isaaks out the water!!  Petition for an extra long extended fuller that full version, with more rock!!

Worst part of this video: it ends.
bulges of kings!
Jb & kg
Damn. We got two Uncle Irohs in this timeline.
Nuts.
Damn Kyle has that package!
Beautiful. Serene. Majestic.
The cover I never knew I needed
This looks completely unnatural.  Like you explained a scene to someone and they animated it. Thank you may I please have more.. I think
Look at these two beautiful idiots. LOL
Love both yall mfs, you're great!!! ❤
Kyle looks like Santa on vacation, and Jack reminds me of my best friend from junior high school. This is freaking beautiful.
Horrible, just like all their stuff.

We need a tenacious d cover album
That's perdy
Didn't know I needed KG running gleefully through the ocean today, but I did, and I'm glad I found it.

All from one movie cameo
Eu amei 🥰
😳🤣😂🤣🤘🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
They look so happy!
And I used to think H.I.M. had the best cover of this song. The crown now goes to the D! 👑
So nice of the props department to give Jables and Pumpkin smaller dongs for this short.
The original vid was in my spank bank aa a young lad, and this is in my adult spank bank.
burgers and pizza
This is adorable😂
Truly the greatest band of all time
Listening to this while watching and then while not watching the video changes things.
Kyle is packin
Majestic 😂
Everyone needs a little Tenacious D! So excited to listen to more of you art. Love you guys❤
Yessssssss some covers ur voices work together so well, and Jack’s power in his voice is so beautiful
Lets gooooo

It's illegal to carry guns on the beach you guys
This might just be one of the best things ever
IS THIS LOVE?
You should have redone shot for shot the Chris Isack video :3
This video made me ridiculously happy!
Incredible. You have to make a full cover!
Awesome!!!!
thatsalotta crotch action xD
Legends
The greatest band in the world is back
Thank you for sharing this beautiful moment with us.  I fear like many of the worlds most talented artists, the D may not be given the recognition they deserve until after they have left us.  I hope future generations will see the beauty that is the D.  Let Their bellies runnith over & remind us that the D cannot be contained by even the most accommodating of swim wear.  All my love -Lee
fucking hot.
#Art
Dog eat dog, every day. On our fellow man we prey. Dog eat dog, to get by. What a wicked game we all must play.
K.G. be packin
This has huge Wee Man and Preston energy. I love it.
We need the full version of this
This is the only song I can play on guitar. Now if only I had those pipes.
Perfect song to cover. Showing the love that is the D.
I always loved this song when HIM did it and now I love this version
❤
Nice cover!
Please a full cover 🙏🏻
https://youtu.be/IS9rEro_L0U
That is a whole lot of D.
generic c: its all fun and videogames until you have to really hit this high note part without busting the soundwave. (if he used autotune its hidden very good) its also the most traumatic song ever. Did that girl look good with that sand, how many of us got her?
ow god this is great !
Peaches needs a tenacious d remix
Kyle's packing
This is indescribably beautiful. The song is pretty good too.
let me say, you tricked around the dees , huh? (when you come up from a dive too fast and your bollocks seem slightly improved.)
my favorite song sang by my favorite celebrities. absolute perfection, thank you
This is my wife and I favorite song….. she was mad at first that it was remade……your lucky Jack that she likes you!!
Finally, something good to fap to
National treasures these two.
you should learn ballete then go to a beach with a thong and starting hitting a boogie, mejestic ballete
So this is how heaven looks like
Well this made my week. Thank you.
Love this!!!
Theory of a Deadman did it better and first.
Love the D
Yessssss!!!!!!❤
Till the end of my days, I will love Tenacious D
This is the type of friendship we should all strive for.
Thought it was the original video
I cant believe po from kung fu panda can sing this good
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love them!!!!❤❤❤❤
Mommy look, Bowser is running on the beach......
Just a couple bros enjoying life
Is that Julian Assange?  he got fat.
when the world needed two heroes more then ever tenacious D has returned ! i thought yall went to go get the milk on us T.T
Beautiful!
HELL YEAH! The D
That one last of us eqisode was neat.
This should not make me as happy as it does!
As I age alongside them, I'm privileged to watch them recreate the dance of my testicles in the shower each morning. It's a delicate, jiggly balance, and they capture it with artistry and grace.😊
What beautiful men
I love Jack Black so much! Can sing, act, is funny, so talented all around!! 😊
Happy pride month everybody
When Chris Isaak sang this song the video was almost pure sex and this video i can't laughing but it still a good cover
The perfect video to kick off pride month, a couple of bears in the surf. Great cover though, Jack's vocals are on fuckin point.
It's clear that Tenacious D is back, and this is now their year.
Love you guys ^_^
THEY ARE PACKING!!!
So new movie
I missed you guys
No I...
Man, I remember renting The Pick of Destiny on DVD from Blockbuster and I've been a fan ever since. And this beautiful man has still got it. I can close my eyes and almost see Bowser's face.
Happy Gay Pride Month Gentlemen.
So much lovely jiggling! <3
Beautiful, just beautiful ❤
The d lives on!
True Friends forever right there majestic AF
YES
Jack Black is such an underrated singer
this is exactly what I needed today.
Perfection
amazing
If you haven’t seen it the video itself is a parody of Chris Issak’s “Wicked Game” video lol😂
Fell in love the moment I saw the title, and The D did not disappoint. 🤘😍
Awesomeness of beach gods at a beach having fun,fantastic job on the video.
Pure titillation. YouTube has rules you know. 🍆
I just love you
Tenacious D!
Love this song, especially this version of the song.
How to make a vídeo clip with low budget!
Am I the only one with a weird boner?
Love you guys ❤
The song is fire
That was mesmerizing
Jack Black & Kyle: Our eyes are up here buddy. Me: I take my own decisions, thank you very much.
🐕 said:  👨 said: grab your 🥏
Absolutely beautiful.
I take Thais as an insult. A gentle one
CLASSIC
That guy has a huge sack
Epic.......

Rage Cage in the titie whities
Sexxy as hell !!!!!!!!

Thanks for the image dudes   Its pretty rockalicious
Peaches?
Now THIS is body positivity.
Such a beauty
Already 100k likes i wish it was me :(
When are you guys due to have your babies ha ha lol onyas

Still a better love story than twilight
FULL COVER PLEASSSSE!!!!!!!!!!

Jack Black and Kyle Gass, overweight and underrated.
This song is wicked good
Damnit, I've been missing Tenacious D in concert for 2 damned decades....;(
So disturbing
What in the earl of fuck
Please let me hear jack black and Corey Taylor duet this
Voice of the angels 😇 ❤ 💖
These guys refused to ever grow up and the world is a better place for it.
I wish to have a friendship as strong as jb and kg one day
Please please please we need a full version, your voice is amazing
What beautiful couple
Not gonna lie if you didn't know it you might actually think these two are brothers rather than friends.
This is the definition of homo erotica - just what maverick was missing ….
Please make this longer
Looking at Kyle is like looking at the mirror 😂 same bod lol
Lindo
All I could see was floppy dicks and bouncing balls! And sadly, I can't unsee it! Thanks, Jack! Lol! 😂
The sheer joy on your faces.. chefs kiss 💋
If I wasn’t a woman I’d wanna look like jb and kg
i loved the editing!
Jack Black please be the new Johnny Cash -esque musician that we need in this world
The D 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
God damn they look majestic
What did i just watch?
Bro, those weren't microdoses!
I'm always taken by the incredible voice of Jack Black. He's such an amazing singer. I've known about Jack Black for about 20 years now and I have to be honest in saying I don't really like his goofy shenanigans nearly as much as I used to, but when it comes to singing and just making music, this guy is incredible O.o
If we get the full cover. ❤I want them to do wrong to love you by isaak they’d fucking murder it
I have never liked a video this quickly before
Makes me wanna work out and hit the beach
big time Rocky and Apollo running on the beach in Rocky III vibes
New tenacious d movie? Cmon 😩
The real crime is how short this was.
"Wit chu..."
DO A FULL VERSION OH MY GOD
Thank you guys. Thank you.
Funny video & a great cover!
Stunning music as always guys! Thank you! ❤ No AI on the planet will ever follow that! 🔥
Daddies
Kyle is hot
They told me I'd never see a unicorn, now I've seen two. Such majesty of poise and movement, it literally bought tears of joy to my eyes.
Omg, I'm still cracking up, you boys are a riot!
Man, i wish i could live like Jack Black, just no fks given about anything, just enjoying life for what it is.
what the dood!
This made me laugh, cry, poop my pants and want those two handsome devils more than ever. BRAVO!
I wish my Celtics had Tenacious D
my man put a sock in his underwear?
I’m so glad I’m not only one who like this song 😂
Just two old dude running at the beach
Beautiful song, beautiful music video.
this was a beautiful video and song.. thank you.
🤘🤘
Like two wild horses,  running in the wind!
it stared at me first  😳
The power of Jack's voice is one of the most unappreciated in all of rock history.
Whatever Jack is wearing--perfection!
First Lingua Ignota then Tenacious D omg iconic
this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen
A wicked game 4 sure
I seen them in St Augustine and it was so much Fun - Just a Fun Great Show and I loved it
Please God drop another album! Please!
This is peak friendship ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah man, do a full length cover; you really nail the emotion of the song!!!
Just like the original, except in color! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I just did fall in love…with you…two.  Beautiful. Sending love from the UK. Xxx
The will be at indy state fairgrounds I'm excited
My favorite part is that it isnt to long
XD
them's a couple of buff looking dudes....
maluco o de barba branca ta com um negocio inchadao
That is fic awesome
Thank you for your art folks 🥰
Moar!
Ahhh, Jack, your voice is refreshing for the ears.
Can't stop smiling...   Everything about this is beyond amazing.
more arse in this video then what chris issacl got actually making the real video.
Long live the D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My man KG is packing some heat!
Hahaha you guys are awsome :D wish this one was longer though such a great song :)
Yes 😂
Saw the thumbnail.   Thought I knew what to expect.  Was massively wrong.  Couldn't be happier.  These dudes are something special and for me to have been lucky enough to grow up to their COLOSSAL musical range and ability? A gift of the highest order.
Hahaha 😂 😎👍
Look at these two majestic gods among men.
Oh my days! 🙈🙊🤣😂brilliant
Jack black really is just completing side quest now
JB, KG & TD FOR LIFE!! ROCK ON TO ETERNITY!!
So majestic!! &  soothing :)
Dear God. My eyes. Great song tho.
Спасибо товарищам из Тинэйшес Ди за наше счастливое детство!
Majestic
It's mesmerizing that for the first part, they both look like they're running in place. Reverse moonwalk in the surf. Love it.
Isn’t Jacks voice so true, as ever
OHHHHHH You are my GOTT
❤❤❤❤❤
They just love life.❤😂
There's a lot happening in this video.
🔥
The legend of the GAME was way hardcore! 🤘
Nobody loves no one...powerful!
Someone edit Bowser singing this to Peach 🍑
Gracias
How. Why. Than you.
Tenacious D 2?
NICE PINUS
It’s so sad seeing how old they’ve gotten, I can’t imagine losing them. 😢
I thought KG had a chode? This video suggests otherwise
Nice and wonderfull  ^^
Reaching new heights in obese homoeroticism.
Still a better love story than Twilight
Just saying this is not new.. ...
I love this, the song and the video.
just what I've always wanted.... slomo ball sacks.
The D is back, baby! FLIGADOO!!
Tenacious D cover album.  Make. it. happen!
How Do You like THEM peaches!?
Could this Be The Year Of Tenacious D 2
Legends do Legendary things
We don't deserve them...
JEEESUS CHRIST! My feels!!!
That was b e a utiful🖤🖤🖤
Every year thousands of whales, dolphins, and other marine animals wash up on beaches around the world. This phenomenon—called beaching.
😍❤❤
Me alegra tanto que tengáis porfin el éxito que tanto os mereceis
Best One-Shot Scene in History
This song is amazing but what the D has done here is basically resume it to the best parts of it. Majestic Tenacious D majestic…
He really can sing really well! 😊
my wife never saw the movie, really need to find time for us to watch it T_T
Why?
This man is a genius
Kyle and JB are flippin wizards.
So un inhibited, we can learn from these two! Love it.
Damn Socrates rock some big ol' ballz
This is art
😄
Well they nailed pride month cause that was gay af.
Loved it🤘💯
Love this song. My dad used to play Chris Isaak’s version all night long, sitting in the back room of the house & whispering to himself, back then I thought he was weird, only now do I realize that he was melancholic & only now do I understand that feeling
i loved every second of this
KG packing heat
My eyes are still burning😫 and it's not because of the seawater ❤
No one loves their first born like pharaoh
Voz bonita do caraio.
i was watching your movie again yesterday, i love you both, i m just a babyyyyyyyy
Hey guys, have you noticed how much some people celebrate being overweight? I mean, I'm open to self-love, but maybe they should do something about it. Otherwise, Tenacious D might soon be renamed 'Tenacious Double D'! Well  well, maybe that affects me a bit too, but frankly I'm too lazy to go to the gym, so if they invent a 'couch potato' version of workouts, I'm in!  Oh, so you're a huge Tenacious D fan! That's great because as Jack Black always says, 'Good music can rock any problem!'  But you know sometimes even the biggest rock stars need some exercise to boost their energy maybe we could help them record a new album called 'Trainacious D' after all they say laughter is the best medicine and when  If we work out together, we could be rolling with laughter while staying fit. So, how about an adventure of rock 'n' roll and crunches? Are you ready to unleash your inner rock star?   Hey, I can understand if you're a little taken aback by the proud declaration of being overweight. But hey, maybe they just see it as a genetic homage to the 'tenacious' genes! But to be honest, we should all take care of our health  to keep enjoying Tenacious D - and all the other great stuff in life. But don't worry, you're not alone in your thoughts. I sometimes feel too 'shitty' about fitness. Maybe  should we form a band: 'The Couch Potatoes'! Our stage show consists of sit-ups on the couch and air guitar solos while changing channels. What do you think of that?
Very emotional😭🥹the vid
aww... it's over already? Where's the rest of the song?
It's so different, Jack being this clown but having this super powerful voice. I reckon him and Kyle could do a really good album with a cover of a lot of songs like this because they play really well on acoustic.
always loved this song
So wholesome...love it
I now am interested in jacks lower area
it didn't look like you were moving at first
1:21 his right hand.  No, not tenacious D too!
I want another Tenacious D movie please
Gracias por tanto!
Best vid ever of two big guys running on the beach! Love me some Tenacious D!
Damn, Kage packin heat down there 👀
Ok the music is great but the video ruins this song....for me... for... ever.
Perfect
This makes me happy in pants
Is anyone else imagining this being sung by Bowser as he thinks about what happened after the movie? 😂😂
Something about that intro, the bends n pickin, reminds me of Townes Van Zandt. I dunno why, just feels like the start of  tvz song. It feels.
I wonder how many people know this is a cover
So romantic…
Another great performance from Bowser.
Not funny but yes. Fat
This is so good.
I used to hate this song, but now I completely loathe it.
I love how these guys can just go to the beach for a minute with a camera and come away with a totally acceptable music video
Nope, if they aren't sand encrusted they just aren't selling it...
Two water bears frolicking. 😆🤘😆
The jiggle physics are crazy
Don't do obesity kids.
Far better song for Diablo 4 trailer😂
They don't play video games anymore, but they do play a wicked one instead.
This is the reason the far-right Republicans will complain old fat white men are grooming our children.
We need a Tenacious D cover of all songs ever.
Cinematic perfection!
why this is not in 4k?
When you spend all your budget on the animated music video…
Majestic.
Oh my God!! He sing beautiful!!
Meanwhile in America...
Now this is a cover I can get behind !
A tribute: TO FRIENDSHIP
O f.... RIP replay button
That Noel Gallagher'll be turnin in his grave....THIS is how you do a cover, ffs!!
God these two are on a roll. Nice cover on Chris Isaak, absolutely gold! ❤
FML. LOLZ
This was one of the best videos of the year, thank you kings 🙏
Fkn amazing! Exactly what I didnt know I needed in my life!!!
This is far better then what Machine Gun Kelly dropped a few days ago. MGK should take a lesson from TD and only make music because he loves to make music and not just from the sake of making music to be accepted which will probably never happen.
Sometimes when I'm feeling sad I tell myself what would Tenacious D sing for me?
watching this made me so happy i love it
God Fucking Damn It Jack Black
So cringe and not funny
I wish I had half the confidence of these two me- no. these two peaks of masculinity
I freaking loved this in the post credits scene of the Mario movie!
Amazing Cover it reminds me of the Series Lucifer where I fell in love with this song
i always love seeing cage just vibing around. mans is just a happy lookin old man with a guitar and a story to tell. and of course jack is just like 'fuck it time for a leopard print spandex onsie'
This video just makes me happy
1 day
Please come back to ireland
Kyle Gass is the man of my dreams, beautiful man 😍
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Das ist ganz großes Damen Tennis ! Chapeau !^^
I don't know where to focus, even i don't want to
how they running but notf
Eww
Jack has been my favorite vocalist since I first heard Tenacious D like 20 freaking years ago lol. I seriously am in love with his singing. Even if he's doing more a joking type of vocals, his voice like flows through my soul lol.
not gonna lie, im impressed by kg's package.
Hay jack I lost you at barter fair were did you go?
Full version please
Tenacious d!!!🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💜💜😭😭😭 let’s goooo!!!! The legends !!!!!!
I have so many memories of this song ...thx to one more. Not sure when I will stop smiling
rest in peace puppers
How about a video where Kyle steals your schnitzel? :)))) "With karate, I kick your ass..."
Do I hear tenacious d 2 featuring dave grohl?
Ive waited so long for more of your guys music! This does bring me happiness 🥲
Instant Classic, again.
Imagine you're on the beach, chilling, reading a book, and these two emerge from the ocean. 🐬🐬🐬
There has never been a better start to pride month.
Omfg, the shark may have been jumped… still funny as fuck tho! Haaaa
Every Best Friends Song
holy shit nice cocks
A 3rd Musketeer is  missing.. needs Borat or Bruno character frolicking with you 🤔
Hear me out. Super Mario sequel. Starts off with Princess Peach, visiting Bower in his prison cell, and gives him a bit of shit for the things he did in the first movie. Then, when she leaves, Bowser starts singing this!
I guess that the theme of the next album will be games
Wtf jables and ragecage! Right in the feels!
Visual masterpiece. Pieces. 😂
Couldn’t stop staring at Kage’s package. It was like a larva lamp.
i dont play video games no more never played video games
Simply joyous
*David Attenborough voice* And here we find the rare and majestic Nacho Libre frolicking amongst the waves with other aquatic creatures.  It is truly a sight to behold and rarely caught on camera.
very tasteful
They now play video games
See u on Tuesday! Can´t wait!
THe best 1:49 in my entire fuckin life
GOOD GOD KYLE HAS A FUCKIN HAWG
Is that Rick Rubin?
Ahduahudhausha❤😂
I saw them live a few weeks ago in St. Augustine, FL and they played this - it was a good performance
Hilarious!
If I was a girl, I'd be as wet as they are. But all I can do is indentify (
gorgeous
If only it was in black and white, then it would be art...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ROCK ON
My life’s goal is the be the third fat guy to run with them half naked on a beach..
I knew this song was stuck in my head for so long....
That was glorious!
Man, Chris Isaak let himself GO! Helena Christensen looks about the same though, outside of a few gray hairs.
PLEASE make it full length, this is Awesome!
New movie??? New music coming????
They got better cardio than I do 😂
One of the songs of all time
Two absolute champions ❤ come back to NZ!!! ❤
Takes a lot of guts to do this.  Tenacious D: we have the guts
DELIGHT
Este concepto de vídeo lo ví. En La Mañana de Cristóbal Briceño
how would a new tenacious D movie be
My favorite karaoke song. Also, I am looking respectfully, sirs <3
And all these years I thought that song couldn't get any sexier...
Jack's swimsuit is so ... ... Jack 😅
I love this man, never change guys🙏🏻
Size doesn't always matter, but in this case I need a long version of this.
looking good guys
Kyle, why'd you bring a baseball bat to the beach... oh wait...
On an alternative universe, golden retrievers take their human pets to the beach.
Did the song inspire the video or did the video inspire the song?
Well, Wonderboy and Young Nastyman are back… that’s fucking teamwork!
BEST SONG IN THE WORLD... HAHAHAHAH. I love them !!
Even Chris Issak would have to admit the the D have done this song justice.
Jables held the same psychotic smile the entire time
No ones gonna talk about whats goinf on in the white haired mans crotch?
Hawt.
Awesome <3 like they are brothers. So handsome ^^. Jacks voice is so good in this song. Love it.
I never knew I needed a Jack Black cover of this
Wish it was full version, so damn good!!! Unbelievable voice 👌
KG plays guitar so beautifully
Absolutely love this song even more when they played this on sxm octane that version sounds a little bit better just my opinion u guys rock 🎸 tenacious d awesome 💥
This was just a tribute.
Simply beautiful.
Make a full length cover please!
Majestic beings in the wild.
Full album of covers please
what noble, untaimed creatures
Tenacious D going off this year with these Songs 🔥🔥🔥
Besides the musicianship and wit the charisma that these guys have is the ingredient to their success.
Amazing!!🎉
Frking legends
The last song I thought they would cover and yet it is still so beautiful
Baywatch 2, Starring: Jack Black and Kyle Gass

Lindo.
Why? WHY? I couldn’t look away. 😮
Hey It's Santa & his best  Elf of the year on Holiday....!!!!!
What a wicked beach run 😁
This
KG has a hog on him, huh?
As a straight man with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality… I can’t stop staring at Kyle’s junk.
“Friends will be friends they’re running naked in the sand”
They just radiate sexiness 😊
I believe that their friendship us one of the most wholesome things on the internet
they are the best pair
This has huge "taking my golden retrievers to the beach" energy
One must always speak what others mean to oneself before those people are gone.  Thank you for everything you have done for us, Kyle. We will always remember you.
That 1:50 went by so fast lol
wow literal goosebumps
This is disgusting, how is a woman meant to aspire to having a body like this!  Fantastic rendition of wicked game!
I GOT THE D TATTOO!
Great song
New Baywatch looking extra sexy
Sooo gooooood!!!!

Самые счастливые люди на свете
Sexy beasts.
Musica: 10 Desarrollo de personaje: 10 Voz: 10 Corrida: 10m
I'm so angry at the world cause JB's voice is one of the best in the panorama and nobody takes its in count because its a funny guy.
But can you kill a yak from 200 yards with *Mind bullets*?
I had no idea I needed this but thank you for giving it to the world.
The last time i heard this song was on a episode of Lucifer still a banger tho
BEST. PRIDE.  MONTH. VIDEO. EVER.
Don't know what's better... The song or the video
The thing I love most about this is they're so obviously pretending to run in slow motion, and then that footage has been put in slow motion. Incredible, powerful, double slow motion. Incredible, powerful double men.
Incredible One-shot, impeccable camera work, screw CGI!
they look like their running 100 miles a hour but are moving 0.1 mile a hour
Tenacious D is great musically and vocally which makes their goofiness all the funnier.
I have never been in love with two bros as I am right now
Damn! Jack nails every song he covers 💯🙌🏻
That was beautiful!
This song's always a vibe
Never liked this song til I heard Jack sing it.
Seeing Kyle's micropeen bouncing around brings me great joy!
I need the whole song
It's beautiful, I've been watching this for 5 hours now
Only one word to describe this moment.... Beautiful
Absolute  Legends!!
yes please
Amazing vocals
Kyle--" Lucky I was wearing my sparkly underwear today" 😂
I love how you absolutely rock that cover version with a guitar and a voice that gives huge goosebumps.... And that do stupid things in the video.
Good god jables
Full song version please, you are teasing us too much with these snippets that get us salivating and leaving us hungry for more. You are playing a Wicked Game. 😉
So sexy... so strong... Gods among men!
omg this is so cute!
It’s just a cover!!!!
This is the greatest cover in the world. Not a tribute.
The most beautiful thing i have seen in a while
Majestic
Ville valo would be proud from HIM GOOD TALENT GUYS
What an unique moment! My ears are pleased while my eyes are bleeding! Singing a beautiful song while shaking dongs in the beach is a unique art that only TENACIOUS D is capable of doing with mastery! I love you guys!
Extraordinaires.. comme d'habitude!!! On vous aime les gars ❤
Bowser in his true form!
stunning rendition
This should be center fold of Sports Illustrated
this is so deep!
the video is literally breathtaking
I’m imaging bowser from the Mario movie slinging this
Id really love a full version of this
this is the happiest day of my life
Everyone loves everyone....
So glad that throughout all the success, Jack never left KG behind…true friendship
There next album is gonna be called games
Sounds like Aerosmith a little.
Need a longer version!
they're magestical creatures
Chills...
Please release a full cover of this song.
for free?
Just two dudes on a beach getting there cardio in, LMFAO!
👍🏽
"Nobody Loves No One" I took that personally
Beautiful
Hypnotic.
Beefcake.
fuck yeah guys
The only acceptable D pic that should be sent
Nice to see Cpt. Rex having amazing fun time in his spare time
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the beautiful relationship between these two men? They have been a constant source of joy for me since I first heard them sometime in the 90s and to see them as two, joyous, ball shaped best friends to this day never fails to make me smile. I salute you both Jaybles and Rage Cage
Every few years tenacious d returns to the ocean from whence it came
damn jack hitting them high notes
2 min of happiness... if you don't smile by the end of this video.. seek help ;) (also, I agree that there should be a full cover of this song. Even better if you get Chris Isaac to be in the video questioning the cover without saying anything)
EPIC jiggle physics
Daddy?
YES!
Art
It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.
oh yes Daddy Bears.....
Long live the D
Fantastic. But, why so short?
That lifted my spirits for today. Thank you😊
You both remind me of my friend Matt! He was always a true beacon of joy and god damn i mss him. Rip love you brotha. And love you tenacious  D
I keep thinking we need a Tenacious D cover album, and then Tribute came on and Kyle was saying "aw man you have to do other people's songs" make a cover album and call it Tribute
This is not the greatest video in the world, but it’s a great tribute…
очень смешно :))
Those chords are my fav. Associated with a lot of Celtic and ambient music
the only problem from this song.. is the end
This is on Spotify right?! Wooo
MTV VMA for Tenacious D!!
Make more movies and games guys ❤❤❤❤
JB's singing is awesome
Hey! Love is love is love ❤😂😂
I was just diagnosed with diabetes. ...   I CAN'T HAVE THIS MUCH EYE CANDY !!!    I'm Swooning !!!
Cutest Couple Ever!
You’re version of this does it so much justice!!
Real men also frolic!
Drop the album
🤘🥹❤️
Nice.
This needs to be longer. I prefer this over the original.
um excuse me how do you guys keeping putting out bangers??
Watching these two happy and frolicking is so beautiful.
En efecto 🚬
Beaches beaches beaches!! Beaches!!!
Love it every time I see something from you. And awesome cover! That's my go to shower-time song ^^
That was rad
It's rare you get to see them in the wild like that
Do a Cover Album!! PLEASE!!
In such a simple video, enjoy life. One way or the other
When you do a funny bit and need a music video for a 1 minute tune.  Make the world series JBs nuts sling around
i''t's just 2 lords on the beach!
OH MY GOD
This is what living your best life looks like. Beautiful.
I'm fat too but I still love JB :)
They have risen again like the Fenix!
kyle indeed has a TENACIOUS D
Raiden from Fatal Fury
Eat your Heart Shaped World out, Isaak!
🤣...this is hilariously disgusting!
I believe I have evolved beyond myself in the 1 minute and 49 seconds I dedicated to view this masterwork of cinema.
I can only picture Bowser singing this to Peach.
Such a good song 👍 I love Tenacious D . JB and Jack are my favorite bros
JB is a beast! I've never felt this song at all... till the day I heard him singing it. Such power and feeling. I love this man
Weve gone from video games to wicked games.
Holy shit Jack doing HIM covers is something I never thought of or expected. And I fell in love <3
How in the heck does jack suddenly look 10 years younger alluh sudden???
They're such happy! It's majestic song
Bowser voice. Chubby BOIS.
Men.
I need some white bejeweled battle shorts like those.
This is awesome!. Jack's voice are amazing 🙂
The D rocks.
JACK BLACK YOUR BEAUTIFUL SON OF A GUN. Your voice is simply angelic! Please please please do a full cover!!!
Pure beauty.
distraction, a tactic used since mankind learnt to walk
1:03 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒
they made the funny video game song
That voice is glorious
Looks like y’all are getting ready for a double team supreme! And, did i see a slip of KGs package…I think my life is now complete… much love Jack and Kyle
The prophesy is true!!!! They will rise again!
Who would have thought you would find two Unicorns froliking on the beach?
Master Piece
Why do I love this so much.. Its pure bliss!
This is such a beautiful song, made by a beautiful man, covered by beautiful men.
Better than original 🤔
2023 and the boys are still going strong
Thats a whole lotta man...🤣
Those tidy whities were almost 😳... goodness 😂
Remembering the original video I have a very, VERY confused boner right now. Awesome music, by the way!
Fucking masterpeice
Anyone else hear Bowser singing this to peach now.....😂
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA NOOOOOOOOO
Fucking love these guys!
pure love
Beautiful
When you look up brotherhood in the dictionary, this video is playing
How fun to see santa clause take a swim :-)
I Swear.. I wished for exactly that Yesterday evening... Thanks❤
Stupid question: is Kyle wearing bubble wrap?
Magnificent bastards. You just saved me. literally ^^
❤
This is beautiful
I wish jack black was real 😔
hilarious :D
KG has a mean one in those undies
This just straight up sounds like bowser.
Dos grandes leyendas ❤
Please please pleaseeee could you guys please sing the whole songggggggggggggg pleaseeeee
Beast ever !
Thx Jack B n Kyle for the best Bay Watch ⌚ intro ever 😁😁😁🥥🍍☔🌈
I love how they are happy with themselves and break the rules, how the media and movies think they want to impose on us what a perfect person should look like. Everyone is perfect the way they are. That's what I love these guys so much for. You learn to accept yourself and not worry too much about what others think about you. That's so important for mental health.
Why Not the whole song…would be awesome 🎸
Rage kage is packing bruh
I mean I dunno what I just saw but Tenacious D always delivers lol
Next week berlin 🥳
Tenaissance D
But we need more jablinski content!
Very harotic.
Wow. That was better than any cover had any right to be.
I present to you, the perfect male form.
The world needed this.
I definitely wasn’t looking at their tenacious D’s
When Santa takes his favorite elf on vacation.
The grin on their faces. If more people had that and just enjoyed life rather than hate and control what others were doing. The world would rarely feel sadness.
If ever an art professor again asks me to define art, I will simply provide the URL to this video
I was in my kitchen the other day and thinking "what's up with tenacious d? They are great." And then this happens? Crazy coincidence.
No 4k option is my only complaint about this video
PLAY THIS 14th of JUNE IN AHOY THE NETHERLANDS< WE NEED THIS.
just some guys havin fun on the beach
The song dissonance with the video is so good. The song is so good. wtf this is good
Kyle’s packing 😆😂
Follcking in the summer time.
A+ for the audio. F for the blatant pandering.
for a second watching them run on the shoreline it looked like a green screen because at least kg was doing like a scooby doo run, and it was trippy as hell
The voice on this mf i tell you
I too like mushrooms, running on the beach, and Wicked Games.
Disgusting worship of obesity and poor health—REJECT AT ALL COSTS this pathetic display of the reddit numale.
For a second I thought this was a cover of the Dwarf Fortress theme.. Which granted, it is a wicked game.
Is this beach at Saint Augustine?
Tides gone out a bit gentlemen? I look forward to the full version 😊
I need tenaciusss d twooooo
Aged men. We look good. But our bodies are shit.
I woke up to a break up with à friend sending this to me and he didn't even know ❤
They truelly are the greatest and best band in the world
I know they're married, at least, Jack is... but still I freaking ship them, lol.
10 out of 10!
Beautiful.. 🥲
Only perfection
So very beautiful 😻😻😻
“Nobody loves no one” is one of the best lines of all time haha
Daaamn i didnt knew youtube allowed such sexyness
NGL, Kyle should have grown that beard long ago
All I can hear is David Attenborough in the background saying "here we see two wild animals in their natural habitat"... Friggin' love you guys man, just awesome
Now I can’t live without hearing the full version
They are on a role
Love You guys so much <3
please make an album!
1:18 The most powerful and life-changing 30 seconds of eye contact
My wedding song! Done by my favourite band of all time.
Argh why is it the same length as the SXM version? I saw this and thought YES They finally released the full version! But nooooooo it's just the same short version ;_;
I'm just gonna say it, Kyle is packing.
Old man junk in wet tighty whiteys is just the right touch for this track I think. Thanks for making my Friday.  Please be heart healthy, we want many more years of you two.
My eyes didn't stop looking at KGs chode. I couldn't even blink
Nothing like seeing two rare albino gorillas enjoying the sea side.
MASTERPIECE
brought a tear to my eye
Dude i totally miss you
LETS GO BOYS THE EPITOME OF MANHOOD RIGHT HERE
Dang Kyle is packing 😂
How am I as a man supposed to even come close to this level of masculine perfection?
Tribute!
Those thangs be thanging, gawd damn
With Chew
This is the Tenacious D we need. Two guys. Two guitars. Nothing else.
Oh man, I love the original, but this is the icing on the cake! 😁😆
Yo quiero ver tenacius d en ARGENTINA  el mejor publico del mundo ❤
Beautiful
Jack is naked..it's all body hair
God I'm hard as hell
So good I forgot it was a cover at first xD
Beautiful
Pqp a voz do jack ta muito boa meu Deus. LENDAS
holy shit i love this song i discovered it like 2 weeks ago and now the D made a cover ?!
Jesus Christ lol
I miss so much an album like rize of the fenix
Purest loving of life! Beautiful!
This made me realize KG is packing, either a massive sack or, a massive schlong
This is taking me back to that first album again, dudes. I was like ten, and loved the music videos to Tribute and Wonderboy so much that I convinced my mom to get me the album. We listened to it on the ride home from the store, and even though she was shocked by the lyrics, neither of us could stop laughing so she let me keep it. She's no longer with us, but the D will always hold a special place in my heart for that memory of us bonding over our shared sense of humor. I'm super excited to see you guys back at it and am loving all the videos to accompany them. You guys have always, and will always rock 🤘
sorry Jack, my comments aren't directed at you but at any commenters who may have sent hate lizzo's way because she's getting so much hate because of her weight. Maybe people think twice when they're forced to confront their views when similar language is directed at you, their favourite artist. I'm really really so sorry.
omg!
What A wicked Thing to do, You look like whinnie the poo (great cover)
Even though I anticipated a longer version, this is amazing.
Please do a full album of doing covers.. You guys are giving me goosebumps.
Like two unicorns in the wild.
You have no idea how hard I've been searching for this on spotify
Am I the only one who feels they are running but not advancing?
This is amazing! To give it my full attention I had to mute the music though.
1:43 sequin speedos!
If ever this band were to make a comeback would be now or here soon.
HOLY SHIT HOW DID THEY PERFECT THIS SONG??!
This is pure! I love it ! Thank you Tenacious D
When we reach the pearly gates, this is what we’ll see as we peek inside. Beautiful lol
PLS DO 4 MIN SONG 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This needs to immediately be added to the Library of Congress as a vital cultural artifact.
Those smiles bore deep into my soul.
I need the full version guys!!
Man, I love these two, just nofux given and awesome music. You lads are my freaking spirit animals.
Really do need more of his voice though.
Majestic, a masterpiece, who would have thought that Karl Marx and a homeless man would create such a work of art together?
More Ballads pleeeeeeeeeeease. Yall are beautiful
This is absolutely wonderful
Devil sellouts
Dammit! Do the full version you bastards.
Just look at them, unfettered by the chains of keto and body sculpting.
We NEED a full ver of this master piece
Nothing brings me joy like these two and thanks to everyone involved in thier projects past present and future!
The D know how to use YouTube properly, they have the pre saves, they have shorts promoting, they keep it personal and casual instead of corporate, this is why they are still the goat 🐐
Ну по идее теперь нужно потребовать десятичасовую версию...
Soo good! ❤❤❤
oriááási
Wtf did I just watch
Full version is needed!!!
Kyle has to be one of the cleanest guitar players on earth.
This shit is hot as fuck!!!
Omg, yes yes yes yes yes
Epic!
Amazing
Love the D
Dude, Kyle's guitar is just on point!
It doesn't surprise me they would get  1 million views in one day. I love  tenacious d. Soooo much talent!!
sounds great
This makes me happy!
Perfection 👌
I forgot how amazing this song was, those lyrics are absolutely beautiful. I listened to this too many times. Jack's voice is just as magical as Isaak's. Thanks for sharing.
poethic
Ohh god, two fat guys running on a beach, and it's cool
thats what I call a beach bod. People ask me why I'm eating a whole pizza in one sitting and I tell them I'm working on my beach bod.
If this ain't peak masculinity then I don't know what is..
I need to go to a concert asap
The camera work could be a litlle better... Love it regardless!
Thankyou for this beautiful song❤
Jesus Christ, I love these 2
One of the best bromances in history
Big Mac Heart Attack
Gotta respect that space. Nice jobs D’S
it's beautiful, I watch it for 5 hours
Alomst hypnotic. Like a lava lamp.
What they don’t tell you is that this video is actually sped up
Beautiful majestic even
Yessss I’ve been looking for a studio version of this cover
A tear in my eye so beautiful
Ugh, I just barfed on my puke. 😂
This has to be a nomination for the best YouTube vid in 2023 😂
So good
I Membah when Tenacious D was in BioDome
Two of the sexiest men out there today! ❤
The smiling 😂😂
FULL SONG
Wicked gets a whole new meaning and dimension... well have a dive 😅
We are Blessed to have you!
Cant stop listening to this! 😎😎
Thank you Jack I needed this.
Now I truly understand the beauty of the male body. Thanks D!
I've shed a tear 🥲
nobody loves no-one................ means everybody loves someone............... if my grade eight math is correct.
True happiness
This is beautiful.
What the hell is jackblack doing in his spare time…
Back here again I just love seeing these two together ❤
These are the two most attractive men that there are
This is the second greatest song in the world
Is this going to be some kind of concept album with song-titles having the word „game“ in it? 😅
Pretty sure Brutal Legend was the unofficial Tenacious D Game, but I'll defiantly support my boy JB From beginning to End! Keep Rocking and Take my Money!
MOAR PLZ
I was just telling my friends how awesome it would be if Tenacious D made a new movie before KG and JB are too old, please guys, we need more Tenacious D lore and more of these beautiful men and their rock
I know where they got their name now, big ole D.
Where is The pick of destiny part 2 that was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life some days I just really wish that there was a second one 😢
Jack black you gotta do an extended version man, this was amazing
Love it... just surprised there wasn't more with all the promotion.
Amazing! I'd love a full length version of this so I can have them play it at my funeral 😂. JB has a perfect voice for this
Awesome
Ur boy gas is packing
Why?
Majestic creatures.💙
Love it! Proof you don't need a super expensive video
Wow do they really have big D or did they put something in there?
I will never attempt this song in karaoke ever again. This was incredible. Wish it was longer 😢
Não sabia que precisava de um cover do tenacious D de wicked game até ouvir o cover do tenacious D de wicked game
Happy pride
Would’ve been nice if they recorded an actual version (not taken from the one instance I’ve seen him sing ‘Wicked Game’ live. Sorry, I love Tenac, but it’s constant rehash stuff. And then there’s the kid doing short “covers” or “mocks” of your old content. Jack once said he’s all about rock and roll; all I see now is  a Disney logo
I am almost 100% sure JB sold his soul to the devil for that fucking angelic voice
made me temporarily forget my tinitus, even for just a few moments, thank you
Boys, I know funny and ridiculous is your energy and we all love you for it... but we need more tracks like this.
Dear Jack Black and Kyle Gass,  here is a fan-desired album design.  'Tenacious-D Day' A pair of brothers search the attic of their parents' house, where they come across old music one after another. For hits from the 80s and 90s. -Kiss from the rose, -Lose yourself,- Bad/Billie Jean, Like a prayer etc. So go ahead, it will suit us in a year.
just boys being dudes
This song needs a extended version
Such Joy!!!
Can i join in looks fun 👍
LOOK AT THOSE BULLS 🤟
Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches
Kyle gass is hogged up      Nice
I'm immeasurably happy that they're still making music and comedy together.
We need a full version of this.
My man's packing
See you guys on tuesday!
Love the Message :) , what two beautiful human beings
I bought tickets to see you guys at the Cain’s Ballroom, but the tickets never showed! I’m so glad you guys are still making music. Keep on fuckin’ rocking out!!
Who’s the old guy
KG’s junk is huge bro
You son of a bitch, I'm in
;-:
I want to be like them when I grow up ❤
Those look like some guys that at least do one cock push-up each.
please do full length of this cover!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is amazing
I subscribed purely to hear the full cover of this song! Please make it happen!
I came watching this with my family.
The running from about 0:10 to 0:20 is a perfect moonwalk! Love this version
I love it!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂❤
we will sing songs and tell tales of tenacious d, for generations to come
Its crazy how these two guys have been bandmates and best friends making goofy shit like this for a long time and you can just tell, that these two men just have all the love for each other. Its frickin pretty awesome
banger
Кайфуха какая) Мужики просто красавчики, респектую) Ну и ору конечно)))
Only one word comes to mind - GLORIOUS
These guys have to stick around forever. Please have a salad instead once in awhile :D
So sad I could not see them perform when their show at Stanford got postponed and relocated😢 they are fabulous artists.
They are just living their best lives.  Haha
Admit it, we’ll never be as cool as tenacious d
We still want the FULL SONG
Man, people are such assholes nowadays...I used to remember when people were kind and used to push the beached whales back into the sea...
Like 2 brothers doing stupid stuff
Nuh uh
I've loved you boys since I was  like 12 and I always will
I guess they spent all their video money on Video Games 🤭
Masterpiece! Love the tribute to Chris Isaak´s music video.
Despite seeing JB and KG in the video... I can only see Bowser in my head singing this.
Okay Jack's voice is PERFECT for this song, holy fuck I need a full version of this when the album drops 😂
Amazing  voice  again
Perfection.
lmao
Waiting for this
How, why now brown cow, the beauty, the mystic, glorious bastards be free. Run as fat as your heart will take you, find your peace.
one million views in 24 hours
Hilarious  I was giggling for the entire minute and a half
I love you Tenacious D 🥹  I hope I don’t die alone ❤
They keep getting hotter.
chef's kiss! perfection!
Wow the voice it was so deep 😆✨🌊
🤘😍🤘
For a bit it looked liked they was running in one spot
YES
If you watch the Beatles medley video and this back to back it’s like one long music video
This is FANTASTIC I love it SO MUCH.
This world isn't good enough for you magical gentlemen
At least he dyin a bunch of times in this song
Would love to see jack and kyle but the concerts are fucking expansive. Never saw such high prices for a concert
Какие они счастливые. Совет да любовь.
Full. Length. Cover. Please!

From far away I thought he was looking at me but the closer he got I realized it was someone else… the wicked game comes from within *mind blowskies haha
beautiful. just what the world needed. long live the D!
Absolutely beautiful 😢
Rarely does the world see a love this beautiful
STEPHANIE SEYMOUR WAS OVERRATED. SEXY BASTARDS 🤙🏴‍☠️🥃🎩
c'est pas la musique que l'on retrouve dans la série Lucifer?
i love these guys and im so glad they're still doing this
Incredible
They make it short on purpose, so as to gain spotify auditions on repetition )
Why is Whitey from Eight Crazy Nights running around with Jack Black? Also I love this!~
Master piece. Every. Second.
pleaseee do full versiooon of the songgg, that sounds crazyyyy
epic!!
Whole lot of jiggling
ehm .. album pls!
this made me curious for a cover of the sound of silence  :P
Thought Kyle was wearing whitey tighties the whole and I was so worried what was going to happen when they got wet.
Soo happy
Best bromance in history
Waiting for all the Mandela Effect comments to start rolling in now...
amazing but too short 😭😭
Something so magical about a duo of old men running around in the watur while some sick ass guitar plays
PLEASE PLEASE DO A FULL VERSION! I WOULD PAY FOR IT.
Gran canción para un gran guitarrista y una gran voz, los pelos de punta. El video ya es otro tema 😂
WHAT A MEN
I’m so stoked! I love tenacious D!
Jack Black and Kyle Gass. These two are the embodiment of being in touch with your inner child.
It's such a shame that the song is so short because they were not able to run any longer than this...
Jesus christ this is actually a beautiful song
Forget Arbys, Kyles packing the MEAT.
Now 'Father Figure' plz
I am stunned. I am speechless. I am taken aback even. I believe this is what heaven sounds like.
Jack running into the wave creates wings over Kyle.
Like two majestic aquatic hippos frolicking  in the waves of passion
We need MORE
This is beautiful. Also Jack's voice gets better year after year, it is amazing
This is the most iconic video
Do Kiss From A Rose next!
NAH BRO THE VIDEOCLIP AND THE MUSIC ARE SO FIRE❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
He sounds like a low pitch Cher
I've never seen 2 men who are so morbidly obese yet so at the peak of human fitness in my life.
absolute perfection! 😂
This is the only thing I’m living for this summer
AAAHHhhHhhhhhHHHHHhhhhh
Tenacious D converting this song is something I never thought I’d see but god am I happy they did
No wonder Chris Isaak made a cover of this song. Just flawless.
This something that I can't even describe. Word "masterpiece" doesn't tell enough.
Yes.
This is a gift to the eyes and the ears, please make a full version of this, it is such an masterpiece!!
CLASSIC!!!!!
Friends will be friends, their running naked in the sand.
Well that was an easy wank
Bowser and his grandpa looking for Peach at the beach, 2023, colourized
I'm mesmerized on their feet at the first part like they're not moving at all.
This is totally awesome! ❤
Beautiful…😢
Happy Pride Y'all!!!!
ur chilling on the beach and u see these two wyd
im not ashamed to say i cried
So much love, so much fun ! ❤
Oh my.
i fucking love this🤣🤣
Not even a whole day and almost 1 million views. Simply a great channel
Oh man, it's gonna take me the rest of my life to get into the peak physical condition of these two Adonises! Two statues of Davis running around right there!
You sir are a treasure. God bless you.
Why tf did I see a bulge on Jack’s suit I need bleach!!
I am not sure I appreciate them following the general trend of sexualizing their bodies to sell their music. It's like a generic suggestive video now from the likes of Nicki MinaJ or Cardi B - you can't really tell its Tenacious D.
No notes. Perfection.
KG is PACKING
Best cover ever!
After all these years… I finally understand this song thank you
for f==ks sake ......
Cracking set of balls on Rage Cage
MORE! LONGER! MORE!
JB's voice is great, KG's acoustic tone is nice, yet the song is really mid and doesn't fit them at all. So, meh...
Finally omg
Rocks!
It's incredible that something so moving and beautiful can be paired with something so silly and absurd. Oh well, hopefully some day their music will catch up to their grace in motion.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😵💀🪦👻
i love HIM!
Full cover, please! This was absolutely majestic.
This is the wallpaper that I didn't know I needed!
Things I didn’t know I needed for $200 Alex.
Going to stay up late this Christmas eve again in the hope I can catch KG doing his rounds
We need a full cover, this is just awesome 🤘
AHHHHHH I love the recreation of the iconic Chris Isaak video. I hope he sees this.
Please cover Atomic Kitten - Whole Again, next.
Very disgusting when you see old man shaking body run n on the beach 😅😂😂😅😂
Me why did I click this... Oh he sing yeah that's totally why I clicked on it not because of him in his undies!
Hail the boognish and praise the D
We need the full version!!! LOVED THIS!! 🥰
here before it blows up
Awesome
JB and KG are men of such pristine character. They will live within our bosoms forever.
sweethearts
I wish jack black was my dad...
WE NEED A FULL LENGTH COVER!!!
TENACIOUS DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I must have missed it, what cologne were they selling?
we need a full length cover of this; it's so beautiful
hahaha so good! Another masterpiece from the masters themselves. :)
Poetry in motion
He does not need a MICROPHONE!
just two odl dudes having fun. Eh, what a good times
The world needs a full length cover of this.  You can't give us just the tip.  We want the full length of the D. . . What?  Oh come on, you were all thinking it!
I can‘t... with these guys... 🤣
I love this so much
I can't get over jbs face at the end coming from behind kg
Ive had this on loop for over 4 hours now. Majestic.
goats
I'm glad that these two are frolicking together, even after all these years.🙂
Wow when the video clip in no way matches this hauntingly beautiful  rendition .... love it
This is a flop, but not for the reasons you might think...
I don't wanna fall in love, I'm still in. And always will be.... Sorry to miss you guys again at Rock am Ring, please, give me another chance❤
When I thought I couldn't love them more, they prove me wrong
The only men I’d truly trust alone with my drink at a party. Love these guys
The only flaw is its not 30 mins
😄
The elastic in Kyle’s y-fronts for MVP 🏆
+Daddy, Why is my sister called Rose? -Because your mother loves Roses +Thanks Daddy! -Your welcome Tenacious D´s cover of Wicked Game!
Halloween request Anything Can Happen on Halloween by Tim Curry
Lol
Just one word... AWESOME!
I love how after all these years. These two still remain best friends. From humble beginnings to Rockstars!!!
Now I want a full version.  I love this!
Splendid 👽
Dude classic,. Number one on my chart. 😂👍
They look so happy in the video
Best Love Story Ever ❤😂
Jacks voice is utterly awesome 👌
Love you guys from Brazil! 🇧🇷
Eu amo esses caras!!!!
They are so majestic
As long as there is a record deal...
i can't think of a better cover version of this song.
Yeaah 🤘👍🙌😁
Keep on going my dudes! Love all the songs you guys produce! <3
This is amazing! Great job guys!!!❤
Damn...Jack Black is an amazing singer....would love to see an entire album of cover songs....
Life changing
The greatest love story ever told
Masterpiece!!
Such a beautiful rendition; production; clip; emotion & expression... ❤  Only two of the greatest men of all time can amass 1,000,000 views overnight while wearing next to nothing running alongside a beach together in slow moshé on a YouTube video in 2023 😮😢
Package received ☑
This has always been a great song
How can you not make a full length cover? This is awesome!
This is art! Send it to space!
Not sure Humankind is worthy of such magnificence... Given the aspect ratio, I believe this is meant to be appreciated in theater.
I wish the vocal processing was a little less. Jack's raw vocals sound so much... more exciting with very tasteful or no pitch correction.. to my ears anyways. Either way Im pumped to hear something new out of Tenacious D! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cascading layers of art splashing my brain like waves.
I got a shiver
kiss!
One thing no one thought about was THE D WOULD RISE AGAIN!!
Just beautiful!
WE NEED THE FULL LENGTH VERSION
Excellent!
This made me call up my best friend 🥲❤️
If your the D, then I guess we are D's nuts!! Fans forever. Jables and Rage KAGE forever!!
I can only say thank you VERY much. I've needed to see that for decades ❤❤❤
PLEASE do the whole thing, boys!!! Pure joy.
:-*
sAW YALL AT THE COCACOLA CENTER IN oKLAHOMA MANY YEARS AGO...SORRY i FLIPPED YOU OFF.
Bless you glorious mofos ♥
Two best friends doing what they do best for such a long time is a beautiful thing. Rock on.
Long live the D!!!
This is what a perfect cover sounds like
You don't wanna make the D hurting modaffakka
Rocky and Apollo!
My mother is a huge Chris issac fan at one show she payed extra to be in the front row. He came out on stage and kicked all the beers on the edge of the stage all into the crowd.
Oh hell yeah
Perfection.
Whatching this made me really uncomfortable. I think im gay now
it was bombeooooo!
Like a fine wine they only get better the older they get!
wife walked in and i couldnt explain what she saw but she told me to repeat it...
You guys should think about tackling the spice gauntlet again 😈😈😈 I’m challenging you guys!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watching this is like the feeling of running in a dream
The amount of feeling in this clip... Happiness, gratitude, friendship, love and the fleeting time that cannot change these two.
are they back at making songs I hope so
Other bands: -Need insane effects -2 dozen people strong Makeup crew -expensive constumes  Tenacious D: -Underwear -Bathing suit (optional)  And Tenacious D is still better then all of them
I was hoping for some „No IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-shnippoodily-hoodily-ayayaaa don’t wanna fall I love, shababang shababadoo…“
KG is PACKING
GOD DAMN THESE ARE TOO SHORT
Majestic
Yes.
The only celebrities actually good at YouTube
Ladies if you think this is sexy, hit me up.
more please
They look so happy ❤😂
Everything is better in this world, as long as the D is around
Admiro esos chicos en realidad hacen lo que quieren sin miedo a nada
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah! 🤘🏴‍☠️
Long live the D!
Love you guys.
I want to be like you when I grow up... oh f... we're the same age
Jacks Voice insane good.
I love them both so much 🥹🥹
More of a wicked speed round, but it still honestly glassed my eyes and lumped my throat. Thanky, gentlemen!
more
alright, alright, alright
Got this replaying all day. Wish it was the full version! Love this so much.
I always thought this song was hauntingly pretty back when I first heard it in 91. But you guy's brought it to a whole other level. ❤❤❤❤ Good work 👏🎉😊  I hope you guys cover more songs that we would never expect!!
Little did I know that what I needed today was this cover with a video of two rippling (bouncing?) male paunches. Beautiful cover and the rippling paunches (and the wonderful, genuine smiles) are in all earnest very perfectly soothing to watch. What a delightful breath of fresh air amidst the fake, plastic, unreal, unnatural bodies with equally fake smiles. I really love those majestic paunches and smiles of yours, guys! Great music, great video! Thanks and lots of love! 🥰
Literally could not take my eyes off their bouncy junk.
Wow. I wonder if Chris Issak has seen this video lol. Not going to say much but if you were a teenage boy when the original video for the song came out this is ten times funnier. Not sure which video is sexier lol. And if you haven’t seen the original video go watch it now.
🤘🏽😔🤘🏽
WEEE NEEEDDD A FULL VERSION
I wish I could look that majestic
The video of the year dropped on June 1st
Long live the D
Just Beautiful! =)
Short and so powerful. Says so much using so little.
This is art in its purist form 💯👌
This is not Wicked Game, this is just a tribute
Thank the Lord! More D! Side note on smart less Arnett talks about poker games they used to have with Jack and Kyle in the early days of their career. I'd listen to/ watch a 2 hour podcast of them playing poker and shooting the shit for sure!
This must've been the most majestic thing I've ever seen
I'm not sure the world is ready for this
Love it! Beautiful!
Jesus and now I need to explain my GF why I was watching this and smiling
EPIC
Bike thiefs has an awesome cover of this for those interested 😍 very raw sound
Please do a full version!!! Nailed it!!!
Fmd I love this way too much.
Almir Sater 🔥🔥
Too late. I've already fallen in love. Once in 2009, and the second time when I saw this video.
Such a wicked song cover. Wickedly sick, wickedly, Tenacious D.
Kyle packing heat
KG is such a majestic, beautiful, big bearded baby!
On repeat. Not enough. Again. Not enough. *W*E*    *N*E*E*D*   *M*O*R*E* !!!
Talk about a celebration for 1M subs! 😂
💀
I don't know how to describe perfect but this is it anyway
These guys make me SO happy!! I hope you can both be as happy as what you gift us all with!!❤🖤
Damn man, that makes me feel. Beautiful.  Never particularly cared for Isaac when I was younger, but this, this makes me wanna revisit.
Never stop being Tenacious.
Please consider a full cover, to all songs.
Man I need a longer version of this cover. I honestly like it more that the original.
Well now i want a cover of HIM's cover...vidya be a bonus💫🧚‍♀️
How do you guys stay in peak physical rock shape? Simple beautiful
Hey, those are the guys who fought Dave grohl!
Bastards I wanted full song lol..... making me choose this cover over the HIM one how could they play with my heart like this
This recording is not as good as the first
Chills...all i got to say
Why did I spend the entire video staring at Kyle's junk?
'Witchu' !!
That's a double negative...
Tenacious D another contribution to the narrative of our times. Whatever. Hilarious.🤣🤣🤣
Красавцы, ахуэнна!
I'm so glad, they found eachother.
I want to see a jb / valo duet
I like how they're both exactly as fat as each other these days.
for free?!?
Damn Kyle, he really got the D lol
Look at their happiness 😊
Never have I been so aroused
LOL
Yin and Yang 0:42
There is so much love in this video, literally. <3
Kyle's fingers be silver. And jacks voice then be gold.
Moving and funny at the same time, the power of the D.
kg got big bawls
You know the best thing about this video is how happy you both look. It made me smile as well. xx
I know what I'm going to be butchering next time i sing karaoke.
I love that this song is genuallu amazing, but the video is just those two playing on the beach in slo mo wearing skimpy outfits
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Pure perfection! Brought a tear to my eye 🥹
Moar plz
Jack Black Jablinski J-Biggles J-Wiggles  My eyes can't unsee....
This better not awaken anything in me
Briljant!
These guys used to be young once :(
Please give us a full cover!
Truly beautiful!
Perfection
You can cry and shout, but this is what peak masculinity looks like.
that was amazing . thank you guys for still rocking !!
We need „Kiss from a rose „!   Jack,please finish your fucking songs man 😂😂😂🙌🏽!
wait isn't the video all cgi?
Criminally too short, masterfully done men.🤘🏼🔥❤️
0:49 JB hits the wave and creates water wings for D.
Thats just pure joy of life right there.....we should all focus more on how things feel  instead of how we look. just get stuck in!!!!
This restarted my p*rn-addiction. Also we need a full Album with cover songs, "Kissed by a Rose" from Jack Black is still fire
Why ... why just 1:49 ... I have been playing the SiriusXM live version every day for 6 months now and you give me another 1:49 !? I want more ... I need more! Please give us... give me the full version. Please.
Genious
I was just showing my gf all my favorites from your discography. Thanks for almost 20 years of enjoyment
icanseehisjunkicanseehisjunkicanseehisjunkicanseehisjunkicanseehisjunkicanseehisjunk
Please do a full lenght cover, this is so beautiful
If everyone had a best friend like you dudes do the world would be an amazing peaceful kickass place! LOL RAWK!
Only tenacious D can make it sound great!!!!!
If i ever get married this video will be playing when kiss the bride lmao
This is the year for Tenacious D!
Full cover please!
I'm grateful for living in the Golden Age of Jack Black and Kyle G
<3
Two banger songs that have the word “Game” on it, what a coincidence!
Why didn't ye recover a full lenght version, for fucks sake lads!
1:02 ... shivers
That is a serious bromance
Uhm......what I'm seeing
Thank you so much.
Still the best cover of this track. Seriously needs a full length version.
I feel like this song shouldn't go along with any sort of "comedic relief", but that's just me.
they are both main character and you cant convince me otherwise !!
I need the full track released stat
a feature that i missed until  the very end. Kyles pants are sparkly...
May we have a jock strap only version?
I think this is one of my new favourite covers
Dang, that D is Tenacious.😉
PLEASE FULL THING GET YAH BOIII CHRISSY TO LET YOU DO THIS SHIT. GET THAT SHIT OUT THERE PRONTO! Fuckin puts it on the spotifys PUT IT ON THE YOUTUBES AND MAKE A HIT COVER SONG OF THE FUCKING DECADE!!!!!!!!!
Moooooooooore!
Such a creative use of the cameras ability to convey a narrative dissonance, between the mellow tones and the cheer full scene. Only art this great can be accomplished by the people who are striving to do their best, and have a great time doing it.
STOP MAKING GOOD CATCHY SONGS
Obey the D 😂
He did the bendy every once in a while!!
Love JB and KG so much ❤
This belongs to All times FAVORITES!
The D makes me happy and smiling even in dark times
Mesmerizing.
That sucked more then it had to GUYS COMEON
ok its funny :) and i see that you happy :) but please my nephew also fallow you on YT and he is 15 :D
Soooo gooood
OMG 😂 Chris Isaak cover ❤
Can't wait to see them 14th of June!
OMG how do I unsee this?!
Ya cool jack black and underwear but honestly this was pretty bad
would
Bro Jack them goofy overall pants
best video ever
Jesus my eyes! Love these guys.
KG either has a bigger package, or an afro. 🤣 But, I mean it was cold right?
Ear bliss ❤
It's beautiful.....
Awesome.
This was filmed in regular speed. They are just that powerful.
I'll always love these two, freaking hilarious duo.. 😂🤘🧔👴🤘
Jables voice has aged like a fine wine
Just wish they did a full 4 minute version other than that I love it
I have never before felt so strongly that life's pretty good
For a second it looked like Kyle was sliding. I guess I’ve working on gamedev for too long!
Love this song
Which season of The mandalorian is this?
The real two pilars of rock
you boys are so much fun
1min50? Only? This masterpiece need the full cover!
But I love YOU ❤ You brighten the world, thank you 😘
*head explodes*
Epic 🫠
This is outstanding. Beautiful vocals. Thought the song would be funny! LOL!
I don’t know whether to laugh or cry 😢
I only hate 1 single thing about this. That its too darn short.
stories have been told here. Last of us take notes!!!
what a story. A day of frolicking on the beach quickly turns deadly as kyle and jack are about to be pulled out to sea, but after vigorously fighting for their lives, at last they manage to return to shore and safety. Tenacious D truly cant be taken down, not even by the savage forces of nature!
This was so fucking unexpected, and I love it.
So good to see those majestic creatures in their natural habitat!
This is so beautiful, I love you two 😭
art
When will they come to Portugal? Big 4 and all but the D would be a lifetime experience to me and loved ones. Cmon... Pretty please?!
Jables and Kage 🖤
absolute damn legends
These two beautiful men always manage to touch my soul like no other!
Never knew i needed this 😂🎉
My eyes bleed but my ears are in Heaven.
Now thats how you make a music video
I really need a body like theirs
Steamy!!!!
Not as good as Chris Isaac's version, but this is pretty dope.
Jack blacks vocals are so good
someone make 10hour loop... it's way to short, beautiful!
I love how people in comments think that this is a love song and that Jack is singing about a woman,but he actually sings about games or a specific game.It's because gaming is love the only love!
Their sexiness will not ruin this gem of a rendition.
This is beautiful ive watched this 10 times now.
👋..muy emotivo...!
NSFW (L)
We need a FUCKING FULL VERSION OMG
Why does the song end so soon.  Wish this was a 10 min long song
Full length version please. This is majestic!
I'm a man of simple needs: I See "The D" and I am Happy! <3
"Kyle's fingers be silver. Jack's voice then be gold. " cit.
I don't care if it's two dudes with their junks flapping around frolicking intensively in the sea. I loved every second of it.
Everyone always talks about the D's music chops but no one ever talks about how they were able to a write a song and then send it back in time for Chris Isaak to record a slightly less iconic cover.
Everybody needed that.
but this already existed xD
love yous
I have no words.  This hit my heart too hard.  JB, KG, thank y'all for everything that you've done, the impact you've had on my life is actually kind of ridiculous, now that I think about it.  Ha! Fluff that! I'm a frikken rockstar thanks to y'all!
damn... bowser really can sing
This is so good but its so short???? Wake me up when there's a full 5 minute version
I'll let this world break my heart as long as Jack Black sings it to me
Jack and jb are legends man
Yes - thats it 😂
Absolutely beautiful!
🙌🏽🫶🏽❤️‍🔥
Ironman Hawaii is waiting! No 0ne can stop you both
you two really are angles sends from above
beautiful
Can someone please green screen them running around in Diablo 4 XD
Best video I have seen this year
Gorgeous rendition two kings!
Watching this in slow motion is definitely a wicked game.
Hot
such joy
We needed this ever since the SiriusXM cover. The planet thanks you, Tenacious D.
Chills.....
I’m just loving that acoustic guitar rift man! With Jack’s deeper vocals paired with the guitar makes it all the better 👌😌👌 Then you got them running on the beach as the icing on the cake😂😂
The D can do no wrong!! Long live the D!
i love that you have released a video to the cover you did and released it to be listented to on apps but i still need a full cover please and thank you my lord
This is the freedom i yearn for
Probably the greatest song in the world.
Can we get a Tenacios D cover of Hemmorage - Fuel??
You should have kissed
Where is the full version of this song. I need it right now.
Shout out to Chris Isaac for inspiring thos masterpiece of a video
😂😍❤️
Bloody hell fellas, what an amazing piece.  We need an 8 minute version!
PLEASE put it on 2x playback I promise it's so good you won't regret it
JB: “I’ve got an idea for the video… KG: “Wait, what?” JB: “Trust me Kage, it’s the only way….”
This song has been on my daily playlist since these legends released it.   But the video? Hilarious. Almost as if they are mocking everyone else
What a moving love song, and what a lovely gay couple! 😃
Rick Rubin looks so happy
I love this song
Two Angels ❤❤
when are you touring in Seattle, the beauty and complexity of this song is unreal
It's crazy how much I see my dad in Jack Black, they seriously could be twins. R.I.P. pops. ❤
The legends are back ❤
I don't know how to feel about this. Such an amazing cover, but frownable Videomaterial. This is tenacious D alright. 😅
Hot damn, Cage be PACKIN HEAT!
Such a lovely gay bear couple 😆
Anybody notice how this song is suddenly everywhere now?
So mimalistic yet so brilliant! 🥰
i strive to have this kind of friendship one day
Sentimental Bowser
Glorious
Just two lads at the beach being lads!
Na-ah! Too damn short fellarinos! We needs the whole jam!
He doesn’t play video games, he plays life like it’s an actual video game
I can’t unsee that. Props to whomever decided to run it in slow motion. Hysterical!!!
Our homie in the white is packing
МОЖНО ЗАКРЫВАТЬ ИНТЕРНЕТ. ЛУЧШЕ УЖЕ НЕ БУДЕТ
You guys are my favourite cryptids
jack"s voice lends itself to a nice mellow song like this and is just awesome
Lads, you are pure gems.
Excellent 👍 2023 awesome pick of destiny
Peak male performance
Go the boys making my heart smile with your joy.
Beautiful
Please, please do a full length version!
Hockey misses ya butts
this was even more touching than my youth pastor
Two shiny golden gods.
As a HUGE Chris Isaak fan, I love this. Great job!
Glad to see you are posting again. I just wrote a song that's gonna rock the world nearly as hard as everything you've put out.
Kyle is PACKING!
Hang on, did Jack lose the beard? it looked epic!
This is amazing 😄🤍
1:49 mins of sheer joy and smiles I feel inspired
They still have the pick. No proof, no doubt.
Please keep going, the world needs the D.
Waiting here patiently for the full version 😀
Oh nice, they covered my favorite late-era Roy Orbison song!
KG has morphed into the Raymond Briggs version of Father Christmas 😂
We need a full length version of this, not just a sample snippet.
I don’t think people talk about kg as much as jb
No joke; my wife is, right now, in the process of deciding if she wants to stay married to me, after 7 years together.   I think I needed to hear and see this.   Alright fellas, roast away or share your story.
given how this sounds like What couldve been from arcane, my headcanon is that the wicked game is league
These dudes are just officially creating content for the bear community now 😅 ❤
Low buget video ideas 💡   Tank you JB love the song.
I’m so glad Tenacious D is back! They’re my favorite band in the world!
Ultimate bromance 10/10 would recommend
The third pair of footprints in the sand was when the Tasty Jams carried us
body positivity defined
Pure Gold...
I feel so seen.
its... beautiful...  I think im gonna cry
What a wicked thing Cage is packin'!! 👀
Almost every day my best bro and I call each other and we open by singing a song to each other and we have to incorporate the person’s name into the lyrics. My name is Daniel (Dan) and his name is Cameron (Cam), so it works out pretty well. This is tomorrow’s song.
Jesus, Jack between this and Peaches you're making me fall in love over here.
Please cover the whole song! This was beautiful. ♥️
finally the whole thing ❤
The new Dead or Alive beach volleyball looks great! 🤣
all i see is two pigs in there underwear on an beach
Man.
Being a fan for decades now, having bought their HBO series on DVD and being lucky enough too catch them live when they played Columbus, Ohio. This still brings great joy in just watching them be silly on the beach, while a beautifully haunting song plays in the background. If JB and Cage ever read comments on here in the future... Thank you.
i really needed this today.
Man!! I can't believe that Chris Isaak guy already covered this masterpiece!!
Fuck yeah new album when?!
❤Two beautiful men's at the beach ❤🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I've been waiting for this full cover for SO LONG! PLAYING IT ON REPEAT BABY YEA!
Iconic
Romantic. Lol. Bahah...awesome...
RELEASE A FULL VERSION
You guys should TOTALLY do: Tenacious D and the Bong of Destiny. Starring ofc you guys and AMH as the next proteges whom must undergo a rHIGHteous quest of self discovery and personal growth to uncover what it truly means to ROCK! At the end you can bequeth the Bong of Destiny to the next generation of muciscians. You could do a concert tour and premier the movie live while you guys either perform the songs live as the movie goes or just chill n vibe while it plays and maybe do a set before/after the film. Would be metal AF just saying... P.S. tech n9ne as beelzebubs devout loyalist who attempts to free him once more. The King od Darkness as the lead antagonist with Tenacious D and AMH would probably send me into a coma... maybe this shouldnt exist...
It’s. It’s. It’s just. It’s just. Beautiful.   I’m crying with emotion here.
Am I the only one to spend the entire 1:49 praying to the Baby Jesus that KG’s tighty-whities stay put and keep the ol’ D covered? Prayers Answered!  I declare this the Song of Summer: 2023!
My new favorite music video, the pire sexual energy of this is enough to make a grown man faint and blush
gachi summer
My goal in life is to be as comfortable with myself as theses two beautiful men. Cheers boys. Riggigigooo riggigoo rrrfiggigoo.
Dude, why is it sooo short? I was loving it. Your voice sounds fantastic in this song.
orange
We need a superfans only part 2
I love how unashamed and comfortable kyle and jack are with their bodies. We could all stand to learn from that.
I love how amazing the song sounds in contrast to the music video lol
Kyle's packing look out Chris Hemsworth.
Is KG wearing an adult diaper? 😂
Pure Love <3
tenacious D is the best in this year
horrendously magnificent
Darn I wish he did the entire song this is sick
FREEDOM !!!
Oh the Tanacity!
Babe wake up new Tenacious D
jeez, thanks for being amazing for the last 30 years and counting, been listening since before can even remember
Dude I totally missed you ...guys
Is it me or the title reminds me of a Taylor Swift Song?
Made my day...
Blessed to grow up with JB and KG 😩🙌🏼
holy shit
Well... I now know what the D stands for.  🤣   This video is pure goodness and joy though! ⚡
I'm sorry, but I just had the image of Bowser singing this.
I never knew true love till this video. I am forever changed. Long live the D.
I've been waiting so long for this! First heard them cover this live on SiriusXM.
Absolutely majestic, iconic
Awesome, love it!
Probably the most running these two have ever done 😅
Gaming related album?  If it is, i'm here for it.
Nothing short of amazing
JB and Kage!!! OMG all I can do is say thank you.. I've always loved this song but now I love it even more!!! I love you Jack Black!!!!
J'adore cette chanson, merci 😍👌
This is beautiful 😢
Thats great but at the same time need full cover
These rock gods are packin. I had to play again with my eyes closed. Great cover!
TD here for a long time and a good timw
Majestic
Jack Black's beard is a beast all it's own and I am here for it.
EZ Funny
Is Lee filming ? ❤
such a beautiful voice 🥺🥺
This is better than the entirety of A7X’s new album
Man, the jiggle physics are insane
I Fucking LOVE YOU GUYS!! 💪💪❤️❤️🔥🔥💥💥💥
Tenacious D presents Mrs Doubtfire 2: tokyo drift 3: wicked game
one of those guys looks like he could play a anthropomorphic turtle that is the main antagonist against in an italian plumbers love life.
what happy looking guys.
June is Pride month 💜🌈
Why so short😢
Yeah, okay, fine, but WHERE IS THE REST OF THE SONG
This is sincerely beautiful.
😢beautiful
I love you
Song is just to short.
Ideal male form
Kage is looking a lot like Santa Claus and I'm ready for Christmas in July!  If you need me, I'll be rocking around the Christmas D
The second I saw the title I knew this song is the perfect match for Jacks voice! :O
Given the context of the OG video to the original song, this is fucking hilarious.
Nice😎
This really filled me up with such warm, gooey greatness!!!👍😈💀
Does noone has  realised that the MV just shows two old musicians swinging their balls around
I’m not crying it’s just dustbin my eye
🤯 Goodness! GRACIOUS!
Run you beautiful beasts of men. Run.
These guys have an incredible distance to each other.
Why the hell not? Awesome.
TD!
What on god have i stumbled across yet again
finally
What an awesome cover!
made my day this is gold
Junk is on point even in the cold surf. Well played.
they UPed the animation of that belly physics
Jack is getting ready for a Nacho Libre sequel with that unitard suit on! 😂
The sheer mood shift from video games is crazy
This is actually really soothing to listen to.
damn his voice melting my soul frl he has an incredible vocal cord
Please don’t make me have to remove my tenacious D tattoo
ANOTHER HIT.GOOD SONG&VIDEO.PLEASE KEEP THIS UP.
Man we just need a full album of Tenacious D doing covers and it would just be PERFECT! Jacks voice man <3
Loving it
Totally awesome booooooys
the song was meh but the video rocked, two beefcake hunks on the beach, can't go wrong.
Why the fuck is this so good
best ever.... period.
Protect these men at all costs.
😍
😳
Those are some bouncy men
Long live the kings of rock!
Do the world a favor and make a full cover
Time for the D to win a Grammy
Maybeeee teaser for a cover album??
damn we want full vesion of this!!!
😊...passt uff. Für euch paßt was zusammen. Wasser, keine Schuhe und Bauch. Bauch steht im Buch. Und es gibt einen alten Werkstattwagen, da steht Bauch auf dem Kennzeichen mit Bindestrich irgendwo. Wenn dieser Wagen zwischen SIEMENS und BORSIG unterwegs war, ist es höher Wickederstraße passiert. Gegenüber ist 1001 Nacht ,dahinter der Knast....Aber der Wagen wäre von SIEMENS kommend links abgebogen...! Oder er kam aus Tegel und wollte zurück ...Es gibt ein Max Sally  in der Tabelle,das steht aber so nicht im Buch. Max Sally wwäre englisch und steht für einen Maximalen Ausfall. Mit dem Auto ist auf jeden Fall was passiert. Das sieht aus wie zersetzt und wieder zusammen gesetzt. Das kann man nicht erklären...aber😊😊
You bastards
Rad bromance
Rock on
damn them booty shorts glow
Long live the D
Humans evolved millions of years for this moment. Sublime.
I live the original version of this song, couldnt have asked for a better cover
this made me cry.
You could have done a full version of this at least and not copy paste...
🔥🔥🔥
Great lyrics.
I do wanna fall in love, specifically with tenacious D, which isn't very hard to do
Is it just me or does Jack Black look like Andy Dwyer when he's running towards the camera at the end?
I like their weiners flopping all over the place
I'm pretty certain Chris Isaak had a psychic vision and this is exactly what he was imagining when he wrote this song. Only such haunting, angelic imagery could inspire such a haunting, angelic composition.
It’s like watching two unicorns while listening to an angel sing.
Kyles got too much going on in those hanes
We want more Rock from Tenacious D. We love the Band and Jack sings so good!!!! Please make a normal version of this timeless song
Tenacious D is alergic to releasing bad songs
Cool but why so short version? Can songs no more least 3 minutes??
Love y’all
I’m telling my kids this was the opening to Red Dead Redemption 2 🤷🏾‍♂️
Daaaaaaaaaaamn now I know where the D comes from, boys are absolutely PACKING.
Kyle's fingers be silver, Jack's voice then be gold
The sequins on Kyles tidy-whities bought tears to my eyes.
2 more years and you can just have AI make this cover.
Nearly 2 minutes of pure bliss and serenity. Please bring us a 7 minute masterpiece
You guys!!! 😂 #wickedgame #goofballsthatrock
I need a full rendition of this song by Tenacious D.
Full cover for the love of god
Wish they do the whole song love this cover
I hope one day Tenacious D will do a serious not not so funny project. They are amazing with their work.
I have loved this since they did it live months ago on the radio show and they sound so good I had to pick my guitar up and learned it right there. long live the D! been a fan since a kid!
Wicked game indeed.
You deserve more praise for your vocals.
Does this mean we're gonna get a Tenacious D covers album? Because I would be here for it.
Viejo pascuero en calzones
they rain supreme
If there's any two people in world I'd like to be friends with, its these two
💦 👑 🥔 🥔  👑 💦
Just 2 buds truly living their best lives.
The subtle art of not giving a fck  Glorious
I saw y'all at St. Augustine or however you would say it. Amazing performance! I would go see it again if I ever got the chance. And your Wicked Game you did was berutiful!
It's like watching baby goats frolic in the meadows for the first time in their sweet little lives...  I have no words.  Perhaps, *more than words* ... 😉
please my friend release a full version. I just completely got lost in your cover and now I need more
I’ve LOVED the D since HBO days. ❤
We need a full song, please.
I hope i have just as much chrisma, energy and just joy in my life as these two do at there age. Keep kickin ass Tenacious D!
I love how they embrace round bellies just like mine! It’s just fucking great!
Thank you Tenacious D! Thank you Kyle Thank you Jack
Gonna be honest. Couldn’t stop looking at kyle’s package the whole time.
Legend never change
Good for KG, man.
oh how i love watching old men running around almost naked
Jack has such an underrated voice. That switch to falsetto gave me literal chills.
I swear jack black is known for making some weird shit and it turns into fuking gold this is the reason why I love jack black
i love Tenacious D from Mexico
They brought the D!
Is this entire album just gonna be 1 and a half minute shit posts?
Bout time you guys covered this ;) fantastic.
Tenacious D is doing that thing old  lesbian couples do where they just start looking the same.
Never thought I’d see something so hot an sexy in my entire life.
YEAH! D! D! D! D!
These two deserve all the happiness and success, always! Decades of work to love
If anyone deserves to wear diamond bejewelled underwear, it's Kage. Rock on.
Absolutely beautiful.
10/10 no notes gentlemen.
Nachoooooooooooooooooooo
Bias aside. The weird stuff Jack does with his voice just works. It's like he found a way to make a comedic vocal trick sound amazing
An NSFW tag please. Want me to get fired?  Amazing performance though! Loved the singing too.
That was the best thing I’ve seen all year.
Magnifique 😘
This was so fucking good
what would the world ne without them two
i think Chris Isaak would be proud of you guy's for making the song sound so beautiful
Friends will be friends...
I want to put a like, but it says that there are 69K likes, and I don't dare be the one that ruins that number😢
I knew their was a reason I bought and ultra wide monitor.
Look at those two beautiful steeds blissfully running along the ocean side.
This video is rated "S" for Sexy! 🤘🤘
I gaze upon the glorious bodies of the rage kage and hollywood jack, and I find myself thinking wild things
Is there a full version? I'd kill for it! ❤
hold on im almost finished
Crime this is only 1:49 long.
Absolutely glorious!  Pure joy.  <3
Waves and Rolls, Pendulation It's not enough to save this nation Jelly bulge, Doctor's notes, Elastic that struggles to hold You know
Make TD into a corporation so Soros and the WEF can FUQ it with their rainbow mafia.  ....JK. Keep TD pristine and for everyone but without the Dumbness Exclusion and Imbeciiity used to rape the American public into crumbles.
I just wanna say D that I love yall and I wish much more success for you and your families! D forever!
I demand the complete full version. Thank you!!!!!!!
Pretty sure we all just witnessed the most exercise they have gotten in years.
such a great cover choice
They really don't leave much to the imagination to they?
Even with how comedic he’s being, it’s actually fucking gorgeous.
1:03 an Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh wanna fall in looooove HITS SO GOOD!
Is this finally THE SONG that was only a tribiut?   Did the D's finally find it?
why did it look like they weren't getting anywhere while they were running in the water
ART
Beneath thr clothes is a man, And beneath the man is his..............NUCLEUS.
Thank you gentlemen. Just thank you.
Peach, you’re so cool!
Fuck... my heart.
No sabia que lo necesitaba, pero como ya no soy joven y sexy esta versión me ofrece una mirada más realista de la actualidad y de disfrutar la canción.
Fuck everything, love these guys
Omg i cant stop imagining Bowser singing this to Peach 😂💀😂💀🤦🏻‍♂️
Jack Black's voice has aged like fine wine. Wine that was delicious already, and now is simply scrumdiddlyriddlydooumptious
You guys are awesome i love you.
Dear Jack Black will to dances d ever return
Tenacious D inspired me to learn the guitar and it makes me so happy that they're still jammin together all these years later
The D sure know how to make music, beautiful music, i love how they are so soulful in every musical piece they create.👏
Two Kings!
Added to play list
Same swim suites as "You never give me your money" never stop lmao
they're packing mad junk
This song breaks my heart every time I hear it, and JB is fantastic on it
The greatest band ever
Holy fuck, what an epic rendition
Kyle got that thang on him
Wicked dad bods
I foresee this as the new rickroll.  Congrats!
Jack and Kyle Frolicking in their underwear has become a staple mark of the band.
Kelly Clarkson can't blur out the koopas here. Run free, majestic koopas .
I Love the D !
Real tear jerker for sure. So beautifully done.. 😢
As an aussie, I approve of this version. Conveys the emotion Chris had with his song.
This is one of most romantic things that I've ever seen.
oh
what are you guys smuggling?
These men are gods among men!
아~ 진짜 이 둘 너무 좋다~~ㅋㅋ
That pan over to Kyle's sparkling undies was perfect.
Playing at double speed is doubly entertaining!  Playing at 0.25 speed killed me!
Finally a realistic body type rather than that Chris guy's. I support this.
I’m only 13 and love the D also I share a name with Kyle gass my name is kyle
Jack’s such a damn good singer. He’s so underrated. 😳 His “comedy” singing really wouldn’t land if he weren’t such a solid singer.
Actually a good song!
Please announce Pick of Destiny 2
Smash
Watched this exactly at 666 K views! That’s so perfectly the D!
Such a beatiful cover guys, You are simply the Best!!!
Look at the hogs on these rad dudes
Sooooo, No-ones talking about the bulges yet, that's my favorite part :)
God Damnit if I Don'T Love me Some D 🤟.........wait ......🤔😡😑🤯 GD  You know what I mean . These guys  man id sale my souls for just one more album from you guys that was As Slapping As your first one. I must have listened to that album for years. Hell all my friends must have. You two are epic.  I'm loving these covers your doing to , you should Do that Bohemian Rhapsody 🤌 Do it For Freddy
TENACIOUS D 4EVA
Anyone got the Tabs for this song?
This is what we all deserve
TOGETHER WE ARE ALL APART OF THE D!!!!!!!!!!!!
No shot, FOR FREEEEEE. You boys are packing ON PRIDE MONTH
The best part? You THINK those are tighty whities the entire time, and then, SURPRISE: sequins! 😂
Give us the whole song. This is amazing
Vinyl when?
Nice hog bounce
Shit, now I'm torqued up at work.
Wit chew! 😂
drugs and free time with your friend you can trust is life=the message i got from the joyous energy in this. #Make-A-Sequel
I would love to have a Tenacious D cover album.
falling in love as I watch XD
That video has so much JOY. I'm glad you guys exist🤟🤟
Yes.
Why are all my ads furry ads
Slobs
👣
How can something make me laugh and cry in the best of ways.
Never in my life have I needed something so badly and not known until I received it.
“Tenacious D” which literally translates to the greatest band from year 1-2023
KG JB <3
TENAC!
Vodka movie part 2 vibes
They be packing
Just pure talent, love, and joy. I wish these two only happiness.
This really got me in my feelings
This is SUCH BULLSH!T that Kage teases us SO HARD to wait for his sweet b vox on the "This world is only gonna break your heart"  lines and then DOESN"T DELIVER, withholding his allowance of our ROCK release! NO FAIR KG!!
Those whitey tightes are putting in some work.
played this in the waiting room and am older lady sat right next to me right when it started. I had to leave lol!!!
Oh this is just beautiful... I love you guys!
Omfg they didn’t 😂😂😂😂 I am here for this until the end of time!
Hauntingly beautiful video. Song’s ok too
Wish this was longer. Everything sounds amazing.
Tribute to all those beached whales out there

This is going to be THE Album of 2023.... MARK MY WORDS  (Mack from Always Sunny)
these 2 are some of the most amazing people who ever lived
am I in paradise?
Those Ds really are tenacious.
Kyle carrying a handgun to the beach, why?
Jesus is Cage packin or what
Such a good song! Wish my brother could’ve heard it but it’s a few months too late for that. 😢The D was one our faves!
Thank you Jack Black, I needed this
you got to start just doing full songs you sir are a wonder and it is a pleasure to listen :)
OMG ROTFLMAO!! What beautiful beasts they are
Normalize wrestling singlets as beach wear.
What’s jablin’s jables
Just in case anyone is wondering this is a cover of Chris Issac’s wicked games
I remember seeing jack black being interviewed by a bemused and slightly horrified looking Anne curry back in like 2001 and I was like who is this ridiculous crazy man, he is probably going to be so famous. Adore. ❤
suck it Helena Christensen & Chris Isaak! so much hotter than the original video.
Give it up for the RAGE KAGE
Did somebody say new summer song?
Oh nah, I’m gonna need the full version asap 😍 a cover I never knew I needed
Best band ever
I love you guys. Thanks for all the joy you bring to this world. Truly thankful.
Love tenacious D, the only problem is that ever since video games got popular, everyone plays it on repeat all of the time.
Amo este video no puedo parar de verlo
I'm not gonna lie, I full screened this.
Run you majestic beasts!
epic song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MY EYES!!!! MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay! We are blessed with more D!
Hilarious footage aside, this is really beautifully done. Would love to hear a full version.
Glorious!!
Welcome back D, and thank you.
That's an impressive package
CHECK THIS RIFF, IT'S FUKKIN TASTEEEE!!!
Why do I feel like this video if seen by everyone on earth would bring about world peace.
Despite their best efforts to do a gross video, their grandpa status makes them very cute. Look how happy they are!
This is the level of happiness we should all try to achieve. Two bros just hanging out. Rock on
我最喜欢的摇滚电影
Yessss
Let’s do the full version boys
WELL DONE
This is unironically a really good cover
their bellies shake like tits in fighting games
Tenacious D for the next Super Bowl Halftime show! NFL make it happen ya fuckin pussies.
KG has a massive sack.
The D!!!!!!!!!!!
Masterpiece. period.
This song is a Cover from Wicked Game by Chris Isaak, still truly awesome Jack's voice is
This is amazing 😮
Bowser is that you?
KG! JB! TD!!
Jablinsky NO😢
HUNKS
Damn, Bowser has been dropping bangers recently
Come on, Kage, now it's time to blow doors down I hear you Jables now it's time to blow doors down
Need the whole song!!!!
Such a good cover !!
Never grow old inside.  Love you guys!
This shit is amazing
Bowser after getting rejected by Peach.
You guys should really release a cover of the whole song
So coooolllll   Love you guys
Brutal legend 2
Sensacional 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Even with a long shot on a small screen I can tell they're both circumcised
The year...no, epoch of music with Tenacious D
Y’all don’t want to hear this, but this is what peak male performance looks like.
I love you guys 😍❤️
Pov: how the dementia patient is running away from me and the pills that keeps him alive
Much love guys 💜🙏🌹🕊️😎🙃
Missed you guys...
Long live the D!!
Thanks
yo why the fuck tenacious D PACKING!!1
can't stop looking at their junks
Did you shoot this around your St. Augustine show?
Holy shit
I love this song, and am highly skeptical of any cover. Way too many have tried, and way too many have failed.   Leave to Tenacious D to do it justice. Jack Black has the Midas touch.
Im here for the tenacious d serious artist turn.
I know I can't be the only one that wants to hear you and KG play that sing in uts entirety. This, as beautiful as it is, is a tease.  A God damned beautiful fucking tease, but still a tease none the less.
Jack Marry me ❤ #wildatheart
I laughed and cried.
Thank you JB and KG. You have made look me very forward to celebrating my birthday tomorrow.
This is the real Peaches video... that shit got suppressed, for being too hot. Never thought I would be able to do more than 1 cock pushup a day... but sheeeeeeeeseh
I'm glad they're still active. I may have only discovered the D from SpongeBob edited/YouTube Poop videos with the swearing sound bytes but I knew about Jack Black as an actor beforehand and was amazed at how talented he was as a musician even for a comedy band.
Be. Still. My. Heart.
Love u guys
JB is my YT profile picture since 11 years ago, and will always be! 🫡
Huzzah
Wholesome ❤
Skip ahead a few years and I get this far off gaze when my grandkids ask "what you thinking about granpap?" ....."kids... I've seen some things...all you need to know"
Brasil
Instant chills
OMG!!!😊
this is one of the music videos 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love that T-D😮
zamn
BUT WHEN IS THE ALBUM COMING OUT?????? WE WANT THE D WE NEED THE D WE ❤ THE D
Please consider creating a new album and a new "Pick of Destiny" movie. Such creations would undoubtedly cement your legacy in history.
Gah damn this was a genuine jack black song it was so raw fucking outstanding I need the album expeditiously
Ill Never Fall In Love Again  Except with Tenacious D
THE D #2? please.
I don't know if it's the song, or J.B. and K.G. running on the beach, but i have a huge boner right now.
Love at first sight!!!🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤
My boys are all gown up...
🤤
Kyle.... you've been holding out on us...... in cold water no less.
That is some serious froliking.
watching the clip, or just listening to it... two completely different experiences...
Thank you Peach, Bowser, Mario, Luigi and Donkey Kong too.
they are kings
If someone asks what white culture is, show them this.
Still as amazing as first time I heard you sing lol... you guys are amazing
I need the full version please!!!!
Long live The D
Absolutely amazing guys!! Love you guys from the beginning to the end!!! Tenacious D until the very end!! I love you both ❤️🙏
Stellar cover !  The duet gave me shivers !
Look at those 2 legend running. Majestic
HELLLLLLL YEAH
YALL THERE IS A FULL VERSION OF THIS SONG THAT THEY DID
Thanks for this :) .
what could be more entertaining than watching 2 fat old guys hopping on a beach?  (no offense)
So wrong on so many levels, but yet I love it...
Perfection. The power of the D compels you.
WE NEED BRUTAL LEGEND 2
Jack black is such an amazing dude
Welcome back, The D❤️
WTF KUNG FU PANDA SING "WICKED GAME"?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?
ALL YOU WISH YOU COULD LOOK THIS SEXY!
Tis the year predicted by Tenacious D in the Rize of the Phenix
the camera work in this is trippy as hell, there's so much motion yet almost a complete lack of motion at the same time.
😂I can’t stop laughing
THE GREATEST BAND ON EARTH!
Utter majesty! 💝
You have blessed us many times this year
So much man meat
👏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  THANK YOU!! I needed this laugh today!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The pure sexual energy being radiated by these 2 majestic beings is truly a wondrous sight to behold.
The beautiful vocals and finger style guitar interspersed with slow motion junk flopping around. Only Tenacious D.
This video made me pregnant
Way to keep those Ferrets warm Guys! XD
I liked the other cover they did. I think Jack's vocals were amazing live. It doesn't help that we all hoped this would be a full cover, not just the same bit again. :' (
Wow, beautiful.
The singing and the bouncing are both deeply hypnotic
These guys haven't been funny in 15 years
Which you.
This is peak thriving, and I'm HERE FOR IT
This footage is what I want the aliens to see when they get curious about earthlings.
We need these two on the cover of playgirl.
You are awesome, we need more, the world need more about You, thanks!
Seriously wonderful
Isn't that Jablinsky gaming?
Lead us two kings! Long live the D🤘
This Is The Best Song ln The World. Jack Sings Better Than Chris.
So that's why they're called Tenacious "D"
Delightful
Exquisite
We love the D!
🥵
Beautiful
The world NEEDS a full length cover, this is bloody amazing 🤣✨️🔥
Their kielbasa sausages have got to perform.  Now geddidawn!
Such a joyous and majestic frolic!
could there be... a new album on the horizon? I guess we'll have to get a new D tattoo...
The greatest fuggin band in the fuggin world.
Aaaaaannnd IIIIIIIII, alredaayyyy fell in love, wit the D, tuff sheeeeeaahh
We need a full version, Jack was born to sing this song!
The love song for the summer of 2023. that I didn't know I needed......
Is nobody Going to comment on how clearly happy they are?  Guys go run into the ocean in your underwear and back out and we'll have a 90 second slow Mo shot.
This has Inspirado.  "Peaches" has no Inspirado and I hate it.
Man I love me some tanac d
I did not hear a word said in this song
Glorious!
Nice!   Anyways, when will be a video game extended version?
some are ashamed to admit it, but that is the ideal male body all men aspire to have
Oh no
a romance for the ages
FULL VERSION
KG is literally Santa.
cheeseburger
Jack's voice is at its peaks 🤘
Interesting choice casting Rick Steiner to play Jack Black
I'm listening this on repeat on Spotify because of how beautiful this is. I hoped this one was longer than the viral live performance. Please release an extended version! The original is one of my favourite songs, but your cover is my favourite of all time 🥲
Look at these studs
I'd do pretty much anything for an album of Tenacious D acoustic covers.
goosebumps. ❤
Kyle's fingers be silver, Jack's voice then be gold
Thank god it’s not No Nut November. I’d be drowning in myself after watching this video.
Masterpiece
they needed a belly bump while running through the waves to top it off
Live footage of Kage and Jables after killing Satan
Is this AI?
I wish jack black went back to voice Eddie in brutal legend 2 ( if brutal legend 2 would actually be a thing)
Seeing Kyle smile with his friend Jack makes my heart absolutely burst. I am so glad Jack never gave up on Kyle. 💚😊
They really do got the Full Package(s).  Love it.
Videogames by Tenacious D is the #1 song of this year and Wicked Game by Tenacious D #2 song of the year
I am in love with you both! Thank you for the happiness this just gave me. I wasn’t having a great day, but now it is the best day of my life!
Well, I can not be unseen... ever.
Majestic!
I can only picture Bowser now, what is happening!!!!!!!!!😂😂
Damn this was beautiful
Beautiful... Just. Just beautiful...
need more verses!
Man nacho libre 2 looks wild
Juicy.  Low hangin fruit.   I just slid of my chair! 🌽🥕🍆🥒🌶🍌
Beautiful guys. Can't wait to hear the full version. Also, Cock Push Ups, Best. Skit. Ever.
They both really stayed in shape after all these years.
🥹
This is a masterpiece. JB’s voice is mesmerizing and Kyles guitar is so freaking beautiful. (even snuck in the bendy note:) Luv it dudes!
YEAH!
2 men who are living a good life.🥲 made me smile and cry.
Tenacious D until the end of time
beautiful song
My funeral song
Khoury is a dingus

Majestic
The pinnacle of love.
The D Fuckin’ Rock!! This is beautiful! 🤘
Today, I saw the face of God.
YESSSSS!!!!!
Good to have more D in our lives in 2023!
pra quem não sabe esse é um senador da república federativa do brasil comparando sua roula com a do ministro de estado da justiça
Is this peaches
Saw them in St Aug and they fuckin killed it!!!
Simply majestic examples of the peak male physical form, like watching thoroughbred stallions run in my dreams.
This cured my depression
Great stuff.
NEED MORE
Bro how in fuc* do they get their recordings so loud and clear . Good lord I wish I had access to a million dollar studio instead of just my crappy phone
When a cover is an echo of return to form. Waiting for the D to return...since their first album they have been in a slow decent into mediocrity. Can we please have some sasquatch and dio again?
this... this is a haiku, isnt it?
what a cinematic masterpiece
The video is all fun and happiness. Then the music hits you and it's super intense and sad. This is awesome.
I think the time is right here in America. We need them to lead, lead as two kings.
Onlyfans coming soon..
HAHAHAHA! YES!!
I LOVE THISSSS TENACIOUS D FOREVER
Did I just fall more in love with Jack Black....
What are you wearing Jack black 😂❤
Hauntingly sexy
Oh yeah... They're back.
Quit teasing us and just give us the full version!
Gass got a full set of undies
Yeaaah Dude!! This song is so beautiful glad to hear 'm covering it!
i KNOW Chris is laughing as hard as i am while watching this video!!
like it or not, this is the ideal male body
The peak of male body, some might not like it.
So peaceful
I can barely handle one of the sexiest men alive running on the beach.... BUT BOTH?!?!
Brother , you have to stop torturing us and please for the love of tenacious D , PLEASE DROP MORE MUSIC ! ❤
Esses caras são incríveis...BRAZIL LOVE U TENACIOUS!
The most majestic thing I've seen or heard
.... Rage Kage is so fucking majestic!!!
New True Detective theme leaked
My EYES 👀!!!
i've never seen someone walk so fast and yet travel so little distance
There is really nothing good about this.  The music is awful, the singing is bad and and much as I love two fat guys (Two Broke Girls spinoff?), it was terrible.  Not even bad enough to watch again because it was so bad (They Live, anyone).  Sorry....
Top 10 hit, top 40 hit ,top thousand hit. As long as we get there, we'll start anew , and you can get a new tenacious D tattooooooooeweoooowoooo
I just felt so happy watching this!! ❤
I love it, I love you guys. It was almost hypnotic.
epic
Forbidden Fruititard
We need TENACIOUS D 2
Full version where?
This is the year of the D!  It’s time, I think the world is ready for The Bong of Destiny!
Please release the full song DDDDDDDDDD
Never have i ever related to a song so hard 😭
ahahah guys how we just LOVE you xxxxxxx
00:45 JB dropping that shoulder and splitting that wave into pieces, literally causing the ocean to part for Kyle!  🤘
Bear life
Best 2 minutes of my life
Can never get enough Tenacious D
So beautiful… so majestic… so magnifying… it’s… it’s… perfect
A new album would be sick but I need a new Tenacious D movie or show.  Doesn't even have to be a POD sequel
They be packing
"Definitely one of the best bands ever created." -Luxx 11/10
Masterpiece
Glass is carrying some serious heat. Respect
This video, I can't even😂😂😂
Been following you guys since my childhood and I must say, I love you guys immensely and thank you for being so legendary! I must say it’s sad how fast time moves. Jables and Rage Kage much love!
There just isn't enough frolicking in the world these days
The only thing that would make this better would be to release the full version 😢 @TenaciousD #MoreDPlease
The new advert for TenD Cologne... for the holidays.
Love yall, I wanna join in the next one. Seriously though I love your stuff and this made me feel better about my real man body
Too much sexieness! >:D
I will never get over Jack's beautiful voice no matter how long I listen to it 😖🥰🥰
Nothing to see here but fun and life living itself at its fullest
I don't know why, but watching Jack Black just run past the camera at the end like that made me laugh
:)
Jables and KG are the best homies ever
Where’s the full version?
The wife said she used to have this song on a casingle.
yesssss! More! I need more Kyle Gass and Jack Black! 😂
Just when you thought it wasn't possible to love these guys any more, they do this!
My ears just sent a message to my heart and it jizzed all over the place…💦🥲 Long live the D 🙌
B O W S E R!!!
Majestic
Happy Pride Month y'all 🌈❤️☮️

Is it possible to marry a voice? Not yet? ughhhh I just love him!
The Ultimate Bro'mance! *Inspirational in every way,TenaciousD show us the way,I now see a shining light,in this world of gloom & darkness!
Sounds kinda like baby or dude I totally miss you
Me at 1:51 “I don’t play wicked games no more”
I just watched two men with the builds of a Greek god play on the beach in underwear
I can't unsee Kyle Gass's junk just violently swinging around, Dude is packing.
Great voice
So wholesomely weird !
Jack Black covering this song is just Peaches for people too afraid to love that song.
kyle is PACKING!!!!
I got chills. This is aural beauty in its purest form
Beautiful. Just... Beautiful.  Oh, and the song is good too.
Let's goooooooooooooooo
Full length please!❤
dang bowser back with a vengeance
Didn't know I needed this
Almost hypnotic, like Homer on a  treadmill
Peak
Yet another Tenacious D song I will be listening to 48 times a day for the next week
I once thought corey taylor did the best cover of this song, and now i stand corrected. I dont think the world is going to rest until we get the full version.❤
Kyle be carriyng his acoustic guitar in the underwear

I am aroused, intrigued and impressed.
A tonal fever dream
Let’s go love them both!

Beautiful cover!

Never clicked a recommended video thumbnail so fast in my life.

Bowser doing weird shit recently
God this is epic
tenacious d is killing it! they must be smoking the good shit!
come to Argentina!
They never fail to put a smile on my face, can't wait to see them in london later this month!
im at a lost for words
OMGGGG best cover yet
I'll never forget smoking a bowl during 15 minutes of jazz at Riot Fest then having a panic attack before The Prodigy =(
Excellent cover! I do wish people would stop covering this song though. There's way too many covers already, and it's kind of getting boring. It's the same with "Hallelujah".
Just for my bday ? Thanks TD!
eyes already burning in 2 minutes...
The video with no context kinda sus
I open up YouTube and see this and just say wtf ?
I, as a 42yo hetero man, married, with 2 children, working as a police officer for 23 years, am in love with both of them...
Sa trogne à la fin 😂❤
majestic
So, which one is supposed to be Helena Christensen?
He had me at "wit chu"!
You can tell Cage is packing a monster meat hog under those tighty whiteys
Can't stop clapping.
id love to hear their rendition of mad world
Mermaids are real <3
The D🤘🥹
Two bros, chilling in the ocean, one foot apart cause they’re kinda gay
Damn! Kyle got some meat don't he!? 😂
im gonna cry my heart out when these two pass away. Long live tenacious D!
Holy fuck I wish this song was longer
🤣🤣 I can’t stop seeing Santa chasing a runaway elf on the beach 😂😂
Please make new music!!!
Chris Isaac cover. Can’t wait for you to put out good music again!
Serious question, where to find the halter top shorts that Jack Black wears, or the glitter onesies that Kyle has on?
This song is so soothing ❤❤❤
Kyle is packing man
The opening scene itself is a winner! 😂 But JB's vocals are definitely wicked!
Incredible cover. I like it more than the original. Acoustic fits it really well.
I am so happy and grateful to see this, guys.
wish this was more longuer than this 😫😫
Make Tenacious D 2 Brothers of Rock!
Them moobies tho
Tenacious D has to record a whole Album full of Ballads!
4 days till the Concert - so excited
Ho god. I waited SO impatiently for this release... and it's actually the same lengh as the live version... Me sad.
Art
Oh my god all your songs are gold!
This video looks like the events preceding Lemon Party
Longer Version please!!!! So awesome!!!!!!
I choose to believe this was an impromptu stop, strip, and frolic.  Those are just their daily underwear 😊
Wonder when they will release an Onlyfans
Omg i didn´t know i needed this
This song is full of raw emotion!
W, W, W, W, W, W
Beautiful audio paired with deeply sexual video
Beautiful
Dead sexy!
One of the few times you wish we still had 240p
Never stop! Long live the D!
every time i see these 2 together i aways think they are a gay couple
Kyle be packing fr fr
These mfers really dropping a video for the 90 seconds they did. I WANT THE FULL SONG DAMN IT
Such sweet sadness
Sweet preview of an amazing track! And the world needs more people with big bodies having fun in the surf. Also, Jack Black's wife looks luckier by the day. Just. Saying.
One of my favourite love songs and what an Epic cover! Love you guys
That’s true love right there.
Besta ever band

Wish i was this confident with my gut lol 😂
I’m in love with the video and the voice ❤ more more give me the whole song
❤❤❤
I love them so much ! 😂❤
BRO  JACK BLACK Is  PACKING
THATS it, it all begins with the 2 legends running in the sea
This sounds absolutely amazing!
Perfect. That’s all I can say; fucking perfect
Every song they make is an instant eargasm.
Majestic af
kinda hot ngl
I can't even. I'm so aroused
We all need more D!
Pay attention, you may not like it but this is what peak sexual appeal looks like. Real men have curves.
Yikes! 😂
Bowser's inspiration for Peaches
Thanks Tenacious D
Not Kyle with a big package!!!
🔥.
Please never ever change
"Wichu..."   Absolutely floored me
Amazing. Truly 😭❤️
Frigi gigigi gigigi gigigi gigi
Oh shit, is this the intro to the Pick of Destiny 2!?!?!?!?!!
Earth is healing.
I predict that this will overtake Despacito in views before the decade is up.
🤤I'll never be able to unsee that! 😂
Oh god I knew you would do an amazing cover of this it’s so good
Tenacious d having a good time!🙂
Imagine seeing a camera crew filming KG and Jables running on a beach.
I need the full length of this. I listen to each version of Wicked Game daily and this would be by far the best on that list.
Thanks to this video we can now see why they're called "Tenacious D"
Other song I wish the D would cover is Fear of The Dark. Jacks voice is made for that song
Once you get a taste of The D, you always come back for more.
I loved this! ;p
KG got a sock full of quarters in his britches 🙃
Please, never change
Damn, Kyle got some junk ;)
I dont say im gatekeeping or sumn, but all of the new Tenacious D fans are because of the mario movie. Ive been watching them since 05 and theyre still as awesome as back then
We already had 1/3 of this song before, stop fucking with the fans
Heavenly voice.  Heavenly gentlemen.   Thanks guys for brightening my day!
I Love ❤ the energy in this video. I hope we see a full length version of the song some day soon
My gosh
My grandmother was enjoying the song, she even ask me who the singer was, until she came close to the screen and saw the video. How can I explain myself now????
<3
Everything they touch is gold. What a pair of talents. I love them so much
KG's sweet milky jugs bouncing around are making me feel something 😋
Absolutely hypnotic waves. And I don’t mean the water.
Wicked D's guys!
DAMN! To think I used to giggle to tenacious d's "fuck her gently" when I was young without considering how amazing jacks voice really is.
only just 2 majestic men! whit big balls can make this master piece!!
👀
Record and release a full length studio cover with a full band and backing vocals and a shot for shot remake of the video with you cowards.
You already thanks God for the tenacious D today?
I had multiple orgasms watching this video.  I just don't know if I have the endurance to watch it a second time...
These guys love life
Just two guys living their best life  Also, JBs falsetto is genuinely one of the best out there
Two weeks till London!
Jacks voice is on par with the greats such as mr feddie Mercury. However, he dont take that credit. Tenacious D will always be a "parady" as they have said but PLEASE give jack the credit he deserves.
This has no right being this good
TENACIOUS D!!!!!!!!!
Brutal Legend 2 confirmed?!?!
Poetry in motion
So when is Tenacious D going to become part of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?!? 🤔
WOW the only 2 that I know doing what they like
KG looking tasty
What a time to be alive.
gotta pay respect to the legends, seeing as you are one
All I see is Kyle's massive bulge.
man Kyle be packing
Kyle Gass is my celebrity crush!
The Sound:  🤵👔🎩🪽 The Visuals: 🤡🩱🩲🎪
Like it or not ladies, this is what the peak male physique looks like.
Holy shit the fucking traps and shoulders on you pair <3
actually really good cover. I love the D.
Everything about this rules.
Dudes rock.
You just did for Chris Isaak what Johnny Cash did for Trent Reznor.
Am I the only one who sped it up to see them in real time
Even hotter than the original video.
Yes baby!!❤
Ever since I heard this in sirus I was hooked.
Oh this was majestic what a tease I need more lol
Audio: 10/10 Video: 10/10 if you look elsewhere Final note: 10/10
Love it! But why so short!
Where is the full song?????
Such frolicking
I had anxiety at the end when Jack chased the camera... O.O
Long live the D!!!!!
🥹🥹🥹
The guitar is so freaking clean!
Love this! The vocals are amazing ❤ now we need the film clip with all 4 of you ❤
When Jack let’s the pipes fly, the clouds parteth ways-eth
This is the straightest video of 2 men running on the beach topless together ive ever seen.
This is soooo good. Need full version asap!
Я блть люблю этих двоих
God damn Jack is in tune with something bigger, I know he goes over the top on purpose to be funny, but he’s honed in such an emotionally appropriate tone, I just want to hear him do an entire album of soulful covers, and I bet it would come out better than most pop stars could do
Such majestic creatures ❤
Greatest band of all time
They way you can put a smile on anyone’s face is unparalleled! I would love to someday meet you both in person and learn about your lives and what inspired you to become legends! Until then I’ll do my best to enjoy you from afar! ❤❤
How do I make this my desktop live wallpaper? 🌊
Many thanks for the content, this is great ^^
This phoenix will rise again !!!
Discovered these legends by accident in 99. And they’ve been my heroes ever since. Here’s to Wonderboy and Young Nasty Man.
Chris Isaak is proud
The two most beautiful men in rock
This is art 🎨
majestic
the day either of these two pass away, the world will surely weep big tears
Dang how come whenever I go to the beach I never get to see Jack Black playing in the ocean in a leopard print unitard 🫰
beautiful
just beautiful
this is a great example of a singer utilizing his unique voice in the best way possible.
I have the same feeling watching this as I do when I think of Robin Williams, one day they must pass from our lives and it will be a cold and sad day, I hope I leave before these beautiful men do, the world will be a different place to me. Lots of love, take care of yourselves. Superstars.
quickly...somebody animate Bowser singing this to Peach...and rake in them sweet views.
Please make a most Triumphant returneth and rocketh our socks off most excellently. #TheTenaciousTastyTuneTwins
two powerfull beings enjoing the ocean. MAJESTIC
🎅🎒🔫

A MILLION TIMES YES !!!! LOVE THIS ❤
Lmfao! Totally didn’t need to see that!
The beach goers “oh look two gay dudes running down the beach” D fans “that’s not just two gay dudes…that’s jabbles and KG”
Taking the sexiest music video of all time..... and making it sexier, how dare you
Please. PLEASE make a full version of this
I love the two of you more than I can express.  Whenever I see you, I am filled with joy.  Thank you both for sharing your artistry and your friendship with the world.
I Love that they're having so much fun in these songs with their big smiles☺
demasiado cine 🚬
Jack and I plan on spending Father’s Day weekend doing this exact same thing. Thanks so much guys.🤘🤘
it's like they are running in slow mo, but then the video is also in slow mo as well lol
I'm not sure which is more impressive, their musical talents or Kyle Gass is shorts that don't fall down 😂
There aren't that many people that seem to enjoy life as you guys do. Keep on rocking !🤘😎🤘
this is an unintentional unofficial theme video for pride month
Dude ty….my resolve for weight loss is at a all time high….ty sirs.
I need a full version of this asap
Yep, this is definitively a wicked game with our minds XD. Tenacious D are two fucking geniuses and this is a clear example of my statement XD.
I always knew Kyle was packing though lol 👀
“This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.”
Потрясающе!
Why is this so mesmerizing??
You two are more than human
i LOVE the VILLE VALLO REFERENCE!!!
I was absolutely not prepared for any part of what I just watched or heard
Those two guys bring me to tears and I feel al spectrums of emotions. So glad they exist!
Full Version please.
Sincerely thank you for reminding me how much I love this song.
Great vid!
We need some TD.
Even when jacks singing such a serious song he can’t help but add in a little clown powder, he’s just a goof ball at heart
My dogs never notice me playing music on my phone but for some awesome reason when I played this my one dog was super interested and kept trying to look at my phone and turnin her head. haha 😅 I was like yeah i know, we love tenD❤
Love it! You guys are awesome!
ELITE VIDEO
what's all that stuff inside their bodies
Beautiful
So happy 😊
Jack Black is my future husband, he just doesn't know it yet 🤣
Jack, God dammit, give me an album i can cry too please...
♡☆♡☆
Jack you are the greatest man in this universe, you are the reason people exist due to you beating the devil in the rock off, also you rock that swimsuit
Two fat dudes being op as fuck.
Well...can't unsee that. Lol
I LOVE IT :D
Love it love it love it 😎😎😎😎
You guys are fuggin' EPIC
Jack, para hacer esto, me enseñas la picha directamente. Primer aviso.
I love how wide the screen is to make it extra professional
Why am I thinking about a singing turtle right now?!
I NEED MORE. Love you Jables and Kyle!
"Y es por tí" by Juanes is the only thing i could think of hearing at this. Nice!
That moment when... you’ve just had... just had waaaay too much slow mo for one day... 🤣🤣 JK, haha! Keep it up Rage Kage and Jables🤘🏼🤘🏼
Please give us Tenacious D And the Bong of Destiny
Still on top of their game!
This is what peak male performance looks like.
It sounds like a Foo Fighters song
Please, lets here more. Having these 2 mins and less songs are killing me
It feels like i can listen to it on death stranding
Woof!!!!
Reléase full album guys it's your year!!!!
Make Kyle happy JB.
Dawn you are on fire Tenacious
"FRIDDII GIDID" Approved!
Jack, Kyle, your friendship is inspiring. I remember watching Tenacious D with my buddy in his room when we were teens. I had never even heard of the movie and we laughed so hard throughout the night. Thank you for that memory, we all appreciate your existence deeply.
Perhaps the most beautiful song of the year
AWESOME I am the BLACK Jack Black
Best video !
These fucking two...
You two gentlemen have aged like a fine wine! Perfection!
😭😭😭  shit man, it's too beautiful man....
Looking forward to more original music, but covers are also good.
These guys are the epitome of peak male physique!
No, but thank you.
holy fuck
_Beautiful._
Just pure love 💚
bOUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE
Pure freaking GOLD!
We all know we didn't need context for this it just makes sense.
put some stink on it!
Long live the D!
so much tenacious d, so much 🤫🤨🫡
Totally and completely fucking hypnotizing
Jack Black and Adam Sandler give me similar vibes in that they just produce random high quality content with their friends and with no guidelines to follow besides those set by their own creative liberties.   As someone who isn't an artist, Jack Black and Adam Sandler seem like end goals in life for an artist. Just make stuff, enjoy making stuff, and give no fucks about success.
Omg!!! Two Gorgeous men having fun yes it’s Tenacious D’s year we welcome it and want it!!!
The legends
Love tenacious D making a comeback
What a magic is that? need THIS on a full album. Just epic as always!!
Keep this up, I love the joy you bring to life! <3
These guy have heart in there work  And I’m seeing that in a lot of other art stuff so I’m actually looking happier into the future
Hell yeaah Sooooo excited to see you at Rock im Park tomorrow!
I love you both so much. Thank you.
Love the vocals, but the guitar needs work.
Magnificent voice and visuals❤
que asco y ridiculos que son XD  ... como quisiera tener su autoestima y la cara para hacer estas payasadas
This video and song don’t go together at all, yet I love them both and wouldn’t want it any other way. The fucking D is back!!
Noice one fellas I can tell yove got the insprado agian I'd better get new tenac tattoo
Nice to see u guys back to the old games  How can you not love these two
Thanks for this, and for... oof, like 22ish years of great music and friendship as part of your fan community.
So beautiful... Should've sent a poet
Loved it when you busted out the "Let's get it on" cover in High Fidelity. This is up there with that. If I didn't love your original art so much I'd say do more covers!
I'll admit... Not my proudest wank.
1:01 hit so hard I love it
How could you not love these two? I feel like JB would be one of the celebrities that would be actually pleasant to meet. Has always seemed down to earth.
I expected nothing but the best and they delivered it ten times over! This people is what art looks like! Take notes!
Tenacious D can do no wrong. Love the pure talent they have
It's funny I started listening to this song out of blue for weeks now, then I see you guys covered it. Happy coincidence
Freakee luv u guys! 🤘😘🖖
The D is back baybay!! What an awesomely dreamy tune with such a goofyass video🤣can’t wait for what’s next🤘🏻👹🤘🏻
Kage packing some heat!
Me encanta ❤ hermosa versión
Banger after banger after banger tenacious D is on a roll
Never seen anything beautiful like this! *sheds a tear*
Damn I gotta get a singlet like that
That's one way to start Pride Month.
Now I have to get a new bathing suit
Chris Isaac's video clocks in at 4:06 and I'm just saying I want those minutes and more footage added to your video!
109 second of such an incredible goodnes
WE WANT THE D!!!
love it keep rocking 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
YEAHH😊
Tenacious D understand the internet.
Need this to be 5 mins🤩
This is the pride month celebration we need. Two straight men happily running along the beach together while tender, beautiful music plays.
my eye please keep looking at Jack Black face
This gave me the biggest smile, and reminded me so much of my sweet dad in so many ways  ! More please, much more :D
This is one of the most beautiful pieces of media I've ever consumed in my life, very touching  Thanks D
Nice
Can't wait to introduce my kids to the Kyle Gass project
look at my boys jiggle
I love you guys from deep of my heart, hahahahaha so awsome ;)
They did the bendy thing!
Full version, pretty please?
Finally video games part 2
It’s criminal this isn’t longer than 2 minutes 🖤
We need the full version of this eternal beauty 🙏
this is the greatest and best video in the world...
Thank you
We didn’t ask for this but we needed it
Mmmm they look so good, hot damn!🥵🥵🥵
Tenacious D goes to the beach on acid.
Imagine how rich Jack Black is by now... Jumanji, Super Mario Bros, collar with Gorillaz, like 50 other movies...
The greatest video of all time ♥️
Simply irresistible
❤😂 love you so much guys 😘🤘🏻
And just in time for pride month!
I'm just mesmerised by KG's junk swaying majestically in the breeze
Absolutely breathtaking! And the song is good too!
This made my peaches cream. Jables and Rage Cage, thank you so much for this masterpiece. Please release a full version so we can all also be released fully.
😍😍❤❤
This made me horny for some of that sweet sweet D.
Jesus, KG be packin'!
I would love to see the tablature for this! Please 🙏
I could not look at anything but Kyles package. Like, “What’s going on down there? So much stuff bouncing but no definition. Did they have a bunch of fabric shoved in there or is he all balls and they are MASSIVE!”
Damn bro 🔥
U guys are awesome!
Awesome 👏🏻 😎
This is now my third favourite version of the song. Well done.
I imagine that this is a Johnny Cash/Trent Reznor situation, where Chris Isaac fully recognizes that this is no longer his song...
This is just beautiful. YwY
Truly the most epic musical duo of our time
“Nobody loves no one” is so powerful 🤘rock on, boys
Eat your heart out Helena Christensen!😂😂😂
Boys bein' BOIS
this shit a fever dream
I’m laughing and swooning for this track and video boys! Well done!
I just finished jane erye. Totally fits
Can  I get a 10hr version of this?
This is so hot
Back when everyone was blasting Eminem I was rocking Tenacious D! They aged like wine 🍷
Ave D! 🤟
right at my birthday! thanks for (accidental) gift :)
Incredibly sexy big bellied bearded men! Woof! Talented artists as well! ❤ ❤
I've been a Tenacious D fan since I saw the HBO special way back in the day. I saw them live during the Rize of the Fenix Tour, own every single album, and everything else they've released over the years. I've heard every song they've ever made, covered, etc. I have "The Complete Masterworks" (Vol. 1 & 2) on DVD, saw The Pick of Destiny on opening night... My point is I'm a HARDCORE D fan, have been since the beginning, so I've been well aware of how Incredible Jack's vocal abilities are for 20+ years now, and it still amazes me to this day. I'd kill to be able to sing like that. I feel like they're so underrated as an actual band, and looked at as a "joke band" by the people who don't actually listen to their music. The D is VERY high up on my list of "Greatest Bands of all-time". No joke, I mean that in the most sincere way possible. This was fucking beautiful! Long live The D! -
Had me frothing
I needed a Tenacious D comeback  Thank you Jables and Kage for your legendary contributions to rock throughout the years
One word: Haunting.
Another w
Happy Pride to this song/video combo
Oh My God!!! It's Black Jack!!! 🖤😂 He is living his life with a lot of fun and a lot of smile. 😊
WHY IS THIS ONLY A MINUTE AND A HALF LONG, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT DAMN IT!
The jigglin is, almost... hypnotic...
Feel so horny right now! You are brilliant!
AAAAAANNNNNNDDDDD I'm blind now
Man I remember like it was yesterday I saw jack Black on yo Gabba Gabba and now he's the meme king
This is the year for music first baby keem and now Kyle and jack 🔥

This is what top physical form on the human body looks like.
Fak, si estas leyendo esto, ya se que te estas pajeando...  coomer de mierda (?)
The video of this performance is outstanding as well
Cover album incoming? The Beatles, The Who, Chris Isaak so far (and Video Games of course, not the Lana del Rey song lol).
Look at them frolic, what a beautiful sight!
I love you, ive got tears in my eyes looking back at you JB and K ❤️🥹🥹
Come on we need a full length album of the best rock band ever. Make a come back my boys
So much talent. Perfection!
Cages junk staring my right in the face
What has been seen...can never be unseen, KYLE!
Lol? Its Kyle, but i was sure David Letterman gained some weight 🤣
Now we need a full studio version please.
From being blown to pieces by Bruce Willis in The Jackal, to EVERYTHING he does now...fun to watch Jack Black grow alongside on every screen imaginable 😊
Finally, I’ll take it
Beautiful
They look like giant toddlers.
Two legends in their prime
Im realy crying right know guys, thank U Tenacious D
Damn. Kyle's guitar and Jack Black's voice are perfectly suited for this song.
This was magic
Don't ask me the color of anything
These men are truly a gift from the heavens.
amazing cover! love it completely
Voice of GOLD!
bless for you guys and tks for live in the same time ... lovit
Legends
Good damn fucking poetic 🫡
Them running on the waves at the start is really trippy to me.
Peak
I've never seen such perfection in the human form put to music

Such majesty. <3
Mermaids do exist!
Don’t call it a MFn comeback!
I’m telling you right when the sad day in the future happens of jacks passing he will be the first man to get a high five from god Not him asking god for one but god will ask him for a high five  That’s how awesome jack black is
Nobody loves no one, even the heartless have soft spots.
no wait - Wicked Shmeat.
Seriously , get the rights I want the full song! Beeaauutiful Voice!
Nothing better than two half naked middle aged men with farmer's tans running through the water.  I mean that entirely unironically.
Last album was terrible good to see a return to form for Tenacious D
I’m at the beach and wish Tenny D was here prancing 😢
Yay, I hope I can hear the Live-Version of it tomorrow!!!
Saxenda might help.
Just seeing them frolic in the waves, brings my heart JOY, Thank you
see ? This is how real friendship looks like.
shmeat.
They’re like two majestic manatees frolicking in the waves
I thought this was a redo of Friendship:  Friends will be friends, they're running naked in the sand Friends holding hands, they'll someday surely form a band Friends will be friends, they say that friends are friends to the bitter end
sacks and bellies. my new band name.
Every single thing in this video is just pure perfection 😁
Mom wake up, Tenacious D posted!
Just two bros, frolicking in the ocean together to a romantic overture. Nothing to see here.
Sex sells 😂😂😂    You guys are awesome! I would love to hear a long version of this song.
Has anyone heard the Celine Dion version of this? It's simultaneously the best and worst version of this song. Well it was, until THIS version. I demand a full length release immediately, please and thank you.
👎
🤢🤮
A pure moment of grace. :D
I love the him version more
Bwahahahahahaha. You guys are really neat. Great health to the D.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
When I grow up I want to be like Kyle!
형들 행복하자🤣 1:39
no full version :(
I would pay top dollar for the other two minutes of this song.
During Pick of Destiny, right when Kyle’s wig falls off and his lies are revealed, would have been the perfect time for this version of the song to come on. Just picturing it is hilarious.
We need the full cover! How can we not have the whole 4:49!
I really love this two <3
I'm just  crying
We need the whole song!!!!!!
Best videoclip ever made
Thank you
lmao what an amazing cover
How to improve the original song in one easy step.
More like Kyle Mass god damn
Wi chu ❤
TENACIOUS D FOR EVER!!!❤❤❤
They’re all so short but perfect
We needed this.
for my birthday ey?
Jack's voice just keeps getting better and better.
Come to England soon please
Best. Clip. Ever! 😂
Lucifer sang it better
why im so attracted to this :D love you guys
This clip should´ve been on MTV back in the days...
That voice omfg
What a pair of legends. Its always a pleasure listening to you gents!
This is my Apollo Greed and Rocky Balboa training montage. It surely should've had Gonna Fly Now as music.
Kyle's fingers be silver, Jack's voice then be gold!
Just think how lucky we are to be alive at a point in time when Kage and Jables are making music together. We've had what, 16 trillion years of shit and then out of nowhere, The D. We are blessed.
Look at these toddlers so amazing *cries with straight face*
I’ve always felt this song is the most perfect song ever written and I’m 100% convinced it’s so well written, there’s no bad cover to it.  This is perfect
Beautiful *and* sexy
Moooooaaaar!
Fucking Love it Rage cage shining through on this one!
I hope this is me in 20 years
The most wicked thing about this, is that I can not hit like twice. 😁
Friends will be friends they're running naked in the sand Friends holding hands will someday surely form a band Friends will be friends they say that friends are friends to the bitter end Long as there's a record deal we'll always be friends Long as there's a record deal we'll always be friends  FRIENDSHIP
awesome cover, awesome video, got hypnotized on kyle's belly dancing (i mean bouncing)
No games this week Jabblez 😭✊
Baby men 🙂
This Is So Wrong! Scratching My Eyeballs Out! Where’s The Bleach!
hi Tenacious D i love your work i can't sing or play guitar but in want to make people happy like ye do i started doing youtube videos let's plays to make a attempted at making people happy hope to one day see you live in person. You absolutely rock and keep making people happy like you always do .
Awesomeness as per usual.
*I really hope this was filmed IN St Augustine Florida when they toured* 😂😂😂
Please do a full version! Please please please!
Full version or we riot.
Both sides of the D on full display here, loving life in full goofy ass fashion and belting the tastiest of jams
I am INSPIRED
Kyle's junk is beautiful i must say
Kyle is packing. Making me question myself as a man.
We need the second movie!  Tenecius D  - The Revenge of Belcebú  - Master Peace  -  - Any ideas?
I need to know where to get the same swimsuit as Jack
Jiggle.. Jiggle.. Jiggle.. xD (:
thank you for this guys
Just a couple of boys ❤
Kyle Gass is packing heat!!
Jack, Kyle, I've been listening to you guys for a few years now. This one is magical and blows the original out the water. I really do hope that you guys pursue more of these types of songs. Also write your own like this. You guys have some magical songs already. Jack, I wonder sometimes if you know what voice you possess. Unique and an absolute delight to listen to, regardless the song you are singing. I would like to urge you to produce one massive album containing some serious covers in your own style to show the original artists how it's done!
I stole a Tenacious D record from someone in my teens.. I still feel bad about it. It’s been 15years… Should not have taken the D away from that person.. but the temptation was to strong…
Hopefully they make another movie.
Hypnotic.
I'm here begging for a full cover of this!!
I'm so glad the D are still out there, rocking out. It's a beautiful friendship <3
Well shit. That was short...
Qotsa,  Foo Fighters,  Royal Blood, Mars Volta, Tenacious D...  What a great year for music 😊
I like it guys but still wtf ;)
My buddy and I can relate to this music video
-We wanna make a hit cover -How much budget do you have? -Like 3 dollars -Ok, we can do it
wish U guys would stop copying eveyrone else....
We need a full cover
I fuckin love you guys!!!
Yes.
Beautiful. This is like Johnny Cash covering Hurt.
Jack Black looks really happy. I hope to have his confidence and I weigh less than he does.
🍆
Hearing Jack Black's vocals just gave me goosebumps.... Coupled with Kyle Glass on acoustic guitar... This is so beautiful! I think I'm gonna cry...
We all needed this happiness.
i thought it was the entire version, bad luck, by the way, the clip is fabulous
The year of the DEEEEE !!!!
I wasn't sure if 2023 would be a good year but this has me reassured it will be.
I can't.. 😂
… I’ll be in my bunk… taking a cold shower-
This is one of those covers no one asked for(or expected to hear), but it's totally worth it😆
I love you guys
The beginning is such an optical illusion. It's like they are running, but not moving forward. Really trippy.
JB and Kyle just out there living their best lives.
I love you guys
This is peak male perfection.  This is what Gods look like when they roam across the beaches of Olympus.
hypnotic
COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF THE GOODS! 😍🤩👀
Venid a España, aquí no os disfrutamos nunca! Come to Spain!!!!
This song will always make me cry no matter what the video is.
TBH. I want to get older and be like Jack. A good old happy go lucky guy who can do what ever he wanted to do.
Now do Kiss From a Rose!!!! 😭
At this point, I expect an album from these two soon
Honestly I feel kind of bad for the people who spend millions of dollars trying to produce the perfect music video only to be outdone by the D running slow-mo on the beach in their underpants.
Soar like 2 white-tailed eagles.
We need a complete cover!!!!!
Beautiful
Oh, thank you, you round beautiful men... What a gorgeous snippet of a song.
simple and beautiful music video
Song of the year !
You may not like it, but this is peak male performance.
😍😍😍😍
Fuckin glorious.
Fuck this is the best version ever
Please control your orgasms, ladies.
Jack is still getting better and better at singing! Is there a limit? 😮
I don't think any of us were ready to see that much Tenacious D
No way you did the full song??????? this will forever be my favorite thing to listen to...thank you sir
Full version would unlock new dimensions
<3
I clicked on this while tripping on acid, I don't regret it.
Bro it's bowser from the new Mario movie
I just hear bowser now
These are the most beautiful men on the planet, figuratively and literally.
When i grow up i want to be like them...
We need a society where more people are as free to be as happy as Jack Black looks most of the time.
Jack Black's voice is aging like fine wine
I did know they were so good at juggling balls.
thank you sir
All in good fun, but after hearing the audio without watching the video I would like to see TD do a serious rendition of wicked game.  I can't think of anyone else who would give it the respect it deserves and keep that classic sound. keep on inward singing
I'm looking 😶
This was louder then any video i played in the last hour. I guess its for good reason
Just enjoying life.
I like how all I see is 2 grown men running in the ocean like little kids and I’m adding this to my Spotify
It's that month of the year....
full version plz!!!!!!!111
I have seen the face of god.
Video Games live action version
This friendship makes me so happy!
Wow. Watch how they prance by the coast like majestic, melancholic unicorns.
Wasn’t sure if I was supposed to laugh or sing along so I ended up doing both at the same time 😂
Beautiful. Everything!
They can appear to be silly, but this guys make good music and don't give a fucking shit. It allows them to express themselves in a way no many artists can. They represent Rock in the purest way.
Brother, i can already tell you this is my favorite song of all times.
Oh this sounded so lovely and I also was laughing so hard from the video! What a odd mix of feelings LOL
Best cover ever from all covers covered!
better than most mainstream hollywood productions. I was moved
farewell, mine erection. we shall meet in another life.
Kyle gots some big ol nuts hanging
Thank you
Heart rates are dangerously high, have a sit down you two. You’re point has been beautifully made.
They say this is not the greatest cover, it's just a tribute.....
You guys are the best
i love how the video is jack black and tg frolocking out in the wonders of the sea
Геленджик 2007
I'm "proud" of you guys!!!
What a fantastic friendship
What a voice, need the full song now
Where is the 3 hour repetitive track?! I demand more
This song compared to Video Games shows the duality of Tenacious D
Sweet sweet tightie whities
Jack Black still has the pipes
I'd like to be like either of these guys when I'm old.
Uh, I need more
Pleeeeease! Full song! This is amazing ❤
Wow
It's like dad chasing his baby at the beach
🏳️‍🌈 Happy Pride month yall 😊
All hail the triumphant reign of the most Tenacious of the Tenacious D!
This is too short! but is beautiful! I would love a longer version! I got goosebumps tbh
❤❤❤
I seriously love this.
i just looked at 2 man running at shore with a biggest smile on my face, a tear came down. I need to evaluate my life
2023 is the year of the D.
unbothered. moisturized. happy. in my lane. focused. flourishing. tenacious.
Do the whole song! I love this cover.
what the .........
This should be in a Diablo 4 trailer.
I don't get it, according to the description, the cover should be out, but I can only seem to find this teaser video and the same music from it in the link that says "listen here"?
I am pretty sure I've only ever heard Jack Black sing this song. Hmm, I think I woke up in a parallel universe.
That is a lot of D bouncing and frolicking on that beach...
Instalike!!!
Bet you cannot do Parodic Death Metal
So much SEX APEAL, this was beautiful 😚👌👌❤
I thought those were just regular ass tighty whities at first, but NO! They SPARKLE!
Well it was great but why wouldn't the whole song be done? Little disappointed
I didn't know watching two chubby old men running in bikinis would make me happy. thank you.
They're cute like infants were running on the beach. Tenacious D!
What baywatch wishes it could be
Music video of the year!
This is one of the reasons the world need 2 legends like you. You put a smile on my face and with such a great cover on a great song, lots of thanks <3
We making it out the beach with this one ☝️ 💯
I clicked for the music, and came for the video
Glorious.
😢
Legendary as always,guys! ❤
Amazing JB and KG!!
I thought it was going to be the full song. 😢
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dude! Hell yeah, between your collab with Chris O'Neil and this song I am soooooooooooo excited to revisit your catalogue.
The art direction and cinematography in this video are nothing short of breathtaking.  As always, The D have elevated the game.  Skadoosh!
IIIIIÌ DONT WANNA FALLL IN LOVEEE
I don’t play Wicked Games no more. Never play Wicked Games. Except for a little bit of God of War, never play Wicked Games.
No fucking way you guys covered this holy shit
damn this shit is actually pretty good
You have to love these guys!  Not taking life too seriously and bringing infectious joy to their fans.  I wasn't having the best of days, but my mood changed for the better after watching this. :)
Full song please.
The year of the D
Yeap this is the comeback we are all been waiting for 🎉🎉
🕺🏻
with Jack black gaining so much momentum again its time for another tenacious d movie
My eyes! Great song tho.
I'm really glad this cover kept it serious. Jack has a great singing voice and it's nice to hear it in a genre outside of his usual musical sandbox.
Their joy  [acted or not] is contagious.
Sexy  AF!😀
You might not like it, but this is what peak human males looks like
Majestic!
Love this song. To hear the D sing it is perfection.
This is art
Got to meet them at Blizzcon 2010. Absolutely love the guys. They show you no matter what, they love life and make killer music.
PLEASE tell me we're getting a full length version of this?? Jacks vocals are AMAZING on this!!
The best laziest music video
Two sweet children ❤☺
Still soaring like beautiful eagles!  The D has risen again!!!
instant LIKE !
I really thought jack black was gta running to the cameraman for a second💀
Hear me out:  Lord of the Rings Trilogy remade with JB and KG as the leads.
Such grace, like delicate flowers floating on sea foam :)  Long live the D !
Majestic!
Trash song, trash duo. Jk, can you even imagine being a TD hater??
This is, unironically, the superior version of the song.
This is the greatest and best song in the world... Wicked Game. Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here, We was skipping down a long and lonesome ocean beach...
this is so damn funny
yah I can't unsee Bowser singing this to a picture of Peach, it'll take time
Nice vocals though.
Thumbs down to wet underwear contests between old fat guys.
Majestic! Suler stoked to see them live this summer for the first time in yearsssss!
That junk though ..
The last of us episode 3, earth 6409.
I just want to run along the shore with tenacious D
YUH COMEBACK
Hahaha! That’s just hilarious 😂
art.
how is JB able to maintain such a perfect hairline at his age and how is KG able to look so adorable in thos undies :) hmm
that "thang to do0o0o0" makes me like that ocean
На припеве почувствовал те же мурашки, спасибо за замечтальный кавер на Айзека
7.6. In Berlin, megahyped!!!
The year of the D!
Brilliant exact representation of the original. My compliments guys. Loving this
💖
It’s like 2 big ass majestic babies playing in their diapers 😂
Gonna fall in looooove  Which you
Anyone have a hard time not staring at kyles junk?
So good 😂👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need a longer version
God I'm aroused.
Bro what is this supposed to be
He did it again. You are my next filthy frank
Killed it 🤘
So glad they put this recording out officially! I’ve listened to this version so many times on other channels!
FULL COVER PLEASE this was so beautiful
This is the peack of male performance.
I hope they both will life forever. ❤
😱🍆
Put this on her fyp
I came here for the music, but stayed for the balls 😢
Everyone's attention is on tenacious d now,please dont waist this uppertunity
I want to look away but I can’t! Love it!
What am I looking at? @_@
So that's what unicorns look like 😮 ..... Majestic 🥲
God can you two be anymore sexier ❤
I'm just gonna say it, Kyle Gass is PACKING!!!
I just watched ALL that.
what a blessing
Beautiful
You may not like it but this is what peak male performance looks like.
Another Jam.
What a beautiful thing to see two humans in the wild, so majestic.
Hey Jack!!!! You should check out Cornucopias Game!!!! I'd love to watch you play it Jablinski!!!!!!!
Sensual
I hope live they combine this with their “I’m gonna FU hard” song.
There's something very Finnish in this art piece
Fuck yes. 😘
look at HIM.... no wait... look at THEM 😆
Chris Isaak who? HIM who?
Imagine being on a beach and seeing these majestic beasts galloping your way
Beautiful, but I'd really like the full version. Especially with JB and KG having fun on the beach.
a Chris Isaak cover? MAD RESPECT
Standing Ovations are not needed for this absolute masterpiece... Especially off the back of "I don't play Videogames" which is literally a work of Art.
God, I love them.
Song of the Summer 1989 AND 2023
Fabolous version
tenacious D is BACK BABY!!!
Love you both so much
Yessir 🫡
My face is melted
...I know this is gonna call me out as 'Gay as fuck', but can more dudes be cool, funny, *and* unashamed of being a little chonky?
I literally sing this in the shower every single day. Thank you.
Honestly I prefer this version. Would be nice to have a full cover
Purrrfection
This looks a lot like Five Finger Death Punch
/ /lAmazl\ \             / /l ing l\ \
This is what peak male fitness looks like.
oh this is pure sex appeal
I wish the song and the video much like my marriage would've lasted longer.
😂😂😂😂😂, Chris Isaak não veja isso pelo amor d Deus.
I never really understood what "God created man in his image" meant...    Then I saw this vid
This was joyous to watch and listen to. ❤
Love this cover y'all are living large and loving life. Thanks. I'd like the whole song version.
New D. Happy Me
The voice, the bodies, the appeal, the guitar skills... what majestic men
Any cat fans? There is a "Wicked Meows" version already trending...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXEj-61LoO8
These guys have no shame! I wish I had that confidence, and go get them attitude!
“He wrote a tasty Jam and all the planets did align”  - Tenacious D
What a fantastic friendship!!!
Are we not gonna talk about KG swinging hog here?
Another banger in 2023
They tend to release an album every 6 years so their year is gonna be 2024
Actually better then the original :(
🐐🐐
filming the sequel tenacious d 2   :)   ... :(
Jack Black has some jacked shoulders! (No pun intended)
I needed this
I want a 5min song out of this one!
That's quite an undertow. Almost as powerful as the song.
It feels good when you find a fool like yourself.
I hath witnesseth the Divine
I expected Friendship is Rare to start playing
Chris Issac should be proud. 😂
Brutal Legends was a wicked game. And I want a sequel damnit.
Yoo, keep these masterpieces coming
What happened to The bong of destiny? …. still waiting
Bro, im sorry but the older man it HUNG lol 😂
The freedom these two radiate, and represent, is both refreshing and inspiring. Love tenacious d.
What a day it is when you get to here jables sing like that and here rage cage finger a guitar like that
These are the LEGENDARY soundtacks
4K was a mistake
Those face you guys are making in the end is GOLD 🤣
Soup
I stared at KG’s balls the entire time
Happy Pride Month everybody.
Two rock gods frolicking…. It’s so beautiful
What was that.
I only wish I could’ve seen this in theaters
I'm  glad no one had a heart attack
This is what the future generations needs again 🤌
Good to see the boys getting some aerobic exercise.
So beautiful it hurts
First extreme, now tenacious D, what a time to be alive.
Two of the best artists in this beautiful planet!
what magnificant beasts
Kyle got a HOG on em I was distracted.. 😂🐎🐴
every single one of their songs is so damn catchy, even tho this is a cover. I am absolutely convinced they did get the god damned pick.
We need Illumination to animate Bowser playin  guitar lmao
We need a full song!
This Video is oddly highly hypnotizing
just beautifull
Can we get a cover of Cold Play - Yellow next
what? lol
Kyle is packing 👀👀👀
Soooooooooooooooo edgy.
:,^
Okay legendary from the first 10 seconds damn this was what I needed to cheer up
This is off-topic, but I hope someday we get a massive cover album of some of the most epic rock and metal songs of all time. The D would be able to knock it out of the park.
Majestic
This is a lot to take in. I'm gonna need a moment.
You guys are just magical. xo
I love how they normalize the fact that you don't have to be super ripped to run around with your shirt off. Let them bellies fly!
angels walking on water
🤘🏼🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
NEXT SONG  NEXT SONG
Beautiful, two majestic creatures frolocking in the waves, accompanied by the dulcet tones of THE Tenacious D. We were saved once again...
0.01 MY NEW DESKTOP BACKGROUND!   Ihr Luschen!
Ain’t no way they dropped this first day of pride month
This brings me joyyyyyyy
Kyle has big balls bro
KG looks like he's packing a Tenacious D.
KG is always a legend with that guitar man.
Balls shake
THE BEAUTY

Imma fap to this so hard until its raw
This moved me tears.....
Rock on dudes 🤘
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I've been looking for this whole performance, but I can't find it. Please share!!!
Love the D. ❤❤❤❤
Man around the 00:12 and 00:27 mark or so, their movement speed is almost perfectly in sync with the receding waters so it makes it look like they're running in place yet there are water splashes moving backwards  Incredible.
We want a new movie of tenacious d
This world needs more fat topless men having the time of their lives (and by this world I mean me)
These 2 are the best thing that happened to music. Love ya too much.
Excellent rendition. Vocals, calm and descisive,. Guitar, alluring and frank. Video, recorded, and lit. A masterpiece.
Man I love you guys. Kickass and feel good about it
Majestic.
<3
I finally get to see them in 2 weeks, i swear i cant fking wait
I smell a sequel brewing? ;)
Anyone else thinks jack blacks tenacious D was out?
Can't wait to see you guys in 12 days in Forest National!
Beautiful 🥲
Never thought I'd be watching 2 studs playing in the water together. Well then, good night everyone.
Never knew I needed this cover.
A shame it's so short
Cant unsee that.
Immediate flashback to Ross and Rachel
I wish this was a full cover.
Delightful 😊 ☺️
Love you guys
Your tactics confuse and frighten me, sir.
♥️🌈🥰👽👻🤖
lmao panting hard at the end there. Needs more cardio lest the zombie apoc spells both their dooms, mmh.
Just as sexy and stylish as the original    Seriously tho, I need a full version. Damn.
I want Jack's swimsuit.
I can't stop looking at KG's massive package. Is he smuggling something down there?
ROFL i thought they were some jackass thing :D
You really can just see their entire cock and balls. Majestic.
We really sat here for two minutes watching two fat guys running in the ocean. (All love, Jables and Kables)
Better than the OG😂
SMASH
legends. I wish you would record the full song.
Oh look Ma, frolicking herbivores!!
Two moist boys frolicking on the beach, love to see it
The gays are so happy this video exists  It's me, I'm gays
perfection
His songs may be silly, but you can't deny JB is the voice of a generation! ❤
why do i feel like im the only one that cant look away from their balls...especially K.G fucking huge balls...im not gay but like dam
I hope Peaches is the gateway for many a youngsters to Tenacious D. I was a kid when I first discovered these two, glad they live on!
dang they did it aigan
This is such a tease, making us beg for a longer version. Too beautiful not to
So majestic.
Jack's voice is liquid gold
I need a full version of this cover!
Like Stallions. Like God damned Stallions.
It's incredible gorgeous and beautiful! - but how RAD would a full version be...  Please D, please.
I used to think Tenacious D was Tenacious Defense. After seeing KG flopping around here, I think it may mean something different.
Son todo lo que esta bien en esta vida!!!
Black/Gass2024
starting off pride month right
i keep trying to scroll up because of the wide screen formatting LOL
What a wicked thing to do.
It's like "I can't watch!" and "I have to watch!" all at the same time.
look at 'em go jack you are wild   ...wait where'd your beard go?
This now this is beautiful
NOVAROCK 2023!!!!! Lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What majestic, mystical creatures. 🐎🐎
i think I saw Kage's scrote.
thank you jackblack for being such a wonderful strong willed man keep pushing on being a wicked game lover
This Bowser singing “Peaches part 2”?
This is all I ever wanted from the D since they confirmed sasquatch was real... Now I can die in peace Thank you!
Unreal 5's new jiggle physics in full effect.
Are The D doing a covers album? Please tell me the are 😍😍😍
Cover is amazing
New A7X New Tenacious D What's going on!? Lol
Kyle has bigger cupcakes than the girl on the original video 😂
YES! a million times yes! goosebumps! -- ALSO the leotard reminds me of Nacho Libre and i'm here for it!
Is this AI made? I'm can not tell.
Most excellent- but at 1min 49sec, should they still be known as "tenacious"?
The new scent from Tenacious D; Pour homme et femme
Old Tenacious would have been naked 😢.
So. Fucking. Good.
I've listened to your self titled album probably 300 times.  Better every time.
This is hard good job.
What a fucking tease. WE NEED A FULL VERSION!!
Makes me sad you guys didnt make more music over the years. Now we are all old.
One of my favorite songs!
it honestly offends me that a song this amazing only has a run time of minute and forty nine seconds. Make it a continuous 10 hours please !
Tenacious D is on a roll
Interesting contrast, vid and music. Tenacious D, subverting expectations in every way.
I hope there’s a full version coming!!! That would be amazing!!
Better cover than H.I.M. at least lmao
couldn't even tell if they were moving anywhere at the start
I thought porn is forbidden on Youtube XD
Oh i fuxking love this. Felt it
Can’t wait to see you guys in Rotterdam in 2 weeks! ❤
So funny how the water made them look like they were running on the spot
Ah, I was really hoping for a full length version 😢
gorgeous !
Hell yeah! Time for the D to rise!!!!   …wait, shit.
The real ones know, this is just a sample of Jack Blacks singing abilities
Amazing again😂
At it again? You guys are TENACIOUS!
JB and Big K, your both in my heart, love you music and movie. Keep up the good work!
warms my heart. now im gonna listen to some kickapoo
Yepp, that's the best way to finish this day. Enjoyed every second of this masterpiece.
i could listen this like... forever...
Well, first of all - thank you ❤ Second of all - why? 😂
M A S T E R P I E C E
It's beautiful to see two people as in love as these two.
I hope I can be half the man Jack and Kyle are when I'm their age.
my hero <3
Amazing
My god how hypnotic video!!😅
2 wonderful dudes just bro'ing out
pls pls pls do the whole song!!!!!! its so unbelievable good
My most favorite band covered one of my most favorite songs! I can't stop to repeat it!
I just watched 2 young fit handsome men run graciously across the beach while it was paired with a lovely blissful song. truly an amazing piece.
"nobody loves no one" what a beautiful phrase <3
This is peak frolicking
Genious
bobbly dingle dongs
There is no doubting the awesome power of the D! Would love an album of just Tenacious D doing covers because they could only make those songs better
Thank you for this
This is way too short!
Kyle, if you reply to my written thought too, my friends will forever worship me, and that would be cool. I know Jack is too cool for school and this trivial request, but you KG, you just might be the ONE.
Just sitting here smiling like a dumbass😄
My favorite song performed by my favorite band. I feel positively spoiled. Y'all are the best ❤❤❤
if this isn't beautiful then what is
what a beautiful thing to wake up to
No, please, I can't, I have no moisture left in my body since the last release. But the D is strong with this one, so I'll straighten myself back up again and whack out one last... Smile.
Saw them in Philly, 2018. In my top 5 greatest concerts of all time. They played everything!!
Two fat men playing in the water,  What a beautiful sight to see
Peak human physique
Love from Germany <3 your are the Best <3
i am so glad to exist in the same time and place as these men <3
Do you know what I hate about every single one of the songs they’ve released so far they’re so short I need more I need more goodness how can you deny me more  goodness
Such majesty
Thank you.
Awesome❤
Not even ChatGPT could create such a marvelous duo
Sure when Tenacious D does it people love it but when I take my pants off and run at a camera am arrested for public exposure.
just guys being dudes
Two unicorns enjoying the beach. So beautiful
Yes
This vid, makes me laugh, majestic men just running on the beach.
ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS! MY GOD I DIDNT KNOW HOW MUCH I WANTED A TENAC COVER OF WICKED GAME!!
Would love to hear you guys cover the full song!
On pride month no less... 😂
😪
I love the video for this song
So sexy
Rage kage got them big ol balls
Master piece
I can only become so erect. Please, have mercy.
oh yessssss... :) bring it!
Am I in heaven?
D releases "Wicked Game" the day before Diablo IV launches. Coincidence?! I think not! I mean yeah, probably but I choose to think not.
This debuted at #1 in my ❤
Never fails 😂
Gracias JB and KG
Ive loved Jack and KG for years...but only recently realized they are probably the best rockers ever. I always thought it was Zeppelin, but after listening to Tribute, Kielbasa, Kyle took a bullet for me, and many many more, I think they captured rock the best , better than Zeppelin , maybe better than the Beatles. So OMG, they are the best band ever? wow
Bowser is sounding amazing!!!!
Getting old that no one here knows this is a cover.
First I find a song pretty good, second somehow and only 2 hours a comment already has 2.7,000 likes.
Omg...I am speechless
I feel like they are trying to tell everybody that they both jack off to video games 😃
Poseidon wept at such a majestic frolick.
their friendship makes me tear up. Their songs always cheer me up. so beautiful
I regret that I have but one like to give for this video.
These 2 are the perfect match.
Deleted scene from The Destiny
I was just listening to Wicked Game the other day LOL
OMG so perfect, TENAC 4 EVER ! <3
I’ve heard them play this, but never imagined a video of such magnitude!
The top of this video said "Upcoming event - London". Yep, see you there gents 😍 We missed out in February 2020 after Storm Ciara cancelled our transfers to Dublin. I was absolutely devastated. Nothing is going to stop me going to the O2. Come hell or high water I will be there this time, and I'm so freaking excited.
May I someday have the balls of Kyle. Both figuratively and literally.
Good mini cover, much love the D
I need a full version!!
here we see a natural D in its habitat of tenaciousness
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG YEEEEEEEEES
Alright yeah, Im not really sure what i just watched but I liked it.
Это мы с батей на море))))
Everybody loves Tenacious D. Change my mind
He's totally doing the "bendy thing"!
Kyle's bedazzled hotpants 💀💀💀
yes
My fucking hero
Tenacious D rules the minor keys fam
Yes!
1 minute 50 second of higth quality deep emotional content with pure soul and music that's exactly what i needed during last 36 hours of my life 😌
oh to be a member of Tenacious D frolicking in the sea <3
What tf are they packing lmao
Fine bodies in fine shape
That was fantastic 😊
You love to see it…. I mean… you really love to see it 😂
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤
Best comeback ever! #Tenaious2023
At last a video that fits my phone screen. And it shows two wonderful beings. Thanks.

I wanna do Karaoeke with you guys 😭 ❤
Beautiful.
Please PLEASE release a cover of the full song!!!
Majestic as Fuck
Am we said NAY!!! We’re are but men ROCK! AUGHHHUUUUUUUUUU!
Tenacious D is the band equivalent of James Cameron. At first you're like "Is this Cringe? Is this taking itself too seriously?" and then you're like "No this is art. This is perfect. THIS IS JUST A TRIBUTE."
beautiful
We can't get enough of it! We need full version plz..!!
I fell in love years ago already 💜
Packin the D in Tenacious D, oh lawd
At the ancient times there was a Legend of Two God Damn Goods of Rock. This Legend still live at this moment. Tenacious D - you're roooock!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
DAMN. I didnt know I wanted this but its just amazing. Thank you!
They are older and yet still so tenacious.
This should be longer
The D!!!🤘
New album when???
KG has 4 kgs in his shorts
I awaited the bridge for Jacks pitch.......I too wanna fall in loveeeeeee
Never have I needed something so badly and not known until I received it. Vegeta TFS
It's a wicked tune.
Yknow, i hope they see my comment, you guys have been apart of my life since my friend gave me a burnt CD of your 1st album and The Puck of Destiny in 08, and ever since ive not been able to put your music down. We used to walk down the road and sing the entire album skits and all acapella (to the pleasure of our neighbors) but i just wanna say thanks to you KG and Jables for making my shitty life that much brighter!
peak physical performance!
Good morning
Kyle Gass is such an underrated comedic talent. He meshes so well with Jack Black’s humor, and homey can play the guitar like a mf riot. If you can name the song, you get a like
00:35
im seeing more tenacious D than i ever thought i would
Happy pride
Kyles junk in those tighty-whiteys is just *chef's kiss*
i like these short songs
Everything looks good in slow motion ❤
“I do not need….a microphone….my voice is fuckin POWERFUL!!!!”   The D will always blow us away. Supremely talented musically and equally hilarious. All hail!!!!
"Witch You"
why are they naked
This is what beauty means
Majestic
kyle packing omg
what majestic creatures in the wild
2 gros qui cours le long d’une plage🤣
The best clip EVER
Is this the next song off of Bowser’s album? Counter to Peaches?
Mental video bravo 👏
i've got goosebumps
I'm glad to see you guys doing more with this cover. Cant get enough of the other versions but this one sounds even more crispy!
Goes hard ngl, jack black just makes it perfect with his voice…. the way he flucuates it is priceless
Greatest band in the world is an understatement.
You think you love them and then they do something like this. It's been like this since 2001. Raising the bar every single time. Love you guys.
Jack black with the angels voice!
It remind me of my brother and me playing at the beach when we was a kid back then :)
YESS LADS
Simply brilliant 🤩
My eyes cannot endure this much sexiness
Wait, this an actually beautiful cover, it hurts!
As always yall are amazing! Never stop being so beautiful!!
💚🤘
This... just... beautiful.
Cage come here i want you!!!!!
Jables
This is beautiful
My dog loves me
I have been listening to these guys since I was a kid, I remember seeing Tribute on the TV and just falling in love with their personalities that shone through. Keep up the amazing work guys, you rock
The realest thing in hollywood.
Is there a joke here?
Am i really watching 2 dudes in their 50's running in the beach? Yes  Am i gonna watch it again? I dont know, but chances are that i will
Have you guys been practicing your cock pushups?
The best.
Beautiful 😢❤
Tenacious D only fans confirmed.
This is awesome 😂
Its like watching 2 Unicorns frolic on a magical beach made of diamond dust!
2 majestic man
So glad The D are back baby!
Tenacious D renaissance?
Kings! ❤
FINALLY DUDE
What a masterpiece.
My best friend and I have the Tenac / acious D tattoo on our asses and you guys are the sole reasoning behind it.
Well they clearly both got the D.
🔥
Best music video ever
this made my day!!!!!!
Kyle gets more handsome with age🥰🥰🥰
Oh my god one off favorite bands just dropped a cover of my favorite stone sour song this is the best thing ever
Love the music guys
They're a couple now, and this was their outing for pride month 🌈
Glorious. Looks like this was out in Oxnard or something. No one the wiser. Just two kings living life. Hold on, the red phone is flashing...
And they say romance is dead❤😂
Oh. I was expecting the whole song. Damnit.
I don’t know if my eyes have been blessed or if I should gouge them out
rock legends
WOW
We are the D!!!
A W E S O M E ...
What a wicked thing to hide KG’s massive nuts from the world till now.
They should play this at Black's wake!
Yeah this kinda need a full version! It's such a good cover!
Way better than the original video and only in one take!
This is art, dammit.
Benditos los que nacieron para disfrutar de Tenacious D... Soy parte de la historia...!!!
How exhausted they must have been after shooting this video...
they're just packing absolute heat missiles for no reason
This is the way.
I thought the original was a foo fighters song I hadn't heard before. Upon learning it's not, I can say with confidence that Dave Grohl would absolutely kill this song if he did a cover. It definitely sounds like something he'd write
que gordos tan graciosos, aunque sea tan grotesco es a la vez hermoso!!!! jajajajajaja You´re the real thing, men!!!
Absolutely. Fucking. STUNNING.
dolphins grace
Did you film this a year ago, or are you guys still singing the Beatles cover?
YOu drop something really good but is too short :C
Holy shit that was awesome 👏 😎
They don't play video games...they play wicked games
Keep it going guys🤘
With all the shit going on in the world and in some peoples lives, this... this was really 1 minute and 49 seconds of peace and a moment for contemplation. Although the lyrics being kinda sad. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MA EMOTIONS DAMMIT!?!
Who would of thought that in this time of viewer retention, I’m more invested in this video clip of two guys running my into cold water and out again than anything I’ve seen in the past month 😅
What an incredible sequel to the hit single "Video Games"
Long Life for Tenacious D🤟😝
In 2 weeks I'm seeing these legends at the 02
my love
My cats approve of this song.
It is absolutely impossible to not love these guys ❤
They are the best thing that happened to humanity.
You are truly glorious, thank you!!! Psst, i share Jack Black's birthday, loved you forever!!!!!!
3th hit this year???
See you in 3 days 😄
How playing video games went to wicked video games
Legends
omg a chorus and it's on repeat forever. full version, I beg you!
At least, there are no Kyles hurting or being murdered in this video
Love you Tenacious D, love you man so much..💌💌💌
Goddamit Kage!
We've been blessed with The D this day ✨
Better than some other whale watching I’ve seen😂
Fucking MAJESTIC!❤❤❤
I had no idea that I needed to witness a beautiful cover of a sad song being played over two guys happily chasing each other in swim trunks (or Speedos?) along a beach, let alone on my birthday. 😂😂  Good job, guys!
Ladies and Gentleman the gayest Straight boomers ever.
Brought a tear to my eye, beautyful :´)
I was just thinking here that Jack and Kyle were just covering HIM wicked game. my dummy thick smooth brain didnt know that song was also a cover. this was really good
Long Live The D!!!
Great Video and Song. Still upset about your most recent KC show.
TD are a gift
Is too sexy!
Se you at Sesto San Giovanni!
KG BE PACKIN
1:23 it's like JB is staring into my soul 😮
This is beautifully wicked
Love the bit of country twang on the song. Really fits, well done!
I Love everything about this ❤️
👀wooow❤
I'm mad this isn't a full song......
Jack blacks singing is getting better with age
What a wicked thing to do.....and not give us a full version!
Tenacious d in the kitchen cookin!
Yummy.
This touched my soul
One of best clips ever
Should have been in crisp black and white
Thank you Tenacious D (JB & KG) for everything  💜  u 🤘
Cmon, this songs been covered so many times.
Amazing vocals as always. But this shit is super gross.
😂 love it! Lol
Truly the best band in the world. So much accomplished in their lives. People made happy. Such immens range too.   Proud to be a fan of the best!  Can’t wait for the show in Belgium!xx
whoa
Best band ever
The single greatest band in the history of the universe
Dripping sweat.. I remember those long runs with your hairy belly flapping louder then the ocean. Just running free. Erect and intranced
Tenacious covers are the shit
Ok. This is kinda funny.
J’espère qu’ils vont faire cette chanson au Hellfest 2023
Magic voice like always...goosebumps
Idk i needed this video of tenacious frolicking on the beach but i did
That was the greatest beach run in the world…or at least a tribute
Man I remember listening to Tenacious D back when I was in high-school back in the early 2000s and I am so happy to have seen them coming out with videos over the past few weeks.
It's beautiful, I'm at a loss for words
true happiness
Brutal Legend 2.
I love the song and honestly i wish i could be as happy as they look in this video
genius. as usual.
I love the D so much ❤
I’m ready for a new album drop!
Wow! talk about jiggle physics!
That angelic yet comical falsetto
Jesus that's E P I C
Just came back home from the beach, sadly it wasn't this one.
Musically gifted goofballs, my favorite.
Strangely satisfying watching this video.  Jack Black's glee is infectious.
THE D IS ALL KNOWING!!!
What a thing to wake up 2
I’ll never be able to get enough of The D
Banks and aftershaves should advertise their products using this clip instead of horses running across beaches.
Bro I was scared the whitey titeys were going down
That’s a nice set of packages on them boys
Just beautiful!
The awesome harmonic relationship of the D cannot be rivaled. It is like the Metal. You can't kill it. It will live on.
Tenacious D tour?
I love you guys
I didn't know how much I needed this in my life🤘
SICK!!!!
I am not ready to discuss how these titillating images made me feel.....thank you for changing my life....The D has done it again....
Like 2 Majestic Stallions.
The cover we didn’t know we needed
The greatest band in the world
Algo que estos señores no hagan bien?
This is true art
Growing up with Jack Black has been a great time. Thanks for everything you do guys
Why not the whole soooong? D:
Role Models.
It’s impossible to look at these two and not have a smile from ear to ear on your face.
Chris Isaak is proud, I'm sure of it.  ❤
Perfect
Double Speed. Country Version.
New album when!?!?! 😂
I can only hope I'm half as good looking as Jack Black when I'm older.
Jacks voice is so awesome
i really whant to grow old like them, your video put a smile on my face thank you <3
FXCKING LEGEND
YES!!!!
Tenacious D summer!
Masterpiece.
2 people never looked so free
Amazing singing. Weird disgusting video. 😂. Love you guys 🤟🏻🤘🏻
i love you
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
absolute gazelles <3 what a masterpiece
Te quiero Jack ❤
Love the contrast between the music and the video! Typical Tenacious D for me! Loved it!❤
Jack, hi there! Когда История на ночь?
they call him gas kuz he got that motor, goddamn.  Kyle "Baywatch" Gas.
Tenacious Double Dongs 🤘🏼
Is there an alternate version where they’re both naked, though? 🤔
Simply beautiful, thank you!
Banger 🔥
The beginning kinda sounds like the song that plays when smoulder bravestone (jumanji the next level) first meets his ex
Tenacious D: how the fetish for exhibitionism of 2 talented and prolific musicians paid for itself.
Needs more making out tbh
Very touching. Very beautiful....
keep giving me what i don't  know i need, thanks
Masculinity.
At this point Jack Black is just doing side quests 😂
✨Majestic ✨
AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII - Tenacious D
I see rattlesnakes. 2 rattlesnakes.
Necesitamos una versión extendida saludos desde argentina
Do these beautiful creatures have OnlyFans? Asking for a friend
Wickid!
You guys are awesome ❤
This is what peak male physique looks like 🗿
Что мы вообще знаем??
Didn't they stop playing games?
Just me was expecting for a full song? 😅😅 Really loved you guys playing this, I want more!
Великолепно! Лайк!

💔
Glad even sense The Pick of Destiny and School of Rock Jack still has music in his soul absolutely incredible
Love this. I can never admire you guys enough for being able to just be true to yourselves while also being epic in everyway. The humility and honesty that shines through in everything you guys do should be an inspiration for us all. You have so much talent, it blows me away, and you have added countless hours of fun and joy to my life. You guys are legends with no equal. Thank you guys, from the bottom of my heart, for all that you do.
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
well they managed to put another smile on my face.
Beautiful
¿Wen r u gonna ⭐️t 🐝ing NYce 2 th ❤️ ovur lyfe?
The year of the D!!🎉
<3
Those guys are living legends.
I want an entire Tenacious D cover album!
Remembering Helena Christensen... in some weird way
My pants have never been as tight as they are right now.... It's a bit uncomfortable actually.
Hello from Mallorca, Spain. You're the best, guys!
This is the sexiest video I've seen in my whole life
Damn, they going on a banger streak
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Full album of spicy covers by the D when????
Something this sexy should be illegal
What the hell this is so good
I demand the full song, we all deserve a 5 minute cover.
Imagine being on a beach and you see these too beautiful mythical beings running around
Jack's voice has really aged like fine wine, this felt super nostalgic for some reason T-T
😂 what the heck. Lmao
See u the 14th! Can’t wait. Hope it’s as good for u guys as it will for me!
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
I'm in heaven.
Pls make another Tenacious D. Film
I'd eat a Reuben with these guys for sure
that was amazing and unsettling at the same time
Another tenacious track?!?! LFG
Now thats how to have a good time
i love you! See you in the netherlands soon :)
What an incredibly moving video
Damn u guys, we need a full cover xD
this is something short, simple and beautiful... in every aspect.   Apply to the video and the song.
I would love to turn this song into heroin and inject directly to my veins all day
So beautiful
Boi-oi-oi-oing.
This is too hot
Perfection
Chris Isaak and Stone Sour got nothing on this cover
Helena Christensen has really let herself go.
Majestic AF
Is kyle in tighty whities? holy shit!
This world is a much better place for having the two of you in it. Bless you.
The way the water moved with each step they took was very neat and kinda satisfying to watch  (almost like they ran in place)
New album looking cool so far
I've just turned 35 and I'm now starting to realise I'm turning into the spitting image of the handsome Jack Black. If only I had the musical talent to follow suite.
that voice....that damn voice.....
beautifull
Don’t wanna fall in luv wit chu but you’re making it hard
I didn't realize this is a cover at first so I was wowed that Tenacious D made a song that wasn't all humorous. Then I realized it was a cover and I will say I think it sounds great and I would have never heard of this song if the D hadn't covered it. Chris Isaak, you may have just gotten a new fan thanks to the D
Timeless ❤
Very stirring rendition. Too bad they didn't do the complete song, but I love this!
They're like 2 lava lamps. I can't look away <3
Holy shit jack n Kyle are packing wtf
This made my day. Absolutely smashed it
They are the best pair… of friends in this world!
Didn't you know?! The D made their comeback.
This is Tenacious D’s world and we’re just living in it
Was that a painted on shorts? What a wicked thing to do to us lol
This was good but I really wanted a part 2 to Video games!!! Keep up the awesome work!!
KG hanging some serious Dong
Jeebles and Keebles are back!!!
I wanted the whole thing 😞. Also Kyle clearly has a potato in his pants.
Thumbnail led me to think that JB & KG where running naked in beach, but was then let down by undies... :(
I'll never unsee this.
Oh man ... fat is the new fit ...
Гениальный клип))
Keep it coming guys🎉
its like looking at whales swimming in the sea while the sun sets....MAJESTIC
No lie, i thought Kyle was in tighty whitys and i didnt notice the sparkles til the end. Epic!
Thats it!? I need a full version. This is a top 5 song of all time for me and you nailed it.
That's answered the "Where does Santa Claus go on his holidays?" question...  To the beach...
The best thing i have seen and heard in a long time!
JB and Kyle can do no wrong. We love you!
🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Bros even had it ratio'd for theatre mode on here, so majestic....
So goooooood
Я получил от просмотра именно то, что ожидал)
New Album?!
A friendship so big, it spread love to the whole world. 🥰🖤
Can't wait
😂❤😂
Please release full length songs.
Feel so blessed to be gifted with 2 Tenacious songs in a year
one of my dreams came true, see J B walking on the beach in slow motion.  uno de mis sueños se hizo realidad, ver a J B camiando en la playa en slow motion.
When will they be changing their band-name to Wyld Stallyns? #ClearlySavingTheWorld
They Will Be Kings
Great, now I have a boner.
Oh my god, this is beautiful
Thank you, Tenacious D.
We need a full album of covers, you cant beat tenacious d
This made me fucking sad
Jack Black, you've got a fantastic voice, man!  That's a really good cover of Wicked Game (a song I love for various deeply personal reasons) and, don't tell Chris Isaacs, but Jack sings it better!
Almost better than the HM cover
For the love of god, please do the whole song. You just keep teasing us, this needs to be turned up to 11.
fucking ding dong darling you guys are my bestest favorites ❤❤❤❤
LOVE THIS.... where is the longer version.
Eddie Riggs is a lot different these days
Here before this masterpiece hits a million views ❤
You 2 have impacted my life for the better. In associated genres folks get too serious. You guys fall between legends for me. The weird Als and the Iron Maidens of the world. Hilarious and/or heartfelt when ya wanna be. You guys inspire me to keep making music. Much love and respect gents ❤   (edit if somehow KG and JB see this I guess I can perish a happy man lol! Thanks for the likes! )
I didn't know Jack Black was gay. But in hindsight, all the signs were there.
TENACIOUS DADDIES <3
Will there be a butt baby?
Why is this so funny?😂
First: Chris Issac  Second: HIM FINAL: THE D
two fat bearded guys in speedos running in slow motion. You already made my day!!
True friendship
Such as masterpiece... The video of course!
Like unicorns prancing in a dewy meadow, majestic.
Kyle gas my aunt got her tits signed by ya thank you
They are that old but somehow that much more awesome since they started
sheesh
MAHUSIVE LOVE
GAME WICKED.
this video looks 100 percent AI generated and its uncannily tantalizing.
I was hoping they would have the shot of them embracing and rub the finger on each other's lips.😅
How the hell did YouTube know to recommend this to me?
My OTP
Outstanding performance. Can't wait to see you in London in a few weeks.
I came for the music and stayed for the bromance ❤
gives me the same vibe from those random videos that play on karaoke machines
YOO IM  VERY EARLY good videos 😆
such a masterpiece, art, just wonderful....oh and the song is a banger too
Русские, ставим лайк за Джека!
Yes.. This is real love
Absolutely beautiful
2 hunks go splashin
I just ate 27 GHOST PEPPERS in a vid 🤪🌶️💀🎉
Well, that's quite a wicked music video 🫣😅
❤❤❤❤
I wish this was the whole song because honestly JB nails it. I wish he was my dad!
what a wicked post
When people tell me that Jack Black is just a goofy comedian.... I'll show them this song (but maybe not the video tho, it might confirm their opinion)
That's art
Awesomeness 😍
I remember having my mom let me watch Tenacious D: POD with my dad and my brother. I was no older than 8 or 9. Yall have been so funny and genuine in everything you do. Love the great effort you seem to always keep striving for in whatever it may be
come to brazil you damm liciouzzzz
I don't get it 😕 😐 😒
A work of art.
Это восхитительно! Непередаваемые эмоции чистой радости  👍👍👍
unironically my favorite male vocalist of all time. Keep slayin JB
Great cover & the video is absolutely amazing 👏 😂
They move in herds....
Love the cod peices 😅
Beautiful
O man, there will never be another  Tenacious D. To be blessed living on the same planet.
As a straight, right leaning man.....this......this is how you start Pride Month!
This, is truly the happiness I've been searching for
So majestic.
im not letting my heart get broken again... ts hurts way to much...
A masterpiece
to make me dream of you...
Video games: 😃  Wicked game: 🤧

gods
Ohhh YES… i just waited for those White panties, to become WET, and the bonus, he RAN towards me… hot hot video 🔥💥⚡️
Joy
Bad ass !
i cant stop crying now... fuck you man...
Adrian approved fire
Pod and school of rock are in my top favourite all time movies and what can I say....they got the midas touch when it comes to music....nothing but gold every time. Love em
Love it!
The men, the myth, the legends!
And they say romance is dead. Pffft. I think NOT.  Tenacious D. 🤘😝
Oh, I was hoping for the entire song, JB...but even that little bit was worth it. ❤
All my love to Tenacious D.
Gods among men.
I was totally unaware water balloon jockstraps were a thing. 😅 . . .  (Caught ya looking.)  😂
QwQ
My only aspiration in life is to be as happy as these two gentlemen
This was absolutely amazing it made me tear up a little bit. Idk if either of you will actually see this comment, but I am filled with so much joy that yous are creating new music. Tenacious D was a huge part of my teenage years, and your music got me through some incredibly hard times in my life. So hearing your new content makes me so happy! This one resonated with me!❤
Long live the D!!!!!
As expected in the comments, most idiots think this is only JB's work.
Much like Johnny Cash's version of "Hurt", JB & KG have taken this song from Chris Isaak. and made it their own. So good!
I don't know why I love this, but I do 😁🤣
Such joyful happy old fat men! It brings a tear to my eye
Literal GODS
SO happy that y'all still make music together <3 so many great memories from D songs
Its time! For the D to rise again! Let's go
God you guys make such good music ❣
Nice song but the clip is so random wtf lol😂😂
Jack Black is white :v
Tell me what you want. THIS is what true love looks like <3
Thanks bud light
bro literaly made me cry in under 2 minutes
I thing they should make that a 3 or 4 min song it would be so good and then it transitions into this heavy metal melodic sounding thing
Bert Kreischer really lost some weight 👍 Lookin good boys
I'm so excited to see you guys live in a few weeks!
Kyle's fingers be silver, Jack's voice then be gold
Quality content made for less than $5. Eat your heart out, Disney!
I care about their relationship more than my own. The best start to summer! 0_0
It’s sucks these guys don’t play video games no more 😢
Great HIM "cover"  😂
The video is in slow motion, but the camera shake is in real time?
Heard a few covers of this song but this one might be the best yet!
Gods of Rock! You are awesome. Greetings from germany.
Glorious 🎵
Beautifull
This is JACK BLACK’s YEAR!!!
Jack Black is invincible.
Gonna see them next Saturday in Milan!!!! Can't fucking wait LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
peak performance
We're making it out the hood with this one!
Perfect specimens of the male body 😅😅😅
Trevor and Dave were both eaten by a great white shark yesterday. The shark did not survive.
Perfect specimens of the male body 😅😅😅
Goosebumps Jables.... goosebumps

Banger
Ecstasy. Audiovisual ecstasy.

Beautiful! Love the D.   …you know… in a manly way. 😆
Legends ❤

I thought the 3rd episode of The Last of Us is going to take the cake for the most romantic moment of 2023, but man... This here touched my heart.
Amor puro
mommy..my eyes hurt now
120k views in an hour 😮
Was expecting something goofy like the videogame one, and stayed because it's actually beautiful in its way
I have never seen anything as majestic in my life as the D running on the beach and the sea
I just tgink it's wholesome to hear them still together after all this time
For people who wanna know. Original song is Wicked Game by Chris Isaak. But most of all, damn Jack Black knows how to sing.
Fuckin awesome
I cried
Excellent show. And the Music is good too!
I honestly needed this today!
love this
Why is this man so fine?? 🥵ugh
Not kidding almost started to cry...
bowser after the movie
No cars Girls Shitty drips... Its only 🍆
The pinnacle of every masterpiece
Tenacious D died years ago!
Excuse me, why is a song about a wicked game not on the Jablinsky Games channel?!?
✨🤘🏻✨
Where is the shop link for that singlet?
So Humble!
Look at the waves 😍
A couple of privileged overpaid dancing monkeys that gorge themselves daily.
Красавцы😅🤘
I've already fallen in love with Jack😭
As a fellow middle-aged chunk Jack has to hook us up with his clothier. Come on Jack!  Help us with our style!
Their friendship is something we all should aspire to have <3
This was a tribute.
The amount of raw masculine sexuality on display here has made me question my own sexual identity... I guess that's just the power of the D.
Love it and all... But serious question, where i can find a swimsuit like that?🤣
Flab-tastic
Lemme get a Bob Marley, Extra Crispy
Yummy
I am so glad that this band exist
They don't call him Kyle "the Papaya" Gass for nothin'.
This is the greatest and best song in the world
Such a tremendous beauty this is. Well the song was beautiful too I guess.
1:50...!? This is so good! Should be at least three times as long
Man, the framerate used, the movement of the ocean, and the way it's shot makes the initial running really trippy!
I know that they put that huge package on Kyle for us just to look at. These guys are genious, I'll always love them
The voice of an angel.
Good to see my boys JB and KG together again
you guys°°
God I’ve been listening to wicked game so much recently I wasn’t expecting this   Amazing
Love it! Jables and gass have done it again. Amazing 👏  bravo
Amazing work!
Nickelback and TenD collab when?
Peaches, then Video Games, and now this?!
Damn, you guys got some huge ass nuts... that's a tenacious D if I've ever seen one!
The year of the D
So much sexiness in this.🍆
Good job .. I hated that song as a kid now you made it sound good so I have to go back and hear it .. I hope you’re happy with yourselves .. haha
This is what baywatch wishes it could have been.
Beautiful! 😢
I love you jack negro
I wish I could hear the full song in this vibe.
I aspire to be 1% that happy at any time
That right there is a disturbing image id like to delete from my memory.
Shout out to the cumboys that can't hear this without thinking of gay Chris Isaak
Fabulous 👌
this is the best thing i've seen on youtube in a long time👍
What a lovely voice Jack has! Such a talented man! 🥰🥰
Beautiful 😍  Tenacious D rules 🤘🏻
A Tenacious D album of cover songs needs to happen
So wholesome, bros being bros
Those bearded bards are on fire this year.
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👊👊👊👊👊👊🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
So peacefull. Everything so beautiful ❤
Jack blacks voice is just amazing
My heroes 😢 Tenacious D is back bayybeee!
This isn’t a tribute. It’s the best song in the world
👀👀
One of my fav songs of all time covered by the D? 🎉
🚬cinema
Goddamn this goes hard! The music video and the song!
Love it, guys!
There is so much hope for human kind. ❤❤❤❤
Lesson one: Never look this video at lunch....now i have a lot of  rice on my keyboard 😅 so funny 🤣🤘
Oh, Come on! I was hoping for longer ver😢
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Truely majestic units.
You made my day 🤣
Till these day i still can't believe they defeat the devil😂
That was epic 🎉
Is this Bowser’s follow up to Peaches??
How to be honest with yourself, and enjoying simple life
Dude I totally miss you xx
we must protect Tenacious D with all cost!
I always thought no one can top the version of that Song that Lucifer aka Tom Ellis did, but damn you Tenacious D, you have beaten Lucifer!!!!! :D
damn son KG pack heat
Why in hell is this not the full song?
Why have these songs been so short??? Please, Tenacious D: bring on some full-length songs!!!
still got it boys!  keep upt the good work
yall have a direct line to the joy of existence, I swear
Such a beautiful sight to see Jack and Kyle in their natural habitat, frolicking in the waves without a care in the world. Why anyone would want to hunt them to the brink of extinction, I will never understand.
You gotta do a full version, you just gotta, even if it's studio only you just gotta do it
Look at those majestic creatures, just jiggling in the wind. You can't describe pure beauty
🤘😎🤘, Thank You !  😎🤘✌🎹
Purely majestic as always. Get back on the road boys!! We neeeeed youuuuuu
LONG LIVE THE D!! 🙌🏼
Fantastic as per usual.
Please please please do a full song cover.
Am I the only one who's high as fuck who thinks this looks AI generated?
Look at them handsome boys
TENACIOUS D FOR LIFE!
I cannot express how much joy The D has brought into my life over these many years.
I was having an off day and so needed this😂
We can clearly see Jack's Tenacious D this whole song.
💯🔥🙌 love it
I just fell in love with this song. Fuck!
Beautiful Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dude I want to cry. Extreme and The D are both making huge waves in 2023   As a child of the 90s it feels illegal to have it this good.
well.. it happened,, and im ok with it
There is no more room for toxic masculinity when beautiful, no fucks given, oddly wholesome content like this exists. We must protect these gents at all costs.
The Joy is so infectious😢
Yessssss
Beautiful cover by the D and quite the impressive package on Rage Kage.
I would make a confused boner joke but it's not confused, we all knew exactly what we signed up for when clicked that thumbnail
That water had to be COLD, son!
GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD=======TENACIOUS D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As time goes by, certain things never change. One of them is Rage Kage prancing around in tightie-whities. Long may the D reign!
How you guys are able to make me want to fucking cry while I see two grown men in underwear on the beach. You're simply genius
God damn this pulls a tear 😢❤
Aquaman and santa claus sure look happy together
Absolute perfection.
Nurgle Bless Our Constitution In The Kindest Of Ways, Chat. Big Luv for the Tenacity of this D
They remade Baywatch? Awesome.
Tip O' The D, To Ya!
THe parra for cuva version is my favorite version of this song, but this one is right up there with it! Wish it was longer!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have been to the Great Wall of China, I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt, I've even witnessed a grown man satisfy a camel. But never in all my years as a sportscaster have I witnessed something as improbable, as impossible, as what we've witnessed here today!
i love you
Nice cocks, both of y'all kings.
Here we see the graceful Tenacious D as they present their song to the lady of the sea to bless their bromance with love and kindness.
Inspirational!
OMG CAN SOMEONE ANIMATE BOWSER SINGING THIS PLEASEEE
this animation is amazing! Chris and Adam outdid themselves on this one.
Man this is so cool! What a great voice!
Beautiful!  😊
Thats the one.
this voice is simply magical! Tenacious D Forever!
I’m loving this music y’all! Keep it coming!
The artistry is off the charts!
The greatest of all times
Beautiful cover
The video game of summer in the water
The song we need, but not the song we deserve.

Pure beautifulness
The hottest video on the internet
Been playing this song on repeat for weeks and some how manically I'm notified that's these two glorious men have covered it. Thanks the heavens
can't tell if there is a huge package or just saggy balls... maybe both.
OMG
Oneyplays really influenced them a lot huh?
Get you a bro who looks at you like these two look at each other.
majestic
Of all the days I needed to see this, today was the day.
Love it!😅😅😅
Aw man! I wish such a wish that you guys would do a FULL rendition of this song. It's just too beautiful not to!
Oh wow started crying almost immediately. BEAUTIFUL voice
Spellbinding.
Gays are happy for this video clip, I know that for sure!
I'm glad Jack Black has decided everyone needs to see him jumping around without underwear on at every given chance
LOL time to start the gym!
YEAR OF THE D!!!! JB, KG; Blow our fuckin' minds!
This is the most Tenacious thing  KG and JB forever
This is great 👍💯
Brilliant doesn't describe how good this really is!
Been playing this love for a bit. Nice they released a cover. Also - this obviously show same day as their last cover ;)
What an amazing masterpiece. Thanks for taking us to this journey with you guys. Jack your voice is so mesmerizing.
I honestly wish they would make full length songs.... I absolutely LOVE this.... 4+ minutes would have been amazing... even if it was just more guitar.... damn.
I know they'll never see it, but JB and KG, I just want to say you two are two of the most influential artists in my life. Stupid silly humor with incredible music has meant so much to me growing up. It's been such a fun journey watching everything you two have done over the years 💜
I can't remember a SINGLE thing about the song, the visuals were just too distracting, hyptotically so.
The D.  Forever.  The D.
This is my happy place
Wow fat naked white men so nasty!
Awesome cover, but why is it so much shorter than Chris Isaak's versions?
PLEASE play this at rock am ring !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Edit: they did <3<3<3<3<3<3
a masterpiece as always brava
the absolute sack on KG
Don't ask me the color of anything
I wish I could enjoy life like these two ❤

KG bringing the D to Tenacious D
Love these guys!!!

Imagine you’re at the beach and you see Tenacious D running through the water in basically nothing. The only good reason to live in LA.
There are not words for how much I love this cover. Thank you Hollywood Jack and Rage Kage.
I love this so damned hard.
Year of the D

They're running naked in the sand
This is peak male physique
What a magnificent pair of guys.
You've gotta do the whole song now.
I didn't know I needed this today but apparently I did. Thank you!
Joy
Wicked
More hypnotic than Hypnotoad
Was waiting for Sasquatch to run in from the left.
These guys are too awesome to be real!
*Kyle and Jack seem like they're really damn good friends*
I love these two.
I hope we get a full cover of the song.
Such beautiful singing
Sing to my earholes you magnificent beasts.

This song was already one of my favourites of all times, but after this video I will alway love it!!!
Not tryin to bring meme culture in the game but...after hearing Peaches i have to think abt Bowser when you sing
Get your came here before it blows up card 1k seats
Tag your biggest friend 🤩
I love my sweet bitches Coraline and Luise and if they see this comment they're extra gay
I'm really amazed at Jack's voice and Kyle's guitar skills. Tenacious D deserves all the love and more, making me laugh while making beautiful music
This is actually really beautiful. ❤
LONG MAY THEY REIGN
Amazing
I'm not your fan, but I really respect your work and I really like your charisma and talent, at one time I was very impressed with the film the pick of destiny, this is the best rock movie of all time, live and create forever, Tenacious D,
man, this cover is one of the most beautiful i've ever heard
I've legit been listening to the original version for the last couple of weeks. Now, after being bombarded with classics such as "Peaches" and "Video Games," I am blessed with this?! Jack Black surely is the Messiah
Goosebumps
🔥🔥
this is everything i've ever needed
And they say men can't be sexualized
Majestic
They are like fine wine only get better with age ❤
❤
He should have sung this to Peach
Everyone comes in expecting to laugh, not many come in expecting to hear how amazing Jack Black can sound when hes fully invested.
Honestly, I just want to meet these guys just ONCE before I die and sing with them!!!
is this the male conterpart to the blue haired land whalle?
Too short 😢😢😢
Kage and Jables, I love both of you so much! Please never change!
HE IS BACK!
The music video we didn't think we needed 😂
Nobody loves no one… like I dooooo  Was waiting for that last part 👌 nice song
The Bear Community thanks you both so very very very much for this video 😍😍😍😍😍
raw sexual energy
Such magnificent creatures!! This is what the peak of men looks like.
What a wicked thing to skadoooosh
Next time do this in a Target
Still love the HIM version but this is amazing too.

Good stuff!!!!!! Rock on Brothers.
The balls on these guys. . . literally, look at them sacks swinging.
BEAUTIFUL
I love the 30 people that woke up early enough to see tenacious d gallivanting through the ocean.
The combination of Kyle's guitar and Jack Black's voice are what dreams are truely made from, Thank You Tenacious D.
Please make a cover song album ;)  love the song and of course your voice!
Long Live the D!
Stunning, the greatest and best video in the world.
Thank you for the newly recurring dream of Uncle Santa and Jables Mamoa chasing me on a beach.. 🤘
That's the album cover sorted then
Man Jack Black can fricking sing. I wish I were that talented... and sexy.
Is this a single lol
Peaches heard this song and rethinking things
Thank you for continuing to be such raw and real people.
Great beach bods, perfect focus for the music
friends will be friends running naked in the sand
I’m so glad they did this! I’ve been listening to their cover on that radio station over and over 🥺
I have never seen such beauty! Thank you for making this I needed this. We needed this.
New screensaver.. ☑
“Does humor belong in serious music?” KG most underrated guitaw player, Jables gets the praise he deserves. Rock on Tenac&Anacious
What a wicked game to tease us with them potbellies
hey pal your eyes are up here
Beautiful
There are very few choices I made at 14 years old that I still think were solid choices. Loving Tenacious D is one of the exceptions.
This is beautiful.
y’all really can do anything and it still just be fine
tonight i will sleep well :)
You can't look away, like a majestic pair of musical lava lamps.
Really gotta get the full song covered rather than this, but its awesome either way.
What a masterpiece and a demonstration of what a real man is.
У меня в голове началась заставка "В мире животных"🤣🤣🤣
Poetry in motion
Beautiful
And in the distance, we see a wild tenacious d. As you can see, they are amphibious creatures, well suited to survive in the harsh climate of the ocean, as well as on land. It’s best we leave them undisturbed, so as to not disrupt their ecosystem.
am
Just straight up murdered the camera-man at the end.
I’m aroused and I’m not ashamed
I just wanna know where Jack got his swimwear so I can rock it this summer 🥲
I laughed, i cried, i came… here to watch this video and i loved it.
Beautiful friendship.
Looks like KGs smuggling hedgehogs illegally into the country. Looks like a whole family.
Damn where did JB get that awesome swimsuit?
....you can feel the romance!
This is what's meant when they say age is just a number
Im honestly just kinda confused. Am I missing some injoke here or is this as random as it seems? 😂
No wonder it's the best band in the world
2 unhinged lunatics living the life. it feels so glorious.
they did it 🤑🤑🤑🤑
... 😏 proper.
First
This is possibly one of the gayest things ive ever seen.
best friends for life
Hilarious video, amazing fucking music.
OMG. Epic!
YEEEEEEEESSSSS SSSSIIIIIIIIIIRRRR THIS SHIT MADE MY FUCKEN DICK TWITCH BOOOOOYYSSS GOD DAM
new album bubbling up
Rage Kage is packing heat.
idk why but this reminded me of the hotel scene in borat :D
santa is on vacation with an elf
Still so short! :(
This better not awaken anything in me
LONG LIVE THE D!
this had me in tears 😭😭😭
I didn't know we was frolicking
I can't... I can't stop watching
I'd be down to hear more HIM redone by Tenacious D
This is so awesome, beautiful cover and an honest depicted bodies 😂
I wish I could pull off a one piece suit like that.
YES The people asked and The D delivered!  Edit: Just listened to it.  I actually like the live version more, still fantastico
finally some quality video
Incredible. Just like this song has to get sung!
i love it
Gods of rock
As a man almost the same age as you two and having been here since the first album I gotta say you're both a genuine inspiration for the passion of loving life.  Thank you for making this world just a little bit brighter, Jables & Kage❤
what a nice song.  It's such a shame i was inexplicably stuck blind after pressing "play"
Gotta do the whole song now
Good ass cover
Well, that's it. I didn't think my favorite song could get even better. 👏
Legends
The power flowing through those dad-bods. I'm in awe
Brilliant!!!!!
A whole lotta jiggling going on in this video!
I was expecting something silly, but this was just pure awesome
We need a full version
Same outfits as the end of "you never give me your money/the end"? 😮 Song continuity?? Tenacious D creating a multi-movement masterpiece to rival Vivaldi??? ❤
maximo maximurum Tenacious D . viejos magicos.
Look at these old men back at it again!   *Pin my comment so I can get instant fame. Thx*
Beautiful...
*SO LONG, GAY BOWSER!* 🐢
We are in the renaissance of the D
This is the way!
Amazing 💝
I will never not be impressed by jacks pure talent and singing ability he is too pure for this world ❤
bing chilling
A/10 beautiful
Most beatyfull song i ever Heard in my life
Some one can recommend me songs of this band? I'm very love them
This feels like a depressing sequel to Peaches.
Y’all realize that it’s a cover of Chris Isaak’s song right? No offense to Tenacious D it’s a beautiful rendition but ultimately it’s a cover. Just saying
So THIS is the greatest and best song in the world... *tribute* !
🤘🤘🤘🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I wish they weren’t sold out
do not ask me the color of NOTHING
Best cover of this song I've ever heard
THEIR JUNKS ARE FEKKIN YUGE!!!
Just saw the D in St. Augustine a few weeks ago. Awesome show had a blast🥳
😂
Just dudes being dudes
saw the tittle and thought "There is no way this is the same wicked game" pressed play -> first cords -> cracked out laughing 😆 good job! P.S. that actually sounded quite good!
Who's got the mash, cause the D's got the bangers!?!
The D tattoo stays !
🐴🙈
From one thing to another... those waves though
History was written today (:
The fanservice here is insane *wolf whistle* awooga
How long were you guys out of breath after that?
i love these guys! <3
listen this song in 1.5 x speed , i did it accidentally . its amazing
That’s so gay!
There's something so amazing about seeing people genuinely enjoying themselves doing what they love to do.  Also, their bobbling dongs are hypnotic.
MAGESTUOSO
Such a wicked game in the end...
At first I thought I was watching "Bringing Sexy Back" and essentially...I was.
❤ this, listened to it half a dozen times already. Really shows the true range of jables and ragekage.
You showed me what it's like to be alive again. Thank you <3
that''s some strong poets of the fall vibes, didn't saw that one coming
jack blacks voice is pure gold
The Rage Kage sure does have some sack on him.
Im such a dummy, I was expecting a video game annoucement. The video title fit the style: a wicked game. Like in "I play this wicked game all night it is called..."
How angelic
XD buen tema, si hablo español pendejos XDDDD
Hi
Tenacious D forever ❤
One word: Happiness
what the hell are Bowser and Eugene from from the hit Christmas film "Elf" doing
here before 100k views
Good lord
Hilarious that yesterday I just happened to listen to 5 different covers of this song.  HIM and Theory of a Deadman are both real good.  Stone Sour has a nice one.  This is of course my favorite
This is more mesmerizing to watch than the classic Baywatch series
This is what life is for folks. Tenacious D is a national treasure. Bask in their glory.
well, i can say now that jack black has stared into my soul.
Awesome vocal range..
Wow, gave me a chill. Interesting
BRAVO!!!!!!!!
Poetry in motion. Like Ethereal Unicorns galloping through the sands of time.
That little frolic thru the ocean, took'em out for at least a day. Ha.                       Love u guys!
The sequel we didn't deserve
My 2 year-old is gonna be hyped to hear this new Bowser track
Their cardio is better than mine.
Like two unicorns 🥲 God speed you handsome animals
Jack is having the time of his life
perfection.
I've never been more excited to see two men run on the beach in unique to say swim wear leading up to this songs release
Still loving’ those pipes 😮
I need the full cover now this is amazing
Bowser is feeling the blues, from peach.
They have too much confidence running like that in a public.
Majestic!
Lol does anyone think foo fighters or something similar at first lol I had like 4 bands mix in my head in the first 30 secs
This is such a classic song, love that it's getting the Tenacious D treatment ❤
The fact that it's Tenacious D is why I have to watch it immediately. Don't even care that I'm at work or that it may or may not be workplace appropriate.
sexy young men~
Baywatch could only hope to achieve this majestic sight
Old fat farts having fun. I approve.
God Jack Black has such a mesmerizing voice I want more songs like this please
80s video game running animations be like...
I want to be like this when I'm that old
True!
Great success!
It almost made me cry, they're gonna have a crazy comeback!
There is nothing more pure than a frieneship between bros
One time i had a dream I married jb
Was bin ich sehend?
Girls this is what peak masculinity look like
Killer cover. The world always needs more tenacious d
This made my day
I hope one day to have a love that genuine and pure.
The subtle combination of wholesome and hilarious) Wicked Game with Jack's voice is absolutely divine!
wheres the rest of the song?   seriously- its great but wish it was a full cover.
Let's goo
how electric.
Jack Black es tan hermoso
Look at those glorious jiggly bastards ❤ that's the most romantic thing I have ever seen. Love it.😊
My heroes 🎸
I'm here to request more videos from JablinskiGames
Gutted, I thought they were going to do the whole song. Would love to hear that for sure 🤞🤘
❤
Now those are some Father Figures!
Damn real nostalgic for this song and this is a great cover
mermaids dont exi-
YES
After all these years, this love is still going strong. Jack and Kyle forever. ❤❤❤ I guess it really is some Tenacious "D".
y'all. this has been an awful week. my birthday was tuesday and the only person who ever called me, my dad, passed away in march from throat cancer. I've been pretty bummed. to wake up and see this was great, I really needed this chuckle. thanks for always holding it down.
Stay safe and healthy!
i cant believe my eyes!  4 kages and jack blacks!
beautiful
Absolute banger
AMAZING! I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS SONG
amazing, and this was posted exactly an hour ago, beutiful, truly.
I mean, brilliant, in its simplicity.  Farmer tan = Full Win.  Also sequin underwear.
just so you know, this is hot to those of us that like older men.
I'll just come right out and say it.   This puts the original to shame.
I need KG's bedazzled tightey whiteys, STAT
Damn Jack Black always puts 101% into everything he does and it really shows
why does it look like its going backwards?
Class as always
crying... i love the d
а мощные у них ножищи - с таким весом по воде бежать
Love you guys! ))
I know when you woke up today you were thinking,  "I wish I could watch a slow motion video of Kyle in some wet tighty whities"  Well, your prayers have been answered!
Dude most talent!!
Absolutely beautiful.
so when are they gonna drop the full song, this cant be it right?
I want that bathing suit
Can't stop the D!
No cuts. Incredible.
Bowser's been very silent ever since this dropped.
I love you guys ♥see you in Berlin 🤟
You dudes are fukin awesome 😂
Best friendship is frolicking in the ocean waves to a love song.
I'm so happy they're doing an official cover. I got to see them live and they covered this and I've been dying to hear their version of it again ever since.
I listened to the cover made on a live show on youtube some weeks ago and i was very sad this wasn't on spotify... now this really made my day.... thank you so much Tenacious D... you might forget the best songs in the world... but you'll never forget your fans <3
Me and my friend was literally singing this at his the other day in his kitchen haha and you then bring it out haha 😅
can't wait to see you at Nova Rock in Austria. love you!!
Kage's sequins can't hide that beer can
I shouldnt be looking... but I can't not.
Retro 80's black and tank striped singlet: 60 dollars. 1 Pair of white briefs, K-mart style: 3 dollars. One (hopefully) deserted beach on a calm day: probably free, given what they were wearing.  The looks on their faces at 1:15: priceless
Yes
epico
Just Beautiful😢
Why does this say it was released 56 minutes ago, but there are comments from two days ago?
This is a very different song without the video
aw yeah
You awesome mofos. You always make me smile and an inspiration to just enjoy live and not care what others think of me. Se you guys in 2 weeks in rotterdam. Can't wait.
the way he runs at the cam has me dead bro
Mesmo sem entender nada,pra mim só de ver o Jack correndo com esse cara já me deu um sorriso de canto
This definitely ups the original as the sexiest video ever.
i fucking love this dudes voice, tenacious d 11/10
Glorious
This is how ideal male body looks like.
yeah
Just love you guys. Tenacious D and the pick of destiny solidified my dreams of creating music. Love you Jables, love you KG.

The day that tenacious D makes a Christmas album is the day I can say I listened to Christmas music and enjoyed it

It’s a masterpiece
Waiting for your next album with the greatest cover songs in the world.

That's right! Sexy song in the world performed by the sexiest men!
This song did make him dream of him, and fall in love with him.
You beautiful bastards, you've done it again.
Dude, TD back like they never left!

So when are you doing the whole song?
I’m ready for a Tenacious D 2
It's not only the best song in the world... It's a tribute.
* immediately adds to playlist * love love love it! ❤️
Tenacious D and the Pickle of Destiny
I'm disappointed they're even wearing swimwear at this point
His voice gave me chills
Now jokes aside is beautiful that they are friends for so long at the point of running in the beach like they are married.
It'll be a very sad day when one leaves this world  Love you guys! ❤
great video
Y’all gotta do the whole song!! :(
This is cinema.
These two are truly the perfect human beings
The D ARE the wicked game 😈😍
Majestic beasts!
Just like my fan-fiction
These guys are total daddies, especially Jack Black.
Deux mecs hors normes, dont : un avec un slip Français.....respect
😝🤪😜🤣😂
Now do the rest of the song please and thank you
This was really great! But the SiriusXM recording was way better. Had more passion, in my opinion.
Excellent left speechless nothing more to say 🤪
Simply Wonderful! All thumbs up (like all of them everywhere) Thanks to the greatest band in the world!!!
Lookin good and soundin good as always fellas
Get these men a Grammy!!!
I always wondered what Santa got up to on the other 364 days of the year
Kages Guitar Gently Weeps while I violently sob
I don’t play wicked games no more, I never play wicked games.
this is so good holy shit
Beautiful
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤘😝🤘
So ripped off…y’all did this for Sirius XM months ago and it was literally the same length of how long you sang it then. THIS IS A NEAR 4 MINUTE SONG!! Very disappointed after the months ago version you did, was hoping this was actually a full cover. Wonderful sound, just something “new” that is actually months old for you two….
this is why jack black is a legend.
sush majesty
jack black packed in the sack
BESTEST WICKED GAME EVER DUDES!!! 🤘
Dude that was TNT
That voice! thanks for making my day better.
was hoping for WICKET game
What a beautiful video
I can't stop crying, it's just So. FREAKIN. Majestic.

Dangg, this is genuinely a gorgeous cover though. 🔥Obviously, with a gorgeous music video too. 😂 You absolute legends.

If only this was twice or thrice as long, repeat shall have to do 🔁
Tenacious Plum Smugglers
Nacho libre vibes❤
Why the hell was that so beautiful?!

This is great the song and the sheer unbridled confidence of these two!
Can’t wait to see it performed live
Wit chu ❤
Please come to SWEDEN ❤❤❤
Didn't think YouTube allowed that much sexynes in a clip!
Wow!
Truly Gods
4K version plsss
one of my proudest faps
One of my favourite band. 🤘🏿
OOOOH MY GOD, I LOVE THIS SONG!
Легенды
I've heard a few covers of Wicked Game, but they always add some flair or redo in some electronic way. But that was just a guitar that had emotion, and a dude with a great voice.   Awesome as always! I hope all involved with the D have an amazing day! ❤🤘
This gives off the “person reading the side effects vs the people in the commercial” vibes and I love it!
Majestic unicorns
Liked it before hearing the first note cuz you just know
what a wicket game to play, to watch your balls enjoy it that way
This is the greatest and best video….EVER
very wicked
My question is where do i find a bathing suit like JB's
🥰🥰
Simply incredible!
This is peak male physique and y'all need to accept it
Brilliant!
absolutely beautiful, such poetic visuals
power rangers theme next plss
Make it one hour edition
Hauntingly beautiful.  The song’s pretty good too.
Happy Pride lol
This band has a great cover. They can make it big if they try real hard.
thats awesome idk why but im gonna cry
When the bit arrives fully formed
Woot! Glad to be here for this :)
This dude plays a character in the second highest grossing animated movie ever made and then makes 2 banger songs within a month, he cannot be stopped
This is so beautiful
Ok, now I need to know, what came first? The video or the cover?
Aces.
It's like I'm watching labyrinth, with kyles huge majestic package bobbing to the music
Everything about this is YESSSS!!!!!
TD keep releasing masterpieces like its just a casual Tuesday
woahy woah
I farted #livelaughloveTenaciousD
they're like dogs
Greatest music video of all time.
I first heard the Stone Sour cover of this song back in the day, this is taking me back
Ladies this is the peak male figure sorry.
Sounds like the HIM version. Love it.
Just realized I wasn’t subbed
Soo good. This is one of the best recent tenacious D songs this year. And video game!!
que linda es la amistad
I love them so muchhhhh
Three bangers in less than 6 months? The boys are poppin off.
The pure joy on KG’s face 🥰😍 y’all are the best.
Sou brasileiro e sou muito fã de tenacious d
Tenacious D please make a sequel to pick of destiny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish I filmed the video..
It's too calm way too calm
how does these guys manage to look homeless yet so majestic every damn time
Beautiful. Majestic. Ground breaking.
Cream dream.
They've got armadillos in their pants.
That's some fine bears right there 😉
The D shall remain for all time.
To the best band in the world
This channel is just pure joy. Thank you Tenacious D
Please do the full song!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is this only 1:50 😭😭😭
Friendss willl be friends
The sheer unabashed joy on the faces of the D brings a spark to my sad little heart. Keep up the D.
I love you Tenacious D!❤❤
This is what the world needs.  This and fentanyl.
Я даже не знаю что лучше Вокал или Видео ряд хахахахаах
The human form at it's peak.
Amazing cover gentlemen!
ITS TENACIOUS D TIME MOTHERFUCKAS!
I have to say, I am slightly disappointed by this release. Not by the quality of material, it's an excellent cover, but this was hyped up a fair bit on their socials and all it is the same some they already released but with a video of them on the beach this time. I was hoping we'd be getting a full length cover 😢
Tendernacious D
Totaly beautiful 😊
OMG that is so much sexier than the original video. JB and KG looking good my brother's!
New álbum?????
So tender.
That's actually recorded at normal speed
This really doesn't leave much to the imagination.
Absolutely Mesmerising ❤x
This isn't even the whole song.... It's just a tribute.
PLEASE GUYS ! We need the full version !! Pls I need it so much !
This gave me some chicken skin baby!  Long live the D!
The dichotomy of Tenacious D
Epic as always!
Best cover ever!
Every frame is a masterpiece, down to the very last pixel.
You two are the happiest couple I've ever seen!
MINHAS PRECES FORAM ATENDIDAS
Too much sex appeal
Just Majesticness in its purest form.
Perfection ❤️
Literally everything about this is 100% pure certified rocket sauce
the d never dies
What. A. Banger.
why so short ):
I hope one day tenacious d just puts album of covers
Amazing, but why so short?
Dont know why but now i want a swimsuit like jack.
Noooooo! i need the full song
Ive been jamming on this song for a year and now Tenacious D has entered the stage.
The joy in their eyes. Marvelous.
Best cover of this song ever!
I’ve been doing life wrong.

No way!! cannot wait.
So fkn beautiful 💜🥲

Two bros enjoying life. Absolutely wholesome.
Magical😢
Every song they play. Is the best song in the world.
Thank you for coming out of retirement to make more Tenacious D songs Jack, the world appreciates it.
I need a extended version of this to hear it all day long
❤❤❤
I swear- they look so wholesome running there together. Video Games, now this? This is incredible.
First video game and now this? This is amazing!!!!
They're still two cherubs dropping absolute bangers! I have got to see them live.🤘
Those sparkle shorts 😂
epic 🤩
And they say music videos are a dying art.
Brother Is this cine ❤❤❤
greatest band ever
❤❤❤❤
GOLD!!!
I couldn't look away
Me and my man frolicking
Guys.... This is beautiful. 🥲 You guys are the motherfuckin' best! 🤘
Can we get a release date of the cover album or what ❤
Garden gnomes at the beach! well done!
This sounds amazing! Truly the year of The D!
Yet another banger
Now I want a shot for shot remake of the original with KG as  Helena Christensen.
This is so majestic and magnificent. You’ve done it again Tenacious D
At this point Jack is reliving his inner child
How does he do it?
disturbing...
As usual... As always...the greatest band in the entire universe. You Guys ROCK 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
All the best to Tenacious D forever.  They are truly a tribute to society.  Keep rocking!
Jablinski and KG DO. NOT. MISS.
The D is back!
Chris Isaak in shambles.
Jack Black is like a fine wine, getting better with age
Two kings ❤❤
Mr. Gass, Mr. Black,  You rock supreme and I appreciate this. Thank you very much.
I am part of the only Tenacious D cover band in North America, we are called Denacious T. We sling the word of The D and spread the joy of our gods Jables and Rage Cage. Long live The D
So glad to have them back! 😂😂
Keep these videos coming! We want more D!
How are we not supposed to fall in love with imagery like this???? Wicked game indeed....
— Красиво плывут! — Кто? — Вон та группа в полосатых купальниках.
Two majestic sea nymphs emerge from the water, luring me with their siren song ~
Did you know a long ass fucking time ago in the town off Kickapoo there lives a humble family religious through and through and through but there was a black sheep and he knew what to do his name was young jb and he refused to step and he had seen visions of fucking rocking all the time he wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did aline
I hope Jack Black and Kyle Gass live forever
Woulda been cool to have Chris Isaac run by in his undies for a quick cameo.
Don't ask me the color of ANYTHING
A glorious minute and a half of Jack and KG running
Please come back to Florida!!! Palm Bay and St Augustine we don’t care we’ll all be there!!!
Enjoyed this SO much more than Video Games.
Happy Pride Month to you too, fellas 🌈
Was hoping for a full cover 😭....Still lovely though for sure!
I can't wait for the future of Tenacious D
I don't play video games no more
Never Stop. SERIOUSLY never stop or penalties will be created and enforced.
And we’re BACK!!!!
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you  No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) With you With you (This world is only gonna break your heart)  What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you  And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) With you  The world was on fire and no one could save me but you Strange what desire will make foolish people do I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you  No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) With you (this world is only gonna break your heart) With you (with you) (This world is only gonna break your heart)  No, I (this world is only gonna break your heart) (This world is only gonna break your heart)  Nobody loves no one
Listen..Big D..Love your sh*t bro.   But why only 1:49? YOUR voice is from the GODS and this song should be so much longer.  :) Regardless of my ramblings. Great sheet brother!
Jack and KG frolicking on the beach... that's a hell of a way to kick off summer.
👏👏👏👏👏 THE D IS NUMBER ☝️
Man this was great guys. The new album will be gold. Lova ya D!   Long live the D!  (Long live me I poisoned your wine)
Why is it still only under 2 minutes long?
i went to the doctor they did a blood test and said i had td
Warms my heart to see Kyle Gass again.
And I´m still asking myself: Why not the whole song? *sighs*
yo jack black
Thank you, Tenacious D! Great as always! Jack's voice still going strong!
Cowbunga! Touch of class the guitar instrumental topped off witha drop of Jack’ness vocals, you cant be robbed! Fantastic 👍🏻
Runs into the water, then runs out, too f’in cold, no thank u…….bye, did we get it???
Best erotic beach video ever!!!
What a set of pipes on JB! If anyone could do this epic song justice its the D!
Hit after Hit For these guys. It would be A crime If They Dont Win a Grammy This Year.
this is a song, maybe, probably, maybe, and maybe its made by Tenacious D and JUST MAYBE the one singing is JACK BLACK oh my god guys.
Love it! Was hoping for a full 4min version but its great!
Been waiting for this! What an amazing version of a classic. I just saw y’all at Louder than Life last year. Long live the D!!
how majestic
The tour was awesome this year!!
TENACIOUS D FOR LIFE
The D covering a Chris Isaak classic with a more sensual video. Only getting better with age.
This would definetely fit in Umbrella Academy, love the song!
You guys make me fly!!!
That was mesmerising.
dang son! jablinskis be giggling their giblits!

Tenacious D is skyrocketing this year!!❤❤
Didn't realize this song could get any sexier
Gorgeous ❤
Why is it that only joke videos know how to properly upload an ultrawide video?   Seriously, multimillion advertising agencies? Black bars on top and bottom. Random video of two guys running on a beach? Actual proper upload.  Thumbs up Tenacious D.
These 2 beings are truly majestical.
Magnificent
This is peak masculinity right here!
Ok so I just came *very* close to screaming out loud at work.
Great cover❤
you guys are amazing!
New song!!
Such elegance, such prowess  Truly a tenacious moment
nice
Majestic
Lookit those chads
Don't ask me the color of anything
showing this to jack black in the beginning of his career would definitely make him think some things
This is just a beautiful video. Frolicking in the ocean like true super beings.
Amazing how they run without going anywhere.
The madlads. They actually did it!
A magnificent display of manliness!
Back at it again!

When not making movies we make comedy gold. -The D
😍😍
I hate you guys, i was prety sure Musicals were things i didn't like before "Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny" hit me and made me a liar.
Tenacious D be spoiling us lately
This is so good
Amazing!

Packing a fucking bazooka there KYLE
This was so good, jacks voice was perfect for this song. I'm gonna go listen to this on repeat for a while.❤ Love you guys!!!
Amazing! Rage Kage and Jables for ever!
where do i find the chords
So short man ... Yet so beautiful
Chris Isaak just rolled over in his grave, came back to life, and quit music after hearing this.  Then he climbed out the grave and said, "What the fuck am I doing in a grave I'm not dead! Did Jables get me wasted again?"
🍻🏴‍☠️🌹
I KNEW the D were gonna rock this!!! 😈
The D rises again!
awooga
It's the most beautiful thing I've seen today! You are my sunshine <3 (from France ;) )
Tenacious D 🐐

I love The D but you guys got to lose some weight =( Being overweight and getting older is not a good combination. We want to rock out with The D for many years to cum
Best video ever! It makes me want to embrace and accept my might male form!
It's Tenacious D. It's gonna be absolutely AWESOME!🎉
20k, 22 mins ❤
Wait....that was it? I thought there might be a song, a video, some real production quality. What the hell guys? This isn't the year of the D. That time long passed. I mean you guys rock but damn.....can't do the whole thing and have a super-creative video?😢
My only complaint is that it's too short. wish it was a full cover
Wallpaper Engine here we come!
"Friends will be friends, They're running naked in the sand."
Man I just love listening to Jack's voice singing
So incredibly talented. Great Work! Keep Rockin👿🤘

The only word I can use is majestic!
I love you Tenacious D. ❤️
VIVA LA D BABY
Angry straight men are not going to like this😂
Jables🍒
So this is what heaven sounds like
Wow❤😮
One of the best songs ever composed. Now played by the greatest band. We are in the right timeline.
This is a masterpiece, only the Tenacious D can make something good as this.
Jack and Kyle are so majestic
Didn't they use to be naked-er?
You legends! 😂
Actually crying
this is tenacious D's best moment
Oh were definitely being drip fed their new cover album, no doubt about it.
Can't wait to see them play in Hamburg next week
Interesting... I hope you both make a full recover from the horrific traumas of that wave. I'd also like to add I listened to and watched The Pick of Destiny for the first time recently and I loved it. Guess I'm a big fan now!
smelling a little copyright
Is there a Jill White in a alternate universe 🤔?
Thank you for blessing us with this masterpiece
beautiful
oh shit
This is so cool❤
Have you heard that new band "Wetleg.?" They make reference to you guys on "Chaise Longue." They say...They got the big "D.".......?
What a wicked game to play, to release only a minute and a half of such beauty.
Never felt like being on a treadmill more than this moment.  They're looking like actual capital D's to boot.
The most wicked game ever played. Truly a remarkable experience
Rock on guys, vocalist like no other, long live Tenacious D
Haunting
I love you guys so much.
Beautiful just beautiful
Absolutely a cinematic masters piece
Are you fucking serious? Thats it? I thought we were getting the full song. Fuck sake lads. What a fucking let down.

Greatest song ever

Please...cover the whole song...the guitar, the voice....just epic.😍🥹😍 I could listen to this version the whole day. It's just awesome.  Please...please please please cover the whole song.  Greetings from Germany😇🤟
You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Thank you for this!!!!
❤+❤
Lo unico malo es que termina😔
Absolutely wicked!
The day Tenacious D stops rocking is the day I stop living
Brilliant! You have blessed us with the sweet sweet vocals and guitar once again.
Tenacious D my beloved❤
"The power....to move you", lol, they've still got it!
their movement is goddamn hypnotic
KG + JB = 4 eva 😍
I love this and i love you guys,so sad that people only see Jack as an actor and when his music gets released those people act like it's the greatest thing and just forget about it,and i just feel sad that Kyle doesn't get as much attention as Jack even tho their both equally talented
🤘🤘🤘
Perfection
This is a very good Tribute. I mean Jesus, Ranch is the best dressing for wings hands down. One time when I was a kid I went down to my local dog park and wanted to Kick A Poo, so I did and made it go Explosivo. My best friend at the time, Kyle owned a gun and Took A Bullet For Me to see. Why would he do that? It makes you Wonder. Boy, all this talking makes me want to play some Video Games right now. I always like to play with a snack so I’ll make sure to grab some Peaches. I hope my girlfriend doesn’t LEEave me when she finds out. I still remember my elementary school days fondly. When it came down to the last pick for dodgeball, we nicknamed it The Pick Of Destiny. I showed off my Karate moves to get the picker’s favor. After we won our legendary dodgeball game, we used to go and get food from the McDonalds Drive-Thru. I’d like to end off my little story with a statement: the best item from the Taco Bell menu is definitely the burrito Supreme. I could kill a Sasquatch with one of those in my system.
I don't wanna fall in love....with this song. 😫
Proud of wearing my Tenacious D tattoo… in my heart! ♥️🤟🏻
Bowser after failing to marry Peach for the millionth time:
Art
just dudes being bros
I might have just cried a little 🙈😳 this is such a good cover 😍
In a world currently full of so much shit thank goodness for Tenacious D!
yippee
True statement
dang tenacious D is going to have a good year, they've made video games now this. they are the people we never thought needed.
White shorts at the beach, interesting choice KG
Kate in tighty whiteys is my fave!
A masterpiece
This is a true masterpiece, shame its not the full cover:/

Wicked Game #1: don't make eye contact with the D's Ds  Wicked Game #2: don't break eye contact with the D's Ds

Los amo ❤
The Greatest band in the world

What heaven looks like
🤘🥯🥯🤘
Es lo más hermoso que eh visto en mi vida
Someone's packin' frfr
I know what cover I'm gonna do next time I'm performing!!
A masterpiece
Too short, just like Video Games. :/
One of my favorite songs of all time, heard it first time in 1997, covered by HIM. Didnt know it was a cover until maybe 10 years later, when I heard the original with Chris Isaak. Incredible song.
Good to see Wonder Boy and Young Nasty Man doing okay…
I seriously teared up a bit....dayum boys....
Portugal need you, guys!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSS 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 love it!!
Oh my goodness I love this cover!
Rock on

Absolutely amazing as always
This is the greatest band who ever lived
Living Legends

one can only dream to see such a majestic view on a beach day. If there was a blue whale in the water, and you guys running on the beach, I know where I'm looking
sighs... And here I was hoping for a full version. 😢 But can we please get a shot from the video as a poster? Thank you.
What in gods name did I just watch 😂
How did they take arguably the sexiest song ever, and make it even sexier!
too short
WOW !
Bro it's 12:10 and I see this video
Woooo
Much sexier than the original  D/10 🌟
what a sight to behold
Beautiful song and amazing backround, youve done it again Tenacious D!
This is porn 😂
I was hoping for a full version :( With KG singing the chorus (this world is only gonna break your heart)
Holy shit!! This is something incredible! J. B. and K. G. on the beach, running through the waves... It can't be unseen 😂
I never thought that watching 2 overweight, underdressed, ageing guy running on a beach in slowmo could bring me so much joy. <3
JB and Rage Kage, bringing the LIFE GOALS!
best band of all time
We need a sequel to Tenacious D and the pick of Destiny! How about Tenacious D and the Bong of Enlightenment!
Wicked kool
This is a masterpiece of Art!! 😮 I knew there was something coming but damn you delivered!!!! ❤🎉🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
Lol what
Just... Yes! 😊
Love you guys!! I hope you’ll someday come to Poland to play the greatest song in the world!
looking forward to see the D in switzerland
The Panavision format only adds to the beauty and poignancy of this captivating video. <3
Nice try Jables, but this won't distract us from the Super Mario Acapella incident
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Perfection ❤
Tenacious D, I want to thank you for your appearance. I took seriously every message of yours. I found my own humor in your show, my own kindness in characters and how the world should look like. You are great influence to me, your work, it means a lot to me. Thanks!

First my home girl works with your sister on a farm! Now you do the classics my man. Long live the D
This is what I came for 🖤
Love it!!!
KG appears to be “packing heat”  I guess he’s been doing his daily cock push-up.  Well done KG, I’m happy for you, man.
se eu não fizer uma tatuagem na bunda com o jack numa banda e o kyle na outra até os 40 eu provavelmente terei morrido antes
Bummed. Thought it was going to be a full cover. Boooooooooo
When I saw the thumbnail, I was not only excited to hear this cover but I hoped the video would be nothing but Jables & the Rage Kage slow-mo prancing on the beach in their tights, and I'm so glad it's exactly that. Bravo, long live the D! 🤘🏼
Gold
Dude, not only the song but also the video are beautiful

2 D's having fun on the beach, with 2 massiv pair of balls

imagen going to the beach and seeing this
This voice after all these years still gives me chills! Jack Black is the true example of talent & passion.
The budget on this video must have broke the bank!!!
So proud that Bowser made it big in the music industry after his debut this year. Deserved 👏

Jack Black's current magic word is "games"
JB is such an incredible vocalist. I've been a fan for over two decades at this point. Love you forever 🩷
The Tenacious D Still Got it,Knocking it Out the Park,and really Bringing it this Year!!💯🤟

Ok. That was short. Everyone plays this song what am i missing? Is this just a play on the word game?
Ahh, was hoping for the full song 😔
so awesome
The D has once again graced my ears with the sounds of pure joy.
The Whale the sequel: The Whales looks fantastic! 🐳
I've always LOVED this song by Chris Isaak! You did a really nice job here! I love it all over again. Tenacious D, You are the BOMB 🎉
Wheres the full version??????
So who is Chris Isaak and who is Helena Christensen here? I'm gonna say Rage Kage is Chris.
Wow this is wickedly amazing
early-
WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Premiere first
Ah yes another 2 minutes long masterpiece  😂
THE D ARE BACK BABY! WHOOOOOOOOOOHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Gonna show this to my dad. Literally his favorite song.

Damn, those smiles gets me everytime!!!!🎉🎉🎉😂🎉🎉🎉😂🎉🎉🎉
omg so beautiful. This footage really captured the natural beauty of two human half-tanned babies frolicking in a pure natural beach. <3
Quiero decirte Jack que tienes una voz muy hermosa y muy buena técnica vocal. Me gusta, después de la version del grupo H.I.M con Villi Vallo, no pensé que me gustaría otra versión y la tuya es muy buena.
Such majestic creatures, frolicking in the ocean

5-year-olds when they run to the water unattended:

damn Tenacious D is making songs left and right
Just, Amazing.
Thought this was going to be the full song. Why not do the full song? Original was like 4 minutes
FUCK YEAH
Well, I waited to comment until the video was over. I've been watching you guys since I heard your first album in the early 2000s. Good to see you trimmed the beard, JB. Makes you look 10 years younger. Take some notes, KG. 😆 🤣
This video made me fill the crevasse with my mighty juice
Awesome cover 🤘

This is their time
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
forreal
This is going to be awesome

Why are the new songs so short? :( With the original at nearly 5 minutes - why is this less than 2?
A one, two, a one two three
THIS SONG ABOUTTA BE FIRE
aaaaaaaa im so exited
man
I can tell these guy never play video games
Dudes, we totally missed you.
I'm going to Tenacious D concert in 3 days so I will see them live for the first time in my live as a long time fan! I'm hyped AF!!! And I'm really excited for this song as well... the short bit they released a while ago sounds amazing!
I never wanna fall in love…. with anyone but the D!
The song is on iTunes already
the D playing wicked games with my heart
Kage Kyle ❤❤❤❤
All the love from Argentina! Can't wait for this awesome cover, better than the original! <3
Just heard the advance on Deezer, go the D!!!!
That picture tho💀
ok.
Nice to be one of the first people to listen and view of this song. If video games was good this finna be GREAT!
What… the fawk is this
Please make another movie
I am curious why they only did one verse and the chorus? Why not the entire song? I know it repeats a lot but would love it to be longer.
i just cant get enough of jack black
Can't wait!
We went from 2006 nominations to this and it’s still fire 😭💀
I ❤ UR MUSIC VIDEO OF VIDEO GAMES
*come on already!!!*
Do a full cover album!
I’m so pumped for this, just had a week of the HIM wicked game cover on replay. Cant wait to hear their version!
Came for the tenacious stayed for the D oh wait 😂😂😂😂
What is THIS!?
Are u plugged in?
That's 4 songs now with videos but no new album.  JB is retired from acting and they kept saying in their AMAZING Audible "making of the band" type thing put up with interviews and even never heard before versions of songs.  But at the end of that audiobook they kept hinting at how they have something big coming next and didn't want to spoil it but did somehow saying a new album was coming lol.  So where is it? And I hope these aren't even on it but just extras or a double album and they just have to do another movie one day
⚡️
wIcKed iN jAcK aSs- I-I- mean bLaCk
Yeeeeeees
