But. My. GT4.
Wrap the TRX
Yes
i hate irfan
You could have used the money for lumber for your house.
Just knowing whats going on in Chandler's life makes you think that Stradman is a great guy for buying back the Ferrari
0:56 james and luke enjoying their beautiful bagels people from new york and new jersey: NOT ENOUGH CREAM CHEESE
REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND TURN FROM SIN AND TURN TOWARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH CHRIST JESUS   JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK SOON AND WE MUST BE READY FOR WHEN HE COMES BACK
Buy a hallcat
RIP STRADS DAD
Anybody thought it was going to be his Audi Tt?
Why you buy cars tune them and then sell them??
That was a really expensive redline 🥲
Heyy James nice
Heyy
Buy the  Toyota Supra back
Buy the Toyota Supra and Lamborghini aventador  roadster
It’s amazing how dated the 458 is looking these days. Only feels like yesterday it was launched.
Your like Mr Beast
Thank you
13:05 LOL
How long was I gone I never knew he owned a Ferrari 458
I watched a ad and it was stradman and I'm watching this
Perpendicularly fueling ?
why did I get a stradman ad on a stradman video...
Tf stead has a ad!?!?
Stradman:  Won't cross the state line with dark window tint. Also Stradman:  Drives around town in a car with no lights, brake lights, turn signals, side view mirrors.
lets go 1 of my favorite cars to mad u sold baby mack
Move to Florida
Resubscribed for the Italia!
Can we get the supra back too😭
his face when he redlined it was priceless
No one talking about that fact that he had a supra
did he say the f word when he ripped of the tint
Anyone else get a stradman ad on his own video? Lol
finelly my favorite youtuber and my favorite car brand merge
Idahooo les go baby
i love how there's short scenes at the end of the video
I said it at the time, was a mistake to sell the 458
Yes 🥰 I love you stratman are  You aingle
I got a stradman ad about winning a hurrican. Lol. Quite a surprise.
The Luke vlogs are super!
always gotta have to have a Ferrari!
It was you!!! I tried to say hi when you were by Starbucks/ no bettahs I had a lavender ZL1!!!
Can’t wait another Ferrari
Mad 458 Ferrari I remember you selling it I’ve been following your blog for about three years now I’m glad you brought it back but just keep it don’t sell it I’ll just keep going up in value one day I’ll be like the F 40
I completely forgot he even had that 458 before.
I own a shitty honda please strad hook me up with a 2006 or better car I hate 1998 cars
buy a Porsche
I LOVE when you are watching his vid and you get his ad about a Lamborghini
Ferrari 458 is the best present day Ferrari and the last of the great V8 naturally aspirated Ferrari engines! Congratulations!
I believe your first car was the Audi TT
You had a C8 before C8 Corvette
I love your big dog furry white fluffy dog good luck in all your adventures I've been following you since the beginning good job James
I live in Rhode Island, and we aren't allowed any tint at all, it is quite rough over here too, trust me!
James needs to buy a Taycan
You could live in any state? Your building your new house in Utah…
Love you strad
And then in 3 months he sells it to the honda dealership
Miss the supra
I have a suggestion I had another one but I forgot to comment it if I remember but one maybe you should put tank trucks back on the Lambo in the winter so at least we have something to keep us entertained lol keep up the good content
Why wouldn’t you just keep the tint. Who cares if it’s illegal. I know you have had tint tickets in the past but it’s just a small fine correct ?
Why  did you sell 430 challenge
You should collab with Robbie Reveira
Why would you buy back just buy a new one or new used one🤷🏿
The first thing i see when I click on this video an ad of James giving away the huracan
Make the nascar street legal so you don’t  get pulled over and plus if it’s street legal you don’t need to trailer it anywhere
James, if the tags were still for Idaho, then the tint is legal until you register it in your state.
I just seen an ad of you on your own vid😭
is the dog holding the camera
I love Oscar
the strad sip at the end
how did he get back his Supra in the thumbnail?
I hope you know what to do with the 458.  Incase you forgot. LB WIDEBODY. #WIDEBODYTHEWORLD
Stradman face looks suspect. Im guessing having more money not aways means more fun
I got a Wizza ad with Stradman before the video started 🤣🤣
Could have just put the windows down for a bit🤦
You can get window tint ya big baby, you just can't have it as dark as you want.. it's for the safety of the officer's, need to be able to see into the car when they are approaching it.
Strad's doing his take of the DDE Tire Slayer.
Yuhh wide body the world 😌😌
I got the Wizza Ad for the Lambo of Strad In a Strad Video.
You need a Lexus LFA. Best sounding V8? Check. Best sounding V12? Check. U need the best sounding V10 now
Congrats to ya getting back ya car here n still looks good so cool
I love you guys but damn, cream cheese?? 🤮🤢
Before the video I got the add for the huracán
Why don't you tint the driver and passenger side windows 43% like the Utah highway patrol that pulled you over?
This video dropped on my bday and I missed it 🥲😭
💜
Buy a bmw m5 m competition  I swear it's amazing
What ever happened to the race car Ferrari
Headache because he didn't stopped zooming in and out
He will sell it again
Did I hear something unStrad-like @ 10:49
So it’s gonna be lavender!!!
buy a 400z Strad that would be nice
The end tho, I laughed so hard
Right on
Where you coming to Canada?
Your buying the  ferrire  458
Your widebodeong  ferrire  458 spider 🕷
Your buying back the  ferrie 458 spider 🕷
I thought he was getting the new Ferrari or lambo that he was running a poll on Instagram
Think 💭 it is the  458 spider 🕷
Haha such a tool
It feels so weird to now see James with a cameraman. I AM TOO USED TO SHOULDER CAM
he underestimated tesla model s plaid  😐
That add popped up about the hurican nice videos👍
The ferrari is back in the garage 🎉
Can you get another supra
Bro he’s doin ads for his own video
Is that a Porsche Tycan in the back round
Damn I just got a stradman ad on a stradman video lol
yoooooo strad i saw ur advert omg awesome
I really think a red Ferrari 458 will also suit your garage
There is freaking snow on the ground around you and you all are out there in t-shirts like it's 80° in Florida come on man!!!!
3:42 James missing "Tessa"❤️🌹
I love how you have a cameraman it makes the better
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Remember when Chandler snaked us OG subscribers and he said Stradman sold me something bad 🤣
You need another hot hatch. RS3 or A45 S
I think I might have seen James driving the 458 home on northbound I25 in Colorado a few days before he posted the video of him buying the car
Man lives in fh5
Bro I got an ad from the Stradman and Wizza for the huracan on the vid he buys a Ferrari
twin turbo?
don't worry @TheStradman this is why you will never be a shrewd negotiator like Ed Bolian or a buyer of the cheapest cars in the country like Hoovie.
James: Oyah
I thought it was the challenge car
please dont wb it
He started replying to comments , damn that hasn’t happened in years .
my brother has mk4 2003 vw gti but he got the top speed to 160 mph  and I rid in it before and me my dad and my brother went to a car show the mk4 gti
Why is your camera man zooming in and out so much??😂
HOW DID YOU RICH??????????????
What’s with the Supra in the thumbnail 😦
Can I wait till you make a video with a tesla roadster😅
Veyron is gorgeous
James, I am an long subscriber as well a truck driver over 34 yrs now. Dude, I have seen so many people lose their life on the shoulder of the road, oftentimes in front of state line sign taking pics. It is the most dangerous place you can imagine! You are one distracted or sleepy headed driver drifting out their lane away from dying! Hate to sound like a know it all but I want you to continue making content. Love the vids brother!
u need to save money for your house and your buying a Ferrari
Anyone else get the Wizza Strad advertisement before watching this video? lol
He could’ve looked out more on the price 35k+ with a bunch more miles on it and stradman looked out for him on the price I get the value is always going up but that’s foul in my opinion like he could’ve profited like 10k or just sold it back the price he got it for but 35k+ is a bit much to me 💯 that’s just me though
Dude that thing is so pretty!
Óscar looks like a fluffy cloud + this video in general made my day
Ok, I just got a strad ad on a strad vid🤣
Should never have sold it. Reading between the lines it sounds like you sold it cos dde stole your idea, yet there's still isn't done. Yours is a spyder, things always look better with their tops off 😜
Dude needs a 911 in his fleet.  I truly dislike flashy vehicles.
Uuum. Ever heard a Jaguar F-Type???😬🥵
Oh camera man???
Ferrari 458
James you can sometimes be the king of cringe
Glad you kept the kit
just got stradman ad on stradman video
I know I’ve watched this video before. But it had a different name and thumbnail.
Was hoping the Ford GT was coming back
https://youtu.be/DGwZE5qy30Q
And just like that we are back baby with a Ferrari Sf90 😂, god bless you james!
tesla sucks
James personally I think you should buy a mk4 supra and make it the GTRKILLA
Bruh changing the title be like:
Me just hoping the supra comes back
The most stupuip build ever done
Nah
I got an add for his lambo giveaway before the video
Nice! Can't wait to see the build!
id just have kept the bill of sale handy and rocked the window tint for a while.. Tints no bueno here to but if you have the bill of sale you can usually get away with it for a week or two after purchasing the car
It's funny how no one listened to the ending 🤣
Twin-Charge the TRZX
He should widebody the 458
Funny how I saw the stradman ad before the video lmao
What about the gallardo?
I got a stradman add while watching a stradman video
Where is the fucking gallardo bruh, it’s been years
Gotta be the Ferrari
Bro he needs to get a hellcat or sum
Buy a supra back
Don't change the color scheme.... Triple Black 458 spiders look sick..
Best sounding V8 and V12 togather.... I'm waiting to see your vlog buying best sounding V10 that is Lexus LFA the trio will be mind blowing ❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely hated the part where James and Luke are eating the bagels
I still remember the 458s from 1 year ago
I am going to be the one to say it ‘lime green’
Stradman should look into creating his own wide-body kits.
the 458 is actually my dream car . glad you bought that👍
So when do we start working to repeal the Tint laws in Utah James?  I am in.
0:01 what a way to start a video
No more Wizza yes. Please get rid of that Lamborghini and Wizza for the sake of your lively hood
damn i thought it would of been the focus 😥
Your old c8 would be cool next to your wide body c8 as well
Bajajajajajaja the end is so funny xd
(sorry I'm late to commenting but) Welcome back 458 Spider
Omg please do baby blue and white wheels on the wide body 458 ❤️
Re buying a supercar you sold, stradman stuff
Haven't watched you in a jiff need to catch up 💪 atleast I know you good 🤙
He put more then 35Gs back into the car it sounds like so you good
Do the wide body kits hurt the value of the car in the years to come???  your cutting the shit out of the car and now it’s not original just wondering if anyone knows
Can't believe he is selling a classy Ferrari to buy a crappy Tesla
Its better when you have a camera man strad! Keep it up
Take it as insane is holding the camera in the truck 😂
Is the raptor sold?
bro dont sell cars and buy it again i don't mean it in a bad way but too
I have watched since you bought this ferrari 458 i loved it i was hoping you'd buy another ferrari
Bro name a time where you find James not smiling  Exactly you can’t  He always has a smile on his face  Keep up the good work james
i think he buyin back his farrari
James was on crack in this video 😳
I hope the other Ferrari is a LaFerrari.
Where is the orange lambo
Widebody the world
Whenever my wife tells me that I have a car buying addiction, I'm just going to refer her to Stradman's channel lol
Wtf just straight ripped you off for 40k what a fake friend
JAMESSSS! You can't do us dirty like that. Can we have an approximate time the new Ferrari is comin 2 the channel. Oh btw I'm so proud of u James, you have how many cars now plus building your dream home and havin amazing friends to help u through the way. We love u, keep up the hard work!💯👌
People who wrap beautiful cars in shit Matt black are sociopaths…tf is wrong with you…
Windshield delete
I love the content in this channel
WHAAAAAT???? 😭 No infamous fist bump edit?? MY HEART!! I anticipated it in my head.....And then....😔nothing!
I’m still wondering when the Gallardo is coming back
The window tint was the best stunt he’s had in awhile
Sir where is your Lamborghini Gallardo ?
8 months later and he just might have the car painted
The next time you are in New Jersey, get a bagel and you will experience a real bagel and never appreciate a bagel outside of New Jersey
My opinion but dang that wrap is so ugly
Trader. Why a Ferrari. But it’s nice to see it back
did you hire a camera man?
The end I thought there was news on the gallardo James why do you troll me like that
Guessing the ford GT
I just saw you commercial james
Ayyy you bought my dream car
I literally got an ad of you talking about your custom huracan that’s being given away💀😭
I got a stradman giveaway ad on this video
I already knew it was the Ferrari. I just knew it and is the Ferrari maybe joining the purple fam?👀
ok so no bullshit i got a ad about wizza with stradman
You should try GINTANI tune! All your car will be super sick
Where is the Gallardo????
** WIZZA IS SHADY ** subreddit /fullscam **  James, please separate from Wizza, that business model is so shady.  I would hate for your followers to lose respect for you as is happening to Nelk right now. It is blowing up on them.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qASMjT9Kmlw
Saw that Ferrari the other day I think I love it
James your enthusiasm is sooooo contagious ! Thank You 🤴🏾🤷🏾‍♂️❤️⭐🤳🏿💥💥💥
who is filming
i dont know if youve done this yet but you should make a widebody the world shirt with all your wide cars on it, thatd be sick
Can you please paint it light blue. With black wheels
I got a stradman add lol
Love
STrad, I will buy ALL of your cars if you promise to buy it back in half a year for more money
Bro I got the ad where you were giving away the lambo on your own video that pretty funny
Widebody
what car are you buying then
Why do you eat beagles so weird?
430 challenge?????? Is that ever coming back?
Okay the editing finally has improved.  I liked this a lot better!! Keep it up
Stradman has a Hellcat?  Dude show us the goods
Is there a reason I good an ad with James in it about winning a Lamborghini
Yeah bro so happy for you
"But this isn't the Ferrari we're buying..."   Me: OH HELL NAW
POV: You got the ad for winning the Huracan when you pressed on this video.
Oscar yay
Love the channel. We are all routing for ya because we have seen were the journey started and where you are now. CONGRATS
"Like Ying and Yang."
Remember that vid you made when you and burlacker stayed at the spring mountain in Pahrump I passed that house a few days ago👌
I got an ad with you on it while watching one of your videos
I’m so exited for the wide body kit
I think it is the ferrari
You should add a purple wrap to it and black rims.
) During the first day of the World Summit on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting on September 17, eight medical experts from Europe, Asia, and North America discussed the state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting in China.  These professionals highlighted the involuntary nature and the extreme brutality of the forced organ harvesting. They also discussed the tremendous damage to the victims from the perspective of medical ethics and made recommendations on how to curb and prevent forced organ harvesting. The speakers repeatedly mentioned Falun Gong practitioners as the primary victims of the crime.   Organized by five non-governmental organizations, the World Summit on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting is scheduled to host six webinars between September 17 and 26.  Six webinars were scheduled to be held on two weekends, September 17 – 19, and September 24 – 26, during which 38 guests from 19 countries will give presentations. They include European Parliament members, a former French minister, parliament members, physicians, scholars, professors, judges, lawyers, and human rights advocates.
Help berlacker
You have a camera man??
James at the end- Good soup
You have to get the electronic window tint or on the license plate it has to end with "WT" not sure if that will work in your state.
YES I missed this car great buy keep up the great work James!!
You bought your Ferrari back on my birthday! (Yoh should rly get another supra)
Make a new video
Buy a new car
you know u made it when ur own add is on your own vid... Congrats James.
what the hell the midroll ad was still james (Wizza ad for that purple huracan giveaway)
Put tracks on the 6×6
did I hear you right it is not the only ferari
Super extra for window tint acting like a hole little girl about it
Want to get away with dark window tint in a state that it's illegal?  Get skin cancer and have your doctor write you a note requesting dark window tint. Been pulled over a few times. Flash the note and they let me go 👌
Did TheStradman just curse 10:50 lol
next vid can we have an update on the lambo in the shop for the twin turbo
James you are the luckiest guy removing window tint.  I have never had a sheet come off in one piece like that.
Only legends know why chandler actually sold the ferrari and hats off to stradman for buying it for 200k
I got your Wizzo ad on this video lmao
That cars sick tho
What does he do for work
I’m happy you got the 458 back but I was kinda hoping you were going to buy the Supra back. Anyone else agree?
If you didn’t even make any money on it barely a year ago, why didn’t you just keep it if you already had the wide body kit for it and save yourself 35k?? Pretty sure the maintenance and gas costs don’t add up to 35k on that car. At least the V8 sound really good 😍
Bro Oscar is the cutest dog ever
Hoping it was the Supra :/ but the 458 is sick!
What's the name of that wrap on the 458
No tint in new jersey
Let's just say Chandler was borrowing the car from James for a year🤣
Before watching the video, I'm guessing the Ferrari.
Can you give us a update of your dream house that is being built.
okay so whats the colour and name of this wrap? i need to know
Stradman ad?!?!!!??
Who sells a Ferrari to buy a Tesla lol
I knew it!! From the thumnail!
How about you stop by boise on ur way back and secure this Brabus 700 6x6 😎
ford focus RS?
I can't wait until James upgrades his camera to 1440p or 4k
Camera man?
i got your ad on your video LMAO
OMG FERRARIS N/A V8 IS BACK YAYY THESE LATER ARE DEFINITELY GONNA GO UP IN VALUE SOON
Whats that wrap color ???
That wrap doesn’t really look good
Matte ice white widebody 458
Can’t imagine his neighbors reactions when they keep seeing new cars 😂😂
Sorry James dude! I feel the same about Utah's tint law! Someone told me once that it's because they want to see your beer and guns.
so happy its not the c8 lmao theyre so played out at this point
hmmm i remember when i was a little kid i used to go the co-op mart (in my country *asia) to play QUTRUN arcade racing game and i alway choose the ferrari 360 spider in white .......... i wonder if you like 360 spider ?
I saw that Ferrari on Facebook Marketplace😭😭😭😭
I legit said yesterday he still had the lb kit he needs a 458 and he gets one
Maybe you finally getting the 360 stradale...!
I dont even buy cars in gta 5 that often
Bro I literally saw James' ad for the Wizza Huracon before watching this video I was so confused
no fistbump sound effect no care
I get adds about you strad
Now where is the Supra 🤨
Is it the Chaos that Panopoulos made?
Buy back Tessa 😆🤣😂😹
love the 458! great to see it back
they gave us ipads in school and the first thing i did was go to youtube and watch ur vid it was really loud and watched the video again at home maybe paint the 458 viola parsafe????
it is funny i have seen all of these cars driving around
That might be the highest parking ticket ever paid!!  He just parked his 458 in Chandler's garage for over a year😂😂..  Chandler made 35k just for storing and getting it patched up
So will you ever buy a car made in Germany?
U did him a solid, he took $35k more. I the value went up I get it, but $35k come on friends don't do that....
It's such a classy car #timeless
i was cringing so hard when he ripped off the tint.
who's behinde the camera
you need a camera man? i will do that 😂
from where is the porache taycan?
Oh my 27th birthday, you buy back the car one car I was sad to see you let go. Which also happens to be my favorite super car! What perfect timing!
I feel sad that no one remembers the all mighty  Giardo
Do a rocket bunny build
I think it’s messed up that his friend is making 35k off him when he bought it cheaper
So happy to see the 458 back and there’s another Ferrari coming. Now I’m thinking that it’s most likely a v12
Worst vlog ever. Looks like ..a breakdown joke ,🍻
That is nuts man, keep her, you already lost her once. Love the videos by the way!
homie playing forza irl with the body kits
Strad: Custom interior, widebody kit, ...   Reality: Sold after 1 Month later.
a mean coincidentally all the widebody cars are able to go top less...im glad the 458 is back lambos are my fav but u gotta have Ferrari's too
"And just like that were back baby"
lexus lfa and the widebody supra would be amazing on the channel
Stradman u think you should drive all of your cars again with your friends  in December
Make the Ferrari Rosa Acantis paint
anyone else that miss the ferrari challenger???
Would be nice if Luke talked.
gotta get a sprayed in bedliner on that TRX man
Thank god it wasn’t the Bugatti 🤮🤮🤮
You doing it DDE style
handheld...????
Don't forget to peel off the window tint ;)
better than my 03 dodge ramm 1500 with the 5.7 hemi it gets 9 mpg
What the heck i watch this yesterday but my earphone are not working so i tried watching it again and the next thing i know is that i saw this in my dream like 3:20-3:31 mins in the blog like what theeeee heeeeeckkkkk why didnt i notice it right away
458s are the absolute BEST!
go ahead and get your wheels for the build
Oh boii here we go again widebody nation strikes again 💜
I always loved the 458 glad to see it back on the channel
The zooming in/out every 3 seconds is nauseating
Anyone else hoping it was the Ford gt?
What happened to the fist bump sound effect?
today my dad's Car ls Cooler
All your videos have same content…take some time and write something meaningful. Unsubscribed
That is really bad business. You are paying more for the rope then the horse.
That is really bad business. You are paying more for the rope then the horse.
For a minute I thought you were going to buy the C8 back (as well) for Burlacher :)
So In a round about kind of way you only paid 35K for a 458SPYDER!
Was wondering what year that car is and how much mileage does it have on it. I'm looking for one trying to gauge
Hi Strad hope you and your family are doing ok following your dads passing. Love the content I’m sure he’d be proud
Tent in Utah is only illegal if your car is registered in Utah.
I dont like seeing both prospective only James one is the OG and the best
Why did James sound like a robot when he was riding in the Ferrari
bro..i dont remember you having a 458.
The moment this man buys a Koenigsegg will be insanity (Koenigsegg jesko) strad imma be commenting again when I buy a jesko in this game and turn it into a strad man purple primary white secondary and rims purple calipers and maybe a white ur purple interior
You should buy an BMW M8 and modify it
james What happened To tessa??
Can you please stop zooming in so much btw I love your videos I’ve been watching for a really long time
NOOOOOOOOOOOO GET THE C8
so how much did Chandler make again?
your cars sound so good 7:25
ANOTHER wide body?
where is the gallardo dude
LET'S GO, Stradman bought his Ferrari back
I watched one street race before it was in broad daylight and it was a m3 vs a wrangler
I really like your car collection
Man is literally building my dream car rn 🥲
when a saw the thumbnnail i was like thats his old ferrari
I miss this ferrari and im glad james bring's it back😝😝👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
Sad that ur gonna let them control you...so sad
Strad search and buy your old Audi TT it will be the memory of where you lived to start your Channel. To Your house with all your cars.
Buy your supra back
Bruh it doesn’t feel like a year and a half since you sold it
do a gt3 body kit on it
im so glad to finally see the 458 back, i missed her as much as you did
Bring back the lotus!
And just like that... Baby Burlacher is Back!
This dude be buying cars weekly and I can’t even buy one
So the car is going to be green
Lmaoo think of it as paying for a years worth of storage and a wrap 😂😂
SHAVE strad.
Those bagels look weak
cleqned should reply to this comment
I was watching ur vid and a ad of u poped up with wizlet
STRADMAN GET THE OLD FARRARI U HAD PLEASEEE
you should buy back the f430
There is a Lexus in the vid it’s at the spot where the seller lives
I think what makes stradmans channel is how he films himself!
Imagine driving down the highway and seeing a dude yelling and pointing at traffic and ripping the window tent off his Ferrari
What happen about the sf90 or f8 you thought about 🤔
Post the wide body 458 spider as quick as possible. I am waiting for it.😙😃
i guess he will buy the LFA best sounding V10 and the best sounding V6 (idk what the car) with a LBWK body kits.
I'm so happy for Ferrari 458 Spider to come back
Im waiting for the wide body
I was kinda hoping for the Ford gt
Ehhe
Is anyone questioning the merch he has on as it looks like there could be a restaurant
I was about to be mad if it wasent a Ferrari😂😂
Body kit! Body kit! Body kit!
12:57 What?!
thought it was the baby mac...
Oh yes the 458 is back
the ferrari actually cost him more than 200k once you bring inflation into account
The strand still have a girlfriend?
The repeating is grating. Holy edits.
The 458 will be green! Im calling it
13:06 🤣🤣🤣
Look at this man widebodying the while world
Bet it's the 720s or the r8
Great discussion 😊
Typical Stradman gets a cameraman and still holds the camera while driving
So we just gonna skip past that he says he loves tessa instead of Tesla
im keen to see what james does when the bug sells, i think obviously he should get a p1 but a lamborghini hurican would be next level especially the sto
"Did I buy the car because it's the best sounding V8 in the world? Yes. Yes I did." The 458 is not the best sounding V8, hell fucking no. There are way better sounding V8s.
James over here making a point to remove the tiny for UHP while dry snitchin on all those ppl drivin past in his video.
Luke is just an awesome friend!
Will you be at SEMA this year
The people of IF, Idaho love the FI exhaust!

He said he loves Tessa
Dang dude you have a super good heart. Helping chandler in this time in his life is awesome

About 2 weeks ago i had my first ride in a Ferrari it was an F8 tributo, as a life long Ferrari fan (im not a fanboy just passionate) it was a dream come true. So all i can say is that 458 is an absolute beauty.
I can see the Strad 458 and the DDE 488 on a Rally together very soon !!! 👊😎
I'm not joking I got an ad for the car on your video
Please send this to Hennessy it would be so fast
James' finally has a camera man 😂😂😂
Send it to gintani plz
I heard the other Ferrari might be an F40 😉
Shouldn’t the car be legal in Utah Bc it’s still issued in the state of Idaho? (Ex: Like it could be a car passing through Utah and there shouldn’t be a problem)?
yeahh I can I drive in all the states around me but Utah with my Idaho permit. I can drive in Canada with it to
See you bountiful hell yeah now stop at the smiths marketplace so I can was good
wait there was ad on you're video of you whattt??? a give awya car haha
Final again! A Rari! Here we go! 🥳
✊Wide Body ✊Wide Body✊Wide Body ✊
Bra this guy is just a pure example of stupid.... he complains about paying to finish his HOUSE but doesn't complain about paying extra for a car?
Lit
Wish he'd spend the money on his house!
Where's the Gallardo?
I like the feel of the vlog while Luke is filming. Plus the comedy between James and Luke on point
This blog felt more like the actual James he seemed to play a different role then normal it’s cool to see him not vlogging himself haha
I feel like the dude made stradman make this video looked forced
hahaha who else got the stradman lambo giveaway ad on this video
New camera setup 🙌
love the new remix at the end of the vid XD
Btw what happened to the gallardo
The montages is getting so much better
458 liberty walk will be sick.  The Corvette looks terrible :(
When are u jumping the trx😂
James... Peta wont be happy unless you killed Oscar... they kill more than 80% of the animals they "rescue" and couldnt care less about farm animals being killed...
When you were at Chandlers house, you let it slip that you now have two Ferraris
Love the vlogs strand, keep it up!!!
Dang that audio in the 458 is terrible lol
Buy the old c8 please
imagine james own a cazy rwb
anyone else get the add of James and the huracan
James needs to stop buying cars every video 😂
I can already see the siece and decist letter from ferrari cause how dare you RuIn their supercar!!       I probably spelt siece and decist wrong pls correct me :))))
I got wizzas ad with James during this video LOL!
Man. I contemplate spending $60 on a new video game sometimes. Lol.
you gotta paint the 458 a gloss baby blue/ teal
I actually guessed this thing coming back to the channel
Man’s is playing gta in in real life
Got a James Wizza ad about 6:38
Long time no see bro❤️
It’s crazy how much his videos have improved since two years ago
I was kind of expecting the Gallardo but still dope. 👍
That's an interesting color, I love it
OK I’m gonna say it. I like stradman . I hate widebody kits. Maybe I’m crazy, but even  the regular 458 is going to be a modern classic very soon and you’re ruining it.😢
Man i miss the 458
But did anyone noticed the change in his outro?🔥
Ok not gona lie i think u will buy ur 430. And if u acualy buy it im so hipt
Nice!!!!!!!!!!
come on... Ferrari is back
I was sad because I thought you weren't going to get the other Ferrari anymore, happy you said that :)
Ge rid of the camera man!!!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like seeing Luke holding the camera that style is Better imo
You did get a F40 👍
Please hire a cameraman. Your a great cameraman but it will make your life so much easier
I was not reading it correctly🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️  I thought it was the OG gallardo.. but it is great to have a ferrari on the garage though..😎🥂🥂🥂 Strad your the Man!!!
He bought it back on my birthday
Yess, now send it to gintani
So you give him free promo and he charges you 35k more than he bought it from you, seems fair...also dont do that with Oscar locked up in the back dude
Widebody the World!!!!! That is so sick!!!
Greatest decision of your life!!! The 458 is such a beauty! Pls unwrap the car and bring it back to its original triple black paint job
That's cool you brought back your Ferrari 458 from I hope Batman buys the create and recreates the purple army that'd be cool
Chandler’s laughs 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Yes dude I fell in love with the 458 because of him I was so sad when he sold it and now I’m so excited to finally see it widebody
This ain’t a normal stradman video something seems off……
dude i wish i could get a ride in one of your lambos or your ferrari !! that would be awesome since i live in Utah as well !!
I was born in Idaho falls
I’m siced it back!
That last clip tho 😳
Widebody the world 🔥
Yo Stradman, couldn’t you establish an LLC in Idaho and register the cars there so that technically window tint would be legal since they are registered in Montana? Also, wouldn’t have to pay sales tax! Just a thought!🤔
Looks good with someone else filming. Love the content.
Had a feeling it was going to be the 458
when is svj come
F8 coming to a vlog near you soon?
I thought he was buying an elise
he said Tessa. hmmm
The gallardooo jamesssss
tint is illegal in most states but everyone had their cars tinted i don’t understand why james thinks u can go to jail for window tint Lmao dude needs to not act like a girl so much
how would pearl white look?
White interior?????????
Widebody the world baby
Did anyone else get the lambo advertisement that thestradman did on this exact video?
So gald it’s back
Strand should buy a Aston Martin ;) Db11
Toyota Supra back
it was so obvious that you never actually sold this thing to him and hes just been holding onto it. come on man... transparency.. we already had tastes of Vehicle Virgins a couple years ago when you did some shady shit with giveaways and now you're "buying" back your car. okkkkay dude. -__-
Yo stradman ad in a stradman video
i knew it cuzmu said ur gana buy the ferrari
Sweet
Waiting for the vid where you buy the Audi TT back
I wish you still had the 360 Challenge racecar. That thing was so sick.
Bring back the Baby Mac!!!!! We need a McLaren❕❕❕
4:38 U can see space x flying ko brrr
Wheres the aventador coupe?  🥺
This is the only car that has 2 delivery videos 😂
I just saw James on a Ad
Wooow.. new remix!
No
I anticipate every single upload form *stradman* 🔥🔥🔥🔥  *WIDEBODY THE WORLD*
Bruh Oscar got so big… like if you were here when he was a baby your a legend
I am so confused house is always to much money but there is always money for new cars!
Hold up did this guys just say the best  sounding v8 no it is not  Buddy your are funny
Urus Aventador Coupe Murcielago 40th Edition TT Gallardo Veyron 16.4 Widebody C8 Widebody R35 Widebody 458 Widebody Aventador Gladiator 6x6 Ram Trx Baja Raptor Model 3 12c . Did i miss any ?
I was hoping for the Ford gt to be back
sus
cant wait to see the wide bodied 458 💜💜💜💜
I knew he was going to take the ferrarri because he was planing to buy ferrarri
I missed it
I don’t see how this channel will last, the egos and the detachment from reality will eventually become an outdated fad.. best of luck.
For a second there I thought Oscar was filming 😂😂😂😂😂    Yeah ik am dumb😂
No don,t make it a wide body
Peel off the window film ~♪
The trx is insane
Let’s go
So moral.of this video: james got a horrible deal on a ferrari and has absolutely no problem with it. Hes also buying another one because he can. Hes also adding another wide body to the 3-4 that he already has.
Oscar needs a haircut 😂
Why is he zooming in and out so much 🤣🤣
LETS GOOO
That color is so ugly!
i just got an ad with James in it lol
Get a tesla plad if you get 100,000 like
White with gold flake would look pretty cool on the 458
The only guy in the state of Utah the cops scared into removing all their tint.. lol. Love the videos !
Paint it brown
When I opened the vid it played his ad … lol . Love all your vid and cars but mostly the raptor
Another Ferrari is sf 90
tour garage pls
For a minute I thought he was going to buy the c8 thinking James was a “smart” man
He pawned it and got it back 😂
You wide body way to many cars
I just seen your add when I’m watching your video
I just went to the same maverick 7 hours ago
What is the wrap brand/name on the 458?
Well, I'm liking this video and watching ads, have to help Stradman earn those 35k
oscar is so cuuuuteeee lol
Best wrap color ever on that 458
New drinking game  Take a shot every time the camera man zooms in and out randomly    *GOOD LUCK* 💀
I live in Idaho falls and depending on the time he could have past me
You need the F1 style exaust
JAMES RACE STEFAN IN HIS RAPTOR🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
I've followed since 30k subs and watching you grow has been amazing reaching  for 4 mil
bro the trx and urus look so shit cause of the colours
When are you gonna buy your c8 back strad?
#12gallonstothemilegang
Pathetic sales man who hitted by a pandemic so hard. Even charged up the price. Cross it out from your circle Strad.
Like this so he will buy a srt hellcat charger
People living in IF sad they didn't get to meet him 😢 PLEASE HAVE A MEET IN IF I NEED TO MEET YOU
I guessed it right nice
do some downpipes on the 458
Any plans on getting you Audi TT back
I can’t believe it’s been over a year since he originally bought this car
As soon as you Idaho, I knew which car he was buying back
love the 3rd person camera angle
“No cops? *and go* ”  -Stradman 2021
American falls is full of potato farms
Why did he buy it for more lmaoooo he’s a scummy guy for selling it for more
Pls never let me hear you eat you again for the love of god.
I knew it from the thumbnail also this is my favorite car youve had
Haven’t finished his house and still buys a $200,000 car like🤔🤔
Next Wizza give away car maybe?
Bro I can’t wait for the GTR to come and it’s my dream car 🥵🥵 it’s so cool. Also I love James vibe it’s always happy and positive like sometimes I get so happy because of how he acts it’s just soo happy and positive
James, you start up a small side channel on food! Burgers, Wings and zaa! Food 4 thought.
I know I didnt see snow on the roof in October in Idaho 😭
He’s just playing forza at this point
Wait is it just me or did u guys hear it too?? Another Ferrari.... Fastforward to 8:35 ;)
You can just roll down the windows for temporary reasons
Someone tell me what happened to the Gallardo
The drag strip light is called the drag tree or just the tree
Not sure that’s a friend, he could have sold it to you for 10th and more. But hay I guess if you have it and can give it more power to you.
The question is, why is there snow on the driveway?
James we r waiting for  the new vid on strad channel
Wow I got a stradman ad on a stradman video 😭
If I were you, I would put yellow headlight tint on the 458
Real car enthusiast are not into Tesla full stop, if your are your not a true car enthusiast, your more like green woke activist
i made the old Bugatti veyron sport in a game
LETSS GOOO
mff yessss i was so sad when he sold that
How about a Liberty Walk SF90????
yo james if you are looking for some extra money, i will hire you to rip of my window tint for $35,000 looooooooollllllll (im kidding btw. i dont even own a car)
Where’s the trx jump
Who else new he was buying the Ferrari back just by the title and thumbnails
Love you James your videos always makes my day ♥️
Guessing Ford GT ????
I don t get it strad said he will buy a ferrari and he bought one And he says that is not the one. what are his plans. but love his ideas and content
Idk why but that purple looks sick on the C8 corvette
So sad to see the 458 go but the hard on swing it return 😲
are you worried about doing business with Wizza?
You are a wonderful gentleman, even behind the scene's. You father HAS to be proud. This one hit home in a very personal way. Don't move the heart, its in the right place. Keep doing you! Much love and support.
Imaging wrapping it light blue put the bodykit and new wing AMAZING
“ best sounding V8 in the world”  Mopar has entered the chat 😂
I’m from Idaho!!
All the cars need tint
Nice
I love the camera man btw idk videos just feel better
Where’s the twin turbo Gallardo mane I miss it 🥲
Damn. when he said he would be selling some cars or something like that. I hope he didn’t sell the rs! Get the st and maybe paint it a metallic dark blue and some flaps with somedark tined lights and a white rs wing with the offical gallardo rims/snowflake rims but without any tuning and that stuff. The  best year model is the 2016. Find the base model but buy it witch the tech pack and make sure it isn’t second hand.
I think pro tree was the term you were looking for 😂
Who else was hoping it was the supra
tuesday: my birthday
Why sell it in the first place just to buy the exact same car back
1:30  People named Peter: ☹️
I hate what you just did but I love your content 😭😭
I think you should buy a 360 challenge stradale
Yeah...james is. Buying another Ferrari 😙😙😙
I just want 69 likes on this comment! 🥺
Super?
You can make the corvette sound like a Ferrari with special headers and exhaust since they both have a flat plain v8
Sweeeet
Next Up Widebody Kit Install
I looked at the shadow of the car within the first few seconds I realized it was the huracan perfermante and also realized he probably doesn't get the vehicle within the video, but idk he might, it's only 30 seconds in rn.
OK there is no way a year and a half goes by so quickly. lol. Time is going so fast!!!!!
I was praying it was the Ford GT
Honestly not a fan of the 458. Actually really bummed.
How dose he have so much $😂
I got his add before this
Oscer is so cute
Why not the 812 I’m sad but I still love the 458
James is easily the best YouTuber. It’s not even close.
I really thought its the gallardo
I keep on waiting for James to get another Ferrari. Now he got the old one back and I'm like, YOOOO. I've missed this.
What’s funny for me is the 458 was the main reason I started to watch his vids then he sold it and I stopped watching and now after a year he is finally gonna finish the wide body kit for it
Get a new supra again
i just had 2 stradman adds before a stradman video
11:12. LMFAOOOOO he's illegal.  Dude just get average tint & not limo
i am guessing thats not gonna happen
i literally saw your own ad in your vid lol
No purple and no white wheels pls
James in the ad, I can see every ad of strad in a video
I got a strad add on a strad vid
Why did he over pay so much
$25,000 not $35,000.
Getting a wizza ad with none other than James talking about the perfermante
Looks great!
Hey!!! He uploaded on my birthday <:)  Thanks James <:)
-_-
812 superfast for sure
how ironic is it that i get a stradman add whall going to watch stradman
@ 11:00 well then move.
I'll be your 📸🤳 guy for $10 an hour, stradman?
James should sell the veryon and buy all the car he sold should he ?
He got the Ferrari back
Lets gooooooooo
Get a Maserati then get a widebody kit for it
Order wheels now.
Any one else get his ad about winning a huracan performante before the video started too?
tell me why i got your wizza ad at the start of ur video
i have an exam today but nothing stops me from watching stradman 😎😎
Can we bring the supra back 2?
I got a stradman add on a stradman video
Last scene, james just like, drinking so much coffee idk if that is coffee tho But he's still the best male vlogger
Wizza
Are you buying a la Ferrari 🤣
SIR STRADMAN DROPS A VIDEO AND EVERYTHING STOP CAUSE THIS FAN HAS TO WATCH !!! SOOOOOO GLAD THE 458 SPIDER IS BAAAAAACK NOW OF COURSE WE TOOO ARE JACKED TO SEE YOU PUT THE OTHER LIBERTY WIDEBODY KIT TO EPIC USE !!!!!!!WHOOOOOOSH!!!!
Respect for telling us your future plans with the car!
All that and what shocks me is the snow.... 🤣
Yes this was the build I was excited for, the car I wanted growing up
Who else kinda hoped for the lotus or something else
13:05 That scene tho lol
The wizza ad with you came up before the video
i miss the rs tbh
Thank goodness!  That has honestly been one of my favorite cars on the channel in a very long time
awe man i wish it was the supra
I honestly think this newer camera sound quality and video is slightly lower than your old camera
SF 90 on the way?
I don't get the logic... Stradman complains about the house lumber and not wanting to pay more but he buys supercars every week... something just doesn't add up lol - maybe the house just isn't a priorty. If you're willing to drop money, the house can get completed asap.
The last great n/a video Ferrari  Excellent
I honestly don’t know why people dislike your videos
ITS BACK!
LOL Ed would have negotiated right down in the middle at $140,000  with his smooth talk and special touch
Next vid: starting the wide body on 458 spider
Poor Oscar :( please feed him treats
WIDE BOBY THE WORLD!!!!!!!
Please tell me he isn't gonna buy the challenge car back
So your telling me that if i buy the James's Bugatti for 1.6M he will buy it from me for 2M?? :^)
My guess was 458
imagine a widebody 458
Where is the Gallardo
DDE is like is my 488 widebody a joke to you.
Stradman should get a Model S Plaid!!!
i like it better when he's being filmed rather than filming himself
2 Ferrari's 💙
The end of the vid tho 😂😂
THAT END CLIP THOOO 😂😂😂
widebody the world
Poor Oscar in the crate in the truck :(
omg I missed this car so much
Bring back the purple army
It on trending
He's ok with paying 35k more for a car than what he sold it for but he's holding up his house build because of lumber costs.   Glad to see he has his priorities straight (not sarcasm).
Awesome Ferrari - nice colour too.
Let's be honest, we all had a feeling that Strad was wide bodying that 458 before he said it
Legend has it, Oscar had the TRX keys 🤷‍♂️
YES!! YOU BOUGHT BACK MY FAVORITE CAR THATS LOUD AF!!!
Everything is worth more now... better off owning tons of vehicles than having cash in the bank losing value.
This angers me... why.
All of the cars in the collection getting a white body and color that's going to be crazy
I got a AD of TheStradMan while watching TheStradMan
Please get a trackhawk and build it 😀
YO YOU DROVE PAST MY SCHOOL
that dog looks like a floor mat lol
the moment i clicked on the video im greeted with your ad for the huracan! also love the content keep up the good work James!
wHeRE iS mY mOtoRbikE?
Ben Hardy who is also,your friend, drives a TRX and did several videos on Chandlers cars including, the 458 that you wouldn't let him drive. Now you are buying the 458 back that you never should have sold in the first place and you still won't acknowledge Ben at all will you.
God damn i always thought back about the LW Bodykit that you never installed on the 458 and now it‘s happening! Can‘t wait to see your taste flowing into this project!💪🏻
Finally!!! Gosh man I've been waiting on a new video for too long bro lol keep up the exelent work brother you're a true rule model!!!👏🏼🔥
I thought he was going to buy back the gr
My twin  trbow is destroyed because  I was a third mering kore in the US army  and my wife reckt it  she is in trubool because she is going to have to pay for it and I need it bad I do not have a car please I need it bad please give it to me  how much for it I minn you seed it was for free please give it to me I'm  begging you
This man gonna have a garage full of widebody cars and no wheels
Who also got James on there ad?
I wanna see strads Ferrari widebody and Damon from DDE widebody cruising together
Cant wait for a 1000hp widebody 458 "gt3"
WHAT JUST HAPPENED  I GOT A STRD AD WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO     FBI Agent hello
I just got an ad with James in it will watching his video. Lol
Just got a ticket in illinois for tint. Limit is 35% and such baloney
You should get the Ferrari challenge back
I was watching his own add for like 30 seconds before I realized
What happened to the 430 challenge
So happy he bought it back! I used to have a F458 way back now i've got a R34 as a weekend car although tempting to get another one!
Was that snow on the ground??
I got an ad of stradman and thought it was the video 🤣🤣😂
Not really a good friend you gave him a great deal and he sells it back to you for 35k more.
Wide body 458 spyder BABY
i love how another guy is holding the camera. its a much better vibe and style IMO I think you should keep it and it looks way more professional.
Off to jail with you.
yessss i love that car
i knew  it
I thought he was going to buy his old lotus back
You should get the 296 GTB
how good is that .. he gets to ride round in it for a year put miles on it and still makes 35 grand .. where did i go wrong .. things like this never happen to me :(
when i clicked on this video, i saw your huracan advertisemente
I want the baby Mac back
just got a strad man add on a strad man video
Imma just say that the Wrap on the Ferrari is the best looking wrap I have ever seen
Batman: *drives into Utah*  Highway patrol: *pulls him over after 10 seconds*  Highway patrol: I'm sorry sir, your car has e legal window tint.  Bat man: but I need it save the mayor!  Highway patrol: *tows car*
Damn I thought you would have bought back the 570s 😂
Hope you keep that wrap. Chandler upgraded for you (at your cost). 😜
lol, i've been waiting for your new vid
My favourite youtuber buying my favourite car😍
Widebody the world 😃🤩
LETS FREAKING GOOOOO
Wow we were in Idaho falls the same day
👍
TheStradman Awesome Video I'm glad you bought your Old 458 Spider back from Chandler and I can't wait to see the build and I also can't wait to see what other Ferrari to the channel
Race ur c8 vs his c8
buy the supra back
You’re telling me the 458’s gonna be green? 😳
You should probably order your offset wheels now!  That way you’ll have them for the build!
let me get this straight... so I'm not confused .  you bought back this Ferrari  almost exactly 1 year to the day??
The purple army is gone😫
You have totally confused me with this car purchase........You said you get fined if your house isn't complete by a certain date but you have put the house on hold due to cost.....yet you can buy a $200,000 car with plans to do a build which is going to cost even more money AND on top of that another Ferrari !?!? Sorry but this doesn't make any sense
Do entire car collection next
Was I the only one that heard him say “Tessa” and not “Tesla” 👀👀
ANOTHER FERRARI ?!?!?!? OMG HOLY COW
Get the 458 tuned by gintani :)
Who got a ad about stradman lol
Strad man we need to pull over before Utah and take off the tint , Clayton we need all this vehicles limo tinted 😂
Next episode selling the supercar
Hey strad.....fyi.....that tint is illegal in Idaho too bro! You can only have like 20 percent in front
Real question is did he find the key to the TRX?😂
Who else got the ad of stradman on his own video😂
Damn. Oscar is getting big
The last clip of you drinking 🤣😂😂😂😂 #WeLoveJames
I was waiting for this day
I got a add that has him on it and im watching him
lmao your ad was on before this video
Glad to see the Ferrari back in the garage. Definitely worth the extra 35k.
Not gonna lie white wheels on that car and that wrap would look sokol goood
I thought maybe the Ford gt would be back
An ad with you in it was right before this before this video
Let’s appreciate how far Thestradman has come
Okay now that’s a W I got an stradman ad on an Stradman video your leveling up  I see 😂😂
Ahahahhahahahahahahha love the car
Good decision!!!!!!!!
The channel name needs to change to “wide body”... its getting old
Literally got a Stradman ad on this video. Perfect Timing.
What’s more important the mpg or hp
13:06?
Would love to see James get a mk4
Who’s Petta?
YESSSSSSSSS W CAR
Watching James’ vid and James’ add plays lmaoo
The cover photo i had hoped it would be the Gallardo.
Lol I got a stradman ad on a stradman vid noice
aint no way he selling da rarri for a tesla plad :(
Yo James, did you find the Ram TRX keys and I am so excited for the new Ferrari you will be buying
Ummmm wtf i got the wizza ad on the video LMAO
You should get the 458 tuned by Gintani! Then it will shoot some insane flames!
Best sounding v8 in the world and best sounding v12 in the world but when are you gonne buy the best sounding v10 (lexus lfa)
Chandler really did some awesome color mods to the 458. Really miss that car, glad its back!
Come to twin falls to the snake river would love to meet you
He could've gave it to you for 185,000
that last clip thogh 😆😆
im so happy you got the 458 back
Oh love that color. 👍
baby mac?
Must be nice.. my dream is to ride in one of them. Gonna have it one day ☝
why does the rap looks like poop lol
Who else got the stradman x wizza commercia before this video?
where is your gaiarrdo
Who else had the stradman add before this video
That dude that sold the Ferrari back to you ain't your friend that's so wrong you gave him a great deal he puts miles on it, wear and tear and then sells it back to you for 35,000 more
Come to eagle Idaho
I had a stradman ad right before the video
Chandler’s laugh is hilarious 😂
Galardo update??
🔥🔥
what a clip hanger
Look who finally posted
Can you get the Ferrari f430 challenge car plz
Sold it for $165k, Buy it back for $200k..... Sounds a lot like Hoovie's Garage LOL.
Bro just got a stradman ad on a stradman video
there comes my pain killer yo stradman you bring me such joy and happiness every time you post a video and I can imagine even everyone gets exited when they see your video pop up on their page. please poste more often
I'm not even joking I got an ad to win a Lamborghini by the stradman on a stradman video
Thank God you didn't buy back that piece of shit chevy
Stradman: I bought back my car for 200k Also Stradman: I can't finish building my house because I can't afford it
way  before i clicked the vid i immediately thought of the supra
2:47 STOP ALL THE ZOOMING. I can’t finish the video with the excessive zooms  Please don’t keep doing that in the future
This dude should have a legal guardian and not be allowed to manage his own money.  He's so fucking juvenile and immature.
Why does he keep zooming in and out. That’s a little excessive
You should get a car trailer, and you can tow your cars with your trucks.
Next video will be how much a new TRX key costs because they never found it.
Why not spend that money on lumber an get the house going instead ?
lets goo strad what ferrari?
458 ain’t it🤦🏼‍♂️we need another baby MaC
Sheeesh your old car so sweet
2021 Covid makes car prices jump  Stradman let’s buy everything
I bet it Supra
Stradman should get a Jeep track hawk or dodge demo to feel all of dodge factory power
For the algorithm
The colour of the 458 is so gorgeous (is it a red or purple wine) it’s beautiful 😍 *#SpiderMan*
The first stradman video I watched was him buying this car for the first time
Ummm why does it looks like there’s snow outside in the grass around 8:10 or so in the vid? Lol
i wish it was the ford gt🥺
Can we get a single old school car spotting video.💜💜
Coulda just rolled the windows down 😂 smart choice tho
Was in hospital today and wachting your and stefan's videos
Not meaning to be a hater or anything but i don't know why he has financial problems but keeps buying more cars even though he has enough
Yessssssss
Are you gonna flex on DDE
“My house isn’t done yet”…. This video almost makes me wanna unsubscribe
sometimes in life... you watch the stradman's videos just for that last 5 second cut scene
Making a prediction before I watch. It’s the Ferrari
I was so sad when you sold it man
Pretty sure the State makes the law, not th highway patrol. You have massive reach, make a petition, get as many signers as you can and submit it for change. You might get a quick win.
James on an Youtube ad?! hold up-
can i have ur dog
did james really just self promo his ad on his own video 😱😱
U should also buy back the original c8 corvette and race the two
458’s are going up in value anyway soon they’ll be worth 300k
Just a random comment/suggestion  I noticed that you don't continue the videos into the credits, what if you copied the fast and furious series and left tidbits and hints at the very end of your video credits that kept us guessing more about the next video...hmmm Maybe someone's already suggested. Haha.
Lol watching Stradman and his Lambo Huracan ad lol on his video
It’s so weird to see someone recording the blog that isn’t stradman
Hmm i feel like he has the 458 widebody kit that he bought it back
I thought he got the surpa back at first
Hey James going to Vegas Wednesday where should I go first! In and out or raising caines??
Get a mk4 supra man
Me thinking it was gonna be the r8 or baby mac
i miss the 458 so much
Speeds, has crazy loud cars over decibel limit but is scared of window tint 😢 really sad it’s a $75 ticket here idk what it is there but come on
Widebody 👀👀
imma guess ferrari
maybe be will buy a La Ferrari?
James an I was playing a car game and I have the SF90 and you should really get the SF90  And since you are selling your Bugatti I think you should get a Bugatti Chiron Supersport
Strad loves everything widebody lol widebody strad girl coming soon?? Maybe?!? Lol
Omg it’s like fast and furious in 3rd person
I clicked on your vid and I did not realize it was you're ad
Ive been in that gas station
🤣❤🔥🔥
The way chandler laugh im dead
So he has the best sounding V8 and V12 so what’s next the best sounding V10
respect man, gonna have a LB GT-R, LB Aventador, and a LB 458
Is it just me or does this video feel different idk
13:07 its shots like this that don't get you laid lol
This man is wide bodying every car he gets now
I saw the stradman wizza add right before this video
James buys super cars like We buy everyday essential items
Has no one mentioned the baby mac?
Omg he posted a video we need a maybe 2 day post
If the car it still registered in another state you aren't considered illegal. So you may be ok until you finalize the title transfer. You have ripped off the tint for no reason!!
If you sell a car for $165k and then buy it back for $200k then that makes you a chump because you allowed a so called friend to screw you over.
Dear mr stradman you seem to be happy. I remember the video about your dad I’m sorry, keep rocking
Yeahhhhhhhh
Wish he wouldn’t wide body every car he gets😕destroys the car’s value…even more sad because 458’s are shooting up in value
Buy car. Sell car. Maybe do something with car.
"Their tint's illegal!  Look!"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m hoping it’s the baby Mac
got a stradman ad before my stradman vid
My guy WE LOVE YOU... can you PLEASE mount your cameras for safety reasons🙏🏿❤
Tesla are cars intended for Children
Where is the gallardo
Liberty walk wide body kit?🤷‍♂️
You have to get the C8 Z06 and compare the sounds
Hands down my fav YouTuber
super stoked to see the 458 back one of my favorite cars of all time
I love how I get a stradman ad on a stradman video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And Just Like That The 458 Is Back Baby!
10:50 Luke's life literally flashed before his eyes
Where’s the gallardo?
YES YES YES YES
Thank god 🙏
Your going to widebody it
I was hoping it was the baby Mac
What happened to your pilot liscense?
I think you had purple seats for the ferrari
13:11 LMFAO
Arizona is terrible about tint on the front windows
Video started off with a Strad ad. I didn't notice for several seconds as I was looking at my phone when I started the video.
surely stop car's for a while to finish house ?
Stard is the tyoe of person to sell a car to buy it back to widebody it
The WRAP is sick.... as in COOL...
I think it’s time for a hellcat build
Yo we need a Daniel Mac collab
I'm not mad at this purchase, This one I'm excited for😂💣
Make this one for your mom
It was so sad to see that car go, I’m so glad you got it back, can’t wait to see how sick it will look with the body kit…. great move James, congrats…
Strad, buy a small house (or shack) in Wisconsin. Title all vehicles there, cheap insurance, and you may have window tint. As you know car modification tickets aren't punishable to out of state registered vehicles. Yeah, just do that.
this was my favorite car of the collection, glad shes back
I can't even describe how happy I am that the 458 is back. I was so sad when he sold it.
Wide body the world. Strad loves the wide bodies.
I honestly missed her. Think that makes your garage
What happened to the old Ferrari f40 the ogs will remember
What camara do you use
Twin turbo it🐌🐌
Where can I get the shirt you got on?
I really hope you buy your old Elise. I started watching when you got that car and it’s still one of my favorites
Ok before watching the video I’m gonna hope and pray it isn’t another Lamborghini Edit: YESSSS MY SECOND FAVORITE CAR EVER
It’s just look like a baby pagani to me 😏 12:06
LMFAO STRAD, the window tint scene was genius at the border!!! OMG
Must be nice to have so much money to show off.
Status update on the Gallardo?
I feel like almost every vlog is just another supercar that he is buying. I’m not complaining but he has so many cars
Love the 458
yess that was my favourite car <3
He has to much money
What happened to the NASCAR
im calling it hes gonna buy the Stradale
Please tell me its an 812😩
I literally got jameses add for wizza for the performonte as the mid video add. Lol
When do we get 4k vids?
It’s so weird to watch a stradman vlog where he is not holding the camera
Never been a flat plane V8 fan, C8 over 458 anyday!
I just got an ad with you in it. :)
Could you bring the,  in n out shirt back
Stradman is def getting a Z06 when it arrives....i can already see it in the cards
KEEP THE FERRARI STERD PLS!!!!!!!!!!
Don’t even have to start, automatically know it’s the corvette.
Racing with a dog in the back? 👎🏻
None of stradman car is safe from being chop up lol
imagine if chandler buys the car again after the wide body kit
Oscar is a walking cloud ☁️
Buy your old tt back
The liberty walk needs to be aqua/teal
It’s my birthday today and I couldn’t get a better birthday gift than this 🎉
The last naturally aspirated V8 Ferrari made and it's back what a happy day when you can redline at 9,000 RPM😎😎
James>>>>>>
As much as I love the super cars, I think we need some JDM on the channel 😁
Did James say he likes Tessa, not Tesla???
He’s getting a stradali
It's called a Christmas 🎄
6:06 time stamp of myself
Im watching this and I just saw an ad that James was in where he’s partnering up to sell the huracán we saw not to long ago 🤣
imagine he bought his old r8
When i saw the thumbnail i was like WHEN DID HE HAVE A F39
Next up beast v10 sounding car in the world
Widebody the world 🌎
Best sounding V8? Trying out a E92 M3 or a W204 C63
Goto the doctor and get exempt from window tint
Nothing but wide body kits…… yea
I think strad is buying an F8 Tributo?  🤔
When the high way patrol targets one citizen, it's kind of messed up
So weird to see you in a commercial right before your own video. LOL
Ferrari 🤮🤮🤮
james the type of guy to widebody convertibles instead of coupes
Thats gonna be the maddest build u got visually
Who else wanted him to buy the Supra back?
Didn't he call you out on Facebook last year and say you sold him a bad car and ripped him off???
Who is the camera man
BRING BACK THE TOYOTA SUPRA
i got the wizza lambo givaway add before this vid lol. didn't skip
Idaho plates lol
James has more cars than the dealers around my city 😂😂
Man I miss that Ford GT, glad to see the Ferrari 458 back
Anyone see the ad from stradman
Got the omaze ad on the video for the performante
Umm so another ferrari coming okay okay 😁😁
Dark tint is not allowed in Alberta too. Cops will key it up.
I miss the Gallardo so much
Can you please get a new camera with stabilization on it? Those pan/zooms  lol  Great to see the Ferrari back and can't wait for the next one. Me personally love the 488 Spider. Keep living the dream James awesome stuff
james should start a petition for Utah Law makers to get rid of that bs window tint regulation
I think U should buy toyota supra mk4
Make your corvette purple
When can we see a whole car collection
YAY BABY she's back
Buy the supra back
Me hoping it was a McLaren
Widebody the world
Back to the early Christmas tree!
I’m not going to lie the videos look so cool when your not holding the camera like when you have someone holding the camera for you and following you it seems like a show idk it looks really cool
We need the fist bump sound back. It just feels wrong without it.
Knew it’s gonna be the 458! One of the best budget supercars ever! Love love love the looks. I remember you sold the car
James hates Tesla because is sounds like Tessa 😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂
Saw one of theses irl they don’t sound as good as a svj but it still sounds really good.
1:26 what

YES YES YES YES YES!
I have not seen this Channel in a while
I was praying it was the baby mac
This project is gonna get sooo GOOD Strad :D
SO UR BUYING ANOTHER FERRARI HUH?
I'm pretty sure if it has a out-of-state plates the window tint won't matter.
Please keep these type of vids up w someone else filming
Such a nice video :D  so fun see the interaction with the other guys as well :)
Was kinda wishing it was gonna be the c8
Wide Body the World!!!!
Lovin' that color wrap on the 458
Dhar mann
Wait do you have the other Ferrari from makes and models
In the middle of the video there was a Stradman commercial so I   did not skip it
U have to buy one of "Goonzquad" cars , the have crazy builds☺️
14129 para adams drive salt lake city utah
So im watching the vid and I GET AN AD WITH STRAD IN IT TALKING ABOUT A LAMBORGHINI HURACAN PERFOMANTE😂🤣😂
So many cars
What about finishing the house?
Chandler posted so I’m guessing it’s the c8. With my luck it’s probably the 458
The wide body is back
She's back
Widebody Ferrari??????
OK, that makes a whole lot of financial sense.
You should let Hennessy tune your T-rex😈
I got your add on your vid
Okay.... The end theme song changed a bit 😟
Seriously, stradman's over in Utah complaining about the 43% tint limit. 😂 But it snows in Utah! And i'm over here in Australia where it dosen't snow and it dosen't get very cold and its always sunny. But the legal limit over here is 35% lol
Get in touch with EAG in Texas, they’ve been talking about a 458 manual swap since 2019..... I’m sure they’d love to work with you.
Now I'm getting strad Wizza ads. Cmon bro do your research about your sponsors and who you endorse
Next the supra
i just  saw your ad pop up
Maan how much money does Strad have? He’s buying cars, I mean supercars left and right
i SAW UR AD
Best sounding v8 is mustang GT500 but that Ferrari tho sounds good to. You should try to have and wide body à Shelby super snake. Thst would be awesome
I SAWUR ADD
A cámara man for the first time
Glad to see your back!
Could’ve bought the wood for the house my boy
Not going to lie I was praying for the ford gt I loved that car
Is your gallardo gonna be done soon? I know I butchered the spelling but that’s a question we all have
Your houses have the same exterior layout, down to the side R.V. pad. They look like the same house.
nice your finish the wide body you and DDE should meet up in your wide body 458 and his wide body 488
Who else sees those stradman ads?
He’s gotta sell the Bug 😂
Love seeing the 458 coming back! That car sounds so crazy! Also, i sorta like the way this video was filmed.
You've got to order a tesla roadster founder edition
Imma guess the R8
Come on man, all the stupid stuff you do when you’re driving but don’t get caught, and you wanna cry about tickets for window tint? I think you’re probably still way ahead
gotta have a pony in the stable
I got the add before the vid wtf
Thought it was gonna be the mclearen
We just want the Gaillardo back😓
The zooming in in this video makes me car sick. Lol
Are you serious did you just rip off the tint to avoid a $20 Fix-It ticket lol I would have kept it pushing nine times out of 10 you would have made it home no problem
Window tint laws are stupid. I can understand how 5% tint can be slightly dangerous at night. Especially on a front windshield. But anything over 20-25% should be perfectly legal. It’s just another form of control and a money grab for the state.
A good eye dr will write you a window tint RX then they can’t say anything
This style of vlog is different, it's more relaxed and I love the different perspective of having the cameraman. I like it 👌 👍
Strad literally said Tessa at 3:45. Maaaan Strad I feel you
I’m loving the direction your channel is taking. These builds are so great to follow, you’re turning your cars into true Stradman vehicles! Keep it up!
Should've bought a mclaren
I got a strand an ad and thought it was the video oof
Is there anyone else who can just tell what cars it is by looking at the way he blacks out the car in the thumbnail?
One of the best videos in awhile!
Wide-body the world baby!!! 🙌
who else got a stradman ad just asking
Love how he just lets his mates drive his Ferrari
Nice sound😇
i got a ad of strad saying that i can win a hurcan before the vid started
Pov: you have waited long for him to upload.
You’re in bountiful
LoL the Tesla plaid will smoke all you're overpriced supercars!
Please put Work wheels or BBS with the rocket bunny kit
I'm not jealous that he owns so many cars, I'm just jealous that he has $200k in the bank to buy any car he wants. Maybe I am jealous that he has all those cars. Dammit James I'm jealous
Havent watched the video yet but im gonna say its the supra
I’m smiling for you
Buy an E63 amg s
Actually with Idaho plates on they can’t pull you over and fine you for tint. It’s legal in Idaho and they can’t enforce laws like that on out of state vehicles. Just like for instance in PA you don’t have to have a front license plate. They can’t pull you over in NJ and fine you for no front plate.
u could have been buying  lumber for the house build bro
New outro?
LOL I JUST GOT YOUR AD ON THIS VIDEO ABOUT THE HURACAN GIVEAWAY LOL
TAKE THE TRX TO HENNESY
not a bad deal... your mates loans you 165k and takes your car as security and you pay him back a year later with %21 interest 😉
i live in idaho falls i wish i couldve seen you AHH
Itb swap on the 458?
You gotta get a two car enclosed trailer for the trx
What is that wrap it is gorgeous 😍
Not a friend if he sells car back an asks for more $$$
F8 on the way!!!
lol, i click on this video and i got strads wizza add bout the lambo giveaway
JUST PLZZZZZZ James?? Get a spa back
That button your taking about that does launch control the image is called a Christmas tree that what we call it in the drag world
Ferrari fans be like::Yes,, James listened to us Lamborghini fans::Bro we know you gonna sell the coming Ferrari just to buy a Lamborghini Huracan 😹
Bro this time 3 years ago you started the widebody supra
Where is otenge aventadore
James eating is the new asmr standard
Just the other day I was watching the video when you bought the 458 the first time, and I was thinking to myself he should buy another. A few days later and here we are
Camera man?! Luke
10:50 fuk
Imagine the 458 with a wide body cotton candy rap (blue/pink)
It’s the r8 calling it
I miss the focus rs ngl
bro james partnership ad with wizzo was the advertisement when I clicked the video hahaha
buy back your ford gt or buy a new one and wide body it
Make it gt3 widebody kit
You like Tessa?
So glad james bought his ferrari 458 back so he can complete his widebody build on it Welcome back ferrari home sweet home 😊💯
Where back
I miss the Supra and the 430 challenge so much
I love your videos
ur on a ad
ma boi gettin a camera man
its hilarious to me when you have someone filming for you the videos have a ton of blurry spots, but when you film yourself its rarely ever blurry (sorry, im a camera junky)
Incoming Ferrari cease and desist notices
Got to bounce the baby off the limiter once
Obviously you have money to burn🔥.. but dude let's get back to the house build project ...  Build with as much concrete as possible..less wood.👊
Got the strad hat on
i think he should keep that wrap on it and just widebody it
Honestly even after a decade, I still kinda prefer the looks of the 458 compared to the 488 and the F8.
The videos just gets better and better
What if he bought back the Ferrari challenge car. That would be awesome in the skittle army!
Looking forward to the 458 build. Wide body the 🌎
Where Is a GTR?
I know why they do not get puked over.it is because they are not driver supercars unlike you
Yo i know u might think this is lame to say but u should get a imported JDM car 🤔🤔🤔
that wrap is insane...does anyone know the name?
Buy a sf90
Glad to see it back
Imagine disliking one of his vids.
its all fun and games till Ferrari sends you a cease and desist letter
Stradale coming to the Chanel sooner than you think!
Not holding the camera himself this vlog 😳
i really forgot about the ferrari but she’s back baby😝
stardman
Please keep the color 😍😍
Change the wrap please…… love the car but not the color……
buy hi sell lo
BRO I JUST HAD AN AD FROM STRADMAN AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE VIDEO XD. it was a wissa one or whatever and it kinda scetched me out for a sec
Why not start a LLC in Montana and register the cars there that way your cars only have to meet Montana registration and you can tint your windows
I forgot to say I love the 458 and I’m exited for the build.
Dude what's with this guy zooming in and out all the time ,worst filming
WIDEBODY THE FUCKING WORLD GO PURPLE ARMY 💜💜
WIDEBODY  THE WORLD BABY
Stradman 1 wk ago: 400k for lumber iz 400k less For house * Randomly buys another supercar*
Now you need to best sounding v10 in the world.. the CARRERA GT!!!
What happend to his girlfriend?
A CAMERA MANNNN
He sold his 6x6??? Damn I don't remember that
I KNEW IT!!
How is no one talking about StardBurger?
The ending lol
Crap… he said he is getting another Ferrari…. does this mean that we forget the STO??????????
bro stop zooming in and out
I was kinda hoping it was the Ford GT
Not gonna lie, I was hoping it was gonna be the V8 R8 and that it would still have the ski box
Nvm
I think your theme song has been remixed. Maybe it’s the head phones I’m using that makes it sound different.  I watched a video last night titled, super cars you didn’t know existed. I think if you were to buy one, you have the reputation to change the landscape of the super car scene. Everyone buys the mainstream super cars but these other cars are just as beautiful and powerful. Either way I feel like I’m a fan of yours 4 life.
Alright, the 458 is cool and all, but it didn't arrive by helicopter...
Was it necessary to include the part of you slurping? Sorry but my misophonia kicked in.
Baby Mac. Baby Mac. Baby Mac. Baby mac
He probably bought it back just cause he couldn’t sell the wide body kit😂he’ll install it then sell it I commented it before he said it lol
You got the best sounding V8 and v12, now you only need the best sounding v10 😜 the Lexus LFA
Strad said his 458 had 530 horse power. They actually have 562bhp and with that exhaust it’s probably closer to 600
WIDEBODY THE WORLDDDDD
I wonder when ut actually gonna do something to the engine
wow
She back and were going to widebody the world
Strads for kids
i love how i got an ad that has james talking about the huracan on a video by him, lol
Its still night time in our city Dubai
Why did I see this coming
The 458 has the wrap I've posted for James to get about 15 times...
What do you mean it's not the Ferrari your buying
man wasnt kidding when he said "widebody the world" lmao
Can we get that wrap color?
I knew it from the title that it would be the Ferrari.
Nice going Strad
Do you still have the wide body kit ?
The constant zoom in and out is really annoying, you don’t need a camera man James
You're a good man Strad!
Why don't you twin turbo any of your cars
If I had an amazing car like that I personally probably wouldn't sell it to someone knowing the person buying it was going to hack it up to tack on a body kit. I don't think Ferarri would either but to each his own. Whatever floats your boat.Views on views I guess. You know I'll still be watching to see the end result.
Lets gooo
Actually wide body it but don't change the exaust
I thought he was buying his c8 back
Actually maybe
DONT WIDEBODY IT
He's gonna sell it next week lol
I LOVE THE 458
Shoulda spent the $200k on the lumber to finish your crib bro 🤷‍♂️ I’m sure $ isn’t really the issue tho lol 😎
Hey I'm from Idaho
I jumped when he said I’m buying it back
Stradman u need to buy all your cars back.
you paid him 35k to drive your car for a year 🤔 lol
I cant understand that hes still buying so many cars yet doesnt want to pay the extra money to get his house done
2022 is starting to sound like a good year for james. Gallardo will(hopefully) be back, more widebody cars, house might be completed, and (maybe) a new hypercar!
Me and Strad are the same; I just buy and sell all my cars on GTA5 not irl
Another ferrari coming
i want bigmac back:(
You know,I completely forgot he said he was buying a Ferrari😂😂
I hope to never hear you drink any fluid EVER AGAIN! That was disgusting!
I like seeing both perspectives of James holding the camera vlog style, and having someone holding the camera for him higher production style! I think he should do it more.
I just got your ad on your video lol
Palos will be so excited you uploaded.
Who showed him wide body cars
Starting the video with Oscar The Floof. Couldn’t be a better intro.
You should buy a Porsche taycan
James back to wide-bodying the world
I KNEWWWW BRO THAT YOU WILL BUY THE FERARRI BACK!!! CONGRATS BROO!!!
458 is one of my forever favorite cars! I like the hard top but what a sexy car.
Wide body fararri
I’m mad it’s not the 430 challenge
I really think he should keep that wrap it looks so good
I know you like bright colour cars but how about a nardo grey 458 with like bronze wheels or something
I swear to you I clicked on this video and got an ad of strad and the purple lambo
It was so amazing and I know you absolutely loved it
Do I have a camraman
Buy a SF90
PLZ PLZ PLZ GET A SUPRA GR BACK
James is always so full of surprises
I was just in Idaho
Gutted when you sold this!  So good to see it back!
I just noticed that someone else is holding the camera for you
wait then what’s the car in the thumbnail?! :OOO
I clicked this video getting a stradman ad about the Performante, what a coincidence
I got a stradman add on his own video
Why most of the vids you upload lately is kinda wavy. It's kinda annoying and hurts my eyes
James can you buy a G wagon please 🙏 I just loved G wagons it would be really nice if you added it to the family?
Yes
So 2 Ferraris coming to vlog near you?!?! 😂
Sounds way better than my Honda Fit at 4k RPM. Who'd have thought 🤔
Make outtakes a regular thing!
I had a feeling he was going to buy it back 😂😂
Greatest quote. (We are averaging 12mpg which is good). Me in 🇬🇧 🤯🤯
Oh it's a lovely day when the 458 comes home
Wide body the world 🗺
We need the sto
I want it to de the supar
THE BABY’S BACK
I thought Oscar started filming you for some reason😂
Twin turbo 458
used to love all Stradman uploads... now days all vid:s are like alllll 3 diffrent thems... the house... some widebody or sell/bye car... just want him to comeback to his old self... neeeew contens diffrent stuff EXITING stuff ! :)
The world:"pandemic"global warming"poverty" Stradman:widebody the world
He really is wide-bodying the world 🤤
Justin Bieber’s is clean if it’s half as good as his
He's gonna widebody it 🤦‍♂️(ITS NOT A BAD THING) Keep up the good work bro
i had a strad ad on this vid
Missed the 458 so muchhhhhhhh lesgoooooo
6:43   did he just just say the Ferrari 458 is the best sounding V8 in the world   he probably forgot about american muscle for a second
This Ain't The Freaking Supercar He Freaking Bought...
James doesn't realise how many people he makes happy just by driving his cars around
Other cars: Drive safe. Don't look at the screen.  The TRX: apply full throttle...
$200 it’s the 458
I still remember the day you sold it. And now ITS BACKKKK 2:57 🔥🔥🔥🔥 5:00 the good old days
I cant wait for this build :D
Me like the new style of videography 😁😁😁
Love that car James so glad u bought it back can't wait for u to widebody it and everything
Make a project jdm car
omg idk if you saw my comment or not but i said get a 458 widebodied liberty walk
Baby back ay
As soon as I saw the thumbnail, I knew this was coming. This is my all time favorite car, congrats James🔥🎉
Is there a fine? Why not keep till you get pulled
Im in Europe right now more specifically Belgium. I wish I was in Idaho  when you came. :(
supra
He bought the rolls Royce back
I got the wizza ad
This was my favorite car
Just relized I was watching before he got the Ferarri
Idk if the f8 lambo that tavarish is selling is still up.. but maybe.. just maybe?!?!?!? You are interested in it?!?!?!?
no way he bought a stradali
I just got the stradman wizza ad on this video
I don’t know man, my v8 sounds amazing also!
I own and ride superbikes because I can't afford a supercar! But the benefit is that I can absolutely smoke a majority of your cars up to 190mph.
458???
PLEASE keep it and don't widebody it :(
Nice video
Nooo keep the 458 stock 🪦
Yes it’s back
I thought it was the 430 challenge
chandlers messed up for the upcharge tho
Most Chrysler vehicles they will start as long as it is in the fob is in it but, it will not lock while its running or when the engine stops running and you exit the vehicle.
0:20 Oscar is a pretty good camera man ngl
Wide body the world
I hope strad buys a la ferrari!
Post credit scene
Honestly this is still one of my favorite ferrari's in existence was very sad he sold it then. Glad it's back
Glad to have you back we all missed you
So pleased to see the 458 back.  I was actually really ticked off when he sold it.
So stoked you got a Ferrari on the channel even if we seen before
Can we stop the widebodies please
I love that James carries Oscar like a big ol' baby
James u gon upload on ur strad channel? Ur vids are twice as funny on that channel
"Did i buy this car because it's the best sounding v8 in the world? Yes i did." Burlacher in his Shelby- "Care to repeat that statement?"
TheStradman the best dumbest car buyer in the world LOL🤣🤣
Ferrari's are truly works of art!
I’m scared he’s gonna sell the Gallardo
Next build should be a widebody tesla and widebody 458 Spider
the outro <3
Great video I’m glad you got the one that got away
Green 458??
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !
We are still buying a Ferrari 💪💛🤝
buy a new supra
Please do the same pink as your dads Lambo and dedicate it to your mom.. she would love it
Oscar is now a cloud he used to be a small boy
James, don't tap the gas nozzle to put in that extra drop. It can create a spark and start a fire and you will have views on views.
Oh I fell sorry for you stradman
Best decision you have made in a while
Now that I think about it I really miss the supra
Stradman... can’t afford to finish my house build right now... also stradman... I’m buying another super car...
Nope audi r8 v8 manual is the best v8 sound
It hurts to see him rip off that tint 😭
What about a verde ethica ferrari
Not stradman saying javing
Utah have many strange laws, but also strange delaying house built due to prices on timber, and at the same time getting a overpriced car
It will be more looking good if you put chassis mounted wings bro. 👊😎
green liberty walk ferarri 458 it won be done till january at the latest mark my words
Needs Fi headers
Pleaseee don’t cut up a Ferrari bro, I’m pretty sure that’s a sin
a honda dealer
Never should have sold it anyway
Can't wait for the Novitec 812 n-largo to arrive!
Not gonna lie i like this type of strad vlog where hes got a cameraman. Anyone else
So there will be another Ferrari on the channel. Madnessss 🤯
Zooming in and out sucked!!!
Ighgt
I was hoping that Strad didn’t get a full time camera person. Totally changes the videos and seem less personal.
After the body kit, u will sell it for 250 because you got bored and after 1 year u will buy again for 290 :))
when i clicked on this video the add to win the huracan perf came on and i thot it was the real video
wish you bought back your audi tt!
I feel like James is gonna buy the 430 back now 😏
Okay so we heard 300 times to this day i sold ot and bought it back.....
YESSSSS
Oskar is such a beautiful dog. I see what you did there james 🤣 Just don't potato your chances of getting back from Idaho 😅😅
loved the energy in this vlog james !!!!
Please. Stop. Wide-Bodying. Literally. Everything. You. Own.   I'm calling it. Give it a couple months and Oscar will be wide-bodied as well
Now u need Is the best sounding v10 in the garage
Vlogs Feels kinda weird with a cameraman 😂
Did anyone else get a stradman ad for his lambo?
And just like that Oscars back baby
Strad… don’t get caught up in the Wizza problems. They claimed to give away a “Full Send” 458, but was rigged. Nelk bros are involved. Wizza goes back to his company. Get out now.
Bruh just got an add about Lamborghini with James in ut
Please tell me you got a camera man just for this video cuz I’m used to you holding the camera idk it’s just stradman thing
Anyone noticed when he says I like Tesla, he actually said I like Tessa??  Lol
Next video, widebody 😂😂.
Very very very long shot but are you buying Gage’s LaFerrari?!? Please say yes
Congratulations! Can't wait for the build! You and your vids always put a smile on my face! Thanks!
what happened to the supra? i don’t think jeffree has it anymore
Every time i hear just like that where back i get so excited
We need Luke more on the channel
James I have a suggestion for the colour for the 458 I think I should be yellow
Why was Oscar in a cage?  He usually rides in the cars normally?
So I know it was gonna be this car (no spoilers) because it made sense but the ending caught me off guard. I'm pumped
Widebody incoming…
That's a really really really good wrap.... 👍🏻
I live in the city where u got that bagel
Hoping it was the supra but 458 is fine
I am excited to see the 458 Build, imagine that thing with new Headers, also I wonder how a Ford GT back on the channel would be
You are the best youtuber I wish I could meat you.
Just imagine living in the neighborhood that Stradman lives in
Bro love your videos but pls buy a better mictofone
I think putting a widebody on the 458 is too much, it ruins the car imo, the car is already good by itself.
Widebody the World
Can’t wait for the wide body build to begin, glad to see you back.
The ferrari 458 is soo coollllll nowsww
How much did he buy it back for?
Drag race the Trx with the corvette
Stradman better buy a new Corvette C8 Z07. Faster and more powerful than the 458 and a lot less money too.
Do you have any idea how little that narrows it down
Worried about the tint but cruising at 90mph 😂
Please be the next title "buying another one of my cars back (supra)" 🥲🥲
How is a car like this even at a Honda dealership? Lol
The very end clip of the orange juice 😭😭
Damn this was a great surprise also he said that he’s buying another one as well so I’m ecstatic to see how that goes. Just imagine the garage then. WideBody GT-R, WideBody C8, WideBody 458, another Ferrari, Aventador Coupé, WideBody Aventador Roadster, TT Gallardo, Murcielago, literally my dream garage (I know I missed some but there’s just too many so 😂) plus you should definitely look into getting a STO that car is so sick. Stradfam definitely needs a STO
nah man it just doesn’t feel the same when someone is filming you
how can you afford finishing your house when you buy & buy more cars?
Hey James, the auto stabilization is kinda looking bad. When I look at the edges of the video, the world just warps here and there. Like pans wide and back which is really distracting. If its not the stabilizing, then it might be the "keep subject in the center of the shot" feature.
So Stradman leased it to Chandler for -$35,000?
Dude, that is exactly what I do whenever I drink a cold ass glass of OJ
Dig the new outdo song.  Same song but more bass.  Hella cool
Me: sees the ad for stradman  also me: OHHH im slow i thought this was the video
Man we surely missed you!
I missed you in Idaho Falls DANG IT
2 weeks later: im selling the 458…
how was that a year ago omg
Stradman is really widebody'ing the world
The camera perspective missed 😔😔
Wizza is a SCAM! Look it up. The Nelk bros have done this before!!
The 458 has in my Opinion the Best V8 Sound ever. For a Sportscar ofcourse
I thought he said I like Tessa 😔. Sorry to bring that up btw
WIDE BODY THE WORLD YA BUDDY
PLSSSSS BUY A 1998 TOYOTA SUPRA
YESS!! I was so sad when you sold this car and never did the wide body kit. So glad this is back one of my all time favorite cars
Where is audio
Eat sleep Repeat
35k is nothing for this millionaire
Me early yay its 2AM in the morning
Never thought I'd be able to say I own the same vehicle as strad... welcome to the trx family
im an og what about the 2002 audi tt?
YOUR FENDER FLARE KITS ARE A LITTLE TACKY STRAD KICK IT UP A NOTCH , MAYBE MOLD THEM IN OR GO ANOTHER DIRECTION , SAY A GT OR A TRACK CAR APPROACH IDK.
YAAY 458 The wrap tho 🤮
I wanted james to get the sf90 stradale, its my favorite car, but i dont think he will, but all ferraris are cool
Where tf is the gallardo man
The ending was funny 😂
the outro theme was a REMIX of the original and i love this one..............
Why does he have to wide body everything its just not that interesting
its a drag tree
0:19 oskars camera skills are really good
Strad! I recognized your cruise down 17th street. Used to live there for like 20 years of my life. IFHS alumni. Does your friend live in IF, Ammon, or Skyline side of IF?
Maybe you can officially announce a video a week .
I it me or is it not synced the audio and video
Wa the 6x6 sold?  Where’s the TT Lambo?
I miss the focus RS I wish you did more with it
Best YouTuber ever
Keep working 🙏🏼
shoulda been the supra
812 has better sound than aventador 😐no cap 😅
Damn bro I can’t believe you’re scared of cops Over window tint screw them cops
I got a ad from strand man to win a car
I don’t know what it is but the editing in this video was really good, Like my brain enjoyed every second lol, ty strad 💆🏼‍♂️🤝💆🏼‍♂️
You should by the c8 again bro having 2 c8 corvettes is cool
I thought at first he was buying the audi tt back.
The video directly below this one was Chandlers and I immediately guessed the car cause I knew it wasn't the C8
Buy a Lexus LFA
the ASMR IN THE END THO....................
He raged so much that he literally swore
Is it just me or does James have like infinite money 💰🤑 but that’s not a bad thing can’t wait for the build 👍
I ONEW IT YAY!
Don't forget to check the window tint!!🤣
That ending with the juice 🔥😆
The guy is so happy to drive the 458 hehe
Nice one with the thumbnail I recognise it is your lambo roadster
Bring me bagels when u bring me the strad Lamborghini ☺️
The energy in this episode was hilarious
Bro I love this car very much but I think it's not as good asthe Ferrari challege car it was da best
I missed the Ferrari but now it’s back
what the hell is that snow ?!!!!
your ad is on your video
nice car but I'm to young, Lamborghini Huracan  😢😢😢😢😥😥
Not that serious dude going to far
Pls wide body it
Get an Ariel Atom!!!
Strad shits money left and right
Great decision!
damn she is so bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuulllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
I don’t like this new way of filming  Doesn’t feel right
Basically just advertised the Ram TRX it really pulled away from an Ferrari
No more wide body cars
I heard james first time saying that F word...
Next car an R8 you need another AWD
Stradman you should paint the 458 donington gray metallic
its the ferrari
Oscar got so big lol
8:36 We own another Ferrari?????
Love the rabter
Camera guy instead of Strad?! I like it! Welcome
strad buying a 2004 ferrari challenge stradale
James, Supra... Supra and Supra❤️
straightpipe the 458 or do a race exhaust, pwease🥺🥺🥺
I got your ad for the hurrican on this video 🤣
Imagine you’re friends just like I can’t be seen in this super car you drive it like wtf James is such a good friend
i think after the wide body Ferrari V8 and Lamborghini V12.. we need to finish the trilogy and pick up a V10 project?  Liberty walk R8?
Should put a f1 exhaust on the 458😍
So thankful it's the 458 and not the Corvette!!
u NEEEEED the ford gt back that is the one car I wished you would never of sold also..... purple widebody Ferrari with white wheels
Miss the audi TT and the Gallardo
i knew it
the fact that he is buying another ferrari right after buying his old 458 got me chills i'm hyped for whats the next ferrari he is getting....
Your on ad!
Who is the stranger at 13:03 ? is that another Ferrari owner you ran into? How cool!
I know strad was really getting tired of the f430 but I really wish he bought that one back because I really loved the wrap he had on it and just how obnoxiously loud it was
🍏
I knew you were buying the ferrari back
Damn~ 458 is one of the best looking car
Best part:- james saying oh yeah after drinking
Damn, I was wishing it was the Baby Mac
Just me or does this lowkey sounds like a LFA?
Is that not the guy that was talking bed about  u  I did not like it I delete  him he wine  way 2 much pull up your panttes
#widebodytheworld
New camera guy is great. He might want to leave the zoom alone though
Ik it’s the 458
oh shiiiiiiit got goosebumps
And he’s buying another Ferrari, this mans bank account is ^^^
If you can fit your ears inside your hat, you need a smaller hat.
The first ad that I see as soon as I click on the video was ad from Wizza with James in it 😂
you put your own ad in your vid
Just do what I did.  Get a medical exempt from your doctor for the window tint, problem solved.
I’ve talked about this day since the day he sold that car
She is back
Get ready for those Ferrari cease and desist letters
Who alse got a stradman ad lmao
He needs to bring back the baby mac
So whats the opposite of the wide body aventedor? Lol
I feel bad for this deal
You should get a lfa now because you have the best sounding v6, v8 and v12 now
Right before this video, I saw an ad with the strad man in it of how to win the purple lambo
Living the dream!!
Narrator: tint laws are dumb.
people who stayed till the end heard godly voices
Stop zooming in and out lol
Luke look like a cool guy 🤙
Finally a Ferrari back on your channel!!! 😍😍😍
less cars m,ore builds on the house.
Anyone else think the old c8 is better looking than the new one??
First take off the wrap
Twin turbo the Aventador Coupe Please!!
Before i clicked on this video i thought to myself. either its the 458 or its the og audi
yo strad youre lookin strong, that gyms been good to you
Dude spend some of that YouTube money on a sound system so your videos sound like the cars do
The 458 is one of my all time favorite Ferraris!! I'm jealous. Hold onto it!
You did the right thing this car so good its make your cars collection so beautiful
Can’t wait for the build! It will look so good with the lambo
The best part of the entire video was the juice
Strad still puts his dads picture with him in the outro. Really shows how close he was with his dad💔
I liked the 458 being on the channel, hope you keep it for a while.
Good luck.
That bagel segment made me laugh way to hard
That drink at the end reminded me of the traditional “Ahhhh!” after every drink back in the day. OG subs know.
i really dont like the fact that you dont hold the camera fulltime anymore, that is the nicest thing about you vlogs, i really love you vlogs, why wont you hold it youreself?
Was that a F&^C at 10:50? LOL
nobody can copy your originality specially that gtr jerk who you call friend.
I love the extra clips at the end, that’s awesome 😎
So C8, Aventador, GTR, Now this am i missing one? "Widebody The World" Love it @ TheStradman
Maybe soon can you buy a Porsche
james you need a Lexus LFA its the best sounding V10 in da world!!!!!!
Omg the Ferrari sounding Insane Gorgeous 😅
Ferrari 458s 😎😁💎
The automotive YouTube community NEEDS a DDE meet up when it’s done.
you should get a Lexus LFA, that way you have the best sounding V8, V10, and V12
oskar looks like a polarbear 😂
10:50 lol I thought heard him say the F word 😆😆
Stradale up next
James you always make me happy I love your energy
Let’s just pray James finds wheels for the 458 wide body in time and not on back order in momths
Well now this was one of my favouraite car in his collection and it's back again babay
Better than DDE?👀👀
Strad, u dont need a camera man, ur the best camera man alive, for my opinion u should record the videos ur self :)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I WAS CRAVING A NEW STRAD VIDEO LOL
ferrari * twoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Pleas wrap it cyan it will change your life
Have you ever lost your hat while driving a convertible car.
was hoping for the ford gt. a epic car that we never get to see enough of.
I want to see the Supra back
Just buy back your old c8
3:45 did he say I like tesa? Not tesla?  Lol
I like the new style of filming
Wow wow Ferrari
“She sounds so good” where? On the road or bed?
One of the McLarens or probably the Ferrari.
A Stradman ad on a Stradman video.... nice
Chandlers laugh is legendary😂😂😂
Ferrari might have a purple interior. Only reason why I say that is because, he bough customized purple seats a year ago with an Oscar local on the head rest. I don’t think he sold the seats either
You brung back the 458 on my dogs bday
Something seems different
It’s so weird seeing Chandler in your videos. We used to sell pest control door to door together in LA. Now he’s just a property mogul and makes vlogs and whatnot.
03:25 It´s brown.
White 458 and pink wheels??????🤤
cars like the 458 are far from being a supercar nowadays. you have cars like stock Mustangs gt that can beat them and Gallardos so what makes them super? lol now exotic yes. But nowadays you also have the big heavy gt500 that can get around a track within a second of a Ferrari f8 tributo huracan evo and porsche gt3RS  and all off them are 4 secs faster than a c8. GT500 has better brakes and the trans and engine can handle 1200whp which shows its reliability and capability. hence why Lamborghini has to go hybrid atleast to keep up with the monsters that are coming out of Italy Germany and even the USA.  Supercars need power braking and handling or its not super. supercars should have all of that and by todays standards have 700+hp  or atleast be capable of mid 10s. but being a 10 yr old platform gotta give it some credit for some of what it could do.  but even back then 11.9 it ran in the 1/4 mile which back then you had cars that could do that
YES!
are you actually gonna widebody the 458 this time??? Lol
Bring back the lotus it’s only right
I swear on my own fucking life I guessed the Ferrari 458
Damn man,  have you contacted your state legislature about changing the tint laws yet?
Killing it....
I just looked at the inverted color, and I gotta say, it is honestly one of the most beautiful things that I have ever seen. I can't wait for the build to be done and rolling down the street with its, almost, kinda, sorta, not really, twin.
I assume a Carrera GT is coming for best V10 sound to pair with the others.
f*** yeah ! beautiful 458 !!
My fav is back :)
And just like that… I turned into a salty subscriber. I really hope we don’t see a “I can’t afford my expensive house” videos anytime soon.
12:54 WAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN!
It’s called a Christmas tree 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Please dont sell the raptor
Picture this, all the cars getting custom interiors like seats buttons and all that good stuff, exteriors like wheels, brake calipers, wraps, widebodies and being called Strad Editions, like the Aventador. Now that would be amazing
Wow how original wide-body haven't seen that before...
Wait did he say he likes Tesla or he likes......
Why tf would you bring your fluffer along for the ride if you're just gonna keep him in a fucking cage? Can't stand dog owners like you. That shits borderline animal abuse.
As I went to watch the video, the first video on my right was Chandler's saying James bought his supercar
You should by a custom stearing wheel for the 458
Paint it nardo gray with some gold bbs’s
Seems like someone likes to pay speeding tickets
So james is richer than I imagined, the dude bought multiple cars in a span of a couple months as if they're hotwheels
It’s crazy how much the C8 Z06 sounds like the 458
finnally a ferrari
It looks so clean why would you give it a widebody kit
Order wheels TODAY!! 😂🙏🏼🥇
I legit just had an ad with stradman before his own video bro
Sad day the 430 challenge aint back😔😔
The “drag strip light” is called the tree
What’s more illegal than window tint? Not doing the proper outro
No hate to Luke but I feel you vlogging yourself was like better. Idk I am watching from a long time that is why I feel or idk but dope no hate for luke :))
twin turbo build
Every car does not need a wide body
Buys another Ferrari challenge car
Let’s goo you did a good decision
Gallardo? Haven’t seen the video yet but I’m super excited to see what it is
Always brightens my day
Stradman, you've lost some of your accounting skills. When you purchase and sell a car for the same price it isn't break even if you put thousands of dollars of upgrades on it during ownership.
Yes
WAIT U BUYING AN OTHER FERRARI??? 13:1  YESSSIRRRR
GET A DR'S NOTE FOR YOUR SENSATIVE EYES TO LIGHT 🤷‍♂️ EASY AS THAT BATABINGBATABOOM
Hey. I saw it ad for hurrican just before watching this video
Gotta send it to gintani to get a upgrade also you need to put a chassis mounted rear wing
I actually forgot about the 458
OSKAR!!!!
What about the v12 Ferrari..?🥺
Stradman let’s go in drag racing mode?? I think Oscar just moaned in the back
damn i thought the supra was coming back
If you have someone in the car why don't you let them handle the camera.  In South Africa they'll confiscate that camera and give you a very high fine
6:44 “Did I buy this car because it is the best sounding car in the world?” “Lexus LFA entered chat”
you need a LFA because best v10
Please hold the camera for yourself. It’s better.please we beg u .❤️❤️
i like the energy of this video
Please do the Ferrari build by yourself
she is back i cant beleve it
I was hoping for the ford gt😒
7:17 Aaaand that's a wrap for the clutch
You know all you had to do is roll down your windows
Widebody!!!
Why why why !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dude come on man 🙄🙄🙄🙄🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
I seen the guy that has your racecar ferrari
Its literally illegal for me to miss a strad vid
I regret coming to the comments out of habit when opening the video, just spoiled it for me. 😭
458 to the moon!
I’m so excited the Ferraris back🙂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Emelia bought one as well lol. A collab maybe???
The sound is amazing on 458
That was the one car I wished you hadn’t sold
I still can’t believe my 2 favorite YouTubers do videos occasionally together
He is the best youtuber in my eyes he deserves 100m subs doesn't he💯💯
gte 458 widebody next?? woah not so sure tho xD
What has habened to the gallardo
Get down pipes
I wanted it to be the Supra
I'm eating a bagel right now lol
This is awesome
for a sec i thought he was buying his challenge racecar back
Another stradman ad on a stradman video
You should be a uhp spokesman for window tint
Colour farrari Red of purple...
Imagine a wide body trx
i think its gonna be bright green.....
wideboy it man liberty walk 458 spider
Do they have legal window tint exemptions? I have one in va and ca for my “eye issues”
I like the videographer style👍👍
twin tyrbo gallardo❤️
He said i sold 458 in oct 16 2021. But he sell in 2020
What’s up with the outro music
I knew it you will buy one back but not the one you used to own
Put a Wide body kit on ur mercilago
Nice
Why sell it and buy it back
Pick your damn trash bro .... baby seal's are affected from the plastic you just left there...
Bro were is ur bugatti killer ?
Pls tt and widebody. Plsss...........
When we can’t keep track of how many cars you have it’s kinda ridicules.
Ngl a cop pulling you over for window tint means he’s just an asshole and is trying to hit his monthly quota
I am still misibg lamborgini galardo mann i thog that was goraldo  but still i like your video like all wayes :)
After putting on the wide body wrap it matte iced amethyst titanium
Widebody the world is his motto now
This new build sounds like a invitation for a case from Ferrari
Yesss please build the trx 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I love the 458 spider
now you need the best sounding v10....the lfa
12:52 so what you're sayin is there's still another Ferrari comin to the channel ??
Anybody else think it was the Ford gt at first
Im at 0:11 my guess is the ford gt
I wish u bought back supra
Just thought of this, Oscars new car should be a mazda  mk11998 miata in placement of the tesla
Within an hour :0
Put it on air ride
CAMERA MAN?! YESSIR, oh nvm ;-;
Next video  wide bodying the 458
I got the Stradman wizza ad on the Strads video
can u bay back the c8 from him
can u bay back the c8 from him
U need a best V10 as well
Idk if I missed it in a video but what happened to the gallardo ?
What happened with the 430 squderia aka the road legal ferarri race car
It's like getting your girlfriend back after you hooked her up with a buddy for a year and a half.. lol
Why did you have to do it in the end btw I am excited for the new one and for the old one welcome home
You brought back the obnoxious refreshing drink slurp😁👏👏👏
Stop talking shit about the window tint. You still looked like a tool when you thought the cop's window tint was too dark and asked him to test his own tint. Just go legal limit and get over it.
Congrats. Nice 458 back in the corral
What a coincidence I get a stradman ad before the video
Turn the TRX into the Bug Killer
So nice to see you and your pops... sorry for the anniversary of losing him.
Where has Johnny been?
I hope the purple seats won't come to the channel. :S
Widebody coming soon
I will say the Ferrari 458 is probably my absolute favorite car that you have ever bought so this is awesome!
110,816th
lone it love
Stradman looking like a washed out coke head
Can you do a car tour
I don’t remember if you put headers on it? If you haven’t you need to
Who makes the wrap?
wow he got a cemara man
Fact: he still has the strad seats from the supra.
What car
I actually like the new camera man style vs the vlog style
He needs the best sounding v10 to complement the others 🤣
I just got an ad about the huracan performante on a stradman video. Feels weird
Twin turbo, widebody, 458? It'd look so sick next to the twin turbo lambos
Try ny state James we can’t have lower then like 72% or something
update on the TT lambo?
There should be more uploads in a week
Who all saw the last [gulp oh soo good scene] 😂😂😂🔥
What strad should do is use his widebody and paint it rosa acantus like the aventador
You can legally drive it in Utah. It's registered in Idaho. So it has to fall under Idaho laws. Until you register it in Utah again anyway.
2 minutes in, hopefully it’s NOT that 458🙏🙏🙏 Edit: whyyyyyyyyyy, ugliest Ferrari’s ever I was hoping to see the Supra, GT or R8 back…
#ferrari458
Great video strad. I love your videos and content, and the dog is cool too.
Loved to see you buying the 458 again even for a cost higher up at 35k. You are a true car lover bro. Thank you. Love from India 👍👍
Deep downs I was hoping it was the R8! That thing is nostalgic! Would you ever buy it back for memory sake? Love the 458 too
Get legal limit tint
No way.
Bruh that’s my maverick
HOLD UP HE SOLD THE GLADIATOR
Yo... any winter Strad merch??
Love the color should keep it that way
Leave the wrap don’t take it off
sir strad, i love your videos but isnt buying all these cars kinda dumb? like this is not a hate comment but what about the house build and all the lumber costs, you could use the money you are spending on all these cars on the lumber for your house. just sum to think abt but keep up the good work ily.
I just open the video and I got a stradman add😂😂😂
Yay
lol i looked at the video and i was like "oh man he actually bought back his 458"
u memester
You should buy the Ford gt back
So refreshing after watching mushoku tensie to watching stradman 👌my day is complete
Guys buying and selling cars like crypto
that ASMR drinking thoe
Is he Mormon or a dealer? That’s the only type of people that live in Idaho Falls 😂  Spent a lot of time in Rexburg right next to it. Southeast is a beautiful part of my state though. Edit: btw I’m just kidding, sure he’s a great guy.
Trx with 900 on the Strad channel hell yes
He bought a chiron
lets go, your collection needed a ferrari
*Ok I’m actually in love with that wrap*
Do u know what's better than stradman upload? Me neither cause there's nothing better.
Any one know who makes that wrap? Tia
812 or f12 coming???
Imagine just casually driving down the highway and seeing Stradman in a 458 on the side of the road yelling at traffic and ripping off window tint. 😂
I love Ferrari
It's so weird to see that strad has a camera man
THE FERRARI IS BACK! WOOHOOO 🥳
Make it into 458 GT3
when he widebody it is he going to sell to Chandler again?
Did Luke dirty
Let’s go 🔥
Please get the Supra back or try to get a R34 or R32
No joke I said he's getting back 458 and he did
Is he Paul walker’s twin brother?
Strad vlogs where he is not holding the camera don't feel right 😥😂
‘This isn’t the Ferrari we’re buyin- okay end the video” (to be continued). Lol everyone is excited now
I got a StradAdd for this video
And just like that She's back baby she's back😍🤩
Strad ur own vloging style was better pls return to it
I was hoping it was the Supra, still cool though!
Strad: Finishing The house is to expensive.....  Also strad: lets by 2 ferarri's
This video was worth the wait 🔥🔥🔥
I feel like the 458 in a candy blue next to the pink Lambo would look amazing
Oh yeah. He did own that car for like a month.
u need a svj
YOU PROBABLY BOUGHT THE F12, RIGHT?
I need these problems
Can i say to the viewers that you bought a Stradale.. Ohh sooy my bad
Surprised he didnt "ask fo' mo' "
it feels so awkward to watch james not shooting this video himself
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Ayyeee yoo nice remix yooooo
That color is nice
The sponsors if ull r reading this, plz keeping sponsoring our man so he keeps buying his cars back from people XD
nice
Bruh getting ready to watch stradman first time in a long time and I get a add from stradman about winning a purple Lamborghini hurican
Excited to see some ferrari content !
hope to see the liberty walk 458 😅
Me thinking it was the babymac:
Plot twist 12:50
I live in Idaho falls I wish I saw you
God I love that car
James’ vids entertain me
Yeyyyy ❤️ I missed that one
So close to me but yet so so far
I knew you bought the 458 back! And also the cameraman is a great idea
Can't wait to see the widebody fleet. But what if the fleet goes to SEMA
that is c8 corvette
I'm guessing it a ford GT let's see...
Bro you say you dont got money to buy lumber but here your just freaking buying cars like WTF.....
The ASMR at the end is legendary
Camera man ur evolving
I knew instantly what he was getting back
your vids are way better when you have a filmer! plus that ferrari sounds way better than i remember!
Do a 458 aperta
Widebodies James has: Aventador, C8, GTR, Soon Ferrari 🥲wide body the world 🌎
Does anyone remember the gallardo?,when will it be back,I am dying for an update
James buy a 488 gte evo wing pliss. Dont use the ductail spoiler
Just think you now have paid taxes twice on the same car in a year!!
Less cheesy than normal. I enjoy that.
Strada man needs to post more often 😭
The Widebody Aficionado is back bois LEZGOOOOOOOO
For a moment I thought it was the R8
The c8 is like you  replaced me and bought back my Ferrari friend
Poor Oski
When the Gallardo coming back
In Idaho falls, I live in  Idaho falls :)
It’s fine James.. u are public figure now.. 😛
Maybe you should put a wide body kit on the Ferrari 458 spider
chandlers laugh is kinda cartoony
I LIVE DOWN THE ROAD FROM THAT GAS STATION
You came to where I live wish I could have seeen you love the Ferrari tho
I’m in beginning of the video and I know exactly what is it I dint forward or anything I saw it on chat :trollface:
Chandler probably sank 45K in maintenance in the last year
I called it lol this felt like deja vu maybe I imagined him buying his ferrari and just realized he didn't have one
The exhaust on the 458 is so sick!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤ so glad to see it back on the channel. Cant wait to see it with a widebody kit!👍👍
is that snow on the ground?
I've been watching Chandler ever since he bought your C8, I've been obsessed with learning real estate investing ever since so I have to sincerely thank you for introducing me to Chandler's channel
So sad to see it go! Hope you love it! Thanks for coming to visit!
James: "Okay were buying back a car that I used to own"   Me: "Do you have any idea how little that narrows it down"
OCTOBER 16th. What, that’s MY BIRTHDAY 🎂   Thanks James. Regards, Bob M. South Wales
You should buy back your lotus and do a wide body build on it
this is my favourite vedioe
Yeah bro he is cool and I like he's videos and I love his work
Yess wide body the world
Missed your vlogs! and today you Posted!! Wooh, Legend is Back To Posting :)))
3:35 mark his words When he experiences it  Keep in mind he raced the p100d and lost to the veyron He probably thinks there's no diff
*James respectfully DON'T YOU DARE take off the wrap, it just looks to efffing good!!!* 😍🔥
SF90 on the way??👀
Ok here me out 😶 order your WHEELS now so they be in b4 you are done with the bodykit 🤔🤨
The video doesn’t feel the same when James isn’t holding the camera lmao
James i think you should definently get a cameraman beacus quallity of vids 📈
458 Spyder widebody, Aventador roadster widebody, and the c8 Corvette widebody with the detachable roof. WIDEBODY THE WORLD
You Finely Got a New Ferrari
If you tint to the legal level it will still look great. The legal level is dark enough to get rid of the fish bowl effect.
Lol forgot you sold the 458 😂
best Ferrari going
Come onnn
I got an ad for the wizzes huracan giveaway on this video
OK...  So Stradman will be buying Another Ferrari very soon !!! 😊😊👍👍🎉🎉🚙🚙
Continue the build baby!
Something about watching James energy and awkwardness is like Therapy 👌🏼
Isnt this the same car that he trashed James on when he bought it?
Unless he's registering his cars in a state with zero sales tax on used cars then he technically lost $12k ish in sales tax when buying it for $165k and another $14k ish when buying it back for $200k. That adds up, I know chump change to some 😣
Yeahhh mannnn
Nice
Yo TANNER FOX is thinking of getting rid of his widebody GTR's rims You should buy them from him
Pls paint the 458 spider "Lime Green"
YOU REALLY NEED TO TALK TO A DR AND GET A NOTE/PRESCRIPTION FOR DARK TINT SAY YOU CAN SEE BETTER WHEN ITS A LITTLE DARKER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS MAKE IT HARDER TO SEE. IVE GOT ONE AND ALLOWS ME TO TINT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND WINDOWS AS DARK AS I WANT. IM SURE WITH YOUR CONNECTIONS YOU CAN FIND A DR THAT WILL DO IT.
I love this man
So there is another Ferrari coming to the vlog.
Wheres the gallardo gone!
Where is the galardo
On the thumbnail it looked liked the supra 😭
Strad should by a porshe taycan tubo s
Some BBS wheels would look so good on the Liberty Walk 458!
So you sold it to him for a friend price. However, he is not doing that for you. Now that is what I call friendship!
That’s awesome that the 488 Spider is back
Why the hate for Tesla’s? American car company. Innovators. So sick of Tesla and electric car hate.
At the start of the video, I thought damn! Oscar can shoot Vlog? 🤣
Yep he made a great decision
When was this vlogged?? Theres snow on the ground in Idaho!! Buying back a car for a higher price a yr later for a tax break.
Stradman 2019: WRAP EVERYTHING Stradman 2020: PURPLE EVERYTHING Stradman 2021: WIDE BODY EVERYTHING  Edit: omg i didnt know i would get this much likes
Yesss the 458 is back and we will finally get get to see the LW widebody build
I thought it was the rocket bunny supra
When you come back to Idaho strad, you should come to boise when you have the chance.
Now what colour for the 458 maybe purple and white wheels?
Got a Strad ad on a Strad video
I like stradman to hold a camera he doesn't need a camera man because stradman if hold the camera it awesome.
Just got his wizza ad before the vid
I knew it!
Next can u get the C8 Corvette I love the videos with the Corvette😂
This guy is printing money
I still remarried Oskar as a Puppy now he has become a big mashmello
The vette, the gtr ,the lambø and nøw the rarri  Wide bødy natiøn 🔥🔥🔥
feels refreshing at 1:53 to have that OG fuel clip
Hi
I freaking love new filming style
Buy a sport bike
Widebody ferrari 👍🔥
James, I glad you got the Ferrari 458 Spyder back.
We need wide body the wrld merch
now you need to get the best sounding v10 (lexus lfa)
Dude please do more vids with the trx it is literally my dream truck/daily driver and it is awesome
Yes you are the best
So now the stradman is a food Chanel
u can tell James is Lowkey but highkey butt hurt he paid 35k more for the car
Thought it was the Ford GT
Luke was so happy at 11:37 given the opportunity to drive the 458 😭😂
I just watched a stradman ad????
Wow im early today
Something seems different in a good way, both the vibe and camera angles made this vid awesome
Glad U got it back, but STADalle?
Another Wide Body with Positive Wheel Offset coming to a vlog soon
The early down shift and it banging red line hurt my soul XD 7:15
Finally I’m sorta early for a vid I love the cars James
Garage update?? What’s coming, what’s going, what you have
I like the idea of the 458 and Lambo together, no turbos, both open top, just the sweat sound of the V's together. Only thing which could make them better is if they were stick.
it's my birthday today i hope strad notice me.
Get the supra back
This feels different and better idk y
You need a lfa
And James is back baby
Imagine the strad 458 and the dde488 together 🤔
Ur the best
What happened to the other channel STRAD? We need more vids
Bro no song on it
James video is always so great 👍👍
buy a mk4 supra
stradman asmr lol
Yes let’s go finally got the car back new u were 😭
Buy the purple supra back pls it's my favourite car
Did he say he likes Tessa
In 1:09 had me thinking.... Is that how stradman really talkes off camera??? Because he looks and sounds like an actor there😅😅
The wrap is insanely great!
The Supra is the best car you sold
PLEASE BUY THE 360 STRADALE! its about time! 😎
Awesome 🤩👌
He might be running out of parking space again 😂
White 458 with pink rims? Is that what you mean by the opposite? Jokes aside I think you should do that! ;p
What's the color gunna be?
What happend  to the r35 strad?
Where is your Lamborghini Gallardo twin turbo 🤔
yeeees im so happy he bought the 458 i luv it
nice
You bought it back at the wrong time it’s about to get cold so no top down
Dude I live the new camera angels, keep it up!
Tesla has notoriously bad build quality, why can't anyone say that shit out loud?? It's overvalued 10x on crap quality, it makes very little sense
It's gonna be green, bet
@stradman can I get a happy birthday?😏
Oo different camera style, I likes
its really sad to see how some of y'all will literally jump down this mans back to ,make another video when he has so much going on in the background that we definitely don't even know about, especially with his dad passing and you guys are acting like he didn't make that public smh... the man has a life apart from YouTube... get over and watch somebody else if he's TaKInG t0 loNG....
I haven’t watched yet hope it’s the Ford gt or one of the ferraris
Where is the Lamborghini gallardo?? It’s been gone for so long
Idk if im overthinking but this man said he was having issues paying for the lumber of his dream home then turns around buys back his old supercar
F12/812 coming to the channel?
I missed the 458
Should have put that $200k  towards your house build then u could buy the cars later
Manz playing GTA in real life
i was just  typing to find your video and it showed up on the notification ❤️😂
Who else thought it was the r8?
Very Intelligent buy back!  The 458 is so going going up in Value!
I love that the 458 is back it was good in ur vlogs love the 458
Stradman Routine 1. Buy a Car 2. Wide Body it 3. Wrap  And I still Like him lol
if he paints his ferrari purple or pink i'm unsubscribing ong
We need a purple wide body car
6:16 wow
k Just buy the F8 Tributo
Are you maybe or maybe još buying a Ferrari STRADalle
I know it was your 458
Super pumped for this build!
Another Ferrari? I'm exited!
Who else liked it when he filmed himself? more modest
Imagine Strad buying a Shelby GT500 🤔
i thought it was the gayardo but still pretty good old reminds
Lesssssgooooo
Buy back the baby mac!!!!
Can’t believe he partnered up with wizza 😭🤦🏽‍♂️
I think you should paint it yellow
luke looks so much happier when around stefan, he’s a completely different person with him 😂
Hey strad, I got your ad on this vid! 😂
Keep Luke as the camera man he’s good
That paint is dope!! Strad, hope you wouldn't change the paint even after adding the lbwk kit to it.
No more tessa
Didn't he say he wanted to build a off road Ferrari?
I was kind of hoping he was going to say C8 Corvette
i ann drink that juce aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
That outro though!
Two italian widebody roadsters, what an amazing thought.
I wait every Sunday for your videos bro It makes me so happy
Has it really been a year? Wow!
Buy a lfa and I know you have the money to do it
Make the trx the super car killer
Yo
Wait I clicked on the video and a Rizzo ad came up and the ad had strawman in it
73 people already disliked unbelievable he is just a nice youtuber 😡😡
Race headers go all out
I am seriously not in a good mental state right now
A strad ad on a strad video lol
The camara man is such a great upgrade
Hi
Strad snitching on other cars
Bro the new angle
word first supercharged 458 maybe
bro your collection is literally going to be the most perfect thing in the universe
I was hoping it would be the Ford GT or the 458.
Is the strad channel already dead
Another nice car f'd up by a $12 fiberglass body kit!
His teeth are cleaner than his cars
So he goes from the purple guy, to the wide body guy, interesting
I waa hoping it was the Supra
Hi😍
Surprise #1: A wizza add staring Stradman himself before the video started to play. Surprise #2: Stradman buying back his Ferrari F458 Spyder.
We already know what next for this car
Wrap it as the F1 cars
Lime green maybe, hopefully, possibly
I knew it since the notification saying that stradman made a new video saying that he's buying a his old car back the numbers 458 ran through in my brain
Congo......
PLEASE put the F.I headers on it!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Ship a car to Cali and do some driving with the other You tubers. Switch it up a bit.
Reunion with the ferrari.....but what is the wrap on the 458???........ But intro was siiick 🔥🔥
Of the picture of the video
so weird waching james   but hes not filming
Seriously Strad... You do so much for people and people are just taking advantage of your kindness. I know it's none of my business and you make money off of things and have a big heart but 10 or 15 over what you sold it for would of been FAIR but your a grown man and have your reasons. Your a great person and I know you came from nothing just be careful and protect yourself from the vultures.
Let’s goooooo I’m stoked
Buy a 488 pista spider
You might’ve lost 35k but I’m excited for the build again 😂❤️
I was really hoping for it to be your old R8 but I guess the Ferrari is cool.
just iam waiting for your video strad.....
James u should track down the OG Audi TT!
Called it
when you get the wizza lambo ad with James while trying to watch stradman
Btw where's James GF? Still together?
I was hoping you'd build the 458 liberty walk!!
I swear to God if you sell the car again lmaooo
Who else wants the GT back?
James,you need another Toyota Supra
I thought he was  buying another baby Mac
CHIP TUNE IT PLS!!!
Can't wait for the widebody on the 458! I personally think its the best looking car with a widebody kit, especially a Spider. No doubt the Venti is way more absurd tho, plus I'm just a huge Lambo fanboy!
This man will shortly own three widebody open- top supercars. Let that sink in for a moment......
at 10:49 he says "ok f*ck that i hate that " it's officialy the first time @thestradman swears on this channel
OMG OMG OMG YESSIR AHES BACK
I got a feeling it's his rarri
We want eveyday vlogs 😭
W vid
So wait, you sold it to him for what you paid for it and then he taxed you $35k when he sold it back to you? That's a bad friend.
you should definitely get a raptor R when it comes out 750 hp
few months ago, i thought nick will buy a 458 spider and james' widebody parts
Let's be honest. The Ford gt is that car that got away
Idk how to explain it but the way this vlog was filmed and edited was so much better than others!
I knew it was the 458 by the shape! Hope u keep it forever and ever like the other cars!
Says he can’t afford the lumber to finish his house. Buts a $100,000+ car every two weeks. 🙄
I’m calling it, James bought an f40. Emilia Hartford said that an f40 was off to salt lake so I think it might be James
Bro I thought he was buying his old Ford gt 😭😭
So that means widebody?
I bet Garadollo
Please pin my comment if u dont I will steal OSKAR
I think it's a ford gt cause the shape
I knew it was gonna be the 458
13:07 asmr 😂
James:  KEEP THAT WRAP !   It looks amazing. Well, not gonna happen, cause he`s gonna widebody it.  I´m getting tired of all these widebody builds.
Love ya videos!
Put the liberty walk kit on it
He will get 40,000 just in you tube
The screen seems wobbly is it just me ?
Now you need to get the best v10 sounding and wide body it
James is buying a car for his libertywalk widebody kit🌶🔥
Stradman: "Oscar hates the Focus RS so I'm buying him a truck" Also Stradman: "Lets launch this truck with Oscar in the back"   LMAOOO
"His cameraman gets paid?" - Luke
I was just watching a ad
Convert the trx to the mammoth 1000 with 1000hp
Vermont is the same way with window tint, ugh.
Love the fact we will finally see the liberty walk widebody kit and the fact that we might see a v12 ferrari as well.....  (ps pls God give us a 812 on which he gets a novitec n largo kit)
when you get James` add on his own video
Dude just casually reveals something huge n then snakes us by ending the video 😭
I think the next car is F8 Tributo or Something A Race Car
I'm glad you got the 458 back... was missing some Ferrari content...mission  wide body the world!!!!
yessir yessir
It's back for the wide body!
Glad you are showing Ferrari some love! The 458 has always been a dream car of mine! ✌️
I feel like James is like marvel he end end credits now not all the time but there
No way!! You came to my city!!! I saw you guys ripping around in the Ferrari!
We finally got a firari in the collection. Stad man is the king of supper cars
BEFORE I WATCHED THIS VIDEO I LITTERALLY GOT AN AD ABOUT HOW YOU TEAMED UP WITH WIZZA LOLLLLLL
I always liked the 458. I don't like the wrap that is on it now. I think it makes the car look cheap for some reason.
Stradman ASMR content when?
I got your ad before your video started
What happened to the Gallardo?
Its always good to see Oskar in the videos
Next episode on “back and wider than ever”
U have to pain it red or yellow
How convenient I was about to watch a stradman video and an ad popped up featuring stradman
Ello
Sir. How dare you leave us for that long
WIDE BODY THE WORLD 🌎
James if u get rid of that car AGAIN?! Then idk what to tell u 😂
Wide body ???????????????????????????"???????????????????????????????????????????????????
Loved this vedio got to see things from a different prospective hope you keep up these types of vedios ❤
Yesss were back baby!!! Yup james!!
Before he even bought it I knew it was gonna be the 458. Prediction master
It’s time to wide body it
Can you put luke and Steffen on camera more pls and you are the best
make it red just like a ferrari needs to be
lets go im early
Chandler should’ve still sold it to you for a better deal. Like I know he’s an investment guy but you sold him two cars for good deals he should’ve returned the favor at least.
Come on James you didn't have too teese everyone at the end. Lol.. Hopefully your adding new wheels and more power to 458 let's go.
Are you putting the Hellephant in the 6X6?
Strad looks like a crazy man yelling about aliens over window tint😂😂
At 3:45 he said “I like Tessa” instead of Tesla 😳😳😳
Stradman Sunday’s 🤩
i know the ferrari your buying back, the good old track car (forgot the name sry)
The crazy things is strad Gunna have all widebody cars
Paying 35k more lmao
we had a little remix going in the outro beat i dig it
Y? Hhahahahha
sheeshhhh
Not a fan of the new camera work. Congrats on the re-buy though!
Well come here to get the 'I came here 1 hour before'  ticket
Sooo a green 458? Yes yes yes
Need more stradman videos💥
Stradman positive energy is through the roof I love it. 🤣🤣🤣
Bro when turbo girl is coming home??
the noises tho
I'm so happy you bought the 458 back, probably the car I hoped was your biggest regret selling, hold on to it for a very long time, I'm pretty sure these will skyrocket being the last N/A Ferrari V8 ever made
Just roll the windows down…👀🤔
What’s crazy about this is I drive that road everyday!
Anybody else get the wizza ad with stradman before the vid?
make the 458 italia a nice kind of blue so they role blue and pink
3:43 YOU LIKE WHAT???
I got your huracan ad on this vid
Try living in Pennsylvania all the car rules are dumb
what another ferrari
When I keep seeing videos like these I’m like “please Supra”
You should hire a camera man for though, this video just felt different which I loved
Now back back the Supra 😂
Great start to the week 😃
As much as I love this channel. It seems that the majority of the videos are now: Buy Car, Announce crazy build, sell car before build, then Buy back car later. Idk. Feels weird.
I wish da supra get back
Happy you bought it back, was confused why you got rid of it, Perfect NA V8 Ferrari. Please do the GT3 side Mirrors!
Hi?!?
THAT N/A V8 SOUNDS NUTS
Early gang
I know this is off topic but when I clicked on this video I got a stradman advertisement on a stradman video
I love this color James, it's really something else !!
It looks like potatoes
who knew he bought somethin he owned
I was hoping it was the lotus.
This is exactly what the doctor ordered.....What a way to end my weekend..
So glad to see you back James
Stradman buy back the Ford gt the supra and the Ford focus and the challenge car Ferrey
12 AM about to go take a sleep James upload a new video My Mind: ah shit here we go again
tintgate is the best
Sheee THICC
But way
Strad man taking over TJ place widebody and wheels everything
Thank for uploading james, we missed you🤗🇵🇭🇵🇭
I got your ad when I clicked on this video
Day 1 of telling james that he needs a bmw
The moment I saw the title I knew that you're gonna buy the 458 didn't expect you'd buy it back from Chandler
Come on man!!! Gotta end like that!!
finally! a ferrari! wooo hooo
Good and awesome video like all time James. The 458 model are one of my dream cars
You should meet up with Damon from dde with his 488 wide body when the wide body 458 is done
13:08 that juice was real real real good 🍾
Tbh with you, I thought you were going to make a proper financial decision and take a L to buy the lumber over MSRP, but you know what you're doing.  I enjoyed the video nevertheless.
I thought  it was the supra
I got an ad for his contest to win the Huracan when clicking p. This video
This guy is the best
Put some race headers on it it will sound good and loud
Order your wheels now 👍
AYY
Super dope. My birthday was Oct. 16. STARD Got a race video of my 2016 charger RT on my channel more coming for anyone reading this and need some to watch. Thank you and much appreciated it.
who else thinks he should buy a ferrari stradali
When I clicked on this video, and I no joke got his ad for the purple Huracan.
Why not the F8 turbito 😠😠
liking this new style ngl so much more fun
Question: wasn't there a Lamborghini sent away to be twin turbo'ed???
Widebody the world 🌍
Sunday uploads are amazing and so is that ferrari
8min
i was watching this while i was playing The Crew 2 and i’m using the TRX that was not on purpose lol
I have a friend with a 458 I know how it sounds and it has an fi
imma need a car garage update 😭
wide body the world lessgooooo
Chandler Bing! 😁
YES! Its a good day when Stradman uploads but also when he buys his 458 BACK :)
Watching stradman and his ad came on for the lambo
Stradman be like : "Another one" 😂
Damn. Utah is like Jersey in that regard. NY and PA don’t really care, but man the donut eaters love writing tickets for dark tints.
AYOOOO DAAAMNNN that was totally unexpected  real chad move though
هثایخقنثع عب
Now this is the content I signed up for!! The liberty aventador and 458 are going to be one of the best duos on youtube
So glad you got it back!
The orange juice scene at the end😭😭
Neighbors be like: ah sh.. here we go again my ear
I’m at 0:58 I think it th Supra
800th
Cool you where here in the falls it'd been cool to have seen you on sunnyside I always drive down that road😁👍
Finally James has found a cameraman (even though it’s just his friend)
James should change his channel to a mukbang channel xD
Nothing best a Montreal fresh made bagel and cream cheese!
Did anybody else get an ad with this guy in it as you’re watching his video
YESSSSSS THE 458 thanks you strad
Can u do a day with stradman
2:25 🤣🤣🤣
First Oder the tyres
Pls change the material that you make your dream house from lumbar to back and cement. Put a gintani on the aventador.
Got the Wizza ad with James right before the video and I didn't even notice it was an ad at first
Hell yeah brother
Should get some equal length headers to make the exhaust sound even better
Strad left us there on a cliffhanger ! I can't wait to see what Ferrari he's getting! My guess is Stradale
Here for the Nutter Butter.
Can you please buy the Supra back🥺🥺
Kinda mad I didn't see you. I live in Pocatello Idaho now (Just moved here) And been driving back and forth to Idaho Falls a couple of times to shop, just bad luck on my part, maybe when I get my STI back I'll see you driving around SLC when me and my wife go down there to explore
What Happened To the sound effects??????
Widebody 458!! Yes!
Tomorrow is my exam and I'm searching answer but see Notification 😁and here I am real legend
6:43 “I like Tessa” lol what a freudian slip
I can’t wait to see the liberty walk build!
Send your car to Long Island ny my dad does interior he did cars for Daniel arsham and the clothing brand aime leon dore
How did I get a Stradman ad on this video of him giving away his Lamborghini Performante LOL
I REALLY HOPE ITS THE R8
Next supercar Lamborghini Huracan Performante or Lamborghini Huracan STO?!?! 🤔
Congrats on your new car (kinda) man
You should sell the bugatti for a laferrari... or an enzo..?
The farrari should be Blue like your trex
Yes, he earned 35k from you, but how much tax dose he have to pay on that lol.
Shout out to ma boy Luke, video is way better
I always get the stradman wizza add when i watch him lol
Strad as a Long Island native we’re gonna have to talk abt how u ate that bagel🥲
Would be a good idea to get a bed liner or a spray in liner for the TRX
Hold on to it! The 458s will only continue to go up in value 📈
Buy back your audi tt
bye Audi tt
James I think its time for a gintani f1 exhaust for the widebody aventador
Damn what's the second ferrari that strad purchase👀👀👀
I love seeing more Ferrari's from my favorite YouTubers! 🤜💥🤛
It was well worth the wait...
Nice cam work
he just couldn't stand the wide body kit go to waste now could he
Honestly Luke cam guy pretty good
Was anyone else hoping it might be the Supra
👍 👍 🔧
You need to do a top speed run with the TRex in the desert 🏜 😁😁👍🏻
12:45 PLOTTTT TWIST!!!
I clicked on the video and got an ad for the Lamborghini you’re giving away.
YOU HAVE TO GET THE WIDEBODY ON IT
Imagine driving down the highway and some grown man child is throwing a fit pointing at you, then he rips his tint off his 200,000 car. 😂
when’s the gallardo coming back? that’s my favorite car on the channel lol
Always a good day when strad post. I really wanna see the Ferrari challenge car again tho
PIN ME PLS
YAY!! i cannt belive it the
@stradman 35 hundred is 3,500. 35 thousand is 35,000
Me: sad it's the first day of the week  Stradman: posts a video Me: *becomes happy*
James definitely bought 2ferraris 😭😭
Whatever happened to getting the prescription?
When u said Idaho, I knew it could be Chandler!!!
He's probably getting the new stradale
Find wheels for 458 first🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Always love the little bits after the outro😂😂
He's gonna have to rent another garage here soon🤣
get an svj and gintani tune and i swear you neighbors will despise you
Can you even hear him talking while he is riding... WOW such an awesome car!
I love the 3rd person perspective!
Haha I got the stradman wizza ad haha
STRADMAN IS GETTING WIDER THAN EVER BRUHHH
I really thought it was the purple c8 ;(
Palos: don't worry everyone Strad hasn't posted but I'm sure he's fine!   Strad: ok like every other time Palos makes a video about disappearing, uploads video the day after
James plz get back the supra plzzzz
Something about strad drinking like that at the end made me feel horrendously uncomfortable
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS SHE'S BACK AND NO I DID NOT JUST SCREAM YES AND SCARE MY FAMILY
Finally an upload after a whole week!
I dont know what the car is, but im guessin its that rari you sold
This man full of surprises 😮 😍
Yes
HEY YO!!! It's back!
I hope it’s the Supra😁        It wasn’t the Supra😔
Nahhh don't paint it green smh
Love from India
i think hes getting a ford gt
cmon james i need answers
Why not just hellephant swap the TRX, rather than tune it🤣
It was strange seeing James not holding the camera
Will you buy a bmw ?
I got your wizza ad for the performante before the vid started lol.
James: "Best sounding  V8" F1 cars: "Am I a joke to you?"
1000
Strad been working out ik it!
You should have got a 488
No no way this is not the Ferrari you said you are going to buy I just can't wait 😆
Really??? A 458 widebody...umm that seems familiar...oh bc DDE did it already and a 488 widebody. Com'on Strad...gotta get out of the box bro...need to do something truly different. Content becoming repetitive and slightly boring. Still luv the channel, just not impressed with the 458 build.
James is going to have the sickest Widebody Car Collection in the World if he already doesnt have it.
Loving the quality of this vid
Always watching his video when it come out always 🔥
The floofy dog
camera man back!!!!!
Kinda sad taught it was the supra
2:25 no fist bump sound effects :(
My question is what happened to the gallardo can someone tell me cause i don't know
Mannn waited soo long for a vlog and the announcement broo excited!!!
knew u was gonna buy back the 458 esp since u never sold the wb kit ... really excited for the build and cant wait for them prices to start skyrocketing  but most importantly kudos to Nick and you for giving Luke a job ;)
Well let’s hope no one sits on your Ferrari again
Any one else catch that he said he likes tessa instead of Tesla
Omg I can’t wait to see the 548 lbwk because my favorite ferarri is the 458
Sell the Bug to chandler!!
Stradman is the best YouTuber of all time keep posting bro
I thought this car will be the Ferrari race car but its not. But i am close
I've missed the 458 so much
Finally the music of horse is back 😍.
Emelia Hartford...Wya??

Thought he was buying the mclearan
With many places in my heart I love your videos
I think is not a good deal to buying bck much higher price 🤣  But need u upload fast video becauz i love ur video 😘
The Strad channel is sitting empty :")
Stradman over DDE
love luke being in your videos, wish he would've told us if you're buying a stradale or something else though
When you Are done you should put all the widebody cars together
Lew has family
Bro were is your cybertruck
I’ve wanted this video to happen since you sold it, so glad to see it back
U should have bought that supra 🥲
Hi
When I clicked this video I got a commercial about the Stradman giving away a lambo
Where's the Lamborghini Gallardo??
Amazing but which Ferrari is it?
LMAO I GOT A AD WITH STRADMAN IN IT
HES BACKKKKKKK
I just got a stradman ad when i clicked on the video
Big fan man :)
It’s called inflation every dollar we have is now worth less because of the Democrats giving out too much free money, raising wages and creating fake shortages.
Lew has familt
Bro I love this car so much
Someone tell Strad about window tint scripts
How many cars you gotta buy
I just got your wizza add while watching your video. lol
That drag strip thing is called a "tree"
Yessss widebody the world Soooo pumped for the 458 let's goooo 🔥🔥🔥
LW 458 Round 2!
Who else know a YouTuber with a wide body Ferrari
I think he invested in Tesla
You need a sian
Next video: I’m selling one of my super cars!
Thousands of iterations on your channel, and here we are!
Sup James hope you are doin well Love the cars maybe you should by a Mclaren 570S
Finally! i've been waiting james to upload a video!
Am so happy to see the ferrari back
Didn’t you get an exemption that you were allowed to have tint
i thought he got his  r8 back.. still happy lmfao
Give oscar the mini lambo🤣
This was so easy lol I’m so happy it’s back because this means: WIDEBODY THE WORLD!!!!
LOVE THE CAMERAMAN THEME :) keep it up please
How many cars you have now.
Paint it green or yellow to build up the skittles crew 🤛👊
bro this new outro is legit
Lime*
8:37 we own a another ferrari🤔
Keep that paint plzz
Can this one be like green
This is a W. One of the best sounding cars imo
Let's make the comment 600
Paid 35k more and gave him free promotion to sub to his channel lol. James is so humble 😆
Imiss papa strad.
Oscar marshmallow youpi
This title excited me so much
20 minutes squad 👍🏻👍🏻
Anybody ignoring the Stradman giveaway ad I got before this?
Takes too long to upload a new vid😡 HAHAHAHAHA
YOO THE FIRST AD WAD A WIZZA AD!!!
that smile of james is smugsmile
James finally did it he finally owned al the main super car cars Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ford GT, Toyota Supra, Nissan, Corvette, Tesla, Jew Wrangler, and now finally the Ferrari 458 Spider.
The other Ferrari better be a v12😁
Anyone else get the Huracan Performante givaway add before his own video lmao. Get your bag Strad.
Thumbnail change in 13min
Ayo
bruh i just got a stradman ad
Missing the focus....
Sorry. I just cannot do the Buddy Channel thing. It’s not original. It’s not all that entertaining. It’s all very juvenile.   I loved the old days here. Things have changed so much…. :(
I’m just waiting for him to get a LS swapped Ford ranger
Strad register the 458 in Montana, they don’t care at all.
It's back Baby!!!1
I just got a stradman ad on a stradman video lol
Love the new camera guy let's give him some support 🥰
Finally 458 wide body yea 😁
U got the Cerritos truck trax I wanted 😁
Love your vids keep up the good work
For me the best v12 is the Gordon Murray t.50
I noticed his merch that he has on
James: "Best V8 sounding car ever" F1 cars : "I'm I a joke to you !?!?"
This man has one car per penny I own.
Wow such a amazing  car man  very beautiful
i think we all knew which car it would be
The best car YouTuber after DDE
Hello
Another upload, another good day!
I honestly thought in the thumbnail it was the Lotus Elise
i was just watching "WhistlinDiesel & Stradman "DISAPPEAR"...People LOSE IT" . well something is good now :)
458 is the most beautiful sounding Ferrari, amen❤️
Hi
I'm glad to see the Ferrari coming back to the fleet! I can't wait for the liberty walk!
So finally going to put that wide body kit to good use.
yessss
I feel like James goes through some weird but awesome phases with his cars😂. First he wraps all of them purple. Then he makes them all rainbow and now he’s just wide body everything. What do you think his next phase is going to be
Stonks!
Ngl I completely forgot you had a 458
I knew it when I saw the Ferrari
I knew it...well done bro 😄
chandler kept the purple nation alive by keeping the wrap on the c8
I hope you do a bother cool wrap like Rosa acantis or the blue on the aventador or tj hunts huracan green
That wasted widebody  kit  has a purpose again
I was quite disappointed when you sold the 458 so this video is pretty exciting
i never watched the video yet but i hope it is the supra
😑
Here's a idea turbos maybe🤷🏼‍♂️
U can't argue with strad he's wide bodying the world btw: I'm the owner of Los Santos customs strad can come anytime he wants😅🤫 don't tell anyone 😂
U gonna get a audi r8
James finally got a cameraman... That's awesome!
Man what happend to the lamborghini Gallardo
ow shi.. I forgot about the Ferrari
No more huracan sto
I had a feeling Stradman was going to get a 458 as soon as DDE got theirs done. Cant wait to see what the Stradman does to it.
Hello everyone
yoooo the 458 is back
Lets the widebody commence 😝
Love the cameraman view :)
Do all that work to the 458 then sell it 8-12 weeks later
quickest i have ever gotten to a vid.
Keep up the good work man I love your vids
Back To SEMA In November 2021!!! Kill The Covid-19!!!
I feel like James is gonna have a cameraman now but I hope it doesn’t happen cuz I love when he’s the cameraman himself
the last clip with the OJ lmao
This Thursday is my b day
good job strad!
To be more accurate to your statement that other states around Utah allow it. That would be wrong. They just have more important  things to enforce. But rest assured dark tint is still very much illegal in Arizona.
Got a stradman ad on a stradman video
Sad he's gonna cut up the 458, last of the v8 N/A Ferraris. .
I miss the bugatti
The zooming in and out when Luke’s filming made me feel sick
Like Oscar when he dies he'll buy a new one
-jack ultramotive oh il drive this 458 back to siadol -james im buying bACK MY 458 WEIRD WEEKEND.
I got an ad with the stradman on a stradman video, you love to see it
HE he he
Are u one day gonna buy back the BabyMack
I want the r8 back or he should buy a mk4 supra
Wide body the world
Thanks for illustrating why it MIGHT be a good idea to have property and the ability to register cars in another state.... save on taxes AND you can have your windows tinted.  :)
i have a feeling its the c8 but its not
YAYY FINNALLY POSTED
I love you stradman happy to see u again
Awesome man love it keep it up🥳
ASAN MGA KAPWA PINOY KO DITO MAG SILABASAN KAYOOOOO
i wonder if strad will be putting a widebody on the 458
Love your content dude
That drag light is called a light tree
Hey what happened to the GTR.

I was building my m8 saying that nothing can make me stop for now then this vids comes am like ok maybe just once

Switching between selfie mode and cameraman mode is so dope, I hope that you'll keep doing that in future videos
Yess..love that car so much
pleez put a gt3 kit on it it's gonna be the word first 458 gt3 spider (don't use the libertywalk wide body kits ducktail use a gt3 wing instead  it's gonna look much better)
