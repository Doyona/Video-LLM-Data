Well maybe I should tune a syllable I’m able to cable tie you and torture you till you die fly get the Norton for the scene phones teams a team expendable more then probable the government don’t like us coz we taught they as good as a naught in cricket if there grass on the wicked turn wicked and stick it if it over 18 or 21 don’t fuss me we all adults whose fault line is that I collapsed it must of been mine wanna look into my mind you’ll find I stand over governments like avvot having a cry when we atttacked in stealth melting ice caps still fresher then death in the hood
What’s good what’s good well the hood ain’t but there a few saints paint your own picture when I dance on the richters her knickers wet so she rips them off I’m hard not soft not going to change my ways plays the game so I let her walk the fun in the chase masked up face give her a scare to be fair the score is square how dare you call me a gimmick I’m Irish never understand the luck of the Irish and Aussie ex militias founding the ground pounding it tinie tempeh it’s an earthquake give the world a shake and take millions of lives drive it like Jordan aerial connection with the net don’t forget china to Tibet

Ngl didn't think we'd get a SR x Poundz joint but this song lived up to its reputation When SR dropped the "I MADE MORE THAN HALF A MILL OFF, OF A TRACK - NOW EVERYONES HATING ON MAN" I realised that the heights that he's reaching are mad Glad he's getting paid and can now focus more on creating music

🤯🤯💫💫
Typically a black rap gang  wank video!  A load of fat ugly women  trying to look sexy,   two hundred  hangers on  bouncing around in their best polar explorers jackets .. usually in the height of summer! Why wouldn't you.. token clip stood outside a big house that clearly nobody there could afford.  Talking about guns and terrible music.  Nothing new there then.  Typical video format that's been used for 30 years.. time to be original  and do something different.
been waiting for this banger , THIS is what the drill scene needed 😈🔥
This is hard wallahi 🔥🔥
😤✅Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad🔥🐐 need another one from this duo🚀🥶
