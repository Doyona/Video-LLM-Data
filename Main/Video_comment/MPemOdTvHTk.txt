i feel bad for gekko at the start
Miss those days😢
Up up down down left right left right b a start  this is familiar 🤔  also the blowing of mags like a game cartridge, so good
Gewässerbett
Brim is the goat bro
Why not make a show like cyberpunk did or league of legend did
0:02 seme- ??
WHY IS WINGMAN NOT GEKKO’S SIGNATURE JEEZ HE IS SOOOOOO CUTE
PRESS PLAY  Move like Replay
Wingman wanted to play the game so badly
In the beginning, he looks so depressed
2:55 WHY DOES OMEN LOOK SO GOFFY WHAT DID HE DO?
love the desingns riot makes❤
Taking the game out and blowing on it then putting it back in 😂😭😭😭
I forgot how to get these animations. Someone pls tell me
most expensive bundle in the game
I hope there will be another bundle such as this bundle ,I really sad i cant buy it....
it's so cool the idea that brim have the highest score cause it belongs to him. and these kind of games are old and so are brim which is the oldest
AHHHHHH finally get a revenge 🎉
1:48 even after he's revenge he get humiliate
my lawyers advised me to not make a joke about brim and gekko in the first scene
I wish I could buy this but 120 US dollars I could buy a copy of black ops 6 and a copy of Minecraft
Who’s pala?
Wingman is so cute back to the sofa
Please bring this collection back 😭🙏🏽
new ringtone acquired
gumball reference?
Blowing on it is immaculate and absolutely accurate
Didnt know Kay/O and Brim actually played video games 😂😂😂 so many things ive missed...
:)
00:20 i feel bad for gekko
It's so cool that the video ends with the player blowing in the game capsule
Gekko and Brim hanging out playing old videogames is so wholesome
I subscribed can you please cancel the one century suspension you gave me i beg you ( username - not a sus )
Gekko: How Old is Brim?🤨🤔  Brim Stone: Look, I May Be Old I Can Look Experience I Can Show You What You Want😏😉
I sue
God, I love how Radiant Entertainment System is the best reference to Nintendo Entertainment System(NES)
AZIZZZZ
I just peeped Kayo played the game
My fav bundle. Phantom 🫡 i got this
I LOVE THAT GEKKO HAS A SPIDER-MAN/IRON MAN RELATIONSHIP WITH BRIM 🥹🥹🥹he wants to be in with the big guys but he’s just not ready yet T^T  and gekko’s shiny puppy eyes OOOOUGH I LOVE HIM SO BAD
como ayudaba a limpiar carnalito ㅜㅜ
why is wingman so cute in animations
Jesus Christ brim got a 1.2mil for a score?? Who gave this guy the turtle stair exploit
cypher is dying again
THIS IS UNRELATED BUT I HAVE 1 BILLION THROWES IN MY RANKED GAME AND NOW I RANK DOWN
I can’t believe it’s already been 6 months
for how long did brim play the game to get this score lmao
WINGMAN IS SO CUTE
Imagine getting killed by furry
Xtrawdktra who who who who who yeah 20 points are ha ha
1:48 PLS full version! 😍😍😍
I swear everytime I feel bored on yt, I always return to watch this trailer.
Very awesome 5 stars but very overpriced
Brim the gamer
Wingman hiding lol
I like how gekko is sad that he has to set up everything in his room
am i the only one who loves this song right on 2:51
2:31 the way wingman hides behind the couch is soo adorablee loll
Tbh now i am convinced pala and marc are going to be future agents
0:14 both Gekko and Wingman have same movement 😂😂
Wing man always got your back   Brim entering the scene   Wingman: peace out amigo your on your own
Shouldve uses akuma's raging demon
I want the song used in the beginning
the only thing i hate in this bundle is the price tag💯💯🔥🔥
bro they did the old blowing into the cartage trick 😭
Release the first song pls TT
Cypher got moves tho dam
Is the score board  leak for 2 new agent next  to realease, pala and marc?
Brim being a cool dad is very accurate
They gotta release these remixes
i dont like the game but this is  the best thing  i ve ever seen ALSO ENDING WAS GOLD !
Just opened the video looking at the comments, first word I hear sounds like sem*n, nice.
What about 'up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start'? is that for something in game?
Arcade Style Agent
I seriously regret not buying the whole bundle
gekko was in pure shock while brimstone left.
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. Valorant needs an anime in that art style
brim do be old tho
When can we get a tv show?
you can see that brim made a reference to the Xbox as he said A & B and not X & B. as valorant just partnered up with Xbox.
QUE PENA DA ESTE JUEGO MALISIMO EL PEOR JUEGO DE TIROS QUE E PROBADO EN MUCHO TIEMPO
This is like every Millennials and Early Gen Z’s Retro Games Dream, Gekko wondering how an Old TV and Consoles work feels so freaking Heartwarming when take in the Fact when you Realize Gekko is probably Gen Alpha and this is almost Generational bridging when Brimstone sat beside him and gave him a smile
looks like i aint eating for a week
Dude the outro song is fire, anyone knows the name of it?
Shut your feet, and the team looks weird, and the team is really embarrassed
the way wingman hides lmao
Upload the Knock out theme to YouTube or Spotify fgs!!!
the beast trailer ever
When gekko said brake time I feel that's the real life
Wagwan
u have so many cheaters why u dont do nothing about this
Begging riot to bring back the arcane sherrif day 1
VALORANT PLS KICK LOTUS
MUSIC FULL VERSION!!!
Dannnnngggg that op looking fresh now I can see why it cost around 11,000 vp😂 great price for a great pass 😊
i hope nintendo and konami doesn't sue this xDD
I’m gonna laugh so hard if Nintendo uses them over RES
anyone know original music (backsound) of this bundle video?
dear valorant, can you recreate your music video die for you? i think it was 1 or 2 years ago that it was released it was really good but i want it to be even better! Its obviously your choice but im just suggesting <3.  From Bunny
Riot should make a TV series .....
No No NO! You don't use the Red and White when you have Coaxial. Audio inputs are if you want to use an external speaker system, you don't hook it up to the TV. The TV, if using coaxial goes to default CH 3 or CH 4 with audio on the coaxial. I know it's old Tech but come on zoomer.
Whether you like or don’t like Brim already; he’s AWESOME. Especially here (Kinda makes me wanna play as him now)
No one noticed grac and pala on the leaderboard so that meand these two names will be the new 2 agents
I will never financially recover from this purchase
Gonna make them lots of cash. That's all
Music is terrible ...not made by a musician.
Reminder that the Valorant series passes itself 30 to 50 years in the future from now, so the fact that Brim owns an old Arcane game series is even more surprising than it would be nowadays
Idk if anyone knows about this or not but the last line Brim said: "Up Up Down Down..." is actually an easter egg for revealing hidden themes of Wallpaper Engine on Steam....
NES nintendo entertainment system
Can you release the full song to this bundle
bruh this is outrageous lmao
Can we find soundtrack anywhere?
where are the sprays?
They should've kept the dance dance revolution finisher
I love these videos 😭 <333
Yo anyone know if this song's realeased as an actual song or something?
aint no way brim just said pass the sticks lmao
Cypher died 2 times
The return of PIXEL BITS!!!!! LEEEZZ GOOOW!!! ☝️👊✊🥰😍😘🎂🎉🥳💖🎈
Waaait whos Pala and Marc?
Only people from the 90’s will understand the last clip 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who are Pala and Marc?????
Who is Pala and Marc in the leaderboard? 🤔🤔
who is pala on the leaderbord i can tell who the other's are but pala?
what was Dr.Disrespects logo doing in there?
Wow brims cheating
Bruh... The full combo it's almost 2 months of work in my country, eip
1:48 Please give me extended version!
So cool
I hope riot is paying the devs and designers well enough for their skill!
Best bundle in the game’s history
Sage looks Indian tbh 😄
A good skinline after some mediocre ones so many months! Honestly, should've bought this instead of my RGX phantom...
as i saw the game background video it turns out brimestone cleaned the room afterall
Wait a sec........SO BRIMS A GAMER?!?!?!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
at 2:13, is it only possible to "play" when using ghost?
That reload is the best
I wanna buy a akin so bad but I can't
RIOT YOURE RICH, JUST ASK A PROPER COLAB WITH CAPCOM
WE NEED THIS SOUNDTRACK!
up up down down.... <-- perfect nostalgia to end the vid!
jett trolling wtf
brim's voice tho
Wonderful!
I want to play these games. Riot. Get to it!
Wingman trying to play it cool is hilarious.
1:27 1:33 This music OMG
Now can we have the individual music for it?
How many times you watched this trailer? Me: Yes
That music is fire ngl
Brim just proved why he is the wholesome dad of the group
Lol brim is lazy
THE RELOADING ANIMATION WAS STRAIGHT UP FROM NES CARTRIDGE! SUPER COOL!    too expensive though...
imagine riot making a whole series on this and it comes on netlfix
wingman be hiding in the back XD
I feel like Brimstone might have been a dad
2:27 who's Pala and Marc?
dayummm
di tiup dulu dong, ANJAAY ! 😂😂😂 ... ❤
if any of you noticed, the line that Brim says at the end, "Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start" is actually a special Alexa command. Try saying it to your Alexa.
SO SICCKKK🎮🕹
New Update: My KILLJOY cannot use key 'C' for swarm grenade, I have to change it to other key for now.. Please Fix.. It's affect playstyle
rich people things

que vídeo incrível!
Wait who is PALA and MARC?
DDR arrows are wrong, literally unplayable
where can I get the song?
cool but way to expensive
this plus gaia 2 im geuus i aint eating for the next month
Brimstone must’ve played that when he was really young, like maybe 10-15 years old.
it isnt trash but i don't really know why ppl is praising this. the only sick things are the finishers
I need a 10 Hour Remix of the 8-Bit songs HOLY MOLY 😍
this so cool you can change your finishers
So Brimstone isn't actually good at the game, he just used cheats.
not bad
발로란트 대리 신고는 어디서하나요
Who's Pala and Marc?
aren't we gonna talk about the price???? 11k VP ?! HELLO???
Bro tbh im just vibing to the music
Pala and marc new agent?

Amazing bundle👍🏾

Only Op has that incredible reload animation?
HOLY FUGG
But like...why does the bundle have to be over $100? I could buy a whole meal from red lobster and a whole game for that price???
2:27 so next agents could be Pala and Marc?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Anyone knows where I can find this music? It's so catchy

Father and son
Yeah of course...... Cypher dies again
Dead game

Ayo, the interaction between Brimstone and Gekko was so wholesome! Kinda like a father and son bonding time.
Fortnite on steroids be like:

The name of the theme of this trailer plus the one on the knockout variant
BRING BACK ARCANE SHERIF
Man watching this hype me for lol arcade event

The creator of the story for this scene must be a filipino, you know, blowing your lungs off just to clean a game cartridge before putting it back to the console. LMFAO.

SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!?????
Awesome man
Brims like an old fatherly figure.

👍

bruh is why is everyone ignoring that brimstone is caussally a cheater and a true gamer hahaha
i thought bro was gonna start singing
not worth $200 calm down
I like how wingman hides behind the couch when brim catches them slacking off 😂
Amazing!!!
Absolutely love the fact that the agents or at least some of them are gamers themselves. I need more lore and a tv show in this exact animation style!
Not the white American making the Mexican clean 💀
꺄아아아아아아아아액

the background music is so fun and nostaligc
the music isss awsomeeeeee
The last inspect is only for brimstone by the way :)
Street fighter phantom actually sounds like the street fighter attacks!
Ghost is the best and the trailer is very good.But ı think bulldog,knife and operator are bad.The collection is so expensive (11.900 vp).But ı will buy ghost pleyer cards buddies and maybe phantom.
no one's gonna talk about the background music? aight! it's so lit i wanna download it.
i refused to pay money on this trash game.... but i might break under this
Why is there a pokemon in this game?
🤮🤮🤮 worst bundle after ego
I need a serieee
No Hadouken in the bundle😮
spectrum 2.0 lol
Imagine having a street fighter collab with this one.
Whats the music at 0:23 ? ❤❤❤
THE RELOADDDDDDD AJHFBAJWHFBAJFJKF
Personally not for me, but I can see the appeal.
2:30 wingman hiding is the cutest thing ever
The way Brim blew the catridge Nostalgic :")
Seems like Glitchpop spectrum and ion had some fun together
you need to lower the price its very expensive
Why is my wallet getting lighter 😢
ok riot but do this with every gun in the game and you will be swimming in nostalgia bucks
The one bundle that i would regret in the future that i couldn't afford
Day 1 of asking for South African servers
I saw this I'm shocked what let's guuuu
Yo pause. 0:52 I thought only Disney gives this kind of sublime images
1:34 Got a Cypher again Breh
i mean atleast cypher d1ed with a style this time
I wish these to be more affordable
today only at 70-100$
Cypher died...again but at least it look much more better and funny😂😂
The song in the beginning is such a bop I want a full version badly
Omg I read a comment the other day that was like “it would be funny if they gave hands as a melee weapon, it would be funny to see ppl knife fight that way” AND HERE WE ARE HAHA
i'm soooooooo excitedddddd
South african Servers please 🙏 we have such a big community
There goes the sugar daddy
This be like when u camp some enemies u won't be bored case can 'play' ur gun haha

Oh Brimstone a GAMER gamer
Haven't seen a skinline this good in a while

Twist: new agent name begin with Pala & Marc
Safe smiling in the end 🥰🥰
Let me guess, 80 dollars for the set
Wild 🔥
Yes, just yes.
0:45 this part rlly reminds me of regular show when they had to get chairs for a birthday party and they found several arcade machines lol
Who is Marc? Is Marc agent 8? 2:28 new theories coming up!
if this outro music makes it in game and replaces the loading music i would literally cream
Amazing bundle!!!
valorant employees need a raise of millions bc all tho im not buying these, this is amazing
was that steve blum
Yes, cypher got bullied again but bro that finisher is actually amazing
Bro "Up up down down left right left right B A Start" 😢
The NES cartridge reference in the thumbnail is marvellous

Mommy Sage at the end
0:21 - 0:23 He looked so sad when he saw the broom :C
Mark and pala are they a upcoming agents?
#4 Pala and #5 Marc? New Agents?
papi brim just one chance
and THATS how u present a new skinset
Jesus Christ loves us all  This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 1 John 4:10.
Cant wait to pick these up off the ground
street fighter  and Fatal Fury <3
Wonder who is Pala and Marc

Pala Marc ?
Now they absolutely GOTTA release the music
I’m copping this one
yall worth how much, and you cant come up with a single original idea?
adios a mi dinero
Why does sage have a different outfit at the end
I think we all agree that the variants are direct references to street fighter dance dance revolution and megaman right?
what is the music?
RITO GOTTA RELEASE THE SOUNDTRACK OF THIS!
we all talking about the trailer animation but the 8-bit theme remix is actually fire
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
킬 모션 당하는건 여전히 싸이퍼야
Absolutely love. Valorant animation and ideas.❤
If you wull look at the 4th and 5th place, their names are PALA and MARC respectively,wonder who they are?
2:28 Who is Pala and Marc?
Well, goodbye my wallet, it was nice knowing ya😢
the blowing thing to the cartridge to make the game work again OMG! that really brought me back to nintendo 64 and zelda lol
The score of brimstone remind me something……. 🤔🤔🤫🤫

*Sigh* How much?
Yessssss more Brim related stuff. I'm buying this one for sure. Great bundle.
Pls release the music for this trailer, its perfection
brim is cheating wtf

1:47 Cypher is dead again 😅xd
When are we gonna see skye on a animation
mega man / street fighter 2 / idk the one with the arrows
Can’t lie I was blown away by the whole video, but that ending… yeah that made me feel complete.
The music at 0:23 was giving me mad melatonin vibes (the game not the drug)
I'M SLIM SHADY, YES I'M THE REAL SHADY! ALL YOU OTGER SLIM SHADIES ARE JUST IMMITATING!
I love this question: who old is brim 😂 (0:57)
Riot never fails with these cinematics.
any time I, a 38 year old, am on Valorant and kids are like "why tf is an old a__ man like you playing video games" I'm like WHO DO YOU THINK MADE THE VIDEO GAMES
i am once again excited about a game
This is very cool. Reliving my childhood memories. Nostalgic
Pala and Marc ?
OML THİS SET İS TOTAL FİREEEEE but its way too expensive (thats alr at least its worth it)
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
THIS IS AMAZING
Why Cypher get disrespect like that... 1:48
sick bundle
Look at 'em moves. Could totally rival MJ.
The reload animation! Perfection!!
Until I saw the finishers, I thought it was mid.
110 euros? It's a pass sadly
His lil face when he realizes made me wanna cry! He's so adorable, lil Gekko.
big spiderman vibes from geko
This will be a bad week for my bank account.
SHEEEEEEEEESH
Wingman not bein his E kinda hurts.

By far the best bundle made. Props to whoever at riot came with this idea
dude the video is awesome
These idea are so wild, props to the team !
ayo i need those songs for blue/purple variants n de trailer. amma make the best arcade character on my gaym
I think the concept is way cooler than the actual gun model not gonna lie. Probably still gonna get it because retro gaming is always awesome
as usual . valo music and sound effects are still as amazing as ever
I love this, so much nostalgia
Bro I got Rent to pay!
this thematic song is so good
I’m really hate that half the player base won’t get brims reference at the end
TAKE MY MONEY
Finishers sheeeeeeshhhh
Daddy Brim <3
Wingman also wants to play 🥺

This is might be the best skinline u guys have come up with
I need that.
2:27 Pala and Marc??
Hold up, sage out of uniform? Why's that there?
whoever thought of this needs to be the ceo of riot
Ofcourse the reload gotta be cleaning the cassette XD
WHY did they not give firing sounds to any of them except the op? Waste
i kinda hear the ken theme
the ghost is disappointed !
The DDR is the best
The video poster is like a super nintendo box
Pala and mark 2:27  new agents confirmed?
Yo what if whatever brim said at the end is an Easter egg of some sort
I like how wingman hides when brim enters
make a battle royal xd
Good old days
Hello, Nintendo?
Beautiful 🙂

Con solo la ghost me compro mejor el minecraft. ¡¡¿¿NOS QUEREIS DEJAR SECOS DEL TODO COMO QUE 2950 SOLO LA GHOST DE VERDAD??!!
The DDR is making me stare so hard at that OP
Wouldve been sick if the guns where actually 8 bit
Watching this video on x1.5 gives it a different vibe. A better one
Friday night funkin vibe
THATS SICK MAN IT BRING ME BACK FRR🔥🔥🔥
Leaks are saying this bundle gonna be 10,000 vp. That true? It can't be right? That's absurd lmao
name of the song please 😮
I DONT WANT IT, I NEED IT!!!
take all my money and my soul
My wallet is gonna hate me 😩
Just imagine if a Shorty was in the bundle and they used the Classic Doom reload animation
the last few bundles helped me saved some money. looks like it ends here.
On the TV at the end when you see the scores. Who are "Pala" and "Marc"?
It's evolving but backwards.
woah
Riot Games don't miss
I haven't spent money on Valorant yet, but I'll change that for this bundle
Give me some Pixelgun 3D vibes
the music is so good 🎶🎶🎶🎶

Actually the best animations on anything but the oni sword
silly riot games… a coaxial cable doesn’t make a click noise
Super MEH
For the 90s kids ❤

Too expensive
Few only who will understand what Brimstone said at the end of this insane video!
Papa Brim teaching a kid something
The best pack BY FAR!

CLEANNNN
Yay time to cancel grandma’s  health systemy
Bruh pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaseee tell me that at the end is the operator inspect animation pleaseeeee that is epic!!!!!
Brim is a sweat
now the thing is how much does it cost?
No one talking about how sad Gekko looked after Brim did him dirty like that?
So Pala and Marc will be the new agents? 2:28 Where Pala maybe from future and Marc from past?
AWESOME!
Who is ready to empty their pockets 😂😂😂
Why is it always cypher!!
2:28 PALA MARC 🤔new agent names ?

aww poor wingman 😢
We really need a animation series like Arcane in Valorant universe. These vids look awesome!
how is pala and marc?? just me that saw that?
Would’ve been literally 100% perfect if the Dab wasn’t one of the moves 😭 So close. But this Bundle is amazing and I’m gonna buy it anyway.
ah more death for cypher
Brim with that billion score, what the heck, that guy is a pro gamer 😂
bro they put a video game in my video game
1:47 bro got some skillz
So, new Yordle Agent?
wingman hid😭😭😭
i'm not going to buy it. but the referencing and details are great.
Bro brim doesnt have the top score, cypher does.
Here goes my salary, again...
how much
Cyhper dead is not enough   CHYPER DAB
Meh
Okey but where do i find the first beat doh?
shut up and take my money XD
That moment when you realize spike spiegel is brimstone’s voice actor and he’s sitting down to play retro games on the couch like it’s a cowboy bebop episode
After seeing the score legend has it in an alternative timeline brim is still undefeated
i like this Brimstone
this will cost my kidney
In THE MERA game, players can be completely immersed in the world where they can customize their own character and team up with other Meracians to explore this planet together 💎
2:16 character design and ability really reminded me of pip from paladins
Take all of my money
Man with the different finishers, animations tf this would be so worth it
in that game gekko was playing : brim scored first and gekko second then kayo then 4th is pala and 5th is marc , who's pala and marc or they just a random names
NO WAYYY THIS IS SO COOL 😭😭😭
The 30fps valorant clips hurt my eyes
The sniper reload blowing on the cartridge 🤌
THE RELOAD IS SICK
Great i am going to play only CS now .
i love how creative they get with the skinlines and how unique the inspect and finishers look. Im hoping for a nice battle pass as well
I wish I could play it again
More Sage and Omen lore.. Oh I love this
I love how brims like "lemme show you some tricks"....   Then proceeds to enter cheats at main menu 😂
WOW!!!!!!
Riot redeemed themselves with this one 😊😊😊
i luv the way little wingman hides when brim showed up
BRO ROCKET LEAGUE EASTER EGG

THE RELOAD IS GENIUS
Tô até imaginando preço disso kkkkkkkkkkk
Yesss!!!!! For us 90's old mf!
Brim being such a dad to Gekko 😂😂😂
K.O. = Kayoooo 😂
They should make a shorts series named "Finding Omen" where Omen just travels the world & chills. I think that dude deserves some happiness.
kkkkkkkk o cypher dançando kkkk ameii
Was that a vandal that had the shoryuken K.O. !?!? Okay, this is a must buy. 😂
they will keep on humiliating cypher til the end 😭
sage

hey riot can u put a zombie game mode pls
Wtf ! it's soo good
I didn’t knew Cypher liked DDR
caralhoooooooooow ele assoprando o cartucho
Blowing on the game cartridge to cool it down to reload brings back a weird sense of nostalgia
Okay, thats cool
this reminds me of Audition game.
Now i wanna get last shot just to see the dance
1:27 why does it sound like a rickroll
JoJo reference 1:21 😏
Guys if we just say it looks terrible in the comments it won't be $1000

would be awesome if the graphics on the scope is the agent who is on the crossharir instead of a fixed animation, or maybe after u kill the agents it show a pixelated version of the said agent
This is insane ❤

In terms of these productions and all stuff, Riot produces the best.
and broke ppl cant get this because it need 10K VP
Might be the best collection yet
OMG! I really love DDR style!
this game never disappoints us
If only it wasn't $100
That will be 1k€ sir
The knife in the orange style is sick
Please don't delete the arcade on range please it will remind of brimstone childhood
i know this collection's going to be hella expensive but i WILL be selling my left kidney to cop this
what's sage wearing
*generic "I love that..." comment*
the finishers are beautiful, jesus

The Op inspect is what got me
AWESOME!

Sage looking badass at the end
bro you kidding me right i thought the next bundle wouldnt be that cool so i bought the gaia vandal
Who is PALA and MARC on score board??🤔🤔
As a just dance super fan. Just take my money.
Its cool and all, but can we talk bout how they just electrocuted that poor boy at 0:33 ?
at least Kay/o got 3rd place
Brooooo insaneee
god i love playing valorant
usually isn't there 4 variants? so 4 finishers? but we only saw 3 of them
someone plz give me money i want it 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Who are Pala and Marc after gekko and kayo in the leaderboards at the end
bro y does valorant have to do this if valorant wasnt there bro i swear i wouldve lived in a mansion
Oh my god blowing the mag like its a disk brings back so many memories of blowing into that nintendo 64
I mean the finishers look amazing and the guns look pretty nice but the lack of a special shoot noise is kinda sad, they could’ve done something like GUN and it would’ve fit so well
TAKE. MY. MONEY
NAHHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS INSANEEEEEEEE
2:30 love the way how wingman hides after seeing brim
Nah
I love how Riot games put so much effort to these promotion videos!
Please made a series!
Love the classic blowing on it to make it work! 😂

BROOOO so far the most creative collection by FARRR
Cool and all but how much will it cost me
Cypher's death cinematic is getting interesting nowdays
Never disappoints 😅
And im here already thinking about its 2.0 anyone having the same thoughts?
I hope it won't be ultra bundle because compared to Protocol or Elderflame it is a garbage collection
YO WHO IS GONNA BUY ME THIS?IM BROKE?
Best bundle of 2023 so far
Ohhhh Man this is EPIC!!!
i love this vandal but i need to see gekko room done
Bro chill my girlfriend uses this website.... 😮😂
can I run valorant on 32 bit?
give me
only buying the phantom cus this shi too expensive 💀
gekko look like frank ocean but sounds like jaden smith
Watch out who you call old...
Why this bundle is so expensive
the fact that each variant is a different game makes it so much cooler
TOP
dont do this guys... im broke
How old is brim?!!! See score *realizes*😂
Dude, the way wingman just hides behind the couch XD 2:31
I'M CRYING OMG RIOT PLS HIRE ME
soooooo skye will never get a cinematic model i guess,,,??

I'm crying with happiness. it's brilliant
Who’s Pala and Marc???
New agent name leak
Are you winning son moment
of curse cypher will die
At least Cypher died in style
this looks AMAZING
Man they keep changing Brimstone's model
I LOVE hearing Steve Blum! Hes such a GREAT voice actor!!!
my wallet is crying from now
Please Riot make a show for valorant just like you did in arcane LOL pls
Is the fourth a surprise?
bro they be killing cypher again
Valorant please add this 8bit themed song for the main menu ❤
Даня Милохин в валоранте
I love the arcade music
This is epic.
why expensive and beautiful crops come to phantom

Wingman hiding from the brim at @2:30 😂😂
:3333

My Wallet is gonna cry after this bundle release
ahhh the reload!!!!!!!!! old man be like still got it!
Even though I don't even play the game anymore, I %100 know that I will be buying this bundle. It still amazes me Riot got such great designers.
how expensive will this bundle be? 120€? but looks very nice
Ok but Cypher dancing was amazing lol
sarpbc? :D
hoooolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly ssheeeeeeeeeeesh

I'm sure a looot of people (myself included) are loving this
Who is pala and marc maybe next character
This is so sick!
gamer brim
2:26 idk who pala and marc is but my guess is prolly new agents name
Take my money already🎉
this is the best skinline in all valo :D:D
Marc is Omen's real name 🤨🤨😱😱😱😱😱🤨😱🤨😱🤨😱🤨
that couch inflated when Brim sits, and rises Gekko a little. sheesh
If they only put as much effort into getting rid of cheaters and Smurf’s I would still play ranked
"That's gonna be 100$ sir"
i will buy it i love it
Take my money
Fortnite?
the finishers are only good
RETRO TIME.....
for the low price of your mortgage
need this music!!!!!!!!!!!
Really cool
OK, so.... Who are Pala and Marc?
actual insane!
TOOO CLEANNN
Dude u included a ton of things retro games used to do W their controllers in this brundle. Commands, satisfying buton click and even blowing the cartridge on the op when inspecting. Shame there isn't a vandal.8/10. Rly awsome sauce🤩
Ok... Just wow
By the way if you added together all of the high scores from the teaser a couple of days ago, you'd get a number of 10800, which is gonna be the price I think.
Oyy
Fun fact: When brim says "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start" that triggers the super Alexa mode if you say it to Alexa. You can give it a show if you have an Alexa ;)
Pala ? Marc ?
Who's Pala and Mark ?????
Ultra collection?
Wait, every gun has a different finisher?
Please be cheap. I beg you.
Take my money
Best bundle ever GG
New agent  ?
Give a bonus pay for the employee who invented these finishers
bgm??
wow those hours spend after school Nostalgia , Gg Finishers<3
Cool😮
I thought this was gonna be lame af but it’s actually really cool
Pala marc new agent
this is the best bundle yet it’s so good
The main question who is pala and marc??
It's a save buy...I'm 43 now and this kicks me back to the cool old NES, SNES times etc
The finisher and the animations... So good
is this trailer the sole reason why they charge the bundle for 10k vp
👾
THATS PRETTY FCKN COOL
i absolutely despise this game but the trailers are beautiful
i think the spray will likely be the ingame scoreboard
litterally ripped off megaman with the blue last kill effect, hope ya'll are ready for an lawsuit xD
Finisher IS the best ....
Well good buy to my wallet!
I wish Riot put out some arcade songs too. How nostalgic
pogggggg
Omggggg
"that will be 300 bucks just for the bundle itself thank you very much"
Cypher😢
when it costs more than my allowance ill sell my kidneys for it
So cute
10700 Predicted possible price!!  Overpriced!
yep impressed by trailer alone
D - * - M - N ! So much worth the hype...
MAIS J ACHETEEE
was about to buy the black market vandal and saw this, waiting timeee
wow the finisher is so cool
Amazing, just f-ing amazing
It's a real shame that it's so expensive
Our Cypher Still die but this time he not die alone and also he die with Style :))
i like how wingman hid so funny
2:25 PALA! MARK! Next agents??
Funky Friday?
So, phx's name is Marcus and astra is pala something. interesting. Also, go brim!.
OMG!! I want is!!!
10000VP ladies and gentlemen.
Why can't u miss, Riot!?
BEST BUNDLE EVER
this is sooo cute LOL
bundle or battlepass?
видишь ли, чувак, это то, о чем я говорил в одиночной миссии, я Рэди. Такой нервный. Поверь, это не очень здорово, малыш. А теперь слушайте внимательно. сегодняшняя миссия заключается... в том, что я сделаю... оставляю тебя наедине с этим. Йоооо... СЛОМАЙ Тайме! Сколько лет Бриму? Что, что! Вот и все. разрумяни это! ПРИВЕТСТВУЮ ТЕБЯ! Передай палочки, малыш. Приручите этого старого пса, чтобы он показал вам несколько трюков. Что это было еще раз? Вверх, вверх, вниз, влево, Вправо, Влево, вправо, Б, А, старт.
Me during whole video: F...skins, this cute little baby Gekko and his slime friends are my new meaning of life
L collection
This is amazing
Whoever came up with this should get a res (raise)
Blowing on the thingy to make it work.. brings back memories. Val really know their players
Now this is called a bundle.
take my money imma at least buy the Phantom
Pala and Marc?  I found it :) 2:27
THATS SIICK
I’m so getting this next week when I get paid. I’m so excited
"RES me" has a whole another meaning now
take my money riot
1:35 Cypher dies again
brim got high scores coz he cheating hahaaha
we need a netflix valorant series
yayyy
Cypher agian😢
Ain't no way the toaster got less score than gekko
bro why phantom... :((((((
VALORANT CAN WE PLEASE GET THE IGNITION BACKROUND MUSIC BACK IM BEGGING YOU
a little bit disapointed in terms of design but different stuff for variants and finishers are cool tho
bye bye wallet
Let's go, my money are totally gone
THIS IS SO SICK😮😮😮
Haven't seen a skinline this good in a while
omfg i love it
WAIT! isnt up,up,down,down,left,right,left, right the arrow key bind to get past the "server unavailable" problem back in the League days? like S1 launcher or smth? i can remember there was some stuff we had to do... i'm not 100% sure it was that tho
I have the highest level of valorant 1013 level
2:27 hmm, maybe Pala and Marc are new agents
THIS FINISHER
aw man, i guess im bouta be broke again
the melee reminds me of the nintendo power glove
innovation at it's peak💥
brim was that cool kid in school
Those are siiiiiick.
what if this is a hint for valo coming in console
Considering Valorant is in like 2050, Brimstone is actually a zoomer HAHAHAHA
Soooo sick 🫨
0:52 why does wings hand looks like a dong
who is pala and marc?
hurry up an make a movie or tv show already i'm tired of being tickled
Just Wow
am i the only one that thinks that sage at the end looks like makima? (probably yes)
Çokiyilan
Man I gotta snatch a wallet or two for these dire times.
Nintendo power glove XD
This is why i want to work at riot its just so cool imagine making stuff like this
Wait now I gotta know how old is brim?? gotta be on his 50s or smthing right?
<3
Come on Riot. My gamertag has been Arcade for 10 years…. Don’t do me like this😫💸
Brim bugging
lil bro taking a nap on the couch😭❤️
Now Brim's line "They called me an old dog? Heh, I'll show em how many tricks i know." made much more sense.
Its always cypher 😢
Oh welp time to go broke again
Man wtf ,that is awesome.
Best
LET MY WALLET REST RIOT
Common wingman W
Well, there's goes my money
AMAZING!
Omg
Best bundle so far
Cool collection But fr How old is Brim if he still have stuff like this?
Lol those finishers. But really love the reload animation
Cypher dabbed
2:27 New 2 agents forshadowed?
Cypher been dying so much that he loves it now and is dancing to it
r these battlepass?
1:47 Cypher: I died again... 1:49 Cypher: But I'm gonna die with S T Y L E
0:50 I thought he should have blown it. But obviously Gekko wouldn't know and Riot wanted to surprise us with the reload animation at the end😉. As a late 80's kid this gives me nostalgia☺️
I wish you didn't buy Radiant Ent. and made them stop working on Stoneheart
this is so retro...
Sage, can I get a RES?
very unique and original well done valorant (not sarcasm)
WHHHHHHHATTT?! BRIMSTONE CONFRIMED CANOTICALLY RACIST??!??!?  brimstone mains, rise up!
Nobody wants to talk about the music? If someone knows tell me please
Who even had this idea just so cool, and the ability to convert this idea to an actual in-game thing, just wow. Hats off. 👏🙌
makes sense since brim is gen z
Brimstone literally cheating
I NEED IT
Music and Animation company made another certified banger.
Too good
When it showed the learderboard, it said there was 2 other characters. Leak?
Bank Account be like: I GOT NOTHING HERE, SPARE ME!
God dammit looks like I’m putting more money into this game
2:15 paladins pip
WHY TEHERE ISNT A VANDAAAAAAL
2:18 Is that Arcade Rumble?
Waste
that reload in the last part is perfection
Nice concept
Caught me off guard...
finishs onlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Riot are sponsore of mine jor searching, i rly want to buy it
Cypher dies with style and it's the coolest finnisher
Uhhhh riot… you’ve definitely outdone yourself! Someone needs a raise! Thank you all the artists and designers who worked on these they’re SICK
It's $100
Time for our wallets to lose some weight
this is to retro and i like it
невероятно круто
the inspect and reload brooo,  they went all in on this one
UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, SELECT, START!
Not only does cypher die way too much, they made him dab. Poor guy can’t catch a break.
Finally finally finally some original ideas from creative team!!! Well done, this is the way, it will cost a lot obviously but at least you can see the effort behind to create this
Are these a part of battlepass or separate purchase ?
my dream theme at any game
Holy fack this looks insane 😱😂😂😂😂❤️‍🔥
"The old dog" have a good taste for game I guess
Brim cheater
yo
OMG
Papi rito tau abis lebaran
Как же разрабы байтят скинами на персонажей просто
Insta buying this bundle
Oooooo brim is like dad to all of the team love it
those animations are just sick
Can't afford it. Simple as that. Prices are really out of hands, literally.
This is the best so far
The finishers are so cool !
time to preper my wallet to death (again).
Why the player in the trailers always got aimbot
Pleeeease make a series or a movie for Valorant😭😭😭😭😭

😂😂😂 он в конце продул картридж... Жиза

Of course we cant have trailer without cypher dying
Very cool idea!!! Especialy those nice finishers and the reload animation at the end 👍
reusing old animations valorant get new material thumbs down
Anyone else notice the 2 new names in the scoreboard at 2:27 ??? who could they be, the new agents ?
naahhh that transition at 2:36 was really cool
i want this so bad
zed 2.0
Who is Pala and Marc??

Please don't be too expensive 😢
disaster
deserves the raise.
Lpre wise gekko played valorant.
papa brim
2:11 I love how Gekko is using the OG Konami cheatcode to turn the Ghost up, really cool attention to details
The dream of fnf players
Офигенно 🎮
The moment gekko gets released they put him in every cinematic
The blowing part made me smile
I wish i didn't bought oni fr
i just realized... since valorant is set in the future... that  we are brim's age group.
poggers
Nice
Whats with omen and sage....riot cooking up ideas.....(Sova shippers looking at suspiciously)😂😂😂
Of course the white guy makes the brown guy do the chores :)
Cool trailer, mid bundle
Omggg i love this so muchhh
poor cypher
The sfx pls
Pala? Marc? Hmm.
Я как фанат Val or ant очень рад что разработчики сделали такую пасхалку Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start.     P.s. Извените что пишу на этом языке, просто он более распространённый из тех какие я знаю.
So good but to bad i dont have money

Whaha) Cyphers dance power is so funny)) But why low fps in video?)

Somehow its ugly and still absolutly setusfiing.

Seeing that every variant has their own unique inspect animations and finishers, this will be a very expensive bundle, no doubt.
the only one time im not mad at cypher's fdeath like look at his moves hahaahah
The. Blowing of the cartridge!!!! Yes!!
your player support is sooo bad pls do something.

im sorry but brimstone x gekko.
I want this. I'm poor, but I still want it.
finisher and melee is the only good things
Shut up and take mah money
0:50 I got triggered by that cartridge going in crooked.
PALA & MARC?
It's Allready S Tier 🔥🔥🙌🙌
This is the first time riot doing something good
HYPEE
who is pala and marc ?????!!!!!! in the scoreboard??????NEW AGENTS NAME??
2:47 Please, be real... Please, be real... Please, be real...
They put Kobeni ddr as a finisher
Family computer, Street Fighters, konami command... Love to see some kind of japanese vibes!
Riot, just hold on to my card until further notice.
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
IM IN LOVE WITH THE DDR VARIANT THE PHANTOM IS A NEED
time to take out a small loan
This is why I love Valorant more than csgo
Bankruptcy time 😨 😭

0:51 my mind went to another place when that thing popped up at the bottom right
Cypher died again😭😭😭
i love games
these are horrendous lmao
i need this full soundtrack 🔥🔥
omg
poor cypher.. again
Bro brim pleying on n64
SO COOL!
And that's how you respect the OGs
Def gonna buy the OP
I said "no way" like 10 times while watching this. Coming from a kid who is old enough to remember going to the arcade.
Brim back in the day was cracked on the console
Who's Pala and Marc? Maybe new champions? 🤔
The reference at the end 😬
PALA AND MARC???
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yoooo Brim, gamer🤗😄
brim is cheater
No wonder this bundle cost over 10k vp bruh Too good
Ngl i wasn't expecting all of this.
1:51 they did him extra dirty bro 💀
The best bundle in the game by far
Imm gonna be broke
Can't wait to pick it up from my opponent since I'm to broke to get it
Valorant never disappoints ngl
Sooo uh kayo was playing this console too
i love itttttt
New cover featuring Sage and Omen so cute😭😭😭
when brim said "pass the sticks"... brimmy was goated on the sticks back in the day.
retro retro  wooooooo
Finally another bundle with Good inspection animations
This is the best thing I’ve seen! So Clean❤
this is so cool especially the end
Hm sadly the bundel costs more than 10 000 vp
nice reference at the end
my mouth  is still opened😯
different variations different melee?
And this cost more than 100$… bro plz
The Dance Dance finisher is actually really good. Price so far though, a bit too much unfortunately.
These are so good. man why am i broke
1:49 cypher dab
This is what happens when brim ignores his beard papi 😂😂
ayo cypher plays ddr 🤣🤣
rip fps
Gun sounds like megaman sounds in the NES games. So fricking cool.
YOOO
(2:47) ~SUS~
why my account was banned for 1 year ( for nothing )
i love that they bring arcade from league of legends to valorant ! so hyped
💸💸💸💸
2:36 sick transition
If valorant is near future and its the same world as ours it is entirely possible Brimstone is a millenial or a zoomer, I like the idea and my personal head canon that brimstone is just an aged zoomer who purposely pretends to be the old man archetype who doesnt know anything about tech and cant text because he just finds it funny and its the ultimate inside joke between him and himself
All my childhood sounds and and feels put into one bundle, im absolutely amazed my riots effort in this, surely the best bundle to exist yet!
I’m going to go broke playing this game 😭
only costs 10000 vp yea no worries ill def get it
when its gonna be released?
GET MY MONEY !
Best bundle yet
Honestly missed opportunity to not add custom sounds.
if you guys see at 2:27 you guys see there's 4th pala and 5th marc so my theory is this is two new agent its just my theory not 100% true but if is it true im about to get very excited for this new agent
So.... Who's Pala and Marc?
Pala or karc maybe no 8 u know we didint get 8
Nice 💓
HOW MUCH HARD WORK WAS OUR LIL BRO DOING THERE 🥺🥺🥺
there are three different variants   knock out : 1:01 knock out finisher : 1:20  dance fever :  1:24 dance fever finisher : 1:48  bazooka badger : 1:53  bazooka badger finisher : 2:15
HOWMUCH ?
i love you valorant
Please give it to me 😢
Bro that voice from the Logic album makes me chiiiiiii'lllll
Mind = Blown
this is gotta be the best bundle ever I never ever got so surprised and amazed by a bundle
first time see cypher dance :)))
oh cmon! just when I'm broke af...
My Husband Gekko 🥰
eu amo essas cinematic surpresa que o valorant faz
Oh my god!🎉
atleast cypher died with some swag
wtf how many finishers does this thing have
Wowowowowoowowowow
it’s hurts to say i have to drop another $100 on this 😅
Not cypher again
Who are Pala and Marc ? In the video game score ranking on #4 and #5 anbody noticed. I think Valorant has just teased 2 upcoming agents.
everytime best  no cap
Real question: how much ? 🥺
Good thing my tax return came in 3 days ago.
Now that's a refresher!
Imagine if we could play it while on Y
Wingman being helpful 😢❤️❤️❤️
in Game Gaming console
Might be better than reaver
valorant developers are unique species. they need to be preserved at any cost
Interesting. Logging back in asap
Beautifulll❤
wow so cool
THAT WAS LITTT
Oh, my dear cypher die again
This is great
valorant just sneak halo knife in
glad i skipped on black market for this one
That's why i love valorant ❤❤
Cypher my men
Agents Pala and Marc?
I don't know why I am so touched with this! It's so thoughtful I cried! 😭 it also goes to show how old the developers were 😅 this throws me back to childhood blowing into the cartridge and all
Man this whole cinematic and the OG bgm at the end made me tear up.
I actually like the concept of this. Like the finishing animation and the interact animation. It's just so sick!
Imagine seeing street fighter in the middle of vct lol..
Somewhat mix of Zedd and Radianite Crisis😮❤❤ bruhhh so awesome
Ru?
This is so goofy  I love it!!
DID I JUST SEE A SHORYUKEN AS A FINISHER. This is a cop.
Wtf in the world was thatttt🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
That's so cool
Daam the finisher
I am so excited
Sheeesh 🔥🔥🔥
OKAY THE FINISHERS ARE HYPE
Wow
the bg music
play old games in the new game
They are soo beautiful
That transition at 2:36 tho
that so kekw fr fr brim play dingdong
I’m honestly super surprised so many people like this!! I don’t like this bundle at all. It’s been a long time since a legit good bundle has beem released! I think they are running out of ideas
DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION
AHAHAHA love the last blowing the magazine to reload..... Brings back memories 😂🤣
Shut up and take my money
So cool
Take my money
wow good brim you like a modern boomer  like my father before I kids
that is so unnecessarily flashy and distracting, I want 10.
Can you all post the music? It’s amazing.
Look at wingman 2:28 lol
Brim turned on cheats 😭
Sad news: Cypher died again Good news: he got the moves
VANDAL???😢
Pala and marc??
Double finisher??
That tekken finish is the best
Gonna buy atleast one thing from this bundle.
Was meh until I saw the Finisher AND Purple variant 😍
mind blownnnnnnn ....... no wordss for meee.....
Cowboy bebop ahh voice actor
I love this new bundle!!!!!
instant cop! would surely buy it <3
Also, the wingman hiding when brim gets back is so hilarious
Of course.. A cypher should have die… Hate you riot
Points will be 9100 or 11000
2 new agents, PALA and MARC teased
Can't wait to pick up from the ground
You guys really hate Cypher. He died like 4 times. Let my boy live ):

8 Bit Valorant!
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
El cuchillo es lo único feo
Awesome 😍😍😍
NO CYPHER
Riot is the GOAT
Btw in the score board tweet it says that kay/o has the highscore and you watch this and brim has the highscore. just an fyi
Omg ❤❤❤❤
The fact that Wingman isn't a plush yet disgusts me lmao.     SERIOUSLY I NEED IT
bundle dị vl :))
no kill banner?
I need a separate animation video just for wingman
When is Valorant mobile coming out 😳😳
Bru kinda nostalgic
So theres Only three Colourways
bro there goes 70$ of my hard earned cash. this stuff is to good not to get!
I've mostly seen positive feedback but anyone else think this bundle looks hot garbage? Good concept tho
"are u winning son?"
Ipl buy it
Shut up and take my money!

in love with this animation
Brimmy look soo chill
As a rythym player i really want that Dance fever variant😭
2:48 used to this alot when i was a kid 😂😂😂 dang I feel old
The variants are actually different
Damm that is actual banger bro
so cool
This gonna sell like hot cakes!
Okay these are badass, who wants to lend me $100 for em?
My focus on wingman, how cute there. Can i have wingman ????
i can now play mania while screaming at my sage to heal me
Who is Marc and Pala?
modern games giving old games vibes. nice.
진짜 틀립선 자극하게 만들긴했네 ㅋㅋ
this is crazyyyyyyyyyyy
this is so sick and omg the finishers are crazy cool
But how crazy is the brims high score
Who is PALA qnd MARC on the hall of fame? Next agents? Brimstone lore? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
On the scoreboard, you can see the names Marc and Pala. I think they're the new agents this year 😳
1:47 At least Cypher dies in a cool way :D
idk if anyone mentioned this before but I think Pala and Marc was brimstone friend(new agent?)
ngl this hella mid
Brims the GOAT
this bundle so cool
2:23 Pala and Mark? hmmm...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wow that was amazing Riot. The finishers are cool
this gotta be the best bundle so far. just pure perfection
This has to be the finest work of Riot so far.
Nostalgia.
Why you bully Cypher 😢
Me who's a semi pro osu mania player: 💳
Every single variant has a differer finisher amazing
Now the corpses will dance😂🤣
Brimstone the real G
сайфер после смерти хотя бы танцует >.(
wait its 30fps video ?
who is Pala and Marc tho
Whoever came up with this needs to be promoted ASAP. I will boycott until this man gets a raise and a promotion
Yes!
Wagman
Is that a different brim voice actor?
Cypher getting killed again...
The blowing part at the end lol. Extra detail only people with the old consoles understand
Different color different finisher
As an osu player this might be my favorite idea for a pack
Captain going crazy with his finishing KO
My wallet will be suffering but it’s worth it:)
This brings back old memories of 90s kids
my wallet feeling empty already... :(
Best finisher of all time. Hit like if you agree
cypher is so optimistic that he still even dance when he's dead
GOTTA LOVE THE REF
Time for me to spend my life savings
Ohhh the trailer soundtrack <3 <3
racist brimstone, making illegals clean his basement
valorant gameboy edition
pinter aja lu kita lagi THRan
Take my money right now
League is so dead bro 😂
one wtwo buckle me shoe three four buchle some more five six nike kicks
Now THAT is something I can get behind, whoo weee.
AMAZING
No vandal - not even thinking about buying
Kayo got outfragged by gekko and brim lmao
We need more passionate developers like this
Wingman pushed the couch by himself???
Brim is cheater.??
Only 3 variants?
Not good
I love everything Gekko has become My favorite agent along with Yoru also Wingman is really Big 😂 💕 the new set is amazing probably getting it.
Come to think of it, who are Pala and Marc in the Scoreboard... Hmmm Sus
No way
i love that fact that when brim catches him he's scared but then brim smiles like a dad that caught his son playing his retro games from when he was kid. Honestly really sweet and funny and reminds me of my dad when he showed super mario when i was a kid
Now coming to you for the low low price of 100 USD :') RIP my wallet when this comes out
The tune Is so calming and Old school 😍 😍
Looks like a Nintendo x Valorant collaboration. It's awesome.
Love how riot banned me permanently for having an Arab name !
I really wish the knives had the finishers
OST, PLEASE!!! 🙏🙏🙏
1:49 Cypher dying but with style from the dance finisher (and he dabs too)
What was that reload
JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Why teabag when you have such a BM finisher😂
Beautiful
This video reminded me of the "Art of reloading" video 🥰
POV: you are in clutch situation and you do this 2:47
lol nice reload
Take my money
I want this music, its so lit! Anyone know where I can find it
YEA NO SHI IM BUYING THIS

Marvel: Rocket Raccoon Riot: Bazooka Badger 😂
Take my money.
Who is Pala and Marc?
I hope it is not too much
I AM GOING BROKE ..AGAIN
I really really wanna buy this, it is so different and creative
I am so buying this
1:46 cypher dies again
"what was it again? up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start." *cheat activated*
0:43 "Hello Riot HQ? We have found out you have shown 1 second of n64 controller in your recent cinematic, we are ceasing all of your assets ad you will have to pay 99% of your income to us for the rest of your life,  Yours sincerely, Nintendo"
❤
Take my money
Seeing Brim with a high score in an arcade game: definitely a gamer at heart Brim: *cites the majestic combination  Me: nevermind
Old is Gold..
Yikes
Gekko should have borrowed Neon’s walis tambo
No one is asking who pala or marc are?
RHYTHMG AMES
I can hear my wallet screaming
welp time to get into valorant again
Finna bean some1 with the funny jig gun oml
nah this bundle disrespectful 😂

From a Gen X gamer, I LOVE IT! Thank you for this!
.V Dam That's SICK. Impresive ❤❤❤
Another ded cypher 😭😭
wait this isnt garbage like the reverie or altitude (op is clean asf)
wingman so cute
So brim, finally giving gekko more space by making him clean up the space. Nice.
Ded cypher
Now we need a separate omen and sage cinematic
Ah. There goes cypher again :(
Cypher dancing got me so bad
I thought new mode was coming
when trailer start with c men
a operator recarregando 😳😳
Alright… take my money
Riot needs to stop pumping out skinlines this sick, I have no money to get them with 😭😭
Yo the songs is kinda 🔥 ngl
Different finishers for different variants?!?!
Barbie fans the wait is over xD
Who is Pala? Who is Marc?
shesh
Amazing
Nah Man Not the Retro Card .My wallet ain't ready for it
dancing cypher is my nightmare
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO IM BROKE AND I WANT THIS
YOO UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT

AINT NO WAY CYPHER IUST DABED AT 1:49 💀
コレデザイン頭いいなマジで
Broomstone
reminds me of Friday Night Funkin game
instant buy
Kay/o is a war machine, why he was playing this game?
The finishers are so good, and music is fire as always
proud day to be a brim main
#4 PALA 👀 #5 MARC 👀
idk why i thought this was a game mode😭
the last scene bring backs memories
哭啊，原本收手不課了，但這次太香了
K.O Finisher would be better.
I love seeing Brim being a dad.
Time to sell my kidneys I guess
THE FINISHERS AN ABSOLUTE WIN
geckko my sweetirpatootier
so cool
There are 3 finishers wtf
This is sick
Absolute W
Sh** up and take my money 💸💸💸💸💸💸
Can’t wait to pick them off the ground 🙂🥲🥲
THATS SO GOOD IM BUYING THE FULL BUNDLE FOR LIKE 3 GIFT CARDS
Love how they showed Kayo on having a score. Adds depth in the story since they were old companions. I wonder who was Pala and Marc
Um... LETSSS F"IN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wingman is the best thing that ever happened to Valorant
As always, nailed it riot!
Finally
I love the sfx, the animation is great, but the weapon design is so "voluptuous" its kinda weird.
Sage look so ⚡⚡
Love it
no
😮
PALA the new agent
!!! niceee
jaw dropped! this looks unreal i cant wait for this
From the worst set, to the best set!
I'm in love.
wingman's snore bubble at 0:34 is such a cute touch
How much will this bundle be?
blowing in the cartridge is 100 legit 😂👏😘
Copping this foe sho
Riot buddy when
Wow🎉
Here we go another best collection that i cont afford 🙃
Great, my savings are gone again..
For a small animation company riot does make some decent games.
brim knows the cheats for GTA
Cypher got no  chills
what a great trailer. Helps that I love Brim
Wtf
Altitude set was a ruse
you should def give me the bundle MyUserIsCloak
these go incredibly hard
Wow
I didnt even know i needed these in my life
This is so good,and completely unique finisher for every colour is amazing
I can't buy in India becoz no UPI😢
Riot dev so amazing
That reload is amazing
MOM? MOMMMMMMM WHERE DID YOU PUT UR CREDIT CARD?
Now this bundle is gonna sell bigtime. Finishers are sick!
That looks sick wow
so cool
Love it
yoooooooooooooh that It's so cool mannnnnnnnnnnnnn
Riot is back at taking my life savings.
Now they are gonna make some money
Valorant HQ is sexist. Neon got a ready to use room.
So we have Street Fighter, Friday Night Funken and halo
STOP WITH CYPHER PLEASE
So amazingg!!
The reload animation is so crazy!
Who is Pala and Marc? 2:27
Coollll
so wonderful
Mind-blowing developer 😎
SO FRIGGIN COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Brim went : Are u winnin' son ?
Now i have a response when my teammates will ask why you reloading after firing 1 bullet
I don't have money
i wish i could buy it but i have no money
its good, i need vandal variant
broooo noo wayyy
holy balls
What Riot did again to poor Cypher is unjustified but  funny too.
another time cypher got killed
might be as expensive as the spectrum line when it comes out
Sheeshh
Cool! Can't wait to pick it on the groud 🔥🔥🔥
GOOFYY AHH
Gonna be the best selling bundle ever
THEY FINALLY ADDED GLOVES LETS GOOO
i feel bad for gecko lol
i need this
TAKE MY MONEY
Well... time to pick up a few more shifts.
0:51 is this wingman's hand?
Dope
nice
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO BRING BIND BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that's the bundel I was waiting for love it 🥰😍❤️
i need the rhythm one
these are so cool might just have to steal my moms credit card
DIFFERENT FINISHERS FOR DIFFERENT VARIATIONS IS SO DOPE
The K.O finish was such a good finisher
Now I can't wait to see Fist fight
That never-dying Contra cheat's the best part.
if only it was a vandal
Sage is coming on the covers a bit more now. with different clothing
2:27 2 Agents leak!
who is pala and marc ? 2:28
That's sooo well made!!!!
guys.. at least Cypher got to hit some sick moves in this trailer.. not a total loss
i want it, but i dont have money :)
HOLY
Well maybe upcoming agent is marc and pala... Watch the score list 👀 New suspense huh?
Ok maybe it's time to buy a valorant bundle 😅
THE FINISHERS ARE AMAZING ALSO THE “Y” ANIMATIONSSSS 💯💯😭
2:27 who is pala and marc? new agent?
It could be an 3rd Ultra Edition after Elderflame and Protocol  Because of it's unique kill and inspect animation  Pretty cool
I only have one thing to say.......BRIM GAMING?!?!?!?!
PLEASE UPLOAD THE MUSIC, IT'S SO GOOD
Cypher death at 1:47
These bring back my childhood life. Shut up and take my money riot.
God I love going over all the little details, references and inside jokes they leave for everyone.  As usual cypher dies and is forced to dab and repent his sin of having lived. Definitely not megaman racoon was cute and I love that were finally getting a little more insight on brimstone. Beard papi really does have dad energy. ❤️
2:28 pala and marc ?
Make the replay system
Shut up and take my money Riot
ㅇㄴ 이번 신스킨 너무 이뻐버리는데... 으아앙ㄱ
Poor cypher
Im poor right now but i dont care, im buying it
Anyone else think that the first pose of the finisher for the dance one looks a little bizarre? It looks so familiar
Brim being a father is so wholesome
You had be blown up this is amazing
im bussing
in the future, will we have loot box ?
Pala and Marc, remember those names folks.
just get us music with it and s tier bundle
bro brim has a cheat XD "up up down down left right left right BA Start hehe"
Best thing is the finisher and Op and Ghost sound !
PARABENS ROIT AGORA PEGUE TODO MWU DINHEIRO E COMA MEU KUU
Bye bye wallet
All the 80s and 90s kids going crazy over this bundle
why is  valorant turning into a childrens game
WTFFFF I NEED THIS
This gotta be insanely expensive
Its a SEGA !!!!!
is nobody going to talk about how good the transition was at 2:36?
FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ngl this is actually so sick
bro they still killin cypher
what must be said has already been said in the comments
10K VALORANT points
Eid-ul-fitr Mubarak to all❤✨🫂
2:30 hahahah Wingman saw brim and hide that was fun
I've spent most of my childhood playin those retro games, Im filled with nostalgia
Cypher die in a swagg way
time to wavedash into triple EWGF to Operator in valorant. may even launch some fireballs along the way
Elegant piece of work
2:27 new 2 agents teaser :0
i see 2 new character haha
bro what :O
Eid Mubarik guys
I'm buying this just for the finishers
gg guys
This bouta cost half my bank account
This is probably gonna cost a lot 😂
At this point, I’ll give u the raise!!
Add that cypher death to the kill count
SO COOL!!!!
So that’s why it costs 100 dollars
refreshing the old memories
Yesss I’m buying this
Sheeeeesh
Cypher dabbing😂
The last part was too cute. I loved the Father and son moment
this didn't have to go so hard, hyped to see the finishers in game!!
ya make the latino do the cleaning
이아
can’t wait for my fps to drop with that finisher 🔥
if enemy don't kill me and makes me dance then i ain't playing.
Omen rework when???
Brim is technically a Gen Z Kid, due to Val being on near future, Brim could've been born in 2020/2019
At the hall of fame there are KAYO PALA and MARC. Wait- does that mean KAYO is the KAY/O from the alpha earth universe or idk it's confusing. For PALA and MARC maybe they were brim's buddies or partners during his time back when he used to work full time with kingdom (we might see them as a new agent maybe down the line) or just an easter egg.
They are working on gamer's EMOTIONS!!!!!! Dope
brimstone uses cheats? D: this is unacceptable. brimstone gonna catch a ban from riot soon
Both Neon and Gekko clean there room Neon clean her room so fast GEKKO 😆😆😆😆
oh no expensive skins...I will hope to be able to buy it
That part where cypher dyes is so good 😅
Wow.
Making your opponent dance is the most bm finisher😂
These look like a combo of rgx ion gravneuro and magepunk all at once I love the finishers Especially the ddr one
I can hear millions of wallets crying out😂
Sick, I think it might have something to do with Valorant being released on Xbox!
RIP my fps.....
street fighter ryu ❤
Everyone is praising valorant's new skinlines yet they didn't even notice how wholesome the ending of the video was.
My 90s soul is sooo hyped for this bundle 😍
Jesus the phantom looks terrible
Cypher moves on fire 🔥 after every cinematic we finally got cypher dancin
Brim using cheat to hight score lol but riot dont ban him :))))
looks so bad lol
And here I go losing money again
That last scene made this video even better than it already was. goodness. I love Riot Games.
and this cost 10k
Bro this is so cool...Brim gives old school dad vibes, das sweet...Those arcade cables are the same as old tv cables we had back in the early 2000s, such a good reminiscence, I love it...Each variant has its own unique finisher, das cool...At the end, I love the Sage Omen wallpaper, dude this is so exciting
Awesome VFX and details plus the finisher changes with variants, but  the weapons models looks a bit off to be honest.
Loving the dynamic
I hop😢 this is the battle pass
I love this bundle already
Everyone appreciates brimstone lore
New agents name MARC and PALA 🎉
1st Brim 2nd Gekko 3rd Kayo 4th Pala 5th Marc   Who Pala And Marc?? she a New Agent On this Year???
this is fkng dope love it♥️♥️
Brimstone try to remember his cheat command 😂 that's why hes the top score.
up up down down left right left roght B A
AYYYY... You had the chance to use the song PLAY by Tokyo Machineeeee
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
op
Who is PALA
KRLH MENOR, ISSO TA FODA PA KARALHO
MY MONEY!!!
ENERGY SWORD, LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Did cypher just dance ?
it feels weird to see brimstone be taller than gekko, guess i got too used to every agent being the same size in game for the sake of consistency
cool expensive
Nostalgia ❤❤
2:48 just did it for me
I cannot wait to spend $120 on this
yo these are sick jeeeeeeeeez
they did ma boi cypher dirty again
this is going to be one of the most expensive bundles i can feel it
Okay, this is cool
No way, this is awesome!!!  I love it!! 🔥
haha, wallet goes brrrrrrr
cypher
What is pala and marc in score board? New agents?
To see millennials like Brimstone becoming "boomers" is insane.
It's honestly disgusting valorant gets this for a single skinline and league gets the dogtier cinematic for all of s13 and that's it.
Can't wait to pick this up from the enemy team
So that's why brim have the higest score Upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbastart
wingman is adorable in this
Cool
Nobody gonna talk about brim's score ?
pala ? marc ?? next agent ?? 🤔
OH IM DONE HE BLEW THE CARTRIDGE. LMFAO
Brim is cheating btw =)))
who are Marc and Pala tho?
wait, who is PALA and MARC in positon 4 & 5?
How much
dont riot tired of this type od knifes?
Dame brim… alright!
My fps.................
Give these graphic designers for these cinematics a pay raise, top tier animations...
Bare minimum skinlines
also guns have the old design language , the shape of old guns but they outdone themselves with the killing animation , putting nostalgic things in every aspect  i laugh and remembered old memoris!
the finishers tho
bast
this bundle insanly cool
who are pala and marc??
Wait hold up, yall saw the end with that League of Legends girl? Sorry I don't play LOL. I just know her from Arcane. Is she a new agent?
2:56 its new agent ? a girl ?
Brim just pulls out Cheatcodes just to beat Gekko 💀
Not another phantom bundle
Wait, who is Pala and Marc ? Next agents?
Sick song❤
VALORANT IS COOKING
rare valorant w
The fact that brim said "up up down down left right left right b a start" gave me nostalgic memories.
lovely cypher dance❤
Goosshh valorant is sumthin
its sick but the bundle is over 10,000 😭😭😭
Cypher dancing💀
Anyone saw pala and Marc? Who that?
Ah… Valorant players appreciate this as long as you can. I remenber when Riot put this kind of effort in LoL players.
Best thing ever❤
Up up down down B A Start.  Hahahha i love it.

brim gotta be the best player ever
poor cypher 1:47
Xtrawdktra no tray I didn’t know you made his weapons play my prayers, weapons OK

Wingman tryna hide from brim I love it

1:46 cypher 😭😭
Animations are cool and all but looks wise its the most mid looking bundle I've ever seen
blowing out the dust, gives me flashbacks
Is this the next season pass
DEYMMN BOII
this is too good
cypher dancing is dam cool tbh
$100 price tag kinda makes sense now lol
the ddr finisher could've said "FC!" after the animation
Anana sikim, wieso so viel Geld ey?
Woah 😳
Always happy to see a animation company help make games
1:56 this knife  is literally from Halo game
brimstone is everyone's dream father

Up up down down left right left right B A select start

OMG WOAHH!!!!!!              hard pass
Yawa gasto na pud 😭😭
these finishers are everything
tbh the fumble is kinda there but we’ll have to see
MONEYYYY NNNOOIKIOIIII
This is easily gonna be 150,000 VP
Price will be ?
It was fun and games until they charge you 10.000 VP for it
thats cool
WHOS PALA AND MARC?
the second variant finisher will potentially be the bm in VCT
Love seeing more of Gekko
Reminiscing the late 80's to 90's arcade, gaming & console era 💙
ayoo what was that magazine!!
BRO THEY LET CYCPHER DAB IN HIS GRAVE
yay time to spend more money
Até q enfim um pacote q realmente seja bom

I NEED the DDR one in my life.
Me：No Riot you can’t just take my money out of my wallet like that Riot: Yus

That Op gonna work now. My mans blew on the cart.
Cant wait to have to sell a kidney!!!
Brimstone mainimi görmek harika!

graphic designers for riot also have a degree is finding ways to take our money 😭
A dancing and uppercut finisher...what has this game become.lol😂
Who's the 4th and 5th... Future agents? Or Real names of agents that I forgot...

This has to be the best skinline..

Hollyy ssshh, this is soo coooll
WHERES THE FULL SOUNDTRACK. 😐
1:20 - that King of Fighters/Street Fighter finisher right there
YOOOO
yeee
Different finishers for each color variant for 10000 VP? Hmmmmm....
That smell... mmm... nostalgia.
Much better than the night market
The retro vibe! and Brim just being awesome!
Thoda give away hojata toh........😅
Yapıyorsun bu işi riot
an american making a mexican clean coinscidence i think NOT
@VALORANT instead of making trailers you should make shows!
Ini bagus bangeeeeeeet
Sickkkk
It's great to see Cypher not just dead but also dancing. 😂
Ayo, are we gonna ignore daddy brims booty? 😳
The detail is insane. The blowing in the cartridge at the end put a big smile on my face
TAKE MY MONEY 💵
Time to drop $100
No Stinger again, 0/10.
Is the room still big tho?
Different finisher for every variant?
So cool
Funny enough Kayo play this game before and 2 new people called pala and marc, marco polo? Idk
Primer set bueno que sacan en mucho tiempo
Report brim 😆
Brim is now a certified mania player.
This would be so dope if you are able to randomize your gun variant per round
tf.
Finishers are top tier
the next new champion's name PALA&MARC.
Who's pala and marc?
Daddy brimmmmmmmm
nunca comento un video, pero esto esta BRUTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL! LETS GOOO!!!!
another bundle to pick up on my teammate's corpse
nice
i wish i have money to buy this
Please riot, this bundle is so good, I want you to increase the price to 21000vp so I can show my full support
No wonder it costs more than 10,000 vp the team really put lots of effort to this!
At least cypher died in a cool way lol
Ah yes Cypher dying "again" but with style
Instead of DedCypher, we got DabCypher.
why is brim so zesty in this trailer?
who are pala and marc? is the real question.
Who are Pala and Marc?
My pockets physically hurt rn
I love the retro feel to it and TETRIS yes. I like how brim is like his dad/brother. Their dynamic is sweet plus the beats I LOVE IT YESSIRRRRR
Woow, i love it ❤
cool trailer
just for this, im gonna go ruin someones ranked game lol
Could the chick in the end by a new agent?
Ray gun from cod
take my money pls😅
Bao nhiêu tiền để t còn mua
Looks like Street Fighter XD
I love brimstone man
I just lost money on Oni bundle, and now Valorant is demonizing me yet again
hour early!
YOOOO
Holy smokes!!! They really added gloves!!
i thought the cypher bullying was over...
Definitely copping. The ddr phantom is a must have
THIS IS SO GOOOOD
Only good ones are the finisher and 3rd knife
only a certain group will understand the last part. *blows into cassette*
Does it work after picking the gun from the ground
cant wait to pick these guns up :)
reason why bimstone became leader in the team
is it possible that you can feel your wallet being broke 😭 i want it so bad
Ok at first without the look I was like “more than 10k vp, that outrageous.”, but after see the amount of thing that are in this with each variant having its own custom kill animation I think it is definitely worth that price.
Fire
yay :3
ЭТО. ПРОСТО. ВОСХИТИТЕЛЬНО!!!
When will upi payment will come in india
😮 who's Pala and marc
I refuse to believe that this mobile game is that popular.
Cypher got killed again- but- He Dance HAHAHA
ARE YA WINNIN SON
Dang the first bundle I'll buy.
so good
this is so wild bro so cool
just remembered one show lol
THE POWER GLOVE
Oe qué buen pack regalelon 😅

왐마 이쁘네 사야나 말아야나 ㅠㅠ
Cs2 is way better
lmao honestly
I NEED MONEY HELP HELP HELP I WANNA BUY HELP HELP HELP
Super cooll🎉🎉❤❤
Oo
well i guess i wont need to eat for 2 weeks
Ah so thats what the night market is for
Pala? Marc? 🤔
BRUUUUH this is actually the sickest bundle and its not even close
They got rocket racoon from guardians of the galaxy
와 미쳤다 이번신스킨 ㄷㄷ
Different kill effects for different variants? Loving what Riot is coming up with.
2:27 great Easter egg tho. 5th place name marc must've been omen, cause in the theory, Omen has a alias name Marcus, this must be him. Also nice Kayo also play this things...
Fps drop
WHOS PALA AND MARC (the names on the high score)
At the end 2:26 you see 4th and 5th place.. who are PALA and MARC?
W
🔥🔥
Pala?! Marc?!
beautiful design trapped on a horrible claw model
I LOVE THE DESIGNS SO MUCH 👀👌❤️🔥🔥🔥
Take my money - these are INSANEEEEEEE!
1:50 Cypher died again But it's cool, I forgive them
I love val videos more than the game at this point. lmao
CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EU QUERO EU QUERO
Brim using classic God Mode cheats😂🔥
W
so fire
rip my bank after this
Gekko a true gamer 2nd on his first try by a long shot
gekko so fine bruh, he look like me fr
okay this is kind of sick
Is this me or every innocent and wholesome radiant that join Valorant really have to tidy their Room? Man i love this, Hope this will be recurring theme from now on X3
Another punch dagger. The ghost is sick though
YOOOOOOOOOOO
gun model is mid and kill sounds are mid
price??
Dont make this overprices like spectrum dude
Up up down down left right left right b a start
yeah, the best one YET
fire
street fighter, any dance arcade, and mega man reference
💀
Take my money ! Again !
I love the blue variant
Shame it's a Phantom and not Vandal :(
Imma buy the phantom not gonna lie how much is it? i got 1.4k vp
what is that outfit of sage at the end?
ngl i was mainly here for brimstone
Cypher dance :v, poor him, revenge
u guys did AMAZING keep up the work guys<3
Wait  a min is that a Street fighter reference?
wingman hiding was the cherry on the cake
god this is actually super sick
THE BEST!!!
riot, eu estou esxcitado
YOOOO inspect and finisher Also Brim score😮
sniffing the cartridges at at the end LOL the nostalgia
That contra cheat is on fire!
Шедеврально
its awesome!
2:48 eu entendi a referencia kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
cant wait to dp some kids in valo
That Sage costume please. Release it riot!
Amazing concept, and great execution for the most part. I just feel like the guns themselves without the special effects look really off. Like the shape is very not nice to look at even with the gfx. Incredible animations and finishers. Just not sure how to feel about the guns themselves.
To think that Green Lantern knows his in n outs for Tekken
TAKE MY MONEY, TAKE MY MANEY NOW
Well guess I’ll be pulling out a loan
cypher back to being hated by riot
habis duit aku
That old dawg is a gamer dude. Sheeesh
i want to play val but its always give error van 1067, already did everything on internet but nothing happen
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk meteram um friday night funkin  na phantom
arcade bundle go brr
I was so happy when Brim said "up up down down left right left right B A Start"
cant wait to get this on the floor
The cyper dance is litt😂😂😂
:D
Valorant always knows how to bring the heat with these bundles
2:55 sage be lookin fine tho
i never bought a whole bundle in the game. but this time i think i will.
So Brim is a 90s kid?
CAN WAIT FOR IT BRO PLS THE PHANTOM IS 1.775 I WANT TO BUY IT IF THE PHANTOM 1.775
is this like the spectrum expensive cause this is the banger
unique animations on each variants? bro i hope they don't get burnt out too much, this is insane
the finishers are fire
Not Valorant making another goated Cinematic Just for an Bundle
by far one of the best bundles coming out in my opinion, fire.
If glictch pop and uranium had a baby
1:17 ik for a fact they didn't just put a sf3 3rd strike start up sound when you put a coin in the actual arcade
PBE WONT OPENNN VAL 46
Sick video game aesthetics, sick finishers, guns that I actually use  Yup, that's an ez cop
WAITING TO BUY IT ON THE VERY FIRST MOMENT
They even got Rocket Raccoon! Oh, sorry, I mean Bazooka Badger!
Talk about a gun game am I right?...ok I'mma go now
HERMOSO,papi
Pala and Marc, wonder if those are the upcomming agents ..
this is litt
I just realized, wingman is the only one out of the 4 of the buddys that actually move around on their own, like at all times. Thrash is probably too dangerous to keep out at all times but dizzy is probably fine to leave out and mosh is just a ball at this point. I'm guessing with how radients getting stronger as the story goes on, yoru and skye as proof, gekko's buddys are probably going to become insanely strong individually. Like mosh grows over time and eventually gets a body like wingman.
WHO IS PALA AND MARC???
The different finishers are 🔥🔥🔥
Ngl the animations and finishers carried this bundle , but the design is kinda mid
hahaha , the secret in most games , 2:40
This collection is hella cool. Especially the KO death animation
Here's $10 Now gimme bundle
BRIM PAPI

Woah
BRIM, ITS BA, NOT JUST A!
when i saw jett get demolished i was too sad😢😢 and i said why it's not cypher who got roughed up for once but when i watched more the video i said oh finally its your turn cypher 😂😂😂😂.

yoooo that ddr one is so cool instabuy you guys always make me go in dept every new bundle
2:47 why my op dont shot? (in fact, the only thing that worked was taking it out and putting it in, the fact of blowing on it caused it to be damaged in the long term)
the reload animation tho!!
a meu dinheirinho
goood
No Spectre :(
Who is Marc and Pala? 2:27
Wow
Bro this looks absolutely amazing, absolutely getting the phantom
Dont give me this!
the ghost look like remodoled infantry
New Agents names are 'Pala' and 'Marc'?
when you inspect they should have let you play tetris
Mid
Good Vid!
fr
150 dollar bundle XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
2:27 who is pala and marc hmmmm
I thought to myself “there’s no way he dies now. Gekko is just playing games, no way they can fit that into the story” then he died.
That reload animation!!! The finisher is sick too. Love the creativity
Welp, my money is gone
Brimstone is just like their father 😂
Can't wait
i know you guys prefer phantom over vandal but y no vandal???
I see why this bundle costs over 10000 VP 🥶🥶
THAT FINISHER
That Operator moment at the end reminded me so much of my childhood
I love you Steve Blum
The important question tho, what's the name of the music track in the first part of the video?
Woooooooaaaaahhh
Shut up and take my money.
So underrated wtf
Ok this is epic
YOOOOOOOO
Cypher death timestamp 1:47

Dabbing cypher

Nice dude
brimstone is a hacker
one of the trailers ever
W riot fr
ooo this is hot
i just noticed that brimstone is Zeb from star wars rebels
TOO GOOD😭‼️‼️
Im not sure if i like it or dislike it yet
Rhythm game players are now to be feared
Arcade bundle?
anjeng keren bat
0:50 dizzy looking sussy
This. Looks. Amazing. Also that brim part was hilarious lol
foda ta?
no me lo creooo4
look at what wingman is doing, so cute XD
Bro I can see west jett’s cop or drop. I already know its gonna be a drop
Up up down down left right left right B A start
Love that each color variant has its own unique finisher.
The finishers are badass
Wait. R E S? Like Rez? Jett Rebibe me.
so a glitchpop with radiant crisis 001 cool!
Cypher really got bullied with that finisher
wawawawawawawa
I don’t even want to know how much these would cost, not to mention upgrading
I WANT THE PHANTOM!!!!!
Glad to see they care more about their other games since they are completely ignoring all the bugs and trolls in Ranked on league of legends.....yup. thanks riot games for not caring to multitask.
Can’t wait to steal the gun from others
Wow 😮
I swear they use aimbot when they make the trailers
this is the bundle of all time
1:48 cypher still died again
I can’t wait to pick this up from the ground!
so this is their best set yet
Ohhhh
I love. How brim is like a father to gekko
2:27 who are pala and marc?

THERES GOTTA BE AN EASTER EGG IF U JUMP TWICE, CROUCH TWICE, MOVE LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, AIM AND SHOOT OR SMTH LIKE THIS
poverty glitchpop
Sage ♥
Lil bro lowkey was Pikachu because he never want to be inside the thing🤣
Welp.. my money will be gone soon
These have to be the best finishers in the game
Ahhh so that's why it's so expensive
Brim is the leader cause he was learning right combos while we were button smashing...
2:48 OMG the flashback of my childhood time just revived 😊
How do people play this?  It looks so goofy.
I want it soooo much
IT'S ACTUALLY CRACKED
OK Boomer
2:31 look at wingman
HOLD UP WHOSE THAT WOMAN
Who is Pala and marc
ngl kinda overrated
the way wingman ran to hide 🤣
This is actually good
heres my wallet
looks SICKKKK thats how u KNOW the things gonna be a hundred bucks!
THR langsung abis 😅
so like 4 different finishers? and 4 different inspects? jesus
ok i'll prepare $100 by then
Brimstone is cheating for sure !! Look at his scrore >.< !!!
Wait Pala? Marc?
Brimmy just cheating
Gayest game ever
OMG! Valorant has stepped up their game this time
so no one gonna talk about whos Pala and Marc?
Shooooot
omd sage fine
Kayo😢
moment of silence for the people who born in 2000
It's funny if you think about it, because cannonically brim is a zoomer and grew up with gameboys and DS so when gekko says how old is brim, he's probably never seen a gameboy or ds as this is way into the future.    Or an NES, but that would be before brims time if I remember correctly.
Oke this has to be the one where cypher's getting trolled hardddddd🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sickkkk
Blowing the game cartridge at the end is so fire. Might have to cop this one for nostalgic purposes.
Poor cypher
why yall keep makin me broke!
missed opportunity to add the NES zapper
RES me
yooo why this 10k+ vp 💀💀💀it hurts my wallet ☠
This is miles better than the airplane bs
These gotta be the best finishers in the game fr
😂cant wait to play SDO in valorant
so many memories
So THATS why it's $100
1:20 if only Jett blocked and parried those
Next level bm with that finisher.
Im sorry mom, but where's your credit card?
1:21 So satisfying to see Jett get beaten up again and again
Who's Pala and Marc?
It's funny because riot is making a fighting game too
YOOOO
I CANTT THIS IS TOO CUTEE IDDJIDHFJDH
🐙❤️
Those two give me a father-son like vibes, it’s adorable 🥰
So creative! Love it!
i was not expagting cyper to dab
Is That Rocket Racoon Or Sonic ?

CARA ... Que Foda!!! gostei muito do tema, e essas finalizações então!!
Im kinda like his pokiman

My brother in christ that's a Vintendo 64, I'm around the age of Gekko and I had one

This is actually a super cool concept, like a fist meele plus different effects for each variant, RIOT STOP TAKING MY MONEY 😭😭😭😭

Call of duty/CSGO : a soldier on the battlefield, be quick, be precise, and eliminate the opposition  Valorant : so we stuck a gameboy into a knife

They didn’t forget to kill cypher 🥲

😮
Only 1000€ for everthing.
Just about the coolest bundle yet
Perfect
I can't believe they somehow implemented the arcade skinline into Valorant.
Can't wait to fist people with the new knife :P
when you thought you can't humiliate cypher enough by being killed in trailers, and then you let him dance out of his will lol
that really cool 😎 ,LOVE IT 🔥
The finishers omg
I'm 96

"Hey Maaaaa. Can I borrow your credit card!" "I know I said last time was the last time but I really want it!"
Sheesh

Different finishers on every variant? Take my money!
The purple variant is HARD

W
NEED!
the fact that KAYO is 3rd place after gekko and brim in the game is even further proof that kayo is brim's dead friend (the one from the player cards and pictures in his office in the range).
until they release a cinematic of yoru I will not return to the game
trash bundle. L still gonna make millions on this rito :D
This gonna cost more than the Zedd x Spectrum bundle
The sound effects on this set man💯🔥 Nostalgic too
It’s good
PLEASE tell me the reload animation is the blowing of the cartridge. I'd LOSE IT!!!!

4 UNIQUE FINISHERS?!? THIS IS SUCH A COOL LINE!!!
I remember when I visited my grandmother in village, my grandmother said, Son one day some people will waste their time reading your comment 🤔
Very cool but no money xD
The finisher is actually so sick
blowing the cartridge is the ABSOLUTE CHERRY ON TOP FOR THIS BUNDLE! I love that even the thumbnail for the video is a homage to the old SNES cover art!
The question is  Who is PALA and MARC ?
nah.
this is just amazing
2:28 who's pala and Mark ??
what a coincidence. i have some money right HERE   Edit: IT'S OVER 10K VP
15 MINS AGOO
dude the blowing on the game cartridge if its the reload brings back memories. (ALSO A GOATED RELOAD)
Whoaw hold on… so three different finishers for three variants? Wow
Brim pro player look at the score board really scary asf
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
When Valorant meets Arcade skinline.
10,000 valorant points for the whole bundle 💀 riot keep going higher and higher
3 different finishers ? this ish is gonna be expensive asf lol
The wingman bhiding when brim came in was PERFECT
The reload on the OP tho😂
There goes my saving
Cant wait to grab these from the ground
after the negative view on blackmarket and they said that riot is uncreative, they dropped this lmao 🤣
blowing the cartridge was a nice touch
I NEED MONEY PLS
Bruh the sound design it's just phenomenal...
Love wingman

First time seeing Brimstone smiling this much is letting the kid clean the room 😂
So who are we gonna fire for this?
