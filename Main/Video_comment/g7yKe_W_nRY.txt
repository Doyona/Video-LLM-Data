Karma is a bitch honey lmao looks good on you 😂
Idk...Im just literally in love with Jeffree...
I love how he apologizes for literally making jokes back then, we all have our own opinions and its okay to like or dislike brands, honestly what an era miss those times but man it was messy girl..
❤❤❤❤❤
December 6, 2024
I love shane dawson and jeffree star duo together so much, they are so funny, entertaining. Wish they could do a reality show together
Kind of too late 2 has been passed but is it against the law of the USA to sell products of some company without them knowing about it? I don’t live in the USA so idk what the law says about it
This a long shot but can I purchase a conspiracy pallete from you. I wasn’t able to get it when it came out.
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
;o; wish i could grab this collab nowww
Jeffree - Finds his makeup at a "discount" store chain and buys it all Us Poor Bitches - Jeffree, NOOO!!!!!
I love you Jeffree❤️ love Mackenzie xox you are So Beautiful Inside out! I adore your Style    But OMG THIS OUTFIT / look in this video 😍🤪🥰❤️❤️. Stunning
I love that you admit and lean into it. Very top drawer of you!
Hey Jeffrey stars do you have a new I want to watch it
Makeup at NR is not like Marshall’s lol.  NR carries regular MAC, stilla, Bobbi brown, Lancôme, buxom, charlotte tilbury literally everything lol
I meant you didnt go not you did .Sorry for my txt mess.
Just have to say , you are a class -act; you go in that store acting stupid or with shade. Even bought your own makeup. ❤the ole lesbo.
Love it that you went into Nordstrom s for your own makeup.  That is a blast. You are too cool for school Ms. Jeffree.
Nothing is wrong with it being in a clearance store, it is more accessible to everyone no matter what there budget is.
Merch skit. Had customer at nordstrom paying for theyre stuff come over to make it look like he was with them buying theyre merch
is boom his like secretary person or something, he is handsome , love it!
There is a lot about Jeffrey that I dont like, but his business accumen has been and continues to be exceptionally good. He had little to no formal business training, no retail background, to my knowledge didnt have any experience in wharehousing or B to B  business...I do. Its NOT easy...cause if it was, a) you wouldnt see so many businesses fail, and b) everyone brother and their dog would be doing what he does. He figured out complex business strategies and has implemented them and weather the last 3 and a half years without going bankrupt when MILLIONS of small - mid size businesses didnt make it. Say what you will about his decisions and antics and how they effected others - his business acumen is stellar.
9:14 Roll the series! 😂
That means it didn’t sell out at other stores.
Ew! That wig is so dirty! lol. It looks like it was dyed by throwing some pink color on a puddle and dragging the brassy blonde through it. Zero idea where the pink should be and, did the crimp flop through the ditch as well? Or?
People don’t understand how business works
I saw your products in Vita store in Norway some years back.  Do not think it was last year. I remember it was when you mentioned selling your products illegally.  I never purchased something. Not checked if They sell anything from you anymore. Shane is shown when They speak via phone.
You did also say when you saw Anastasia makeup that brands send overstock to these companies
anybody that hates jeffery is lying he’s so amazing! ❤❤
so many products at mine still mirrors glosses palletes powders
Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack are DIFFERENT. Nordstrom is a little pricey and Nordstrom rack is like 70% off of a lot of stuff.
It makes it open to a whole new market of people. Affordable to them. You have a massive bag collection so you dont need plastic bags from the shop
Imagine shopping at goodwill and finding his makeup !!!  I actually found a couple Jeffree star mirrors at my goodwill. I had to buy one lol
I think it’s actually a great thing.  It could be getting your name out to people who might not have tried Jeffree Star cosmetics otherwise 🤷🏻‍♀️
Tj max is all my ex friends go to die was funny doe, joke is joke but it’s good to be able to apologize later for things that can hurt ppl.  Jeffree doesn’t fake apologize you can tell he grew as a person each year and really look back and think differently now.  He’s one of the most humble rich ppl .
We all make mistakes but most people never admit to it let alone try to fix it, Jeffree might had some pasts ( don’t we all ) but he always seem to humble up each year. He literally glows and grows.  It’s his happiness and him becoming a better human is so inspiring to see. I’m not his fan boy, I do own couple mannequins gloss but that’s about it but I do see him as humble human being.  And it’s ok , all makeup goto discount expect for Chanel , cuz let’s face it, can’t always selll it all before expiration and if its either throw away to keep value or let it go to ppl for lil cheaper why not .
Jeffree I love  uuuiu ❤️❤️❤️💕💕❤️💕💕
I love the changes Jeffree and Shane have made in their lives. They emanate happiness. Truly wishing all the happiness and love in the world for both of them.
Newer stuff of urs is at nodstrom rack 2
When you so poor that you even haven’t heard of this damn store
I'm not really 12 or funny... hi
What's up J* how are you I'm 12
I am literally in my house right now watching this video why I know I I am sick with COVID-19 20
It's kinda messed up to see your products being sold at discount prices without your consent as you put your blood sweat and tears into each of them.
If only Jeffre could make friendly budget line products for us mommas on a budget 😂
If people can’t see he’s low key devastated I don’t even know what to say… you can absolutely see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice
1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version 15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
I’m jamming to boys are back in town in the background
why would you buy it and not leave it in the store to be sold? tf
“See you next time” … lmfao no he won’t
I love Nordstrom rack ..
30.07.22
I love how he took all of it 🤣🤣🤣 he really said you guys can buy it online from me. Thank you. Lol
I did find a Nikita Dragun pallet in TJ Maxx in Michigan. There was only 1. I was stoked to find it.
Hello gorgeurs girl.. love sweden... Hapyy so see u so heath...
why did he put shane in the thumbnail?
i loved when we broke the site, i have the big palette still to this day lol
To be honest in remember when that make up launched it broke the website and everyone wanted it but now sadly after the event of summer 2020 it ended up like this
Hmm . Cute way to introduce Shane back in the picture 🤣 ,
https://youtu.be/n7q3qi6Oj24
But thank God its there because for somebody like me who lives on 700 a month now I can get something that you make because I still dont own anything you have made because of bills but 1 day I swear I'm going to buy something you made❤
Lml 🤣
11:59 "cue me and Shane moving to farms"..... Its 2022 and Jeffrey now owns a Yak ranch.
Love this hair on you 😍😍😍
Love
Jeffree buying his own makeup 😂 that’s funny
omggg
It's ok  Jeffree we love you and your products ❤️❤️
Olá bom dia!!
For those who don’t know about how products get to “discount” stores. They are sold by the company if they aren’t doing great to get them out of their stocks or are expired or are from a warehouse that closed down.. aka his company sold it to them to remove it from his stock.
Wish my Nordstrom rack has his products lol 😂 I don’t wear makeup but I just wanna have Jeffree Star brand

Thank you for taking be along for the ride🚗. So good to get to know you. Bunny sings your praises, so knew to come here and sub.🤩😘
I would be proud to see my things in any store. Some people unfortunately can’t afford full price things and having things at a lower price is a pretty nice thing, it brings more popularity for the brand and for future costumers to come.
They were cracking me talking about the make up being in Nordstroms like it was Target Kmart or Walmart 😂😂😂😂
Shane “see you at the rack” 😂😂😂
I don't think he liked seeing his makeup in Nordstrom, otherwise he wouldn't have purchased multiple of the same products, let alone the amount he did, so others wouldn't buy it.
all of a sudden now that his products are at discount stores is isn't bad and he isn't ashamed because its "overstock" mhm
Omg I was working there when they all came through and everyone was going crazy lmaooo I bought so much before it even went on the shelf
How did I miss this video
Me: Just thinking about the people on Poshmark saying. I only swatched it will sanitize before mailing.  Me: Um you shouldn't be selling that.  It's USED and GRoss.
lol why it happened. so stupid. you sell your products to a store. end of transaction and then when THEIR stock doesn't sell it sometimes get resold in bulk or "sale" to a resell store like Nordstorm. legally you don't have a say. cute you think so.
Love the wig giving me mermaid vibes
For some reason I wasn’t sure if Shane and jeffree were friend’s anymore, but I’m glad they still are 😭😭 I missed them together
for everyone saying nordstrom is a expensive store it is ! nordstrom rack on the other hand is there discount store for name brands for cheaper. i got micheal kors heels for $16
Can someone tell me the time stamp for when Shane is in the vid
I'm so glad to see you guys together..even if it is just facetime! I can't wait to see more of you guys together!!!
Getting stabbed in the back hurts but what hurts more is when you turn around and see whose holding the knife
I think it's ok for jeffree star makeup to be at discount store it's fine I would still buy it.
Do the bots in this comment section really not know the difference between NORDSTROM and Nordstrom Rack? I'm truly baffled.
Humbling moment for him
TJ Max and Nordstrom Rack are not in the same universe
Her face gives me nightmares
Her face give me nightmares
I miss your content and your adventures!  If you need an adventure buddy, hit me up.
Jeffree star ⭐️ inspired me to have my own YouTube channel ♥️♥️♥️ lotzzzz of lov ♥️
He has grown so much through the years. Such a positive change.
Lol ALL of his collections are sold at both Nordstrom Racks on Oahu.
Yeah, I would never buy any Jeffree Star product unless it comes from the Jeffree Star website. I am NOT getting some used nasty covid makeup from a shelf.
The real Jeffrey fans remember him saying that about kvd LOL an iconic moment
I definitely see Jeffrey star maturing
imagine being THIS rich
prolly cuz its shit
YOUR GAY JEFF YOUR GAY
As soon as he got out of his car “JEFFREEEEEE” 😂
Nordstrom is a CLEARANCE STORE?!?!?!?!
Why would he buy it all up instead of letting ppl who otherwise couldn’t afford it be able to buy it … like I just don’t get it. I think he was embarrassed lmao
So you werent concerned that it wasnt a counterfeit or dupe, actually have not seen dupes of any of your makeup period which is very good, which not sure if that is written anywheres n your contracts or clauses…
I believe Jeffree bought it from the marshals connected to the Nordstrom because their price stickers look like that…that is probably why Nordstrom said they didn’t have because they didn’t marshals had it.  And marshals is a huge discount store where you by designer and high end products at a reduced price.  These store get this stuff when either the manufacture made so many and it’s getting close to expiring so they will sale is to these places to sale discounted so they don’t lose all the money from it not selling.  Also if the products are slight defected.  Most of them though you can’t even detect the defect.  Example….the original Jean had buttons on the back pocket but for some reason a group up of them to get the buttons so they are defective
I will always buy directly from a online retailer and pay a higher price to not have sticky fingers all over my stuff.
Jeffree buying the entire stock of his own product is amazing!!!
Jeff is just real af!
When you meet Jeffree Star and take a selfie with a mask on LOL 😂 who would’ve ever thought !
Good morning Jeffree and your amazing family Familiá friends and Team! Idk how to word everyone but I didn’t forget anyone! Thank you for giving me the motivation to finally do my laundry and eat some lunch today. I LOVE YALL and I am so proud of you for all of your accomplishments!!!!! You have truly also come from NOTHING and look at YOU NOW!!!! That’s exactly why i have been subscribed to you for so long! Yaaaaaaaaaas QUEEEN! Also I know I said something like this before but why would I stop now?! For most people it’s about money! Never for me. You are truly one of the most Humble People I have ever seen and I look up to you so much a My Fellow Queen / King / Best Friend/ Mentor y Mentorá ETC! Also you helped me eat some lunch yesterday too! I love the Louis Vitton white red and blue shirt and when you SNAPPED I CACKLED!!! I UNDERSTAND! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I live in loveland  colorado and our marshals had a few things of Jeffrey star
😂
A privately owned Tibetan yak ranch in the outskirts of Casper, Wyoming 🏔 Not open to the public, thank you!     why have a website if we cant visit the ranch on it???
"That's a deal!" 🤣 I love it lol
You said it you owed it now it's over let it go out into the universe and not attach its negative energy to your Heavenly life!
Literally there’s a lady in the small town I live in that sells a bunch of palettes at our local “Sale barn” she had the Cremated palette which I thought was weird. But I’ve been wanting a conspiracy palette since they came out but never got myself one cause ima mom and don’t spend money on myself like that lol. But I’m really thinking this conspiracy palette I got from her is fake. It’s not the component that looks like a coffin with the clasps on it, but she said that the ones she was selling were “the seconds”. So idk how she had a bunch of conspiracy palettes and even the Cremated palette along with Naked stuff, Kylie makeup, all kinds of stuff. I’m upset now after using it cause I was soooo excited. But at least I can say I kind of have a conspiracy palette lol.
Jeffree u are always wild babe but can we talk about how ur sitting on that couch  🤣 idk why but it's throwing me off so hard
Tj max has it too. Like you don't know.
Jeffrey donate to some goodwill out here on the east coast!! Specifically WV 😉 😂 I'm a goodwill junkie and I would fall over dead if I seen some Jeffrey star makeup there lol. Or you could just donate to this poor mama of 2 teenage daughters who steal all my elf makeup 😂
As it should be.
Did you really buy all the makeup so nobody else could? Wow
You look great! 😊
they are probably damaged out items being sold. look at the packaging falling apart
Yeah it sucks but isn’t it so neat that people that are fans of you really wanted it and not a lot of people shop at the discounted stores so everyone can have a piece of you
I still love my pallet . Great colors.
Ummm…I’m going to Nordstrom‘s to see if I can find some of his makeup! I’m glad that JS is in a better space and taking this well. 🤗 Like JS said that his makeup is at a good price in the economic climate at Nordstrom’s. I can only buy his products one at a time, and maybe once or twice a year. I love his products, but it is out of my price range like Pat McGrath. I can only purchase her products once every year also. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Oh to be rimmed by jeffree
love you jefree <3
"Me him and a security guard....  Three some."  😂😂
You are loveable , I don't just watch you for your makeup reviews!!
Ummm a lot of older n bigger brands are found on clearance, he should not be upset but take it as a compliment, plus Nordstrom is too expensive for me to go to . So I m guessing ppl who go there would just be happy to see it there . I hve bought 4 of his products online , and I am very happy with his pricing, with a little bit of saving I am still able to get his make up . His products are amazing .
How did you and Morphy and relationships should I just Google it
Nordstrom Rack isn’t really on sale. Some items are, but brand names, are the same brand; unless, they are on clearance.
Is that legal??? Like to not even tell u they are selling UR products and taking UR income
That hair is everything.
When your shits at dollar tree or something THEN you can talk & be like WTF. But I think he meant he didn't approve it being sold at Nordstrom.
Jefferey I so so so soooo love your attitude!!! Also that throw back clip of the kvd still makes me laugh so hard. It was truly funny!! And the way you took it to finding your own brand on discount was great!! You took it well and that says a lot about you
Is this at the Beverly Center? Been there once to buy a Louie 🗣….then I went over to the Ross dress for less🤣
SHEGLAM make up review, make up is on SHEIN. Please 🖤
Bonjour
I don't know why Jeffree most likely using a business credit card to buy his own makeup cracks me up
I love that Jeffree and Shane are still great friends! I can’t wait for the Yak farm yayyyyy
I feel bad for Jeffrey your rich but omg you have nothing else to do then buy make up from a store you won’t even shop because it’s not good enough for you rich people
Good call on the donating. That was a nice touch.
I love Shane and Jeffree. I’m so excited for them to see each other’s farms lol
Love how he pretends to not know how his makeup got there 🤣🤣
he seems kind.
Aslong as its still selling don’t worry, ... & why not let people get a little bargain at your expense, no drama 🙌🏼
You all have so much money If you give me some money, you have nothing less May all my dreams come true because of you I need money to build a house of my own.
I buy my clothes at Goodwill , and save hundreds of dollars .
I would LOVE to find his makeup at Nordstrom!!
Shane cancel..... by next
That guys haircut 🥸
12:02 this laugh 😂 is my favorite part of this entire video   *I can’t breathe*  🤣🤣
Ohhhhh...now “it needs to go somewhere”.  “Smart Business”. What it boils down to is you just can’t produce anymore.
I saw your pallets in TJ maxx for 10 each.
Hi JS! You inspire me to be my best and conquer my wildest dreams. Thanks for being ‘you’. You mean the world to me. xoxo, BMINTcondition 💚❤️💚😘
How do you not know where your inventory is being allocated to? lol
tg
Should have bought it and given it to the cashier.
I saw some of your makeup at Dona pancha flea market a few years ago. Should have recorded it. No joke either this was for real
Hahaha, Jeffree Trolls the Tea Channels 😅 I wonder if they even understood that, I mean They're not the smartest^^  on Point Jeffree🙏👍🏻♥️
I wouldn't care either. I already collected my bag, haha
I bet battered woman's shelters would LOOOVE your donations!  I bet it would really boost their self esteem to look pretty
I love Nordstrom Rack. The way I see it, the more places it is being sold, the better!😎❤️💙😍
There's no JSC in TK Maxx in Australia however :(
So happy to see you two together again 😍
Nordstrom rack is generally cheaper than the store itself it’s all sales in there lol 😆
Wait so does he profit from it being in Nordstrom?
So what has happened with Shane ...
Shane!! Aw, I miss seeing yall two together!!
Why does he think his shit is too good for Nordstrom
Why the fuck does it matter el heffe!!!! It's just makeup
💋💄👄🧡💜💙💚❤️
You. are a gay
Guess I'm going there on payday 😉👍🏽
If I saw this on sale imma buy it cause the quality.. and it’s on saleeee
Lol and Marshall’s so yeah
I remember the day of launch sitting with my grandma refreshing to check out got the conspiracy pallet and two of the lip glosses… memories 🤣
A lot of that opened packaging (the box) could just be curious people wanting to see the product before buying it. There's less manners but also less appropriate opportunity to see/test these things in the liquidation stores. XD
So if it's just the 3 of them does that mean the security guy is filming? 😭❤️ If he is he's a g
Love your friendship w Shane 💕
LMFAO you were the first one to trash every single person that ended up at Nordstrom Rack and here you are. " This is where brands come to die!" Karma finally came around for you and im LIVING for it.
Who tf would want to walk around with that hair. That's hideous
❤❤❤❤❤💙💙💙💙💙❤❤❤❤💙💙💙💙
My words are with Bailey I am marked By the H and the K my skin is showing
I saw one of his products at Ross.
i wanted to buy it when it launched but it was so hard to get esp in hawaii.  so now that theyre in nordstrom rack its so nice i found blue blood and the conspiracy palette at a decent price so im happy and worth the wait
I swear I love It  jeffree he’s amazing
Jeffree has seriously grown up so much I love to see him calling himself out and being honest with himself about the shade he threw @ KVD. I’m so glad he’s making videos again seriously missed this!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Why did i get the vibes that you're mad that your expensive makeup is slightly cheaper? Not all beauty queens can afford good stuff so wouldn't you want everyone to be able to afford it..?
I am going to watch you in youtube until you are 90 years old 👵
Love you Jeffree!!!
There’s nothing wrong with being in a discount store. I’m glad he addressed his prior comments about it actually. This allowed some people on a tight budget to enjoy some good products so it’s a good thing all around.
I appreciate how jeffree explained how backstock works and how they resell it to other retailers then, so makes sense, but why did you buy all their stock of your products then?
This store is how I can afford your makeup... I'm down to halftime work these days and appreciate finding it.
No nails?
Have always loved that he says hello & takes pics with his fans instead of giving them the cold shoulder like some famous people do
I’m always negative in my account so if Jeffery would of asked me to swipe my card for him cuz he forgot his I would of done it anyways and told the cashier no she was wrong and her machine broke or sum that’s why it’s making that funny sound. 😂
I feel like this video shows a lot of growth! 2020 and 2021 were crazy, hard and a rollercoaster, but gave everyone hopefully a lot of perspective for 2022❤️
Omg my mood just lifts when jeffree says ‘ hi gorge’ ‘ live’ ‘faboo’
I think i saw stuff in cvs and thought it was weird
Nah they be selling fake makeup products! Defective ones too
https://youtu.be/-W_Qis3MeB4
Is Shane no longer canceled? LOL not that I believe I canceling anyone but was just wondering
Jeffrey you need to do a revenge palettes
2.5 million views. Give the people what they really want 😂
Growth. You can literally see it on you. You have grown so much
I always wanted the Ryland and are you filming lippies but I never found them 😭
Make more videos Jeffreeeee
I love jeffrey
Wait i love that there together
I've heard TJ Maxx has it too but I haven't seen it at my local one.
Is that a man carrying Jeffries bag
🤣🤣🤣it’s the fact that he act like he don’t know , drug lord was 9$ your shit ain’t hitting like that u an that weirdo Shane 🙄
In the beginning of the vid jefree Reminded me of barbie
omg i missed shane
Those products launched two years ago.  I don't think it's odd at this point that they would be in Nordstrom Rack.  Now had they been released a few months ago.....
Jeffreeeee I can tell your energy has changed in such a positive way you're glowing! happy to see you so happy! ❤
That camera man a little shaky it’s bugging me
So your still oodles of money anyway what is the big deal
I really want to see you and shane/Ryland soon!!
Jeffree is so sweet to her fans .. hope to see u also
……Meanwhile theres Jeffery Star products in Marshall’s for like 12$
They do not come any more nauseating than Jeffree Star! 🤢🤮
i want to go to the good wills where he donates stuff😂
Is Colorado where all the cancelled YouTubers go to die?
Oh dear. He's such a bad actor! What a joke!
I'm wondering what's the big freaking deal ?
Honestly I see this as a good thing
Welp this is one weird fucker for sure
This makes me want to fo to Nordstrom rack but I’m pretty sure their makeup section is going to be dry after this video🤣
He was friends with Ian watkins. Let that sink in
As a single mom with 4 kids who always come first, ALL of my high end makeup comes from clearance stores. I'm glad you are embracing this because it's the only way lots of people could be able to obtain your brand. I will kill to come across anything from your line in a clearance store. Even if it was used! I've not owned anything of yours and have followed you for YEARS. Hopefully it will appear in clearance stores near me soon! Please embrace this and be happy more people will be able to use and love your brand!!!
This was probably hard to do. You look good and good on you for addressing this
I was wondering if u two are still friends... love to see, that you are still there for each other
You can donate make-up to me! 😂 I have the full sized Jeffree Star + Shane Dawson palette and would love to own the rest because the formula it's unlike anything I've used. However, being sick and having 3 boys to raise alone makes that really hard. But I'm working on my collection... however if you wanna help an aspiring makeup artist out 😏😂💋🖤 Stay your phenomenal Wicked self!
oh no. stay away from fillers, pillow face as a terrible way to go out. I don't know if it's the focal length or something but your head and neck look too large for your body, I don't know how to describe it.
What’s a clearance store?
Jeffrey  didn't  buy his own   makeup, the other guy  did.
Jeffree star comesrics is being sold at Marshall’s and tj maxx still just the regular products not the Shane Dawson one
It’s still in clearance stores !
Who’s here?  Jan 1st 2022!
Who the f decided to put Jeffery cosmetics in a dare I say it "clearance" store uhm NO PERIOD
Is anyone else ready for some more videos from Jeffree 🤗
Like your shows
I dead ass just went to Nordstrom rack here in upstate ny and I literally had a heart attack when I saw Jeffree Star’s makeup there. I’m not even joking is the sad part, I passed out right in my footsteps when I saw all of his makeup there 😭😭😭😭
Can someone tell me if the velour liquid lips are gluten free? Asking for a friend
Omg I’d die to find this soche
Have you left Wyoming for good?
6:45  ICONIC moment
the way he got off ft with shane is beyond accurate😂
Hey jef your withered soul is bleeding through all of your over priced makeup. Of all the lascivious , pitiful creatures I've had the displeasure to witness in my life you are truly the most unremarkable and I've lived in Indiana
Um
Where was Shane in the video wtf
your life big sad but you strong girl great life sampil I miss you and I am watching you
Able to get it cheaper else where bc you've been called out for behavior. It's rough but its life
I find this funny cause he always made fun of other makeup brands such as KVD and many others showing up at Marshall’s and look where he is today , karma is real guys
TJ Maxx in Florida has several of your products.
…
Speaking of make up you and James Charles should do a make up line.

So Shane is back?
ROLL THE SERIES 😂😂😂😂
My sister got me the mini controversy pallet for Christmas from Nordstrom and I probably wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it if it wasn’t there so thank you Shane and Jeffree ❤️
I love you so much and I love the amazing human being that you are and have become.
Damn I am late
I wouldn't exactly compare Nordstrom rack to Marshalls because its still not the greatest deals on alot of brands and by no means is it a lower class store. They legit sell valentino, gucci, burberry, prada lol
Your makeup should be available at dollar tree at this point
This eyeshadow is everything.
Blue blood palette was at Nordstrom rack too…. Of course I bought it
Why does it matter what the fuck store the product is selling at? That’s what I don’t understand and that’s what you come off as a narcissist when you think Norstrom is like a bad thing who cares man make money and make it wherever why does it matter? Petty shit
DRUM ROLL PLLSSS!!! #TEA #DRAMA #LAWSUITS #MORETEA!! GURLL!!

How gay can a single person be?
Living corpse
Jeffree please let me work for you & be a real friend con  good, bad, and ugly. Reach out! I just want to smoke and work for you so badly and show you that people from Latin America are what you need… 🧉we don’t abandon our friends in bad times!
Why not leave it so someone who can't afford the full price off your website can have the chance to actually be able to buy and enjoy your products?
You have grown so much!
Guys disclaimer ⚠️ ⛔️ 🚨 outlet stores don’t have back stock! It’s 95 percent of the time just fake
Hello from Denver Colorado USA I just want to say that I love all of you guys and I hope that you're all doing well in your new homes
Lol I wonder if he knows it’s also at tjmaxx and marshals
Really beautiful luv your videos
Clothing movement
Jeffree it happened because you were cancelled
I’ve also seen the makeup at Burlington and TJ Max😂
Thank you for mentioning Wyoming I have lived in Wyoming for 50 years and I'm going to buy my granddaughter some of your makeup    I'm old so I don't wear makeup

when i bought your pallet at marshals a year 1/2 ago
I understand about big department stores doing this for a discount with ur makeup......but I don't know if YOU know this miss thang BUT people on Facebook have groups with all of your makeup, in bulk selling it for the low as well which I believe is pretty sheisty and illegal tbh I've said something about this to the group and even took pics, and got bitched out over the internet because I have done so!😬just thought you should know because you work so hard for your brand.....love you miss thang😘😁❤️💯
EW it’s Shame Flawson🤢
Because it's a shit product
ive been so out of the loop.. didn’t they beef 😭
I wish I could just be your friend omg 😱 blesssed is you babydoll much luv jeffree star 🌟 💕🥰😇
I wish I could just be your friend omg 😱 blesssed is you babydoll much luv jeffree star
Remember when you use to shade makeup companies for ending up in TJMaxx and now your makeup can be found there?
Ooh I’m excited for new content.
Tjmax also
Also I did just buy the cremated palette for 32 lol
It’s not even just conspiracy now tho lol
The jeffree and shane crumbles I’m getting. ❤️ Missing your collabs too much! I’m rewatching everything from 2019 🥲
Also available in flea markets
Jeffrey star makeup formula is brilliant! “Celebrity skin “lipstick is my fave ever
Cashier didn’t even smileyez! 😂
I hate Jeffree, Shane and Ryland.
Also in NYC... I saw tons of your product sis!
Defaq am I watching
you look like a magick anime superhero today, LOVE YOU IN YOUR CLOTHING,  do you realize how beautifly you created yourself glamozon?
You and Bella Thorne are twins !
You are such an icon 💖  I love all your products me and my twin. Thank you for being real!
It's just me, him and a security guard..... THREESOME 🤔 Just Kidding 😋 Omg Jeffrey your humour
So happy you and Shane are doing videos again! I’ve missed this
You look great
Living for you
Shane left all his real friends behind and attached himself to the fake one.
There is a secret society called the Freemasons. The high up elite that run this world are luciferians. Your friend Jeffery star here is one of them. He sold his soul to the devil. Anyways these Freemasons have been deceiving you so that you may not find God. God cast satan down to this earth “to rule all nations”. He is the god of deception. He is here to decieve. Luciferian Freemason elites run this world and they are here to decieve you. They worship Lucifer. The Freemasons believe that Lucifer is the god of light, and that God is darkness. They believe that they have all the light in the world, and that “you, the non believer and the believer of Christ” are in darkness. When that’s not the case. The Freemasons laugh at the atheists and the agnostics because they know Lucifer is real, they know God is real. Again they worship Lucifer. You see, Lucifer is their God, their friend, and they believe that Jesus Christ is their enemy. These luciferians that run this world are here to decieve, depopulate you, and bring forth a one world religion and a one world government. The luciferian elite like to call it their “New World Order”. And when they have finally implemented their new world system you will be a slave to that system and you will have unknowingly accepted the mark of the beast and you will not be able to make it to heaven, you would be thrown into the lake of fire. Actually most of you would probably be dead by then because they want to bring the earth down to 5M people *cough *cough Bible prophecy *cough *cough Georgia guidestones. You see, satan runs the Vatican. Last month the luciferian Freemason world leaders met at the Vatican and signed a covenant with the Pope for a one world religion. *cough *cough Bible prophecy. Read the Bible, everything that God wants you to know is in there, the Bible has prophesied everything that is happening today. Get right with God. And to the people that read this and don’t believe me. Do some research on “operation lockstep, Agenda 21, HR127, HR6666, freemasonry, and the Bible”. And to Jeffery star,  if your reading this… JESUS WINS 😂😂😂
This made me sad. Cancel culture is so ugly and unnecessary
So when stores close products get moved to discount store. Its very common. There nothing wrong with this.
I hope Jeffree is only upset that someone is possibly ripping his makeup off. & not the stigma behind it being in what he considers a “low end” store… I would love for my makeup to be accessible everywhere for everyone
Imagine a goodwill in a city filled with billionaires... 👁️👄👁️
*If you knew it was overstock why did you buy it and keep it away from people who support you but can’t pay the higher prices that they’d pay buying it direct coupled with delivery fees? That seems kinda janky.😶*
oh jeffree 😂 ily
?78;”
BS you didn't know. So dumb.
Love you both 💕
I kinda wish that he didn't buy EVERYTHING in Nordstrom 😔.. Someone who couldn't afford the full price could have benefited from a cheaper price.. JS 🤷
hate him all you want, he’s very smart with the business side of his company
Okay but why buy them all? All you are going to do now is trash it, let someone who actually wanted it buy it.  I understand buying one of each to "see if it's real"; but there was no need to buy them all just so no one else can.
I Stan I live for my bitch jeffree YAS!
I thought jeffree sold his house in LA?
Literally all of his makeup is there not just this collab! His ass is canceled and that’s why. Now he looks stupid.
Lmao and now its at TJ Maxx
We have it in va
MORE SHANE AND JEFFREE
It’s freaking Nordstrom not 7-11. Remember where you came from…
Do you have a phone number for points?? Yeah… ok suuuure lady 😂😂
" poor people " that's me 👋
Ha! That’s most definitely karma for him. We love karma humbling people like js
I love your videos ! 🧡
When Jeffree puts Shane in the thumbnail but Shane is no where to be seen. I only clicked for him ffs 🤔
Aww that first location was "my" Nordstrom Rack location when I lived in L.A. :)
I miss jeffree and Shane's collabs soo much it hurts 🥺
1:17 “Deep into LA” probably the valley
“Roll the series” 😭 and the singing came in ☠️
I love how much you’ve grown Jeffree and matured , ily 🤍
I am happy to see GROWTH 🤍🌿
👑👑👑👑👑
Amamos 😍😍😍😍
Jeffery my dad went to school with you!!!
this gave me so much nostalgia
I purchased 2 Alien palettes I also got 2 mirrors and lipsticks
You’ve matured and I love it.
Embarrassed bc he’s in the same predicament…that’s not growth
Why is Shane in the thumbnail lmfao
I went to Nordstrom rack union square last month in nyc and there were shelves on shelves of Jeffrey and Shane’s. Not on clearance but like regular price. I saw conspiracy palettes blood lust blood sugar blood money cremated palettes velour liquid lips. I was surprised and shook how stocked it was. But if Jeffrey is ok with it then I’m ok with it. 👍 just means more people can dive into the world of Jeffrey star.
I love that shane and jeffree are still besties !!!!
he’s grown so much n it makes my heart smile 🥺🥺 congrats to you JS, much love n healing energy 🤍✨
Making everyone feel like peasants for shopping there... Not sure how this shit ended up on my home page. Not a supporter in any way.
There is a bunch online now lipstick and everything.
What a mission ......so shallow
Good to see you talk about the past
We need new videos with Shane❤️❤️❤️
2.3 million idiots watched this before I clicked smh
me subscribing my second account lols can't ignore queen J's channel
He looks so healthy compared to the old clip
he didn’t need to buy all of it tbh he could have left the duplicates there for people who could not regularly afford his makeup or high end makeup in general
I WANTED TO SEE SHANE IN THE VIDEO 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Why did he have to buy all they had on the shelves? Someone else could’ve have bought it
I’ll have to get my Annette a small pink bowl.. she went blind from diabetes this year...she hasnt let it stop her!  I love all the products! ❤️❤️
Watching you grow and mature...love it ❤
They sell a lot of high brands in them stores
funny how he goes and buys them out so no one else can have it at an affordable price. 😂 that’s so messed up, basically you can only be a fan of Jeff if you have money. lmfaooo
So cute .... Bless obviously no one has told them there on clearance everywhere. Was epic while it lasted 🤣
I love how far you've come! matured very well
His wig looks cheap
Amazing energy my friend, as usual. And the biggest generosity in the make up world. ❤️
Yeah go to the store and buy all the products that are not selling. Totally makes sense
Oh my gosh, it's 2021, why are people are still using plastic bags? Is it common in LA to use plastic bags?
Bruh i was expecting shane to be in the video because of the thumbnail🤦‍♀️
Love you but take that tattoo off your handsome face
Sodom and Gomorrah
Yo !.. I love how hard you stand behind your brand! you have fought extremely hard to get where you are ...BUT  it's incredibly insulting & insensitive to call Nordstrom a clearance store, when in fact the average person cannot afford to shop there 😪  we love and support you so much but sometimes finding your products in stores like this is the only way we can afford it!  I know none of us know enough about your life to pass judgements, but I would assume you have been at a point at sometime in your life that you would know what it's like to not be able to afford things that you want  Honestly a majority of your consumers & viewers here probably are middle/lower class like  Myself and this is hurtful 💔  Never be ashamed of your wealth but jeez please,  please,  please try to be more considerate of your consumers in the future  Much love and respect girl !
Need a better camera man, so wobbly made me sick 🤢
I feel like a lot of people have been there,  you know your going to the store yet you still leave your wallet at home
Yoooo if jeffree asked me to pay I’d be sweating my ass of cause girl I’m broke
The hair isn’t it at all....maam
He bought it all so no one would see his stuff in there lol
2:58 wtf.. asks someone do you have your wallet on you? u don't pay for thing yourself when you go out and shop at a store
I am obsessed that Shane and jeffree are still friends 🥰🥰 they are literally the best of friends and the fact Jeffree didn’t drop him over some fake ass shit is amazing and he’s a real one ❤️❤️❤️
I think this made him actually go a little crazy inside seeing his makeup there.. eek
I’m so glad for you and Shane. You two are OG’s and not going anywhere.
The echoing in the house and audio 😩
Great speaker.. .wush he would do talks re businss
Your back in Nordstrom rack full on pallets lippys powders etc
Did you see Rich Lux new video they are now selling most of Jeffrey star ⭐️ pallets and lipstick 💄
Are you a girl or boy? Not trying to be offensive or anything
and its not all Nordstrom racks I went to like 4 and It wasnt there
I still want to get the pallette ♡
facts I def waited 2 hours for my pallet and u def broke Spotify lmaoo
God your energy in this video is great, I hope doing amazing
Lmao they're still making vids?
Man, Nordstrom rack is still expensive and the one in Manhattan definitely doesn't have a "Marshall or TJ Maxx vibe" at all. Honestly felt super expensive and SUPER organized. Jeffree even got his one shelf area with only a handful of other brands. Also, I heard they don't accept just any makeup brand so they're still better than Marshall's or TJ Maxx for a creator's reputation I suppose 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Ooohhh  karma is awkward😬
Oh my god I love you
I HEARD Northern Iraq  tho omgg !
Hell I can finally afford it.
I came here from meatcanyon hi poor people
Had nothing to do with weird SD getting cancelled, huh? SMH
I just want to be a Jeffree in my life ⭐💘
Awww I am soooo glad you and Shane are still friends omg my heart needed this today....I've been out of the loop I've taken a looooong break from all social media and beauty videos for peace of mind! This was a great welcome back
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate how positive Jeffrey is in this video
YOU have MORE MONEY than that KID and he PAYS for it??? I hope you paid him back……..
So glad you guys are still friends! Best of luck to both of you 🤍
Wow I haven't seen your videos in a while. But Jeffree you are looking stunning. You look so fresh and beautiful❤
It was called karma baby 😂😂
Embarrassing when you slated KVD when her makeup was in TGMAX LMAOOOOO AHAHA dear lord what a sad little life Jane
It was so cute when you said to your fan Hi Georgeus!When my friend say this it makes me smile.But hearing this for Jeffree Star♥️I would feel special for a month!😘
It’s the fact Shane is STILL hanging with Jeffree.. he don’t learn?!
6:28
Hi jeffreestar,pls keep healthy & stay blessed...more power to your channel...😍😘😍
I thought that TJMaxx scene was mf ing hilarious and one of my favorite scenes...💜
It’s actually really cool maybe someone who really wanted it and couldnt afford it was able to get some stuff . still one of my fave collections x
💞💞
At first when Jeffree bought all the make up I was feeling feisty like "no let us poor folks get the good stuff too!" Then he was like "I'm going to donate this and tons of other stuff to charity".... Me: *puts foot in mouth* That's amazing though. I'm new to the good quality make up game and I'm thinking about popping my jeffree star v-card but don't know what to get!
Why you are so beautiful?
Also found some of your makeup at tkmax in uk x
“Threesome 👀” lol had me dying. I love his sense of humor 💜
I wish I could meet you. Your videos have helped me through some really hard times I have been going through. Thank you for teaching me to love myself (But I’m still learning) ❤️
I find it funny how no one is talking about how Jeffree didn't talk about him missing his wallet and he's still driving, did he have his license on him or in his car???
I bet the LA Goodwills are goldmines. lol
So glad you are back!
Bitch I want it it doesn't deserve to be there I been wanting that pallet
💖💖👌👌💖💖
So happy to see this video!!! And to see you and Shane back at it!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I love how he buys back his makeup so someone with less money can’t buy it
Time of the season has always been a favorite song and for this version to be in the series was so amazing for me. I remember listening to it on repeat. Some of my favorite lipsticks are in the Shane collab. Sometimes it’s such a treat getting makeup thats no longer being distributed by Too Faced or Anastasia with a discount
Cringggggeeeee
Yes need makeup review I cannot match colors or apply at all.. I need assistance 😫
I miss this kind of video like she going out to a store for makeup
Wait What the fuck how did I just see this?!
Oh I love you and Shane
Over stock, Jeffree built a brand on scarcity
Ok but… why do I feel like you just brought up the KVD comment to get ahead of other people reminding you that you said that? Ok, you said you’re sorry then went on to completely change your stance about “clearance stores” only AFTER your brand was found in the same type of store. Not a great look. Lol. I have to wonder if he would apologized for the comment had his makeup not been found there
Literally just got my first palette by you and I can’t wait for it to come!
Is it awful because you genuinely feel bad or because it’s your product now in a “low end” store? This isn’t shade this is a straight forward question.
"Me, him and a security guard.  Threesome?!"
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😮
This looks soooooo fake. It is obviously advertising "purchasing" his own brand in a common store to influence others do the same. 👍🏻😜
You are so much happier and it SHOWS.
all it means is that Nordstrom ordered soo many that they couldn’t sell out of them, so they send the excess out to the outlets to sell for cheaper prices so they still make their money
I know where you bought it? I live around the block
Hell yes you and Shane together again hunky Dory!!!!  😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘💕💕💋💋💋
the hair looks really good on you
Hello🐻
I dont know, but Shane is toxic.

Lol the nerve of them telling you; you can't film in here is funny. I would be like "well if I can't film in here then you can't sell my makeup. Lol
I’m happy to see they’re still friends❤️
i need a shane x jeffree vlog
Hiyaaaaaaaaaa xxxxxx
I admire how you've grown in humility and with your business sense. You're able to reflect on your past actions and also understand that you still have things to learn~ and that's awesome. 🥰
Jeffree keep posting this kind of videos. I miss this and i miss you seeing enjoying life. I just love the vibe and I ove you Jeffree! ❤️
Why are you needing to use shane as clickbait ? Is your channel going THAT downhill or something
I literally got physically stabbed by a ex best friend of ten years can’t even use my hand anymore so it’s ok jeffree I understand it takes time to heal ….
People change and grow so much throughout their lifetime as they experience it. With having your whole life showcased on the internet for everyone to see for multiple years, it is almost guaranteed that you will have old videos of yourself saying and doing things that you don’t agree with now. JennaMarbles, Shane, and so many other Youtubers and celebrities have done it. The best thing to do is to reflect and make it clear that your views have changed and you aren’t the person that you were back then. You do this all the time, and I’m very proud of you for doing that. I don’t agree with the old toxic Jeffree, and neither do you. People need to normalize this and stop trying to say that people who apologize for their past self are fake. It’s growth honey
LMFAOOO SHE SAID THATS MY NAME IS YOUR STORE🤣🤣🤣🤣
What comes around goes around! no excuse
I mean, how can you not love Jeffree?
Your so amazing I look up to you so much
Make doll parts lipstick in full size. So that we can order . It never on sale and available on ur site ??
For some reason i thought Shane and Jeffree had a fall out??lmao idk why
7:20 Jeffrey i completely understand you were hurt you don't need to apologise some people just need to be put in their place
this is really embarrassing to watch. it's just a washed up old white business man buying his own shitty products at a clearance store and acting like he's surprised no one wants to buy his shitty, overpriced makeup. 🤢
I have to say Jeffree does not shy away from past questionable behaviour, openly admitting what he's done and apologising. That's a big deal.
Yay Shane and Jeffree!!!
Talk about a mini  controversy
I missed you Jeffree
i thought you always said it was your name and you knew exactly where your products are?  seems like something fishy here
I've found some amazing brand name makeup at TJ Maxx, that I could never afford otherwise. You should have left it there for someone else to buy.
POV: the worst ppl you’ve ever met having fun and being rich
We have the whole collection at tkmaxx in the uk 🇬🇧
Y’all deserve each other
sweetheart, pleeeeaassseee do a review on nikki tutorials brand❤️❤️❤️
You should have left some! Some of us are poor lol
since when is it a bad thing to find good product in Nordstrom? I got my Prada shades from there, lancome makeup remover...which is bigger than Jeffree Cosmetics. This video is wack. "Come back to earth you're not a unicorn."
Missed you a lot!
I’m glad Jeffree and Shane are still friends after not filming together for basically two year snow. I personally thought before when I was watching Shane and ryland move that they weren’t friends but I’m glad to see they are still in touch. Iconic friendship
I like Jeffrees energy in this vlog. Feels like less people, less problems
Yet no "sorry" was spoken
Are you buying it to just throw it out??
I've bought makeup from Ross, Marshalls etc. I do open the box to make sure the product has not been tampered with,.or used. I only buy new name brand makeup. But some of these boxes get torn up . Some people just don't care how they open the box.
YAY MORE JEFFREE AND SHANE VIDS
Y’all forgive him so fast.
after years of work… finally jeffree is becoming irrelevant
Jeffrey I don’t think that’s a bad thing I’m glad more people can buy it you have excellent make up… Everyone have a pleasant day🦋💜🦋
you are so pretty Jeffrey!!!!!!!☺
I can hear you b***** Stop it....lol alamitos after school on the way home😂💖💋
Come see my paaaaaaggggeeeee
Very nice to put your products on the shelf of Nordstrom and fake the whole thing.
The guy in the store picking up the makeup 🥺🥺
I was sporty insurance when i vaccined
9:53 😭😭😭😂
I’ve seen every brand someone where like this at least once!
Honestly impressed by the maturity and attitude about this situation compared to years past 👏🏼
LOLOL!!! You are a Riot! I went and watched your trying on TJ Maxx Makeup and just about pissed myself laughing! Bitch I adore you! Glad to see you happy and yourself again. Hugs!
Can’t believe he talks to Shane he’s so gross!🤢
LOVE that you & Shane have remained close friends!!! You both went thru so much and have apologized for your wrong doings! Everyone deserves a chance!  Loveeee you both! So happy to see you both coming back to this ugly world we live in!
I need more Shane and Jeffree makeup !
I would love to cook for u...! I know u would love it..just like everyone else that tries it for the first time ..and then they like omg when can u cook for me I'll bring everything u need.. am like uhmmm  I only cook for me and mines but okay.  I should charge this ppl right. Lol 😆
I fucking love you
Disgusting.
So gross.
I thought he was gonna go to Marshall's or tj max when he said clearance store lol 😢
you made it 😛
Jeffrees friend bought his makeup for him lol 😝 great friend though we know jeffree buys him stuff too , go off
How many times did Jeffre move? 🤔....... Bitch bankrupt ✖️
review 1212 gateway !!!!!!!
It’s also been seen in TK Maxxx so um let’s get another video explaining how that happened?
Don't buy it. Support Jeffree and buy from website
I love that Jeffree and Shane are still close. 💕
There is no jeffee starr in sansusky ohio
Everybody's favorite toxic and problematic duo❤️ I legit thought they weren't friends anymore
Love your  makeup even though I can never buy it
And this is why you keep your mouth shut. Lol..  NOWWW you wanna make the “i shouldn’t have said that” comment shut up 😂😂😂look at you now in Nordstrom 😂😂😂
He is sooooo nice with his fans! 🥰🥰
gaga chromatica & taylor swift folklore & evermore diss lola jeffree star tha albums bout Ontario cali & eddie
Real talk, when they teased they were making this video I went to three NR in the Salt Lake City area to try to snag some of this and none of them knew what I was talking about. :/
My only problem is he bought all of the pallets and the all of the same colors. I understand he wanted to test it out but he didn't need three of the same thing.
Crazy how he's that rich and didn't know about back stock and simple business stuff.
♥️
My god he’s so big headed, how does he even have followers? I fucking hate this world.
"oh my products are at a more accessible store where people may be able to afford them...let me buy it all"
how many subscribers did he lose💀
who is that guy?
Imagine Jeffree at 90 dressed this way. Yassssd bitch lmao
His friend or bf is such a brat. Like. Calm down ! You'll be forgotten once Jeffery drops you.
Please don't support shane :/
Omg. I didnt know Jeffree was back on again. Its been awhile. I missed u Jeffree. Glad the queen is back.
Every dog owner “I was picking out the dog hair on my mask” 😂❤️ same lol
Miss you Jeffreee
How can he go out in public without like 4 bodyguards?!
Definitely princess programming
I use to go to that plaza almost every weekend but I moved damn :((
"we have to buy it"  aka dont let anyone else see it here
Love you!! Please don’t donate to Goodwill!!! They suck!! If anything maybe the Salvation Army.  Or.... ME!!! 😛😬🥰😜😋😘
Savannah & Julie  Chrisley is also wearing the wrong shade...
We're so super excited to meet "Mr. Man star" too okay...please don't neglect hiiiimmm, we love him too, and don't let his big strong dusty heart forgeeettt ittt. We know you've been busy being him and he's re surfacing and all, n when he's ready, we get it if he's shy.. ;) 🏁
I actually want to purchase the palette!
Unfreeze your subscribers count.
This isn't normal, something is clearly leaching into humans DNA and fucking with the genetics. Hopefully some day we figure out what it is. For humanities sake.
Jeffree please do a video sheglam makup I would love to c this 🤩😍
But why buy all, it's not like your going to hide the fact that it's there by just buying it all from one store....
I mean. Where brands go to die is um kinda true 😬
Anyone who still hates Shane after hearing about those old videos and that joke about Cheeto. If you don't get over it, I'm gonna piss in your drink! #RemonetizeShaneYouTube
16 million followers/88k likes. Such ridiculous nonsense.
I'm just taking a moment to appreciate how beautiful Jeffrees house is.
Did he just hop onto the sofa with the shoes she wore out 🤣
I luv you!!!
Wait so I might be able to get a conspiracy pallette still?? Edit - I just ordered it from jeffree's site, I hadn't checked on it forever because I figured it would be sold out forever. So excited!!
id love for you and shane to do a 3rd series maybe some kinda ranch makeup collection or something ?
miss you guys.. ❣
All that for 67$?!?!
That’s embarrassing haha
So good to see jefree and Shane interaction 😍
Hahaha I remember that tj max vid.
Shane would love to live on a farm… 💀💀💀🤢
“The Boys are Back in Town” playing in the background is 👌😂😂
All I need is a edited version of this video 😭😂😭😂
I'm so glad ur back....I could tell u have had some major growth and healing....it shows....ur a good person jeffree, and u will ALWAYS be successful!
gotta admire her for talkin bout this.....very fun....enjoy the country life bb !
Gay
He was so embarrassed seeing his makeup there. Bought all of it so people wouldn't see his product discounted. Karma for the KVD comment.
Don't tell her about TJMaxx 🙃😅
Till this day I am still sad I was never able to get the brushes 😞
I’ve been watching your videos for a good few years now and I’d just like to say that you’ve come so far as a person and that you simply being you gives me the hope that some day I’ll be able to come out to my friends and family and have the confidence to be able to live my best life but for now I just gotta keep strong and keep the act up 🥺😢
I love the fresher jeffree. Seems to be feeling better and I'm so glad for that.
The fact that you’re still friends with Shane after all his creepy sh*t got exposed. You’re just as big of a fraud as he is. Can’t believe I used to look up to you.
How ironic he ripped other artists for having their makeup in these places haha. Karma baby
But why buy it! What If a fan wanted to buy it?
I loved how you've grown. It's nice being able to laugh at yourself and hold yourself accountable. Jeffree has matured but he's still one HOT 🔥  BITCH. XOXO BTW send some makeup to me. Single mommy here sending LOTS OF 💕❤💕❤ FROM CANADA🇨🇦
Oh wait he's not in Wyoming anymore ?... (It's been a minute)
Shane's is back
I’m guessing Nordstrom rack is like tjmax and Ross
Must admit I did laugh when Jeffrey went from “this is where the brands go to die” to “that’s actually a smart idea” 😂  either way I’m so glad you’re becoming a better person every day ❤️ I’m really happy to see you on top of your game again❤️
Good
So glad u and Shane are back the internet might me interesting again now. I have noticed watching u n Shane seperatly on your vlogs you've both "changed" uno more matured? Chill? It's beautiful to see love u both. Ya give me life 😅 love from the UK xxxx
The world needs a funny jeffree and Shane video those were literally the best of the best videos I cracked up watching and when Shane and jeffree laugh together OMG !! PLSSS we need them videos back !!!! MORE SHANE AND JEFFREE COLABS !!
I wished i lived in america where i can buy the awesome make up with discount. Since the launch i buyed 2 lip shades and still saving for the rest! But my day to day life has to be paid first. Thank you for the amazing videos jeffree!
Why u buy it all so the fans can't have none
Jeffrey you are a horrible person.
His makeup is at discount stores because it's overpriced shit. I bought some of the lipsticks and they had hair and mold, the eyeshadow looked like it had already been used.
I live in Colorado OMG I can't believe Shane moved here 😳😳😳❤❤❤❤crazy I know ryland's family lives here but I didn't know that Shane and ryland actually made the move here that's awesome 😍😍I hope I run into them one day at the market or somethin lol
i STILL need PUT IT BACK ugh
laugh at the lower unfortunate situation, youll end up there. then youll apologize for what was said while seeing people atthat point
Sureeeeee 🙄all of a Sudden you sound UNDERSTANDING CUS NOW YOUR AT THE GRAVEYARD 😂 Now Your Humble 🙄🤣😂 Hopefully this Time YOU DO STAY HUMBLE&DONT HUMILIATE OTHERS JUST CUS YOU HAVE BEEF!!! YOUR ALWAYS STARTING SHIT W OTHERS BUT WHEN ITS YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING!!! Hope to See all your Makeup at the Graveyard (how you call it) lmfaoooooo 🤣🤣😂😂😂 YASSSSSS!!
How can you walk around in public with slippers and then sit with them on your couch?
is he gay?
The start of the series song sent me lmao I'm here for it 😅❤
I almost got sad bc he bought all of it and i was thinking that there’s probably someone who would have really wanted it, but now someone who couldn’t have afforded it can have it for free bc he’s gonna donate it 🥺💗 Love that!
How the fuck are they still not canceled
Noooo Jeffree!!! Not Shane!!
I think it’s actually rlly nice to see makeup like Jeffrees at discounted stores. Makes it a lot more accessible to people like myself who other wise couldn’t afford to get higher end things
2:47 hehe the boys are back in town
Just the fact you have already many titles but one is best stelling make up line in the world is just damn🔥👏🏼👼🏼🙏🏼🥂💰…. Period!!
Jeffree: "It's just Me, him, and the security guard!"  *litterly filming* 🎥  Camera man : 👻
Clicked for Shane and there's no Shane
ДЖЕФФРИ ТЫ ЛУЧШИЙ  .
I'm sorry. Your wig is kinda not so good ..
I love how he just dgaf about any of this and just accepts it😂
When Nordstrom is being talked about like it’s a low tier store and you’ve always thought they were bougie and expensive… :/
✨They had MAC and YSL hey girl I’m dead ✨😂😂😂
So happy to see you again ❤️❤️
I can't find it in UK anywhere now 😢
I've really missed Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson. I want to see them do stuff together again! ❤️
Man I missed your vids sis 👁💧👄💧👁
Jefreeeeeeee  ***  your EYE LOOK IS FANTABULOUS!!!  Wow!!!!! AND your Hair look is YASSS a MARILYN MONROE AND BABY WITH A MERMAID!!! XOXOXO
What's so bad about Nordstrom
god ya'll have traumatized jeffree so much he has ptsd and is watching what he says to avoid any more damage to his career, ever tho we grew up loving his out the boundaries our spoke personality
We love Shane I'm so glade you guys are still friend's love from Nanny Star blue mountains Australia 🦘
Not sure why that’s a surprise after the scandals y’all are involved in.
Now I’m curious if they have it in Denver 👀
https://youtu.be/4xezF19bvtw 💗💗💗
Shane in the thumbnail made me happy but then it was just a facetime lol
I put your video on and you started talking my almost 8 month old daughter was all smiles.
Did Jeffrey have buccal fat removal? His face is snatched 👌🏻 🔥
Repeat yourself much....get on with it!!!!
Da una vecchia signora di ottantanni sei mitica!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😀😀😀💝💝💝
Bellissima!!!!!!
Hello Jeffree I love u... ❤️❤️❤️
I remember buying 2 palettes when they first dropped thinking that they would never be sold again. Boy was I wrong
I love us Scorpios !!
My local Tj Maxx has a whole bunch of your makeup
I missed these kind of videos!
you sould get some anklet’s they would look so pretty on you ankles !!!!
Donate some to me lol
Whoever it was did a awful job dying that wig 😭
...So Shane is coming back?
Jeffree you need a better cameraman, the camera is shaking all the time it's as if he or she has Parkinson's. the quality is worse than home movies at this point.
When I saw the thumbnail I thought it was another channel throwing shade at my girl.... But then I realized it WAS my girl I of course HAD to see what the fuck.? So much love to Jeffree and the best beauty bitch inside and out! 💋❤️
That wig is uhhhh maaaaze iiiiiiing!
I thought he sold his home in California?

The fact that he had to buy it all so it people wouldn’t see it in store 😂 love him tho
Get back into whatever hole you crawled out of to make this dumb video
Missed you too much 😭😭😭 you don’t know how much I needed this!!
I still can’t believe I saw Jeffrey Starr when I went to warped tour never met him but saw him in person which is insane
Another season with shane
Can we have another colab with Shane please
Quite a few are sold on Amazon. I’m only :56 seconds in but thought I would toss that out there.
This video is so salty 😬
What was up with the dude holding the briefcase and lurking around Jeffree? Lol!
For us who don't live in America, is this a cheap shop???
My sister has like everything from you even ur mirror and she loves you
I feel like jeffery and Manny MUA are hanging out again! So many times I was like omg Jeffrey sounds so much like him! Aww I need them to be besties again
Jeffery just didn't want the store to show up on the credit card that's why she got someone else to pay for it 😂
Idk if it’s just me but it almost sounded like he wanted Shane to be mad that their products were at the rack and almost like he kept switching up the entire video with being kinda being sarcastic and then overly happy about it . Idk it could just be a me problem 🤣
someone is really sad that they ended up in a depàrtment store
Hi growth, how are you 😍!
I love you so much, Miss Star. Love the positivity. <3
YES
This video rubs me off the wrong way, your introduction after a year and a half of hiding is to complain that your makeup is being sold at a cheap store. Both of haven’t changed and I think showing up to a shop for people who can’t afford full priced items, in a pink rolls Royce & Louis Vuitton speaks volumes. Y’all don’t realise half the world hates you both for valid reasons 😐
How did I not know this video was up until now?! So pissed! I've missed you both 🥰
They went to TJMaxx to die he went he went and thrived lol. I would bulk sell it off better to lose some money than $ than no coin at all. If it makes sense it makes cents and that makes money
Wow I can NOT believe the views are so low on this video. Haters seem to be slacking on their views and the fans don't seem interested in what's going on. What's up with that?!!
finally , it feels normal again
He left/moved ALREADY???!
Like how he's throwing some random jokes 9:38 9:52  And I can't wait for the Jeffree Star Approved video!! That's what got me subscribed to him! Can't wait
crazy to see this because i been rebinge watching the jeffree and shane series! 🖤🖤
Ofc its smart since your brand and smaller brands will get more money by reselling
I want the root beer one!
Im digging the good vibes.
Ranch dressing
We do miss Shane dawson
We miss you jefree
WHAT 🐿️ THE 🐿️ HECK 🐿️ BOI
Sanatarium
anyone notice how well jeffree is doing when she’s working with less ppl
I like this Jeffree🛐
Wait, shane and jeffree still talk????......
Dearest Jefree ☆, can you hook me up? I feel fat and ugly no matter what and i cant afford shit right now. ♡
Clickbait….gross
Jeffree Star and Shane have returned 🙌🏻 the world is restored
is the security guard recording since its just you three
Honestly, I’ve always had some sympathy towards Jeffree. Ik this is repetitive but nowadays it’s so easy to assume and believe what other people say. People love to stir up the drama and don’t notice how ridiculous they are. To most youtubers their belief is that success is revenge from your darkest past...that’s why they keep posting POSITIVE content. Lmao enough with my blabbering.
Everyone complaining that Shane wasn't in this video, the video is about his collab, so it's not click bait. It's funny how we do turn our nose up at some brands when we see them at these discount stores but I mean look at ABH, Becca, MAC, they are staples in these stores and they are classic lines.
Why would you buy it instead of letting others try it at a cheaper price?
Is it bad to have your makeup in a discount store? I know it's not selling directly from your site and putting the most profit back into your pocket but as the creator do you still get a cut of products profit that is sold at discount?
Jeffree I love you but you only seem to reply to comments that are YouTube verified:( 💜💜💜
guess some things stays <3
how f***ing beautiful is Jeffree Star??
You guys are still great entertainment! I’ll keep watching
Watches this video way too often already. Iconic duo!! Fuck all the negative people🖕🏻 i love you guys 👯‍♀️❤️
I feel like jeffree just seems a lot more real especially sitting on the couch and reflecting on the past he doesn’t sound so extremely sad and serious and sentimental, but also not making like way too many sexual comments and emphasizing a lot of words for no reason. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t think there is anything wrong with most of these but i do notice it kinda makes him more of a character if that makes sense? Like a caricature of himself. And this one just felt a lot more genuine and real. Maybe I’m just drunk i dont know.

I wish I could just bump into you in some store LOL
I got blood sugar in a mystery box and its the first ever from js, and I hate it, its not pigmented and the colors are stuck in the pan lol
I don't want to be weighed and I do not want my height measured.
When he grabbed the lipsticks it was satisfying lol
You really have grown as a person!! I've enjoyed watching your videos and seeing the growth...and I hope more videos like this are coming back to your channel!!
See ya at the rack! I CAN'T haha
The video started with Jeffrey being in shock and ended with him supporting the decision and encouraging others to go to Nordstrom to get it 😅
Jeffrey: "we're buying everything " 3 Doritos later.... she forgot her wallet  lol
“The rack” lmaooo
Who cares what you said. That’s you!Your funny as hell!💖✌🏼
I don't know how or why they have my stuff?....because nobody wanted to sell it anymore so it got sent to them. Simples.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Didn't he sell his house in LA?
Fan to Jeffree: “Have a great day” Jeffree: “Thank you”😌
Shane  needs to move on from this guy already. I was actually hoping they are not friends anymore.
Why did you buy your makeup back ?...now  your fans cant buy your makeup at Nordstrom’s  rack .
Damn, this is the best week so far.
Your so demonic
“Just picking the dog hair out of my mask” 😆😆 so fu€*ing relatable. 😂
okayyyyyy but why?
I had to go buy one of these at Nordstrom Rack!
No  you should donate to a Women’s Shelter or Back to Work Program for Women !!  There are so many different programs to send donations   I am sure the women would appreciate and love your products  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Not Jeffree buying a crazy amount of his products at a cheaper price and taking the opportunity from someone else to actually be able to finally afford it…. Nope not him …. ( sis we know you did that on purpose of course its very humbling to see your shit on the shelf in a clearance store. But you don’t need to buy multiples of each item. People like me would love to be able to finally be able to buy some but then you do this .. and I don’t know you just disappointed me again…)
Why did you buy the whole shelf of stuff. I feel like that’s just rude, just grab one of everything to check if its yours. Some people can’t afford your prices so having it cheaper helps them, so you just bought everything that other people could have. I’m sure you have tons of them. So why did you take it all? Did you not want it in stores all like that? I just find it kinda rude Jeffrey
Where is Shane!
cameraman did not do a good job after nordstrom >:(
Oh my god, her lipstick is in a shop. Lets all shit ourselves.
Love this vid !!
💜❤️
I love this growth ❤️ keeping it a 200% real. Love you Jeffree 💕
I live for this friendship.
Was it me or was this video shaky?
He’s always gonna support his friend as not a sneaky snake xx
I miss Shane 😔
So glad you are back and dominating!
this is embarrassing
Ew... Just ew...
my mom is a manager for the entire makeup and fragrance department at nordstrom so i’m wondering why is it such a big deal they’re selling your products at their store?
Does anybody ever tell you, you look like Kathleen Robertson from 90210… both beautiful 💕
I love the wyoming jeffree. Living for this energy ever since the move his energy hits way different.   Edit. I get that this isn't in wyoming i mean just his entire vibe is different since he moved he seems much happier.
OK for real who is filming now? I have to say I miss Christian.
I love that Jeffree always takes his viewers concerns to heart and clears up any misunderstandings or controversies like this surrounding his brand… and I also love that he donates SO MUCH of his unused PR and other makeup!! So awesome
Just so you guys are aware of the Youtubers that moved out of California by choice left because they’re not About that democratic life hahaha good for you!
I would be surprised too if I spoke down on others for their products in retail and now so are yours . Sounds a bit like karma
Jeffree does look good tho.
Love the way you handled this Jeffree
Nailed the Dog the Bounty Hunter hair.
hehehe bruhyoutuber
Im so fucking glad you are back making videos with Shane.  The Secret Life of Jeffree Star should have won awards...it was extraordinary.  The Conspiracy Pallette was historic and its sad you guys didn't get to bask in your achievement.  In true Jeffree and Shane fashion, yall regrouped and are back.  The amount of internal strength the two of you  have is inspiring.
Flops
Jeffree clearance star but at least you owned up to the hypocrisy
Why buy it all? You could have left the rest for others to buy, who maybe don’t have as much money?
So happy to see you with Shane 😍
What happened to him saying he was selling his house in LA and moving to Wyoming??
I'm happy the jeffree admits to his past mistakes and realized them and actually apologized. he's changing for the good. I don't see anything wrong with brand name products ending in racks, tj, Marshalls.
Jeffree is so gracious with his fans. I love watching him interact with the public.
We all needed that Shane & Jeffrey moment 🥰
I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS VIDEO OMG!!! 😱
Both you and Shane moving out of Cali was probably the best thing for both of you. I hope you are all happier and healthier out of the toxic environment.
♥️
Jeffree teased Shane in the thumbnail and with the phone call to see the reaction before Shane came back. Also Shane showed his face more on ryland's videos this week and people liked it.
Shaneee🥺🥺🥺 melts my heart seeing him omg. I miss Shane :(
Jeffrey and Shane back together?
Beautiful.❤🖤
Ur ratings r dropping what's going on
That weave is horrendous jeffree
You could donate it to a woman's shelter
Jeffree you look so much more filled out and healthy since that throwback video! Looking great girl!
jeffree if you ever need to throw out any old makeup send it to me expired or not used or not idc lol id have so much in all those luxury products id just dieee  lol
lol love this Jeffree looks amazinggg love that hair omg
Ugh gross
Apparently the big pallet was here in tkmaxx in the uk 🇬🇧 sold out so quick I didn’t manage to get my hands on it!  I love your eyeshadow pallets still using them now so no wonder they sold out so quick!
He might be a bad person but at least he wears a mask
I mean...Nordstrom isn't exactly the pits...
❤️💕
Omg I saw you the other day. I was too shy to say hi. But my eyes got flooded with tears. You don't know how much you have inspired me.
I miss Shane!
6:27 atleast he acknowledge what he said was rude and he need to humble his self because stuff being cheap like that is good for regular people to buy everyone cant afford no 28 dollar palette and 18 dollar lipstick so its a good deal when people find it in tj max ross and stuff
So when he buys his own make up do he get his money back sense its his product
Hi Jeffrey just wanted to know if you found peace in moving to Wyoming reason I ask is because where I live it’s very toxic and planing to move to find my peace
❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤
Before I watched the video I was like hmm could this be karma for making comments about other brands ending up in TJMaxx/Ross? After watching I really appreciate you taking accountability for the comments you made and also adding that you didn’t really realize that the companies do that to sell off overstock of something and it is actually smart business practice. Happy to see you growing and maturing so much as a person and a business owner. Glad you are so light hearted about this and not letting it get you or Shane upset, I mean why would it Conspiracy was like THE biggest makeup launch of all time!! ☺️

Yesssirrrrrr the colllaabababbaaabab‼‼
Jeffery Star you are not above anyone else get over it, also you seem to be laughing out of being nervous , Come back to earth
This would be such a fun mood though, buying JS cosmetics in a more relaxed retail environment. I hate buying makeup from proper makeup shops because I don't wear makeup (I'm a mua tho) so people treat me like a clueless idiot when I'm looking at products.
Oh hi good morning Jeffreeee
the fact i use my mothers makeup that she doesnt use anymore is kinda sad TwT
I've been missing you! You look stunning!!! ❤️❤️❤️
so they didn't actually address anything right?
Give the makeup to your local women ‘s shelter.
I liked you better when you were FAMOUS FAMOUS. I miss your music. You used to be so cool. You were a really good artist and I feel like if you had stayed in the game you would have been filthy rich and famous. It's not a secret that you like it 😏. Like you'd be set for life. I bring up your name to people and most of them were fans too. Please put out some more music 😫. I know all your songs by heart now because it's been so long. Bring the princess back! Js...I'd listen to it.....
Man, I want one of those Controversy Palettes with the green color 😢 I have the Conspiracy Palette which I love and cherish, but I couldn’t get the Controversy one, and then when they took out the second run with the green, i missed it all together because of my health, I can’t go to Nordstrom Rack myself, because I’m disabled and it would be a nightmare, so I’ve looked everywhere online, but I can only ever find people selling the original, not the second run with the beautiful green color 💔 Hopefully i can find one at a Nordstrom close to me, maybe I can have someone in my family go get it for me if I do manage to locate one, though now I’m a little discouraged that maybe they won’t give me the right info over the phone to send someone to go buy it for me 😞 Either way, thanks for the tip, at least now hopefully I have a chance of locating one, fingers crossed 🤞🏼
Hy i am from pakistan.. Never tried any of jaffrees makeup or any expensive makeup and maybe never gona try because cant afford it.. But i am soo much in love with jaffree star.. Man howww??
All your makeup belongs there, it's overpriced trash😂😂😂
miley is telling
so did frankie
kevin prudente for number one fashion designer
famous birthdays fine
we fucked
JEFFREE   THE CLAN
You look so healthy now ❤️❤️
I missed you Jeffree. I’m glad that you are growing and serving us. You are an icon and I hope you still embrace that ❤️❤️❤️
You are always queen period,idgaf.We live and we learn,you make the best products and have a beautiful unique personality.All is forgiven I'm tired and so beyond ready to move on.People are so whiny and crusty.I love you and look forward to you coming back out more.Baby you rock 24/7 the end 😍💖💯
Girll forgot her wallet 🤣🤣
Love LOVE how you stayed true to Shane❤️ Love him so much and your energy and both content together and separately! So creative and just the absolute queens 💋 so excited to see y’all in more videos together
Ha finally....the proof to the haters! Shane and Jeff are still besties....love this...cant wait!💓💗⚘
shoplifted items that people never got out of the store... go back on the sale racks
Ooof only 79k likes?
Finally these two together in a video, even if it was just a video call lol.
Love y’all and this keep going
since when was the camera so shakey o_o
But why would you buy all of it and not let your fans buy it At a discount?
Everytime i see a new Jeffree Star video she looks refreshed brand new
The floor is hella ugly lol
this video is a waste of time, its just jeffree being like " oh wow miss thing my brand is in nordstrom" and when he comes home just spills the makeup from the bag and does nothing with it. If you happen to read this before watching, save yourself the time.
I don’t believe he’s changed. It’s easy to fake it. He’s never cared about being cancelled, he too rich to really be effected by it anyway.
Omg no nails
Honestly, a lot of poorer fans only way of getting these products is when they're marked down like that. It's a positive. I don't wear makeup but if I did I wouldn't be able to pay full price.
Jeffree: "I'm donating some of this stuff to Goodwill"...   Me: Running to every Goodwill store looking for that Mini Controversy !!!
Awww I miss Shane so much!!
Love to hear from Shane!  You are always beautiful Jeffree!
Where is the Halloween mystery box launch?
No one caresssssssss
Male Leah Ashe be like:
I still love u jeffree star!!!! i love how much you have grown and know when to take accountability for your past mistakes!!! we are all human!!! You look so happy and healthy!!!!! that farm life is really doing wonders for u lol i love on a farm too love every min of it!!! #farmlife!!!
Omg pardon me...should have watched entire clip before I threw shade...it's Fri..day for goodness sake
Meow
I live for that wig. Giving 2009 VMA’s Gaga again 🔥
Was it your stolen merchandise . OMG could be an inside job.that blows
Are you gay boy do not wear makeup they stay wherever you're wearing wig I know you don't have eyebrows you getting roasted
Think I've gone deaf in this echo chamber of a comment section xD Glad most of y'all aren't therapists with all this 'so much growth' bullshit lmao
me seing her the first time- i she-he a boy?
You get paid the same no matter where they are sold I imagine - So, who cares! Nordstrom Rack will also give your line even more accessibility to the public! I've ALWAYS loved the formulation of your products! I don't see this as a bad thing. Great to see you back Jeffree! XO
Did you ever move or still thinking of mi I g up north since selling castle of a house?
Why is it a bad thing they are selling it?
Did you and Shane have a slice of that humble pie yet?
when are u going to colorado???? You know we are waiting for another shane collab
My father would like to know…”What the f**k happened to your eyebrows?” Not me, him.
I love how it would cost $67 to buy at least one or two of the pallates, but he got like 20 of them for the same price
I miss these videos!! And review videos!
Go Away Jeffree
i can't wait to see how fabulous jeffree will look when he's 100 years old
Please don’t ever stop posting again. You’re the only makeup youtuber that I can tolerate and watch for years now.
Hey it gives us poor folk a way to buy your product
I can't even express into words how happy this video made me... U finally look healthy & happy & like u found your center & I am here for it bc this is the jeffree we all love to see... Anyways hope u keep your mental health #1 & keep doing whatever u doing bc girl it is working ALL THE BEST TO U & SHANE & THE PUPS 🐕 LOVE U JUST KEEP DOING U 💝💝!!!
Love you so much 💕
Loving your humble vibe 😊
Why does that Nordstrom look like a shitty tj Maxx? Ew
Died. Then died again!! *squeals!!!*
Pagal
“Are you filming” is my fav lip shade ever!!!
Im going to unsubscribe now BECAUSE YOURE EVIL. After the michelle dy drama. This girl is just inspired to you. She even said sorry to you. When somebody told you to make a review on her make up, you replied that her make up is TRASH. She looks up to you but youre ungrateful. if other filipinos would see what you said on twitter, theyll probably unsubscribe. even your make up will be banned in the philippines. you said she imitated your make up approve segment. But didnt you forget that you all beauty gurus review the same makeup, nothin new. AND SHE CAME MANY MANY YEARS BEFORE YOU BECOME THE JEFFREE STAR. SHES BEEN 11 YEARS IN THE MAKE UP BUSINESS, AND IN YOUTUBE. So sad that I also idolize you because you showed us your from rags to riches story. How can we be inspired when youre not even nice to us. time will come, God will take away the blessings he gave you and you will return to the sewers.
The cameraman's hand shaky. Still, love you  Jeffree!
This channel is dying out I miss the old Jeffrey 😫😭
HE NEEDS TO STOP.  YOUR SHIT IS ALSO AT ROSS, MARSHALLS AND TJMAX.
This is the first time I’ve seen jeffree without long nails and it’s creeping me out 😂
I honestly wish Shane could’ve had his happy moment after the palette a little longer... It’s not cool to wish bad things on people.
This is proof money fixes everything...
Beautiful
Rather then donate the make up to thrift sites, instead donate to women's shelters. Esp to places that help battered women. Also highly recommend donating to any places that help the marginalized lgtbq community. It will do so much to help build a person's confidence who may not otherwise be in a position to afford good make up.
Can you and Shane do a series about your ranch please god
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Donate it to our Goodwill Jeffery. CENTRALIA ILLINOIS ? I'd BE IN LINE
I wanna go to the Goodwill Jeffrey donates to.
Your a giant hypocrite ! Funny how when others were being sold in discount stores it was shameful but now you are it’s not a big deal lol …. And it’s all your makeup not just Shane’s
Really 10$ isn’t a good deal um it’s a lot better then 18$
Legitly do not understand this backstock situation...I tried so hard to get my hands on this collection and failed with dying colors.
it makes me happy because of the people who can't afford the price point that you set which isn't too bad can now afford your beautiful products. I watch your reveals of your new lines and wish i could afford to get any one of your products but bills be eating my moneys...
Not gonna lie. I was disappointed with the click bait. I wanted to see both of you
Oh please just horrible acting nothing but a faked up video just like your tacky thumbnail!
Wish I found it at a discount store near me. On a side note I'd see it as a sign if success really. At least where I live the kind of products that wind up in these stores tend to be well known and popular
My favorite duo back ❤️
This he-she-it-whateva.. is such a disaster, there is NO PLACE TO BEGIN. And which elephant do you choose to address today???
Dude is anyone else having bots comment on their comment? Every post I’ve made to Jeffreys channel (up to a year old) are getting commented on by BOTS!  We know that’s you jeff
Racks to Ranches
Please, can i ask for help ? Any amount will be a big help to my family. Thank you very much.
Jeffree buying his own makeup, and pretending to be surprised, and doing an "investigation" as why Nordstrom Rack is carrying his makeup for a discount is really fucking pathetic. Nobody wants your fucking makeup, dude.
Plzz hlp me
Glad you are doing better and you can totally tell. I smiled through the whole video. You look gorgeous as always!
I love that you and Shane have become great friends and I’m happy for you both
Hey, Pls do some House tour  PLS..........
I miss Shane
Yuhhhh
im not surprised lol
LMAOOO I love Jeffree he always makes me laugh.
yall are menaces
I see all of you suddenly just magically forgot about Shane's past. Y'all are just forgetful I guess 🙄🤢🤡
Loser
"Hype" is the first word that comes to my mind when I watch the video. I see people getting that "hype" everyday... on the street.
Shane just posted today on his channel!!!! Im so happy!!!
jeffree said: my make ups all being sold at a more affordable price let me buy it all so people who couldnt afford it before still cant
girl... the wig... 😩☠️
Wow you look so much healthier, keep growing and keep going!

Thank you for setting an example and wearing your mask. At this point, that consideration is really all I’m looking for.
BOUGHT IT ALL so no one who cant afford your stuff could ever have it. WOW. You are incredibly out of touch. I work FUCKING HARD every damn day, and literally have to hope against hope that I might find things like this at Marshall's and you go hoover it up with your millions of dollars. Thanks
Jeffree...so do u still get any $$$ from any of the units sold to Nordstrom Rack and the other places? ❤️ Seeing u and Shane again #friendsforever
People still hate Shane, and Jeffree Star is a hustler, a brilliant business man who reinvents himself again and again even going all the way back to the streets of Hollywood in L.A., MySpace, and his music career. Props!
jeffrey:we’re going to nordstom rack   the subtitles: WeRe GoIng tO nOrThErn IrAQ
Wait till you see your stuff in tj max for $10 LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
I love the fact that you did this video!
What goes around...
Hi Jeffrey, I haven’t watched you in a while and this video was striking to me as a healthcare professional because I can tell that you have some stiffness/arthritis in your neck since your accident. If this wasn’t due to fracture (and hence the result of bone fusion when it healed) you might want to have chiropractic and massage to loosen that tissue and get it healthy again. Take care!
I wish Shane was in this video😫
Buying your own products LMFAOOO
“It’s jus me, him and a security guard… 3sum?” I love u Jeffree 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
What is cancel culture and why did it happen?
Lastima que estoy en Costa Rica 🇨🇷 😜 si no hubiera aprovechado
I’m just happy to see u doing YouTube videos again, feels like ages x
You guys need another makeup line but now a farm line. Lol
I remember when the Conspiracy collection launched. It was crazy. I loved the series and I did buy the main palette.
How can a human being be so fabulous???! Love him! 👽
💓💓💓
I love this duo
Few months....its been what feels like years since we have had consistent makeup reviews from this channel. :-/
Girl I’m still stuck on $67 like for all the product… not bad 👀
Jeffree: "it's just me boom, and a security gaurd. The cameraman: 💧👁👄👁💧
Yesss much ❤️
I work at Nordstrom Rack and was surprised to see it at our store. 😂
the transphobia in the comments is unbelievable
He acted like he found his shit sold at Dollar tree😏😏😏 in $6000 slippers no less😂😂😂
Bad
I have watched you over the years and it truly warms my heart to see how much you have grown as a person.  I love your make up and my cheap ass will sometimes wait for a sale but I love the quality.  Anyway with all your trials and tribulations I am happy to see you live your best life and you look healthy.  Stay fabulous!!!
hearing the clip of the music from the series brought me BACK
Hey keihls is good shit
Am i the only one who does not believe Jeffree didn't know the make up was sold to discount stores?  I'm confused - wouldn't he know where is make up goes??
It’s amazing to see you happier on screen, the peace in Wyoming looks good on you.
Girl I would have acted the same way if one of my friends of 10 years started talkin $hit about me. I’d be pretty pissed too lol
I love the wig choice for this vid. Gives me strawberries and cream vibes. And like always is laid to filth
Well, it’s clear evil can’t be killed that easily.
Why would you buy it so your fans couldn't get them?
Jeffery thinks he’s so cool 😂😂 so embarrassing
Good for you, i thought you were going to be pissed at them selling your product. Also ahh i miss Shane's videos, he needs to come back to youtube x

LOVE U GUYS ..YASS QUEEN CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW VIDEOS ❤️
People still watch them 💀
Thank you for this video~ you took the time to investigate and explain. I see so much healing that has taken place and i am happy for it. Looking back is never easy but you did it with maturity and composure.🤗❤✌ much love to you
Yesssss I can’t wait!!! I have become a super fan in the last month you’re and amazing person and entrepreneur love it 💕💕💕🥰🥰🥰
Abomination.
I missed Shane so much.
That all staged,  Jeffrey star crap 💄 up..attention defeaset
While im in depression every time i watch ur videos it makes me feel happy God bless youu dear 💖
Jeffree you have grown as a person SO much. I love this version of you, the positivity shines through 💖
I stopped watching a long time ago. WE GET IT. You're rich. You LOVE YOURSELF. YOU ARE OBSESSED WITH THINGS. YOU HAVE A GIANT EGO. You are not above anybody except for your wealth. I hope this humility serves you well.
WE DONT LIKE SHAYNE STOP TRYING TO BRING HIM BACK, HES IRRALIVANT AND OF CORSE HIS STUFF WOULD BE ON SALE NOONE LIKES HIM ANYMORE THATS NO BIG SHOCKER
ew
I love how much uve grown as a person!!@ ive met u once at an AFI concert .I love u jefree  l
Novympia did you better
Missed Shane! Glad he’s doing well!
everyone here is a lost soul who needs help.
❤
Totally unrelated but I want to know if Jeffree is thinking about getting a horse!!  For keepsies obviously, not to ride it once get bored and sell it ksdjnfskjd (totally made a Grinch reference there, but I'm serious xD)
I have always dreamed of walking in a Jeffree ⭐ store. Can you please make my dreams come true. I would love to see them in hot cities like, LA, Hollywood, Nashville (me), Tampa, Miami,  Dallas, Fort Worth, New York City, And more
Good reminder that KVD told us that he was a 🐍 all those years ago, but we didn't listen to her.
:)
His makeup is at all of our TJ Maxx and Marshalls here too up in Boise Idaho!!
💝😍YOUR HAIR IS SO BEAUTIFUL😍YOU ARE A GODDESS👑😍💝
damn!!! my nordstrom rack  beauty area don;t look nothing like this...wtf????
your nails....where are they??
I was only here for Shane 😭
Well duh, EVERYTHING from the top eventually trickles down ...
is this in your la home? i thought you were selling it?
OH MY GOSHHHHHHHHFISJSJASJAJANABSBSB YESSZSZZSNDJSKSKSKKWKW I'M FREAKING
“See you at the rack” sent me😂
Jeffree giving me Alien vibes ♥️
I am kinda happy its at these stores for other folks who want to buy the product at a discounted rate can! its nice for all income types to enjoy this! Why not <3 thank you for sharing!
I just got some Jeffrey star pallets at Ross here in Tulsa Oklahoma.they were only $20 each
Jeffree why dont you open your own store front that way you could control everything. Also you could ask other people who have created make up and put their stuff in your store as well.
Wow your so amazing! im your avid fan...from philippines!❤
I see a lot of growth here. I hope to fall in love with your content again. And I hope Shane comes back with accountability and growth as well
people that actually watch this wow bye
Why does he seem confused about why it's in a discount store? Shit came out years ago
I used to work at a Nordstrom Rack. We have a wide variety of companies we accept returns from so we tend to get some brand items or large named items that otherwise would never be there but we are required to reshelve them and at a marked-down price. I once found your palette in my store (as a manager) and took that for myself as quick as I could.
Is it bad I have always thought the statement “Tj Maxx is where my friends go to die” is hysterically funny.
Glad for a normal video! Hopefully he releases more content and not just new promos. 😇
So nice to see you chilled and genuinely happy!
i love this duo
“See you at the rack” 💀😂
We love the growth 🥺💗
Help, is he selling the LA house or not?
It's been so long since I've seen a video of you. It seems like you're doing a lot better!! I haven't felt this type of energy from you in so long. 🖤
I was just thinking we haven't seen the dogs in a while! 🐶💖
It was sooo good to see Shane!!!! I love y’all’s friendship!
:)
i miss this kind of content from you!!. maybe u can guest shane once more and do a friendship update!! iloveyouu!!!
JEFREE goes dumpster diving ! That’s old crap iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Remember when he said Marshall’s, Ross, TJ Max is where brands go to die 😂
lol that's what happens when you make fun of other people's makeup ending up in Marshall's and shit
Make a palllete called "Accountability "
Please  DO NOT DONATE TO GOODWILL..Donate it to some charities but not there. Sorry but i really have issue with any place that takes donations from ppl & turns around & takes the stuff they are GIVEN to help ppl & sales it. Some of the stuff they price is ridiculous... I dont like goodwill and have no respect for that  place
She flopped
Its like looking into a crystal ball huh?
i jus wanna see a new shane conspiracy vid
I love you and Shane sooo much 💕
What’s funny is it is it oh and a mini controversy to even be at the Nordstrom love you girl glad you’re back home more at least like by weekly
I'm sorry but that TJMAXX video was my FAVORITE!!!!! iconic
i literally saw this video and clicked so fast haha
Very uncomfortable vibe when he sees his own at a discount store compared to when he saw the people he disliked😅😅😅
We all learn and have greater perspective as we go along in life. Keep growing Jeffree it looks good and it feels good.
Hi Jeffery
Not Jeffree pretending that the Conspiracy collection isn't discounted on hIS OWN WEBSITE 😂😂 if you're discounting it how do you expect other companies not to???? 😂 Also this is hella snobby. Not everyone is rich hun.
I miss Shane soooo much 😭
I saw your products in tkmaxx uk, specifically the shane dawson collection
im sarting to dislike  louis vuitton  pretty much xD
Also how did you not know about the clearance stuff. But when someone stole from you, somehow you csi’d where they were before it became news. Jeffrey gurll your kvding mamaaa not the tea
Is it me or has youtube been hiding you
💖💖💖💖💖 Jeffree Star 💖💖💖💖💖
He said clearance and I thought TJ Maxx or Burlington 😭 Nordstrom is luxury to me
u’re really gon make 13 minute long videos now? 💀💀💀
Superstar
I’m glad you and Shane are still friends there was rumours saying you guys weren’t
Please stop working with Shane
your makeup is on clearance because less and less people want it.
https://youtu.be/V7rdPrOt6kI
You cant just put shane in the thumbnail and not have him in the video 😤
I appreciate this video. Him loving his own products and being proud of it still is amazing. This is why I buy his makeup because the product is good
Didn't you say goodbye on your last video? Wtf are you a magician 🎩? Pop out ya hat? 😆🤣
Review Jade x Beauty Bay pallette!!!
So Shane moved to Colorado... isn't that where Ryland's family lives?
Yaaaay I love videos with you and shane
Oh so Shane’s not in this video?
FYI Jeffree!! Stop setting with your feet and legs folded behind you, like your setting on them. My cousin at 38 years old died from a blood clot in his leg from setting like that.It went from his leg to his heart and killed him instantly... The doctors said it was from him folding his legs up under  him and setting on his feet, like you do.!!!  STOP !!  Love ya beautiful !!  ❤❤
We don't want Shane to come back
Jeffree… look at it this way.  NOW you have people buying your product who either never heard of it or couldn’t afford it and now that they tried it and love it and have to have it you have new clientele who will now seak out your brand
Awww I miss Shane 🥺🥺
Extremely happy to see you both & I wish you all the best . Love this journey for us 🔥❣️
Wow this is great promo and opportunity for anyone who hasn't tried it due to cost. Love you Jeffree. T.M.I. I get off to your voice.
Luv your hair!
I want them :(
That was such clickbait like I wanted them to be in person… over FaceTime which Shane didn’t really be showing either?? Like what the fuck
Boom "see you next time"... Like he shops there daily I love him 😂
Omg shane 🥺🥰missed you  ♡♡♡
Wow
Man's voice...
I love how all the commentary channels made this out to be some bigggg ass deal and Shane was in the video for all of 30 seconds.
Shane and jeffree suck, anyone else agree?
Shane moved? Can't afford that house anymore? 👀
No one Jeffrey: it's just me him and the security guard 👀 threesome Just kidding   😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
Love you guys!
Omg its in Nordstrom?omg finally i can semi afford it i wanna goo
This was such a pleasant video! More like this please!!!
Love you babe! You look so beautiful 😍 💗
I'd honestly like the vid if Shane wasn't there
Been watching since a while back and your intro has gotten more “ professional “ . I love you tho. Always the realest..
Jeffree, I'm so glad you're back. My best friend in THE WHOLE world was 100% your biggest fan.. he passed away 3 years ago and I have SO many awesome memories of he and I talking shit and binging your videos. You ALWAYS manage to rise above the negativity and you're ALWAYS unapologetically JEFFREE STAR. No matter what, you'll ALWAYS have my support 💕🖤
😄 beautiful
thank you for wearing a mask
Jeffree: "I'm going to Nordstrom rack" My subtitles: " I'm going to northern Iraq."  Me: "i'm sorry.. what now?' 😂😂
I love his vibe! His laugh reminds me of Pauly shores laugh 😝 I say this with love ☺️
Wow morphie did you dirty…screw them.
is it me ore in the beginning it looked like vibrators
Y’all still supporting this guy…
Shane is such a chicken shit, this is how he tests the waters...a staged phone call from Jeffree.
Why all the thumbs down?!
Some nerve!!
DO THE REVIEW ON THE SOUR PATCH KIDS X MORPHIE PALLET!!! PLEASEEE!!!💖💖💖💖
I wish instead of buying it, you would have signed them and left them for someone to discover.
“Threesome! No just kidding” has me DEAD byeee ☠️
My little pony vibe
No plastic bags, Jeffree.
Nordstrom Rack is still expensive for me 🤣🤣
I only clicked on this video because of Shane Dawson's face.
7:02 I felt that one when you said your best friend of 10 years backstabbed you on the internet. Since I got all of that money from you many people targeted me and used me basically throwing me under the bus on IG. It hurt because I always helped the best way I could with this said person and they broke my heart by lying on me on social media. No matter how many times it runs in our minds we will never be able to make sense of things that others do to hurt us.
👍💯🙏👏👑
I am loving this look on you Jeffree. Love you ❤️
Why not have your products in ulta or sephora? That would be the best
Nordstrom is still expensive to me 🤣
I wanted to see more Shane ✋🏻🥺🤚🏻
Can you try Makeup by Mario's Master Metal Manipulator
Karma
Love you Jeffree 💙
Are y’all surprised you see the make up at those places 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
All the comments being positive is suspicious 🤨
That silver outfit looks like something people wore in the 80s to sweat off the pounds. Lol
Hey Jeffree, if you wanna kindly donate that makeup to moi… I wouldn’t be opposed 😂😭
Dude after that scandal your lucky its on clearance
Walmart Jeffrey Epstein
SHANES COMING BACK
I’m just so happy! Shane and Jeffree reunited and filming! Ahhhhh! I can’t wait! ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭
Spent 28 dollars and like 52 dollars on palettes from people that suck. The colors are pretty so if I could've gotten it cheaper- I wouldve
SHANE!
xoxo
but why buy all the products?
I’d love to happen upon this in a Nordstrom rack..
This is a lil gay
I missed this dynamic duo so much. Like I with I could find the words. I hope you're both doing well and thriving 💗
the Jeffree we've all been missing.
"It's only me him and a security guard"    *camera man sits in silent* ....
I feel like time and time again Jeffree will talk abt how he can’t believe he was like that before and he’s sorry. But he always does something worse. Yes he is human but he just never fails to surprise me with his actions. That’s just and observation and obviously I don’t know him just what I see online
I’m sorry but who wants to see Shane. Nobody?? Just me?
Some people couldn't afford it from other stores. Now you are stopping someone from getting it for $14... That's fucked up. I hope you donate everything you bought
Why is he buying it?? Let someone else enjoy it... wtf
Will you & Shane do another makeup launch idea together? I just think you two are the perfect combo. Lots of life experiences similarities, the friendship is definitely there. I would love one more! 🖤♥️
HOW CAN JEFFREE PULL EVERYTHING OFF? LIKE ANY COLOUR? HOW?
I’m gonna go to NR , ASAP !!!  There was a store in Miami for Jeffrey products but not anymore. And I love them !!!!  🌹 I wish to see your AMAZING cosmetics in Miami , again !!!!!
truly someone who can really pull off an apology that really isn’t an apology at all but uses the “apology” as an opportunity to reiterate how you really still feel. pur
Doesn’t know why it’s in the store lol……. Simple answer…
Yeah just not feeling this shit anymore.
I still support Jeffree , you can tell he just wants to do better and forget . He seems wayyy happier too 💕
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 22" This world is one big lie, it's all scripted out, day after day!
Respect how you brought up old versions of yourself and genuinely admit when you were wrong or regret saying something.. it shows you have grown as a person. Love you Jeffrey!
Such an icon!
Roll the series 😂😂
Dude!!!!! I must say you look so facking happy!! The energy and just pure joy coming from you is so contagious, and just made me smile from ear to ear. Keep on keeping on!!
Really wanted to see more Shane and Jeffree.
Is this in his old house?
I'm so glad to see you two together and still best friends. Love you and so glad you're bringing out some videos together. Thank you for sharing this video x
Can't wait to see more of Jeffree Star approved videos! 🤩💜💜
I wish you could still get these in the UK. I still really want Are You Filming? and the mini palette with Put It Back
أنت بنت لو ولد
My love for Jeffree is ETERNAL.  You have grown so much!!!!! xoxoxoxoxoxo
المتشبهون بالنساء ملعونون⁦(+_+)⁩
honestly, never been a huge fan, but i respect the transparency here.
This is what I want to watch. Thank you!
Watching your video at 2:22 a.m. in Seoul Korea 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷 😅
Been watching Jeffery since the beginning. It’s amazing that he has kept all the fun and pleasant stuff of his personality and matured in all the best ways.
Despite what some people will think, I think it's great that he and shane are still friends :)
Am I the only one excited for Shane's comeback???! 🤩🤩
How??? Wholesale??
So happy to see a video!!!
I miss Jeffree and Shane together!!! Can't wait to see more videos of them again soon! <3
RIP mayne 😑 thanks for replaying his old vids y'all
Funny how they only had the Shane, ryland, and Andrew lipsticks 👀
Why the fuck was this in my recommended. I couldn't care less about this shit.

I love that they stayed friends.
I love jeffree also hearing Shane's voice makes me happy
I think it's great that your makeup is going to some people that can't afford it. Girl this girl is going to tjmaxx everyday praying we get some.  I know it takes money from you and for that I feel bad. But this way others get to try your makeup. I love you and I love Shane keep up the great work. Shane I can't wait for your big come back.
But the GROWTH QUEEN!!💛💛
Iconic
Love seeing his growth and actual humility
What are you?
"Do you have your wallet on you??" 💀💀💀
It’s funny how how he always blame all his friends but himself

Hey, where you're in You should do a make-up called Wild Bunch after the History of the original Wild Bunch!!
❤️💖❤️💖❤️💖❤️
I mean.. it’s better than being at TJMaxx???? lol
I’m so confused about why is this shocking? Did everyone get amnesia? Oh well should make for some new drama this fall.
Waiting for people to say the conversation with Shane was fake or for likes.. 😒  But we know the truth, we love you!  Mrs. Hamm 🐷
Jeffreee I want the brand new closet tour 😁 but so sad your leaving your house. 😔 Btw I'm happy that your back😊
Fire ur wig colorist they did ur wig a little dirty
I miss these type of videos
I love the hairrrrr!
you belong in a clearance store
I haven’t watched or followed Jeffree or Shane in a while, but it really looks like Jeffree is doing so much better now. I hope he is feeling as healthy as seems to be in the video. Everyone deserves a chance to learn and grow from their past mistakes. Keep up this positive vibe, Jeffree! It looks good on you. 💕
1 minute in questioning the hair, not hating it, and just hoping he’ll mention the TJ Maxx.❤️
This is actually a good thing. Some people only shop at these sort of stores, so you are picking up a whole new section of customers that are going to discover your products.
💩💩💩💩
Im excited to see you and Shane in Wyoming and in Colorado.
Jeffrey star arrested in Hollywood https://youtu.be/8B58nxWsFi8
Weirdo freak
KARMA
Can we see ur new closet pleasee
i missed y shane
You know what... I obsessed with this whole new Jeffrey Star honey... I mean your character is much more sweet!!! Love you boo
Shit I would’ve bought it ! 😂💗
THEY ARE BACK
he really said “y’all not doing this”
Clearance Store????!!! Nordstrom Racks!!!
You do know this is equivalent as “Dancing with the Stars”… sorry, but who cares
Miss you.  Watching you in this video makes me miss your personality, your bein and your confidence!  You should think about being in film.  I think you would be Great on the Big screen.  You could play you! Your a character and definitely an Original. Continue to stay Happy, see the good in things,keep your eyes open and pray. This world is a crazy place 🙏🏽
Wait how are there no hate comment at all
This is getting old...
Look at the haters! 11k!! Lol pathetic sad people
True friends stick together forever.🥰
I'm so glad you and Shane are still friends!!!!
Can I just say I’m soo glad Shane and jeffree are still besties 💜💜💜💜💜💜
This is an ironic account, right?
I can tell Jeffree has matured and does a nice job explaining everything and apologizing for past overreactions, humbleness is a virtue and we all are growing
I feel like jeffree could really profit from find friends that aren’t in this socialite lifestyle, ya know the common normal person. I think it’d be refreshing 🤷🏻‍♂️
8:37 let's give a clap to that.... congrats!!! :)
yasss can't wait for you and Shane!!! I miss the reviews too!!!! will wait!
Can I just work for you already!!!!
Shane for sure doing another palette with Jeffrey!
Yeah let the good vibes flow because your going to be ok .
I think it would be wonderful to find a few of jeffery star products in a store...im interested in his cosmetics but don't know what I want or need and have just not taken the leap, but if I could fine a few nice pieces in a store I would definitely purchase there first. 💗
No one cares.
Where is shane he was the thumbnail
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER.

Lol going to the rack.
Am I the only one that was TRIGGERED by Jeffree having his “assistant” buy the $200 worth of makeup @ Nordstrom’s Rac??? I mean he/she is worth (net) $200 MILLION DOLLARS! If your entire purpose is: to SHOP for something, you bring your MONEY! Right???!!! 🙄
Adding shane in it for views. Nice Jeffree 👀🙄
literally just clicked the vid for the whip thumbnail. nice.
Miss Jeffree don't u have apple pay or something like that LOL
you are the monster under my bed you are the next holloween movie jeffree the killer lol thats all please leave YouTube.
Jeffree has changed so much 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
I miss you and Shane ));
WHERE IS SHANE DAWSON
LA Native here that was in the WeHo MM Community. Now, I just want you to sing in the underground scene again. I miss you on stage.  Stay Gorgeous. Smooches, Jude Melroses
That wig is not it
You look healthy:) I hope you’re well!
Wait.. where is shane?? I came to see him. :(
Damn literally paid for it twice !
This is wild! I just saw the mini controversy palette at Nordstrom in Michigan last week and was shook!
I like how Nordstrom is considered a clearance store I’m too broke to even walk in Nordstrom😂
Yeesssss!!! Jeffreeeeee! 😍
Looks: confusing Personality: weird Gender: probably not existent, (he a man)
I miss you and Shane !!! So excited for future vids 🥰🥳
UGH cant stand SHANE! 🤮 Just like James Charles, EVERYTHING about him is annoying!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU THOUGH
What is this channel
what was the point in him buying it....
this is literally so embarrassing for you lmao
Clicked on video, paused, disliked.
how the f do you sit like that - you young thing you
You should’ve left some for everyone else 😭😭😭
lmao whyd he buy it all tho
I need just videos of Shane and jeffree
Nasty
THE HAIR IS BACK
JEFFREEEE
Is it possible I could have some of these
U seem like u need company 💓 u should have me over
Love how he sources the tea before anyone else has some dumb shit to say. Love u jeffree we can see your growth 💜
Jeffree! That wig is everything!
HOW YALL GET A BLUE BOFA CARD
💜
Wtf?! Damn YouTube suggests
omg love this jeffree have so missed your vlogs and so happy they back now yay
I love Jeffree but that wig is not it sis. Jeffree’s stylist was off their game with that one.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Ooof I'm sorry but this just doesn't sit right w me. He literally took everything that was being made more easily available to those who can't afford. And why was this happening? Bc brands dropped Jeffree due to his own actions. He couldn't sell out anymore. So stuff went on sale. Imagine the audacity it takes to still be entitled to that money to the point where you clear it from the shelves of any other retailers. What the actual hell is going on I thought he was busy on his yak ranch🤣
JEFFREE WE MISSED YOU
Eww. Looking like something out of a horror movie 🤮 Back monster! Back!
I miss Shane so much 😭
Damn I would kill to be FaceTimed by Jeffree Or Shane.
the filming 😭😬
Oh since you went there to die let's flip it it to I was hurt 🙄
love you shane!!!!
omg is that sh*ne 🤢🤮
I missed videos like this!!!!
I love this. I miss shane and you !!
You are dude or girl?
We stan a humble queen.
Would have loved to see Shane in this too💜
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
اعزذ اله من شيطان الرجيم
AT LEAST IT WASN'T FOUND AT THE 99 CENT STORE!!!💰
Uggghhh
Shane Dawson was in this thumbnail, didn’t see him in the video except for that brief FaceTime. Jeffree has mastered the art of click bait.
Shaneeeeeee ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ awwwww I missed my baby bear sosoo muchh!!!!
Loved seeing this !!! YouTube getting back to normal 💖💖💖
Love that you included that clip 🤣
I can’t believe anyone would watch this crap. Pathetic. Grow up.
Wow these comments have been censored hardcore 😭
I found that palette and other JSC products at Nordstrom and you know what... I bought every one of them. When the cashier asked why I told the girl because I love Jeffree's products and I support him. That line is my FAVORITE. I have 7 of the Mini Controversy and 4 of the Conspiracy palette. Love you Jeffree!! ❤💜
I haven’t watch any of your videos in a year so I’m kinda excited 😜
I think it’s ironic 😂
Cancer and Scorpio friends till the end
I love crossover episodes! Love seeing your smile.
nice video
I hate the shaky hands that filmed this lol
The only make up he need is a gag with a papper bag
Aren’t discount stores where your friends go to die? RIP JEFFREY STARRRRRR! 😂😂😂
I never got my hands on those I’m on my way to get them ☺️🥲
Remember when you said TJ Maxx is where all your ex friends goes to die? How does it feel seeing your collection sold at TJ Maxx now? 😂
I want Nordstrom rack is a clearance store money.
I thought he was in Wyoming lol
They had it in our local uk tk maxx a few months ago
Buy shiba inu
The quality of her makeup has gone down according to many many reviews I've seen...
Yay, it’s 2019 again.   it’s good seeing top tier ppl back David, Shane, & Jeffa
She sounds stuffy. Aren't you supposed to stay in if you have any symptoms until you're tested? Apparently money = not having to follow rules or recommendations..hmm
Hmm… Trending, huh? I’m guessing the sensible people’s words have been snapped away… Typical.
I just cant watch this, I dont think they will ever recover
Love that Shane and Jeffree are still best friends ☺️
missed ur vids, glad ur back, i loved that collection, luckily i was able to get the palette and the lipgloss <3
Are they deleting the bad comments lol
But he gonna buy all of it 👀 I also bought the brushes they were the best and I used Mac brushes
Love love love the hair!!!! So glad you are feeling better!!! #doyouboo
Jeffree has changed so much since he took a break and spent some time in Wyoming away from the craziness. So proud
Jeffrey- buys his own makeup 🤣 this energy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Finally! Yay!!!! So happy to have you back on here!
Talking down about Nordstrom like its a cart outside skid row, shame. Let's lift up our awesome community! Be funny, or informitive not degrading n condescending. People put u where u are n falls are quicker than climbs gurl.
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.🆗
i wounder why shane isnt posting on his channel anymore like i get he moved but likes his subcribers want to know how hes doing .
🤮
Why?  Because the both of you were cancelled.
This is the most disgusting human I have ever seen
😍🥰😍🥰
JEFFREE STAR IS WORTH 200 MILLION DOLLARS AND HE ASKED SOMEONE ELSE TO PAY FOR THE MAKE UP ???I HATE PEOPLE THAT LOVE TO FORGET THEIR WALLET AT HOME ..AVOID THIS FRIEND AT ALL COST
Dude u must delete this channel for all goods on planet...
I used to work at Nordstrom rack and they don't accept used makeup, but people are trashy and will try stuff on and leave stuff opened and not buy it
“It’s just me, him and a security guard… so threesome” lol
These comments are so filtered lmaoo
You go girl or whatever you are
Ugh i can’t stand shane. He’s the fakest of the fake 🤢🤮
What is the point of this video?? And why does jeffree sound like Nik dragon 😏
Jeffree always has a front when he does something wrong. he’s always sorry again and again and continues to do what he does. y’all are just being manipulated 💀
On the Bright Side those are lower and more affordable prices... So, I can afford to get more products. I spent money I didn't have on the Conspiracy Pallet and was SO SAD that I couldn't afford anything else. Now I just have to find a Nordstrom near me. 🙃
not you acting like Nordstrom rack isn’t equivalent to TJMAXX 💀
ppl need JESUS
Aww I miss Shane
"See you at The Rack."  That's hilarious Shane <3
Wait, isn’t that the guy who molested his cat??
Who all clicked cuz they saw Shane on the thumbnail 😭
Jeffree only going up from here🤩 like to be strong enough to sit w ur dark shadow side and want to change is something I’m currently going thru as well & is not easy at all !!
Shanes public career should end
Shane is not forgiven
💝💐
But products from Jeffree Star Cosmetics alone have been showing up in these stores, right? Like the non-collabs. What’s the explanation for this?
lol at how it's sad to have your product in a discount store until you found your own product in one and now it's "smart business"
But miss thang that’s my name in your store, pump your breaks 😂😂😂 loves it. SoOoO Over the moon to see you glowing again, our Queen is back 💖💋
It not only the Lord that moves in mysterious ways, seems the YouTube algorithm does some weird shit too!
It's not IRONY!! ITS KARMA!
Jeffree star is the absolute worst
Glad to see you’re BACK!!❤️
I can feel your new positive vibe and it's really made me feel warm from the good old day of you and Shane. Looking forward to seeing your skincare line since I was a skincare nerd. Love from a Cambodian subscriber ❤️
Girl who colored that wig 🤨🤨🤨🤨 they need to be fired lol
I'd also like to mention a few months ago I found your lipstick (Sweet Tooth) that you released back in 2017/2018 at a store here in Canada called Winners. 🇨🇦. (They are the equivalent to Marshalls and Ross) I paid only $ 5.99 for it. I haven't seen anything yet or at the Nordstrom Rack up the road from my place but I will keep my eyes open this month    I love you Jeffree 💋
So no one is going to talk about Jeffree’s tired ass wig? Don’t even get me started with that decor and track suit. Like damn, money can literally buy anything but that doesn’t mean it should
Khusra
“Roll the clip” That music for a split second gave me chills. Remembering what life was like in that moment OHMYGOD
I’ll be a JS fan regardless,till the day I die, but I want to say your growth is visible and your glowing !✨☺️
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Sorting by new is literally like:  “Where’s Shane I miss him so much💞🤞😢” “You should fucking suffer”
🙄
why youtube recommended this is beyond me, i wish i could dislike more. you are both awful
Whoever the camera person is now is not good😖
I fast forwarded to find Shane and he wasn’t in it so for this reason I’m out
Who else clicked for Shane?
weren't you making fun of makeup ending up in discount stores 😭 now you're so excited
Two racists living their best fucking lives. Fucking suffer. Both of you.
What!? Jeffrey taking accountability without it being a massive scandal and millions of people demanding an explanation!? Girl who are you!? Love this for you.
I was super excited to be able to get the entire conspiracy pallette. Was always sold out. Seen Rich Lux vid about Rack & went next day! Happiness!
Funny how jeffree only "GROWS" when he's been cancelled, but when he's mean to everyone doesn't bat a eye
After everything he's been through in his life, and the amount of GROWTH, he deserves to be exactly who he wants to be and how he wants to be it, LIVE Jeffree ❤️❤️
I came for my crumb of Shane and left empty bellied :(
nil I don't get why Jeffree would buy his own make up like think of the potential new customers that may see it and decide to buy it but now can't or fans that otherwise can't afford regular retail prices aren't able to now purchase that make up. great video but the potential lost consumer wise is a little sad :(
Why am I never lucky enough to find the good stuff.
This is entertainment? It's like watching Chef Boyardy at The grocery store lol.
Actually this is a good thing it's happened to you because people that may not ordinarily go to your website and buy your makeup will try it and love it and will become big fans of it now.
I can’t wait to see Jeffrey and Shane do another video!
you're nasty
Nothing will ever change. Pathetic
Didn’t this dude touch kids????
Hopefully shane comes back to the internet again!
I missed shane🥺
I’m dying for Shane and Jeffree content! We’ve waiting long enough!
Subscription im Track Taiwanese food💖
Jack there any giveaway for me
Nice👏👏😍👏👍
my thing is…why buy it all bc you don’t want it there when people who couldn’t afford good quality makeup could have bought it and used it.
Please get a new camera person. This person shakes the camera so much it makes me sick. Also why did they need to zoom in and out 50 million times in a minute?
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Never answer an anonymous letter. 2. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better. 3. I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it. 4. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours. 5. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 6. If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made with meat? 7. No one is listening until you make a mistake. 8. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 9. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of "Smart"? 10. He who laughs last thinks slowest.     One of the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Is it just me or does Jeffrey seem a LOT more happier ((: so happy to see that
I missed you guys 😭🥰✨✨✨
I love multi tonal pink hair
I mean at least it isn't at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls... Then you'd know there's some trouble X.X
U think that y'all are EXTRA like me love you
I am loving for the humble Jeffree. I can see the work and personal growth you're doing!
Say ur filthy rich , without saying ur filthy rich 🤑 since u think Nordstrom is a thrift store now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nobody gets into Heaven without accepting JESUS CHRIST, REPENT & believe in the gospel and you will be saved. Ppl think that satan is some ugly,scary,evil looking creature NOT true the devil comes to you disguised as an “angel of light” and everything that you want JUST to capture your heart and deceive you…yes Satan is pure Evil so he is smart he knows how to come into your life to distract you from the TRUTH and the truth is that JESUS CHRIST Loves you and he is knocking at door to your heart . He wants to SAVE you from this world,hell ,and God’s wrath which is to come. Don’t wait or hold it off bc NOBODY is promised tomorrow. You could die in Your sleep or on your way to work in the morning in an accident. Life is unpredictable,if you die in your sins without accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord & Savior you will be JUDGED and cast into hell(Lake Of Fire) where there will be darkness, weeping ,and gnashing of teeth FOREVER, all eternity. Day & night , your soul will have NO peace & NO rest. Where the flames never quench and the fire never dies….I don’t want that for anybody so I’m here to tell you that I love you & JESUS LOVES YOU ,all he wants is to have an intimate relationship with you. He wants to know you. He wants to SAVE you. God bless you all♥️🙏🏽💯
There are more than 100 videos on my channel, I can't understand how someone gets a million views, and someone won't get a hundred thousand in 2 years00000
😁❣
girl. i think you left one. 3:22.  I swear that's a palette down there on the middle shelf behind you just as you took off for the register.  In other news, hit two NR's in my area. One nothing, but I did score the last lipstick at another. One lonely tube of Are You Filming there on the shelf.  I got it. :)
Omg finally 🙌 😭
The way you still give him a platform despite his horrible actions and empty apologies shows how undeserving you are of your own. You don't get to pick and choose when to be a good person, and making decisions because of friendship and/or financial gain indicates your priorities are in the wrong place. People like you and him are weak links in society and our community, and you set a standard of unaccountability across the entire internet.
Not jeffree resurrecting the disgusting person who didn't deserve his platform 🤮
انة شفت فلم سكسي امريكي بيجنن اوي وفي مسيحيات عسل ولابسين مطاط شفاف شهواني وحاطين مكياج ويلحسو معا بعض ويشمو ريحة سكسية تجنن ويرمو نطفهم على لارضية ويصرخو من شهوتهم

I’m so excited for makeup reviews

Hi guys, I'm from Vietnam. And I love your country very much. please interact with me 🇻🇳❤️🇺🇸
Anyone else remember when jeffrey found some of his makeup at TJMaxx and said it was fake but everyone else's makeup was real and a "down fall"?
*.  Looks at my conspiracy palette I got when they first dropped by luck bc the website was broken   * "I will always love you "  :')
Maybe I'm weird but I would watch a youtube series of Shane and Jeffree just going shoppingbat different places 😅
"Shane's coming to Wyoming soon" BITCH FINALLY ?!?!?!?!?  I miss Shane with my life he is literally the reason I have happiness when I'm sad  I love you both yayyyy *cries* I'm so excited OMFGGGGG EEEEEEEEEE IMMMA HAVE A STROKE THIS IS TOO GOOD OF NEWS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I love how Shane decides to randomly show up again. Fuck him man.
Wow I Can see so much growth jeffree, It’s actually really exciting to see your attitude and just overall being happy that more people will get to try your products.
Question: Does Jeffrey still live in his home in LA because I thoought he sold it...
Anyone fill me in? They reconciled? A new series in the making would give me LIFE
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
I love
🤔but if it's advertised as  "sold out"..how did it end up as overstock🙄hmmmmmm
You look happy and healthy. Good job 👏
Jeffree Star when his opponents start selling at discount stores: *laughs*  Jeffree Star when he starts selling at discount stores: it's good, I'm allowing more people to experience my products, especially that they're not able to afford them otherwise  Come the fuck on lmao
Y does the millionaire always forget their wallet
روحي يادنيا روحي بسلامه

I’m so glad Shane and Jeffree still friends I just miss Shane
I love you Jeffree
The Lord wants a relationship with you all you need to do is let Jesus Christ be your king
Shane saying “see you at the rack” is legit a vibe and I’m so here for it. Super stoked y’all are still besties!
He's a TOXIC human. Shame on all the fans idolizing this horrible person.
This was so boring
It is smart business and for sure strategic contracts on morphes end.. they would have offered a large amount in partnership that probably used wording that legally didn’t stipulate what they could and couldn’t do with said ‘overstock’. Most likely because Jeffree didn’t foresee any of the drama happening and was almost certain there would be no ‘overstock’ to worry about. I live in Australia and all Jeffrees makeup is heavily discounted on multiple sites.. NOT just the collection with Shane. It’s everything. I’m talking literally every pallet, every accessory, every highlighter, foundation, concealer ect. And yes it’s authentic because he has verified these sites before all of this happened. So I’m guessing none of the contracts stipulated putting things on ‘sales’ or discounts?
OK can we talk about why Jeffrey put Shane in the mail and there’s nowhere to be seen in the video he just click baited us so hard LMFAOAOAO
Man who is recording? Its so bad! Noises and really bad stanility of the image…
so happy to see you posting again
BOOM DOESNT GET ENOUGH LOVE AND APPRECIATION TOO OMG HI BOOOOOOM
12:07 his laugh cracks me upppp! 😁🤣🤣
Where can I buy your pink brushes
Jeffrey has SA allgations against him and  was friends with dovie vanety and lied about not seeing jessi slaughter  (a 12 yo)  being SA by dovie vanety he is the worst person on the internet.
wait, he left wyoming?
Are eyebrows not a thing anymore? O.o
Why are you gay?!
I understand going to if it's there, but he didn't have to buy all the products. Like let people who can't afford the full price have a chance. Like I bet the pallets just sit there unused now that he's bought them
Jefree ⭐️AGING BACWARDSSSSS LOOKING SO pretttyyyyy 🤩🤩🤩🤩...WHAT A MAGICKALLLLL MONTH⚡️🦋..you’re truly someone who seems to be growing learning beautifully growing evolving 🌞🌜🌚🌛✨💕💞💖✨⚡️‼️‼️
Tk maxx destroy makeup that ad been opened. They don't take returns on makeup
please come back with shane
I got mine from tk maxx before last Christmas They had the full collection.
I love seeing you guys again xoxox All the best
I miss Shane so much. I have a dark sense of humor and say some fucked up shit as a joke as well so getting “canceled” without actually committing any crime or anything like that seems so excessive. I get the shit he said. I just think is insane that we don’t ever care about actions, we can just hear something and that’s enough 😭… Shane is human. With flaws like anyone else in this world. We shouldn’t convict people on words but because of their actions.  Not trying to reopen old wounds. Just needed to get it off my chest. That man was brilliant at make documentaries. Such a shame that he recorded even cringy, poor taste jokes and comments for shock humor and being an edge lord. Anyways, can’t wait to see him with you again 🥲
Loving this vibe Jeffree. Keep it up. Loving the positivity.
Is this sicko still making videos.
Watching here from the Philippines .., you're my idol🤟
whos this bloke
xD
Breaks my heart that people can watch a special moment and bring so much negativity. Please think before anything about their relationship.
I've bought your make up from TJ MAXX
Wait is Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack,  2 different things 😩🤔!?
gotta prepare my brain for these comments
So are these people now forgiven?
Still waiting for a yellow and gold and golden neutrals palette from Jeffree. That will be in my shopping cart
I miss your old videos, when we went on field trips places and hangout... please do some in the future
Thanks for being nice to ur fans! Not all celebrities are so kind as to say hello like u did
Hi Jeffery!!! I’m a fan of yours hunny 💜🙌🏼 love you XOXO 💜 keep doing your thing! ....also I wanted to ask you how do you feel about Gabby P. situation I know it such a touching subject but since you now live in Wyoming does this make you feel any type of way???! Please spill.. safe babes!!
Queen is glowing again , we love that <3
It's good ur doing fine...while the world is ending
Jeffree:"Is this going to be Shane's return to youtube?"  Shane: On video call for 4 minutes Lame.
Do another video with Shane!!
I need a tutorial or a least a product listing of this look!
“See you at the rack” I’m screaming 😂💀
I'm loving the pink hair😍
Jaat chutiya 🤣🤣🤣
Tu tho taatti h 🤣🤣🤣
please do more videos where you’re going on adventures I miss these vids 😢
Ma’am they walk FASTTTT
Drop that skincare line!!
Is this a Shane tester? If so, it's a large NO.
the title of the pallet is real.... CONTROVERSIAL
https://youtu.be/LmXueJKUJbI
its there bc no one buys ur products anymore.... its literally a collab with shane dawson, no one in their right mind would support him anymore
Demons coming out of a guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZB2sWFPpMo
Are you going to try and sue them just like every other store that has your junk ? 🤪😜😎 stay toxic
— wht the heck is Nordstrom ?
Nordstrom is a clearance store?
hi，boy
Jeffree is so chill and professional. Still very entertaining and actually he looks happier in this vid. 😊
I love you Jeffree! I need more content! Its always the best day ever when you upload ♡
This is exactly how satan or the real devil actually looks !, so fucking accurate the way it talks and move !
My gawwwddddd I’ve been dying for that “Are you filming” shade AND that pig mirror and it’s been hiding at Nordstrom’s Rack ?!?  ** *grabs keys and drives to nearest store* **
You are so strong and I know your receiving so much hate but don’t break!!! Your like the king aand for some odd reason no matter what I go through, I’m always like “the Star still holds his head high, and so can I.” And I dk if I ever see you give in and let the masses win, I’ll also feel defeated. You have set a standard of what it is to be strong and I don’t want to see you change nor let society break you down. Say the truth, joke around and even if it bites you in the ass ten years later, who cares? Most ppl are self entitled hypocrites anyways. Be you!!!!
“ 3 some? Jk “ lol
No way
So funny how much things can change in a couple of years.
Kiehls is regular price at Nordstrom Rack. Same price at regular Nordstrom lol
good.
Jeffree, I love when you just film and talk. It is like talking to my bestie. I love you so much!!!!
The fact that you have two houses 🥺 I’m deployed and trying to make more money and can’t even afford my house.  You’re glowing love ❤️
never knew how much i needed this😩
We all make mistakes in life, part of growing. All you can do is make change and do better. And you have been on a great road with that. Stay positive and you will succeed! <3
today we learned what a clearance store is
OMG when I heard that intro music 😫😫😫😫😫 I need it back
Why is Jeffree sitting on the couch like that? Lol
Hi Shane!!
lol karma got you
LOVED this vid! Love to see you so content and cannot wait to see you with Shane again! <3 much love
Honestly your verse with deuce was sick
didn’t mention tjmaxx though did you🧐😂
glad you didn't make this bigger thin it needs to be. and to be fair it's a high end discount store not tj max prices
Why do people think when products are being sold at TJmaxx or Nordstrom they immediately think the brand is dying? It’s a RETAIL STORE and it’s where products are meant to be sold at. If you are a business owner you will put your flagship product everywhere as much as possible to sell your products even if it is long overdue with the season to regain your ROI. People seem to not know how to run a business. Only a dumb business entity will never sell the products and just put it on their garage until it expires just because they don’t want to see their products at these stores because of their ego. Even Hermes has private sale. They are a business monsters, they thrive because of business skills. Tactics, recalibration, and disposal.
That’s crazy I just bought hella Jeffery stars make up at Nordstrom’s rack in Sacramento, CA literally 24 hours before this video was posted. When I was at Nordstrom’s rack I was like wtf already knew that this was going to piss Jeffery off!  I’m dying to know how this happened!!!
I miss Jeffree and Shane soooo much!
Shane & Jeffree both seem healthier and happier. Love them 💕
👍👍👍👍👍
I want shane and Jeffree to do a video together in wyoming or colorado . I miss having the iconic duo making videos together and making each other laugh.
Idk If yall meant to do this but the Nordstrom footage is not color corrected / white balanced
Jeffree, I am so PROUD OF YOU!  You have come so far, and you have SUCH a mature outlook on things now.  You are so much wiser than even just a few years ago.  You have clearly gone on an interpersonal journey, and now are in a much better place.  I love to see it!
How are you feeling? I know you were hurt in the accident, I know you are out of the brace, but how are you feeling now after all this time? Just curious. Wishing you the very best!
Excited for the upcoming content with you two….it’s been missed 💕
I wonder how many comments have been deleted for the comment section to look like this lmao
One thing I’m extremely happy about is the fact they’re still friends. They’ve been through hell and didn’t break despite what your personal opinion may be friendships like that are rare these days
I am super duper infinity and beyond excited to see you post videos like this instead of just launch videos lately! I've reelwee missed these 🖤 XOXOXO
Nordstrom rack is a nice place for us normal people so dont be upset.
I bought the big Conspiracy palette from TKMaxx here in the U.K. The legitimate palette. Would actually prefer buying it here in the U.K. from a discount store because shipping costs from the U.S always puts me off of buying direct from the JSC website
Que horrribleeeer
Is there any other comment other then, "Oh my god ?"
OMGGGG SHANE🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽 WE  MISSED YOUUU
Finally there back🥺🥰
Wait! Reunion! When! I need this in my life !
what happened to the gold couch??
Jeffree, do some damn giveaways already just like the good ol days! I’m still eyeing those Berkins 👀
Finally the iconic duo for a glimpse of moment
When he talked about KatVonD this video just looks like karma to me😂😂😂
I just found your jouer collab at Ross I had already bought two when it first got released with jouer and it’s my fav so I bout the one at Ross too
O M G so glad you are both back 😭😭😭 Missed you so much queens 🥴
He needed to humble
Do cancelled youtubers just become farmers ?
So good to see you and Shane . ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Seeing Shane and Jeffree together is what I needed today
Man, when you said "Roll the clip from a few years ago" and it was the TJMaxx comment, I was like "What it was just recent." then you said "2019" and it dawned on me that it's already been two years. I think it's all the 2020 trauma, and I'm just remembering how good 2019 was, that it shocked me lmao.   It was so nice to see you and Shane together in a video again. Y'all would get me through some rough days, and I just loved this so much.
Your hair is giving me mermaid vibes. Love it!
What in a Willy Wonka sorority is thisssss 😭😭😭💜
Good
Jeffree stop deleting my comments
Missed these types of videos!! 🥰
Which nordstrom branch lol
Jeffrey i missed you :)
queen of trending on youtube ! xoxo
Opposite of a glow up
Just ordered the prick pallet the star ranch bundle the star lounge black tray n black jar n f**k proof brown mascara can’t wait for the black to b bk in
I like this video
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
🥺🥺🥺🥺
i ship jeffree and the black businessman 😚
Jefree come out with a brush set james charles is out of stock
You said ‘donate’ and I was yelling, “ME”!
"Not to drag out old wounds..." *immediately dredges up past drama
I just need to tell you, your pink religion collection is the best collection ever!  I'm still obsessed with everything!  Really most impressive packaging ever IMO
Loved seeing Shane!!!  I’ve missed him so much!
POS..Very Not tactful..out of either of them WoW and no^^^ in ref to : “ since i manufactured it” thats the problem right there and ppl like u egging jeffrees ignorance on. Shame!
OMG I AM SO HAPPY THIS ICONIC DUO IS BACK
Thats Hot!
Sometimes the clearance is the only way I can afford some brands and products.....so make things a little more affordable for the regular Joe makeup addicts lol
this education is very discreet for many people
he must be deleting mean comments
Didn’t this already happened? 😓
eh kinda deserved it anyways...
So so great to see Shane and Jeffrey to talk in a YouTube video again. Looooved the series they did when creating makeup 💕💕💕💕 I’ll always support both ❤️
You can forgive your ex friend in silence and not reconnect with them. Letting go of hate and using forgiveness is a form of self care. It took me many years to realise the truth of that and how deep it goes x
If you continue to admit to your past mistakes, you might just grow a soul after all. Hope it's not too late.
me : watches the video my brain : this feels illegal
Love the hair😍😍😍😍
Jeffree and Shane!! Leave the platform forever!! Don’t you think you guys have enough money?? Is it that you miss the fame? Well too bad, maybe don’t do bad things!!
Jeffree and Shane need to do a video going over Jeffree's new skin care line!!!
I don't get it... your product is still being distributed and people want it.Not sure why it matters where.
LE
PHI
DO
And Shane is literally a PE
T
S
A
Jeffree and Shane are
Thank god for the ads before the video! well Jeffree Shart and Shane Yuck! Pls leave the platform  FOREVER 🌟  Ik you love deleting comments because you don’t want people to know what you’ve done but you can’t hide the truth forever, you’ve already been exposed so just f off
That’s where it belongs ❤️
Him forgetting his wallet is the same energy Kylie had when she forgot hers 😭😂
I completely agree that we should reflect on our mistakes but we are sometimes valid when people we care about hurt us in ways we would never hurt them But we all must grow
What you sow… you will reap!!!
Same wearing makeup at 90 cus period 😝😙💗
@Jeffreestar sometimes you wanna look bomb but can’t afford it thanks for doing that Jeffree I’m gonna look out at the goodwill
thought Shane was in it. Wanted the tea
is this a joke or sum?
I miss you and Shane together so much 😭
4:27 laying on the blaccent awfully thick aren’t we 🙄
Nah
sea hag
I love you Jeffrey 😘😘😘
so different to see jeffree with natural nails
Wow, cancel culture does really nothing
Love ur car and hair
I'd rather buy that cheap dollar store makeup than ur overpriced makeup😭
as it should…
I'm here to say I love Jeffree's entire outfit and live for those slippers too.
Honestly, the make up belongs in a discount store.
“Roll the clip” That music for a split second gave me chills. Remembering what life was like in that moment OHMYGOD
I would be so stoked if I could find your makeup in places I can afford to shop.
I miss you guys collaborating ❤️
I work at a Winners and we get the same Jour x Jeffree Star liquid eyeshadow every year😂
9:50-9:55
I have to say. You have really grown up Jeffery. You should be so proud of yourself! you were so real in this video! 💋
Love the pink lips 💕💕💕💕💕
Please don't donate to  Goodwill cause anything worthwhile goes to their auction. Goodwill doesn't help people but there is a non-profit in town here called Urban Mission. Urban Mission gives away free food, clothes etc and I have seen it since I volunteer there.
jeffreee baby.... please let me dye your wig
Yaaaassss!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ya’ll switch up fast 👀
I like your whole vibe in this
Thank you for explaining how these brands end up in these type of stores. 💋
I pray you come out with a satin liquid lip!! 😍🙏🏻
I love you baby
I’m loving how much  happier you look 🥰❤️
This is the only way some people can afford to buy your products sadly 💖💖
Omg 😃 I've been waiting so long for Shane and Jeffree filming together again!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love you.I just can't afford your products.  I'll just drown ín my slobber. 😥😭
Happy to see a new video 😊
Love u so much!!!! Need u and Shane in my life!!

Watched the whole video just to see shane(:
HI Jeffreestar
Love the wavy hair
Aww I just seen my manager will ❤️❤️❤️
I love you guys !!
I don't understand what the big deal is???? Plenty of other companies have their makeup sold there.... what makes him so good that he can't have his makeup sold there too
The package looks beat up...who knows how far it has traveled.
oh my goodness i love them so much.
Shane is in my State of Colorado!! That's awesome!!!
This guy and the followers need to talk to Jordan Peterson.
Have both and love them and other eye pPallets love the quality will always be a customer I love the customer service I have never been unhappy with anything I’ve ever bought
He changed so much, he became much nicer and positive person and less shady, i love that for him, looking forward to see more of new jeffree🤍👍
Nordstrom Rack is still expensive to me.  I would take that as a compliment, though,  Also, if you don’t have it in your contract they can’t resell it to other stores, then I see no problems with it.  What I did have a problem how the stores lied to you and said they didn’t have any products of yours. I am glad you are a good sport and they let you film.
Omfg
I was confused on if you were happy or mad about this... more on my price range 🤣
Jeffery is copying Ric Lux video the house
No
But why would you buy your own makeup?
Marry me.
Yass love you Jeffree
Imagine a KVDxJSC collab and they forgive each other 🌟🌟🩸🩸
U can’t put Shane in the thumbnail and not have him in the vid like wtf
I was sitting here so excited for the people inside like jeffree is coming to your work people let’s get hyped!
Miss you mommy 🥺
why is this bullshit in my recommended
I ❤ the vlogs. I always feel like we are friends chatting. Love from Canada. Also don't apologize for being shady about that kitten. When you deal with the dark side you gotta do ,what you gotta do.
Love you 🤗🌴🏝
Yaaaassssss queen!
I was waiting for a new video from you 😁
Yesss finally almost BACK!🥳🥳🥳
The fact that jeffree has to buy his own makeup sounds insane 😅
Haven’t seen Shane in a minute lol
They were selling it online also! But I didn’t buy ANY because of how crappy I thought it was. Although it was cheap cheap and I’m too broke to pay full price 😹 but no way would I order from anywhere besides your own site! 👽🐷 I believe the full sized conspiracy palette was $24
So nice to see Shane again. I really hope he comes back. He’s a good person😭❤️
Omggg...that's kinda insulting ..moneyy
Dang how can he walk in with all that paparazzi. . . .
“See you at the rack” I love it 😂
Unfortunately, Goodwill will charge more for the makeup than Nordstrom Rack.
I miss Shanes videos and craziness
I have not kept up with the drama... Why he said "ex shawns.."??
It's not too late to repent..be delivered..and have eternal life.  Seek Jesus!
The store probably bought it and try to make profit out of it in their store
I love Nordstrom Rack...like who cares if your makeup is there it just makes it more accessible. Not a huge deal really.
"just me, him and a security..*straight face* threesome? " 🤣🤣🤣
Wow what's wrong with it being somewhere where some of us can only afford to go. I can't spend 70 and up on make up pallets but I can buy them cheaper when they hit these stores. Wow. My brother is big fan I'm not so sure though. I don't need hate comments I was just wondering why it's a big deal if it's sold cheaper in clearance stores when it's been out for awhile. Just my opinion
I’ve been reading the comments and holy shit they’re all so positive it’s concerning
“pump the breaks miss gurrll” LMAO
That's all your make up is good for, cheap crap
https://youtu.be/Laq16nWiz1k
The growth is heartwarming honestly 🥺💓
This dude scares the fuck outta me.
Professionalism at its finest she’s a business bitch 💯💗
isnt shane like a horrible person??
Yay glad to see you both back
wtf..
Why would you buy it all tho?😩😭😭😭 what if I wanted it?!😂😂😂💀 jk but you got a whole warehouse 😭
Jeffree so glad your growing and glowing. ❤️
Why does this feel elitist??? Like…it’s not unusual for brands to end up in Nordstrom rack??? Saying that he was being emotional after saying TJ Maxx is where “your ex friends go to die” and you only apologize when it’s your own product???   These products being in discount stores is the only way some of your fans can afford your products. Know your audience.  Not to mention…both creators had HUGE, some of them career ending, controversy’s. Pretty distasteful.
Calling Nordstrom a clearance store is reaching 🤣🤣😂😂😂
Can’t waittt
One minute there's canceling, the next there's ass kissing....I don't get it. Make up y'alls minds!
I am a fan of how connected with yourself you are. I love and see your growth in the last 3 yrs.
…Shane molest his son and his cat…why are you doing a video with him?
Can not wait!!
Ugh I'm SO HAPPY you're still friends with Shane! I miss him and his videos so much!!! I know he did things in the past but I truly believe he is a better person now!
Jeffree- *grabs up all the Conspiracy products so that no one can see it in Nordstrom* XD jk love you baby
Shane moved to Colorado? What? … ugh so ready for her m to come back and we need another Shane/Jeffree series
Will u and Shane ever make a new collection
Damn it's disappointing how positive the likes and comments are.
Shane is not in the actual video.
oh shit 😟
looks  like he finally got humbled
Are these comments by bots?? Being filtered?? There’s no way after everything there isn’t one critical comment
A loved Queen :3
Haven’t watched yet but already so excited
The shakey camera work. 🤢
👏🏻 some ppl can’t afford to buy expensive makeup so this atleast gives others a chance to try it. Love that collection & I own it all. ❤️
I liked the video but it doesn’t really address why the business relationships fell through.
Lmao this counts a YouTube short
I found the Conspiracy palette in the UK at my local TK Max 0: no idea how it got all the way over here
Can you do a giveaway with that makeup? 😂 I’ll take it
Good
You look fabulous glowing more then ever! ❤️❤️❤️😘
💜🎃💕💜🎃💕
Do you ever get tired of being such a liar?
Your skin is glowing !!
Seeing my two favorite loves together again would be a dream come true!! Cannot wait to see him go to Wyoming to hang out at the ranch with you! 🥺🥰 honestly I think the Conspiracy launch and collab with Shane was my most favorite memory as well as the series, even though right after that was when Armageddon happened, I love seeing you two together it just makes me so happy and to see you both so happy and healthy today makes me so so proud 🥲❤️
Love how transparent and positive you are about it!  No shame.
Glad to see you on here!  And soooo happy that you and Shane are on the internet again.  Miss your chemistry and the laughs.
I MISS SHANE AND JSTAR SO MUCH 😭😔😭😔
Saw some in Marshall’s near me
Yay! I’m so glad to see Jefree and Shane together as a duo again! Can’t wait for more videos of y’all!
y’all still supporting them?? okay you’re weird
We miss both of you <3
YES COME BACK MISS THANG  N CANT WAIT TO SEE UR RANCH 👽✨✨✨💛
How is this guy still uploading videos
It been in store since Shane fell off the wagon
I usually don't go to Nordstrom rack cause it is like the rich people Ross dress 4 less. Lol
I hope Shane does come back and make videos
I thought Dawson was canceled after that kid scandal.
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
yay im happy you and Shane are gunna be filming some videos !!!!! that's so exciting.
That's just the way of business, today.  Makeup and fragrances are WAYYYYYYYYYYYY over-priced, anyway.
The FT call was warming everyone up to seeing them back together for Jeffree’s upcoming series with Shane. But honestly, I’m excited. They couldn’t be more different, and usually in life those relationships are the ones that ultimately last the rest of time.
Shane just couldn’t stay away from the camera.. the narcissism is real with these two
Missed you!!!
We missed all of you
the demons are back
G r o w t h
Cheap makeup sells for cheap.
LMFAOOO He’s definitely deleting comments 💀
“They didn’t want us to film, but miss Thing, that’s my name in your store. Relax.” 🤣🤣 I fuckin love you.
Why leave your house? You have your own mall! Lol
Yeah that's cuz its trash and it came out years ago
🚩🚩🚩
I looked online and nothing came up cause where I live there is not a rack! I love love love your make up! Ps you are so awesome to your fans! I love that!
I missed you guys!
Ever since your conspiracy collab I've literally only used those pallets and I haven't ever seen such good quality. The wait when it came out was worth it
Look who is glowing 😍😭
I miss you two or the whole gang 😍
Okay... "who knows what's happened to it since I manufactured it." Do you use makeup you buy at Sephora? So, only makeup sold at discount stores, where it is accessible to people who don't have as much money to shop with, is gross and unworthy or being worn by you? What a fucking classist vile video.
Wish i could have found some at my local stores. Love the pallet I have but the price and shipping is out of my budget
Which Goodwill do you donate to? Asking for a friend
I thoughts Shane was going. 📴
ALSO OMG THIS IS THE BEST NEWS... i miss 2018 shane and jeffree times❤️❤️ so glad to see yall happy and thriving ✨ily both
What.  The.  Hell.
The click bait is so real lol
Wondering why this channel doesn't 🤔 have the official check mark? Ha
I miss Shane!!!!!
Shane.!
Lol
No
Hi.
When I saw this I was like "oh dear lord why"
Uhhh again these depraved together
"Puts in A refill for my inhaler I oddly only need when Jeffree and Shane colabe" lord help me now
Discusting 🤮
Roger Smith is at it again.
Im so happy they are going to film videos again. They are so funny together 💗
Karma 😭😭
this sucks
https://youtu.be/g3uwNAHCR24 😉😉
Absolutely glowing hunny, continue to shine and wishing you endless blessings and peace. 💗
Jefree is wearing  my favorite  shade of liquid  lip got to order more
I love these videos of you , look soo much happier p.s Pleaseee don’t sell the la house it’s a home i feel you would love down the line
I got three lipsticks at Nordstrom Rack Ryland, Are you filming, and Jefree what f! Was so happy to find! You may not have known, but this single mom was so over  the moon to get the products. I had bought the mini pallet when it was launched and could not afford more products at the time.
I'm just glad people who can't usually afford good makeup are finally able to get it for a reasonable price. Me included 🙋‍♀️🙂
I’m surprised how well he took this!!  That’s what we call growth!!!  Cant wait for the new videos
Issa a mood
Ahhhhh 🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤
"Its just me, him and a security guard....threesome👀     JuStKiDDiNg"   😂😂😂😂😂
Your makeup and other things you made are in clearance as they are worth no more. Don't you get your brand like your antics are tired and your merchandise is tired. Reality it's true.
oh how i’ve missed you
🤢🤢🤢
Really miss your videos, Jeffree! ❤️
Missed Shane!
Tbh I came here to judge but actually ended up enjoying the video lol!!!! 💕
Ok wow... Haven't watched Jeffree in a while and seeing how happy and positive he is these days warms my heart. You're glowing queen❤️ we love it!!!!
Can Shane come back please
So we’re all just cool with Shane coming back now huh.. you guys are fucked in the head.
I miss them
These fingerprints on the mirror 🥲
The way they’re censoring comments 😭😭
I hope it stays there
This is so cringe wtf
that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. 16For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.…
Was this the same day as the interview with Harry?
" since l manufactured it .." such a mood 🤴
What's it matter? He was humbled from a past comment but he's still making money, has a successful business, great products and seems to be doing well. I would not be pressed.
Me getting ready to go to Nordstrom Rack and get the collection…Found three pallets and buys two so that someone else can get the last one…but them liquid lips no where to be found 👀
tbh its where that shite belongs
So excited to see Shane in Wyoming but what the people REALLY need is to see YOU trying out Shane & Ryland’s zip line lmaooo
Toxicity
I'll gladly be your donation 🤣
f*ck Shane Dawson.  Disliked for that reason.
Wait what? Wheres shane? Why clickbait?
Ay at least y’all hot sellers everywhere your product goes🤩
Tkmax in U.K. Also had JS pallets months ago,could have been a year ago…I saw them on the website.
There’s prolly not even a security guard
Get off the internet
Jeffree Star doesn’t care about black people
Glad your back!!! Looking forward to your videos
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Made it - sold it - bought it back - donated it. A journey.
CUE ME AND SHANE MOVING TO FARMS HAHAHAH
Jeffree is responding to comments... Honestly guys I find that very brave I don't want to be a drama queen but seeing that... Wow. I can't imagine. Jeffree you must be in a good place mentally to find the courage to look at the comments there are too many weird and unfortunately sad people full of hate (which I hope they can get better I hope they can get happier and get over that) and I need to say I'm happy for you. You sound so natural and not just persona in the video, you're not just playing a character in it and the part where you took accountability... You're an inspiration to me. With the money you weren't I've never cared about money, rich people or expensive stuff but THIS, what you did now, that is TRUE INSPIRATION! Happiness is the goal baby ❤️ You're amazing

So happy to see you! Missed you glad to see you glowing ✨✨✨
Not this
Jeffrey's fan looked scared at Norstrom Rack because she probably didn't want to interrupt his video 🥺. She looked so sweet and told them to have a good day, I'm glad he got a picture with her <3
He or she? Make up your mind
Once a manufacturer buys product, it becomes theirs. They sell it at what they want to. If it doesn’t sell at what they want for it, they will mark it down and eventually clearance it to make something on it.
Anyone else don’t know what Nordstrom Rack is?? 🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️
😍😍😍😍
Miss you!!!! The makeup video will return!!! Ohhhhhhh
This was such a grown moment. Taking stock and being Uber rational about it. So impressed. Bravo
As someone who constantly threw shade at all of her friends the fact Jeffree takes responsibility for what he said. Big change and growth keep going 🎉❤️
Jeffree showing this level of understanding growth is lovely. Sounding a lot less animated, and more human, feels so much more welcoming.
Apologizing for shading KVD while simultaneously shading KVD 💀
Not the caption saying “today we’re going to northern Iraq” 😂😂  0:14
If they paid you what you asked, who gives a fek. Pathetic
Can we sell put it back individually.. We love iiit
I like the fact that Jeffrey has mature  and understand how his makeup in other stores is going to expand his business and bring in new customers! That's growth!

3:57 aw she was so sweet
Ewww Shane’s casual return is sooo weird
Still don't understand the hate Shane got and y'all cancel him for no reason
song of the year https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7NSNXpmHh0
Missed you both!👑👑💕💕💕💕💕💕
I went to the thrift store last weekend and saw one of his sweaters there lmao
Hi Shane
We don’t support animal abuser and pedophiles.
https://youtu.be/ZMiV7fTw5N0
At the end of the day no matter where the products end up Jeffree & Shane already got their piece of the pie. No loss on their end. Now counterfeit makeup that's another story.
When Jeffrey says "Me and Shane are filming some videos together" 🙌🏼🙌🏼
This was crazy to see your brand in that store! Also we need a new video with your furbabies :)
Much love to you Jeffree ❤️
Omg shane 😳😳
It is great to see that Jeffry addresses his previous comments about brands which are dying end up at a clearance store. It is also great to see that he understands his comments were made without knowing how exactly the makeup industry works.
The only thing wrong with this video is how short it is… can’t wait for more videos esp with Shane!!
https://youtu.be/25c_bbjFQzY
U can tell he has been watching Manny and Laura’s show, with all the talking points he makes , that’s pretty lame tbh
i honestly miss Shane...
JEFFREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should have come to the nordstrom rack in torrance!!!!
Wtf why was this video not even recommended to me on my homepage, didn’t come up in my subscriptions tab…I literally had to search for it🤔
can’t wait for you the new content with shane !!! love you guys !
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8uKC2zeeVDm8hZQJmBVSfw
I work in the manufacturing industry myself and what he’s saying is true. Any left over stock we have that’s defective or short life or if we’ve made too much - we will sell stock off cheaply! Better than making a full loss and stock going in the trash 😊
HELLO ALL :)
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
sorry i dont support shane anymore
Nothing heals depression like Jeffree Star's videos... ❤️
Not gonna lie I herd about it a month ago n flew to CO n picked up the Minnie pallet loooooove it
Don't worry about others as u r too good of what u r and what u have made urself
I have sincerely missed you and Shane!!! We need a game series of you too!!! You both look sooooo happy in your new dams lifes!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
gosh jeffree looked so pale n skinny in that old clip glad your ok now!
I wish u were friends with Shane again
Didn’t he laugh at brands 🤣 at tj max
Love how healthy you look now and the positive vibes and good headspace you're in.
Jeffrey you slay honey and you will always be amazing. Keep being the bright and glowy Starr that you are. Love you boo…
Beautiful hair booboo have a beautiful day sweetie! 💋
I completed my Shane Dawson Pig mirror collection with Nordstrom Rack - they were 60% off!!! I couldn’t resist!!! I LOVE the JXS products!!!
Go. Away.
Ooh!  "Irony" is a good palette name. With a bunch of metallics.
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
Wait stop no way you guys are back
I seriously cant tell if Jeffree is a male or a female anymore. he looks completely different in every single video
9:18 I would’ve watched that series again!
Oh the narcs are still “besties” okay.
I work at a certain retail store. We have started to carry Lux brands like Coach, Versace, Hugo Boss, MAC, YSL, Keils, Burberry, and many more. Our buyers get overstock from manufactures. But we cannot adverse that we have these brands in our store. So he’s not wrong. 🤷🏽‍♀️
U did not tell ant tea tho
Girl that is all it is worth now 🤦
But nordstrom is low key a boujie store soooo I’d be happy to sell it there than Marshall’s lol
Idk what’s wrong with the clearance stores? I love the clearance stores lol I’m not exactly poor but I shop Marshall’s, Ross, tjmax, I love them I find good shit there all the time …I don’t see the problem I like when I find name brand stuff ? It’s better for the people who can’t afford the name brand stuff…I would be ok with my product being there, being it’s helping people who can’t afford it full price 🥰
where it belongs
This is sad that after everything that happened Jeffery and Shane are back on YouTube, they need banned from the platform, sick of seeing people get unlimited get out of jail free cards
He acting like he wasn't surprised it on clearance lmao Jeff hella pissed 🤡
💥💥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💝💝💝💝
How does Nordstrom just sell jeffrees products without him knowing?
I hope I can get to go soon cause my nephew broke my pig mirror I need one on discount😅
The employees probably wanted it all for themselves lol
The difference between jeffree in that flash back tj maxx vid is astounding! He looks so glowy and healthy now
You have grown so much!!! A few years ago you couldn’t have been so cool about your stuff being in a discount store!!
Looking forward to seeing you and Shane together again 😀

I miss Shane😓 The sound of his voice is giving me joy to another level
Missed videos like this so much
Why would anyone care about who sells the said persons merch ??? As long as it’s sold ffs … diva , drama !  Jeff you were once shopping here for makeup 💄
You should convince Shane to start filming again
Oh so everyone’s cool with Shane being back ? Dope 👌🏼
I’ll take those!! :)
Dude can we really trust Jeffery like really?
Why are you two still allowed to have a platform 💞  Disgusting
He looks so happy now ❤
no because when they see jeffree buying his own makeup from their store 😭😭 i cant 💀

I actually was able to get a couple of items at The Rack! I also picked up some Burberry stuff as well, I didn’t even know that Burberry had makeup! lol 😂
:))))))
Yall forget what they did or what? Lol
The internet has not been the same since you guys left !
💜
The growth is ASTRONOMICAL! 🥰 can’t wait to see what you guys have in store!
Honestly so proud of the person you’ve become! Matured and grown so much! Such a role model ❤️
Isn't that line 2 years old now?  Most pallets end up in the dumpster at that point.  The fact that yours landed at Nordstrom Rack means it's still relevant.  #winning
Grow through what you go through ❤️ You’ve become a lot more humble and I appreciate your willingness to show it
who else thinks jeffree has actually grown as a person he seems different kinda grown up i love this jeffree
Can’t wait to see you both!!!
You’ll pay for your antics soon
love you so much jeffree 🥺💗
the absloute worst comeback for both of you in history.
Since I have enough money to buy a pallete now. Like it is expensive to buy it here in japan. and I need the conspiracy pallete in my life.
Lol me and my girl were shopping in the Nordstrom rack in Manhattan and saw the conspiracy and mini pallets. She was so happy they were there. She refuses to buy anything online so finding it in the store was great for her. She loves both you and Shane 🥰
❤️
The shade behind actually finding it there
You handled it well.
Not even 1 mil. views???? Even with  that clickbait thumbnail, the insta stories hyping this up....and still 840k only....You guys really did fall from grace face first
Cracking up on the part about the doghair in the mask because I can somewhat relate,  but instead it's CATHAIR I'm always picking out!😹😹😹
Yess
Perfect example of: LIFE GIVES YOU LIMONS JUST MAKE LEMONADE
I saw the pic floating around the interwebs and I was like damn that's crazy!!!
Love how he bought it so no one else could
Miss shane so much 💖💖💖
Ok but you’re the only beauty influencer I’ve seen WEAR A MASK CORRECTLY 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Lol
I see ur shit at Marshall & winners all the time for cheap !!!!! 😜🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bahaha
lol you know you have made it when your infamous make up ends up at Nordstrom Rack ! the conspiracy behind it all lol and it happens to be the conspiracy collection LOL love it!!! i found some here in san marcos ca san diego county. couldnt pass it up
I love Shane and Jeffree together, it makes my heart so happy 😊
Yes my queens are back ❤️❤️
mom come pick me up
Love you all! I’m a dog breeder if you need to add a dog to your Wyoming farm!
I can't with Jeffree actually going there and buying the make-up. Love him so much.
You have grown so much Jeffery❤️😊
Am I the only shocked that Jeffree star has yet to make a plumper? I know he already has big lips, and there are a bunch of plumpers already… but you would think he would had made one by now. Especially with all the lipsticks he has.
You and Halsey like twin sister
I cannot WAIT till you & Shane are together again! 😁
Yes, I remember Jeffrey making fun of someone else for their makeup ending up at a "Clearance store" way back when? 🤭 KVD I see... Well he is taking it well, all things considering.
So... it's just business, but you literally bought everything at the store just so some of the "little people" couldn't? Even though I'vebeen flowing you for quite awhile and I love so many of your looks, I honestly, I don't personally know a single person that can afford your makeup on a regular basis, OR can afford to regularly shop at even a Nordstrom Rack. So.... wow. I guess having your excess merchandise sold at a HIGH END clearance store is difficult for you? Talk about being completely out of touch with actual reality. Ok.
Omg I love your outfit!😍🥰
I love seeing Jeffree in a more positive light ❤️ I’m seeing him maturing and growing up!
I miss this Jeffree…. Loving this side of him again!
So what's with the deleted video?
Cornnertocormrtblsnket
yay!!!1 miss y'all!!!!!
Isn't this in your house you said you sold... I'm confused.
Imagine being so petty you have to buy your own products just so they aren't in a discount store for someone else to buy. Pathetic
Can I get a shoutout please
YouTube trending is basically whatever YouTube agenda they are pushing that day.
But how do you not know when your company is the one to sell it to them? Wouldn’t that need to be passed by you
When you thought Shane was physically going to be in the video😭
Now some people can afford it tho so it’s a win win
New world order
Jeff, your lipstick clashes with your hair. The 1/2 price of the items only proves the rip off by paying full price.  He said the name of God a dozen times. Clearly, he is addressing the god of the Illuminati which is Lucifer.
https://youtu.be/aORbHvMy5pQ
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
♥️you
It’s so great to see you two again 😭❤️
Hey from Goshen County  If you ever come down here , don't let me pull you over hehe
I am glad that you are finally back with drama videos
Hair by Jay needs to be fired for this wig 😂
This is crazy! So happy to see you and Shane still BFF and you all got thru all the bullshit! Can’t wait to see videos together in Wyoming and hopefully you in Colorado! Life goes on and everyone moves on to bigger and greater things! 🙌🏽❤️
i have a joke.  two dirtbags walk into a Nordstrom.
He is awesome
Shane is a predator Jeffrey
Omg, I been excited for shane to see your lovely farm! I miss seeing you both together~ looking forward to those videos! ^_^
If y’all are waiting to see him FaceTime Shane 10:55
Plz have Shane and u meet me he is seriously my idol and watched him forever my dream would come true 😍😍😍

Omg you are a dude. Just stop
I love jeffree
“see you at the rack” 💀💀💀 y’all can’t deny that shane is funny as hell
I live in the UK and just curious, is Northton rack like a cheaper version of TK maxx??? I know sephora is a make up company but I don't get it is it a big deal
I’m crying 😂 I love the energy
i love you jeffree
Well Jeffree and Shane's makeup has also been seen at TJ Maxx...so karma I guess
https://youtu.be/SxOy1acIMrs

You both are disgusting
Bruh the audacity

Move to Bozeman, MT - my boyfriend loves you.
Love you mr star
What in the Hell is this thing
There is a big difference between Nordstrom rack and tj max tho lol
We will fail everytime; it is in our nature 2 SIN. It is only through the  ****(BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST)**** that we can acquire complete Forgiveness. Accept Jesus as our Savior & ask 4 FORGIVENESS of your SINS, and accept that JESUS shed His BLOOD 2 atone for your Sins if u repent.  Then PRAISE the name of GOD. And then ask God for HELP with anything that you need help with.  It REALLY works.

I told myself I will not watch this!! But here I am in the comments section...
Loving the style today❤
I’m so happy seeing the video photo🥰🥰
Hearing you and Shane tho😭 brought so many memories back, man I miss you guys
jeffree really didnt want to see his products at a discount store so bought everything then made a video trying to revive two problematic people. why are people buying this
You better get that house sold Quick before the market crashes...which is imminent....probably just as bad, if not Worse as it was in 2008. You'll make a nice chunk now...but if not by then then you'll take a hit.
ik yall aint falling for this act again….
I thought Shane was back🥺 so I was excited to watch! But he's not... I miss shane so much
That's where your shit belongs. Overpriced Garbaggio looking like a mannequin ass lmao

SHANEEEEE💞💕💞
WE MISSED YOU TWO
YES THE QUEEN IS BACK 🐷 👑
Didn't you falsely accuse someone of Pedophilia
Clearance makeup cant be that ba-
I miss Shane and jeffree!😟😍
If it was in the uk 🇬🇧 TKM I would definitely buy it. Nothing wrong with places like that everyone loves a bargain xx
Yes please! Bring you and Shane back honey cuz I miss you guys! 🥰
My Tj max and Marshals has ABH. So...its fine.
I’m so happy you and Shane are back.
I love how transparent you were about this
Hi
I bought on launch day...but if i see it at my Rack especially since i didnt get the Green put it back, im buyin it
Boom as soon as they get home “Apple Pay me now you rich c*nt.” Lmfao
I love the way you looking longer wigs I like the longer hair on you it makes you look very pretty
Это крутой канал The best channel https://youtu.be/zYI_ku7c03M
I really don't know why it makes me feel so happy to see Jeffree and Shane on a video just to hear them communicating back and forth and laughing makes me smile
Me on my way to Nordstrom lol
Roll the series 😂
Thank you for this video 🙏🏻💖  Seeing you walking in the store, picking makeup, like in pre-rona times, made me smile 😌 Glad to know the makeup isn't expired and ppl can have a good deal) So happy to see the glimpse of Shane, can't wait to watch videos you make together 🤗💖
i don’t agree with him buying all of the stock, there are people who want the palettes who cant afford 50+ dollars, he’s just taking them away from people who can finally afford them, theres nothing wrong with discounted products, their worth is only as much as the person who buys the palette, it could be 10 dollars and still be worth 100 dollars to the person who bought it
Voldemort and Peter Pettigrew back in action? Ew.
Ewwww...
Tell me you’re greedy and petty  without telling you’re greedy and petty.
really liked your wyoming house, much more lowkey
Rack Maxx
& he’s still #1 on trending , period 💖
https://youtu.be/1uKX9jEspBk
What Foundation does Boom use on you??
Why are there no comments??
Sis, my good sis, I would not be a good fan if I didn’t tell you that this wig ain’t it. Ily I’m sorry 😭❤️
yall havent been on the internet in months and all we get is 13 minutes lmao I was waiting for an hour and a half long video.
He is so kind to fans and sales people - his treatment of everyday people says a lot about his character.
k....confused....is it good or bad it is at Nordstroms???   🧐
I love this Jeffree. And I love Jeffree, and Shane working together.
3:25 he missed one 😂 back of shelf on bottom right
Still not at TJ MAXX though 😂😂
Oh I miss you jeffree I love the new way you're going I love animals so much so to see you on a farm is awesome and yes I realize farming is not the best for someone who loves animals because a lot of hardships happen with animals on farms and most the animals end up being eaten but there's a difference between a pet and livestock
No😌
I can nor wait to see Shane in your next videos!!!! I sure have missed him. Hope he's doing doing well!!!
so no shane? lol.
I live in a sad small city with no Nordstrom much less a Nordstrom Rack *sighs* and I teach so it always seems anytime you have a big release I'm working.... I always have the same problem when buying concert tickets.... anyway..LOVE LOVE ❤ LOVE seeing you both online more. Keep enjoying life. It's not a dress rehearsal.
Bitch bust in my mouth these bitches is baaack & I’m loving every second ohh Hii there 🥰💕
SHANE!!! ❤️ bring him back 🥰🥰🥰
jeffries hair gives poodle vibes 🐩
Now I’m curious to know how JSC manages languishing stock. Or, is the business model designed to create minimal languishing stock that it can just be donated or destroyed with minimal financial loss. So fascinating!
Should I be camping outside Goodwill near you?? 😂
Why nervous
https://youtu.be/b22wVaY9OWg 😱😱
Why not let some you g girls buy your makeup instead of buying it all.
I know the tea pages are mad. They made such a big deal abt Shane being in the video, but it is just a facetime lmfao.
All I needed to hear - Shane and Jeffree filming together. Their vibe and sprit together is epic! You know what’s gonna get this world back to normal? Shane and Jeffree videos. We will come together to worship the holy squad 🙌🏼 my all-time fave video was them reviewing Kylie skin 🤣 I’ve never laughed so hard!
Jeffree, you always keep it so real, i adore you 💗❤
What happened to the video with lipstick Nick
Hey Jeffree star  I have a question for you Will you be doing any more videos with Shane Dawson on his main channel?
I’m ngl that makeup is some quality makeup.
Nordstrom rack is their CLEARANCE store??!?!?! God im so poor 😀

Geyyyyyyy
BRUH THIS BETTER NOT BE CLICK BAIT!! IS THAT THEE JEFFREE STAR AND SHANE DAWSON!?!? I don't give a flying FUCK bout ms jc and the past drama I love the dynamic in Jeffree and Shane's friendship. I haven't watching this video yet but when I do omg.
We had some high-school students, and grads at my work (print shop) over the summer. I found out in the last days that one of the girls always wanted the pig mirror and cremated palette, but couldn't afford it. I had extra at home from mystery boxes, so I surprised her with it. She was so shook that I would gift it to her. I was like girl, everyone needs good makeup in their life.
I love that JS is back on YouTube. I have honestly missed his videos! He cracks me up.
love how you make peace over the abomination things before. waw.. ❤️❤️❤️
You are too nice
😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍🤩😍😍😍😍
AHHHH YESSS FINALLY!!!! 😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰
👏👏👏👏👏
But wait where’s the tea about the deleted video!!
PROUD OF YOU JEFFREE. WE LOVE AND WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU. THE HAPPY YOU IS COMING BACK :)
What’s the problem with having old makeup sold at a clearance store? Like it’s an old release? You still got your bag for it either way. Surely you shouldn’t care that it’s being sold there? This just sounds like some kind of power trip or offence to your ego “how dare they sell my brand at a clearance store” situation.

Why do kids in Afghanistan have to suffer when this crap exist?
@Jeffreestar this feed has been corrupted! My comment has been linked to a porn site. Please delete it!
Shane needs to come back into the internet we need him

Faking it through life is nothing new in America for either gender and the ones in between. And hustling by any means possible to make money is nothing new either. Unregulated, unethical capitalism has been ruining lives and the environment since money became the god of America. I wish ethics were taught to children, and was part of law and our culture.

Good comedy sounds... likely male 🥰😆😆😄😃😀😀
🤢🤮👎
Nordstrom products are still expensive though 😅
Omg! My comment has been copied and used as click bait to a stripper! 🤮
Someone tell me if I’m wrong. This looks like the house I thought he was selling in L.A ?
The epitome of woke zombies 😷
Haven’t done a review or normal uploads in like a year or so
The way Shane wasn’t even in the video 💀💀💀
Wow you people are really quick to forgive Shane... 🐑
Tiger King Coin($tking) can very easily be worth 100x it’s current price after Tiger King season 2 comes out on November 17  It’s Joe Exotic’s official crypto and the current market cap is only at $16.5 million
What the hell is that thing?
Shane?
Ong so glad to see Shane!!!! Love youuuu
I really thought Shane Dawson was back, I was so happy
You make me physically sick.
Nobodies mentioning that Shane's in this video
Why would you buy them out though? Not all of your fans are able to buy your products at full price.
I just click on this to dislike. Bye now.
Don't know about you guys, but this is lowkey educational to me.
I didn't miss a chapter, I missed the whole book.

ngl i miss shane
Is nordstom like tj maxx?
I dont know who this person is and I dont wear makeup but somehow im entertained 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕡𝕤 𝕥𝕠 𝕪𝕠𝕦
Great, so why did you delete your video with nicole🤔🤷‍♀️
Nordstrom are making a profit so you must be cleaning up selling at full price. Just saying.
And people wonder why society has gone down the tubes…..
Can you plz stop uploading
Sucks to be a thing if the past....
I'm fucking losing it at the boys are back in town playing in the background over the store's speaker.
Shaneee
its funny hwow every asrtist etc goes to LA to get rich and famous and then realize its toxic and run away xD
I hope Jeffree brings Shane back like I really miss his content 2019 was fr fr
The content we needed. I wanted a pig mirror so bad.
So I'm a 41 year old country bumpkin who doesn't even wear make up. But I've watched Jeffree for years and have always found them a genuine person. Love this🥰
Really gonna act like you don't know why it was there....ok. 🙄
I really miss your shopping haul videos, please do more Jeffree <3
Did you notice that jeffre star always look gorgeous 🥺🥺❤
No 1 trending!!!!
I got my conspiracy, mini controversy and pink, black and pearl mirrors from TKmaxx last year here in the UK. I got all of them for less than what it cost for the conspiracy pallet alone. 😂
Please make black vault tour 😅
A lot of your makeup is being sold on beautylish on line are they your product ?
“Let me slip into something more comfortable” *switches out of comfy robe into smexy outfit*
I LOVE YALLL
I'm so happy for you doing it big things in Rack. Lol shyt I luv a good deal and a good steal.
Dont care about the drama, i still wanted that pallet 🤣❤
Proud you understand next stop TJ Max...
Came here to troll, left with valuable business knowledge
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
Wow #1 on tending!
I lowkey think it would be a good idea to sell in Nordstrom all the time- maybe some older products. Many of us haven’t wanted to commit to the price but then we try your formula and fall in love & purchase way more on your site!
Aw Jeffree, I miss these videos.
Jeffree honey, losing touch with the reality the rest of us live in.
I just bought Jeffree Star makeup!  From his company, thank you, although I have access to Northstrom.  I purchased the velvet trap pink religion lipstick and the magnetic palette case. By the way if you purchase This item you GET a free eyeshadow single! Yes yes yes!  And a early Merry Xmas to me.😉😉😉💚💚💚🎄🎁⛄❄💄💄💄
These comments aren’t filtered at all 😂😂
I love u and Shane's friendship 🖤🖤🖤
Lawsuit pending
Jeffree why do you have to pay for your own makeup?
You guys should have just stayed off the internet, like forever
https://youtu.be/lywSU_vVuY0
Love this, I still wanna get the are you filming lipstick couldn't get it on launch as it sold out :( and I don't think anywhere sells it anymore, love you jeffree xxx
Why no negative comments? Can't take criticism?
I miss this kind of content jeffree, sending love
🤣💞💞💞
Feels like the old days before all the drama ❤️
This was bittersweet to watch
GROSS
LA Native Gal here. It's normal to find awesome brands in not so keen department shops.
Aaaa!!! love this!!!  Can't wait for you and Shane to Collab like old times again 🥰🥰  Since he's finally okay with being on film in rylands videos here lately💜💜💜😍😍😍

Your outfit is legit ASMR worthy <3
*When I saw Shane in thumbnail I RUSHED!*
Omg I hope Shane some snack into the public eye I’ve missed him sooooo much 😫
I'm so sad the Are You Filming was there.  I've been wanting to order it online, and it's not there anymore

💥🔫 GANGSTER RAP MUSIC https://youtu.be/4dt_LnavKd0
https://youtu.be/4dt_LnavKd0 WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE A MAN
Jeffree is always so kind to his fans.
I’m so glad you guys are still friends. You seem in such a better place Jeffree it’s great to see it.

I really miss Shane
Losers
There was a hat of his at the gas station for sale
i love nordstorm rack  & thats the way i wouldve bought your makeup lol
jefree doesnt know his own collab w shane is being sold at a specific place? smh lies oh how have the views died down
I don't care what past mistakes you and Shane have done, I miss the videos with him 😔
Paying anything for that crap is overpriced 🤮
2001 called and wants their style back!
He was so happy his products were there lol
Miss you and Shane together so much
This might not be seen by anyone but it wouldn’t hurt to ask. Did something happened to the mini blue blood lipstick bundle? I’ve been eyeing those lipsticks for months on jeffree’s website, hoping to get one only to see them not listed under his lips tab.
JS makeup but half the price? sis sign me up 🙋‍♀️ Jk but I just purchased 3 JS eyeshadow palettes and girl the quality is insane
So Jeffree is probably somewhere else now obviously not in Wyoming? Might be in Beverly Hills? or still in his mansion in Hidden Hills?🤔🤔🤔
SOOOO happy to hear Shane and Jeffree are getting back together to film more videos together! I’ve missed seeing them together so much😭 they make the best commentary and mesh so well together so I’m v excited to finally get more content from them❤️
Even though it was only 2 minutes I LOVED seeing Shane in this video ❤
十多年前，三舅家的房子被拆迁了。过渡时期，舅舅一家租住在城乡结合部。门口是一块荒地，草长的很深，屋前还有一座孤坟。我到那儿去过，进去就感觉很不舒服，反正说不出来的不喜欢。但是租金便宜，房子也不错。后来我妈妈还说过一次，跟我外婆说的，说是哥家租的房子不好吧。后来我们还隐约听说，这家男房东是因为交通事故死了的。我舅舅不信这些，满不在乎的说：“反正租个一两年，等新房子好了就要搬了。”  看到这里，大家也许看出端倪来了，我舅舅不久也因为交通事故去世了。他出事后，有位懂风水的说，我舅舅那段时间新买的房子，风水也不好，是凶宅。说了一大通道理，我也不懂。  我的三舅去世已经八九年了，他死于交通事故。那时我读大学了，平时不在家。那年五一（那时五一黄金周还没废除），我回家了。吃过午饭后，妈妈说：“我带你去看看你三舅吧，你三舅出车祸了，只怕不行了。”我一时震惊得无法相信，赶紧去了医院。我看到三舅全身插满管子，看着我的眼神那么留恋、那么温和、又那么可怜。  从医院回来后，当天晚上，我梦见三舅告诉我说想吃柚子。那不是出柚子的季节，第二天早上，我跑遍超市和大街小巷去找，也没有买到。我安慰自己说，也许做梦不是真的，舅舅不一定就是想吃柚子。沮丧的我先去了医院，我哥不在，只有我舅妈。看见我来了，就让我先照料一下，她说三舅想吃柚子，她出去买。我当时一下子愣住了，首先想到的是，难道舅舅真的不行了？都能给我托梦了！我傻傻的站着，心痛得无法呼吸了一样，都忘记告诉舅妈我跑了很多地方没买到，于是舅妈走了。  我走到三舅身边，拉着他的手，说些安慰的话。我突然感觉他手抖动得很厉害，努力张嘴想说什么，但是很快手软了下去。我慌了，赶紧喊医生，医生过来抢救了。在这期间，我急忙给舅妈和表哥、还有我妈打电话，奇怪的是他们的电话全都打不通。我真是急死了，又不能离开了去找他们。过了一会，医生宣告了死亡。看着心电图变成一根直线，我哭着编了一句“三舅心不跳了”的短信，群发出去后，瞬间就失去了全部力气。这时再打电话，全都能打通了。  白发人送黑发人，这对我外婆的打击实在非常大，我妈妈为此哭肿了眼睛，我表哥是三舅唯一的儿子，但是他们都没能在他咽气时守着他。我是唯一给我舅舅送终的人。  小时候，我就听说少年时代的三舅简直是蛇的克星。三舅属蛇，从小不怕蛇，特别喜欢抓蛇。他们下乡接受再教育的那个地方，蛇特别多。可以说没有蛇入了我三舅的眼后，可以逃生的，他追几面山坡都要抓住。以至于后来他几乎遇不见蛇了，应该是身上有了某种气味或者气场。偶尔有蛇遇见他，就像见了凶神恶煞一样死命逃窜。  那时的人还是不吃蛇的，他抓蛇、杀蛇全是当好玩。因为家庭成分问题，低人一等，三舅应该是很孤独的，没有多少同龄小孩愿意和他玩。现在我想，他抓蛇只是他的游戏，或者是以此证明他的勇气，摆脱让人瞧不起的一种方式。  后来回城了，三舅就更碰不到蛇了。但是就在他出事那年，我前面说的，他家租的那房子门前的荒地里，夏天草长的极深，对的，在这草里，他又抓过几次蛇。城里收购蛇的地方很多，抓的蛇都卖掉了。这些被卖掉的蛇，命运可以想象得出来。   很多人一出了事，就往风水上去想。但为什么偏偏这位三舅不管是租的房子、还是买的房子，全碰上凶宅、而且还听不进劝呢？实际上，风水只是表象，人的命运走到哪一步，就会感召什么样的房子、什么样的人、及什么样的事。而命运只是业力的表现，包括宿世与现世的种种行为、语言、心念（身口意三业）的共同作用与延续。恶业成熟，就有种种不利的因缘际会，凑到一起，这就是恶缘感召的结果。业波汹涌，因果森严，哪是看个风水就能改变的，世间哪有这般便宜的事？  “诸余罪中，杀业最重”，蛇是嗔心与报复心最重的动物之一，杀蛇的后果尤其可怕。从小杀蛇无数，走到这一步，只是业力使然，岂关风水？大家是在漫不经心地造着杀业，懵懂无知地承受着果报。天道好还，每一点施之于众生的伤害，都是要自己一点一滴承担回来的。
What happened to Shane Dawson? Did he stopped being on the internet ?
Threesome 😂😂
Of the few times that Jeffree is not wearing press on nails💅💅💅
Even at 14$ is it extremely expensive since the actual product in there cost 1-2 dollars!
Arent you a weirdly sexually abusive narcasisist?
Yaasssss bitch i miss you back to make up please 😬😬😬
You can tell this hurt his ego LOL 🤣
1 on trending. period
Wow
Jeffree : “it’s just me, him, and a security guard.”  Me: “so…. Is the security guard filming?”
This is a certified hood classic
OMG i love the LV TRACKSUIT
WHY WOULD HE BUY IT ALL JUST TO GIVE TO PEEPS THAT DONT KNOW HIM OR WANT IT AT ALL INSTEAD OF LETTING THE PEEPS THATS SEEKING IT OUT ACTUALLY FIND IT IN THE STORES AND GET HAPPY! DUH!
🤮
The iconic duo
Lol..well yinz are basically neighbors. Co and Wy. 😊
Omg someone other than Ms Stat is making a dollar off makeup....the horror.
Im confused I thought Shane was "Canceled" and they were fighting lol
not gonna lie i have no life and am hoping that everyone who reads this comment subscribes and joins the discord
I'VE LITERALLY BEEN DYING TO SEE A VIDEO LIKE THIS FROM JEFFREE AND I FINALLY GOT TO SEE IT 😭
my fave couple is back!
Any idea what shade Jeffree is wearing on his lid in this video? It's so pretty! Can't think of one of his palettes that has such a popping champagne color.
Are you gonna review nikkietutorials make line?
no one likes you
#1 on Trending for this. 🙄 Everything that most of us already knew. 🤦🏻‍♀️ He’s acting like he’s fine with it because what choice does he have?! I guess that’s growth for Jeffree.  All the hype for this..because he and Shane both know that everyone will fall for it!! 😂 Have to give it to him… He’s a genius and knows how to get that coin from us.
Hey Jeffree have you moved back into your old house :)
Disappointed in this video tbh - I was expecting more.
China as a big country! A staunch supporter of the Paris climate agreement! China has the responsibility to take the lead in abandoning coal pollution sources! Lead the world towards clean energy development! China has the responsibility to lead the world on the right path of development! Give up coal!
“It’s just me, him and a security guard… so threesome” lol
Both of them are the cancer of YouTube these type of people is what's wrong with the world
Algorithm fucking with you Ms Star
Oh my dear be glad for the high end exposure !,,
This is so embarrassing
I didn't even get notification must be cause of Shane
Did you know that you can buy products of yours at wish??
This video is a flop. Lol
Can I have a palette? I can't afford it here in Canada for that price!
I envy Jeffree because he 100% never has the struggle of trying to remember & find where he parked his car
Shane 🤮
I’m so happy you and Shane stayed friends throughout all the craziness. I miss you guys!
the shade clip at tjmaxx was so funny HAHAHHA
Dont mind me, just leaving a dislike
Shane still had inexcusable behavior with minors and him not properly acknowledging it and playing friends with Jeffree isn’t going to sweep it under the rug.
Old jefree back!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤩 these new influencers are so fake and boring
lose the ink JS
Y was Shane on the thumbnail when he wasn’t even in the video? Clickbaitin ass 🙄🙄🤚🏼
Dollar store dump
Jester Flop
Hey Jeffree, glad to see you growing and healing. I wish some of those would come to Ohio...but the Paul Brothers ruined it here. Lol
666,000 views the devil cant even keep me away
This video was a lot of drama 🎭
Can’t wait for Shane’s videos omg 😱 I’m so excited… I miss you so much
THAT Alien Queen and MR. Piggy duo is back   well... kind of
Your hair is so beautiful✨
Ohhh you DID donate it hahaha - such a sweetheart
I love when we get to see you interact with the public. It's always so fun.  You are really cool with your fans and you enjoy your celebrity which is nice to see.
Isn’t that weird that we were alll soooo desperate to get the controversy set and then somehow it ends up at a discount store - makes no sense hey!!  I love that you bought your own makeup back - but you know what you should’ve done was have an auction on line for it or give it to peeps who can’t necessarily afford it - cause you’re just gonna chuck it out right?
Loser. Will do anything to stay relevant huh
I love how the universe works 😁
I wanted to buy your eyeshadow pallete at Sephora and it was gone. I was so sad !
Buying your own crap to keep yourself relevant.   Lame.
I love your positivity it’s so refreshing

So prideful. 😒
finaallyyy a new vloogg
Wait sir, are you actually sorry for throwing shade at KVD or are you just saying that now because your products are there now also…..?
All these comments are so positive like beyond believably positive.
What the fuck.
I cannot stand those cheap ass looking wigs your stylist keeps putting you in.
This made me so happy for some reason.
Is no one gonna talk about the bots in these comments
I LOVE YOU !!!
Ever as Why did the mirror wake me up oonn
Anyone else come here just to see Shane and Shane was literally only on ft
Omg
i hate that shane did this tbh. this isn’t it
Honestly this is a grab it if you can moment. I want to go get the green one now and I bought mine in the original restock from Jeffree. If this is discounted it’s a steal and nothing to be ashamed of, it’ll turn into a hunt.
SHANE 😻😼😸❤️
YOU HAVE STUCK SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE BACK!! YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON TO TALK ABOUT THAT!!
I don’t know why there’s so much hate going on towards such a beautiful man?! He works so hard and is so loving life it’s just unfair sometimes.
Why would you buy it instead let the people that can’t buy your make up they could pay less don’t be selfish
Can you please film the ha
Jeffrey might have lost a lot of fans but her products are still top-notch and don't belong there.
Where do you live now 😁😁😁
I can't believe this toxic thing still has 16.2 million subscribers!!! GROSS!!!
LMAO AS A MAKEUP CEO you didn't know to sell your products as Nordstrom Rack, or TJMAXX I cannot believe that for a second. You're a business person. I know you're not stupid.
Back-peddling at it's finest. Karma's a bitch. hahah
Il buy it for 15 bucks
You can tell he’s genuinely happy and it’s so mesmerizing 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
How are there no negative comments? Is he deleting them?
I think there is a galaxy of difference between TJMaxx and Nordstrom Rack
My hands shaking seeing the thumbnail
Hey friend. Hope your doing well. Bless you . ❤️✌🏾
Omg I'm currently earing Mac n cheese from chick fil a and I almost chocked when Jeffree said three some!!! 🤣
😍😍😍😍
Bro the brand is tanking just admit it
I got my mini pallet from Tk Maxx in Australia ☺️
He’s like all excited 😆 I’m Australian so I have no idea what Nordstrom Rack is, it is like the Clearance Section or The Reject Shop? 😂
Oh my god I couldn’t help but click god fucking damn how could I not
Repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it's too late, God loves you!   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9 NKJV   For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!
people really still pretending that jeffree’s brand isn’t tanking hard af and won’t be around much longer 🤣🤣 calling it now!
I’m sorry, but does your cameraman have Parkinson’s?
who really cares if these products end up in these so called clearance stores. they get bought either way lol smh, bunch of narcissists.
Omg yes! I bought that exact palette 3 weeks ago at Nordstrom rack, I was shocked, happy but shocked!!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/NMsYSYzcNiw?feature=share
More content please Jeffree ♥️
Whether you like Jeffree or not he really has humbled himself and found some peace
💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
Yay! So glad it’s at NR!! PLEASE let the cashier email you the  receipt. It counts against her stats if you don’t.
“See you at the rack!” Hahahahahahah you guys kill me. Btw ….can we please talk about meet and greets in Casper?!?!
Shane wasn’t even really in it 🥲
Next time (cameraman) place the camera on a tripod.. im sooo dizzy with all that moving
Yo he shouldn’t buy it, he needs to let someone pick up that bargain
Love you Jeffree Star i got a star of one of your albums one time and i didnt even order it. Idk why i got it. Maybe you sent it to me!
Hearing both you and Shane laugh brought so many memories back
I miss when Chris held it still
Luv you, but not a fan of that pink wig…
YUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I was expecting Jeffree to say, "they're going to hear from my lawyer."
Yesss girl you and Shane are amazing love you guys ❤️❤️❤️
This is truly ✨ Disgusting ✨
Are you
Jeffrey on the couch cuddled up with his makeup and slippers is so adorable 😍
Whatttt!! Shane moved to Colorado!? 😮
Everything goes to TJ Maxx etc eventually. I love my discount stores. It can end up there from department stores closing too.
I MISS SHANE SOOOOOO MUCH!!! But even more, I miss Jeffree and Shane!!!!!!
Love that you all are still friends. You're different around Shane and he brings out the best in you IMO.
How can people watch this trash content 🤮
Someone's clearance store is my expensive store
Not Jeffrey saying his things will never be on there
Love to see you Queens doing a video together again ❤❤
of course it's in clearance, its garbage lmao
So happy u put a video out!
Ooh, what eyeshadow is that on your lid?! It's gorgeous!   Also, having to pick dog hair out of your mask is sooo #Relatable <3
Jeffree walking into a Nordstrom Rack store to purchase his own brand of cosmetics Lol 😂….Classic 👏🏻👏🏻🇦🇺
I AM SO HAPPY TODAY, THIS VIDEO IS THE REASON WHY.
We don’t want Shane back thank you
No thanks go away
Love how everyone was saying you guys flaked with this video, yet here ya'll are 🙌🏻
Being happy in this world is impossible. There are disorders, sickness, crime, death, hunger, and climate issues. However, this is temporary. Why does this exist you may ask? The devil tested Adam and Eve, and they betrayed God by eating the forbidden fruit. Imagine, a creator who creates things and out of love gives them free will. That is a choice. He did not make robots or people to suffer. Sadly, the devil or satan was a jealous angel who wanted to be worshiped. He is a narcissistic spirit who planted his seed here on earth. He wanted humans to worship him and not God. Adam and Eve hurt God. He only asked one thing, and that is to not eat the forbidden fruit. God could have destroyed the devil but, then what would all the angels in heaven think? The devil called god a liar by saying our ancestors would not die. All the angels were watching and the penalty for betraying god is death, and because we are born in sin, we are imperfect. Genesis 3:1-13 "Then the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die. For God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." Knowledge is power, and what is a narcissistic person, a person who wants power to be worshiped. Jesus was tested by the devil. He did not deny that the devil is currently ruling this earth when he was tested. However, Satan's time on earth is short because of what happened. You are probably asking what happened? You see, Jesus is God's only begotten son, who died for our sins and was resurrected three days later out of death. What does it mean for Jesus to die for our sin? It means that he is loyal to God and did not succumb to the narcissistic spirit that our Perfect Ancestors did Adam and Eve. That is right, both perfect people were tested by the devil and Jesus prevailed, even-though our ancestors did not. Jesus performed miracles such as curing the lame, sick, disabled and raising people from the dead because of his humble loving, loyal spirit to God, and not being tempted by power, greed, and unclean natural practices. Jesus is our king and is ruling in heaven, but he will come down to earth, and raise the dead, and judge both the living and the dead. Praise Jah or  hallelujah or praise Jehovah. You may ask who is Jehovah? He is the creator of all things, the highest living god. His name is Jehovah. What do you think hallelujah means in your bible, and when people sing the song? It means to praise Jehovah our god or Praise Jah.  When people sing hallelujah, they are saying praise Jah or praise Jehovah. The Hebrew Bible hallelujah is actually a two-word phrase, not one word. The first part, hallelu, is the second-person imperative masculine plural form of the Hebrew verb hillel.[1] However, "hallelujah" means more than simply "praise Jah" or "praise Yah", as the word hallel in Hebrew means a joyous praise in song, to boast in God.[10][11]    The second part, Yah, is a shortened form of YHWH, the name for the Creator. The name ceased to be pronounced in Second Temple Judaism, by the 3rd century BC due to religious beliefs.[12] The correct pronunciation is not known, however, it is sometimes rendered by Christians as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah". The Septuagint translates Yah as Kyrios (the LORD), because of the Jewish custom of replacing the sacred name with "Adonai", meaning "the Lord".  If you want to know more about what the bible says, please direct message me and we can set up a time to talk.  Here is a link to what God's name actually is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah If you have anymore questions please contact us at https://www.jw.org/en/
so now shane is back?
Girl, the only time you need to worry is when they STOP talking about you. Otherwise you good! 💗

You look like a man trying to pose as woman and that's a compliment! Because you really  look like your the product of a failed laboratory clone that there still working on.  I hope you don't believe in evolution. Lol. Cuzz evolution gave you the middle finger!
SHANE COME BACK!!!!
ok...
how is this trending it flopped
I'm  glad  to  hear  that  Shane  is  heading  to  Wyoming  to  do  a video  with  you! I'm  sure  it's  going  to  be  fantabulos!
Good to see you 1 On Trending.. 😍
Why is this #1 trending???
blegh
so wild how no one is truly ever canceled unless they agree to it as well. jeffree knew the people who were so entertained by him and shane a couple of years ago, even if not supporters now can't help but click on this if they see it. i'm sure jeffree knows this they're planning for both him and shane to have major comebacks.
I love you Jeffree🥺❤️
Nordstram rack.....you've made it in the world 😂😂
I love how much more human Jeffree is here. He's not just a character anymore, he seems more real.
I saw Shane Dawson in the thumbnail and clicked instantly
I love you baby no kown we are dating baby that good
Thought he said he was gonna talk about why the other video with lipstick nick got taken down.....
Is Shane even in the video??
What a silly, overly dramatic video. OH MY GOD!  😆 🤣 😂
Hope Shane and Jeffree film again 😭
A blessed day to you brothers and sisters. (We are all called to be family in Christ! 🙂) Family, JESUS CHRIST THE LORD DIED FOR OUR SINS, HE WAS BURIED, HE ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY! 🙂💯🔥 Jesus (the SON OF GOD) LOVES US ALL. Peace and love to you all in the name of the Lord Jesus! 🙂
Love the vlog filming style ! Bring it back miss thang
Me patiently waiting for my Pricked package to arrive.
The way Jeffree sits on the couch with his legs backwards is the same way my baby sits… ouch 😅
Don’t lose that dry sense of humour, If others don’t get it that’s their problem! People take s**t far too seriously.
Sephora just wants to get rid of it.
Did you know about your products being sold on the Wish App
Someone needs a cameraman. So shaky & wobbly. Made me sick.
BRUH
He is such a Queen 👑 ❤️❤️❤️
If you only knew I'm dying to have those make up! But it's not available here in Philippines 😭
The makeup 💄 is probably about to expire.
I could tell it had been a while since he had his hair on. 😂🤣😂 He was feeling it
I'M going to get me a discount 😃. Hi HOW ARE YA‼️
He's a freak
Where it belongs
So glad you are all still good friends💕
lmaooo that Nordstrom Rack is across the street from where I stayed when I was in LA 😂 memories!!
So excited to start seeing Shane again I’m general but knowing he is filming with Jeffree and how much healing they have both done makes my heart happy
The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
He’s really grown as a person .
This video makes it seem like a collaboration with shane dawson and it’s so misleading considering there was only a brief facetime video with him.
Yaaassss👏👏👏Can’t wait to see Shane on YouTube again especially with you Jeffree👏🧡🧡
Love the new vibes Jeffree 🌸💕🤍
hieeeee hew er yewwww??? no points
You forgot your wallet?? Lol What the actual point was for you going there then. Any pre-meditation? I mean literally, if you pre thought what you were going to do if you saw it there and purchasing it up to " investigate" was the plan, how could you possibly forget your wallet if it was that important to you? Oh, and buying it all was mean and selfish to those who can't afford the product launches before sellout at full price. Us broke b**ches like makeup too.
Who is this new Jeffree ??? I love it ❤️
This took forever I so excited for this video
omg i love you guys omg i miss you guys and i wish you  guys would make more videos together 😓❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’s just not the same.. :/ I’m sad because I missed and enjoyed their content but it’s just not the same
LOV YA'LL TOGETHER !!!! CAN'T WAIT !  MUCH LOV🐽💋💚💚💚💚🖤
The roll it part 😂😂
I have never commented on a Video before but I am so fucking happy you’re back I am so happy about videos please please please I need you right now you make my day so much better you’re an amazing person inside and out remember that
Love the Rack. Love your true self.peace
Miss you long nails
@jeffreestar you should upload more of like your old videos like this and different make up&skincare reviews often i/we miss those good old times you should review colourpop powerpuff girls collection and the new glamlite martini collection there's alot of new make up&skincare stuff to be review by you ♥️💙💚💛💜🖤🧡
I really loved this video I’ve always wondered how they could sell stuff without permission ❤️
We miss you guys!
Ironic that an HIV medicine advertisement plays on this creeps channel. Nasty.
It's good to see you back, Jeffree. I look forward to seeing you and Shane reunite in Wyoming.
I really miss the Shane and Jeffree dynamic. It was nice to see.
What about Apple Pay Jeff
Don’t hate watch. Watch a tea channel cover this
I clicked so fast I thought you and Shane were back hanging out together 😩
One way to avoid seeing your product going to the discount retailers is to get a contract with them specifying that they are not to do that without approval from you.  If this is possible. (I'm not a business lawyer.)   Another way is to limit order quantities so that your vendors are never so deeply stocked that this is an issue.   Keep them a little bit hungry and keep sell-through to the public close to 100 percent.  If your vendor is never in an overstock situation, they never have to deal with an overstock situation.   Obvious.
Glad to see y’all back 💪💪💪
This could’ve been an email…
Shane busy with his cat to come in person 😐
I will forever love the friendship between Jeffrey and Shane ♡
No thanks
Still fucking iconic I don’t even care.
But Shane
Overstock this happens to 99% percent of merchandise. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m ready for all the vlogs 🥰
Jeffree needs an emergency fraud line so when his products are found where they shouldn't we can report it!
We need more YouTube videos
From a business management point of view, this is actually pretty interesting. This video is actually educational.definitely I can understand the feeling, that if one of my products ended up in a store where it wasn't exactly planned to be
If there is a new Jeffree X Shane video coming soon, I will literally cry <3
FUCK. YES
Need to do a, made it to the Nord rack stamp 😂❤️
Karma is so funny
Ugh, the shaky camera :(
Who else clicked on this cause they saw Shane in the thumbnail 🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️
I can’t wait for the videos with Shane, I’m need of a good doses of Jeffree x Shane.

Genuinely soo happy you guys are back, youtube was boring without you guys.. period! Here’s to a fresh slate 🤍👏🏼♻️
Very mad I thought Shane would finally be in a video😭
Bs
I absolutely love your growth as a human ❤️❤️❤️👏🏼💯
STFU making it seem like Shane was in the video annoying lol
Jesus is coming, repent for your sins and you will be forgiven and put your faith in the lord Jesus Christ because he is the way the truth and the life. https://youtu.be/YxcO3Rd8Bo0 stay safe😁🙏
Clickbait Queen. And I ain't mad about it! That was smart!
Hell I wish I could come across some discounted JSC makeup - I'd snatch that shit up REAL QUICKKKK, lol 💯
Bruh like how do I have a job but still be broke :')
im sorry love your wig... its a no no for me
Come on Shane. Stop being a side kick and go back to being the main bitch of your own shit.
I’m so happy that their still friends my two faves
Shane looks different these days
I have a question are u a boy or girl
Yes sister 1 trending
👍
Oh I wish u would have did a giveaway. I wasn’t lucky enough to get Shane’s mini palette due to stuff going on in my personal life.  It’s been so stressful n glad it’s calmed down now
Whoa
I missed you 😘😘🤟🏾
#1 on trending yaasss miss thing love ya Jeffree!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️😘
#1 TRENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!! LESSS GOOOOO
#1 on trending….what a surprise
Who cares? I will never get this time back.
https://youtu.be/4dt_LnavKd0 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video, the comments, everything that is going on here and how the internet chooses to love or hate is just truly fascinating to me.
Why Jeffery ask if the other guy brought his wallet
Image selling JSC to Jeffree star 🤣
I think I know where jeffree buys his hair
Loved this! And we miss you both like crazyb
Hope you also visit Colorado then hang out with the whole family, ride the zip line, and paddle on the pond.
Who ever is your new camera man is really shaky. I felt like I was on a boat and was  going to get sea sick haha!
I actually cried when I saw Shane miss him so much!
How many people watched this thinking it was Shane's big debut??? 🤬 #shanestan4eva
Smh weeeeiiirrrrdddd
H3 podcast soundbite HUH
I HAVENT STARTED THE VIDEO YET BUT YESSSS IM SO EXCITED YALL ARE BACK OMGGGGGG
I'm sooo excited to see you and Shane together again!!! I soo wish I could find the conspiracy mini on discount in Northern Michigan but one day I'll have some 😘😘
When you saw it at tjmax like two months ago…
Miss thang
#1 on Trending? Bitch you betta 💅🏼
I loved this video with a vlog style!
#1 on trending.. got give props even if you hate.
I need to go to Nordstroms!!
Two bigots in a shop
This lowkey educational for some people
I miss Shane! Tbh
I hope to find it
Why did this happen! Girl-
Wow I knew it
Hope people who can't usually afford your items can finally experience quality makeup! The Conspiracy collection 🐷☆ is amazing.
Am I the only one not seeing the Imago Dei in Him?
Get tf off the internet
I love that the video is #1 trending
не я тупо столько не скурю чтобы это смотреть.
I would've loved to go to my local Nordstroms rack and find JS lipstick lipgloss or pallettes. 💕
One of very few in the beauty industry who have shown consistent growth. To err is human, to forgive is divine.
i miss shane sm
I missed you two so much. 🥺💕
Love you Jeffree 💛
It may be from all contracts he lost with other brands, and they had so much left over, they sending them to discount stores! That's to much out
Is this a new camera man? It's so shaky and dizzying
Wheres SHANE!
Can I have your couch 🤞😩
I fell asleep during the video, died and came back 🤣🤷‍♀️
YESSSSSS I CANT WAITRRR
I'm so glad that both you and Shane got out of Cali. Y'all deserve much better!!
needed this 😭😭😭
You are glowing Jeffree... you look good✨
*speeds to my closest nordstrom rack*
I thought he sold his house in LA?!
I loved that series music! Thanks for the video.
miss them both my god
Lol #1 trending
I love this Jeffree!
the shaky camera gave me vertigo
Ahah
Fame and money won’t last long 👌
Jeffree.. I think it's awesome you are donating that makeup! .. I also always smoke a blunt when I watch your videos.. Love ya!💚💚💚
Dude the one time i wish I worked at Nordstrom rack again lmao to see you plus an extra discount cause I’m a broke bitch 🤣 I saw this in my notifications and was instantly happy and it saved my day…. Thank you for contributing to my mental health
i haven't watched a jeffree video in 10 months! i have to say, it's nice to be back- heyyyy Shane good to see you, wish we would have seen more of you 💓💓🦋
So good to see you ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else going to goodwill in Wyoming now?😂
Oh can't wait to see Jeffree and Shane back filming together! Just love them and support both of them!
“Run the series!” Just kidding 😂
Is this the type of shit of shit people actually care about?....
This was fun - please upload more!  O/T, please make fleece throws to go with your fleece robes. My dog needs one. :)
cool, it's good to see more of Jeffree and Shane!
I just love how he is able to look back at his past and be like "omg, I was awful" WE ALL HAVE HAD THAT MOMENT WHEN WE ARE LIKE "OMG WHY DID I EVEN SAY THAT? WHY NOBODY STOPPED ME?" LOVE HIM TO THE END OF TIMES ♥
Clickbait thumbnail 😢😢
Literally so in love with your couch
I'm proud of you Jeffree, your growth is showing and I am here for it 💕💓💓
why he always gotta sit like that 😭😭😭
It brings me so much joy to see you so happy!!! ❤️ You Jeffree Lynn!
I wouldn't be angry about this because now even more people get to use this amazing brand! People who couldn't afford the really reasonable regular price 'cos I think Jeffree really prices his stuff WELL for what they are, the amazingness of it all. I mean there are other brands out there who aren't as good that go for almost twice what Jeffree charges for his!
CAN'T WAIT FOR UR NEW VIDEO WITH SHANE <3
Glad u buy back those... they're not suppose to put those on those shelves
ILY YOU JEFFREE! YOU'RE SO PREETY 💗✨
Ok what gender was this person born as, what gender are they now, and what gender do they like?
What is the name of the red shade liquid lipstick 💄 does anyone know 🤔?
I did not frantically refresh the website and wait in line for an hour (almost making me late for work) just for this pallete to be sold at TJ Maxx😭😭
hi Jefree love your channel  nice to meet u
Who else thought shane was gonnna be in the video??
The clothing industry does that too. It’s better to sell it on, even if it is to TJ Max, because dead stock in your stockroom costs you money
Can we all agree that when He uploads our day gets better! 💖
Why are you on the phone with a CP?
When u not acting "beatchy" - u Just magical. Unusual, but magical. Glad that u feel better. Take care. Thank's for shining so bright nomatter what. From Syberia wth love.
I’ve been here since before the music videos and it’s so nice to see as I’ve grown jeffree has too, even ponying up to the slip ups and missteps. This is probably the only person I follow close enough to say that money made them a better person
I love seeing Jeffree just smiling during the whole video. He changed a lot. 😍😍
How on earth Jeffrey Starr ended up in Wyoming on a yak farm is a vid I want to see.  Barely know anything about yaks.
I'm ready for you and Shane to premiere together again. Glad to see you both doing well. ❤
You look amazing, your time away has done so,well for you. 💜
You forgot your wallet and made someone else pay 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this. Such a great attitude to have. No drama just mature understanding. Loved this ❤️
THE.MOST.ICONIC.COLLAB #sorrynotsorry
I mean you can tell anything about Jeffree but he is so much entertaining
Hold up calling Shane ???
Yesss you handle it well queen
Your both so arrogant most would love to have a makeup line at Nordstrom your really are both ungrateful 😒and think money makes happiness
You should of left some of it there and had it signed
ME NOT MAKING SUCH A WEIRD MOMENT A PITY PARTY AND SWINGING THE RECEIPT FOR A MINI CELEBRATION
I luvn your sofa
Why did you buy it all?
That wig is a mess
country life suits you both <3 your all glowing again ^_^
Wait…… why would you buy the seemingly last in stock?! 😫😫 Wouldn’t you want other people to buy and love it?! Ahhhhhh! That killed me. Like why take it all, I don’t get it!!!! You said said you weren’t even gunna use the lip stuff yourself 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Jeffree : aww the root beer scent..                 Roll the series 😫  ** brings back memories ** 🥺 Me: 😭 yesssssss make another series 😭
The way Jeffree sits on the couch is flexibility goals for real 💯
Not even disappointed Shane wasn’t actually in there
i’ve seen NARS and so many really expensive makeup and other types of stuff in marshall’s, not saying that that Jeffree’s makeup line is less than NARS but let’s be real NARS is that bitch. That doesn’t even mean anything.
Danm I need to go to Nordstrom
I immediately went to the burglary you went through! Edit: Gooootcha. That makes sense.
The actual filming is a hot mess... there are simple ways to make filming so much smoother and adjust lighting to not be so washed out. The shakiness when he is back at home looking through the makeup is dizzying.
I’m dying to see you two together again 🥰 I just bought the Conspiracy palette in the JSC 2x1 sale 🙌🏽💕
How can you forget your wallet? You took it well.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Always so happy to see you post new content. I hope you start posting more again 😭😭😭
I Found your makeup in the Dollar store  you f Ed up its where it belongs we cheap people need good makeup too, come on help us out 😁
I wonder what the prices was
I luv her
Yay I can afford it! Lol
Shout out to Nordstrom rack for letting jeffree film there
Okay but his skin looks great right
3:55 she is lucky 🥰💋
Queue me and Shane moving to farms lmao
I hope Shane and Jeffree make videos together in the future I love them 💕
i love their friendship
the wholesome good vibes are RADIATING! You're surrounding yourself with the right people <3
It’s funny that Shane is not the video 😂
YES
Cannot wait for more Jeffree & Shane moments!!!
So you got paid no harm no foul then!
Still love you guys no matter what.
I was picking out the dog hairs on my mask… lol story of my life except I have cats 😂😂
Jeffree’s still stay true, we love it
Dislike bc this video felt like it was hyped up as clickbait. :( no tea or anything
OMG YESSSS THE QUEENSSS ARE BACKK!!!!
Threesome 😂
“3 sum? Jk😜”
Im so excited 😭❤️
great video and being able to reflect on past-self's. Here's to growth, and to seeing Shane and Jeffree still support each other!
I really love your contents .. super!!
I’ve been searching for them in clearance stores all year ! No luck
Yall lol the comment section is HEAVILY censored so if you say anything slightly rude, it will get taken down
Omggggggggggg shane missed him so much
Oh...ok, I still say u shouldn't have had to pay for it 🙄 especially when we know it's u !
I fucking love that couch dude.. 😩
First of all anyone who works in retail knows how this happens....give me a break!!!!
He seems like he is in a good place and happy and am happy for him 🧡
That “3Some” joke 😂
This was the best way to handle this situation. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
After all the drama i still love Jefree  , the most relatable queen out of all the beauty gurus.
When you almost didn’t watch this video because you work for Nordstrom and you’re kinda over it 😂 but anyway, I really appreciate Jeffree’s growth and addressing what he said previously we love the respect in this house
Aww I’m so happy to see you and Shane doing a collab and hopefully you’ll get to do it again soon!! I love you guys!❤️❤️❤️
Why the entire fuck did u have to pay for ur unauthorized ** product , stolen goods
Anyone else think Shane was gonna actually be in the video 😒
Every store has to make room for new merchandise. This can introduce new people to products they normally wouldn't buy or afford. I buy quality make-up but because I don't wear makeup very often. So when I can get it on sale or at a closeout like this, I'm more likely to buy.
Missed them :(
Boo, you need a brick and mortar store all over the U.S.!! I would totally apply to work there!! I have dreamt of you having a stand alone store I swear.... Just my opinion!!!
Fair play ❤️❤️
You’re make up is the best quality I have ever used. Up there with Chanel and Ys
Lol was that the only shame cameo all this hype and hate for people to be rude for a FaceTime omfg 😂😩
Lol don't donate to Goodwill they will auction them on their website for full price 😅. Donate to a LGBTQIA friendly non-profit organization.
That place looks way nicer than any Marshall’s or TJ Maxx near me  Edit : oh it’s Nordstrom rack lmao
Out of everything in this video seeing Jeffree and Shane still love each other has renewed my faith in humanity!😍
I feel like he bought them all to get rid of them lmaoooo you ain’t slick Jeffree lynn
I would love a Jeffree Star and Baddie Winkle Collab or even just a video 😍❤️❤️😍❤️😍❤️❤️😍
Jeffree: 'roll the series' Me: 👁️👄👁️
Legend 💖💖💖💖💖💖 love you Jeffree ! DYING to see this farm of yours and to formally be introduced to your precious yaks 🥰 PLEASE make a video soon 😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💗💗💗💗💗
So nice he’s responding to comments! On a real note don’t go too miss proper… I love a little shade and tea sprinkled in. Can’t tell you how many times you’ve made me die laughing.
Love the positive vibes ❤️
You can really see your personal growth with this video, good for ya
I love Jefrey😘😘😘😘
I so can't wait for ALL the future videos...💜👄
HEY JEFFREE US POOR FOLK WANT TO BUY YOUR MAKEUP TOO!!!! LOVE U💋
Jeffree's jacket noises are so ASMR vibes.
“How and why” your acting skills need to be touched up.
Jeffree....I love you. I love how you bought ALL your shit up from that Nordstrom Rack, spilled the tea, and plan to donate the rest. You are freakin awesome!!!!!
Not sure how I feel about this yet
It's a wonderful thing for people who may have financial challenges as well as high fashion standards.  I'd grab this stuff if I saw it!
Ummmmm just my 3¢.....   But only 3 people at the house !?!?!    I know that camera is not moving all around on its own !?!?!?  And no one's gonna compare how much the picture he was sent looked very very close to the actual product that they just "Happened to find" at the store!!?!!?
I think I am missing the point here 😂 What is Nordstrom Rack? Why is it so odd that Jeffree’s products are sold there? As a non-American viewer I am in total confusion right now 😂😂😂
I’m subscribed with the bell and didn’t get a notification 🤔
I’d buy these products bc the money wouldn’t be going to him lol
Yes!!!! Please film your reviews. I so miss the honesty!
Yay, collab with shane again ♥️ miss that mumsh
it was so funnnn 😭
I needed this today! ❤
Poor baby….. gtfoh
Love seeing the growth from all those years ago. <3 Appreciating the irony and touching on your previous bad behaviour is what we love to see.
Not sure why you has to buy all of them.
Love you Jeffree! This video reminds me when I first started watching your channel, just down to earth and wholesome! You look beautiful! 🖤💜
I was hoping jeffree would review all the elf stuff that’s come out in the past year. Yes, a little past due, but I always liked hearing his opinions on the affordable makeup brands (that are inexplicably good!)
I ❤ U 😘😘😘😘i love make up
Dude .....i missed shane so fucking much
Yaaaay welcome back shane ❤❤
I loved your reaction and overall tone. You are the Queen for a reason ✨ 💖 Love from Tampa Florida ❤ 🌴 🌈
Karma truly is a bitch. I like Jeffree but I knew when he made fun of KVD about her stuff at TJ Maxx that it was only a matter of time
Yayyy Shane and Jeffrey!!
Stop calling Nordstrom rack Nordstrom...they are two different stores....Nordstrom rack is discount...Nordstrom is not
The difference between jeffree in that flash back tj maxx vid is astounding! He looks so glowy and healthy now
Its cute that you think you have a chance
I can literally see your ego being bruised on camera
The vibes of him continuing to film in the store after being asked not to because "that's his name in thier store" (even tho we all know people get fired over this) and him buying all of the products so other people cant are so fucking bad. People wanna say that hes grown but it's so clear he hasn't. Just a child throwing a tantrum on the internet.
I just want to know why it’s so bad it was there? Not everyone can afford design luxury….
#ShaneFanForever ❤
*2 of the biggest manipulator on Youtube history*
I love the self burn!
Did you ask to see if there was any more stock in the back to make sure you got everything? Just saying...
“3 sum” “no I’m just kidding” yeah ok jeffree
The security guard is filming?
This was such a good video. Can't wait to see what's next.💚
I love that you two are still greatest of friends. True friends always last.
She seems more calm and happy rAther than mad and angsty all the time.
Can we just talk about how much healthier Jeffree is looking lately? MUCH improved.
Is there going to be a Wyoming house tour video?
This was one large pre-launch attention grabbing video because there's better makeup up out there and better people to support. I mean he's got to get the spotlight back on him some way, since he's a fucking dumpster fire and his name is heading down the shitter. Look at the views on this video and it's been up 7 hours already and only 396k (not a lot for him) 🤷🏼‍♂️
9:19 I’m literally laughing until I cry 😂😂😂 that was so epic lmao I’ll NEVER forget that intro!!! You and Shane laughing together...I want to cry. A million memories flooded back 🖤🖤
How come James Charles palette is not at Nordstrom???
🥰❤️🤣
Not irony it’s karma ❤️❤️
I fucking love him I don’t care what people say hes straight  up he  don’t give two shits love it
You forgot your wallet.  So does that mean you forgot you DL and was driving around without it?  Hahahaha.  Classic Jeffery move.
My babiesssss ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish you would post more reviews!
When I found out Conspiracy palette was at Nordstrom Rack I ordered it online IMMEDIATELY! I already have mini controversy & to now have Conspiracy in my JSC collection I’m so happy!! I love you Jeffree! ❤️
I am LOVING that hair though!!!
This is actually a good thing. Some people only shop at these sorts of stores, so you're picking up a while new section of customers that are going to discover your products.
Hey Jeffree!!! 💗
YouTube didn’t alert me that this video was uploaded???? Hmm sounds like a “conspiracy” I hope they aren’t suppressing content 🕵🏽‍♀️ can’t wait for the videos with Shane and make up product reviews missed them both so much! You should review Kylie swim and Kylie baby and some fenty products
This was nice 🥰
I feel like the old Jeffree is comeback. Not the bad one but the funny one. He's so entertained without the drama. I'm so excited to see more videos of him and see the growth.
I think it’s great that we jeffree has stuff in NR. It gives ppl that can’t normally afford his products a chance to use them. It was on the website but I couldn’t find it when i looked yesterday
I wish Shane was legitimately in the video☹️ bitch I’m sad , wtf lol I got all excited ….
I’m currently watching through the Beautiful World of Jeffree Star series (again) sooo this video couldn’t come at a better time.
Omg!!!!!🥰
We already know about what happened to you, you're makeup and you're brand, at this point the elephant in the room is that ugly fucking couch.
Ready for more lol
France and Paris loves Jeffreestar ❤🧡💋. He’s so talented and fun.
Yaaaas!!! Excited to see you and Shane together again 💛💛💛 LETS MAKE YOUTUBE GREAT AGAIN 😆🥰🥰🥰
The growth we see in JS here in this video is beyond words, so proud to see where he will go next! 💚
Shane we didn’t want you back, u like kids
I'll admit it, I bought the mini controversy emerald edition at Nordstrom. I'd always wanted to try your brand, but was afraid to commit to 50+ dollars. Now, I want more!! Your shadows really are so buttery and pigmented! I just wish I could see them in person, instead of online only. That doesn't deter though!
Ohhhh goood lord im so exited hahahha
Please make another collection with Shane!!!
First Jeffree video I've watched In over 2 years and he wasn't a huge dick...  Refreshing to see. 🖤 I don't know that I'll continue watching, but I do wish him well.
Im so happy you guys uploaded
Shane does not deserve to be on this platform anymore, it's better off without him
I miss you & Shane together
thank u, now i want Jeffree and James back pls 😭
I love them for this, It’s nice to see they still are close!!
It’s the no fucks given for me ❤️❤️❤️
it’s about time they come out with a new video
Yesssss❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I want to see jeffree and Dawson together to see the growth. Agree?
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR TWO YEARS FOR THIS 😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 thank you so much. I love you guys, always and forever 🖤🖤
Completely unrelated to the video... but can we just appreciate for a moment that Jeffree HAS to be a SUPER kind person... Anytime I've seen him being out in public,not just in his videos, but he is ALWAYS saying hi to people and being so sweet!    P.S. For all of the ppl still hating on him...it's time to MOVE ON! Everyone has said or done something in their past that would get them dragged for saying today, but it's so obvious that Jeffree Star has changed & grown as a person.... And I personally will continue to support him!💜
i hate the sound of your voice
I’m glad that they just don’t care lol
I know that house is extremely expensive but it does look so cheap inside. I mean, those counters....As an architect student I'm so disappointed, he should find a better interior designer...
Yayyy! So happy to see you two again💕  We all need more laughter in our lives now more then ever 🙂💜
If they have long standing stock, they send it to outlets. Close outs happen like that. If you have an expiration date on it, that date will be short in the outlets. I wouldn't worry about this or feel badly. It give people who don't have the cash to buy as some snazzy place can get your make up.
My favorite thing about a new Jeffree video is  thinking of all the quotes or info drama channels are going to use in their 6 part break down of this video 😂 if you got a good one drop it down below.
What a great series that was! I miss shane so much :(
Love you always sooo creative funny and warm person ❤️
Child groomer
Hi, Jeffrey!  Hope you are happy in Wyoming!  I love farm life, the animals and the smell of hay make me happy!!  Much love to you and the doggos!
Whhhaaat!.. He goes to a discount store & forgets his wallet & asks his mate to buy the make up at the store!.. Lets take the pink rolls & not take my wallet, shame what a bum!.. Then says this is my first purchase at said shop!.. Um no honey your mate brought it! Hope he paid his mate back!.. Not with chicken & waffles either!.. High how are ya!!! 😂😂
I work at the Rack and I was so surprised when I saw we got the Conspiracy palette, considering I ordered when you released lol definitely a great deal. I think it’s great. I see girls excited to find them. Brings me back to the joy the series brought me. I was so invested. Glad you’re having a positive outlook on this! ☺️
I miss shaneXjeffree  I miss them each separately and together. Excited to see what Shane does next. 🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡
I love the eye makeup! I was really hoping for a true Shane & Jeffree colab. For me I miss me some Shane!!
Laura and Manny said that when you Collab with a huge company ends all the products that they Collab with you gets sent to Tk Maxx and places like that.
JS rolls into NorstromRack in his LV slippers. I'm here for it!!
It's refreshing that jeffree was nice to the workers, like even though the company is illegally selling his product, he knows the cashiers/workers have nothing to do with it.
I love you so much ❤️  you have the best personality 🥲
Did he say why he deleted the video with him and lipstick nick?
loooove the clickbait as if Shane did the video with you lmaoooo
Love you Jeffree I'm having a really rough day today watched your video made me feel so much better I totally felt your glow and peacefulness 💖💥💫💛
Uhhh, that isn't the elephant in the room but oooookay
Shane has had a questionable past.
When nordstrom is still too bouj n pricey to shop at🤦🏽‍♀️  Jeffree: thrift store crap👄
Your the sweetest beauty to do that, you rock the makeup world.
I found the whole makeup collaboration about 3 months ago lol I was shook .
Love the wig 😍 💕
Hey at least it wasn’t at ROSS!!!!
We miss you
Love the clickbate thumbnail. Haha clever girl! Xx
How does that slice of pie the size of the empire state building taste?
We need more videos like this ! I missed you being like this
I saw Shane on Jeffree star’s ig so I got here to watch this like 💨 fast fast!
This is the kind of J* content that made me a fan.
Anyone know where he got the couch at the end of the video. I love that couch…
Yey, I can't wiat for the colab video :3
I laughed all the way through but in the best way possible.
I just want to see her clap back Sooooo bad
Its the tune in the back ground
Yes I miss this
You did pay ya friend back right 👀
❤
oh
I wish I can have make up that you don’t need anymore. I can’t afford to buy those beautiful make up of yours.
I'm living for that hair.😍
I'm waiting on that Yak video!!!
Cannot wait for the Shane vids!!
Nice to see you happy Jeffree
Did not know Shane and Ryland had move to Colorado.... But yeah.. when a major company drops someone, they really don't care where the merch goes..
Love your products! Actually happy they made to that store. I snagged a black pig mirror 😍
i’m so sad shane wasn’t actually in the video- wtf
How embarrassing
I've been a Jefree fan for a long time! I personally love everything about his attitude in this video! He really has been showing growth!!!! Love you Jefree!!!😍
Jeffree leave some for the girls on a budget.
I think it's great that his products are being sold there...he will get a whole new customer base. People that could not afford his mu before or maybe never even heard of Jeffree before will/can buy it now.
Shane: heeey... how ya doing...
Got it in TK Maxx in the UK. Conspiracy palette for £16.99 😱 it bangs. I love it
I want to know how the dogs are going. How are they adjusting to the move and hows their health. Please do an update video 🐕🐕🐕🐕
Can someone please explain to me wtf is that rupier scent he mentions
Can we have a good shane and jeffree video? I can’t be the only one to miss seeing them together
Yay I love these two🤍
It’s just ridiculous how much I love jeffree star stay true always xxx
I'm excited for the people that just don't have the budget for JSC stuff and found it in Nordstrom. Wish I could have found it!
That was soo hilarious 😂 love it!
I thought Shane Dawson was gonna be in this video because the thumbnail 😩
I LITERALLY AM GONNA PASS AWAY ICONIC DUO IS BACK
Roll the series!! Lmao
Omg I so wouldn’t mind if some of your make up collection comes to winners in Canada I have so many friends that loves all your stuff but also we’re poor lol
I miss Shane!!
Wait why would you buy all of them though you should’ve left some for the people who still wanted to purchase
Are you filming is still my all time favourite ride or die red lipstick ♥️♥️
He’s too entertaining to be hiding in my opinion
Jeffree  I love you so much you’re my inspiration as a young makeup artist you have really influenced my makeup style as I love watching all your videos and buying all your eyeshadow pallets as soon they drop among numerous other items like concealer your mirrors hoodies and I even got myself a pink yak your pink robe and have your pink back pack  as my school bag. At any time I can recite all your dogs names 😂you are my favorite influencer ever Jeffree like I’m literally obsessed with you I’ve been waiting for you to come to wi or near I would actually die to meet you
Why’d he have to buy all of them tho 😒
Watching this and seeing how far he’s come is really motivating 👏🏼🥺
I’m so happy to see you two back together. This made my day.
Dude the camera work in this is not it. 🥴😵‍💫
Your glow up has been🔥🔥 you're such an inspiration and it makes my heart warm to know you and Shane are still good💕  Love you so much Jeffree!😭❤
I’m so glad you guys are still friends. You seem in such a better place Jeffree it’s great to see it.
❤️❤️❤️
Jeffree: just me, boom, and a security guard 3 some? 😂😂
wait when i saw Shane Dawson was include i automatically clicked who did the same?
Love you ,the new ,Jeffree is so mellow.❤️
That wig is bomb af!!! 🎃
So happy to see a new video from Jeffree! Wishing Shane was actually WITH Jeffree tho! We need more videos like that!
Omy to Nordstrom now! Also, where do you donate makeup to?
so im off to watch the SDXJS series AGAIN whos with me ✊
Am I the only one who clicked this video cause they thought Shane was in it??
Maybe film just using cameras on tripods. Not that was bad, but a little over shaky. Or use a gimbal.
Always nice to hear you guys chat.  Stay safe stay well xx
Loved it again!! Can’t wait for the Jeffree Star Approved video’s!!!
“I wasn’t supposed to film inside the store but I’m privileged”
QUEEEEEN 💅
The people in that Goodwill are about to get a good ass deal! lol
Omg omg, please continue doing this videos! They are fantastic! Thanks! Love u mama
Anyone that doesn't know if discounted stores have Genuine brands that are REAL please know this: Top name brands: Nike adidas puma ect./ micheal kors coach gucci Louis Vuitton Balenciaga eat. Will first take over stock to outlet stores (coach outlet ect/ Nike outlet ect)  Then those outlets will take their overstock to discounted stores (tjmaxx,Marshall's ross ect)  They do this to overstalk has been sitting fo a certain amount of time it has been in the stores  What ppl don't know that those products in discounted stores are real😊   & jeffree is telling the truth yes its in an outlet store (so you're just getting it for cheaper)  Funfact but good fact☺
Questions can you make second CONSPIRACY with shane dawson?
Love this video the house 🧡
Loving yinz
😭 i wish I can buy yours in discount 😭
"Que me and Shane moving to farms" has me dead as hell🤣😂💜🧡
Not here for the Shane clickbait.
Omg I want your LV slippers! So cute, but I live in Hawaii and could never 😭😂 those slippers would be hella humid 🤢😂😂
You should do another documentary on your new life
Yasssssssssss Queen 👑, can't freaking wait to see you guys together again!!!   Finally!!!!!!!!!
I’m seriously so proud of your growth Jeffree! I can’t WAIT to see more of you & Shane!
Please do a winky lux review. I keep seeing it at work (getting stolen) and I wanna know if she's worth stealing.  XD
Was the manager in the white button down? He looked very infatuated   with you haha
Hi.... no points..., I seriously love how aware you are and acknowledge everyone. You’re a good customer!
Love this. I actually got my Conspiracy pallet and a pig mirror in TK Maxx last year. No shame in brands ending up in there. About 80% of my ABH make up came on discount there, plus my Moschino bags and more. It's a great way to introduce yourself to a new make up brand or product without spending a lot of cash.
Uh uh. Don’t act like you didn’t do anything wrong.
Jeffree your ass looks great in that track suit! 💋
Fuck em bring out the yacks
You know what jeffry good for you no matter where your make up is sold it's sold out because its good. I don't care what people say about you cause all those birches live in glass houses
Love this hair on you💗
What happen to Shane?
Your make-up devalued... Just like the words ,she, her , woman. Anybody can use it.
💗💗💗
Been avoiding you for few years. You seem so different in the best way.
Ur stunning 😊 so kind n big hearted ❣
This is frankly frightening! You trust higher end store fronts to maintain the integrity of products they’re selling, to have the manufacturer unaware of the product further solidifies for me that unless it’s purchased directly, the integrity is unknown. Great business strategy for chain stores yes, but is the discount to the consumer worth the risk one takes to purchase “second hand” products😬
Ever since he left LA he diff now
Girl you better be embarrassed! May you both Rest In Peace 😂😂😂.
hi J*    u look so much more content, serene...full of that super juicy inner & outer wellness !!  give those yaks some ear scratches & belly rubs from me    xxx xs a xillion
Miss Shane and his content
💜💜💜💜💜. You seem so much happier. I can’t wait for make up reviews.
Jeffree seems to have grown as a person so much! They seem so genuinely happy and I’m so proud❤️
Hide your CATS!
I wish I could get a copy of the conspiracy pallete. Your make up is amazing!
The editing was done really well on this!
i'll have to check next time I'm in there just to see. That Mini Controversy has the green shade in it so the second iteration of it.
I will kill to get that red shade!
I loved the video I missed you! But I got nausea sadly from the shaking and zooming. I tried hard to listen only. That’s the reason I could not watch Shane, Ryland videos. If this was intentional pls have mercy🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 I know you have all the gadgets to keep it stable. Shane’s an excellent creator but the camera shaking is too much. I luv you and everything you do. But if no one tells u they are not your friend! There are reddit posts dedicated about getting sick from Shane videos.
I got the big controversy palette in tkmaxx in the Uk for £24 I was so happy as I couldn’t get it when it initially launched 🙌
Eating my carrots as I realize this was a reaction video at the end.  CARROTS YALL SWEET CRISPY HEALTHY AFFORDABLE EASY SNACK. EAT YOUR CARROTTS. BABY ONES, petite baby ones, large ones, rainbow carrotts too!
Wait... So is Jeffree back to California officially?
I miss videos like this!! ❤️
Looking fabulous as always Jeffree!
We all know how you feel about your makeup being discounted. I get complimented so much when I wear your eyeshadow.
So you’re telling me the conspiracy pallet was a conspiracy…
I love how much more happy Jeffree is after talking to Shane🥰 they’ve got an awesome friendship😊
Imagine buying your own products in a store...
Well I wish your products are i my country 😥😥😥🇹🇳🇹🇳
This video made me genuinely happy. So glad to see you joyful ❤️
Can we get a part 2 where Shane checks out a store in Colorado to see if the collar is there?
Whose house was this filmed in?
Character development at its finest. I love you, Jeffree. Love from the Philippines🇵🇭 ❤
“No points.” To the cashier 😭😭😭
WAIT I COMMENTED BEFORE THE VIDEO WAS DONE 😹😹 I CANT WAIT FOR YALLS VIDEOS
Handled...Like an Empress periodt
Is Shane back..?
I miss y’all together please get together soon 🤌🏻😭
Why are we not friends yet I’m literally your child @iamtealong
Nordstrom Rack is the boujee discount store though. I still can't afford it lol. So, you're still winning.
Love that you two are both back… I miss 2019
The series theme music took me back, now I have to re-watch it
I thought Shane was in here ): but I know he’s probably not ready yet
Me: *runs to Nordstrom Rack*
You can do The to me I am a charity 😂😂🤣 I call my self broke A$$ mother of 4 who is also a makeup junkie 🤣🤣
I got 2 pig mirrors for 11 dollars each one at Nordstrom 💕💕💕💕💕
I love you <3
Yessss. Normalize slippers in public. I'm not the only one lol
What will you do with these pallettes? A poor fan could have gotten one :( I got my first pallette on sale, it was the mini conspiracy! I cannot afford full price :(
you are filming with Shane woohoo 🎉 🥳🤩💖 can’t wait, it makes me happy 😊
I would rather have them sell the over stock products instead of throwing it in the trash. The girls can get a good deal on JSC collection .
YES! Jeffree makeup reviews PALEEEASE! And OF COURSE Jeffree PLUS Shane videos! ❤️
I’m glad your back bitch ! 💗💕
I feel like a wealthy person when i get the most expensive thing from the clearance rack
Jeffree looks gorgeous…. The shaky camera didn’t do him any favors. Just gave me a headache and made me not finish the video :(
you're so gorgeous.  Love the lipstick color.
💕💕💕
Shane saying “See you at the rack” at the end of the call💀💀💀
Awww I’ve missed you and Shane
I Love you Jeffree 💚❤️💚❤️🥰😘 I seen the pig mirrors ect even online but I didn't buy it because I won't support that. I support you 😘
Don't sweat the small 💩 because where ever your make up is being sold at you're still making that money!! Keep the faith and STAY POSITIVE!!
Omg put the camera on a tripod bc this is giving me a headache from shaking so bad
embarrassing
I watched Shane's series again after I heard yall were doing this video. Iconic. So much has changed since then. You both seem happier getting away from LA!
Imagine going to a Goodwill and finding JS make-up!! 😂💄I honestly think they would price it even higher than Nordstrom...💋
Can’t wait to see Shane visit Wyoming
Such an awesome video ♡
Thought u would mention wtf happened to the deleted video but nope
I'm so glad to see how far you've come, and omg shaneeeee I miss him so much! 😢
How about, "Sorry KVD, I was an @$$hole"
Okay now that I watched more of the video it makes sense but I still think it sucks 🤪
🧡🍂💛🤎🤎❤️💛🍂🧡❤️💛🧡🧡🍂🍂❤️💛🧡🍂💛❤️💛🍂🧡🤎🤎🧡🍂💛🤎❤️🍂🤎💛🍂🧡
Love you guys tooo🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😇
"Roll the series"🤣🤣☀️
This is such a short video lol sigh
The mini controversy was the 1st JSC product I bought. I wish I could go back to the  time this series was poppin' off
"See you at the Rack!" LOL Shane! ❤💕❤
I may have to go and see if I can get the mini with put it back since I don't have that one lol my luck though I won't find it 😅
I want to work with your company, how would I apply? I’ve been inspired by your products and on how you make them. You’re my idol. I’m so happy that you keep in moving forward in life no matter what, you don’t let no drama or anything stop you from living your life, you keep your head up high. I’ve learned so much from you and thank you (:
I want Jeffree to react to Shane and Ryland's new house when it's finished!! 💚💚💚
*JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND CARES FOR YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY EVERYONE*
That sucks because you lose on the revenue how is that possible.?
*Jesus Christ loves you and cares for you have a good day everyone*
Clearance store and Nordstrom rack don’t belong in the same sentence lmao
GROWTH
I love the new Jeffree ❤️
Well I think that people that can't afford to buy your make up would appreciate some JSC make up at a discount.  Not everyone can afford to pay $60 for an eyeshadow palette. . But I love that you are going to donate to charities!  At one time I had to stay at a homeless shelter about 15 years ago, and the retched ass staff took anything and everything of any value that was donated, I certainly hope the places that you decide to donate to, doesn't do that. Because that's just wrong, taking away from people that are truly in nee c of some help.
wh0 is filming?
9:18 had me dead, I really thought we were gonna get a clip from the series 😂🥺
The coments are moderated af youre not fooling anyone Jeffree
Love you ❤️ You're the best 💖
Jeffree? When you sell your house, can I have your brown couch? 😁
This video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This energy & positivity 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This happiness 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This cute interaction between you and Shane and Boom 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I will never let go how people treated Shane. I understand he made some mistakes but they were a very long time ago :(. They both look so happy
Wished I could find his product on discount! Then I could actually afford it! Ha ha
Shane is trying to squeeze him self back to YouTube 😂
You have been gone too long! Love you! My son opened for you years ago said you were a pain but he respects and follows you too.
i thought shane made a comeback.. 😔
This is interesting
Honestly I miss jeffrees videos 🥺 his reviews, his store trips, his dogs.
Dindnt- didnt he um sell that housee?
Awesome video, I was so looking forward to this. You look absolutely amazing and so very beautiful. It was so nice to see you and Shane together again, Love you 💜
Haters can hate if they want but I’m here for the Jeffree & Shane content and NEED lots more!
I would be honored and so stoked to have any of this makeup, regardless of where its from.
Please Come Back To California. You Are So Missed. ♥️🥺♥️
We love u soo much Jeffree 💓 💗
Can't wait to see you and Shane doing videos together again! I'm here for it! ❤
I LOVE YOU HMC
I couldn’t believe how I watched them rise, fall, then rise on top in 2019 and then fall in 2020 but I hoped they would keep making videos and be entertaining for the fans like me that stuck around. Here we are now, I think moving was a good idea. They both seem happier but I miss Shane’s videos.
You need to go back and do a full face of make up at Nordstrom rack ❤️🥰
Did he ever say why YouTube removed his last video? I didn't get to watch it :(
How emaciated JS looked in the old clip. Now he’s got the CL GLOW!,
You say it’s not Shane’s come back and that’s not what this video about okay I get that but why put him on the photo . Oh yeah cause it’s better to be talked about then not talked about at all . Come through PR moves love that for you lol 😅😁
Jeffery Star at the Dollar Tree ???  😱  Coming soon to a store near you… 😳
Definitely DID NOT know Nordstrom was considered “thrift store” like tj maxx 😂😂
Yay! I missed you guys
I can’t figure out whether he’s happy about his product being at Nordstrom rack. I LOVE the rack lol there are much worse places to have your stuff sold.
You didnt address why you deleted the other video
Hi poor person here ... I thought  Nordstrom  was like super expensive... so ... like ... what's the problem? I dont understand???
I miss your videos and seeing u thankful u are doing much better and love all your stuff
What shade are you wearing on your eyes in this?  So pretty!
makes me so happy to see them glowing and still friends
Yesss 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
I live in Casper, welcome to the Neighborhood!
I needed this. Thank you for letting us in on your wild adventure of living life the best way you want and can.  You have helped me  get through alot of rough moments.  Like today . I am single mom not able to work have sister with autism Asperger's and pregnant also has a 2 year old little girl .  Found out my water and swere are going to be turne off I can't get any help from my county becuz no appointments,  my gas is off  . The utility  company  do not give any Fs  tried to get on payment plan but they won't accept  anything less then $1,500.  I am scared  . I can't  do anything  about  it like there is nothing  and not having control is scary.  Your make up is creative and beautiful.   I can't  wait till I can go back to school  so I can finish becoming  a nurse so I can not be scared of having no basic human needs be able to provide for my sister  my son and nieces.  And to buy your products.  Thinking of taking my self out the game but then all my work I have done yo get my sister help she needs would be for nothing.  I don't know what to do I cried to point I'm dehydrated  my 4 year old little boy doesn't understand and when he said what's wrong I cried harder. I failed  him my self my sister her daughter.  The autism foundation is a joke. The MR/DD board another joke, since she can pour bowl of cereal she is good.  But my point is thanks  I know I'm not the fan you want I'm sure. But you give me inspiration to find something to hold on to and pull your self up, not being able to speak your mind, not being able to trust, not being able to be you with out someone having a problem.  Thank you for everything.  The few min I can pretend like nothing is wrong and then back to knowing I can't change my situation  I don't know how much longer I can do this. If anyone cares
🤍💖❤️
No I love Jeffree but Shane is diablo
I found an unopened conspiracy palette at a Goodwill 🤷‍♀️
I saw his products at Nordstrom at the mall in Arlington a couple months ago.  I was like 👀
JEFFREE LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL WITH LESS LIP FILLER ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Haha wow. Um sold at discount store an freaking cant pay.haha sad . Click bait us with shane. This sucks babe. Ugh
Dang it I thought Shane was actually gonna be in it 🙄 this would of got so many views if he was
🤣🤣🤣
Something wholesome that I still LOVE about Jeffree & Shane filming together ❤️‍🔥 aside from all the drama and messiness in the past they are good people & they seem much happier now !! :)
I know you probably won’t read this and you maybe won’t care but I’ll always be a trusted fan / friend from day 1 til the end.   Love you wishing you tons of happiness since the MySpace days!
I live in Colorado omg!!!!!
Finally!!!!!
I love this new Jeffrey, you can just see the difference in just that video alone.
I'm actually sooo happy rn lol
Omg I’ve missed you and Shane!! Yes!! 😂😍
So incredibly happy to see you and Shane still friends, can't wait to see a video with you two actually together. So happy you didn't let the Trashy vile trolls stop you both from doing what we love watching. 💚😘
So beautiful to see the growth within you  , you are such a beautiful inspiration of courage and strength. 💗💗💗 Excited to see the new reviews and more from your talented self 💚💗💚💗💚💗💚💗
OMG
I still think the “shade” at Kat’s palette is fucking hilarious 😭😭😭 it was perfect comedic timing & he didn’t even say anything lol
The slippers tho lol
I loved this video 😅💗
💖💖💖💖💖
Can’t wait for Jeffree Star approves videos and just videos in general You changed my life never forget that !! I’ve stuck beside you through it all ever since Shane’s documentary guuurl you could K someone and I would still support you haha but yeah I can’t wait for regular uploads you do so much for the community and you are a true  ORIGINAL! Never forgot 🇬🇧 ⚡️
I own these already but if I find a Jeffree Star pallet or makeup item in any discount store my butt is buying !!!!
JEFFREE, I TAGGED YOU IN A VIDEO. I WORK AT NORDSTROMRACK AND THEY'RE LEGIT YOURS.
How can anyone sit like that for so long? Can't be comfortable.
I’m so proud of you Jeffree. For you to be able to say I said that because I was hurt shows how much you have focused on yourself and your mental health and I’m so happy for you
My face when I saw Shane on the thumbnail 😮
Jeffree and Shane will always be one of the most iconic duo’s ever
I love seeing Shane and Jeffree together again! I've had a taste and now I need more!!!🖤🐷⭐
When Jeffree says... "That's mine" about the dog hair!! I totally could relate 🤣🤣🤣
Yawn. I seriously hope you two delete your channels
Good on you & Shane taking a negative & turning it into a positive… I’m so glad the fun.. the crazy.. the out there & of course the gorgeous.. talented amazing Jeffree is B..A..C..K.. I’m living for this.. thank you for coming back even more amazing then you were b4…. 🥰
I went ahead and got a Mini Controversy pallet this week. Most of what they had on the rack had been opened so I had to search for one that didn’t seem open. I found it in Roseville, Ca
🖤🖤🖤
Love his makeup...don't exactly like him as a person...but whatever he's makeup is super pretty
i wish my car could be pink but i can’t afford it :(
He never addressed the deleted video loool
I'm so glad him and Shane are still friends, they make such amazing content together.
I’m super bummed I still haven’t gotten the ryland liquid lip yet! Guess I will have to go to the rack
I love how you reactioned, laughing about the situation and learning about the ugly things from the past. You rock!
I loved this video!!! It feels like the old Jeffree and Shane 🥰🥰 can’t wait for more content!
Goodwill is a for profit business with a history of NOT helping the truly needy.  Please consider, in the future, donating to women's shelters' battered person's organization, other non-profit agencies who aren't just going to profit off the donations without helping people. This is purely my opinion, but it is a strong one that I always try to share. It's so nice to see you back and healthy.
Barbie vibes Love the hair💞
You should have gone into the Marshalls that was next to that store, they would have likely had your makeup too. I've seen JSC in many T.J.Maxx locations and Marshalls the same company.
Oh the irony is real. I’m glad you replayed the absolute shade ‘sarcastic’ friends go to die comment. If the shoe fits 🥴 but hey, it was a cash grab! And y’all still got the last laugh.
I’m so proud of Jeffree….he’s def a better person💜 a Queen.
I love this. Love u and shane together. This just proves ppl wrong.
Omg omg omfg!!!! I have been waiting!!! So excited Shaun is back!!!!!!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
I can tell you why. People see your label on the mail and they open the package at the bottom changing the tape and grab what they can. I had ordered 256$ worth of product a track suit and the pallet and hoodie. And everything but the hoodie was stolen. Nothing from the postal service or your customer support helped me. So a hoodie cost me 256$.
Yasss Pootah!!! A total gangsta!!!
Honestly, when you’re hurt that a friend back stabbed you… you don’t care how you throw the shade… honestly I don’t blame him…. Can’t wait for more videos :)
I don’t like how comfortable everyone is about Shane returning…..
At least Jeffree wears a mask while going out unlike other influencers
Glad you finally ditched all those users you used to call friends.  Why on earth would you support so many hangers on?  All they wanted was free plane rides, free parties, free, free, free.  I hate to say this but I did tell you Tic Tok was a curse,  anyway happy you’re back with a few trusted people including Shane.  Life is too short.  Trolls are always going to be losers but they also have nothing to do with their lives and will never accomplish a damned thing, not even name recognition.  Be strong, be safe, be smart.  Remember everybody has something to hide.  People are jealous of success.  Good for you!
I can’t wait till you go to Colorado and see their house. I love the moves you both did. ♥️♥️
"it's me, him and a security guard threesome"  the guy holding the camera is like wtf am i chopped liver? lmfao
Thought you were answering questions?
I would love them to do a other collaboration again.
Ur and Shane collab been in Tk maxx in uk for past two years lol
I miss you and Shane together
I'm glad we have good editing and camera work again lol Nice to see you back
Love ❤️ boom, think it’s so lovely he’s donating it to charity go Jeffery
As soon as I saw Shane in the thumbnail I knew this video was purrrrrrfect 🐱
No
Jeffree, I’m so happy you were honest and transparent about your makeup being in Nordstrom. The drama channels were going nuts with assumptions about what you were going to say. Some people are going to eat their words. Lol.
lol
It also allows people that maybe couldn't afford full price, the opportunity to enjoy your products. Isn't that a win? :)
Am glad I been your loyal sub thru the years and controversies and ALWAYS have faith in you. Am actually so proud of you addressing the old silly comments, hey we all human and we make silly errors from time to time. I feel that you get better and better as the years go by. You have flourish into a proper young fellow.  best wishes to you and your family and the babies(puppies).  XOXO 😘
Can we talk about how Jeffree low-key hyped his products made it to Nordstrom rack. Jeffree should really start selling stock to store companies himself to expand his consumers
I think you handled this graciously. I’m not a big Shane fan, but I can’t judge I had friends who were toxic too
BACK BACK I SAY BACK you're not welcome here predator BACCCKK🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
love you, jeffree!
Is Nordstrom Rack like a rich persons Ross? 😂
Interesting business lesson here: In future collab contracts, have your lawyers get you first dibs on backstock, or at least include language about being notified and/or having a say in exactly what happens to it.
Come to Iowa they need to be shook up big time
trinkle
Can't wait to see the 90 year old Mr. Star still wearing make up. Love you
I got it from their online store lol
Jeffree will always be a icon, like him or not he makes quality stuff 👏👏
LOVE YOU GIRLYYY 💗
The change, the change in the way you look, the change in your attitude, the real friendships with Boom and Shane, you have put in some work, be proud of yourself. You are doing so good! ❤️💜

Would your products be in Florida?
Such a fun video! Miss these fun times with he community.
jeffree is so fake lmao
YASSSSSSSS MY QUEENS
wait shane moved to Colorado!?? did they get rid of that house
Jeffrey and Shane!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why does he keep saying it’s “his” baby etc…Shane created this line of makeup, Jeffrey just bankrolled it. But whatevs
Me 🏃‍♀️ too Nordstrom Rack lol, love you gorgeous! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Awesome video. Love the new Jeffrey! Loved the old one but this is makes me so happy!
Nordstrom Rack is no TJ Maxx, girl!!! It's boujeeee bitch! 😘
yaaaaas you guys are back!!! I've been waiting for you ily
Roll the series! 🤣🤣🤣
Shane and Jeffree you are true goals  Keep doing you guys 💕💕💕
Jeffree looks like he’s changed and grown :)
I feel like someone will be fired
🙌YES !!!! Shane and Jeffrey together again love it 😍
You're literally a millionaire, but yet expect others to pay for your shit.
The " I don't get paid enough to deal with this." "This is above my paygrade"
Love the video missed you guys doing videos together
💕💕💕💕💕💕💅🏻
So nice to see you and Shane together again.
Soooo youre that greedy that you’d buy all the products that “we” cant afford normally so we Go to them to but it. Ok. I see you how you work.
Jeffree looking hella healthy!!! Love you boo!!!
i missed shane’s laugh and the ‘ooooh my god’ so much 🥺
Jeffree: $10 isn't a good deal but you want us to pay 18 lolol
jeffree look att you glowww
Jeffree: "It's just me, Boom, and a security guard." Camera man: 😥
God damn girl! I am so fucking proud of you and everything you’ve become. Seriously. I am here for 2021 Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You shouldn’t of bought them all Jeffree. You’ve now robbed someone the chance of being able to get some of your products in a budget they may be able to afford. Not very fair tbh
I love how he still makes time to take pictures with fans. Da best!
Everyone jumping back on the train. Pathetic. Imagine if we could alll buy a ranch in Wyoming disappear and comr back months later sins erased haha.  Booooooooo also tax the rich.
Wait, did you & Shane know the pig mirrors were at the Rack? You said to Shane “And the pig mirrors are all gone. They are a hot seller” & Shane just said yay- if you didn’t know it was there- wouldn’t Shane have said “How did they get the mirrors”? or something to the effect? Did you talk to Shane & fill him in before you called him for the video? It just sounded very strange for somebody that didn’t know their stuff was at the Rack.
I’m dying at how in the closed caption it translates Nordstrom’s Rack to “North of Iraq”
Can't WAIT to see videos of you & Shane💜
YES ICONSSSS
AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
See you in THE RACK!
So many file issues for 13 mins :(
Omg so good to see you and shane together again
You look beautiful as always. Hope your well and happy.
Literally only clicked on the video cause of Shane in the thumbnail. I was hoping he’d be in the vid just to check up on how he’s doing.
I want to be selfish and say never stop making content because i love it/you so much but if you ever do stop know that i will be a forever supporter of whatever you decide to do and you have alot of ppl rooting for ur happiness. Loved this video and even more excited to see you and Shane🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜
13 minutes, ive been waiting for god knows how long for this and its 13 minutes long, really?
I AM SO HAPPY THEYRE BACK
Literally 2 seconds into the video I was like “WHEREEEEE SHANE??” (Great video just disappointed that he’d not in the video besides the FaceTime call at the end.)
I'm so happy you and Shane remained friends throughout all the bullshit 🥰 Happy to see you both thriving!
This video felt like a meeting that could’ve just been said in an email
digging the editing on this one...feels like the old days.
Love youuuuuuuuu
Jeffree still rocks 100
Lowkey why did he buy all of them, now someone else can’t buy them
Jeffree this fills my heart with so much joy! To see how much you have grown and changed. In life no one’s perfect but I remember seeing you on MySpace and was always a fan of you and your confidence. I don’t think anyone has a perfect life but what is truly magical is knowing when you need to personally change! Always a fan and supporter of your work! 💜💜💜💜💜
We LOVE to see Jeffree and Shane together!! 🥰🥰..we need MORE!!!
Wee need a video of you and Shane ASAP
Y'all are so delusional in these comments
The “threesome- no just kidding” had me rolling😂😂
YAAAAAASSSSSS!!!!
12:01
I think it's wonderful you are donating the make up. I admire your creativity and passion for whatever you are doing.
IDC I MISS SHANE :(
It’s probably because of Shane 😂😂😂
Youtube has been so stale lately finally a video Im interested in. Respectfully
Who was filming when you were home cause damn they need to cool it with the skakey camera it’s really irritating.
This camera person… no
Saw shane in the thumbnail
"Are you filming" is my go to red, hopefully it's kept in the normal collection
Maybe not that color
I wish I could find really nice makeup accidentally put it in a store cheaper so I can buy it I can't be out here spending $50 on the eyeshadow palette but maybe if I found it for 19.99 I could🤣
Yes Shane Colorado!! ❤️ Also Jeffree!! Donate anywhere but goodwill 😅 they bad
When jeffree said "roll it" and the series intro started playing i started laughing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Appreciate jeffree’s growth. Still not happy with Shane, could have used a way better apology and acknowledgment of his horrible actions, but I do hope he continues to grow. I wish him and ryland the best. He’s not my cup of tea, that’s all I have to say about it.
Don't donate to the goodwill please!!! There are a ton of women's and children's shelters .... Those momma's would love to be able to have makeup for job interviews or to just feel beautiful and deserving 💕💕💕
down bad
It's so nice that through everything these two have been through over the last year to see Shane and Jeffree still friends and getting through the drama.
I could care less about the internet says about him I love and support him❤️❤️💕
I love when he said that he was going to go donate his makeup to Goodwill and other thrift stores.  There are a lot of women's shelters that will take gently used or new makeup for the residents, as many of those victims have had to leave home with just the clothes on their back.  This just shows how far Jeffree has come as a person and it is amazing to see the transformation.
I can't wait to see more , coming here everyday to see if video post .
LA must feel absolutely stifling after the freedom of Wyoming. Stay where it's real,  Jeffree. It's good for the soul and it shows.
🥺🥺🥺🥺 I missed y’all
Bring the "Are you filming" shade back please! Even under another name, it was BOMB.
Jeffery this was the healthiest video! Its good to see you smileing and laughing. #fuckdrama
We love humble Jeffree💅✨
You seem SO happy right now!  I think moving out of state to was the best thing you could ever do for yourself .  I know things can look one way online, but be completely different in reality, but I truly hope that things are going good, and you’re  happy. ❤️🤦🏼‍♀️
I love your grown ass attitude now  Don’t miss the old Jeffree that’s for sure
So happy to see shane back and you too 💙
I thought it was supposed to be Jeffrey and Shane together going to Nordstrom rack
Not a big deal man. I see Lancôme, Dior, etc at Marshall’s in Canada. I’ve even seen Hermes perfumes.
What Jeffree isn’t telling us is how items get to Nordstrom Rack. It’s product that DOES NOT SELL, meaning people aren’t interested anymore lol. Jeffree won’t say this because he would have to admit people aren’t interested anymore. He’d never do that.  If Jeffree truly cared about his fans and supporters, he wouldn’t be making such a big deal about this. It allows for people to buy his products at a cheaper price. Him buying it all because he was embarrassed is just pathetic.
Why isn’t Shane there …
THIS is how you take things with stride!  You know your formulas are the BEST!  “When someone with pink hair walks into the store with a camera”… it’s kinda like “Who do you think you are”…  Haha… biatch - I am THE Jeffree Star and uh - you’re welcome 👑  Love Shane’s ending “See you at the Rack”… too funny! ❤️
The whole world pushed so hard for this video to be made it almost seemed forced at one point but ok.
Everybody grows everyday and I love seeing him chance because it reminds everyone that at the end of the day we are all still human... I watched Jeffree all the time... I love how he does his make up and despite I fail trying to copy him, he will always be a star in my eye's... Jeffree I need an autograph!!! Please!!!
Bargain basement trash
Wow I got that eye shadow wasn't cheap
I miss shanee
We need more videosssss we missed you
Ok, im back watching you ☺️⚡ The internet it's been so boring without you guys
Please do cruella de ville Halloween costume
If you want to donate some to me I'd be forever grateful 🙏
The camera guy made me run to the comments so I wouldn’t feel dizzy from how shakey he is lol no offense dude just get a tripod idk
Can you donate to me lol 😆
Thus is what I needed
I always wanted to own a Jeffery star product now I can afford one now where’s the Nordstrom in Knoxville
... 13 minutes? I waited on the edge of my seat for a 13-minute video?!
More JS videos need Thin Lizzy as the soundtrack.
Stars like Jeffree will not be born anymore under the current fascist regime of "social justice"....Comedy is almost dead. Most people have had enough. The answer is to simply ignore the idiots who try to police what we say and who we watch. Neither Shane nor Jeffree have done anything bad. Don't apologize for anything Jeffree.
It’s spooky season and that KVD Tjmax comment came back to haunt him
Some people it's nice for them to be in a store for kids who have grandparents  who buy them makeup but can't buy it online. Like my mamaw doesn't  know how to order stuff online
I ALWAYS KNEW those two were TRUE friends. There’s no way you can fake the chemistry they had whenever they made a video. My favorite will always be Kylie Skincare review. I laughed so hard! I think Shane should be his editor because he’s got to trust him and he’s got the talent. And they mesh very well together.
i was expecting shane in the vid... not you click baiting me 😅😂
To go and buy your OWN makeup products at a store is so badass, boss shit 🔥🔥
💜🧡❤️💝
Wait I love your hair 😍
Love you Jeffree . I really want you and Shane to be like "business as usual" on YT and ignore the haters.
I want to buy that collection!! Please bring it backkkk
7:15 I love this part hehe
Man I miss watching these videos. That's it that's all I had to add. 😅
Ummm how is it “not a good deal” I think it’s a hella good deal, JS lol but don’t get it twisted u still & ALWAYS will be my bitch ♥️🖤♥️🖤😘💋
I miss fun videos like this
13 mins 😑🙃
" Tj max is where all my friends go to die " LOL sees Kats pallet " O Uh O haha " LOL Damn he did not lol
So good to see you back and happy!! Missed your uploads so much… roll on the next few months and catch up with you the dogs. Just remember you are fabulous, head held high and keep smiling ❤️ Doesn’t matter where your make it is sold your a star ⭐️ xx
So Jeffrey already made his money off of this makeup?
The song playing is “The boyz are back in town” Whoa💋💋💋
Omg you're back uploading 😍 yaaasss
I love theenergy
I'm so glad I wasnt with Jeffery when he left his wallet at home coz if  he asked for mine it would of declined at the house.
Not gonna lie… I bought the big pallet, the small pallet, all the lipsticks and Gloss, girl the entire collection when I saw it at the Rack 😩
We waited for this bs video
Our pig mirrors are hot sellers!!! *show footage of us moving to farms* 😆 🤣
Everyone flooding Nordstrom rack today lol
Why is shane in the thumbnail? dont we hate him?
How nasty, first testing waters on his husband podcast and now with jeffree lol
🖤
Why would he leave the house without his wallet?
I'm so happy you're back.   I had no idea how much I missed seeing you post.
I luv his attitude now, his maturity. I believe he responded to this the perfect way.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omgggv yeyyyy we miss you so muchhhhhhhb jsgxjaiznaizh haha😘
NOOOO SHANE NOOO
Finding it in the clearance section? Exactly where it belongs 👏
Can we please get another Jeffrey/ Shane collab! Loved you 2 working together! !! I loved the series it was the best!
My favorite duo is back 🥺
I have both mini pallettes but that's a great deal for Christmas presents
I feel so poor, I can’t even afford $67 worth of makeup lol
I have been a fan since Beauty Killer was released and the amount of growth i have watched throughout the years is amazing. People expect influencers to be these perfect creatures who do no wrong but we as people mess up and thats ok as long as you know what you have done and do better. Much love xoxo
OMG vlogs are back. I missed them so much
Omg I’m so excited for them to make more videos together! ❤️
The look on Shane's face when Jeffree showed him what was there that he bought was crazy... Shane's shocked look was priceless , but how do you forget your wallet when you would go shopping and would be planning to buy stuff.
Growth baby growth! And with age comes wisdom! Love it!
You look amazing 😍😍 thank you for a new video and the cherry is shane is back 😍😍
Love you Jeffre! Can't wait to see more collaborations with Shane :)
Hahah still love the palette tho! 😅😅
You shud be happy Nordstrom has your makeup?? Wtf is the problem??
Owww los amo juntos!! Son unos divinos!! Más videos juntos please!!!!!💜🖤😍
Omg you are my everything I have watched all your videos over and over I love you so so much I’m 11 and love makeup and love all the way you show how to do it and look good. Please please give me a shout out. You are my everything love you have a great day and great weekend love you 😍 my name is Lucy Jane  and you are so amazing 🤩💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Nice to see you. You look well.
I love 💕 your wig you so awesome 👏🏽
ARENT YOU NOT EM-BARAZZED? THIS IS SO EMBARAZZZING!
clickbait… shane is not in the video…
I live for the moments when I see Shane 🤩😅😊
Hearing both you and Shane laugh brought so many memories back
I miss your videos babe 🤍
I heard its REALLY bad and cheap quality. Aside from that all the scandals.
But james charles hasn't hit nordstrom rack!
Hey when you're back in Los Angeles let me know I'll buy you a burger 🍔
i know you don't need to hear this but that was the best way to handle this, and you are right people who can't afford to try your makeup now can. Might be an idea for the future to release some with department stores like nordstrom rack or tj maxx just so people who can't afford it can experiance your makeup because its all about the people who adore it right? bigger better broader its almost time :) for the world to be able to experiance your formula's.
Yay.  Now poor people can look and feel good about them selves too. I love Jeffree and want some more music out of him...hint hint
You deserve all the happiness you’re getting and you’ve been such an inspiration I love you❤️❤️
Any one threw my Jeffery star mirror like that I'd bitch slap them.
This is good for those who can’t afford it right from his website.
Been waiting for this! Thank you 🙏💞
Honestly how much healthier does Jeffree look in this video compared to the clip from the Tj maxx one. She’s a whole new moment and we live
My first thought was oh god
Lol if you stop at 3:25 you’ll see you missed one 😵‍💫
Most powerful friendship in the media ♡
im so happy and proud to see the growth!
😊I'm glad he even donated the make up I'm proud of how he is has been acting about the situation
ILY JEFFREE ❤️ (and Shane) 🤣
I'm so excited for Shane and Jeffree to start posting again OMG
Clicked as soon as I saw the notification. I wanna know the chisme
When I saw the thumbnail ur girl got me choking 😭😂
Jeffree seems so much happier and grounded. So proud of you, sis! Keep up that growth! We are NEVER done growing.
We have a charity that needs help in the U.K.??? X
LOVE THE NEW VIDEO! CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE ICONIC CONTENT! We missed you!
“just me, him and a security guard” cameraman: am i a joke to you?
“cue me and shane moving to farms”   LMAOOO
Leave them there so I can come get one 😭
Nooooo we waited so long to get that collection at full price! 😡 love ya though ❤️
FINALLY THE WORLD IS HEALING
Miss these types of videos, so glad there back :)
❤❤❤❤!!!!
so… we are all just gonna let shane back in? hell no. i love your channel and you, but not shane
Yessss can't wait for the review videos 😩
FINALLY F*CK
I love you 😭😂❤️
Jeffree even LOOKS healthier than he did in that old video with the KVD makeup.  The move to Wyoming was the best decision ever.  Keep it up, Jeffree, we are so glad to have the happy and healthy you back 💖
I’m so sorry but I gotta say it the wig is hideous
We need a third series with you and Shane. The fallout …
If we don’t get another Shane x Jeffree makeup collab I’ll be pissed
The joy that this brought me is indescribable.
This is crazy hehe a whole contreversy moment! 😁😝
Loved this type of upload 😍
I am very HAPPY to see you in a better mind set ... But .. this is going to sound extremely selfish but I miss the old Jeffrey... The one who just didn't give two craps of what they said and just was a beast! ... But on the other hand I'm very happy that he's gone through a lot of growth which puts me in that position where I don't even understand what I'm feeling for him right now 😂🤭
I m do happy jefree star cosmetics came to India. Thank you
Ahhhhh Shane is backkkkkl!!!!!
I purchased a JS lip gloss & paid over $20+shipping it dried my lips I can get the same look 4a lot less if I wore that green eye shawdow it'll look like my gallbladder busted😂
Still don't get why he's SO excited to have his makeup sold in Nordstrom Rack (a discount store)
AAAAAhhhhhahahahhahahahahah spilly’s screaming
The editing quality with all the right cuts for shane series intro is so good! Good audio and camera moves! Jeffree and shane seems genuine and not pretentious about it.
Loved this! The growth is so apparent. You took “cancelled” and made it yo biotch! & we are totally here for it! Can’t wait for all of the new content! Jeffree Star Approved vids are a must! ⭐️
"Roll the series!" *music plays* 😂😂
Oh she’s got a clearance bin … WAL MART
I miss Shane so much!!!
Nordstrom rack / TJ Maxx are some of my favorite stores - often where things from the “real” aka overpriced stores like Nordstrom move their overflow to at a fraction of the price. Truly, it’s a shame you’re shading it. Next time you pass on an over inflated item, realize it will go there in 6 months or less and half the price. #karma shame you haven’t learned the lesson about who your friends are - reflect on your character. With the controversy, be glad it isn’t at Ross / $ store.
Are you saying we gonna see u and shane together again? Pls
I love this unbothered and non messy Jeffree. Yassssss Queen. Keep this positive energy 💞
Makes my heart happy to see Jeffrey and Shane together again ❤💯🐷
You are healing! I love it. Keep being vulnerable and open I love it. Keep loving your AUTHENTIC self! ❤️❤️Also I wanna see you and Shane in a video again that would be amazing
LMAOO is it just me or did boom really not wanna pay 😂😂😂
Please find a new camera man. A travesty
What's such a big deal about this store?
Jeffree literally buying out the store of his own makeup so no one else can buy it discounted
I love you Jeffere❤️❤️❤️❤️ every video you post it’s a god sent. Good luck on your future plans😊😊😊
Finalllyy bitch you uploadeddd!!!
Jeffrey I'm fucking missed you 😭😭😭😭😭 please upload more videos. Be active again 👏👏👏👏👏
We love you so much Jeffree ✨💞
Love you Jeffree !!   -Hawaii
Finally , some teA. THANKS GOD...
That’s so sweet of you to take it with a good heart and donate it💗💗💗
Loveeeeeeeeeee you & Shane together 💗💋💖❤️✨🥺🌈🍿
Good night
Your hair is fabylous and your lipstick
Now I’m gonna go watch some old videos because I need more Jeffree in my life
Can film smoking videos too 😭
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so happy Shane was in this vid can’t wait for his return !! 😭
PLSSSD
Warms my heart to see you two talking. Bff’s ❤️
I have missed your videos!! 💜💜
13 minutes nooooo was hoping it be at least a hour long  😳🤣💗💗💗
I am in love with ur videos and make up! HELL YEAH
We miss u Jeffree and miss your makeup videos I’m so happy you come back again and being happy and healthy again ❤️❤️❤️😍😻😘the queen is back again 👑
FINALLY!!! So excited to watch this!! ❤️
I don't understand. What's the big deal with these products being sold at Nordstrom Rack?
KINGGG 👑
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Not to mention that people who were otherwise afraid to (or couldn’t afford to) order will now see how good the makeup is and you’ll get new JS makeup lovers! There is always a bright side.
The growth mindset jeffree, I love it! 💖
Don’t sweat it, Jeffree. It still gives someone a chance to experience, get to know and enjoy your products.
YAAASSSSS! IM SO GLAD TO SEE A VIDEO FROM YOU ON THIS DAY ❣❣❣❣
Could you one day do a video for makeup for people with EXTREME skin sensitivities? Because I’ve stopped wearing makeup for the better half of going on a year and a half although I passionately love it. I just have no tolerance for the micro dose of poison in all cosmetics but I watch your videos to live vicariously thru you whenever you post and I wish I could get back to fun and exciting creative ways to play with my face. So no pressure and totally a niche thing! But idk I haven’t even seen makeup on the market THAts natural or anything without seeming hella sketchy so I figure if anyone can find it out it’d be you ♥️
Yayyy i can't wait for the video's of you and Shane
Jeffree being so humble and matured now on how he handles the media, and the internet scandals. I love a growing queen.
Beautiful wig in the intro, sheesh the first 5 seconds and I'm already GAGGING
I missed this type of videos
Wow, yr dogs r quiet. Wow. That's how it is when yr around good ppl.
Jeffree and Shane is the epitome of a real  truth friendship
Of course it will be there  after a while. Like a CD being in the clearance rack!!
I rather have my products on discount stores than not being sold and expiring, the facf that this is a steal for fans and still, buyers can wear your makeups in all sort of events, I mean, you are truly helping someone out in that small perspective already and that's a cool thing, idk if a little discount would hurt JS and Shane, but, they made history already, also backstocks ending up in lesser tier stores is a real thing, so that's the tea y'all.   Love u both Shane and Jeffree, more collabs pleaseeee
Jeffrey, make compact mirrors 🪞
MY BOY IS COMING BACK 👀👀🔥🔥
ok but who else pressed the video for shane?😂
9:12 lol this made me laugh so hard lol
Shane Dawson is Toxic to Jeffree. Jeffree wasn't and isn't a drama king until Shane had to idea to edit for Tati and go back and forth MAKING the drama. Really y'all don't see that toxicity????
You can clearly tell Jeffree has been talking and thinking about some stuff in therapy, we love growth ❤️
I love and appreciate the realness you always brig Jeffree. Missed ya!
Kinda surprised it’s only 13 minutes
Pay attention that ONLY THE SHANE DAWSON COLLAB was clearanced. You can do so much better Jeffree
There is nothing wrong with products being at discount stores.Us broke people like nice stuff too🤣
The camera person was shaking a lot
You're stunning ❤️ I literally love your hair SOOO much! Makes me wanna dye my hair in my bathroom 🤪
Shane 😢
Can we not have shane over please
I don’t think U should have done a whole damn video on this u haven’t even done one in a while .... ughhhh ok
Glad they both have been able to move on from all the ugly drama. Can’t wait for their comebacks !
He does not care. Jeffree knows his products are the shit and shoot still selling out. Like the damn fuck proof mascara that I've tried to get multiple times and each time is sold out...speaking of...I'll take a donation lol. Ive been wanting to get back into the make up scene. There for a while I was depressed and stayed in bed and just didn't care and I'm slowly coming out of it and trying to better myself. Being broke and can't really afford any good make up sucks. But anyways I can tell Jeffree don't really care cuz he knows he's a success and that's all that matters at the end of the day. Have you done something you love and did u make ur imprint in the world. I can say Jeffree has. Love u Jeffree. Your amazing And  gorgeous like always
What’s so funny is I singlehandedly have wished I could have the controversy palette since it came out two years ago I just couldn’t act fast enough financially every time 🥲
Leaving LA was the best discussion for both you and Shane.    Growth is good for us all.  This is my favorite Jeffree look yet.
He literally face times shane for 15 seconds. Your welcome
Shane Dawson canceled forever
I want Shane to come back so bad!!!
Ahhhh, love the energy in this video Jeffree! You seem to be happy and healthy, and I am over the moon happy to see you doing well! Love you! 💜
and now they acted like it’s cool hahah what a hypocrites
You & Shane will always make me laugh. I go back to the old videos of both of you & they make me cry of laughter. I love both of you ❤️ & love to see you guys stick together through it all
I LIVE for this! Puhlease need more from Jeffrey and Shane! I can’t wait for Shane to come back! And he didn’t f his cat, morons!
Can I ask u why u have to buy yr own creation. That nvr set well with me. I mean ok, but. It still doesn't sit well. I love u Jeffrey.
I've always wanted him to show he's above the petty shit. I'm glad he's realizing it now. And I hope Shane is living his best life. I know his past was thrown in his face and he made some stupid mistakes but everyone does. We grow and learn.
Soooo the question will be... what do you do with your not sold inventory? destruction process or what? this event maybe is for a good reason... you should start thinking to sell your overstock inventory there, or Dillards, or I do not know.
Yay!!!!
When Jeffree said, "bye friend... I L❤VE  U!". I felt the love! 😭
We love a good deal 💋
I bet the managers don’t want you to film because their stores are not taken care of to corporate standard and they don’t want to get in trouble for bad publicity from their corporate offices.
Shane Dawson canceled forever
It's not overstock. It wasn't bought bc we canceled Shane Dawson forever
Showing growth, finally! It’s beautiful to see
somebody explain to me, im in europe, is nordstrom a bad shop ? whats the big deal behind that shop ?
So humble. So proud.
Ok you found it at Nordstrom rack and donated it to goodwill, Now there’s going to be people posting that they found it at Goodwill lol
“It’s me , him , & a security guard “  Threesome lol 😂  Oh Jefrfrey
Will Shane ever be back?
Cancel culture ain't no joke. WHEN WE CANCELLED SHANE DAWSON we meant it. Forever
I feel bad. Because I feel like he was genuinely hurt.
You'd get followers and fans back if he would drop Shane Dawson.
You were talking about Halloween makeup looks yesterday on your IG and I think you should do a Sally look from nightmare before Christmas! I think that would be awesome 💜
Says he’s not bothered by his stuff being in discount stores but then buys it all so there’s no more on the shelves
Are you filming? Remains one of my most favorite liquid lip color of l time. I wear it the most at least for now.. still wanna get some of the new lip colors.
Love this new you I’m very proud of you💄 you’ve grown so much, I wish some of these other You Tubers can learn from this.
It's because Shane is toxic and bringing you down
You just made me so happy when you said Shane is coming to visit! I miss seeing videos with the both of you!
Love you tons!!!!! So glad to see you in such an amazing spot in life and happy
My local Rack didn’t have any 😢
PLEASE make a series together again!!😭😭❤❤❤
@jeffreestar So you claim that you were in the comment section you want to comment on why you keep lying to people.  You claimed yesterday in a story that you were going to be mentioning the video with lipstick Nick in it that you delete it after 6 hours. There was no mention and you constantly acted like everyone who follows you are idiots and that we don't hold you to what you say. It's getting damn pathetic
HAHAHA LIVE FOR YOU😍
Glad your back filming, we miss you.
y’all are back? i’m upset
It hurts my legs to watch Jeffree sit like that!
not yall forgiving Shane 🤡🤡🤮🤮
Perfect start to Saturday with this video! Can't wait to see the other videos you have planned!
“We have to buy it!” Jeffree Star buying out all of his products at Nordstrom Rack is such a fitting end to 2021!
I thought u were selling the mansion
Jeffrey: do you have your wallet 😂😂😂
I'm happy to see this video hasn't mysteriously dissapeared yet.
Roll the series!
Missed seeing you two!! Literal icons!!!!!
Yay you guys are back!!
Did you both get served a slice of humble pie the size of the Empire State Building ? Oh I therhink sooo . Looking hot girl I have to say 🔥
I first saw on TikTok and Rich Lux posted about this collab being sold at Nordstrom Rack and the first chance I got I went to 2 locations to get as much of the products as I could for myself and my friends. We have been trying to get this collab for a while now and though we didn’t get everything from it we wanted, I’m so glad I was able to at least something. It sells out too fast online and I’m not really a fan of online shopping in general so being able to walk into the stores and pick it up made my day!
Just seeing you and Shane together makes my heart so happy. Cant wait for your vids together. Your friendship is something very special. I think its wonderful that people who maybe have smaller budgets can get to experience that collection. That collection was 🔥🔥🔥🔥. I legit teared up when I finally was able to get the Conspiracy Palette.  That is hands down one of my favorite purchases. I have it on display in my beauty room.
Amazing love you both!!! 💯
Lmao keeping it 100%
I love your hair it's cute
Missss u
This is such an unnatural video
You can’t deny the emotional maturity glow up Jeffree has done. He’s said and done some fucked up shit. No ones perfect. And I don’t condone anything he’s done but I hella appreciate and applaud the obvious work he’s put into healing and bettering himself. 👏👏👏
I love seeing Jeffree like this, he's matured, I liked when he said "threesome" and immediately said just kidding, that shows growth imo and Also he understanding the business it's really cool. Can't wait for More videos.
OMG Nordstrom rack NEEDS NEW LIGHTING😂😂🙌 I hate yellow lights
Super proud of you.  You keep it humble and I love it
I love you so much Jeffree but I'm so damn happy for Shane right now please come back shane 💓
i thought shane would be in this :( sad
Anyone else love Jeffree’s laugh 😂
the production value of a video about shopping at discount stores though....
omfg! I have missed you
Ope not my trash state not having Nordstrom Rack
Ugh miss Shane so much
Growth looks so good on you Jeffree .  Us scorpios are brutal but we live and grow much love
I thought u sold your house
Looks to me like Jeffrey here is feeling butt hurt about it so he's trying to make it look "less then" Hence him repeating the same shit over and over
I miss shane, wish he could come back, ive been watching him since i was a child and i would love to see him again. I know he has made mistakes but who hasnt. The important thing is that he regrets it and grew from it.
If you’re watching this because you think Jeffree Star will address the issue he basically just says oh well it’s just business lol
It warms my heart to know Shane and Jeffree are still friends
Are you joking? This is amazing this is iconic this is legendary
I have never clicked a YouTube video so fast
See that’s why I love Jeffreestar  and Shane Dawson they are  so amazing True friends an they did let finding in their make up in another store upset them .them and I’m so glad he’s going to donate to make up a board well what am I talking about he’s always doing to people that’s his true nature he’s a good person that’s why I stayed loyal to Jeffreestar and Shane Dawson 😍😍😍❤️❤️🤗🙏🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Slick way to “ease” Shane Dawson back into the picture? Pretty sure he hasn’t been missed. At all. Before you come for me…..go back and familiarize yourself with what he actually did and said in the first place.
How do you not know where the products you manufactured are distributed? Made up for a video idea.
Just tried the supreme gloss from the Pricked collection 😍😍😍😍 smells so yummy!
Omg they are backkkk
at 7:03 . i still think it is a bit funny.... and this happening is just ironic. it is what it is.
This is actually a good thing. Some people only shop at these sort of stores, so you are picking up a whole new section of customers that are going to discover your products.
Perfect example of when someone talks shit without really knowing what happens until it happens to them.
Jeffree’s energy and vibe is so good here! So glad that he’s found peace and happiness in Wyoming!
Tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati tati
I would snatch it up so quick
I love your hairrr!!!!! Omg literally obsessed
Horrible horrendous traaaaassh
I LOVE YOU! Just thought you should know 💖✨
Ugh how is Jeffree so gorgeous
Wish he would've left them in the store. Let your fans that may not have been able to afford your products get a deal.
I've missed seeing you two together so much! Even if it was just brief for a short call you two will always be my favorite iconic duo.
Miss you so much.... So pretty.... An avid fan from PALAWAN Philippines....
Love you both shane and jeffree 😍😍😘😘
🤗🤗🤗
“Threesome? 👀 No, I’m just kidding…” I LAUGHED OUT LOUD
I'm here for new Shane and Jeffree content ❤️😍
Im here ready for this Shane/ Jeffrey series!
Every fucking single one of your wigs is a moment. Every fucking time! ❤️ 🥰💗
Loved this so so much as always! You have been my inspiration to starting my small business selling hand-painted press-on nails and I’m beyond grateful for you sharing your inspiring and empowering videos with us all! Thank you and bless you. Love you! 💖💖💖  Also soooo lovely seeing Shane 😍💖
I LOVE the Rack..now I know where I cN buy your stuff. It's available to everyone,which I know is what you want. Can't wait to try it!
Me at Goodwill: I really need some lipsticks 😔😔
Let me say ! JEFFERY ! I’m screaming god dammit I need you and Shane back! And who gives a fuck where your makeup is sold you two will forever be that bitch! That made history with this collaboration!  Ugh my heart 😭❤️
Yay!!! Just got off work, now I can watch it!!
Jefree star is the most beautiful human on earth❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jeffree shocked his makeup is in nordstroms so rescues all of it then turns around and donates it to goodwill!😆 Oh Jeffree I love you so damn much!🥰😘 Love that you're filming again! Are we ever gna get a tour of your ranch and meet your yaks!?
Glad you addressed it, the KVD comment. Even more glad you can reflect back and take accountability for your feelings that brought about the onslaught of verbal diarrhea but changed behavior is the master of true evolution. It’s refreshing to witness yours. Keep on keepin’ on. 💕
The best JS ...a fan since 2016 seen my boss ass btch going down and back risen up 📈 to the top!!
W-wait.... Shane?!? Bruh 🥺
Yay Jeffree and Shane!
I actually like Nordstrom Rack. Didn't know Shane moved to my state. Lol.
That was  so interesting sweetie !!!! Love you my Queen 👑!! You are sooooo happy & I love love love it sweetie 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Okay but how did it get there? You said you had theories.
We all GASPED when we saw Shane Dawson in the thumbnail!
3:55 Nice MASKED picture. You should come to Myrtle Beach. We still have freedom here. 🤡<🇺🇲
I knew they would both be cool about it :) so excited for Shane going to Wyoming videos !!!
It’s about time. I have been waiting months for this video. Jeffree was even able to call out himself. Amazing!
That lawsuit goin be legendary that's why Jeffree not even mad lmaoooo
YaY Their back!!!!
I'm so beyond happy that you & Shane kept y'alls friendship true! We need Shane in our life.  And you!  There will always be haters who hate on people's past but we all got 1 of those!  Love y'all
Notttttt shane thinking he is off the hock! Have some shame
We need more life updates Jeffree..... X
I effing miss you guys.💋😍 I miss the review videos  I just miss jeffree💌💟
I love that in all of his videos, Jeffree treats his fans with respect and says hi/takes pictures! Even though he has pink hair and a pink car, he’s still always so down to earth and has a real heart. Rock on!
Props for the great attitude and nod to good business!
Te amooooooooo
2:37 playing Thin Lizzy at the store - love it!!
Why did this need a full video though? 😂 Lol your giant ego is clearrrrlllyyyy bruised.
I pull the "forgot my card" trick on my hubby 🙃🤣
I think we can agree when jeffree talking with shane his/her spirit really went up. You can also feel the vibe and how their energy matches. And im living for it. I cant wait to see another jf approval and your collab with shane again. ❤️❤️
Jeffree we need to see you visit Shane in  Colorado. I see you on the Zipline and in the swan! Good times again💕👄🤳💅
Let's be honest though, Nordstrom Rack isn't like a dollar store or some lowball clearance store.  It's still a Nordstrom.  So even if it's in clearance store it's like his stuff is in a upscale Clearance store lol
I love Shane and Jeffree together.
Yep, that is why I slap those walls up sometime and do not turn my back on anybody, because they may be looking for a soft spot to stick in the knife.
Wanna know why I love him!? That glow, attitude & the fact that he's in Nordstrom wearing LV bedroom shoes💜😘 LOVE that they're still besties, F**K the haters!🤣✌️
*I would legit DROP DEAD if I saw jeffree walking into a store behind me like whatttt these ppl so calm lol*
You can feel the positive energy between him and Shane when they're on the call... I love it!! ❤️
Well, I love you Jeffree, and I know you had to address this for certain people that couldn't understand...but I was expecting a more interesting  video. Waaa. 😢 Lol. Oh well. Heheh. You're still the 👨man, 👩bitch, and 👽alien you always were ... & ill watch anything you post. 👍🏼
WHO ELSE IS READY FOR SHANE AND JEFFREY TO  REUNITE 😍😍😍
People are gonna say Jeffree is going broke because he forgot his wallet and doesn't even have $167 to spare. They'll say... Forgot his "wallet" suuuuure. I can see it already.
Omg Shane x Jeffree videos, finalllllllllllly
Please fix the camera getting dizzy watching this…
A little confused here. Im from the east coast, is Nordstrum like the west coast's version of Sears or something?
Leaving LA suits you. You look so much happier and you are just glowing❤️
People:  "Omg its on the discount stores!! Is that bad?!" Me:  *Runs to a nordstrom rack*
I love you and Shane so much! Please collab again and in more videos💖💖💖💖
I love you Jefree. 😍
When you pull it out of Nordstrom n say your going to donate it to goodwill miss thang you about to have a bunch of pple hunting at goodwill now
Love you Jeffery❤️ it makes me so happy to see you so happy & your beautiful as always .  Xoxo Brittney 💋
*now you can all get off his asss for another two weeks about him uploading 😝🙄*
Jeffree you seem so much happier and at peace. I'm glad to see it ❤️
I will have to settle for Shane in your phone in my phone, I guess. Better than nothing.
*Jeffree is a mood*
Omg I'm in colorado. I have to go check out a Nordstrom, and see if I can find any!!
You find some of your stuff on Amazon too I don't know if it's real bit it's there
I miss seeing you and Shane together, definitely an iconic duo!!! Hopefully people can keep the negativity to them selves and let these guys grow as people and exist in peace.
This was actually a real mature reaction. Well done! Are you still planning on coming to Malta?
Omg Shane we miss you
Jeffree make sure to not donate to Goodwill but instead places like local women's shelters. They will much more likely keep the products instead of tossing them, and will appreciate it more!
Why did you buy them all though... Let us get them for the low though
Moving out of Cali was the BEST decision for you to make! You finally look glowing and happy like the old you. I'm here for this 🙌🏼
16.3 million subscribers . .  wowzie!!
“I had no idea.” “I didn’t understand how makeup products got sent to these kinds of stores.” Sure girl. Live that fantasy.
Love seeing u this happy. Look absolutely stunning of course as well. Keep Killin it girl
Did Jeffree have to buy them though? Couldn’t he have looked at which products they were and left them there for someone else?
I love you guys !!! Such good memories
I need more videos!! Love u both
Waiting for the Rich Lux video about shane being back on YouTube later
I miss these type of videos
I missed this and needed this thank you jeffree . we all need a shane and jeffree collab moment. thanks love hope you see this
Awww, Nordstrom Rack is playin’ Thin Lizzy 🥰
I waited this whole time for u and Shane wtf where Shane at😭
So glad to see you post! Can't wait for more. Love ya
can’t decide if jeffree is actually changed or not.. i wanna watch his and shane’s videos so badly because i love them so much but it’s so hard for me to decide if i can get past what they’ve done. neither have come out with a full, real apology or addressed it yet… but here we are giving them views an attention and comments so what can i say
Seriously he buys it ALL so NO ONE can get it at at a discount!!!!!🥺🤢👎you cant go to EVERY STORE THOUGH LOL
Seems kinda classiest to people who might wanna buy your stuff but can't afford it, that you bought everything there was of yours just because you don't want it in there
I CAN'T WAIT FOR SHANE TO VISIT YOU ❕❗I hope Ryland joins as well ❕❗
i truly seriously for real miss you and shane so much, i'm so happy you'll be filming together again!
Love this…I understand wanting to be in charge of quality control, but it’s nice to see some able to get the products we loved now rather than it go to waste.  Love that the two of you are still friends. 💞  I haven’t bought makeup for the first time in my life for almost a year because of pandemic; just existing on lip gloss & calling it a day.  Miss you two on you-tube.
SHANE!!! Lol literally what I tuned in for. Just to see him again. Hi Shane!
I missed Shane so much!
Hey from the UK 👋
I didn’t kno workers could ask for pics while on the job!?
Yayayyaya!!!
Hey y'all!!!! Good morning!!
Can he actually sue them though for selling his product without him knowing
Oh, I'm confused. What's a Nordstrom Rack? I get what it is, but I've never heard of that. We only have regular Nordstrom Dept Stores where I live and I was wondering why Rich Lux's video looked like he was at a Marshall's. The Nordstrom here would never. The outfit those sales lady's wore...eek. wtf? Def.not allowed to wear cheap clothes here if you work there.. How ? When did Nordstrom dive into the Ross category? [Smart, but just never saw this before.]
Love it 😄
Just let people buy it damn
I miss Shane and Jeffree together in videos 😭❤️
Queen what is this
I love and missed your videos..
Brooo I would actually DIE if I found the lipstick shades that you found!
Talk about growing and  glowing  great job ⭐.
“And I found ryland! I think he’s maybe in Colorado with you but I found him in Nordstrom!” 😂☠️
i missed the jeffrey and shane sm
Jeffree, this video makes me happy. You have been so honest here and I appreciate it. 	:)
love you
The fact he called himself out for calling out KVD being in TJMaxx shows growth! Regardless of cancel culture no one can deny his makeup is incredible! Posh spice is literally the only lipstick I ever feel comfortable wearing and I’ve wore it for years 😍
I love your reactions, and i love you in general, love seeing you back on You tube too xxx Your gorgeous!!!
I could see myself hanging out with you smoking laughing our asses off hanging out with your yaks at #starranch
I feel new series and drama is around the corner. I'm curious if Shane prepares for a comeback...
The way this channel has gone downhill so quickly 💀
We miss you jefferryyyy💖🧡❤💙💛
it’s at tj maxx too
I missed you
Omg!!!! Just him ,me and a security guard! Looks right at camera 🎥 threesome? Omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love you at Jeffrey!!! So funny 😂
❤️
Jeffree going out without his wallet has me hysterical 🤣 this is ME when I go for makeup and I get to the till 🤷
He’s much more famous and richer then Jenny 69 and you don’t see a bodyguard behind him 🤣🤣🤣 Jeffrey hood 🤣🤣🤣
Miss seeing you together. Can't wait for that!!
My heart is full when I watch the video, you are inspiration, the icon , legend , moment, I love you so much ❤️❤️🌍
I think you're the best kid ever.  Successful business man and a powerful positivity model.  Way to go on all fronts.  xo
You have the best formulas !
So happy to see your face ❤️ just some feedback - the camera work is super shaky I had to stop a few times cos I got so dizzy. Hope once the new camera person gets used to you that settles down. So happy to see you though!
Jeffree Lynn, my how you’ve grown! 💞
The least amount of money Jeffree ever spent buying makeup 💄
Imma still buy direct from JSC. 👌💯😻 I’ve gotten a lot of hate for this but I wanna support jeffree lol. I wonder if the people who hate me are just jealous they can’t pull off make up at all… or afford it lol 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Being a grown up and donating to charity? I like it! 👌 xxx
Tbh Jeffrey is just as good at business if not better than he is with makeup. When he said, "that's smart business!", I knew ok.   Jeffrey knows what is up
I for one appreciate seeing make up I couldn't normally afford new being available at places like this so your money saving momma friends can get some too
I bought your blue blood true blood or whatever pallet and tried a little make up and it just makes me look super old so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong… but you really inspired me,  especially as a journey on trying to learn how to make better production and films on here. … Music, script, many different characters including half human half animal, and different eras in times such as my 1700s priest.
Literally me using this pallet to do my makeup while I’m watching
U handled this so well. Ur so amazing love u. Lol
Omg 😆 “ role the series” 🤣🤣🤣
Was kind of disappointed when I saw the cover of the video thinking Shane was going to be in the video, but he basically click baited us
Id be curious to know who babysits his dogs when he's out of state, as id assume he must trust that person more than anyone
I wish he could have left it for others that want it, but I get it. He needs to see if it's his or unsafe dupes.🙏
When the sheep haters were throwing away the collaboration Jeffree was just like lol I already have your money boo
it’s giving 2018 energy… and i’m here for it
They had the big conspiracy palettes in San Francisco Nordstrom Rack… I also scored on a lot of the lip gloss.
I love you jeffree! You are soo beautiful! Muah
Im just mad I didn't get some at that price 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I look at it as teenagers who maybe work minimum wage and can’t afford the retail prices can go and get your products now and practice with safe makeup instead of the crap they sell on aliexpress
Wait… did he not sell his house?
💚 I love how you've been donating so much! 💚
can we agree we need a jeffery shane colab number 2!!! like nowwwww... i know you two will rock another one out.. loook at the 1st one.. you broke the internet... 1000%%% :) :) :)
so *this* is what we waited for? 🙄
Thank god you're back 🤗🤗🤗
I bought the conspiracy palette at 14$ two months back rhe big palette
J
It's funny how what goes around comes around. I'm glad you learned from that. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️ you Jeffree!
I missed watching you jeffree
😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘
Hi jeffree how are ya? Send me some gift pls.💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
💋
the conspiracies that came outta this video being uploaded on different day hahahahaha theres like 100000000000000000 drama videos on it "WHAT ARE THEY HIDING!?" hahahaha
Ew go away Shane
Lmao I remember that
I absolutely love this video!!! This is REAL!!!
I missed you, Jeffree 😭❤😭❤😭❤ ily
NO CUZ I WAS THERE YESTERDAY AND WAS LIKE JEFREE?
It's not that surprising that their products are being sold for cheap and I think we all know why the internet will not forget
I'm  so happy to see the growth you two are showing! Sending you both love from Nebraska, girl!  I scrounged up the money to buy my younger sister the Mini Controversy pallet for her Christmas gift after it first came out. We both had to try it out--LOVED IT! The packaging floored me. You see it online, sure, but IRL, it is NEXT LEVEL. Still have the box and tissue paper. Gotta be thrifty, ya know. ;)
I love this video
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yaaaaaassssss Shane!
You seem much happier. I think moving to Wyoming was the best decision you could have made. Glad you stuck by Shane, unlike some others in his life, and that you're still doing things together.
Ps. I’m sorry but the KVD video where  just hilarious in my opinion
I can’t get enough of this bb !!
this totally surprised me with that fkn thumbnail i just smell a comeback
🌸💕😈  Jeffree my love,people make mistakes people change..I guess what am trying to say is forgive yourself…and don’t be hard yourself..I’ve done so much in past and it’s takin me a very long time to be okay with myself and even now I sometimes slip back and beat myself up…but that’s no way to live the rest of our lives..So I wish you the best…and I think the country life suits you…Much love 💕 New Orleans 🎭🎷🎭
But why buy it out Jeff? Most can’t afford your make up..
I never doubted you both friendship and I stayed quiet and always praying for you two🙏😍🥰
Jeffree said From the rack to goodwill miss thing!
I found the Mini pallette in San Diego, but that's all they had
I don’t care about celebrities or meeting them but honestly I’d loveeeee to meet jeffree and get a pic!!! Also that jacket!! 👌😻😻😻
OH HELL YES BRINGS BACK THE OLD DAY!!!
Finaly
Loving his new look so addicted
I can’t wait! 🙂💕
I am obsessed! So refreshing to see such a real true friendship in the celebrity world ❤️❤️❤️
Im so sad I never got the mini controversy with the green shade!! Or even just the green shade!! :,(
Its really  a good deal and what the  jfc. Should be price range for.  So stop high balling jeffrey star.
TW: Shane 💀💀💀
Come back Shane!!!!!
I genuinely enjoy you two and I love you guys <3. I've been watching you both since I was a freshman in highschool and now I'm in college. I have all your eyeshadow pallettes. I've watched Shane since he had the emo hair lol. I'm glad you two are happy and thriving. ❤
Hey Jeffrey, I need to get a hold of u. Many ppl have been buying morphebrushes stuff, and they aren't getting their products, and the company isn't emailing ppl back. Idk what's going on, but they need u. Pls respond Jeff. Ik u. I'm ok with u. I actually love u. But they r having issues. Pls respond. Pls go talk to morghebrushes cosmetics. Many issues with overdo orders and they r not emailing them back. pls Jeffreystar. we love u, they need help. Thank u if u get this.
Very excited to see you and Shane filming again!
Jeffree has such a great aura about him now and I love it so much, drama free, maturing, happy glowing, the country/farm life has really humbled him a lot n I couldn’t be happier for him ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love u so much!!!!!!
Happy to see you and Shane kept your friendship going, can't wait to see what's to come
Jeffree, I love the wig on this video!!
🤣🤣
I love Jeffree so much. He’s such a beautiful soul. 💖💫
they're about to get sued
Miss sooooo much Jeffree!
Okay but could y’all imagine being at a Nordstrom and checking out some discount makeup when all of a sudden a wild Jeffree Star pulls up lmao
Lol imagine buying YOUR OWN makeup in someone else’s store ??? Huh ! Lol. ♥️
This guy is terrible but hes sure fun to watch
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS WELCOMEEEE BACK SHANEEEEE
Everyone else: don't mind the haters *inspirational*  Me "oooo I love that hair... oh snap I didn't see a single second of that video now to stop staring at that hair..." -replay-
I.miss Shane
These are my favorite video from you. They make me smile. Bring back more like this
Well you definitely did a 180 and came out positive, and moving forward and upwards, I'm actually happy you stayed by Shane.
I really like how much Jeffrey matured over the past year. Wyoming was a good move, so it seems
Sweeties are here finally !
missed the 2 of them together so much
I live for the JS and Shane friendship. So glad to see you back on YouTube. Please keep the videos coming 🙏
Can't wait to watch more videos with you & Shane!! ❤❤
I literally cried happy tears when I saw Shane in the thumbnail! I love you two so much❤️
1:49 when someone parks too close to me and I struggle to get out of the car 😒
Usually though if it's on clearance it's normally a damaged box, or it wasn't selling, or controversy on the manufacturer part. It really depends. Sometimes it's nothing bad and sometimes it is
😄😄😄😄😄😄
Love 💘your reaction
Shane's not even in the video
Jeffree I'm happy for you. Youve really grown and matured. Wishing you all the best. I'm a long time supporter. Love you 💓
The camera is sooo shaky.
I missed seeing Shane and Jeffrey together.  This was nice even if it was just a short FaceTime
can't wait for the reviews!!!!!
I clicked so fast! I was searching Shane Dawson to watch his old videos and was so happy to see a new one with you jeffree ♥️
You have grown so much over the years. To be very honest I am so happy you have matured and grown into the person you are now. I always knew this person was here and would be doing better things. You are iconic and people need to look beyond the past and realize people grow and mature. Thank you for the video. I hopefully will be able to find something of yours in tj Max I can’t afford to order unfortunately. But I will be on the look out. It would be cool if you did like a big giveaway for your fans!!!
I love Jeffree and Shane’s friendship and can’t wait til their together again!!
"Que Shane and me moving to farms." LOL
💖🎨🖌️💄💎🛍️🛍️💜💜✨😍😊🤗
I moved to LA literally just a couple days ago so it's awesome you came back for a bit!
"Hi  How are ya" Don't know why i like to hear this sooo much from jeffreestar🍁
Karma really got this bitch 😂😂😂 NOW he "humble" 🤡
Jeffrey just make sure it's really your make up. Remember when Chris Jenner found fake versions of Kylie cosmetics in downtown Los Angeles. They were breaking out people's skin and people were actually putting in lawsuits against Kylie . Kris Jenner found the products had them tested and they were fakes and had oh my God some nasty nasty ingredients so just be careful boo.
Wow you can’t back peddle your way to 7 years ago or however long it was ago. You’re only saying this no because your make up is in a outlet store. May sure you give your friend his money
So glad you are back! Welcome back to uploading I know how hard it can be!! Sending you lots of peace!!! Xx an psss “the gloss” is my favorite 😍 and the liquid lips the scrub is my favorite too I love the component and the smell and how well it works! It’s no surprise it’s flying off the shelf’s !!!
Ok that wig is giving it all tho 😂❤️
IM SO GLAD YALL ARE STILL FRIENDS
Lol Shane still excited it wasn’t Ross
YESSSS
While I was watching this my husband comes in and says “We’re about to recklessly play the lottery.” I’m like why… Him “I found a house and I wasn’t sure whose it was until I got to the garage photos with pink cars. I want this house.”  Three guesses whose house it was… 😂💖
WHY THE CAMERA SO SHACKY OUTSIDE?!
I'm in hawaii just opened my eyes and now I know it's going to be a great day seeing Shane and Jeffree
ONLY 13 MINUTES?????🥺🥺🥺🥺
And TJ Max!!
So happy to see your friendship with Shane survived!! I love you two 😍🥰💗
Lol there’s a conspiracy/controversy around the conspiracy/controversy collection. I’m dying 😂
Omg y’all I need more Jeffree and Shane videos in my life. I love when they film together such a good time.
Are we really surprised that it's all Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson collaboration makeup on clearance? That's like me asking how I got my Paula Deen knife collection for dirt cheap 🤣
💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
There will always be drama. Support who you want to support.
I'm dead lol
Love ya Ms. Starr!!!😀😀
Good Vibes, My Guy.  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I’m so proud of you and Shane, continue to rise above all the hate and stay strong.
Can't wait for video with Shane, I enjoyed u two together! ❤
This video was “Everything” 💚 you look sooo hot ,your energy is amazing ,and we got to see Shane too. Smiling ☺️ you guys give me warm fuzzies.  Huge fan girl lol
I love how Jeffrey treats the employees
♥ ♥ ♥ Can't wait for Shane to go to Wyoming!!
I miss these two together. Hopefully we will get videos from you two soon. Maybe another series together in the future? 🤞😁
Jeffree?  Ur so pretty : ) And, I have to pick dog hair off, too.
Well with all the controversy around Shane I'm not shocked that it's on clearance. I'm kinda shocked it's being sold still
I'm so happy that, you and your mental health is doing so well out in Wyoming. Can't wait for your next video!! I hope that your friend who was in the car acc. with you, is healing, I've been sending good vibes his way as well as all the light, and positivity possible 🌈💫✨💫✨🥰🌈🥰
I can't wait to see y'all colab again! ☺️
Reaction NO F**KING WAY 🤩
Oh my god
Shane is inching back to the Internet..😂
You have grown so much! You normally wouldn't have been happy but this just proves Wyoming is doing you the world of good 💜
Was that the official Nostrom rack lawyer helping you pick up your items?
I was hella excited to see it there, I got The Gloss. My broke ass appreciated the mark down. lol
At 1st, I was like whats the big deal, Nordstrom rack is boujie IMO. Now if JS would've found it in Ross, then yeah go aawwfff sis, but its not a big deal and just a business move.
I would donate to women’s shelters not goodwill goodwill has been raising their prices like crazy it’s not the same.
Sooo ….. welcome to the fact your a has been JS
I thought shane was going to be in it? He was literally just on ft for like 5 mins, I WANT THE REAL SHANEEE BACKK!
Boys are back in town
I've missed you and Shane doing videos, I hope if Shane you read these comments (likely a bad idea) that you stop being stupid! Love you both!!
Pee
You are glowing in a different way, radiating happiness and positivity 💕✨
Not what I thought this was going to be
Where you going to donated on goodwill so I can go buy it there😂😂🤣🤣
This Quick ass video made my month 😳🤩💖 I missed u so much Jeffree u can’t even comprehend You were the one to give me power when I was first transitioning N just seeing your face made my day so much better🥺💖💖
Me today- OMG Jeffery is Absolutely Fabulous...i wish I was fabulous like Jeffery Star💖 JefferyStar- I'll be wearing makeup when I'm 90💯💖 Me thinking of Jeffery when he is 90..." OMG  Jeffery Star looks absolutely fabulous!!! I wish I was fabulous like Jeffery Star💖💖💖 LUV YA !!!! Jeffery "thee shining"Star!
So you pulled a Ryland and used Shane to clickbait for views lmfao, got it. 🙃🥴
Is Jeffree star back and not just for lunching new products? 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I work for a discount store as a manager. Ive watched all this from before the beginning as a shane fan. I get it. It is just business totally and ppl dont uderstand that side. Business is business.
I mean you deserved it idk what you expected lmao
Love how ur putting out more YouTube videos!!
well I'm glad the conspiracy makeup you got from that store is the real deal and not some kind of nock off fake crap and second it will give people a chance too buy the conspiracy makeup that could not afford it at full price.
WE MISS THIS GREAT DUO
Missed you!!!
When someone has to pull their wallet out and pay...do you pay them back.
Yesssss !!!
Can't wait to see your Jeffree Star approved videos and CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE YOU AND SHANE FILM TOGETHER AGAIN LOVE YOU BOTH
Click bait
This video wasn’t long enough…I needed more! ❤️🙏
I thought my eyes were deceiving me
I’m screaminggggggg
Biggest collection in makeup history??? Not even close. Why does he lie and try to be something he’s not? He’s legit going broke and still pretendingz
I've been so damn excited for this video
Is it just me, or does that lighting make that bavkground look like a greenscreen?
Hello Jeffreystar!
Omg I've wanted to wake up and see THIS kind of notification for years and I'm not even joking. The only things that could top this would be waking up to a notification that one of the YouTubers I hate is dead! Yaaaaay I can't wait to watch this!! Xoxoxo
I want more Jeffree + Shane 😩😩😩
And that my friends is what’s called growth. Good for you Jeffree 😎
Hides for over a year and this is what the creative genius came up with
Hearing about a new video with you and Shane made me screech in delight! :D
FINALLY managed to get the 'F**k Proof' mascara & I'm soooooo happy! 😍😍😍
Jeffree has helped me in all aspects of my life. He has helped me so much to be strong but also great-full. I’ll forever be grateful to jeffree from saving me and my life, and helping me through my darkest .Thank you so much! 💗
Lol it’s also available at Tj max. I love how he’s pretending it’s just at nordstrom lol
There are other high end things in Nordstrom Rack.  Don't be too sad about it.
Hey beautiful prayers for your happiness & well-being luv u Miss ⭐.
Love seeing this new you, you seem so much happier and in better head space!💗
SO GREAT TO SEE SHANE AGAIN!!
We are living for this!!! 🔥🔥🔥
God I missed u and missed Shane
G - H
Why did i click on this i despise you guys
Yes queen!
Love how mature you are now Jeffrey! We love you
“ that’s my name in your store relax” yasssssss tf love the energy !!! I do feel like u should get the proceeds but I love the grace and humbleness. 💖
Oh miss thing! So glad to see you. ♥️♥️
Lol it was all over the “news” lol no it wasn’t boo boo. Just YouTube drama. He really thinks he’s something. He’s so insecure under the façade of “Jeffree Star”
I’m not feeling this wig. But glad you posted.
So good to see you happy 🤗!
I’m so glad you guys are still such good friends~. You both make each other amazing
Wyoming was the best decision for Jeffree in my humble opinion. He’s changed and seems SO much happier and chill. I’m happy for him! And I love the end where he says he’s gonna donate the makeup to charities ❤️
You seem in such a better head space. Love to see the positive change and I like how you addressed how you said things years ago.     So happy to see this Jeffree 💖 keep up the amazing energy
I thought Shane and Jeffery were not friends anymore lol
Jeffree and Shane should do a Halloween video together 🎃 ♡please
Jeffree,  I´m so glad you and Shane are better, happier and healthier than ever, can´t wait to see your upcoming review videos. Blessings and hugs from Sonora, Mexico.💞
It’s so nice to see you again ! I’ve been a fan since MySpace days and I always check your channel to see if I missed anything but we know your have things In the works for us to see we just need to be patient! Love the energy and I can truly see a changed person ! Would love to see some country expired t shirts now that you have a ranch ! We Texas girls approve you jeffree star ! Love you 😘
When Conspiracy 2, Electric Boogaloo is happening gurl!? We need it. Luv u
We love a matured icon. 🖤
I’m happy for you Jeffree. I can tell you change a lot and I love that. I’m so happy see you again on YouTube. Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Eagerly waiting for you to come to México.. 💙🇲🇽 💙
💖🙌🏼
Such a positive outlook.  You have grown so much over the last year or so.  Beautiful xx
True happiness looks good on you👏🏽💕
Personal growth looks good on you, Jeffree! 💜
Feeling like I over paid now lol
If jeffree reply to this comment i swear to goddddd😭
“See you at the rack” lmfao Shane
Why is the camera so shaky???!!
As much as I’m still not sure how I feel about to support them yet I’m glad they took accountability and I would buy that shit ASAP the quality is fucking good idc 😭😭😭
Why are y’all forgetting about what these men did
I have been waiting since yesterday 😩
So happy to see you're BACK!!  It takes time to get the mental health/physical health back. Excited for future videos👑🧁
Love it missed u jeffree
What was the red shade of the lip color
"The first thing I bought was my OWN MAKE UP" Girl you own that shit lol
What was the red shade of the lip color
When you played the series song … I choked on the 20th slice of cheese I was eating
Question why would u bye them all and not let others have it who can't afford a big $ amount
‘’ roll the series !! ‘’ i’m dead 😵
I’m so excited to see Jeffree and Shane videos again, I missed it so much 😭❤️
why did she buy it all though? embarrassed?
And all these idiot gossip channels were saying that you took down this video because you’re hiding something. Show them , Gurlllllll I hate to say it but it’s better to find your shit at Nordstrom rack then to find it at Ross or TJ Maxx😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♀️
Jeffree Star trying to save face for 13 mins straight. Turns out, nobody wants to buy makeup from a guy who supports predators…shocking. 🙄 He obviously still looks down on these stores saying “I’m obviously not going to put it on my mouth because who knows what has happened to it since I manufactured it.” but sure he’s so happy it’s available to those unable to pay $18 for one liquid lip. Absolute trash human being.
They probably planted it, lmfao.
I really appreciate you wearing a mask jeffree. Thank you so much it actually made my heart warm for some reason. I’m glad you guys are back together! Regardless of the shit that happened before. Things happen people aren’t perfect and society needs to understand that.
I love, love, loved the positivity and humor of this video!  I missed you!  And I missed you and Shane together!  Cant wait for your videos!!!
literally finished rewatching the series last night for this to be posted today  shooketh
😍😍😍
I need to go see if i can find some 🤣
I actually did buy a pig mirror from there and I love it !
It would be so awkward to sell Jeffree Star his own product 😭😂😂
Imagine having enough money to help hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty but instead you’re still making makeup videos. Class traitors.
Giving Zhongli vibes 🤣
wait a damn minute-
💞💞
You and shane changed and revolutionized the makeup world!! ICONIC!!
I'm so glad your friendship with Shane has remained strong through all the bs. I recently got out of a very toxic friendship so i understand the emotional hurt that you feel/felt about kvd
We love a humble queen 👑
So glad your back on your channel.  ❤
I couldn’t buy it online so my mom went far af to buy me both pallets 😭😭 for my birthday
Is it the real products or knock off ...??
YESSSS les femmes amusentes finally came back to YouTube J'TAIME beaucoup !!!!!
Looking stunning as ever!😍 I'm ready... I think 🤔🥰
I've never stopped supporting you,  but I have to say that it's really nice to see you humbled and growing as a person.   You've done some not so great things in your past,  but people need to allow others to change and become better.
im crying  shane and jeffree i fuckin missed you guys 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I missed this Jeffree😭
Glad to see you like this Jeffree
🐃 can't wait to see the yaks!
Yes she's replyin. A queen indeed.
this comment section is suspicious
This friendship has always made me so happy 🥰
i love you <3
Love uuu guys💕💕💕
Is it just me on the camera man??its shaky and the angles??bring back cris 😂✌
Love to see this Jeffree again! Feels like the old times. And he's actively replying comments again now?? wow
i can’t wait for more reviews and more shane! i love you guys 💕💕💕
Do you know how nice it was to see a Jeffree Star video on YouTube. ❤️❤️
First video that don’t seem forced or fake in a while
I love everyone was freaking out about this video coming out because of Shane and he was barely in there for a minute on FaceTime. Lmao ☕️
Jeffree looks like he walks so fast 😰
Eek the two players are getting back together! So ready!!!
Camera needs a stabilizer
this gives me the vibes and energy from years ago and im LIVING for it
Jeffree look so happy and very content...I'm glad u and Shane are still friends <3
jeffree baby.. that wig looks so bad….
where it belongs
So great seeing you so happy and at peace! Also can’t wait to see you and Shane back together! ♥️
Way to clickbait my ass thinking shane would be in the video
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
I love this Jeffrey so much ❤️
I love you bothhhhhhhhhhh so muchhhhh❤️😍
Half of the positive comments in here are bots.
Why is he buying all the products? Could have left some for future customers
This is so cringe
😐
never knew people still watches this person lmfao
I hope Shane has Jeffree react to his and Ryland's new home in Colorado. I can already hear Jeffree going "Yes MISS THING"❤
So today is my 18th birthday and what a better present then a new Jeffery and Shane video. Yay 😁
You look and sound so good and healthy!!
this so wild, conspiracy is such an iconic collection it doesn't belong in a discount store. but...imagine being a teen out shopping and finding jeffree star makeup at such a low price, complete win for a few people. maybe the yak rack could be something for the future? love you and shane every day<3
SO FUCKING HAPPY TO SEE YOU BOTH! You're a true friend, Jeffree.  You 2 always support ea/o
Good olé memories. I can’t wait for more content like this from the both of you💚
I just love this personnnnnn❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you!
Jeffree, I absolutely love the person you are becoming and it really inspires me. 💖
I needed this video thank you

I love when you talk with Shane ❤️❤️❤️ it’s so nice to see real friends
This is why i love Jeffree Star! He is so matured and so sensible person! Ohh, he look so damn pretty!! I am so jealous😢
Omg I didn’t even realize this was a recent video💀 I thought it was old bc Shane was in it and Jeffrey was holding a conspiracy palette and I starting thinking about it when he put a mask on😂
You look AWESOME 🥰... keep on thriving. 🥰
Mommy and daddy, how I’ve missed you 😘 🤗 🖤
Omg I love it and you and Shane's attitude about it is Amazing! I'm so glad y'all will be filming together again!! I can't wait ❤❤❤❤❤❤
That couch is everything!!!!!
Why is it bad to be on the Nordstrom rack again?
“See you at the rack” 😂
When did Oliver Tree start interning for Jeffree Star

I ain't even mad a video call is still in the video 😂
Love love love 💕 💗🙌🏻👑🤗😘
I'm sorry I don't give a fu*k what anyone says, Jeffree and Shane is my fav duo for ever.
You can tell he's matured and changed in a good way
“See you at the rack” Shane I’m dead 😵 💀 ok but I still don’t understand HOW Nordstrom got the makeup when only JSC is supposed to sell it?
So….threesome?!
You look great!
What car accident ? ❤
You look amazing!! I have misses these types of videos!! We need more please! ❤❤💖💖
Can’t wait to see you guys together again!! 🖤
Loving the hair

Anno Domini 2021, Jeffree, can you use an image stabilization camera for your next video? 😅 Can't wait to watch u and Shane together again!

It’s okay to admit you meant your words back then. We say things we regret but this is a good reason to stay humble.

Oh how I miss your gorgeous face in videos and that sarcastic sense of humor that I live for!! You look so happy and you totally deserve it Queen!! 🥰😘
Colorado a farm? X,] True, Mainly for weed!
You look great Jeffree !  Looks like people brought back used make-up that's ridiculous! ! You seem very happy and iam happy for you !!♡♡
Miss these videos! So excited to see Jeffree approved videos again. And I cannot wait for the collaboration with Shane
Friend goals xxx love you 2 x
I’ve never been more depressed than Jeffre calling Nordstrom rack a thrift store 😭😭
It has been SO good to see you again. You look actually happy, and maybe doing mentally the best I have ever seen you. Been a fan of you (& Shane) since like... 2010 girl. Like your Vans Warped Tour days. I will always love you and your content. Going to my Nordstrom rack to take ALLLLL the products LOL
It’s called karma sir
Makes perfect sense. I'm still curious, however, what happened with Burlington Coat Factory.
The queen 💕
Finally! With Shane love the both of them
Jeffree is on a whole different vibe😇, and I'm here for it! We love a queen that grows emotionally. 🤴👸💯💯❤😊
It's been a long time since we have had one of these videos. Love u been here for a long time as a fan of yours. Sending lots of love from Aruba
Will you do a part 3 of tattoo diaries???
Please donate it to a women's shelter, a domestic abuse safe haven, or like a LGBTQ+ community house. Places like Goodwill sell donations for a profit that their employees never benefit from. They also discriminate against different groups/types of people when it comes to their hiring process. So please please please find somewhere that will actually use it for people who need it.
Hi how are yaaaa ✨✨✨✨✨
You looking gorgeous than ever 🤗🤩
That's embarrassing. Keep the content coming. It was good to see Shane. Watch you dog. Stay humble. I love you. You look great. Miss you. Keep the vids coming. Xoxo your KY girl.
You are amazing!! Shane..well I just love and miss you. This just made my day, week and year!!!
I needed this today. BITCH. Come back.
You can literally find Gucci in a thrift shop. ( if you go to the right one)  It doesn't mean anything if its resold its just the way stores work
I love how you actively reply and still connect with your fans! Love you jeffrey❤️❤️❤️
We missed you Jeffree and Shane!!
I miss Shane and Jeffree content! Bring it back🐷⭐️🍔🌭🌮🌯
I love Nordstrom rack. It could be worse it could be at Walmart.
Def needed this.
Yay! Shane is coming back!
Really supposed to believe he doesn’t know it’s there. Is he under the impression that all of his viewers are under 15
Omg that’s my Nordstrom Rack, I live like 1 block away 😅
Can we get the video you deleted with Nicole tho? 🥺🥺 I missed it!
okay so I watched the video. and I watched your Instagram story about it too. Let's start from the beginning. love the iconic personality and calm attitude towards things going around you. I wish I could be that calm.... well... things happen in business and in life... sometimes we don't like it.... but it's life. I see some comments and I am glad you and Shane are still friends. and about the trust thing in the IG stories... I totally agree... BTW you record better videos than the camera guy in this video. no offense cameraman. why don't you try to record your own videos as you said you don't have a team? whenever you have time of course... You do an excellent job.... above all do what makes you happy. I am so proud of you. and people pleaseee stopp digging the past... work in the present to make your future better. Stay happy and let other be happy. whoever is reading this... much love to you and positive energy. I am not gonna read this again to correct typo mistakes... have a wonderful day ya'll 🤗💖
“Saddle up”🐎 YESSS,I’m ready for more videos!
We’re at discount…but like boujie discount 😉
Seeing you and Shane together; I feel like I just woke up from a terrible fever dream and the last 18 months never happened. I’m so ready for y’all to be back on YouTube. I’m ready to laugh and be happy again.
Unless you're a psychopath -    Unprovoked meanness is from ignorance and self hate.  So pity the mean fools. And we've all been there :)
No offence, just a Gentle piece of advice... Dear cameraman, Please dont zoom in like that.and it would be better if you can be more stable the vedios are shaky and i have poor quality phone so its hard to watch the full vedio if its like that. It would be better if u use a tripod or a stand..
I thought shane was going to be in the video.....
Such a good friend, making sure you pay Boomy back 😂😂 love u Jeffree
I love investigation Jeffree. Nothing gets past the makeup Queen.
It’s on Amazon too!
Miss these two so much
I'm glad Shane has a friend like you !
"It's the time" got me so good haha
I hope you people know these people are master manipulators and y’all are all getting played
So no mention about the deleted video with Mr Nick? Didn't you say you were going to tell us about it? Or was it all just for getting more views?
All the hype for a 13 min video 🥲
💚💚💚
THEY ARE BA BA BA BA BAAAAAAAAACK! ❤️ 👑
love you 😽
I miss Shane so much. He made me smile and laugh a lot. Hope everyone is doing well ☺️❤️
YASSSS YALL BACK
Didn’t realize we’d only see Shane on FaceTime 😄
Your response is really mature!
Every jeffree star video is an apology video
Jeffree buying his own make up back....   Boss moves
I thought Shane and jeffree would be together in this video.. Was this reshot last minute after the issues last night?
❤
Yesss i wanna see more of u 2!
I can just feel the positive energy from this video. They live and they learned and are better for it. Love you Jeffree and Shane good to see you both surviving and doing much better. Your videos bring me joy, especially the ones with you two being friends and making jokes. It's good to see you both in good spirits and health. I missed you both!
I love your products jeffree
that face when she said “i know it’s mine 🤗” lmao
👍
Please Jeffree! Make some reviews, I wanna laugh like crazy.
I love that Jeffree just laughed about it just And not being so shady or dramuhhh queen 👑 .....

Jeffree, love to see the maturity and the growth. Also, Boo, share some of the chicken and Waffles please! That is one of my favorite meals!!! Love to see you so happy!!!
Seriously, who didn't know it was Morphe's old stock?
I saw some of your OG lipsticks in TK Maxx (UK version)
I wanted that mini so bad! Still do, but kids wants and needs gotta come first
As entertaining as this was , because truly I loved it, what happen to the video you posted a few days ago then deleted with LipstickNick?:(
She’s baaaaaack. Yassssss😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m really proud that you have really matured and I hope you don’t take this the wrong way❤️
I really love the change in attitude. You could continue to be upset about this, but the fact that you instead chose to show excitement about the pig mirriors being "hot sellers" shows a huge change in your attitude. This is what we love to see ❤
Jeffree, you are glowing! Y'all look so beautiful 🥺❤️
The two ICONS are BACK
Omg the queen is back!!! Ahh so fu***ng happy to see miss momma love you you beautiful bitch you😍 💓 💗

Omg jeffree. You put shane in the thumb nail and I was excited to see him again. Why? What a huge let down.
Jeffree doesn't have his wallet with him because a queen does not carry money. 🌟⭐👑💖
I miss Shane! I'm so happy to see you guys are still really good! 🌈❤

Love from myanmar ❤🇲🇲
If I look at the jeffree from 2019 and now he’s changed so much n I’m so happy that he is so much more honest n acceptance n apology omg I love him ❤️
Every industry sells overstock. It’s not only smart business but it avoids waste to help the environment. It’s win win for everybody.

Jeffree's energy is so amazing, I've been a fan since 2018, couldn't care less about the drama everyone makes mistakes and you can see how much he's evolved through all the BS.  Thank you for getting me into makeup and giving me the confidence to be me in a small town thats not very gay friendly.  So much love Jeffree <3
Aww, I've missed Shane 😭
Barbie Extra hair 💕

Going to Nordstrom Rack today to see what I can get. I want to get some of the liquid lips and maybe a mirror. I’m always down for a deal especially now since I was laid off due to the pandemic. So glad I was able to get the palette and mini controversy with the green shade sometime after the collection launched🥰
Ooo not me early 🥰🥰🥰😭
I think everyone wants you to act perfect and etc. About that shade of KVD was so funny lmao, so I don’t blame you, it was a funny joke! Glad you’re doing amazing 💕🔥
roll the series! lmao
I’ll be honest I have not watched JS in awhile but holy cow the personal growth! I never thought he was that bad in the first place but we love to see it. ❤️
No matter what happens I'll always be glad to see new content from the both of you💜
WE LOVE A GROWN BUSINESS SUPPORTING OTHER BUSINESSES ❤️❤️❤️❤️
“The Boys are Back in Town” playing in the background of Nordstrom😂 ded
I love you two together ❤️❤️❤️ please Shane be active again

Don’t cut down old jeffreys way of handling things. It’s the Jeffrey we all fell in the with.  It’s been fun growing with you.
💜💜💜 Love some Jeffree!
YESSSSS
Soooo happy you’re back Miss Thing!!! ❤️🥳. These last few months without you have been rough. 😩
I just had a horrible day, i broke up with my boyfriend and had a MDD episode to be able to see you posted with Shane warms my heart so much i needed a bit of positivity today so don’t let anyone take that positivity of progression be taken away from you.
What a mood… why is it not available in discounted store in the uk??? 🤪Missing out again, would of bagged the whole lot tbf
Omg when you said “roll the series” and played the song it made me flashback ahh.
My normalcy is now back…
Girl your canceled already
Best way to wake up 😊🌸 love seeing your growth Jeffree!!♡ Then getting to see you and Shane interact was just..so wholesome!💕 I truly enjoyed hearing about how business works behind the scenes when big brands have left over back stock 👏🏻🔥💓
It’s not in my Northern California store ☹️ or online I would absolutely buy the mini
Jeffree this video was so fun to watch. Im so glad you've matured so gracefully and able to laugh about this situation and donate the items you purchased. It truly is a breath of fresh air and other content creators need to learn from your ability to apologize and positive change. Also YES a Shane and Jeffree video is SO needed in the future! I miss seeing you both together. Literally rewatch the JxS series for good laughs and smiles!
Shane’s hello on FaceTime was so adorable 🥰
I MISS WATCHING UR VIDEOS LIKE THIS 😭❤️
I feel so good to see him back . The old jefreestar ❤❤❤❤❤
I MISSED YOU GUYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Yall backkkk
I miss old Jeffree that would scream from the top of his lungs for seeing his makeup at the second-hand store
They said “miss queens makeup where it’s never been before” love you Jeffree!
This was great I love the professionalism, “it’s just business, smart business.”
😑😑😑
Me: confused how he's at his mansion and thought he was moving back to Wyoming.
You could throw out your ace in and price match the products…given the choice of where to get the discount I’d prefer  the products origin. Throw in free shipping and your consumers are still your consumers…on the other hand this is a way for people to try your products with zero effort on your part.
Jefree, look at how much you’ve grown. I don’t regret supporting you even after everything that happened.
I am soooo happy to see yall in a video together again 💗💓 I miss the collabs
Jeffree done dug Shane out of his grave . Can I get Amen 🙌🏾 God is Good
OHHHHH SO Shane DIDNT KNOW about the "reunion" the whole premise of the video was to start drama at Shane's expense to promote your boring AF video where there was no "actual" reunion but a surprise face time call that was actually entrapment for your contrived video idea. Gotcha
Please donate something for homeless near your Area. Luv for you from India 💕💕💕
I’m loving the vibes
I’m so happy Shane’s back
Love the hair Jeffree it's cuteeeee
i feel like i jumped on a time machine and went back to 2019 lol
I have missed you and Shane so much :( I’m glad it’s all back and you seem to be doing so good in life!! All my love prayers and good vibes ms thang!!!!💚💘❤️💚
Love jeffree ❤️
San Diego Nordstrom Rack had it for sure lol
You look so happy and healthy ❤️
We Love a Humble Queen Yessss Jeffree🥰
I love that Jeffree and Shane are still friends given everything theyve been through 💕
I miss Shane! When is the Conspiracy 2.0 coming out? Or maybe name is Cancel Culture, or I'm Back Bitches. lol. Can't wait to see you and Shane in Wyoming together. I hope you go to Denver and do a vlog there, too!
Ew
I love the way he talks lol
Their baaack BITCHES! 👻
“3some jk” 😆😆
You are amazing.  I love your outlook on life.
Oh i get it its spooky season so ppl come back from the ded
the way jeffree sits on the couch lmao
Been waiting for this 😂 Thank GOD u posted this LOVE U MR.STAR
My boyfriend (accidentally) broke my Pig Mirror and when you said Nordstrom Rack said the mirrors were a hot seller I'm sitting here like, "mmmmm yes. Yes they are." Wondering when my boyfriend will buy me a new one xD  I can't wait to see Shane in a Wyoming vlog!
How the hell did the Ryland shade wind up there? I'm on the 4th one in life and that is my signature shade. I love it too because it doesn't rub off on the mask.
Chris filmed it!! 😍😍 I knew it felt familiar! 🙂 Lots of love and thank you for making it happen! 🙂
Jeffree you look more gorgeous.. How can this happen!!
LOVE U JEFFREE
Yayyy i love seeing you and Shane together ❤
She’s back 🥲
Went about it like the queen he is. Growth; we love to see it
The new camera man is shaky af
Yeessss finaly you and Shane together. 🥰😅
"The pig mirrors sold out ...Cue me & Shane moving to farms" lololol
I'm glad Shane's okay.  😌
This is why I LOVE J ⭐️…… moving forward and looking amazing 🤩
Aw I wish I had friends who randomly call/ft me like that 🥺
The cancelled sisters
I could see being bothered if it was at Ross but Nordstrom is considered higher end so I’d feel better about that. It’s only odd to me that the Rack has a product they don’t actually carry in their regular stores.
Hi Queen
excited for videos with shane! its been a while!
real talk i appreciate the fact that Jeffree acknowledged that throwback to tj maxx cause like girl shit happens at least youre human enoug hto be like oop
I’m really living for this wig 😍😍😍
I had a notification earlier saying it was 12 years ago since I saw Jeffree play a music gig at a small venue in my tiny city in the U.K. and now here he is… a millionaire. despite some of the bumps he’s had along the way, I can’t help but feel proud of him and feel good seeing him do better
I thought Shane was in this
Just adore jeffree! Always entertaining & girl you become so humble I love it! I think you always were or deep down! But you really do try to keep it real!  Being a transgender women myself. I really find you inspirational honey! Yes I am aware Jeffree star doesn’t identify as trans and that’s OK and I respect that.   Love Jeffree & Ill keep buying every collection. So It don't end up at Nordstrom Rack! Which i freaking love!
I miss these type of videos
It's nice to see videos filmed by Christian again! He has been truly missed!
Live Queen
looking stunning as always🥵.
🥰💜
These two together, I'm living. 😂🔥
I got the full conspiracy palette from tkmax in the UK for £12 (I had a £10 gift voucher) as at the time I could justify spending so much money on a palette when I don't wear eyeshadow that much. Because it was such good quality and I genuinely love it, I went out and bought 2 other jeffree star  palettes (blood lust and pink religion) and I will be buying the pricked palette soon. So it's good for business. Test out something for cheap and then start to buy all the makeup because you love how good it is!
Hello sweet angel, nice makeup haul. Xoxo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘❤️ princess
Yaaas
I just feel like Jeffree is lying. Large quantities of makeup doesn't just end up in stores like this, and Nordstrom isn't just buying it retail off his website lol Nordstrom is a huge company and not dumb. He usually limits the number of units you can buy on his website so the only explanation for this is **wholesale** lol it's ok to admit it Jeffree I'm sure you made good money hon!
It's my dream to run into you at a random store, Jeffree!  Love you!!!  :)
I love u so much Jeffrey, , kisses from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Dang that hair though it’s so freaking amazing ❤️ And I love how u have stayed strong ur so awesome I love u
OMG I've been waiting for more of my favorite duo !!!!!!!!!
It’s jeffree interacting with fans in the comments . We need more of this !!! 💕💕
I see really good changes in Jefree a whole new positive vibe coming from him. Glad he was bold enough to address this the the Jeffree ⭐️ manner wish is always entertaining.😂Shane just show up already lol.
I miss  you  jeffree  love you Grettings  from  philippines
I love you!!!!!!!!!! 💘
lame ass video
Okay, I LOVE the hair!
Miss thang we are going on a FIELD TRiP!!! Yassssss 👏 ♥️
Jeffrey we neeeed more makeup tutorials
Well my broke a$$ is happy because I can buy good stuff in that stores
11:54 their reaction to being hot sellers 😂🤣🥳
Imagine ringing up Jefree  while he buys his own make up lol
So happy to hear you both will be releasing videos again soon!! Yay! Happy you both are well ❤️
Never thought I’d love Jeffree and Shane so much! 😩😂💜
I love that you're open & honest. That you're relaxed & calm about the situation. This is what we love about you. Are little Mr. Jeffree star is growing up & i live for it.
Crazy how they bonded because they were both racists in the 00s
I love seeing how you came. I can't wait to see what's to come here and with Shane and Ryland. Good luck with everything.
I missed u mama
The tea channels were waiting for Shane lol 😂
What eyeshadow is that she’s wearing?
Holy fuck you look gorgeous in this video 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Thank God they are still friends I was getting worried
I can't wait for more content ✌❤
I miss you & shane
when you’re so rich that you go shopping to buy your own products on sale without your wallet
This has the old video feel , I love it !
I needed Jeffree and Shane so bad! I miss you two!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
So happy to see an update from you. Forever my Queen!
Why can’t everyone say out of everyone’s business leave them alone nobody needs to talk about the drama unless he wants to
Looking forward to the future Jeffree x Shane collab :D
coma visit sephora in the northshore mall next time you’re near boston!!!! 💞
This is the video I didn't know I needed but I DID
I love seeing you and Shane doing videos together. You guys are iconic
I love that you donate so much stuff. ❤❤❤
Jeffree you look amazing !
Jeffree, you have grown so much. Wyoming has really done so much for you. I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us!
Are you filming is my favorite shade
I’m so sad I thought Jeff would be like how dare they I’m calling corporate. Type vibes. And Shane would too. But like he said. It’s out of his control
I loved the vibe of this video, so chilled and good mood 🙂
I have missed your videos ❤️💕
I don't consider Nordstrom rack a clearance store per say lol
Ok but the MySpace hair and makeup! AMAZING! 🙌🏻 can’t wait to see Shane’s reaction to the Yaks and the farm. You guys are a great duo on video and probably even better in person.
makes me want to watch the series again
I honestly couldn't bring myself to care about the drama....i just miss these two so much😭😭
I love and miss the Jeffree out in public videos... they're always so crazy fun. Glad to see this up. :)
Love you Jeffree. This is the type of content I have missed <3
the drama and commentary channels would love this one—
I LOVE YOU JEFFREE
Ok I’m excited
True friends! Love y’all!!!
Hope Shane comes back. He should power through. Everyone has made mistakes, everyone have lessons in life. ❤️
When i saw the notification I had to check twice the thumbnail
Living for this, before it even started
Off to Nordstrom Rack I go😍🤣
I'm so excited that Shane is coming back! I miss seeing the two of you together, you guys always crack me up. Perfect comedy chemistry.😊
aw.. he's clearly upset about it. i also would be
Everyone should mass report this video. Remeber shane and jefreey are known child predators. Dont let there content distract you. They prey on kids.
Yes queen!
It's really nice to see you so relaxed about this.  Surprised, yes, but still relaxed. It's more evidence of how good Wyoming has been for you.  I know there are other things as well that have happened, it's what life does when it does what it does and we change because of it.  Wyoming is the most public and the change really shines in you.  It's the peace mostly that is most evident.  One question, off topic, but now that your raising Yaks, which is wonderful as they remind me of bison just with really long and very cool hair, do you think of yourself as their mom like you do with your dogs?   I was just wondering because you seem to really love animals and that would seem something that would make sense.
I looove the new you!
Jeffree has completely matured and im LIVING for it
I missed this so much ! I need more videos 💚💚💚
Good to see you back, I love your out and about vids.
I’ve been patiently waiting 😭 I missed Shane so much.
icons !!! we love you !!
I still love you both and appreciate your growth as a human being. Its easy yo get caught up in the hollywood lifestyle, glad to see your new earthbound life in wyoming. Youre beautiful and i see you getting yourself together. Good for you babe
I love the growth even though I’ve always loved you shady side lmao! But it takes a mature person to recognize stuff they did in the past out of spite and hurt! Bravo jeffree!!… i was hoping more Shane in the video but what we got was awesome! So glad to see you both laughing!… still wondering what happened to last weeks video
It's raining today in Illinois, thunderstorms and a new Jeffree video ❤️💋🥰 yaaaaaaas  You're unbelievably gorgeous Jeffree 🥵😍   Jeffree : "It's so quiet in here, it's just me , him and a security guard.... threesome..jk"  🤣😍❤️
Miss this face its good to see it
YEEEEES FINALLY 🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰😍😍
Girl you're glowing. Glad to see a new video😍
Jeffree: “Role the Series” Me: 🤣😂🤣
Girl bye!!! U dont know what has happened to it since u manufactured it. U need to come down off that high horse!!!
But his makeup has been on discount since waaaaay before.
This is so exciting to see!! Thank you so much for this video Jeffree!!
Hey jeffree, youve been missed queen. im a huge fan of yours and have been since your music days. Love to my Cobain is still one of my top favorite songs. Hope your well and keep your head up cause you do have people that care about you amd arent just here for tea🖤
Love you Jeffree. Just being open and straight up. I fucking Stan
Giving me that good nostalgia of the 2019 field trip vlogs 😭
i'm here for more jeffree videos!
So excited for videos with you both again! Miss both of you!
Ok girl cuz you know we been waiting!!  🥰
Ohhh hopefully I’ll have good luck finding some at my local Nordstrom rack
YES, Jeffree and Shane, together again! 💙💙
So happy to see her
So controversial
The first thing I looked for this morning was this video lol.  So happy to see you and Shane.  I can’t wait for more content, yasss!  👏
your content can always turn my day around love your energy Jeffree been a fan for so long. always nice to see your videos <3
Awee its so wonderful how jeffree  star is so nice to his fans.  Bleee his beautiful soul
More vids likes these!!!! Love field trips & sit down talks 💖💖
Bro if i had to buy the makeup for Jeffree my bank balance would be crying
Omg 😱
Not Jeffree buying his own makeup 😂
Do you buy all the makeup so no one can get a bargain, that’s so niceeeeeee. Ew
love your attitude on this!  Good of you to donate...  maybe you might donate to some of your subscribers who couldn't buy it.  Love you always :)
We love a Shane and Jeffree Collab. Yes girlll !!! Can’t wait for the next video ♥️♥️
We'res shane???
Love u 💗
Really just a 13 mins vid wtf happened AGHAHAHAHAHA
JEFFRREEEEEEE, You look amazing !!!
Gurl! You've been busy I know, but I missed your videos energy! Yaaas Queen!
Gurl!
Finally some more jeffree Star 🌟 content. I can't wait for videos with Shane
pls
All the tea channels thought you weren't going to post this and I'm so glad you did😅😂
That was soo childish actually
🤍
Even if you do not like Jeffree you gotta give it to him. His makeup/ideas/aesthetic always kill it. Literally nobody comes close to creativity and packaging...and the QUALITYYYYY🔥
🤍🤍🤍
I miss Jeffree and Shane
Me at work listening on low volume and closed captions: 🤫 The captions: today we’re going to northern Iraq  Me: 🥴
I like the way he smile whenever he's talking with shane, it's genuine.
Ohhhh I've so missed Jeffree making regular videos! And he looks so happy and wholesome! That makes me happy to see him happy
What’s the big fuckin deal?? Omg my shits at Nordstrom Rack!!! I dont get it
Yes finally good content 😂
Growing so much respect for you Jeffree. Addressing things in a mature way and moving forward 💛
We miss you jeffree 🥰
I swear J☆ IZA WHOLE MOOD, QUEEN. I'm HYPED to hear J☆ Approved reviews are about to be back in business! Also called this Nordstrom biz havin Morphe's name all over it. Love this outlook/attitude & if people can't see the change in J☆ at this point, giiirl byyyyyyyye!
I gagged a couple of years ago when I saw your products in an Ulta in Southern California. If I had my damn wallet with me!!!
Yessss xxx
Can't wait for the video of Shane visiting the Yak ranch!! It's so wonderful seeing you both so happy! I don't see anything wrong with the items being in Nordstrom, y'all already got paid for them and it gives people discounts so it's a win win!
It’s absolutely a smart idea to sell siting products
Nordstrom rack is def not as bad as it could be.
Literally don’t like you both sorry bye
I was hoping that Jeffree and Shane were still friends, I wasn’t sure but I’m so happy to hear that they still are! I hope they stay friends forever. 🖤
🙄😒😂
I miss these kinds of videos from Jeffrey. I don't want to see just makeup reveal videos. I want to see Jeffrey doing the old kind of videos where he made me laugh and enjoy makeup. Not just another cash grab video 😒
Shane’s comeback video needs to be a Shane and Jeffree collab.
When Jeffree says Miss Thing: Brings joy to my ears,
I'm so early that Jeffree is actively replying to comments??
So happy to see Shane again, I miss him!!!
I’m confused was this the full video? Or did part of it get left out since there was issues uploading. Expected a lil more but still so excited to see it. Looking forward to the next videos.
Role the series...🎶its the time🎶 🤣🤣
we love you!!!!!
Lawsuit????
Omg this funny but hey some people need afford it to lol jk
You’ve been missed!!! ❤️
I hope I get to learn business from you one day.
I disliked the video before watching but I liked it after watching it.  Love the transpersny and honesty
So entitled. You’ve lost touch of reality HARD. You should be happy people with little money can AFFORD your products. Absolute bellend
I am done! Your story 2 days ago!!! Claim that in this video we would have explanation to why a video was deleted. You didn't even f****** mention it. You bait and switch every single story. You bait people into watching your videos to get answers. When yet again it's still a commercial.
Both of my faves! Love you both 🤗❤️
I love this style of video! More laid back.
Oh no
Oh
Ok we all need this come back Shane and jeffree duo both the channels are dying bring back and don't change always be you and we love you guys ❤️
im not one to talk but the camera guy is a lil wobbly and its kinda distracting??? idk. i wish they just put the camera on a tripod tho jst sayin
Omg!!! Yassss I need some shane and Jeffree content!! ♥️♥️♥️🐷 ⭐️
Collab again!
🗑️ is where Shane belongs
all i ever been waiting for is a shane dawson & jeffree video again 🥺🥺
Soo exited came here sooo fast lol
UGH IM SHOOK was my favorite shade ever! It was the perfect lip color for me! I would love to get my hands on it again! The closest Nordstrom is 2 hours away!
I miss sooooo much Jeffree and Shane 😢😢😢😢😢  I’m still watching all the series together
this video could literally just be a tweet hahaha but i love it tho
The hair and that jacket is simply ✨stunning✨ I've missed seeing you're beautiful face love you baby❤️🥺
I'm not really bothered about Shane's reaction to be honest,  I'd listen to yours though...no hate just saying x
Love it!! Missed you so much♡♡
The absolute clickbait of it all.
We need shane back 😖😖😖
💗💗💗
Yes she is Baaaaaaaaack  I’m so happy you are back filming.  Love you
Girl you look Fuck*ng GORGEOUS!!! That wig with the set waves, and your eyes, those lashes...Damn! 😍 I heard a story years back about Paul Mitchell finding out that a bunch of his products were being sold in Kmart, so he went to a location, swept all of his products  off the shelf into a cart, and started to walk out of the store with it. When they tried to stop him for "stealing" he was like, "uh, No, these are mine, and you are selling them illegally" Unfortunately, I don't remember how it ended (this was over 20 years ago). At the time I was managing salons, and you were only legally allowed to sell the higher end lines if you offered salon services in the store. I don't know if that's still the case, but obviously Kmart didn't fall into that category. I'm so happy that you and Shane are going to be filming together again! I totally Stan your friendship, and I can't Wait to see the two of you having fun and laughing together again. It's such a beautiful friendship, very heartwarming 🥰 Say hi to the yaks for me 😁
I love how he's so soft with shane
Love this type of content! Happy to see this great change in you 🌹✨
I love that Jeffrey went shopping in LV slippers 😂 what an icon 😍💖🤍
I haven’t watched Jeffrey in a while, but now I’m actually enjoying it
This video is what my heart needed💕 I’m so genuinely happy for You and Shane. We all know you two have been through the worst of the worst but you both powered through and are still here happy, healthy and thriving. Wishing you both all the best and luv yas💕💕💕
I love boom for some reason lol… also love that Jeff always treats his fans
I wish they would of gone to the store together tho but this is cute too
Rubbish
I miss your make up reviews!! love to see some soon.  I miss some videos and snapchats etc because I'm trying to save money, and I know if I watch you I will want more and more of your make up!!  hopefully one day I will have all your make up. Love watching your videos you are the reason why I love make up.   P.S rocking that pink hair 💞💞
Finally a real video not selling crap.
I love the new J⭐️ he’s always been in there, just happy to see it!
Yaaass my mommies are both reunited and back!!!
So much for staying out of the drama, lol
Low key though Jeffree Star’s makeup belongs in a clearance store
I purchased the entire collection from that store including all three of the pig mirrors. And I was satisfied. You should put your make up in stores like this. There’s people who will go crazy. For those who can afford your make up but want it. It’s at a adorable price! Such a steal! I’m in love with the big palette so heavy was worth every penny! Loved all the colors of the lipsticks. 🥰
Jeffree it's been so longg
Yeees the Girls Are back 😍
So excited to see both of you in a video together!!
It’s fine that they sell it.   Don’t worry.
So glad you’re back
Nordstrom Rack is still not as bad as TJ Maxx tho 🤣
🖤🖤🖤
Hope to see shane more in the future 😭😭🥺 love you both!!
Love your vibe here. ✨
Put it back is still one of the best colours ever. Wearing it tonight out with my man! Thanks Jeffree for an amazing colour! Xx big love from London ❤️
I must say, relocating to Wyoming has certainly been doing you well. You look healthy, relaxed, more at peace, and I really admire how you have matured (I'm 40, I followed you back in the original Myspace days, and I quit buying your makeup when all that controversy was going on, so I've seen your progress). It's amazing how much of a positive effect relocating has on people. Keep it up. This Jeffree is the best yet.
When celebrity youtuber’s makeup isn’t as great as they think it is… shocker!
yessss shane and jefree are back yayayayyays
Amazing yes love seeing you both!!! Xxxx
hopefully this means shane will try to come back full time i miss his videos 👁👄👁
Jeffree!  I've been waiting on a vid since like forever now! Where have u been! - I hope you're doing well though ❤ 💙 💜
I WANTED TO SEE SHANEEEE 😭😭
yo whattt
I love you attitude lately its great! happy for you
Love the vids... Hi from Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Oh my God, I wish I live there and I can grab buy it myself 🤤🤤. I bought JS x SD worldwide ship to Indonesia with taxes 🤣 and totally WORTH IT 💕💕💕 Glad to see both of you ❤❤❤
Goodmorning Jeffree
i missed shane and jeffrey content
I can’t believe it’s already been 2 years since Shane and Jeffree’s video series 🥺
I missed you Shane🖤🥺
Obsessed
They don't have them here in San diego
You look so STUNNING & happy 💕
I love the new Jeffree ❤️❤️
Good to see you, please make more video's. love ya!
Ahhh it’s so good to see you !! I loved this video 🥰 can’t wait for another !
I still love you too!!!
he really made it seem like this was gonna be something with shane in the thumbnail.....
🖤👏 nothing wrong with your products being at a store that's discounted just makes it more accessible for those of us that cant always afford things and any store that goes out of business what ever inventory the have left basically gets bundled and sold to places like Nordstrom rack and tj maxx just because a business is closing doesnt mean they want to take an even bigger loss
Love y'all.
Awww Shane! 💜✨💜✨ love u Jeffree 💜✨
Lol @ Marshalls of all places lmfao!!! Awe sad!!
Loving the hair, love you still have a relationship with Shane, looks like when im up in la next week gonna have to check Nordstrom while im there!
Gotta love those clickbait thumbnails 🤣
Seeing humbled Jeffree is it
oh Jeffree I got the mini controversy for £7.99 and the full size for £18.99  in tk maxx in the UK
ha wow
See... That is a GOOD friend. ✅ "Yay!, I'm calling Shane!" 👉 Much love to both Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson. Love them BOTH!! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I don't know this store (i'm not from USA), so can someone please explain to me why is it weird that they sell Jefree products?
Finally! 🖤💚
Holy schnikes! Color me surprised…I had no idea that Jeffree Star cosmetics were that cheap (inexpensive) even at retail! D@mn, I gotta get out more.
Me immediately googling the closest Nordstrom’s rack near me!!!!!
I saw this and I was so confused.
But why was that pricked video deleted 😭😭
I'm glad you're doing good 🥰🌻
XD
Oh the horror of finding JSC in a discount store lol 😂 and it isn’t like a discounted store Ross or TJ’s Nordstrom rack I think is boujee discount lol 😂
😳
ahhh bitch I’m here early
So many memories flooding in
THEY'RE BACK YAY
So happy to see you glowing and talking to friends. Im excited to see some upcoming videos with this new happier version of yourself. I 😊
Can we get a life update on Shane??? So much seems to have happened
oh no...
I am so glad you finally made another video I miss them!!
Yassssssss
I wish I could find "Yes Ma'am" somewhere on discount!  My best color ever besides Mac "show orchid", MAC trying to find it, but couldn't, at least Revlon still has "Cherries in the Snow", And that's why I love "Masochist", but Yes Ma'am was the best and people took notice and asked where I got it!  And now it's gone, gone, gone!
I thought the thumbnail meant we’d see Shane & Jeffree together…weird
I never click so fast lol
Jeffree, you stay my inspiration for life. ♥️👑
Hi babes
I miss vids like this 🥺 can’t wait for the Shane content too !
And you laughed when other companies brands were in those stores. Now your title is one of em. Lol karma!!
Please review Rare beauty and About Face!
Only 13 mins?????
i love how happy Jeffree is in all of his recent videos! so glad you are in a great place now 🤍🤍🤍
"just me him and a security guard so... threesumm?" I SCREAMED
Omg OG problematic gurus
Yes the pink RR, let em know who’s home 💖
The energy in the video 📈📈📈 of happiness ☺️
Here before they get canceled again
I neeeeeed you to do more make up brushes. My JSCxMorphe ones are being trashed and I have 32 of them (I’m a MUA not a brush maniac)🤪
I miss this!!!
I literally screamed 🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱😱
Who cares? I love Nordstrom Rack. Sorry not sorry
Patiently waiting for more Jeffree&Shane content 😌
Happy your back. Missed U
We need more Jeffree and Shane content 🥺
So can we buy it at goodwill too 🤣🤣🥲🤣😂😅JK JK
The first time I'm early to a video
Can't wait for more videos!! 😍 happy to see Shane and Jeffree doing well.
Jeffree, that's crazy that the biggest pallete you've done is in North's drum. That's crazy! Looking forward to more videos!!
I miss you uploading a lot!
I’m gonna cry I missed this
THIS is how adults respond to issues. I cannot begin to tell you how proud I am of you and Shane. Both of you, continue being strong, continue being who you are and above all, rise above any hate directed your way. Love to you both <3
Love how you addressed everything!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your makeup is on clearance because no one wants anything to do with any of you anymore.
Seeing you and Shane again fills my heart ❤
Youre my fav. People can grow and change and the world needs more forgiveness. Never stop posting!! ❤️
It’s almost like this whole thing was planned. Like Shane comes back very slowly on rylands channel and now slowly on Jeffrees. Wow
Do update house tour please... Atleast we want to see black vault
“Roll the series!” HAD ME ROLLING LOL I MISSED YOU
What's with the camera man/woman shaking so much??? It's making me nauseous. Poor filming quality
You guys should do another makeup Collab I love my shane pallets
We need another series of jeffree and shane
The fact that this is happening was me like dam this feals different attitude everything about this video 💕😂❤💋
The clickbait🤡🤡
WE MISS YOU ❤
Can't wait with your new series with Shane. Love you jeffree. GOD BLESS YOUR HEART!! SO PROUD OF HPW BRAVE AND STRONG YOU ARE♥️
Jeffrees videos makes my day all the time 🥰
I'm so ready for the makeup community to go back to normal with YOU in it and running shit, damn it😭😭🤣🤣 we also need Shane back with his conspiracy vids🙏🙏❤❤😘
Who's 20 minutes early? 🙋🏼‍♂️
Literally everyone who have something to do with Jeffrey end up In deep shit .
Can’t wait for more videos with Shane! I just rewatched the whole series and have been binging on both your old videos, but I’m so excited for some new stuff!
Can’t wait for the new Halloween mystery box released video
This was such a delightful video to watch. Just seeing this shift in Jeffree is refreshing to watch. You can just see how being in Wyoming and stepping away from the epicenter of drama has helped humble him. 🤗
WOW cancel culture is real  i remember when Jeffree's videos hit 100k within 10 minute of uploading now its been 23 minute and only half of what he used to hits in 10 minutes
Honestly, glad to see it in the Rack. It allows us who can’t afford the full price to still experience the JSC magic. ❤️ Love ya, Jeffree
The tea channels are going to blow up with this video😗
this makes me so happy
Go Away
This was addressed with such grace and good attitude! Love seeing Jeffree happy and healthy 💖
I needed this
“The manager was so sweet though”   *probably the employees* 🤐🥴
What a waste of time
The frame rate of this video......
Thumbnail is the biggest clickbait ever seen
I thought Shane was going to be in the video😭
Need more vids like this instead of just reveals😭 miss the old days
“That would be my dog hair..that’s mine!” 😂 as a dog owner of multiple little chunky monsters, sammmme!
“Since I manufactured it…” such a mood 👑
Need more Shane and Jeffree content 🥰
Awweee. I love seeing the iconic duo on YouTube again 😍 . Can't wait for more content. I have missed watching you 2. 🖤🖤  I love the growth on you Jeffree. You look so much more healthier and at ease. 🖤🖤
Heyyyyy Mama Lynn. So glad to see new content. I've missed your videos. Hugs
2 minutes of Shane. God I can't wait till he comes back
SHANE OMG MAKE HIM COME BACK ALREADY
Love you jeffree!!!
Love seeing you looking happy again 🥰
We want another series with Shane
Laura Lee literally JUST talked about this in fools coverage. Its not that deep, its business 🤷 Happy to see you again!
Honestly, I know this has to make the haters so mad.  You all wanted to point and laugh and act like you were all a part of this whole negative thing. and it's just not working out for you.
I’m not gonna miss this one
I LOVE these follow me around videos
I want a video explaining why you unexpectedly decided to sell your LA house . We wanted the black marble closet fantasy and it didn’t happen. PLEASE EXPLAIN MY DEAR AUNT SALLY
Glad to see you happy and healthy <333
yayy! this is the content i want as a jeffree fan, not all the videos advertising his products. i mean, i like those too and i buy some of his stuff but this is the content that i love to see
I really don't get where was the problem.... it's old make up, years old, and any store is a store...
I love them sm omg omg omg
AYEEE
Where are Jeffrees nails😳
Yassss my favorite duo is back!!
Who the hell is videoing this? Are they on a 🎢 roller coaster?
A video of Jeffree visiting Shane in Colorado would be sweet and viceversa 😍
Why didn’t he leave it in there so people like me a broke bitch can actually buy it 🙄
like if you’re here before 30 minuted
Without even watching I always like , your beauty is just loveable 💙
I'm glad he apologized for past behavior and addressed what he said. I love to see growth from him ❤ this is exactly what I was looking for!
Jeffree Star just makes my day! When I'm depressed I can always count on him to cheer me up and today is definitely one of these days!!
So happy for him,he seems much happier and peaceful
Lol I would be walking straight out the store with my own product that I made. You ain't getting money for stealing my shit lmao
I'm so happy to see another video!
Got my Pricked palette yesterday and a new video today! Btw, the palette is more beautiful in person 😍
Yas Jeffree where have you been! XxxxxxxxxxX
Jeffree I would love to buy your stuff if it didn't have your logo on it...would've bought every Halloweed item but that logo...
Buying out your own make up? CaaaRAZY
They had Shane’s black makeup case as well. It’s so much better when you donate to women’s shelters instead of Goodwill. Unless you want @RichLux to film at Goodwill lol.
the thumbnail couldn’t have made me click faster
I think the vidio is so fast
Yayyyy! Just here to spread 💕 for you two pairing up on screen again.
Can we see more of you and Shane together? I miss seeing you guys laugh and be silly.
Here in the first 10 min... definitely not happy about Shane joining him while he still has never admitted and apologized to the things he's done.  He only made a half apology for things that he thought mattered but nothing about young kids and the things he's talked about he did to his animals.  I can't stick around and support jeffree if he brings back Shane
6m ago!
hello hello jeffree Star greetings to you cuteness of heart 💟💟💟 I love makeup are the best 🎼🎷
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE BLUSHES AND BRONZERS?
❤️🤍
Yes how are yah 🥰🥰

I’m sooo happy y’all are getting back together and making content😭❤️❤️❤️I’ve been watching re-runs like crazy during this pandemic
*Well this was fun!* Don't forget to go try new fast food items, if you feel like uploading some easy-effort content! Always a fun watch
Yay!  Good to see you guys🥰🥰🥰🥰
i was literally JUST watching scandal videos on Shane when this got uploaded…
His friend's haircut just
21 minutes ago wow
Jeffree Lynn is all grown up. 🥺 This video made me so proud to be a longtime fan. A video that probably would have been full of shade and anger a few years ago was full of love and being thankful and that’s so cool. 💖
I been waiting for your new closet tour unless I missed it !!!
I’m pleasantly surprised like wtf!😆😆so happy
I love you Jeffrey we have all done and said things we wish we didn’t but it shows growth when we are able to look back and admit how wrong we were!!!! Yeeeeessss to growth!!!!
I've missed your videos. Hope there are more coming!
I don’t know why but Jeffree forgetting his wallet to go to Nordstrom’s has me laughing.😭😭😭😭
JEFFREE!!!! 😭😭😭 OMG we missed yooouuu!!!!! Awwww, besties, talk about ride or die! 😘🥰😍😎💄
I want a pink religion pallete so bad 😁
I really missed you guys
Whooo I'm early for once!!! I love you Jeffeee!!!!!
I’m so glad you and Shane are feeling confident! I’m looking forward to more content from the both of you! :D <3
Yo
Haha I wish I had a deal like that, just got my conspiracy and mini conspiracy pallets at regular price... BTW so happy to see that Jeffrey and Shane friendship is still strong
Honestly I’ve been using my mini controversy a lot lately. Esp Put It Back & Cancelled. 💚💙
_Thats my name in your store!! _*_Relax_*  😂😂✨
Will we still get the lipstickNic video?
I love how Jeffree bought the makeup and is donating it 😍🥰 people like that is what we need more of in world!! Fucking mad respect to Jeffree Star!!!
Love love love the hair! 💗
Missed them both so much... 🙂🙂🙂
💜My daughter loves your makeup, but it can be costly (she still buys it) I will let her know it's at Nordstrom Rack💜
3:26 she thinks she's slick 🤣🤣
Yay glad you’re back
Hi Jeffree, how are ya?   You always ask us and I wanted to ask you today!
I’m loving your “so what?!” attitude Jeffree!
Past is the past especially when u face it and own it. True friends stay through the difficult times and I’m happy Jeffree and Shane are still in each other’s lives. I myself luv their friendship and videos. Glad they are sharing it with us.🥰💗🇦🇺
Awww Shane and Jeffree are going to see each other in Wyoming. I hope they do videos, like another series. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Havent seen u pop up on my notifications in a while. I feel the "im offended" vibes
IVE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY
idk about y'all but I'm glad jeffree didn't throw away Shane because of the backlash and stuck through with their friendship and you don't see that a lot in this industry/field
Okayy we just missing sister James now
THANK YOU FOR MAKING VIDEOS PLEASE STOP THE LONG BREAKS JEFFREEEE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🖤🖤🖤🖤
YES Bitch❗ Let's get it❗
I love how he laughs and doesn’t get upset about it.
Love how Jeffree full on becomes inspector gadget 😂 like I need to check it out
Some products here in Canada at the Marshalls I work at!
Give it to Jeffrey, he knows how to change bad publicity to gold
This is the best Jeffree we've ever had. Self aware? Positive vibes? Happy asf again? I LOVE IT
I love it!!!
♥️
🎉❤️
Hey I love to find a good deal in Marshalls or TJ   Max or the rack.. a good deal is a good deal
oh….
I wish I had one here! I would have bought it all I love you!
someone you trust and care about, sticking a knife in your back,...... one of the hardest things in life, not going to lie..  especially if it has been a ''friend'' for a long ass time. Good to know you're doing better and you're okay! also 12:13 ? Iconic!
Bout time Jeffree, we missed you!
This is the Jeffree we love and what more of! ❤️
Yes! I missed the adventures of Shane and Jeffree 😩❤️
YES!! Shane and Jeffree my favs 💕
Exciting
It’s wonderful to see how humbled you’ve become. 💕
Damn you have matured a lot!!!!!
I think you are doing so well.great attitude about your makeup being there. I love you and Shane so much and have missed  seeing you guys. make me so happy 😊😁
I missed this kinda content, where you go the store and buy stuff. I hope we get more videos like this, or just videos in general, like show us them cute yaks 😩
THIS BETTER BE GOOD FOR 13 mins
Mannn! I’m so happy to see this
Glad you're back.  And you are looking healthy.  Loving your hair 😍.  Guess you can get your makeup anywhere.  If it's on sale that's 💯 great for me,  I can afford it now.  But glad to see you.
I looked online..it's ALL gone now! :(
19mins in 😍
Come on, "I'm filming with Shane and we're talking about our makeup being in Nordstrom"...... Cue Shane being in it for 60 seconds.......
I adore you and I love your makeup. make more videos please ❤
OMG I miss you two filming together!! I cannot wait!!
I’m really impressed with your reaction. #Growth. Keep it up
WHO ELSE WAS SHOOK TO GET THIS VIDEO NOTIFICATION
Shane who? EW!!! Gtfo
I’m so glad  to see some changes in you! ❤️❤️ It will just make you a better person ❤️
I cannot believe the he just "forgot his wallet" and then made boom pay. How does someone that rich think it's ok to make his friend pay for his things. At least he said he was going to pay him back.
SO FREAKIN HAPPY 😭😭 this feels like old times. miss content like this.🥺
2019? YO THATS SO LONG AGO
Great video, I’ve missed these so much!
I missed your energy
“Shane is coming to Wyoming”… there better be a video! Lol!
😃❤❤❤❤❤ miss you're videos Jeffree 🙏❤
Like this camera filming style!
Where is ur back brace love?💙
Jeffree and Shane-  could my day get any better?!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Love seeing the Queens back!!!
im  so happy u guys are back again filming iconic and entertaining videos which other youtubers can't relate trashhhhh
This was such a trash video lmao like wtf
The video is great, but the filming is rough. I know you dont have a full team yet but whoever is doing it now is not it. Very shaky while jeffree is on the couch, the zooming and unzooming is all giving me vertigo 😂 the filming its not givinggggg
I love that you and Shane are still best friends and have stayed strong through all the bs! Love you both!!!
Jeffree this is an awesome video,  and I can’t wait for the Halloween boxes.
Karma
Sheesh
So excited to see you AND Shane! Glad y’all are back. Can’t wait to see Shane on the ranch
I’ve missed your videos Jeffree 🥺❤️
Found The Gloss and Mini Controversy pallet at Nordstrom Rack near me in Houston.  💄
Seeing Jeffree and how he has matured is really a great moment I think for him. I am proud to see him happy and healthy like this :)
Shane:,) <3
Ooohhh. Can't wait to see Shane at the Ranch...with the yaks! 💙
Am I the only one confused by the fact that when his stuff was in tjmaxx he was super super pissed, but now it’s basically in the same store and he doesn’t seem that upset about it? I’m confused
Can we acknowledge the amazing recovery Miss Starr has had from a BROKEN BACK!💪🏼💥 so happy For your physical and Mental health, Jeffree!
Ready for another banger
SOOOO HAPPY TO SEE SHANE AND JEFFREE TOGETHER AGAIN🥰!
Oooo Shane Dawson and Jeffree Starr reuniting!!!!!!! 💓
So excited to see you back doing regular videos instead of just merch drops.
THUMBNAIL is misleading.. skip to the last two minutes
Yes! It’s like Christmas morning! I’ve been so excited for this video. Glad it wasn’t lost!
Damn...i can find his brand in 1 store only and they usually have only few products😑
Here before everything
You should donate to beauty 2 the streets! They feed, clothe, give makeup and necessities to the homeless if skid row!
i absolutely love you and shane together. cant wait for more videos with you two x
NEVER CLICKED SO FAST
Omg omg omg THEY ARE BACK BABY!!!  I can finally die happy 😜❤️❤️❤️❤️
Idc I’m so glad y’all are back. Y’all took time off and reflected, apologized and YouTube has been SO BORING lately! People just need to get off their high horse and move on. We act like we’re the same people from 10 years ago or we don’t have anyone in our lives that’s an idiot and we stick by them because we see past their issues 🙄 let’s move on and enjoy entertaining shit from entertaining people!
Here before the drama channels
“She forgot her wallet”? No way…..Jeffree just refuses to pay for his own makeup.
Imagine buying your own products 😂
Not a quick 13 min vid😩😭 Jeffree!!
Queue everyone running their mouths for the last two days - their faces puckered up watching this video, trying to put their lives together. 😂😂😂😂😂
Welcome back queens!
I can’t help but be obsessed.. the way Jeffree said “hey gorge” to the person when he got out the car.. imagine being called gorge by Jeffree
I pulled over to watch this. It was not giving  what I wanted it to give. But I 🧡 both of them.  Can't wait to see what's coming up next.
Loving your energy completely different biiiiitchhhh ❤️‍🔥
What happened to the video of you and Lipstick Nick? Why did it get taken down?
I would've loved to see Shane with Jeffree but hopefully in that Wyoming collab and Shane can show us if he has kept up his makeup skills
The drama channels are scrambling at their computers currently making videos...
I was starting to think that u became more normal, but then ur with Shane soooooooooo… never mind
Yay!!! :)
It’s refreshing to see you have a good attitude about it. You and Shane were funny.
Paying money for your own brand 🦗🦗
I dont know why I'm so excited for this but I AM
I miss Shane and jeffree content
Here
Shane was only in the video for like 30 seconds WTF
Clickbait I thought Shane was going to be in the video 👀
I wish shane would come back to the internet
Cant wait to see you and shane back together 🥳😍
Ew not Shane acting blind to the fact that his stuff is at Nordstrom RACK. These people are losers
My daughter's and I are so happy for the new video! We love you Jeffree. You're beautiful ❤️
Omg omg omg
Is that it….. After all this time?
Loving the energy !! 💗 it was way to short of a video 😭

🙌🏽
I’m so earlyyyy for me
Watching Jeffree eat humble pie for 13 mins
This video reminds of god's 2019 old days
Good to see you mr.Shane
Shane isn't there till 11:00 , and it's a video chat.... if you are looking for him he's not really there. Also it's just because of Morphie and clearance.
I'm so happy to see y'all back and looking a lil refreshed! ❤️
Everyone watch before it goes down lol jkjk
Jeffree will always be iconic
Wait!!!! So you’re not gonna explain why you took down last weeks video? I thought you was gonna address it in this video 🤷🏼‍♀️. Maybe you did somewhere else. Idk. Can someone let me know please? edit: I missed that video that’s why I’m so nosy about it lol
I thought their friendship went to hell after shanes situations. In a way, Jeffrey is loyal somewhere so brownie points but ah bon
I miss you and Shane together fuck the haters
they are still Friends?
I see Shane's slowly trying to come back lmao
The growth over the years is very admirable, and miss thing doin it infront of the world. Nothing easy or normal about that and yet she's thriving ❤

I love your make up but I wish you would of left something on the shelf for those who might not be able to afford your make up from your site because your make up is amazing and everyone should be able to try it even at a discounted price.

Just here to tell Shane to come back.
Why didn't you talk about deleted video??????
You and Shane Dawson are absolutely two of the worst people ever.

This..this should be interesting😃
The growth from Jeffrey stating and showing his shade thrown and admitting his own hurt
Doesn't surprise me. Next is 5 below
How else clicked the *refresh* button a million times yesterday to watch? Just me?
Shane wasn't in this video, right? Did I miss him?

My god, who cares!!!!!!!!!
I am living for your personal growth 💜

The video I didn't know I needed lol
they said they were friends only for money and gain, but after they both got canceled  their friendship is still strong.  Haters on suicide watch.
Anyone get chill when they herd the song from the series…

I'm early wow lov u & ur  channel
I'm tired of the drama.. I just wanna be entertained. I'm ready for it
The shaky camera 🤢 got me dizzy
I see Jeffree, I get happy 😁😊
Why is shane in the thumbnail if the video doesnt include him
Is he visiting LA?
Might have to hit up Nordstrom Rack 😆
Shane Enters 10:59 mark. 😉
It’s not that deep… when criminals and people associated with criminals (jefffrey) come to light, your products should be destroyed so clearance is the next best thing 🤷🏻‍♀️
Holy fuck
YAYY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
Talk about unsteady/shaky camera. I'm glad it was only 13 minutes long,  because I'm getting sea sick.
The iconic duo is back !!!

Shane appears at 10:48
I saw Shane and Jeffree and clicked sooooooo fast!!!!!
This is being given a little later than I originally planned for, but, God directs our steps and I trust His timing.  I fully expected the Church to be raptured in September, however, as the Feast of Trumpets was approaching, I started to wonder if maybe I misinterpreted what God showed me. But, every time I had unsettling feelings, I reevaluated and chose to believe that what God revealed is Truth, as God does not lie. It's not that God chooses not to lie, but that He CANNOT lie. I didn't want a repeat of 2017 because at this point, what I'm sharing in recent times is reaching many more people than just my local community and I don't ever want to be a stumbling block for anyone. So if any of you are discouraged because of my mistake, I ask that you would forgive me. We're still here, but I thank God for that! It gives us more time to share the gospel so more people can be saved before the rapture. But we are running out of time!   Last November 3rd, the Lord gave me a flash of Biden's face in the evening, revealing that Biden would win. Not only did he win but everything is controlled by the Left, which hasn't happened in a very long time. God showed me that Biden's victory is judgment on America because we are under God's wrath.  Exactly 17 days later, the Lord gave me a dream, telling me, "Next Fall. Be Ready". The number 17 is significant. God gave me the number 17 in a Noah's ark dream, and then the number 15. In the Bible 17 means overcoming the enemy and complete victory. The number 15 in the Bible pictures rest that comes after deliverance.   I anticipated the Feast of Trumpets would fulfill the rapture, so I was very bold and intentional about telling people to be rapture ready.   I've felt a lot of discouragement recently but the Lord continues to encourage and comfort me. On September 7th, I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and then I went to the kitchen to see what time it was. It was exactly 2:23am. That was a God send! The number 223 had been given to me by God and I've seen it in numerous places, including a fast food receipt on the way to the zoo. This is the scripture reference.  3 The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. Proverbs 22:3 ESV  The following night, I was thinking about how I would respond if the rapture didn't happen, and I started to become discouraged again, wondering if maybe the enemy had deceived me. But I felt a squeeze on my arm by my shoulder and it was like God was saying, "I'm with you, keep doing what you're doing".  The enemy hit me in a moment of weakness the evening of the 8th and I just fell apart, thinking about the people who might be discouraged because of me. However, I began to reflect on what the Lord has been teaching me in recent years. God taught me the value of taking Him at His Word.   In my November dream God revealed to me that my faith is strong, and that I would continue to clean up the pool (help others with sin issues and correct incorrect doctrine). And Jesus instructed me to read scripture daily, none of which the enemy would have shown or said to me. And because Jesus told me "Next Fall. Be ready", I believe Him. He told me the year and season, just not a month or day.  Watchman on the wall 88 suggested that Jesus may fulfill the Fall Feasts close together just like He fulfilled the Spring Feasts close together. Initially, I didn't think that was accurate. However, since we're still here, I now believe he's correct. Some were saying that the Feast of Trumpets was off by a full month, and ((if)) that were to be true, then the rapture would likely fulfill the Feast of Trumpets, but at this point, I don't think it will. I'll explain why.   Pastor Dana Coverstone had a series of dreams, one of which showed him covid-19 before it hit. In his part two dream, the month of September was underlined and tapped 3 times. Then the month of November was underlined and PUNCHED!!! Because of the part 2 dream, I thought it was showing a September rapture and war in November. But now I believe it's showing a birth pain in September and rapture in November. But, with how things are going, it's definitely possible that war could happen in November as well.   Several years ago, I had a dream with God the Father. We walked on the sidewalk and then paused by the intersection. It was during the night and completely dark except for the light coming from the light poles and buildings. There were leaves on the ground and they had been on the ground long enough that they were crunchy, and I could hear the sound of the leaves being blown by the wind. The leaves start to fall, perhaps the beginning of October? But certainly by November they are pretty crunchy. As the leaves were blown along by the wind, some of the leaves went up into mini tornadoes. I now believe that God was showing me the rapture would be in Fall, but not necessarily for the Feast of Trumpets.   Brothers and sisters in Christ, we are absolutely going to be raptured soon! I don't know the day or hour, but what Jesus told me gives me hope and I want to encourage you that were going home soon! The mark of the beast (WO2020060606) is currently being developed! The Church must be removed before the antichrist can be revealed, and the mark of the beast will not be available until the antichrist is revealed! Be intentional with the time that remains. And keep your eyes on Jesus through daily prayer and scripture.   God bless you and keep you always friends in Christ! Jesus Christ is returning! BE READY!  💖🎺🕊️💖   10 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. Galatians 6:10 ESV  8 I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” Luke 18:8 ESV  35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. 36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. 37 For, “Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; Hebrews 10:35‭-‬37 ESV  12 “Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Revelation 22:12‭-‬13 NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/rev.22.12-13.NIV

Guess y’all were being a little dramatic about them being “too scared to upload” 😏
People can say what they want but I'm so happy to see both of you and we get back to the normal content ❤️ both of you are so flawless ❤️ I was talking to a friend of mine and we came to realize that the new generation is so ready to cancel you for stuff you guys did years ago!  despite

As much as I hate to say it, this happens to all brands at some point. Marshall’s, Nordstrom’s, bealls outlet, etc. I’ve seen it all at these stores. (I haven’t personally found any Jeffree Star stuff, but have seen some other big name brand stuff like Disney, Star Wars, beats, apple, etc.)
I am happy to see you both! May your friendship continue for ages!!
