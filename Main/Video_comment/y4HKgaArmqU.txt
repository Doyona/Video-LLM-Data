Funny how the game can’t make decisions like the organizations
How do you make spurs get the first pick in current gen?
THIS VID PREDICTED MANY THINGS WTF, CAM REDDISH TO THE LAKERS
This draft class pretty nice
Basketball Gods: Sorry about Kawhi, Spurs fans. Here’s Wemby to make up for it
WEMNY & SOCHAN ohhhhh thats something
Do one with Dejounte Murray coming back to sa
This works in current gen ?
how do you get the correct draft order for this???
How do we download the correct draft order?
He's not a 5. He's a wing
ay
Im new to 2k, could anyone tell me what game mode he is playing and how to get it.
He’s so dominant that it honestly gets boring playing with him cause you can score with him every possession, collect every rebound, pull up from anywhere, and block 10+ shots
Victor better watch out for them big ol' women down in San Antonio😬
Plot twist: The spurs choose ishowspeed
Will Manu or Tony  be part of the training team past few years back the retire Timmy was part of the coach staff the Spurs family is tight in San Antonio. Vic, is with the best organization in the NBA to develop and win lots of Championships
Jimmy Butler does rebuild. Bruuuuuuh
Y’all forgetting the spurs tanked on purpose by trading Dejounte Great Move!! 🎉🎉🎉
How do I do this
I feel like this guy is going to be amazing on defense on prob a top 10 scorer as well soon
Spurs are so set, with all our picks, depth, and money we will succeed. Especially with a greattt coach, staff and organization as a whole. We aren’t a big market team so Wemby won’t have as much pressure on him which is perfect. We will build an amazing roster around Wemby, and even if he does struggle with injuries we will build an elite team without him. The Spurs Dynasty is BACK!
🤍🖤❤️
I'm not a Spurs fan, but I'm glad he went there just for the sake of his development.
Day 1: Do an all time fantasy draft, every player with their highest in game rating and no duplicate players. The team you draft must consist of the lowest rated players in the draft (can only draft 70-75 overalls) and try and win a ring in under 5 seasons (tip: free agency is Lowkey ur best friend in this challenge)
Can you do a derrick rose jimmy butler and anthony davis what if
23:39 "idk who rupert is" rayan rupert is also a french player and he played for the nz breakers last year also is projected to go 17 in the nba draft this year @kot4q
Talkin about your system being loud... is it a PS4? Cuz my PS4 sounds like a damn jet engine tryna take off lmao
I think the best thing for long term success for vick is gonna be finding a penny to his shaq. Need a lottery pick point guard to set him up for easy looks.
Reality check time: Wemby has been sold to you by the same sports talk conmen and mainstream media shills that tried selling the Lakers, gave us a BLM MVP in Embiid, told us the Bucks were unstoppable, that the Suns were a superteam, that Sacramento wouldn't make the playoffs, that Denver couldn't play defense, that Jokic was overrated, that SGA was an MVP candidate, and so on batting a flat .000 with everything they've said. Wemby shoots a dismal 30% from 3 🤣, has trouble with tall defenders, more trouble with fast players, has played against absolute trash competition, and has a history of multiple injuries in a league playing 34 game seasons with 10 minute quarters 🤣. Wemby is a GENERATIONAL BUST. As a profitable smart money bettor, I'll be taking multiple bags off dumb money happy to get pied-piped into not being able to pay their rent drunk on the bro kool-aid.
How did u have the draft order like that
2k really like the Cavs, the Hawks or the Pelicans this year for some reason. They always in the finals
How did Kenny get the correct draft order?
Why don’t you just load in the future draft classes bru
The irony of this video hurts
The real solution is either ACTUALLY use your other characters like giving Vegeta and ACTUAL main villain win or Gohan etc. or having a reset like Boruto did for Naruto
Jordan poole on the spurs ain't it, them San Antonio woman will leave him scoreless
18:00 he's alone i hope that never happens
Lmao this is wild, Wemby was in your comments years ago asking you to do a career sim on him. Your time is now young fella
Rayan Rupert might be nice
as a cavs fan other than that 3-1 comeback that simulation was kinda fun
as a cavs fan i liked this video
Victor webmenyama will win 4 championships. First one will come 3-4 years after he joins the league. Afterwards, he’ll win every other year.  Edit: I’m talking about in real life by the way
I hate that they rewarded the spurs for throwing this season
Damn, you’re so damn fast with the buttons going through the menu, I can’t even keep up.
Want to know what the funny thing is?   I specially remember comments made by an account named "Victor Wembenyama" in Kenny's rebuild video asking if Kenny could do a video on him/a career sim (if memory serves me right) but Kenny never did so, pretty sure the comment also mentioned his age of 16 🤷🏻‍♂️💀  Everything comes around, people get left on read
Killian Hayes should make his way as the starting PG for the Spurs if he isn’t happy with his Detroit role. Let Jones Back up
Imagine if the spurs pass on Wenby
Love seeing my cavs in this video breaking records and winning another chip!!!! I’m so glad we got Donovan Mitchell I hope he stays here forever
What roster did you use?
The clippers got giannis in this video and still couldn't break the curse
I’m pretty sure Vic is 7’5 is correct if wrong
Greatest prospect since Zion*
That Pistons team that made the finals 2 straight years was loaded I can only dream
Boomer Small 100% Australian haha
So goated
73-9
Warriors went 79-3
As a long time spurs fan this is great for us. The lineup of Jones, Vassell, Keldon, Sochan and Wemby is gonna be fun to watch
Ja shows a gun and gets Mvp
Harrison Barnes and Kevon Looney been in 2 73-9 teams !!! They are the GOAT @11:04
Next up hornets with scoot?
Imagine taking a 5”10 point guard 3rd overall
Quick question because whenever i ask Stacy King or Adam Amin they ignore me on twitter because we got into it about me saying that they praise every team that the Bulls play and how the Bulls just cant get it together (long story), but whats the difference between a 2man game and a regular assist?
those Cavs could really be us if we invested in some depth :(
isaac okoro icing the spurs at the end of game 1 made me very happy as a cavs fan lol. we just want bro to hit his shots
my dawg kenny had the wrong 2024 draft class😭
Gotta say, the way the CPU handled the franchise is the worst-case scenario for Wemby and the Spurs. 😅 Thanks for the vid.
Put Dwight Howard’s Taiwan super team in 2k
imagine all this and they pick scoot
Big bottom half of the face had me choking on my burrito 💀
10:30 bruh zion would put a hole in Victor chest i don’t care how tall bro is he can’t guard him 🤣
How they bouta make em work on 2k cuz he 7’4 and move like that
Make a video where you control the teams he goes to and build a great championship team around him!!!
Victor literally got everybody back on the Spurs again 😭 never thought id hear the crazy honking like we won a championship again downtown
Nah 2K is stupid. There is no way the Pistons get the 3 seed next year after getting 17 wins this year.
Long KOT4Q vids>>
As a Piston's fan I saw this coming from a mile away.
liking just for the fact the hawks won the finals :^)
Come on NBA there are other teams
haha, Pop would never bring in Westbrook and Melo
please do more 'career sim' type vids, this was really interesting
Dmills crying
Cavs just got the first pick in the 2003 draft! You should do a sim of his career there.
kenny when you are in rotations, if you press rotation timeline (start button) you can edit how much minutes they will actually get
I hope Vic ends up living up to the hype but he should definitely play PF and be more like a KD type of player and once he bulks up a bit he can move back to center.
Can you win a championship with a Disaster Draft? So pretty much what a Disaster Draft is, it’s if 5 or more NBA players die(for example team plane crash) that team gets to participate in an NBA disaster draft. Each NBA team is only allowed to protect 5 of their nba players. For example the warriors would protect Steph, Klay, Poole, Wiggins and Dray. However, only one player can be chosen per NBA team, so a player like Kuminga would get drafted. Each team has their own five players that are untouchable and everyone else can be drafted. Win a championship with a Disaster draft team! That would be a dope watch. Remember you can’t take two players from the same team.
yooooooooooooooooooooooo
Video Idea: If Chris Paul Was 7’0” Tall
Can You Trade SAS  (Victor Wembanyama)  to OKC for (Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, Pick 2024 Hou)
I run injuries between 32 and 35, I find it to be a fairly realistic rate. Any higher and everyone is built like AD.
Challenge idea: Make a wheel of numbers 40-99. Whatever number the wheel lands on is what overall player you can get. Do this 10 times until you have a full roster.
Let’s go pistons lol winning in 2027 lol I’m ready
Vic has so much potential, I just hope he can stay healthy
Too skinny, dude needs at least 4 years in the weight room to deal with guys like AD and Jokic. Wembys a skinny immature kid, hes gonna be roadkill for at least 2 years. He'll be lucky if he doesnt sit out significant time a la Zion and Chet due to injury. This dude is not ready IMO
Clique did the same thing and bro the spurs had devonte and russ in wemby’s first season too wtffff 😭😭😭
Kenny a fun challenge build a team with teammates of George hill or Jeff green  and u have to try to go 82-0, 6 rings and 2 three peats.
I remember watching the 2013 finals and it was the first time I watched my favorite team lost in any professional sports championship. I remember the hope I had going into the 2014 playoffs and winning the championship. I was 13 years old. I even remember where I was when we last played our game 7 playoff game against the Nuggets back in 2019. I can now add the 2023 lottery results to those great moments as I was with family. Right at the announcement of the 5th pick I ran to my room to put on my Tony Parker jersey and i screamed in excitement knowing we now have Wemby
#21 on trending!!!
Should’ve put the 24 draft class
Rolled out to Dallas to team up with Luka, what a STRAIGHT UP SAVAGE !!!
I can't wait to see his career end with injuries 😂
jarace went to my rival school in middle school and played w my brother
i feel like they putting too much stock into him
Can you please simulate the NBA TNT all time draft???
How do you get on start today with the 2023 draft class
4:24 bro acting like bron doesn’t retire in every video
why is brandon ingram an 84 overall at 27?? disrespectful as hell
I have a hot take: Scoot Henderson will be a better pick for the first 3 years
So, basically, this video implies that Wemby is only staying to finish off his rookie contract and then he's gone...😢
23:41 "...it ain't more than 8 hours..." With all the construction on the I-10 between the two cities, it can feel like 8 hours...but it's only 3.5.
The spurs are the type of people to select scoot instead of vic
They had the hornets take jarace walker 😭
2:16 Okay, restart the sim, because there is ZERO chances on Earth or in Heaven that Westbrook is leaving his backyard in Los Angeles, where he was born and raised, to come to boring-a$$ San Antonio.  And I *live* in San Antonio.
Would it be dumb if the trailblazers traded Dame and the #3 pick to the spurs so they could move up to #1 and get wemby?
anyone who ever watched the Andy Griffith Show knows of Ernest T. Bass🤣
Seeing team darrius is crazy bro
not saying he will be a bust, but I won't be surprised if scoot handerson has a better career
Best spot for wemby by far! They might’ve had a loser season but, they are far from a losing franchise!
Kings drafting Kris Murray is the highlight
Go Spurs Go! Wembanyama wish you a great career and the best of health!
That's basically just like Giannis's career
Dang y’all on his D … already sheesh …
Big bottom half of his head 😂 5:15
He next great French in big man from the spurs
Dude hasn’t played a single nba game and we’re already saying he has a chance to one of the greats? Let’s see him finish a season first 😂
27 sec in and Jarace Walker for 2nd pick is WILD!!!.... sounds like a Hornets thing to do though.
now do with scoot henderson on hornets too pls
Try a team of full former coaches and see how they do (u can use the era mode and start in 2002)
5:00 rockets use the 2nd overall pick to draft a 74 rated 23 year old
even wemby made the conf finals once he won mvp
Thats gotta be the most impressive finals mvp stats ever 50/50 shooting splits 3 blocks + 1 steal 30pts 14 rebounds and 5 assist is ridiculous 34:12  Edit: not to mention the 3-1 comeback
Do something for the rockets please
Bro that’s Kyle Rittenhouse 19:44
I need my Cavs to get that team in real life😂😂
The Spurs may be a well oiled organization, but 2k is not a well oiled video game of realism
Bros had his whole career played out before he’s even been drafted😂
Make the tallest team in the league with wemby????
Kenny, please eventually do a vic vs LeBron career sim
33:35 cold catch by the ref
He’s gonna be a bust
Video Idea: build a team of only 30+ year old star players who have never won a championship to get them all a chip as they are getting older and they careers don’t have too long left
In french championship, he plays pf
Day 2 of suggestion: Do a 5 year “No loyalty” challenge where you build a team that wins a championship and trade every player of that team and win more championships (players can be brought back after new championship is won) the challenge doesn’t start until you get your first ring and doesn’t end unless you win 5 straight or fail doing so
Challenge idea: With the Thompson twins coming in next season, how about a challenge where you try to win the chip with a roster made up only from Twins or brothers? Like maybe 8 men rotation, few seasons to try and achieve that. You could twist that up a Little bit into your likings. Splash Bros excluded ofcourse.
I still can't get over the fact that my rockets missed out on him because of a coin flip. (rockets and spurs had the same record so the odds between both team had to literally be decided by a coin flip)
I know he’ll be making these draft classes, but they have them listed at 230 not 210 smfh
*cries in the fact that the pistons will suck again and we have honestly nothing to look forward too in the next decade bc even if we had 0 wins we would still drop to 5 bc adam silver sucks chinas dick to maximize profits and detroit is too low of a market to give a real generational talent too.. sorry cade ur jersey still hangs in my room don’t worry.. and no free agent will come here even if we would to give them a super max, at the same time all the great coaches that were available are gone… woohoo live being a pistons fan…*
BRING BACK THE REBUILDING GOD SERIES FROM BACK IN THE DAY KENNY!!!!
I hope you make these 2k videos until you’re 50 because I’ll still be watching
Eyes very far 😂
Spurs got a crazy young core of Vassel, Johnson, Jeremy, and Wemby
Why Bass got a bag like that tho 😭32:40
Make this a series for the highly touted draft picks!
THANK GOD , EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON
IF IT’S IN GOD’S PLAN
How many takes to get the 1st pick this time?
Imagine if the Spurs don’t draft him
Kenny : 22-11= 10
That thumbnail is so clean
He ain't 210 he 230.
as a spurs fan I was waiting for this video!!
Can’t wait for him to play his tip off game
I’m in the vid. Cool
I wish you showed jersey retirements
Scoot and Scottie the Raptors would be the TEAM
We still waiting on game 7 on your other channel
I came yesterday. I am a big spurs fan and I hope they win more than just another 5
For the ppl that already think injuries are automatically going to be an issue here’s my fair take: Obviously he hasn’t played an 82 game szn yet but then again nobody in the league plays a full szn anyways and I think it could be a concern given the history of taller players, but ultimately I think it’s unfair to place that label on a guy that has no prior injury history‼️‼️‼️‼️
I think his career is going to go a lot like those first two seasons in this video unless he seriously bulks, gonna be bullied by most other centers, possibly be injury prone with his frame.
14:12 this whole free agency has me weak 😂
Being behind dame ruined scoot 🤦🏽‍♂️
Stop letting the computer generate the following year picks and make them real as well for a few years. Makes the video way better
it’s about a 4 hour drive from houston to san antonio
Dude gon get injured within a year , I’ll give him 2 max
I have Vic on my save and no matter how good my team is i can not win a ring
you should live stream your career sims and talk abt ball in between or sum
yo
Who is this guy i feel like he could make a channel similar to kennyforeal would be entertaining just talking basketball
Yo the Cavs were going crazy in this
DG is a 2K sim goat
I find it so funny that Cleveland of all teams did that
Those statlines look very similar to Kevin Garnett statlines
The 2k Russ disrespect is crazy
IT TRIGGERS ME SO HARD THAT THE HAWKS R ALWAYS GOOD IN THIS GAME I LITERALLY MAKE EVERYONE ON THEIR TEAM 40 OVRR F*CK THEM
i swear 2k love darius garland
Watch the spurs not pick victor
As a rockets fan I am openly salty and I hate everything
No way Luca was on the Suns 37:20 ish
whatever vic you downloaded never download that draft class again ahaha he shoots like 25% from 3 in real life
How is darius so op in this simulation
kyle filipowski ate wemby up in the second game of the season, love to see it
I agree with the 2K sim. No way he’s the greatest prospect ever. It’s a shame he won’t really live up to these lofty expectations
BANGEEEER as usual 😮
start using draft classes past 2023. i think things would be more interesting
aint no way hornets not getting scoot
i’m not sure whether it’s the sliders or it’s the roster but the player progression seems so stagnant. brandon miller was 83ovr in 2026/27
Annoying thing about 2k is how much they disrespect Jeremy Sochan. Bro could easily be a future star but they refuse to let him progress.
Kenny try making the greatest defender of all time. It would be hard but see if a guy can average a 5 by 5 throughout a whole season
Let’s go pistons…. Was really hoping I could get into basketball this year after never being able to have much confidence in the team
GO SPURS GO
Impossible challenge: You pick a random team and with the fantasy draft you put fixed and draft order and give yourself the 30th pick. Do a 3 year rebuild and attempt to win a championship
Thank you Kenny
Why tf they put my name down as Sammy
What if the spurs think wemby is too much of an injury risk due to his height and picked someone else
17 wins gets you 5th pick....
we need a knicks rebuild
It made me sad when I realized Greg popavitch has to retire soon
It would be crazy if they don’t draft bro
The over try:  you have to do a fantasy draft and every single time you lose you have to make a new team try your best Kenny.
Boomer Smalls was literally on the Spurs in the sim lmaooo
Day 10 of asking Kenny to do the No Same Team challenge   The No same team challenge is simple, all you have to do is do a fantasy draft and try to create the best team possible BUT you can’t have anyone who has been on the same team ever  For example you can’t have Lebron James and Tyler Herro because they have both played for the Miami Heat   I hope I explained it well and hope you use it Kenny
Low key, Ausar Thompson on the warriors looks nice
please do a video where portland trades their pick and gets dame a championship
I’m not even lying I watched it live and cried when they announced it. Been waiting for this😊
Kings drafted Kris Murray lol
i’ve actually been doing this for the last 3 months lmao. Blake Wesley, V.W. and other future draft picks got there jersey retired! 9 Chips and 9 FMVPS for Vic. 2k loves that guy and It’s weird that I called it 3 months ago lol
I got into basketball while the spurs sucked so I never got to live the glory of the Timmy and Kawhi era so this is the happiest I’ve ever been as a spurs fan
I feel so bad for Victor being on the spurs
0:31 ima lose my shit if the hornets fucking pick walker in real life
The 7’5 Demi god is exciting for every basketball fan, regardless what team you like you’re excited to watch Vic😂 you don’t see dudes like him everyday
Kenny you should simulate his whole career now
If there’s one coach who can make wemby an all time great. It’s pop
Imagine they don’t even draft wemby lmaooo
Kyrie retiring as a Celtic 😂
Keep up the good work Kenny you are my favorite 2k YouTube and of all time
Yo Kenny flaming them autogenerated players "Big chin...Big bottom half of his head" "Sammy Walker, whose eyes are very far apart" lmaoooo
I’m watching this under duress as I wait for the next Nets episode
How do u use nba today?
These past few years have been tough to see but I like the young squad plus we gettin victor I was so hype
17:55 idk why I found this so funny but I was crying laughing
only if the simulation put the rookie 77 instead of Weasley 73 :/
He needs to not do a Chet and get hurt during summer pick-up games
Starting as an 85 is criminal
Whoever made this save file, needs to delete 2K immediately
24:34 bookmark
D mitch the kd
Yessir
Damn Kenny did that quick
Injuries build character but not content lol. Love the vids bro.
I’m from Detroit and I couldn’t believe that they didn’t at least get pick #3
imagine this dude turns out to be a bust lmao
If you refuse to let Popovich retire how old will 2K let him get 🤔
i predicted this was going to be his next video
Victor’s created character looks like Jaden Smith
Do this with scoot or the 2nd pick
We’ll never see an MVP only average 24ppg. That’s a thing of the past. They got that shit wrong as h
THE KINGS PICKED KRIS MURRAY LMFAO ITS DESTINED TO BEEE
2k hates the spurs lol
Getting a perfect team in these videos is rare. Shout-out to the Cavs fr🎉
The fact that Wemby played with Ernest T Bass 🤣
Spurs on top ?
I’m sorry but ANT to the Jazz in 2024 2K? Really???!!
I don’t believe in him like everyone else
Wemby gonna get bodied if they play him at the 5. They're going to have to play him at the 4 until he get his weight up. He's gonna get abused down low no matter how big he is. NBA got plenty 7 footers with 20+ pounds on him. He will probably do go on offense but he is definitely going to get bodied a lot
As a Raptors fan, I am so happy for the Spurs. This all started with the Kawhi injury, and the butterfly effect has brought them here. Actually kind of crazy.
w vid
Day 84 of asking Kenny to do the 5 for 5 challenge  First year win rookie of the year Second year Win 6th man of the year  Third win most improved  Fourth win DPOY 5th win MVP and finals MVP  6th-9th year to win  3 championships  Also set draft quality to max you have 3 try’s to find your player Good luck Kenny!
I hope he’s a bust
Rashad Lewis baby 🔥
yeah definitely scoot henderson and not scott henderson
I just hoped it was not the pistons Cus I hate them
Pistol Pete got the MVP
Day one of asking kenny to play the Watson scott test
As a pistons fan… oof
rebuild the spurs around Victor and make him the GOAT
SPURSSSSSSSSSS
18:30 Was waiting on that to happen.
maybe my spurs can go back to perennial making the playoffs. my childhood and teenage years saw the spurs win 4 their 5 championships
I almost missed the Murray brothers playing together.
Yall remember when wemby would comment on kennys vids saying he would be in he rebuilds one day 🥹
Pistons fan here I hate the nba 😢
Watch this man be a bust 😂😂
The Spurs rarely get a no. 1 pick. But when they do you better believe theyre drafting a generational player
Y'all remember when Victor would comment on Kenny's videos and say that he would be using him in rebuilds one day?
You have to make Wembeyama Spurs rebuild.  2k trades are kind of trash, I would like to see a Wembeyama-led superteam get a 3 peat.
I don’t think the wenbanyama has the team team carrying potential to have immediate success. Yes, he has huge potential, but when you look at players with team carrying potential in the NBA, they’re all exceptional playmakers. Lebron, Curry, Lillard, Jokic, they get the team involved and contributing. Victor isn’t a playmaker like that, and he doesn’t have the game breaking abilities of someone like Curry with his shooting or Lebrons athleticism. Wenbanyama is phenomenal for his size, shouldn’t move like his does, KD like. But that means he’s playing within the rules of the game. Jump shots are a percentage game, and nba centers will be better suited to defend him than the centers he picks apart now. So I don’t think Wenbanyama will have the early impact some expect, it’ll only be later when he hones a game that can’t exploit the nba defence that he’ll truly reach his potential
Day 5 of asking! Simulation idea: run back the 2019-20 season and see who wins the championship! If you don’t win the championship in the first three seasons that is fine but after that you have to trade the best player on your team! You can control what ever team you want! Also you have to use real draft classes to 2031 if you make it that far!
Can you do this with the rockets? I’m sad after the lottery
i really hope he can stay healthy. that tall and skinny seems like it could be problematic
I am happy to see spurs relevant again
Would the biggest fumble in the world be if the spurs draft someone else other than wembanya?
Ross Tucker is from my city
Imagine we all hype up vic going to the Spurs and they take scoot😂😂
kris murray with his twin lol
I hate the spurs but I’m high key happy for the league getting such a talent, should be fun to watch!
His strength better be 40 or lower
I don’t think Victor will be as great as everyone else thinks. I’m on the record as saying it. I hope I’m wrong. If I am wrong, I’ll be happy. I just don’t think he’s strong enough to hand with the other bigs in the league.
You should play a myleague but you can only sign players who's names wouldn't be allowed by 2k😂
Am I the only one who think Vic is pretty severely overrated?
Please play the career of brandon miller
Let’s see if the spurs can get a dynasty vitor 😮‍💨
the beginning has that 2k realism, SA doesn't just let players walk like that
9:40 they put accessories on the shoulder when is a shoulder injury
17 wins,  our superstar player suffers a season ending and probably career altering injury and we get rewarded with the 5th overall pick. Oh boy cant wait to watch Cam Whitmore with Cade Cunningham. Surely thats a better duo than Victor Wembanyama. I love the lottery.
Victor wet bananas
I wonder if kenny ever messes with the mentorship stuff. Melo might have been a good mentor for wemby
I like how he said Wemby 31:54 got the block but it was 5’10 Bass that blocked 7’0 Mobley
hopefully the sperms can take advantage of this victor wentbananas dude
I wish my Warriors hot him or sccot but congrats
As A Hornets Fan, I’m In Pain
I am French and I hope that Victor will win everything in the NBA 🙏🙏
Rockets get the shaft yet again
I think vic gonna be like Gianni’s, start a little weak but bulk out as he goes through
new rocket that’s jalen green eeee 😂😂😂
They won't play him like for two seasons bro
Am I the only one that believes that Victor is going to be not that good as people say (not a BUST) but not a not good of a player
Bro the draft lottery is rigged
Spurs have pl Aged the lottery 7 times and have gotten jackpot 3 times. That is 43%, higher than allen Iverson career fg%.
been waiting for this video since the draft lottery ended lol
Rupert is french that's funny they match up against each other in the playoffs, to my knowledge it has never happened that 2 french players face each other in the playoffs
Pov your waiting for the rooks dude to comment
today my favorite soccer team lost in the semifinals and I cried out of sadness for the first time in like 2 years. Then I saw kenny uploaded, all better now
VIDEO IDEA: Mix two NBA goats rookie versions in 2k and see if one of your creations becomes the next goat but here are the rules each creations has to be the same position for example ray Allen and Mj for SG or Wilt and Bill for center do this 3 or 2 times
VIDEO IDEA: You should take the 2k rookie versions of 3 nba legends at the same position and combine them by taking the best atrubute to the biggest guy. For example for pg you could choose Magic curry and the glove so you have magic's size and passing while having GP's defense and curry shooting.
pistons always screwed in the lottery system hating on the 313 detroit vs the world
VIDEO IDEA: Kenny remember amare love can you do another amare love but with all time greats
as a magic fan, im glad to have the 6th and 11th pick
Kenny fast wit the uploads 😂😂😂
u technically already did this lol. u live in the future fr. 💯
"He got a big chin.. big bottom half his head.." I laughed way too hard at this, not sure if you meant it to be that funny, but bravo
Here’s an idea : Try and get as many of the nba players from the famous Blake griffin dunking video and put them on a team and simulate.

As a piston fans we need a viedo about us eveything in shambles for us rn
The kings drafted Keegan Murray’s brother lol
And we back
Dang. This would’ve made a great series for your KennyToo channel. A long rebuild with Wemby would’ve been cool.
After Zion, I’m not putting expectations on anybody. I’ll believe it when I see it.
I wanted him to go to the Spurs or Hornets ( leaning towards Spurs ) so I waw happy as hell in the lottery
Challenge idea: The rainbow challenge: Do a rebuilding challenge where u do a fantasy draft, then you have a wheel of colors and u spin for 10 trades and whatever color it lands on you can only trade for a player who has worn that Icon jersey color in their career(the colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple).
Big spurs fan
Let’s go
.
Everyone talking about Vic, but blazers landing with #3 pick has made things interesting... If hornets pick Brandon Miller at #2  They may trade Dame 😉😔
Day 61 of asking Kenny to put all of his created players in the same draft class and sim until they retire to see who turns out to be the best
Kenny raised me when my parents didn’t want to
Day 434 of asking KOT4Q to do the No Free Agency Rebuilding Challenge   Rule 1: You cannot sign any players during off season free agency.  Rule 2: Once a player’s contract expires, they’re gone from the team for good.   Rule 3: You cannot sign players in free agency to acquire assets then flipping them nor can you use free agency to fill up roster space.   Rule 4: No contract extensions or trades during off season free agency.   Rule 5: Trade only during the regular season.  Rule 6: Try and win 2 or 3 championships.   This is my challenge for KOT4Q let’s see if he can complete this.
Rebuild idea get a nba youtuber to build your roster and if you don't pass you give the youtuber a jersey
Win a championship with injuries at 99.
Whenever I saw the spurs get the first pick all I could think about is Kenny making this video 😂
go back to basketball gm
Imagine if Spurs don't draft him LOL
westbrook at 76 is disrespectful to me wow
As a hornets fan i felt like crying after the lottery
Challenge: take the first 10 of the 75th top players and try to win a 3 peat, a mvp, a scoring title, dpoy, and you gotta win with 3 different finalistmvp each year and you only got 4 years to do it ….aw you can try to go 82-0 (optional)
Vic will do big things!!
Hi
Finally was waiting for this video all day😫
Kenny they have masks in mycareer this year
Best time ever for me as a spurs fan bro
Are you going to do mlb rebuilds again that was my favorite series
AND WE BACK
Does anyone know how to fix the draft lottery
Am I the only who realized the bottom right full screen😂😂
Imagine the spurs choke and chose someone elss
You guys realise that they aren't going to draft him right? Adam Silver already told me he's not going first, hes going possibly second or third
Victor the next Goat 💯🔥
The one problem with Vic in real life may be injuries hopefully he has a healthy career
Another banger from kenny
I thought wembanyama was 7 foot crazy ow he is 7"5
I’m very sad rn (pelicans fan)
Victor wembanyamba is going to dominate the nba with spurs
like if kenny should use his myleauge series sliders when he hops into games for these videos.
Day 28: The Rooks Idea: Turn every NBA player back to rookies. Do a fantasy draft and win the championship in 3 years. You could also simulate further to see what the league looks like. Good luck Kenny!
Hi Kenny! Do you know that years ago, Wemby asked you in a comment to simulate his carrier? I saw that comment. :) 2-3 years ago maybe.
All this for  The spurs to take Scoot and Lamelo get Vic 🔥
I hop the Spurs don’t take him
We love you Kenny!❤
I just know u been waitin for this one
Kenny i think you should restart Scottie pippen career
Shoutout to kot4q for this consistent content
Coach Pops back
LEGENDARY VIDEO KENNY ‼️
I’m sad that they got it I wanted the hornets to get it
Day whatever of asking Kenny to do the fix challenge. You add a legend, of your choosing, to each team. But they have to be a position that fixes that team. So for example the bulls weakest position in the starting lineup is pf, so you'd add Dennis rodman. Have fun and try to win a championship
Should’ve been a Blazer 😞. Everything happens for a reason 😢.
Day whatever of asking Kenny to do the broken bones challenge. Turn the injury frequency to 100 and everyone's durability to 0 and try to win a championship. Oh and if you want to make it harder, five minute rebuild. Can confirm, it's hard
shoutout Jarace Walker goin above Scoot and Miller
Sros beat you to the same video by 16 mins so while everybody watching that ima snag first comment
Your videos never fail to entertain bro. I gotta meet you one day theirs no reason we’re both from Chicago and I’ve never ran into you
Early squad 💯🔥
Vic has so much potential, I just hope he can stay healthy
I just watched your video that you had the spurs getting the #1 pick and draft Victor. As soon as it was over I got the ESPN notification that spurs got the #1 pick.
First

Day 3: Take every (or some) of the nba 2k covers players and see if they can go 82-0. Love the vids kenny❤❤
AND WE BACK
