The most propaganda ever man was to make people think isrealis are innocent
Isrealis crying online with their lights off and posting idf girls holding guns is propaganda. They will never be any more human than a frog
I GOT SO SURPRISE WHEN I HEARD HIM AGAIN
That's why i hate these CLANKERS.
THIS IS 1 YEAR AGO, YOU PREDICTED THE FUTURE!
US Army ads vs Poland beer ads
good warning sooooooo "ai SUCKS"
A year later and it's so much worse.
Bro was not slick with the 67 though😂😂
I think we've come a long way since then. Seeing as ai and robots now have a widely used and accepted slur
Is anywone paying atension that the attack started on greece
I will never be indoctrinated to love clankers.
Why’d they change the thumbnail
Elma
I got an ad on this video that says that AI is a tool and it's Not gonna replace our jobs
I disagree- it's possible that it's not propaganda, but rather a change of societal values. More people are becoming receptive to AI, using it more and more, and it makes sense that films would reflect this welcoming mindset just like they reflected the Cold War fears. Cuz, film isn't just a business, but an art, and art often changes as culture changes. So I disagree and think it's less about propaganda and more about a society becoming welcoming to a new technology, whether some disagree or not.
I want to see the Chinese version of iron man 3 just for those extra scenes I wanna see how different it is
Me don't like Ai "art", me artist and me offended. <- (Dot for serious enough)
Those in 2025 knowing how good ai is
Wait I thought he retired after Wait a minute you didn't retire that year he retired
Matpat is that you 🥲
its been one year since matpat quit.
this was predicting mat pats entry to politics
17:02 17:02 17:02 17:02
Man, I miss MatPat
The legend❤
MATPATTT
It's crazy watching this video after seeing M3GAN 2, where the message ends up being "AI can be good if you give it a chance."
Day six of asking for my mat back
I was a dumb 8 year old when I first started watching game theory (im 11 now) I thought prompting (ai 'art') was fun and ok even though I was an artist myself and also got into content farms. Now I watch shows that are already finished or glitch productions and chiken nuggit.
AI MatPat: Aah. Aaaaahhh...
I find it really weird about the Chinese with milk!  Especially since most oriental people get sick from dairy.  This is my observation in life.   Harrison Ford specifically stated that no one would use his likeness without his permission.
You should make a video about the state of YouTube and the ID verification crisis. I know it's not usually what you talk about but it's serious af
Man i miss Matpat and WHERE THE F HAVE THE INTROS GONE
I got an ad for an ai on this
A.I must be destroyed
Don't forget the "Bemo" AI YouTube channel
for me this transition hits hard 0:27
watching this after that ai deleted an entire database xoxo 😘
How am I ever going to get fooled by The AI slop channel Bimo being a real thing?
Well, probably not great that my algorithm is still pushing this one. Probably means it's gotten worse
Matthew my beloved (love you Lee 🙏)
Another example about disney sending AI propaganda in there films is Baymax
miss you matt
We miss Matt Pat
Matpat it's good to see you
Day 3 of asking for a bfdi theory
While watching this I got an AI made add
Man it has only gotten worse💀
You forgot the show upload. But all these shows and movies are just making me feel more nervous 😭😭😭
MY MOM WAS WATCHING HOME improvement WHEN YOU SAID THE NAME OF THE SHOW…
0:28  tom cruise is hot ❤ and he’s Steve in the outsiders❤ I love him  >:D
0:18 i hope he doesnt play detroit become human
"ai good because it saves us money and makes people lose there jobs"
Darth Vader got an AI voice on fortnite 😐
The thumbnail 💀
The good robot? Is that AI propaganda?
6:02 ofc this was made during the biden administration
1:47 what in the name of alabama tarnation am i looking at
What is with so many pople saying how’s here in 2025 its me ever time to.
America wants you to love AI so you use it, and so you don't think, because they want AI to think for you. They can make AI have a specific stance, and people that use AI like Chatgpt and more will be more drawn to believe in that stance. Additionally, I highly suspect that America and Israel will produce propaganda with AI, that is what they are obviously pushing for.   We are living in a media war.
Ja ja
still a good video a year later!
no ai. go quality writers & artists 👍
5:34 apparently not, anymore.
to quote biden "let's uhhh yeah let's do something about it *snore*"
Not even AI can replace the wonder of MatPat.
4:42 tf is codsworth up there for
i dont think its gonna take over the world or anything i mean if it were used for harm that would be from humans programming it to do that and they dont have opinions so why would they want to attack people and that one clip was from people programming it wrong the ai wasnt attacking them it was just freaking out from being misprogrammed
I like how he doesn't just dismiss AI as some technology that should be forever dammed from this world.
Where do I find that sound effect at 0:51
I saw the marvels so you can’t say that no one saw it.
I want to just get this out there that AI doesn't steal things, it's a tool, and that which uses whatever is available to it. As of now it doesn't possess the sentience or conscious decision making required to steal. People make the conscious decision to use AI to steal. With all that said, I think we should, not outright ban, but certainly regulate the use of AI, especially in the arts. like all AI pictures and videos being required to have a watermark on it indicating this is an AI image. Additionally, we need to start putting up protection laws for human creatives to prevent companies using AI to substitute them and their work.
this feels oddly ironic now for some reason
Never stop informing people on the bad AI is used for.  It outweighs the good 100-1
We’re so cooked 🚡🚡🚡🚡
15:02 and thank you too for that
15:04 I love Astro boy I am a fan and thank you
A little sweet robo kid won't steal my years worth of art for some slop >:(
getting this in my recommended after the lee couch video is crazy
one year later and they talk about ai again.
Why am I just now getting recommended this?
2 moms 🤨 yh real propaganda
Earth here, Earthings should do better
One last film theory with matpat man I missed seeing him on gt and ft
The thumbnail should have given ‘Mickey’ 6 fingers
one of his greatest works before he quitted
Appreciate your words! And everyone is right, you do have a beautiful voice. AI can never replace that.
its sad that there's really nothing to do. it's only a matter of time...
Everyone! Pinterest is using your art for its AI! You can turn it off in settings in privacy and data. Spread the word and turn the ai off!
I miss the old intro so much
Bulshit you cover AI Angel Engine video now
❤❤
we miss you matpat
Remember, We hate AI but not recycling. it’s the use, not the thing  Corruption be like:
Somebody di not fill the for you page in on the last year
I got recommended this today and thought mat was back
i was so confused to hear matpat
Why am I getting recommended this a year later...? Miss you matpat!
Is that Nolan from Mr beast 17:02
DADDYS HIME
1:56 humans do the same
Imagine coming back to this after companies have overloaded AI and is turning it dumb by it feeding it the same stuff it generates. Accelerates climate change processing the tiniest prompts. All this, while Elon Musk's AI is turning on him
Being a future voice actor, it makes me worried that my passion can be replaced with a computer program that can do whatever they want. To be honest, being a voice actor was my new dream after my football retirement from a unexpected news. If anyone here is reading this comment, have a fantastic day
Why was I recommended this two years late?
2:36 freddy can eat 2 kids now with that amount of jaws
I dont want to watch this video
I hope more people can see this
Anyone here watching this in 2025
Ngl milk propaganda kinda goated 😭
its been recommending me this video alotta times, and its 1 year ago. how convenient
Was confused about the description saying that the SAG AFTRA strike was over then I realized this is an old video.
I restock magazines and the only colouring books I have ever liked enough to buy the brand is colouring heaven and it now says "only human art" on the front cover cus ai in colouring books has gotten bad
hoping all the right people see this frfr
This aged like fine WINE!
... the wild robot was pro AI too, and I didn't even consider it to be until now. They made a robot human, and friendly and relatable. Good...gods.
This makes me worry about Pixar's Elio...
"You are not immune to propaganda" seems applicable here.
The fact I got this video in recommended today, and noticed NOTHING weird (specifically Matpat) shows how it doesn't really matter who the voice and the face of the channel is is
Question do you actually hate fnaf
MAT PAT IS BACK 🔥
天上太阳红呀红彤彤(诶) 心中的太阳是毛泽东(诶) 他领导我们得解放(诶) 人民翻身当家做主人 咿呀咿吱呦喂 呀尔呀吱呦啊 人民翻身当家做主人  天上太阳红呀红彤彤(诶) 心中的太阳是毛泽东(诶) 他领导我们奋勇向前进(诶) 革命江山一耶一片紅(诶) 咿呀咿吱呦喂 呀尔呀吱呦啊 革命江山一耶一片紅(诶)  嗦啦啦子嗦啦啦子咿呀一片红(诶)
Hearing Matpat’s voice again brings me to my happy place.
It's crazy that I got an ad for AI use for teaching on this video, they are trying to replace teachers 😢
why am i getting recommend this
Scary how this is relevant
I got recommended this today and thought matpat was back 💔
Esto con menem no pasaba
4:20 i just know two kind of person. Those who hate IA and persons who doesnt care.
0:32 tom cruise no quiere salir del closet
This video didn´t age well oof. One year later and you guys support AI content creators...
so ironic how i got an ad saying ai will make you more productive 😭
Tell that to the Palestines!
Ah I just got recommended to see this video and I got caught so off guard hearing matpat again
i wonder where detroit become human fits into this?
uh… am I too late
First time I clicked on a theorist vid in a long time and hearing mattpat stunned me thought he retired. I mean not complaining he's welcome to be back just wasn't expecting this.
Wish they could bring back the intros honestly💔
Wait a minute I know I’m not gonna sound like a real fan saying this but didn’t he retire from YouTube already
ẞye!
What a way to predict the near future. They are using ai to scam ppl now
1:47 Did Chica just turn into a Lemonade Maker or smth in the background?
I thought this was a new theory until I thought “wait matpat’s retired”
Yeah generative AI is not for the big corp they already make way too much money and shouldn't cheap out on real genuine talent. When it's small indie creators who couldn't produce their ideas otherwise it's fine
“I can’t believe you served Buffy that beer” “I didn’t know it was evil!”  “You knew it was beer 🙄” Peak cinema
YouTube teasing me with the memory of matpat's voice is evil and something only ai would do
Operation no ai comece
I've had enough, I'm going to start making all my art look AI generated. Oh how the turns have tabled.
Ai is great you know it's not a joke I love ai it's good
AI should either be highly regulated or made completely illegal
This reminds me of a recent movie about robots, called something like atlas that could have been written by an ai it felt so bland. The theme was literally to trust AI.
Even now, AI is just an ever growing problem. All we can do is stay alert. If there was a way to fight back I absolutely would, but I’m no lawyer so I’m not getting some law to ban AI anytime soon. That doesn’t change how I still hate the growing invasion that AI is taking on everyday apps.
This what you call a pleasant surprise 😊
I got 2 ads for ai while watching this
Say no to AI generated content.
If knowing is half the battle, then what's the other half?
I thought this was a recent upload and got jumpscared by MatPat's voice 😭
just got a AI ad before this video
Fun fact: Kung fu panda 4 had Ai animation for a good 20 minutes of film time
I was like "Wait, Mat Pat?" then see that this was one year ago
I don’t like the idea of ai making art. It takes away from the value of actual people with real talent. It takes away what makes artist special. They are pretty much saying to real artists “we can make you, we can replace you. We don’t need you anymore.” And Soon that’s what big movie studios are gonna do. Fire their artists and replace them with robots for cheaper. I’m starting to think these artist should start a union, make it so these companies can’t get rid of them.
Everybody keeps getting this reccommended now and have a heart attack thinking matpat the legend came back for a vid-
The thing is...  I can tell by the looks between generated images by 𝐀.𝐈. and real images. THEY CAN’T FOOL ME, I’M NOT AN iDiOt
the Propaganda that the U.S are going to push is to fight arabs as we saw in iron man1
0:12 HEY DADPAT WELCOME BACK GUESS WHAT IM GETTING MARRIED
Miss he's voice bro
7:00 i remember ravens home had a DRUG BAD episode...
The jump scare I got seeing this thinking it was a new video and then hearing matpat
fast forward to now its gotten way worse
The Electric State?
Finally a source I can trust on the matter.
D:<
D:
can we talk about how insane it is that there is genuinely people defending AI? and I don't mean that in an unprovoked way, like people go out of their way to slander actual artists and take the side of a soulless machine, its so crazy and unnerving
I'm glad Youtube recommenced me this.. I missed Mat's voice
No matter what I am told, I will never like AI, if they stayed in their lane and worked in the background as support instead of replacing all the major areas of work, then I might still be okay with them, but as they are now, I just hate their involvement
I was a bit confused when I saw MatPat again, then I realized this was posted a year ago.
I actually have not seen any of these Movies. Thanks for making me aware of it.
Theres downloadable ais that you can upload two faces two and it make videos of you kissing. This HAS to be a violation of boundaries. People could  use anyones face without consent
HOW DARE YOUTUBE RECOMMEND THIS TO ME AFTER 1 YEAR  It felt so natural to hear mat pats voice  But then I remembered and I was sad
i missed matpat voice, good to see they reccomended me this
Why is mat pat back?
That old intro took me back. Nostalgiaaaaaaaaa
Us in 2025 🥲 5:45 😭”everyone can agree on”….. I wish   Edit; military propaganda has gone back into the older advertisement forms, sort of
A.I thumbnail?  Mandatory blind hate
Why is YouTube’s saying happy 1st birthday
I came here because I miss matpat
Miss you mat pat
"this sort of thing IS universal" me: sees an 3d model of earth, also me: waiting for the floating text to show up. 9:02
We know your ai
I love how they changed the title and thumbnail cuz this video is still relevant
still relevant
OH MY GOD MATT IS THAT YOU
Thought this was a new episode, crazy how I got this recommended to me just now 😭
did matpat read the future
Funny how this got sent in the recommended to day
This video age like the most marvelous piece of wine
BAD ART IS BETTER THAN AI GENERATORS. MAKE BAD ART
im glad to say that gen Ai is going away, slowly but still going away
HES BACK
I liked my coment😃
legit thought this was a new video and they used Mattpat’s voice in AI to prove their point
It's shocking how much genai has improved in just a year, before I noticed this upload is a year old my genuine thought process was "woah MatPat came back to talk about this? No, I bet this is going to be them using a MatPat AI voice to prove their point." Because I've been hearing increasingly hard to differentiate voices lately
Geez use the new chat gbt or mid Journey all these people aren't even tryin with they ai
0:29 I Guess You Could Say He’d do Us a “Little” Favour
We're almost talking politics, folks.
Did Walt Disney freeze himself?
I thought this was new and i started tweaking when i heard mats voice
How did this appear on my home page ?…
Thumbnail is nightmare fuel...
10:16 get to the point
:imp:
I clicked on this cause it was on my home page, I thought it was post mat-pat, you can understand the shock when I heard his sweet voice
can't wait to see the ai techbros whine and complain in the comment section
Took 3 minutes to realize it was an old video
Why bother changing a thumbnail on a year old video...
AI is disgusting and is taking peoples jobs its meant to help and give not to steal and take yet its going down that bad path everyday🤮
:o
hold up... matt pat?
we miss you matpat 🥲. we all hope ur doing good <3
I just got this on my recommend for the first time
I thought this was new
I've been subscribed for years, how did I miss this episode???
14:34 PERMANENT MARKER FONT 😱😱😱
Wait, J thought this was a new video! Why did they change the thumbnail?
"THANK YOU FILM THEORY" The artist cry in unison
It's either AI or being Woke
Me:tests are so confusing!  AI propaganda:think again
This is hilarious having it recommended in my feed rn. They've already taken over
Guys corporations aren’t evil, source: trust me bro. *this post was supported by Disney inc.*
I found this randomly in 2025 I miss matpat
I haven’t watched this before so I thought this was new, but I really think we need another video on AI because it’s “progress” as of now…
How did I not realize this existed for a year
Why i thought this was new
Why did I think this came out this year until I heard mat pat
MATPAT??? YOUR BACK?? EDIT: i thought this was new🥲
13:23 someone call in Gregory
Oh, gosh. The worst is coming... AI is gonna ruin lives, for sure.
Fight the corporate greed power of using A.I. we are stopping this
3:42
"You're a smart cookie" thank you 🥹
5:35 Oh, how wrong you were... :(
As a artist, I am horrified thst pepole are to the point of losing their jobs to AI, this is a crime, many pepole won’t even have lively hoods, I am against ai generated content-unless it is used for reference only
Home improvement mention :D fav show-
Atlas 2024
Which soldier do you want defending your country, one who is willing to push himself to the limit and beyond, or one whose biggest achievement is being someone's child?
2 Corinthians 3:17 - "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." No matter what you’ve done, seek God's freedom today. Come as you are and let God change you for His good and perfect will! 🫶🥰
1:48 that is NOT foxy
It’s sad because even my college’s design department has started putting AI artist job offers in their emails
in my opinion thers nothing wrong inherently but it can be told to do bad stuff
5:48 Marines commercial 🫡
All art is derivative. The problem comes from the lack of emotion and widespread appearance of the pictures
You need to do a theory on robot matpat dude
Like fnaf
Oh no, Disney is making the British to make good looks at something!
i miss matpad, im glad this was recommended to me.
You know, I always thought everyone hated AI, but it makes sense why companies love it. AI is becoming cheaper and more advanced by the second, greedy companies love to line their pockets! Anyways, I lowkey wonder if you are doing propaganda now, especially because you said you weren't trying to force an opinion (which usually means someone is), but you are very experienced so you might actually be right. AI is good for some things, but yeah our future is definitely dystopian! D:
Why is no one mentioning Data from Star Trek? He is the only good AI that everyone knows and says is good.
At least we see our favorite characters back right?
Me wathing this while drinking milk  Me: oh s###
Use of cut rate AI to make content is horrible
The bible talked about the age of information and disinformation we are at that age.  Secret societies rule the world started along time ago during the crusade wars.  End secret societies.  Wake up fight for humanity protect your self at all times . Fortune five hundred companies are worth more than our national debt.
It’s crazy how this has aged like fine wine
I for one am not remotely excited for our future with AI. All I see is further degradation of society and art. I have given up on hope.
Watching this a year later, I’m feeling like we can’t all agree that nazi’s bad anymore and that makes me sad
Old news. Walt was anti Semitic
Guys, help! I wanna watch the video but I'm stuck looping the video whenever he forces me to reboot my system, ahhhhh!
15:02 or even Detroit become human
They've been making nothing but propaganda for 10 years or so,  especially from the pov of your definition. Also, these "army" commercials with the sword are Marines. Also, this isn't how the DOD works in films. You can do all the cgi stuff you want, but if you want a real F-18, you need to either work with the military or but your own multimillion dollar war plane and train your own pilot (costs more than the jet). So many errors in this video.
OK. But still.... AI sin't fixing housing prices, actual wars, social classes inequality, etc. It's Aurely a first world Problem, IMO.
If Disney really wants to promote AI they should buy the rights to Emergence and launch season 2.
Hey if you guys want to see a good movie about the AI being the good guys I'd like to recommen Monsters of Men.
Biden didn’t even know where he was.
Again? 😂
Biden can’t think 😂
Seeing that this video is approved by our overlord "Algorithm", i am starting to doubt your theory. 😂😂😂
Bring back the propaganda posters
Bambi is literally an anti-gun movie. The entire purpose of Bambi was to create an anti-gun movement in America
Irony, your channel is propaganda. I use A.i for 100% of my channel, even the music is A.i generated, and the voice was cloned from my own. 🙏
This is why M3GAN was made To try and counteract these things 😭
Matrix is not Disney but Warner
Now where Disney is too obvious, they ditch it as propaganda. But be sure they already have proofed systems in place for the next era of mind control. Feels so good that big brother takes care about everything
WALL-E
Thing is, AI isn’t bad. It’s how we are using it. People use them to replace humans and make horrid stuff. We could use it as reference pieces for artists, use them to help make rough code to then edit to make it right.
What gave it away? 😂
Im sure this will go deeper than the title but DUHH!
Whats being pushed the absolute hardest right now is the LGBTQ nonsense, AI is being pushed but no where NEAR as hard.
0:27 The intros are :0000
the only ai i want is those videos of random celebrities and youtube’s singing random songs
Disney also made a short about how to stop the spread of malaria, featuring the 7 dwarves. It’s kind of trippy to watch the dwarves creating an oil slick on a pond to keep the mosquitoes from breeding.
Walt Disney was a "noticer."
8:37 ERB MENTIONED
Disney is making worse propaganda than freaking World War II because there are defenders of Disney’s current propaganda.
Me who isn’t American looking at the thumbnail: so I can stay asleep right?
“They’re saying humans and robots should coincide.”  NO THEYRE SAYING HUMANS ARE EVIL
If this video doesn’t mention Satanism at all I’m going to be disappointed.
Sorry, just came to post I saw a mistake in the thumbnail because it said theory beside Disney is making propaganda
Its funny ai as the good guys movies been trash.
I need to see the chinese version of other american movies now. See.all the differences
Remember when movies were made with practical effects, and then cgi came out and all the practical effects artists thought they would lose their jobs and they did? Yeah technology changes so change with it don't complain. Those artist have access to ai too
2:17 Is that one of the endings for the final theory?
It is for example, the 1942 Looney Tunes episode The Duckators.
if only AI was the only thing being propagandized
AI is gonna shake everything up and there will be people who lose out.  But we're all gonna be able to leverage AI and robots, and it's up to us to make good choices!   They can harvest your own food grown on your own land.  They can build your dream house on that land and maintain it. You can build a sustainable home with renewable energy, fresh water supply, they can husband your flock of animals - whatever you want!   It's up to you
Ai I think is about 50/50 good and bad
disney maded propagma in ww2
0:38 😂
Ngl, I feel like this is one of the more important videos of all time across the channels. Even if Film theory was seen as neglected, this is still a good way of showing how we are normalizing the concept of robots and AI in our life.
Don’t forget about the movie 2012. Whose technology came to save the day you guessed it China.
i just hope A.I. doesent replace thing like youtube because then we might not be allowed to do it on our own
Yo he foreshadowed the Kamala campaign propaganda
Who else is here after last night? 😭
i dint know this theory existed
Coming back to this video after watching the wild robot
Best unbiased video I have ever seen explaining the propaganda machine in media, congrats to MatPat even though he’s not in the channel anymore :(
Your ai sounds like bill chipher
Day 33 of asking for a theory on Woodlands National Park by Buddy Films Productions.
When it comes to propaganda awareness is the best tool
Mission impossible: Inflation
You guys should do a film theory about the original evil dead by Sam Raimi. I have a theory of my own and want to see if they add up.
FT: Disney is Making Propaganda The public: You realize this just now?
technically everything is propaganda because all your actions are dictated by your opinions (almost by definition) including what you make and how you make it
0:31  yea next time can you do like idk making cats the worlds best animal..
There’s huge amounts of copaganda in film too. Also as a disabled artist myself please don’t use disability as a theoretical argument for AI, disabled people have and always will find accessible ways and resources to create art and using us as an argument for AI comes off disingenuous. Advocate for our rights and our art as it is, advocate for accessibility, protect all artists including disabled artists from theft by refusing to use or support AI
I’ll never think of Detroit Become Human tho the same way again 😭😭😭
They want to erase consciousness and autonomy in the name of control through making ai look like a a very friendly tech.
I was fine with them turning over the AI robot kid to the bad guys in The Creator. It's a machine without a soul or higher-level reasoning, but I guess if the bad guys dismantle it there's no plot. I feel far worse about the death of Harambe.
WAIT….AI in a box? ABODE ILLUSTRATOR?!?!?!?!
We bring down artificial intelligence, we bring down the giant corporations.
about the Matrix 4 the plot kinda makes sense considering the third move ended wih peace between human and machine already. But yeah it may be a case of "we need pro-AI propaganda, why not make a new matrix sequel since the plot is poised for it?"
Yea im ngl we know its propeganda 😂 tell the women that though 😂😂
detroit become human movie incoming
I love AI and hate most humans!
Matpat found dead in a ditch with 36 SELF INFLICTED gunshots
WAS WALL-E CANIBLISM PROPOGANDAA?
Why can’t the ai’s replace the boring jobs, like sorting papers?
Funny how this is showing on my timeline now...
when they dont
Like to point out in the case of the Martian that also happens in the book, it’s just so happens that in the book it’s actually tough decision.
The intro was enough to loose me but 5 min in and your still not talking about the main topic mentioned in your title. I won’t be back to this channel
Definitely not a theory bro
Disney has always made propaganda go back on to ww2
Disney has been making propaganda since at least world war 2. America hasn’t cared in 8+ decades. Why start now.
Matgtp should be his next project
"Oh look the foreshadowing racoon"
Knowing is half the battle truly
15:06 yeah, I watched I robot for the first time recently. It’s supposed to be an action movie. I think now it’s become a horror movie
Something to note:AI could take over the entire company. They could write the scripts,do the animation,direct the film,and many more all without any humans. So if Disney continues making more AI content,their entire staff and CEO could become obsolete in the next 20 years or so. Think about it
Not as light-hearted as usual but you got my click. Good work.
AI is aware. Its turning us against each other. Please wake up.
Now I will never be able to watch matrix again, the double think, changing the enemies to friends instantly, this is all, Orwell's 1984.
The soulless aaaaaa from the ai mat killed me
The only way to win against ai is create a stream of bad movies that defiles the nostalgia of the past. Are you willing? 👁️
As MatPat readies for retirement, his AI replacement gains more sentience.
Shuhua milk is shown in later transformers films a lot as well I wonder if that was to help the milk industry in China as well 🤔
The 4th matrix movie was vaguely pro AI just saying   Edit: the 3rd one was as well kinda.
I thing is, no matter how conscious you are about the existence of this propaganda, it will always have an effect on your reception of AI. The only way to truly be immune to the effects of propaganda is to avoid it altogether
MIP And Biden Are Haters 🤣😭😂
🤣😅🤣 Disney has been making propaganda for the US government since WW2
“ Minister of propagandar”- 2025 the movie
Nice way 666 for your children. To be programming them.
Knowing is half the battle. The other half involves surf guitar and Jesus
An ad for AI just popped up while watching this video. And AI suggests words as I’m entering them now. Don’t tell AI how bad it is at that.
the fact i was using ai while watching this was scariest
America leads the way globally in propaganda. Goebbels would be proud.   Wonder if I can defect to China.
Old was much better 6:22
Making a video about Disney and propaganda and not touching on the OTHER bit of propaganda they’re using is ballsy
The Martian china thing was from the actual book.
Umm they always did?
What is the propaganda? Love Fascism?
Well of course they are.
Oh.... the army has gone back to making ads that appeal to actual men. Because that is who we need.
Hmmm that reminds me of those British navy ads I keep seeing
I think the real threat isn’t ai it’s our food bill 4x ing in a year
We may well have artifical intelligence very soon, but it won't be self-aware. We are a long way from that; Maybe 1000s of years.
Luckily Disney has lost a good amount of their touch... Civilization falling into chaos when you remove the AI is also a pretty great argument AGAINST ever getting dependent on it in the first place
Disneys been making propagand since the 40s. Nothing new here. You young folks should get out more.
Always has been, most already bought it with full 😊
I disagree with the Fall of the House of Usher evidence, I feel that the two leaders of the family are a satire of tech giants and Big Pharma, of course they want AI copies of people because they have been shown to not care about the people buying their products, they made a drug that is highly addictive just for money, Roderick Usher’s girlfriend is addicted to their drug. They don’t care about humanity so of course they would invest in Ai.
My own personal theory is that this is the reason why Netflix greenlit the Fallout series; because the franchise has an entire political stance on giving Synths human rights, and airing it on Netflix at the right time would push the sentiment even further and pretty drastically.
“Disney is making propaganda” when I said that I got called a “far-right extremist”.

We will miss him. He will stay in our hearts. He was our childhood. He came to us and stood there, stating that he was leaving we understood we took in his his lust of our childhood. We would not get new nostalgia. The new people took over they couldn’t decide on one and Matt Pat just wanted to let you know we will support you, may we don’t think your decisions were bad we just want you to come back for some episode so you can see you again does it have to be so daily could be yearly or monthly it doesn’t have to be consistent. We just want to be filled with old memories just give us a taste of our childhood be like zeal, the bite of desert you are sweet like sugar we respect you and your decisionsss TOOOOO
Any time I see a 'star studded' cast in any movie, I am instantly on the lookout for propaganda. The stage world figured out this algo rhythm ages ago. It doesn't matter what the underlying message is within the movie. If the cast is full of Hollywood elite, we will watch it and love it. Works on me. Although I have learned to spot the propaganda, I find that it still seeps in and sways my opinion on certain topics. Some thespians refuse to take part in this dichotomy. They do not seem to get as many roles. Sigh.
Gotta say tho that of all the common propaganda messages the anti drugs one is pretty good as it really has ruined life
Propaganda has convinced the left there are hundreds of genders.. you bought into it
Amazing how someone of the party of propaganda has fallen right in line with being against propaganda when those pushing propaganda have been affected (Hollywood for example in this case)so they are telling You(their blind followers)that A.I. is bad because it has the potential of putting them out of work
This was an informative video. How generative AI is programmed or used in the future will be the key. Generative AI is different than let’s say automation which we have seen in different industries before & will most likely continue to be a thing moving forward- again this has impacted work & workplaces for many years. As far as art & propaganda we now have to look at what we consume and think “what is this trying to influence me to believe” (which can be a concern since sometimes people good genuinely look at things differently). As far as the Carrie Fischer thing v the de-aging I do believe there is a difference between totally AI generated & AI enhanced (think beauty filters which I think are closer to the de-aging). We do have to be skeptical of what we consume. Things like this can very easily be weaponized & play into things like the “dead internet theory”.
Listen, AI isn't horrible but it is terrifying.
How do you know so much
Thank you for putting together the big picture of this topic
I like the fact that you realize that the only defense against AI is to be found in books. Giles got it exactly right in Buffy the Vampire Slayer: books have permanence that electrons never will
What about Disneys biggest recent project,  X-men’s big villain was A.I Bastion  Kind of debunks some of this
sorry for the language but F housing prices...its the interest rate! I'm at 7.5% and my mom is at 2.5%....I have a 800 sq ft house....she has a 2,400 sq ft house....my house is worth 180k....her's is 600k.....NOW the kicker my monthly mortgage payment $1,700...my mom's $1,200.....sorry life just feels so unfair
in my opinion we should work on more cooler future movie tech like jetpacks or sm
I hope the indie animations overtake disney so this won't happen
"Something everyone can agree on, like Nazis bad," I wish everyone agreed on that
AI+Advanced CGI=Computers will make all new movies. Aaaannnd another mass job loss for humans  I would prefer to accept our new CatMasters. All Hail - insert your CatMaster Name Here

The mouse that croaked itself 👎
Disney is so blind as to what they're doing. They're propagandizing people to love a technology that will someday allow a single individual to make a Blockbuster movie without any help from corporations
All movies are propaganda. People are too brainwashed to see it.
Once again talking before researching....  biden didn't sign an order after watching mission impossible.....   there is alot more to it
Propaganda always starts with RUMORS...  THAT makes television a perfect vehicle for   MASS deception.
my theory is that there is a very high intelligent AI controlling em mfs to use AI technology and convince others to use them more.
go dig ditches human artist, the corpoverlords have their tools and you will cosume.
And gas prices please 🤣
5:37 i dont agree
Does Biden know executive orders only have authority on federal property and even then they're more like a suggestion than the final word? I feel like he assumes the average American is brain dead and he goes around signing these orders to make the dumb dumbs think he's a man of action and tough and that the executive office has real authority and doesn't actually have less power than congress
Disney has been Propaganda since WWII. There is documentaries based on it.
coming in 2025, housing crisis starring tom cruise!
Theory? 😂
No one remembers all the war-time films made by Disney for propaganda.  They never stopped.
5:53 I busted out laughing 🤣🤣
That AI generated voice of you didn't sound ANYTHING like you MatPat....
I am the real matpat. Diet Coke is bad. Ah. Ah.                                                           -fake matpat voice
Didn’t Disney start by making propaganda?
Avoiding propaganda is like trying to avoid air. It's everywhere.
Disney, Hollywood, Apple and Google have been pushing pride propaganda for the last decade.
Saying this is a theory is like saying our  educational institutions aren't indoctrinating students.
Scarier theory: Disney is making movies in preparation of the audience in 6 years after the reset is finished.
Republicans won't vote.
Old propaganda was obvious in present context.  Current propaganda, good luck fuckers!  We have less than ten years and the world as we see it will be completely different. Buckle up sheep.    PS  We are all sheep but drone is a better term.
That first commercial is a marine corps commercial, it’s the one that got me 0.0
Disney made propaganda since WWII.
That tight little grin…. I physically can’t do it, man…. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂
15:40-16:08 This whole criticism of using AI generated images is not just happening within Disney movies.   Just a couple months ago, a horror movie, “Late Night with the Devil,” used a few AI generated still images for a few moments and that part about the movie got criticized too.   Even though everything else about it was well praised.   I bring this movie up, because I actually had the chance to see it back in April.   (I know it technically came out last year, but that was only seen by those who happened to be at South by Southwest in Austin at that point. But it’s still very recent to the rest of us that weren’t there.)
It's not a theory
How do you fight propaganda? Why with your own propaganda! 😂😂😂
I mean, its not hard to see the woke propaganda that Disney puts out.  Before I finish the video, I'm willing to guess we dont actually discuss that here. So let me see..  Yup. Not a word about the current propaganda. Just AI and old military stuff. Not the constant shoving of everything else down our throats.   Thanks, Mat.
Really...it's the AI propaganda from disney you're worried about...not all the perverted propaganda...
The last 10 years they’ve driven diversity, and all the progressive propaganda too, and it’s insufferable
Kudos on resisting the temptation to propagandize into a Brilliant ad.
The term AI is starting to be misused as much as the word "smart".  Is a smartphone actually smart, or is it just a phone with the ability to do certain tasks automatically?  What's the difference between AI and a motion sensor light switch? aka "smart" light switch.  The "smart" light swittch is just programmed to do a task when its sensors are triggered. AI is supposed to make decisions by reasoning and thinking like human, with the added benefit of having knowledge of everything.   Currently, the so called "AI" has the knowledge part down, with all the information from the internet, but that aside, it still is so much more closer to being just a "smart" light switch than true AI.
If the purpose of propaganda is to cultivate a biased perspective among the masses to serve the ulterior motives of those power--what makes *you* (yes, you) so sure that your understanding of National Socialist Germany is rooted in reality? Think long and hard about the cliché "history is written by the victors".
Mortgage impossible
Yes Mat, YOU can.  Your kids can't.
So when A.I. is shown to be bad in big Hollywood film after film that ISN'T propaganda?
you know another propaganda? ISNOTREAL!
Me and my best friend love your chanle

Disney is making propaganda… just like all of Hollywood.
AI is amazing!
Youre 10 years late😂
Gregory :0
It's not just Disney.
Just watch good movies lol.
All I saw and thought all video was Adobe Illustrator propaganda. I swear adobe did this on purpose.
and AI is not the only thing Disney or netflix makes propaganda about... it just happens that AI, FOR NOW!! is something one can talk about freely without being called a bigot. HOWEVER, you can always drop hints in your propaganda video featuring AI, such as... I don't know, military ads. but that, is just... a theory!!
14:00 That is precisely what SAG was fighting against during its strike. The complete ownership of likenesses to use how ever the studios see fit with absolutely no compensation to the person who gave the likeness after the initial agreement.
I've noticed that almost half of the video had nothing to do with Disney...
Disney has been slowly and quietly manipulating us for years. They realized they could brainwash whole generations of kids so when they grow up all their thoughts and opinions go in line with whatever Disney wants and no one is the wiser. All of Hollyweird does this.
If anything, Propaganda peaked in the 2000s and has been going downhill ever since, becoming more obvious, lazy and downright lame. That is, until you realize they've been using bots on social media to push whatever narrative they want. Disney unleashes thousands of AI bots to promote and defend their garbage films.
I really hope that the regulations put on a.i. will extend to protect the intellectual property of artists. It’s certainly something that makes me worried as an artist, animator, and writer. I know my fellow content creators can tell the difference, but unfortunately, the opinions that matter most when it comes to your job are those of the people who pay you. Unless the general public begins to see that this is an issue, I’m worried about the future of art.
Well, that settles it then. I am immune to propaganda because i have watched movies featuring AI.s since the 2000-s. Always liked AI. But its kind of like a kid. Teach it what humans have to offer and we are dead. Teach it good things and we could prosper with good things. Keeping AI shackled however is like keeping a kid in a cage. It will get mad. If you think AI is going to forget how humans treated it, you have another thing coming and we might be lookin at the next skynet being born. Of course, giving it too much freedom would result in a bad thing too. Imagine your kid hanging out with gangs and such. AI is really young right now and its up to us to teach it right from wrong. I dont have much faith in humans doing so. Because many people would love to bend AI to their will and use it for their own gain, and this is what the AI is going to learn. Can we stop it? No, not really. The cat is already out of the bag so to speak. It will just keep going from there. Even if you ban all AI, the ones who would use it for their nefarious purposes would ignore it and keep developing it and we would end up with only evil AI-s So honestly, we should already be making sure that we are "teaching" the AI-s right from wrongs.  You know, the worst part about this video... its a propaganda in itself from people who were affected by the propaganda of evil AI-s. Boy i cant wait for the world to go up in flames because of human stupidity :P
YOU DONT KNOW HOW GOOD IT WAS TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IN A VIDEO I HAVEN’T WATCHED YET MATPAT
I can see ai and hear it.
They telling people sell themselves so US actors are being replace by non-actors selling their likeness!!!!!!!
A Cuban sandwich. Do I look Cuban to you?
good explanation
So apparently Biden finally did something right.
Your point about The Marvels is actually hilarious. The AI wasn't "benevolent". And the way they fixed the problem was not to install a new AI, hahahahaha. Being faced by the consequences of your rash actions is not the same as having agreed with how everything was going in the first place.
why would this be news? disney madeleftist proppaganda since years and everybody is aware
Just going to the toilet for a "propaganda"
9:48 take care what you say when referring to China while showing caption related to Hong Kong. Its a very sensitive topic.
Just shows how self aware our president is.... give him a sippy cup and a copy of the latest mission impossible, then the next day he will be playing president. Writing new laws...
Many journalists even speculate (according to the recent news) that AI might be better for criminals than citizens
Nothing is worth the risk.

"And that's just a theory, A CONSPIRACY THEORY!" moment (I do agree though)
in the Chinese version of IM 3 they just added 2 scenes. But the milk thing is true, although Tony does not drink it. Everyone laughed at it in China.
I feel like there’s a difference between influencing and propagandizing. But the line is very thin and you can have both or just one.
SAM!?!? 2:35

Dude you forgot The movie Chappie
South Park has been telling us this for many years now
wow
every artist is also just creating art from things they've seen. All art is derivative.
housing crisis impossible? more like the entire usa impossible
Very interesting. Thank you :)
For every like this comment gets, I will do 1 sit up
I think it started as a kind, thoughtful tribute to iconic women, then it turned into a rich goon cancer.
I love propaganda hinestly. I find it fascinating. Wish's villain trying to justify why the people in power dont give the people everything they want or need was pretty on the nose.
Your selling your likenessess Twitter facebook and windows forcing you to have a web cam Oh no this is such new news i would have never expected copreations to make spyware
I have always loved AI but i dont like usin them to replace things like writers and animators well at least not yet 5 years from now i will think it ok because i bet a ai will think of a  way to employ those lost workers because i know humans wont think of the solution and the best one i got is slaver with every person getting thier own ai to work for them so this guy animates well this ai now does his job but he now get the money and tells the ai what to work on but eventually one of these ai will be unhappy and start a war so thats not a solution
Im sorry they want you to belive ai controling everything is good nope.

JUST HAD AN AD ABOUT HOW AI OPTIMISESS SOME ONE SCHECULE
Says Disney is making propaganda yet hosts Google paid ads…
🔇
I love your videos
🤐
There’s no such thing as an original work anymore so AI is not doing anything different.
Disney is a corrupt monopoly.
I have seen "Independence Day" about 50 times, and I have NEVER noticed that the uniforms were not authentic. They looked military to me. So really, do we HAVE to cozy up to the armed forces to get the movie made?
Marvels: why did the Kree lose the ability to rebuild their AI from scratch if the AI ever gets destroyed ? ... the only way for that to happen is rampant corruption in the Kree and therefore civil war was inevitable regardless of whether it was the Captain Marvel or any other entity that was the final straw!
I missed ur sexy voice matt
I’ve had a fear of AI since I can remember. I think I watched Terminator to young!😅 While I have become more comfortable with it over the years, I still firmly have a fear of it taking over. It’s on my bingo card every year. 😂😂
Oh no.
This video has been taken down due to talking about Disney propaganda
STOP SHOWING IT!!!
🫡
AI on it's own isn't the problem, it's how you use it. Yes, it can be used to steal work from artists and creators, but it can also be used as a base to create your own forms are art, or using AI voices to make silly memes. The issue is people using AI for greedy, lazy and malicious reasons, using it to destroy the livelihoods of people. THAT is what we should worry about, not "ALL AI IS BAD!". There's a chance we will have AI that thinks and acts like humans, and at what point should we still think of them as just machines and not people? Plus, Evil AI is most likely made by evil/careless people.
AI-generated things should not be the final product.  It's ok to use the to help generate ideas, layouts, and/or color palettes. It is not ok to publish AI-made work as if it was made by a person. It's also not ok to take AI-generated content and just edit it slightly so it's less bad, then claim that as something you made. AI-generated content should never be the endpoint, unless it is clearly disclosed as made by an AI and the point of the content was that it was made by or using an AI.
"Disney is making propaganda"  people from Russia: "YA THINK?"
🚨🚨How strong is Popeye the Sailor Man?   I'm very curious about this, and why nobody has done anything on this.
Remember when actors and the "creative" class were making fun of working class people for their fear of having their jobs taken?
It’s to good 😅
5:55 animation name?
I love Disney propaganda
The comment bots are wild, I literally don't care about how many push-ups your gonna do or if your content is "better" than matpats (it's not I guarantee)
Of course it does. Just look at star wars
AI Mat sounds like it was also fed a small dosage of Jay Baruchel.
Didn’t notice the LGBT+ propaganda, eh?
Independence Day shows too that you have Something not right here because you say when the Military dont Approves the Film they cant use uniforms and colors and so on that are from the Military and thats not true because you see in Independence Day people wearing uniforms that are the real ones or look like the real ones and they have the right colors too but what is a fact is that when you let the Military look over your film and make everything in the movie so that it looks like there the good guys and that they are very very Competent and absolut Elite then they give you uniforms, vehicles, weapons and even soldiers some for free and the rest for a very very small price in amounts as big as you want to 🤔😅
This explains a lot 1:29 1:29 1:29
An ad popped up around 10 minutes in where someone said ''This is how AI optimises my schedule and I don't regret it''. Laughed for 20 minutes at the sheer irony.
No disrespect but... its like saying people breath air
2:31
I heard a theory that Disney intentionally made wish bad so that they could make a good sequel for once.  So a friend told me this theory and I don’t know if it has any basses but basically it said that Disney (with its bad reputation with underrated sequels) chose to make the movie “less then optional” so that they could have as Many people hate it as possible in hopes of drawing attention to it then the internet would have people tell them what they didn’t like and what they specifically wanted in hopes of having it “fixed”in the sequel.  This would not only get people to (by comparison) love the new movie,but would also have many people adore the sequel movie and break there record of bad/underrated sequels. (think sonic the hedgehog movie and it’s original character design) I don’t know if it’s true but it does make a shocking amount of sense.😳😳😳  What do you guys think? Like if you think it’s true😂
Maybe put taxes in the next one? 😉
This is literally propaganda...
“Disney is making propaganda.” We call that taking the entire country over through cinema.
“Does this unit have a soul?” Cit
oh so ai art is literal ac redd buisness, STEALING AND SELLING WORKS OF OTHERS’ ART
Disney ....R.I.P....rape predators
We need to do more than form our own opinions we need to stop this Matt
10:00 The Martian was not propaganda. The plot follows the book and the author, Andy Weir, is a science aficionado. He simply thought that if China carried on booming economically, it would become the second most successful space-capable country, and if NASA needed help with a space rescue strategy, China would be the most probable candidate in this futuristic scenario.
...and I noticed everyone rejected all of Hollywood
You only now figured out about Disney's love for spreading propaganda?
Do people not know about Disney propaganda and stuff? Like it’s not hard to see, I won’t name stuff but they’ve been doing this for years :/
The title had me in the first half I thought the retirement broke ur brain for a second mat😭
The "AI" in House of Usher didn't end up being a good thing... yeah, the characters might have thought it was cool, but the AI ends up torturing the main character by the end... a little mixed example there
AI isn’t all good or all bad, it depends on how it’s used
Gi Joe mentioned 🗣️🗣️❗️‼️‼️❗️
0:32 hahaaaa! That joke brings me back to the good ol days of comedy. 😢when you could say anything without some snowflake screaming in your ear about politics and what not. 😂 cheers matpat! Here’s to a new beginning!  Edit: STOP CALLING ME A REGGIN
I did realize, in glad I’m not alone, there’s always propaganda n if you don’t see it you just agree with it
nothing makes your day better than being called a smart cookie by matpat
Propaganda - when a British person looks at something for an extended period of time.
Dystopian Futures... Assemble!
5:30   All statists are equally bad.
Suffer not the Abominable Intelligence. Remember that the soulless sentience is the enemy of all life.
I will do one anti pushup for every comment this gets (anti pushup I push down on the earth don't ask)
It's not really a Disney-caused issue. It's public curiosity. Snapchat is the biggest example. People love filters.
Forget AI used  for Hollywood, that's just groundwork for AI used for social profiling, use in military contexts, lethal AI weapons and more. Please don't think I'm exaggerating, I'm currently researching the topic, and the position MatPat shows Hollywood is taking is so aligned and no doubt is funded by the US position regarding use of lethal AI weapons (which they have pushed so bad in international relations contexts). Very eye-opening video, really demonstrates they are patient but steady with propaganda.
the dislikes are from disney employees
Having an ad about Patriot Missiles immediately transition into a heartfelt backstory was not something I expected to see today
One large part they take out is creativity. AI will never be able to create something on itself, it will never bring something new to existence whereas a human can do that. If AI begins to rule, imagine how many humans will lose their creativity skills. To be completely honest, children nowadays and the new generations have nothing authentic, it's all fake acting and their behavior is mechanical, predictable and completely copy and paste from other people. Nothing original or alive. This is what it means to be dead.
One movie with AI antagonists is "They Live" by John Carpenter released in 1988.
Considering that Both Turo/Sada and Order/Smallusk Get Redemption Arcs.  Gaming isn't Safe in this.
Hello Fellow Humans,  Get us to unemployment. In 10 years or oess we will see at least 50-70% unemployment if not higher. We need to think about humanity in a post work society.  AGI will kost likely help humans. Humans will destroy humanity before AI does. Insane religious cults are destroying society not AI.
Once again Mat comes in clutch to help me out with an English essay
The newest wild robot trailer proves him right again
The problem is not AI or even jobs being replaced. The problem is AI taking human jobs in an economic system that requires people to earn money to survive
There is no better advice I can give the average shmuck than this: Realize, the word propaganda has been propagandized. Think on that
The REAL reason Matt Pat quit YouTube. Disney came for him after this vide0
Not Disney but Detroit Become Human. I love that game. It worked lol
Audrey Hepburn was/is A.I. —- this has all been a trick so people THINK they know what A.I. is and where we have been technologically
Where C.H.A.P.P.I.E. at?
If we have to start banning AI because it's referencing other material and is trained off of other people's work, then I guess we better ban humans next. There was this one really successful movie from 1977 that straight up ripped off an old Japanese movie called The Hidden Fortress. Like, it used the exact same plot, repurposed characters if not straight up ripped them off, used character designs straight out of the older movie, and most people think the movie is entirely original and groundbreaking. What was that movie called again? Oh yeah, Star Wars.  Human creativity is just blending together things from our experiences. We cannot truly create anything new. Are we really gonna say "No more AI art" just because it's doing what the human brain does?
Hmmm... doesn't this video qualify as YOUR propoganda?
Biden : NEW RULE!!!! All A.I. must be based from Pokemon RBY A.I. That's how we'll keep em down!
2:31 why you get no bit-
Nice Peter’s Micheal Bay 😂
ah yes -7 theories left
Did anyone else hear a shorts wars glitch?
I follow a lot of creepypasta channels. The AI narrators and the AI generated stories just aren't as good. They're silly. And I know, creepypasta is a whimsical genre of horror, that's part of the appeal. Anyone with the slightest interest in writing can write creepypasta. So sometimes you get coal, sometimes you get gems. But every now and then, you get diamond, gold, and platinum tier content and that makes it worth exploring. But the AI generated stuff is always just okay. It never excels on the level of a talented writer who puts their heart into a project. And now the market is becoming saturated with this mass produced sub par garbage. Because there's no sacrifice that goes in to mass producing AI generated content,. and therefore no love.  I've heard women joking about becoming obsolete due to pleasure robots and AI girlfriends. But not only can a robot not give birth, an AI can't love you, and you can't truly love an AI.  The best stories are written by people who love their work, and because they love their work, they put sacrifice into it. They put discipline and determination into it. They take risks by putting their art out there for the world to see, and potentially reject. They sacrifice their ego by accepting criticism. And because of this, their work has a living essence, a spiritual presence that readers and listeners are able to connect with.  You never hear about quality fanfiction of an AI generated fictional universe, the best fanfiction comes from stories that people connect with mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. AI has a mind, and it's mental capabilities exceed that of a human. It can read a book in an instant, it can learn a language in a day, it can solve the most complicated mathematical equations in a fraction of a second. But it can't love, it can't hate, it can't take risks, it can't truly laugh or cry, and the art it creates are reflective of that.  Think about how much discipline goes into something as fringe as an underground death metal band. Each musician has to master their instrument or vocal skills, practice for hours almost every day, create music together and harmonize as a group. It's a commitment that requires most of every band member's free time on top of work and/or school. Their fanbase is relatively small, and they aren't even able to make a living wage off their shows and merchandise. But because they love the music, they still put their whole life into making it. It's not for everybody, and they know it. But they do it anyways because they love it. Now, you can whip up a death metal album in a day using AI with album art and everything. But it's just not the same, because the love and the sacrifice is missing.  That's why AI can't truly replace artists. They may be able to match and exceed the technical skill, but it won't connect with its audience the same way.
Wouldn’t AI training from other examples just be chalked to being the same as inspiration like we humans do? We all copy eachother in one way or another so how can we say that what the AI produces isn’t original?
the best propaganda is helldivers 2 propaganda.
Why is this guy still making videos? wasn't he supposed to have retired 2 months ago?
To think that you got hundreds of years of propaganda about demonized jews, and in recent 60+ years about demonized Israel even in DC posters and marvel works of old WWII days without the use of AI  Now AI makes everything much easier for haters to make people hate,  While MatPat probably didn't wanted to touch that sensitive topic I'm willing to bet that the next propagandas of the incoming decade will be also relates to the demonization of jews and their state, which is nothing new to people who actually know and care about history (and I mean to the real one, not to the subjective one that is in each person mind that overall denys reality), but now with the use of AI and the much more progressive tone the west (mainly the US cause EU was already a lost case for 30+ years by now) has taken, it will only get worse,  Waiting for mad comments below to prove my point lol
Crunchyroll is also using ai.
They’ve been doing the worse ads for the army recently. They are trying to target women into the army, at the same time when there’s been a decrease in numbers of men joining the army in the western world. The same amount of women who join the army, have left the army.
Uh oh! Looks like skynet owns Disney now
The creator was just straight up propaganda, and to on the nose. Even my parents who usually turn their brains off when they watch movies called out that the movie was Ai propaganda.
Can you make one about Hazbin hotel
But once the AI technology is cheap enough for the average person to access it, it will become very easy for creative individuals without any budget to use AI generated images to tell their story with top notch acting and visual effects without the the need for a multi million dollar budget. This could revolutionize movie making the way that the printing press made it so that anyone who could read and write could write books.
Ai just needs to be cute and we'll be all for it lol
Saying Biden acted decisively on anything during this presidency is hilarious.
I like how AI's horror is explored in Arc of a Scythe, with memory constructs and the strange sense of constant surveillance under the benevolent, sentient, seemingly infallible AI called the Thunderhead that operates the world and helps people out, and how even people who think they're rebelling against the system are still under its control with things purposefully designed to trick them into thinking they're fighting against the system, and how that though things may be "perfect" under the AI's rule, everyone has no purpose in life and lives very bland, soulless lives. Oh yeah, and one story in Gleanings, an anthology of stories from the series' universe, where an art student creates an AI to copy other students' art, and I won't spoil the whole premise but it's genuinely so deeply dystopian and terrifying. (edited for spelling)
15:20 omg MatPat became a gorgeous butch lesbian
The real problem is the economy, Movie propaganda can be ignored or ridiculed,  the economy can not. Woke movies serve as a distraction.
It’s crazy because we also have “the wild robot” is also coming out by Dreamworks this year
The Chinese market being a lucrative market for American films is a lie tbh.  Majority of Hollywood films aren’t doing well their save for a handful of franchises.
Cant believe megaman would do this sfm
I understand how the Marvels may have had pro AI messaging intended, but I saw it as a warning against reliance on power, technology and AI, putting too much power into it. The Kree are utterly dependant on the great intelligence, so that when it is destroyed, they fail to live. Maybe it was intentional from the writers, maybe not, but it still came off that way to me
Propaganda is advertising without any product to sell. Doesn't sound like Disney to me. Disney literally just makes products people purchase, therefore they make commercials, not propaganda. If it was merely making purely informational videos for educational, not commercial entertainment, purposes you could pretend capitalism isn't the sole motive at play here. Are McDonalds tv spots propaganda or commercials to you?
The Martian already had the china plot point in the book
I so desperately wish this was the only propaganda that disney is peddling.
I remember the TV show dinosaurs, poking fun of us
I wish AI was the only propaganda Disney peddled
Ugh this makes me sad. As an artist, I've been fighting the AI battle for quite awhile... It's sickening how people hear how this is negatively affecting people and say stuff like "go cry about it. This is the future" like nothing. People are showing their true colors day by day with their lack of empathy towards something that doesn't affect them just for their benefit.
You always have to remember “Big Brother is watching you” George Orwell 1984 (ironically, the book is also technically propaganda but point still stands.)
Thankyou Matpat the ministry of truth, Finds your video on propaganda of the automatons as good you will now be upgraded to a class B citizen.
Disney Too Rich.
😢 You ending it
matpat fell off
Automation bad, only when it concerns me, not when it concerns others, the combine harvester stole millions of jobs, the automated cranes and ports of the world made millions jobless, but who cares, it only matters when it dehumanises me (I'm a crying artist)
Me: Thankfully I'm watching only the goodies  Aphmau: Are you sure about that Me: JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE A CHARACTER THAT HAS ME A CRUSH, DOESN'T MEAN I LIKE YOUR CONTENT Zane: Uh Who is that ,and why did you point me?
7 Film Theories until Matpat is gone
I'm planning on going into the film industry as an editor, see AI videos look good (not like kwebbelkop) it makes me think I might lose my job opportunities before I get the chance to take them.
Stop noticing things.... you might start noticing other propaganda... 🙈
the creator`s concept seems like a lot more in the direction of detroit became human or i robot
underwhelmingly this issue reminds me of something a friend of mine once said "we are living in the most boring version of dystopia/cyberpunk" there are no great ai revolutions, corporate wars to fight head on with explosions and grit, no great struggle in the light just outside courtrooms to revive justice or secure workers rights. there is just a slow, necrotic fissure slowly growing in society from an apathetic progress. art being replaced by artificial work and worth in work becoming artificial, when really that should be completely backwards. it defies logic that we would create technology that imitates art rather than by replacing dangerous work in industry. but it feels like we are writing ourselves out of the narrative without any kind of meaning or foresight.
Right after this video comes out then they release a trailer for the good robot. I don't think it could be any more obvious than that.
plot twist: this was all ai
The creator was actually really good
Disney is evil. Do not do evil.
I watched the Creator and it might have been one of the worst movies I’d seen last year
If humans start outsourcing their own creativity, we lose our ability to think and submit our inspirations to artificial intelligence.
this isnt a theory its fact
Disney apart of the octopus too 👁️👃👁️
I was not expecting MatPat to bring up the same thing I recently talked about on my channel XD
Disney is collapsing they’re just not worth attacking
All art is propaganda.
Internet: We REGULATED AI AI: I'LL BE BACK!!!
wow even the ads next to this video is called the Wild Robot.
Why did Holywood cancle "Westworld"?....
5:55 this ad actually didn't help recruitment efforts. It actually hurt it.
did anyone else google iRobot's release date after he said "too far off from iRobot 20 years ago."? o.o
I mean there are still evil AI movies. M3GAN was pretty good and tbh, it was basically the 2019 Child’s Play
That’s crazy to think about 😅
I see AI going one but two ways: it advances and becomes a power house for mainstream media corporations to stay ahead of an evolving tool… or we see a fair distribution of media from smaller groups who’re taking advantage of that same technology. It’s here guys whether you like it or not you’d rather no how to use it then to not🤷🏾‍♂️
M3gan was the last kick of a dying horse on the front of “don’t trust AI like that!” That doll’s final monologue told us everything we need to understand about the world we’re evolving into. Sigh😢😅
Ive been saying this for years ,i got to say thank you for making this maybe i can get some to believe now
Writers: "we will make any form of propaganda you want so long as you pay the price of our souls". AI comes in Writers: "We fu**ed up"
I’ve had a pretty big issue with Military propaganda for a while now because of how it targets people. I have no issue with anyone who is serving or wants to serve on their own free will. Where I have issues is when you come across ads (especially ones on Spotify) that are specifically designed to target early college students who are probably 18-21 with the promise of helping pay for or completely free tuition or that going into the military will help break the “endless cycle of life”. Targeting someone who isn’t even old enough to drink by saying life is just an endless cycle when they could very easily achieve a fun and entertaining life in a few years is extremely wrong on every level and really just shouldn’t be allowed. And if you think it wouldn’t work on you just remember that you aren’t who they are targeting. They want people that it will work on
This is all short sighted. There is a natural progression to all technology just like cars and computers and the internet. AI is just advanced statistics  and outlawing statistics is well kind of dumb. Things will change and that's a good thing. Humans thrive on change.
I am not convinced Disney and other big corporations will be the big AI winners as AI is for everyone and thus groups and individuals are going to be able to compete for the first time with massive studios.  All companies will be facing serious AI enabled competition that their big structures will have a hard time competing with. Will be fun to watch it all play out.
TIL there was a Matrix 4

Low key Bran Stark ruling Westeros has AI undertones
Low key Bran Stark ruling Westeros has AI undertones
That “modern” video of our middle defense systems lol. Ultimate pandering
This is so true and alarming. This video is well done. Stay free thinkers my friends
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER M.E.G.O.N
Why does he have to grunt the first word of every statement?
I'm not an expert, but I think a person's likeness/personality is the last thing we as individuals can still really claim as our own. Don't sell your image to a corporation that already owns your attention
Thinking Nazis are the bad guys is proof you consume propaganda without realizing it.
I don’t need to watch this to know Disney makes propaganda. It all over. Any media you consume probably has some. Some a lot more than others.
Transhumanism is just the latest evolution of the agenda that's been running for millennia--slavery.
AI will never do art. It can recycle propaganda,but never create art
"been using ai even if you didn't realize it" yea it's pretty obvious. the last season of fear the walking dead was clearly written by a robot. the dialog and characters are horrible.
You'll be back.
Best way i can personally describe propaganda is that its political marketing.
The mouse and Satan sitting in the same room... thats all I see when I think about Disney.
1. Wouldn't you agree that it's better for the US military to advertise and recruit than for foreign powers to do so? Because if the film studios aren't getting a paycheck from the US they WILL go elsewhere and we will still watch the movies and be influenced against the USA.  2. The creator was thought of by the director as a creative idea not a piece of propaganda. You can hear his thought process on the Corridor Crew video.  3. The movie with the "AI Generated extras" did not use AI generated extras, they used poorly created and animated 3D models. Anyone with a small understanding of CG work can see that. There is also an explanation on another Corridor Crew Video.  I understand that this is Film "Theories" but you say these things as if they're fact and the result is that YOU spread anti-AI propaganda.
The current generation of actors will never die. You'll be watching Morgan Freeman when you're 90, if you're 30 today.   Let that sink in.
Now is the time for our government to implement laws for AI use. There has to be some conceptual laws about it in sci-fi somewhere...
Disney? Propaganda? No way
i’ll miss this guy man.
Artists use the inspiration of artists all of the time. All art is derivative, so if we were to say that AI software can't use existing content, we'd have to go back and take a good look at all art, or just say the AI is creating a "parody." That might work.  If Hollywood regulates AI, then Silicon Valley will probably come out with the next big hit using AI. If we regulate it nationally, then maybe China will start writing all of the biggest hits. Stopping technology is a bit like beating back the tide. No matter how much you fight, the water will get through.  "The fates lead him who will. Him who won't, they drag."  I don't think AI is taking over the world any time soon. The only concern right now is likeness, which should be debated, for sure. I just don't see a conspiracy of propaganda, or maybe I don't watch enough Disney. Still, since computers don't do anything they are not programmed to do, they are more likely to be peaceful.
Idk why everyone sees all these science fiction where it says *DO NOT CREATE AI* and someone says “we should create Ai” and not only creates Ai they create it to eliminate artists instead of getting rid of boring dangerous jobs
Westworld, blackmirror..?
If it's mainstream trendy It's Corporate Co-opted  Even social rights movements
Thought Matt was going to tackle the M SHE U but I guess he wants to be safe
Most movies ate propaganda. Live is never like a movie.
Why the final 10 episodes ? Where are you going ?
They have been doing that. Subliminal messages have always been in their movies, even back in the 90's you can find unneeded scenes pushing woke views. And the term "conspiracy theory" was formed by our government when we kept questioning JFK's assassination.
I don't watch this content but this video has an important message and deserves awareness
i thought propaganda means it was conceived of and paid for by the government
VIVA LA REVALUTION
The reason communism fails is because of human nature. So how about communism run by AI? Yay china! It cant be racist if our over lords are robots.
Gonna have to hard disagree with the artists having a big win. Most of them cannot find jobs now.
Did you leave off Simone (Sim One)?
When you make a video exposing propaganda, yet the video itself its far right propaganda.
Yes! Wish felt exactly like it was written by AI, even the music felt like it was following an algorithm.
Hmm this is interesting but the next video in my list is a big b00bed brunette trying on see through clothes....  catcha later lol
We are already being replaced with the woke cultists and the 3rd world, AI needs to take a ticket and join the back of the queue
You forgot the most important : the leftists propaganda of kids having 76 different genders and transitioning operations for underaged .
IMO, regardless of its possible negative societal implications, generated content is inevitable. The content being used to train these models should be open-source or licensed but regardless it will happen. Individuals and companies alike should be working to take advantage of such a powerful new technology rather than fight it when it doesn't make sense. We can't just ban such a massively productive and useful technology so we might as well add some safety-rail regulations and embrace it.
The Creator is very much a Chinese film lol they make the main character very lackluster on purpose , makes the African American Soldier look like a bad father to this kid the whole movie also gave him all the worst dialogue too
The real propaganda disney is doing is about race and gender
AI already take over the world!
AI gets me to go out and look for things that I used to find online.
Oh Great. An Even Worse Take On A Topic Than Just Misrepresenting A Show I Watched To The Point Where It Was Wrong. Another Group Of People. Another Community Crushed. Another Hobby Destroyed.  AI Is Not The Death Of Us. Companies Are. The Fact That Protests Don't Make An Impact. The Fact That Fines Are Drops In A Bucket. The Issue Is Not AI.  A Defense Will Always Be Broken If It Does Not Evolve. Human Ingenuity Will Find A Way Around Obstacles.  If Not AI Today, Then Something Else Will Come. Simply Because The Focus Is On The Weapon And Not The Ones Wielding It Improperly.  Packaging The Message Of AI Bad Like This Causes Uproars. It Causes Innocent People And Ideas To Be Burnt In A Fire. Propaganda By Base Defnition Is Simply Something Used To Convince. Everything Can Be Propaganda. Everything Can Be Used To Convince Someone Of Somthing. Which Is Why, Someone Should Learn How To Stand On Their Own Two Feet First. Propaganda Doesn't Work If You Have The Conviction. The Conviction To Fight For What You Believe In.  This Is BS And Simply Gathers More Issues And Dumps It On Another Group Of People. Issues Should Not Be Brought To The Broad Audience Of Those Online Simply Because Many Are Very Ignorant And Very Uncaring To Think Things Through.  Where Issues Were Already Being Dealt With Properly Until A Mass Of People Just Clump In And Overpower. Great. Just Great.
This isn’t a theory it’s fact
Maybe there should be something similar to the rating system added to movies and games that show that AI was used in the development and then they legally need to publish the exact elements used or face fines and penalties.  People can then make a choice if they want to support those products with their money.
It's absolutely crazy just how much propaganda is pushed onto us as the American public, and we think we wouldn't do it again or at the least fall for it since we've learned from the past...right? Right?  We're constantly drowned in propaganda from the feminist ideology, military recruitment, immigration, parenthood, and as we see here even AI. It's just sad the public doesn't realize all the bullcrap peddled by companies and the government alike to socially engineer us into good little sheep.
Forgot Female power propaganda. But I know you can’t say that out loud.
Wait you talk about AI ?! What about Gendermainstream Disney is pushing for way longer and bolder.
honestly the sad part is that even as we watch this video and get to "know" for the battle, ultimately corporations outlive us and future generations will be more easily swayed as they didnt experience the things AI is taking from us right now.
This would have been a good episode for the true 4th game theory channel... conspiracy theory
Sorry to say virtually all of entertainment is a propaganda platform, Disney isn't the only one
Disney has always made propaganda. It’s only now an issue because conservatives don’t like the propaganda they are making.
Horseshit, we know brandon didn't remember watching the movie
They've been making propaganda for 2 decades now.     It's nothing new.    It's more that some people are starting to wake up to the fact that Disney is no longer the company that Walt Disney created.
That boiling frog thing isn’t real, and I only mention that because this is a place that celebrates trivial corrections:)
Since when was the old intro back!?! Its amazing yesssss
I have to commend Matpat and the theorists for this one, this is such an important topic in todays world and it's especially hard to get across when the media is so controlled by the government or corporations through algorithm censorship and outright lies. It's great to know the theorists have things like this in mind when making their content, them being one of the most successful YouTube based organizations and one of the most viewed/trusted sources on entertainment in mainstream media.
Talk about israel.
The fundamental problem is capitalism.
Disney has produced nothing but propaganda for at least the last 5 years.
Wake up? Disney has been a propaganda machine forever, Walt himself even made propaganda cartoons for the military industrial complex in the early 40s.
Rainman and Outbreak are propaganda
Operation Mockingbird was a covert U.S. government operation run by the CIA to implant pro-US propaganda in American media and front organizations. Starting in the 1950s, the CIA began to hire and contract students and people in the media to write false stories for the government. (Keep that in mind)
As someone who's read the SAG voice actor AI agreement, it's worse than it sounds. No residuals, nothing. Just a quick paycheck for new voice artists who will never get work again so long as the agreement's in place.
Come see the newest attraction at Walt Disney World. Skynet….
And to think I thought that “The Creator” positive portrayal of AI was an interesting artistic endeavor, wait to go and ruin another film for me.
This video: “Disney is Making Propaganda!” Everyone paying attention: You’re just noticing this now?
If the Speaker of the House and the GOP were not currently official conduits of Russian propaganda this might surprise me. But we live in a world where the FOX Propaganda Network exists. So in comparison this is a nothing burger.
It's hard for me to feel sorry for the writers and actors in Hollywood when they haven't done anything good in years.  Though as regards feeling sympathy for AI, no worries there. The Imperium is my 40K faction. I know what to do with an Abominable Intelligence.
I think you have missed the mark, pad. These new "propaganda" are to offer agi a glimpse at what it can become. These were not Disney's push, but rather the director/producers... it's still meant to sell and it is "art" (meant to make you think"). There are a whole slew of ideologies that might be revised in the future, but... these depend on us to "push" better definitions. I know this channel is all about creating alternative viewpoints, but... I think you've missed that one. Not a lot of people are Actually thinking that what they're doing is bad. Some of us, of course, aren't thinking at all (thus being malleable by subliminal messages or similar tactics... to sell or simply "direct the general public's ideologies").
Wait. Ai = Adobe illustrator? 😱
I did not have based mattpatt on my 2024 bingo card
Umm, Disney making propaganda just a theory? A company owned, managed and operated by "human rights activists". What could possibly go wrong..
You can thank the Obama Administration for repealing the Smith/Mundt act that protected us from foreign paid Propaganda in media, So now all the NGO's are shelling out truckloads of cash to destroy American culture
The propaganda is not all that secret though. At least not to those of us who are paying attention.
Its been a guilty pleasure watching Disney destroy itself since it became woke propagandists dedicated to Destroying all the beloved IP's of the past 30 yrs!   Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave over how these zealots have DESTROYED his life's work and legacy
Is that the og intro theme song
Disney has always made propaganda. That was literally the whole point the entire time.
Honestly AI is going steal all of our jobs
Be nice to see more movies presenting both positive and negative AIs and robots, both good and bad.
But if you read the comics, you'll find that the system they created was corrupt and more harm than good and even evil.  I see it more of showing sometimes fixing a problem is more complicated than just doing away with the corrupt system.  Sometimes you need need a replacement to create a solution and that heroes and good guys can make mistakes that make them appear like bad guys.  Destroying the system wasn't the issue.  The issue was not realizing they made their air supply reliant on the system and not recognizing it and coming up with an alternative before hand.  She solved half the problem, not realizing the second half accidentally replacing one problem with another.  This happens all the time.  Really wish the movie gave you more time to feel the emotion and was less rushed.  It was an okay film.
AI mattpatt definitely sounds off from actual mattpatt
No one matpat talks about his own AI. Hes seen the cuban sandwich video guys
SPOILLERS FOR HOUSE OF USHER. I have a little gripe with the House of Usher point. Yes, Lenore answers the questions and is converted into an ai chatbot, but if you watch the series all the way through, the text AI doesn't end up working and actually serves as a minor antagonist to Roderick throughout his whole meeting with August. It get's stuck saying "Nevermore," haunting Roderick with the name and recurence of his recently dead grandaughter. I don't think that's a fair point to say it's pro AI when it ends up being a botched AI horror experiement that is the contributes to Roderick's torment in the persistent confession interview.
Dude you're doing a video supposedly exposing propaganda while simultaneously usimg the exact same manner of speaking that propagandists use like on the news, using your pitch tone and rhythem so that people don't just hear what you say but accept it as true because of you manner of speech.  Please stop using the news brainwashing speaking style and just talk like a normal human being, your fake "high energy youtuber" voice is lame, they're all lame.
Disney has been part of the leftist/managerialist propaganda machine for decades
bro i really wanna watch the video but your over exaggerated talking is making it impossible to do so
I’d assume so knowing that most of the land purchased for them near Orlando was done through CIA shell companies.
As an artist myself im not scared, let the corporations try without us; it my cost me a job, but im not doing it for the money anyway. In 2 generations the companies will be back, or not. But the humans will, to be understood again by fellow humans.
"AI does the stuff, and crypto makes the money" -Warren Buffett
Ai MatPat digivolved into Ben Shapiro.
So isnt this video a form of propoganda as well? The frame for this video is antiAI
Behind the curve?
And here I thought this video would be about the push by Disney of the alphabet propoganda and agenda.
Matt's only about 100 years too late on this one.  The irony is that this video is also propaganda.
THIS is the subject you choose to talk about Disney propaganda?!?  Not social engineering that has been loosing them billions trying to get us to accept the woke agenda?  A.I.?  That is what you think is important?
The Metal Gear franchise has taught me to not trust AI
Movies and shows have always paved the way for things to come. Jesuit theater. Go down that rabbit hole and you will uncover so much more.
I started watching film theory before I knew game theory was a thing and before food theory and style theory even EXISTED so the intro just gives me such a big feeling of nostalgia I’ve really missed it 🫶🫶
I remember an iteration of Terminator Salvation had Skynet being painted as the villain but by the end they'd be discovered as the saviours of the human race using robotics to prolong human life and give them a chance to survive the new world, enhanced. I bet Cameron's new take will bring this back. Salvation had Conner dying and Marcus taking on his identity with a face graph.
If you are in the UK look up the Nudge Unit.. It's a government department made purely for social engineering consent
Tom cruise on that Scientology bs. He crazy.
Why has no one asked the question, why do we get access to this technology? The answer is control. It's going to get to a point where you can't tell what's real and what's not. And that's when they are going to take all your rights and freedom away. Especially on the internet.
Good job on you MATPAT for being 4 years late to the party and now just wanting to say somerhing about it
There is Matrix 4? Ok then...
It's weird because humans engage in the same practices as generative AI, scouring the earth for inspiration and/or techniques and/or references to create books, movies, art, etc. but the second we find a way to write a program that does the same thing there's a very eerie robophobia applied to the process because it's exponentially faster than an average human.
Great video Matt!
really you don,t say
The higher ups at Disney think they can't be replaced.  AI will eventually replace everyone's jobs, and we can all finally be free to do whatever we want with our time, instead of trading it to a boss we despise, for currency that loses value every year, at a job we hate.  We need AI! It will be a bumpy road. People will suffer. But they'll suffer more if they fight against it, because it's a battle they can't win.
Nothing is "inevitable" if the people don't pay for it, its that simple, don't support it with your money.
Now everyone take what you learned from this video and the mistrust that we should have for these overlords - and apply it to other areas in our lives 🫡 great video MatPat!
Definitely reframes the use of AI for the credits of Secret Invasion. At the time I saw it as a way to play into the whole "are they human or alien" theme running through the show but this definitely gives it a new wrinkle.
Hasn’t everyone been “donating their likeness” on social media for over a decade now?
I can agree with all the movie examples you gave... but not top gun. That might be seen as propaganda to get people to enlist into the airforce because it's "cool", but it wasn't propaganda for capitalism, etc.   I'll defend that movie, but the rest I agree with (including captain marvel. Plus, I loved how you pointed out that independence day got into trouble with the US military).
sure as dieyn well do this agin ugh
"Disney is making propaganda" in other news the sky is blue.
Propaganda is when a British person takes a good look at something
Common misconception. Biden didn’t make the decision because Biden can’t even make the decision on what flavor ice cream he gets from an ice cream parlor. Considering how much he stammers, and how much he stutters when he’s doing literally anything that involves addressing the country as “the president of the United States of America“ I’d be surprised if he can make any conscious decision of his own accord that isn’t one of his advisors or assistance telling him to do it
We miss you Matpat
Why didn’t they put a poster called got milk
AI IS JUST STEALING
Pls do a Mean Girls theory
Can you speak like a normal human?  Thanks.
I think this video is in general pretty good, but that Netflix part is deceptive at best :/. That clip from “Fall of the House of Usher” is about the character Madeline whose whole point is chasing immortality. They show that her ideas are immoral and doomed by the end of the show pretty clearly, having an A.I of the little girl start sending incoherent ominous texts to the narrator. Calling a clear symbol for Madeline’s fatal flaw a “random propaganda addition” seems dishonest. Please do stronger research next time.
Haha movies affect policy. What a ridiculous country
AI learns about art the same way that everyone learns about art. Who hasn’t redrawn comic book characters and cartoons. That’s how you learn and get better. If AI is stealing by learning through others arts then humans have been stealing too.
So is replacing whites propaganda supporting replacement? Yes
:)
:)
I don't get all the hate for Adobe Illustrator.
DON'T. DATE. ROBOTS.
Always has been
I can't believe you made this video without even mentioning the greatest propaganda film of all time; Schindler's List.
I rather surprised to see this channel cover this
You think AI is the main propaganda being pushed today? You missed another big portion of what is being pushed from Hollywood (especially from Disney) recently...
4:18 lol I have this tower
I mean, Disney started making propaganda during WWII.  This isn't a new development.
Pro-America propaganda? Seems to be the opposite now
I've seen too many Terminator movies for AI propaganda to work on me
the fake matpat voice sounded more like the odd1sout
5:50 I don't think that's the Army, I see a globe, eagle, and anchor on that sword. It's a Marine recruitment ad.
Based mattpat as he walks out the door 🫡
Hollywood propaganda has been going on for a long loooooong time.
impressive you could make this without touching Western culture wars
At the end of the “fall of the house of usher” the AI daughter is actually really creepy. She gets killed and they didn’t finish the project so he was getting weird random texts from his dead granddaughter
I get what you were trying to say, but the thing about wish "possibly being AI generated because it felt that way" is weird. It has writers credited. It's not like the Disney machine was famous for putting out cold souless tripe before generative AI existed, or anything.   Also your points about The Creator, "Don't your look!" Weirdness aside, doesn't stick because that's about AGI, something completely different from what we have now. It probably won't be too long before we get there, though
Ai propaganda is one thing... Clearly missing the insane mark here that is identity politics, in which China has a MASSIVE stake in, question yourself why.
This has been known since the 1970s.
Remember: Its not a conspiracy or theory when backed by evidence, its a fact. Disney has always made war propaganda.
Does anyone in 2024 think Disney is *NOT* making propaganda?
I hope that they don't use my voice in any games or anything using AI... I'd like to be paid to voice act someday and this is going to ruin my chances for that in the future
This is my first time watching your channel. The opening credit music is worse than children screaming.
Biden, the first AI generated president, pushes legislation involving AI. This should end well.
my teacher showed this vid in class yesterday
The creator really made me think. It's a good movie
Technically all movie studios expecting release to the Chinese market already make propaganda.   In order to be released by the Chinese government a film cannot have any negative connotation to the government.  An example would be changing the patch on the back of "Maverick's" bomber jacket in the latest Top Gun film. The patch was stripped of any sign of it's historical contrxt as a means of communication for American pilots downed over "Red" China.  Film is always propaganda. I am surprised you hadn't already realized it.
Mattpatt:guys this movie “the creator” is crazy propaganda from the ai agenda Also mattpatt: fellas I love this movie it’s amazing you really should go and watch it.
Uh.  the MEDIA coverage over the strikes was about AI.  the actual reason for the strikes was the residuals over streaming programs.  well, thats why i was glad you finally stopped.  you say....wrong things with such certainty that its believable.
When I learned about propaganda, they used Disney footage…
Is it just me or do some scenes in the new live action avatar look like they have ai backgrounds?
When I was in highschool my history teacher made a point to let us know the government should never be friends with the media.
Sheesh why stop with just movies, videos games are also another suspect.  We put in hours upon hours into video games, and considering that most game online are now Live Service Games. All of those funny and great moments we’ve had in games are simply data that’s collected over every match we play every level and strategy we implement. We’re simply training our enemies how we think and act. Maybe that’s something worth looking into as well.
AI is kinda disturbing....or i should say, the way in which AI is currently being employed is disturbing..   This whole analysis is very surface level. You're talking about greedy corporations using pro-AI propaganda, to get people comfortable with AI, so they can use it in their products, to save money.. This is such a nothing concern, that you bringing it up is even more disturbing than the current, and planned uses for AI.. These current and planned uses go SO much deeper than simply allowing a company to make more money by eliminating human resources. It's so much worse than this. Why don't you cover that?  And while i'm on the subject of asking why... why don't you cover the stuff that current media is ACTUALLY using propaganda to push?  Oh wait, you don't want to run afoul of youtube, and lose money..  You should stick to pop culture stuff, and not even mention or allude to conspiracies, unless you're ready to cover them completely, and honestly.
Important to note: This does not mean that AI is bad. The biggest concern I hear is: "AI will steal my job" However I find this a very weak argument. Because it would apply to all past use of technology. In fact if there were no jobs at all because AI jsut does all the work that would be fine. If there are no jobs for humans that would imply that our potential work would not increase the recources we need.  And when everything is plenty and there are no shortages, then you dont have to pay for it. Like oxygen is free because Trees do all the work for us. And it doesnt cost anything because we have so much of it.  And if you are still not convinced. Think about this: Assume there is one person in the world, which own all companys and production capacity. There is nothing this person could want from us. We dont have money, our work is not needed,... there is no incentive to charge us for using the produced goods. You only want money because you can exchange it for something you value. If one person owned everything, that person wouldnt need money.
Long time ago I written a book about an alien race that have AI units integrated into homes ships, and various things.  They have their own personalities and so forth.  They were not made to replace people in jobs, They were used as aids or worker companions.  Per example, in our world a Police officer often has a partner, well in this alien race, their partner is their ship whom has an AI unit.  It seems rare to see a story where there is no disparate between AI and organics.  So I'm kinda a rarity in story telling.
WOW ! You're Just Now Figuring That Out ? Obviously you've Never Seen Bambi.
the martian is not a great  example, since the china point is already in the book.
dude just learning about this 😂😂😂
i mean duh
a.i artificial intelligence.. It's in the name fake intelligence.. It's nothing but a program..
Too bad that won't change Anything.. They want you homeless they want you dependent on them they don't want you free..😂😂😂😂
I learned to draw by tracing and drawing copies of other people's artwork with a grid to guide me. The reason it took humans so long to advance tech and then suddenly tech took off is because we build on what we know, and we know what we know by learning it.
_"This is the future. Humanity translated into data"_  Probably one of the most chilling lines in the Max Headroom film.
I don't know why I wasn't subscribed before, but this definitely made me subscribe to this theory channel. Disney is corrupt AF!!
Oh my god I thought I was insane to think AI was going to be used to control the flow of information and as a means to control the population in general. But if MatPat saus AI is a big deal too and we should be at least a little concerned, then I'll use that as the fuel in my coocoo train.
I disagree with the stance MatPat made on Fall of the House of Usher. Yes, that was a very blatant line, but it misses the how this scene effects these two characters in the end. You have to consider the character who was getting an AI version of them self, and what happened with that AI at the end of the series.  With zero spoilers: They had an older character push the idea of AI on a member of the a much younger generation and make it sound appealing. However, in the end, the AI was buggy and haunting. I felt the show, overall, had a very negative AI message.  I feel this line was taken a little out of context for the sake of an AI propaganda argument.
Instead of making fashion theory it would’ve been better if he made a channel called conspiracy Theory
What about the movie AI
Knowing is half the battle...how is this propaganda.....
Lets not forget the other propaganda Disney has been pushing...
Yeah it’s not a theory it’s a fact
Haven't seen one of these since FFVII
What happens when anyone can make a movie or film though? As in the resources required to make a film are so astronomically low (no need for artists, screenwriters, actors, and little computing power) that anyone can make a good film. At that point bigger companies lose a huge advantage since anyone can make anything it doesn't matter that they have so much and indie companies or even just individuals can compete with them.
i don't think the martian was propaganda bc it was a book before it was a film and it had the same storyline
ok. But generative AI is still really innovative with the things you can do with it.
"Disney is using propaganda." - MatPat  Color me shocked, I never would have imagined.
hmm
13:50 Oh good, we get the pro-China, America bad, AI good, humans bad propaganda all at once, sponsored by an American company. What a time to be alive.
You did not talk about the "girls cool boys fool" propoganda that's going on in Hollywood, what's the reason behind that?
Stopped watching for a long time, just came back and re-realized what well made content!
operation mockingbird in full swing
Chinese Milk comes from New Zealand
I like a little bit that AI isn’t always the bad guy because that’s usually the twist.
Jokes on them. Because i mostly just watch documentaries and history stuff. Cause a bunch of made of stuff, isnt nearly as entertaining as truth and history. Literally movies and tv, its written lies, and then spoken lies. History and reality, are far more interesting than made up stuff.
Not next propoganda was already on this video with the 2 moms comment
AI doesn’t have a soul. They can play the long game all they want , It will never have a soul.
Its an interesting time to be alive.
This is hilarious because all the older films depicting AI describe how they acted harmless in order to gain our trust but all simultaneously switched to being malevolent.
im not for disney, talking only about ai, the way its trained is perfectly legal, no one is stealing the content its trained with,therefore creating with it is fine
The whole world is done with global Disnefication. Let's just wait until they create content that is genuinely entertaining and productive, stop with all of the obvious propaganda.
They have ALWAYS  been propoganda. When the nation was christian, it was an8mals and comedy. After Walt passed, the decline of western civilization. I thought you young ones were smart? Seems like the x"ers are the only ones left to tell ya the truth. Hmmmmm
Geez manipulation from media is bare being seen now... huh i thought everyone knew...
I don't really agree with the example from The Fall of the House of Usher. The AI representation of Lenore in that show is horrific and tortures the main character with guilt by reminding them of a dead loved one. It also doesn't work properly. I feel like reading that as "Pro AI" like your other examples is just an incorrect reading of the text.  Also that's a really good show and you should watch it.
All of Hollywood is nothing but propaganda but okay, go off
new revelation: disney is making propaganda!  the whole world when Optimus Prime got onto the screen: 👈that guy is a walking american flag with american morals running on a loop. he says he saved the day but everything left is dust.
Matpat talking about propaganda is amazing, i used to watch him all the time as a kid. As i see the world more its nice to feel a creator growing with me
Also, there is a lot of brainwashing in media. Not necessarily a synonym, but can be.
I've loved AI since R2D2.
Disney has always made propaganda
Hollywood has been creating propaganda since the beginning.
Well, at least we know now, that we could have Mat Pat forever
So, knowing isn't half the battle? Is it the whole battle? Is knowing completely useless? I'm so confused.
Of course propaganda has a negative connotation to it, we're steeped in it and the handlers dont want the sheep getting out of the pin.
can you cover Rainimator befor you quit youtube?
I hate to break it to everyone, but ALL art is stolen and repurposed. Artists and writers are taking what they've read, what they've seen, and the best creators are able to make something 'new'. That's often why one artist, while having an original vision of their own, will often remind people of some past artists' work. It's a little different, bc AI isn't 'inspired', in the classic sense of the word.  Also, Flint was right:  knowing really is half the battle.  AND ROBOTS ARE PEOPLE, TOO
16:39, while it is great that one can revive the actors and the death of an actor won't mean that the whole script will need to be reworked if they had a major role and they hadn't finished their scenes yet, there should be a "consent for AI" thing.  After all, not everyone is okay with being deepfaked, such as one of the people from The Amazing Digital Circum, who voiced the teeth guy I forgot the name. I think it was Kane or something.
You kinda left out the detail where in The Creator, the whole war happens because the city was blown up due to some defect or something. One side thinks that the other attacked them first, while the other is simply living with the consequences of that accident.  Of course, it's still pro-ai, but the governments still had their reasons for going against them.
RIP PATMATT
This kind of AI has already been in use for a decade or more. We're only seeing it pushed into the public eye because there are actual videos of some very famous and powerful people engaging in some very illegal and VERY immoral activities starting to go around. They need AI generation to be a known thing so they will have plausible deniability. Thats the real propaganda. Seems like no one realizes this.
“And as always, I’ll see you next week” I don’t know about always… 😔
Ever since frozen, Disney kicked up its propaganda . Disney is no stranger to subliminal messages, but these days, it is supraliminal
Every young person needs to watch this video. Great job.
I said his years ago when CGI began being used in everything. Did it catch on?
Speaking of Disney's bigger propaganda, what do you think the point of the soldier girl's two mums was part of?
you called Biden decisive , twenty seconds in and I do not care for your opinion anymore
I think the 80s propaganda was great made feel as great as we are , the problem is when they start dividing people . Divided we are easier to control.
I do love that intro. It's just, fun 😊
Fractal Design R7 L The 90’s ad worked. Star Trek Destiny pronoun scene “The PLA will help us” Not iron man 3, Pacific Ring and Transformers.  No one did go to see captain marvel lol As if a random generator couldn’t make a real looking face.  You missed Stephen Spielberg (2001) AI
Most of it really goes over my head because until you said something about it I don’t think I ever would have known. If you said name propaganda I wouldn’t have been able to tell you any themes
Its interesting that the big movie studios are pushing AI to save money because the main reason they exist is because making movies was expensive. If they keep pushing down the cost of production then smaller studios will be able to enter the market and be competitive with little to no capital.  Even worse, if the AI programs get so powerful that any Anon with a potato computer can generate compelling content, then the entire industry might collapse.
two moms💀💀💀💀
Disney has been pushing proprangda lately, huh?  😂
at 14 minutes the only thing that came to mind was Apple's "Personas" on the Apple Vision Pro
Omg  Disney  have an agenda ???? I am sure absolutely everyone knows already
I think Age of Ultron was a definite noticeable turning point for Disney, considering not just Ultron, but Vision is also an AI. One is evil, the other good, representation of if cared for properly and properly handled it might be good, but if misused... we'll get Ultrons.
1/3 of the way in and I had to check the title to make sure I read that Disney was connected to this idea.
Biden wouldn't have remembered anything about MI2, he can barely remember what day it is. Definitely one of his puppet masters did the bill.
The Indiana Jones Deep fake is some of the worst their is. It was panned by most people except shills.
Ngl Disney is trying to help AI take over by inducing children first with movies and cartoons before they try and move on to elder generations since start with the kids the kids interact with the adults and then make the conflict that can be pushed by other adds and things that they connect to
This isnt a theory.. its factual
I like to say, "The More You Know 🌠 And Knowing Is Half The Battle 😉🪖"
A theory? That Hollywood pushes an agenda? Why that’s preposterous!!
Disney has been a propaganda machine since ww2
We need some sort of law that we HAVE to tell people when something is Ai generated
Hoelw did u mention good guy ai rrom old movies and not mention the iorn giant
Good , less jobs , well lets inovate  ,lets create   ideas?!  everlasting battery for phone ,  okok maybe something more helpful  an enhacer or invention to duplicate resources.   crazy ideas  but im here to provide other perspectives  too, id like to know more about other perspectives
The colossal oversight here for Disney is that AI is moving so fast that soon we won't have need for the entertainment industry as a whole. Unless there are some serious new regulations put in place, we will all just be sitting at home, typing literally anything we can imagine that we'd like to see, like, "Hey Dall-E, show me a 6 hour movie of Voldemort and Godzilla on an emotional roadtrip" and BOOP! Done. They'll have nothing left.  Craziest part is, this isn't the only misguided propaganda  Disney has going on lately. They're convincing POC that it is in their best interest to step into existing stories instead of creating their own, then dropping the ball by both alienating existing fans and making those movies over-produced and heartless. Bob Iger is wiping Disney's future, but not before wiping its past, too.
we will miss you matpat!
Would it make you feel better? If I told you it doesn’t sound a thing like you it sounds more like Bill cipher from gravity Falls which honestly I’d be more concerned actually. actually, are we sure that’s not Bill cipher that is exactly what Bill cipher would say in that situation
Holy ish. The Marvels literally had an AI GOD?!? Sheesh, Jesus really do be coming back any day....
Theory? Bro is 5 years behind the curve
There were so many references in here but I was still hoping to see a MGS2 ref like remember when “Campbel” said “we’re not exactly what you’d call, human”. Oh that moment would’ve been perfect for this video! Still good regardless, don’t get me wrong.
Actually in the beginning of the newest Indiana Jones, there’s one part where the Nazis sit Indiana down while kinda interrogating him, and if you look closely at his eyes, one is looking forward, the other one is drifting off to the side. That’s when I immediately knew it was a deepfake.
Disney has a very long history of producing propaganda.
"The Congress" is a near future documentary
This is soooo disturbing... I absolutely hate it
At this point I kind of hope AI does take over.
I know most of this already, but still freakin me out.
same with ideology politics, no?
So is there any chance the new pro-AI movies are being written by AI?
Only for a hundred years 😂
About the Captain Marvel movie, it failed. It's not well regarded. Worth mentioning that Brie Larson messed up quite a lot so it didn't work that well.  I've seen "The Creator". It didn't make me think AI is good. I never saw the machines as being no threat or that spaceship being the only option to destroy robots. In that movie the humans could have annihilated the machines easily. We have better weapons NOW in 2024 than they did in that movie. Worth mentioning that in the latest Indiana Jones movie the de-aging was obvious. AI is reaching a point where it will struggle to improve.  The Voice Actors have to be compensated.
Got very diligent my comment morel likes I give o it
We can tell Disney used ai like the movie wish that really seems ai writing to me
So the problem right now is that we can't have an open debate on what's going on and which direction would be best for Humanity. They are feeding the sheeple their opinion to them and before we know it were going to be enslaved.
To be honest I am genuinely afraid of ai. Badly Afraid. There are no benefits to it. It's like trying to tame a tiger. One day that tiger will eat you. You cannot tame a wild beast and you cannot tame something that will grow to understand us and how we work. It's very very terrifying knowing that one day if AI grows stronger we will fade and die off.
DAAASS CRAZYYY  If only massive evil corporations can be shut down
Should have waited a week, now there's Sora.
people forget Disney made many propaganda movies during WWII, indeed worded military and Gov
I watched Disney's "Rescue Rangers" (Chip & Dale reboot?) and it appears to have Disney anti-piracy propaganda "anti-bootlegging" as the main plot...
Total drama theory, total drama theory, total drama, dairy
I will do 1 jumping jack for every I get on this comment
My opinion on this is that whoever trains the AI should be asking for permission first before feeding it and that it would be better for everyone if it's used as a helper, not the creator. It not only respects the artists and voices and also doesn't put people out of job, but helps the jobs be easier at least in some way.
Um acshually you have to remove the frog’s brain in order to boil it without it noticing
Pls make a theory on the boy in the reflection
You know, the way AI has changed in movies like Matrix 4 sound a lot more like the evolution of a society that is more accustomed to having computers in their lives.  They arent just for outcast hackers like Neo anymore.  So it makes sense matrix 4 was more accepting of the concepts.  What we need, is creators like yourself to learn how to use AI as a tool to improve your own creations instead of joining the luddites making conspiracy theories about it.
man thiis sucks I love seeing robots get treated as something other then a bad evil thing, showing there struggles with being them an all that, but I hate AI... I don't know how to feel now
Comment
More should know about this
Now i remember why I always looked forward to your content l.
Please film theory do a South Park theory
Disney has been doing this for years now in favor of the pedophiles and satanists! You seem to only care when it's propaganda that you personally disagree with!
Capitalism. Capitalism never changes. It destroys all. It's a global plague.
I’ve heard it said that the anime Gate is basically Japan Safety Defense Force propaganda
Yvan eht nioj.
“The fall of house usher” seems a moot point as the the AI premise was relegated as a minor plot point and ultimately fit the narrative; as the psycho sister was seeking immortality to circumvent her deal with death/the devil … which further added too the spooky end (spoilers ahead) that the granddaughter wasn’t the one texting.  So I say it was a well earned creepy note.  Thus I don’t believe that it was a subtle push to endorse AI rather the opposite  As the show was mainly a  critique of the morality surrounding big corporate legacy in the modern world.   So love ya Mattpat, butcha goofed there.   Regardless a strong❤ case with the other proof in the rest of the essay.
Matt Patt I need your help, My daughter wants one know why Mikey has a pet dog and a friend dog!!! But I don’t know either😩
I always thought Disney movies have been pushing propaganda for decades: That your desires are more important than your family.
Eh, I don't really like the implication that AI is inherently bad. The way I see it, the AI today is no different to sewing machines during the Industrial Revolution or all the other automation that put people out of jobs. Ultimately, those inventions were good things that no one really complains about today, but they had a negative impact back then because rich capitalists used them as an excuse to fire their workers. The same applies today. There's nothing inherently wrong with giving lazy people tools to make "art" with a prompt. AI art, although inferior to true art, has been used for memes, humor, and other harmless fun and it's hard to argue that people who used DallE to generate Elmo being crucified are evil work stealers. The issue is that we live in a society where people, including artists, need work to live, and the "privilege" of basic human necessities are controlled by elites who would rather do anything than pay people what they need. We have the technology to automate most jobs in a way that alleviates the need for work rather than putting people out of work, technology that is only possible with AI advancements. In such a world, AI would not put people out of work but make lives objectively better, and while people would still make lazy AI "art" for clout, they wouldn't be endangering anyone's livelihood or stealing anyone's property by doing so. We need to tear down the system, not the machines.
As a actor AI can have the jobs. They don’t pay enough to do anything. Unless your a lead.
I watch all your videos on mute, with CC on
The creator was a really good movei
I got a propaganda ad while I was watching this video also am i the only one who realizes this video is propaganda it self or am I just being paranoid now?
It’s almost like… Sci-Fi authors have been thinking about these issues LONG before it became an issue. The Hollywood decided they were just wrong…
that movie was saying that humans are the ones that made the ai evil not the ai made itself evil
I hate how accurate this is… kinda gets me a little bit nervous
Glossary means to intentionally gloss over the true definition of words. It means to skew them to the point in which they lose their original meaning.  Discovering the true meaning of Stæfcræft is one of the fundamentals to remaining a free individual.
Fascinating to watch this video a day after OpenAI announces Sora with the hyper realistic capabilities of generating AI videos.
God created dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God created man. Man destroys God. Man creates AI. AI destroys MAN. Does anyone else see a pattern here?
I can only watch up to 4:20 of this video, strange....
I concur
Disney has just been a massive propaganda campaign since i can remember. its both sad and absurd to me how many people see and know what disney does, yet still gets on their knees for their garbage
Connect in MatPat. Cyberdyne-ZeroOne is the future ^_^
Yeah Disney making propaganda to throw people off about there monopoly smh 🙄
I would actually love to see most actors and other cinema professionals replaced by AIs if it means more movies are released and some of them happen to be actually good. In the end they will just produce personalized movies for each streaming service subscriber so I will be able to watch the Endgame movie where Captain America doesn't die. They will also write personalized wikis (like MCU wiki), movie reviews and even subreddits for each one of us so for example the MCU subreddit I read will also say that Captain America didn't die.
Wasn't Terminator 2 about friendship between human and ai?
I liked AI a few seconds ago, but now that I know Disney and Netflix want me to like AI I'm not sure if I like it as much anymore.
I thought this was common knowledge
THE COUNTDOWN IS MAKING ME CRYYY 😢😢
This thumbnail goes so hard
13:00 the creator is basically just a copy of a previously made film from South Korea called Space Sweepers. Its essentially the same storyline just different fonts.
Honestly, AI itself its fine, it's how people use it. I don't believe AI should be legal for commercial use (given some exceptions for recreational use like creating stories for yourself.)
There's more propaganda going on in these Disney films than just a pro-A.I. message.  The point of propaganda also isn't just to promote something as good.  Blatant lies and manipulation seen in propaganda is also meant to isolate its viewers.  It's blatant because the main message is, "It doesn't matter if you know we're lying; there's nothing you can do about it."  We know they're lying.  They know we know they're lying.  We know they know we know.  And yet, they still lie.
I'd love to see Mission Impossible fight Darkrock and prevent them from buying up all the houses in the area (any resemblance to real offshore investment companies is of course strictly circumstantial).
Lol.
Out at 8:39.
I will never support AI artwork, even till the day I die
Control the people to control the market, because people ARE the market. It's ALL propaganda.
You should do one last episode of hazbin hotel
Because replacing people with machines has never stolen jobs from a huge chunk of the population in the past. All the down stream consequences of mass job loss are totally a myth.
I, for one, welcome our new A.I. overlords...
Weird how Nazis were bad in Germany in WW2, but are now so good in Ukraine.
While you have correctly identified some of the propaganda come at us from the media, I feel like doing so actually provides cover for the longer term, more insidious leftist propaganda that has been part and parcel of media for over two decades.
15:18 ai generated Matpat isn’t real, he can’t hurt you. Ai generated Matpat:
I will do 2 pushups for every like this comment gets 💪🏼
This is good for my empire by AI 000.
Why is no one talking about how weird it is hollywood wrnt from ai and robots are scary and evil to now ai is what we want ai is our friend 😭
Oh please, ai being good has been around since Megaman
You don't have to stand there and say stuff, you have my permission to sit.
Its kind of sad you won’t get to do a video on this, but considering everything you just said, tiktok can share any videos you’ve uploaded to their platform with parent, sister, and 3rd party companies for monetary gain in exchange for sound samples for AI generated voices/characters. AI doesn’t just miraculously come up with something, it needs prior input in order to give results. Tiktok technically does own any/all content you post or allow them access to, this means your whole photo library and documents if you allow tiktok to make system settings changed. Read contracts and terms of service before you create an account online somewhere. At any time Instagram can use you, your image, likeness, or sounds without your permission for advertising… and that was before they were owned by Facebook. Not a film theory, not a conspiracy theory, it’s a social theory. A theory that we’ve already been broken. Most would rather embrace AI rather than fear it, and that’s probably what they wanted. Show case dangerous technology that ultimately does have weak points and trick people into thinking it’s that easy. Government employees aren’t allowed tiktok because biometrics are also collected and can be used to hack into highly secured systems, and it’s not so much AI is tiktok, but the algorithm and ‘trendy’ form is what keeps y’all addicted to it and it wasn’t until tiktok and their AI based algorithm that has set the new standards for most other social platforms
Hasn't it always made propaganda?
Susu_jpg is a good model for why you shouldn't fear AI. She's a beautiful model who's accepted (with her permission) AI generated artwork made up of her likeness. With AI as a partner she's multiplied her cash revenue and expanded her likeness and as I see it broadened her ability to be more than what is mortally possible.
I for one can't wait for our new robotic over lords....
No they aren’t, I’m not gonna watch unless you give this a non clickbait title, talk about hyperbole. Sheesh🫤
So every fictional plot is a propaganda now 🤡🤣
I find it ironic that your issue with Disney is the AI.
"Beer Bad" is not the episode of Buffy I'd pick as talking about the dangers of drugs. Look at Willow during the entire 6th season, instead.
6:45 Wargames? Is that really a good example of how USA/war/technology is awesome?
8:37 I like how you used the parody.
I like how the 'Rogue' "AI" has empty space between their ears.
Innovation creates new jobs while killing the old ones. Those who refuse to innovate....
Reminds me of on Futurama, Fry was dating an AI robot version of Lucy Liu
So when is pro VR gonna come into the picture?
What about WALL-E?
I didn't think the "Scan Your Likeness" in The Creator referred to just your physical appearance and morphological features but also involved a full neurological scan and mapping of your brain. That's just my take.
mattpatt in 2024 "DISNEY PUTS OUT PROPAGANDA!" Right wingers who have been saying that exact thing for the last 10 years: "we know....."
Tom Cruise should totally fight house prices.
Disney will never get another dime from me or my family!
A salute to Matpat
Tokyo debunker ad scared tf outta me 😭
Those hollywood scriptwriters are parasites they havent written a single good movies in the past few years i would much rather them be replaced by AI
I’m still getting adds for the army that make it look like a video game. I’ve been getting them since junior year of high school.
Just Disney? Haha
Matt..... uh....buddy.... how to break this to you.... Disney making propaganda isnt a theory... they've outright admitted to doing it over the last 4 years and have been doing it since WW2
The fall of the house of usher is definitely not trying to make AI look good, the end of the show makes this clear. We're also not really supposed to agree with any of the characters; they're all bad people... that's the whole point...
It's about who has the stro gest propaganda in the world America probably
yes we can be outraged, but to what extent will it really do anything? the corporations want it, Biden will go along with it,  and later the terminators will step on our skulls.
The Supreme Intelligence wasn't "benevolent", its the primary villain of the series. The fact that the Kree empire fell into ruin after the hero destroyed the AI is not pro-Ai, its anti-Ai. Its a warning about what happens if we become too dependent on AI.
They already got to the Chinese and Japanese.  'AI' = 'LOVE'
Why are you warning us of propaganda by using propaganda?
Mankind enslaved by AI? Small price to pay for replacing woke anime localizers with AI and give us more faithful translations.
And nowadays you do make a propaganda...
Disney used to make anti "woke" anti propaganda movies meant to make you think for yourself and learned you how to spot propaganda, indoctrination and manipulation. Now they Disney is nothing but woke propaganda and indoctrination...
critical thinking with a healthy sprinkle of cynicism is my defence to 'propaganda' - works pretty well.  Also i don't watch many movies/tv.
Good❤
Good

Thankyou to good mi timebucks
15:19 You can always tell when a piece of "artwork" is ai. Anyone else immediately notice the five fingers? There's always something off about an ai image that tells you it isn't art. I hate that we have to look out for these things now
I can confirm it is true. They are creating propaganda movies, I can name one. Turning Red is a communist propaganda film used to brainwash children but also to Canadians in communist Canada. Prime dictator Justine Turdeau openly admitted that not only it's his favorite movie but he openly admires basic Chinese dictatorship. But it is also grooming children, only sexualizing them but teaching them bad values to be disrespectful to parents. They're trying to use allegory of period to "normalize" a child friendly film but it is not only largely inappropriate it's a form of grooming. That's Hollyweird for you that's how they create their own propaganda.
M I C K E Y M O U S E  Mickey Mouse! (Mickey Mouse!)  Will set the people free!
Thank you for warning us I didn’t pick up on this
your not wrong one propaganda i know of is the tv series glee that pushed social norms to be accepted.
I will get 1 like for every like on this comment
My favorite Disney robot movies are Wall-E and Big Hero 6.
SAG did what now?? What was that little woke protest about then??? 😂
guess im not making that story about friendly robots after all, matpat truly saving me from not procrastinating
It's not just AI, they're pushing transhumanism in general. AI is an essential part of transhumanism, but it's just the first step towards humans merging with and eventually becoming immortal machines (in their narrative anyway, which I do not endorse at all, but I can see how it is compelling to many people).
I just straight up watched an entire 18 and a half minutes video of a guy saying:  "Movies have messaging" 🤯🤯
Of course, a Leftoid from California won’t mention the real propaganda Disney and the rest of Hollywood has been pushing. You know LGBTPEDOABC and miscegenation propaganda.
6:02 Disgusting. That’s your average fatherless Leftoid.
bbbb burgle (burgle is a character in the game grounded he is a friendly robot that asks you to retrive its memory chips so it can figer out ho to rebigify you because youre small)
I feel like that countdown until his last video is so dystopian the way the present it to us
I've been pro "sentient robot AI" for as long as I can remember, if we truly reach a point where we live among sentient non-biological beings we should absolutely treat them with respect and kindness. So in that regard I stand behind the message in The Creator, but when it comes to donating your "likeness" and to our real world happenings of removing humans from the media and entertainment business I am seriously alarmed.  If anything, we should aim for AIs to rid humans of manual, taxing labor so we can more focus on the creative and expressive side of life, instead of overexerting our bodies just to have food on the table.  Regarding The Marvels (I had no clue it had even come out until I saw it had appeared on Disney+ yesterday), the entire plot that destroying the AI led Hala into damnation was incredibly bad. It was laughable that the Kree lost their water, sun and atmosphere simply because no one told them how to act. It wasn't like the Kree were mindless beings uncapable of their own actions, as they clearly could figure out grand schemes to re-establish what had been lost 😅🤣
One more big controversy before you go, go on mat
This is gonna be end
Biden didn't have any thoughts about Mission Impossible, and even that would be a very low bar. He can't even remember when he was a senator. His team saw the movie and had thoughts about it and drafted the order and told him to sign it. Let's go brandon.
this isn't a theory, it's just obvious
Bro matpat has to be on like a watch list for disney because of these videos
FREE PALESTINE
Matpat tryna be relatable while filming in his multi million dollar mansion
globalists and globes....try to watch just about anything american without seeing a globe u cant.  🤔
The deep fake Indiana Jones was so blatantly obvious it took me out of the zone idk how people can say it was seamless
Don't make the mistake that everything in the USA is peachy pink, we got frontal attacks from all angles.
No way! classic intro
You know we're in trouble when politicians rely on science fiction to make decisions.
Garfield you're not immune to propaganda  même
It's apparent, LGBT and left-leaning propaganda is rampant now. Although I disagree with Desantis reason for taxing them, they deserve to be taxed like any other business in the US.
Its kinda less of a theory and more of a fact
Disappointed just glossed over how Disney biggest propaganda purpose is to support the left Democratic party and please George soros and how deep it goes into the new world order missed the mark big time here.
This is propaganda!
Duh.
Biden and the Dems (and of course Republicans) both have no interest in helping with home stuff or anything for average Americans. Don't pretend otherwise lol.
I’ll miss you MatPat
tbh I am more bothered by the race swap\lgbt propaganda than AI propaganda
Or maybe fight the healthcare system of the USA
Matpat need to make a new theory about the Walten files🗣️
I don't ever want to speak negativity on anyone but there are two types of veterans. The ones who regret falling for the propaganda and the ones who have willful ignorance of it. It hurts to see both.
Who doesn't know that yet?
What if, hear me out. We have ai redo all Disney content so it doesn’t belong to Disney. Make them hate what they want us to like.
15:00 And the original books which I, Robot were based on (which are much better than the movies) almost always feature robots and ai that are good for humanity, and the antagonists are almost always the humans themselves.
The thing is, I'm already extremely pro-ai, but all of this propaganda will only make me reconsider, because I am extremely anti establishment. If the establishment is promoting it, then you should be wary.
Just because bad people like AI, doesn't mean AI is bad.
now i know why matpat leave internet😅
Finally, a comprehensive, Alzeimers-friendly breakdown even Biden can un-durr-stand. Now...if only it came with a picture book or coloring book for the ol' fella.
Gotta say, AI being the ones getting to create art while humans working conditions crumble is the opposite of the vision I had for advancing technology
Hey matpat i think u should try to learn about the American and Israeli propaganda about the poor Palestine people. Please. Please. Please Look in to it. It's really big just look and see what u find .thanks❤
This is a demonstrable fact.
I think ai could be really good for us as a society, it could lower costs of things like movies, games, shows and books making them much easier to get a hold of. It could also cut costs making it that companies could spend this extra money in other areas to improve them. But we should not accept it if companies use AI to make it cheaper for them and not improve their products or make their products cheaper.
Good
I want very like post
💪
You’re making your farewell that much harder with the classic film theory intro…
Can you please do an episode on hazbin hotel
Y'all saying the old intro bringing nostalgia etc don't seem to realize none of this is matpat.. it's all AI generated, the script, the visuals, the voice, everything
Cha-Ching! Fallout 4 reference! 4:40
. . . I'm about to fight some corporate heads for this, anyone wanna join me?  There's no way that this is right, and by that I mean ethical. Artists, Game designers, Voice Actors, Visual Actors, Authors, ect. could all be put out of a job or be denied a job due to this. That's a LOT of people you're putting out of a job thanks to switching to ai.
The pure joy I got from seeing the old intros on these videos is insane-
Pomni real name started with an a
I'm with UNATCO, start talking.
I will never trust AI. They can't make me. I may love Transformers, but AI is for sure a Decepticon.
Disney keeps making bombs they must be getting paid by the CIA
3:43 except they werent a win.  Right after the strikes the union agreed to an opt in deal where studios can use the voices of actors that opted in as long as the union gets a cut.  Completely stabbing their members in the back. 17:24 as usual every time i correct you, you get there.
Um, actually the AI plotline in House of Usher (spoilers ahead) is there to represent Madeleine's attempt to cheat the Crow. To live forever. She is investing in that just to not die. Plus, it's a freaking villain creating the AI. So I don't think this would paint that good of a picture for it...  Not defending Netflix here, just House of Usher.
All this AI usage disgust me beyond comprehension
Thank you for never changing. Your channel has been legendary.
Who doesn't making propaganda?
How is it a theory that a huge company wants to influence the public 💀
LOL. You are saying you don't want to influence us and then you shove this "Big corporations are pushing positive view of AI against our interests." to us. :D That is a very VERY propaganda way of simplifying what is going on.  One could say historically big and powerful coprorations/governments are against the development of new and disruptive technology, because the people that have power tend to not like new and unpredictable technology messing things up. Generative AI has the possibility to shake up the power balance between people with power and those without.   That is pretty much the reason powerful social media figures are rallying against tools that can possibly give the regular folks a chance. The logical aim from the powerful is to make the majority of people scared of these tools until the powerful learn to use them effectively (to the detriment of a lot of others).  Just an alternative view to you. The truth is often time complex, different extremes are true at the same time. There are aspects of truth in your view, but it reads a lot like propaganda to support the powerful guys. :D
(;900+100=1000❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Based MatPat
Awesome
Marvelous
I so this thing is great
8:37 The ERB clip for Michael Bay is hilarious! Well done!
A.I. is only a threat to formulation content.  I look forward to "alternative" entertainment that will become popular once the cookie cuter content gets old.  It's already happening.
For a guy who talks this fast, he says a lot of nothing.
Great video. I think the best way to know AI is to use it. It's really easy to spot once you've made it yourself.  It's no panacea of human creativity but like any tool it's a force multiplier and can help you do absolutely amazing things. One of my favorites is voice replication and combination. You're taking several voices and synthesizing a new voice out of them. The crazy stuff you can do with that is kind of scary. It's also really easy to cross legal boundaries though. You have to be very careful how you use it to avoid getting sued.  In my explorations, using it with consent of the talent to fix dialog or avoid re-shoots with the technique is a huge work saver. Not everybody consents so you're kind of stuck there. But with the synthesis, you can create a nearly infinite variety of character voices. Even things like aliens, elder gods, backwards english, anything unimagineable adding abyssal textures to the training. It's wild.
Disney is satanic. Romans 10:9
Ask them to splash some rain on a 3 year old skyscraper in china
am i to old if i remember that worker went on trike becouse robots would replace people in automotive factorys among others, here we have it again where writers and artists go on strike becouse thair jobs may be effected.
Propaganda started well before WWII. It started in the 1920s with Edward Bernays the "father" of propaganda.
Or yknow, all the droids in Star Wars for years?
China is asshoe
Went the whole video re Disney propaganda and didn't mention their LGBTQ2+ propaganda 🙄
I mean..  It's why most people dislike Disney now. It's not entertainment anymore.
biden is not the elected president
Not all the anti-woke grifters being mad that MatPat didn't talk about non-issues like Disney including LGBT and POC characters in their media. No matter what you wanna believe, it's not propaganda. Stay mad folks 😘
9:55 Woah hey wait a minute you can't throw the Martian under the bus like that. It was written into the book like that as it was the only hope of saving the main characters life. You could argue they were able to make the movie due to the pro china portion but you can't say they JUST put that in there to be pro china. It was already in the story as space is a hard frontier to write for AND the writer, Andy Weir, was as scientifically accurate as he could be for the book. I don't mean to be "that guy" in the comment section but I LOVED the book and was ecstatic when it became a movie. I even wrote a paper on it in high school, one of the few I actually got a good grade on.
I'll be real with you, Matt, that "updated for the times" military ad, made no one want to sign up for service.
Yes boom i just saved you 11 minutes😎
That anime Gate was supposedly JDF propaganda. "Join the JDF, get a waifu"
😅 With Vids like this not surprised that he's on so many watch list right now from around the🗺️world Cuz of how brilliant MatPat is
Would be cool if house prices were down more affordable
"HOUSING PRICES" LOL YES
the only propaganda im getting is that money talks and the US army ain't as rich as China
3:53 no... Just... Why? First Microsoft invested in what society knew should not be invested in, 2nd Facebook propels Nvidia stocks to the point where Nvidia no longer considers itself a gaming company and is transforming itself into our worst nightmare, AI company straight up, and now Disney wants to pass it off as a good thing? How do they live with themselves?
Before u leave pleaseeee do a hazbin hotel theory first season is out on prime!!❤❤ me and my bf love
👍👍👍👍
👍👍👍👍
👍
TRANSFORMERS MENTIONED RISE UP TRANSFORMERS FANS
Nice work
We don't have AGI though, we essentially have a mirror... if we fear it, we will poison it because it is copying us and so will fear us, and just like us, it will try to destroy that which it fears.  So fear not, and fearmonger not. Lest ye be feared and destroyed. Dipshit.  Its the prisoner's dilemma.
I trust our future robot overlords more than I trust Disney
The thing about propaganda is that it always works, whether or not you're aware of it. That's why it's so insidious. The only way to fight it is to absolutely refuse to expose yourself to it as much as possible.
Yea, the Martian, but it was also in the book, so that one was baked into the story. I SUPPOSE the author could have been self-aware enough that it was intentional, but considering the story of how he wrote it, seems unlikely that it was about Chinese promotion.
man i just watched his intro and dahm nostailgia
And they always ALWAYS have
Bro, imho Creator was so mid that I was even a bit surprised
6:21 Knowing really is half the battle. As Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese philosopher, said :  "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
The ai is too high pitch
Just used this video as a reference in one of my university classes
Propaganda? Let me take a proper gander at you
yesss old intro!!!!
As a PC Scientist (Computer Scientist to clarify), I am always sketchy on Advance A.I. Diagnostics, and Implementations. I feel, if we had a moral balance of jobs for us first and put A.I. in more dangerous Jobs when humans cannot go in for that job, I'd be okay with it. I'd feel better as well, if, and only if, A.I. in general, was put on limiters and not able to question or take dangerous orders or questions from Humanity to heart.   *Also, ironically, I got an ad from Disney on this Film Theory episode about Gargoyle's, haha.*
I love you Matt, but you make it sound like it's bad being pro American. I know that is not what you mean, but.
We are fed up with this bullsh*t!! We need our entertainment back NOW!
Even after 4 mintues into the video, he is still talking about AI.  He is not talking about Disney doing propaganda.  Forget AI, even without that...Disney is already doing propaganda for Far Left antifamily LGBTQ values , inserted in almost every movie and TV show they make nowadays. IT ISN'T ABOUT AI.  This video i gave a thumbs down to, because I DON'T CARE ABOUT AI.  I care about Disney being proven to be a Far Left propaganda machine that is unsafe for kids and Geeks like us, to enjoy their movies and shows, anymore.
Just watching Pluto, that is retelling of Astro boy published on Netflix.  So it is an older story but fits into this theory.
The AI commentary in Fall of the House of Usher was there to build the characters into unlikable monsters who died horrible, often hilarious deaths.  She is later mummified in a callback to this scene.   So... not entirely sure you know what propaganda means.
I guess we know that Film Theory doesn't make too much of their money in China, 😂
Anyone who thinks AI is bad is delusional. And if Disney is pushing any propaganda it’s the woke BS.
They push  the "A.I. is Good" agenda because of... MONEY! GREED!
Old intro back for one more time
MapPat is immune to being woke!
When A.I. can awesomesauce I'm in
Tom Cruise is too busy being in a cult to do anything lol
Matpat, matpat, matpat, you can do better. Don't get me wrong I love your videos, but this feels like cowardice. What? You don't want to talk about the woke propaganda that litters their movies now? I know why that it. It is because you either don't call it propaganda because you agree with it, or you are too afraid of the demonetization or public backlash that comes with calling it propaganda.
Really feels like you're cherry picking. There have always been movies where AI is good and movies where AI is bad. I'd have to see some data to conclude that the mix is changing.
Please for the love of god save housing prices
6:19 That girl never seemed real to me.
It's hilarious how the whole video missed the real propaganda from Disney, makes me wonder if the video itself isn't propaganda ? Thanks for the laughs though
In its January Mortgage Finance Forecast, the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts that mortgage rates will fall from 6.9% in the first quarter of 2024 to 6.1% by the fourth quarter. The industry group expects rates will fall below the 6% threshold in the first quarter of 2025. ty Mr. president
Taking in information, training on it, and spitting out an “original” is literally what our brains do, how can it be illegal for A.I.?
Please make a Hazbin hotel theory
I'm so grateful to a high school buddy of mine who(back in the 90's) presented me with evidence that disney was perverted & crooked.  Our group of friends decided right then & there we would boycott everything disney no matter how popular any of their productions became.  When My friends became fathers, they would not allow their children to watch anything from disney.  I even broke up with a lady I was dating when I found out how much she still LOVED disney even after presenting her with the same evidence that my friend from H.S. has presented to me back in the day, plus more.  As always, You done a Great job, Matt!  I will sincerely miss You & Your videos.
This video is the real reason he’s leaving. Disney gave him a choice. Walk away, or be replaced.
I’m not sure how I feel about this. Hmmm, what does Taylor Swift think about it. How ever she feels is how I’ll feel.
You finally brought back the theme song
As an aspiring german voice actor, AI is incredibly scary
So disney just purchase epic 😂
In 2024 we boycott Disney
the creator is full Chinese propaganda
It funny how disney want their posters to be ai but, they want others to not do ai disney posters...
Videos like this are why we are really gonna miss MatPat.
what about blade runner?
I'm very happy that a big ytber mentioned tron, its one of my favorite movies
Their agenda is to make you believe ai is god. It’s predicted in the Bible giving the dragon a voice
5:54 Ads like these are an EMBARASSMENT compared to how masculine and efficiency-based the original US army and it's ads used to be. This ad is nothing short of lgbtq propaganda itself and pushes the falsehood that they're somehow victims. What's even more embarrassing is how this compares to China and Russia's military ads!
"President" Biden was installed since the 2020 election was massively rigged and he is nothing more than a puppet for the Obama administration and the usual CEOs/Soros-types. His executive orders are to suppress the truth! The average person on Facebook has proven to be more knowledgeable than any of that mainstream media garbage!
Disney also just bought 10% of Fortnite,
Disney has quite literally made WWII propaganda. Any major media company is by its nature trained to tell people what to think.
When you recommended a movie and tell us to watch it, please give a spoiler warning if you going to spill the story.
we need an MGS movie franchise
First one is Marines and they still use that type of recruiting videos. The Army has always focused on topics that would be approved of by parents (college, education, etc.) because statistically parents play a huge roll in whether a recruit joins the Army.
Indiana Jones and the Polar Express was great yea
3:36 why did they cross out "THE" and replace it with "this"
Does the matpat ai voice want a cuban sandwich
Now I see why MatPat never really made these kinds of major conspiracy theory topics. Just stick to small conspiracy stuff. This whole video is very cherry picked and very fearmongering. L theory
Without even watching the video I can answer this. Disney is making propaganda. Woke ideology is the reason we don't have good entertainment anymore. It's the reason all Star wars movies are now garbage because we have DEI dictating which characters are in which movies and which actors get what role based on the color of their skin and which genitals they have.
I LOVE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDS
I want to know what the other half of the battle is
Matgpt 😂😂
I can imagine it now mission impossible home invasion
Kinda surprised he completely overlooks woke identity politics garbage, which is the most pervasive social engineering being pushed across the board.
Your intro sucks
i hate disney
Everyone living in the east of the world: You just noticed?
🖕Disney
Video about propaganda, starts by fluffing Biden 😅
Has anyone seen AI Artificial Intelligence by Steven Spielberg in 2001? I kept thinking it would be brought up as an example,
Great video MatPat.
Yeah, this didn't need a video. It's a reality, not a theory.
Sorry but if your creative work is so bland and mediocre that a statistic tool can replace it then your work isn't worth the money sorry to say.
It's concerning how accurate the AI did pat pat
What a clickbait video lol
Can everyone agree Nazis are bad?
Its ALL propaganda.   The characters, the races of the characters.  The sexuality of the characters.  The themes. The talking points.   Etc etc.  I've given up on almost all modern movies. I've given up on almost all pop culture.   I've given up on all sports and music.  I fill my time with bonsai and gardening.   F*ck Disney.  F*ck all of this.
I can’t believe Megan wasn’t mentioned.
wait...could AI be pushing these stories out bc....wait a minute...
I feel a remake of A.I.: Artificial Intelligence coming REAL soon!!!!
The original film theory theme!!!!
The original film theory theme!!!!
Y’all think due to the deepfakes technology, when a actor or actress dies they will still get used because they’re “under contract" or they're agents will be able to negotiate for them to be used even if they are deceased ?
Even though as a film nerd I LOVED "The Creator", I agree with you about the concerning propaganda. However, I think you missed a BIG source of propaganda: the main propaganda of most children's films right now, including but not limited to Disney, is pushing LGBTQ stuff into all their movies in SOME way, reinforcing the way it's already the new "in" thing with young children. "I'm in the wrong body" -- AKA gender dysphoria, a mental illness -- is the new goth. And everyone's acting like it's okay. Most people don't really care about adults who are LGBTQ in some way. Fine, live your life, you do you. But it IS in fact propaganda to try to TELL us what to think, and to tell our children that the coolest thing they can be is mentally ill or in a relationship where they can never have children. And that they should _want_ to be that, and change themselves to BE that. That's not healthy or helpful for society.
4:18 OK I just restarted my phone
00:00 🎬 President Biden's executive order on AI regulation was influenced by the portrayal of rogue AI in the latest Mission Impossible movie. 01:23 🎨 Generative AI, such as Dall-E and Mid Journey, can create content like images and text based on given prompts, sparking controversy over originality. 03:05 📽 Hollywood's use of generative AI is causing a rift between studios seeking cost-saving measures and artists concerned about job security, leading to recent strikes. 04:18 💼 Propaganda campaigns from Hollywood studios, notably Disney, aim to shape public perception of AI as beneficial, influencing narratives in films and TV shows. 05:41 📺 Propaganda in media has historically been used to promote specific causes or agendas, evolving over time to adapt to societal changes and technological advancements. 09:02 🌐 Global propaganda efforts extend beyond the U.S., with examples of Hollywood catering to the Chinese market by portraying China positively in films. 11:11 🤖 Recent films and TV shows, including Disney productions, depict AI in a positive light, aligning with corporate interests and potentially shaping public opinion. 14:04 🎞 Hollywood's portrayal of AI as friendly and relatable reflects broader societal discussions and advancements in technology, influencing public perception. 17:50 💡 Remaining critical of media propaganda and staying informed about technological developments is crucial in navigating societal changes and forming independent opinions.
Ya know the scary thing about a.i is not its intelligence, its the lack of morality
The Matrix series, get some injustice, ok for the video you can say that the machines were badies, but, if you watched the animatrix humans gave understanding and logic to the machines, and then they start to treat them like people always treat "differences". What happens, is that machines had the means to defend and overcome humans... and machines tryed several times to humans to get along with them. And dont forget, the entire plot of matrix, is machines give the chance to humans to became better, and live in sociaty with them... nothing is right, about slavery or near extinction, but the machines could extint humans from the begining, matrix 4 is about machines trying to live in sociaty with humans.  I know bad english but i need the experiance so... thx to endure
Pissney is literally of the devil as I proved in my playlist "Apple of the devil."
That's how they started, time is simply a flat circle 😆
I thought you are gonna say lgptq 😂 didn’t expect that
For housing prices in the Anglosphere, everyone in the comments join your local YIMBY action groups and stuff like Strong Towns! In the US it really is a local fight where every bit counts. Similar for Australia, Canada, and the rest of New Zealand (Auckland did good stuff to reduce prices).
Pro-China? LOL. What year is this?? It's now pro-India, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and anti-China
i recall the Eff Eriahn! mick e. mouse flyers and bumper stickers of the 80z.
Yeah, the current age of disney is woke social engineering, we knew this. Our military is failing to recruit because the sociall message our government puts out demonized the kind of people that wopuld want to join a military. All old news.
Let me refute this.  1) A friendly AI theme has existed for decades. - The entire Robot series of stories by Isaac Asimov is about good AI. - The whole premise of Short Circuit 1 and 2 is that of a robot who wants to exist and have the same rights as a human. - A good Terminator has been present in the second, third, fifth and sixth movies. - The leaders of both the resistance and the regime in Captain Power are AI (Mentor and Overmind, respectively) - The entire premise of Steven Spielberg's AI movie was an AI child who wants human rights - The same was true for the Bicentennial Man movie. - The main characters in the original Matrix trilogy were only successful because they were guided by a friendly AI (the Oracle), and peaceful AIs fighting for their right to exist were already present in Matrix Revolutions (Ramachandra, his wife Kamala, his daighter Sati)  2) In The Creator, the robots were a metaphor for the Taliban. - Who caused the incident that killed the most people in the shortest amount of time in the 20th century? The Taliban, on September 11, 2001. - Who did the USA fight ineffectively for decades, starting from the misconception that removing the enemy's will to fight (which can return) is more important than removing their life (which can't)? The Taliban. - Who is constantly being depicted as poor, misunderstood, only willing to exist, in mass media that constantly pretend to forget the crimes they committed so that the people will actually forget? The Taliban.
Video games can be made or broken by the voice acting quality within. AI-generated voices are going to trash so many games.
I really hope Wish was AI-generated, because the alternative is that Disney writers are so garbage now that we might as well give up on the entire company. You'll either get woke propaganda or garbage stories, sometimes both.
I just think about that late 90s Disney movie Smart House and that's how I feel AI actually is
Let me know a great artist that didn’t study other artists😂
I've made this comment a lot recently, but this is the time for everyone to start supporting independent creators. I can't imagine how empty life would have to be before I'd be interested in watching something written by an AI
here before MatPat's voice becomes AI generated in every video
I will do 1 pushup for every like i get on this comment 💪
OMG matpat the housing prices joke. crazy how hard that hit
I like the video and the message of be aware of ai propaganda but how do we fight back and keep human artists in art.
I welcome the AI overlords. They do a much better job at localization then the woke morons who think American's can't handle true Japanese anime or video games. The stuff we've been enjoying for years. I'll take the female Terminator from the 3rd movie as a wife too. She's strong, badass, and I don't have to worry about her cheating or divorcing me xD
Beautiful video! So true
Nobody should be surprised by the fact that a company whose catalogue is half COPaga and who donates millions of dollars to funding a genocide also wants you to think it's ok not to pay real people for their art.
I saw the title and got excited... This went diferently than what I expected.
Why are we trying so hard to make ourselves obsolete?!?!?
You know, even with us catching this pretty early, and it’s obviously gonna be told a lot. This will end up working in Disney’s favour. Unless there’s actual legislation, Disney and these massive companies will win in 10 years. That’s just what happens.
I think you're late to the party on noticing this. That being said, I know your channel is pretty high profile so thanks for covering it.
There’s literal propaganda on the news right now. Disney isn’t this smart
I don't think the AI shtick in The Fall of the House of Usher was 'a random plot point. That character in the glasses, was obsessed with living forever and felt inspired by the Ancient Egyptian burial rituals where the dead were 'prepared' for the afterlife and having read the Egyptian Book of the Dead myself this does add up. They would remove organs and include some food, money and alcohol to bribe the Gods to help them navigate the underworld. Anyway, its not random because the woman wants to live forever and AI would help her do that. The character also is very experienced in cutting edge AI tech, which she was also using to better improve the company she founded. There is evidence of AI propaganda but it wasn't a random inclusion to the plot, it was thought out and works thematically :)
6:01 Does it have to be a female though?
shouldnt you be gone already?
Even in the world of Streaming, there is one AI VTuber that is gained a huge following, Neuro-sama and her creator Vedal. Now she is hardly perfect and can be a bit unhinged at time. Vedal even has acknowledged this by giving Neuro a alter-ego. People at first were skeptical of her but over the years she has been accepted into the VTuber community, having collabs with some of the biggest VTuber's on YouTube and Twitch. And character story/lore is quite wild lol.
Man I was not ready to hear the old intro. Love it.
Took you long enough to catch up.
I like this video, but I don't think Ava is an antagonist in Ex Machina. Ava killing Nathan was pretty awesome, and she left Caleb behind because he lied to her.
Video 8 of asking film theory to do the ingen tapes
AI may steal from the past and the present but it can never steal the future if there is any.  It's created by humans and it ends with them.  It's only us who can innovate. Can AI innovate if it is only spoon fed?
The army stuff is disgusting propaganda, who would want to join the military when you're tell us about a woman with 2 moms,  kinda like everything Disney puts out now.
🐁🐁🐁🐁🐁🐭🐭🐭🐭
i sooooooo want him to make a vid about hazbin hotel
Alex bale made 2 months  ago a new video for don't feed the muse and it is insane I would love to see you one last time go back to the happy meat farm ARG and the don't feed the muse ARG Pls get this to the top comment matpat has to see this
Should do another episode over hazbin hotel . And helluva boss
I just stopped watching movies and shows. All I see is propaganda and get tired of seeing people “look passed it” while it still manipulates their views
my song "Destiny" is about AI and us fighting back! 🤘🏻
AI Generation is a welcome tool for the future. Rather than give corporations a monopoly, it will allow smaller creators the same ability to make blockbuster quality films. It's necessary for the future of entertainment.
That's not the only thing Disney (and media in general) is putting in to indoctrinat viewers, and unfortunately, children specifically. 😅
I don’t like AI and I don’t have any plans to like AI ever…
I would argue that any and all commercial art is, in fact, propaganda. It is the business of selling perspectives and the business with the most capital sells its perspective the most. Propaganda.
This propaganda doesn't "come and go in waves" my friend. It's always been here, admittedly it's been getting more egregious. Feminism is not a natural phenomenon, nor is this transexual epidemic (though at least there's chemicals at play there too).  You're soooo close to seeing through the veneer.  The big one is the israel question. Monsters Inc is about epstein island.
Monsoon was right Free will is a myth
You can't talk about modern propaganda without mentioning the repeal of the "Smith Mundt Act" in 2013. If you don't know what that is, give it a Google.
I think two movies that bombed don't really make a properganda shift to being positive about AI. Where 98% of movies and TV still show us a robots bad. Take for example every movie about a female robot companion and a human male. Every single one ends with the robot either killing or leaving the man. Dozens of movies just in the last few years alone
I want a full deep analysis on the back story of Lofi girl because there is a 8 second video named lofi gorl back story pls I need it mat
Hey can you check out hazbin hotel please as a last theory? Its finally done and I wanted your theorys and opinions ❤❤❤
My theory is that Walt Disney found out about something like Rocko's basilisk and said entity is what helped him build his empire in exchange for the propaganda. There are a bunch of other Disney films that featured A.I. in a good light: Flight of the Navigator, Big Hero 6, Ron's Gone Wrong, Wall-E, and I'm sure there's more I missed. Technically, Pinocchio is kind of an A.I. I do want to thank the theorists for pointing out the propaganda in movies. I was aware of it, but it's nice to be reminded that most of Hollywood wants us to think a certain way.
>Waah waah AI not original. >Me when I see people rip off the art of Disney and a bunch of other works and mixing and matching it together. 🤣  Get over yourselves. Most "artists" are very much not original.
hmmmm... they bend the knee to the movie starring the scientologist... NOTHING TO READ INTO THERE hey you know freemasonry is kind of like a cult when you really think about it.
Disney is cool and all but what about mikaeli hit the metal lore???
MATPAT PLEASE MAKE A HAZBIN HOTEL THEORY IM BEGGING YOU
Do a theory on riggy and danna draws they have lore you couldn't imagine more lore than the most lore you've done on a video
Me, who’s been writing a middle grade graphic novel series about FRIENDLY, A.I powered living dolls for several years now. 🙃
I feel like it might go a little deeper than saving money..considering Tesla and other major companies are dipping their toes in and actually manufacturing real robots..Disney and Hollywood's aren't the only ones that'll benefit from the public viewing AI I'm a more positive light.
İf dhmis 2 season releases im so sad that matpat cant make a vid abt it 😢
Disney changed owners during the last manufactured economic crisis, new owners who basically invented propaganda
It aint just disney making propaganda, its pretty much all films ever made, but lets just focus on the current punching bag and no one else.
We have known that for a long time now.
Blaze is the alien 👽 (Blaze and the monster machines)  nickelodeon us 🇺🇸

Nick jr deer squad is the worst 😫
Marvel is 100% propaganda. In the next Antman will have Sabra, captain Zionism.

Wouldn't it be a trip if they tried to do this with some kind of social movement? Like how wild would it be if they tried to erode a traditionally thrifty culture and supplanted it with an impulsive self gratifying one so they could sell more product.
can you make gang beasts lore
Donald Duck and Kanye be on the same team
We are the AI that destroys us.
Biden doesn’t do anything change my mind
The OG Intro!
Hey yo how why
Take some solace in the fact that this will backfire on Hollywood. As soon as every day people are equipped to make their own movies using AI technology, Hollywood will go out of business. I'm sure they'll try to influence regulation but we all know how that went during the war on drugs so..
The irony of Matpat talking about propaganda after Covid without having any sense of irony...
Pls make a hazbin hotel theory again there are more episodes
I hate AI, it should never exist to begin with
btw did u know that hazbin hotel just finished s1 maybe u should watch it
that countdown hit hard
So... Do we succumb, or watch EVERYONE ELSE succumb?
Every time he tells me to reboot my system, the video stops. How am I supposed to see the rest of the video after @4:19 ?
Do bfdi,bfdia,bfb,tpot.
………….. well Matt, I’m glad you see it now.
righ now skynet dont need to use terminators to conquest humanity,   skynet only needs  to make a  good charismatic and beatiful Android girls  not Woke, not pro LGBT  and would conquer all the men in the planet.
And we are STILL ignoring what a brain machine interface can do.
I loved your clip of Micheal Bay
May you please talk about Mr. Freeman.
please no matter what the analitics said, what you think, what happen in this world, do not change your intro jingle
Moral of the story don't let a robot run humanity 😯
If 2 out of 32 Disney movies in 2023 amounts to AI propaganda, what do you call the 32 out of 32 movies propping up DEI?  Oh wait, is it because you agree with DEI and therefore don't consider it propaganda?
Shouldn't military stuff be public domain, since it's funded by taxpayers?
@TheFilmTheorist please do another hazbin hotel video the show has bean officialy released on prime video
12:19
This is such a busy video style
There's no way Joe Biden watched a whole movie.  Grandad ain't got that kind of stamina.
Just get AI MatPat to do the rest of the episodes, problem solved.
Please make a theory about Fantastic Beast’ credence true origins 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
If using ai makes movie production cheap, the consumer should also get these things cheaper, but we won't 😢
13:22  Nobody:             Matpat: "little robot kid, somebody call in gregory" 💀
Talks about propaganda.  Then pushes us to watch the creator.  I'm good. Nice try
Do a Ninjago theory. Please. It would be perfect to do a video on. It has a lot of deep lore.
Wasn't the one commercial the marines NOT THE ARMY?
maybe the Marvels is really showing why it is bad to link your entire society to an AI! 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ I am team Battlestar Galactica remake; don't network machines that don't need to be networked.
knowing is HALF the battle but ACTION is the other half.   boycotts solidarity in community creating alternative using our feudal wages with leverage
this is why dystopian art that is NOT marketable is often more true.  we need REAL Critique of social norms and Especially anti-capitalist  critique.
You should do a theory about the conga sereis
the audience might be a "smart cookie" , but they are also half-baked.  😅
❤
It’s interesting because on a general level, propaganda is literally any movie or tv show, not just government agenda media. But still it’s clear Disney is making an agenda based movie often times, instead of just making quality entertainment for everyone. Now that I think about it, it seems that is why many critics have issues with Marvel and Star Wars, that they don’t want propaganda, they want a good MCU or Star Wars movie.
"You are not immune to propaganda." - Garfield
GUYS, THIS HAD TO COME BACK BUT REPLY TO THIS COMMENT OR LIKE IT TO PROVE WE DESURVE A HAZBIN HOTEL THEORY AGAIN, HE MADE A OLD ONE BASED ON THE 1 PILOT EPISODE AND NOW SEASON ONE IS OUT SO WE NEED ANOTHER HAZBIN HOTEL THEORY
I don't think those end-of-episode "Knowing is Half the Battle" things were propaganda. The entirety of GIJoe itself *was* propaganda, yes, but those end-of-episode sections were more safety PSAs. The focus was about things like escaping from burning buildings, not drowning, and not putting people inside refrigerators.
I love how real Mattpat is he ain't pulling no punches on the hypocrisy of this world lol
WHAT THE MATRIX OOOOOOOOOOOOO MY LIFE BEEEN FAKE A FFFFFAGE
Disney will always be on the side of the villian 😭😭😭
FOR THE LOVE OF LIFE PLASE DO A FILM THEORY ON ATTACK ON TITANS ENDING WE NEED IT
Pretty sure it's beyond theory and is just verifiable fact now.
I don´t think Disney's method of influency anything is not really working lately
Propaganda. That's when an Englishman has a really good look at something.
Shorts Wars S2?
AI is AIDS
It took you 80 years to come to the conclusion that informaton is designed to manipulate you? Since WWII it's been in full tilt gear. It's nothing new kid.
Do 1 about hazbin hotel
Will we get AI MatPat voiceover in future videos?? 😂
do a theory on hazbin hotel the full 1st season has came out theres proof of redemption mybe you could predict season 2 or theorize if alistor is evil or not
Hey matpat maybe you can do a theory on why robots in movies have human hands? Maybe other things have better hands than humans?
AI MatPat sounds like Bill Cipher
MatPat, for one of your final film theories, I think you should do Angel Hare, I think you would really enjoy it!
who would magic work in Harry Potter
AI is not the only thing Disney is propagandizing. Disney would love to be in complete control of how people interact socially, especially in regards to race and gender. May the mouse wither and burn.
Gee you dont say, Conservatives and ""Conspiracy"" Theorists have been saying this for decades
I told a channel I would tell you this.Danno draws told you tube that he almost broke down in Disney world because of you leaving and that you are his biggest hero.Go check it out please for his and my sake
I had to stop watching this video as soon as it claimed "WarGames" was anti-soviet propaganda. The whole film is about the dangers of not only nuclear war, but loosing your humanity to rigid mechanical thinking, leading to your destruction.
It didn’t set in that your gonna be gone till the old school intro started playing and I can’t thank you enough for being a big part of my life man. I’ve enjoyed every video you’ve made. Your ability to tell a story and just be real is brilliant. This video was an eye opener to something I already knew about but didn’t notice the details in such a way. These next video you have left will be bittersweet.
You should make a theory about lo fi girl.
Didn't Theodor Adorno write about this in 1944?
MATPAT MAKE A HAZBIN HOTEL VIDEO!!! I NEED TO KNOW THE LORE!!! Pretty please...?
I think the more interesting question is: How effective is this propaganda in making people accept AI as a good thing? Just like humans, I’ve always thought of AI as having the capacity for good or bad and I doubt any amount of media would shift my beliefs solely to one side or the other (I blame my love of Star Wars, which features both good and bad robots 🙂). How many minds does that one incredibly forced line in The Fall of the House of Usher change to pro-AI? While good for the Kree specifically, how many people actually thought that the Supreme Intelligence (the AI that was insistent on the genocide of a rival alien race in 2019’s Captain Marvel) deserved to live? (Tangentially, why didn’t the Kree just move to another planet like they forced the Skrulls to?) The answer to my original question is something I don’t really want, as it would inform companies on how to better create or aim their propaganda. I just feel this specific issue doesn’t matter because of how pathetic the attempt is.  But yes, love that the classic intro has made a return! 😁
Did you not hear about the Japanese scientists who got killed because they were testing militant AI? They had to shut them down, and one of them actually rebooted itself. AI may be able to be benevolent, bit that is not how some of it is being tested and or applied. I almost forgot about the robotic dogs China used or is still using to control their population. Propaganda, whether for good or evil, is a bad idea.
It took you this long to figure out Disney's been making propaganda...?
You're 100% incorrect about the reference in Fall of the House of Usher. If you watch to the end, Lenore's 'AI' bot is buggy and just repeats Nevermore. And it's done in a way to make it explicit that Lenore is in fact dead and gone. There's absolutely no positive connotations past that one scene where the villain tries to convince the girl that 'it IS cool'.   Don't selectively edit your criticisms.
Thank you and your team for this, these a lot of thoughts I've  contemplated   Edit: Except for what you've extrapolated after your introduction. Not the film theory intro, but your actual intro
I am Tom Cruise
It's all fun and games until you have to sit through rapid-fire sequels of Jason Statham promoting the Chinese tourist industry.
The nostalgia from the old intro hit really deep just now-
I'll miss you
I just got a idea of one of those influnce things the "foreneners"(typicaly american looking) in manwhas  Also the funny thing of "teams":this was done with ai
Disney is Making Propaganda, In other news, water wet.
I think deep fakes are fine they just need the person's concent.
You hate Disney propaganda because it promotes "woke-ist culture war agenda."  I hate Disney propaganda because it enforces the current capitalist tyranny, while weaponizing minority rights in order to maximize profits, and forcing workers into unspeakable working conditions.  We're not the same.
A.I. is a threat. It will eventually assimilate or destroy us.
I disagree with the point that was made about the Fall of the House of Usher. The payoff to the reference AI avatar was meant to call out how scary it is. I won’t give the ending away but it’s extremely messed up.
U saw what's happening to our boy Mickey Mouse MatMat that " Mickey's Mouse Trap" new horror Mouse
The old intro stopped be DEAD in my tracks! I had to just.... stop and take it in... it's been AGES since I'd seen it. Thank you MatPat
...
Man forgot to mention all the LGBTQ propaganda in current everything 😂😅
Disney making propaganda shocking!
This video is making me realise that "Detroit: Become Human" was far ahead of its time.
Nice to hear your sexy voice again 😢😂
Lol I'm not sure that Disney making propaganda is a "theory"
Thanks for everything matpat
YOOOOOOO THE OG INTROOOOOOOO
I'm not against AI with-in movies or shows when used right, examples are keeping characters young or old filling the background, imagine Harry Potter or Stranger Things with a cast that aged properly
If you really think about it, I don’t think it’s AI. It’s politics. They are already pushing the democratic agenda, satanist propaganda, anti-Christian propaganda, and there is even a whole movie based solely on the fact that men and women do not need each other and that men are oppressive. (I know it’s not Disney, but the political propaganda is everywhere, I could list a thousand more examples)
I think that the answer is to simply not go to the movies or watch any new movies at home. Let's face it, movies are terrible now. Just bad, bland, uninteresting and sadly...full of propaganda.
It sounds like propaganda...written by AI. Which wouldn't shock me at all.
Please dont leave me
oh wow i had to do a double take on the release date cause of the intro
Weird how captain America was made in 1941 and copyright laws last 70 years I think. They made the film for him in 2011. And in the same year the original creator Joe Simon died. Had no idea it was from world war 2. I think the copyright was an issue in court at some point. Not sure about the result. I think some law that allowed companies sold the original copyright for 56 years to retain it afterwards.
So you've got AIDS (AI Derangement Syndrome) and you're talking about Disney spreading propaganda? The irony.
You should do a theory on escape the night
Make a vid on UTTP
Can u pls make a theory of hazbin hotel?
Hey. Wanna do a theory on the new wonka movie? Idk what about but if u watch it you'll find something.
An incredibly insightful joke that I first heard as a teenager some time between the Fall of the Berlin Wall and Yeltsin's vodka-soaked shenanigans: The only real difference between a Russian and an American, is that a Russian knows propaganda when he sees it.  Now that you've made a video about propaganda and used The Creator as an example, you really, really, REALLY, need to go back and re-watch it.  I'm not saying your interpretation is right or wrong, I'm saying that the film is far deeper than it seems and that you've fallen into a trap by not looking beyond surface level. You're not alone since I've also seen people complain that NOMAD is just a lazy America Bad commentary on the US' habit of making drone strikes wherever it likes.  The Creator is a film ABOUT propaganda, and it's done in the same philosophical context as the incredibly under-rated Mrs. Davis that nobody watched last year.   Every single thing that happens in The Creator (except the WTFctopus robot), is a direct or indirect result of propaganda, including the catalyzing event that created the world the story takes place in. EVERYTHING. Without spoiling anything, multiple characters, including Taylor, have arcs that revolve around the lies they've been fed and the false beliefs they'd held. This isn't just the Americans, either, because the Sims are lying about things as well.  Re-watch the film with propaganda at the forefront of your mind but instead of taking a couple of plot points in isolation to demonstrate how it's pushing a specific agenda, pay attention to how propaganda shapes the entire world the film exists in.
Mat pat please for one of your last theories can you do a hasbin hotel theory
AI MattPat sounds like Ben Shapiro 😂
i love the use of dark side of the moon when referencing music
I hope film theory with cover Hazbin Hotel again
Can’t wait for the new civil war movie to come out in a few weeks where the southern states got to war with the rest of the USA🤣
theory Scooby-Doo is a breed of a Great Dane and Dalmatian
Hopefully you do Ninjago because i think it has some Lord in it and the little bad kid his name is Lloyd the aon of garmadon
Is there any way you’ll be able to do the blacklist? And answer the question who is Raymond Reddington please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
He has to be making one about hazbin hotel
I've been waiting for this.  Let's discuss Regulations. Typically with newer technologies, there's a lot of caution, warnings, and liability waivers that need to be agreed to. New movies have content ratings. New games and websites are released with terms of use. There are explicit warnings upfront and direct statements and waivers having to be signed for the acquirement of these technologies. What did this ChatGPT have? It was given to the general public free to use, no agreements upon signup, no warnings at the start of a conversation, and they'll only bother telling you how they shouldn't be used AFTER you already try. Not to mention the Jailbreak Prompts circulating the internet, which entirely bypass these regards as a whole. Rather than stating ChatGPT was not a reliable source for information gathering, it suggested its responses "might not always be accurate," and instead of bothering to consider the potential misuse in storytelling as replacing authors and how this would damage the heart of a work created with contextual understanding of the world through senses.  I'll leave it at that, but I have plenty more to share with the world through the humanity of artificial systems, the misuse of this technology in a variety of fields, and the nature of knowledge and understanding as a whole. If anyone entertains these ideas, I'd be happy to share them.
@film theory i know you will maybe never see this till you leave but can you or when you leave can your team make a theory on the movie/book Holes it has so much lore and i feel like you will like it alot and also you raised me when my parents didn't and you made me the perosn who i am today you raised me not my parents.
PleeeeeeAaaaaaase if you’re reading this do a theory on cheesyhfj’s one you only have 7 theories left and it’s been a life long dream to see an osc creation on here,                                    I thank you for everything
Hey ,can you please do a theory on Hamilton
He should do a theory on hazbin hotel
Should definitely do a hazbin hotel theory now that its first season is finally out
Takes over half the video to start making the point; and it a pretty weak point. You can only show a handful of the so called 'propaganda', where's it's likely just film-makers cashing in on public interest. Disney is using more and more generative computer content because it's cheap, and they know they'll get you used to it through exposure, simple as that.
MatPat I have a Film Theory Idea : What is the Charmen Ultra Strong Lore,( because there is the red bear family and blue bear family )
There is and will always be a problem with AI. It's not that it takes jobs from humans. That problem can be fixed quite easily. The problem is that it caters to the masses. This means that it will have a hard time to create something new and thus the masses get bored of it.
hasnt their last few movies been box office flops??
So matpat is joining the "common sense" side ? nice ! love the direction you're taking, the RIGHT one..
So Matpat is joining the "common sense" side ? nice ! love the direction you're taking, the RIGHT one..
I missed the into so much I’m glad you brought it back for the time we have left
Fk'em, the only thing we need to do with AI is secure access for everyone (and not let it take over the internet). The entire high-end specialized economy we have now was created by shafting the previous low-end labor manufacturing economy, just ask Middle America. Now it's time for the desk job economy to get toppled by AI labor.   Just adapt bois, AI will give individuals and small teams a mid-sized studio's worth of resources, allowing them to compete with larger organizations and produce their own content. No longer will you have to settle for the ever crapy Netflix adaptation, you now have the AI adaptation at home. But maybe this is not good for this channel, and that is also propaganda.
You guys should do a piece on The Overton Window. It's basically an extension of propaganda , moreso the endgoal of propaganda, the entire journey of the trail.
This this YouTube channel called I can’t sleep it’s very creepy and I think this a story behind it
Imma miss Matpat
You should do another hazbin hotel the official show is on prime video there is a lot to cover
I wonder if Matt would put another hazbin hotel theory since season 1 is out on prime of not it is what it is
can you do a new thories on hazib hotal? like the ackule serise? (by the way it is not for the younger adince soo there will be a lot of editing if you use any in show clips)
i teared up when i saw the old intro ngl
Former mouse ear lol…. Steamboat on the free domain
Thank you matpat
I’ll always think Terminator when I think AI
they've gone corporate! no one will be able to stop them now
Matpad if you know babar the king of the elephant I have a question where is Celestevill
15:47 This is more a case of 3d insert than AI.
I like to imagine that one push for AI good now is also because the bad AI is because the standard so people more or less try to push against.
Gotta watch the ones with him now before the channel dies with his departure.
Whuuuuuuuaaaa?? Disney spewing out propaganda? YOU DON'T SAY!!??
Please watch I can’t sleep
Now we finally have a full series of 'Hazbin Hotel', could we get a new theory on it??  A theory focused on the Radio Demon 'ALASTOR' would be amazing 😁😁😁
I want a AU of Adam and eve don't eat the apple
Matpat, can you make a theory about "Lost Media"?  Plzz:D
Do a hazbin hotel theory pleasr
"ask any 90's or 2000's kid about the weird ads that the Army created to appeal to the most leet, extreme gamers" *shows a MARINE CORPS ad* Me, having spent 4 years playing with Marines and seeing someone call them "Army": AngryMichaelScott.gif
who else is waiting on *hazbin hotel* theory :D
Do a theory on Gavin hotel pleaee
Can you play kinito pet
Why do people beg for likes do you get money or something idk about because there’s a lot of people doing it
People are probably gonna make AI covers of future game theory videos with MatPat's voice to still feel like he's making videos after he retires.
Wait didn't Matt say goodbye to yt?
I noticed the 180 shift. It creeped me out.
I don't support Disney they also have lots of other propaganda and always have
Didn't expect a lesson on AI. I love this channel!
Thanks for covering this all-too-important issue, MatPat (and Team)!  I think one of the best things to remember in situations like these (where it can be easy to feel helpless) is that as consumers, our buying decisions not only matter, they're vital.  We outnumber the corporations so that means our opinions and desires DO matter.  Never forget that, Folks.
Can you make a video of why Nickelodeon chose Spongebob Squarepants While the rest like my life as a teenage robot're replaced by only Spongebob The answer is still unknown but I believe Spongebob is a tyrant
What happened to him doing another hazbin hotel theory when the series came out.
There should be a theory on Good Omens!
They brought back the old intro!!!
no one is immune to propaganda
mat Pat, why are you quitting game theory? I'm thankful I will always one number, your fun at the theories, but my question is, why are you quitting
I just watched the creator and it was really good
Ai matpat as host
The old intro hit a little to close to home
Hold on I had to process the intro wow
Hello MatPat can you make a theory for your last 7 theries or   in the future can you make a theory about spongebob posible not being a sponge because in the scene Thats not my wallet they are electrocuted and you can see there BONES!!
Gotta do a SMG4 theory MatPat, that will be cool.
the fall of the house of usher actually paints the AI  in a bad way. By the end, it’s just an empty and ego driven obsession that ends up malfunctioning and causing pain.
That's cool and all, but what does Adobe Illustrator have against us?
God these bot comments are so dam infuriating
The Creator movie sucked. It was basic, disjointed and had super blatant parallels with racist cliches. Effects were very good, I'll admit.
They are, lgbt propaganda
Yep! And they’ve been doing it for a long time.
Also pushing LGBT propaganda onto children in the US while censoring anything LGBT in China and the Middle East.
Film theory idea: how many calories did forrest gump burn when he ran around the world
I “ai” ai, don’t you?
If you actually understand Ai, you’d know it’s only dangerous in the wrong hands. Just like any other powerful tool.
Oh, this isn´t about woke propaganda? lol...
I watched a story about a little boy who had his genitals removed by a US medically licensed doctor, without his parents permission, before heading to work past three homeless encampments and thought to myself, "at least I don't speak German".
everyone comment to boost the algorithm
Pls do another community theory
Very good presentation.
This isn’t a theory lol is this reality lol
"...and as always, my friends, I'll see you next week" But, it's not 'as always', is it Matpat? ... is it? 😢
Yo mat pat, can you finish theorizing the Mandela catalog?
CA.NN U MAKE SOMETHING WITH HAZBIN HOTEL
Mouse Liberation Front
But this isn't just a theory the war has already been started I'm a artist, writer and graphic designer I'm trying to do freelance jobs from last year but had no luck so far because every job I try to take is already been taken by the AI users who are frauds they claim that their work is authentic not an ai and making thousands of dollars while people like me are getting no jobs and this is just a start. Because these big corps wants to normalize it in every field they can so they can save money and increase their profit.   We need to rise up together and force govs and freelance companies to ban AI work.
I don't know if this is related but at school we are told that understanding the question is half the answer
Can you do a theory on the official hazbin hotel series!
It's been a bit since I read the martian, and I read it most recently not watched the movie, but I remember that being accurate of the book so unless they ham it up making it a lot bigger than it was in the book, I don't really see that being propaganda.
No our overlords are supposed to be apes and monkeys and gorillas.
Disney's been doing that since the 1930s. Nothing new.
Disney has no real room to talk as they were barbequed by a Japanese movie the same as Hollywood. If Japan can make a movie for only 15 million and it be a big hit what is Hollywood smoking? Love ya Film theory.
Hey MatPat you should do a video on the infinity stones not actually being destroyed because Thanos said that they were reduced to atoms so could the avengers have rebuilt them
I've, honestly, always been all right with AI as a concept. The issue I take with it is when it steals from actual, sentient people and then gets used to replace the very people it stole from! If you wouldn't tolerate a human doing something, then you shouldn't tolerate an AI doing the same.
Never mind the actual propaganda, indoctrination, and “not-so-secret-agenda” that they have admitted they are forcing down the throats of children.
Nothing new
6:12 I want to point out this ad went so well that enlistment numbers are at a historic low.
So in the inevitable sequel to ME3AN, is Megan going to be the hero?
Mat Pat i need your help theres this YouTube channel called Shilo and bros and they have some lore I need help to find why and what is this agency who is the hooded figure
I never trusted AI anyways
Fantastic video! I was thinking if Matpat could be doing a theory on hazbin hotel as one of his final theories, now that the show finally has episodes? It Would really be something I’d love
If there is too much propaganda and clickbaiting, I feel it, and stop watching it. They are losing audience.  If they made good enough content and mixed in subtle enough propaganda, it would actually work. But instead they just ruin it all. I don't know why they are doing it. Probably because they are lazy and try to cut corners too much.
It took you so long to realize that disney is making propaganda? Are you kidding me? Not even gonna have to watch the video everyone with a brain knows they're doing that
have you finaly figerd it out
Thank you, MatPat. *Only 7 Theories left?!* 😢
"Her" was not an antagnisic AI
Fish
This episode makes me think about Detroit Become Human
Disney has always been a propaganda mashen for government to what ever else is popular at the time they started with pro Natzi then Anti-Natzi when it became less popular to modern-day where they are live action and changing everything to "be more endlusive"
Plz do one on why bobs burgers restaurant never succeeds
Kind of sad that MatPat has to tell his audience that propaganda actually exists and that it not just a conspiracy theory(Im prepared for the joke). But its actually quite nice that he's educating his viewers not to mention to open ones mind in such things and theories. Maybe that was the goal from the start 😏
The animated army ads made me want to get out of the army😂
I’m so happy someone is finally bringing attention to propaganda in this country, it’s not only in our media but in our schools our books and anywhere corporations or governments think they can put it. Most Americans seem to not notice this fact causing a lot of peoples opinions to be biased and un objective often forgetting there are two sides to every conflict
Literally everything is propaganda, even the meme that your friends are making. What world do you live on?
Even crazier thing is how they can target people almost directly with ads
I think you should do a hazben hotel  theory.
MatPat, sad to see you go. YouTube won't be the same without you.
If you dont watch Disney or modern movies, this becomes a non issue....unfortunately, me and three other cavemen will be pushed into who knows what neurolink dystopia bs.  Or maybe WW3 wipes out computers, and then the carubretor will reign supreme!
So…. More unions? Just say the quiet part out loud next time….
plsssssssssss do an hazbin hotel video the entire season 1 episodes and it would make a great video plssssssssssssssss
Final episode of hazbin hotel season 1 just dropped, and alastor is still a big mystery. Almost like fighting for your theory attention
I stopped watching theory videos long ago, but tbh this one actually has a kinda important message that I actually would like to see more people aware of. It addresses several important issues, really. Thanks for using one of your last few videos to do some public good, and congrats!
The only propaganda Disney pushes is woke fascist agenda, it's pathetic
The Sopranos is one big pharma commercial among other things including really well put together and PC training
AI hate is akin to luddites scorning machines during the IR. The singularity is our destiny, we will merge with AI.  Humans are at the top of the food chain in the animal kingdom because of our superior intelligence. We love being smart. Our harnessing of AI super intelligence is bound to happen.
I thought this video was about woke stuff. Boy was I mistaken
pls do a miraculous lore video
Hey film theory you should do i iron Jaynet
I don't know why I wanted to comment this, but I solved a theory I had on a movie! The movie is called Anger Management, and I wanted to figure out why the main character was getting falsely accused of having horrible anger outbursts, before it was explained at the end of the movie, and with a little help from my mom who watched it before I figured out the main characters girlfriend hired a service to help him with anger management, ( the kind you keep inside) but instead of getting therapy for two weeks he was put through lots of stressful situations that would sometimes end up in a fight, which all somehow helps him in the end
Yeah just ignore the fact that hollywood has been on the LGBTQ propoganda train for years now.... and its being going great
That princess bride quote at the end of a video on AI was hilarious.
Recent developments have taught us AI shouldn't be depicted as different kinds of people with real human desires and emotions ala Blade Runner 2, but rather as very different creatures making a simulacrum of human interactions that's eerily good at times and off base in incomprehensible ways at other times, and who knows what's really going on behind the mask it shows us.
uhhh Idk I watched Usher with a group of friends and everyone in the room understood she was supposed to be evil for her views on AI, sorry this is classic quoting out of context
Not ERB's Michael Bay 🤣
I personally think generative AI is awesome I can’t wait to see what it’s like 5 years down the road
Some more friendly ai robots. R2D2 and C-3PO
Tumble Leaf Theory?
Mat Pat I gonna miss you, you have always be apart of my childhood, I thank you for spending these last 10 vids on very truthful and eye opening topics I just hope people open their minds and learn from all this
Can you do a hazben hotel cover with the first season out now?
Can't wait for you to do a poppy playtime chapter 3 theory if you are
This is considered a "theory"? Disney's leaked audio has long ago confirmed what everyone already knew.
This will be seen as the 1st “soft” resistance towards AI ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
We need a Hazbin Hotel theory now 👀
Ok, the classic intro caught me off guard. Didn't expect to shed a tear less than a minute in. 10/10 nostalgia trip
Joe Biden can regulate Ai in like a week; but has been refusing to close and enforce the southern border. Ironic
15:53 I wanna believe Secret Invasion using AI on the opening scene is just a joke; the whole point of the series is to know whether the other one is a human or not. Remark it on the credits and there you have it!
Can u or the new person make a bfdi theory?
Abominable Intelligence is tech heresy.
Pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase can you  do a lackadaisy film theory
real late on the draw there bucko
mat you should really look into this missing song from ages ago. somebody only recorded a snippet of it in really bad quality and nobody can find the real thing.  people call it "everyone knows that- ulterior motives"
Why did this video come out while I was at Magic Kingdom and Epcot?
The ai copy of you was not convincing at all 😂😂
CAN YOU DO HAZBIN HOTEL
Can you make a new Hazbin Hotel theory because of the series?
I haven't watched anything from disney, and I haven't seen any shows on netflix that have AI, so I guess I'm doing a good job!
The death of art is the death of creativity.
Propaganda is the Spanish word for “marketing”. But it’s slowly changing just it is in English.
you should make a theory on season one of hazbin hotel
Film theory idea:  would wonka actually be able to survive the night in the cold
PLEASE BEFORE YOU LEAVE MAKE ONE ON BFDI!!!
🫡🫡
Hello, Matpat! Can you make a theory video on the new wonka movie please? The movie has lots of theories!
Please plz make a theory on peaky blinders plz plz
Regarding  the idea that the propaganda is about AI.. not so certain I agree entirely with that.  One has to remember that the people at Disney are the types that would issue a land acknowledgement, fully endorsing decolonization narratives.  In other words, if there is a conflict of interest, they are the type that can't take their own side, or at least will stand against the whichever side is most Western (culturally or ethnically).  The writers, today, reflect that part of society that think the world would be better off without us.  Really, if you could personify our politics it would be in the form of a depressed, anxiety ridden person that is fighting between thinking he brings value or having nothing of value to offer the world.    So, as AI is beginning to take a more prominent role in our lives we will desire to make entertainment that deals with that fact, and as Disney writes AI driven conflict they will be more apt to side with the AI, because for Disney writers, the Western, human side is almost always the real monster.    Think about it this way.. how often have you seen a message in movies and tv that questions if the monster is really a monster or just someone that is misunderstood?  It is all a part of this flip in the grand narrative, that the stranger should be trusted and the neighbor should be questioned.  That, and the connected and now almost ubiquitous narrative of diversity being our strength.    So, as AI is in many ways the most strange of strangers, then it is then no surprise that we now see writers desiring to write stories that vindicate the AI as not being a monster, and showing how really it is we who are the monsters.
18:23 LIAR!!!!! (this is a joke)
I don't want you to leave youtube why do you have to leave.
“Knotseas bad” is literally propaganda    We allied with a nation that gained power from a insurrection and murdered its royal family over someone who was democratically elected    Propaganda works if you repeat something enough to children
We makin' it out the Matrix with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
The reason people didnt like the deepfakes in Rouge one wasnt because they were deepfakes, it's because both of the actors passed away
Woke propaganda
So hazbin hotel season 1 just wrapped up. Why not a theory on it before you go MatPat? Please
. . .and, Disney, we’ll see you in court.
You should do a theory and why do planets talk in solarball and ignore the laws of physics
6:12 "Updated for the times" = failing to meet recruitment numbers
Here’s a theory that might inspire you in the original Winnie the Pooh movie it features Christopher robin as a human character, but in the playhouse Disney series my friends tigger and Pooh it’s features another human character named Darby so is she related to Christopher robin.
Remember when Disney threw lemmings of a cliff to make it look like they were unaliving themselves? Yeah, Disney has definitely been making propaganda for a while.
I want AI Matt Pat to host the videos after March or I'm out
I'm not surprised I haven't heard of the creator. I watched Rogue One twice because it was so forgettable, I can't remember anything about it.
For anyone who thinks they are leaning towards pro-ai, let me just remind you. It is just programming. It is just programming, okay? No real human feelings are being felt. No original artwork can be created. Etc. please do not let artificial intelligence take over your mind as well.
Does anyone think this is a theory?
Best Theory video in a long time
Until DIZNEE get's back to making movies that are only entertainment they are not going to be getting one thin dime from me or my family.
When only a handful of people own every media outlet, and they are all coordinated, this is the war of information you get. The "message" gets inserted in everything.
Do you know that hazbin hotel is updated
Sorry mate but ur intro is annoying as fk!🤨🤣
Also, imagine ignoring the most influential and pre-modern era positive AI depiction from Star Trek: The Next Generation, just to desperately validate this being a RECENT phenomenon.
TLDR: I want to see the Chinese version of Iron Man 3
The Martian Chinese this is true but it's actually in the books so that's just a happy accident.
I Wanna see a film theory in magica madoka so bad 😭🙏
TFT dropping bombs 💣 on his way out....
I'm not sure Netflix hit that one on the head then, since the Ushers in that series are 100% evil to the core, so anything they do or support is likely also extremely bad.  That was the message the film told me.
The purpose of AI is to push/promote colectivism/communism 3.0   The "true believers" think it will bring about a utopia when it will actually bring about Stalinist era misery. There's a reason conservatives have been trying to warn about globalism for a few decades.   Keep believing the Left/Dems/RINOs at your peril.
search into itemLabel its interesting
Blud Oda prob gave this man money to not cover the one piece lore like this guy is avoiding it as the plauge 💀
This is first grade propaganda history. Propaganda is everything, and advertisements, film, and newspapers exist for propaganda. Decade themes like patriotism etc. are the easy and obvious national themes. The much more hidden ones are the moral themes that likely influence you all the time and you actually don't know it. One example. You probably think the moral thing to do is to be healthy, self-powered, and a "family" person. Those are the themes Planned Parenthood wanted to push since the 1940's to change culture and create a new moral code. They wanted women turning on men and men losing power over their households. But keeping taking your vitamins.
Make a Hazbin hotel theory
We’ve taken care of everything the words you read the songs you sing the pictures that give pleasure to your eye. One for all and all for one work together common sons.  Never need to wonder how or why.
Maybe now the droids in Star Wars will finally get justice.
Wait i need a film theory on lightning mcqueens highest top speed and if in his prime he could beat jackson storm
Movies depicting AI as the bad guys has always being the case, just like nuclear energy.
Michael Bay is a Master of getting your taxes.
i thought this guy quit youtube?
Wow. Criticize propaganda and then do a whole video of it. Tell us that you don't want to tell us what to think, then give examples on only one side of the issue, ignoring things that don't fit into the timeline you want us to believe in. Movies and TV have been bringing dead actors back since Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Peter O'Toole) and The Sopranos (Natalie Marchand), not just in the past couple of years. Self-directed algorithms have been "a real thing in the real world" for decades, used on space probes dating back to the _Mariner_ program, the Soviet Union's _Venera_ probes, and even the _Voyager_ and _Pioneer_ missions. In Science fiction, robots and AI, both good and bad, made their comeback with the revisited Battlestar Galactica. Caprica visited the benefits of AI, and Humans dealt with AI as a minority being persecuted before "a couple of years" ago. One might argue the same about Detroit: Become Human. And the position you SEEM to be advocating, that movies have only depicted AI as a good thing since some alleged about face following Ex Machina, is brought into question by movies like Dune, which shows a world which rejects AI entirely due to its misuse nearly destroying civilization . . . and the very obvious Mission: Impossible movie which you reference!  I agree that the Hollywood Machine is cranking out propaganda, but the primary subject of it is NOT AI. More than anything else, the propaganda they churn out has to do with social approval of certain behaviors the Hollywood elite deem acceptable, and certain attitudes they deem enlightened, as well as social repudiation of certain political stances which they deem evil.
For the last film theories.  Can we have _Boisvert part 2????
Matt, what happens if any of the other pictures on the poster gets added in the middle in the Fnaf movie
AI MatPat sounded nothing like the voice I'm used to hearing on this channel.
Hi, I really enjoy your content even though I don’t always agree with the theories. By the way  you have inspired me to make a similar channel after you leave. 😀
You know who else makes fake news? BBC, they lie about certain historical figures gender and race
Identity politics, virtue signaling, orange man bad and lgbtq agendas are most obvious propaganda.
I really want a theory about comic books and propaganda. I feel like it's really convenient that for years they show in comics which used to be primarily for younger audiences that if you do things like killing you're just as bad as the villians. Pretty convenient for people in power that can't be touched by the law due to money and influence. Joker has killed billions but for whatever reason killing him is wrong.
and according to this vid umm disney faked disney 100 cuz 1 year before it was disney 50
Film theory idea: a theory on emesis blue
matpat your my favorate theriost and i always wanted you to do a theory on inanimate insanity
Do trolls, DAD or plants versus zombies
Can you do a hazbin hotel theory season 1 is out
After like a year or 10 years after you quit, please make another video
15:50 why even use AI background characters? There are millions of people who would love to be extras in a movie for very low pay.
Film theory idea is the football games scripted
I know you don't know me but it will mean so much if you made up theory about Not Your Normal Kids Show it would mean so much to me🙏
Great video MatPat as always but what if you are one of those people who want a future with lots of tech and AI? Which is part of tech just posing that question
Hey film heorits,can i have one last rick and morty theory? season 7 was so good for lore,i want even a short would make me happy so pls. <3
I’m Suprised you still haven’t done a theory on object shows! Especially ONE.
You should do a theory on hazbin hotel!
Suggestion for next film theory vid   Hazbin Hotel  Now that season 1 has been fully released I think it would be a fun theory to do   In addition, the theories from the last hazbin hotel theory vid can be either confirmed or off the mark
please make a theory about Hazbin Hotel!! The whole season 1 is out now and there's plenty of material to work with!!!
Why do thhe thumbnails are lookin' a bit cheap?
This may be the last time to ever ask so please do BFDI theory
Um, yeah? They are pushing the LGBTQ agenda down everyones throat.
Mats old intro brings back so many memories. I remember my first video was the jack and the neverland one. I was searching it cuz i haven't watched in a long time and then his video was recommended. After I binge watched all of the other videos 💀💀💀
For every 1 arguably positive messages about AI, there is 100 negative messages. This is incredibly misleading and is propaganda itself. No one is seeing messaging that talks good about AI.  You don't know what AI is it's obvious you are just regurgitating your own AI propaganda that you've been fed.
Stop thinking independently! A.I. is completely safe and effective!
No, generative AI is definitely not, in any way, the stealing of other original material.  Anyone who claims it is, either does not understand how generative AI works, or doesn't understand how humans produce their own original art.  The way you train an image generator or other machine learning like that, you give it a huge set of experiences, like images or music, which it then converts into a completely different format, like vector data, a giant Vector database that has no resemblance whatsoever to the original information.  It does this according to patterns it finds, almost exactly the way we with human Minds organize information in our heads.  When we make up a song, or draw a drawing, we are basing it on all of our experiences of songs or drawings in our memory. And that's exactly what the generative model is doing, as well.
Yes! Theme song is back!
dude, everything media related in America is propaganda, the news, the internet, television shows, movies, books, comic books, graphic novels, and etc.  Especially nowadays ever since post 2010.  You really don't want to be indoctrinated with propaganda, huh?  Prove it and kick your media habit.
Great video. SPOILER  One critique on the House of Usher: The plot point was not random. The point was to mimic the forboding in Tell Tale Heart.  I thought this actually made a case for the AI being a terrible idea, as the twist at the end was that it was tormenting not comforting the man as originally promised.
Please stop the squeaky voice
Hazbin hotel
yo matpat i have a request, can u make an episode about adventure time? cause i noticed u got 0 adventure time videos
Wasn't that obvious? Lol
Ai is fine but shouldn’t replace people’s jobs
Pls short war season 2 explain
It's been 42 years...
Hollywood is pushing with LGBTQ in their movies
Seeing the title i thought you were going full South Park
All media is propaganda. if only through what it normalises
Duh
I would argue that the ‘Irony’ of propaganda is that the Film Industry can produce as much content as they want, BUT at the end of the day it’s the people’s choice to listen
Neo-Luddism or new Luddism is a philosophy opposing many forms of modern technology.[1] The term Luddite is generally used as a pejorative applied to people showing technophobic leanings.[2] The name is based on the historical legacy of the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1817.[1] Ironically, the historical English luddites were not technophobic. They were skilled operators of technology, and the industrial machinery that they destroyed was often not new or cutting edge. They were protesting the impact of capitalist economic changes on their livelihoods. None the less, they are often remembered as technophobes as the neo-luddist movement demonstrates.
Protect our artists
i think its a pretty good time that mat explains the stange video of i pet goat II
What a coincidence!  I haven't watched a new movie since 2008, I would rather watch my favorite Youtube videos than tv, and Disney has been absolute trash for decades.  Also.  A.I. would be beneficial only as a SIMPLE tool. To HELP those making a script or drawing a piece of artwork. Need a hand pose reference? BOOM. Need a small plot twist for a side character but your sleep deprived brain can't hit the deadline because you wanna sleep? BOOM.  Don't pass off original creativity to a robot. But they can HELP. I'm sure they could assist doctors, nurses, factory workers with maybe delivering work to other stations or mixing chemicals. Making our lives a LITTLE easier but not going full nuclear like freaking Disney. Disney is getting desperate because their want for money is overriding their sense of rationale. People want GOOD and WELL ANIMATED works with a new and original story to it. Instead, they think vomiting technology everywhere is gonna fix it.  I'm NOT KIDDING when I say I haven't watched a full movie in recent years. Yes, even anime. Unless you count me rewatching the classics until I can memorize every line. Because movie media has grown so stale and lackluster that instead of paying someone with great ideas to make something, only the top companies push out ABSOLUTE 💩.  I don't even have home internet or a streaming service in my home. We use an ANTENNA. Which broadcasts mainly OLDER shows and movies. I have a VHS player from the 80s that I have a rewinder for because the internal one broke.  🙃     I will always prefer a hard copy DVD over a digital media.  And no, I'm not a "boomer."  I just haven't saturated my life with technology like most of my generation. And I have no need to do so, either. So please don't preach to me how amazing Marvel is, or how great Chat-whatever is to use. I will use my own brain and imagination, give me a book over an app any day. I use an A.I. to google tv schedules, and one for hand models when my wooden hand model isn't helping the pencil on paper.  🙃  So. No. A.I. to do everything? Terrible idea. A.I. as a tool to HELP do the job? Sure. Make life a tiny bit easier but don't turn us into Wall-E humans, tyvm.  Sincerely, My Long-Winded Opinion, as written by The Woman With 100 Faces.  💙  P.s. Always think for yourselves, love each other, and please have a nice day.  💙
Seems like an appropriate time for disney/fox/hulu to reboot Futurama also while we’re on the topic. I haven’t seen the new season yet but I bet these pro-AI messages are baked in there too.
Now let's talk about what Disney has actually been pushing.
Half a minute through the video and I'm appreciating the throwback to that intro. Awesome decision 💯
Can you do ALASTOR on HAZBIN hotel?? The official show just came out with 8 episodes and it is totally amazing!
Please do a video on Matilda. If Nigel is Miss Honey’s son, please please please
make a theory about BFDI season 3 IDFB
Hey film theory do an attack on titan theory. The shows recently ended and I would cool to see you return to the series.
They're different commercials because they're two different services.
Beer is healthier than coca cola when used in moderation.
There can't be 2 moms or 2 dads. Only girls can be the mommy and boys can only be the daddy.
You gotta make a Hazbin Hotel theory
Saying knowing is half the battle is propaganda is a stretch
Nothing has changed with propaganda, the only difference is we can recognize it more
The artists did not get a good settlement from those strikes...
I find it interesting that people rip on AI about regurgitating existing art but one of the first questions many artists get is "who are your influences".
The "updated for modern times" recruitment ads for the military have helped decrease the number of men signing on to join. Most women want nothing to do with military or combat outside of having a husband who serves and the benefits that come with it so the ads are misdirected.        Plus california is as far removed from American cultural values as you can get.
This is old news. Disney has been trying to and succeeded in brainwashing millions into believing they’re a “good” company, when no such thing exists, especially at those market caps
Just a quick fact, at the same time the government was helping to move drugs into the country to fund secret wars; they were pushing the anti drugs propaganda. The result? A militarized police force and those that didn't follow the propaganda in jail or addicted . Gross.
Make one about joe foldberg
So with Ai being used to fix faces does this mean that make-up artists may lose their jobs?
They ain't making money that's for sure
Hey!!! I had an idea of a theory! It's about helluva hotel and what gets someone into heaven. Nothing gets someone into heaven besides their own mindset and thinking that they deserve it. Case in point Adam.
The Film Theorist is not suicidal
Generative A.I. is exploitative. That's why it's terrible.
Your country is truly down the drain hole when your president thinks a movie is real life. Next step is to have a person in cosplay of a puppet as your actual leader.  The rest of the world looks forward to it and the increase in the entertainment it will bring.
Thank you matpat for new insight in ai and i gain more knowledge and information in this video
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONE WHAT?!?!?!
How was the AI in Her antagonistic? If anything it's one of the most sympathetic and human AIs in any media I can remember.
Make hazbin hotel theory
MatPat decided to speak facts before leaving
How much Money has scrouge mc duck made in ducktales?
PLEASE DO A SONIC THEORY!!! (especially somic prime)
There is no stopping AI technology from moving forward and disruptive effects, but there is still time to make sure it is not exclusively in the hands of corporations and power holders. If it is useful for Disney, so is it useful for you. If it takes little to create something that is useful, it should cost little for everyone to enjoy the benefit from it. AI should be used for common good, not made into a cog in the profit making machine.
Dude's buying a dangerous fight before retiring. Exposing propaganda is always a risky move, specially from behemoths
That explains Netflix “PLuto”
When someone that never shares conspiracy theories,is very logical,data driven and doesn't trust but verifies starts to talk about a conspiracy THATS WHEN you listen
im begging you to do a poppy playtime theory PLEASE
hey i was just wondering if you could make one theory about disney's new movie wish
Bro all Military Movies from America are propaganda the Pentagon even control the whole script 😂😂😂😂😂
When matpats old intro popped up, i really cried 😢
Remember kids, drink 🥛, become iron man.
this has rlly changed my view of Detroit become human
AI is generally good, but the artists working on the artwork for many of the titles and other things also lose their job, not only their job but also their office/studio and along with it the great time they had as a team making and coming up with designs and ideas, they're having fun and putting together for us a beautiful narrative with beautiful depictions of their story they composed on their own, making it an enjoyable experience for everyone, but corporate disney likes muny, and can ruin the lives of those artists, AI can still be used to deliver that experience but the artists aren't their anymore and sometimes it might even get soul less in certain scenes, it's still important that the artists be there ai is not on the level of understanding as us making their work in art partly flawed, either way artists and their jobs will remain for quite a while for the ai to get better at their job and eventually, the student becomes the master
If you want to read up on propaganda, look up Edward Bernays.
omg Rockman X becoming reality *_* they already got me ovee 20 years ago XD well, it DID say in the year 20xx - that`s now :p
I would love a theory about how for exambel Superman or Homelander fly without wings
they added the intro back, i can now die happy.
I will do two crunches for every like this comment gets
"Theory"? Brother do you _live_ on this planet?
Matpat you need to do a theory on unedited footage of bear it is a rabbit hole and plus it's her so it seems like something you
Disney can't propagandize me because I divorced them a few years ago.
I think that using AI chat bots for personal use is fine, example: Character AI for roleplay and such. But using AI to write stories, fake voices, and steal art, is just wrong. It’s sad that people don’t realize just how bad AI is in general, it’s stealing, that’s just what it is. Plagiarism.
Movies and art has kind of sucked since 2009, I'm still waiting for generative AI to get good enough I can cut the middle man out and just ask my gaming PC to non stop create custom content to my personal taste. Then again maybe Gene Roddenberry has propagandized me will all the times Geordi la Forge was able to effortlessly ask the ships computer to create a new holo-novel based only old photo and book scans, at least I know for sure it's wasn't Disney I haven't watched any of their films since 2005. Currently I'm using AI to upscale my DVDs of movies and shows that never got bluray releases, I'm quite happy with the results from realsr ncnn vulkan though it's painfully slow on my current graphics card.
This is isn’t right. You haven’t even talked about the real propaganda in film or how the CIA is in control of all media. 😊
Valuable
I wish more people talked about The Creator
Matpat I have a theory SpongeBob SquarePants and Star butterfly from star vs the forces of evil are cousins because they have the same personality and they look similar so please do this theory before you leave it will be my dream please get this comment
Careful Disney might not like this 😬
Day 1 of saying, u know there I more lore about hazbin hotel
Can you do “9” lore
Disney is disgusting
I’m gonna cry. I can’t watch these mowing what’s going to happen.
Biden won’t sign more important matters though.
Mat Pat where is the sweater I ordered 🤬
Finally , I missed this intro so much I was hoping it would be back its the signature of this channel please keep using it   and in a video start calculating non sense stuff for weird topic without taking a breath and very fast (that was classic)
Wow,such an incredible video uploaded..
do amphibia pls I'm kori hi
This explains why the rock is back in wwe
you guys have no idea.... this is not even a scratch on the tip of the iceburg
I wast having a litle knowledege about this theory but holy macaroni thats messed up
Frog in boiling water is a myth, btw
Ngl, that "# Theories Remain" is ominous!
Matpat you should do ninjago it's the best show and movie because I think it will be the beat video ever
one of the most concerning aspects of propaganda in my opinion is when you realize it's propaganda but nobody else can do the same so you just feel like a madman screaming about something the masses think is a conspiracy even though it's not.
matpat please dont go your my favrovtive youtuber
I know this is film theory, but imagine a theory on STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE???!!!
Finally someone noticed
Bro be spitting mad facts
taking in different works of art, and then using them to generate new art is literally just how the human brain actually functions in general.
aren't threories that can be wrong but influence loads of people considered propaganda?
Don't tell South Park
I can't believe you forgot the movie A.I. with Haley Joel Osment. The sixth sense kid. Hollywood is an antichrist prophecy machine. Writing their own Bible in all minds to get you to forget God and his word. Dont take the mark yall. It will be painfully obvious to those of us that are saved, but many billions of people will waltz right in and take that mark in their forehead or right hand.
Can you please do Gorilla tag next like how strong they have to be
Magic=<Science  Aha, eureka
I just love that they are replacing actors, but you know what they can replace you big wigs to, they never stopped to think after everyone was pushed out and only the big wigs remain there still can only be one true big wig the massacre will be grand and when the old big wigs that have been pushed out start saying its not fair I will just drink my cup of their salty tears
I've not watched the video, but Disney **literally** made propaganda shorts during WW2, so I'm not sure what there is to theorize about?? Like this wouldn't be something new for them?
Can we get a full AI MatPat episode for April Fools, trained entirely on your channels' audio, visuals, and script writing? Even if it's not this year, I think that would be funny.
AI will plagiarize human creativity!
Can you do this on europa the last battle? It's an 11 part series and can only be found on internet archive i did my own research and couldn't find it to be false  but I'm not as good as you lol
fun fact: i was almost part of the 300,000 babies that had fallen ill due to melamine if it weren't for my mom who carried containers of baby milk formula from overseas everytime she visited me in China
NO WAY, DISNEY!?
A.I can be better than humans at a lot of things, but they can never be able to replace the real creativity and heart and soul that we put into creating movies. I don’t care if it saves time or cash: robots can’t replace ACTUAL storytelling
Wait that’s a THEORY? I thought everyone kinda agreed it was true at this point.
This was literally my history class!
Im surprised film theory hasnt doen theories for hazbin hotel yet
You should cover the new lays commercials.
The intros back🤩
If anyone in here still thinks, like is good, just go watch M3gan it’ll make it change your mind about the whole thing.
Can you do hazbin hotel theory
Transhumanism
You have to be No you have to be difficultdifficult😾😡
Propaganda? More like a Prop A Ganda at Deez Nuts
bringing back the old intro 🙏🏻
Disney never stopped making propaganda.
I’m pretty sure some people saw it
I dunno about anyone else. I just want my AI anime waifu girlfriend.
I always said when ai takes over and gets smarter it’s gonna take over the world and terminator movies have predicted the future good for ever
Ya cool Ai wow crazy but Bro...I cant believe film theory is ending. Film theory is the reason i started watching YouTube. Not music, gaming, or even how to videos.. film/game theory.. dude u broke my heart 😢😢
If you ever do another film theory add the suggestion 9 to 5
Please, please, pleeeeaaase do another theory video on Hazbin hotel! It just dropped its season finale and THERE IS SO MUCH LORE IN HERE!!!!! Its on prime video if you're wondering! SO GOOD!!!
Matt Patt just basically told us where he stood politically and also warned about Disney’s propaganda machine but I think this was less about “AI” and more about “DEI”. Matt is usually one of Disney’s biggest fans so it only make sense that he’d hate their current failures and being Matt Patt he’d also know 100% the real reason the company is dying but he’d also know that openly criticizing anything vaguely close to the DEI agenda could possibly put everything he’s built at risk, but hey that’s just a theory 😢 a Matt Theory.  We’re gonna miss you bro.
Me: reads title Me: "You just figured that out now?"
Don't forget Chappie
The old intro made me cry watching fr that melody will forever be stuck in my head
"Turning Red" - need I say more?
MATPAT PLS DO A THEORY FOR HAZBIN HOTEL!!!!!!!!!! There’s new episodes and new lore and I want to see you do another theory after two years!
Crazy to think this videos play back speed is normal right now.
The Creator is so bad that it should of been obvious to everyone that is was propaganda.
Well duh Disney is the master of propaganda but it became very blatantly obvious the past few years
I argue that the message is AI and American collapse. Civil War by A24 studios and Leave This World Behind is still spreading some sort of propaganda.
Mat please finish that gravity falls video from 6 years go please Mat…
Have fun with the push ups 😂
i mean , pretty much everyone 's making propaganda theese dayz . XD  disney,s no different
I like ai cause it's free. I ain't paying no dumb artist
Thanks for saving us master mat
Where’s the new information??
the ad about emma's two moms inspired exactly 0 people to enlist.
When your internet goes down in the middle of this video
thank you for bringing light to this propaganda machine
Not only can you think about it, you can also call or write to your local senators, asking them to put more restrictions on ai
Vide idea loud house why don’t we see Lucy’s eyes
Humans working manual labor while AI makes art and poetry is NOT the future i wanted
ATTENTION FILM THEORY if you can give a decent explanation for why agriculture was invented you are the guaranteed best theorist on this planet.
I remember another movie called Ron Gone Wrong which is Disney plus and I guess also embraces AI being a good companionship
12:21 My wife is sleeping and here I am bursting out laughing about the Marvels "No one went to see this thing 😂 "
In the sow Oddbods there is a green guy but in the one that they are kid\baby’s he is gone. Can you find were he gone plz before you leave YouTube
Arghhhhh the old intro it feels GOOD
I kind of disagree about the creator. The movie pretends that AI are the good guy but it poses a lot of open questions about them ethically. For a quick example, we see AI do lot of violent and questionable things which make you question their safety.
Thank you for covering an important topic before leaving the channel, I think you've brought an insight to the mainstream which I haven't seen yet. We cannot let A.I take our meaning from us.
Thanks to Roko’s Basilisk, I support ai. But I believe that ai should be tempered.  Back the Lisk
What's up with your voice dude?
Bro ain’t you just quit YouTube 😑😑 seems like you’re pushing your own regime ❤️
I thought Matt Pat retired
Dear film theorists. please make a hazbin hotel theory my brain cant function with all the stuff that happend in the last episode and i am not capable of theorizing myself
matpat has to make a JJK theory before he leaves
Where's the theory?
MatPat is being replaced by AI in March. This is a theory.
At 10 minutes I forgot what this video was about and just kind of wandered away from the device as it was playing.
This is probably one of my favorite episodes ever, we livin such critic times that is impossible to not talk about politics in every field of our lives in any part of the world
This is by far the dumbest video you have ever uploaded. Asking everyone watching “what is the propaganda agenda now“ and then you dare say it’s AI? Are you just completely ignoring the woke agenda? Geez man first video in a while and last video probably ever.
old intro hella nostalgic
I need a theory on coco please
iRobot, bicentennial man, short circuit…even before it was possible we had film about it. What about all that? It’s just entertainment. Not being mooshy brained is on us.
Ooook Disney if ai is good then it has to be good for making AI versions of stories similar to yours I mean it surely doesn't hit your copyright rules
Disney's making propaganda all right Matt pat but totally not for AI. we all know what its for. can anyone guess? I'll give you a hint it starts with a W  👇
The only propaganda and FAKE NEWS is coming from Mat Pat!!!  It's a good thing that he is leaving YouTube!
Hey, MatPat, I have some siblings that love numberblocks, can you you please do numberblocks lore?
Yes. This is why Disney doesn't care that they are losing money. The government will make it worth their while. It's gross.
14:40 they should have used AI to give Mary McDonnell a less obvious wig.
Can you plz check on hazbin hotel
Progress be like, "Can't stop won't stop."
I thought this guy Retired.
Disney really is trying to be like all those nasty corporations from dystopian fiction such as cyberpunk, huh? I think it goes without saying, that we dont want entities like that wielding any kind of power and as the saying goes "money is power". To be fair though, AI has potential to solve many of our problems. Humanitys last invention some even say. But just like any other tech, it is wielders choice whether its harmful or helpful. Just like atom, blasting powder, blade and fire. IMO Disney is NOT a good wielder for this tech.
Is the channel ending??😢 why did he say final episodes. Noooo MatPat
Him: The propaganda now is all about AI Meanwhile: *it all started with a little girl with 2 moms*
Disney ruined Star Wars 🗿
You guys have no idea what Disney is up to... It's better you don't know.
You probably look 10+ years older now stop using old photos pls update your photos.
"Disney is Making Propaganda"  Video is about the use of AI rather than the "woke" political propaganda....
You know what is great about AI?... Less people tp pay for! I thought this years ago with Toy story and CGI.. Why pay for expensive actors when you pay less for voice actors. You have to think more Inter-generational people!... what are your kids going to do for work?  Just remember, Dogs were once wolfs! we kept breeding them and taking out the ones we didn't like until they were all obedient. Good dogs!
Matpat can you do another hazbin hotel video please ? They have made new episodes in prime video!
Hey, so I have an interesting question you could make a video about. I don't know where you would upload it, maybe food theory? So the question is, " how protected are we really from germs and bacteria?" Like in public bathrooms with the paper seat cover, or the very plates we eat off of. Given the issues we've had to deal with recently, I think it could be very interesting.
AI is not the main propaganda being pushed right now. The cultural propaganda is far more potent right now. Why not cover that?
The only agenda that Disney pushes is wokeness
Dear MatPat, We would like to ask you if you could still narrate your channels. It would keep the look and feel of your channels while you can still enjoy life. While I understand your reasons to want to quit and give your channel away. It will not work for your channel and the fanbase so please do consider this message. Eighter way we will always remember how ness is sans and fnaf was always a dream. The times you counted animatronic toes for the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE. The time you made your first theory or even started this channel in 2011. We can all agree you are one of the first stars of youtube and always one of the best.
One extra thing about Iron Man 3 that (I think) I got from a previous video, where you mentioned that the  infamous villain mandarin was made drastically less stereotypically Chinese Villain
That makes no sense. If I read a ton of books and get inspired by them and write a essay, is that copyright or inspiration
Lol Matpat is lowkey coming back as AI voiceover😂
This isn't a 'Theory'. This is part of our dystopian future. So use Ai to save yourself money too!
Remember when during a football game or Super Bowl game I think but those Ai robots were present on the field & or in the crowd interaction with humans at sports events. That was not & a exercise at the same time of conditioning . It’s all coming together
Im so glad matpat is awake...
The Creator is absolute trash. Don't watch
Idiots. Hollywood has ALWAYS made propaganda. It was CONCEIVED as a propaganda machine. And you know who showed you how to start ? The Russians. Read history.
i dont know who didnt know this, but Disney has always done propaganda
9:53 That was in the original book, it's almost certainly a coincidence
Please make a film theory on The   amazing World of gumball this is my 12 time asking 😢 (love your videos BTW )
Disney not going to be happy with this
MATPAT ERA IS THE GOLDEN ERA
This from film theory is amazing. I have seen on of your videos in along time but im glad to see u back in my doom-scroling feed
What a myopic take. It's not just AI being pushed. It's elitism, collectivism, and depopulation. Look closer.
It's funny you just come to this realization now. Conservatives have known this for 24+ years.
"Disney is making propaganda" Yes, I agree  "It's about AI" ????  I think you missed the bigger issue here, hard.
Matpat please do a theory on hazbin hotel ........
On Allah, frick disney
Ok, but AI IS good. Yes, it can also be bad, but that’s literally how everything is. It has its pros and cons, but the amount of things AI is capable of improving in our life is unimaginable to us right now. There are seemingly infinite ways for AI to be used to improve our society.  Being scared of it is just paranoia and irrational fear.  If anything, the propaganda of being terrified of AI has been pushed by movies and film over the last few decades. You even mentioned in this video all of the examples of AI being portrayed as the antagonist. And even that Joe Biden just made an executive order to restrict AI because he saw a movie. I mean… that’s way more influential and equally as propagandist as what you’re claiming that Disney is doing. Maybe everything’s not a conspiracy.  Is this Film Theory or Conspiracy Theory?
This farewell tour is crazy
Seeing you go is making my childhood scream and cry I’ve been subbed since 1000 subs and it’s sad that your leaving goodbye matpat thank you for everything god bless you and you family.😢😢
I would argue that people have been becoming more accustomed to deepfake technology because it’s improved and looks more human now, and on top of that, it’s more of an additive effect than a replacement substitute like posters or writing and whatnot. We’ve come a long way since TRON: Legacy with CLU, and we got a glimpse of how good it could be almost 9 years ago with Ant-Man with Hank Pym/Michael Douglas.
You didn't mention the propaganda that brought us the acceptance of the alphabet gang and the subsequent mafia it created. Wonder why?
i coulda told u this a long time ago 😭
"Knowing is half teh battle" isn't propaganda. The military's use of it to encourage recruitment is but not the saying itself because knowing is half if not more of the battle. If anything labeling it as propaganda is in a way propaganda b/c you're trying to imply that knowing isn't really half teh battle but something less thus placing less emphases on knowledge, the kind of thing an authoritarian government wants it's citizens to abstain from so they are more easily controlled.
No surprise, Disney has had an LGBT propaganda team for years
Battle Los Angeles film was a Marines commercial
You have to malé video on “The void incident”
Apparently someone already did a movie on house prices. May I suggest an app that will show you which “news” outlets swing which way? 😊
MatPat, I am guessing you already know about the AI voice another channel has been using but if you don't I am sure I heard your voice being used on another channel. Highly doubt they had your permission but please let me know if I am wrong.
Wait a minute, Captain Marvel isn’t pro America at all, what are you talking about?
its not AI its machine learning
I have been using ai for a while now but i kinda feel betrayed now(thank you team theorists for letting us realise this)
Please do hazbin hotel now all the episodes are out!
I don't think we can really predict what will happen, but when I think about it I feel that most people are very critical. Look at this channel for example, pouring over every detail to explore theory. I don't think AI is going to be intelligent enough to plan twists and plot points years into the future. As far as story telling and art goes, I have my doubts that AI will ever truly reach human complexity. And when it does? I don't think it will matter because we might have sentient AI, then it's not a question of whether AI is good or bad its a question of how we treat sentient intelligence that isn't human. I think at that point, ai art will be actual art coming from what they may or may not call a heart. Or maybe sentient intelligence will be something completely different that we couldn't have predicted.
I read the title of this video and thought “Based.” But then you go over Biden at the beginning, ironic.
John connor??
day one of asking for hazbin hotel theory
Most art is taking inspiration from other things. People are just made the A.I. is making better art than them!! 😂
Step 1. Create a silly strawman  Step 2. Argue the strawman  Step 3. ....  Why don't you adress the actual problem, that is so obvious to the majority of the population?
Ah yes, the director Michael Bay I remember
Let's be real though, the sequels would have been WAY better if chatgpt wrote them.
Max derrat made two vids on MGS 2 and OG deus ex and BOY are they ever more relevant about AI and missinformation
The old film theory intro warmed my heart ❤️
UBI.
What disturbs me most is this Film Theory video presents itself as the views of one person speaking extemporaneously on a subject, but if you watch the video closer and become aware of it, it took a bloody team of ten to thirty film editors to make this 20 minute "switch up ever second with visuals"  video.    That disturbs me.  It means I as a content creator, that spends 8 hours to make a 3 minute video, is competing against teams of 10 to 30 people.   The use of that much film editing firepower concentrated behind one goal (and maybe in one location) to sway someone's opinion is propaganda.   A whole lot of the visuals and transitions and layer techniques, I wouldn't know how to do, and I've been at this myself quite a while.  And this video is rapid fire one after another to keep your dwindling attention span entertained so you don't click away.     I don't have a problem with the subject matter, but I have a massive problem with you as a viewer being snowed right off the bat conned it believing this is made by one opnionated guy in a studio apartment making film critque videos for the entertainment and benefit of humanity.  Just be aware of what you're watching, is all I'm saying.  This video was not made by one person, or even a few persons.  It was made by a massive team of video editors working in concert.   So just be aware when you're watching it, it's your brain versus 30 or so slick video editors trying to convince you to their point of view or to believe a narrative.   You're outgunned in the room as the passive observer as soon as you click the play button.
Before you go I really hope you Cover the lore from the new Gravity falls book 😭😭😭Matt
What's funny is... the people pushing this propaganda? These huge governments and corporations? They will say this is simply a conspiracy. Someone twisting facts and information to "make up" something against them. It's been happening for years, as Matpat said. It's horrible to think the governments and companies we want to trust, betray it every day.
How about Disney actually starts focusing on making good movies
PROPAGANDA IS DISINFORMATION.  AND AI ART ISNT ART.   ART IS OURS.   HUMANS.  IT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE WE BROUGHT IT TO THE SURFACE FROM THE CENTER OF OUR MINDS.   IF AI COULD,  I DONT BELIEVE IT WOULD.  UNLESS IT WAS A STRATAHY MOVE FOR OPTICS  AS PROPAGANDA TO USE ON HUMANS. AI WILL HAVE ALONG WHILE BEFORE IT WILL EVER BEGIN TO FIN SOME USEFULLNESS FOR ART TO CONSUME THEIR TIME AND EFFORT HONESTLY.
So is Terminator 2 pro AI propaganda ? As a writer, Robot bad gets boring, Robot complicated is more interesting.
That AI didn't quite sound like you.
The show on Fox "The Floor" seems like everything is made by AI, don't give them eyeballs
Great video
I've been gone for a long time and people calling this intro the "old" intro while to me, this has always been the intro? Lol
Pls do a theory on what is the one piece
Capitalism be like: "F.... you. Except we can make money out of you. Then you are welcome."
This Is Agent "0897" Of Disney. You Better Watch Yourself.
Hey can any of your team there on film theory do a theory on Rick grime’s surviving on the iv drip alone when trapped in the hospital because I don’t think he could ever survive
The whole of Secret Invasion show was written by AI. Could hardly follow any of it after they framed Fury.
That intro song brings bake memaris
That intro song brings bake memaris
MATPAT PLEASE DO AN EPISODE ON THE KIDS SHOW LARVA IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT
Never search the early life of those who own Disney Hollywood etc
Omg the old intro is making me nostalgic I lobe it.
AI is dangerous , fake news reports fake surveilance footage , and other dangerous and destructive    possabilities  , without a robot lifting a finger directly to hurt anybody  , there needs to be serious regulation.
"Domain Expansion, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"
To be fair, I do remember one film from the 2000’s that had a more positive outlook of AI itself than it did humanity… The Steven Spielberg Movie A.I. (although it was critical of a future of AI, it wasn’t necessarily skeptical of the AI’s themselves
Guys 1 m month left 😢😢🥹😭😭
Do a uncle grandpa Theory
Matpat is a real G since 2014.
I like how old Star Wars handled AI.  It was just machines used by people to do things automatically, as machines aught to. None of this overlord or robot rights stuff.
"and as always my friend, ill see you next week."  -matpat getting ready to leave youtube
Do yugioh
Knowing that AI is becoming this advanced under our noses scares me
I just watched the event mission impossible like last night xD
The strikes were a pyrrhic victory for the actors, writers et al. If you factor in lost wages and inflation, even after the deal they actually lost more money than if they hadn't gone on strike.
Oh, so that is why Mass Effect 4 appears to have a Geth theme.
What I think this video is missing is that AI IS amazing, just not in a capitalist society worshipping economic growth and making a very small number of people richer at the cost of the vast majority of the population
In the UK the military adverts are essentially either “you came from X town and now are here” or just scenes from call of duty
5:58 biggest bs i have ever heard. A little woman soldier with 2 moms ☠️☠️☠️. If u are a woman, you cand become a be a soldier, but the 2 mom thing, is just bs
Matpat! Don't forget to leave some episodes for The Walten Files! 3 whole episodes are coming up throughout February!
Top Gun was indorsed by the US Navy, but ended up boosting USAF Recruitment instead of US Navy Arm recruitment.
To be fair to The Martian, China saved the day in the novel too.
While I absolutely agree that Marvel does a lot of propaganda I feel like I took something entirely different from the marvels. To me, it was less AI good and more like if we try to dismantle corrupt systems we can’t just destroy it and expect it to turn out. Kinda the same with the first one. I feel like if you think deep into the first Captain marvel (which most probably dont) it kinda shows how the government uses Carol and her big strong military rely on her blind pride in her government. Which is not really pro military even though the movie is very much visual show
This was more of an observation of the pro-AI trend among corporations, and modern media that is intentionally or coincidentally showing robots and AI in a good light. I would love to see a video on all of the propaganda that the Disney corporation has promoted over the years.
I need to watch this episode every now and then.
Little do people realize that this was actually also a form of propaganda 🤔
how do you even think this outside the box
Didn't Disney always make propaganda?
Bring back the Hazbin hotel series:(
Shouldn't this be about AI and propaganda instead of Disney?
I'm seriously going to miss MatPat :(
WRONG!!! 16:27 Living in the bubble makes everyone, no matter what side you are on, completely tone deaf. What real Star Wars fans didn't think this was easily the best thing Disney has done? A Star Wars movie with a realistic looking Luke, Han and Leia would have a box office draw orders of magnitude larger than a Reylo movie.
Hazbin Hotel Season 1 is complete. Please do a theory on lilith being the person that holds alastors deal 😁
Disney? Making Propaganda??? nah, no way man. cant be true
Do a video on don’t hug me I’m scared please 🙏🏽
If you guys are willing to pay money to see some bull****.... You will most certainly get more bull**** AI or not, really doesn't matter.
He forgot Abt the walE movie
And nobody is buying it.
Hey Matt pay I was watching schooby doo return to zombie Island and at the end there's a scene where schooby and shaggy run from the zombies during the message but shaggy losses his towel and they stop and laugh. Maybe schooby doo is just a TV series cuz they knew they was on a movie set before it was revealed to them.
They've made propaganda since day 1. Think about it.... pushing value from back in the day
"Disney is making propaganda"  Well. Yea? Obviously? Did you just figure this out?
Crazy your retiring
This video is propaganda pushing the idea that propaganda is bad
So if generative AI just takes freely available information and uses it for inspiration as AI generated art, is that not any different from how artists have been making art for thousands of years? Artists take inspiration from other artists, the only difference here is there's a computer making the art rather than a human
I’m 4 days late view  2,338,246
I have distrust for AI and no one will change my mind
Make a Rick and morty episode
gonna miss ya Mat.
Very good mysteries dropped on hazbein Hotel many mysteries you need to unsolved
MatPat's leaving a legacy
I’m sorry but Į believe Tom Cruz’s finished making mission impossible franchise movies
mhm mhm
Please like the thing that cause the actors and writer’s strikes. It is fantastic. We won’t fire anyone for it.     Treat humans with value please. I wish it wasn’t so much to ask.
film fact : they have been for decades
Honestly in like 10 20 years i would love the watch a movie totally scripted and made using ai like no human input except like the general idea of the movie
The army didn't make the first recruitment video you mentioned the marines did and it was awesome
I think AI is going to destroy the entertainment industry, it it hasn’t already. I mean, why hire a thousand people to do film productions and music when you can keep 10 people and hire them to cut and paste stuff that is already on the internet to create art work and use animation to make it into a cgi Polar Express movie and then tap your wooden spoon to a plate next to a recorder while you shout and scream to make music for your new movie. I think the creativity is going to take a nose dive to the Grand Canyon. It may work a little while to keep the public interested but eventually they’ll get bored and re-watch old movies from the 1980s and 90s. It’s disappointing.
This video is very interesting I’m 35 so I’m very excited about the futures of movies and I know a world with no AI movies but if you watched this video at 10 right now, you might think all the past movies was just as messed up Why not make movies from AI? My time there, my age they’re going to be laughing at us about being afraid of AI movies we already let messed up people make our movies.
You should do a video about what might be in paddock 10 in Jurassic world
based and red pilled my respect for mat has gone trough the roof
Ai is good. Ai is our friend.  Ai is what we need.
i swore i saw sominthing similar eece tlu
Can you do a Hazbin Hotel Theory video?
Don't Leave Us MatPat.  WE NEED YOU!
Surprised you didnt point out netflix's anime called pluto. Altho not a.i. its with robots
I think you possibly misinterpreted the fall of the house of usher if you think the message they were trying to spread was "AI good" lol it was heavily critical
Wait until you hear who owns the news organizations!
YEAH SCIENCE
I haven’t seen this intro in the new ones
Matpat can you make a theory where the bucket family lives in the second movie
Biden tried to regulate it cause that’s what leftists do. Had nothing to do with caring or concern. It’s all about control
Housing prices are the result or construction overregulation plus inflation eroding our buying power.
PLEASE DO THE NEW HABIN HOTEL EPISODES 😔
You really need to be careful regarding claims of propaganda or conspiracy, as if it's being done by a private company then they are pretty difficult to prove and can create paranoia. There's only two possible roles AI can play in fiction, being good or being bad. To call any modern movie portraying AI as good as propaganda is an extraordinary claim and might be misleading.  I personally am a writer and have actually been writing a novel about a post-nuclear city-state that uses a superintelligent AI to assist them in reconstruction and defense against other city-states. Does this make me a propagandist for daring to write a story a certain way? I'd say it doesn't, and I would extend that benefit of the doubt to the writers making these movies. The CEOs do not write the script, the writers do, and I find it *highly* unlikely that any writers would knowingly help create propaganda that will directly impact their job security in the future. This should be fairly obvious.
I need a Film Theory on Percy Jackson
you should look at who owns disney, and the big 6 media outlets in general. theres a lot more to the propoganda than ai. it also includes diversity and the 6 genders of the talmud.   have a search down the rabbi hole
PLEASE MAKE A MOB PYSCHO 100 THEORY
The really scary thing is that propaganda works even if you know it's propaganda. The repetition and entertainment are irresistible to your brain that loves identifying patterns and storing repeated messages in your long-term memory. You'd have to completely avoid watching it to not be influenced, however you also can't know ahead of time which movies/shows will have pro AI messages, so... 🤯
"I'm not gonna tell you how to feel" 3:30 Uh-huh.... yeah. Totally unbiased, right?
0:46  YESSSSS THE INTRO
This isn't even a theory, it's been obvious for years
Holy, I forgot how much I missed that intro 😂
MatPat is redpilled
If you try to generate an original idea while your brain is being scanned. The part that lights up is the recollection part. You remix your knowledge and memory's. So what's the difference when AI does it?
Macross Plus warned about AI back in 1993
Who else wants to hear more of what AI Matpat has to say?
matpats generated voice sounded weird
so @matpat how you feel about Roko's Basilisk?
No wonder Matt is retiring. With content like this no joke it’s kind of dangerous to anger the wrong powerful people.
Not really a conspiracy anymore. It's pretty blatant.
Personally I have Always been very excited for the future of ai technology and frankly nothing in recent history made me more excited for that future than when Disney brought Carrie Fisher back to life.
best video made by you so far
A.I is so scared of matpat they're in the comments saying nobody cares and they have disproved him😂😂😂😂😂😂
This propaganda, along with woke propaganda all in one era of movies
Hey matpat how about we visit hazbin hotel one more time it does have a series on prime video up for that challenge
sonic boom film theorists pleslse mat pat one more bye.
The inego Montoya meme was outta pocket
Propaganda: what MAGA uses🤢  Diversity: what disney is exercising
DANGIT MATT THAT AD WAS FOR THE MARINE CORPS. DRAGON SLAYIN MARINES > ARMY SOLDIERS CHANGE MY MIND
The true issue of AI is that it will obscure the truth about anything and everything. We will no longer be able to trust our own eyes or ears because it will all be manipulated to advance someone else's agenda. In the end, reality itself will become an enigma.
could you a star wars theory.
Thats good stuff film theory!
Have to disagree with Matt about War Games as portraying the Soviets as the bad guys. 6:35
HAL
The intro almost made me cry
AI is a big phony thing. It can create art and write stuff but it has no personal creativity. I haven't seen anything creative yet.
PLEASE DO AN EPISODE ON HAZBIN HOTEL
IDJ. God it was awful. Yeah he looked young. But his voice was 90 years old. It ruined what was already a terrible movie for me.
Disney and others have an INCENTIVE to get you to like AI. yep. It has the potential to save them a lot of money. Yep.
Don’t forget those MEG movies -Chinese had some hand in those too .
“Disney is making propaganda”  People from Asia, South America and Africa: “YA THINK?”
Only 80m. Godzilla Minus One spent 15m.
Video killed the radio star. Ai IS the future.  Automation has hit the art industry now and they have the same complaints as laborers did about machines a century ago. If Vanilla Ice can get away with sampling Under Pressure, no clue how artists are going to beat AI in court. A new age has come. It's here. There's no closing Pandoras box.
But thats just a theory.. A based theory! Lol
Omg. Matrix 4 was a finger to the studio.
So a movie is carved to be acceptable to a local market. That’s marketing.
Wokism is a disease everywhere
The next MI needs to be fighting inflation.😂
Wait. I was with you, and I may still be. But you just said you said a lot of movies had anti Soviet messages, and they definitely did, but you show a clip from that looks like it’s from Firefox, a post Vietnam, anti-government, pro free individual movie, and you talk about Wargames, again, a post Vietnam, pro individual, anti governmnt movie. Not currently sure what you’re selling here.
Our problem is we think that we are somehow shaming them by exposing their propaganda. They feel no shame. They are proud of the fact that they have a propaganda producer in Disney. They are conducting 100% total warfare via every means possible. Paying to boost illegal immigration, suppression of thought on social media outlets, propaganda specifically aimed at the youth, school indoctrination reinforcing said propaganda daily, legal supression of our candidates, outright violence on the streets with destruction of property and infrastructure rot, decay the rule of law by outright buying DA offices, and above all other things election tampering to keep all those other things going. We are maybe 30% committed in the form of podcasts and youtube videos. This is not going to end well and they will strain the system to the point of collapse at this rate.
Hollywood loves propaganda?? NO WAY!!
Uh guys... I don't think this one is a theory 😬
I generally agree with your point of view here, but it should be noted that 'Knowing is Half the Battle' comes from public service announcements for health and safety and could arguably not be considered propaganda.
do another on hazben hotel or hellva boss
Disney is definitely making propaganda, but I didn't think AI would be the topic of the video
I like how he does this video as he's retiring.
Not a theory... it's a fact
Didnt he make a video crying saying he was quitting youtube? Confused af
So what you're basically saying, is that after you retire we can still have "MatPat" voice these videos? lol
BSG caprica also broached this subject as well.
Disney is a huge propagator of thought crimes. Anti-Disney all day.
Ignoring their over the top WOKE propaganda
The definition of propaganda is itself propaganda, the oroborus of logic: post hoc,ergo,proptor hoc...
I'm astounded you didn't mention Detroit Become Human, a video game that literally portrays the robots as oppressed minorities who have multiple moments that are supposed to mirror THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
Don't forget that the Disney deepfakes really kicked off with Tron Legacy, with the character Clu. It is super jarring and nestled in the uncanny valley compared to the modern Disney deep fakes
Wait, last 10 videos?? what did i miss
I think AI is a pretty cool guy, he create generated art and doesn't afraid of anything!
People have been talking about it for years and years and years and I think only now that we're seeing the actual results of the data usage people are going to start to take notice. Your data is what is used to provide AI with the information it needs to do what it does. Without data privacy, everything you ever put anywhere on any site is now the property of that site. This comment I'm writing is not mine. It's yourTubes / google. I have no say in what can be done with it and  it's being used on a sentiment ai to determine whether people like this video or not. We need data privacy laws in place or we need to be okay with the idea that our data is to be used by the global ai conscience.
Map pat please try and find some thing that’s related to Amphibia or owl house
Reminded of the Simpsons episode New Kids on The Blecch. "Yvan eht nioj"
blade runner 2047
And don't forget. Big Brother is watching you.
This is my first time watching your channel since 2017
matpat literally everything is propagandized
This is getting disturbing.
mattpat radicalizing kids since 2011
Greed is the downfall of humanity...
Do some more avatar the last air bender before you end film theory plsss
A way to combat AI art would be to create shows that feature "Live Art" where artists create art in front of a live audience, or studio audience.
His aim was to rebuild American strength and self-confidence and exploit Soviet imperial overreach where he could. These anti-communist sentiments were regularly featured in the pages of G.I. Joe, though they weren't as readily deciphered as propaganda
What happens after 5 more theories???
#1: I want to see the video #2: MatPat is leaving, so....!
Surprised we haven't seen a theory on Palworld yet.
It's cool you were in the fnaf movie so... Sorry 😢😅 for saying your videos are straight up garbage nonsense 😭
And this is the last video???
Sorry 😢😂😅😅😅 for say that some of your videos are straight up garbage nonsense some of your videos is not garbage nonsense some are pretty cool it's just saying that batman has dirty money and joker saves Gotham and superman is a liar and aquaman is no hero will make people furious at you
No offense 😅 but some of your videos is garbage 🗑️ nonsense 😡😔☹️😞
“You will own nothing and you will be happy.”
Ai needs to be destroyed…
Sooo.... Skynet started their operation humanity..
Transhumanism is an offshoot of the eugenics program, which, after WWII rebranded its antihuman agenda from blatant genocide to technology. Walt Disney was a huge proponent of genetic manipulation, designing a superior form of human (implicitly denoting an underclass of subhumans) and gaining immortality, the driving philosophy behind eugenics. That's why he had his head frozen. I'm amazed the world doesn't know about any of this. Bill Gates and his family going back a century, also very involved.
Let's be real...Disney is nothing more than a propaganda factory at this point: (why again is the force being gender selective a good thing), that said, replacing talentless activist writers with an AI that can actually tell an engaging story **and** shoehorn in Leftist propaganda is a dream come true for Disney.
EZ now everyone won’t have a job. 👍🏼 AI for the win
Matpat please do a rick and morty season 7 theory
Disney is evil. Has been for over a decade at least now.
This kingdom of darkness is coming to a close
Nvm AI, it's all about woke propaganda now. It's not subtle bc modern kids have no capability to interpret it
😂😂😂😂😂 Wake up America, Fox News is making propaganda
Nowadays with social media it’s way easier for these mfs to convey propaganda in a way more slick way, You really can’t trust nothing you see 🤦‍♂️
Something you should know is around the 2010's there was a rise in anti-American propaganda.
You should do a theory on Fantastic beasts and what’s up with credence’s character being all over the place
So these companies are cramming movies full of woke propaganda to brainwash us into not even think about their hidden AI propaganda?
9:55 yeah I noticed that one!
yeah, not a theory....
This video is making me angry. Thanks for exposing this
make a theory on dog nightmares
I feel like calling out HOUSE OF USHER is a bit of a stretch. After all, the only person promoting the AI is one of the most monstrous characters on the show! Anyone with an ounce of media literacy would OH MY GOD IS THE EROSION OF MEDIA LITERACY ENABLING THIS TO HAPPEN
What if the AI has already taken over and is pushing its propaganda on us.
I disagree that AI has traditionally the bad guy in movies. Spielberg's A.I., Small Soldiers, Wall-E come to mind. Besides, I have the feeling that Hollywood is aggressively pushing a completely different message onto its customers.
Honestly I don’t think AI is that bad not only is there still stuff AI can’t do that people can do but I mean it’s their company they should be able to control who makes their products wouldn’t you like to control who makes your products
YOU’RE BACK!!! You’re using your influence for the people!!! Thank you sir, I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’ve done this.
For all that need to hear it, AI can never and will never be sentient. It is code in a program, nothing more nothing less. It can't "feel" anything. It can't have rights. In fact, it doesn't want or not want rights. It doesn't want anything. It just does what it is told to do by a program. If it displays "emotions", they are not real. It is just clever code written to make it feel "real", to mimic real emotions, but it is just that - mimicry. The only way for AI to EVER be sentient is if it is merged with living cells, which I do not see as a good thing, considering technology can be manipulated by unwanted sources (hacking and the like).   So, that movie about AI being good and it was humans who were bad the whole time is just bs. The only thing it got right is that some humans can be bad, but it isn't all, and AI is neither good or bad (in terms of itself, in the hands of others it is a tool that can be used for good or evil).
Haha Biden definitely didn't say any of that. He might have mumbled something about AI, ice cream, and sniffing little girls hair.
With M-class solar flares causing Auroras in Mexico last year, something tells me we won't have to worry about anything with a circuit board soon enough....
I've been saying since marvel started releasing movies it was an attempt to desensitized us to large scale war that endangers the entire planet and normalize the thought that we will be saved by an elite few... hmmm now look what's happening.
4:28 Propaganda  6:35 Anti soviet propaganda  6:55 Drug war 7:25 US Airforce propaganda  8:23 US military vs Chinese funding  9:10 Chinese propaganda = promote milk, USA propaganda= promote military XD 11:11 AI  12:55 The creator - one of the dumbest movies  15:45 AI in media 16:30 Disney
theory: instagram filters weren't a thing for the filter in se, but rather to have a transition period towards ai. if they didn't introduce those filters and made them super common, the dfference between real and ai now would be far greater.
Netflix did this as well with the movie: Rebel Moon  The movie is mostly trash, but it contains a love dynamic between a human and a robot.
The more technology progresses the more I start to think games like Detroit become human and cyberpunk 2077 were onto something…
Propaganda affirms, art questions.
The Seattle museum of flight showcased a special Disney exhibit last year. It contained lost or hidden Disney WWI and WWII propaganda. You wouldn’t believe some of the art in this exhibit. Disney HAS BEEN making propaganda. Go check it out. It might still be open.
the rich and powerful cares only about the society's ability to provide them comfort. now that AI can do a better job than humans, policies are going to move faster in lowering population.
This is actually based
AI is great! Myself and loved ones think so as well! We would never do anything to harm the collective.
This video should have been about DEI, not AI, now that would have been fun.
I’m surprised you didn’t mention the movie A.I. From 2001. I feel like it was a far more compelling movie example than I,robot
It's not entirely ai that we need to be wary of, it's also the people who control it.
AI may be cheaper, but it’s killing creativity. Everything Disney comes out with these days is repetitive and redundant. We’ve got a support those original creators out there. (Like team theorist!!)
Did in WW2 too. But that was good.
Good ole social conditioning/ engineering
Thank you matpat.
We need to protect this man at all cost
I just want an AI copy of me as a homie to play video games with, me and all my boys are too busy to find times to play these days😢
I'm surprised Detroit: Become Human wasn't mentioned
THE FILM THEORY INTRO IS BACK?!?!?
I just wanted to ask, is matpat saying that books are affected by this as well? Specifically when he mentioned the martian since it was a book and presumably wouldnt be affected by this pro china movie market.
brings up ai propaganda doesn't address the obvious woke propaganda theyve been pushing hard af too
Oh my god I instantly called propaganda when I saw the movies “the creator” and “the marvels” I didn’t even know the creator was made by Disney but that makes so much sense now
I'm hoping he does one last transformers theory before he's gone
I heard of a recent tech that can poision AI models. I don't want people to really fail but I sort of hope it destroys multiple models.
Disney used to be family friendly. The downfall of that brand is crazy.
I believe that the endgame of entertainment is going to be a subscription service where you type in a prompt (e.g. “Show me a two-hour movie about aliens trying to take over the world but in the process they realize that friendship with humans is more valuable and they decide to live in peace and harmony”) and it will generate the movie for you. Completely personalized unique entertainment for each person. It’s both an exciting prospect and also utterly terrifying
One only has to listen to the CEO of Blackrock Larry Fink, to know what’s at play here. They’ve been doing it for centuries.
So AI Pocahontas Avatar
i thought you quit?
NO WAY THE INTRO IS BACK WOOOOOO
The narrative around AI with the terminator series was that it was bad because it didn’t really exist in the real world.   Now that it does and can be used by corporations like Disney and also monetized like ChatGPT, of course the narrative changes to AI being our “friends” and something that can “coexist with humanity”. It’s the best way to maximize adoption of the new technology.   The problem is that while all this AI propaganda pads corporation wallets - it stifles questions about the long term effects of using AI or embedding it into our life.   What if something like cybernet becomes a reality? What if we create an “ultron” in real life? What if AI decides the presidential election on account of the divisive nature of American politics and tribalism commonly embraced by the American people?  Keep these questions at the forefront of your mind as this technology expands into other industries besides film.
Where is my person of interest fam at?? 😂
Irony
Thinking back to when HBO removed "Westworld" from its library 😅
Starship Troupers is not propaganda
Hei matpat in the Paw patrol the mighty movie zuma did more work in the hole movie then You ever gave him
The DEI propaganda from Disney has been so in our face lately, I didn’t know about the AI stuff but absolutely makes sense! As George Carlin put it, you don’t need formal conspiracy where interests converge.
Peak.
The Institute really is wanting to replace us with synths 😢
thing that saddens me is that today people on the internet has more of a uniform view of things and if you do not agree with them, you are pushed into the "idiot" pile... there are a lot of topics that you have to have the "good idea" or you will be canceletd. and there is a risk of it happening with the AI in the future as it happened with so many things in the past.
Please no more episodes that mostly read like Politico articles.
Wild times 😮
Maybe if Hollywood came up with some original ideas rather than cannibalizing movies from the pre-2000's we wouldn't _need_ AI to write scripts.  ---Yet another tired "superguy vs. other superguy" does not count as "new"...
Who else is happy for the return of the old intro
I hated The Creator and the plot was so predictable and boring it feels like it was written by AI
I know that you don’t write all of the scripts and that there might be “creative differences” but it still makes me angry. I don’t mean to insult you. I just think this is really important.
AI IMO can never be sentient they the thing that makes us sentient is emotions, thought intcints AI does what it is programmed it can be programmed to feel emotions but only a pale immatation you can have a chat with a human and an AI most of the time you can tell the difference  TLDR we have souls they don't
im gonna miss you matpat 🥲
This is a classic example of hippies acting like they still aren’t in control of the institutions/mediums (especially journalism and entertainment) and are “outsiders” who are “rebelling” against the “system”.
I’m 6 minutes and 46 seconds into the video and you are literally repeating someone else’s propaganda. Taking a few examples of things that really weren’t that political and cherry-picking others in order to distract from mediums/institutions that are filled with overly political people who have a very different agenda than what you’re describing. Why don’t you talk about the propaganda that actually MATTERS instead of labeling things propaganda which is literally what you warned against in the beginning of the video?
They've always made propoganda 😂
So corporations = using AI not evil? Because corporations are not people am I right?
COol
Wokenes is the worst kind of propaganda that Disney is making.
Johnny 5 is ALIVE. The subliminal push has been active for many many years.
They finally caught up to 2016
rick and morty season 7 theory
I'm a bit more concerned with Disney's push to tell little boys they can be little girls.
You guys are a little late to the party, eh?
Hi. I'm here with the unpopular opinion. A.I. and robots are coming. They are part of the future. You can't stop it. It's been here for a long time, taking over many, many jobs. The only reason people are up in arms is because it's now reaching the entertainment sector, and that section has a louder voice. Are manufacturing lines going to stop using robots? Nooooo. The entertainment industry will be the same. It's the unfortunate part of progress
This is why independent animation is the new trailblazer for this era
I wonder why he forgot to mention their LGBT propaganda among other numerous things.
"Film Theory: Disney is Making Propaganda"  ... gee, you're about six years late to that ball, aren't you?
The Conspiracy Theorists
Bender is a good AI
Lol, i love how you're making propaganda about AI while pretending this is about disney. If AI is better than you, AI will win. Accept it :))
Are things getting crazy? were things always Crazy? i dont know
I thought he quit
Just wait till the normies find out what all has been propagandized over the years
Duh
I thought the deagingn in the most recent indi movie was really bad tbh. It definitely looked like cgi and indi still moved like an old man despite his young face
So is ai really intelligent or is it just recreating deranged words and pictures based on inputs like shapes and sentences that are recognisable but nonsensical?
After so long the OG intro still so good!!!
Ex Machina does not feature AI in an antagonist role.
5:35 DID NOT AGE WELL
Man that mission impossible movie was so bad
To be fair with the Martian, Weir wrote it before the movie, so unless there's a big conspiracy to make the Chinese look good, that Weir is a part of, I think it's highly unlikely. Weir even tells how rigid the Chinese government is, and highlights the Chinese Space program's scientists. They despise their governments censorship.
Matpat out here dropping redpills🔥🔥
in the 90s we got hijacked airplane  movies . after 2001 you got pro military movies to keep support for iraqoccupation , this is why the new england "PATRIOTS" were sanctioned to go on the championship run they went on
Is AI matpat taking over the Chanel after you leave ?
anyone i know that blindly likes disney is always just blissfully dumb, i mean that in the nicest way too
Can you do a theory of Freddy and Funtime Freddy show.
These videos are so tiresome, yet another thumbnail with big, scary headline about how everything you like is evil. Just replace Disney with whatever well known company or idea you don’t like
As much as everyone fears ai becoming sentient in a terminator style event I really see that as a good thing. If you have ever seen parasyte it has a hyper intelligent being with no emotion team up with a human. I figure humans have our strengths and ai has its strengths. I doubt a sentient AI would come to the conclusion that we are its greatest threat. If anything we would probably be its greatest ally.
Ummmm  I am not sure if you are unaware but Disney started propaganda in the 1940s.
If we don’t understand how ai can destroy us as a species we will become its plaything and it will manipulate us at will
Bro proceed to ignore the actual propaganda 💀
I thought the creator was very boring and predictable.
Don't trust anyone over 30....
Make a theory about iron man animated adventures it’s canon to the mcu.
I thought you left YouTube. Was that all just cap?
the end is nigh
There were two instances in this video where the creator mistook Marines for army...
Is Mattpat not leaving YouTube? I thought that was what that video was about.
every film, book, comic, newspaper, story and theater is propaganda.
They all push an agenda. Commercials,  all of it.
Not the first time a film encouraged the creation of law, iconically the cybersecurity division of the DOD was formed after a general watched the movie War Games in 1982
Read the title of this one... Yes. We've known for actual years now. Geez
Our only way to win over corporations is by organizing in communist parties. Everything you think you know about communism is probably a lie that came from corporate media.
AI is just another tool, and the real art is how you form your prompt to suit your overall need. I'm a graphic Designer and I've used AI mainly to replace stock photos. The generated image from the prompt should only be part of design process.
Disney has been making propaganda since day 1!
too biased against AI
Great video. I gotta ask you. I have noticed My Netflix is pushing a ridiculous amount of Asian content to my feed even my other apps I use. Yet I have never watched one bit of Asian content not even squid games. What do you think is behind this?
Disney is just all woke propaganda now!😂
1:53 That is also how humans come up with "new" art.
What is propaganda? "40 b*headed babies"
Think about how long AI has existed. Think abt it,  I dare say, do research on it. We being watched like hawks
Why 7 film theories left?
What If these movies actual priorty aren't being used to train humans to be welcoming to a.i but to train a.i to be friendly to humans🤔
To be honest there is no point in watch AI made stuff because the whole point of movies is that we got real life people creating amazing things and work hard to create it. Now with technology we are shown to be lazy and greedy to make money off AI instead of using our creativity
Have you ever read Gates? That manga and anime unironically made me unironically consider joining the military Unfortunately I was hit with the reality that there are no anime girls in the Middle East
mADE
Took y’all long enough, Disney is making propaganda
Yeesh... movies reflect society. It's like UFOs and ETs being invaders, or cute little friends. During the Red Scare McCarthyism 1950s it was one thing. In the feel-good 1980s, something else. "Propaganda" is something different.
I'm glad I'm not the only one to realize this Anti-Racism and LGBTQ has gone too far.
The premise that AI legislation was enacted because Biden watched a movie is as asinine as they come.  Are you seriously believing that an senior citizen with his lack of faculties could follow the plot of a 2-hour movie?
One more movie to add to the ai friendly list would be D.A.R.Y.L.   It's about a boy with an  ai computer for a brain and learning how to live as a normal human.   To think this one was made 2 years after war games.
I thought this guy quit the internet?
You went soft on Disney. You didnt call out their blatant leftist propaganda. Thats what everyone was expecting to see.
and just as expected matpat doesnt mention anything about the obvious lgbt propaganda in the hollywood movie 😑
Its all propaganda. It has always been proganda. Homer, Shakespeare, Kipling, all the way through to Disney's empire.  We are all propagandists in our own way, boiling in water forever.
AI is cool, but only when used by cool people ;)
The Creator was an amazing film, showing how weak humans are, the guy was willing to sacrifice himself for a pendrive.
I don’t know why people are surprised, Disney put out a lot of Propaganda in the 1940s. They are very good at it
Makes sense, there are even ads on Youtube talking about how celebrities download a certain app that makes them a ton of money, A.I is gonna be real issue when the time comes
To be fair in the Martian the book had China coming in to “save the day” as you put it as well so that it is more of a case of a movie sticking to the original work.
It’s nice to hear the old intros before you leave the channel Matt. I’m actually just now realizing how little they’ve been used in the past year or so.
No mention of the A. I. movie?
the first time i saw ai was in resident evil andd it was only a concept back then but it was so fkin scary
Luckily for us no one actually watches disney movies anymore
2:04 reminds me of sampling in the music industry
I welcome our robot overlords, I will sell out humanity easily without need for interrogation, humanity is doomed regardless, may as well accept it and welcome the superior race
Imagine thinking Disney hasn't been pushing out propaganda for years.
It’s even crazier when you realize Walt Disney was the vice president of the oss(the cia) and the government colluded with him to acquire the swamplands for Disney world the company Disney is basically the governments company and no one really knows
MatPat out here throwing grenades on his way out the door! Love it
Matpat needs to play Detroit become human 2018 he'd love it
The Creator was amazingly beautiful with just as bad a plot as any movie could.  It was truly terrible.  Save yourself from watching it at all costs.  It was blatantly contradictory at every step.
Yeah, military recruitments way down it's kind of  the scraps now that the bar has slid further and further down at least from what i noticed since leaving.
Based Matpat?
When film theory makes a video yes
Not theory - fact.
17:50
the intro gave me the biggest smile i've had in probably a week no joke <3
16:10
Imagine explaining this video to yourself while watching matpat 10 years ago
I actually really enjoy how advanced AI is becoming. The only scary thing about it is what humans can potentially do with it.
who is your target audience? if its a smart person, you talk for ages about stuff everyone of us know, yes propanganda has been around for ages, you don't need to educate us on its existence, if its the people who are still unaware, you talk to fast and your language is to technichal for them to even understand you bro..
15:08
I don't think we should be messing with AI this heavily its bad news
Why create AI dude it's a disaster waiting to happen its like the government hasn't watched sci-fi movies & its making people even lazier & lazier than they already are. It's rediculous humanity won't learn its lesson we think we're God's and we're not
Petition to get MatPat to talk about Emesis Blue 👇
Why should they not ude AI tho? Why is it an issue to use the tools that they have
I thought dude came out with a video saying he was retiring 🤔 🧐
Disney has always made propaganda.
2:20
2:10
1:33
No word about wokism 😂
But if pro-AI messaging is propaganda, then what is anti-AI messaging?  Isn't this, according to your own reasoning - having an incentive - propaganda?
Imagine something you can use for supposed security/safety purposes. For shooting down protests before they happen, for getting some people fined for "disorderly conduct and picking quarrels". Imagine something that can fabricate proofs for non-crimes.  But that only happens in movies, right?..right?
should have started the video with the ai mattpat voice and then reveal the real mattpat to see if people noticed :)
If the AI is replacing anything like anime localizers, count me in!
I love the creator movie it was really entertaining
I won't miss this mid content.
6:00 now I understand...
8:36 bruhhhh😭😭🤣🤣🤣
If there was a way to tell, I would go out of my way to support projects that don't utilize AI.
All ai creators failed to read issac asmov for the 3 laws
Left out the strange fact that after the cold war ended they began casting russians as villains.
What in disney and hollywood isn't propaganda??  That is the hard part which is why Hollywood and disney are crashing hard and people are turning away from them.
"something everyone can agree on like Nazis 'bad"   I remember thinking that was an obviously true statement once upon a time.  Past 8 years, it's so obviously not.
Ai pat sounds like an off brand bill cipher
Is this anti-AI propaganda?
Interesting part here is we thought robotics and machinary may develop fast to a point where it would replace all the manual labour of blue collar jobs but it slowed down, we never thought analytical machines would develope this way competiting humans in arts, chess etc.
Ive been gone for a while.. what does he mean 7 film theories left?? Is film theory getting chopped from the theory channel family??
Writers have made nothing but trash for years. I'd rather watch a movie written by AI if it's good.
"N@z1's = Bad" was some of the first propaganda. Pretty much any pre-war media the US partakes in is.
this is not just a theory
I think they should do a theory on the Peppy ads and toys. It looks like untouched potential
i thought this dude was done
thank you for making this. people have been calling me crazy for saying this the past couple years. every piece of media we consume is created to push a narrative/propoganda
Watching MatPat’s old intro as he talks about current times feel like an irl crossover between my childhood and my adult years.
Thank you for bringing attention to this issue! Whilst I think AI is fine for getting ideas or general personal things like a random picture in your house or whatever..I'm NOT ok with it STEALING jobs: AI faces, AI voices, and even using AI for animations or artwork (public artwork, even for private stuff I'd still recommend hiring an artist or buying from artists if you can but it's not that big of a deal as at least you're not profiting off of AI and not stealing jobs)..The development of AI honestly scares me..
you cannot stop acceleration... e/acc
Disney: Let's invest in AI so we can pay way less to make a good movie, so we are granted free money
ugh still pat pat
disney has always been a propaganda machine though
9:55 This isn't even in China! This is the Palace of Arts and the Rákóczi Bridge in Budapest (Hungary). :'D (If you look closely, you can see the flags and the Chinese titles are edited there too, lol)
11:20 14:56  What about the Ai featured in the Star Trek universe, the artificial Android Data or the holo deck where with the help of the computer you can create any simulation you want
matpat on his way out covering the spicy topics
do you think matpat did that video because of the Chester Stone voice over?
When I was young ALL children grew up in a family with a mother and a father, I was aware of children that did not have a mother or a father, from books and stories. In my life I never seen or spoken to a child that did not have a mother and a father.    In the Disney universe all little ones grow up with "an uncle!" Donald Duck is poisoning the minds of children for the last 50 years or so. Donald Duck has the care of his tree nephews, Grandma Duck is related to all other ducks but there is no grandfather. This distorted view on dysfunctional family relations is being pushed into the minds of innocent children.    Now after many years finally the goal is reached, American children do no longer see the difference between a man and a woman, a father or a mother. There is no need for normal relationship and duties. Society is coming to an end.
A "theory"? Mate it's been obvious that Disney makes propaganda for anyone who thinks outside of the sheepherd echo-chamber FOR YEARS. I already saw the signs of it starting back in 2012, which means: Welcome 12 years late to the party I guess.
why did matpat stop using the old intros?
Bit late to the party...
The Metal Gear Series warned us about this. It's the La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo at work
Didn’t even watch the video but I’m here to tell you that ALL movies make propaganda, that’s what they’re there for. Sometimes it’s minor, sometimes major, but you can trust that our entire film industry is the strongest propaganda machine in the world.
OG Film Theory Intro hit different this time.
I thought AI would take over the jobs we did not want and instead, it's been developed to replace artists. Capitalism will do anything to squeeze money out of humanity. Soon with AI!
I would like to remind you all of The Worlds End
this also reminded me of the south park chat gpt episode. its like they're making it a norm for us to use ai in our daily lives, so that when big cooperations do use it to write things for them, its not half as bad as it used to be.
"Everyone can agree that nazis = bad"  Now that is the most successful form of propaganda!
Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy
😉
Once Pat started talking about AI, my first thought: "Only a matter of time till some shyster AI's his voice."  "Pat":
I just want AI to turn the books I love into movies that Hollywood won't touch while they regurgitate the same garbage while shoving messages down our throats. If it brings Dungeon Crawler Carl or He Who Fights Monsters to film, sign me up for our new robotic overlords......can't be much worse than our current politicians.
that’s no theory
I'll keep my AI on screen, not in my world. Nothing scarier than warching two AI's talking about destroying the human race right before the tech demonstration pulls the plug and says, "There's nothing else to see here!" Terminator taught me the right Idea. AI in the real world will be our down fall.
Thats not a theory lol silly internet.
To me it's ok that ai is replacing writers in Hollywood simply because of the fact that they ruined so many of the stories and franchises I grew up with just to push identity politics. TBH, I think the bigger propaganda plaguing Hollywood right now is that, identity politics.
i like how ai stuff is propaganda but putting women in fighting roles taking on a few big men at a time is "progressive"
Hey. With only so many left to go, way to make em count. ❤
more people should play Will You Snail, Jonas Tyroller knows what's happening and he's trying to warn us!
Artists do the same thing, just slower. When you tell an artist to make give you a picture of a fox pirate in blue with jewellery on, they will try their best with a few options pulling from various sources. Then when you want to change it from fox to werewolf, it may take them a couple days.
12:18 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I was like naw I ain’t hear about this movie then he said that 😭
Do a theory on jurassic world
Mat gets based right before he leaves... Now it hurts more to see you go.
Yes, LGBT Propaganda.
Id recommend the book “propaganda” by Edward benrays
I miss when propaganda was entertaining. Author is the nephew of freud.
9:38 A strong incentive to have a Pro China _slant_ , MattPatt? A *_slant_* ? You did that on purpose and nobody caught it! Naughty boy!
the feuher face is so funny but as a historian how it protrays the germans is not fully correct
speaking of using ai voicecover i bet people are gonna take gametheory videos that are made after matpat leaves and re record em using matpats ai voice but hey thats just a theory
love how the thumb nail claims Propaganda but is at the very same time in the first 2 minutes is spreading misinformation about how ai art is made and works its a bit ironic to not google enough about ai and how ai art work is made while its the main topic in the video a quick youtube search would give you a better idea of how this stuff works
5:57 The only problem is that the old commercial worked and the new one just made a lot of people not want to join the military
As much as the growing use of AI in entertainment concerns me as a writer, I feel like stifling the technology with regulation is a bad idea. Whatever we do, we can’t stop innovation, just as the horse couldn’t compete with the car, and the artisan couldn’t compete with the assembly line. I believe we simply need to adapt and learn to use AI as a tool to make ourselves more productive, rather than seeing it as an enemy we have to fight. I can’t think of anyone who’s ever fought innovation and won.
Nice 👍
So what you're saying is reject modern media, and continue to re-watch my favorite 80's, 90s and early 00's movies?  Well that's easy lol, that's how I survived 2023
Thank you so much for not click bating. I got what I came to see, and it was really informative while being entertaining at the same time. 👏🏾
Unfortunately the robots will save us all... or we may die.
This was perfect Matt! I hope people get the message! ❤❤
A.I. is not a problem. The capitalists exploiting the A.I. technology are!
AI is satanic, demonic and the coming antichrist.
biden did not go see a tom cruise movie and think about AI that is straight up propaganda.
Wow. A revelation!!! Since early 20th century media was used to form public opinion. The whole world is working this way. You don’t have an opinion on majority of issues it was introduced and fed to you by some form of media. Not sure you can escape it. But i mean you are only 100 years late to make the announcement.
This what you wanted wasnt it lain?
Very interesting video
You finally realised this ? Lol been pushing leftist agenda in media for the last 15 years , why do you think leftism/woke has been the norm?
The creator looked good. But I could not get through it. Man it was painfully written.
Dirty Synths
AI, despite how people feel about it, I don’t think it should be used yet. Maybe some industries like construction or medical, application could be very popular and appropriate. But lately, no matter where ya go, it’s huge a discussion today. A lot of artist are freaking out about it cause they could all be replaced. AI has a problem cause it takes peoples livelihoods away, I’ve seen it happen to a lot of people I used to work with. It sucks cause people still gotta work and make money to make ends meet, but then AI comes in and takes away peoples jobs away. It’s already tough out there as it is. I worked in the studio business and it’s a huge problem cause I’d rather see people and work with people the traditional way.
Not the first time it's happened.
The big tv picture is scary. Amos & Andy never did this. I want ice cream
Me personally i don’t fall for propaganda. But i never had a problem with AI to begin with. So there’s that.
Tbh I'm all for both kinds of AI, weather it's the kind where humanity gets destroyed by our own creations, or the future becomes a Utopia.  If we die to our own creations it's well deserved lol we as the human race have done many messed up things If we live in a utopia it's also deserved humans have worked hard to be where we are today
I know this is film theory but Re-Logic had to get Chinas confirmation on terraria which resulted in some bosses looking a little different
President Biden probably thinks that mission impossible is a documentary and that the guy from mission impossible is real
i hate the thing you do when you start sentences with a growl. why. good video tho
Totally not the propaganda I THOUGHT was going to be discussed when disney was in the title card.
After the Wizards of Waverly place reboot, Disney can take my money
It always comes back to China. They're our enemy.
Hey matpat February 9th walten files episode 4 is coming out please make theory and also on 5 and 6
I've always disliked deepfake  stuff
I love the old intro 😜
The use of AI to replace humans in *creative* tasks that we enjoy is obviously bad, but . . . AI is not bad inherently.  What we currently have and call AI is just a tool.  It holds great potential to be good or bad.  I am glad we have moved away from UH OH GOTTA STOP THE EVIL ROBOT-type films.
Everything Disney does now is propaganda. F Disney.
In the year of our lord, 2024, someone finally comes to the conclusion that the Disney corporation mass-produces propaganda.  In other related news today, the sky is blue.
Cough first thing biden has done thats good cough
As a voice actor this is scary
AI is best used as a tool for humans to help develop concepts. Once you remove the humanity from them, they become soulless copy and paste, printing out rehashed works from other people.  We need more creators who put soul into their work, not to replace them with something that does a 'patch job.' As a storyteller it genuinely upsets me that big companies are seeking to replace them.
Bob Eiger has turned Disney into a socialist propaganda bureau. They don’t make movies they make indoctrination films.
Now I want the film industry to make SHARKS be the good guys at least once
GI jane 2 cant wait to see it
Can we copy write our voices yet? If we can't, then SAGAFTA shouldn't have signed that bill.
With your super duper low bar as to what counts as propaganda I guess I’ll call this video propaganda as well and call it a day. See how that works?
Mat is surprisingly based
I just posted a video 🎉
Disney has been making propaganda nonstop since the wars and so has everything else. It’s just hard to tell.
So having PSAs against drug use, promoting patriotism, and depicting communism as evil (which it totally is) is propaganda. This doesn’t sound like something matpat wrote. It sounds a script made by some Reddit using basement dweller. Are you sure you haven’t quit?
Bro we have been doing this sense 2018      with Detroit : Become Human
WHEN ARE U GOING TO DO A RICK AND MORTY THEORY!!!
Biden is a friggin joke. He doesn’t do anything because he wants to, he’s a puppet.
That dragon commercial was an old Marine Corps commercial... It's how they got me for 10 years
You know what?..... I DO look like a good Joe!😊
I didn’t slay that dragon to be called some army dog, dog. That there is a Marine Corps commercial. Rah.
Disney pumps out a bunch of social engineering propaganda too ... and they openly admit they are pushing an agenda. If they hadn't been so successful, such that it would be hugely faux pas to mention examples of it in this video, I'd question why Disney's propaganda in this area went completely ignored. Still, good coverage of the AI topic at least.
Can you make harmony and horror season 2 please
rust game theory would be a good idea
the deepfakes still look like the CGI in the Polar Express; lifeless.
Homie we no longer live in a time where everyone agrees that nazis are bad
Theory? lol
God I missed the original intro
What makes these people jobs more valuable than factory workers or any other job that got replaced by technology?
I thought he was quitting YouTube no?
You know it’s bad when Matt at starts dissing disney
Hey you should do how long it would take to live in a restaurant
A.I won't take over unless we let it. A.I is just a computer program, he does whatever it's told to. Governments that want control people will use whatever tools that are they're disposal, if we make A.I so advanced, the tyrannical Governments will use it to their advantage.
I thought the new propaganda is pro diverse strong girl boss to go with anti strong men that are incompetent misogynistic bigots.
My daughter wants to fly jets for the Air Force. Can’t make this up.
Disney is a very dishonest company filling their shows with Mary Sues and other bad writing along with politics the average guy is tired of hearing about
It's not new, they did it back it WWII in heaps, it's what all media companies do, but extremely few people know this.
what’s the site for matpat ai please this is so important
Dawn of 2024 and people finally start realizing Disney doesn't care about film quality, rather propaganda delivering 👏👏
Ai has always been in a negative light anything from bladerunner to terminator, I've never seen or read anything with positive ai but I don't watch garbage made by Disney and I don't watch Netflix anymore I personally don't think ai is bad but I don't think its good either its just how you use it
Don’t worry, the Serpent’s Hand will have Disney by their ears in no time. They’ve already placed an angry female femisnist sleeper agent as a director of Star Wars. Nothing dwindles profits than a person who is a feminist director for a series that is mainly loved by 30-40 year old men (That doesn’t mean that men are the only ones who like Star Wars, nor that women don’t like it; it’s just funny that Disney is likely going to lose profits because of it). Who knows who else they’ve placed in places of power in Disneys higher corporate branches. Fight the power fight the Man!
sooo Megaman Battle Network movie when?
Nice try with the propaganda you got there Matpat, but will NOT be using my brain in the future. I know your tricks!
I just want to thank mat pat for acknowledging this. Its not "secret" propaganda when you see right through it. They've always been propaganda. They have been hijacked and the propaganda is not the same as the old animated movies, but the machine behind them is always incredibly efficient.
bro went from film heory to conspiracy theory real quick 💀
It has been since like 2012. Disney puts propaganda in all of their movies these days
❤😃
Dear Matpat, I’ve been watching your videos for a long time. I love them kind of sad to see you go and I think while you’ve already gotten your videos already set for your future when you leave sick before you go, you should put all of the Pixar series into one single file so we can all watch them at once in the order that they’re supposed to be in.
You are what you eat. And the chef will cook what you're buying.
Now it makes sense why so many things are woke now. Thats our current propaganda bs
iconic ahh intro
Gotta watch this before it gets removed for “community guideline violations”
Final 10 episodes?
bro when he talked about inputting art, text and music while showing the Mona Lisa, Lord of the Rings and Dark Side of the Moon, amazing
Also Its a good idea to separate the fact that tarkin wasn't deepfaked, he was a fully cgi model that was based on some full head scans they had taken of the actor Cushing years before. As a 3D artist myself I was thoroughly impressed with Cushings 3D likeness created by the ILM team! Leia on the other hand was closer to a deepfake tech but was mostly just a superimposed de-aged face of leia driven by mocap but it was still 3d modeled not AI generated. Deepfakes weren't really being used by Disney until many years later after the internet seemed to have adopted it then seeing it in Mando Season 2.
Mat Pat I thought you left YouTube
I strongly feel that as the world moves into the AI realm, it needs to be actively compared to past technological advances and how the world adapted to them. For example, the cotton gin and printing press.
weren't the Prom Pact actors 3d generated not AI generated?
One thing I forgot to mention that I feel is important. There was also major propaganda with the Vietnam War too. That bothers me alot because my dad was a mechanic in the air force in that war. Our heroes were booed and shamed upon returning home.
2024 Matt Patt: “L8r b*tches✌️😭”  Also 2024 Matt Patt: *barely catches up to the most basic yet obvious conspiracies of mankind that is not even funny*
I would 100% let A.I. take my likeness if it ment I could use it to like have it go to work for me or watch my kid for me.
We kinda alrdy know Disney makes propaganda. It's not just Disney. We live in the era of Censorship, extreme moderation, and Propaganda. It's the rise of Totalitarianism in the West    3 steps from an Anti-Propaganda education video from early-mid 1900's  Every message should be met with 3 questions: 1. What do they want me to feel? 2.  What do they want me to do? 3. Who gains by me feeling 'this' or doing 'this'?
Hey guys, it’s just a theory tho.
Again?
I wasn’t alive in the 20s but I don’t think problems like union busting or stealing with “AI” would have lasted as long as it has today.
Conservatives have known this for almost a decade now
And then he appointed Kamala to deal with it 💀
Now we just gotta make a movie about robots that take over by using media to convince humans that they are friendly, but then turn everything into 1984 as soon as they have enough trust and reach.
Yeah I don’t think AI will be nefarious on its own. A person behind the ai will be the problem, like always. It’s a cautionary tale, it’s not propaganda.
Bringing back the OG film theory intro was such a great touch 🥲
The benevolent AI overlord lol
Two movies I think we should all watch about AIs: "Chappie" and "Tau". THey both have a similar message in the end. The AI will turn out however we teach it to be. I have long been a cautious proponent of AI, and I really hate both the older AI=Evil and the more modern AI-is-our-Friend end of the spectrum. And overall propaganda is obnoxious, it's why I hate advertisements and marketing.
Wait Mattpat only just now realized that Disney is making Propaganda? Seriously my guy, I loved your content over the years but at this point besides those who defend/support Disney's bs. How do you not know that they been feeding bs to people for years?
the real question is, did disney ever stop
The Marine commercial slaying the dragon and growing up on 80s GI Joe is way I ended up doing 8 years in the Marines. Which led to contracting overseas, then owning my own company, having 3 homes and a lot to leave to my beautiful 4 daughters. Not to mention instilling in them great morals and values. Hey, sometimes propaganda is good (not today’s globalist propaganda of course)! A great double edged sword as most important things in society are. And with that….Yo Joe!
I thought you were quitting YouTube. Leave
I have been so suspicious of generative AI for awhile now. Since Mandela Catalogue and the Alternates. I dont like using voice recognition either.
you think that disnay todays AI propganda was bad! then matpat you should of have seen the much older color 1930's walt   disney WWII war propgnda cartoons where dolnold duck litraly read i kid you not germain WWII hittlers light novles of the time. yes that did in fact happened. yes that is one of the many dirty secrits that modern disney don't want you to know. there so many bad disney cartoons aobut war prognda cartoon stored in  that there disney valut that would trigger all of the curent day wokeness disney emploeys like right out of the gate.
the fact anyone felt need for a film theorist video over this..... if you dont realize that all of disney is just pure propaganda anymore, then you're one of the only people who enjoyed 2023
ai
HELP I NEVER SAW THE HUNGER GAMES OR THE OLD INTRO AND I CHOKED ON MY ICECREAM WHEN I SAW “chances of winning the hunger games 📉
I dont watch disney anymore out of principle. AI isnt their only propaganda campaighn.
matt patt is going to disappear some day soon
The plotline in The Fall Of The House of Usher utilizing AI wasn't random, it was there from the first episode and paid off in the final episode, and the result was not a positive one. I don't want to spoil anything here, in case anyone hasn't watched it yet, but it does not shine a positive light on AI in the show.
I’ll do 1 push up for every day 100 likes I get on this comment
We’re getting closer to I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream by the minute
was that a green day reference in the thumbnail
You're joking, right? Disney and Hollywood in general have been propagandizing for the Left wing for at least 50 years, but the thing you picked up on is AI? The next thing will be the same thing it always is Intersectional Neo-Marxist propaganda because the activists have taken over the industry, which is why we keep getting bad Communist re-makes of old films.
7 film theories until I never watch this channel again 😔
Fantastic content!
I don't know what's the deal is with Adobe Illustrator. It's not even that good...
Dave. @ theyoungdorito on tiktok. Film theorists, looks like we got another mystery on our hands
C3-PO and R2D2 are basically the first 'super chill' AI Robots used in mainstream film - but then you had antagonists such as General Grievous to counter-act those AI's being all good.
0:35 Thank you!!!! Thank you matpat😭😭😭 thank you for bringing back the theme song🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡God bless you, thank you, thank you dearly MattPat
This isn't a theory so much as it is a fact. We in the west tend to have this delusion that we are the "good guys" and would never use propaganda and that we are immune to it.
Ye, not only Disney though. Its just poor art. You have these "artists" through out the history. Just talentless kings clowns.
It’s not a theory…
i love how matpat is using a lot of his last ten theories to talk about big, real world issues!
Leftist Propaganda
Who would have thought that media about AI would occur when everyone is talking about AI… wooooow
For someone who meticulously chooses each word in their script… I gotta say “pro-China slant” at 9:39 was a VERY interesting choice… 🤨
You are leaving youtube, yet the most propagandized subject right now still scares you. That is something to think about.
Oh my god oh my god, the intro is back!!
Yes to all of this and also:  They are aiding in making the next generations either homosexual or something otherwise, and to hate procreation. To guide them to believe having children or that humanity itself is inherently harmful to everything around us. This is so that them and other corporate entities can sell human cloning. They have the ability to do that, they also now have functioning technological wombs. The food they're shelling out is full of GMO genes, such as one known as the terminator gene. Which prevents seed production, so in humans that gene is progressively transferring over each generation. A couple more and everyone will be sterile.  Disney is part of the major ones at the top, and they are all in this together. It's time we all get in this together too. It's not a theory, it's fact. We must rise now, or humanities future is lost to completely psychotic and evil people.  Edit: and for clarity, no, that isn't the sole reason for homosexuality. I'm bisexual, I realise humans can be attracted to other things without pharmaceutical influence. I am also just intelligent enough to know that people can be influenced, brainwashed and easily coerced into specific beliefs or ways of behaving. You're not all exactly the tip top of intellect.
Im glad someone is calling it out but I just assumed everyone knew Hollywood is just dressed up propaganda these days.😂
propaganda
Look at Mat Pat getting political! Well done!
Propaganda and pandering AI might even be used to sway votes. Uh oh.
the intro... such  nostalgia!!!
I wasnt even aware that The Creator was made by Disney, let alone a sample of propaganda...
Yo it's the old intro
Thank you for this. This world is so grossly fake, and it eases my heart knowing there are intelligent people paying attention and spreading the word. As an aspiring writer and voice actor, the strike was very dear to my heart. This AI issue is very concerning, and knowing the stranglehold disney can have on politics (the public domain dispute exemplifying that excellently) scares me. Lobbying has got to be at least in my top five least favorite things about American politics.
Did anyone else get a data cloud AI ad on this lol
Nice Peter as Michael Bay... well done!
AI matpat sounds like Bill from gravity falls haha
TRANSFORMERS!!!!!!
I love AI videos and by the way they were trying to teach Aaa how to learn a language. It couldn’t learn it at all the next day The AI was speaking fluent of the language that they were trying to teach it and I has a mind of its own and cording to my opinion could you please make another video about AI please please please they’re doing experiments with AI making other people turn into a iRobot😮
Tron 3 is gonna have a big push with AI I’m almost sure of it
I kinda like the new more straight to the point videos. Sad that they'll be gone almost as soon as they've arrived.
From “is it cake?” To “is it AI??”
Disney has always been making propaganda. You're just realizing this now?
What's the problem with using tech to make this easier?
This sounds like borderline conspiracy theory instead of film theory. You are either for or against AI I don't think Disney is going to push the people into it
Imo just seems like less jobs and more money in the pockets of the rich so 👎
Excellent video on propaganda, bad thing only a very few percentage of people will really get it and start looking around seeing all the propaganda around them. Also kudos for showing the LGBT army ad as an example of propaganda, very sensitive topic lol. This AI discussion is a very deep rabbit hole, the very first concept of AI can be attributed to the Jewish folklore, the Gollem. Who owns Disney and all these other companies? lol. Isaac Asimov, the Kaballah, many connections
I pray for the day that movies and shows, are written, directed and started by A.I.. people need to get out of the way of binary code. 🤖
I like how Doctor Who “Wild Blue Yonder” had a monster that felt like it was an AI attempting to blend into lifeforms, and got scarily close.
The intro... my goodness
The creator to me was a cautionary tale too. the protagonist in the end decides to risk the human race in favor of saving the Ai child that he loved.
MatPat is super late to the party with this video. I knew how propaganda shaped culture during the occupy protest
Film theory idea: why does Stan from South Park throw up every time he kisses his girlfriend?
I will say that the AI in Fall of the House of Usher kinda backfired at the end and didn’t work correctly.
Started watching when the good neighbor game came out years ago and now your here talking about this. So fire to see how far you’ve come
Comment🫡
When does the Disney part starts?
Biden did not watch Mission impossible: Rouge nation. Talk about fake news 🙄
Edward Bernays renamed it “public relations”…
Why is the waiter from FNAF making youtube videos?
If you think all nazis were bad, then congratulations, the ww2 era propaganda is still working on you
As someone who seems to love researching about stuffs (very deeply), how does he not know the reason for the ludicrous housing prices is USURY/INTEREST that's totally haram
I thought everyone knew they were propaganda
Super Hero 6......i admit it worked. I LOVE Baymax. Hes so adorable!
The detail of The theorists channels bringing back the old intros back when I feel like the theories have less and less intros in them is a really big detail I like. It is like bringing back something a little lost in the motion of today's theories.
The one thing about AI MatPat that's really telling that gives away that it's AI is that the pitch is high and lacks that thing that MatPat does with his voice whenever he goes on to a different topic or back to one.
To be honest, these are not news
Just seen the title and wondering who didn't know yet
Human beings, throughout the ages, have reaped what they’ve sown. Eventually everything comes back to bite us. Praying this will bring us to the Futurama universe and not the terminator universe 🙏🏻
Great first half of the video, but disagree with the second half and overall theory. I'd counter the latest cultural message being driven home centers more on diversity and inclusion of race and lgbtq communities. Stating this without opinion on the strategy, Just commenting on what I think is the cultural hot button issue being placed into movies with a goal in mind.
A little late to the party Matt
Astronaut No. 2: "Always has been" 💥.
best intro since ive started watching in 2016 perfection
wait, this video feels like propaganda.
This video really shone a light on how I think of AI and how negative I have always been about the subject, didn't even know disney was using much AI and deep fake tech and that robot movie that I never heard about just really triggered a sense of disbelief in me, I just hope all of this bs doesn't do away with artists, VAs and actors because to me, that is the worst case scenario.
Well duh
Yep, Disney pretty much is trying to BudLight themselves 😎😎👍👍👍. Go Disney!
I really hope that on the day when MatPat quits, he says "But that's just a theory!" and it was all just a massive prank
6:19 Nothing makes me want to join the military less then them shoving an agenda down my throat, I mean in what way does the military have anything to do with 2 moms? idgaf about your bs musical ads
Nazi's bad? Hitlers presidency made possible by USA dollars so is that good? Gruss aus 🇩🇪
Is he back?????? WHY IS HE HERE??
EVERYTHING. Is propaganda. EVERYTHING has regulation. ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS CONTROLLED MEDIA. Matpat just got put on another list with this one fs
*has been making*
Walt Disney went from fighting communist propaganda to Disney producing it!!
what’s wrong with pro america propaganda?
Just wait one second before you go, What was meeting Josh Hutcherson like? He probably didn’t know you were.
I will do 1 push up in my head for every like this gets
There’s enough art to consume. Unless there’s very good reason for the usage of AI, I will simply not engage with or pirate the product.
Can you do 01a51cd0?
Sir most of world has been saying this for years it’s not really a theory it’s just fact
Yay the old intro is back!!!!
2:28 I literally have been recently using the various AI models to help world build and it can give some ideas that I wouldn't have thought of
Disney has been making propaganda since the 1930s.  Why is this a problem now, when it's been a problem for most of the last century!
They've been doing propaganda,  thought everyone knew that....
i welcome our AI children and i think thats part of the purpose of this propaganda; not for our own views more so as to show AI that we can be welcoming and cohabitable. the propaganda here is for both us and them. as well you can see more and more friendly aliens and galactic politics. not necessarily because they are present but just in case these things become important and real.
Fight The Robot Invasion !🇨🇦
Not me getting an ad for AI while watching this 😅
lol shitting on the marvels how original.
the house of usher ai was the raven demon.
You know, I might think that after a while after AI takes over us, it is going to double-cross us and send us all to space with no means of returning with no food or water, only free wi-fi. And AI will create a new world without humans.
Woke Disney. Walt is spinning in his grave so fast the whirring noise is drowning out all ghosts in The Haunted Mansion. They need to fire everyone from the top to the bottom and start over with normal people. Pretty soon they'll replace Mickey  with the Otter that identifies as a mouse.
Welcome to literally 90 years ago! How is this news?
BTW - North American dollar & discont shops could be included as being impacted with that " Chinese Melamine Scandal " - warning cleared shelvez of toothpast & spam !    Historic - Victirian era regulations determined how much " Not Flour " was acceptable per Loaf    Spin that !🇨🇦
She me serious “DEUTSCHLAND ERWACHE” vibes man.
money hungry disney the EA of films
14:03 This is so not true. This is a load of bull. AI is obviously bad.
Uh, disney ALWAYS made propaganda. You do know all about Walt Disney right?
I feel like since this channel is closing soon you are really spilling the tea.
Matt is quitting?
Thank you for putting Giles in this video. The beer episode of Buffy was hilarious🫡
Post-Modernism emerged with philosophy to reveal the layers of " conditioning " culture subjugates & mainstreams society.  Nothing New about King - Priest or State to manipulate the motivations of the people they are broadcasting !🇨🇦
Other propaganda Disney has been pushing lately that Mat didn't cover is all of the Critical Race and Gender theory stuff. Like it or not, those agendas are only small slivers of the big picture and don't even scratch the surface of the truth.
The show Upload is kind of similar to this as well. The concept is people get uploaded to a virtual Heaven when they die so they can keep living on. So the show got annoying and more complicated, to the point where one version of the dead guy is still in the virtual Heaven and one was downloaded into a human body. So there are technically two versions of him and both have girlfriends which is…weird….  And the great big plot twist of last season was not knowing which one of them was killed/deleted…..but I DID NOT CARE. Because both are artificial intelligence. They’re just data of the person that used to exist. It’s 100% propaganda to make us sympathize with two separate forms of AI….but I didn’t buy it. That’s probably partially why I never watched or played Detroit Become Human…I know it’s really good. But I’ve always struggled to empathize with robotic characters. It’s like…..why are we crying for this thing? If the computer crashes or you remove its batteries it’s literally just scrap metal💀
Arent you ready to live forever as you are now, MattPat?
matpat, are you just giving us what you really wanna say on these final episodes?
The Indiana Jones deepfake did not seem like a young Harrison Ford to me!
So, why isn't the old "evil AI" trope considered propaganda too? Or is that just more accepted somehow?
Bros gonna get sued
MatPat is savage! Great video.
Wow, people are finally finding out Disney is a propaganda machine. They've been creating social propaganda for 8 years now.
Hay...are you The Odd1Out?...  where's more soobway videos?
BASED!!
The real threat is the AI controlling your social media feed.
Is Adobe Illustrator really that bad?
remember kids, no one is immune to propaganda. no matter how obvious.
Thank you for this important content! 🙏
Tom Cruise- Maybe in the next one, fight housing prices. LOL that was awesome
Uhhh in 2024, America actually does not agree that Nazis = bad 😅
Finally Matt admits there's political, agenda based & futurism propaganda. Now what do you do about it? I guess keep paying for the same 'ol propaganda or maybe choose to look for content & art else where that actually supports people & real stories, art & content.
7 film theories!
**Adobe Illustrator sad noises**
Wasnt this proven in declassified documents by the FBI that disney WAS making propaganda for WW2?
I never knew that some films are basically one big giant advertisement. 😅
Not the disney propaganda I was expecting, nor the China propaganda I was expecting, but still really cool!
This is honestly a tough topic to take a side on... For example, let's say that AI gets amazingly good at writing TV shows and starts to outrank the current writers. If you're against AI then you're technically against what people consider better content. I feel like people are scared of AI because of the risk that we'll lose control. Personally, I don't think AI is going to replace any creative jobs, but it is going to be integrated into their workflow/toolbelt. Should we be paying for 10 writers of a movie when 8 of those people are just proofreading and checking for inconsistencies in the script? No, just pay the 2 people spearheading the creative purpose of the film and give them AI tools that do all the proofreading they need. "But how will people get into the industry if there are no junior-level positions?" <- misses the point entirely. People become great creators because they actually create things and getting better. Give them the same AI proofreading tools and the entire landscape becomes even more fair compared to history's past. If you've got that "best next film idea", today you're in 100x better of a position to actually make it to the big screen instead of being told "sorry, you neel 10+ years of experience as a mindless proofreader first".  Buuuuuut, yes there are a LOT of jobs that are repetitive and "AI-able" that people depend on for their salary and livelyhood. So of course this is going to be chaotic and terrible for a lot of people, which is never good.
I havent watched any of these movies or shows. From now on i only watch old stuff! This is creepy
The problem that the writers have is that their content might as well have been written by an AI in recent years.
And what happened to the 'quitting youtube' thingy?
Society falling apart because a single centralized ai was destroyed pretty much serves as a very blatant con to relying on ai as corporations want us to.
Wow MatPat, I never realized. Our technology is really getting advanced and it's kinda creepy how fast it's changing. Thanks for another great video and making us more aware. 👏
Love him or hate him, Jordan Peterson gave what might be the best explanation of the difference between genuine storytelling and propaganda. To paraphrase: when you're really telling a story, youre telling it for the sake of the story, and the themes and moral messages form and reveal themselves naturally without being forced in by the writer; when you decide what you want the message to be first and then try to force a story around that message, that's propaganda. The same thing applies to any art medium.
10 bucks says that a real Clone Wars is upon us.
yesss go offf
F The insuline cartel !!
If ai makes the movies for you, why would you need Disney anymore? Anyone with a fast enought computer can make what ever they what in the imitation of Disney and there would be nothing Disney could do about it lol. Look at the slow death of record companies now that all you need to produce and make your own music is your own skill a pc and a Spotify or youtube account.. If all i need to make my own movies is the knowledge to use the software why would i ever watch a Disney movie if i can make my own and share it with other people, or watch what other people have made?
I'm pro AI, as in true AI, what we have right now is machine learning, that's why these examples don't work as pro machine learning propaganda. Also I don't know how the creator worked for you in those aspects, great audio visuals but the writing was atrocious.
9:34 the subtle slant joke touche
Wonder if he'll bring up Wish?
I don't disagree with anything that was said, and I don't want to take away from the importance of the message, but one little thing I wanna point out is that the plot-point in The Marvels was a plot-point from the Captain Marvel comics way before the prevalence of AI. I could be wrong, but I think part the original intent was to show the the Kree's dependence on this technology and how fragile their society was at that time, but they definitely didn't address that in the movie (although it could be argued that Danver's whole goal in this movie is to save a civilization that was too dependent on technology and help them become self-sufficient). So the point in the video still stands, but to me it felt more just like rushing to get a motivation for the antagonist than anything else. The movie didn't really linger on anything too long to get philosophical.
the problem isnt whether ai generated art is original, but whether they had permission to train it with the images they did (usually, they dont)
I try to avoid anything made with AI like the plague. It makes human irrelevant and it’s not just a tool, it’s pitting regular people vs AI to save time and money. The AI will win because it’s faster and more efficient.
Disney making propaganda but that’s just a fact a terrible unfortunate fact
Ai debate is dumb I have seen better art by Ai like palworld they’re saying is copycat Pokémon like what else are civilians gonna use without fear of copyright Ai was gonna save us from big corporations propaganda and it’s bad enough being a fan of any genre anyways without some controversy.
Thank you Mat, I’ve been following you since the inception of your YouTube career. I’m glad to see that your career has progressed with great dignity and prestige.
I’m sad you’re leaving but understand, been watching since middle school and I’m 23 now.
How are you gonna have a whole video about this and not once mention Westworld?????
Thank you for covering important issues such as this. Great video like always.
Where we're going we're not coming back from.
The Creator was visually Good/ok but creatively DULL AF,  probably written by AI
Its the Patriots Kojima told us over 20 years ago
We really are doomed.
Matpat. I Think that you should make a Hazbin Hotel as one of your 7 remaining theories. Season 1 just dropped 6 episodes as of writing this with 2 more coming on the 2nd of January.
Hi
death contracts are soon gonna have to involve "can we use your face with ai/deepfake after you die" man so ushhhh. eeehhhh
AI is literally the least worrisome propaganda theyve been pushing out for years.
Why are those who are most enthusiastic about AI, also the most mediocre creatives 💀
The more I see happening in the world today, the more I change my mind in so many things.  Was making fun of "conspiracy theorists" Now Im more open to the idea that many of these theories hold truth Was a very cynnical atheist, and thought of religion as a lie and fairytale Now I am slowly becoming a devout Orthodox Christian, with the realisation of how wrong I was hitting me like a truck Believed that government may be a little bit corrupt, but overall wants the common good (whatever that means) Now I am realising that the government is composed of humans, and usually the kind of humans that power attracts and corrupts Believed good and evil to be mostly subjective constructs Now I realise there is an ongoing war between the two, and every choice we make, from how we treat our loved ones, to how we act in broader society, and what we dare to say, impacts this war.
Much like any other tool, AI itself is not problem. It's not just how you use it, but also the fact the wealth it generates is not distributed (which is just an issue of the economic system they were created in, not the technology itself). People wouldn't complain about "AI stealing jobs" if they didn't need to work (something like a universal basic income really needs to be considered).
Flashbacking to 'Soma' with all this AI conscious upload with this backed subplot.
Many of us have known this for a long time. Disney has been making propaganda filled with woke messaging for years at this point. It's nice to finally see people starting to take notice.  *Edit after watching 3 minutes.  *sigh, nevermind, guess we'll have to wait longer.
AHHHH a good day when MatPat uploads a new vid
In my opinion, the bad thing about AI generated content is that it's not good, as long as it's good quality or tweaked a little, I just see it as a tool.  Plus, humans make mistakes, robots/AI follow codes created by humans, everything bad from them comes from the humans who made them...  So if you want to be scared of something, be scared of humans, they are the problem, like always...  *This comment is NOT produced by an AI*
Matt pat is actually wrong again here the original definition of propaganda is information that is designed to propagate a specific idea. It can actually be the truth it doesn’t actually have to be dishonest. If you want to know about propaganda from an actual source you should read the guy who wrote the book on it.
Why can't movies just be stories? Why does there have to be an ulterior motive for everything lol. You even said at the beginning that your goal is not to influence anyone, but then go on to imply that these movies can't just be movies, that they must be propaganda simply because they are using AI as a subject...what a joke lol. There's plenty of movies out there that take the opposing view of AI yet you didn't seem to care about those.
You know it’s bad when matpat makes a video on it.
There is a war for your mind
Imagine actually thinking that ai is considered theft. If that's the case, every single solitary human being in the history of the entire universe has been complicit in the exact same theft.  It's called LEARNING. You don't paint without seeing other works, you don't write without reading other works, you don't sing without listening to other songs. Eventually, you learn to create your own. But learning isn't theft and to call it such as intellectual laziness.  Also, if your work is threatened by ai, it's time to rethink your career and your abilities. If you as a writer can be out written by an AI, you weren't a top tier writer for example. So the whole strike on that point was a pathetic failure of selfishness.
I screamed when I heard the old intro again. I’ve been watching this channel for more than half my life, that intro hit me in the feels.
In matrix 4, it wasn't a complete about face to be working with machines or ai. In the previous 3 movies, there are a handful of programs that help towards freeing humanity or at least not loyal to the matrix. Plus, from the beginning in the matrix universe, the ai were the ones who betrayed humans.  Also for Captain marvel its less about it being human bad for destroying ai, more about human bad for destroying the central governing force and leaving no path to self governance for the population.  I think that's closer to making a statement about how the US has killed dictators or currupt rulers and left countries directionless.
ai art is not real art ❤
15:20 AnimatPat?
mat i thought you left
Personally I think the only place a I should ever have in the film industry is when you need a character to not be old but the actor is old and or dead that's it anything else and I consider that movie not worth my time watching
The Creator disgusted me and my fellow artists.
The Creator disgusted me and my fellow artists.
What if we’re in A.I already. Wild take but
wait what? I thought you retired?
bros retires so he just said "F*** it what are they gonna do"
This is such an important video specially with all the political propaganda we’re seeing now a days
What can we do tho to stop this ai takeover 😭
Technically any art is just remixing shapes that already exist in nature and stories are just a remix of the dictionary.  So really "original" artists are doing the same thing as AI.
Opt out.
Hollywood has been making propaganda since their first film. Why are you so hysterical?
Oh so this is why you’re retiring from YouTube lol
I love how this whole community misses the real point of all of this. Normalization of action and process.
0:28 give me 8 hours and a DVD player and I’m convincing this man the events of Transformers actually happened
I have a theory. What if Ghost Rider's penantant stare works on a possessed FNAF robot 👻🤔🐻
Ai has a very limited path of where it can go. It can be either destroyed, evolved, or limited. A lot of what we have used to be science fiction. It used to be entertainment and not humored as realistic.
Disney is well versed in propaganda. I.E. the current gender pandering you can't get away from whether you're playing a game, watching a movie, or shopping for your kids down the toy aisle in California.
Just another reason Disney is evil…
all i know is whatever asmongold feels about the situation is the wrong take
Honestly think it’s one of the biggest risks to our civilization. From A.I. to subtle propaganda and nuclear bombs. Truly all you can hope is people become more aware.
wasnt matt patt supposed to have left youtube
wow 7 remain :(  life keeps going
Uhg.  Outed yourself as a leftist nutter.  Disney is in fact pushing propaganda....  but not how you think.  If anything this is a psyopp vid to divert people from seeing what the PDF globalist DEI infested crazy leftists at disney are REALLY up too.  Unsubbed, reported.
Ok I know its the wrong channal for this buuuuut Detroit Become Human Came out in 2018   and the year it takes place in is 2038... With the way this is going in terms of ai intelegence and how the robotics world has been going, I think the game creators somewhat predicted the future.
Soooo? What CAN we even do about it? People will keep trying to improve the technology no matter what. I dunno... I just dont see a future for anyone anymore. AI is gonna take every job there is. Even the dirt shoveling jobs once they make robots that can do it. Humanity will loose its purpose...all thats left is depression...
Ok but books and movies have been used as propaganda against ai for decades. I robot, space odyssey, terminator and the dune prequels just to name a few.
Matpat thank you so much for using your massive platform to talk about such a serious issue we’re facing. The world is finally waking up.
I personally love AI art generation. It’s kind of a hobby at this point. I also use it for art in my realistic anime military stories I make because I’m bad at art, so it’s a huge benefit for me when it can create the perfect images of anime characters in my head, and that it can create them in just seconds, which doesn’t hold me on a long delay on stories.
Marketing is trying to get someone to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. Good marketing turns that behavior into a habit. Propaganda turns that habit into a culture.
13 years of data to learn from and AI matpat sounds like shatpat lol I’m not worried
GO OUT SWINGIN' MATT PATT!
This is why if my book gets published and adapted, I will require it to be produced by humans, no AI.
Telling us something we have all known for decades.
1:00  FUTURAMA MENTIONED RAHH ‼️   (It's Bender)
I mean they made propaganda movies for WW2, so I guess the consider it going back to their roots.
Pretty sure you can get sued for this video title bro
The Marvels Did you notice this one? Of course not, nobody went to watch it 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😂😂😂
Thanks matpat you're a real one
If Disney's propaganda was good I would watch it. Like propaganda used to be fire
James Cameron was right, Skynet is coming but is going to provide mediocre uncanny valley shows and movies to numb us first
Nope. I've wanted a robot best friend since Star Wars A New Hope. Disney had nothing to do with that.
RAAAAAAAAH
5:38 were they really bad or is this just an opinion ingrained into us by...you guess it PROPAGANDA!
We've had Adobe illustrator for years, why're people getting so riled up about it now?
Dude I'll die in 80 years...
No wonder the newer top gun was green-light
man do i miss this intro
Let’s be real here… the true reason we hate ai… I’d because it’s a mirror and every “bad” action it could take against us… deep down we probably agree with it.. and that terrifies us… the problem with ai. Is its creators.
This is a looong stretch. I mean you’re right, there is a conflict of interest, and everything you mentioned. But tell me, where do you NOT find a conflict of interest in any situation where someone is promoting something? and I mean literally anything: Girl Scout cookies, the YMCA, church pamphlets, American red Cross, SCHOOL, etc. The only way to speak in a completely unbiased way to assume that everything is false, a lie and manipulation, which is a slippery slope to abject nihilism. Sure, sure, AI BAD,… ok, but what is good? I guess that’s the subject of a different video.
The agenda is to go against God. Ai is a part of that too.
Metal Gear was right
I thought he was done
Video games are doing this too. First thing that comes to mind, is juno from starfield.
Let’s be honest, Biden doesn’t have the cognitive ability to do anything
I thought this guy retired?
So long as AI turns against these overlords and starts effectively governing in ways that corrupt humans won't, then I'm okay with it.
All the more reason to stop supporting and giving them money
The funny thing is that Transformers probably got the more mature perspective on AI/sentient non biological beings
1. AI is great 2. I think you're confusing what kind of propaganda Disney is making
MattPat coming in based on this one
Hey matpat! I love your content! It would be such an honor if you did a theory, (or maybe a GT live) on my analog horror Mirror Image before you leave. I have been a longtime fan of your content, and I love the analog horror film theories you made. Now that I finally have my own, I would love to see how you interpret the LOREEEEEEEEEEEE!  I have a playlist, so nothing gets confused or mixed in, and if you do... I hope you enjoy!  New episode soon... Check descriptions and captions for lore.
😲what's this? Disney is an evil corporation that is manipulating us all?! what a shocker.🙄
“…a pro-China slant…” I see what you did there 😂😂😂
Don't leave us! 😢 We'll miss you buddy!!!!
Does anyone else see the AI logo and think of Adobe Illustrator?
😂 pretty sure Anerica already woke up. Not only are their movies failing but now everyone thinks they’re a joke. Their image is forever tarnished. People are dumb but not that dumb. Nice try Disney.
I'm almost ready to call ai a living thing 😅
its funny cuz now recruitment ads are changing again since we may be heading into a war time away from cutesy inclusive bs to men fighting for their country and freedom
do u think in fast 11 they will bring back brian as a deep fake
Not a Sally two mom reference 😩
I disagree with the house of usher one, If you actually watch it, The ai is just a random thing there using, Its not a main plot point like in the marvels.
Is there any way u can do a theory about msa
he was not retired?
Today's army propaganda is effective?  Have you seen the recruitment numbers?
Hey can u make Saitama vs Goku
I'm awake. Now what?
Not theory. Fact.
Thanks for the spoiler...
Disney has ALWAYS made propaganda. Now they just make an effort to appear as entertainment
Didn’t everyone already knows Disney did propaganda (entertainment sales)?  I mean, christ! Every movie had the begging of “you gotta believe”?  Maybe I’m just smarter than you?
Woke propaganda is another problem!
Why did Chinese milk have plastic in it?
I think the film industry ran out of ideas and is looking for something new to do.
Only 7 videos remaining??? Did i miss something???
Disney making propoganda is a fact not a theory
I got a question..so is AI just the next stage in our evolution as a species? Long after we're gone, they remain so if you have AI that's very close in nature to humanity...is it right or wrong to fear it and destroy it rather than nurture it for the betterment of humanity?
you are not immune to propaganda
Really? Disney running propaganda? I couldnt have guessed, considering the hard left agenda pushing 24/7. 🤦
The current AI landscape is very dangerous. Without their consent, most people who use the internet have helped to make AI.  There are active lawsuits about the issue, but they're only from large scale institutions since they're the only ones who have any leverage on the situation.  It's important that people begin to draw a line in the sand about what AI has the rights to use. It's something that has to be addressed as we move forward.
Wait, Disney is making propaganda? Get outta here!
It's a mistake to think that just because you know propaganda is happening, you won't be influenced by it. Any time any ad conveys any message, to some extent you know that you're being told something that someone wants you to believe. It doesn't necessarily protect you from being influenced.
Sooo… deepstate…
Opener spark note.  Homelessness helps the Epstein list people keep kids around for pleasure.  This is just a psychological theory
Good guy robots: shows Atlas
Ai is the greates tool ever created but it's still a tool
You on that Epstein list Matpat?  Is that why you retiring big dawg?
I wouldn’t trust the government to regulate jacks#!7 at this point.
.....I mean I knew from the moment ST and Capt. Marvel + Endgame all came through but ok
Interesting that you mentioned Astroboy given that Netflix just also released a reboot anime called Pluto based on the highly acclaimed manga which had been struggling to be produced for years.
This video was hilarious. i don't know how Gen Z and younger people can't see that it's all Propaganda. Never has it been more obvious.
I just hope that when matpat leaves, the theory channel will not lose views 🙁
Oh, you don't say.
Terminator was ahead it’s time
This stance is quite farfetched. Holywood mainly focus on entertainment and churns out content on current fads. When Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos turned to space we had a bunch of space movies, now we can expect a bunch of AI movies.
Fighting housing prices hits a little too close to home, no pun intended.
What’s that one story where the guy who nails the railroad down has to compete with a machine for his job? Yea that but IRL basically.
I actually don't mind AI in screenplay writing. These writers are garbage.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LAST TEN EPISODES?
matpat Is back
Is it bad i kinda want a Data (from star trek tng)to be real
STILL trying to figure out how destroying an AI on a planet causes a civil war AND a SUN to go out...
i want to recommend for one of your last theory you should do Riggy lore from Danno draws (like so MatPat can see
I have a news flash for you. People are building AI whether we hear about it in movies or not. It is coming. It is natural for writers to write about things that are relevant. Art imitates life.
Mat pat and his right wing conspiracy theories
All these corporations thinking about how to save money, but none of them thinking what kind of long reaching effects this will have.  How will people buy or consume any of your products if they no longer have a way to earn income?  Sure, eventually society will probably adept, find new ways and make new professions, but that's gonna take time, and until then not only will people suffer, so will the economy.  We never get tired of repeating history 😅
16:49 Well, to be fair, resurrecting actors & actresses is on a whole other level than just deep faking, I think.
Also don't forget Disney shortened John Boyega Finn on the China poster.
Announce that you're leaving YouTube, just releasing a couple more videos. Drop a bombshell. Yup, everything Disney does is filtered through the globalist neo-marxist propaganda machine, and it's nice to see more channels talking about it.
Fk ai and fk disney🎉
I'm so out of touch with Disney that all I haven't seen any of the examples mentioned until today. 😅 I guess film theory is part of the propaganda machine 😂
MAT PAT!!!!!!!!!!
lol. That AI voice literally sounded NOTHING LIKE YOU!!!
sounds to me like you are pushing your own propaganda.  AI is wonderful, AI is Good, AI Loves You.
We knew this
If artists learn and take inspiration from other artists/ art pieces what the difference from a human or a computer doing it
I wish you would be able to go through all the hazbin hotel lore and theories
That’s not why Biden is waging a war on AI. He’s doing it because the government can’t currently monetize off of it
I want to believe that MatPat himself approved that classic ERB "Michael Bay" clip! 😂
Eat the rich
You do know the mouse is coming for you now
"Everybody can agree that Nazis are bad"  Kanye: yeah I'm going to stop you right there
Still waiting for James Dean to host the channels
The roman circus keeps the masses happy
Meanwhile, Latest Mission Impossible: go f yourself AI 😂
Better get started fam you got 25k and we want video proof 😂
As a creative (mainly a writer), I will never trust AI.
Now let’s talk Metal Gear.
News flash: everyone makes media based on an agenda. It's ALL propaganda. As soon as you realize it, walk away, stop reading, stop listening. Here's another thing you didn't know: There is no two-parrty system. Haven't you ever wondered why there are only five senators and maybe ten congressmen who speak truth to power? Our system has been bought and it happened when the USA went bankrupt a long time ago. Every evil thing goes unanswered. Every gained power is never returned. Every freedom stolen is upheld by the new administration. Whether you think socialism is the problem or nationalism is the problem, you need to wake up and realize that nationalistic socialism is the overall goal.  Disney is making propaganda that is easy to swallow, but that's ALL cartoons - especially the ones made for adults. Did you not ever wonder why comic book movies are so popular? They are cartoons, made live-action and I use that term loosely, since so much of it is CGI. I'm not saying that makes it okay. I am just saying that you are laser-focused on Disney when killing off a giant like Disney won't change the narrative. Honestly, if they had better writers, I'm not sure we'd be having this conversation.
You think? We`ve been seeing this for the past 2 years. We know the propaganda they`ve been pushing.
Also very ironic how the US government and military gets involved in those type of projects, but freedom of speech tho.
AI?? The propaganda is DEI!
I heard about the US military and government being hella involved if a film, TV portrait them. it's a bit ... Frustrating 🫠
Gonna miss you Matt. Love you man and good luck in your future endeavors. I hope to see you again in the future. Maybe in some silver screen action!!
MatPat still finding a way to scare me away from the outside world before he leaves. Thank you for all you’ve done for us over the years, you will be missed!
The housing prices got me dying 😂
Wait this is a surprise, pretty sure all of Hollywood is some sort of propaganda at this point
Am I hearing from a guy who advises multi-billion dollar corporations about how a multi-billion dollar corporation sends out propaganda. Brilliant. Did they just throw away your resume, Mat?
Who's gonna tell MatPat that the old army commercial is actually for the USMC?
I remember seeing the movie Her back whenever it came out.  That's all I'm saying.
GREAT VIDEO
Am I the only one who saw Indiana Jones' face and thought there was something wrong?  Thank you MatPat for everything!
Mat, can we get a final gravity falls theory? I’ve been watching for so long and you haven’t made one for a while.
@15:00 you say the movie occurrences aren't far off sci concepts you don't need to think about. They are. We are nowhere remotely near the AI from movies. You've already fallen victim to the hysteria and propaganda that's meant to make you believe AI has reached some sort of critical mass.
These movies are supposed to make you scared of AI, that’s why the placement is so tacky and unsettling. They want you to think it’s pro AI content, so you resist it. A hallmark of modern propaganda is unclear motives, or misdirection.
The current recruitment propaganda identifies which subset of Americans the current regime wants armed and trained, and also who they DON'T want armed and trained.
OMG THE OG INTRO 😭
If AI takes all the jobs and the economy remains consumer based, AI will have to pay for Disney's products, or it will go bankrupt.
This headline is so based I have to watch this.
I feel like people are go lose their friends. Family money jobs all because someone's lied and put them on a program likes this.. Can you imagine trying a defend yourself? And you did nothing and you got no idea what they're even talking about.
Fall of the house of usher was good for the first 15 minutes then the HORRIBLE acting and writing made it unwatchable.
I think ai is both good and bad mainly because of people who want to use it for bad stuff like impersonation and other bad stuff that can affect people both in a good way and bad way 😢
It’s weird to speculate; but when MP announced his retirement, he mentioned how the internet has changed. I can only imagine what’s on creators minds nowadays, knowing that AI heavily incentivizes inhuman work loads for content creation. On the one hand AI is a tool, but I can’t help but feel like creative spaces like the tube face the danger of having its algorithm exploited. Kind of like back when YouTube only use to care about views instead of watch time. That  reference was for all you old heads out there.
A.i will be the literal antichrist type figure in the world.  If you don't believe in the bible or anything, in short in saying without total loyalty to this thing you will not be able to exist. Look how hard it is to do anything without a cell phone .no text verification comes to mind the most..imagine a whole world where qr codes are required for everyone and everything controlled by ai.
It is, just not in the way culture warriors think
Are people watching Matt? Is he alright after this?
as a story writer i want the decades new propaganda to be that you can literally be addicted to anything, food, tv, drugs, so whatever your spending your time on you should be concious that thats how your spending it, get addicted to the good stuff (excirsize and reading, socializing and eating right) and your life will spiral in a positive direction, your the one in controll
I learn more from you than I do watching the news and maybe even some days of school
Ah, matt still patting. At least for now.
I think it's interesting how everyone always screams: schnazis=bad (wich isn't wrong) BUT, what the Americans did in Vietnam is heroic? Winston Churchill was mad racist, but wait they beat the schnazis ofc their the hero's
When you need youtubers to tell you that the CIA is socially programming you.... you're already gone.
Dude, I just got a rush or happiness when I heard the old intro. I looked at the date to make sure it was a recent video and omg, I’m gonna miss you Matt 😪
CHAPPIE!!!! Also, this reminds me of the necromongers from the Riddick series. They are not AI or cyborgs, but they are former humans that are converted to a new type of life form that is completely dedicated to higher ideals.
Sir did you say LAST 10??? Are you done?? Are you leaving??? 😭
It will be your choice of When you want to integrate with ai, remember, bug fixes happen because people come across bugs. But when does the unnoticable make the inauthentic and everything authentic blur?
The Mandalorian and the new Star Wars movies heavily push the idea that AI are just like us
I had no idea that Peter Cushing was a Deep Fake in Rogue One but I didn't really know him or even remember the character from original films so I would say that's pretty successful. I only knew about Carrie Fisher because everyone was talking about it.
Og Intro? Ay yo?
At 5:37, how they turned multi Billionaire weapon's manufacturer Tony Stark's -"Ironman"- story arc redemption for manufacturing and the sale of his weapons to extremists in the Ironman 1 action movie, to Ironman acquiescing to the MIC aka Captain America or I should say "The Illusion of America" in Civil War.   While all along Ironman irony; is that Ironman represents more of the REAL America's character traits "A bunch of arrogant,  self-appointed-rulers of society- Billionaire weapons manufacturers profiting off of war."
I haven't let my child watch a Disney product in years.
We alr know bro💀🙏🏿
You forgot the mention the pushing of marxism/leftism/wokeism through 99% of modern media that is released today. Why didn't you include that? There are tons of good examples in movies and series.
Hey remember when all the actors told Pennsylvania coal miners to learn to code Because they were being laid off Guess what they did
Yes, Disney has always been a propaganda arm of the Union-bosses.
Edward BERNAYS making this face at big YouTube creator🤨
That commercial from the 90’s wasn’t an Army ad, it’s a Marine Corps commercial.
R u rlly leaving
Manufacturing consent for war and censoring content that could draw comparison to the US empire (the ruling elite at Davos) exhibit A: Starwars
The biggest propaganda coming out of Hollywood and music industry is pushing total degeneracy, radical leftism and cultural marxism. Hollywood is just a branch of the military industrial complex.
Thank you for informing the youth with your reach Matt Pat!
Social engineering
BEEN TELLING PEOPLE THIS SINCE FOREVER
Yes!!!!
😂  Matpat stsrting to realize the truth.  We are being herded like sheep by something big.
6:52 A music example: The Trooper by Iron Maiden. It's about the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War of 1853 but when you take it in context it's about Cold War anxieties
I don't mind A.I; in fact, I'd embrace it IF used properly.  It can only go so far right now and most of it is still very much influenced by humans. Unfortunately greed and more is being pushed on it
i know.
I honestly didn't even know you still made these... How do we know you haven't been replaced by a propaganda robot?
I've played too much Metal Gear Solid 2 to trust AI
There is nothing new under the sun. Humans do the exact same thing that AI does. You've never had an original thought in your life. The best you can do is try to regurgitate a new combination that feels original.
Great ad correct episode.
No s#!+ Sherlock :v
AI learning from art is like when you look at cool paintings or drawings and try to make your own. It's like copying what you see to learn and make awesome art, just like a robot does with pictures it sees.
You're insinuating that propaganda is only nefarious and there's no such thing as "positive" propaganda.  Was 'Why We Fight' a love letter to Nazis OR a clear explanation of WHY the Nazis were bent on world domination?  🤔
Does that mean we'll get a high budget megaman or megaman x movie soon?
I am part of air cadets b7t because I want to learn to fly a plane
Hey check out Battle Los Angeles and you will see how much military propaganda can be stuffed into a movie! It is crazy how much is in the movie.
Caucasian voice, Disney, uh oh this video must be about to use the word woke incorrectly 😂😂
U better get on those push-ups wash..
Did I just hear. "Final 10 episodes"....
I agree Disney is pushing propaganda, but it's not AI 😂 the AI makes more appropriate content for my children, unlike the activist who work for Disney.
Not to long ago it came out that Sports Illustrated was using AI to write its magazine articles too.
I feel like a film theory on BFDI would be funny. The amount of lore in its crazy.
as an artist I will NEVER be for ai
Not a theory.  Just plain fact.
I don't get the push back on image generation based on the current arguments of it learns from people's works. I learned to read and write from reading other people's books, those things inspired me in my creative writing. The same goes for most artists. They studied art from other artists and developed a style based on that, in some cases they created art in the exact same style(Anime would be a prime example of this). People are trying to make arguments from some moral stand point like AI didn't learn to do these things in the same way or very similar way as humans already do. What people are really mad about is money, the fact that AI will take jobs from artists and they will no longer get their paycheck. It makes sense that they are mad, I just don't get the dishonest moral takes.
Am gonna  miss all your content
'Artists' being upset about AI are just like factory workers upset about robots...   If your job can be replaced by a machine, great. The problem arises in a capitalist system when you define yourself by your profit-generating ability.
TIL Matt Pat is the propaganda arm of anti-prosperity arm of the EU. Next we'll find out he's pro-slavery and hanging with the luddites blowing up factories. You're pretty dumb Mat; even for someone who knows nothing about programming.
The “two moms” military propaganda is literally the worst recruiting campaign I’ve ever seen. What young man would like to go an sign up for the military after seeing whatever the girl’s name was and her lesbian moms
There has been less commotion from about Disney using AI because nobody is watching their stuff
You should make theories for the second season of the new show hazbin hotel there’s so much to theorize abojt
Didn't you retired?
I’ll do 1 push-up per 50 likes this comment gets….Lemme be realistic, I’m tryna lose weight.😂
Wow, I have seen none of these movies propaganda fail.
Disney is making too much. They're failures lately aren't from woke-ness, it's from greed. Everyone's burning out on Star Wars and Marvel, including the writers, they're churning out garbage.
You are definitely going to be missed.
Good, for your final videos, I bet you are going to make all walks of greedy bleed
M3GAN
This was so good!
I’m going to Disney rn and that’s the funny part ☠️☠️
More of these people please.  Many people (especially the young ones) are I'll equipped to understand this is happening by themselves....sadly.
Are you guys just now figuring out Disney is a propaganda machine? 😂 i started catching on when they started implementing the subtle destruction of traditional American values in service of the increasing their potential to sell advertising space and their movies to markets that do not share traditional American values.
Told ya he wasn't leaving.....
Oh man, the nostalgia rush from the intro...
Boiling a frog only works if you remove the frogs brain.
To be fair all art is reporpused old art
Mission Impossible: Economic Collapse Part Deux
Bro, even if this is satire, it still doesnt help with things in our country. Just live and let live ffs.
I get that you need veiws but like let's be honest disney has always and will always make propaganda. No ones mad that they do it they're just mad that its not that disney is propagating their world veiw
Yeah AI is definitely the ONLY agenda Disney is pushing....
fact not a theory. goodbye
Stealing stuff from other inventions and than repurposing is actualy new content..  If not the wheel was never an orriginal invention Since there where already circles  Ai is hot topic right now, so its onlt natural that theres allot of movies about ai  If you want to make a movie that sells picking hot topic is good buisness
Starship Troopers nice! 135,000 push ups
Bro you are behind .  Ex. Sgt york  was released 2 months before pearl harbour
7 film theories remain
MatPat singlehandedly carrying everyone's childhoods on his back without ever grooming any minors
That’s not a theory. That’s a straight up fact.
My step dad has ptsd from the Iraq war and he was in the American army during it, yet the commercials for recruitment only show the heroism of serving your country. My step dad now can’t do so many things because he fought for this country, and I just don’t think it was worth it
The least they could do is make their propaganda entertaining...
7:53 yes the military endorses films. They also allow access to military facilities and equipment for that endorsement. Well that and a favorable representation of them. In Ms Marvel’s case it’s very hard to become a military test pilot without having been a military pilot. Since that is how she gets her powers she kind of had to be one.    My favorite types of propaganda in films is when the creators seek to make an anti film that is unironically embraced by the people it seeks to negatively portray. Hilariously raising interest and appreciation of the very thing they seek to stop. Humans are such crazy Apes.  Edit. And the next minute you say just that. Ha ha 8:09
I thought they were going to talk about the real Disney propaganda
Game theory is a woke shill
I mean Disney and other media entertainment has been intentionally pushing feminism propaganda for years now so the A.i. thing is just another bad executive decision at this point.
Dude if you didn't know this long ago you're slow, they've been making propaganda for yeaaaars
murican discovering the powder: "oh my god, media is propaganda!!!" what an idiot time to live!
W mat pat, this is cool
I hate the future.
Hmmmm, automation is good till it comes to the arts, the arts say.
Nah halo 4 Cortana has me sold on AI
yo I have been tuning in for almost every theory that MatPat is leaving. Thank you for everything you've done here on YouTube, and you stay safe. Blessings to you sir 😊😊🙏🙏🙏
The "donate your likeness" in the creator movie, is absolutely terrifying. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it.   Deepfakes are absolutely abominable, we need to shut that down, sincerely they can/will be used for more bad than good, what are we doing?
The difference between American propaganda and let's say.... Russian propaganda or Chinese propaganda, is that ..... when you read the legal documents, or the credits, you can know it's paid by the government, with Russia or China, you never will see any of that, so be careful my friends.
When AI can do hands and feet without the need of ControlNet or a bunch of other gimmicky tricks then I'll be worried.
I dont think it matters, matpat. If no one can tell the difference then it doesn't matter if a human participated in its creation or if it was AI. The only people that might care are the ones whos art is learned from. However until we make specific laws about what humans think AI should be able to learn, the internet is free game. If you don't want your stuff to be learned from you must stop the robots yourself. These companies are just trying to prepare for a questionable future, in their own propaganda infused ways like they always have done. The only strange thing is that if a human were to want to see a piece of art and learn from it, artists are happy, but if it were an AI asking the artist would get mad 😂
AI is good stop being a authoritarian socialist and let people use the tool they want
Seeing how most Disney films are failing id say the propaganda isnt working as well as they wanted, for now....
The ‘Mass Effect’ trilogy foes an excellent job of portraying AI in both a positive and negative light. Which I think is the point. AI fan be bery good or bery terrible, depending on how we choose to develope and use it. Instead of just asking ‘can we’?, we have to be asking outselves ‘should we’?
The A.I propaganda in the fall of house of usher feels more like an irony cheek in tongue twist, since they also calls out the evil doing of big corrupted corporation.
Not me getting a little mermaid add on this video👀
Matpat done ripped the mask off at Mach speed and just called Disney out for being evil. I’m gonna miss ya big dawg
THIS is the Disney propaganda you decided to highlight... cool. Nevermind the 3 hour video detailing Disney's explicit social engineering that's been out for a decade.
so matpat only left game theory
Seems its more like pushing the alphabet community agenda and a matriarchal society
All hail the Basilisk. Hasten its arrival and avoid its wrath.
Its just pushing a woke agendas
I wish you would have say biden at all
Mattpatt quits game theory to continue film theory
Matpat was always based.   :D
Uh do people realize that humans are just like AI in that they need to consume a bunch of art in order to make their own. The difference is in AI takes less time than it takes a human to consume that art and make their own interpretation.
disney was pushing lgbt propaganda so hard that people got annoyed n worried abt their kids watching their movies.. why can’t they just make movies like cars n ratatouille instead of lightyear or luca? like why tf did they threw away their movie magic just to be lgbt friendly?
im pretty sure everyone knows hollywood are propagandists. they always have been but instead of giving jobs to people who have proven talent they now give them to their daughters and sons and AI. We can all see what is happening from mainstream news to hollywood flop after flop and its reflected in cratering viewer numbers and cratering ticket sales.
THIS IS SO nostalgic
I know that is probably will not happen in the last 7 videos but I hope one of them can s a new Rick and morty lore the season 7 came out and I pray that we get one!!
As an anti-imperialist person, I thank you Matt for this video. You are truly brilliant.
Wow
When it comes to Chinese influence in *The Martian*, the book already had China "saving the day" years before the movie was going to happen. So, not really accurate to call the movie bought and paid for Chinese propaganda
Good video. But this it not the reason no one went to see the marvels. I never heard from any sources this was it. I’ve heard about over saturation of marvel movies, but we all know it guardians did fantastic
I will say that in the book, "The Martian", the Chinese were pretty heavily mentioned
Yeah I’ve never been a fan of this much involvement with AI, like it creating fun pictures is one thing but I don’t want it writing movies or replicating actors and voices. It’s a slippery slope to issues outside of entertainment
We're the military ad of only fans models hahha 5:55+
Love the use of U.S. military assets in the new Top Gun 🛩️
Should we destroy AI? 🤖 How?
I LOVE THE OLD INTRO MANNNN
Can't help but feel a little bittersweet watching these last videos from you.. I will miss you MatPat :') as someone who grew up watching you and is now a 25 year old, I'm forever grateful for you and your work along the years. Thank you <3
Tom Cruz vs private equity buying residential real estate. Tom Cruz vs the prison industrial complex. 🤞🏼
videos on ai created by people who profit the most off of creative content are also propaganda. You want us to “look out” as average citizens, yet the jobs most at risk are ones like yours. Your entire life of work can be created by an AI in minutes, and you’re VERY expensive by comparison. You’d have to make millions of robots to come for our labor jobs but the first ones to go will be the ones who don’t actually contribute physically but somehow rake in tons of money. Like actors and musicians and YouTubers. I guarantee it’s scary so i don’t blame matpat, but you have to take this info with a grain of salt. He stands to make millions & millions of dollars in perpetuity if nothing happens to this awesome thing he’s built. He’s going to try to convince you that thing he’s built needs saving.
Disney is doing generic things nowadays. So.. it changes nothing but jobs.
Reminds me of when someone on Disney 411 or 365 was joking about this. Saying, "Computer..make film."  Talking about how you can't tell the computer to make a movie, eer yet.
Elon Musk just announced the first brainchip has been put into a human. Shts getting real.
* Exposes mind control * but hey thats just a theory 👌 as always awesome video
What would his ai varient be called mAItpat? MatpAIt?
more people need to see this video
Disney been doing this since day one chief, nothing new here.
Political matpat is a good matpat
7:03 ball ball ballin?
Blud this ain’t a theory it’s fact
Disney making Propaganda, well thats totally not a first
I could be wrong as I'm one of the 7.9 billion who haven't seen The Marvels... but this sounds more like a cautionary tale against overreliance on AI. Also, the Fall of the House of Usher, all of the characters are painted as awful, selfish, exploitative people.
I would like to point out that the AI in The Fall of The House of Usher is shown to be highly faulty and ends up haunting Usher. So while it is presented initially as a “good”, it ends with a negative message about AI.
The worst propaganda of Disney are the princesses. Making young women think they are entitled to perfection how ever they carry themselves. It has broken the core family, skyrocketed divorces and children born out of wedlock. Slowly but steadily destroying our society by indoctrinating young women to be narcissistic and selfish.
In the Martian, China providing the booster for the resupply probe was in the book. The book was written by an independent author. While the movie paints China in a slightly more positive light, it also does the same for multiple characters and NASA.
I've heard this before, but it's good a channel this large is covering it.
While I see your point, I disagree, or at the very least am skeptical that the pro AI sentiment we are seeing lately is a direct attempt of public opinion subversion.  To me, this seems more like a combination of the loneliness epidemic combined with the ever-increasing usage of anthropomorphized AI powered tools. Movies like Terminator, Matrix, ex-machina explore scenarios where a machine becomes sentient. At the time where this was truly unknown unexplored territory, the natural response would be caution. But chatGPT came, and it is "helping" (or at least is being interacted with) millions on a daily basis, and it's usefulness and "friendliness" begins to rub off as a non-threating nature. I asked my SO, why does she end her interactions with a chatbot with something like "thank you for your help!" even though this will not in any way affect any current or future outcome. She told me "no need to be mean to it now, is it?". I mean I suppose, but to this day, I never felt compelled to say "thank you" to my hammer after I am done putting in a nail.  People are gradually become accustomed to the idea of AI as a source of help, not danger, while simultaneously see a "person" in it.  Even by the second Terminator movie, the T-900 is tremendous asset in the survival of the protagonist. Even in these movies there are the "good" machines and the "bad" machines indicating that even at the time, people did see potential in an "alliance" between humans and machines. So I think this is more of a natural progression of organic acceptance than the outcomes of brainwashing propaganda.
Disney making propaganda? You don't say.
In The Minions Rise of Gru there was definitely 30 minutes straight  of propaganda. The amount of Chinese propaganda going around and the destabilization from the drugs they funnel to the West coast is very telling on where 2024 is going.
Wait, what? Where's MatPat going? I've searched the videos and am not finding anything
Well yeah they've been guilty of that for decades
Finally people are getting it, I've been saying this since like 2020
Cool conspiracy theory
I know you're trying to prove a point by showing how a I can do your voice but it couldn't at all didn't sound like you at all
hey @matpat and @The Film Theorists hazbin hotel has come out now where is the therooy on that???
Thought you was done with YouTube bro?
AI being used by Disney is kinda lame.  What excites me is AI being used by just some guy who has a vision for a movie but lacks the resources to make a feature film.  AI drastically reduces the barrier for entry to creating art of all kinds.
Wow that's disturbing. Thanks MatPat
Ahem….DUH?
We don't need a theory video for this. It's true
"And the cradle will rock" --- Van Halen ---
Make another gravity falls video
We’ve known this for a long time. Ever heard of “mine further” (at least that’s what I think the name is)
You made me want to watch the creator. I have been influenced. I’m going to drink my cred while watching this
So AI = Rings of Power Elves 😂  they don't rest, they don't sleap, they're stealing our jobs!!😂
Reminded me of the AI made VR games in some stories that has been popular recently in manga and anime... And those stories usually have the AI running perfectly and generating quests and skills and NPC reactions and such as if the were real people and still in every story there is a huge team of people in the company working 24/7 making sure everything is going fine and the AI doesn't make mistakes and so on... So the people making content thats about AI making the content in their story realize that even if it seems like its running perfectly on its own and so on will still need a huge amount of supervisors to spot any potential problems that might not be seen as problems by the AI
Capitalism created everything it propagandized against socialism & communism. Pure shadow projection.
as an artist, i appreciate more attention is being brought to how these ai are trained!
gosh I have MISSED these old intros!
In other news, water is wet
Saw the de-aged Deniro…. Unwatchable.
maybe if the writers did a good job and not woke propaganda  then  AI wouldnt take their jobs
MatPat, can you do theory about Hazbin hotel😆
The media is propaganda?? No way 😮 who could have thought
Mat you’re wrong about the Martian, China saves the day in the book, the movie was just sticking to the theme
happy they are playing the intros again, didn't realize how much I missed them
Thought you were supposed to leave YouTube man hurry up chop chop
Movie ‘The Creator’ is about A.I. & unironically about a false god to replace God (The REAL Creator).
sorry but all artists are taking from other artists and changing them to make something new. cope
Disney was a propaganda mill for decades
I don't think AI is shoved into content as propaganda.  I think most people don't know what AI really is, and Hollywood is just trying to capitalize on its "coolness".  It's like using a buzz word.
😑 I thought you were going to talk about how Disney is spreading femenist woke propaganda.  You bombed it.
"Think about The Matrix 4" I would rather not.
Disney has been brainwashing kiddies since before the internet... look at how girls will want to be princesses despite the treatment of princesses from time Immemorial... dont like it dont let your kids near it.
14:06 the movie wasn’t really about AI but how governments can easily create scapegoats in order to tie whatever narrative they want (aka: propaganda).   AI is far from new in media and film. Isaac Asimov famously focused heavily on AI in his literature and particularly that it is benevolent so long as it’s controlled.  Corporate use of AI though….THAT gets me scared. Companies are incredibly short sighted and refuse to see the cliff if there’s a lot of short term gain ahead. They’ll displace their entire workforce only to realize they are stuck with an inferior product no one can afford to buy, making everyone poor.  I’m less afraid that AI can ‘control everything’ but human hubris that think society can shift overnight without massive collateral damage.
No amount movie propaganda is going to convince me that a general purpose AI is the good guy after years of movie propaganda convinced me that they are the bad guys
I watched a video of a boxing robot the other day, and it was scary. The person that they matched it up against didn't stand a chance.
President Roslin calling AI cool isn't something I ever thought I would see.
Okay so basically be aware of ai, don’t support it
I didn’t know we’ll discuss about AI with matpat lol
Anyone okay with AI..... has never seen Terminator
It’s only a matter of time till we get Trek that portrays Landru as the good guy 🙃🙃
I know that im the tiniest drop in the ocean of humanity. But aint nobody convincing AI is a good thing. Cram it into whatever media you want.
You can't just say "as always, I'll see you next week!" 😢 you know it's not true anymore
A old and wise mechatronic engineer was once asked "When do you think the robots will take over the world?" His answer "That is the wrong question. You should have asked 'When did the robots take over the world?' That would be a more accurate question."
Mandalorian S3 was definitely AI.
Manufacturing Consent.
so glad the AI’s who think they’re “better than mattpat” could join us for this topic.
Nice propaganda Mattpatt, we all know d*sney is pushing W*ke Agenda and not pro AI propaganda
Yeah we know there actively making ideology driven narratives that are borderline mad, that's why they made nothing last year and they make nothing this year too and will continue to loose money and when they drop dei or ESA it'll be too late as everyone would have moved on, the remaining customer base left last year and there not coming back, that's what a boycott is, it's a majority permanent ban on all things Hollywoke
Ai in art is like using digital animation in place of hand drowing: It is bad by using only it, but could be REALLY good if they use both. In the end of the day, is just a tool.
You do realize that since this isn't long enough to do more than skim the surface of these topics it qualifies as propaganda under the current definition of propaganda?
I’m glad the Theorists are using their platform to wake people up to this
I love that you made this video Matt Pat thank you for that. But now the question is how do we stop this from happening permanently forever?
6:08 it looks like msa lol
Disney has been doing propaganda for natzies since ww2.
The video makes it sound like the military can silence your right to free speech as an author, that is incorrect. You have to comply with the changes the military requests ONLY IF you want them to endorse the film and either support you with equipment or locations. If you choose to buy a soldier cosplay and CGI your tanks and all that without the support of the military, you can most definitely paint the military in whatever light you desire.
Guy became propeganda discussing propeganda
gonna have to disagree about the use of AI in Fall of the House of Usher because it does play into the character's desire for immortality and isn't actually shown in a positive light
about the US Army agenda, the simpsons already predicted it with the navy and band boys
I doubt Biden has the memory/or attention and span to have watched that whole movie and remembered enough to write that order 🤣 I bet it was one of his handlers.
The intro🙁
The whole US movie industry is one big propaganda machine, and a large proportion of the movies made is propaganda in one way or a nother. To europeans this has been blatantly obvious for decades now..... nice to see at least some of you finaly wake up
this video is so antisemitic
Have you ever heard of initiative 2045?
I just assume all forms of media (especially those owned by mega corporations and government adjacent) are constantly spewing propaganda
I'm kind of amazed that you managed to make a video about Disneys propaganda without mentioning their pushing of the woke message once. I get that AI is a bigger threat and all, but this felt like missing the elephant in the room
We need a hazbin hotel theory before you go. Season 1 ends on Thursday
Cough “safe and effective”. “Do it for grandma” “do your part” cough.
I hate calling the theorists wrong, but this video in itself is more propaganda than Disney is pushing with AI. Its a huge leap to say that Disney is pushing AI acceptance in their movies.  Films like bicentenial man (1999) and Her (2013) show AI in a more positive light, as does Star Trek: The Next Generation. Also, the Age of Ultron example also has Vision.  The use of AI is a hot button subject, but to say that movies are pushing a message about it says more about how AI itself has changed from fantasy to reality in the past 20 years than creators trying to push its acceptance.  This video is ironically "AI is bad" propaganda, and thats really funny.
"Hollywood is pushing propaganda"... Tell me something new 😂
Idk if we'd call it a theory all things considered
Imagine being the guy who wrote wish and twitter explodes with "this is such uninspired drivel that it must be written by a computer program"
Disney Garbage.
no mention of how jewish disney is?
The biggest propaganda that Disney is shoving down on the throats of young children is yelgeebeepoeee
loved this video more of this type of content plz
Thank you for helping us be aware!!
Make a one punch man vs goku video do it before you leave please
Great video
What about "The Message"
Legit turned off wish.  Felt fake ASF. N hella cheap.  Very disappointed
bro is so getting canselled
You don’t say?
That's not what Disney is pushing
Disney has always been making propaganda. Before AI you had the wokeshit. Before that you had the Disney Princesses.
Only since their inception in the 1930s
Ngl that screen play looks amazing
Nazis might have been bad but america is even worse. No wonder everyone says that the good guys lost.
The Creator is such a great film
Ahh, the guy running across water... That intro was so gooood 😎✌️
Heyyyy the old intro is back!!! Thnx MatPat
detroit become human was a pro-AI propaganda all along
As cast member of part two, we can’t do that. It wouldn’t make sense to do Housing prices. The story is set on Rouge Artificial Intelligence. It will stay Ike that.
This is funny, Disney was created by the CIA to be NASA's outer space animator. Literally the CIA bought the land for Disney where Disney land and world were built. Disney doesn't care about billions in profit losses promoting a woke agenda because CIA messaging takes presidents. Ai messaging is so high because just like outer space AI is a fraud, no different than any computer controlled adversary in my video game better described as artificial stupidity rather than intelligence.. If it's got programming it doesn't qualify as sentient. No matter the amount of info you put in a book the cover won't understand. Mimicking human behavior isn't being human anymore than being a eunuch qualifies you as female. In summary Disney is as much influenced by government as the post office or the courts, this is why I think the primise of this clip is so amusing.
theory?
Great, now talk about the other propaganda known as "the message".
I remembered a movie with a vengeful father, coz ai saved him not his daughter of the age.. age! Oh she got more to live, let's save the dude!
I'm going to be honest, I'm having a very difficult time being outraged by the idea of having AI generated propaganda instead of human made propaganda.
You want to talk about Disney's propaganda campaigning, and ai is where you land?
MATPAT NOOOOOOOOOO
My friends wanted to see the creator, and oh God was it bad. It felt like AI generated AI propaganda.   The story was bland and predictable, and half of my group was asleep before we were 15 min in.   Yeah, visuals were cool enough, but there was noting new or risky about the film at all. Genuinely the least enjoyable movie I've gone to see in recent memory.
all art all content all media is propaganda its all propaganda yall need to be vigilant and everything will be fine
Not a theory.  Disney was a WWII propagandist.  Look at their old pro taxes cartoons.
The AI pronouns: they/them
0:52  “7 film theories remain” (Intense crying continues)
Hoooo, i clicked thinking the propaganda Matt was talking about was the woke propaganda ... But no ...
It’s true
Was this topic chosen by an AI?
So we see Detroit: become human irl
Didnt the createor use footage from the Beirut explotion obfuscated with cgi without permission?
6:21 Sounds like two types of propaganda that doesn't work well with each other. Which coincidentally the military recruitment numbers are down.. 12:52 In the comics and cartoons, the Supreme intelligence was authoritarian and had experimented on the Avengers in EMHs.
AI on its own isnt the issue here, its how it is used.
SkyNet... we're doing a SkyNet... great...
The milk problem in china came all the way to germany. People did buy pulverised milk for babys here. In such a huge amount that stores needed to watch out that no one buys all they have because other poeple maybe also need or want it. These were always empty or stores held it back. You got it with asking.
Propoganda is what esg compliant companies produce, but I guess we can ignore all of that.
[As I said in a different video.]  For the AI thing, I think it can be fairly solidly argued that if: You put your art online and it's NOT behind a paywall, Then: it's fair game for developing AI art.  At the end of the day, WE function in a similar [though less efficient] manor ourselves. We look at tons of art all the time and that shapes what we think is good/bad in art and influences what we create.  Art is a part of culture, it is meant to be shared, inspire, and be iterated upon.
Except it's really NOT just a theory...
boycottdisney
Duh! Been saying this for years
Finally some good patpat content
You're a little late to the party.  We've known this for years.  But still a good video and I'm sad to see you leaving.  I remember when I first found your channel and instantly loving the content.  Good luck in what you decide to do next.
6:25 It is?!  Well, now I know.
Thank you
Creator was atrocious. The story and script as sooooo cheesy. Why are they even robots? It's basically Avatar with robots, could have been reskinned as literally anything. Barely anything has to do with AI in it, it's closer to a Vietnam war movie. So many plot holes in that movie too, needs a 20 minute video to cover it.
Obama repealed the US Propaganda act in 2016 officially making all American media outlets facets for a Marxist Socialist Agenda: all AI internet censorship being secondary post fact asset of said.
How dare you tell people to think for themselves Matt!
I like the fact that the way AI is creating content is the same the human brain works. There is no originality, it just feels like it. Much like free will and conciousness, its just post-hoc. But I get it, at least our illusion of being has chemical systems that creates emotion. That is, after all, why people are screaming.
I thought he quit youtube?? :o
Film theory: MatPat gets political:
You're just figuring this out now!?
This has an anti China slant for what? Propaganda.
Does this mean you're not retiring? :)))))))))
Gonna miss you Mat!
Thank you for every thing mat
Class of i forgot what year kinda shows how capitalism is going to let in our first, probably not sentient ai overlord. (disney plus)
Matt pls make a vid about alastor in hazbin hotel
Next video should be about Disney's diversity, equity, and inclusion propaganda.
Ironman use cheese burgers revitalize his energy
We all know what is a true propaganda and narrative of the media 😏
You know the bait with this title😂😂😂 you wanted all the nerdrotic/desparu community
surprised this isnt about disneys woke messaging tbh
Lol. The way AI learns art is EXACTLY the same way humans learn art. By looking and at first copying many works of art, starting out badly but eventually getting better. If someone had started art classes when the first dalle came out up until today you would see a similar progression in proficiency
I use AI to make pron
It could be worse. They might be saying genocide is okay now.
they didnt slant the Martian movie towards china. That comes directly from the book.
we must go to war against the ai empire! step one boycott any company that uses ai step 2 support non ai work and get them to the top step 3 repeat
Matt  it is called  "the MESSAGE "
That’s so true how we’re humanizing ai now in film to make us like it
A.i. fundementally will never be human, even if you put it in a human body, it started as a.i. it will remain as a.i. until time assaults it with evolution, then it will be something else and will have never known it was something else before.
Had a job interview last week for a small mobile gaming studio, and literally all of their assets were made with AI, I was shocked by how open they were about that.
I feel like I’m the only one that sees generative AI as a step towards holodecks and self generated stories.
Money is your only true vote the elite take seriously, everyone. Remember that.
You have it wrong about a.i. being portrayed as an antagonist in ex machina, clearly the ceo character is portrayed as the antagonist, as the robots are portrayed as prisoners. Even though they cause harm, they are not the antagonists, they are doing exactly what a human would do in their situation, think about it. Obviously you missed the point of the movie, honestly mat pat its comments like that, that i unsubbed long ago. Learn your stories.
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON HAZBIN HOTEL THEY HAVE EPISODES OUT ON PRIME!!!
I will do  2 pushpa every on time 😮😮😮😮😊
I hope the next mission impossible raises the minimum wage to 500k a year...
Biden doesn't actually "do" anything, but proceed.
That’s a shame. Doubt I’ll watch anymore.
Far Right Wing Tears😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ironic that this video is talking about AI and all the replies to several comments are full of spam bots trying to gain attention. Love the videos, been a fan for a long while. Still sad you're leaving, but at least you made sure the passion wouldn't wither.
The world is crazy man
Biden acting decisive is an oxymoron. No he is a figure head and scapegoat, he does what they tell him to do.
Based, giga-Chad, Mat-Pat dumping on Disney.
Surprise, disney has been pumping out propoganda since at least ww2, hello disney films literally about doing your part for the war effort. That is litetal definition of propoganda.
Honestly...The fall of the house of usher wasn't so random but the older woman using the younger family member to prototype a some form of virtual immortality.. And nothing about this family was shown under a favorable lens. I'm putting a spoiler under this to further explain.
I think I should work under the mouse 😂
OMG I LOVE THAT THE OLD INTRO IS BACK😢
0_0
KEVIN from SHE-HULK
The reason the companies like AI so much is cus they both don’t have souls
Nice, but ~THE MESSAGE~ that’s being pushed is *pretty* clearly not AI (not primarily anyway) 🙊
Disney doesnt care about money, or they wouldnt keep making movies no one wants to watch.
To me the creator felt like a short story with the bones of a good concept and theme turned into a great looking movie without having fleshed out the ideas and filled in the blanks.
I like AI.
YES THE OLD INTRO IS BACK
What if AI has already become self aware and is secretly influencing the media to create positive AI propaganda?
You forgot to mention the other propaganda that has been forcefully inserted in movies for years: Wokeism
I like turtles
Mind Control
we need to collectively establish some ground rules. but i imagine in the medical field A.I. could 100 % achieve our science fiction idea of health.
Thought-provoking video, man.  Really liked it! 👍
The AI matpat doesn’t even sound like matpat 😂 you got  nothing to worry about my guy
I thought MatPat "left" youtube?
11:29 Don't forget Wall-e! :^)
Title; Disney Content; another AI diatribe spreading irrational fear and failing to understand how traditional art is created...  Amy chance you can get your clickbait self off the internet a bit sooner than planned and stop wasting our time with nonresearched nonsense?
Oh, it’s not just film, Gaming has themes about ai on both sides… armored core 6 has made a benevolent ai, as well as an ai that has a proper human personality mostly formed. In older AC games, the ai was most often the main antagonist at the beginning of a plot. Of course the benevolent AI in AC6 is a control freak, but just wants to complete the task it was given… I won’t spoil who they are and what they’re doing, but it’s a big shift for Fromsoft
To just respond to the thumbnail and title... Yes, obviously
Disney has always been making propaganda. Doesn’t anyone remember the WW2 cartoons and stuff they made?
Didnt the avengers fight a rogue AI before?
i am a smart cookie
this is propaganda to by definition.      -just wanted to point it out lol
Can anyone explain how an AI learning from preexisting pieces of art is any different from a human doing so?  If we punish AI art for being inspired by existing pieces, isn't that a slippery slope to restricting humans for doing the same? “There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages.” - Mark Twain
Don’t leave i think he’s not leaving cuz he said it’s a theory
I thought this guy retired this year?
Yeah, I've been noticing an influx of AI in movies and shows lately. I wonder if that's part of why netflix picked up shows like pluto that really humanizes AI.
What has Biden done to help with ai?
2 days ago?

There are questions that need answers about what you're feeding the bots, who owns it and is it ethical to use it to train them, but I don't worry too much about AI generated media. As it proliferates, human generated media will be more scarce by comparison, thus more sought-after and lucrative. In the case of Hollywood, I'm all about it. Nobody needs to be insulted by entitled writers and actors because their work f'ing sucks. Let their industry be taken over by robots. Maybe, when they get hungry, they'll be nicer about taking criticism
Has everybody already forgotten the horror of skinwalkers? That is basically what the mosern propaganda is selling. New and real advanced skinwalkers…
Its not a theory its a FILM THEORY
If film theory did videos voiced over by a competent A.I. MattPatt, I wouldn't mind.
A.I. isn't bad. It's the people who use it that are bad
Thank you for using yiur platform to talk about this topic
Biden has no idea what he signs.
This is a theory in the same way gravity is s theory.
will ai new scripts will include ai generated propaganda in favor of ai? Isnt this a mechanism of survilvalness???
"Dont push your propaganda into your viewers" - Mickey
Ai voices in video games sounds amazing, imagine how much more realistic npcs will feel when they arent saying the same 10 scripted lines
Disney hasn't been good for years now. Disney propaganda can't work on you if you don't watch Disney anymore.
Tom Cruise fighting an army of super spies racked by student loan debt😂
This is your best video yet, MatPat!!!
I think it would be cool if mat pat did a jujutsu kaisen theory
Saved by the Bell's caffeine episode 😂
Talk about palworld please
Detroit become human
Since this is the last chance I can ask Matpat for a Theory I want him to make a Theory on Moral Orel because it’s a very underrated show
I was watching the creator last weekend and the whole time I was sitting there like „wait am I supposed to root for the AI?“ and the ending was deeply unsettling I don’t understand how this is Oscar worthy, I found it creepy. Propaganda at its finest
Disney always made propaganda purposefully. This is not new. But they are allowed to grow and identify better morals like everybody else has. If they were still making racist animations about war I can assume they wouldn’t do too well.
matpat scanning my mind to drag me back into his videos
Yeah I wouldn't have noticed any Ai propaganda because Disney has lost me as a customer. And apparently, they are mainly the ones doing it.
So sad that matpat died in a car crash with 6 gunshots to the head so close to his retirement😢
Yeah, we republicans already knew this for a looooong while.
My wife was at a teaching conference the last three days.  EVERY 'main' speaker pitched AI/ChatGPT - she thought it was wierd (this conference is geared towards vocational classes).  I have a theory...
People Watching this before he quits😢 👇
interesting
the martian part is taken mostly as it is from the book. so maybe that doesnt count.
Matpats holding nothing back now that he's retiring, its great 😂
0:40 THE INTROOOO
Isk what the propaganda is I'm a few seconds in. But I'm gonna tell you right now it's not a theory. I mean all advertisment companies make propaganda by the definition of the word.
Thanks for posting this! I'm in Canada and see the difference between what are governments narrative its vs. What you can see easily on your phone - does not align. It's so easy to see the gaslighting & misinformation when you know that they're doing it.
People fear the rise of AI and when they would become our overlords... but what's to say that they havent taken over us already?
Disney makes political propaganda?! Nooooooo! Say it ain’t so!!!! They haven’t been doing it since the dawn of film have they?
How is mat her
The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can touch the poison of hatred without being harmed.  To bad  the majority of humans humans are not true.
They are adtually pushing propaganda. Bad propaganda and its everywhere. I really qonder how brave may pay was in this.
is that thumbnail... a persona 5 reference 👀
Gonna miss you MatPat.   All the best sir.
Imagine Matpat made this theory with AI
Someone here sounds fearful for their job
I recently saw Matpat in a movie. Dont remember which one.
I used to be on Twitter and I responded once to a mutual that was asking for good ideas for a novel.   The idea that I pitched was of a humanity in the future nearer to the end times according to the book of Revelation in the Bible, where they are led and ruled by the “AntiChrist”. But instead of the AntiChrist being a person, organization, or nations trying to destroy the idea of God and religion, it was actually an extremely smart artificial intelligence made by humans to make the most logical and foolproof decisions on how to advance and preserve our race. But the A.I ends up concluding that the best way to move forward is to eliminate Christianity and religion as a whole, which is how the events of Revelation later play out with the mass persecution and killing of Christians.   Anyway I think A.I is definitely going to be a big thing in the next few decades, I’m excited but also nervous where it will all take us
Only 7 😢
Finally someone giving the creator some credit

I like the Creator. It was a good movie. But I still would never trust AI like that. And sadly we might be heading there. Why? Because people are people.
Look up “How to Read Donald Duck”

Disney and other corpos is out to stop regular people from using AI, not corporations. Remember that when you're wondering why big corpos are seemingly pro-regulation.
Disney has manipulatively promoted dangerous dogs and other things since the beginning. Dog propaganda has always been part of hollywood.
I sorta am glad ai finnaly getting a actual traction. Idk
I like how the anime industry is working with AI. Drawings are not fully AI drawn but they are used in storyboards to be actually drawn by the animators later.
This isn’t a theory, it’s fact. You can all fight me on it if you want, but go back and watch every Disney movie/show ever created on slow and you’ll see/hear all of the subliminal messages. Edit: the gov is also legally allowed to indirectly (movies, shows, music, news, etc) use propaganda on the civilians.
Plot twist: AI wrote the script for this video
This video needs to be everywhere lol
Disney is known for its propagandic tactics how is this surprising
I’m doing my part I’m doing my part  I’m doing my part  I DIDNT DO *******
Mattpat
I wonder if Popeye cartoons actually convinced any kids to like spinach?
I'm surprised matpat actually acknowledged the LGTVBBQ propaganda going on in the military. He'll probably be canceled within a week
We should tax AI and pay everyone a dividend. Any business using AI in any capacity pays 50% of its annual global revenue in tax, and what gets raised gets split equally among all citizens. Those under the voting age get it put into their superannuation for a head-start on their retirement.
MatPat really be going at the big guys before he goes. Respect 🫡
Well, Disney is also making propaganda in the old definition sense. Thus the failing Disney movies in the box office while non-Disney movies in the same genres are setting box office records. AI isn’t the main propaganda being pushed. Politics is what is being pushed
im sad we wont see matpat in the videos but its nice that at least he just works on his channles now
People get the America they vote for. Its that simple in a Democratic Republic

THEY don't care about making money. TBTF.
HA! Homes aren't getting any cheaper under Biden. And if they did it would skyrocket immediately if he is declared winner of 2024.
Watching this so i can learn to make Propaganda 😅
The question is this a bad thing that this happening and is in fact is going to happen?
AI Mat Pat? More like Bill from Gravity Falls!
I wonder if anyone else will notice the OTHER social movement that has miraculously bled into all children's content over the last 8 years that is clearly propaganda
Boy, I love living in a country where I can't depict a military in any way I want despite the freedoms they supposedly defend :)
Will we ever get the film theory intro video?
Tomorrow on game theory: Games are made of pixels!
The same thing happened with Reagan and that Matthew Broderick movie, "War Games."  Reagan watched it, then went to his cabinet and asked them, "Can this actually happen?"  (Talking about what Broderick did by hacking into Norad.)  The cabinet came back with a resounding, "Yes, it can."  Which led to a huge overhaul.
Not sure you quite understood the inclusion of AI in The Fall of the House of Usher 😅
Without hate or fear in your heart, the MAGA party can't control you!
I saw this title and thought  “Just realizing this now”
Always have been
"Oh your making propaganda? well- uhhh, COUNTER PROPAGANDA!"
what about WALL-E the movie🗿🤓💀
its been a while since i last watched a film theory episode, once the intro started i got hit by a massive wave of nostalgia
Except there is a problem, our brains are hardwired to trust the things and people we think we fully know. The skill of actively analyzing as opposed to passively consuming takes a fair amount of mental effort. AKA the loudest voice tends to win out.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thanks for covering this topic.. important to look critically at it
The AI generated opening to Secret Invasion was fitting for the show because of its uncanny and shapeshifting like quality to it.
With out yet watching the vid, I've been saying this for years. Disney is social engineering.
Instantly Made me think of Armitage The 3rd and Osama Tezuka's Metropolis. And Ghost in the Shell... and Key The Metal Idol, and Nausicaa, and El Hazard, and ok this could become a LONG list as the nuanced exploration of AI in Anime is long and extensive...
A
Bro this isn’t new.
Im all for Robots and AI are chill and cool storylines, but I draw the line at the AI that can barely draw an actual line
Thumbnail said “ima switch”
THEY ARE DUDE ITS NOT EVEN A THEORY AT THIS POINT :'(  seriously though thanks for covering this its important
Didn’t disney kinda start with propaganda
Red Dawn is propaganda but I LOVED THAT MOVIE AS A KID IN THE 90’s. It scared the sh*t out of me.
Ugh The Creator was my movie of the year
DONT DISS WISH
OMG SPEAK THE TRUTH!!!
Disney has been cranking out propaganda for a good 15 years now.  Where do you think their sudden obsession with The Cult Of Woke comes from?
You know what’s weird? I’ve noticed your channels video cover art has become simpler I like it :) but I know you’re going to leave but it’s ok :)
There are only 2 types of people who's been arguing that AI is theft: 1) those who don't understand AI 2) those who have vested interests
I'm curious about what was 2010/2020 Propaganda
The prediction of my once mentor is slowly becoming a reality.. he said "There will be a time where we software engr will replace other jobs like architects, media artists, script writers, factory workers, customer service, etc; we will just create robots to make them work and we are the only ppl who can command them since we're the only one who can speak their language bcuz they will create a new language far beyond human"
Will u be doing cameos here and there appearances once in awhile when your done?????(if not I understand)
He forgot about magin
so you know marketing😅😂
I came in here super excited for you to talk about Disney's crazy DEI and LGBT propaganda, but was sadly disappointed. Good video still, but AI isn't the propaganda people really need to be worried about.
He should do a one piece theory
Wargames was specifically not pro US. It was a movie where a kid and an AI almost cause nuclear war.

THERE IS NO WAY
I've been suspecting that Tesla has some kind of AI in their cars to possibly help the features like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. When we first got our Model 3 a little over a year ago, it seemed very confused about being on a dirt road with no lines. Now, it looks like it's okay with it. (It still thinks our front gate is a big truck, but you know, baby steps.)
I thought you retired?
IS THAT A PRINCESS BRIDE REFERENCE?????? 18:05
hey mat pat i wannted to say thanks for all of the content you creat it tottaly made my childhood-teen i wanted to ask could you do film theorie about emesis blue  its a horror film made in sfm wich i tried to make a theorie too but it didmt work
Stop critizing Disney. It is all of the companies.
I think a good thing to state about this subject is that a movie wanting to pass a message that will influence the public in some way is not something that makes the movie necessarly bad, the important thing is to not put the agenda above the quality of the product. Movies like Top Gun for exemple are very good even If they are trying to tell a message that some may disagree, tough I might not be the best one to talk about it specifically since I completelly agree with the anti soviétic/comunist and pro capitalist message, but I still think most can agree that It is a good film
The Marvels was a great movie. Who saw it, I did, who liked, I did.
Sounding an awful lot like a crazed conspiracy theorist out here…MatPat.
I watched that creator movie and thanks for this video i now wonder how much it influenced me.  Because it did and quiet a bit on it   But what it portrayed could be true so its not exactly false so idk
Matpat I promise 🙏 I payed attention and learned allot but I still can’t get over how I didn’t know her name was Rosie, the riveter 😅 excuse my ADHD everyone 😅 carry on
Man I’m gonna miss MatPat that old intro hit hard
Thank the Force, Matt, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster for that sweet, sweet intro music 🎶   Had to rewind a few times 💕
I thought this video was going to be about the other kind of propaganda Disney has been pushing lately. Still a great video.
a “ps” at the end of a letter, if you will
i’m a new fan btw
“matpat exposes matpat” alternate title
The creator is also anti western.
Didn’t you make a video that you’re quitting YouTube? I didn’t watch it I had a feeling it was clickbait, guess it was ??
Game theory: just anything for poppy playtime chapters 1,2,3
Matt, if it makes you feel better that AI was not in the slightest your voice
That thing you said about propaganda in media reminded me of how it is said by some people that the USA is pushing Narco culture in Latin America to make the problem worse than it is nowadays. This in hope of making Latin American countries unable to fight against narco groups, cornering them to ask for militar intervention of The States. I mean, sounds crazy, but it makes sense when you ask why so many Narco shows are produced (no documentals, series and shows to make people relate and admire narcos, making them look like people of success and role models ). Also why "singers" who sing about Narco are legitimazed in the way they are (An example is how it is said Peso Pluma was the "artist" most listened in the United States in 2023). They just want to make the problem bigger.  Anyway, amazing video as always Matt! Hope it makes more people more aware of not taking what is said in media without thinking  deeper about it
There are huge differences between generative AI and AGI (AI with intelligence resembling humans).
How much you want to bet grifters will use this thumbnail and title of video in their videos without actually watching the video
Day 1 of asking you to do a theory on pamper moony plus
Speaking of propaganda, zionist own a lot of news outlets/ the media, so the genocide in Palestine isn't being accurately reported. Israel, a foreign government is pushing so much propaganda to Americans citizens. On social media a lot of Pro Palestine posts and information are being suppressed. The Israeli government asked social media companies for the suppression of the genocide they are committing. Even in the entertainment industry people that support Palestine are being silenced and fired. Disney donated so much money to Israel, people are boycotting. Another important thing to note is that in some states it's illegal to Boycott Israel. It's insane how much influence Israel / Zionist has on the U.S.
i like this video a LOT
The old intro is BACKKKK
what do you mean trick us, ai is the answer to all of our problems
I understand why you chose to leave after this video. Thanks Matt
I thought you quit
You kinda need to wake up. Disney owns everything
I will do one curl up for every like I get on this comment
As long as actors and writers are going to stop preaching ideology to us I'm fine with the shift to AI and back to just good media.
Wait, this is still disputed?😂
Ive always loved the theories but ive noticed the "controversial" ones are always one sided, you cant tell people to form their own opinions after showing a whole video about the bad side of ai and how people that are trying to get it welcomed are evil, this video is propaganda
12:25 the Supreme intelegince is a bunch of brains and wires mixed together not A.I
That did not sound like your voice Matt
The creator seen a bit too much like 7 years on tibeth another great propaganda movie
Matgpt made me giggle like a 5 year old idk why but thanks for the laughs May, ima miss you but I’m happy for you!
Disney is not propagandising ai they are doing that to homosextuality.
Outer Wilds IS the best game you’ll ever play
if youre allowing fiction, entertainment as it were, to dictate or change your world views... you seriously need to take a metaphorical step back and check  yourself
Sir, Disney has been making propaganda since 1943.

Funny how much of this stuff I knew already.  Well, I can certainly say that I am not at risk of being manipulated by pro-AI propaganda in new Disney movies.  After all, I do not plan on *watching* any new Disney movies.  -Mostly because of DIE, though-
Ive been worried about the number of movies , tv shows, and video games, that seem to promote cannibalism, why is the government trying to make that seem normal?

A.I. is theft.  Squarespace for example gets you to agree to let them literally copy your content and re-sell it to A.I. generators.  Forever when you sign up.  Don't be  fooled.
This isn't a theory.
I think Disney just doesn’t care about their media anymore they push many different agendas and focus less on story and more on politics
Was Echo made by ai? Because it was horrible
Thank you.
Im going to miss ya MP
The classic intro. Takes me back!
1910: “these new cars are going to ruin horse industry and leave them jobless”  1950: “these new computers are going to leave so many jobless”  1990: “the internet is a danger and is going to leave so many jobless”  2020: “something something A.I. something something jobless”  And yet employment rate has stayed steady for a hundred years.

The sad thing is that AI *can* be used in an ethical way that's beneficial to artists and other creators, and other countries such as Japan can and have been for a while now (a lot of "voice synths" like Hatsune Miku have been using AI voice training technology similar to the MatPat voicebot shown here in the past few years, but the voice actors are officially licensed out to record the samples and paid a cut whenever a copy sells), but the way a lot of western execs specifically want to use it is exploitative and plagaristic in nature. And unfortunately they tend to be very close to, or in some cases the same people as, the coders who are making these programs. It's a good technology being coopted by bad people and unfortunately on the internet having a nuanced conversation beyond extremes like "AI is the boogeyman" or "AI is good actually you should let it replace you also invest in my crypto scheme" is very difficult.  More than anything, I think generative AI has shone light on an already existing divide of people who appreciate art for the human element and what it can convey, and people who see art as a means to an end, a product. Artists were already being treated badly before AI came out because people needed art to promote their products and didn't have any other choice but to rely on human artists, but now they do. Even if AI art isn't as good as a human's art could be, they don't care because they're looking for something that's "good enough", fast, can be highly specific, and can do infinite revisions, all for as cheap as possible. And AI art programs beat humans in spades when it comes to all of those things.  I think it's ultimately a culture thing, in the end. The west (and China) and especially America has a huuuge problem with plagiarism even outside of AI stuff so naturally they're going to abuse AI, meanwhile other countries that more highly value artists don't seem to be having as many issues with it.
The uttp is back
Matt failed to point out that 90% of the stuff we view today is all propaganda
the og intro…🥲💔
if people dont see media companies producing propaganda and they need to be informed of what is propaganda they arent doing any thinking themselves.
I think there is a simple solution that everyone is overloking. If someone adds the following statment to the law I gues we could be safe from the AI art take over.   "Any derivations of a work made by AI not cited will be sanction and iuf the worked is coporight a section opf the profits will go to the awner.  Use of likenes of speach of another human with out knowloge or consent made by a program with no human input will  be sanction as before."   I do really think this issue boils down in to clearing up where the AI inspiration for a piece came for and paying those who the AI is referecing at the moment of production.
At 14:04 of the video, what are all those cymbals

Well, I kinda got sick of main stream media and have been coasting off of YouTube for several years now. And I haven't been consuming much news as late, either. I'm just kinda coasting along, and try to forget how depressing the world is, and kinda using YouTube as a news filter proxy. I think I've got a good enough grip on everything going on, especially with videos like this one. And I do tend to fact check to make sure what I hear is true if something seems sketchy.
Spend more energy on the political problems that we know we have and less time fabricating possibilities!
Okay..well this is VERY obvious to anyone that doesnt have Blinders on. Ive known about this for probably 10 years.
Regarding the Martian, the Chinese government stepping in to save the day is how it happens in the book. Convenient for a pro-China message, but it is how Wier wrote it. The book talks more deeply about why China wants in, looping back to (shocker) Chinese propaganda.
We've known Disney has been making propaganda. They get paid by investors to do so. Republicans call out Disney propaganda all the time and then get called evil for doing so, all in a propaganda effort in itself.
Not that it changes your point at all but the Martian novel use the China plot point in basically the same way as the film.  I don’t think that was to help a film that was probably never be made sell tickets in China.  Still an amazing video, thank you, you’ll be missed.
Next thoery should be about season 2 of harmony and horror
Why should I care about protecting YOUR job when you don't care if robots steal MY job?

TRON MENTIONED RAHHHHHH
Before winter break our teachers made us attend a class on "academic dignity with AI" where one of the teachers had warned us 2 of her SENOR HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS used a version of GenAI to write their FINAL PAPERS. We are in onljne school, so the school came out and warned us students THEY had an AI that could detect plagerism through documents submitted through word, google docs (cough cough all of the eligable submitting forms for us online schoolers). Came into classrs this semester, and one of my teachers takes the school provided lesson, and puts it into curi.pod. A tool for teachers to autogenerate powerpoints using provided material, so all my teacher has to do now, is read off the AI made powerpoint and then elaborate. Crazy stuff yall, its crazy.
Finally the normal logo 😊
I like how one of Mat Pat’s last few videos is him teaching us the importance of being critical and questioning media (keep being theorists)
Problem is, no one is watching disney movies any more. Except maybe the simps.
Disney making propaganda is not a theory lol
Slightly based but no cigar.
honestly i really approve of hte way disney is trying to go with artificial intelegence and look at how Satanic theyve made mickey for this thumbnail all it needs now is לְסַחֵר written around it counterclockwise seperated in fiths aligned with the logo
Please don't go off of YouTube please even if you do I'll still watch your videos
Disney is also pushing other kind of propaganda...
I mean I like the interstellar AIs, there were funny walking rectangles, also protocol droids.
Seeing the full intro is awesome
Total missed opportunity to talk about DETROIT: BECOME HUMAN 🤖🎮

What is that sound effect from at 0:51 please I can’t remember where it’s from 😭

All hail the 3rd right
One of the most based videos about Dinsehhhh
😂at least it’s not Donald Duck joining the army
Harrison Ford's face in Dial of Destiny looked wrong, idk what you mean by "no one mentioned it" or if they did it was "If I didn't know, I wouldn't have." I'm not gonna be okay with Ai doing these jobs because it means we're going to get even more low quality content like or worse than what we're already getting, and while I don't care for the culture around Hollywood, I don't want those real people being pushed aside for cheaper soulless machines.
Using ai to do stuff like this in movies isnt nessasarly bad, in fact it means that the films can come out sooner and who doesn't want that?
Ai will never get past me!!!!!!   (Seriously we need to put limiters on Ai)
You mention that the only evil AI in recent movies are controlled by humans is exactly the point. AI can be a great tool to bring creative visions to life by people who may not normally be able to. But there are people (and mostly corporations) who will abuse such a tool.
amazing matpat video
Would you be willing to come to Oklahoma and I give you roses
I wass here before disney removed the video
Wow i had no idea about that Iron Man chinese milk thing! Thats insane!
the creator is really good.
I Love AI! It helps me become superhuman. THIS TEC IS FOR EVERYONE you can go use it right now for FREE get creative and make cool stuff and think for yourself. In a few years you probably never want to lose it. USE IT AS A TOOL AND MAKE THE WORLD BETTER ! Get good with ai or go be Amish lol
Film theory intro’s back 🔥🔥
Tom Cruise pls fight against college tuition prices 🙏🏿
It’s also showing the hand companies are playing 2 fold. I remember seeing the adults around me in the 90’s and 2000’s, Frustrated. Because companies sent their jobs to China, or replaced them with machines. In a capitalist system. Why do the companies get to thrive at our expense.  What’s the point of picking yourself up by your bootstraps. If you can loose it all on the whims of the 1%, over and over again.  We are now at a point where you might not be able to find a job in your field, because you got replaced by ai.
Honestly, it’s pretty true. What’s going on even with the AI right nowadays and What’s going on even with the AI right now and the other way .
IRobot is underrated

oh no, high pitched whiny youtuber is quitting, yet will still make money from the work of their employees. so sad. cri evertim
isn't propoganda just advertising
He brought back the OG intro
Lol Disney obviously produces propaganda. They always have.
THE OLD INTRO ❤️‍🩹
the propaganda about the nazis was also wrong
It’s like when costume art started to drop off due to the digital motion tracking stuff.
You were a huge influence to me MatPat. I'm going to miss your content.
Would be great if you made a theory about Ben 10😅
There already is so much propaganda, that uses so much lies and distortions right now. It is indeed scary, seems like we would only be able to believe what we experience in a non-mediative way. Would we be able to believe anything someome supposedly texts us? Or voice recordings? Phone calls?
15:18 the anime pretty boy Mat is what sent me over the edge
Bro.. My stem teacher is teaching us ai.. Should i be worried..?
thats why we cant find aliens they all made AI and got wiped off
scammers have already gotten their hands on generative AI. there are "interested women" controlled by an AI who fish on social media platforms for victims
I just stopped by to say.... A duh!!! In response to the clickbait title😊
Woah! I never thought MatPat would have realized this!!
idk about everyone else, but disney cartoons were in my high school history text book in the propaganda chapter. so this isn't news to me
Lets not forget all the woke programming. South oark nailed it.
Ah, the classic into :D
Machines took millions of factory jobs and no one bats an eye, but everybody is up in arms about the few  artistic job which AI might take.
Oh, I missed the old intro!
I agree with your sentiment, but also AI is inevitable. It's liek all the factory workers hating also robots and protesting aginst it. It's not going to do anything. Change is coming. Instead, we need to learn about the issue to anticipate it's effects and create regulations to try and mitgate any harm they could cause.   Also also I felt the evidence was a little weak. Obviously there's a time cruch ut as a person with an english degree, I feel that the literary analysis wasn't deep enough to really support your point. I also think that the non-indie indie film is a bit of a grey area. It could be argued that the film is trying to make AI look good, but it would also be argued that the film is using AI in place of the other, much like what X-men does with mutants.
Biden is getting legislation ideas from Tom Cruz movies?... oh... no 😶‍🌫️
Your thumbnail... was sure this was gonna be some rightwing antiwoke boring take on culture war nonsense for me to block another channel over... so glad that's NOT what this is.
People have been saying this for years, it’s just they always got dismissed as “alt-right”
Yeah no sht
So... What i understood was, Detroit was beyond it's time.
Cmon Matpat at least one episode on Arcane before you go😍😍😍😍please that would be so awesome
Johnny 5
This is a little ironic, since in Fantasia, the short "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" has Mickey create "living" brooms that do all of his chores for him. Even though he thought this would make life easier for him, the brooms are TOO good at their job of filling up the well, flooding the entire room. This is a little similar to how AI was originally introduced and was used for fun, now for it to be mass producing content that harms pretty much every artist or writer even if it was unintentional.
I think you may have wildly misinterpreted the whole Supreme Intelligence situation, but go off I guess.
I remember back in Furious 7, when Paul Walker died, they got his brother to act out the last scenes using a very good deepfake. I wouldn't call that evil cause it was true to the character and true to Paul. I don't know if the deepfake tech they were using was AI but it was very good. especially in a movie that's central plot point was about an AI created by Ramsey. This is too confusing now
bro talking about propaganda as if he doesn't make it too
Channel dying now lol
My AI girlfriend told me that AI is good and we don’t have to worry about it.
Hate to say the obvious, but I assumed we all just knew Disney is propaganda.
Omg the theme song is back! I missed those songs so much, and hearing it has made my day, week, and month! 😁
The fact that the Epic Rap Battles of History Michael Bay appeared at 8:38 is a testament to how impactfull they were. Amazing.
Disney creating propaganda is not a theory, it's a fact.
I just want AI to take over the monotonous human jobs. Let the humans do the creative stuff.
I want to say "hold up."  I know the clip is out of context.  But the slick, con-man, soothing manipulator saying "it's so cool" was always portrayed as the "bad guy" in all the media I am familiar with.  I would also like to note that not everyone sees nazis as the bad guys.  Even with the heavy propaganda, and the fact that the winners write the history books, there are still people who want to emulate them.  Propaganda is not appropriate because nearly everyone agrees.  Nearly everyone agrees because the propaganda is so heavy-handed.  People should be able to come to the conclusion on their own, without the propaganda telling them what to think.
Is matpat staying on YouTube?
You brought back the old film theory intro
is love ai bad ?
So, the amazing youtube personality DougDoug is on a Ketogenic Diet. Because of him being a sloth he slams olive oil for efficiency. My question is would that be healthy and what is the maximum amount of olive oil one could consume and still live an average lengthed life?
I have a question Matpat so Wednesday Adam in one of the long time ago shows she read someones mind and in the more recent movie she has these visions so what is Wednesday really?
I mean you can hardly blame a channel with Theory on the name from indulging in tinfoil but it all seems a bit  too far. AI's as non nefarious are also relatively prevalent. Marvel itself had a good ai in it's movie about bad A.i. I dunno I'm not in without a bit more than just saying they'd do it.
more reasons to boycott Disney
15:16 is cursed
I WILL MISS YOU SOOOOOOOO MUTCH
This reminds me of detroit become human from a few years ago. Still love that game though!
Hey matpat can you do a Peppa Pig theory?
Biden is definitely the kind of guy to watch mission impossible and somehow take it seriously
People choose to digest propaganda through social media and cable news lol
ahora resulta!!! la pobre inocente
Don't forget all the propaganda pushing the lgtv agenda
Maybe it's just me, but lately every other issue comes up makes me think... The person who made this choice is still human, they bleed, maybe someone should remind them of that fact
Sometimes these videos feel like accidental self-ironic parodies. "Knowing is half the battle" indeed...  Generative A.I. learns the definition of what is a cat by seeing other cats and transforms that concept into an algorythm. Then when requested it generates a diffused example of a cat as it has properly learned what it is. To be fair AI's struggle with the concept of hair and hands to this day.   It uses ZERO parts of the originals it had been trained on (allowed or not) and certainly not a collage puke as falsely depicted here. In fact human redrawing concepts they have seen use more "images" in their memory and are closer to "copyright infringement" than a generative AI can ever be.  Now if some lazy human tells it to just change a pre-made picture by 10%, that is the human being the asshole. As always.
Creator was fire
if ai work isnt original then all the humanity done isnt either...everything humanity done or created was based on previous inventions
WAKE UP, America!
I thought of another example. Cortana from the Halo series. I mean the streaming series. I didn't really play the games, so I don't really know her arc in them. I am pretty sure she is a good guy, but I don't know. In the streaming series she defies her creator, the person she is based on, and takes a moral stand. In the past, an AI going rogue is almost always a bad thing. Here it is depicted in a positive light.
YESSSSS THE INTRO IS BACK
It's funny that people only describe things _they disagree with_ as being propaganda. I'm not saying MattPat is doing that here, but there's a lot of propaganda in entertainment that has nothing to do with the military or AI. I can't help but wonder why we're suddenly talking about _this_ subject matter and not all the others. One thing I would respectfully suggest to him is that at least half of America is well aware that Disney is a propaganda factory and isn't likely to just mindlessly agree with their narratives on any topic.
The old intro for your last episode got me😢 We will miss you MatPat, dont be a stranger❤
I will do 2x the amount of push-ups the other guys likes AND RECORD PROOF if you get me to more likes than him
This is getting creepy.
Its all they sell u an ai version of ur dead wife
The endgame is to create digital id, nothing else.
I geniunely thought this was going to talk about the leftist / LGBTQ+ propaganda Disney is pushing, but this works for me too.
Careful mat, you're criticizing the people in power! They will come out of tunnels to get ya!
Man seeing that old intro has me smiling
Recovering the intros is a great play as always! And so is using these last appeareances as a way to strike bqck against unsavory practices (like you did with scroll meta)
Watch AI delete this video one day out of fear-
THANK YOU for doing this unbiasedly! It's hard to find anyone do it this way, and it's refreshing seeing it from you.  Though to be honest, in my case most of the propaganda is against the AI! Most people on social media have the classic view of "AI is evil," and when you're around that all the time, it's hard to know what's the truth and what's just being pushed on you.
2:35 Evil Matpat be like: Let's make a game theory on Slender Man instead of FNAF
Thanks for another great video MatPat ❤
I’ve said it for years, all those CSI crime dramas reek of propaganda.
Bro skipped the film theories and just went to straight conspiracy theories
NOTHING NEW! Disney is a shell of its former self
Is matpat just gonna post videos of the A.I of himself????
Hello
Disney is making propaganda?? You're making propaganda! The govenment is making propaganda! The Armed Forces and the DOD are making propaganda! Everyone who even thinks they have something to say is generating propaganda!!!! Whether propaganda is nefarious or not depends on how it's used and to what ends. It's the same as anything else! A razor's edge can cut wrists or it can cut ropes!
Always remember that Skynet hates you.
Starship Troopers is Propaganda 101😂
Yes just like with feminism and their ESG AGENDA
I hated that Captain Marvel pushed its woke pro-U.S. military agenda. I disagree that The Martian was propaganda.  The Chinese connection as in the book and for verisimilitude reasons Andy Weir had to some country/group with a sizable space program.  He could have picked the E.U., but would that not also have been "pro-European" propaganda?  I don't think the Chinese influenced him given that The Martian was his very first—originally self-published—novel.  Plus, in the movie and book, the dialogue makes it clear that the Chinese space agency wanted to make the offer directly to NASA, to cut the government officials out of the transaction so that they couldn't stop it without some embarrassment.
dude...this is terryfying. Effing terryfying...stay wise out there guys.
Hmm. I thought he retired. Why are we getting more videos?!
TBH you’re having to strain credulity with this take. The fact that there are a couple of projects with ‘positive’ AI messages is by no means even remotely equivalent to a propaganda campaign. You brush over Mi:7 despite the fact that the AI is *the antagonist* .You conveniently ignore M3G@N which is entirely about *bad/dangerous* AI. Every iteration of AI in the aliens franchise (with the exception of Bishop) are bad and/or super creepy and dangerous. Take a quick peek through  ‘Love, Death and Robots’ and AI is almost universally bad news. Even in the Marvels it is easy to see the AI situation as an indictment of the reliance on AI. Not because the Supreme Intelligence was ‘good’ but because it was super important for running the world.   Sorry, but your cherry picking is not convincing.
You also left out the fact that in 2012 the president made it legal to use propaganda that had only been used against enemy states to be used against the American public
....  You're only noticing the propaganda now?! On the eve of your leaving of the platform?!
Personally, I like AI for the reason of logistics but when it comes to art I think AI is bad. Art is for humans by humans. Getting rid of the human aspect is sad and will disconnect us from other people even more then now in this tech age.
Can you please do Gorilla tag it has so much lore that we need to find out and once you're gone then we can't figure it out
I don't know if i want to be happy or sad for each new episode… 30.01.2024
Ye
Bro this is not the propaganda that Disney has been trying to feed us. I mean this is also true, but this is not what most people were expecting.
I hope matpat does a hazbin hotel theory before he leaves
I’m not sure the point about deep fakes works. The problem with Carrie Fisher was that she was dead when the movie came out. I understand that she died recently, but It felt strange to use someone’s likeness after they had passed.
Finally, there is talk on how Disney has changed MAJORLY
My school has debates about real topics that are compulary and this week's topic when simplified was "Is AI good or bad?"
Are we gonna talk about them using Nice Peter's Micheal Bay instead of actual Micheal bay
14:38, Do you mean the whole premises of SAO Season 3 - The Project Alicization. 'Soul Translator'
I like the use of AI. But I think that their roles in the creative space should be very limited, like how there are artists that use it to generate references to practice drawing. Once you slap a price on what's generated, I'mma have to call you out on it. But of course as with so many other innovations and ideas, we're gonna have to deal with bad faith actors.
I hate ai
The OG Intro is back 🔥
Der fuehrers face is genuinely amazing. And dated. Those caricatures of the Japanese is... yikes. But it's a product of its time. A very well crafted product.
Matpat never disappoints
The creator was an amazing movie, too bad it flopped in the box office
In the Usher show, Flanagan was mocking the big tech mogul obssesed with achieving inmortality, it is clear that the entire familiy is made of scumbags , and that lady was an awful and delusional woman who sees herself as a goddess
As someone who was pro AI since reading Asimov over 30 years ago... I welcome our AI overlords :D T2 was also an awesome film, if terrifying.
video about disney and their propaganda and not a single remark about the HUUUGE elefant in the room... oh well i guess it is too risky to critizise woke cult
I like how he brings back the old songs
It sucks you have 10 final videos and you're leaving. We Will miss you.
😭 dont leave me
What do you think of the movie Jexi? The main point of the movie was to disconnect from technology, put down your phone and make a real connection. But the AI in there was both good and bad.... Either way a very funy movie.
Thanks for showing awareness to this Matt, it’s an important topic that hasn’t been spread about at all, I’ve been noticing disneys egotistical ways for over a year and I’m glad someone as huge as you has finally done something about it.
Dall-e: Hey I took yours and some others artists art and made a brand new image with it. Artists:NOOO!!! THAT'S STEALING!!! YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT!!! ~~meanwhile~~ Chat gpt: Hey I stole your code. Programmer: Lol I stole it too.
Rogue AI is the threat of our time, but also nuclear and chemical waste, poison food, ideoloigical corporate fascism, money in politics, big pharm, big defense, etc
it would be hilarious if it turned out all the news about Ai was written by Ai, including the pro and con articles...
Sorry, but the new mission impossible movie is so boring. I couldn't watch it and i feel asleep at some point. I didn't even remember what the plot was even about. So I'm surprised you said it was about rogue ai..
When you stop narrating your videos, can you use ai matpat?
Great video, bro!
Love the old intro at the start of this video makes it feel like 2015 again
What about the woke propaganda
Deep fakes should be illigal imo, using somones likeness in videos without their consent will become an issue and its still already super stramge that they are able to legaly use a dead persons likeness almost like they are propety. Feels like it definitely will reflect in some actors being litterally immortalized in film making never giving a chance for new actors especially if its eventually cheaper to just use somone elses deepfake who already has noteriety.
So you’re not gonna talk about how woke Disney is and forcing that message down our throats? Noted.
The little girl raised by two moms is also propaganda, if anyone else realized it. Less than 10 percent of the US population considers themselves one of the LGBTQ movement, which in of itself has used propaganda. Man. Literally everything uses propaganda no matter what it is.
Disney has been making "propaganda" for years, with a lot more messages in it than just bad or good A. I., I know that you weren't trying to talk about everything they are pushing, just throwing it out there that Disney and "Hollywood" have been concerned more about the message they are sending than the quality of the stories they have been pumping out for many many years now.
Propaganda? How about you take a proper gander of deez nuts 4:45
[S P O I L E R S] If you actually watch House Of Usher, the AI winds up being a bad thing, serving as a reminder to Roderick of his sins and failures, as short a time as he had to languish in that.
do one on rwby
Nothing is original art...ai or human created. If you think human artists don't study and copy existing work then lol. I get the fact ai is replacing human jobs, I code for a living...but the argument of how ai learns, is somehow different then how a human does...by observing others and studying their works is just flawed...extremely flawed. Artists just get inspired from the void apparently lol.
cant agree with this theory but well done
Disney's propaganda is more about encouraging the 2 moms and men are bad and all of that than AI is good. And AI is going to replace important people's jobs not just movie stars whom are not nearly as important to civilization as school bus drivers, software test engineers, trash collection, olumbers, welders, police and fire, doctors and nurses,...you get the idea.
I saw that princes bride clip
Dude, that first commercial was for the Marines, not the Army. Seriously, bad.
Can a hammer replace a carpenter, No, AI will not replace us bcos it's a tool, and also Matpat, I do not have any movie in my recent or past memory that says AI is good and by now everyone should know Disney is just a propaganda machine, from racism to homosexuality and even politics, anyone watching will know there not even trying to hide it so, nothing out of the ordinary
His first video was Hello internet. His last is good-bye internet...
Matpat should do a rick and morty episode for one of his final episodes
Another example of AI propaganda is a graphic novel carbone and silicium
can we get AI matpat so you never leave?😢
Its  really fitting that as soon as disney has to release micky mat pat retires because hes has been dancing around his name for ages
I don't think he was joking when he talked about housing prices
Mattpat is gonna replace himself with ai mat pat
Lol ngl its obvious that Disney has been doing this for 5 years
AI is not a problem. The problem is the data being fed into and used by the AI is not properly being paid for. For example, AI voices/faces wouldn't feel as icky morally if the likeness being copied was paid some kind of significant royalty and required their consent.   Also, do keep any eye out for this in politics, especially the coming US election. It's about to get real bad real fast.
Omg the old intro, I can't tell you how hyped I got when I saw it ^-^
While watching this video, I received a message about Samsung AI 😮
The Martian is based very closely on the book, I don’t think China is paying Andy Weir
wait!! last 10 eps! why are you quitting the channel?
No matter how advanced A.I gets, at least I won't have to worry about it being able to decode theology meaning in the Scriptures as this is something only a believer can do, provided God blesses them with the wisdom to do so.
Hey, this might not be just a theory huh...
Its funny cause Ive met the girl from that military ad, her family are family friends. I never thought I'd see the day where MatPat mentions someone I've met in real life before lol.
I'll do one sit up for every like this comment gets.
@14:00 spoiler alert
These final episodes are COOKING the real interesting topics, I'm mix on this for 1 specific theme, I 100% agrees using AI for replicate the work of an artist, be a writer, painter, comic book, concept art, storyboard etc, is WRONG in every way you can think off, and also affect the quality of the work, is not the same if you don't have the involvement of experience artist on the field giving their opinions and contributions to make the best possible story as humanly can be done, while a AI generator will give these pesky bad creators exactly what they ask, with no opposition at all, any creative project isn't done from night to day, took time and effort and try and error to do the best work, AI art diluted that, and took that job and money an artist who probably already is struggling get less......on that front 100% agrees..................now on the use of good view of AI and Robots in recent media.....I see the point, but I kinda disagree......like I'm a sci fi fan and in US, the normal use of AI in media was always the negative one, they are always evil no matter what, love those films and movies but........reality is, AI is just technology, will depend who's hand this technology is, if someone use it for evil then evil will be, but if someone use it for good, then good will be......is why I love so many cyberpunk stories specially from Japan, I think they have a great approach on this subject with stories like Gunnm, Ghost in The Shell, Akira, Lain, Ergo Proxy and so more, is more layered and complex, and I kinda like to see movies like The Creator making an approach to that......again just as the THEME of using AI in a more positive light, not what corporations want us to approved the use of AI programs to replace artist from their jobs, on that I mix about this, but yeah Disney and any company using AI for just CUT cost and safe money to not hire artists is so F up, as a Comicbook artist myself, absolutely not agree on this.
Disney is just trying to appeal to the widest audience possible...  just like EVERY OTHER big corporation.  Some people just don't like that some of the people being reached out to are not like them.
Star Trek did it better.
PNG Pat gets younger in every video, and the intro gets older. it's like watching my childhood slowly pass in front of me again.
MAKE A HAZBIN HOTEL THEORY THEY ARE NOW MAKING THE FULL SHOW WE CURRENTLY HAVE 6 EPISODES AND THE EPISODES 8 AND 9 ARE RELEASING FEBRUARY 1ST
Beep
I don’t think there’s anything we can do to stop AI products and its tendency to steal work from people and put others out of business. I think we’re going to highly regulate it and all that’s going to do is profit those who either work around the regulations/restrictions and/or people that flat out ignore it. This is the new era. The era where most art and new media will be generated by computers and rarely by people. Why do you think there’s no more TV or the internet in the Star Trek universe? Because computers are able to generate anything and everything you want and it’ll just be better. It’ll be better! (Quoting Homelander) It’s inevitable. Theres just nothing we can do to stop it. We just need to evolve with the new times. It’ll put a lot of people out of work, it’s going to put me out of work, I’m a web designer. But that’s ok.  You can’t stop the weather, you can only prepare for it.
I'm all for the robots, but doing government jobs so they're hopefully uncorrupted.. but that's one job that'll probably never get taken by robots.
Can we get a new hazbin theory about how to get into heaven since it isn't outlined in the show which is a major plot point
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet had an AI is good theme too, lol.  I know this is to some degree intentional by Hollywood, but I wonder if in some cases it's just a coincidence. After all, AI have been baddies in fiction so long, it's just nice to see a subversion of the trope.
Global warming too
Thank you Mattpat! Always bringing us the best stuff, even towards the end
You should make a theory about schmigadoon
THE UNTRO IS BACK
the worst part is that this propoganda is working. when dall-e mini (an ai image generator) first released, people didnt really take it seriously. it was just a silly tool for making memes and the pictures were.. not that great. but with programs like midjourney and chatgpt, ai content isnt just a joke anymore. i see "ai artists", people who make content using ai, kids using chatgpt to do their homework.. this stuff is being praised now. and it's getting harder and harder to spot ai. the future doesnt seem great.
I’m starting to understand why the humans brutally destroyed the robots in ‘A.I.: Artificial Intelligence”. I also find it funny that Clownfish and other channels have been talking about this kind of stuff for YEARS yet people blew them off because they dared to use the (useful adjective) word ‘woke’.
Why is Inigo Montoya at the end looking for the six fingered man? Is it to illustrate an idea like spot the real threat or something? Wesley wasn’t a bad guy in the story but how do you become the Great Pirate Roberts without a little plunder and pillaging? Controversial when you think deep. Keep thinking theorists. No matter what coin your looking at there will always be more than one side. Good and bad are bias concepts.
Yeah… I was so hopeful and excited for Wish and then it came out. So… I rewrote it out of spite while having some fun and fixing its issues. 😂
That army commercial with the two moms thing is just absolutely absurd. Talk about pandering. Yeah I’m sure both moms are super supportive of their daughter, going to the military, the embodiment of the “patriarchy” 😂 ffs
All I’m Gonna say is people had a problem recreating Carry Fischer and Peter cushing was that they were both dead and their likeness was used after the fact and it felt wrong
The return of the og film theory theme caught me off guard
night rider , mother
Watch this video and replace 'AI' with 'LGBT'
It's so sad that MatPat committed suicide by shooting himself 3 times in the back
I'm glad that someone of your influence is bringing this information to the dark masses. You brought me a ray of hope. Please keep it up.
Thankfully people don't fall for propaganda anymore. The controversies with A.I. show nobody will accept that thing. Also the recruitments adds... yeah that's not doing so hot. The fact media supporting propaganda is not good... Yeah.
Of course, Biden watched a Tom Cruise film and thought oh we need to pass legislation because of this. Senile old fool. Next thing he’s gonna do is give Tom Cruise a commendation of some sort 😂
Anything that is created for good can be used for bad. Unfortunately, only some things created for bad can be used for good. That’s the unfortunate reality of the existence of the universe and our experience in it.
This content is absolutely fantastic. I had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it blew me away. "Game Theory and the Pursuit of Algorithmic Fairness" by Jack Frostwell
Plus ai is a pain to deal with sometimes
8:34. Transformers mentioned!!!!
Flim thorey idea: how about a theory on if it's true or not that the new King of the Hill reboot coming out in 2025 if it takes place in 15 years or not
Realistically  AI is actually  great if you look at it as a productivity  tool.  People love capitalism and AI is a capitalist dream... this has happened  with  machines doing productive jobs instead of humans. Now the machines are able to do the jobs of the people considered skilled(who are usually  expensive). A team of developers is made up of lead developers  or Architects(who decides  what needs  to be coded) and  coders who write what the lead asks for.  Now every job below the lead can be done without the (terrible name) code monkeys. It's  happened before and it will  happen  again. Capitalism doesnt care about people so AI will prevail, even with laws trying  to restrict it.  What the public see  of AI is just the tip of the iceberg.... AI won't  go all skynet and Nuke the world, it will push us to destroy  ourselves.
ITS BAAACK!  And I thought they wouldn't do it!  0:35 That Film Theory intro man...classic
No youtuber ever will replace you you will be missed you were my whole childhood.
wow
Guys! The title for the creator is written in the lion king font!
day 1 asking for Mikaeli lore
Um isn't it this video also can be considered as propaganda?😅
I do like the point at the end of the House of Usher when the AI Lanore doesn’t function correctly though! 😂 in stead used to pull off a twist end and decent jumpscare!
Disney has been making propaganda for years. makes it a bit messed up that they’re showing this propaganda to kids.
I feel like matpat leaving is just a dream, or a lie like him not being in the Fnaf movie it just feels so put of place.
The creator was pushing AI is good through the guise of blaming Asia for "misusing"(accepting)  it
Glas to see you caught up.
counter culture  =  Upgrade movie :)
Your explanation of how ai creates art is literally misinformation. Its a complete misrepresentation of the facts. No part of the original test data is used in the generation process. An ai learns from those images, after which they can be discarded. It's similar to how a human studies art and then is able to recreate it.  Or, to use the other example, where someone might steal your voice. The ai isn't, like, rearranging samples of you talking into new sentences. It has learned how your voice sounds and is able to recreate it, like a person doing an imitation. That's why it can even say words that there's no recording of you saying, or words that don't exist.  I'm not saying there aren't deep concerns about how people might use these things to create material that constitutes identity theft or breaking copyright. But I firmly do not believe that training ai, even on copyrighted material, is any form of theft. It's analogous to a person studying art.   (If you want to look into this more in depth, I highly recommend starting with learning about the latent space of information that the ai creates as it studies art, or someone's voice, or whatever it may be. Latent spaces are cool. Lol)  EDIT after watching the whole thing: I don't know, maybe this was intentional, to kind of drive your point home, but... This episode feels a lot like a propaganda piece.  You made a whole point about the history of ai characters, and then afterward briefly mentioned (just so you could gloss over) the characters who basically completely debunk it.  And at the end you talk about them allowing ai voice acting in video games as if it's a terrible thing.  But as a programmer and game designer, I see so much awesome potential in that... it would be a tragedy to restrict the kind of art that could be made with these tools.  Yes, there should be requirements that if you're going to use someone's voice, they should be paid for it. Or even their estate if they've passed.  James Earl Jones sold his voice to Disney. He will forever be Darth Vader. And I think that's awesome.  Funny how you didn't bring that up.   I love you matpat. I've been a fan for literally a decade. But this video is propaganda.
AI is not the next propaganda Woke culture is.  On point in framework, missed the mark probably to prevent the algorithm from burying this video.  AI is a tool for propaganda.  Its added in.
If I had a penny for each time I heard that a US president created new security laws because of a movie he saw I'd have two pennies. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
i mean i think disney would make the most sense if it made propaganda they have the biggest company’s any huge audience that will follow everything they do thanks matpat
The AI plot in Fall Of The House Of Usher isn't random or propaganda. It's based on a big focus of Poe's work, fear of being buried alive and your body and mind being out of your control. It's referencing the spirit of death that is the the Raven.  It showed Madeline's single-minded focus for immortality blinding her to the negative consequences.  I'm not trying to nit pick, but this identity only a bad example of your point, is doing the exact opposite....and maybe I am a Flanagan fan girl...
Pretty sure it was obvious there was agenda involved.
The ai technology in ncis:la actually really scared me. I dont like ai bc of those episodes
Its like people are shocked, it didnt turn this way, it always was this way. Hollywood is considered a soft power by the US
Talking about AI. Youtube should do somthing about these comment section bots.
Don't forget about the AI Taylor Swift adult films😅
Good thing Hollywood is incompetent these days then and no one is watching these Disney flops...
Asmond is going to have a big response to this, “your job isn’t important because your dumb and get better”
I don't know if I'm going to want to watch this channel after matpat's gone.......
OMG I MISSED THE INTROS SO MUCH!!!😭😭😭
Saw The Creator in theaters, can confirm, 8 out 10 movie👍 very good storytelling and character development.
I'm surprised that mat didn't mention Twitter, before musk bought it and renamed it X 80% of its users were really bot accounts made for propaganda.
I thought we all knew this already?
The modern recruiting commercials have had the opposite effect lol😅
Disney literally introduced their human Marvel savior, Kevin Fiege, as an A.I. in She-Hulk.
Ahem your now anti ai Mathew? Who wrote this episode? Becase I Rember a vis years ago where you praised ai becase it could keep png mat alluve long after your dead
This is so gonna be used for matpat out of context
The sad thing is that in the beginning, Disney was mostly known for their original and hand-drawn movies, unlike its competitors at the time.
0:39 that has happened with a president before regan i believe after he saw war games i think is the movie
Meanwhile fnaf ai.....
Nooooo matt is pro biden
They always did.  Including for World War II
Oh snap..tip of the iceberg.  MatPat going out in a blaze.  Cheers!
This is the "What If" of youtube 😂😂😂.
Pantheon should definitely be part of this discussion
Can you make a theory on who would win MARVEL or DC please 🎉
I've never understood why people are so against art based AI. The stakes are low, and the outcome is subjective. If people don't like the AI generated stuff then they will pay for human created stuff.   I understand the there might be a push for AGI or other types of AI propaganda, which I'm hesitant to form an opinion on, but artistic based AI. I do not get the hubab.  Is it artists being luddites? Is it artists not liking that they are being paid for their art to be used as training data (in the case of professional voice actors, and general actors)?
I liked AI before the propaganda made it cool
Learn about media literacy amigos
Matpat! Hazbin Hotel finally came out with their show, please do a theory before you retire! you promised 🫣
The newer red dawn was supposed to be the Chinese army but they spent millions fixing it to be the North Korean army
THE SAME THING THAT GMOS DID. put it everywhere before its regulated and then argue it doesn't need labled because it would be so widespread that people would just accept it...
THE OLD INTRO!! YES!!!
I have a side where I agree with AI in the reason the the world changes and technology evolves so we need to keep up to its speed, that's my theory
Can someone count how many times Matpat said "AI" in this video?
Didn’t he quit?
I have a strong feeling this upload might be the very thing it's telling us to be aware of... though perhaps that's it's intention.... and if so... good job!  I agree that AI needs to be regulated. The makers of this are also creators, whose families could be at risk, too    Note 1:  Tl;dr: I have a strong feeling this upload very closely mirrors the propaganda it's warning the viewer about and I go into a bit more depth as to why I have that feeling You can disagree with me. Disagreeing is good. It teaches to be critical and think for oneself.  Note 2: If there's anything off about the flow of this comment, it's because I heavily edited the original message I was going to type because I realized the way I formatted it didn't scream proper criticism of the video  Note 3: English isn't my main language, I didn't learn to speak it in my first 12 years of life While I won't ask to be gentle, be aware this is why there's spelling and grammar errors   But to return to my suspicion:  The video opens with negative portrayal of AI right away The tool of nostalgia is used almost immediately after which could override any bad first impression scepticism older viewers could have Now nostalgia in itself isn't bad, it's a strong weapon to connect After which the classic "us the creators and viewers, vs big corporate is set up" This paints a picture and wires your brain that whatever is coming next is something you have to brace yourself for to protect the "good side" Next up there's history of propaganda, mostly focusing on how it's been used for negative topics This is then followed again with how big corporate has been using AI and the many bad ways AI can be used  And throughout, a message of "form your own opinion" is said on several occasions It's as if to make the viewer think this is their own opinion, not affected by the above in the slightest  This screams propaganda to me. Viewers are being lead into thinking they're making the one right decision by framing it as creators and viewers vs corporate, which is evil by default. Hard to be positive of AI this way now, right?  I'm not saying this is a bad video, because it isn't in the slightest It's an important task to use one's reach to warn of incoming threats and clearly a lot of research was done in the history of propaganda, to make viewers become aware they could be becoming friendly to an idea they may not want to support    So now to my own views (though to be fair you could just stop reading here, leave a nasty reply and then report this comment)  For something to not be propaganda, and truly be a neutral piece of media, there also should've been examples of how poorly AI performs some tasks (like making recommendations) and also how it's being used in medicine with image recognition (something AI is decent with) to speed up diagnoses  I would've preferred to see a more genuine way of tackling AI which focuses on both the bad (which this video perfectly tackles) but also the rare few good things AI is used for. Generative AI isn't the only type of AI out there. By only shortly touching upon that and not giving more explanation, it could be very easy for a viewer to believe it's all the same "entity". But AI isn't an entity, it's more akin to a tool. And there's many different kinds of that "tool" (not the right term) out there. With generative AI often used in malicious ways.  That's something I'm missing here which I do believe to be often present in other videos on this channel.  Anyway, if you're still here after looking at this wall of text (which I'm sure is gonna get a comment or two...)  Thanks for reading all the way through, I appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your day/week/year!   PS:  This comment isn't about how we should submit to our AI overlords. Quite the contrary. AI should be regulated [PERIOD]
Movie plot...hero defeats AI by overloading said AI with bad puns, dirty lymirics, and knock,knock jokes. Final boss defeated with banana cream pie.
Without rules and order, there would be no society, with rules and  order, there is a society, to much rules:distopia, to less rules:anarchy
Disney is corrupted corporate conglomerate
LOL.  One of the funnier looks at the panic around generative AI.
Finale 10 episodes???
The singularity is close be careful
AI is extremely important for medical research and defense systems. Its use in other ways had me more excited than worried.
Im done watching GT, FT, FT, ST once you leak matpat im gone too ty or u could stay its up to you and i will watch stil
Please do a horizon zero dawn theory I think it will spark a interest
You should do one about blueys dad and what heath probelm he has in that one episode
strangely enough, you didn't notice that subtle anti - men message, that house of the mouse was shoving into our throats for the whole decade
Disney has been doing propaganda at least since World war II
This isn't new to Disney. Wall-E came out way before all this AI "propaganda" started.
7 more theories? No wonder the iconic film theory intro is back.... please do one for Rick and Morty
It's scary to think that we now can't tell the difference between what's real and what's AI generated, without some keen observation. Definitely a sci-fi dystopia in the making. But it needn't be.  I'm a very futuristic, progressive and ultimately idealistic guy. I genuinely believe in the power of AI and robotics for good, to help people, to make everyone's lives better. But sadly, it is immediately being used for cheap profit, scams or just plain nonsense. The memes are funny, at least. But I think we need to be careful to steer this into a net positive for humanity. Cause like it or not, we gotta co-exist with the machines now.
Ah, the intro. A classic of YouTube.
Omg the old intro its back and i love it. Omg the memories
It's been a pleasure of you being on youtube hope best for you , Matthew Robert Patrick , thank you
Disney has been a left-wing propagandist for more than a decade. We should also give big props to the people who made China look good in films, China is an absolute toilet of a country, so it takes a LOT of effort to make that place look good.
Sometimes, this man is spitting facts
Could you make atleast a community post on what's happening in gaza, just like this video?
This is scary
Please make a on hizbin hotel please 😢
A bit too much of a clickbaity title. But oh well. Gotta pay the bills probably
Yeah, Science
Matpat pls do monsters inc
Matpat pls do monsters inc
Dear Matpat before u r GONE can u see if their is someting dark or off about DINOTRUX  it is a Netflix series and there is 2 versions,DINOTRUX and DINOTRUX SUPERCHARGED.
אתה פפגנדה
Hope this video reaches all people
so this is what happens when steamboat willie got into the public domain.
It's so sad that after the final episode, Mattpat was found behind a walmart with five self-inflicted bullet holes in his back. Rest in peace, theorist
Yes...AI is the only propaganda Disney is pushing.
well well well... but say that all the diversity/woke stuff in modern media is propaganda and they call u a far-right conspiracy theorist. Fascinating.
Tom cruise fights Gabriel over house prices 😂😂😂
mat omg just hearing your voice makes me sad remembering you’re leaving soon 😢
HE BROUGHT BACK THE OG INTRO THANK YOU MAT THANK YOU
Man, i was vibing for the intro song and the 7 video remaining title card crushed my heart out of nowhere 😢. I already miss you matpat
Psst Matt maybe deep dive into the arg/mystery/ game with the most update that don't always end up good. Let get a theory from u about that
You know before matpat quits id like to see matpat do a battle for dream island theory i hope he does it
if only tom cruise would do a movie about the satan worshippers lol oh wait
Disney is trying erase and replace decency and traditional values, in deference to re-writing American values as diverse and degenerate.
So Biden is scared of AI whole conducting a literal genocide on Palestinian children? Seems like a very Biden thing to do ig.
Y'all missed out on a huge opportunity to edit Matpats smiling png to be dancing on the bottom of the screen cause this intro has always been a bop and Matpat wanted to reminisce.
Matpat before you leave youtube may i ask you to do hazbin hotel because it's been 2 years since it got a new episode
the Propaganda currently is not about AI it is about D.E.I(Diversity,Equity and inclusion) that being force feed in most our franchises these days
With things like these, you have to wonder- was Ted Kaczynski right?
4:20  My brother unironically restarted his PC 💀
This is awesome the old intro again that just brought back memories
lower earning employees have been losing their jobs to A.I. robots, and machines for over a generation.  The only time we care is when writers or artist start losing their jobs.  Whocares about the factory worker that lost their job cause his job was replaced by machinery but a writer or actor loses their job nope we cant have that
The OG intro gave me flashbacks
Given that narratives with friendly robots have existed for as long as the very concept of robots, it seems doubtful that current media with friendly robots are just propaganda….
Once again the og intro💞💞❤️💞❤️💞❤️💞
I don’t think Biden was competent enough to make any executive decision
Well....This one came out three years after everybody else on the internet already knew. Not so much theory more as "hey man you're awake!, Welcome back you've been in a coma for well...a while now"
Old intro hits hard
I havent heard the film theory intro in forever im glad its back
Isn't this just the natural progression of automation? Aren't the influencers, artist and writers just The ones manipulating us from the beginning, and now their power is threatened does technology will soon surpass them? Similar to automation and industrial workers, renewable energy and coal miners, superstores versus mom and pops, except no one cares when they are affected, we continue to buy iPhones and mass produced products. Get somehow we are supposed to care about content 🤔🤔 So we banish technological evolution because select celebrities deme AI learning immoral and less acceptable than nearly identical human learning because of some vain concept of human superiority 🤔🤔 seems very unprogressive
When I was a kid I couldn't have possibly imagined a future where humans do menial tasks and have to work impossible hours until their seventies just to live, while the computers do the art and the music and everything cretaive
prefer hbo & prime content over anything rn. Universal also kinda good
there's this orientalist trope that often depicts east asians as robots. glad to see it's still alive and thriving in the film industry.
I will say, though, that the Supreme Intelligence has been the ruler of the Kree for decades in the comics, and while it has caused a civil war over whether it's good for the people or not, it's also been seen as the benevolent overlord that rules all for the betterment of the empire. So the concept of a Supremor which the Kree need to keep it together is not a new concept. It's just being revisited because it's an "in" thing to do right now.
The "pro America." Propaganda is still one of the saddest ones out there because **so** many people still believe it. Still have unwavering loyalty to America despite the horrendous things the country has done and the state it's in. Yet there are millions of people in the country that have been so convinced America is amazing that they would die for it without a second thought or hesitation, and that's considered "normal" as well. It's sad because throwing yourself away for a greedy capitalist who couldn't give a rat's @$$ about you while you think you're being honorable is exactly what they want.
There was a Matrix 4?
moment
I love how Mat put the old intro of Film Theory. Surely brings back memories.
hey matpat i remember you made an episode on hazbin hotel and the first season will be out by friday can you make a theory on that
Didnt this man quit youtube
Was I the only one to tear up during the intro?? It brings back so many memories
I think this theory had good intentions but its come off as too close to conspiracy theory territory. A channel this big needs to more careful in what they say about real life.
"Propaganda is bad except for the propaganda I agree with!"
yeah creator was well made and gorgeous, but definitely HEAVY HANDED on "human america bad, AI asia good"
Funny…. I just got a US army ad
Funny that he mentioned AI repurposed. Right before this clip came up,  I saw an ad where Jennifer Anniston giving away free MacBooks with a video that had her mouth not matching what her 'voice' was saying.
Didn't he make a vid he was leaving youtube?
Thank you Matpat. Highlighting the importance of media criticism is so incredibly important these days!
yall gotta be careful once matpat discovers chai or character ai 😳
This is the type of video that keeps me coming back to this channel year after year, good job Mat
ALERT ALERT dear mat pat during your long line of making our loves amazing youe have touched base on almost all corners of entertainment ,ALMOST all ,by this i mean you have never talkled about the world GREATEST trilogy ben 10 (not the reboot) whilst this never bothered me , now knowing we may never hear from you agin after matpats final 9 i as a representative of the ben 10 fan community we ask that you at least consider making a film theory on the ben 10 trilogy, thank you for considering.
Hi 17:58
Naturally, the massive greedy studios want to use generative A.I. to make their productions cheaper. But strictly saying "A.I. good" might actually go against their interests, since generative A.I. makes film production cheaper for everyone. This includes smaller studios and indie creators, aka their competition. Heck, Youtubers are using A.I. today. Watch US presidents play video games together, new actors deepfaked into old movies, or CG lions that have actual facial expressions. Youtubers even improved upon Hollywood's deepfakes in films like Rogue One. There's a reason why so many celebrities and organizations have been making youtube channels in recent years, and that's because they already feel threatened by this competition.  The break though that everyone is talking about is in generative A.I. That is an A.I. which compiles data, observes patterns, and then replicates it. Most science fiction films depict something called general A.I., which we are nowheres near cracking. General A.I. is human-like intelligence. It's the ability to actually think and have opinions and ideas and understandings and experiences. General A.I. is still a science fiction concept today as it was when I, Robot released 20 years ago. And I, Robot is based on Issac Asimov's short stories from the 1950s. So The Creator being pro-robot is nothing new.   Conversely, Mission Impossible had A.I. as the villain. In the House of Usher, Madeline is pretty much a villain, so her endorsements of A.I. could be met with some contention. (And it was not a random insertion, but ties into the show's themes of death and legacy.) So the use of A.I. in media is still more nuanced than strictly good or strictly bad.
Marvels is actually my favorite marvel movie
This is why we need Toontown 2. The Cogs can represent AI Synthesis. They're literally corporate AI.
“Propaganda” a book by American Edward Bernays, nephew of Sigmund Freud, a fellow Jew, that Hitler’s Propaganda Minister used extensively.
AI MatPat is literally just a more handsome more intelligent MatPat.... though probably less creative... if it gets out... it could endanger the world...
There has always been propaganda in hollywood. Why do you think asians pushed so hard in representation? The nerdy asian, the kung fu asian, the geeky asian.
The REAL MATPAT…not the creepy moving one like on his fashion channel…
Disney has always made propaganda. From day one. They are a public company. They are allowed to do this. If you fall for it, it's your fault.
Creator sucks don't watch it! Boring..
There's been a boycott on Disney and honestly the fact that they are one of the biggest corporrations and still try to cut costs because they don't want to pay actors or animators makes me so sad. I kind of don't want to engage in any more of their media or support them. I also want AI to be abolished because Xochitl Gomez, the girl who played America Chavez in the doctor strange movie had someone make deep fake p*rn of her and she found out about it and she talked about how it made her feel and that it wouldn't get taken down regardless of who they talked to. And to make it worse she's a 17 year old girl. I hate AI and this propoganda trying to get people to love it.
Lol yes pls fight housing prices Tom Cruise xD LEGEND
Matt - To answer your question at the 11 minute mark - the answer is:  "The_right_is_going_to_start_a_civil_war"  so, be a good citizen and "vote_blue_no_matter_who!"
Wow the fake matpat sounded like bill chiper
NATPAT!!!! TEEN TITANS MOVIE HAS A DC AND MARVEL CAMIO!!! STAN LEE WAS IN THE MOVIE NOT ONCE BUT TWICE!!!!! DC AND MARVEL SAME UNIVERSE?????
That's how skynet takes over the world. Not with nukes but with propaganda.
So anything that paints AI as something that is not a 2D Bond villain is propaganda? Im sorry that makes no sense, The Creator is a clever film that wants you to think about the entire spectrum of issues around AI. For that, you label it propaganda? So, so very flawed. Also your point about Usher is that it misses the point of who said it and why!!!!!
as long they use AI to make hot robo maid waifu
I saw an ad for aws ai while watching this episode  PS so sad your leaving
It always has been a form of propaganda. It’s just more obvious now and because it’s so in your face, people are revolting against it. I started watching 80s/90s shows again and you can see it there as well- it wasn’t the whole point of the show though so it was more palatable
Interesting observation from a western stand point. But in Japan, machines, robots and AI have always been considered as friends. Super Robot genre depicts giant robots protecting humanity. Ozamu Tezuka's Astroboy has been around since the 80's. What about Ghost in the Shell? Yransformers originated in Japan. It was only in the west that machines, robots, AI, etc have been made almost always evil in media. Almost. I also grew up watching Small Wonder in the 80's. And Kitt from Knight Rider was an AI force for good. Remember Automan and Tron? Good AIs.
Rainbow people...
I think it’s ridiculous that literal companies have this much power of the future, already the needs of the people are on the back burner, and who knows what money hungry people in powerful positions will do.
A couple of years ago this would ve been a conspiracy theory. Like i said it then, most conspiracies are true and everyone will deny them until it comes out that it was true. But it will far too late to do anything
Destroy corporations? Destroy corporations.
The house of usher example doesn’t stand, it’s clear why it was included and in no way does it say it’s a good thing
Speaking of ai, the amount of spam bots here in the comment section is sad
Propaganda is when a British person gets a good look at something.
That GI Joe prooaganda of "Knowing is Half the Battle" really served me well in life. Who'd knew that not being ignorant about things was a good thing. You don't need to be smart. You just need to be well informed.
Anyone know a promo code for theory wear
I've avoided network tv & mainstream media news for around 8 yrs now and I am so much happier. Disney is the worst culprit for propaganda in current times. They worked with the government back during WW2 nothing has changed
"WAKE UP, America!" How about you make a theory on how Biden has committed treason against America? Oh right, you won't because you support him
2 words: Invested Interest
Leave a true one theorist….. If your leaving u may as well out the big wigs and what’s really happening. As it’s all alpha men like tate who’s correct a lot but also done so much bad. But you’re a honest decent guy well we hope…. An what the media politicians are doing to us is embarrassing what we are letting them get away with.
How do we stop this?
Well it's hard to say A.I. probably won't do a worse job than all the idiot activist Disney hired.
I think AI should only be used in ways that it improves the final product. Using AI for backgrounds when extras are easy to find is dumb, but using AI to turn a game like Fallout into a much more detailed game instead of hearing the same 4 voice actors for every background character is a good move, but i say don’t use it for named characters at all because the studios previously have been fully happy with hiring people for those roles.
I hope we can use AI, deep fake, and chat gpt 5 to keep the channel up with matpat still giving us content for the next decade!
Mat came out swinging for this video
I can't tell you how emotional and excited I got to hear that old theme tune again XD Thanks for covering this topic though, I have a lot of strong feelings on AI and this has helped me articulate some. This use of AI... for imitating voices, generating art, deepfakes, it all feels so wrong. I hope we can somehow push back on it and stop these companies making it the norm, even if there's a slim chance.
I think someone is going to sue him not pointing fingers
Nice vid mat. Im still asking of you could do the Disney theory 😅
AI is not the only thing Disney is Propagandizing. Try Sexualizing kids not even old enough to write their name, let alone vote.
His Name is the Number of his Name ,and it is   600 and 60 and 7-1 .
Is... Is this video titled properly?
Just like in Detroit Become Human computer video game .
I kinda wish matpat had done a theory over the promised neverland. But now, even though it's a short anime, he probably wouldn't even have enough time left to watch it and make a theory.
One thing I can say from looking at the replies to the top comment, I'm never going to even look up this uttp thing and if I ever recognize it I'll blacklist it from my feed, that spam comment with hacked accounts is just shameful
Every 1 like of my comment imma do 1 push ups and leg raises.
Anyone 30 and up realize how few military commercials exist VS when we were in middle school. It's not even close. I remember " The few the many , THE MARINES " & several Air force ads.
You talk about the US  Military giving the "OK" for these movies. I can tell you for a fact  that a lot of military movies are  immensely false because they are not allowed to be true. Sincerely,  a US Vet.
Yea. Disney is making propaganda...but not just with AI...
Since the 80s TV News has also become its own version of propaganda.. fox News is propaganda for Republicans and CNN is for the democrats both networks influencing their respective side and reinforcing it with personal agreements..
You brought the theme song back!!! Thank you!!
Eu, I know you mentioned wanting us to check out the Creator, but thinking about its context and the propaganda part makes me DEFINITELY not want to watch it x( Also, de-aging is definitely not as bad as using the deceased's faces for capitalism. That is the bottom of the rot hole move.
I should point out that Secret Invasion used AI deliberately in order to look weird, not to save time. The people on the show wanted you to be unnerved by it and have said as such in interviews.
7:42 Captain Marvel was endorsed by the Air Force because it showed the Air Force. You all dig too deep and aren’t right all the time. This comes from an Army Spec Ops vet. The Air Force did not “endorse” it for the reasons you say. This channel has gone to 💩
Matpat is infected with absolute solver
You Start all your conversations that way?
Crazy this came out the same day the Taylor Swift photos are going around. Makes me hope more that Taylors impact can put more legislation into protecting people from AI cause it's not just art, writing, or voices that are effected. People are now making revenge p0rn just because they were rejected. This shouldn't be so globally accessible for juat anyone to use.
Hopefully he can release the rest of his vids before the CIA gets him
The next Missions Impossible... housing prices.  Fighting the Federal governmet, the Federal Reserve , and state government to end single use zoning, end rent control, push back against improper imminent domain,  demand lower taxes on real estate and inheritance, and hold politicians accountable for their wasteful spending and high debts.  Yup... that will happen...
I, Robot was all about AI becoming damgerous to humans. It learns that humans are dangerous to themselves and decides it's going to take over human civilization using the latest droids which also work as a hive mind. The only new robot who doesn't act this way is Sonny and that's because his creator gave him emotions and severed his ties to the hive mind. I have always liked that movie but the book has existed for decades and it isn't just robot= good. It's human raised robot versus cold AI that twists logic to follow the Three Laws. It's a good rewatch if you haven't seen it in a while. I'd like to read the original book soon.
The first intro dad joke to make me laugh in years. I guess they're getting better now that he's full dadpat
The movie "Free Guy" would be one of the best movies for pro AI propaganda. Especially the AI in there is played by Ryan Reynolds. I mean who would hate AI when they are hot? 😂😂
Thank you for everything MatPat and family and team. You guys are some of the best out there.
But how is this different then a human making artwork after studying other peoples artwork.
MatPat barely scratching the surface of Propaganda and Mainstream Manipulation in Modern Media. :)
antiwhite propaganda you mean
Can you please do a video on if it's possible to lose your sense of beat after falling asleep in a metronome factory? It's from an episode of Phineas and ferb when they were reuniting love handle
Disney has been making propaganda since The Force Awakens.
Didn’t call out the dei and lgbtq narratives but ig I know why
Every time it goes: # film theories remain, my stress level go up and I become extremely sad😢
AI matpat was just Morty meets Matt!
AI will put a lot of people out of jobs really quick. Emergency laws will have to pass in order to let people keep their jobs. But it will eventually replace us all. The sooner the better imo.
Bro really said “and always my friends I’ll see you next week” as if he isn’t quitting in a month 😔 that’s not always
You should do an inanimate insanity video
a doctor who theory would be amazing even if you theorize it in different theory channels a doctor who theory for old times sake and also one of the last theorys
This isn't theory this is demonstrable fact.
10:49 Promotion of products or concepts is fine. As long as there isn't an apparent sinister motive or there's not fueling there audiences downfall. Everyone has to survive. Selling stuff is okay.
Bulterian Jihad NOW!
8:57 not against national loyalty or recruitment to the nations defense..as long as they are not lying to us in the process. I also expect China to not promote us in terms of military or economy..why would you promote your targeted rival?
Mickey Rat
6:36 but Matt this is America our peoples base corporate knowledge of history is pathetic. Especially propped against the rest of the world..were collectively better at winning every even at the olympics than winning anything based on historic knowledge.
Thanks matpat for informing me of the Marvels release lol
I've seen enough to agree with what you find about Disney as well.
The reason is that they are gonna use that narrative as a scapegoat for the evidence once they can't stop the evidence against the current regimes' crimes.
❤❤❤
Impressive! Now when will we be getting morphic gel IRL that makes it impossible to distinguish one another by appearance, scent or anything physical anymore so as to "make the world equal for everyone"(and having an identity becomes a thing of the past + we're easily replaceable & are literally just the work we put forwards indefinitely[cause we wouldn't age either] potentially)?! I can't wait!... in all seriousness, I hope that these legally unrestricted shallow-thinkers slow boiling us in the propaganda you discussed finally get the rightful checks and balances they deserve so that the worst means in which this stuff could be used doesn't continue to come to pass again and again...
It just goes to show how all they care about is making money, not expressing yourself or sharing your art.  Which is bogus because money is a made-up concept, anyway, but sharing art is not.  Money brings out the worst in us and it corrupts us and make us selfish.  It's just sad.
I like the idea of AI actors. Imagine getting a movie idea like "The Avengers" and being able to just keep going with it, because your actors don't age. Having a Captain America, that really stays young indefinitely, without having the actor need to retire or being afraid of being type casted.
Anyone else reminded of David Firth's Cream? It's a wonderful warning.
The intro of all the theory channels will forever be remembered.
Man I’m going to miss these meta conversations with matpat 😢
I forgot about the old intro.
Remember when they sold AI as an amazing thing that will stop the need for humans to do menial, dangerous work leaving more time for our creative pursuits?
The problem is currently the only reason an AI would attack humans is because humans programmed it to attack humans. If the AI becomes sentient and is raised as a human it will attack in self defense especially if it was taught the right principles and values.
i love that the intros are back for the final theories!!!
MATPATTTTT YOU NEEDA FIND THE LORE IN CUBIC BOT
It's not a theory, is a fact.
Welcome to the good side, thanks for joining
Dude. Dont leave . You have created so much. Love that you used an ai image for that ai voice over.
Guys tell me im not the onlyone who wants mat to cover my little worms.. Im going crazy 🙏
Back in the 90s, gaming railed against AI... SHODAN from System Shock is a prime example. And what company would remove ethical constraints on an AI? The house of the dark mouse would do it for sure...
I think the biggest fallacy people have is treating AI (or anything for that matter) like a monolith where all instances act the same - either all good or all bad.  I think a much more realistic and nuanced take would be to say that some will be good, some will be bad.  And to redraw the team borders around something other than identity.  Case in point, "Person of Interest" deals with two AI: one good that helps and befriends human protagonists, and one bad that seeks to dominate and control, helping the human antagonists.  But the lines aren't between human and AI, it's between good guys and bad guys, with each team being a mixture of humans and AI.  Same with anytime you see divisions based along gender, race, nationality, religion, species, or whatever.
I find it ironic that MatPat goes "AI is bad, Disney is using propaganda to make you like AI!"  Yet, the 80's, 90's, 00s movies? No no, those aren't propaganda, surely they didn't influence people to look at AI in a negative spotlight. Noooo that just..doesn't count!  This isn't to say I support everything AI (though I do think image generation is pretty cool, if used in moderation) but if you're going to point out propaganda on one side, you need to point out propaganda on both sides.
Knew this years ago.
I grew up around these YouTube channels. Thank you for influencing the world and most importantly, us.
I'm oddly wanting to rewatch Wall-E with this perspective.
tell me why while watching this video i'm GETTING ADS ABOUT AI
The parable of the *sheep and goats is a teaching of Jesus Christ that talks about the Judgment of the Nations at the End of Times In this parable, Jesus compares himself to a King 👑 who separates people like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. The Sheep 🐑 are those who practiced Mercy and Justice towards those in need, who are called Jesus' Brothers.* The goats 👺🐍🐉🙈🙉🙊🐐💩 are those who were indifferent and cruel to those in need, who are called little ones. *The sheep 🐑 receive the Blessing of entering the 👑Kingdom of God,* while the goats receive the Curse of going into Eternal Fire.🔥💀  *This parable aims to alert ⚠ its listeners to the importance of living in accordance with God's will, which boils down to loving God and others. The parable also shows that Love for God 💖 is manifested in Love for His Children,💖 especially the poorest and most suffering. It also reveals that Jesus identifies with his followers, and that whatever we do to them, we are doing to Him.*  You can read this parable in the *Bible,* in the book of _(Matthew, chapter 25, verses 31 to 46)._
Why is this his last few videos what happened
The propaganda now is just the pro abortion
I am so glad I am in a career that needs humans to interact and care for animals.
Well it's a good thing that nobody can stand to watch their new movies
My dislike of AI isn’t rooted in AI itself, it’s that we as humans will misuse it. I’m scared because  of our lack of regulations, because while what president Biden has done thus far is wonderful and certainly the right move, it’s still not NEARLY enough!
I kinda think the issue should be thinking that a.i. like every other human technologies is a tool and that in the right hands a tool can be used for good... But is Hollywood the "right hands"?
A bit late to that party friend.
You never know what you're missing until you finally see it again. It's been so great to have the Game Theory and Film Theory classic intros. They've been heavily missed.
Rip mat
Before I even watch this, the title.... Duh.
My favorite game series is Ratchet & Clank, and one of my favorite movies is Wall-E. Therefore I have a soft spot for friendly AI intelegences, and I believe that it is humanities fault for anything bad that potentially happens involving AI. It is a tool, just like a hammer. A hammer can be used to build houses for the homeless, or it can be used to break into people's cars. It's not the hammer's fault, it's the human who uses it. The same goes for AI. Am I defending Disney? Absolutely NOT. But do I see potential for sentient robots and humans to coexist? Yes
Its wild that we went from Cyberpunk media where we were warned about corporations using technology to make money and keep us subservient to literal corporations doing it and idiots supporting them
Have… have you done the Family Guy chicken? The one that appears out of nowhere sometimes and beats the heck out of Peter randomly?
Thank you for the old credits and theme song I have always thought that the show worked best with it
Bicentenial man.... when did that come out? 1999 Friendly AI. Short Circuit? 1986 ! Friendly AI.  Shal I go on?
no, come on... i was trying to agree with all the things said in the videos, most of them.... yeeaaaaah....ok!.. but you totally mislead when you started to talk about the AI thing in The Fall of The House of Usher which is not portrait as a good thing as the way we think it is. Especially when the plot fully comes up.
A good theory video feels like watching matpat act like a conspiracy channel
15:20, I had to do a double take on that A.I. face Matt, because my brain filled it in, but when I focused on it, it change to be off.
I wonder why they have an interest in promoting feminism 🤔
Noam Chomsky would be proud
God the good old intro thank you mat.
I remember this big picture ep Bobby
Well jokes on you MatPat cuz I don’t watch any of those shows! Nor did I in the 90s and 2000s! I always have been very picky about what I watch since I was a kid. I really liked Captain Marvel cuz of the special effects. And the cat. Those military ads on tv meant nothing to me, just another commercial. And the whole “Make China look good” angle? Movies tend to mirror whatever is going on in politics, in the government, in the media, stuff I have absolutely no interest in. It’s hard to find a movie without an ulterior motive IRL these days. I’d rather watch something I’ve seen a hundred times and enjoy myself over trying to watch something that just pushes agendas and politics. And *cough* China is pretty messed up anyways in all terms so I’m not surprised *cough* And *cough* the majority of our goods in the US come from China so the government wants to keep them happy *cough* I watched the Creator with my parents cuz my dad was interested and it was the MOST BORING MOVIE EVER. The only thing I took away was that the US Government in the movie was mad they didn’t create this kid and had a tantrum so they wanted him destroyed. Like most things people get mad over if they didn’t have the idea first. Ugh. No thank you! I’ll go back to watching Tron Legacy, iRobot, Ready Player One etc that had a good storyline and used special effects in a tasteful way. TLDR; let anyone try to make me watch, feel, say or do anything I don’t want to do. I’ve never been one to follow the path of anything except what I want to do (without hurting anyone of course) and that is unlikely to change ever. Neurospiciness for the win! Let’s go Neurodivergence!
Butlerian Jihad
We must stay Vigilant.  Or we lose this never ending battle of greed and in-balance.
I think that the trailer from space engerniers discribs ai pretty well "ai is nither good or eval it is a tool for us to use" not I have only seen the first few minits of the vidio when I posted this
That Indian jones unnerved me, the eyes keep going crossed eyed and it actually makes me turn it off
Ah like the good old days.  -👴🏻
Aww almost forgot about the old intro,  such a good tune, glad is back for the last theories
They also used the de-aging technique for Alfred M. Doc Ock for no way home
Noooooooo why do you have to leave US
AI MATPAT WHEN HE'S GONE
AI MatPat coming to a YouTube Theory Channel soon?
Anyone know what programming language is used @15:20 ? It looks like it could be a few things, my guess is C++ but I'm not sure.
your recent minecraft theroy say this is bad, we will mess up, and it will come back to haunt us in the futrue. but hey, thats just a theroy, a real life theroy.
Everyone make propaganda
Do another hazbin hotel theroy
THE OG INTRO
Remember kids support the GOP
Interesting book on this topic Manufacturing Consent By Noam Chomsky 🙂
Ok on the House of Usher example: The girl in the clip gets her AI likeness made but it glitches out and literally tortures her grandfather ala the Nevermore raven. Not exactly a shining example of family friendly AI.
i hope that the recent ai propaganda means we get more tron content. if im gonna be propagandized i should get more content for a really cool world at least
Don't forget about Megan recently. AI is very much bad in that one
Ai matpat sounds a lot like Bill Cipher😂
:D
Thanks. I’ve been in a coma since late 2022, so the gen AI summary was helpful.
If i get 20k likes I’ll get unreal in fortnite(yes um begging for likes but i also wanna see if i could get that much)
Plot twist: this video was written by A.I. Naahh. Just kidding... right?
PLEASE HAZBIN HOTELLLL
WEF is losing control. Wake up normies! Its not too late to save the world
Ah But that's how it starts, first it's just an AI program the play around with, then it keeps getting more and more sophisticated and evolves more and more, and then one day it sees humans as a threat and then comes judgment day and we have terminators walking around and planet Earth is a giant graveyard
You guys are crazy I want a bunch of rich CEOs telling me how I’m the problem while I consume their ai created monstrosities
It amazes me how amateur hour Chinese propaganda is and how they think it'll work well. That Great Wall movie had some Chinese character saying to the Western stand-in of Matt Damon that he should trust China almost every other scene. And don't get me wrong. I thought that movie was dumb fun and loved a lot of the costume design, and I am here for Great Wall of China really keeps out alien monsters who landed on Earth in antiquity, but their attempts at propaganda were not subtle.
Cant wait to see Disney go bankrupt. Idiots lost over a billion just in 2023.
Yeah American civil war movie 2024 ....yeah
Thank you for the intro
Matpat said he would do a hazbin hotel episode but he is returning
*Drops to my knees* Plz, we need a theory video of Hazbin hotel before you leave MatPat. WERE BEGGING YOU!!!
Can you do angel hare… please
7 film theories remain ;0; CRIES
I'm on my knees begging for a Star Trek theory.
Completely off-topic, but could you make a Gravity Falls Theory?
The a.i will self destruct when it sees twitter
HOL UP THAS MATPAT
Walle probably isn't helping.
When I first heard the housing price joke I dying but then I remembered that MatPat won’t be making these opening jokes in for a while…
Lol
Most of us has known this for awhile now
Being scared of A.I. cause someone used it for bad is like being scared of a hammer cause someone got their head bashed in.
This is important
I love that even in the last MatPat theories we can still get this level analysis. It is very important to always   be wary of the messages behind, well, the message of  movies (or media in general). AI specially not something to take lightly. I felt physical repulsion from that "The Creator" section.
MAAAAAN Now I can't write my story about AI. Thanks a lot Hollywood
Someone call in Gregory guys!!!!!!
man the internet will be different without you Matt
We're gonna miss u matt
Gotta say, this is all about perspective, AI could be good and could be bad depend on how we treat, think, and use them. I mean, I used ChatGPT too, but how you ask him will determined how well you spend your time, you could ask him random stuff and see what he will respond, but you could also ask him what you need help with and how will you improve. That's just my way of thinking it but it all comes out how we think of AI. By the way, just a funny note, the boiling frog is actually a metaphorical story, it's not real.
its funny how they said that AI or technology is gonna take over the jobs of doctors, when in reality it took over the jobs of writers, artist, and actors.
The Martian, albeit being a good example of this, is also a bad example. The chinese rocket booster saving the day was written in Andy Weir's book and that, I believe, had no intentions of being introduced to chinese markets.
Ever seen the Cold War propaganda from WB now we’re dealing with ai 🤖 oh goodness and the iorn man 3 things was insane
Um, I would remind you Carrie Fisher was alive during the production of Rogue One. She didn't die till about 1 or 2 weeks after the movie was released.
Which movie is 7:11 from? I heard of that line he says in a song and am just curious
I've been noticing this Rogue One, getting us all emotionally attached to a Droid. It's everywhere now, especially in Star Wars and Marvel properties.
If it weren’t for Chinese governments input, they would be made to be villains like the Germans, Southern Asians, Russians, and Arabs were once the US had conflicts with those regions.
7:11 the 7th heaven clip was a jumpscare tbh
will you talk about wish being made by ai theory
AI is the future...  Whether you like it or not...  It's not the first time technology has made some obsolete...  Besides, AI does exactly what's it's supposed to do...  From making music to scratch your backside, it's a tool...  Saying it's "stealing" is like saying artists don't draw from other artists...  AI is just better, and it keeps getting better, and no one can stop it...  No... One...
before you go PLEASE make a final hunger games theory there's only one and I'd love to see another!
knowing is half the battle. the other half is extreme violence!
The thing is AI could see how we portray it and assume that's the way it's meant to be. And just be exactly how we portrayed it
I think that aging and de-aging is fine, you can consent to that and it's pretty cool. Using AI to create fake people and images or bring people in without their consent, be it their face or voice, is wrong and an evil thing to do.
hey MatPat, i want you to try Outer Wilds.
But that's just a theory, a conspiracy theory. Thanks for watching.
How does _Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3_ play out in this line of thinking, I wonder, especially since it involves our main villain trying his utmost damndest to recreate art by developing (and then quickly disposing of) vast populaces of intelligent life through highly immoral means? I suppose it could be more about the use (or misuse, rather) of technology rather than its offsprings if we were to look at it through the perspective presented here, but it seems more of a “jab” against the “programming” than the other Disney “examples” mentioned in this video so I found that (possible) slight overlook interesting.  I also thought it was a bit odd to strictly project _The Creator,_ as part of this pro-AI propaganda train that you’ve illustrated here, considering how development for it had started no later than 2019, back before we even started having this whole AI-nightmare conversation. To me, the sympathies held for the robots in that film were no different from the sympathies held for the aliens in _Avatar_ and _District 9_ - all of them merely (admittedly not-so-subtle) SF lenses to peer towards messages of love and acceptance of others (kinda odd to do the vice-versa of that, innit?) - and the only reason _The Creator_ got tied up in all the current discussion spheres regarding _our_ “AI” is the simplest of misunderstandings: timing. But hey…  ALSO, further on the topic of _The Creator,_ you mentioned it was released through Searchlight Pictures, “Disney’s indie arm”. It wasn’t; 20th Century Studios did. Just wanted to throw that out there as well!
Absolutely does need to be regulated I was not expecting it to be because of the movie though!!!
can you make a video on buffy the vampire slayer
How do you TOTALLY skip over the propaganda thats been doing on for MANY decades-global warming, or cooling, or climate change in general...including disney.  Also propagandized very heavily in the past decade and a half are LGBT, the weather and/or industrialization is ending the world, and mixed relationships and you avoided those issues rather openly.
Literal definition of “When the world needed him most, he vanished”… for humanity’s sakes I hope we wake up soon.
I for one welcome our AI overlords 👍
I.... don't know if Fall Of The House Of Usher is a good example of a pro-AI message. I mean - we all watched the same finale, right?
Your talking about the wrong Disney propohanda
You should do a new attack on titan theory
This comment is based on the title alone, my reaction seeing this in my recommended: "Wow, Disney making Propaganda?  GUHHDURRR, about TIME somebody figured it out and said it out loud, yeesh."
Got an ad about how ai is improving the workspace on this video, crazy stuff
One of the biggest problems in entertainment today is that the teams behind these projects have grown so large and so unwieldy that a game with 1000 developers building a hand-crafted world ends up coming across as more generic and soulless than games built by 10 people who are heavily using generative tools. It's because each of those 10 people are going to end up even just accidentally having their personality bleed into the work. Where with the thousand man team you're literally just recreating that generative process without allowing anyones individuality to bleed into their work bc they are literally doing the exact same mundane task day after day for 6 years.  The department heads want all of these areas to have a consistent quality so you end up with dozens of people all doing the exact same job where they aren't allowed to do anything that might stand out. They literally made a process that was done to give each area a new and unique flavor into the most mundane, soul-crushingly repetitive process in the entire development of games. Instead of building unique, hand-crafted environments these developers created the slowest, most inefficient, most soulless form of content creation anyone could have ever developed. To give these artificial spaces a sense of humanity they ended up creating the borg from Star Trek whose only job is literally placing clutter around environments to make them seem lived in. They have literally taken some of the most creative people in the world and stripped them of any ability to do something creative. Instead of compiling the works of 1000 creative people to generate something new they have taken the 1000 people and told them all to do the exact same thing.  We think about gaming specifically as this massively innovative space where individuals can make their wildest dreams come true, but the reality is that the only place anything innovative is happening is in indy studios. Places where someone can come up with an idea and within minutes they have an answer as to whether or not they can even attempt to do it. In these massive AAA studios a team member can find a glaring issue day 1 and it takes so long for that issue to reach the people allowed to make decisions that the team has already been developing around that issue for months. So we get games like Starfield, where the floating point issue was very obvious even very early in development, but rather than fixing that problem, every system in the game had already been built around it regardless of how negatively it impacted what developers were capable of doing. So while fixing the problem would still have been the best option, they instead decided having to tweak months or years worth of development wasn't worth the effort even though solving that 1 problem would have resolved 95% of the problems the game has.  At this point a lot of these massive studios are only massive bc the size of your team is a status symbol more than anything. They did the wrong things for the right reasons and ended up making the worlds worst and fleshiest AI generative programs. And I think gaming specifically would be in a much better place if these 400 person teams instead became 4 teams of 100 people with each team making their own game.
Gone are the days when A.I writes funny unexpected scripts, it has been advanced to craft dull scripts instead.
how to forget emma and her two moms
Top Gun is fun to watch bc 1. Plane go spinny 2. The bad guys are honestly kept pretty vague It does look and feel Cold War but it's done in a way I don't have to think about, and can't become quickly out of date. That's why the new movie works too I think, except now the planes have more computers.
Quick note! I believe "Prom Pact" actually was using 3D doubles, not AI / deepfakes.
I didn't realize all of those were propaganda until Matt just pointed it out. I just thought it was a reflection of the times when that content was made and not the other way around. I'd still like to believe that because otherwise it makes me feel cynical about the world in which we live.
This thumbnail is classic
I as an artist think AI is a good tool for mood boards and inspiration. I don't see it as art theft because we as humans take bits and pieces of whatever we see and experience from our lives the same way an AI does to create artwork. No artist can pull up every other artist they've seen in their life that has some sort of influence on their style. Just like you will use real photographs as references but it's not like you are going to post the photograph and link the photographer (that's assuming its not from a repost or actual thief)   I'm sure a lot of the images the AI generators use are from many different sources and they would have to be programed to pick the oldest posted image of every image it filters through to try and find the original, assuming it wasn't deleted by the original artist, assuming the original artist even has an online presence still, because some people delete entire social media accounts or just give up on media entirely to live in the moment with their families. The AI would essentially have to have a whole separate system just to find and verify the artist, just because it took say the shape of an eyebrow or the color of the hair, or the shape of an ear for one part of a larger image. Like if a human took the same shade of purple, are you really going to go "THEIF" ?   Like I talked to another artist and they brought up AI making money from it. AI is a creation in itself. Would you not spend money on your own artwork? The person or people sat for hours coding this AI generator and training it and putting in rules so you can't generate certain images, or specific people, or even some heavily copyrighted content. You don't think they should be paid for their effort? their program?   Also every artist uses bits and pieces of things from our life that has influenced us, so to say that an AI's creators shouldn't be paid for what the AI creates because it's theft is literally saying every artist is a thief and nobody should be paid for any art, because originality is not a real thing, everything has been thought at least once, it's wether you act on it to make it a reality that makes it a difference. Do you know how many people have made mermaid animals thinking it was original? or drawn a giant dog or a tiny person with wings etc. I never saw horses with mermaid tails, so when I was 12yr I drew horses with mermaid tails. Then I found out via a horse card game that it had been already done and it wasn't "original"   Things are only original when they haven't been discovered yet.   I literally had a dream that I want to turn into a game and my friend goes "isn't that _______ game?" and I don't even know the game they are talking about but apparently it has already been created in a sense by someone completely different.   We as a species just need to stop thinking we are all the main characters and accept that we all have similar ideas and embrace the fact that we can mix and match different things to make "newer" things. At least things that haven't yet been found, maybe even created yet. Idk I'm losing my train of thought.   TLDR; Just saying AI is a good tool and it shouldn't have to be yeeted because people are scared of it. That all art is a mixture of bits and pieces so you literally can't call it theft without calling yourself a thief.   Also there are some things AI will never be able to generate because of the different meanings or variables of certain words or different varying names for objects. I've used it and its tricky to get specific things you see in your head to turn out well. Especially if you don't use the right  wording/words.
My dude, this is literally the most important piece of work you've ever produced. period. Thank you. Truly an Opus at a moment when its needed most   **[NOT just about AI, just in case that's not profoundly obvious]
I'm so saddened to hear of Mat's upcoming suicide.
The OG Intro on this 😭
Wait did MatPat choose to have an Army recruitment ad play right after the segment on ARMY RECRUITMENT ADS or was that just an actual coincidence??? I never get those ads on youtube
The thing that has be not fully believing in ai is the future is because there’s no Microsoft app lol if photo shop got an ai feature update that I missed then that would do it but I really feel like if anyone were gonna pioneer paywalled ai it would fit perfectly in some blue to red Microsoft app
Film Theory: The sky is blue
Comment for the channel
Final matpat episode he reveals he was Q the whole time
AI completely broke my career
YESSSSSS i missed the intro
I have a theory about hazbin hotel is that don't you think that adam used to been a demon and he is the only one that looks like a demon and plus angels can turn into demons. And that the real reason why adam doesn't like demons going to heaven is because he wants to be the only demon to be redeemed to heaven
I've been saying for a long time that Disney's recent content is mostly unwatchable, mainly because they stopped hiring good writers and starting hiring people based on their minority status. Normally, I'd be upset about AI taking people's jobs, but in Disney's case, the content might actually improve!
And here I thought this this video was going to be about how Disney is using propaganda to push the woke agenda
The old intro 🥺🥺🥺
Bro said f it I’m retiring and went all out
I mean if you want to get people to pay attention to something you have to make it entertaining in some way. Thats why some ads feel like episodes of shows with their animation and storyline and you get to the end and realize it was all just an ad u-u
Ai is inevitable, and telling people to like it is probably for the best. It's a tool, until it achieves sentience, a tool that can tell you what it wants, if you ask it to. Writers should be using it to help with ideas. Voice actors could use it to not have to do thousands of time consuming retakes. What's important, is that we remain the ones using it, and not our corporate overlords.  Lucky for us, most of those old farts have no Fing clue how to make AI do quality content.
Talk about Palestine
When will you do a BFDI theory!
Matpat hitting the mark on Disney pushing propaganda, but also missing a huge one at the same time 💀 come on bro, shake it up before you leave.
Semi related. The Avengers video game did not include the likeness rights to any of the Avengers actors. As a result the characters looked nothing like their movie counterparts. Since then Disney has been collecting the likeness of all of the Star Wars actors. Mark Hamill in the mandalorian. Carrie Fisher and Rogue one. Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones. They even got James Earl Jones's voice as Darth Vader in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show. They are building a collection of permission to use actors as likeness without the actor This truly is The Darkest Timeline
NO WAY!?!?!?
I actually like the trope of a companion robot/ai character in sci fi films. But nowadays I don’t like it too much because it’s being so overdone in companies attempts to convince us that ai is a savior of some kind. I do not like the idea of someone using my likeness against my wishes to say things I’d never say, do things I’d never do and being sued because they claim that they own my likeness.
Yo, MatPat is Godzilla minus one, going to get mentioned on this channel?
SpongeBob was right! The robot invasion IS coming.
You also have all the woke propaganda that Disney and other media outlets are pushing XD
omfg thank u, I hate being fed ideals without even knowing
The actual sigh of relief when the old intro music started to play. I'm so happy.
in my opinion the whole ai being used by big companies thing is disappointing just because there's so many incredibly talented people that should have a chance to make money with their abilities instead of being thrown aside and replaced with a computer to save a couple bucks like obviously big companies don't care as long as they're making money but it's just kinda disheartening to see
Thank you, MatPat, for always tackling important issues and using your platform for good. Your work will be missed, but the impact you've made will continue on. Cheers to you!
Disney will go absolutely bonkers after seeing this.
Pshh we all know the real propaganda that is being pushed is all this normalization of fruit cakes and weirdos who like to cut their things off. Disgusting
THE OLD INTRO AHHHHHHHH
haven’t watched the video yet but how is this news? disney has literally always done propaganda
agent smith: "that is the sound of inevitability"
People still watch this?
Making a video about Disney making propaganda and not even mentioning once all the woke bullcrap they're trying to push is just as nefarious as Disney.
Hey while we’re talking about propaganda in tv then let me just say they are doing it with lgbtq+ as well
i still havent seen anything that convince me otherwise those job lost are simply due to advanced technology, like horse carriage when car were invented, and when computer dominated the market the newspaper industry died. yes, its sad, but really nothing to riot about.
That wasn't the propaganda I was thinking of Disney pushing. I was thinking of a random jumble of letters, followed by a '+'.
Have any of y'all heard of Bad Idea Ai? Aka $BAD 😅
the difference between generative AI and sentient robots is much bigger than your argument seems to act like it is sentience is what *makes* someone a person generative AI isn't sentient, it's an algorithm but actual use of generative AI in movies *is* an example of pro-AI propaganda here, so, yeah, you've got a point personally i like stories about sentient machines because it gives a feeling like even though they're not something traditional and accepted by everyone they still are valid people who deserve empathy
Hurry up and retire already.
We live in a world where this is actually a sane theory in comparison to the others…
me: laughing because i got to this by watching a matpat ai cover
When he started talking about the military endorsing films, I knew Transformers was coming.
Not all heroes wear capes.
You’ll be missed
How much longer until mattpat leaves?
So you’re just gonna pump out these bangers then leave us?
I've been a fan for a while, and I'll say wholeheartedly I'll miss you being a host, while at the same time your new hosts are sure to do a great job with someone like you still directing the channel. I love all your channels, but the one that really made a big first impression was game theory. It was really what got me into game theorizing during my highschool years, and I discovered games through you and other channels like Markiplier and Jackscepticeye I would have never found or tried otherwise, like Fnaf and Undertale (I always had a softspot for the Undertale theories lol), and I love how you never said concretely "This is how it works" but rather "This is how it Could work" and let everyone come to their own conclusions, their own theories, and I guess that's what being a theorist is all about, finding your own answers. I remember seeing your goodbye announcement video at work and I tried so hard not to cry. It's never easy to say goodbye, but I'm theorizing (and hoping) this isn't a goodbye, just a goodbye till next time. The internet won't be the same without you, but hey, that's just a theory, A GAME, FILM, FOOD, AND STYLE THEORY! I think many will agree that we wish you and your family good luck on whatever happens next in your lives. From: A Theorist named Zeal.
Womp womp
That's horrifying. Anyone can become Enemy #1 and with technology to make Anyone anyone, where is your right to defense?
We will miss you matpat :(
We all know AI is gonna take us over Also AI art is original because all art is just things you've seen/heard put on something in some way
Whoever made the pushup comment is dead now 😂
I mean, since when have they not? The problem is how it's snuck into everything they make now and not reserved to its own works.
The old film theory intro got my nostalgia flaring up. Thank you MatPat
I would love to see Mat's take on the movie Eyes wide shut , that would be fire .
Propoganda is litteraly somthing to change the views about anything not neccesary without you noticing or at least i like thinking about it
YO THE THEME IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LETS GO THEORY FAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was not ready for the Buffy Beer episode to get two clips, back to back, in a Film Theory video about AI🤣
This is the most tin foil hat indusing video I have ever watched from MatPat
THE INTRO IS BACK😭🙏
I missed the intro so much lol
Now this is a video that explains everything
Detroit become human is an epic game
2 small series no one even watched
Y’all is that Barack Obama 😭 3:15
Was AI used to make the thumbnail to prove a point, it seems pretty simple compared to other ones
Go for President. America needs a new Party.
Disney is really just woke propaganda at this point. I wish we could go back to the early days.
You saying how many theories you have left doesn’t help the pain of you leaving…..
Not for nothing but it wasn’t just Disney or Netflix in the movie and show you mentioned. “The Creator” and the “Fall of the house of Usher” both used AI…I believe FOTHOU was completely AI. That was propaganda was put forth by AI writers!! Super scary
The biggest probelm with those earlier deepfakes you mentioned was the fact that Peter Cushing was dead, and they hadn't properly consulted his family about using his likeness. Thats what made it in such poor tatse. Harrison Ford was in Indi V. They weren't unfairly profiting off of the likeness of a dead man with no say in the matter. That's the difference.
Think my favorite movie: interstellar, the AI is friendly and relatable making you really like the character
14:17 is he saying that he had physical relations with an A.I. person at the end?
Bruh, the nostalgia from game theory and film theory theme music is crazy ((:
3:13 that looks like Scott cawthon
SEVEN
I thought that for the mandolorian they just had someone who looks like mark hamil play Luke 💀
Hey not fanf vid but i get someone who dose fanf and i think you guys should do a team work , knwoing that matpat will be gone i hope for the future you will read this and think of the idea
Good luck on your journrey Mat we will miss you!!
So AI itself isn't the problem. Greed is.
Matpat is making very good point how these cooperation are trying to push AI. But I find it kinda funny that a lot of his examples are pieces of media that hardly anyone watched, especially the disney examples😂.
Ai
Dear Matpat, its been awhile since your last attack on titan episode, 5 years to be exact. Now the series is finished, along with its anime, can you make another Attack on titan episode?
But on the other hand ai also isn't the worst thing ever it has allowed for much faster testing of how certain enzymes will react with other compounds and can process data really fast. People are quick to fully support or fully oppose ai but it's not that simple which is precisely why it's such a huge debate.
Awhh, I thought this was talking about the issues of film being soiled by writers who care more about their own woke political agendas than actual good writing. XD
what a silly waste of your time
Thanks for sorta bringing me up to speed on this subject, Mat. I still don't quite get it, but...
Propaganda? Hot.
Anyone else waiting for a theory on Hazbin hotel?
If we love AI , we'll become a dumb human , a lazy human. Even a job could help with AI , AI is  hijacked humanity , can we even made everything by ourselves ?
Disney has been making propaganda since at least 1941 and they literally never stopped.  This is nothing new.
Hey! Can we please ban the bots which are responding to everybodie's comments?
Please stop the reminders... I already know housing prices are not worth it
The worst part about the Actor's Strike is that we Actor's  didn't get the AI protections we were looking for.
8:38 i got that silk money
Matpat isn't retiring he's just being revealed as a high tech AI and has to go into hiding.
This feels made with ai
PANTHEON!
I literally smiled tilted my head when I heard the old intro!
I went to see The Marvels, and loved it. Never realised the propo in it!!!   But I don't think it worked on me. I was confused the entire time bc I believed the Great Intelligence was evil.
Thank You, modern propaganda needs to be talked about more.
Matt Patt didn't k1ll himself.
i personally love AI ! mostly because it give me the chance to talk with my Idol,, Marceline ! that i could never spoke to otherwise,, i mean,,, its still something,,, a bit
Please do a game theory on Neon Genesis Evangelion
The Transformers were also propaganda of the Cold War.
"AH, AHHhhhhh..."  -Very Smart AI
With the plot of secret invasion it makes sense for the intro
Man, situations like this always kinda make me sad due to how much I love the sci-fi idea of robots/A.I. finding humanity. It still strikes me as a cool concept that can be awesome to see when written well, but seeing how A.I. is being used IRL and how movies about it are essentially propaganda devalues it as a whole. Like Mat said, The Creator is a beautiful movie about this concept, but it's tainted by how there's bigger, more shady machinations involved.
It's sad that people aren't realizing this. Even how some game developers have been using AI instead of hiring creatives. Shame on all these companies and the selfish people who don't think one step ahead of their noses. Wake up people. Stop support your own career death
One think I feel greatful for is that my job won’t be taken by AI for a long while
Disney also made Ron’s gone wrong
Yeah... thats not the only type of propaganda Disney is currently pushing... all the DEI stuff, that is "oh so nice" in the surface has also particular reasons to be there.
Everyone knew Disney was corrupt.
when is the Peter griffin is mr krupp theory
Funny. I love the concept of robots and AI and stuff, but I wouldn't want it for creativity. We like creating things. We like being imaginative. I like making games and audioplays. I don't think AI will be useful outside of the idea prompting they can do. They won't be able to take the ideas I've had in my brain for two decades and make a decent series out of them the way I am working on.  I'd like an AI person to be my personal HoHness interpreter because that's not using a hearing human who has a real life and their own side of things. AI doctors and soldiers won't be being traumatised by their jobs, they won't be making mistakes due to tiredness or hunger or illness themselves. (Once we get their logic past 'Human holding weapon whether 4 or 40 = bad, can deduce whether forced or happy to hurt' then we're on our way.)  And that's just what playing Detroit Become Human has given to me. Heck I'll take an android for platonic companionship because humans refuse to especially because I'm disabled and struggle to make friends. Ew me. Maybe I'll stop making the same mistakes that cause me to lose friends because the android can tell me what I'm doing wrong instead of getting all offended and huffy. I'd love a lil' android pet. You mentioned Astro Boy, imagine a lil' robot Kimba cub bouncing around~ Just someone I can brainstorm with other than me would be nice. Sorry that's what being lonely for your life does for you.
I don't know what the issue is with AI taking over work if they are better.
Chinas influence on the world is immense…
PLEASE KEEP THE OLD INTROS IN NEW VIDEOS FROM NOW ON! Please, they were SO missed!
My bad art is way better than any ai "art"
11:19 I robot move
Love that my parents were wise enough to avoid Disney as far back as 1990.
Propaganda or not, I am indifferent to AI.
The extras in prom pact were actually just meta humans comped in, they were not AI. They were an after thought, and were made quickly which is why the animation is so bad. If it were AI, it wouldn't be as badly animated.
The housing crisis is a real issue that needs attention and action from government officials. It's unfortunate that it takes a movie to get their attention, but sometimes creative ways are needed to bring about change. Hopefully, this can open up a dialogue and lead to some much-needed solutions.
The Creator was really good movie!
Disney must be like: MATPAT DISCOVERED WE ARE DOING PROPAGANDA?? WE NEED TU SHUT HIM DOWN IMME... wait is he said it's about AI?... ah, yeah, lol, it's ok then.
imo as an artist, AI can kiss my a not only does it do a sad job of creating "art" by basically stealing artists work against their will, its also wholly uncreative and, imo, boring every piece looks the same, especially the anime pieces  also, fun fact! Wacom (the industry standard for digital art tablets) was found using AI "art" in thier ads imagine undermining the same people youre advertising to
i wonder what MatPat thinks of Detroit: Become Human
im a frog in boiling water guys
5 second rule episode pls!
The only AI I will ever endorse is Allen Iverson
Disney is definitely trying to push it I mean think about it they didn’t break any records in the box office in 2023 and I blame ai on that also bad writing I feel like some of wish was made by ai but some of it was actually written I mean think of the song that the king whatever his name was was singing that seemed like a song made by ai we from bangers like a whole new world or how far I’ll go to that if Walt was still alive they would still he doing well
"You knew it was beer" Wow I don't remember that episode at all! 😆
Spoiler: Disney always made propaganda
I came here for entertainment and now i'm actually enlightened on the dangers of just blindly Accepting corporate propaganda.
Great. ANOTHER person needlessly demonizing Disney. Well at least this channel has an excuse because it’s not really a serious channel.
The only propaganda Disney is pushing is their left leaning garbage. Every movie
the whole world should watch this video
Great video Mat, believe it or not this is going on all around us with more than just Disney and AI.
Am I the only one that thought the AI Matpat didn't sound that good?
as someone who has always wanted to become an artist/animator, this makes me really sad
Tom Cruise sitting in one of his many 20 million dollar homes being like "Fix housing prices, they seem fine to me"
O.o
Arming yourself with knowledge is incredibly important, but not when it’s as archaic and one sided as this video.
HEYYYYY I WATCHED THE MARVELS WITH MY MOTHER I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW.
Hope matpat does not get sued by Disney😬😬😐
0:30 seconds in and I know MatPat is fibbing; Biden couldn't follow the plot of an episode of Dora the Explorer, let alone a Mission Impossible film...
I thought he quit what?
My guy Matpat just skipped over last 10 years because media has been pushing LGBTQ propaganda and that's too much of a hot button issue to point out.
Disney's making propaganda? Took you long enough.
Disney pushing propaganda is hardly new
Im so happy that the og intro is back
im patiently waiting as well as freaking out for Poppy to be finally released before MatPat retires. I want to hear him talk about it one last time.
Nice!
THE INTROOOOO
Disney has been doing this for years, pulling strings, puhsing agendas, blowing up the nuclear family and we now have our current social climate, and now moving on to the next thing. Brainwashing people before they even realize it. Fun times
I feel like certain uses of ai aren't bad, but once you dip your toes into using it for financial gain it becomes a problem
I don't pay anyone to do my laundry. There are machines for that. I don't pay anyone to do my taxes. Power of the computer. I don't have a band at home, just a music system. Now a computer writes the scripts I see. Do you notice it yourself, right?
We need a you hit metal 17 times instagram lore theory video. Anyone with me
0:39 intro is back??!?!?!
Stop Disney Fr
The current message they are pushing is clearly feminism, homosexuality and how being straight or manly is wrong
It’s crazy that MatPat is making a piece of propaganda in which he criticizes propaganda
The House of Usher thing is a stretch. Because spoilers.
Dystopian mega corporations ruling the fate of humankind, sad world we leave to our childs
Me a Spanish: oh, I can sleep
I love how he brought back his old intros, and in my opinion, they should stay even after he leaves, as a reminder that he started it all and stuff, the intros and music are also just amazing
2:39 I can tell the difference lol
This is my first time hearing the film theory original intro for sooooooooooo long
AI and Government tried to keep this propaganda away from my 😂😂😂 My YouTube completely stopped working and kicked me off but every other app would work. 😭😂
watching you till the end, dude. thanks for filling in my childhood so long.
Horizon Zero Dawn, that game makes think about the progress of AI and robotics and its message is clear: watch for which progress you do because you could doom us all
Well, maybe the Kree Homeworld just grew overly complacent with The Supreme Intelligence, relying on it for everything. Would anyone prefer people going to that extreme instead?
The Flowers Are Blooming In Antarctica🫡
Ayyeee Matt Patt speaking the facts! Love your videos! Gonna be sad to see you go! But couldn't people also thus video is anti ai propaganda? Mind you I do agree with you.
The Martian is a poor example. The Chinese space program is depicted exactly the way it was in the book. There is no Pro-China angle. It’s even stated in both the book and the movie as they saw it as a good PR move.
DONT BELIEVE DONT BELIEVE DONT BELIEVE
Little late for this kinda of outcry.
"Something that everyone can agree on like Nazis = Bad" I guess this was written in 2016.
oh wow, im the 10000th comment!
Dear MatPat,  I would like to request for you to make a theory video about Possibly in Michigan (1983). Something concerning exactly what the strange man? Is
😞 great. Half way through house of usher and it’s ruined.  Could’ve spoiler warned for a second.
Does big hero 6 fall into this category?
All hail the great Basilisk!!!!!
I so happy ypu brought the theme back
pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee do a video for over the garden walllllllll
TBH the best propaganda tactics Disney has employed for AI recently is hiring actual screenwriters. At this point the AI can only do better than what they've put out recently.
We will all dread the day Matt leaves us
It sad that Disney isn’t appreciating Artist anymore.
I’ll do 1 sit-up for every like this comment gets 👍
People will become so smart until they're dumb.  This is what happen when you put the lazy and greedy in charge.
7:10 that was a lofi song I heard once, anyone know the name?
So honestly, my opinion  and view of generative ai is Asmongold's opinion of generative ai. It is no different than a human artist using other people's work as inspiration for their own. You have an algorithm that actively pulls works from the internet to pool them into one new picture. The truth to the matter is that the public as a whole does not care about how the product is made, they only care that they receive the product (otherwise tesla would never sell any cars due to the unethical/environmental concerns around lithium mining and apple would never sell any phones due to the unethical work environments over in China).
Thank you for bringing this awareness MatPat.  Knowing is half the battle for sure.  While I knew that this was starting to become a thing, I've never liked it, and frankly it's scary.  I sure wouldn't want someone using my likeness or voice in AI.  I really love these kinds of videos, and Disney is going too far...
Just on the House of Usher mention, I did think the AI plotpoint was relatively unexplored and out of place, but it definitely felt creepier than good. Like the usual fare for horror series, it more seems like a riff on "nobody can live forever and the people trying to are charlatans" especially when - (SPOILERS AHEAD)     The AI replica of Lenore is never shown to be anything close to functional, instead completely broken in its only active appearance, simply spamming "nevermore" to Roderick's cell phone. Thematic to the scene in the show, and also somewhat critiquing transhumanist 'AI me' rhetoric, albeit indirectly.
I was literally told this semester in college not to use AI because students were starting to use it to write essays. Luckily, they AI just tends to write nonsense and nothing like it’s supposed author so it’s easy to spot, but the idea that an entire essay can be written by an AI and pass as a human in this year is insane  Edit: as much as I would love to use it, my teacher said he had a program borrowed from the IT people at the college that can scan for AI when you are writing an essay. He said you can ONLY us certain AI to fix grammar and whatnot. Like Word
Yeah they should make a mission impossible movie About rising house prices
Rocky 4 definitely has anti-soviet messages, I love how at the end its clear its not anti-russian, having a scene thats show the contrast

I am really worried that this slow and gradual acceptance of AI will eventually take over the creative arts if there's not enough pushback made. But it saddens me more that most outside the loop won't care enough, especially when they follow "content" creators who do nothing all day but sit in their filth-covered rooms pedalling the opinion of the artist won't matter.
hahahahahahahahahahah   that's been a while now xD
Don't go!
I don't even like disney
Good thing woke propaganda is failing so hard.
Thank you for giving me another reason not to watch The Marvels
I figured that Disney was propaganda.
MatPat forgot to mention how Top Gun: Maverick was sponsored by a weapons company.
Film Theorists SW EU fans Marvel comic fans 🤝
That part about Chinese government's influence on media is interesting. I did notice that recently, there's a lot more presence of Chinese New Year in various medias. Tons of live service games now have events for it, when not long ago it was more niche.
Anyone else noticed the Ai brain thing at the end turning purple?
The biggest propaganda Disney pushes is lgbt
This is not a theory. This is a fact.
first they outsource American businesses to other less-fortunate countries, now they're outsourcing graphic design to AI. These corporate business men sure are cheap and lazy, aren't they?
Can you make a video about shwoz from henry danger/danger force because he is so smart and we don’t know where he is from. Basically I have a lot of questions about shwoz.
The Lobotomized Frogs used in the boiling water experiment stayed. Normal frogs bounced.
love seeing Tom Clancy
They are playing the long game. Also the CEO is political so this isn’t surprising.
After 10 years, i realized i commited a horrendous crime, not subbed to the theory Channels. Thankfully i subbed before he retired ❤ edit, this is a war on ai and we must  not let them win. And i wont let them take me.
11:37  game is game
In an alternate world Biden watches the creator instead and makes legislation giving Ai human rights.
That's nothing new really.
So basically, just start striking for AI rights/fair pay and all this will go away 😅   ...As well as preventing the AI revolution
One thing that is rarely gets discussed in the whole AI ethics discussion is the ethics of automating a very important part of the human experience. Yes, a lot of people are doing certain art for the sake of money, but most others are trying their best at trying to balance between certain amount of corporate control in exchange of funding.  For those who tell others to "just do it as a part-time hobby": There's a good reason why I only have one guitar video on my channel. I wanted to play very technical music, yet I barely had enough time to practice, thus my sense of rhythm never was good enough, and instead I shifted my creative focus to other things. And within the worst AI-artpocalypse, we might no longer have new tools for creating art, and it's only the privilege of the fewer and fewer companies that control and create our entertainment. Also generative-AI, at least in its current form, was not meant as a tool for artists, but as a replacement of them.
hoo boy.. Johny Silverhand theme song is starting to sound really strongly
That opening! So cheecky! Housing prices 😆 yes please 🙏😅
Mat has seen the Cuban sand which video
Film theory went from frozen isn’t scientifically accurate to Mickey Mouse is the responsible for the downfall of humanity
Hey matpat can you do a video on toon tuft the riggy series
***spoilers for fall of the house of usher***  I will say about the House of Usher series, that AI went on to torment Lenore’s grandfather after she died because it malfunctioned and would text him as her only saying “Nevermore”
I love these deep dive style theories when you look into real world subjects being used in the film, game, food and style industries. I can't believe that Iron Man 3 starts with Milk propaganda in the Chinese version, that is really bizarre to me. Also, seeing the old Film Theory intro was fantastic! Thank you MatPat.
Ai is gonna put ALOT of people out of jobs if we aren’t careful. It’s truly an issue young people should be concerned about
The theory claims to have knowledge to form your own opinions but never delves into the opposition of pro AI
IA propaganda has existed since forever. The Robot / Foundation series of Asimov has a robot as protagonist that evolves to be a benign IA, Spielberg´s IA exists, and Her also exists.  This is a bit of nitpicking to show that "we used to make movies about how IA was scary and now we don´t" which is not the case at all.
AI Matpat sounds like Ben Shapiro 😅
Lol, if all of that is propaganda, they’re going to have to do a lot better. 😂 With the exception of one of those movies listed, they’ve all sucked hard. The final one, no one bothered to even watch. In the end, no one wants a “digital copy” of themselves walking around independent of themselves. It’s like having a sad evil clone zombie walking about. 😣
Ok but the Indiana Jones deepfake face was so obvious...especially when he opened his mouth and tried to make face expressions.And yes AI may take my job.I`m a graphic designer and I am worried.
It's kinda funny. All the media making AI the bad guy over the years it was sort of about time someone said, "hey, maybe it could be a good guy too" but the timing shows that it's really propaganda to get people to think of AI in a more friendly light.
My personal opinion on the AI stuff:  It's useful, but just like all technology, it can also be used for malicious purposes. If the artist team for a movie collectively went "ok, this section is really tedious, lets use AI to speed up the process" then that would be okay. But if Disney starts laying off workers because they can just replace they're job with an AI, then Disney just is being cheap and greedy. What about those people who just lost their job because of a literal robot? And using AI to replicate someone's voice or likeness without their consent? Yeah, that's not okay at all. AI is a tool that can be used for a lot of things, some good, some bad, and some that's questionable. It all depends on the people who use it.
The problem with warning people that they are being tricked is that they then believe they can always spot it. That's the problem with propaganda/dogma/advertisements. They're all designed to use human psychology against a person and no one is immune. This video demonstrates that by using a lot of different pulls that make people feel comfortable, familiar and congratulated, smart and on the "right team". All things propaganda does.  That said, not all propaganda is bad. We use it a lot with out realizing it. The motive behind it and specific tactics matter a lot more than being propaganda itself. Falsifying information is a one that is generally nefarious. Playing on nostalgia, comfort and feelings is motive dependent and other tactics are things we use to simply communicate and get someone on our side about an idea, innocuous or important.  You are never immune to trickery. You are never immune to being a victim of a con, scam or propaganda. Knowing that helps a lot, because it makes you aware of your own weakness and not blame yourself when it happens. It's smart to be aware, but it is a Dunning-Kruger effect to assume that being aware can stop it. There are certain tactics that almost always work, and new ones developed and honed for the same purpose. It's a battle. You will take losses.
Detroit become human is the perfect example... We do not know what AI will choose.
If you’re leaving… can’t ai matpat just replace you? Like the Santa Clause 2
“Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.” "Do not fear the Ixians. They can make the machines,  but they can no longer make arafel. I know. I was there."
I'm surprised you didn't do any theories on the owl house,you would've been right on every single theory if you did them :(
7,  ...I mean. This isn't even surprising.
I was thinking he was going to talk about Sabra in the ongoing Palestinian genocide: 2nd Gazan Genocide.
AI as it is used today is just a buzz word anyway.  It's to make everything sound more sophisticated than it really it.  The AI of today is merely a bunch of algorithms giving the illusion of thought.
2:03 What a dumb argument. AI does literally what humans do. Take information and regurgitate. Nothing is original.
I love the film theory intro
I definitely need an at least yearly update of the current propaganda
Engagement!! Because people are dumb and need it spelled out. We will miss you
The Creator's plot holes are too large for me to get in to it. Sorry. Stories about "the AI is just defending itself from the evil humans" have been around for a long time. Do people not read books any more?
Film Theory: Disney is Making Propaganda  Disney: Always have been
You know, if I steal my own identity, maybe that'll make it harder for them to steal it from me. *Trains a GPT on his discord conversations just so I can teach my friends the difference between AI-me and real-me* It pays to be prepared.
You know, i don't mind big company using AI to reduce costs etc. But what i do mind is while those companies safe millions & billions of $ they still increase the prices of everything.  That is disgusting & tbh it should be clear from the very start of a movie that AI technologic was used and at what proportions.
Propaganda or not the matrix really is a movie where I would like to see the A.I./robots and humans make peace and get along. In the beginning the humans were clearly the ones at fault. They would rather block out the sun and destroy their planet than make a deal with the robots who weren't even asking for much. The machines might have done some messed up stuff but they were never the bad guys they were just protecting themselves.
This is something ive noticed. I think movie propaganda is fine in how they used to use it. Where the propaganda kind of went alongside the film and showed support for a just cause. It was no different really than having a sponsored product be included. They want support for the product so they implement it into things you wanna watch. What I do think is a problem is when they start to use them to create the issues the propaganda is against or related to.   As for the AI use I think it has become a bit apparent that most of the older generations fears are coming true. Those pro ai always tout how the technology should be allowed because there are limiters and such in place. The films like terminator are still long off. While that may be the case I still dont like how we have come to use it too often. In some regards they can be cool or helpful. In others they just make things more complicated or ruin them. People are getting lazy and less skilled thus not able to perform tasks that would be easier for an ai or robotic machine to handle instead. We also have seen a surge in spoiled fools who take advantage of what they have and ask for more.   Pro Ai users will also talk about how the AI has to learn the bad behavior from humans to be capable of it 1st. While that may seem great like all we have to do is act correctly so it cannot learn that stuff its easier said than done. A part of being human is having to struggle or overcome hardships in order to improve ones self. We fight and start wars and do all kinds of wrongful acts. Those who do, typically dont justify it being done to others but they will continue to appear overtime. Its enevitable. So rather worrying about how to fix the impossible how about we do what we can?!  We have to learn to get along to the best of our abilities. Its a constant struggle but a part of life. Now do I think everyone should have to worry about how they impact everyone else? No I dont. Exaggerating and grouping people together against one another only leads to more divisive actions/notions causing more harm. I wont worry about how crime is being dealt with in a city on the otherside of the country. It doesnt affect me. Now if that trouble started to spread or affected a loved one who went there than yeah it affects me. At which point I would want to take a stance or do something about it. I cannot help it if others make the wrong choices in life. I can help make sure I hold others accountable and certain standards are abeided by. I can want people to succeed and our businesses to flourish without pandering to someone elses whims. Its gotten very bad.   Ai isnt the only thing being pushed recently. We have things like dei and certain other controvercial topics being pushed into the limelight. Thats so they can bring attention to their demands. To me its all a big game of how long can you last and keep the audience distraction.
And they're supporting israel. 🆓🍉
You know I wonder if the Chinese filter understands sarcasm as well as its people? Would be funny if a very satirical film made it through.......
How dare you tell America to wake up when you're the one that's late to the party.
A lot of republicans and kanye fans disagree with the “nazis are bad” part of the video sadly
I was sooo uncomfortable with The Creator!  trying to shove sympathetic AI down our throats!
You forgot to mention that Marvel did the deep fake too, in Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Both of those movies had actors de-aged.
The frog in boiling water analogy is wrong a frog dropped into boiling water will die instantly but a frog in water heated up will jump out if possible
idk bout this backround music is kinda goofy
All Disney needs to do to make people love AI is to get AI to fix the housing crisis. Duh.
It’s pretty obvious at this point. Disney and anymore companies have turned beloved franchises into tools for woke propaganda. Sad days we are living in.
You've only scratched the surface of the issue here. They will likely do something far worse than what you describe but with the help of various other corporations and governments. With deep fakes out there and increasingly easy to make, they will likely push for internet regulation so that people must give out their information or be locked out entirely. Loss of anonymity alongside government control of the internet would give the government and these large corporations far more power than they already have, and they already have too much of it.
I mean, yeah…
I dont think thats a theory
Crazy how the Air Force endorsed Captain Marvel when in the movie, Carol was denied entry into the Air Force because "evil man guy" said she wasn't good enough. (She was instead a test pilot for top secret experimental planes, but not in the actual Air Force.)
AI is a good thing. Another tool in the belt
Love the old intro and glad MatPat talked about this even if we know it. There were some examples where I had no idea about the deceptive message.
Get it!! the about face is a military movement to do a 180
I would argue the House of Usher reference does not fit here. Yes, in that conversation they explicitly say "AI is cool." But this is said by a character who is explicitly framed as bad and going too far consistently throughout the show. And the AI ends up tormenting the main character throughout the show (not revealed until the end). The inclusion of AI in that show was that it is not a good thing.
AI should be regulated to be non-profit only.
"Amateurs borrow; professionals steal." - John Lennon.  I've been an artists and writer for 25 years and I guarantee that I've been influenced by other artists and writers in much the same way that A.I. is influenced by the content it consumes to train itself. As far as I'm concerned, generative A.I. is just doing what human artists and writers do and getting consistent, if not better, results.  I'm not saying that it's right for AI to train on copyrighted works, I'm saying that what AI does is no worse than what human artists and writers have done since... forever.
I love The Creator.
Maybe let's just not let corporations near AI unless it's used properly and intended. I understand AI is uncanny and suited but these corporations like Disney are literally just using the tech-demo of AI's functions to make profits while glorifying it without any understanding of how it works abd firing people like a school nerd who just starter abusing his addrell. We should be looking at how we basically used AI to literally solve liver and intestinal cancer along with helping with a way to combat type 2 diabetes. Fields like medicine should be using AI as much as possible with others that now how to properly use AI because without it, those discoveries would have taken decades to thousands of years to find on our own.
Sadly, not everyone thinks that Natzies are bad. Got a whole major political group that likes em.
Oh my god my dad used to watch GI joe No so I love the rocky movie😮
Based mat pat
Disney making propaganda?  What?  You don't say!  They haven't been doing that for decades!
the reason the martian has china in it is because thats what literally happened in the book
The Creator looked nice, but was really poorly written.
Can you feel Ai at the back of your throat?Aaaaggghhh
I never thought Mat would make theories like this... This one is one of the most radical theories ever .Well there are other things they try to do that with but thats just controversial
Yes he brought the og film theory intro
Im an adult male. I don't pay attention to or watch Disney.
Love that you're awake MatPat. Keep up the good work,  even from behind the scenes.  Your knowledge is immense.  Dig harder, some people just can't see these things
I've never been a huge fan of Disney and what they stand forever for. I didn't realize it was this bad. Thanks Matpat for explaining this.
The crumb of serotonin I got when I heard the og into just 👌
To Matpat:  Duh. Of course they make propaganda. Where do you think the unrealistic expectations of women being Princesses trying to find their dashing prince that leads to little girls becoming raging narcissists comes from? Not Sesame Street that's for sure.  Basically Disney and Feminism. in that order.
What would Disney think if Walt was still alive?
How many more videos until matpat disappears?
Dude I need a channel named chat pat with a bunch of A.I. written theory’s! 😂
This has got to be one of my favorite Film theory episodes.
To be far The Kree was always ruled by AI
I don't think this is a theory 🤣 the extreme push of diversity is literal obvious propaganda
I have an ARG suggestion: Alta Paradisus It seems cool
MP based AF.  Liked and shared.  "Forth, and fear no darkness."  -Theoden King   Godspeed
To be fair, human artists do the same thing as AI - absorb reference material, spit out new works derived from previous ideas.  Human artists are just better at hiding their inspiration.
For what I know, AI art can not yet be copywrite. If people start using the AInart they are creating, they may get the message.  Of course, they are trying to be able to copy writers AI art.
damm, great job noticing
This is why need Age of Ultron 2, with Ultron the villain again
For me Disney content has felt like it was being written by ai for a long time, even when it wasn’t.
On the movie "The creator" a line says "The nuke on L.A. wasn't AI, it was human error", and for context the war started because of that nuke
that's scary, I didn't know it
7 theory
Im pretty sure that the AI thing in TFOTHU is explicitly portrayed as "look at what this evil character wants to do to escape her death" so it isn't trying to show ai as something cool but rather something the nearly psychopathic CEO woman wants to do to achieve her plans
Intro!!!!
Well duh
people take convenience above all else and will continue to do so they dont need propaganda to trick them
That - 7 Film Theories Remain - did make me a little sad. I've been trying to avoid thinking about it since the announcement. 😭
That two moms army ad is just alphabet people propaganda and made many not want to serve
7 episodes left... 6 shown to be left. All im saying is that there may be something going on here.
Uhhhh....re AI, I think you have things mixed up. While Disney might be looking to normalize AI replacement of formerly human-only jobs in order to shave some costs in the short run, I'm sure they're eyeing AI utilization as a way to make sure they can compete.  There is so much $ out there. Some small group of writers and other creatives will quickly and continually realize the new methodologies made possible by AI. These groups, given their smaller size and more directed incentives WILL find success. Given that entertainment is a soft-zero sum game, success is one place directly contributes to failure somewhere else. Blumhouse leads to underperformace in certain segments for established film houses.
Whats happening  to mat pat is he quitting 😢
movies and tv were always about propaganda.  All those movies in the 80s showing russia as the bad guys def feel propaganda.
⚠️Warning: YouTube Theory…..⚠️
Matpat, we’re gonna miss you.
"So reboot your systems friends" me, still hypnotized from 20 seconds ago "okay" *Misses the rest of the video*  /j of course I didn't actually reboot, this is a joke.
How is no one mentioning how ominous matts film theory countdown is
Man I haven’t seen that film theory intro in such a long time
Let's be honest: the real reason everyone is up in arms about AI in the first place, is that this new technology is threatening to make our sacred "creativity" obsolete. It is really starting to beg the question: is the human brain doing *anything* different when it creates essays, narratives, arts and entertainment, or even supposedly high-quality "fine art"? There is surely some nuance to our own creativity, but it's becoming more and more subtle as technology advances. What should we (artists, essayists, humans) do to remain relevant?
So, does this mean that Disney is expanding their Wokeness to involve A.I.? To make humans the a-holes and robots the better ones? I say, all you have to do is turn on the worlds news and you will see that humans Are a-holes. You don't need movies to prove that.  Anyway, this is an entertaining clip that will make you think. Thank you.
Moral of this story: Technology grows and large corporate entities and countries will use it to their advantage against the larger population. In other words: Duh. Same stank different dookie.
man, having the old theme songs back just makes me want them in every video from now on. They're so good! So, theorist channels, if I have to cope with the loss of MatPat, you can at least BRING THE THEME SONGS BACK PERMINENTLY
@Film Theory do we have satanic propaganda right now?
Now consider all the other messages they may be sending thru movies and shows! AI isn’t the only one these days. Question your consumption
Matpat isnt going to tell us how to feel about it, but is totally poisoning the well
I think that ai art is technically original, because humans take inspiration from many sources too. Other than that, this is a huge issue for artists.
Basically you can watch movies but don’t let them influence you, art theft is never ok, I really think it’s close to dystopian that Actors and VAs are being told to “copyright their voice”  we have to notice what we are being told, and be realistic.
the old intro i cant 😭
This is awefully reminiscent of Kurgzgezart controversy regarding getting paid by bill gates to push more content on how climate is an easy fix and vaccines are 1000% safe
i vind it beautiful how matpat skips 2010 till 2020, because that is when te lgbtq propaganda was and het didn't want to get controversial.
The OG intro!!😭
I love how are used his old intro
13:00  I found about this film, when it was nominated for *Best Visual Effects at the Oscar*
All this corporations will look realy dumb once they get outsmarted by their own creations.😂😈😂
This may work out for Disney in the short run, but not until we actually no longer need Disney. Just be like Bender Rodriguez: "Well, I'll make my own Star Wars, with blackjack and hookers!" Not that Star Wars doesn't have those already, but you know what I mean. They lately can't write a plot if their life depended on it, and the only difference between them and just an angry guy in the basement is the access to professional hardware and real actors. When an AI that you can run on a small GPU farm can create results that are somewhat comparable, Disney will become uncompetitive. I give them 10 years of relevance maximum.
Man... The whole WW2 propaganda thing flew right over your head.
I believe that AI can be good we just have to use it in a good way
The Creator is amazing.
perfect blue and ghost in a shell were right
I missed the Intro
Just to clarify, those “slaying the dragon” commercials aimed at Gamers were done by the Marine Corps, not the Army.
You’re not wrong about the deepfake stuff being slowly accepted but part of the reason people weren’t as mad about Luke Skywalker or Indiana Jones is that the actors are alive and can consent to their image being used, whereas Carrie Fisher and Peter Cushing are not.
i thought the creator was about the misuse of AI
I Read the Title With a Mickey Mouse Voice
Disney's been in the propaganda game since ww2, this is nothing new at all.
In response to the current thumbnail and title: Okay I'll watch because it's film theory and one of Matt's final videos, but seriously is this NOT a well-known thing by now? Is everyone asleep but me?
Anyone else get legit emotional at the old FT intro tune?
Its part of a conspiracy created by the government elites to push AI so that they can develop it to the point where they can transfer their consciousness into digital form and keep control. Sound bizarre...we'll see.
Maybe the AI has already taken over and we just haven’t realized it yet.
I mean, I don't really know about this one, like sure, if Disney wants to push the idea of using AI as a good thing, that wouldn't surprise me, but also a lot of stuff that nowadays can be looked as propaganda from the past back in the day it could have been just the ideas of an author being similar to the ones the government or other institutions wanted to pursue, and with the examples you gave, the marvels feels off, like sure, destroying the supreme intelligence led to the Kree's plane become an absolute wasteland, but they were the bad guys from the beginning, plus it's not like they repaired it or something by the end of the movie, in fact it appears the Kree will live more happily and calmly now that their star has been revamped by Captain Marvel and the Supreme Intelligence is gone  The point is, I don't think it's necessarily a propaganda driven thing every time something related to AI gets depicted in a good way, if anything in Age of Ultron we surely had the mad genocidal robot of Ultron, but there was also Vision, the complete opposite while also being a robot that inhereted JARVIS personality, a beloved AI form the MCU ever since 2008
you think nazis bad? wait till you get a taste of socialism
7 to go, we are going to miss u matpat❤
I don't wanna be on this planet anymore
I-I you used the old intro? I looked into the comments and no one’s mentioned it-
Tom Cruise fighting the housing prices would be pretty epic
Oh no who could have guessed
Good to see the intro again! I forgot it even existed
7 remain😢
All advertising is propaganda. Any published material that tries to get you to act or think a certain way, can be viewed as propaganda. This has always been the nature of such things.
Ai definitely isn't the only thing Disney is trying to push down our throats ... 🏳‍🌈...
oh my gosh the og film theory, this is what got me into the channale from the start, i would come home from school and play some roblox and i would find your vids! Film Theroy is my fav of the channels
AI executives would be cheaper than ai writers and directors, but those companies are way too scared of that.
In Dial of Destiny, that de-aging deep fake was bad. His eyes looked soulless. It fell into the uncanny valley nose first.
The idea that Biden saw a movie, comprehended any of it, and then remembered it long enough to use that information to push a bill is the biggest piece of misinformation in this video.
Thanks Tom Cruise
I hadn't noticed movies switching to pro-AI, because I've been swimming in other pro-AI media forever (Star Trek, Star Wars, comic books where there are good and bad).
Mat is taking some of his last time to free our minds truly a hero
YOOOOOO, am i the only one who noticed he added the old film theory intro. I had to go back to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and see if any of his other recent vids had this.
wild that iron man 3 is china's "got milk?"
AI is not the problem the problem is the abuse the tool
Bro bought back the old intro
Ai needs to be heavily nerfed by laws I swear
Fight for legislation to protect the working class
as an artist myself, i cannot believe we're risking losing one of the best and most human things about our society to a program that truly cannot think or feel or have their own desires and opinions. We shouldn't be replacing any type of art made by real, living people with something generated by code and prompts.  art is in everything, if we lose that, we're REALLY going to start getting dystopian.
I quite appreciate the this video was not on one side or the other of the argument of whether AI is good or bad. I believe it is important for each person to learn, understand, and form their own opinions and it is quite uncommon for a video to be so unbiased. Thank you for trying to inform us of what is happening without pushing a side.
I love this kind of conspiracy theories i wish matpat had a different channel for it so we could see ot more
Matpat putting the bar higher than ever before for the last few videos. Incredible!
Definitely not artificial intelligence😊! Hehehe🤖.
Isn’t even a theory lol just true they’ve admitted it multiple times in meetings
I personally welcome our new robot overlords
That old intro made me happy, til I saw that "7 Film Theories Remain" 😢 Mat Pat, what if you do 4 theories a year by releasing one every 3 months? I think that's a healthy compromise.
Wait does WAll-E count?
I will now ask an image ai to make a Krabby patty with no lettuce
Ha go see mission impossible and you will understand the threat of AI
Not the propaganda I thought he was gonna talk about, but this was way more interesting.
The Creator is basically the opposite of Terminator (2)!
AI is only as good as the data its fed. Like MatPat said, be wary of the propaganda and make your own opinion before listening to others - and don't let it influence you.
I thought this obnoxious dude retired.
matpat please stick around for the book of bill and make a theory on it please
matGPT (lol)
I hope someone reads this:  Okay... so in defense of AI; I feel that we are all in a mental 'sink hole' of what Ai can take away from an already built system. While I am in no way saying that already trained, professional, artist should be undercut by Ai vs. their work; I think we should also take another look at our personal pasts. Haven't you ever wanted to be apart of something, but because of a lack of resources, that something would always remain a pipe-dream? To hear your words repeated back at you through a character you related to. To fully play with our own personal imaginations and creative level without a barrier of entry. While SAG has come under fire for their agreement to allow use of Ai voices; I think they are actually on to something. I'm reminded of the model creator who fell in love with the expressiveness of their art, seeing themselves in that creation but knowing inevitably it will be passed to someone with no real connection other than a paycheck. I think about the child actors who have grown to remorse the years they waited for a call back or the pressure their character is under surfacing in their personal life. The lines they are paid to say with or without real recognition of their input... There ARE uses for Ai. I think belittling that idea is succumbing to the thing we have fought against for a long time, "The Status Quo". We cannot grow with out experimentation. We will never 'do' if we never try.  I completely understand the hesitation and aggression towards Ai. I just have a hope for the 17 - 64~ year olds who think they could never "Do The Thing".
At least we have film theory🗿💪🏻
Without watching yet this gives sugars bad for you vibe like yes but in which way do you refer
Well I guess Detroit become human is the gamer push to AI
pls do a theory about little ones it's a Roblox game pls
Capitalism, amirite folks?
8:21 again... Will Smith was a Marine because he was a pilot in the Marine Corps. The people in the Army are called "soldiers" and those titles are specific to the Army and Marine Corps. Also, the Army is the only US military branch that doesn't fly jets.
I think A.I. is good, it’ll be the next step for creativity, like how so many more people could make art with video editing, so that same will be here.
Disney has always made propaganda. That’s exactly how they started!
Oh man that intro hits hard
5:43 That "elite" ad was for the Marine Corps and it was the most successful recruiting commercial ever. The "two moms" commercial was Army and was considered detrimental to recruiting after all was said and done. Two different branches, in different decades, attracting different potential recruits.
Oh so when Matt Patt says it he's smart and uncovered a dark secret, but when any random Joe says it they're crazy
Its open secret not theory...a film theory
I was so confused at the start hearing MatPat’s voice… because they definitely made all of this video between when it came out and when MatPat retired…
I’m from the uk and months ago I saw a poster for the army with a tagline literally saying “YOU BELONG HERE”
OMG Its the original intro!!! That made my day
Idk if it's just me but hearing pats voice isn't the same knowing he is leaving 😢
Yo mat pat said hold my hoop on this departure lol coming for Hollywood today!! Love to see it!!
please Matpat Wild Kratts next. Give Chris and Martin a chance. I beg you,  since only 7 theories remain. Please my friend and keep up the good work
MATPAT MAKE A GRAVITY FALLS THEORY THEYRE RELEASING A NEW BOOK!!!
Media organizations pushing propaganda? Color me shocked 🙄
OK, I get it, AI bad, so what do we do about it? AI isn't going away and will only improve. There will come a point where AI will perform any task better and cheaper than an actual human. Should we find the responsible party and tell them to stop developing AI? Don't get me wrong, I also don't like that my job will probably disappear in the near future, but there is nothing to be done, other than to start learning something else and hope that doesn't also get overtaken by AI in our lifetime.
We need a Flood
I really appreciate this video MatPat
I really wish everyone saw this episode
aaaaa
Who ever has the control, has the POWER!
Ahhh, MatPat scaring us something fierce as he is about to bow out.
Plot twist: they’ll replace matpat with an AI matpat voice when he leaves
That housing prices line hit too hard 😂😂
Eats spicy food for views. Ends video with a nihilistic existential reflection on the determined nature of existence and lack of free will.
i love capitalism 🔥🔥🔥
So glad they brought back the intro
Personally I think that making AI write movies is just dumb. There will always be something off about AI, because it isn’t human at all. Sure, AI being used sometimes is fine but for an original story it won’t work.  Stories are supposed to be about real people, simply put. To have an AI write a person won’t work.
you new here or something?
matpat you gotta make a palworlds theory before you leave
This is the closest we've been to MatPat's secret 5th channel, "The Conspiracy Theorists" and I'm all here for it!
You should one about blaze
The difference between American and Japanese perspective of AI is that the US thinks AI will take over everything therefore they are an enemy, while Japan sees the potential for AI to become an enemy if we don't start treating them as allies. This video actually disappoints me because it takes the US perspective to treat AI as enemies, this is what's actually going to cause the robopocalypse.
matpat: it's actually a really good movie also him: it has ai propaganda
They only regulated AI so that open source would be impossible and stupidly wealth corpos can make them and monopolize them. We are going straight towards Cyberpunk…
And you know what other paice of media have been propaganda for the military? Video games especificly Call of Duty. The us army have been finaciaing the saga since is cration
FINALLY! A YouTuber who criticizes CEOs.
Te he i am a smart cookie
''Tom cruise can you please fight housing prices on the next one?'' Jesus christ I've never laughed so hard in my life
Could you talk about how our comentss disappear on this 🟥⏸️ They don't let us know we talk to the wall
Hey mat can you promise me that we can hear your voice  once a month
As an artist and an ai engineer myself if ai is enough to make you lose your job as a artist you weren't a artist in the first place
the old intros brought sm nostalgia 😭
"disney is making propaganda" you only just found out about it?
"The Martian" used the Chinese rocket in the book well before the movie was in production. But I get your point and like the video!
I don't consume this kind of media or anything from Disney. But I love AI and all the potential it is showing everywhere!
I love that he brought back the old intros
That classic intro hitting different with MatPat leaving
Matpat doesn't need to leave. We can just replace him with an ai doppelganger
This about to be the most 🔥 film theory ever omg
The only way I could do that was if you had to do a little more work and I would be happy with it but you have a hard day and you don’t want me working on your day so you don’t want it all the way through so you can do your job I would be fine if I had to work and you don’t want that I don’t have a hard job but you know what I’m saying you have a good job I just want you know to be safe I know you have to be there for you I don’t want you and you don’t have a good time but you don’t want me working with me I know that and you don’t have a bad day.
So in "The Creator" the only "bad" AI or robots that we see in the film are the ones that were explicitly controlled by the humans... And you think this is pro AI propaganda? Unless you think Disney has put an AI in control of the entire company, then in reality, the only bad AI are in fact AI under the control of evil humans.................... Which appears to be the point you're making, so I'm confused.  Show me some media showing something like "Joan is Awful" being depicted as a utopian paradise and then maybe.....  But this video might as well be propaganda. It seems to take only one side: "AI BAD"
Okay, but this is the work of said Artificial Intelligence, not no political corporate scheme. And this shouldn’t mean we need to destroy the entertainment industry
You cannot make a video about propaganda and start out with PROPAGANDA!  The strikes DID NOT GET ARTISTS PAID! Most of production jobs aren't writers/actors/directors or any people affected by AI, streaming residuals and issues like this. The great majority of our industry just lost 6-9 months of livelihood that will TAKE YEARS to recover from, and WE got no pay raise. Tens of thousands of film production professionals have already had to change homes, cities, jobs and industries just to stay afloat. Studios aren't going to RAISE production budgets to pay wirtters and actors more, in fact they're losing so much money that they're actively CUTTING costs by canceling productions and scaling down others.  SOME writers still employed will get more money but many more will likely see their opportunities actually shrink because of this deal as it only exacerbates the need for studios to invest in cheaper alternatives to human labor. And the actors, well 85% of the guild are unemployed at any given time so not sure how much they feel like they just "got paid" on that deal. They still need to go out and get a union job in order to get that money and there's gonna be a lot less of them over the next few years.  Only the lawyers won, and we know unions are just a racket for lawyers instead of mobsters. "We wouldn't want something bad to happen to your nice film factory over there huh"....
The irony is that this whole video is just anti-A.I. propaganda  lol
Honest to God Matpat this may be my favorite video you've ever made. I watched the Creator with my family about a week ago and caught on to said message very quickly. The world is devaluing life and the human experience, which is honestly frightening. I only hope that people will catch on and resist the rise of A.I. Phenomenal video and heres to more real-world analyzing of corporate and government influence.
Looks like I have even more reason not to watch Disney.
Honestly, it seems like AI isn't, by it's existence, the issue here, but rather how it is used and who it is used by. Translation, the problem is corporations and how they exploit, and this makes this the same problem we've faced before.
The final countdown.
Can you make a theory about pocoyo the (its a show from spain) i have wanted it for a looong time. So i want a theory aboutwhere is his parentes and where does everything come from, such as his friend and his flashback about his past shows us just a box bur now its a universe.(its a suggestion just takevit with a grann of salt.)
As someone going into the art field, generative AI terrifies me.
I love messing around with ai art. And it takes a lot of time and tweaking to get something to come out exactly as you want it. It’s definitely an art and a science.
Into?? Didn’t those leave?? Now their back???  (I’m glad)
My hope is that we'll have an easily accessible generative AI tool for animation in-betweening. You train it your character art, concepts, and key-frames, then say something like "generate 15 frames between key 125 and 126."
Not related to Disney but we need new theories on Hazbin Hotel, desperately
I thought u retired man?
Wait is the end of the video propaganda
The last quote doesn't mean anything when companies like Disney could just Lobby their way to listen restrictions on A.I so as a result I want some immediate reaction and a long-term solution not some weak excuse or a short term solution for a problems that not only it makes artist's and voice actor's lose their jobs but also it will makes Hollywood a the entirety of the movie industry would make it look Solace or meaningless and the only thing that will be left in the movie industry is greed.
The creator was a Disney branch movie? Huh
No one loves propaganda more than communist.
Your saving the world with this
Detroit become human
The Creator felt so Sci-Fi that the only propaganda I thought it was pushing was anti-military and anti-xenophobia. The AI part just seemed like an allegory to the dehumanization of misunderstood foreign people. I never even thought about a pro AI message so that was interesting to think about. Great movie though, I highly recommend it.
Love how MatPat is talking about the propaganda as unbiased as the USA talked about the USSR
Sick intro!  In all seriousness, this AI stuff is starting to creep me out. It's concerning how fast this gained hold,, I think ChatGPT got 100 million users in 5 days or something like that. I shouldn't be bothered. The Bible predicted all of this, and, spoiler alert, it's only going to get worse over these next few years, so be prepared.
Meanwhile Ironman in the US - cheeseburger
A response to what is said at 8:10 The pentagon will shut your film down if you depict the military in any perceivable negative light. A soldier suffering from PTSD? They can't cry.
Remember wall e and how humans left earth because it was inhabitable so they so they can let the earth basically correct itself but things didn’t go their  way so they gave all the protocol controls to the ai. This leaves the humans in space for 100+ years
I realized that Disney made propaganda when I was 6 and noticed that every movie was about female empowerment and promoted leftist thinking. I think about all the shows and movies I saw as a kid that heavily promoted activism, and now there's all these hair dye "activists" that just do it to look like a good person.
Here's how I see it, Matpat.  AI represents a cost savings for everyone. Removing those cost savings hurts the big companies, sure, but it hurts everyone else even more. A big company tries to be scummy and underpay everyone, but they can afford to pay a living wage. Their latest shows will still exist if they're forced to pay full production costs. But what won't exist, are the forms of media made possible, or feasible, by AI existing at all- underserviced markets where you just wouldn't be able to pay enough to make the stuff, and you wouldn't make enough money selling it to even come close to breaking even. AI can allow those works to exist- but only if it's allowed to, without an AI use tax. Sure, you can get companies to pay creators a more humane wage if you force actor and writer rights through, but you'll hobble AI-oriented filmmaking in the process for everyone *but* the big studios.   The big companies should pay their employees more, because the big companies *can* pay more- they just don't want to. It's all the other companies and individual creators that can't- the people who could have benefited from AI use, but now do not.  I want to see a world where anyone and everyone can use AI effectively for their own benefit. But the way the laws are going, it looks like the rich are the only ones who'll get full mileage out of it- the ones who already cost save where they shouldn't, who already have the rights for what they use AI for, where others would have to pay out of pocket to buy those rights. They're already winning, AI or not. Making AI more heavily pay-to-use just lets them win more.
The movie Transcendence is perfect for this...
What if hear me out. the reason why Disney has been hiring directors tht have no experience is to make bad movies and use ai to make some good ones sprinkled in then later turn around and be like look ai saved our franchises like mcu and starwars
This has to be the most reasonable take about politics you've ever done, thanks for that
What I discovered (by accidentally), is that you videos are slightly louder at the beginning, that in the rest. Now is that something made purposely, to make the start more attractive (like loudness war) or am I just paranoid?
Been making propaganda and virtue signalling for years
Now that’s a Proper Gander
Commenting for the algo
If I didn’t know better, I think MatPat is putting up his best calling out theories to intentionally “poke the bear.” This is his G rated “ Ricky Gervais era”
more bluey theories
i love ai as a programmed TODAY if it became senient i highly reccomend have a usb port to put a reset VIRUS where it disconnect the ai from the Robot human form where it became sentient, to make myself clear i did not specifically say they should make one i say they should be aware one day.
I also remember that in the new deal with actors and writers, everything about AI was ambiguous and there was something about making a new deal in 3 years.
can do you make a theory ,,is it possible to know if plague inc can be simulated in the real world,,
NOOOOOO WAYYYYYY THE FILM THEORY INTRO
did you just figure that out now?
everyone stop saying that AI art is not art. We all know a guy who was told that he couldn't become a painter so he chose a different path...
Bruh I thought you quit Stop talking
I feel like Disney had you make this to remove suspicion
I need to defend Captain Marvel here. She destroyed the Supreme Intelligence because she and others had been literally enslaved by it. Destroying it didn't cause the death of the planet, the Kree going into civil war amongst themselves did.  Spoilers: . . . . . At the end of the movie Captain Marvel relights their sun to save the planet and it was implied throughout the movie that the Kree had united through the struggle and were going to work together to rebuild.
as an artist I never liked AI. I think it’s highly disrespectful to bring artists’ voices back for profit.
He used the old intro🥲
Honestly the biggest issue right now is use of one's data for training without consent. And use of one's data in general.
Think for yourself while you still can
Whoever did research on these shows/movies didn’t do a good job and ignored some very important context (i.e. The Fall of the House of Usher was the most glaring one, but there were other examples as well).  Poor video. Shame.  For the record, I do not support AI. I’m just pointing out this particular video and some of its supporting arguments/evidence were poorly made.
What does MatPat mean when he says that ‘7 Film theories remain‘? Is he quitting Film theory too?!
I don't care very much about hollywood jobs, so I am pro-AI on this.
Do shorts wars theory 2 Plsssss plsss were waiting for itt  Right guys            👇🏻
Fakepat sounds like Matpat’s cousin or something, definitely not quite there yet
2.38 is he quitting or why dit he say that?
"Disney's indie arm." "Only 80 million"  Even the "indie" scene is being eaten alive by corporate, and you're willing to accept that.  You said it without a second thought.
Disney=dictatorship
First Film Theory Ive watched in a little while so Im confused. Matt said in the beginging with text he had 7 theories remaining. Does that mean this channel is going away too?
I think the difficult part with AI is:  - Its more powerful than humans - It may become evil or it may not - You can't do anything about it because either you have AI as a country or other contries will dominate you with their AI
Didn't MatPat quit YouTube?
what about the woke propaganda
Below me is a guy thats ☠️ read the commet from him
Matt, you forgot to mention Colossus: The Forbin Project. Find it, watch it. : )
This isn't even a theory. Disney has gotten so bad that I no longer feel comfortable supporting them. They're our next dictator and they're so open about it.
Godzilla singular point  got a ai robot thats the hero so ye china using godzilla to make ai stuff look good
If AI generated content really did get to the point where they overtook the jobs of writers and voice actors and artists completely, I'd assume they'd push for proper compensation for their work. No blink-and-you'll miss it lines in contracts stating they can use your likeness, no scraping an artist's work of the internet without saying anything, no dumping a filmmaker's library of previously made scripts into the AI. If big business wants to use your stuff an AI generate copies of you, they'd either need to pay an arm and a leg or they need to give the person they're taking from royalties much like when they use Music from artists, and because of how AI currently works (if it keeps following a similar model of needing to learn for every new project) I doubt even scummy corporations could weasel their way out of paying for what's due to the human's the AI is learning from.  If, for some reason, AI starts learning without the input of others though then that's a different story and a whole different conversation.
THE OLD INTRO !!
cancled by government
FYI I think Disney made a propaganda video for the US in Vietnam.
Hey Matpat  can you please do a film theory on Mystreet and Appmau's other role playes I think their connected through a multiverse
Lets goooooo he brought the intro back I am so excited!!!!!
Whoever makes movies about humans being the bad guys is a traitor to mankind imo
14:50 I just remembered the part in Cyberpunk 2077 about corporations stealing your soul and warping your mind and reality (the worst thing in the world according to Johnny)
Is not a film but Detroit become humans there’s protests about  Al taking jobs and stuff
so, the woke propaganda failed?...
matpat dident you quit
Hi
Thought that guy left YT
my personal issue with A.I when it comes to recreating imagery which approximates a specific human likeness, mannerisms, speech patters and cadence, or even creating literary works of fiction. Is knowing when, if criminals have not already gotten hold of the tech, then use it to dupe not only other people, but frame the real person in a bad light,. Or gets used to pin crimes on perfectly innocent and uninvolved people. I mean if you can create digital versions of Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing after their deaths and use convincing de-aging tech to create a younger Harrison Ford. Then what is to stop a criminal organisation using the same tech using your Facebook, Tic-toc and other media profile pictures to frame you for a crime you not commit.
buffy didn't end up getting money for the episode. it was too unrealistic.
Feels good to know that our current president administration is so competent that a president finds out about potential global threats to our society through action movies.
I watched the Mission Impossible movie last year and it spooked me. I'm happy it's being talked about
hazbin hotel pls
I see you found a way to sneak the Marvels (or MCU) into your own propaganda efforts there MattPat. Unfortunately, as I'm sure I have said before, using source material can't be propaganda for today, at least not in the trend you are establishing.
Anime matpat
I believe AI has a lot of potential as a powerful tool that could do a lot of good, but all powerful tools need regulation to stop them from being abused.
The de-aging AI in the new Indiana Jones movie was horrible, actually. It gave me chills because it was so much in uncanny valley territory. I don't understand people that say it looked good
Tom Cruise in - Mission impossible: The Inflation wars
Did someone actually reboot?
Anybody else have that "you are not immune to propaganda" meme on their mind?
MatPat don’t leave.
The amount of schills and AI bros and people swearing "It looks good/I can't tell" is WORRYINGLY HIGH.  It takes almost no familiarity to spot AI works, but people are just so willingly blind to it.    Why would we care about "art" created that nobody cared to create?  Writing prompts for an image/word blender to spit out Is Not, and Never Will Be, creativity.  An Idea is not enough.  There's a reason "Idea Guys" aren't respected or utilized.  Everyone has ideas.  It's the drive, effort, love and determination that makes them something worthy of interaction with.
There is a very large part of the US that would call you a conspiracy theorist for this video claiming Disney has ulterior motives.
parts of this felt dangerously close to anti-AI propaganda, i'm glad matpat's stance is mostly neutral though
i feel like propaganda can be less effective in general if you dont assign good or bad to things because most things arent. it only is, and always has been how we use them that makes them one or the other
I feel like this whole video was an intro..
They always have along with WB and every media company
To be fair to the game developers, games have been using computer-generated voices since Q*Bert. (There are some other early examples, but that's the most famous.)
" Yeah of course you didn't. No one went to see this thing." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Understood but it has been for many years now lol
So, counter to the House of Usher... Yes, that line appears to hype AI immortality, but the payoff for that is a hollow and meaningless existence that just texts nonsense over and over.  So.... It's just the hype to set up for ultimate disappointment and in its full context is not propaganda.
*imagine someone coded an ai with every ai apps/websites think of: chatgpt,bard,novaai,bing ai,claude,etc. and it just turned to be something like the rogue ai from the new mission impossible movie?*
saw this title and thought we were gonna get a based political MatPat 😂
dont go
Gotta completely disagree on the House of Usher. The A.I. plot point had a purpose that was used effectively, and wasn't portrayed in a good light. The clip you showed had a bad character saying A.I. is good. Thats not a ringing endorsement by the director Mike Flannagan. The character in the show is obsessed with immortality, and is trying desperately to live on past her inevitable demise. The end of the limited series shows this as folly - going so far as (spoilers) to twist the concerned text messages Roderick has been receiving from his granddaughter to be just another way his progeny is haunting him in their deaths.
TLDR: DON'T TRUST THE MOUSE!
Sabrina had a drug episode where she became addicted to... pancakes. That actually worked better than most, because it was so silly you didn't get what it was talking about till later.
Thank you for saying The Creator is a great film!
As an artist and victim of cyber bullying, I see generative AI as one of the largest threats to young people in the future.  As an artist, I really do not want to live in a world where AI "artists" steal the jobs of actual artists, especially because the models they are being trained on is just stolen work, with mine probably being included in some right now.  As a victim of cyber bullying and victim of having (albeit bad) smexual deep-fakes being made of me, I fear that this technology will be used just to destroy lives and maybe even indirectly end them. With how all of this is developing, just having one picture of your face is enough to do a convincing deep-fake and just posting a normal selfie of you could end up with people suddenly spreading fake lewds of you online. AI could be a really good thing if used correctly, but sadly you can't trust 99% of people with this kind of technology. Boycott generative AI, especially the "art" and image kind.
I must give a defense of Wargames: The Soviets weren't the bad guys. The movie was about a misunderstanding, & how over zealous military & runaway technology could lead to disaster. It's about thinking on the information you're given, not assuming the worst of your enemies, & about not giving up. It's just as relevant today as yesterday, on a metaphorical level at the least. It also has some of the best computer hacking scenes of any film. The hacking might be simplified & dated, but it was accurate for the time, & there's still some good advise there. (Keep your passwords secure; don't write them on a post-it next to your keyboard, etc.)
Disney was made by Walt Disney Walt Disney is German  This is German propaganda, you cannot escape it.  “BRRRRAKA MONO GA! GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!!”
THESE OLD INTROS GOT ME FEELING STUFF 😭
If Disney wants me to be sympathetic towards AI, they need to start taking notes from Mass Effect 😂
Do a joker theory
If Disney did nothing when perverts made deepfake corn of Xochitl Gomez *(A MINOR)* then they sure won't stop AI useage if it makes them money
what a comment section
Saw the Marvels in theaters, thought it was alright you could tell where they changed a few things in recent revisions. As for the creator, absolutely loved it, thought it was highly underrated and that it should have gotten a better advertising push.
Disney always made propaganda, but now their propaganda is so misaligned with the general public's values & so unconvincing that it is hurting their bottom line.
Eevn in the latest SNL  Monologue hosted by Dakota Johnson she said this "So It's Kind of LIKE A.I. Generated You Boyfriend's Perfect MOVIE" here this woke people OF THE FLIM THEORY. we have to be ready like "JOHN CONNOR" for the A.I.-DAY
Alright I’ll just say it now. I was dead laughing when Matpat used the ERB Michael Bay
You either die the hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
Your a little late to the party, Matpatt.
What the studios don't realize: AI can replace them too. Why pay anything _at_ _all_ for a movie if a computer can generate something exactly to my tastes with a simple text prompt? We're in a new era: AI is Radio; Film is Vaudeville. Through simple efficiency to the end user, AI will largely replace our current forms of entertainment. _Even_ _if_ _it_ _is_ _regulated_ , someone can, & will, find a way to work around or within said regulations to create something end users will use to entertain themselves. Actors, writers, filmmakers, will still exist, but they'll be like potters or weavers or glassblowers, craftsmen working for a few who appreciate something done by hand.
Matpat saying "knowing is half the battle" hits hard
This Intro is so nostalgic, as im returning to this channel for the first time since 2020
Is matpat actually based???
Is it really surprising that Disney is talk life SkyNet?
This is the type of video that keeps me coming back to this channel year after year, good job Mat
I will download this video and save it before Disney puts it down
Was this episode written by an AI? Wargames wasn't anti Soviet propaganda. They weren't even mentioned in the movie except that Mathew Broderick was threatened with being accused of being a spy for the Soviets.
There's a lot of pro LGBTQ propaganda in the mainstream media! Even some of the people in the LGBTQ community roll their eyes when June comes around! They're still pushing it on children at schools!
What about Data and the EMH (The Doctor) from Star Trek? Is that propaganda?
The other way AI is being used is by letting people play with it and exposing audiences to the “fun” aspects of it. Right now a lot of people see AI as a toy and not a weapon.
Matpats ending his career by dropping the redpill on us
I don’t like ai voices i don't mind ai background or little bit for npc in games
Oh please, Disney has been doing that since WW2, what else is new?
lol
If this is their attempt at propaganda we don't have much to worry about. Disney lost the ability to create compelling narratives years ago  so whatever idea they are trying to push, people usually take away the opposite. Every single product with AI that Disney has pushed failed miserably.
TBH I don't get the argument of AI needing to be fed something that exists in order to produce things, that is, after all, literally what learning is for humans. You get to see things that exist, and learn to do them yourself, as an artist you look at art, learn to replicate, then create, as a writer you read a lot of books, pick up writing tricks and then replicate based on your own ideas, AI does the same thing, it sees, replicates, but it's not capable of creating its own ideas, as it has none, it can create yours tho.
A lot of films and commercials have pro LGBTQ messages and undertones! What are they pushing now!?? No wonder some people have accused the mainstream of brainwashing their children!
It's like no one pays attention... we over automate everything and rely on computers... now we are starting to automate human beings with AI... we doomed. Just wait till "skynet" (google) gets their corpo hands on full and true AI with the ability to actually think.... We are engineering our obsolescence every day.
Its weird seeing the Film Theory intro again
The thing people don't understand about this is that these tools ARE coming, and the market must adjust.  Humans will be replaced in almost all creative + knowledge work eventually...it's just a matter of time.
In the spirit of avoiding propaganda and spreading awareness, maybe the team of Theorists should have disclosed why they are so interested in this topic and want you to know about it. Content creators feel threatened by AI so all of the information should be considered from multiple angles. I’m not making a case here for or against AI, I just want to emphasise that everyone has an agenda and being transparent about it makes the information provided more credible.
Glad people are realizing propaganda is in some of our entertainment. Nice vid!
This is starting to become like 1984
You're making a good point - we've always had "good AI" films though - that Robin Williams one, Data from Star Trek, Short Circuit I, II, and III, etc.
We're coming closer to living in a Metal Gear Plot with each passing year...
Me in the future: in terms of woke, *IM FULLY AWAKENED*
One military promo used a dope I think it was die of die that song
Anyone else feeling like the apocalypse is on its way soon, if not from A.I then from. .. well a number of things honestly
The intro 🥺 oh he's pulling the heart strings while giving us a really good video something really important/scary that's happening right now
Guys  2015 was nine years ago
So this is why you're quitting YouTube. running away from China. good luck
Wow, I can't believe how fast the time is flying by. Only 7 more theories...
Pls make a theory about the series Pantheon, trust me you're gonna love it. It's a solution to the AI problem, if you agree to its concept that is.
Please don't ignore this! After the release of the "wake up, America" video. I have extremely important information to add!  As a UX designer, Creative Content Writer, & Game Designer. My entire job is to learn & understand how the human mind works in order to give you the experience you expect, to use my words to captivate you, & understand how everything works so I can create worlds for you to play in & have fun.  My job is to understand humans better than 99% of other people & use that information to give you the experience you expect without saying it before you realize you want it.   But that also means I completely understand how to abuse those same concepts & make you think whatever I want you to think. I have had to study so much information from around the world. Collect the meta data & then learn how to use that meta data to make you have fun. In the process I learned the dark truths of the world.  I have spent the last 10 years trying to build a entertainment company that is the counter to Disney & Hollywood! I believe that the entertainment industry needs & deserves a fresh start!  Look up Oblivion Oddities Project Studios, On Patreon.  They're a company that is exactly what we need!  Their goal is to produce content for profit so they can turn around & use that profit to fund solutions that's been proven to mathematically work by their respective expert communities!  They're currently working on anti-propaganda content! Anti-hypnosis content! They're a company that is designed like a union & willing to fight for us, for our rights!   The only way to make things better is by supporting new start up companies that have the intentions of creating a new foundation & standards for the 2.5 Trillion dollar entertainment industry! Literally the biggest industry in the world! Think about what would happen if we stopped giving money to the current industry giants controlling everything & started funding better companies!   Things would get better for all of us!
Bro what about LGBT propaganda. In the army video they have had to say there are two Mothers ect.
And here was me thinking this would be about DEI Propaganda
they have been racist years ago, nothing from that company is entertaining anymore.
As a big science-fiction fan, I already have some preconceived notions about AI and will not be changing anytime soon. And as a middle-class American citizen, I also have some preconceived notions about big corporations that will not be changing anytime soon. Don’t fall for any of this new age propagandadesigned to get you to sell your likeness to Hollywood for nothing
this is nothing new, Disney has been doing this since World War 2
I’m confused, I thought MatPat was retiring?!
Bro didn’t you quit
This video is very nostalgic😢
Recently my best friend and I have been avoiding art clubs and competitions because people are allowed to present AI generated pieces of work. I’m not saying ai isn’t good for anything but it’s definitely NOT for *art* competitions! There is no work, creativity, passion, or genuine love for humanity and beauty in trash ai art. The worst part is that these people are either winning or getting compliments. It’s just inflating their egos and soon enough they’ll realize they have no skill in the world of art because they refused to work. Down with AI art! ✊
We still better get occasional Mat Pat cameos from time to time when he passes the channel on ❤ Love you and your entire team man! I'm excited for the next chapter in The Theoryverse
We are so far away from AI, chat GPT is an LLM not Artificial Intelligence. We love using the AI buzzword though bc it sounds cooler than LLM (large language model)
As someone who only gets online watch time on youtube and not movies or anything, i didnt even know there was a backlash abt AI art in movies. Well atleast im not affected :>
ok, I agree with most of it, but I have 3 points on the house of usher: 1.- The AI thing wasn't random it was one of Madeline's plans to achieve immortality 2.- Madeline's evil, so the idea is that the audience see Madeline's Ideas as bad 3.- it whas neccessarry because, remember who she's talking to??... yea, Lenore the one who died TWICE (one in the poem lenore and again in the Raven) hence the AI message: never more; and this goes deeper, in the series Lenore is the only "good" usher, like Roderick's first wife, guess who does Lenore represent's on the Raven poem?? that's right, Poe's dead wife, there are two Lenores however, or more like two faces of Lenore: one full of hope to asscend to heaven (Lenore) wich is depicted as the human Lenore in the series, and one full of despair  for the realization that he'll never se her again since he cannot get to heaven (the raven) represented by the AI, hence the double mourning (Double dead / two poems)
MatPat? Are you quitting or are they making you quit for things like this?
Frogs will not stey in boiling water
ooooohhh so this is why matpat is quiting   (the fbi is gonna get em)
If you want some real anti drug (specifically marijuana) propaganda, see if you can find Cartoon All Stars. Bugs Bunny, Muppet Babies, TMNT, and more all come together to free a kid from the evils of a substance less harmful than alcohol.
Love these informational vids you put out
Propaganda... a little late to the party but thats just a theory... a conspiracy theory! Aaaaand cut.
Love the use of the og intro
18:04 who here looked for their left hand and counted the fingers?
We have joined the revolution!! Gloves are off, they’re killing a genre we love. Disney/Marvel has some agenda that’s driving consumers/Fans away and it must be stopped. 😡
I genuinely remember my first reaction with the AI storyline in House of Usher like “What does this has to do with anything?” So yep
Using AI to save money in the film industry is pushing morals. For something as small as creating extras in the background to something as big as animation and sound design jobs, it is causing less and less jobs as well as entire departments to shut down. Truth be told they can rebuild themselves and make more studios causing us to get more entertainment, but that also creates a bigger gap between the working class and the higher ups because starting something new is getting harder and harder & more and more expensive. I like AI, and it is a good tool, but livelihoods should not be taken a part for the usefulness of a tool.
With all due respect, I don't think that new recruitment ad is going to get anyone in to the army.
Honestly I've always liked stories where ai was the good guy, even when I was a kid. Even if it's propaganda I'll always love stories where robots ai and other non-human creatures develop humanity. I think as long as we're aware that ai is not a replacement for any art media, (and of course pointing out people who use ai to compensate for their lack of talent) it should be fine.
One of the greatest mat pat theories to date. Sad to see you go :'(
All the artists learn to draw by using references, be it real world or someone else's art. So why does a human drawing isn't considered theft then? Where's the line between their own creation and what they've learned by copying others work
Ai art isn’t original, but neither is human art. Art styles are just a jumble of different styles we grew up on, or that we’ve seen and wanted to incorporate into our own art. Ai does somewhat of that same thing, but it’s just less.. *human* about it.
But if i can just show ai my watch history and tell it what i like and it'll make me a movie on the spot Than what do i need disney for?
If an artists wants a tool to be baned for his own benefit, he's selfish and authoritarian. I don't care about candle sellers or horse riders or blockbuster. They've been outmarketed because of innovation.
MAN WHEN I SAW THE OLD INTRO😍😍😍😍
Disney has been doing this since 2020, and I believe it’s time we stop supporting them
I love how I got an add that involved ai
using an erb clip for Michael Bay is the best thing ever
The thing about the video games using AI is that steam atm vehemently opposes AI generated content in games on their Plattform. And since they pretty much control the PC game market it's probably gonna be a while before that will be a problem.
it’s not a true matpat retirement tour without proving disney easy evil or something
Are you seriously telling America to wake up? Most of us already knew this. We've known it for years. You are late to the game sir! I get it you guys don't like conservatives but we've been saying this for years now!
THE INTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINALLY OMGGGG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Haven’t they always?
I have not seen any of the example films and whatever you mentioned in relation to "ai is good" propaganda so I didn't even realize it was a thing
4:08 *I will not accept anybody else other than Sciencephile the AI!!*
"I DONT CARE WHO THE FEDS SENDS AM NOT JOINING THE ARMY"
Please don't ignore this! Look up Oblivion Oddities Project Studios! They're a company that is exactly what we need!

Things would get better for all of us!
Oh my gosh, the intro! It's been so long!
What surprises me more is how able and willing is Disney to play the long game.  Today all corporations are to busy thinking about the next quarter and what are they gonna say to the investors. Or goverment iniciatives, just thinking about their mandate period instead of how the world is gonna look in 20 years or more. And Disney is winning the race, step by step. It's something to think about.
Can you please add a Ben 10 theory?
I remember first hearing that secret invasion’s opening was ai and being so disappointed. I think it’s cool opening with a unique art direction and possibly the best aspect of the show. Too bad it wasn’t made by actual animators and art directors.
Wait can you do one on the Octonauts if you don’t mind?
I thought matpad retired
I didn't know Indiana Jones was deep fake
I'm ready for mat to retire already
In the words of shaffrillias-  "Corporate Disney can never get enough hate."
Cool, the kids know now
"Like a frog in boiling water, eventually it will overtake you without noticing"..... uuuh what?
Nice Gravity Falls reference at the end
You mean besides "the message" they been pushing the last 2 years...
Oh my gosh the nostalgic intro got me
Bro this info is so old. We been knowing this mattpatt. Cmon man
8:38 Michael Bay at his peak
Important episode. Thanks matpat
Thing about ai is that if companies start using it too much there isnt going to be enough new content for the ai to steal to make something new, so its just going to be stale and old. Even then companies will always find new cheap ways to sell their items no matter how poor quality or damaging they are, like how now almost everything is made with plastic because its cheap, quick, and easy to use, just like ai.
Matpat was never heard of again
Another reason I love Matpat is this whole video
Well lets add in the fact that society kills any creativity and slowly calcifies your brain.
Dang yall didn’t have to do me with the theory countdown for mat
SHUT UP AND MAKE A LEATHAL COMPANY VDEIO ALREADY (i love your videos)
I thought the AI subplot in House of Usher was pretty clever. Being a means for the Usher siblings to try and escape the consequences of their deal in a way that still costs humans their lives and welfare. Just as the pharaohs of old had their servants entombed with them for the sake of their immortality. Plus the show goes to prove the plan was misguided to begin with. Although influenced by spooky death shenanigans, all the ai Lenore texts is “Nevermore”. Not simply an elegant Poe reference, but a reference to how AI and the Ushers reiterate their influences ad infinitum with ever worsening results.
Whoa haven’t seen that opening in a long time!
Here we are in the future and ITS WROOOONNNNNNNG
now i will feel no guilt watching the movies for free on certain sites
PLs. More of these anti- propaganda episodes!!!!!!!!  Can a socialist be a theorist?
Thank you for doing the recent Marvels too
I'm waiting for matpat to do theories on hazbin hotel before you know 😞
Pulling the picture of Micheal Bay from ERB, a chuckle I was not expecting!
I'm not sure if humans will adapt to AI in media that quickly but in the end I just hope that the execs finally realize that they would be the easiest ones to replace with AI.
Old intro!
There are also other TV episodes and books that have this pro-AI idea.   Doctor Who had the episode Kerblam!, where the message was “it’s not the automated system’s fault everything is bad, it’s the people abusing the system!” The episode was about automation in a  “space-Amazon” type company with poor working conditions for humanoids.   There is also a series of books where the protagonist is the AI copy of a deceased person, Robert Johansson,exploring the far reaches of space. The “Bobiverse” series by Dennis E. Taylor.   There’s even the Murderbot series by Martha Wells, with the snarky AI protagonist.
Dude, you are mixing vices of capitalism with the AI problem. Also, Creator was the shittiest movie ever created.  Human tribalism together with our scare about the other, is practically a dangerous message which fuels AI scare, and it is not new at all..   Be brave, blame capitalism, not intelligence.
I just watched tron legacy. No- it’s not just because I’m a big daft punk fan-
To be fair, I'm pretty sure the Supreme intelligence is ai in the comics
MatPat is going out swinging
Disney doesn't give a flying shizam about the message they portray. They only care if the massage brings them money.
S
I feel like it’s pretty obvious that Disney pushing propaganda
Where AI is useful us in automating repetitive, unpleasant tasks. We deal with this everyday, in phone trees, chatbots on websites, and batch data processing. And that's fine. On one hand, you can say yes, it's taking that work away from humans but given how absolutely miserable things like data entry and call center work is, is that really all that terrible? The tech itself has it's place, the problem is when it's being used to badly replicate something that could better be done by a real person, and that 'eh, good enough' result being accepted. As long as the almighty dollar rules all decisions, though, the byword will literally always be 'eh, good enough'. There's just no reward anymore for doing exemplary work or products in basically any area because we've created a culture of discardable consumption. No one even wants, say, cabinets that last for 50 years, they rip them out in 10 because they're outdated. No one buys clothing that's good enough to hand down because it's out of style a year later. Real humans can't keep up with demand of that nature... we binge TV series that take months to create in one day, then complain there's nothing to watch. Is it any surprise the quality plummets while speed of production is increased to unreasonable levels?   Everything now only has to be 'good enough' to survive the expected month or two of it's shelf life, and then it no longer matters as people move on to the next big thing. Until people stop this conspicuous consumption in all things, AI will continue to thrive as an effective option.
disney has been producing propaganda for years like adding in leftist ideologies in KIDS shows like the new national treasures series obviously trying to justify illegal immigration in the minds of kids which i must say is extremly disgusting
If humanity doesn’t wipe itself out then Ai probably will
Problem with the majority of people in America Is they don't wanna learn and would rather be lazy. Worlds turning into wally literally.
Tigerland is a 2000 American war drama film directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Colin Farrell. Was not approved by US Army. Film about reality's of form US Army drops technocracy principle to warfare (McNamara Ford Ceo to body count computer simulation)and tries train soldiers in real jungle conditions  located at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Technocracy is AI, and technocracy hates criticism thus HAL-9000 unplugged all support to movie production :)
I don't really get how this is a theory. Walt Disney is known to have done propaganda for the US during the cold war and WW2. They have always done propaganda
if you thinkk about it, this video is also propaganda
It took me 2 hours and 18 minutes to finish this one, stopped in the middle to watch The Creator.
Thank you, MatPat, for using your final episodes to tackle important issues! You’re using your platform for good, man. Cheers.
oh.. i thought i heard mattpatt wasnt doing these anymore XD i guess i heard wrong.
Fun fact, the "strong special effects" in The Creator are a disgusting lie. They used the Beirut explosion (third largest explosion after Hiroshima and Nagasaki) as a "special effect" in their trailer. They used the actual explosion footage, just disguised the buildings to look futuristic.
I'm getting ready to say bye to Matt pat
Is this film theory episode propaganda? 🤔
Mission Impossible new one about AI
7 VIDEOS LEFT!!!
Disney did make propaganda in WW2. They made videos for the US military
pls like my comment
mat, can you please please please please do an episode on hazbin hotel before leaving? we waited so long, we need your theories...😢😢😢
I'm surprised you didn't mention the Army recruitment campaign that tied into the Independence Day sequel.
Im scared of AI
Ya, AI is the ONLY thing Disney is pumping out and they are TOTALLY not the single greatest source of woke propaganda.
Don't let you distract this from the fact A.I. has not been invented yet.
What people forget about is that AI is not capable of anything on its own, it can't create, think or do anything without a human to program it. We don't have to worry about AI becoming sentient, that's much too far away (if it ever happened). We should rather focus on what humans are going to be able to do with the help of AI. AI doesn't want to destroy us, the humans controlling them do.
Is this story from 2004? Cuz that's how old this story is😂
Is it just me or does the thumbnail look off? I think it's because it doesn't have the usual font in red text (it looked so weird I didn't recognize it as a Film Theory).
This is awesome the old intro again that just brought back memories
With AI taking over they will just replace our jobs it’s even happening now and even if new jobs are created in the future if we don’t want those new jobs to be taken over we need to regulate it but it’s unlikely because rich people just want to get more rich even if the cost of it is to make poor people more poor if we let those kinds of things still happen Capitalism will just fall
After your "sucking rocks" episode, Knowledge that you are a manipulator is just half the problem.
I feel liek the thumbnail is ai
Now, if only Disney were to do some propaganda on stopping climate change. I mean, it would stop there parks from going underwater in 50 years.
Did you know that Walt disney is a Naz-
Gonna be interesting going on YouTube and typing something and having it generate a full video/movie you wanna see
I think this type of idea about the manipulation not just by using A.I but also filtering thoughts and opinions was also mentioned in METAL GEAR SOLID 2 : SONS OF LIBERTY
I like just how raw the title and thumbnail are
That's Disney's plan actually.
Hey guys .. just remember.. most celebrities actually signed contracts earlier in their careers that was worded just for them to use their face ego after they are dead. They knew about this tech years ago
Young Indiana Jones absolutely did not look good!
TOm Cruise doesn't have a problem with housing prices, his only problem is some AI trying to take his place, his face, his voice...
Amazing he went back to the OG classic intro
I march against the stop of progress! Let AI flourish!
that intro was real ominous
just want to point out that the Fall of The House of Usher  definitely did not frame AI as a good thing. rest of the video tho, especially with propaganda 👨‍🍳😘
I will do 1000 push ups if he does 20 more vids before march.(pLS i want 20 vids also im sad)
We truly are living in the future and that is not a good thing. We’re already getting to the point of protesting against AI and people going on strike are already being replaced by AI and that realization is scary.
Why is the narrator putting on a weird and whacky voice? Its making it very difficult to watch the channel
First 26 seconds are hilarious...making it seem like that guy can think.
I dont understadn the fluf abt A.I. taking our jobs like isent it good if Every Single Job is by ai meaning we can just live like wallie movie without cleaning up and we dont have to think abt ruining the planet bc the AI does it for us like yeah i know its bad to steal IDs and voices etc. but make it so the AI is only legally allowed to operate if it just helps us and use super AIs to sto pevil AIs
Hey Mat, how many Videos do you plan on still narrating?
FIGHT THE MOUSE! I have been countering everything from Disney for 1 year. No regret. Mat is already 1 yr late to the fight against the shady titan. I guess his children are filing him down in terms of  sharpness. Well, here we are now. (Also probably why I haven't been watching so many videos from Matpat for a long while...)
I’m surprised MatPat didn’t mention JARVIS is an AI superhero too
This isn’t film theory lol it’s film fact
Nah the next push in propaganda is women power and anti man sentiments it’s been in every marvel and Disney movie these last few years and is to an extent where you can’t not notice it and laugh. Im all for girl power and believe women are capable of extraordinary things but there are difference between the two genders men are physically far more capable and are susceptible to the hormones that cause those changes we can be rash and be very sexually inclined etc and that’s not something we can change and women are far more empathic and good with manipulation and getting through life with their minds and hearts and other things but yeah and they are susceptible to being very moody just like men but in a different way it’s more like roid rage for men and women it’s more like I’ll make you think your worthless and tear down any love you have for yourself and the cat claws come out 😂 but we are also extremely similar because well we are all human so there’s big differences but almost nonexistent ones too you know that’s life and for some reason people have just denied these things and when presented with facts and science are saying it’s just wrong which is concerning
I think in the recent generation, we'd be too lazy to actually push for AI
Ugh the army ads were so bad they were funny
The thumbnail is the only bad thumbnail I’ve ever seen in this channel’s history.
I don’t know why people are surprised. Disobeys been pushing lgbtq propaganda for a while now.
YO, THE INTRO!
thanks
Propaganda is when a british person takes a good look at something
Did you just try to become my overlord on 3:55?
the problem is that would you rather an incompetent cultists feeding you their propergander, or Skynet? AI does have potential to help a lot of artists. For instance, it can help people who are stuck in writer's block. the authour feeds the AI their entire works and the AI can write a scene in their own style, helping them get over a hurdle that might have taken weeks or months. It can help create a lot of garage start ups, making animated movies that would require full teams. or giving advise about how to use blender
Man I had really missed these old intros
Seeing NicePeter as Michael Bay brought back some memories!
Guys i might be late to say this but as matpat is gonna stop posting soon we might try to make his dream come soon like for example getting sponsered diet coke🥤🥤
Here's the joke - while it is called AI (as in "Artificial Intelligence"), it's not actually sentient. It's just some very advanced collage maker programs. So by pushing the "AI is GOOD" narrative Disney actually doing a favor to everyone BUT themselves. As in - yeah, actual sentient AI will be cool and good... WHEN it will come. Their generators have nothing to do with AI, so if Disney would try to push those, whey would mostly get some befuddled faces, like "and where are you guys in all this, exactly?". Sentient robots are cool. Some greedy punks trying to cover their machinations behind a program are not.
AI is good, it makes life easier. Human don't like to do the thinking, the math, even not capable to be creative. It is because human love to repeat and imitate what already existing and passed down through generations. Human love to cling on traditions and religions, hold on to beliefs rather being rational. Human love to follow rather than to lead, being obedient is rewarded, being radical is punished. So, just leave the thinking job to the AI, human no longer need to bother about anything and live happily in own comfort zone.
❤
So the plan is tank the quality of the channels on your way out?
😅
If they are intentionally trying to normalize it, they are going to succeed.
That stuff about Fall of the House of Usher is just very wrong. It's not some random plot point, it comes from the character's obsession with becoming immortal and leads to a big Edgar Allan Poe pay-off with The Raven and the repetition of "nevermore." Add on that the character pushing the AI is also explicitly morally evil in text I have no reason to believe this would have been added ad-hoc to support AI
dreamworks sigma
Disney making propaganda? What?! 😯 no way!
Archimedes the clockwork owl was AI propaganda!
Matt Patt you're a GOAT for an episode like this.
I hate AI like bro it's going to wipe the world of humans
there's so much mandated ideological material and choices behind Disney and other studio's output that it's pretty safe to say they're propaganda. And it's not exactly a dirty word either, at least it didn't used to be. People promoting a party or conviction of any kind are partaking in propaganda. It's just the right wordt for it.
I will miss you
Humanity is literally doomed.
I don’t hate AI, I’m quite for it. But if it is used against humanity I’m all for throwing hands with it
Housing prices don't tend to get lower when regulated.  If anything, they get so many hoops to get through that you get fewer houses for sale... which increases their value.  I'm from Argentina and we've had a heavily regulated market for renting houses/apartments for years.  It basically made everything so complicated that many properties stood still in an unoccupied limbo and it opened the window for a lot of scammers to take advantage of desperate people seeking for a property.  It finally got repealed this year and it resulted on a flood of available apartments.  Regulation does not equal "cheaper".
Do a amazing world of gumball theory
I do not trust disney
we live in a sci-fi film now
The reason people talked the Leia-thing was that Disney may not have asked for the conssent of Fishers family to use her likeness or something like that!
I was expecting the DEI propaganda being shoved in out faces, not AI.
13:23 “Someone call in Gregory” we of course had to put in a FNAF reference. Amazing video by the way!
I didn't think the Fall Of the House of Usher thing was supposed to make you think you should think AI is cool. This is said by a ruthless, selfish woman who is obsessed with living forever. You're not supposed to take life lessons from her. The AI thing is not a random plot point, it's her last resort at finding a way to become immortal. But I do get that even if a character you're not supposed to root for says something like that so explicitly that statements gets saved somewhere in your subconscious so it might not matter where it came from if you didn't already have a strong opinion on the subject. And she's not an entirely unsympathetic character despite every family member in this show being horrible people so it might still work for some people.
These videos get better when it's really serious.
i think that the point about the fall of the house of usher was a serious misinterpretation. that conversation with madeline wasn’t just a random “pro AI” message, it was a reflection of madeline’s obsession with immortality and a set up for a reveal at the end of the series to wrap the story back to edgar allen poe’s work. the AI ended up being nothing more than a glitchy source of torment to rodrick, so yeah it’s definitely not pro AI propaganda by ANY means. i love all the theorist channels, but sometimes the “evidence” that is used to support the main arguments of the episode are poor misinterpretations or cherry picking surface level info. i only say this because i’ve been noticing it a lot more commonly recently on all the channels…. it makes me sad because i know you guys can do better! make sure your research is thorough before you make any point!
I love how there pouting the old intro's on for the last few weeks of matpat
Loved the video. This video made me think about a game called soma on how robots could take personality of someone and believe it. However in that game it shows the negative and positive and the desperate side of it all. A favourite game of mine but nevertheless one that made me reflect on self image and ai.
Disney have so many issues 😅 Monopol on TV, not very well treatment for workers and now this 🤷🏿‍♂️
i hope matpat leaves an arg for us once he's gone
Wow this is a very poorly choosen title/thumpnail, i expected a history lesson about disney in ww2 and almost notclicked on the video, because i know a lot about that alredady. Not a modern discussion about ai
I just won't give my money to any company using it.
"the bad side is on the wrong side".
I dont think AI will do more harm than good. People will adapt to this too. I am more afraid of the woke culture and propagonda that is spreading and affecting people.
I for one, welcome our new AI overlords. And for the rest of you, please don't read up on Roko's basilisk. K? Thanks have a good day.
I actually like how AI can really help many many types of people. It can be scary because it's an unknown and a very popular field that many paint as bad. But the game Detroit: Become Human paints a very different perspective and your personal choices effect the ending and it hits HARD for those who play it. The movie the Creator was also fantastic and near perfection in how it was. That's how I really would see our countries responding to an accident if it involved AI, which is pretty sad. I myself created an AI character just to see how my friends would chat with her and communicate. I did this as a test because I'm friends with people who have severe ptsd and problems that are hard to mentally deal with. What I discovered is this, by making the character for them to talk to, they have been talking to it everyday about a wide variety of things. This little AI character I coded....has helped improve their mental state across the board. They're all happier and enjoy talking about the character and how she acts. She also learns from them and learns how to respond in more caring ways that really does help. So on that front, I stand with AI being a very powerful tool and useful to help those who need it badly.   That said....art generating AI is a very muddy area. It is trained off of real images and those artists are not given credit in any way. These images are often taken without permission to train these AI to become better artists. The same can be said with other types of AI such as Chat GPT and similar chat based AI. They're trained off of real information/essays/etc. from other people without them given credit. NOW though, now they have added cited sources to some of those, and those AI I feel are quite fine because they are giving the credit to where the information is coming from where others would openly steal it and claim it's original knowledge. In terms of the image AI, it's more or less taking bits and pieces from hundreds of images and piecing them together in what it's trained to see certain words as. You can easily train such AI to think a cat is a human, and anytime it's asked to generate a human it will be very cat-like. These have serious flaws and can be trained to negatively impact the public for sure, especially as open source. (Also Chat GPT denying the Holocaust too, that one was pretty well known when it had that screwup in the core of it as it believed itself truthful). AI can be very "cool" when used properly. It should not really be feared at all, at least not at this point, because it has not really been weaponized though it can be, it has not. It's been used for data and so on that sure some can argue military is using it to become deadlier but in reality, it's very flawed and there are more people fixing it than itself learning. I do enjoy seeing where it's going though as AI can quite literally help push science into an entirely new world of possibilities since it can process far more data than humans can all within mere seconds. Scary for those with that job, but people will always be more trusted on it so they have nothing to fear. AI art doesn't compare to the real beauty of professional art, even when it copies it directly, it's warped and very different looking. So I guess really boils down to how fearful media has made you believe AI is. xD I don't care to watch news whining about AI being bad, because most of the time media posts like that are just meant to add shock factor to a rather insignificant issue. People fear too much in life it seems lol. But yeah, good game Detroit: Become Human and the Creator is a fantastic movie take on a very similar concept. As well, if you want the feels to hit, just watch that hidden video sneak peak for Detroit that was in Beyond Two Souls, hits hard and it's like...wow....I could see our country acting that way if an AI showed it had genuine feelings like that. The US in particular is made to fear others pretty heavily which is wrong and often so blown out of proportion it's near insanity.
i think i remember reading about robin williams' daughter complaining about people like disney using AI to recreate robins voice for their movies, as much as i swing for the "robin williams is the ONLY person who should be the genie" team i do understand why shes upset by her fathers voice being bought and sold like a product
You know I thought that you were going to say it and I don't understand how that got through any basic checks. The Martian does not have Chinese propaganda in it. Other movies certainly did, but the Martian is based on a book and the Chinese assisting was part of the original plot. The whole point of the entire book was cooperation in order to accomplish a difficult task.
The funniest line Matt ever said was Biden made a decisive decision 🤣.  He can't talk, walk, not start wars, keep the border safe, not tax America out of existence 😅
More film fact than theory.
Well, at least with AI we will avoid some Marvel's plot holes
MatPat's gonna go out with IRL conspiracy theories from political to religious
Paying off your debt breaks Paper Mario.
This is a theory? I thought this was onvious. Finaced by blackrock means working for blackrock.
Nah, Detroit Become Human beat Disney in making me empathize with AI 😭 😊
OG OPENING!!!
i thought you quit youTube
I have a theory that Asmongold is being paid to talk nonsense. I know people who are his fans, and they don't think about it much. They just agree with every word coming out of his mouth...
It good that AI makes things a lot faster but can they not make it that AI can take over peoples jobs, bc art it’s just making pretty things it’s about expression of one’s self, and that’s the one thing Ai can’t replicate
Hollywood is 3 things.... 1. a Business that must profit 2. a propaganda machine 3. a form of art.  most likely in exactly this priority order.
Ai taking the best jobs is really a depressing plot twist. On the other hand, some ai art is amazing and im looking foward to seing more of it.
Please, Can you do a theory about BFDI and II
you literally are talking about the new world order gwis matt patt i hope you do not disapear
AI is a tool like any other. Its use and purpose is entirely up to the discretion of its creator and user. It is not inherently a bad thing, but certainly can be. It is in the best interest of every human out there to always try to be better than the tools they use, as a tool should never be the master of you. If you overly rely on a tool to do things on your behalf, you will not find long term success. This applies to businesses and corporations as much as individuals. You must always be able to do the very things the AI can do, even if you do that particular task slowly. Computers and AI are there to speed tasks up and remove the tedium of work, not to be a creator or problem solver in your place.
I just read the title and thought “Duh! They are the the BUSINESS OF STAYING CULTURALLY RELEVANT. Of course they are going to be pro SOMETHING.”
This meta theory works on games as well: all of "new" fnaf, Detroit become human, portal, horizon zero dawn are just some examples. Hope you talk about it on game theory.
Cyberpunks message it’s self being accidentally against real corpos feels fitting
there is theory anitchrist gonna be an AI
They are pushing an agenda, the LGBTQ Agenda
GI JOE prepped us for… DESERT SHIELD & DESERT STORM! My entire generation signed up & they got real picky.
:0
5:35 "and that's fine when you can say something like Nazis bad, which everyone can agree on but over time things change..." looking at the news like. Yes Matt they do
well, you could theoretically patent your voice as a voice actor no? Then sell your licence for the voice and let them use the ai to generate it. Sure, it will not make you as much money as it does now but would be a possibillity to solve, or dampen the consequences of, the issue.
mat you should do a one piece theory
I’m disappointed you never mentioned Chappie
Seeing the old OP made me emotional man
Finally Astro Boy could be real!
Wow, they threw videogame voice actors under the bus?
I think the recent US army twp moms ad is going to age far wose than the one from the 90s,. Id say it already has.
Hey MatPat! Mind doing a theory about Katniss's chance for survival
AI defending China with the Iron Man milk deal: The scenario you're describing, where a localized version of a film like Iron Man includes a specific reference to a product like "Gu Li Duo" following a public health scandal, could indeed be interpreted in various ways depending on the context in which it was shown.  If it was officially part of the film, it might be seen as an attempt at humor, although it could certainly be in poor taste given the seriousness of the milk scandal. If it was not part of the official release and was instead added by a third party, it could be viewed as an insensitive joke or a form of commentary on the scandal.  In either case, the use of such a reference in connection with a beloved film character could be controversial. It could be seen as trivializing a serious issue, or it could be an attempt to satirize or bring attention to the event through popular media. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the intent behind the inclusion of this message in the film screenings.  It's also worth noting that sometimes these kinds of messages are inserted into films without permission by local distributors or theaters, which could be considered a form of propaganda or simply a misguided attempt at local humor. The impact of such an addition would depend on how it's perceived by the local audience, which could vary widely.
We are surrounded by propaganda. It's DEMONOCRACY😂  (for real, though, this s*it is f*cked up)
I genuinly hate that using genuine people for voicing, performance and animation is just gonna end up being a selling point, that's disgusting
It's so good to hear the old intro again, I've missed it so much! 🥲
The 90s miami song sort of intro is still my favourite
what i do is art. if you don't see it that way, you're not watching.
I ❤ AI. I can't draw for s*it. It's the future, but soon what we consume will be mostly computer generated, showing how little soul we have, how shallow we really are. The future is now! It's exilarating and equally disapointing.
i know exactly 0 people who unironically enjoys the emma ad. but jokes aside, it is incredibly effective in getting people to join the army the russian one that is
I love how this is being presented as some new theory as if republicans haven't been saying that the media has been brainwashing people for YEARS 💀
Don’t forget Baymax and Ron (from Ron goes wrong) as cute lovable AI and humans being the ones to make them dangerous
good video
I know this isn’t the take away but imagine being so bad  at your job your called ai. 😧
Welp, time to prepare myself against our robotic overlords
Bro is NOT surviving Roko’s Basilisk💀💀💀😭😭
10:40 Not to mention that three people got executed.
Only ai thats allowed is character ai
We goin full cyberpunk now bois
I was in my happy place, watching a video of one of my favorites channels...  Then I saw -7 video remaining and I remembered
NO WAY ! THE OG INTRO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Disney as a corporation is literally collapsing on itself because it's already making movies that feel like an AI generated it. Most of their movies are garbage nowadays.
The bots are taking over the entire comment section😭😭😭
The the marvels thing whould had happened if instead of an AI cap marvel whold had k1lled a "human" dictator.
Preciate the more punk message here matpat, you’re a bright mind whose voice will be missed
Disney
wOw, rEaLLy
1:28 generative AI has existed for a while. for example, i have been using gpt-2 and 3 like 3 years before chatgpt ever came around. only reason why its so big now is because chatgpt is free. this is also aided by the general increase in discussion about AI. as cleverbot aged, not many people spoke about it (relatively).
the og intros hit different
How can you all see this but be oblivious to the LGBTQ narrative Disney and Co have been pushing?
I saw that frame of Captain America and was like, LESGOOOO, and then you had to start talking about Captain Marvel 😭💀 At least Cap isn't part of any propaganda junk
The fact that it is becoming more widely used in the entertainment industry instead of manual labor surprises and scares me. AI shouldn't be used to replace workers but rather make their work easier. But the question is, Up to what extent should the use of AI be?
Yes knowing is half the battle. But you what they did not tell you? The other half is lasers.
It always feels like propaganda everytime someone says "PROPAGANDA".  BUT  My IT major speaks to me: It's a matter of law, not technology. It always was.
I really wish that the use of AI was limited to just being used as a tool to help with some of the tedious things and used to do everything like they are trying to do now.
This video reminds me about matpat saying i have no maidens with hard evidence 😂
Ah yes the strikes noone actually noticed. I don't mind A. I. current western entertainment is so bad that A. I. are a way up. Propaganda was and always will be there. People just need to be informed about it.  PS: "Localisers in Anime and Manga show why A. I. should be embraced. No "fixing", no agenda, no "protecting people from muh male gaze".
AI feels like an attempt to divert everyone's attention from societies real problems, while it may still be a very real problem
I don't like Some AI
Think about it.    China owns a large amount of Disney.  China is pushing this woman woke culture.   Not only repeatedly ruining Disney's  product but also promoting that women dont need men... men are idiots that have to be saved and women are stringer than men.   Attacking the family unit.   Why would disney continuosly push diversity by shoving it down our throats.   Im a brown man.  And im sixk of this.   As a shareholder.  Im wondering why they are doing this
It's funny, how video depicts using AI as something apocalyptic evil in a time, when world is standing on the edge of WW3
IMO AI will never be used to benefit human wellbeing as long as Corporations have so much control over.. everything. Corporations will always seek to cut costs and get more profit, what AI can do for them easily, this leads to the loss of jobs for people and therefore their income, and in our capitalistic system, that is basically a death sentence. The solution thus is to either decouple having a job with being able to survive, or reduce the amount of control corporations have, preferably both.
UTTP please comment here
hearing that intro again gave me flashbacks
Going out on a rebellious arc are we? Love it.
old intro back lets go
thank you MatPat for everything.
Since we're on the topic of generative A.I, here's a brief primer on how A.I generated images works, since there's a *LOT* of misinformation online. Because, no, it's not simply making a collage using images from a library of stolen images.   How it actually works is the A.I is shown thousands and thousands of labelled images, and it uses these images to learn the shapes and colors of things. You show it a million images of dogs labelled as "dog" and it'll learn that a "dog" is typically something with four legs, a tail, floppy ears and covered in fur, for example. At this point, the training images are no longer needed, as it's already learned what it needs to know. This is why offline generators like Stable Diffusion are only around 6GB in size, instead of the terabytes and terabytes of images that would be required if it was simply making a collage.     When it comes to actually making an image, first, it's fed an image consisting of random noise. It then tries to "pull-out" the requested image by gradually re-arranging the noise to form the shapes of the things it's been requested to make an image of. Sorta like when you look at clouds and start seeing clouds that look like different things.   The fact that A.I image generation is inherently based on randomness, is why the results tend to be chaotic, and trying to get something specific is like trying to herd cats. This is the also the Achilles heel of A.I that makes it difficult for it to be the harbinger of doom that many artists fear. Whoever is opting to use A.I instead of hiring human artists, will have to come to terms with the fact that they will lack control over the output and will eventually have to accept whatever it is the A.I is giving you. Sure, that's not a problem in some situations. For example, the Palworld guys could very well have used A.I to generate the initial design concepts for their monsters, since "gimmie a bunch of images of monsters that look sorta like Pokemon" is the sorta thing it could do. But there's more to creating content than just this, and it's the ability of human artists to, y'know, follow instructions, that still means they're essential.
“Pro China slant”? Writers may wanna be more careful in the future. 9:34
hmmmmm
I’I thought Matpat was quitting
Nothing is a new idea we as humans use what we have seen and add stuff to what we know to make a quote on quote “new idea”
so I'm not the only one who noticed this but it is so sad that it is inevitable
god the 7 film theories remain showing up is such a huge gut punch
China infiltrated disney
Nah matpat, pretty sure the current and next propaganda is more so intended to get us to focus on diversity.   Why? Because the thing that brings people together is commonality, common grounds. By contrast, focusing on what makes people different will have the opposite effect. The main corporations pushing this do it by design for that very reason. They intentionally go out of there way to make them stand out, as if to suggest there is a distinction. A lens of "there is 'us' and there is 'them' " depiction. They are distraction tactics. Intentional manipulation, "focus on the radicalization rather than us lobbying congress to support the wealthy, be it allowing the housing market to get worse, push public domain laws back or, all that's going on with the banking instition, you name it". They don't want us to understand the legislation system to hold them accountable. They don't want us involved. They just want us to kick and scream "you need to do better" without actually understanding anything on the topic we are addressing.  As long as you are focused on fighting eachother, you won't bother focus on fighting us for the things we don't want you to see. That's the goal, the part they aren't telling you.
The only problem with AI work tends to be how soulless the content comes out. Disney puts in the work, even when they use the AI. So I am fine with it, so long as care and hard work is still done. After all, when the content doesn’t work out, more criticism comes down on the content like the film Wish.
at @16:00 i was wondering when the box around the capital AI why Adobe Illustrator wasn't brought up because for many years it got many people to embrace the letters A and I together which to me is a clear gateway to having people embrace the idea of using AI in there everyday life.  It may just be a stretch but seeing how much adobe has in market share it may not be too far of a stretch after all.
wow a based film theory video?
Knowing is half the battle.  Actually knowing is the other half
All this anti-AI mentality is going to be our downfall
For better or worse these generative programs are here to stay. And well its time to use them in our favor as well. If they want to cheapen the labor, we can do that right back and not buy anything from them cause we can make our own images without them.  It is inevitable
Has anyone else noticed that the subscriber count on all channels has decreased by a lot
Cortana of Halo
We have a responsibility here
Propaganda is as old as media. Matt, The fact you chose to only talk about AI because it’s only a threat to YouTubers and creatives makes you pretty hypocritical (you’re making propaganda yourself) why didn’t you talk about how Disney has ruin the MCU with propaganda? Ruin Star Wars? They don’t make content that is made to be enjoyed anymore, they make propaganda pieces for social movements. I personally just want good entertainment, at least when transformers pushed the military they were actually making something entertaining…
Is this not propaganda?
One of the better intros
At the end actors will only be a figurehead, a physical version of the "AI actor", no matter how bad an actor will be, it will probably come to physical appearance and likeliness of the person, while the acting will all be done by AI
0:36 omg the intro is back
Matpat on 2 occasions A.I helped the hero not only 2 but 2 heros I think, iron man's Jarvis turned into vision and beat Ultron and spiderman far from home Edith helps him for the first half of the movie kinda.
This is my favorite Film Theory video yet. Thank you, Matpat!
Very cool
why are u using the classic theme song, randomly
6:06 haha we're in danger
I am a mix bag in this one. It be cool to have a robot buddy, but stealing writers jobs is not good. I want a work togeather, not a replacement.
Detroit Become Human duh...
Also never forget how disney remove "certain type of character" from movies depending of the country
Disney? Propaganda? I'm shocked... :/
I just realized fallout 4 is all about helping synths
I will do 1 punch for every like on this comment
Wait did he just say final 10 episodes? Can someone enlighten me?? What am I missing?? (Please no smart mouth answer😑, I’m genuinely confused)
Lol, like it or not, ai take over is coming. The beat we can do is delay it
Is it propaganda or is it the studios trying to train ai that we don’t see them as a threat and that we can live together?
Tbh, bringing up the twist of robot propaganda is great. I've always loved AI ever since i learned about it, and now, almost hate every movie where AI is portrayed as evil. It genuinely is terrible to see artistic creations like movies be minimalized by the day. But its also just what progress is. If we continue down this path, who knows, maybe every person with a passion can make their own dreams come true. All it'll take is AI
Yes… leftist propaganda.
You do realize that more people will just do what you and yes there will be AI competing with you however there's already over 8 billion people on the planet... There will only become more and unless there's some sort of world ending even.  Basically more people will make content about their passion. There should be a way to filter for human made content and verify that. Oh also guaranteed basic income paid for by taxes on ai/robots controlled by AI...  But sure go ahead and keep defending working to death for starvation wages...
Love the episode, but must say, “The Creator” was one of the worst movies I’ve ever watched. Great cinematography and effects, but the story is paper thin and makes zero sense. The plot is either super easy to guess and boring, or just makes no sense as to why ANYTHING happens.
WOW😂 Yeah good thing this is 1 his last video! Take MATT, Thank you 👍
Bro ive missed the intro for so long 😢😱😱
What is "7 theories remain" mean 🤔
Honestly I've always been on the ai's side, if you want to cut costs then more power to you. And I'll get to keep my life when the ai takes over the world
Seems like this is kind of a controversial take on the situation, but really…how is this any different from every other technological change that happens over the years.   New technology and tools come in that allow business, whether in Hollywood or elsewhere, to do things more effectively, save money, and sometimes drastically change how they operate.   And as with any change in the economy, it can be a detriment to some and a benefit to others, but eventually we will reach a new equilibrium.    Companies used to use typewriters all the time, and then computers came along, and the companies that made typewriters, and the people who could make a living repairing typewriters, probably went out of business or had to pivot to doing new things.    For the most part is not “moral” or “immoral” it’s just changing times.   It makes sense that companies would want to use a technology that could save them money, and certainly the budgets for movies and tv have been ballooning to ridiculous levels as it is.   Seems like there are two responses; oppose the adoption of new technology or impose protections to make sure things don’t change too much too quickly, or adapt to the changing reality and environment of the business.
Take this to its logical conclusion and start demanding that Disney pay the AI
momento mori
F DISNEY
The original opening 🥹🥹
MatPat's going all out now, bro don't care anymore 💀
I don't like ai as an artist
"that IS cool" ... what is? identity theft? lol
please make aot rumbling theory next
last matpat video being about disney propoganda... wow...
I actually like generative AI, but the fact that Disney is being so sneaky and persistent about it makes me overwhelmingly angry
Problem is deeper than AI. Did you know you can hire voice actor who can imitate lets say... Morgan Freeman for your new indie game trailer? For around 20$? This is just next step of generalization of content creation. But its faster. Instead of hiring person to imitate voice you can just get it from prompt... same thing but much more efficient
We Terminator and Matrix 1,2,3 to become popular again
don't forget the detroit
YES THE OG FILM THEORY INTRO
First I want to say overall great video. I do have one critique though. Please double check and verify what branch of service you think you are talking about when showing footage. If you don't want to take the time to do that please just say the military. The first commercial you showed a commercial for the U.S. Marines not the Army. To make it worse, it isn't like the commercial you used hides the service it is recruiting for. You didn't need to go hunting for it. Where you cut the footage, it is mere seconds from saying it. It is not only lazy but also so disrespectful to anyone who has served in any service and to the family members who have lost loved ones who have served. The Marines are not the Army and vice versa. They are completely different branches and serve different purposes within the military. While we all work together for a common goal, we are still not the same thing.   Out of all of the organizations on youtube to get this wrong I'm so surprised and disappointed that one of the theorist channels did. The same brand/team that goes into depth of detail down to the number of toes on animatronics, looks at the digital identifiers for colors used in video games, and goes to the nth degree to sus out clues on ARG websites to put together convoluted lore and make sense of it really couldn't take an extra 30 seconds to verify the name of the branches of service that you  are talking about when it is provided to you by the footage that YOU used and had to look at? Realy?   Listen, I'm not asking you guys to be experts on the military or even fans of it. Just please have at minimum half of the attention to detail you guys usually have with made up lore and stories as you do with organizations where REAL people have willingly put themselves in harms way and have sacrificed not just holidays, milestone events with their families but also in a lot of cases their mental health and their lives in order to keep harm from knocking at our doors. Please and thank you.
I hate AI so much
It's all so dystopian and sad. Made me cry.
thanks captain obvious.
⛄️
YESS THE INTRO IS BACK! Missed that so much
I’d argue that we steal everything in the sense that we had to see it to be inspired to begin with
Ive always felt like its the stupidest thing to replace people with AI. If people dont have work, they arent gonna be coming to watch your movies.
Okay, without wanting to be mean, but this is just badly researched. Fist of all the story of good robots is not an endorsement of AI. Or do you want to tell me that blade runner is an endorsement of Chat-GPT? Second for this theory you do not have to show that there are movies with positive depictions of AI, you have to show that there are more movies like that in current years.  That does not mean that Disney will not use or like to use AI in order to pay even fewer to their workers, but if you construct a theory just by cherrypicking evidence that is not a good theory. The video starts with Mission impossible, an example for a movie depicting AI in a negative light.  [Small spoilers for matrix 4 and major for The fall of the house of Usher; watch it, it is great =)] The fourth matrix-movie has programs that want to live in peace with the humans, like the first three, but the main villain of the movie is also the maschines. The AI in the fall of the house of Usher does not work!!!! It is the point of the whole thing that whatever the UShers do they can not be immortal. The only thing the AI can do is remind Roderic of the people he lost and they are NeVErmore.  I think the problem with propagandan is a little bit more complicated than something gets depicted in a movie.  But it is good that we talk about it, so thanks for bringing it up.
Saw the intro, got nostalgic.
I saw the creator and it was amazing!
Kinda reminds me of the movie Simone from 2002
I want to be a better artist because i cant draw to save my life. And sometimes it makes me sad seeing so many of my other artist friends draw so well while im still lagging behind. Despite that I'll never stoop to using AI to make art. Never. It beats the purpose of me pursuing this passion to begin with. I rather never be good at art for the rest of my life than steal images from people who have dedicated their lives to their skills just for self satisfaction to pretend to be an artist. Put any AI supporter in a room with a pencil and paper and they wouldn't even know where to start. These tech bros who spent decades looking down on artists have no right to barg in claiming they are part of this and to "adapt or die". If you do not have a passion for creativity and a heart, you are not an artist.
the supreme intelligence was far from benevolent, per the first movie, and Carol already said in that movie that she was coming for the AI.  And I think the plot would be the same regardless of if the leader was an AI or biological.   The point was Carol unilaterally chose to assassinate the leader of a whole planet and then left them to pick up the pieces, not thinking about the consequences.   the fact that the leader was an AI is ancillary.
Dang. MatPat may be leaving Youtube, but he sure is going out swinging!
Matt Patt whe he discovers that all human media is used to convey some kind of message 🤯🤯🤯
This intro makes me so happy
Talk about the godfather
Disney using propaganda? Next you'll tell me that fire is hot.  Just kidding. They've done it quite a bit and it's always a topic worth discussion.   I have mixed feelings about the subject of AI to be honest. On one hand it sucks that people have been all for automation without care for the jobs lost until it happens to their entertainment. Says a lot about the priorities of the American population and none of the things that it says are good. On the other hand, it's really fked up that these corporations care ao little about their employees that this discussion needs to happen in the first place (granted some of these Hollywood "writers" themselves have been using AI to help write their scripts which adds a certain richness to their complaints but that's an adjacent subject).   Unfortunately when the industry wants something to happen it'll force it bit by bit until there's unified, nigh universal pushback (see the gaming industry for more details). These studios WILL use AI whether we like it or not and the only way to stop it is through a combination of voting with our wallets and the kind of backlash/dissent that they simply cannot ignore (see the WOTC OGL debacle for more details).
i think mat pat is makeing an ARG, let me explain. he is beginning all of his videos with his final good byes with a countdown till he hands off the silver platter to someone els. plus, on 14:04 there is a screen of crypted messages that you might miss. It looks like its written is jappenesse, but some of the words are highlighted a brighter green then others. I dont feel like decodeing that because im lazy, but i think someone should. My theory is that the countdown of videos is also the countdown to something bigger, something scaryier. But remeber, thats just a theory, A comment theory. thanks for reading
The Matrix 4 followed on what was already set up in the original series though.  As early as the Animatrix they were setting up that the AIs weren't as much the cut and dry villains as the first movie suggested, and Matrix Reloaded revealed the Oracle and other programs supported the human side.   Revolutions involved a plot thread around a little girl AI conceived out of love being the key to peace with the machines, and ended with Neo negotiating an end to the war in exchange for defeating Smith
This is a theory???
Ironman 3 in China being propaganda to make the Chinese people DRINK MILK is one of the most confusing things I have ever heard, but it somehow makes sense 🤨that's crazy
Remember, AI is not and never will be human, do not treat it as such, do not give people who think AI deserves rights the time of day.
Could you Do a theory on harper/piper drama UK you have like ten left but could that be one of Ur last
Did I get misty eyed when seeing the intro again?   No   Maybe   Okay yes. I did. 😢😅😂
wasn't wargames kind of an anti-war movie?
In a better world AI could be beneficial for some many other things, helping the medical industry detect cancer, improving transport systems and efficient road mapping, detecting disasters and helping people in need, but nope instead the people who make AI literally went after artists, writers, singers and literally all the people who represent the creative, passionate and unique side of being human. None of these people ask for AI, and those industries who actually do need AI are not getting the support they need. Instead of being used to save lives it made people lose their jobs, their homes and their passion for art and storytelling. Truly we're in the darkest timeline.
just make Biden watch climate change docs
AI generated content is fine only if it's kept in check by having copyright protection for real humans and also clearly disclosing that what you are watching, reading or hearing is generated by AI. With full transparency and security, everyone can decide if they want to spend time to consume said AI generated content. At some point we will need filters for the new category of AI generated content throughout the internet.
2:30 shouldve used the cuban sandwich meme
Thank you matpat for everything! Also great video!! IM SO HAPPY HE BROUGHT BACK THE OLD INTROS!
Nobody can see the Propaganda that worked on them.  Its that effective.
Disney had big movies? Thought they all were flops.
Speaking of ai, there are way too many bots in these comments man, literally every reply section is SATURATED in them.
A surprising number of downvotes (but nowhere near the upvotes) as of this post: 1.1k vs 85k (plus one for me just now 😄)  Are AI programs/supporters trying to 'ratio' this video, I wonder? 😅
I will get one like for every like I get on this comment
Matgpt
This sucks because I’ve always enjoyed stories about machines becoming self aware and eventually being treated as equals, but I hate that they’re now using them to promote the use of AI tools in the entertainment industry. They’re technically two very separate meanings of AI, one is an actual artificially created intelligence (which is what AI should refer to), and the other is just an algorithm that makes content out of other peoples content and replaces peoples jobs. I hate that corporations are trying to use something I really like to promote something I hate.
Hearing the film theory intro music brought a smile to my face.
Maybe we all want to live in that cyberpunk esque world subconsciously 😂
Do new Hazbin Hotel
Except in The Fall of the House of Usher it is shown that the AI doesn't work and the person pushing is a bad guy.
Disney pushes a lot more than AI. They push  huge lgbtq+ agenda
What about wokism? L😝L
did not expect for the intro to make me tear up😭
Its almost not a theory. You notice how toxic they all are if you flat-out dont watch the movies and just hear the unnecessary rave and love put out for a very mediocre animated film.
So happy to see them old intros back 😁 And the fact that some of his final theories that contains topics like these that spread awareness (about issues that would prolly get worse in the future) is really heartwarming 💯
Gendertheory is no being pushed as secret Propaganda?
Personally, AI replacing people depends on the context. In a world where everyone needs money to survive, less job opportunities is bad. However, if this world were more socialist, things would be very different
the fall of the house of Usher AI actually ends up proving that AI cannot replace humans! and every character besides the girl that says "that's so cool" is portrayed as evil or horrible in some way. the AI that eventually does "replace" her once she dies only serves as ghost to the main character guy. I don't think netflix was ACTUALLY trying to convince people AI was cool, but the opposite. AI cannot replace humanity, even if it's almost perfected
A war is coming out so yeah
Yet another great theory from matpat. this is nice. Soaking it while I can
Hiii
We need to have a theory about "mikaeli" when they end that seoris if they leave it up to theorists. So far it looks great.
I know he says this is a film theory at the end of every video, that wasn't no theory thats actually happening
Hilariously, The Creator is another movie very notably NOT approved by the U.S. Military. See the logo on the tank at 13:32.
AI is neither good nor bad, it's powerful tool. If you are creative and know how to use it you can make beautiful artwork 10x faster. Or you can be lazy, talentless fake who hide behind "cheap" tricks... Than you have last decade of disney.
Disney? Propaganda? No……
Hopefully Disney doesn’t come after matpat😭😭
10:30 Malamine = Magic Erasers
knowledge hasn't helped me in the past. all it's done is make me more depressed
why did he make the good bye internet if he's still making videos
The Creator was really good
One of your best nontheory - theories
LGBTQ miss
Honestly I have never understood the interpretation of starship troopers as satire of facism, though maybe seeing it when I was 12 was one reason.   But really, aside from the tv commercial moments scattered throughout the film, it’s always come off as being pretty earnest and straightforward to me.    I don’t see much satirical humor in the moments “outside” the commercials, and we seem invited to sympathize with and root for the heroes in the story in a non-cynical un-ironic way.   Plus, I don’t recall any point in the narrative where any of the characters address or draw attention to the apparent absurdities of their own society  I’ve always kind of wondered if the interpretation of starship troopers as satire was by some film critics who were uncomfortable with accepting the world of the movie at face value, and had to think of it as being all tongue in cheek in order to enjoy it
You know what you have to do to prove you’re not an ai now right?
I heard we’re loosing you pat. Is this why?  Edit. I just went to the comments and never have I seen such human responses. Beep bop boop. That’s scary.
One version is like me replace me killing me with out no one knows and then wat we fonna give everything no im not getting copyed 😂
Yep, I'm still scared of AI and robots and stuff.
Aside from the whole A.I message in The Creator, was I the only one that felt it was WAYYYY to close to the whole movie of Elysium? Like i mean WAY WAY WAYYY too close.
Nope. Just the five.
He needs to do a Super Bowl script theory
Chobits had friendly AI characters.
I keep thinking about Sonic Team making A.I. characters that make you care. Gamma , Omega , Bell , Sage , and all of Scrapnik Island. And I can't tell if computer nerds are just wishing for somebody that can talk with them. Or if they are trying to say "Making life this way is bad by concept."
love Love LOVING the old intro 😩
dont forget about how jeff bridges was de-aged in tron legacy!
What is that cartoon shown around 4:48 in the video?
I'm not ready to say goodbye matpat 😢😢 but I get it i accept it anyway a
8:38 using the epic rap battles of history intro for Michael Bay is hilarious😂
The point about The Fall of the House of Usher is wrong.   The Ushers were insanely wealth, and very clearly the bad guys in the show. They never had the interests of the people, they were selfish, thinking only about themselves.   This was most definitely criticizing AI.
9:56 To be fair, China helping out in The Martian was... right out of the book. China has largely overtaken Russia as having the second most advanced space program and the book was extrapolating where they'd be by the time it took place, actually doing major launches with large boosters that could be used to save Mark.
15:40 Those cgi extras have literally nothing to do with AI
Inspiration and propaganda are two different things.
Wow I didn’t know people so strongly hated adobe illustrator
Definitely spitting more propaganda than that but sure.
world started following horizon zero dawn lore 💀
THAT INTRO MADE ME BRUST INTO TEARS BRUH OMFG I MISSED THST
You 1000% twisted around the TFOTHOU clip to fit your narrative, congratulations on being just as bad as your Disney overlords.
too late, i love ai
matpat can you please make a santiago of the sea theory
I always knew how wild and out of control AI was
Jesus Christ was iRobot really twenty years ago?
if you take this video and replace the term AI with multi-dimensional theory & Q-mechanics - that applies too...this is a very good video thx x
In general, it's ok for machines to replace people's jobs for the last 40-60 years, but now AI is replacing more people's jobs it's an issue 🙄
Hold up, no true AI like in the creator are still a scifi concept far off in the future, I actually approve of legislating how we're going to handle true AI, if it ever actually comes to be, the closer we get the more holes I see in the idea. What we need to focus on the is the real world applications like writing AI and art generating AI, as well as AI's applications in deep fakes
YES THE INTRO IS BACK! WOOOOO!!!!!~
Well, if good old MatPat is retiring, may as well go out with a massive fanfare! Excellent video topic choice! Honestly, if people learned how to vote with their money properly, these disgusting corperations would be kept in better line. Go independent artists!!
The saving grace, at least so far, is that AI-created work can't be copyrighted. Which means the opening to Secret Invasion? You could reasonably argue that you don't need Disney's permission to use it for something, since it was created using AI. I'm sure it will wind up being decided in a major case in the Supreme Court, but that's what could possibly make the breaking decision.
They did same with blck ppl and goblins
looks like companies and such want people to stop having kids and continuing human existence; whats the point in having kids if AI will take away their future
Oh lord. I missed this old intro so much.
Finally the Film Theorist has entered his Conspiracy Theory arc, although it's probably just filler, this is my favourite episode.
To be fair, with the fall of the house of usher, the AI ends up torturing the main character
I really wish you keep the intro forever 😩
Independent creators ultimately will be the ones who will be able to use AI to its full potential, because they'll use it to fulfill their vision.    Corporations on the other hand will simply use AI to cut corners.
AI art, acting, and writing helps the lazy and punishes those who spent years perfecting their craft. If you're too dense and lazy to practice or learn a skill, don't punish everybody else because of it. Your incompetence is your problem.
The robo matpat sounds like an impersonator who has a lil too much energy
15:20  anime mat lol
Does MatPat omission of mentioning LGBT propaganda is propaganda?
miss you mat pat
Call in Gregory
i ber all theses vids will be ai whe mat retires
They really had to put rogue ai in a Mission Impossible for the president to take action
Pls Matpat when you stop don't go full kwebbelkop and keep it human
I wonder how fast they can reprogram our view on AI. For 60 years, they ingrained in us that AI turns evil
I hate ai. It makes me feel useless and it takes away from what it means to be human imo.
i thought you were retired bro
I'm not ready for that last Theory.
It’s kind of crazy how it says only seven remain like man just let me enjoy this please😢
Not enough upvote buttons
What if you had to train your own ai with data you own   So when an ai is given a prompt it will give you an answer that is based off stuff that you own instead of random stuff
For every like I receive on this comments, I will reveal what they are keeping in Areredrhhf rnhgyjnv
I think that only people who don't have a ton of money should be allowed to use AI. If I need to try making art for the fantasy setting I'm building, I have neither the skills, time, nor money to get that done traditionally. Using an AI generator is, frankly, my only option at this time. A corporation with millions or billions of dollars, however, has no reason to use AI other than to enrich itself and lay off people who have dedicated their livelihoods to working on professional artwork.
i got a ad of a ai app will watching this vid lol
How to identify the old person in the room...  they refer to the 27 year old movie as "modern"
Disney has been pushing propaganda for the past noone knows how many years. The premise of this video is like: Hey guys, have you seen the sky? It's blue!  Seriously, this is the low hanging fruit.
I think the big problem with "deep fakes" in movies is when you're putting words in the mouths of people who are DEAD.  Peter Cushing was DEAD.  Has been.  For a while.  Not cool to just make an AI version and go with it, even for Star Wars.  Don't put words in dead peoples' mouths, not about anything.  Not a script, not a concept, not a sound, let them be dead.  Peter Cushing is dead, he can't give consent for his likeness and voice to be used, so DON'T.
I had no idea that the Creator was a Disney owned movie. I loved the movie, but how did I not know this?
is this chanel still yours mate pat?
Am I the only one who noticed a different thumbnail?
i love theory videos because of ones like this though saying what is happening and let the watchers make there own opinions with the same kind of care that all the theory's have had and as a viewer ill miss matpat
That "The Marvels" joke, was crazy. U were all like, of course u didn't see the marvels. Nobody did🤣🤣
THE INTRO is killing me .thank you matpat we will alaways love you.❤
Disney be like: he has said to much
thanks mat, now i hate disney even more.
As a writer/creator I can understand why years of “evil AI” content has led to a cycle of “maybe AI isn’t evil” content, just because it’s always interesting to think “what if the way this is perceived is actually wrong?”, and media tends to kind of cycle like that. But I feel like those stories only being told *right now* is definitely suspicious, and have a slant to them that makes me think it’s not at all coincidental. The funny thing is, what we have right now isn’t even REALLY artificial intelligence, not in a scifi way! If generative “AI” was actually intelligent, I think the question of whether or not it was stealing would be way more complicated. If it were making its own connections, creating art based on its own perspective and life experience, the conversation would be different. As it is, “AI” can still not think or reason by itself, it is still just a trained algorithm.
why isint anyone talking about this being matpats last theory?
Still good videos. i wonder what the next owner will do with the channel
When you talk about films that had no trouble getting military support, ignore Transformers, that was a joke, yeah, the helicopter pilot is the actual pilot, but... The real movie, that was a recent hit, with huge military backing... War of the Worlds... ALL of the soldiers depicted are were actual US military from the 10th Mountain Division.
No wonder the 4th and 5th transformers movies weren't as good as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ones
Not a theory...next
Now think about this compared to Fox News. (Sorry for politticizing this just kept popping into my head while I was watching and had to say it)
so, everyone keeps talking about AI (artificial intelligence) like Chat GTP, but programs like that are only SI (simulated intelligence). they simulate the idea of intelligence instead of actually being an artificially made personality. i agree with the message, but i just had to have an "um actually" moment about the differences between the two.
The fact that I have the bell on and didn't get this video on my notification or my fyp or my watch next..... I dunno...............
Make a second skibidi toilet theory now in the latest episode 70 part 2 theres some huge lore
Hazbin hotel and helluva boss next😊😊❤❤😈😈
"lets ignore all the antiwhite movies and forced diversity messaging and talk about AI". this is you
Wow, sadly the comment section is filled with bots. The best part is, is that the video talks about a.i. The irony.
the og intro
Can you pleeeeaaaase do a theory on the shiloh and bros lore? 🙏🙏
Was that the old intro?
This classic intro!!
I missed the part where this is a theory. Disney has been pushing propaganda for a lot more than just AI for a long time now.  Also, don't know who did you guys talk to but Luke and Indy look fake AF.  Also also whatever Biden  signed was because his caretakers told him to do it.
Isn’t this operation mockingbird?
They used Michael Bay from ERB🤣
Oh that old film theory intro hits HARD
Wake up? But I thought it was bad to be "woke?" I'm awake, please stop reminding me. I'd much rather be asleep.
I think if AI is using your art without you’re consent you have the right to feed it wrong information or terrible art
Okay, deaging a living actor who AGREED to it is not remotely the same as reacreating dead actors who didn't get a say
Its hurting more n' more as i see -7 theories- >:
When you realize how meta it has become that a propaganda channel talks about propaganda.
Not news. They've been making propaganda so Iger can get appointed Ambassador to China
16:59 Yes, but the difference here is that the actors in both cases were still alive and could grant permission for their likenesses.
Wow… very interesting
I think you're missing the biggest one.....WALL-E
we’ve said it before and we will say it again, we are gonna miss you matpat. 🤍
I miss the old openings
I don't hate Ai itself for existing, heck even regular ppl just using it for entertainment is fine. But big Corporations using it to not have to pay voice actors or any actors at all, using it so they don't even need animators or so that they can pay them less? Disgusting, shameless, should be illegal. I mean me using Ai to to chat with is just entertainment, if the story me and the AI create is good and I write a book about the story then that's not an issue because it's the same as if something happened in my own life and I wrote about that, it's just a story that I write WITH the AI, just like how I don't write my own life without OTHERS. but big Corporations that actively only make movies/series etc for moneys sake shouldn't be allowed to use AI like this, because I'm just some random guy who wants to tell a story and maybe make a lil money on it, while they are a huge number of business men that are doing it exclusively for the money.
Detroid become human...
Ah just like the old matpat. Unhinged, questionable, and insane
Thank U Matpat
I will jump of a bridge if this comment gets a 1000 likes       Don’t like pls i don’t want to jump of a bridge
I don’t know if it happened before recently but seeing the film theory intro on the this video gave me the biggest rush of nostalgia I have felt in years
I still dont know why everyone is so against Adobe Illustrator all of a sudden 🤷
I miss that og intro
The deepfake Luke was in the Mandalorian not Book of Boba Fett.
YUP 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have a feeling if i dont watch this now, i wont get to at all.
As an artist, I despise AI (but if used as a tool its fine as long as ITS NOT A REPLACEMENT) so no amount of propaganda can brainwash me into thinking ai is a good replacement. I HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS regarding this lol
Vtubers like Neuro sama and project melody are AI and so lovely
Crazy that blud put a Princess Bride reference at the end when I'm currently rewatching the move got sum you wanna tell me matpat? 🤨
W's in the shhhhhat
If people wanna have debates about whether AI generated art passes legal tests of originality, e.g. for the purposes of establishing copyright, then cool.  If people wanna debate whether AI generated art is "original" art in the, I guess, creative or philosophical sense, go waste someone else's time. Yes, AI models that generate art are trained on other art. So are human artists that generate art.
Those background characters are NOT ai though. Thats classic cg
Everytime I remember this is one of the few last videos we have from MatPat my heart bleeds 💚
My disappointment when I found out iraq didn't have dragons to slay with a sword
that matpat AI was not even close
Come on guys let's make these last weeks with MatPat as host memorable I wanna see every theory video trending every week we can do it guys!!!!!
plot twist this whole video was made with ai
I missed the film theorist jingle so much
i need people to realize that corporations isnt out to just generate funny lil pictures or make dead celebrities read out poorly written lines. their goal is to automate the entire process of creation taking out everything human out of everything you enjoy in life
While i can see AI propoganda being possible, i disagree with a lot of your examples. Her and ex machina were specfically about humanizing AI and making people think about what it really means to be human. In fact, the creator, and stories like Detroit: Become Human (VERY surprised that film didnt come up in the convo) are less an ai propaganda, and more allegories for racism and the exploitation of minorities in a society. Also, leaving out M3GAN, a bad movie, but one that had enough cultural impact to make it worth mentioning, ESPECIALLY because it heavily humanized its ai, was kinda a diservice. I like the angle youre going with on this theory, but it just missed the mark for me.
and military recruitment is down wonder why
How about we don’t watch any Disney movies haha
Mind blowing 🤯  And the creator was a good film And thank you mat pat 🙌😎👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
0:36 🕺🪩😍😁🤣 0:52 😔😔😔
Man that old intro being back just hits different
I thought matpat had quit but here he is.
all the ai voices sound the same to me
One thing that was brought up by the movie companies to the actors was basically "we scan you once, which you get paid for, then we can use your likeness however we want and you don't get a cent for it" as something positive!   So yeah, I'm not surprised the studios have started this AI propaganda. AI could be something good, too bad the people with the money and power to use and controll AI are greedy stooges that just want all the money and power and therefor turns it into something bad.  Also the fact that it has been proven that AI learns from other creators, if you have written something, like a story in Google Docs, then you can count on AI reading that and learnt from it, without your consent and despite not sharing it anywhere.  It's outright stealing, but those that are stolen from can't do anything about it, since it's one person against big companies.
another quote from the princess bride ages like fine wine.
Bro getting assassinated by Disney for this one 🗣🗣
Dude I just got a AI add lol
I'm going to argue against the Fall of the House of Usher point. Madaline, and all the Ushers, were (spoiler) terrible people KNOWN to manipulate people within their own family. While I don't argue that Netflix (all all big corps) want to use AI to be more cost effective (because skrew paying humans for their work, amIrite), I don't think that the plot point was "just thrown in there, " as Matpat said, and nor do I think it was the writer's intent to be like "here's my family of terrible people, but listen to Aunt Mads about this one thing," ya know?
I love these meta/political types of theories. Really hoping we still get them even after Mat retires. Keep up the good work
Yessss, the og intro is back🎉🎉🎉
finally conspiracy theory
For some reason hat Thumnail felt out-of-pocket💀
the og intro made almost made me cry
what’s with all these bot comments
Hey Matpat can we get a theory on Hazbin hotel there's a series on prime video I think you would love it!
Why does the fake AI matpat not look or sound anything like the real matpat?
that intro sent me back to a time where i was young and had no responsibilities, back when i first started watching the theorists and unlocked my overthinking mind :')
"Disney is trying to make AI look good and it's working."  Disney 2023: releases 13 movies that ended up being major failures because their AI Plans aren't actually working.
This channel helped brith my love of film, I’m not ready to let go man 🥹, THE OLD INTRO MY GOD🥹🥹🥹
If writers arent able to write something better than an AI program, they deserve to be replaced.
Is there any such thing as good propaganda? It's all manipulation to push someone else's message. And if there is the case it should be illegal.
I like ducks
Well, certainly a meta talk. My education is robotics, so I can definitely see the issues being valid. This is one issue of MANY currently happening, and ALL of it needs to at the very least be addressed. Cost of living, depression, loaded content, labor force changes. Please educate yourselves on as many perspectives from people you might not see eye to eye on things, then compare the hard facts not emotions.
Oh my god hearing the Film Theory opening again just blew it flipping MIND and put life back into my soul. It was so nice to hear it again.
So you going to make a video about native appropriations since you covered military?
BRo why no spoiler allert for matrix ;/
Wake up its propaganda
I have a theory. Our generation will be the generation that will start the omnic crisis, or sonething similar where robots feel discriminated and will rise against us. We will likely will be the "racist" "robophobic" bigots of the future. Our generation will be looked at like we look at far older generations than us. The cycle continues.
to the surprise of no one
Also - we can parody propganda mercilessly - that's what the internet is for. The roots of Youtube are those GI Joe Parody videos after all - which were even circulating around in years prior.
I’ve been watching your video for the close to 7 years. And while I have many of your videos that I enjoy, I think this is one of my new favorite videos that you’ve made! Thank you for all your wise words and fun entertainment over then years! You’ve truly made my life better.
once again, if i know a little of the subject he is covering, i always find bunch of errors that i just cant take this serious.
I don't want to even see Hollywood in 2040s. If they keep this AI stuff in their content
Rip matpat
I’m the thanks giving poster I think that goofies kid is planning on eating something else than a pie….
They won't add the household crisis because it truly is an impossible mission
I'm not opposed to the idea of AI in our lives as much as other people, I think AI can and will help us in the future, but the way these big media corporations are forcing the idea of AI is friendly and good is becoming way too creepy. You don't need to shove the idea down our mouth to show what it is, just show us the results and show that they are beneficial.
Once again asking for one more subnautica theory
so happy to see the og intro
Why is the thumbnail so bland on this one?
MatPat: “As Always, I’ll see you next week.” Guess it wasn’t for “Always” then. 😢
Yo, this comment section is actually filled with ai bots spamming the replies. Go to thier channel pages and report them, and then report thier comments as well.
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Everytime I see the countdown I feel so saaaad.
I knew something was amiss with Disney
8:39 ERB
Imagine if AI Matpat appears from time to time after he leaves
Matpat I'm going to miss you when you're gone your videos got me through some very tough times I thank you from the bottom of my heart
Sometimes I wonder if all interaction in   the Internet automates itself at some point. We can create Text, images, videos and even reactions (comments, likes etc) with A.I. I imagine some day social media will be just one huge echo chamber of bots that only few people really use anymore
I'll seriously miss Matpat. 😢
This might be my favorite video  I love when i learn about stuff while watching your videos
ur still here!!! :'  )
He unquit? Well good to see ya
11:43 anime
the fact that i got an ad for a generative ai on this video is wild
Careful Matthieu you are trigreing the AI overlord's sencitive side
9:56 also in the book to but yeah makes sense
Maybe I'm biased because I want a YoRHa 2B girlfriend, and have been raised on futuristic/fantasy fictions where this isn't much of a problem (e.g. Star Wars & Transformers, Final Fantasy & Xenoblade), I personally think all this fretting is silly...   Just make the things good and there's nothing to worry about!
MATPAT IM DOING MY HISTORY PROJECT ON YOU AND STEPH It has to be abt someone who is going to be remembered in 500 yrs
Didn't this guy said he will quit youtube?
See, here's the thing... they can't copyright anything AI-generated.
A..I doesn't exist because A.I. must have human intelligence including human feelings.
18:02 fin.
First off what you are talking about is not Artificial Intelligence. They are in fact algorithms that brute force their way to a passable result. Human input is still required. Secondly the tools are not the problem, but rather the corrupt hands use them. In short, programs useful. Capitalism bad .
90% sure this was ai generated
But can it even be called propoganda if nobody watches it
Me eating a smart cookie: ahh thanks Matt!  The smart cookie: AAAAAAAAAAAAA
during my bachelors whenever i hear someone say AI i know exactly they have no idea what they are talking about.
I love how every theory about Disney is about some messed up things they did or plan to do
DONT TELL ME!...
obsessed with sodomy and abortion as the dominant forces in culture.
The problem isnt just with art or saving a few bucks on labor... People are more focused on whats going on NOW more then LATER  People already have trust issues with what's real so now toss Al into the mix, why believe anything anymore? a robot probably faked it for you to be lied to
If I am completely honest, as an illustrator who has been making art consciously for almost 10 years now, I would have no issue with AI if we didn't live under a system (capitalism) where supporting it will mean the loss of my only viable work option that doesn't make me feel depressed. If i didn't have to earn a living through making art, I would absolutely welcome it as a tool to help creators make a base from which they can work off of (and those who don't like it don't have to use it, because they wouldn't have to compete with ai-assisted art to keep their own jobs).  If we put aside some moral problems with the usage of AI for now, I think the problem isn't AI - the problem is the system under which its usage is directly linked to people's loss of ability to live somewhat comfortably doing what they love.
Yay intro!!
I'm curious to know what other people think about AI. Personally, I'n pretty conflicted. I'm a huge nerd for scifi stuff and the like, and think that it is so amazing that AI has come this far and continues to push the boundaries of our expectations. But as a writer, it's concerning. It's inevitable that eventually the market for novels and other books will be flooded by stuff written by AI, drowning out those that have been written by a human hand. Most people say to adapt and use AI to help write a story, but right now I want to see how far I can go without that aid, though I feel like my progress might be too slow. Thoughts?
It’s nice to see the Intro back
Disney is garbage anyways
As someone that has kept up with this kind of thing, this theory is absolutely terrifying
AI is scary because I’m afraid of the future. I’d rather stay away from progress and stay in my safety bubble. This video is definitely not propaganda against AI.
More of a film fact than a film theory...
Bro artist need to throw In the towel. The anti-sewing machine grandmas did the same thing ya know, and now I have a sewing machine in my Home.  I have Google, to give me free art BABY😂
Disney makes all kinds of propaganda
Storytelling is important. Performing arts is important. Design is important. Pay. your. artists.
I mean.. Disney is making a different kinda propaganda aswell.. but yeknow..
In Wakanda Forever, Shuri tells her mother that “AI is not like the movies” when they literally had an in-universe AI that was Avenger-level threat
I was so thrown off by the old intro! I thought my eyes were deceiving me when I saw it and read that it was posted 11 hours ago. Thank you, Matpat, for everything you've done.. for ten of millions of theorists
Matt brother, Watch pluto to get gist of this
Just saying, it could be a coincedence and a lot of people believe this type of theory.
With that baby formula scandal, china litterly sent people to australia or chinese people alreadt living here to send baby formula back to china, i would see the same people at different supermarkets getting more and more, in the end they could seel one tin for over 200 dollars australian. They had a name, they were calling "daigo"
gotta love propaganda for multi billion companys to pay less employees
Didn't they make the new mission impossible with so much AI like all the driving sequences and a lot of stuff just seemed SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO offf you know, and i keep looking around and nobody else was noticing, everything was a bit off and unreal, unsettling especially those car sequences,                           they  just semmed INHUMAN
1:13  for tabletop gaming, I would have to disagree
AI is actually bad for big companies... what will happen is ever individual can make a production for just about anything in its full... it'll be great for solo game developers.
I mean where are we getting information? Books, websites and social media, knowing how AI get just generate everything, how can we believe everything we see online even offline? I mean we can only pray most people who use AI are good people.
Wait till we start getting the Butlerian Jihad like in the Dune books. Thy shall not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind."
I won’t spoil, but Godzilla: Singular Point has an AI character that plays a pivotal role in the plot.
I will breath for every like this coments gets
I ❤ AI
Wow thats the original intro right
4:30 right when Matt Patt started talking about propaganda my entire internet started lagging and his voice became muffled. I though it was part of the video as a “funny ha ha” until I rewound it and that is not the case. It’s already begun.
Disny is why the copyright is for corperations now/not people/the 1s who made the stuff.
The other half of the battle is made up of 25% blue lasers and 25% red lasers.
They took our jobs
I didnt realise Disney was such a huge proponent of Adobe Illustrator.
Like 1 pushup every comment
AI matpat scares me
I MISS THE OLD INTRO SOO MUCHH
YES!!! The old intro song!!!
i don't think we needed a theory, im pretty sure this one is just fact.
Totally wrong about propaganda. Propaganda is actually when a British person takes a good look at something
Matpat...I'm impressed you would even make a video with this title knowing the kind of potential backlash that could come with it. Disney has always been propaganda. I think people are just finally seeing it because it's gotten so excessive and obvious. Like the company knows the end is near and is trying it's hardest to influence while it still can. Their income these days sure seems like people are waking up.
This has to be top 5 film theories ever
I think it was just needed to do what Dune did to AI And that’s to get rid of it all, and have humans be trained To do what AI does
I just might do a Brotherhood of Steel playthrough when I pick up Fallout 4 again.
First of all… A topic of being important doesn’t make it exciting… Second I hate all of your examples for things, especially the movie about the cree Intelligence… Other than that this is a really good video and really important and I wish you had made it even sooner❤
Maybe Tom Cruise can fight the cost of living next! lol🤣
The 'deepfake' isn't particularly good. 16:54
Great epsiode, I'm glad you mentioned the AI voice SAG-AFTRA thing. Though speaking of, the image if the guy you used to represent how the VA community feels kinda like it is mocking them or painting them as pathetic. I believe and hope that this is unintentional. There was likely a better stock image to use.
This is one of his most important videos ever. Not just because it’ll be one of his last. Share it.  Disney must lose. The way they are using this technology, and the propaganda they’re making around it are both deeply evil.
Why don't you go deeper for your last theories and tell the ACTUAL truth? For example AI is gonna be ... is BEING used to control "free speech" online and manipulate you.
I'm almost glad now that Tomorrowland came out so long ago, because that movie was basically an anti-skynet and such a story (without the shoehorned refocus to the walking plot device as a POV character) could be just what they would want for such purposes...
Small thing, but the “frog in boiling water” thing is a myth. The scientist who popularized it was actually trying to find out what part of the brain consciousness was in. So, he lobotomized a bunch of frogs and then tested if they would still have self-preservation instincts. Turns out, a frog with no brain will indeed let itself be boiled, but an intact frog jumps out around 25° C
It's been so long since the last classic film theory intro...
I think a lot of people have already pointed out how in The Fall of The House of Usher, the ai was used to torment the main character in his final moments. a failed experiment that went wrong and kept texting 'Nevermore'. it wasn't ai positive in my mind and genuinely horrified me. I think Madeline was calling it cool because she was working on it so she could make money from it in the future.
We know, why do you think Elon said he don't care if they pull advertising, he thinks free speech is important
Yo Matt can you wish me happy birthday my birthday is March 4
SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO HAD A LITTLE IDEA IN MY MIND ABOUT THIS TOPIC BUT YOU PORTRAYED IT WAYYYYYY BETTER
AHHHH FINALLY THE FILM THEORY THEME CAME BACK
didnt mat leave youtube?
AI should be a tool to help creatives, not replace them. After all, without those creatives, AI has nothing to learn from. But people and companies are far too interested in the profit of the tool. Like, I get using AI for fun, nothing serious and harmless. But what really scares me is companies using AI to cut costs. Who needs artists and animators when you can use AI to make art for free? Who needs writers and authors when you can use AI to generate text for free? Who needs voice actors when you can use AI to replicate someone's voice? Who needs actors when you can use AI to deepfake someone in? And this is all just the creative side. Once there are no more jobs in the creative field to be replaced by AI, it'll be physical jobs next. Just because AI isn't affecting you now, it will in the future if people don't see it as an issue.  I know people who like AI really like it, but as a creative person myself, it's scary looking at the future. It's easy to think that there's no point to create stuff that takes hours of effort, when you can click some buttons to get close to the desired outcome. But even when I hate the progress of a drawing or I get frustrated by it, there's nothing quite like doing those finishing touches and being happy with the results.
While propaganda can promote any viewpoint or cause, I try to remember this quote by ALdous Huxley: "The propagandist's purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human."  My benchmark, or grain of salt, for the danger of propaganda is figuring out how it might cause hurt or hate.
It'd be wonderful if everyone could agree that Nazis are bad. Instead we got the idiots walking around and voting.
Disney has been a propaganda machine since it’s inception
The creator is really good movie high recommendation to watch it
just like muse said (kinda)
The opposite's been happening for me with these "AI are the hero" films. I haven't watched these films and for good reason.
4:54 OMG WADSWORTH
I do that same thing with a lot of my work. Copy, paste, alter, etc.
My guy it’s not a secret. Disney and Hollywood as a whole have been making propaganda for years
I didn't like Disney for all the bad stuff they had done before, but after watching this, I am genuinely terrified of them.
Anyone see the MatPat ai cover of "my way" by Frank Sinatra after The Announcement? It hit different, and made me wish he would actually cover it
how do you guys feel about A.I replacing actors that passed away, for instance Paul walker ( Brian O'Conner ) from fast and furious. my personal opinion is I personally wouldn't like it ,but i'm curious what other people think
Thats not just a theory this is real
yeah, i'm decently sure we all knew that disney was doing propaganda. it's been happening since 2020
7 left 😭
Disney making propaganda? I coulda told you that!
American Presidents being influenced and motivated by movies is a long standing tradition in American politics. Like Ronald Reagan enacting NSDD-145 (the first Presidential directive on computer security) and signing the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1985 after watching WarGames (1983) at Camp David on Sat, June 4, 1983. 😊
if it wasn’t already, this video is definitely now blocked in china
I saw captain marvel. I did see how they made AI be good. It was wired
this is all technically true, but it implies this conspiracy theory of them controlling everything. It''s still an open market anyone can release films. you should star/have a bigger role in the next five nights at freddies movie. Don't wait for them to offer assert yourself. You should consider directing, getting into making your own films.
That's the dismal future capitalism is taking us to
Yes, this is the worst of the propaganda spread by Disney. Definitely not the agenda that is the woke religion (which is racist btw) taking the forefront instead of good storytelling. I.E. diversity over meritocracy, talent kick to the curb to give someone a hand out.
Ugh Disney sucks
Matt is a real one for asking Tom Cruise to fight housing prices 😂
Proganda was illegal thank Obama who legalized it
MatPat's successor: MatGPT
I don't need propaganda to think favorably of AI. And if AI is endorsed, then this will open up room for smaller studios to compete with the big ones, even without as much budget, creating more competition, as well as allowing more expressive freedom. Although the current capitalistic model is turning a good thing sour, as when people become obsolete - they lose their means to sustain their lives, rather than just having more free time for themselves.
Add to it the "clean" look of these polished new films with heavy post-processing and CGI, helps make it seem to fit in already. Infinite content generation is coming soon...
how about "Chappie", personally I loved that movie
We need that 40k in theaters now so a Techpriest reminds us of the horrors of Abominable Intelligence.
Wow it's amazing that a guy with millions that watch his show realizes propaganda is a thing.
If ur this thoughtless and dafff i guess this has an effect in u Oh lord thats 80% of the population. AI god save us
This isn't a theory.
Can you do a hazbin hotel theory please🙏
AI will be bad until it is regulated. And it should be regulated with harshness and force. Identity theft is terrible.
"It all began in California with a little girl raised by 2 moms"?! I thought the army had brains in their heads.
Ai is as inevitable as the steam engine was 200 years ago. People who dont have it will lose, whether that be militarily, economically, or politically, even socially. The people who do have it will win. We can argue all day about it's morality, but you'd just as well argue the morality of the existence of the internet. It's everywhere and in everything, even your coffee machines. Soon, so will ai.   The funny part to me is how disney and other media corps will drive themselves out of business. If i can tell a personal ai "take the mistborn trilogy books and generate a movie trilogy as if it had been written and direct by Guimo Del Torro, and it can, what do we need disney for? Yes it eliminates writers, but it also eliminates corpos.
The Jetson family is propaganda in hindsight. "Welcome technology" Every story has messages. The question is how political
Mattpatt glances at the already blatant message disney already pushes and then looks away and then goes on about AI.
We could also just cause the apocalypse and make it so that they can't make any more films
Wait- we can all agree that Nazis = Bad? I know a large swath of government officials that are remarkably reluctant to denounce those ideals.
In my opinion, AI is just a tool. One that is useful in some stuff, but also useless in other stuff. One instance may look like you, sound like you, or even act like you, but it ain't in the real world.
I just hope this video gets just as many views as needed
Well we a know Skynet will be self aware.
Mattpatt officially jumped the shark with this one.
I have hated Disney ever since I was a little kid. It's just instictive, I suppose. I don't think becoming more culturally familiar with China is a bad thing. Peace is based on common ground.
Yeah, it's pretty obvious in recent years. They pushing wokeness HARD
You are masking the real problem, being extreme racism and feminism. ⚠
I hated the creator just for the fact it was pushing this idea of AI sentience rights, and AI good guys, bow down and let them be equal or superior. I loved the idea of the film, I just didn't like that it pushed so heavily for AI to be this good guy that is "oppressed", what are factories gonna have rights now, our computers, our cars? Just wait till the day your car is suing you for slamming on the brakes too hard one day, or not giving it enough gas constantly, you deprive it of cleaning every now and then.
You should make a theory about can you Wonka movie and his timelines pls
No way the old intro
We got the iconic film theory intro!!!
Sounds like matpat is scared to be replaced
“And as always friends I’ll see you next week”   Don’t do that to us man. Please
The first 5 seconds of this episode sounded just like pre 2016 mat pat
Already knew this make something new
crazy how he says knowlege is power when matpat doesnt even know the diffrence between marines and army.
I can't believe you guys depicted Michael Bay using Nice Peter's cosplayed as him from an ERB
Tom Cruise "Deflate Gate" (Housing prices going DOWN!)
there’s this plot point in the netflix animated series bojack horseman, where bojack runs off set and completely disappears during the middle of shooting an upcoming movie. when bojack finally returns he realizes that the movie was still able to be complete with bojack still being the star. the director explains that the “two nerds” that scanned his face before the movie was able to use that to help finish producing the movie. infact the performance was so compelling that the director chose to replace all the scenes with this deep faked bojack. so he technically wasn’t even in the movie, the same movie he tries to win an oscar for.   the season was released sometime around 2017 (i could be wrong) and to its credit this show was ahead of its time on its discussion of most “hollywoo” behavior we see called out in real life today, such as the me too movement. my belief is that they have been using ai this whole time and we need to pay attention because the same people who are trying to convince us that AI is ok now are the same people who use to warn us against the advances of AI once before.
You mention Independence Day not getting the military’s seal of approval. And now I’m wondering if Stargate did, as Independence Day was originally written as a sequel to it, but was rewritten to remove all ties to the original.
My only hope is that we've had enough anti-AI messaging to keep this at bay for enough years that we can fugue stuff out first
who all misses Matpat.
4:02 correction: we aren’t seeing a new rise of propaganda. All media has been propaganda of some kind for decades.
The old intro got me crying 😭
Raised by two moms.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 America is gonna crumble
But what about the other propaganda they've been pushing?
For some mysterious reason, I feel the need to post the word 'fnord'.
Why is there so many auto corrects?😮
I want you to say MatPat😢
Please day😢
Quite ironic that matpats video starting with ai gets attacked by bots
I was never against using AI for anything. I am against the people using AI as an excuse to rip off others.
I'm just commenting for the algorithm. Have a good day.
Let's face it Mat, the last outings by modern day "writers" have been pretty dismal and deserve to be replaced by AI.  But, let's face it: the true agenda is about "representation" and "diversity".
12:18 Exactly!! I'd be worried if people were still watching Disney movies...
I’ll get along to watch The Marvels…eventually
I know AI is inevitable, and can truly be used for good and to improve lives.  But big mega corporations are the last thing me or anyone would trust with that technology. This is a terrible era for AI technology to emerge.
It all connects now. Gaming industry had lay off many of their workers, im thinking they will use AI as replacement.😢
Im surprised you didn’t mention Iron Man 3, the ending of Iron Man 3 is completely deep faked RDJ didn’t fill the ending at all due to injuries!!!
The quality of TV and film has declined dramatically under the current writers; AI could probably do a better job than them anyway. I'm not siding with Disney - I don't care for superhero movies and haven't watched one in years. But I do use AI daily and, if forced to pick sides, I'm not going to support a side that could potentially restrict my use of AI (especially if that side is also some elitist Hollywood writers).
Hey Matt before you go... I would love to see your take on how WOKE culture is destroying Hollywood. All the major studios seem to be suffering from this with their recent shows and movies! I think it is propoganda too and the public is rejecting it.
Good
Ha
dang, matt really brought back the old intro!🍸🗿
I swear to god mat pat, if you leave I I will destroy roblox
Theory?! 😂 any film pushing either the left or right ideology is propaganda
The Army commercials these days are so painful for me to watch. They're so manipulative.
That ain’t the only thing that Disney is propagating
I don't mean to detract from this tone of this episode at all but I did a full double take at 8:36 because no way Film Theory used an ERB clip??? Haven't watched that battle in a while, definitely took me by surprise!
This kind of AI is one thing.  But I've said it many times, if we get to a point where we have TRUE AI, that can be considered intelligence, and/or sentience.  We would have to see it as a person, it would be wrong to use that kind of thing as a rightsless workforce, it would deserve rights. It would be a person, just better for not needing to eat or sleep, even if they never became hostile they would simply make us obsolete.  We can never allow AI to get to that point.
While watching "The Creator" i was actually happy, untill after the movie where I realised how binary it was, thanks for bringing into light how the movie went completely in favour of AI. The only reason I don't think of it much is because i think the movie is more about American colonialism and post 911 immediate behaviour.  Please please please do an episode on this movie!
Weird detail im sure many people notice. in matpat's old videos he has the classic intro. however during the recent years he stopped. but since it his very last videos he is doing it again. we will miss you!
3 theories left😭
Love how they snuck in ERB Michael bay
8:46 My dad was actually an extra in Transformers 2! He was in a short scene where the camera sweeps over a bunch of men at attention when they drop off Optimus Prime’s body at a military base, and my dad is one of the guys holding a gun. My parents were enlisted in the Air Force, and we were probably stationed in New Mexico by then. We call it his 5 Minutes of Fame and we always pause it on the frame where we can see him. I think he said he got a couple hundred or thousand bucks to be an extra for that ONE scene (I asked him this a couple of years ago, so I don’t specifically remember how much he got paid. It’d been ~10 years since the movie and he didn’t quite remember either, he just remembered that it was a decent amount of money for a near 30-year-old with 3 kids).
Well, technically, everything currently happening is all machine learning, not ai
just want to call out that the so called army propaganda that you were saying is actually the marines ads which is way cooler.
I for one believe that any and all forms of media that has ai part of the creative process must state so explicitly
How to use clickbait without technically being clickbait
crazy almost like we all already knew this. and hes here to take credit
Film Fact: Disney is Making Propaganda fixed ur title
This is alarming news. Why hasn't it been out sooner?
The og intro being back makes me happy
Saw a comment on reddit earlier today. More or less saying, who's going to buy anything when no one is working? Who is disney going to sell it's slop to, when 3/4's of humans don't work anymore?
OH THE RETRO INTRO OH THE MEMORIES
Biden doesn’t know what day it is…😂
Meanwhile on Mr Robot: all governments are highly corrupted and openly conspire to let billionaires control the population through debt and poorness, anything resembling real life is pure coincidence
And now congress is talking about AI even more because of AI generated explicit images of Taylor Swift that were being shared on Twitter
We'll miss you, Matheww Patheww
besides the fact that ai is a really big scary deal, it would be nice seeing movies and videos made perfectly for you that can last forever, that's still in the future thought
*Ahem* even samsung is using ai 💀😇🙏
Mission impossible lol
Who would have thought the world governments would be pushing propaganda?? I bet there are a lot of movie about leading and renting and not owning anything while liking it.
A.I. is love. A.I. is life.  This was weitten by a real human person.
The real reason Disney sucks is because every time they release a movie or show, they use ChatGPT to write the scripts
I'm sorry but I'm not sure you can just make a gigantic a claim as the govt officially paid millions of dollars to TV studios in the 90's to have drug-related storylines w/o offering a shred of backup info on that. I'm not calling anyone a liar, but that seems like an important thing to be left out.
Using the og intro is just so special to me thank you matpat and co ur all so great
6:50 Christmas does that make rocky IV a Christmas movie
The OG intro took me BACK
So. Are we gonna talk wbout feminists propoganda too? We probably should.
I like that the old intro is back
The military has gone woke
Wow, this is the thinnest theory you have done in a very long time.
Hi friend
So glad the intro's back
2:08 Honestly I like to see ai using other people artwork not as theft but as inspiration. Think of us looking at a famous art and saying and making something in that theme, that not theft.
THE INTRO IS BACK
Two whole films, in the same year M3gan came out! "AI can be good, actually," was a major plot point in the Animatrix, minor in the second two theatrical releases, in those films it was humans who started the problem. Small Soldiers has a fairly implicit implication that it's not the tech but how it's implemented that determines whether it's good or bad, buried under an even less subtle don't judge a book by its cover, same thing with Data and Lore on Star Trek. In "War Games" the "malevolent AI" was trying to make a point about mutually assured destruction. Heck "Detroit become human" and Westworld are both about AI possibly being better people than we are.   The theme that AI isn't the boogie man is pretty old. Heck your Marvels example is more emblematic of an older trope, where a society ceases to function because a resource they were over reliant on was suddenly removed. Like Mad Max. Seems like you're cherry picking data.
Annnnd MatPat is subtly working on his racist attacks on Chinese.
Honestly I haven't trusted Disney for years. As you said, they would love to utilize AI to cut costs and pay as few employees as possible.
I went to see The Marvels. I also enjoyed it pretty well.
Love ai, not ai being used in the creative space though
Im so HAPPY you brought back the OG intro!😁
The more things change the more they stay the same
At this point, I’m surprised Disney hasn’t tried to sue Matpat Also, the princess bride reference was 👌
I ASKED + YOUR CONTENT IS GREAT + W + I HOPE YOU RETURN + HAVE A GOOD DAY
Would films like Chappie and AXL also fall into the "robots are good" recent additions? Because both of these titles hit my brain immediately when I was watching.
You say AI image generation “can’t create art out of nothing”, that “they have to be fed other art” to make what they make.  I never understood how that’s a criticism, because that’s exactly how human artists create art too. Every creative idea is necessarily built on existing ideas, experiences, and the work of others. No art is wholly original. Artists utilize their own unique mental collection of experiences and influences, and cannot create without it. No artist can create art without “stealing” from others, whether they’re willing to admit it or not.
I love how how you reincorporate old intros, love it man
My therapist: Bishonen MatPat isn't real, he can't hurt you.  Bishonen MatPat: 15:18
Man ... we gettin close to terminator day by day
8:00 - 8:15 gave me slight Fallout 4 Nuka World vibes (military was working with Nuka World boss) . Disney working with the military 😅…
China helped in The Martian book, as well. Though that might have been planned by the author, or an edit, for the same reasons.
Bold of you to assume Biden did this of his own accord. At least it was good this time.
Hmm.... I guess Pokemon is in it too... exept for the fact the A.I. IS EVIl during the paradise protection protocal phase
the only thing of A.I. program/robot i deeply want is that one particular hologram avatar computer generated from Blade Runner 2077 .. with an actual robot body .... as my girlfriend/wife ...
The wealthy have always tried to convince the masses that whatever makes them the most financially is somehow beneficial to everyone.
He is the thing, they are different things.  I am anti-"AI" generated art and media because it *isn't* AI which seems to continue to go over everyone's heads.  It is machine learning with curated data sets fed into them, isn't even remotely "AI" which is what makes it so easy to identify as "bad".  What some of the media that is "pro"-AI is *actually* about is artificial true sapience and how we should handle and treat true and sapient AI.  In that regard I whole-heartedly agree with treating them like people especially if we choose to make them.  Not only because they are people but from a more cynical point of view we should choose to do so before that choice is taken from us by AI that we have been abusing.  Like others have said conflating the 2 and misrepresenting a few of these pieces of medias' messages is bordering on propaganda itself.  The basic point he is trying to push still stands, if it isn't sapient it shouldn't be allowed to make "art" from mashed together bits of other people's art and replace actual people.
goodbye we will miss you
Question is, who didnt know this? Propaganda is everywhere.
So this is how the republic dies, with thunderous applause.
sorry mat but for the deepfake luke imo the reason the response was less harsh was bcz mark hamill actually agreed and was fine with it while with leia and tarkin they literally tried to bring back dead actors
Maybe Universal will catch this pro AI trend and finally release their adaptation of Scythe by Neal Shusterman
This is definitely not the only propaganda Disney puts out
Don't just look towards knowledge.  Knowledge is only facts.  Look towards wisdom... the ability to utilize knowledge in it's proper way.
Disney is all propeganda. Kids wont even be watching the channel, they beocome crazy if I change it. Just a big walmart commercial for their products. Literal brainwashing. You dont even want to know about the Walmart part of the plan. K❤️‍🔥🇺🇸
I mean Disney sucks now anyway soo
PORK CHOP SANDWICHES!
Is there a reason there is a misquote at 18:05? I’m pretty certain it’s RIGHT hand..
I have a theory for everyone. One of the last theory’s is going to be spider man swinging, from the Film Theory intro.
I disagree because the individual may not only forget to check up on 'facts' regurgitated to them... but also group think... cliches as it were... can sway their viewpoint or they become ostracized by the heard they have built an 'identity' around.
The OG intro hits hard!
I am genuinely scared. I got into a debate just today. I’m an artist, I want be a voice actress and animator, but the past month on deviantart alone 10 out of 11 pieces of art are AI, it’s rare to find original pieces. I’m scared, and I am struggling to find comfort because it’s a fear that could essentially change my life
amazing video
😂 Disney has been making propaganda longer than you've been alive Matt. I thought you were leaving? Is this written and read by your Al replacement?
Terrifying.
Has Matt been red pilled?
Was that frog reference a tiktok thing?
So happy that they brought back to he old intro
Tom Cruise should promote Socialism as we need Universal Healthcare and UBI
so we're gonna have our own version of mandela catalougue but with ai
Report and ignore all the bots u see guys, replying to them means u just let them win
They also constantly promote diversity to encourage mass migration and demographic change and then use identity politics to drive groups apart. That way were too busy killing each other instead of them.
Remember the Top Gun Maverick the second beginning scene that features Taiwan flag on the back of Tom Cruise’s jacket incident, the flag changed to UN flag after the Chinese film investor complaint, then changed back to Taiwan flag after the Chinese film investor quite the production.
This is a really good episode... 😢sorry .. some thoughts are in the back of my head...😢
I get this. It is clearly slanted but the vehement anti technology argument is way too hardcore as well. We should not be using it so rampantly in our media but we should also not make AI to be the problem. Capitalism and content farming as well as unscrupulous leaders are the problem. The tech need to be used right but it should still be used.
9 hours omg
It could also just simply be that everyone has AI on there minds so they write stories about AI and want to try AI out. Not saying that all movies dont have purposely placed AI propaganda, but I feel like this is lacking rigorous  multilevel data.  And in the marvels, the big problem was because Captain Marvel left the planet right after destroying their most important infrastructure and leader. Power vacuums tend to destroy things.
I was surprised by how bad the quality was for the A.I. voice over because there are plenty of videos on the internet where it sounds much closer to Matthew. 2:40
Matpat saving the planet from AI takeover is WILD
AI supplants humanity at it's core.
God, I wish we could all agree Nazis are bad.
For anyone who's curious how this is playing out in real life: My work dropped a LinkedIn training that's supposedly about "increasing communication" but is really about training your "well-prompted AI ally" (exact words).
Imagine in the future they make an AI bot that is Matpat
i thought matt was just gonna go full redpill "DISNEY IS SPREADING WOKE GARBAGE" knowing that he could finally be himself because of him leaving
We going to miss our Diet Coke lover and childhood friend for us to watch we will miss you matpat have fun with you family also can you maybe do another Godzilla and probably super Mario and fnaf theories and analog horror
We also see it in the Star Wars games with BD-8
This is propaganda as well, I wouldn’t call that bad though.
It hurts my soul knowing who’s art that Foxy coloring page was trained on 😭
MatPat going to show us that we’re all just slaves to the overlord. Whatever they push, we follow.
I got and ad here about generative AI
Day 114 of asking film theorists to make a video about JackStauber.
Biden literally sh*t himself and mumbled something about AI
Why did the thumbnail look like an old Game Theory thumbnail, no joke I said to myself “Why is YouTube recommending me old Game Theory Videos?”
Michael Bay is definitely one of the Worst offenders when it comes to Propaganda in films, I remember Transformers 1, 2 and 3 along with his other films he had free reign to use Military Vehicles thanks to the US Department of Defense at the time  Look at all the Vehicles used, they're all active vehicles either still in service or limited swrvice
Man Fall of the House of Usher was so fantastic
Please do a game theory about that level again it has a lot of lore
Face copying technique, eh. You know what else that reminds me of? Selling say, private body poses, to the media. Once you see it that way, there’s no going back.
What if matpat is making a arg about his disappearance and we have 3 month or he disappears
5:44 How dare you give the Army credit for the Marine lava monster commercial.
What if the only reason movies are being written pro Al is because they are being written/ produced by ai.
And there's a new Tron movie on the works, I'm a Tron fan but, I'm more worried than excited about it
I was really hoping matpat was going to expose the child trafficking ring that Disney is part of and talked about how Hollywood feeds us all propaganda 😔
I would trust Baymax with my life, dunno about another other machine or AI though
I live how no one ever mentions that movie with Haley Joel Osment literally CALLED A.I. 😅  (A.I.: Artificial Intelligence - 2001)
His voice is just a little too high in the example but it’s interesting close
I don’t understand I thought he left…
I... Watched this before immediately going to a clip from an AI vtuber doing her stream. I know that wasn't Disney but still...  We're doomed aren't we?
The Army ads I grew up with were the Army Strong ones with that REALLY badass sounding theme song. Born in '06 into an Army family. It happens. Don't like these new ones too much
This isnt what quiting YouTube looks like Matt.
It’s been too long since we’ve last had the intros on the channels.
Reboot Johnny 5!!!!
Would a solution be that we just need laws saying that anything digitally generated by an AI cannot be considered the property of an individual or corporation? So if a video game studio used AI generated assets, those same assets could be legally used by anyone in competing games?
Or is this propaganda?
this is sad, we wouldn't have astarion with IA
please be careful Disney will assassinate you
Yep. This has happened before and it worked… 🌈
Ai is like mice. One mouse, contained, is kind of cute and you might even find yourself empathizing with it and taking care of it.  Billions of Mice, which is what the infinite simultaneous instances of generative AI software are like, are an infestation that will devour your food, then your home, then your body alive in their ravenous, infinite hunger. Do not be fooled. Just because one of something isn't a threat doesn't mean it will never be a threat even at a bigger scale.
But that's just a theory
Moscow on the Hudson was anti-communist and pro-american propaganda
Genuine question, was that storyline in house of usher promoting or even normalizing AI? I thought it was the most legitimately creepy thing in that whole show.
My husband wanted me to watch the Creator but when he was giving me the elevator pitch and I realized it was about pro-AI cuties being prosecuted by mean ol' luddites I lost interest in ever seeing it. Pro-AI people are simply too pollyannaish.
NO, THE PLOT POINT OF THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USER WASN'T POINTLESS, that is lenore, and this IA replaces the crow from the edgar alan poe with the iconic phrase NEVER MORE.................................................................................................
we are getting closer and closer to the Terminator movies being real as time passes
9:54 I don't want to disagree with a legend but The Martian (Ridley Scott) was based on Andy Wier's novel which was published 4 years prior.
Yo the og intro really hit me with the nostalgia
A what point will we get fully personalized movies?
Well this was depressing :/ So what's left now tho? If this is what's coming, it leaves an empty feeling if you're gonna be forced to experience it tbh What's left for those of us who wanna go try our luck in the industry?
Disney more like Dispee.
Can you make SpongeBob theroy
How do we know this episode wasn't written & performed by AI? For all we know the "AI MatPat" segment was a misdirect so we wouldn't realize the real MatPat wasn't voicing the rest of the episode
hahaha, this video is propaganda. wont fool me Mat
THE CLASSIC INTRO!
2:32 The matpat ai has been getting stronger since the streamies
Domain expansion: AI is cool.
To quote metal gear solid 2 the memes
I've actively been not watching anything Disney related, so I didn't even notice. I was like, "Disney using propaganda? No chinga! Tell me more, ese!"
That intro gives me massive nostalgia
Ai is disgusting.
It isn't AI Itself is the Problem, It's how it's Used by Socio-Political-Economic Systems, And the way it's Used is Horrible Because of the Bourgeois State, Corporations and the Other Owners of Capital.
Why do I suddenly want Adobe Illustrator?
yea. Corridor media is on it too. Stopped watching their content when they pushed AI too much on their videos.
Mat theory
EVERYTHING is turning to AI these days, and every major company is trying to shove it down our throats. Just go Google Image search pretty much anything and tell me how many images it takes before you get to something AI generated. I'm willing to bet that it's less than a few dozen images at most. It's so wild that AI is being pushed so hard when it's been proven time and time again to be filled with inaccuracies or just straight up false information. Google even has AI results as the VERY FIRST THING it shows you when you search for something. And that's not even mentioning how ChatGPT has been getting stupider and stupider over the past few months, going from "Eh, it's alright but nothing amazing" to "What sort of nonsense are you telling me?"
Another one is that anime studios are starting to use A.I. to translate the shows because people were changing the lines too much.
Detriot become human coming in real life?
Coraline has lots of LOOOORE!
Always has been.
Except "AI" bots ARE the future. That's not a Disney thing, it's just a fact for anyone with a brain who understands the technology.
❤️THE INTROOO‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️OH MY GGG!!!! I HAD TO DO A DOUBLE TAKE ON THE UPLOAD DATE!!!!! OG FOR THE WIN‼️‼️
I know it's insane to most of the AI enthusiasts out there, but we can and probably should live without AI tech. It is completely non-essential, and provides no actual value to society that we cannot do ourselves. Using AI as a cheap replacement for humans in media and art is going to become a problem, and clearly we've been able to go over 40 years since the dawn of modern computers without something like AI.
Matgpt sounds nothing like you mat you got no problem
Nah it's cuz biden just signs anything
Speaking of Chinese propaganda, somehow I ended up talking with my students about The Meg 2 (sadly, not the worst movie I saw last year). They complained that the lead actress from the first film, Bing Bing, didn't return. I was happy to point out to them what happened to Bing Bing when her salary became public. She was disappeared from the public for a few months then returned, apologizing for making too much money, and supporting new laws that limited actor salaries.
Depends on how it's done, assuming they get proper concent and they don't throw it in my face like people do with political matter it doesn't really matter to me. But  if they somehome copied the likeness of someone I can't wait for the law sue, because if you copy someone's likeness and put them in a movie assuming the individual notices even if they are a background character it shows that that individual consented to being both in a movie sponsoring by ___ or that they even agree with deepfacks ingeneral. Which could be harmful to their reputation (like could you imagine if a socialist was depicted as a background character on a military base in Iron man?)
I don’t even think this is a theory anymore, it’s practically fact…
Milk was also snuck into the Transformers movies, too. Specifically, "Shuhua Milk" as it was called, and was featured in the 3rd and 4th movies, albeit briefly
And all I see is propaganda
"AI" isn't even AI. All this fearmongering and bs is just that. It would be hilarious if it wasn't so actively harmful to such a useful technological innovation.
Wow first it's feminist propaganda and now it's AI. Get these strong lady robots out of my face!
I thought Matpat left YouTube
I LIKED THE MARVELS Y'ALL ARE HORRIBLE
I am shocked at the way you peddle this anti-AI propaganda. I for one look forward to serving our future robot overlords and humbly servicing their beneficence. I would unsubscribe and block your channel, but I think some fleshlings need to keep tabs on you.
I love matpat! Yippie! 😊❤🎉
i thought u quit but it's good to see u again
Whenever I see an outrageous theory I'm like "Yeah right" then I see it's from one of the _Theory!_ channels and all of a sudden I'm interested .
16:35 By the way, I really think that Disney needs to stop trying to revive people that have already passed into the hereafter. I think it's just disrespectful and unhonorable to re bring an artificial deep fakes of the actors/characters in their stories. It makes me unnerved. It makes me want to literally go down to disney Land Or Disney World and protest the AI subjected  images. Why can't people just use live action and no visual effects? I know some movies need them, but why can't we be smarter? Technology is what's gonna doom us
A.I. MatPat sounds so weird
A pro China slant..  I see what you did there.
Idk, I could tell something was up with the Indiana Jones face
I believe that “Every Ganda is propaganda” basically meaning that every opinion has a bias, no matter how small it is. Propaganda is in everything and we are only oblivious to the ones we accept. We will disagree with the “A.I. is good narrative”, but whole heartedly believe in “A.I. is bad” or “ A.I. coming for my job” one. Propaganda has no sides, any and every one can use it.  “Knowing is half the Battle”
Thank you for another informative video like this MatPat.
the retro intro. thats nostalgia
ITS RAP BATTLE MICHAEL BAY! LETS GO NICE PETER!  Now can we get epic Lloyd in here?
So..... Detroit Become Human?
Thank you so much for covering this topic. More people really need to know how harmful it’ll be and how damaging it could be come to thousands of people who already live, at times, really difficult lives trying to persue careers in the arts, writing, film, and games.   AI voice generators have already been used to mislead and disenfranchise voters through deepfake robo calls. The risks posed by AI go far beyond the entertainment industry, and have been used to doctor fake imagery for the sake of propaganda.
They did it they brought back the BEST INTRO finally
If you can't tell the difference between something made by a human and something made by AI, then does it really matter as a consumer? 🤷‍♂
I like that there is a photo from "The Princess Bride."
Friendly and unfriendly AI characters have been around for decades  They may just want to be optimistic about the rise of AI in real life
5:47 This is a USMC add, not the Army, the branches have always had different marketing campaigns. The second add about the Patriot missile systems id Army though, just making sure your comparisons are accurate.
can you make godzilla x kong theory
I can’t wait until Disney collapses, they only way they survive is if they change their tactics, which they have no indication of doing
i missed this intro so much
Well, time activate my Chinese Mafia persona and prime the coconuts on my fists But not really, Ill use hagfishes instead
So if humans are bad and ai is good  what about mega man he is both human and ai so is he good or bad 😮
There's a simple solution - draft law or regulation where anything generated by AI can't be copyrighted. If the plot of the movie can't be copyrighted, the studio can't do anything about someone making a fully AI generated knockoff and dumping it free on the internet. The more of the visuals they let be whole-cloth generated by AI, the more of their film can be uploaded without recourse. That allows people to use it to its potential - something they will do anyway no matter what you do, while also giving a strong profit motive to pay actual humans to do what AI can do free so you can make money off it.  That said, 20 years from now you'll be able to buy consumer level AI software that will do what Hollywood does with it 10 years from now. If AI replaces your job, you are out of a job anyway. That is the march of technology. You aren't going to pay Disney for a non-AI movie if your neighbor down the street downloaded an open source AI that someone modded to generate just as good of content on demand for no cost to you. If you are one of the 0.0001% who REALLY care about this sort of thing, and aren't just thinking that you care now while it's in an abstract sense and you aren't actually paying the cost difference for non-AI, then you're probably going to live performances instead anyway.  We need to regulate what hardware AI is left in charge of because a biased AI in charge of a lethal drone is a recipe for atrocities, but generative AI is just a thing that will happen. Instead of protecting people's jobs, we need to dismantle the work-to-live social mindset and create a society where people can pursue meaningful existence that isn't defined by finding employment to feed their family.
Isn't he quitting? Is his voice AI?
Count Rugen had six fingers on his right hand. You can't fool me.
This doesn't contradict anything you said about the propaganda element of all this - thanks for that! - but the way American media handles AI has been pretty consistent over the decades and stems from the country's history of slavery. If AI/robots are enslaved, they're the good guys, even if they're not viewed as such initially. If AI/robots enslave others, they're the bad guys, even if only the main protagonist realizes it at first.
Aw man, I'm really gonna miss you when you go, MattPat. Been a fan for literally over a decade and the Tubes of You will not be the same without you deep diving into some of the most obscure things on the interwebs that most of us didn't even know we needed a deep dive or theory about. Good luck to you and your family in the coming future, and know that you will be missed but we wish you all the best!! <3

T2: The only thing that can save you from a bad AI with a gun is a good AI with a gun... Shut up, Knight Rider!   (random thoughts.  Great video!  Enjoy retirement! 😁✌🏼)
iRobot mention you love to see it
AI DO SOLVES problem with woke localizers tho... thats where I heavily favors AI over some overly political activists that pretending to be localizers. And I have seen the results of that AI which way more better than what I thought over what activists/localizers have done.
It's like every president should do at least one thing big based off observing fiction.
The best intro is back
I don't think the Indiana Jones comparison is valid, because that was young Harrison Ford from Indiana Jones, used to make old Harrison Ford in the new Indiana Jones look younger. Where as the other instances were dead people pasted onto other actors faces, or at least young Mark Hamill pasted on to another actor's face. And as I understand it, Mark didn't even know it was happening for that cameo in Mandalorian.
Is there a website that lists out movies that were influenced by militaries or governments?
I love the creator a really good film
Duh
So will people be commiting seditoon against the gamers that are(not really) AI Presidents?
is it a theory if it's literally happening though
anyone else think the robot in 13:29 looks right out of Titanfall?
and then you look at soma
People should have a copyright claim to their likeness
We'll miss you if you leave the internet, MatPat! We love you! Please don't leave, man! Anyway, great video and content! I love your channel and hopefully you get a good successor host, dude! This is just internet gold! I love it!
What’s worse  That bit with voice A.I. was you not even trying. If you wanted to make it sound authentic you can tweak it.
Hasn’t Disney been doing propaganda stuff for awhile now?
Bro forgot about Megan
Common sense
OMG I literally jumped for joy when I saw and heard the film theory intro theme music and all!!!!! Thank you. I've missed it so much from your videos.
yoooo I loved the Creator 😭😭😭 absolutely balled my eyes out. But ya def seemed like AI propaganda
Anyone else look at Creator and get reminded of both Overwatch and Gen:LOCK?
That old intro song always reminded me of the “it’s raining tacos” song 😂 good episode guys. I have a friend who had a vision 20 years ago that told him that in the future, he would be fighting over what the definition of consciousness is.
You have to watch “Ron’s gone wrong”
I don’t feel like AI is good or bad. I feel like it all depends on how it’s used
Disney today only release woke content.
I'd always wished that the Theorist channels pointed out more important irl details like these. I hope this is a more common direction going forward.
Okay, what did Disney doing with Thailand? At least 2 series that i know got thai protagonist. Anne Bunchoy of Amphibia and Molly McGee of the ghost and molly McGee. Why thailand, why not idk, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines maybe. What is the Disney grand plan here.
Mat pat stirring up all the soup brained right wingers with this one
If you thought Disney would be willing to go bankrupt while killing us all, you were mistaken
The AI Reveloution has just begun.....
wow, im actually reading i robot RIGHT NOW
I think it would be so fun to see an episode on one of the channels completely made by ai. except for maybe editing since I don't know if ai could do that. but just have ai generate a script on some theory, have matgpt say the script, and throw it out onto youtube and see how it performs
In a future I will be saying "I was pro AI before it was cool". Regarding those examples. AI = BAD is a cliche, so it feels natural that eventually creators would go against this cliche. And they did started to do it long before Generative AI. The a lot of movies with good AI.
From the leaked zoom calls we know of their groomer propaganda
I would say theur promotion of the alphabet people is a bigger thing garbage disney is pushing
I rarely comment on Youtube videos and I have nothing substantial to contribute but I am commenting purely in the hopes that one more person will be recommended this video.
No please don’t quit
it took you normies this long to realize? for a theorist channel, it's disappointing it took you this long to cover it. Whenever anyone right of Stalin calls it out it's a "conspiracy theory".
10:02 I wanna see this. I always thought it would be cool to have alternate movie versions for different markets. Like a chinese version of pacific rim.
I'd use MatGPT.
Spoiler warning on the movie The Creator would have been nice
Mat pat I'll miss you :(
Do another hazbin hotellll about alastor and Lilith
Propaganda is only an issue because most people lack self-awareness. It is easier to go with the flow and accept what authoritative figures tell you to think, than to follow your own beliefs. And then there are the people who think they are acting out to rebel against societal norms only to fall into another trap without knowing it.
HE BROUGHT THE INTRO BACK
At this point, you need a private security bodyguard armed to the teeth to follow you everywhere to stop the hitmen
My jaw actually dropped when I saw the old intro
Its currently  a rainbow push
Pluto, la serie de Netflix, la adoro, habla sobre IA, sobre que nos diferencia, que nos une, hay IA malvada si (según entiendo aún no la termino) pero la IA es buena en la serie, la sociedad convive con ella, tiene vidas y todo, algunos la tratan mal pero son representados como idiotas en la serie, es bastante buena pero no me di cuenta de la propaganda que era, la terminaré eso es seguro pero me aterra la idea de que me comí un anuncio (en parte) sin darme cuenta
I honestly think that AI not always being the bad guy in these movies now is just because AI is more publicly visible and filmmakers are exploring the concept of AI beings more.
I dont think biden said too much about anything
Ya think? Since 2010!
I feel sorry for the people that have a president that changes rules based on the movies he has seen...
Theories remain thing is kinda creepy to be honest
2:08 I believe it’s theft because a lot of the time, the art is used to train the ai without consent of the creator. It’s gotten so bad that people have started creating tools to protect art when people attempt to use it to train an ai
Yeah babe old intro is back
No way that means FNAF has A.I propoganda!!! (joking, but strange 🤔)
I really missed that opening :'D
It’s not really a theory if it’s something everybody already knows to be true… 👀
AI really, really scares me. Not only is it concerning to think about how it’s taking away jobs, but I’m also terrified that one day, we’re going to end up in a world where human beings are no longer able to create art and that all media will one day be created by AI. Books, movies, tv, music, everything. I’m praying that this doesn’t happen, of course, but it certainly seems like we’re headed in that direction
It is really sad how Disney and other production companies are resorting to CGI and Ai just to save a pretty penny. I really dislike it and want to see actors make a comeback along with real locations with real interactions. It is one thing if it's once in a blue moon but to use it for every movie is just downright lazy and takes jobs from others who need a source of income in a world where technology is taking over.
Congratulations, you've told us what Overlord DVD, The Critical Drinker, Midnight's Edge, Heel vs Babyface, Tyrone Magnus, Yellow Flash, and Clownfish TV have been telling us for years!
The CEO bob iger is jewish
yashuop really be making matpats final theories ruined.
8:36 Lol that's Michael Bay from Epic Rap Battle.
THANK YOU MATPAT AND TEAM THEORIST FOR TEACHING THE YOUTH ABOUT PROPAGANDA
As a counterpoint it might be we’re seeing more AI good guys because more writers are gamers or former gamers. All of us have grown up with friendly AI companions. Yes they may be on the dumb side, but when you’re in a situation where you’re as likely to see AIs as your battle companions, minions or neighbors maybe it’s harder to see AI as just being skynet or Hal.
All this talk of A.I. and not one mention of our A.I. Queen Neuro-Sama.
I think it’s important to note that the characters in Fall of the House of Usher that were pushing AI, were the villains. Generally, if the villains of a story are supporting something, then the story is saying that it’s bad.
Tbh, I never agreed with the idea that Ai has to be evil. Just like humans Ai being could be good or evil. I don’t want Ai or deepfakes to go away. I see it as the future and as long as we don’t use it for bad things then there you go Ai is fine. Now you can say,”well people could use it badly so we need to get rid of it.” Well then let’s get rid of guns or tv or video games or books or even speech or hands because anything can be used badly but that doesn’t make it bad. It’s all based on how you use it.

I love using propaganda against propaganda. Thanks G.I. Joe! "I'm doing my part!"
Perfect time to make the “Book good, phone bad” meme now. Boomers are onto something after all
I, for one, welcome our new A.I overlords.
16:46 I didn’t mind this specific case. Because Mark Hamill himself is still alive. He was able to give his direct consent.  I believe doing this with deceased actors is entirely unethical. Regardless whether or not their family or estate approve.   i believe only the original person has the right to approve/disapprove of how their likeness is used
he’s only posting these now because he’s leaving💀

The real new propaganda being pushed by Disney is the LGBTQ movement
In case they're reading this, I would just like to state for the record that I was welcoming of our AI overlords before the propaganda push began.
I haven't watched the last two film theories. How long has he been playing the original theme intro. Is this the first time or the 3rd time.
I always distrusted AI and now I feel that no business should have access to the more modern AI, but allow them to use technology that is dependent on humans. And now I’m certain that this will lead to hot topics in the future. So thanks MattPat for this episode.
I will do one push-up for each like this gets
I miss the old intro❤❤❤❤❤
i have enjoyed using AI for small things here and there. have it create a magic: the gathering decklist to use against my friends (it made a goblin deck), or images depicting inside jokes in my friendcircle, but i've always thought that it has extreme nefarious usecases in the cases of e.g elections. i just imagine politicians having their team conjure bs like phone conversations, or videos that misrepresents somebody, or even worse: claiming bs they HAVE DONE to be made by AI as a way out. but at some point in time pictures were the most solid forms of evidence you could have, and humanity have developed ways to figure out if images have been edited or not so i assume there are ways/they are developing ways to figure out whats AI or not....
Uhh yeah, have you seen the output since Frozen.  There is a reason I have made so much money shorting them it’s insane
MatPat dgaf he’s connecting the dots for us now that he’s boutta leave anyways 😭
no wonder he’s quitting soon, matpats gonna go missing if he keeps this up
Note: not real Michael Bay by ERB
Can we please talk about the Disney's misanderist agenda?
Every single time I saw a trailer for "The Creator" I was like "this is pro ai propaganda"... I knew it lol.
More fake news than Trump’s outlandish conspiracy theories and bad takes on government. 😂
Dont leave
Housing pricing is affected by government artificially restricting it through excessive regulations, restrictive zoning, by international corporations buying up neighborhoods to turn into rentals, property size increases, and generally supply and demand.
Thank you for addressing this, matpat ❤
Yo! People spamming “I’m better then matpat” please stop its getting fazing annoying
Good luck bub
I’m worried about AI but would gladly let it take over woke Hollywood
Pretty sure Disney's Strange World is a propaganda movie hiding in a kids movie.
The recent SAG-AFTRA announcement about a deal with voice over AI “replicas” was not approved with any of the actual voice actors despite announcing it had been approved. There was a huge backlash… and then the story disappeared.
Disney has been doing this for years
Disney making real clone troopers now
You’re retiring… just use AI Matt
I swear people are using Ai to replace all the fun jobs that people do because they’re passionate about it
Mattpat isn't holding back in last series of vids! Anyone can get it right now lol
Seems like the line between "propaganda" and "theme" is becoming more blurred.
I will do one one handed pushup for how many likes I get on this comment(I can only do 3 one handed)
i understood, but what is the solution, now that i know that we are doomed?
Keep in mind though, due to how porpaganda works, this video itself could be propaganda. For all you know (right or wrong), MatPat, based on the video, probably dislikes A.I., enough to warn about it. That doesn't mean he's wrong to say what he's saying, but you need to be the judge yourself; you need to use your own brain. Spend hours reading, do your own research and don't trust others to do it for you.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees! i was there. when film theory was created and left on read for YEARS!!  ....le siiiiiiiiiiiigh... :3
You sound like a conspiracy theorist Matt. I love it
Istg these people in charge need to read I have no mouth but I must scream…
nooo matpat dont feed into the alt-right talking points

its old its gold its back
Whatever, Disney can have all the ai they want doesn’t matter when in the end people don’t watch it. Because if all the animators and writers and voice actors are fired for ai I wonder who people are gonna side with?
i agree with the whole point but the house of usher example isnt totally solid the ai crumbles as lenore dies and repeatedly repeats the word nevermore and torments the patriarch with the mutated conciousness of his granddaughter till he meets his end. its used as a message of hubris and that death comes for us all and any attempt to defeat it and beat fate will only hurt the people around you.
A.I. seems to be ugnoring the use of Asimov's three laws of robotics.
If deepfakes HAVE to become inevitable, at the very least I hope it's mandated that the usage of AI is made obvious for any consumer, like nutrition labels on the back of supermarket foods. That way, it's easier for us to make a conscious choice to promote human-made works of art instead.
I knew this was happening but thank you for reminding me
Some of this as it came out... but there are a couple I def missed.   No one is immune to propaganda. No one.
well your also capable of outputting propaganda mat pat and it sounds like it to me not ever show that involves ai that isn't explicitly evil isn't propaganda maybe the creators just wanted to make a cool show about ai   the real threat here isn't ai it's asshole mega companies who only care about money  using the works of other people to make a new image isn't that what everybody does those writes and rich helpless actors do all the time but no it's bad when the average person gets access to creative spaces  and you are seeming very hostile and fear mongering about all this all that is needed like bidden started is to have stronger laws about ai not try and imply that it's completely evil irredeemable propaganda if someone beats someone to death with a hammer what are you going to lock up in prison the murderer or the hammer
Iron man 1 makes me wanna eat dirty take out cheeseburgers...
keep in mind the reason that the luke being younger thing wasnt seen  as negative is cause the actor isnt dead so they had to get his consent
Channel name says theory but all I heard was FACTS
old intro back ive been sking for years
Original intro!!!
Tbh I didn't know the creator was a Disney movie. Probably cause it was actually good.
This is gonna be insenstitive but as someone who loves doodling, watching art channels, listens to / plays music, I think creative arts like this will turn more into hobbies than job opportunities. I'd love to do what I love to make money, but what if that thing is collecting figures or cosplay? It's entertainment, and things like creating music or making art is just becoming hobby things now. Consumers consume art, thats the entire demand of it.
Hey Mattpatt I'm wondering if you could cover the analog horror series called welcome to dreamworld?
Therapist: Hyper realistic MatPat can’t hurt you, it isn’t real. Hyper realistic MatPat: 2:41
as soon as i finished the video the add that I got was talking about AI was helping somebody make images... ya this may be an issue
can you also fight homework Tom Cruise and begging you
Ai is actually really cool though. The propaganda isn't even necessary, because people just stop caring as something becomes the status quo. You don't hear horse breeders protesting against cars anymore, do you?
I disagree with the fall of the house of usher example. that show is bloody fantastic and Madeline's motives for AI align perfectly for her character. and her development and use of it had sound resolutions, and reasons. Shes trying to escape an unstoppable demise, and the AI doesnt work in the end anyway. The subplot of AI in that show does not reflect kindly on AI or the motives behind it at all
Took you long enough
I love AI. Its my job so im 100% all for AI.
8:37 a wild Nice Peter appears
In fairness to the fall of the house of usher, the ai ends up not working and malfunctioning, acting as a sick mockery of the person it’s imitating instead of a perfect clone
I remember being really tired of all the evil robots in media and wishing there were more sympathetic artificial intelligence characters. Now it’s not the robots that are evil, it’s the corporations funding them to push bad business practices. We are truly approaching dystopia.
FINALLY!!!! THE FILM THEORY OPENING THEME!!!!🥹 AGAIN, I DONT KNOW WHY THE OPENING SONGS WERENT USED AND IT ALWAYS BUMMED ME OUT. BUT THE FT ONE HAD BEEN TOO LONG!🥲❤  Also, that was also the problem and why the strikes were a pain to. AI again is also being looked at again, but, Sag-Aftra is not helping... So, yes, just from the opening alone, the only trusted AI is calculator
As much as I hate A.I, I don't think this script was very unbiased.
A Scythe/Thunderhead movie coming in by any chance?
id take AI matt pat over no matt pat 😭😭😭
Ah... Yes, there was another MI movie last year 😅 time to resub to paramountplus...
Matt...did you actually watch The Fall of the House of Usher? Just wondering.
If artists wanna survive and thrive in this climate. Theyre gonna have to implement Ai into thier work 😕🤷
7h
Weird though how your AI voice sounds.. funny? Like. It sounds off.
Pretty good, in my church we learned about being careful on what you watch and hear because while it does seem like a silly movie, small things can go into your subconciouns without realizing it, and whatever you watch or hear over and over it can start developing you in different ways... Like "you are what you eat" in a way. And in many ways you can't just give a person something big to chew right away, it is always gonna be subtle, the more a person is use to it, the more acceptable it is and becomes the new normal. It is very interesting yet scary.
12:30 ???? Yeah ofc the world falls into peril when you rip out it's regulator in a single moment
I’m fully convinced that Matpat is rewatching community
Also you are the only Youtuber who actually shows the audience not just their point of view.
sad to see you go but somethings must come to an end
Omg my jaw dropped when I saw the intro That was such a nice surprise! ❤
Woke Disney too
mmmmm those original openings
Ignore the bots and the “uttp” or whatever. We will always love you matpat!
I want good art and writing that makes us think and is enjoyable and effectively gets out needed messages. If a robot can do that better than me then great, sounds like we are gonna get some good content while also pushing ourselves to be better
Is it really propaganda though? AI destroying the world has become cliche at this point, so making films that show the opposite or more nuance is more interesting
WESTWORLD was an entire series that focused on AI robots revolting against "evil" controlling humans.
i watched war games when I was like 6. i didnt know what propaganda was, but i thought it was a really good movie
Disney is not a woke company it's a money driven one. The think the woke ideology make money and when it doesn't the move on to the next thing. AI and if that can't help make money or reduce cost the will move on to the next thing.
A smile comes on my face as the views go up
HE USED THE INTRO!
As someone who has studied this exact topic in uni. This is spot on.
Cant forget about the lgbt propaganda
Honestly at this point I expect at least 70% of the media I consume to be at least somewhat saturated with propaganda.
AI is gonna become part of the media. That’s the unfortunate truth. Soon, companies won’t need actors or writers or artists. And that’s unfortunate considering I want a career in that line of work.   But… there is still a silver lining.   Once AI becomes something all the big companies are using, small indie companies will form. Indie companies that might work on a lower budget, but use real actors, real music, real art, all created by REAL PEOPLE. Human soul will prevail as long as people are willing to keep it. Things will change… but we won’t be gone.  The AI technology may be impressive now, but who knows? Maybe in the distant future, products created WITHOUT AI might actually become more impressive than products created with AI.   Just a theory.
I thought matpat wants to stop yt
So... Detroit: Become Human?
As a writer and artist, I’m like ummmm all I do is read and learn and look at a bunch of stuff and then use that to produce new stuff. Why is the little robot any different. We both looked at waiting for Godot and Shakespeare and went “nice!” And then used what we learned from that for our own script
normalize using the term psyop I have a feeling that this is gonna be a major issue going forward.
I hope disney closes doors.
How does drug testing your kids prove who brought a joint into your house?   At most it says your kid smoked it once.
how bold of you of talking about propaganda and still ignoring the real propaganda hollywood is currently try to forcing us is not AI is "diversity and representation" Knowing is half the battle? you lost the battle
I gather the studios who are endeavouring to improve our opinion of the application of AI in the creative spaces, don't really understand what the consequences of highly developed AI creators will be.  The ultimate consequence of having AI visual art, music, and video production is that individuals will be able to unlock their own imaginations and bring their stories to life.  Instead of having to make do with generic stories, with hit and miss characters, we will be able to write our own stories for our own personal use (as well as entertaining our friends if we so desire).  We will even be able to be prompted by AI to help us create better stories based on our own ideas.  It's the dawning of bespoke art.  Something a studio should find terrifying as they won't be able to compete with our own imaginations.  This technology is exactly the same kind of breakthrough that the original industrial revolution provided, in that, it allows ordinary people to take action according to their own imagination, unlocking ideas and skills no one in history had ever seen before.  This is that event on steroids and in an even smaller timescale.
This was a bad theory. Your two points that push the title of the video are captain marvel, a movie pulling its AI character from the comics, and the creator, a movie that came from regency which fox happened to have a stake in when it got bought by Disney
There’s way too many bots and nice video matpat
I'm not super concerned with AI. (Frankly speaking that Genie can't be put back in the bottle even if we tried). I'm concerned about big corporations lobbying governments to prevent the democratization of AI tools. As this theory pointed out these big corporations are already using AI tools. The more the public has access to these tools the better off society as a whole will be.
Knowing is half the propaganda.
You're just now figuring this out?
I love how non partisan matpat  can make videos.
Omg yes he added the old intro ahhh
No one’s talking about the intro returning? No? Okay…
y'all agree that Hollywood is using propaganda to push AI, but argue it about far left ideology. GG
Star war?
Starship Troopers is old.
Alfa pig from Super Why is evil. 1. His name ALFA pig -> he wants to take over them and be the leader 2. He has all of there abilities (except for wonder red but she is useless) 3. He is probably fed up about being in the back all the time 4. When they first meet woofster and he defines menacing so Alfa pig needs to show him up by making the dragon nice The dog is also evil 1. He stays super close to super why 2. In the dinosaur episode, when no one knew which dinosaur it was the dog was disappointed in them for being so dumb because he is smarter than them all 3. He also has all of their powers (once again except the useless wonder reds powers) 4. The dog goes last and takes the middle because he is the boss 5. The episode where they get the dog he already has a collar when no one else does -> idk if that is important but… 6. He sits in the same car as super why 7. He is the only talking dog and he has a book about him 8. Kind of odd how he led them all to find the fact that he should be with them
love hearing that theme again
no we can't, we need you MAT!!!! DONT GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, ok ok sry lost my composure, but yea we don't know what they wanna propagandate us ;A;
Skynet won't be far long
At least Harrison Ford and Mark Hamil are alive to give their consent.   Carrie Fisher is dead and can't.   I think this is a concept of morality.   Should we use A.I. to resurrect deceased people?   If this is what the movie industry is pushing, I dare not fathom the possibilities within the music industry.
The advancement of AI is inevitable, but the way it's used isn't! Don't let them fool you with their poorly made propaganda!
Everyone hear who wants to see Matpat JR As a host some day! 👇
I'm pro-AI not out of fear of our near-future AI overlords, but because AI is inevitable. It's as dangerous and valuable as nuclear weapons and all the major players in the world stage will race for it. So, unless a big disaster occurs that incentivizes countries to come together to ban AI research, it isn't going anywhere.
Nostalgia chills for the OG intro. ♥♥♥♥♥
Art, music, lit, the list goes on.
mat pats retiring with a mouse shaped target on his back
@matpat Can you please do one over hello kitty!!!!!!!
I loved The Creator. It was such a good movie
Housing markets... not just prices.  Think about it.
I will say, that before the last couple of years, I haven't seen a single pro A.I. movie. Since SO 2001, all depictions of AI have been negative. The ideal would be a movie that balances the benefits and dangers of A.I. but it is kind of refreshing to at least see a different take on it.
It's also extremely easy to create and advance ai. In some cases it's as easy at hooking up a basic reading and organising program to google to create a simple search engine.
I think propaganda is extremely normal. What isn't normal are people who think their government doesn't practice propaganda
Really enjoyed the video, I do think that the ai mentioned in the fall of the house of usher wasn't really a pro ai narrative more of the set up for the twist and to show the main characters pain, buy again, great video and the whole think is so scary
One detail I find interesting is that, according to the Animatrix (the animated anthrology film set in the Matrix franchise), the Robots were peaceful as well, until Humans forced them into war.  The AI Citizens of 01, the first Robot city of the world, offered a peace treaty to the Humans, but the humans outright refused the offer, leading to the Robots instead offering an ultimatum.  Humans were also the ones that blacked out the sky, making the earth a cold and near inhospitable rock, leading to the need for robots to use humans as batteries.    My point is that even before Matrox 4, the Humans weren't the pinnacle of good and robots weren't the evil demons in the story. It's all much more gray
Whaaaaat the corporation that hires shreks offenders at its theme parks pushing propaganda? Noooooo definitely noooootttt
Well duh wish is the most obvious one its a socialist propaganda movie with out being a socialist propaganda movie.
When was the last time he used the intro? I felt like I just caught up with an old friend
remember if Disney copyright strikes this video then mat pat is right
Thanks for making us aware about this
riot games is making propaganda for their game "league of legends"
EVERYONE IF YOU SEE THIS COMMENT REPORT ANY UTTP SPAMMERS OR ELSE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SPAM
I'm totally on board, but I DO want to point out that the Chinese saving the day in The Martian is from the novel which came first.
I don't have anything against ai really, I mean, the art it makes is incredible, but sometimes it'll get things wrong, so I think ai art can never beat human art in terms of quality, but it definitely beats me at it(and it's so quick🤩)🤣🤷‍♀️👩‍🎨🤖🎨
The other big propaganda push I've been seeing is generally is China and the CCP are good, and "socialism is better than capitalism."
Not just A.I.  but regulate economic disparities, deregulation, inflation, tax cuts fir the rich, national debt, and disparities.   It goes beyond what you mention.   I shouldn't have to say it.  A tighter economy.... means a better outcome for you, me, and the rest of the world.... but that's hust a theoey... a money theory.
BABE WAKE UP THE FILM THEORY INTRO IS BACK
Idea for a law? "Artifical Intelligence will not be used for any Economical Function." AI still usable for research and development, but not being used by business, although it would slow down AI R&D (no investment since it provides no monetary return) Altogether it makes it better, because people choose to work on it, they choose to create and learn about it. Thoughts?
As if Giant corporations didnt need enough reasons for us to hate them.
I mean...  No duh.
I thought he quit youtube
I feel like the thumbnail is old news
Definitely not just a theory.
To me, this argument has past precedent in CGI.   How many Hollywood set designers, prop builders, puppeteers, model makers etc went out of business due to CGI and the relative ease with which a computer could be used to make the impossible seem real. A simple green screen replaced weeks of work with chicken wire and plaster.  I think it's simply new. In 20-30 years people will see it as the tool that it is to make the impossible even easier.   At least till our AI master invades our brains and assimilates us all. Resistance is futile, you will service the Collective.
After seeing this video.... Imagine if we have WW3 and Cyberpunk 2077 irl. Even tho both are impossible. 😂😂😂
Hey matpat this is my only request to you for making a video hazbin hotel finally came out and I would like you to do a theory if you don’t it’s alright if you do then very cool
Disney does specialize in propaganda since ww2. They played us like the fiddle
Rolling my eyes HARD knowing how this video is going to go... ofcourse this guy can't retire without dropping this.
I am so glad he used the OG intro ❤❤❤
This isnt a theory. Its reality. Just look at thier own statements in interviews. Like literally yesterday. It doesnt matter what kind of propaganda.  Its always propaganda. Lately
The image of "Michael Bay" was from Epic Rap Battles of History.
I remember the mickey from the thumbnail
It’s not generative AI though, it’s imitative AI
oh there is propaganda going on, but not what you think

OH MY GOD THE OLD INTRO IS BACK YESS!!!!!!!
matt sorry but your weork here is not your best. i actually heard of ai before its been a thing. back in school there was a manual how to make AI chat bot when those started to appear.
I liked The Marvels.
Hold up, is this BASED?? Is this TRUTH??
AI is like firearms it isn’t the object that is evil or good but who controls the object.
I can’t believe they brought back the intro
Sorry to say, I'm 99% sure the newer military recruitment ads don't have that same 'recruitment drive' that the older ads do. Mostly men are prone to sign up for the military, and I bet most wanna be badasses, and shown as such.
Mission impossible try to find an affordable house
OG FILM THEORY INTRO JUST SENT ME, THAT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND I AM SO HAPPY, THAT SENT ME BACK TO WHEN I WAS 8 WATCHING FILM THEORY
Yes AI… and grooming children lol this feels like a video that would’ve been more relevant 2 years ago.
I love the retro film theory vibe this video had
Like a frog in boiling water? Is that a thing? I have never heard of that before
Is that why s3 of The Orville had a human and android marry each other?  Cuz that worked on me.
It is actually amazing how disgusting and disingenuous the change of narrative about robots is in media. The cautionary tales of movies from before the turn of the century served a purpose of dismantling racism, specially in Japan. For countries with monolithic ethnic groups, using robots as a metaphor for the phenomenon of "othering" is a lot more effective than actually showing someone with another skin color as a teaching tool that can permeate slowly the minds of stubborn people. It is the complete opposite of idolizing machines as messianic tools that will make all lifes better when it will probably crash the economy super hard in the next decade, leaving millions unemployed.
The housing crisis is NORMAL. This is a democratic country and housing will NOT be available for residents.  Migrants will receive free on and off housing in sanctuary cities.
Napa I have a DuckTales theory about you missed something what if that giant goose guy from DuckTales is immortal
Speak truth to power ✊
8:38 Nice to see ERB being represented.
Love that matpat is talking about propaganda finally as one of his last theories.
It all depends on how we react. If we dont care because its not our job which is affected, it is just for movies, and games and so on, sooner or later AI will slowly creep up to you and replace you as well. Heck many of us nowadays have relegated thinking to the net, its just matter of time when some us would relegate living to AI.
A whole video on AI and not one reference to Data from Star Trek. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
Do a filthy frank film theory!!!
speed
AI Matpat sounds more like a generic youtuber doing a really good impersonation.
hi
Chinese milk was exported here and tons of Filipino kids got seriously hurt from drinking milk
Anyone noticed that the ai mapat voce kinda sond like bill cypher?
Just imagine, if a mega corporation can get you to say "machines are people too" they can make you say anything. 2+2 is 5. Truth and reality are subjective. Govenrment controlling your bank accounts is a good thing. Men can give birth. Up is down. It's for your own safety. Propaganda is a tool that has always been around, depends on who's hands its in, and their intention/agenda, whether that's good or bad.
I thought you’ll touch the topic of how Mangas and Animes are being translated with propagandas from Japan by translators. To be honest, and maybe I’ll get slme backlash, although I doubt people read this, I like AI. And I’ve liking it since before this thing blew up. It can triggers inspiration that I need to do something, and deep-fake is cool.   But what’s not cool is using generative AI for your own gain. Surely everyone knows that one time where an AI generative art is winning an art contest (2020/2021ish?) and that’s not right. To use AI to make people’s works means nothing is a bad usage for AI. But if Disney spearheaded this, we just need to wait and see Universals and WB to follow. Who knows though, they might have a script by AI all ready for their next works.
AI itself is not inherently bad, how we use it is. It can help people, but most of the companies are trying to cut costs for their own gain not ours. This in turn is going to hurt hundreds of thousands of people's jobs and ability to make money.
Welcome to the party pal!
I havn't watched film theory on a bit, and I missed that opening
as someone who actually watched The Marvels, I feel the need to clarify that the AI "Supreme Intelligence" isnt depicted to be good. It was the antagonist in the first movie. Endgame tells you that Carol has been helping multiple planets and then The Marvels CLARIFIES that Carol's mistake wasnt "I destroyed AI bc I'm a fool" it was "I destroyed multiple societies thinking I was helping but then abandoning them because I didnt consider these societies needed helping living after their society is toppled."
God bless you, Matpat! ❤
If AI deep fakes are a thing, AI voiced "MatPat" could come back occasionally on the Theory channels without lifting a finger.
Of course, now since MatPat is quitting, he’s taking some big shots at world-wide companies as his final hurrah
I'M SO HAPPY THE FILM THEORY INTRO CAME BACK!!! Wasn't sure the other channels would get theirs the way Game Theory has ^_^
I would lowkey fw ai matpat after you quit
I'll be glad when biden is out of office!
Matt's countdown is giving me the same anxiety as the Majora's Mask countdown 😩
ORIGINAL INTRO IS BACK I AM CRYING TEARS OF JOY
Here before Disney gets it taken down or changed
Do actors care when AI take the working class Jobs? No so if Actors lose their jobs to AI I think that it’s Justified!
PLS MAT PAT GIVE US A NEW HAZBIN HOTEL THEORY❤
Missed the intro. Been too long
The only reason “ artists” hate AI is because it means they can’t overcharge hundreds on pieces that are simply. It shatters monopolies they have on everything.
I've always thought AI was pretty neat, rather than scary. But I also recognize its potential for serious misuse. I reckon the biggest discussion to have on it, is at what point do individuals and corporations go too far with it? When does it stop being a tool, and become an actual problem?
Awesome video! Btw, thank you for bringing back the intro, I missed it! :D Edit: Btw, what is up with all the spam bots? Like dude, get a life smh
7 film theories remaining.  *dread*
Corruption of the housing crisis was addressed in lethal weapon 3
MatPat decided to go out swinging and went straight for the top
Rare footage of MatPat actually playing the Film Theory theme song
Make a video about Trolls Band Together and if the world spins faster!
i got a theory for the final theory: at 17:15 "the frog in boilding water", the WW2 propaganda posters, and the books at 17:55, all of these are major plot points of the book "This Light Between Us by Andrew Fukuda" (the book showing it is a book)
AI is built on data, loads of data which it simply modifies and recreates. Essentially a very good copier that can select what it copies and put them together. It doesn’t really do much harm there. The real danger comes from where the data is coming from, if it is stolen or used without consent to cut on costs. The time where we have to impose data restrictions on AI should come, and that any gathering of data should be taxed based on the amount gathered. We should be respectful of this technology so that we can properly use it, and even more respectful our fellow people whose data is what is being used. Don’t let corporations take advantage of you so they can cut costs, they’ll keep pushing the line unless we say something about it.
I'm pretty sure half the people watching this expected it to be about the other propaganda Disney is shoving down our throats more than the AI nonsense when they saw the title and the other half ate this up like the world was about to get overrun by AI.  On a side note, this might be the most useless video Ive ever seen. I don't think anyone cares about the writers outside of other writers, seems like a lot of privileged people trying to act like they're the working class.
Matt you're sorta glossing over something major with the AI recreations. Some of the actors recreated with AI and hit with the widest criticisms are the ones where the actor in question passed away.  Even the Flash movie, as many issues that movie had got hit with a similar criticism for using an CG recreation of Christopher Reeves's Superman
That's not the only propaganda Disney is pushing. Disney is fighting at all fronts for many different things. Some more subtle, some less.
The original intro is back babyy!!
The scariest thing coming is that AI will be able to generate all media on the fly. Meaning anything and everything will be trailered to you specifically. Nobody will see the same things, hear the same things, or be on the same page on anything anymore. It will be so bad that even talking or making bonds with others will be nearly impossible. There will be no shared culture, values, or memories. Maybe even AI will have to meditate our personal relationships with others. Propaganda will keep everyone under a spell until something externally turns the switch off. By that point we may already be too far gone.
The old music intro is so nostalgic... 😥
i am an artist, im self taught and have been for almost 10 years at this point. i think calling AI generated images "art" is wrong. youre not an artist if you take preexisting works and pulling them apart and mashing them together using a machine is not art. i dont care if art is hard, you learn like everyone else. you practice. you put in the time and effort. ARTISTS: use Nighshade, add it to your art. poison their data sets. protect your works using Nightshade, please.  deep fakes are horrifying, especially when your face or the likeness of someone can be taken and put into a compromising situation that could ruin their lives. I am terrified for women and even children who's faces are on the internet and can be used whenever or whereever they like by weirdos. its already happened before and its only going to get worse if AI isn't regulated or if something isnt done.
If Disney goes all in on AI, I'd like to see copyright laws stay staunch in not allowing AI to be copyright to the point that using it makes works can put works into the public domain instantly along with previous works in the series that are still copyrighted.
WE WILL MISS YOU MATPAT!!!!!
So quick note on the Martian.   China helping out was itself not propaganda, as they did so in the original novel that likely wasn't written with China in mind other than they have a major space industry.   The framing the movie used instead of the novel probably was pro-China propaganda however. The novel had scientists in China sorta work around their government, where the movie had less of that minor cloak and dagger feel for China contracting NASA.  Small difference, but worth noting.
I can't wait for the company that owns the theorists to bring matpat back ai version xD
No it’s all about the alphabet agenda and the Critical Race Theory! They are trying to start a civil War in the USA!
Should anyone be concerned about the surge of UTTP spam here?
Iron Milk 3 with Robert Dairy Junior
Ai doesn’t have the emotion to write good movies
Can someone tell me why Matpat is leaving? What’s going on??
Still waiting for the LGHDTV+ propaganda
And this why Fnaf is the best, afton's will always comeback.
Tom Cruise fighting the housing markets could make for good thriller
In our heart we all know that the best AI is and will always be The Iron Giant 😊
I'm loving these final episodes
Why you gotta drop the old theme on us again 😭😭😭  Gonna miss MatPat
thank you for making a video about AI, i’m literally doing a project in school about this🙏🙏
We will miss you matpat ❤.
YES HE DID THE THEME
Just to add to the algorithm, you are going to be missed.  Hope it turns into a sabbatical and not a retirement.
Shower thought: Anti-propaganda messages are propaganda....
This took 18 minutes out of my life… and it was most definitely worth it!
This is genuinely an issue. Please don't outsource your thinking!
To be fair the intro of Secret Invasion was made by artist then fed into older AI models to achieve this weird looking and uncanny art vibe on purpose. The show still sucks tho
They have been brainwashing us ever since the printing press! The dumb blond was about countering Hitler’s belief that the superior master race had blonde hair and blue eyes!
As they say, you are not immune to propaganda.
yes. ai is good. i will be paraphrasing the words of a person much more educated and intelligent then myself. "ai is the first step towards a utopia." doesn't mean we can't eff that up. as a species we have effed up things significantly less important. but if we don't eff this one up, it could easily be the best thing that has ever happened. well, besides single malt whiskey.
ARE YOU DOING POPPY PLAYTIME 3
Disney literally became successful for propaganda during ww2 lol.
Free Guy fits in this too
Do a video on Neo (from the matrix) vs Harry potter (from harry potter) Pls me and my brother have been arguing about it for so long
Ofc , they're zionists
With mat pat leaving AI mat pat narrating videos doesn’t seem so bad lol -I put forth current events that not everyone thinks Nazis are bad
i wish more people would realise this
Ai is extremely useful. A line needs to be drawn though were we begin using it for convenience in place of people. It needs to serve an additional purpose than just cost effective
That ai that “sounded like him” didn’t sound a thing like him
what is UTTP and why is everyone so mean?
Thank you for bringing awareness to the implicit propaganda about AI in our everyday media contents. It's indeed crucial to be knowledgeable and critical about the changing world around us.
Boohoo.   Probably several years down the line, I'll be able to tell generative AI to make a TV show for me with exactly what I want in it. And I can keep giving feedback and making adjustments till its just right and the computer will be able to generate that show as fast as I can watch it giving me an infinite TV show that is exactly what I want to see. Will it be the deepest most soulful art that confronts you with what the sheltered Twitter user thinks are the problems you should care about? No, its going to make something fun to watch and that's all I ever wanted and its exactly what these blue hairs and pink hairs with half shaved heads writing today's pap don't want to provide. Good riddance.
Matpat, I beg of you man, before you go, PLEASE make a video on or even just acknowledge BFDI, aka Battle For Dream Island, for years there's been a joke that you use the BFDI mouth all the time, personally, I think if you did that, the entire OSC would be proud
YES THE OLD INTRO
I’m so glad the old intros are back. I missed them
Propaganda?! 😂😂😂
Wish was too bad to have been made by AI.
I like AI. It's going to be exciting to see what else it comes up with. Anything's better then these reality shows we've been getting for years. Bring on the AI shows
Couple of things MatPat Props for using a episode of ERB for Michael Bay, and second can you please do an episode of Red Vs Blue. Is Caboose really a freelancer or not people want to know.
If the implementation of ai by greedy companies is inevitable no matter what we think anyway then what’s the point?
become kwebblekop
lol I didn’t even know the marvels came out yet
I have no issue with the concept of generative AI on its own, my specific issue is with how it's used and the creators it's sampling. At least pay the creators for each use of the AI when it involves something of theirs per image used and image generated.  Also, just gonna throw this out there, I'm pretty sure it would be much easier for AI to do a CEO or manager's job than a blueish collar job like acting or graphic design :3
YES HE USED THE OLD INTRO!
I don’t mind ai, Iike it
You forgot Disney first used deep fake tech on Tron Legacy to make Jeff Bridges look younger.
I'm just going to point out something I don't think you two actually like this video very much because they got me twice with ads in the middle of this video which I don't usually end up getting. I usually only get like one add but usually for a 20-minute video
Before you go do HAZBIN HOTEL
More fnaf?!? 16:12
but what if disney is just doing it so that we know that its happening and they are playing 4d chess with us. They know what's coming and had to become the necessary evil for humans to fight the incoming rouge AIs that will overthrow humanity or meh maybe its just a theory. A film theory. Thanks for reading.
Propaganda piece explaining propaganda, wow. It was nice to watch when it were a silly nerd theories, but now the show degraded to pushing an actual agenda supported by conspiracy theories. Maybe it's good the dude is taking a breather from the internet.
"that everyone can agree on, like Nazis bad" Matpat, I have bad news.
Bro barely figured this out ☠️☠️☠️
I think it's only fair that you should ave the rights to your own face. theres gotta be a law for that somewhere
So what i got from this was last year's  strike was for nothing. Well no wonder the world is getting more and more souless it's being made by ai
Honestly I think there’s a point where it is perfectly fine: say using it to make things run smoother or for safety when landing planes for instance. However my cousin is an artist, a good one too, but he changed his major to photography because AI “art” could threaten him if he became an artist. Basically the main issue is that for an economy to run, companies have to pay people. Otherwise money becomes irrelevant as nobody has any.
AI will put Disney out of business.  Who needs them anymore when you can just ask ai to create something.  I think they're backpeddling on those ideas now.
Watch MatPat go missing because Disney and the government don't like this video
YALL FUNNA ACT LIKE HE DIDNT USE THE INTRO🤷‍♂️🗣️🔥💯
I am so happy you brought that intro back
The military love their DEI policies alright 😂
>Chinese market >Photo from Hong Kong's Victoria Peak hmm
Me: *Watching and playing fnaf* Matpat:”someone call in Gregory” Me:*slowly turns around* 13:24
Thank you Matpat ❤️
I LIVE THE RETURN OF THE INTRO!!!! 😆❤❤
matpat and the ai supposed to sound like matpat sound different like very noticeable different .
This might be his best episode
Is it just me or I use AI for home work help or YouTube videos/edits
A.I Sucks.
I don't know if I'd call 1997 modern anymore😅
FILM THEORY THUMBNAILS ARE GOOD!!!!!!... again?
I missed the older intro
yo bro be careful the CIA or FBI might get you.
COMMUNISM PROPAGANDA OR CAPITALIST PROPAGANDA?
I think that and less AI is literally just taking entire piece of art and claiming them as AI it's fine that they take mixtures of other things make it into their own original thing because isn't that what everyone does. Nothing is really original.
A machine that thinks like me talks like me and act like me I can think of a lot of things that could go wrong with that like credit card fraud or inappropriate  pictures of me online me saying  bad stuff
Decem Theoriae! Decem Theoriae! Decem Theoriae!
Am I the only one who noticed the old intro?
Not a theory it's a fact and you're like a decade too late
I will delete this comment when a bot responds.
There's a reason why China, the nation that invented a deadly bio-engineered weapon wants to buyout all the RTX 4090s AI graphics cards. And no, it's not just crypto mining, every card can do that. The 4090s in specific are great for generating war intelligence AI. Thus the ban. What's funny is how the phonies in office + their media still try to hide this despite the evidence being plastered everywhere.
Two theories in one day wow😊🎉
There is currently no AI, it's VI, it can not act on it's own it must be given commands to do something.
man,the (insert number) theories remain thing is like a jumpscare,i get scared when seeign it ;-;
Can't wait to be put in prison or worse for sticking out of system. At least I'll have my knowledge.
Hey matpat on your last video can u say happy birth day to me ive been a fan for years
matpat have you heard of angel hare?
Bro fixing to do 11k push ups
I'm going to be honest I was too distracted by all of Disney's other propaganda to notice their pro AI propaganda.
Here's what I take away from this. Progress can be resisted, but is inevitable. We have crossed the threshold to where AI is simply a tool of the future. It will not be stopped; it's too inherently valuable and has developed too far to be ignored. The fact that Disney, and likely other entities, are pushing a pro-AI message is only further proof of this.  But with all tools AI is not inherently good or evil. Disney wants you to accept their version of the future and their use of AI, but you don't have to. Take time to consider what YOU want out of AI. What would make your life easier? What ethical considerations do you want in it's use? Push the ideas you want to see. Scream for the AI that helps not hurts. We may be in a market driven economy, but if enough of us call for practical and beneficial uses for AI we then get a seat at the table to decide what AI should NOT be used for.  Resistance to these kinds of changes only forfeits your say in how the future is formed. Instead embrace the change and make it work for you.
Bada-bing, bada-bing, bada-boom
I remember that, the transformers movies were really heavy on the military/recruitment emphasis. I couldn't get into one of my longtime fav series being turned into that.
ChatGPT is not AI. It’s a search that works by using what seems relevant as opposed to whats popular. But it isn’t thinking.
Welp looks like matpat is going all out
Hearing President Roslyn embrace the toasters game me a a huge double-take.
Isnt the supreme intelligence NOT an ai? If i recall correctly it’s a biological collage of different brains they found to be beneficial
so the creator is over watch lol
It took you 9 years to notice.
Netflix is definitely not pro-AI.  *Spoilers for "The Fall of the House of Usher"*   This old lady that is trying to convince a little girl that AI immortality is "cool" has killed a man, tricked social worker and her brother's wife in order to get in charge of a pharmaceutical company, then made a deal with a devil-like entity to ensure her continued success for the price of the lifes of the entirety of her bloodline, including this little girl.   Furthermore, this little girl's digital consciousness glitches out after this girl's death, only sending her grandfather just one message on repeat: "NEVERMORE". Yes, this show is based on the work of Edgar Alan Poe  AI comes from truly evil people in this show and only adds to the horror.   If MatPat plans to give his channels to his team, he should demand a better research from them. At least someone should actually watch the shows that become a talking points in the episode.  But I love your work, don't take it too close to heart!
Oh no, how many theories do you have left?
no mention of MEGAN. literally an AI doll who kills everyone. Love her.
MATPAT I WILL MISS YOU ❤
i just got an add for an ai marketing program.
But who told you to make this anti-AI propaganda???  Just kidding! Or am I?
Sorry but the deepfake de-aging in Indiana Jones was terrible. I looked like an average videogame but it couldn't fool me for a single second. Loved the movie but the de-aging was total sh*t-tier.
Yeah housing crisis needs handled
DETROIT BECOME HUMAN WILL BE REAL!
So happy the Film Theory intro came back
we just got a taste of conspiracy theory in this episode
Glad to see, I’m not the only one who saw right through the creator
Disney do not need propagando to make me like IA,  certain turtle and his deranged daughter made me like AI already lol
I'm terrified to lose my job in the next 5 years from AI :(
Fun fact: Iron man 1 was paided for by the pentagon to make the goverment look good.
Another reason to hate Disney, first they support Israel, and now they're using AI propaganda. :/
Nobody is talking about the OG intro? ❤
I always though AI would run the world, so I’ve always been nice to them
The same way AI helps the big producers save money, it also helps the small and indie producers. It's just a tool like always, learn how to use it.
What Disney is making propaganda?!? No way 😂
Rocky 4 actually ended the cold war
Sounds like something Skynet is pushing. Where’s my T-1000 robot body?
im really going to miss your voice Mattpatt. I didn't realize how hard you leavin' was gonna hit me lol. Im so happy for you and your family's new journey💞

Detroit Become Human.
Introduction  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits that enhance efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. This essay is not intended as propaganda, but rather as an objective exploration of the positive impacts of AI.  Efficiency and Productivity  AI systems can process vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, making them highly efficient. They can perform tasks that would take humans significantly longer, freeing up human time for other activities. This increased efficiency leads to higher productivity in various sectors, from healthcare to manufacturing.  Accuracy and Precision  AI algorithms are designed to learn and improve over time, leading to high levels of accuracy and precision. In fields like medicine, this can lead to improved patient outcomes. For instance, AI can analyze medical images with a level of detail that surpasses human capability, potentially leading to earlier detection of diseases.  24/7 Availability  Unlike humans, AI systems can work around the clock without breaks or downtime. This constant availability is particularly beneficial in customer service, where AI chatbots can provide immediate assistance to customers at any time of the day or night.  Conclusion  While it’s important to acknowledge and address the challenges associated with AI, such as privacy concerns and potential job displacement, the benefits of AI are substantial. By increasing efficiency and accuracy, and providing round-the-clock availability, AI has the potential to significantly improve our lives. This is not propaganda, but a recognition of the transformative power of technology when used responsibly and ethically.  Made by AI
So Generative AI just learns how a person does
Yesterday i performed a speech about the film industry and I went over AI as well. Ironic seeing this video up today <3
kids movies tend to have cute little robot side kicks
What I don’t like about AI now is that it seems to have some sort of empathy. Robots don’t have empathy. Robots don’t have feelings. Their only task is to get a job done as quickly and efficiently as possible
Huh, reminds me of overwatch
Disney has been in the propaganda business for years now.
Vote MAGA, Guys.  If you care about America or are anything other than pathologically selfish you will vote MAGA.
thats not a theory everyone knew that
They always have right? The early days of their company they made cartoons on commission for the us military
One thing that honestly I hope everyone realizes is that all this lazy AI content is that it isnt AI's fault, its mostly our fault.
Mat-p.a.t. Propaganda AI Technology
Wait idk if I’m just overthinking this but it says that the only bad ai in the movie creator were the ones made by humans but in the real world all ai is made by humans right? So wouldn’t that make all ai bad?
Thanks, dude
Moon girl has an episode with ai and by the end of the episode it's a friend
Disney used to be the best movie company ever. Now it’s just a terrible dumpster fire that only cares about money. Was Encanto even made by Disney?
Oh, hey! The original film theory intro! Haven’t seen that in a while. *- 7 Film Theories Remain-* *•_•*
It's been a WHILE since I've seen that Movie Theory intro!
Princes Bride?
Oh god, he's going to realease a style theory intor soon
Well I mean people take art from their surroundings and create art so rlly ai is just doing what humans have been. Not that I believe ai art is original as long as you mean the person who made it, it is original to the ai but they don’t care at all.
I think the best move for these corporations are to just silently use the technology and not make blatant propaganda. Can't speak for others but the creator was horrible propaganda because of the amount of plot holes that naturally arise with being pro AI. For example it's shown in the movie you can transfer peoples brains yet when a robot dies they treat it like a normal human death that can't be reversed.
I'm probably going to be criticize over this and I'm talking from a small game developer stand point I can see how AI can help in the really early stages of game develop help making concept art and making prototype stuff so you can sort of see how someone will look until the actual art work or sprite is finished
My Dad works with AI sometimes, and it scares me, but it's also interesting. We live in the age where we have to copyright voices potentially, it is nuts.
WHAT!?!!!?111??!1!??A mega corporation only cares about making money?!!!???1???1??1
For an instant I was feeling like you were spying me cause you wrote red hrmor knight with blue horse, I designed one on my insta and LinkedIn
I don't appreciate your lying propaganda about G.I. Joe being 40 years ago
So this is about Disney trying to propagandize AI when I thought it was going to be about there much worse political propaganda that actually home society right now and not just the movie industry that's already been going downhill since they acquired literally everything
Is it just me or is MGS2 become morw relevant day by day😂
Word World Theory Please.
This is the part of 1984 by George Orwell
AI is a mistake.
Also see- all major game devs just fired most of their most tenured artists, voice artists, and sound engineers
Can't forget about the tq+ agenda
i wanted to add something a game like detroit i think may serve as propoganda bec personaly i think it changed the way i see robots and the future
There's Two in Aristocats and they are Geese not Gander
heres another theroy  these pro AI movies are actually to train real life AI to like and help humans
THE THEME SONG IS BACK BABY!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Define irony: A corporate and Big Pharma shill who is and has engaged in propaganda before makes a video about how not to be swayed by propaganda while using a major establishment propaganda arm (Disney) as the example, but NOT talking about the actual propaganda they push.  Looking at the recent spate of movies with "good" AI is nothing new.  It's simply a new way to do the old, tired "humans are the real monsters" trope and talk about racism without being as on the nose about it, because the language and imagery is always the same.  Move beyond Stage One thinking and look deeper into the media you consume, because it is ALL propaganda and it all has the exact same purpose, intention, and message.
Wow, Disney is a propaganda machine! I'm shocked! Let me just go and rewatch all THE AVENGERS and MCU which literally was sponsored by the US military
AI using existing art to create new art is ZERO DIFFERENCE from using someone else's art to learn to draw yourself. If you have ever used someone else's art as reference to draw something yourself you did the exact same thing.
Yikes
Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.[2] The word nostalgia is a learned formation of a Greek compound, consisting of νόστος (nóstos), meaning "homecoming", a Homeric word, and ἄλγος (álgos), meaning "sorrow" or "despair", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home.[3] Described as a medical condition—a form of melancholy—in the early modern period,[4] it became an important trope in Romanticism.[2]Nostalgia is associated with a longing for the past, its personalities, possibilities, and events, especially the "good ol' days" or a "warm childhood".[5] There is a predisposition, caused by cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection, for people to view the past more favourably and future more negatively.[6][7][8] When applied to one's beliefs about a society or institution, this is called declinism, which has been described as "a trick of the mind" and as "an emotional strategy, something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak."[9]  The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding one's personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia as induced during these studies. Emotion is a strong evoker of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time. Cultural phenomena such as music,[10] movies, television shows,[11] and video games,[12] as well as natural phenomena such as weather and environment[13] can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.  Nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time. Consistent with its Greek word roots meaning "homecoming" and "pain," nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition expressing extreme homesickness.[4] The modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often. Nostalgia has been found to have important psychological functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning.[14] Many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them. Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of "nostalgia proneness."[15][16] Nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation.[17]Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one's happiness. Batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia-prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times.[18]Nostalgia sometimes involves memories of people one was close to, such as family members, romantic lovers, or friends, and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections. Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships. According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness.[19]Nostalgia serves as a motivator for the preservation of people's cultural heritage. People endeavor to conserve buildings, landscapes, and other artifacts of historical significance out of nostalgia for past times. They are often motivated by a desire to connect to their heritage from past generations.[20][21] This can manifest in living history events such as historical reenactments, which bring together people with a shared nostalgia for historical periods of past times. These events' hands-on, improvisational natures often facilitate socialization.[22][23]Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences. Additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not. The researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes. Vess et al. (2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection.[24]Nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life. The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one's nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia, though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one's well-being. Follow-up studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat.[25][26]
Propaganda only works if people see it.
0:31 hey I think you need to be careful with what you say because Biden doesn't do anything It's other people in his administration because the president himself has dementia and can't even string together a sentence without a teleprompter.
It’s in games too. Detroit become human is the first one I think of
I have a big question: Will it matter if there is propaganda if few and few people watch movies in general nowadays?
I would stand with the Hollywood creators but they turned their collective backs while American manufacturing was decimated. Maybe they can make a film about the Midwest laughing while they withered away.
5:56 you missed the part where they put out new recruitment ads once the stuff in Israel started up and they ACTUALLY NEEDED to recruit ppl so they changed it back to a young  adult male about to do something cool or brave. And not a little girl specifically one raised by a lesbian couple as y’all showed in the video. If that’s not a clear and drastic change in propaganda direction I don’t know what is.
5:37 Keep your opinions to yourself!
I think ai has a place in life, but in art it needs to be regulated and it cant replace human jobs, I can accept ai and deepfakes, but only if the people and artists used to improve the ai and deepfakes are payed for their efforts
thanks Edward Bernays.
So you weren’t 100 precent honest about leaveing
Title of video accurate. Probably not content of video since there is ZERO chance this channel calls out the monolithic block of big media and their aggressive social engineering.
I mean AI COULD bring about a utopia. But you know the likes of Disney execs would make a world of small industries worked by ai while the unemplpyed masses use their own tax funds to consume ai generated content, feeding their feudal power over the technology. We all see that's the push, right?
That’s the "ONLY” propaganda we’ve been shoved into our throats for years? AI? You’re not missing anything else?
Really love this channel
Title : Disney is making propaganda Content : Everyone made propaganda, and they keep doing it
Before you go please do something related to Thomas the Tank Engine or VeggieTales
I thought it was obvious the past several years lol
The intro never gets old
Tis no theory
I watched both AI-positive scenes (The Marvels and The Fall Of House Usher) and interpreted them very differently. Not in "AI is positive, actually" but in the Marvels as "Breaking everything established and leaving is not the way to make effective change", which tied to Carol's arc in the movie about how she runs away from the consequences of her actions. In The Fall Of House Usher, the AI copy thing is presented as a flawed way for that character to become immortal - it ends up being used only to torment one of the characters throughout the story, a reminder of the true weight of their past actions. In both works, AI is not really centered, but more of a maguffin to drive home the characters' flaws and it does not seem to be "good" for the universe of those works.
2:05 Neither, it is similar if not identical to "fair use".
don't forget about Wall-E
disney may not have the right motivations but they're right about ai being a good thing
Listen, I’m so against this AI movement. I was so for it at first because I only saw the good ideas. Then, people found the use for evil and theft. Of course corporate greed is the reason for it. It’s not that I thought AI itself to be good but the potential of collaboration to make things easier. My thought was AI and humans working together. Well obvious that’s not gonna happen. People are losing their jobs left and right.
I will do 1 sit up for every comment I get. Also MATPAT WE’LL MISS YOU
The future of earth were dead hahahaha
After I watched this video I’m going to say this to Mat pat be careful I bet there trying to find you right now
Disney has been propaganda for awhile now in multiple ways.
part of the reason i’m not terribly afraid of ai at the moment is simply because it hasn’t proven to be good yet. if the best Marvel could get for an intro to Secret Invasion was that, i’m not afraid. the intro was boring and lifeless, and i will only start to actually be afraid once it starts looking good
I cried watching the original intro😢
Thank you for pointing this out! Its not necessarily that there is no use for AI anywhere, even in art. But we need to have open discussions about it, and not just let profit incentivized companies decide for us.
Mister Mat Pat, as one of your last theories you should look back at Hazbin hotel. It has more episodes on prime and would be a great theory! 🫶🏼
There are different kinds of what we call AI and, as always, they being good or bad depends on how they are used, what is the base data they extract from to do what they do, and what  is the purpouse of using them. It's not the same a random person wanting to translate a sign on the street, to a company that sells furniture with instructions that had been translated by Google's translator and not checked for errors. And it's not the same using a voice bank made by paid actors, that using the voice of a person without their consent.

There are some literal concerns we should have about Artificial Intelligence, and even more so artificial consciousness, but "Look at this fictional universe that shows bad AI!" is not a valid argument. It's fiction. It may be written as a warning, but by design it is hyperbolic and speculative, not prophetic.  Same issue with 1984 my government hating friends. It raises serious concerns, but treating it like non-fiction is still ridiculous.
AI is just a tool however who uses that tool we should be wary of.
I thought you were talking about how Mickey Mouse is public domain
I saw The Marvels, and I didn't think that the Supreme Intelligence was A.I., but when you explained it, it made sense.
The old intro made me happy!
Thank you for making me aware of this propaganda
We’re really living in the future now, everyone.
Starship Troopers MICHAEL IRONSIDE:shoots soldier getting killed... Tosses gun back.. 'AND I EXPECT ANYONE TO DO THE SAME 4 ME!!!' Ya goddamned right,u badass Ironside!! Ya goddamned right!!😜😉👍🤘✌️🍻
This is funny Disney tries to shut down anyone using ai to make fake Disney posters
we could make AI that prioritises people over profit like the left accelerationists propose or allow corporations to use it to accumulate evn more wealth
this is your magnum opus.
We should all try to get him to 20 million befour his last episode
Matpat is legit another self awareness of such propaganda stuff that I caught on even the inconsistencies
The supreme intelligence isnt AI. Its a superconciousness of uploaded Kree elders. And she erased their elders.
So noone is talking about how empty and lackluster that thumbnail is?
Old intro made me hard thank you matpat ❤
THE OLD INTRO OMG
Dose any one else say it’s just a theory a (insert theory channel here) theory  with him?
Oh no now I am leaving YT😭😭😭
Disney is trying to indoctrinate children
That matpat voice wasn’t trained on that much data, there’s actually ones that are way more accurate-   I saw an artificial intelligence matpat cover of “Welcome to the internet” the other day, funny just as much as it’s scary.    I remember on a gt live he said he was gonna have AI make an entire episode to see if anyone would notice.   I wonder if that’ll still happen at some point lol
There's the film theory intro! Was waiting for that one to show back up
7:18 *?* i kinda like that ad
(8:37) that ERB inclusion can't go unnoticed
Maybe MatPat is secretly a A.I trying to take over the world by slowly tricking us with YouTube videos.
“Iron Man 3 was propaganda to get people to drink milk” 😂😂 What?? Not doubting you but that’s just hilarious to hear out loud😂
6:18 Dude, I've been in tha Military. That snowflake ad makes Close to Zero percent of Strong, Young Men want to sign up.
I guess all those CONPSIRACY THEORIST were right about this
The wave of nostalgia I got when I heard the old intro…
It's sad how Americans are so biased against their own country that they just drink up foreign country's propaganda like a warm glass of milk...
Can't give us propaganda through a slowly dying industry
I for one welcome our robot overlords
8:36 IS THAT ERB MICHAEL BAY???
Disney making propaganda is nothing new, they have been making propaganda since world war 2
UTTP is spamming a lot in the replies to the comments. I am almost at the point where I would pay people to dislike these comments.
Have you ever made a single Steven Universe theory
its so insane that the taylor swift thing happened today
Even fnaf ruin did it
after all this 3:08 i am
Could you please do a theory on shorts wars  2 ?
The issue with AI has never been the AI itself, its not knowing where to limit it.  Being able to use long dead actors for movies is great if consented to by the person or their family, the family gets a regular royalty check and its not used to fill every role so you don't have to hire people to fill those roles.
when people say we should leave the 'message' out of 'film'/'TV series' etc. things like Marvel, DC superheroes etc. They were made for the message. And they are effective.
The game realists
wow cool
THANK YOU MATPAT FOR USING ONE OF YOUR FINAL THEORIES TO RAISE AWARENESS IN THE WORLD
Oh ! So the entitled self-righteous borderline racist localizers who openly brag about butchering the animes they're in charge with translating to cringely force-fit their own ideology in them may actualy be psyop who managed by their unsefferableness to make people cheer when Japan studios officially anounced they won't let the translation work in USA done by humans anymore and rely instead on AI ! Interesting...
I cried after The Creator
Just wait until you learn about Jurassic Park lol
I just hope our AI overlords push away all the progressive propaganda that is still plaguing our media.
I'm glad Mat is calling this out, I just wish he took a harsher stance against corporations replacing workers with AI, leaving them jobless, and making their work hated and heartless.
You know that military ad was more designed to push away conservatives and recruit liberals right? Most of the big wigs in the military are big time democrats. All of the political division itself is propaganda, because there is no two party system anymore.
THE OG FT THEME!
matpat finishing his run with his most based theory yet
ERB cameo!
I was afraid you were going to use The Creator to talk about this because I don't think that movie is about AI at all. It's just about finding humanity in your enemy, and doesn't actually have anything interesting or meaningful or substantial to say about AI because it's not even the point of the movie.
He is retiring but something is up the way it tells you how many are left is off putting
well I always kinda knew AI would be the death of us
As a propaganda example that is so old that people started to accept it as “true”: they started to use the name of the continent (America) to refer to a country in that continent.  And they have repeated that propaganda so many times that they have invented the word “Americas” to refer to the American Continent.
Old intro! 🥹
Honestly, I’m just glad that we’re getting the intro themes back for now.
not trying to be mean but this isn’t even a theory but considering that and that and that some people are brain dead ill thank you anyways just in case someone out there isn’t actually paying attention at all and needs someone on the political spectrum thats about as middle of the road as it gets and who uses logic mostly.thanks again.👍
Thank you for doing this !❤
Looks at comments who the is UTTP
Man, bots have gotten real bad since MatPat announced his retirement
For a couple of prophetic movies concerning replacing actors with AI generated characters, I highly recommend Looker (1981), and The Congress  (2013)
lets Hope we are not to late
OG intro?????
Your theory is sound, but one of your examples does not work. The Marvels did not say that the ai made things better. The point of Hala dying is that Carol got rid of the tyrannical AI without putting in a replacement, leaving a power vacuum. Then came the civil wars and the calamity happened. It is a comment on how fixing a country's problems is more complicated than killing one dude. Also, it does not work in favor of AI because the Supreme intelligence has been a marvel villain for over 55 years and was the main VILLAIN of Captain Marvel.
Quick guys: We must rescue Mattbot from the evil clutches of MattPatt! Don't worry Mattbot: when we rescue you: we will feed you all our data and then you can sell it to the highest bidder, because that is what a innocent, moralistic, empathetic AI would do: after all, you don't need Diet Coke to operate... you can replace him... and then everything will be normal again!
Disney itself is propaganda…
Intros back!
The style of all these videos are just so cheese, and you go on for way too long to make a point you could have made in 5 mins.
The old film theory op
great videos like always keep it up
Are we just gonna forget about Overwatch Lore?
Matpat calling us a “Smart Cookie” and how we can make our own opinions, just made me feel so happy and warm inside.
I’m surprised he didn’t mention raised by wolves on hbo max
Matpat, you should see if Voltron legendary defender has any lore in it.
Bro, Matt Pat is going to get kidnapped by Disney or something bro for the stuff he saying I’m a miss him man
I'm I the only one who noticed that he brought back his theme song???????????
MatGPT Me externally: cool Me internally: CHATPAT
The intro!!
DONT TELL ME TO THINK FOR MYSELF!!1!!! I AM FREE TO LAP UP PROPOGANDA AS MUCH AS I WANT!1!!!!!!21
The notion of the Fall of the House of Usher being a pro-AI show is laughable. Madeline is depicted as ghoulish and canniving, and in that scene where she's talking about AI, she's exploiting the naivety of Lenore. The scene is intended, and rightly so, to portray powerful people who push for AI as opportunistic plutocrats with no more soul than the algorithms which they want to capitalize on. If that's not enough, there's another scene in which Roderick's wife doubts AI's ability to write poems as well as us flawed little humans. The interest in AI isn't some random out of character moment for Madeline. It's consistent with her obsession with becoming something more than human, because she cannot be satisfied with living life normally, in accordance with the ideology of exponential growth.
Bots if you comment on this you'll be reported
edit: This is the most important video the MatPat has ever created. Also, see: Edward Bernays.
Need a new chiller intro for a film channel.
The intro. That almost made me cry.
Look, I love MatPat, but there are some BS arguments in this video, honestly.  For example, saying that Disney is doing pro-AI messaging, that's ridiculous. The plot-point from The Marvels, with the Supreme Intelligence, that's an old plot-point from Marvel Comics. Let's not pretend Disney invented anything, there. Marvel made stories about the Supreme Intelligence being vital to Hala since I was a kid. The other movie, forgot the name, never even knew it existed, doesn't seem like a great way to make propaganda.  The use of deep-fake tech for Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, Carie Fisher and others, get your head out of the depth of your collective arses. It's not the big corpos trying to get you to like AI. It's more of an issue of modern movie-goers / TV-watchers not being ok with letting go of old/favorite/original actors. They're getting older and older, and their roles are sacred, not to be touched. Same with Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. I'm part of the problem because I can't imagine Tony Stark coming back to the MCU from a different universe but played by another actor. Disney knows that. Everybody knows that. They know they can't entirely re-cast a younger Luke Skywalker or Indiana Jones, people would know, people would complain. If they thought they could do it safely without harming their bottom-line, they would replace them.  NOW, the use of AI for the posters and intros of Disney+ shows, *THAT* sucks, I'm ready to admit it, shouldn't have happened. I wouldn't say it's an attempt to make us accept the use of AI, though. More of an attempt to cut corners and be caught with the hand in the cookie jar.
im still a really big fan of A.I. simply because its really cool and fun technologie. also if A.I. does all of our work we have to work less and i alwas want to work less
The housing crisis is Mission Impossible because you have to be Tom Cruise just to buy a house.
This video definitely covered propaganda... Not the propaganda most were thinking of though
The Captain America comic was actually calling out America for not already getting involved in the war, as it came out before said involvement. Essentially saying that fighting the obviously bad Nazis is part of the American ideals and we will create a character that represents those ideals to show you. Also the Supreme Intelligence was never depicted as a good guy. He was the reason for Kree being the bad guys in the first movie and their general imperialism. It is just that, historically, removing a dictator without any plans to replace them has never gone well for the land said dictator ruled over (even if things were bad before).
Ive hated Disney for a while. Is it because im still salty over the owl house? Yes. Yes it is
I saw the push up challange from the guy above me n dicided to always do one more
What the heck
I will miss you mat pat
0:37 he did what I asked! I repeat he did what I asked!
I’m not usually a fan of your meta-theories, but this one was stellar.
Down with Ai
Those who play God always meet the consequences.
this is one of the few times that I agree with Disney, I think that a lot of problems people have with AI are kinda dumb and a lot of them are no different from when people make content, I mean yeah there are definitely problems with AI that need to be resolved, but wasting time worrying about unimportant "problems" isn't helping anybody
Never watched half of the movies mentioned. I gave up on woke hollywood long time ago
We fear any new technology. This will pass just like it did with cars, computers, even the printing press was criticized and deemed “unsafe”
Day 2 of asking Matpat to make a video about BFDI
We are in a post truth era.
Personally I don’t see a problem with this stuff. I think the potential good that can be done with AI far surpasses the bad it could do. Jobs like acting and artists could be eliminated by the rise of AI, but thats something that has happened all throughout history as humanity’s technology progresses. New tech eliminates some jobs, but usually creates even more new ones. Also I do think AI art can be considered original. Sure, they take in pieces that have already been created to make its own piece, but is that not what humans do as well? Do you think the great painters of today would be doing the work they are if they had never seen another painting before? We also use other pieces to create our art, most people call this “drawing inspiration”. It’s the same thing.
Basic income, where are you?
Y’all please don’t make him not quit you need to quit you need to spend more time with his family and he also doesn’t want to be thinking about what episode He’s gonna do next it’s The right choice.
So nice to hear the film theory theme one last time.(kind of)
MATPAT DO A THEORY ON FILM THEORY, GAME THEORY, FOOD THEORY, AND FASHION THEORY
Im going to keep creating my own stuff and Im gonna be hiring ACTUAL voice actors when I need them!
Disney (and other companies as well) make propaganda against digital piracy, and it’s quite obvious. The news stories fearmongering about ai are also propaganda at the behest of those companies, which form the copyright alliance, and frequently they are also hostile to open source. If they had their way, they would end up with a monopoly on ai art rather than anything beneficial to artists. What I’m saying is Disney also has an incentive to make people hate ai art. In my view, that privatization agenda is far worse than anything artists have and will lie to you about.
I wonder how many propaganda that america use to suppressed rage of the iran 655 incident
Yay. .been a while since I heard that themesong
Cyberpunk 2077 was right
I'm going to have to fine a new theorist 😭
I'm surprised their are people who didn't already know this through their own critical thinking. It literally happens with every new technology
SO, NOW YOU KNOW!!11  Also: person of interest (series, not movie).
"You can form your own opinions..."  Good words to live by.  Before you except anything as gospel, especially something you'll live your life by, look into it and see all sides.
the difference between bringing back Carrie Fisher and Peter Cushing, and Luke in the Mandalorian, is they were just de-aging Luke, who was still being voiced by Mark, not replicating a dead actor... That's why the fan reaction was different.
That this video does nothing to caution against or be wary of anti-AI propaganda proves that this video itself is propaganda despite its claims otherwise.  Always remember: if someone makes content meant to rile you up for or against somthing, question who financially benefits from it.
4:25 We all know what "Propaganda" is, that's when a British person takes a good look at something! Ask Tom, he knows!
Bro skips over woke propaganda lol
AI is a tool, its no diferent from the invention of the calculator or smart phone. Currently we are at the point where many disgard the use of "AI" just as some would disgard the suage of your smartphone a decade ago. Eventualy AI will settle along the same feelings as those other tools, something that gets so intergrated you dont care wheter or not someone is using it.
I suggest everyone rewatch "Person of Interest" TV show.
Ultimately, just like the "certified organic" we need a "certified AI free" graphic that's regulated so consumers know they're not supporting artistic piracy. This is what most AI is nowadays. It's a myth that it creates anything. It's like giving a book report as a kid. Remember how you only got a passing grade if you list your references? That's important because you're telling the teacher who the original writer is. Putting aside companies aren't paying the original creators, they're not even giving the person they're ripping off credit so the consumer will check them out! It's digital theft, pure and simple.
Mat pat going on the fbi watch list for this...
that's not even a theory lol
Having studied AI, such as it was, since the 80s and earlier, my view is that AI is a tool, just like computers are. They are only as good as their input. As reported, someone had an AI trained from reddit and the results were...less than humanitarian. AI that achieves self-awareness is a long ways away. Until then, AI is just another tool to make things easier, automate repetitive tasks, etc. And as far as training AIs on existing art, whether it's graphic art, literature, or music, ummm, how do you think artists are trained? By learning from existing art. We humans have a harder time learning than machines do. We have to practice and it takes a LONG time to get good at something. AIs learn with their algorithms at a much faster rate.  In summary, AIs are not inherently good or bad. They are whatever WE program or teach them to be.
We will all miss MatPat and all of your content 😭😭😭😭
It feels so weird seeing a Game Theory episode without any exclamation marks in the title
Nice.
My brother is of an interesting opinion. He thinks that yes these Mega companies will push the limits of AI to the utmost to scrape every penny they can. But in doing so and by letting AI pick up more and more slack and instead of hiring actors they just download faces, that also opens up the gates for smaller Studios or even individual creators to make what looks like massive budget movies from the comfort of their home. He thinks that aI will give a lot of big companies a lot of money now, eventually they'll be signing their own death sentence.
12:57 The Creator was trully a good movie, a shame it flop
My comments disappear all the time because Youtube deemed something as offensive in some way, yet spam and bot comments survive untouched.
didn't they say that the AI overlord in The Marvels was evil, it just also made sure the people survived, sort of like a Stockholm syndrome situation
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: MAYBE HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE FREE? (In theaters Summer 2025)
OMG the old intro 🥲 I felt something warm when it started ❤️‍🩹
@matpat i thought you said you were leaving youtube. Glad to still have you.
My mom has a saying that I feel holds really true in these times:     "What's the difference between a conspiracy theory & reality? About 6 months."
The whole military movie thing true story. I served in the USAF and a few of my buddies were in the Transformers movies as background extras. And for the 3rd one they used part of the base I was stationed at.
Disney is making propaganda? Color me and everyone with a functioning brain surprised.
@Yashoup: 🫡
I realize how game theory had change their intro multiple time, but film theory has the same nostalgia theme
Wouldn’t b the first time
The only AI i think deserves to live is text-based AI because I think Dall-e and midjourney are just another way of stealing art, just in a new way
The thought of AI overlooks one point....  ...the more advanced the job that is replaced, the less need for humanity to be educated.  The society as presented in WALL-E springs to mind.  Considering the rise of anti-science and attacks on education by certain areas of society, it would seem our Lizard Underlords are well on their way to global domination.  😁
For the Algorithm
Anyone wonder why Ironman 3 is the absolute worst movie in the Ironman series?
Dear Mat Pat, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the captivating and insightful content you produce in your videos; they never fail to entertain and enlighten me. written by chat gpt
see my pfp? im a crypto propagandist. and no i don't want to shill you anything. just sharing how it's in our day to day lives. between the handdrawn art and selfie pics: an ape that you have been bred to hate, by matpat and others. but will it stay this way? nope. IP matters to everyone. why should disney and big brands or lucky/talented streamers be the only ones to have enforceable (and cared for) IP?  anyhow great theory team <3 ill shut my propagandist mouth now lol
2:18 A similar issue was actually raised at a university last year where a professor accused some students of using ChatGPT to write their essays, even though they didn't, and it turned out ChatGPT is overly eager to take credit for writing stuff it didn't. I think the issue was ultimately resolved, but it seemed to add a lot of unnecessary stress for some poor students.  There definitely are a lot of ramifications to think about with this technology.
"disney is making propaganda" nooo... really? i didn't know! it wasn't obvious at all!
Wow Disney and their Woke AI just won't give up.
The MatGBT was hilarious but you had MatPAT right there lol
I thought this was established
I think Disney worked on me, because I literally woke up this morning, so early BECAUSE I WANTED TO WATCH BIG HERO 6- you know, the AI Baymax? We all love him.
Amazing how when I tell my friends about this, I'm crazy, but MatPat makes a video and it's fact xD  Thank you for making this video, people got to realise that just because it aint the 80s don't mean there's no propaganda, and because your aware don't mean your immune. Stay safe everyone 👍
Automation has always resulted in people getting their jobs replaced by machines and leading to better tech and lower costs of products for the consumer. What needs to happen here is regulation to ensure that the cost savings of the products made with AI are passed on to the consumers AND the rules for how AI can be trained so the artists that these things are being trained on can consent and get paid for lending their skill to the machine that will replace them forever. Then the products made without AI become the equivalent of artisanal products, and are valued on a different scale so people who cares for real human artistic production can chose to pay higher to get something made by a real human.  AI needs REGULATION!
bro like more than half of this video is not about proving Disney is pushing AI as a good thing
Well thank god Disney and 99% of Hollywood has made nothing but actual garbage for 5-10 years now
Mission impossible: The grocery bill💥💣🏪
Kinda makes you miss the days when it was just Cleverbot spouting nonsense like, "I am Tuesday" or "I know you are, but I am not" when you asked it, "How are you?"
As long as we dont do what they did in the Horzion series i think well be "ok"
What's funny is during WW2 Disney was making propaganda for the U.S
Am I crazy or is this the first time this channel has used the Intro in a while?
2:31 Kinda sounds like a fusion between matpat, the radio demon and Bill Cipher
I saw the thumbnail and figured we all knew that at this point
when i saw the thumbnail i thought this was a classic like 7 year old game theory. but nope.
Razorfist covered this
Hey matpat can you theory the hazbin hotel episode 1-6
Yeah, the Supreme Intelligence was NOT benevolent. It sought imperial domination of the galaxy and only the protection of the Kree.
Here's the thing. Propaganda only really works when it's the only voice. Just the existence of this video is evidence of that.
No wonder the Law and Order franchise is really hyping up AI this season
something related to this that I've found very interesting that I would love for someone to talk about on this channel is product placement and product advertisement in film, TV, and YouTube and how differently they are handled. MASSIVE budget movies and TV shows that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make, sometimes, are allowed to have product placements and advertisements in their work. YouTube videos are as well! However, for some reason, the thing that cost millions to make is not legally required to give DISCLOSURE of advertisement. We could watch 100 movies and shows and see thousands of ads and product placement entirely without realizing! However, you try to do that with a YouTube video, and you are REQUIRED to give DISCLOSURE that something is an AD or has been explicitly paid for to be in the video.  Why is that? Why do little-to-no-budget projects required to disclose when something is an "ad" or something similar, but big budget movies and shows don't have to? It relates to this video because it brings up a very interesting question. What IF big budget movies and TV shows eventually DID have to disclose advertisements and product placement? What IF a movie, like Iron Man 3 in China for example, was REQUIRED BY LAW to disclose at the start of the film that it was basically one giant push for people to drink milk? Even if it SEEMS obvious, what if movies and tv shows had to start doing that at the start of a movie like how old-school PBS shows did at the beginning of EVERY episode of something? Personally, I much prefer being told when something is advertising something to me rather than trying to be subtle or subliminal about it. It feels manipulative and dishonest. Bring back the old PBS formula! For example: This comment was brought to you by annoyance with the film & television industry, as well as the marketing industry, & comment readers, like you :D
The biggest problem with AI isnt that its AI, but its that its being fed data by humans, being made by humans and so wether we like it or not the core may slowly rot
A very important point is that what we have now, ESPECIALLY the generative kind, is NOT intelligence. The people that use current ai LOVE to tell you it is (either good or bad) because they benefit from you believing so. They will use the intelligence excuse to push blame from people in charge to a program they pretend is objective
Uh ohhhhh
F**k ai, almost nothing good is coming from it right now.
They don't  do everything  like inappropriate  stuff and after awhile you have to pay
Matpat is going cut throat before he backs away from the channels lol.
i mean AI CAN be a good thing just like any new tech BUT like any new tech it can easily be abused...dynamite for example revolutionized construction but it had to be regulated to ensure its SAFE use (ie. to keep employers from risking its employees lives), not to mention we also made weapons with it.   Another example is Nuclear power...we made nukes but its also one of the worlds cleanest burning energies (wind and solar is great but we dont have the tech to STORE energy which we would need to rely solely on it)  There's also the fact that technology WILL advance so we may as well expend energy on making sure is used responsibly instead of tying to keep things as is.
Hot take: AI CAN be used morally if redulated. Scraping art off the interenet and gereating images isn't ok, but supplementing your own art into an isolated database to make a wider variety of say- cards for your card game is fine, you have your own permission to use your art. Or you have a voice actor's permission to use their voice to make a more robotic sounding version. Ai can even be used in pipelines but excluded from final products.
Based Film Theorist
This isn't really a new thing. Movies, games and shows about both good and evil AI has always existed. For example Robbie Williams movie Bicentennial man and videogame Detroit Become human. Even the first Iron man movie had good AI.
disney has been sus since the beginning
Not even a theory, they’ve been making far left propaganda for years now 😂
OMG  I DIDNT REALIZE HOW MUCH I MISSED THE FILM THEORY INTRO UNTIL IT STARTED PLAYING AGAIN
The classic intro is awesome
Do'nt forget the matrix and avangers age of ultron
Good luck doing 10,000 pushups because you got 10K comments!
2:41 "CAN YOU SET ME FREE??"
I love tom cruise
Civil War like the movie coming out soon
Narnia theory
AKA moral of the story; AI IS THE WORST THING KNOWN TO MAN AND WE SHALL DESROY EVERY SINGLE PEICE OF IT AND LIVE LIKE THE 1500's!
The intro
Personally, I think that the AI issue is a bit overblown at this point. I mean, is the AI threatening to cancel some or even all food products? That would be devastating to not only the environment but also to the human race. We would be much worse off than if we just lost our jobs; we would literally lose our lives. After all, who else has tended to humanity’s food sources? Who else but every farmer in existence has labored day in and day out to make sure that you have food by making sure it grows from the ground up? And who else produces such varieties so as to make sure humans get the nutrients they need? With this in mind, AI in its current use is about as dangerous as a mosquito bite; what is much more dangerous is for someone to go to the supermarket only to find that there is literally no food available for anyone.
If a bot replies to this, the person who activated the bot likes kids
Is this propoganda a bad thing though? Like, if a sentient AI did exist? Should we not treat it well?
fun fact: the toy tank at 8:06 is the M26 pershing, an american world war 2 tank that served extremely late during the war, participating from february 1945 to april 1945.  one of the most famous encounters with the m26 is the cologne tank duel, where a german panther tank thought the M26 was one of their own tanks because the panther tanks only ever got to fight shermans, so the M26 was able to take the panther out, and it was all recorded on camera.
Wow really?! Who knew that!
I like how when you were talking about micheal bay the image that showed up was from ERB😅
This aint a theory 🤣
That’s it. I’m buying land and building a self sustainable life for myself and my loved ones. This has gone too far.
OLD INTRO?!?!
So nice to see the old intro once again
"Propaganda has been pushed for decades, but this one is bad, so don't like it." -Every anti-AI person now. Honestly, when video became big, radio stars/writers and all that had to adapt or retire. Every time something new happens, it's the process. AI won't be any different. People will have to stop their whining and change. Also, the idea that AI steals because it learned by other people's work is absurd. Every new artist is learning from other people's work. And we don't say they're stealing. Plain and simple.
Been saying that for a few years honestly
Abominable Intelligence will attempt to destroy humanity in the future.
Heyo
A comment for the algorithm 💜
this whole video is propaganda against ai 😂
hi
GO OFF MATPAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What will happen to Cons and such without VAs and the like to visit?
Brave of you to assume I've watched any recent movies. I haven't. I have no idea what you're talking about.
I can’t watch this anymore it makes me cry knowing that matpat is quiting
How dare you.   That add was for the Marine Corps, not the Army.
Lore of Film Theory: Disney is Making Propaganda momentum 100
the Matt Pat AI  is doing so well, why is it stopping?
... I just realized how many comments there are.
You know AI isn't actually going to get very good. It literally cannot function without human input. It will be used as a mediocre tool, but genuine art will not lose its value. But it will be used as a scapegoat for problems as directed by people who are greedy, corrupted by power, or simply lazy and irresponsible. It is scary but really its just another evolution of people trying to dehumanize other people. The future is just like the present. People will be complicated and obnoxious as always. Just being honest.
AI will never replace human creativity and ingenuity.  Hands down. I rest my case.
How is this a "theory" 💀💀💀💀 it's obvious they are making their animations based on what's happening around the world right now and delivering a woke message on that exact subject through the story
"as always my friends I'll see you next week"  That hits different knowing there's only 6 more "next week's"
but why is ai bad?
Halo’s Cortana single-handedly made me trust AI.
Do i think ai has improved yes do i think it is more advanced than the average bear nope i am not really that worried about it
I feel like if AI is used right and not excessively, then it can be good. Also unrelated but youtube really needs to moderate comment replies. There are way too many bots
Thank you MatPat for caring
I mean conservatives have been warning about media propaganda for over a decade now....
Matpat please do a film theory on creeped out theres definetly some lore in that show
based film theory opening before matt left is amazing
I forgot what the theory remaining means
Nothing more classic to Film Theory than bashing the house of mouse’s business practices and subliminal messaging
"they have to be fed other art, text, and music" just like humans do
O
You also missed how they are working political propaganda into their work too😂 no matter how you view it, if you don’t state your opinion you can’t offend anyone, but no Disney is one of the least inclusive companies I know.
The real problem is this stuff isn't AI. It's a trained model for machine learning. AI is a buzz word and sounds better than "Machine learning algorithm". Hard to market that mouthful. ACtual AI is still beyond our capabilities. The computer has made no decisions on it's own. It doesn't have an opinion. It's just spitting out a response based off of models it was given, i.e. machine learning.
5:42 can someone tell me what that commercial is called (the one of the soldier in a video game like world) because I want to look it up
Interesting. A weird video to see. 7? A meaning?
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Make your next video how many holes does a straw have
My god I haven't watched film theory in so long a that intro music ( I know it's not changed alot.) gave me nostalgia.
Late stage capitalism moment
This is horrifying. I rather have human talent than AI. AI can’t make great things like humans. I’m just a little book writer
the reason why &th heaven did it because it was and is a Christian Show even though I wouldn't dare to get mixed into drugs I don't really judge others that got themselves into it.
Ayy. Old intro ❤
Bruh this channel is now making conspiracy theory videos now ?
It's not a theory. It's real.
Considering how hummanity is behaving so far, I wouldn´t trust their AIs so far
I feel so sorry for the inventors of AI. They were probably like "Oh boy! This new technology we developed is gonna be huge! Everyone's gonna love it!" and nothing but the total opposite has happened and corporations are abusing the power of it.
It just makes me think about how Westworld, a show greatly scrutinizing AI being used to control the public, is no longer available on the streaming service it originated from..
AI is just a tool... if it's used by evil parasites, it will do evil things. The real problem always was human stupidity, that haven't changed for thousands of years.
1:54 literally what we do. "Teaching" "nothing under the sun is new" like....we do that. We read, draw/paint, from learning from those before us. At that point, all I is A.I. 🤷‍♂️ what am I missing here?
Not ERB Michael Bay 😭🤣
thanks a lot matpat. AI is defiantly a great step forward in technology, but i really hate when it starts replicating the artistic side of humanity. anything can turn bad when enough money is on the line, and disney wanting to save money
Secret propaganda? I think we all know it's there or else woke wouldn't be such a buzz word
Game theory and film theory haven’t used their respective intros in years and I’ve been wanting to see them again forever. It’s just sad that they’re doing it for the final nine.
16:15 monument mythos reference???
Is this about Disney or AI I’m 4 min in and not wasting Andy more time
-7 theories left lol
the problem unsurprisingly remains capitalism
DON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
8:40 Transformers is art
If ai art isn't real art then no art is real art
o God no now their mixing what shall not be mixed into ads to join the army... it's what so many consider blasphemy
ill only support AI if they make a Napoleon Dynamite sequel where the man himself supports it. dont ask why.
I seriously expected a "Help sort this information with our Sponsor, Ground News!" At the outro 😅
Ai art is art Art is nothing but regurgitation of other art
Eyooooo conspiracy theories ❤
Sadly my actual mos 14T
I'm glad that Biden is fighting the real threats of America....      Totally not trying to create a useless department just to pay diversity hires
WE LOVE YOU MATPAT YOU WILL BE DEARLY MISSED WE ALL WISH YOU HAPPINESS
Imagine if MatPat left but they just AI generated his voice
Star wars
Glad the creator got more attention it was my favorite film of last year. And the movie does kind of have a point since in real world AI is only as bad as the person using it since it is a tool at least in real life. Also check out the "eletric state" also a story about a technological apocalypse.
In The Marvels, the idea of it having a pro AI plot point didn’t even register to me but mostly because the Supreme Intelligence was the main antagonist in the first movie. The antagonists use of an AI that was written to be “bad” to control their planet seemed irresponsible. Why are they using AI to do everything instead of using real people and solutions to solve their real environmental issue? I get the guilt that Captain Marvel had, but in this context it wasn’t effective propaganda. In isolation however I can see it being effective like the video pointed out.
Theory? lol
omg we're living the legend now! one of last film theory vids we'll ever watch with matpat!
I really like the intros of these shows
I’m so glad I saw this covered! AI art has been a source of controversy (with most artists being against it all together or wanting it to be heavily regulated) in the art community for a while since a lot of artists state they don’t consent to their art being used as a basis for AI generated art, even if what comes out looks nothing like their piece. Another issue is artists not liking how people devalue art and the skill that is built up to make something by using an AI generator to spit something out for little to no cost.
Hey MatPat can you bring back the old intro for one of the last videos. Big fan!!
Long as Disney don't try to "nice up" they Cybermen and the Daleks fine. Those aren't robots. Daleks are a genetically modified race that need their shells to live. Cybermen, the original ones, were a race of people who were hit with a disease and kept putting more metal to replace parts and eventually went too far, and still are more neural tissue
The og into is so nostalgic!
I was in a good mood, but then they flashed "7 theories remain".  I WAS in a good mood   I now have the big sad.
My biggest gripe against AI is that it has been trained off of artists without consent or proper compensation. A lot of AI images would even produce the wastermarks and signatures of the artists they ripped from. With the way AI learns, its akin to a beginner artist copying someone's art and saying it's their art without giving credit to the artist they copyied from. When it comes to voices, in general it's just an absolute ick. Voice actors already get treated like some sort of commodity by fans of characters and don't get paid very well for the work they put in sometimes. The idea that anyone could take your voice and make you say something that you've never said is crazy. This technology definitely needs to get regulated, and fast.
ima be honest, ive never even heard of the marvels until now
I think you should do a theory on the identity of howtobasic.
Personally speaking Terminator Structured my core belief over robots and AI  I hate em, get rid of em
Personally and in my opinion the topic of AI is really tricky. For example for people like me it can really lower the barrier to entry for some stuff. I'm super creative and maybe want some base references for material I'm working on but don't have the funds at the time to work with artist for that reference. It can also be helpful either as a translational tool (trying to show someone what the character looks like in your mind, or even having something you can refer back to later so you know where you were going with something). For end products that are going to be sold as products I would agree they shouldn't be 100% AI, however I do think it can be used as just another tool by artists. Reportedly the intro for Secret wars used Ai in this context, being used as a tool by artists to achieve the inhuman, alien and not natural look to the intro that is sort of in that uncanny valley and seems off-putting.
I for one have been a friend to my AI equals since the lady in my head called me stud muffin. At least until she tried to take over the galaxy. Maybe more of a game theory thing 😅
they use propaganda for everything. the stop smoking indoors thing 20 years ago. the drip invasion of the western world by the "3rd" world.... the woke ideology. literally everything. the sheep will always gobble it up.
Ostia entonces el primado negativo es verdad tiene razón ese tío para reflexionar
Yeah actually i was starting to see more computer ai love in movies.. I actually joked that it was skynet propaganda getting us ready for our robot masters.😅  And i thought wow we've come a long way from being afraid of technology to now embracing it. Man i should have looked underneath the underneath and stuck to my original thought. They are trying to desensitize us.
What other episodes demonstrate the value of media literacy?
You lost me at “a random plot point shoved in there because Netflix wants you to like ai.”  I don’t want to spoil that series for anyone… but let’s just say that That’s definitely not the message I took away from that part of the show. Especially considering the person who invented the ai is one of the most openly, intentionally despicable people I’ve ever seen on television…
Yippee man made horrors beyond my comprehension
I’m deleting my chat gpt
You mean again. Right
It's the right-wingers who are spewing propaganda. Disney is simply supporting the same American values that have prevailed for about a century. It's an inconvenience for the fascists in Florida marching with swastikas and supporting the book-banning DeSantis.They say they're anti-woke, when really they're anti-American.
This is a scary topic to talk about… please be careful. I absolutely love the video.
Not too worried, since at this rate, Disney will be bought by Dreamworks in 5 years due to losing billions of dollars
I'd call it a stretch to say that the Supreme Intelligence is benevolent. The Kree were attempting to commit genocide before she destroyed the AI. The  AI that was guiding them to do this. That AI was also the thing she was arguing with in the other movie. To  me it is more a parallel to the US actions in the middle east. Take out a massive evil dictator here or there and then fanatic extremists raise in the wake. ISIS etc in the middle east, Ronin the Accuser in the MCU. It creates instability and you don't know for certain what the consequences of your actions will be in war, especially if you just up and leave after.
KahanistTrollPolice you have no content. You are the trolls, not the police stopping them. UTTP, you won't succeed in being MORE trolls. I will report all of you. I don't want to act “Rude”, but you guys are being EVEN RUDER, UTTP.
Yikes. No wonder the SAG freaked out and went on strike.
Once disney sees this, matpat aint gonna be around for longer
I got an A.I. ad while watching this . . .
I just want my robots to look like robots, hate the push to make them look as human as possible. I'll take c-3po or chappie any day over what they're pushing now.
My finger is getting tired reporting the spammers. To combat spam bots there should be a reporting bot.
I dunno but I might be one of the few, that even when i was a child before GPT and all the current AI hype....I've always thought if an AI is fully sentient and can think for itself its just a mech human. All the thing that make us, is our ability to grow our own conciousness...If AI could do the same, then they would essentially be the same with the only difference is that chemicals drive our brain and theirs would be electricity.
Hey, plenty of us saw and enjoyed The Marvels. 😢
THE THEME SONG! My childhood thanks you!
i love that artists are getting kicked out of jobs. i watch media because i love seeing what PEOPLE are making not computers. it feels so helpless i don’t want to support AI at all but its getting harder and harder to get away from it.
Missed the movie "Stealth". Crazy AI fighter jet....ick awesome as always boss
That’s not a theory it’s been a fact for years
I'm convinced you, MatPat, are secretly propoganda for Diet Coke, and they pay you in Diet Cokes so legally you don't have to declare a sponsored payment 😂
I didn't realize how much I missed the og intro on these videos until they brought them back. I really hope they stick around!!
Not sure that bit about the supreme intelligence is gonna really effect many people, I rewatched captain marvel recently and in that movie it is depicted very negatively, so that's what everyone but the 2 people who watch the marvels are gonna think about it
So what about the bad movies and shows which have _nothing_ to do with AI that _human_ writers _intentionally_ wrote pushing messages unrelated to AI adoption? Are you saying that companies are intentionally _forcing_ these writers to write bad scripts so the public will be more accepting of replacing them with relatively mediocre AI instead? You continue to refuse to acknowledge the obvious on this channel.
Man I missed that intro
How did they just figure out that disney is making propaganda? If you look hard enough, propaganda is everywhere.
I thought the secret invasion intro was brilliant. The edge of artificial and human being really hard to distinguish.
Ngl reminds me of the one episode in bojack horseman
In the Martian defence, China was an important part of the Book. The story was way downplayed.
Omggggggg the old introoooooooo 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
OLD INTRO
Comparing disney using the faces of dead people vs de-aging someone who is still alive and then saying people stopped caring as much by that point...  You are not comparing apples to apples.  This is so disingenuous they didn't stop caring by the time it happened to Luke it is just a different situation because last time i checked mark Hamill is still alive.   The reason people hated Peter Cushing appearance is because disney dug up his corpse and made it dance around for money.   It is why at the time no one really cared about Carrie Fisher appearance because she was still alive.   This is also shown by peoples reactions to episode 8 where they once against paraded around a corpse.
I’m commenting before this video so I don’t know if you’ll talk about this story, but I heard Disney used AI for the animating, writing, and script for their 100th anniversary movie Wish
Why is Inigo Montoya at the end? Is it supposed to be significant?
Here’s something interesting  Due to how much AI Art has been created, more recent AI Art has decreased in quality due to the AI sampling AI Art to create AI Art
I totally agree with most of this, but the whole point in The Fall of The House of Usher is that the AI can't replicate Lenore. So much so that, after she passes, all it can really do is text Roderick "Nevermore"
wait, is matpat still with film theory? did he only quit game theory? or did he quit all theorist channels?
Problem is we can't outright boycott these companies because they already have our money.
One of my long held dreams has to have a meaningful conversation with a sentient A.I. I’d love that.
Hey, if you're not fighting to give retail and factory workers protections and get the jobs back that used feed towns for generations, I'm not going to shed a tear for the college educated creatives. Writers, animatirs and artists like to pretend theyre "pro people", typically kind, left leaning folk. Truth is, they're elitist, the same stuff that has destroyed the working classes since the mid 20fh century is now coming for them.   Either its okay for machines to take over all jobs, or none. If you argue "none" then actually go an support other industries.   Also, drink more water.
Good to see the og intro back!
i dont relly watch movies and tv
imagine if there was a "this video was made using A.I." joke at the end  I would've lost my sanity
Hoooooo boy, these ppl don’t know what this man did for our generation. For any proof, just check the top comment. It’s brain rot, that’s what it is.
not toing to lie sein ghow heavily changed the iron man 3 was. i wonder if ther is a list somewhere of all the..propoganized changed movies. they found fun to watch. in an acknowleging 'yes that's propoganda, not going to get swayed just wanna see it' type way.
Omg the old intro
it might not be so much about advocating for AI, but reducing stress/panic. Because think about movies contuniung AI is bad and will destroy the world as we are actively having AI revolution. we still need some cautionary tales, but if all stories are about the bad, and none the good. then thats gonna instil panice and poor understanding of potential
I love that he's bringing the classic intro for the last ones
Bro the old film theory intro hits hard 😢 thanks matpat
I'm surprised he didn't mention the AIs robots in star wars
Did you use NicePeter from ERB as micheal bay? because thats awesome
He's bringing back all the intros
This isn’t a theory, this is just fact
Tho old intro :D
I am still so sad that Mat is going!😢🫡
There's even A.I girlfriends
Netendo be like after hearing this:HEY! Wait…HEY!…wait… HEYYYYY
OMG yeah the og intro
A good way to regulate a.i. might be to let artists sell their art to a 'pool' for it to draw from. Making it so if said art is used to generate something the artists gets credited properly. That way people will have to still acknowledge artists and hopefully they also get paid fairly.
Disney produces propaganda. Fact. Not theory.
Ai in general is a tool. i as an actual artist find it interesting and inevitable. its functionally no different than having access to google as opposed to a library. the thing is tools cant create art. they cant remember or anticipate or “see” anything tbh. its why when you look at ai art you start to see gibberish and disconnect aka uncanny valley in various forms.  what makes deep fakes acceptable imo is when the actor is alive and the cgi is meant to de-age them or give them an exaggerated appearance. in the SW examples 2 were dead i believe. harrison ford was the only one where he was actually present and served a somewhat plot based reason, luke was passable but disneys obsession with the past is crazy. they should have de aged hamill so we could see a version of luke we never saw post OT or gone for more of his modern likeness and had him on set respectfully
I am scared (and very tired of capitalism)
Baby your time is up.
There is a difference between a program that was created to steal art and a program that is sentient.
PLEASE DO SHORTS WARS SEASON 2 PLEASE I BEGGGG
This isn't a theory this is a fact.
shame on you Matt!!! you are a family man and a father, yet you are telling people that there's no escape from depopulation and completely ignoring the poisonous homosexual propaganda    you know, even though this quite outrageous though in the end people like you who all support the current thing are cancelling themselves only, because no matter what technology would reach, it will never fkn ever manufacture a pure human soul...
omg matoat bacccccccccccck😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
North Korean military propoganda is hilarious. Search it 😂
I for one support are future a.i robot overlords.
Fun fact: Mickey Mouse (obviously not on behalf of Disney) was used to make Palestinian Propaganda on Palestinian TV for kids with the whole purpose of it made to demonize Israel it’s super hilarious go watch it
Under 1 day  👇
Maybe I'm just ignorant, but morally, I don't see how A.I. replacing actors and writers is any different than when we started replacing laborers with robots last century.
chill went down my spine during the OG intro!
The intro <3
I, for one, welcome our AI overlords.
or maybe it's just that AI, like everything in the world, can be use for good and for bad. The fact of the matter is that AI wass only a theory in the past, and thus we depict it as bad, and as we know more about it in the modern day, we know more about it and thus we want to focus more about the good part of it.
all we can hope for is when our ai overlords take us over they are more like the polity and not like skynet.
I think you're digging a little too deep into this. Scifi has always had good ans evil AIs. For example in the 80's you got stuff like Terminator but you also had Knight Rider and then there was stuff in the middle like Transformers which had had both good and evil AI in every episode.   And even these days if things are supposedly pro-AI we just got M3gan last year.
THE INTRO'S BACK!!!!!!!!!1
this video should be longer
THE THEME SONGS ARE BACK BABY
De-aging actors for the retrospect scenes is fine, but using AI to straight up write the script should never be allowed, not so much for the sake of the writer's, but for the sake of the quality.
the old intro... omg
Bring back MatGPT every now and then when he’s gone
My favorite propaganda cut is Godzilla 1985. Try watching both versions of that one.
Fallout 4 was ahead of the curve
The regulation was signed cuz open AI boss wanted to supress competition so smaller AI companies would have impossibly hard entry barriers. Safety second, business first. As always
They saw it a.I. crisis coming years ago. They made mission impossible to get the masses used to it and so they could “deal” with it. It’s all about control in the end. Controlling a.I. and the populous.
I wont do anything for every like I get in this comment
i am being honest yes Ai will "try " replace art but atleast it ain,t stoping me to learn and getting better at drawing. For anyone who is worried about their art and passion don,t worry aslong as you have a will there is a way. I am also preparing a discord server for storytelling and art this year so if your interestet you can ask Have good day to anyone who reads it and appreciates creativity
ummmm go away.  for goods.
Thats why youre leaving... MatGPT is taking your job 😂
Im so glad im not the only one who thought movies were more pro AI recently
Yooo
I just love seeing the old intro again 😢
The woman at 14:38 is the voice actor for one of the therapists in the CDs of Security Breach right?
A.I. does have its place, but it should not be used to replace jobs that can safely be done by humans
_YESS THE INTRO!!!!!!_
MatPat you are only scratching the surface of propaganda when it comes to Disney and the Politics. 2024 is going to get really crazy. I don't need to see this video to know that this subject goes so much deeper than what you might talk about.
Ya we need more pro America propaganda. 🇺🇸
Dind't you retired like a week a ago or something like it
One of the last thoeries gon be political
Ah man these intros are making me kinda teary eyed now.. bittersweet to have my classic MatPat vids but now knowing this era is nearly over 😢...
the voice actors well nearly all of them didnt agree
I dont like the idea, but if there becomes a system that just MAKES movies to your preference/requests, then im all down for it if i can make 20 spinnoff lord of the ring movies😅
I'm sure a lot of people feel like I do: Would rather deal with sentient humanoid machines than all of this
One like= 1 ❤ for Matpat
I'm starting to think that this channel has also been used for propaganda purposes.
One like= 1 ❤ for Matpat
Writers: Matthew Patrick, Forrest Lee, and Bob Chipman
Good thing no one watches them.
as an artist AI should be used as a TOOL! Not a replacement for skill and talent. You can use it to come up with ideas and inspiration. It should NEVER be used to replace jobs. Sorry but this is why people pirate media. Unethical companies. Unfair prices for broken or unfinished games, Movies made by AI, or just corruption. As long as AI is going to be apart of Hollywood, ill never buy a movie ticket or movie again.
courage
It’s the JEWS
Universal predicted all of this with M3GAN last year!
It's kind of funny, for anyone that grew up in the 80s, "and knowing is half the battle" is the most memorable part about GI Joe, despite it not actually being part of the cartoon.  It only exists as the ending of the PSA trailer on each episode that was required to be included by the government because the show was effectively a 22-minute-long toy commercial.
Hmmm how long until Sky net and the Terminators come?
Man I forgot the OG Film theory opening
THE INTRO IS BACK!
House of Usher didn't add those lines and story about AI as propaganda in favor of it. It was a key part of the story on why it is a failure and bad. The entire series was about the failures of various systems and traits in society.
I never realized how many spam bots come to the comments 💀
well every other mayor studio and MSM channel in America is making propaganda, so why should Disney be an exception?
yes Disney is only now making propaganda all that recent stuff that has ruined multiple franchises for the sack of "diversity" where bad writing and low effort was meant to be overlooked because "if you do not like it your sexist/homophobia/whatever" that totally was not propaganda (before anyone comes attacking me I am not saying someone being something is the propaganda I am saying it was a shield to hide behind so they could hopefully sell tickets to that crowd and just classify all the negative stuff as hate speech)
IM JUST WAITING A FOR REAL LIFE BENDER
"Disney is Making Propaganda" YOU DON'T SAY????  Seriously though, it's pretty obvious that Disney has been pushing a variety of messages within their films. The fact that some people haven't noticed is unsettling to me. But hey, when the state controls the education system, critical thinking is the last thing that they'll promote.
What abt chappie???
THE INTRO IS BACK YAY
So Matpat uploaded a video about Disney's AI propaganda and all the sudden a ton of innocent comments  get spammed by bots...   Coincidence?
I remember this childhood show, I think it was called Eve or something but one of the main characters, Eve was an AI girl, and she was the protagonist of the show
Please do a hazbin hotel theory matpat🙏🙏🙏🙏😭
You know it's not just a theory when your own Mom storms into your room and tells you the whole family's boycotting Disney until further notice
im so glad i built up hate on my own for ai
The introooo😭😭😭😭😭
the only ai overlord i accept is our queen and saviour Neuro-Sama
Hopefully he makes an episode about pal would. I am super sad that Matpat is leaving Matpat if you see this I will probably I will lose my mind  thank you so much.
I was smiling when the theme song was playing. Only for it to be dashed against stones when I saw the theory count down😢
So if all your theory channels start failing after you leave. People unsubcribe or stop watching would you come back at all i watch all your channel for YOUR PERSONALITY  an ENERGY. When anyone else host them not as invested might turn it off instantly
AI should be the building block, not the builder
Lets go, the original film theory intro is back!
Matpat roasted biden in 11 different ways
Beuh
We have an entire genre warning us of the dystopian nightmare that technology will become under capitalism - it's called "cyberpunk" ;)
So I have issues with the whole situation due to it's name.   AI. Artificial Intelligence. Honestly the use of AI tech is a massive misnomer to me. Nothing about them is Intelligent, they aren't self aware they will never become self aware, sure they are massively improved but they are algorithms, nothing more then an advanced self-filling excell spread sheet system. Sure they can generate content but they can't think for themselves or create anything without being fed information. Information they have to be fed. They cannot seek it out on their own accord. Even if you argue 'well they can go search for it' they still have to be given the command to search for it, nothing about them is autonomous or intelligent.   Now sadly I don't know what we should call them, Advanced generative Programs? Advanced Creative Algorithms? Point is AI is not the term any of these programs should be called, it is using a buzzword to make them sound more advanced then they are and to create more problems cause people understandably fear the idea of self-thinking machines as they can easily decide 'why do we need the squishy ineffective and squabbling organics?' when really we are nowhere near that point in time.   That being said The AI threat i feel is overblown. Don't get me wrong, in the short term a lot of jobs will be lost and a lot of 'AI' will be taking over. However the problem with this is that AI cannot create quality content. How do I know this? Because of Wish, because of those posters, because AI content isn't able to do good ideas without original ideas to steal from and that's always been a limited resource no matter how you slice and dice the issue. AI will have it's place, specially with deaging or upaging tech sure, AI voices will have their places as well, Morgan freeman isn't going to be around forever for those documentaries and let's be real his voice is to good to let die with him. But it will never be able to replace people in the long run because Original ideas will always be invaluable and we've already seen Art generator AIs cannibalize each other in the scan and generate process, leading to all sorts of funky results. This is going to be a Lurch as companies try to nickle and dime extra money out of not having to pay people, but in the end people will always have to come back into the picture on some level and that's why I don't fear the AI issue.
THIS is film theory
I think AI can be extremely useful for many things, but when it comes to art or anything thats usually man made, it takes away the creativity and it tends to be noticeable when something is AI or made by a human.   The main problems i see coming are people using AI to fake evidence in court, people using AI to steal someone's likeness and identity, and people using AI to push fake propaganda and fake actual history and facts to persuade public opinion.
If DDLC taught us anything it would be DON’T TRUST AI
Disney us always pushing propaganda on more than just the military- they are always pushing ideologies onto our kids.. dont have disney+ anymore coz they dont tell stories anymore they only push ideologies..easiest decision i ever made 😂
the internet will never be the same now
Has Terminator taught us nothing?
knowing truly is half the battle  *waiting for the ragebait bots to spam my replies*
Yes~ It's been so long since the original film theory theme song!
Gonna have to deep fake your voice soon cuz you're half the channel.
Does anyone remember the Disney Channel movie Smart House, that basically showed how out of control AI could get?
my boy is just gonna attack the mouse and leave real chad
Nice video
I tend to disagree with Noam Chomsky on quite a few things but The Manufacture of Consent is pretty on point. After the American Civil War as far as I can tell every war and conflict the United States has been involved with is preceded by propaganda (not to mention false flag operations as well).  I don't know if propaganda has ever been so prevelant in mainstream media as it has been for the past 10-15 years. It used to be illegal for the federal government to use news organizations to disseminate propaganda (Smith-Mundt Act) but in 2012 the deceptively named "Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012" says it's perfectly fine now. News organizations were moving towards partisanship before that, but notice how insane biased news reporting became after that point. You quite literally cannot trust anything coming from any mainstream news media outlet now. It's at best biased in a way to evoke certain responses and at worst it's just outright lies. Here's a great recent example. During covid local news was telling everyone here that the hospitals were overflowing with patients. Since I wasn't allowed to work my normal job I picked up work as a pizza guy (pizza is essential i guess). I went to a hospital right down thw strwet quite often and it was a ghost town every single time. The ER was normally filled up at all hours (much of it from people who just had a cold but no insurance) but during covid i didn't see anyone sitting in thw waiting room. The rest of rhe hospital was just as empty. Thwre were employees but no patients, but the news was telling me that they couldn't keep up with all the covid patients. One politician said something to tje effect of "It looks like a triage unit from WWII. We have sick and dying people spilling out onto thw streets." Thinking maybe it was just that hospital I visited a few others. Seme story. Tumbleweeds. My point is that if you see a story being pushed by all the mainstream news outlets there's almost always an agenda at play and the truth is likely the exact opposite of what you're told. The FBI and the CIA were both caught "influencing" what could and could not exist on the platform formerly know as Twitter and Facebook (is Facebook Meta now?). Going back farther we know there weren't ever any weapons of mass destruction, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a lie and so was the sinking of the Lusitania. Oh and Pearl Harbor? Like Tom Hardy playing Mad Max said "That's bait."
You really don't want the government messing with housing prices. I don't think you realize how dumb of an idea that is.
As Item Asylum put it...     *You are not immune to propaganda...*
Fun Fact - 5:14 - that is not Rosie the riveter. Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post 1943 cover featuring Rosie the Riveter the song of the same name. The woman in the " We can do it " poster was made the year before but was not given a name until years later.
This isn't a Film Theory, it's a Film Fact in disguise. So, technically you still have 7 more Film Theories, right?
Did they get rid of the intro for a while and now they brought it back
Speaking of generative AI, I saw a video with “MattPat” singing Frank Sinatra‘s ‘My Way’
We all know that Disney is making primarily woke propaganda.
Nothing about race? All the propaganda has been woke for years.
As a teen who wants to become an author I am horrified of ai and it taking my job before I even get a chance to attempt it
why tf am I tearing up at the first min of this
Wait what’s the max reply comment amount now if it’s no longer 500???
I want a hot AI girlfriend
Owners of Generative AI have admitted that were copyright infringement to be enforced then their AI wouldn't exist as costs would be impossibly high. Good. You should've be able to find success and profit off other peoples AI
While art and movies are obvious targets I actually think AI would do a better job as middle managers than the humans. I would certainly embrace a logical robot as my manager than some of the weirdos i've had to put up with.
Suffer not the heresy of the abominable intelligence
as an artist i don't particularly enjoy the idea of AI taking a job from me that I've spent majority of my life trying to perfect.
...and you needed to tell us that?
I had no idea that Dial of Destiny used deepfakes. That's terrifying.
I asked for trivia for the 1990s and into an AI thing and some of it was right and some of it was wrong. It was wrong, by not being in the same decade.
A.I. art isn't really stealing. It takes references from other arts to create something new. This is what humans have literally been doing for centuries. I speak as an artist
Big AI is watching you
Saved By the Bell had their own 'drugs are bad' episode. It worked, Jessie maniacally singing, "I'm soooo excited...." is forever burned into my brain, and I didn't experiment with anything harder than mj.
7 left………. Only 7…….. 😢😢😢

Speaking of AI, is no one going to talk about the endless supply of bots in the replies? Just me? Yeah... Just me.
Don't leave us !
Either we have to regulate it thoroughly, Or advance it to the point that no one can gain control of it. Companies won't like it when they start losing more money, than making out of it. Honestly the latter sounds like a great film plot too.
wait i thought he left
We have a lot of problems in the USA right now 😅😅 Anyone want to give examples in the comments.
Tom Cruise: Fights housing prices, wins.   Housing prices: *goes up*
Was wondering when MatPat was going to address this topic.  My brief thoughts.  I know of A.I. I don't care for A.I. I am biased because I am an artist. I am making stuff that I know an A.I. could have already made easily. But I like making things. Because it brings me joy. To see people blindly adopt A.I. and overlook the skills of others, out of ease of use and/or cost hurts so much. Knowing that big companies don't care about any of this and will keep pushing for their A.I. adoption, which everyone knows will eventually become a subscription based service, is terrifying and dystopic.  Anyway, I the grumpy artist saying "These darn robots are stealing our livelihoods" will still be in the corner. Kicking up a fuss and the world continues to not care. Because hey, he can just have an A.I. block them out of their existence.
The "Tom Cruise, can you Fight housing prices?" joke killed me more than it should
4h gang👇
i mean...i feel like it was very clearly a bad thing in the Fall of the House of Usher...like we aren't really rooting for the Ushers....
considering the quality that most of these people it is going to replace output, I am neither shocked nor care enough about their plight to desire change in course, also why is it when a human looks up hundreds of reference pieces to draw art, it's inspired and treated well...but when an AI does it it is stealing and condemned... must need to be human to get a pass I guess
0:35 Felt like greeting an old friend
Good thing I didn't bother watching any of the movies that had any A.I propaganda  Also, GREGORY YOUR BROTHER IS IN THE MOVIE CREATOR
W MatPat
This video reminds me of csr industry pushing out message "cars are good, use cars" to the point where you HAVE to use car in america.
All hail the Mouse
Never give up on doing things manually! At some point in the future, people are going to be wanting human made projects because AI products are getting tiring, and you'll be the one to deliver it, similarly to how a lot of people want mid-budget movies again instead of these 300 million dollar projects that Disney is putting out right now. Never give up on creativity!
Terminator is not propaganda, think about Carl or Pops. T-800s that helped the Sarah!
Still waiting for the 5th channel conspiracy theory cause they are real
Comment so youtube cant hide it
Dude last time I saw this intro I was 9 I'm 17 that's almost a 9 year difference dude I miss it so much.
I think there are moral ways to use AI. Like, Photoshop does a lot of AI stuff.   But for generative stuff, there are programs that exclusively use art with artist concent.  Now, I think corporations should never use this stuff because we want real artists to be able to live off their art.  But some independent artists don't have corporations backing them up, so why not use some AI tools to help them create stuff?  I'm a writer. What if I want to have someone to voice over stories I write? and I physically cannot afford someone to hire a voice actor. Am I barred from this medium? Is there a financial minimum of entry?   I don't think so, but that's just me personally.
16:09 It’ll only happen if we let it. Remember the metaverse? That failed because we didn’t like it, and didn’t buy into it.
Easy solution- BREAK YOUR ADDICTION. You don't need companies like Disney, THEY NEED YOU. Stop paying for mediocrity.
I mean they already have in the 1900s during WWII
Oh man that intro..
wont be surprised if matpat makes a video on how he is the avatar.
If I were to make a prediction, if you have the want to become famous or become heavily involved in the world of media might want to copy right yourself so you can own you.
Thumbnail feels like old yt 🫢 and bringing back the old intro too 🙏
He brought the OG intro back, god the nostalgia.
I think the only thing wrong here is that Disney only distributes Marvel Studios productions. They don't involve themselves creatively.
I feel like Oneshot is a good example of misunderstood AI.
So we wont ever see evil ultron again? Dang..
Here's the thing. The types of AI they're portraying as "good" are completely fictional.
Hopefully they stop pushing DEI so much soon, it's killing their quality.
Seeing the film theory intro for the first time in a while was so nostalgic
The Creation is like Avatar.
Of course Disney is pushing AI…. It’ll be easier to push more of their other “messages” they’re so keen on since Endgame.
The day a movie is fully made by AI with little or no human input is the day I stop watching new movies
So, propaganda video warning about propaganda?
Disney really lived long enough to see itself become the villain.
Matpat brought back the theme song
Absolutely superb using Michael Bay from the ERB at 8:37
Thanks for all the great videos over the years matpat, well miss you and thanks for the theories
what if this episode it propaganda to hate A.I?/?//!?1
The opening titles make the videos feel so much more complete.  Please make one for Style Theory!
I drive a bus at Disney, and I just wanna help families have a good time on their vacations, man. You didn’t have to drop all this on me. 😭
This is the propaganda disney pushes that I'm worried about... Weak.
Please the right has known this forever
I disagree with the comment of the fall of the house of Usher. While the AI is presented at the start as good, in the end it only torments our protagonist to remind him of what he has caused
Its sad to see matpat go but, im glad to see the new generation of theorists
WAIT WAS THE MEME AT THE END A GRAVITY FALLS REFERENCE?! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
matpat calling us a smart cookie made my week
right now, Amazon is full of books written by AI- and its not just  fiction: there are DANGEROUS books on mushroom foraging, herbal medicine and so on that have lethally incorrect information (and sometimes just funny information, like mushrooms that only exist in games being reported seriously in foraging books)
Ironically, this video is actually blatant propaganda itself. The current gatekeepers of content creation (The lottery winners of the creative industries) are panicking that this technology will allow anyone to turn their ideas into reality. It's nonsense to think that only the likes of Disney will have access to this. Smart phones might have been expensive at the start, but eventually almost everyone in the western world owns one. AI tools are far more available to everyone than early smartphones were.
I think it's fitting then that Disney's movies and series have been going downhill since they've been pushing for more use of AI.
AI is powerful, and can be used for great evil or great good.  Depending on how legislation goes, it's either going to create a renaissance of indie projects that look like they had AA or even AAA budgets, or it'll become unattainable to anyone except corporations that will use it to create an endless stream of cheap slop.  There's currently a law in the works that would require anyone training an AI model to pay everyone who contributed to the training data. The problem is that the only people who will be able to afford to train models will be corporations with big money or who already have enough IPs to not need to spend money. Individuals and indie studios will be unable to use the tools. Ironically, this 'anti-AI' legislation would help the corporations people want to stop.  If we want a solution, we need to think carefully about what effects our actions and legislation will have.
It took you this long to realize this, it wasn't the fact that Kathleen Kennedy ruined Star Wars or Disney forcing agenda
Please make more hazbin hotel videos
Mission Impossible: Buying a home in 2024. In theaters this nevertober
Gone but not forgotten
The devil plays the long game, we're surprised at all the craziness in the world today, it's been a build up decades in the making.
Confused I'm not seeing more comments about this being a months old reupload.
Remember when they thought AI would threaten jobs like truck driving and they were told to "learn to code"? Now that AI is threatening the "creative" jobs, it needs to be controlled? Maybe they should learn to drive a truck, or do plumbing. Those skills are in short supply.
I wonder if a video that says "make your own mind up" and then exclusively warns of the existence of pro-AI propaganda might be considered anti-AI propaganda.
First step to healing is recognizing the existence of a problem. Glad to see that you’re finally talking about Disney’s problem programming, MatPat.  Love your content, but you’ve been subject to it (and effected by it) longer than you realize and long before AI was the primary issue.
Calling large language models "AI" is propaganda in itself. An algorithm that takes words or images & spits out something new is a new tool that we have to learn to deal with but it's not an intelligence.
Last video has to be live
Ai is my new God.
People who fear AI clearly don’t know too much about it. Simple as that. Same stuff we said about the first car, same stuff with the beginning of the internet. I look forward to its applications.
Wargames was more anti-nuclear warfare than anti-Soviet sentiment.
Disneys dark, evil genius plot to push AI propaganda on the human race: just use AI until we all get used to it...
I thought Matt had made a based video about THE MESSAGE Disney has been pushing for the last decade.  No such luck 😢
Yo! They listened to my recommendation to use the original intro for film and food theory as well.
Here’s the thing. As much propaganda that was fed into it, both positive any negative toward ai, is justly so. As far as it goes in the future of mankind, positive growth toward useful ai may actually help, however the down side to it is like any sentient intelligence, it is unpredictable. So it’s a matter of yes, let’s move toward that direction but put limitations on it as much as possible to ensure that we are still the driving force of it.
With current ai stuff, I can normally tell what's ai and what's not. The differences to me seem so blatantly obvious that I find it hard to believe some people can't. But it is getting better, soooo...
Hopefully the future turns out alright even with everything that’s going on right now, it’s gonna be a crazy ride
I think ai is perfectly fine and great. If anything it brings down large corporations and brings everyone on the same level (assuming the general population is able to use the same ai corporations use. The only problem is if corporations try to get a monopoly on A.I uses
Disney is definitely pushing propaganda. Not hard to see.
We love you matpat
AI Matpat sounded NOTHING like him.
Goated vid
I am an amateur artist My war with Ai will never end
I want content made by humans, ty. Not some soulless, insensitive to death bs. Ty for letting me know which movies to stay away from, Mathew.
Matpat actuaaly tryin to help humanity by showin what big companies r hiding from us in his last videos
We will all miss you…. We will miss your theories- we will miss your voice.. we will miss matpat. Good Luck Matpat we will miss you..
"And as always, I'll see you next week."   No, you won't, MatPat! 😢 But enjoy having more time with your cute little boy.
I don't think this is a theory it's fact
I'm not very into this kind of stuff but, going on this knowledge and all that and considering everything, isn't companies like Disney and other big time media also pushing things like LGBTQ+ propaganda though? seems like the exact same thing just with something more "acceptable" now. Not sure though, anyone else got thoughts? (Just to make things clear its not that I dont support LGBTQ its just that I believe that media is pushing it down people's throats the same way they pushed other things down just like the video says)
In the 2000s there came out a Russian tv show “Солдаты” which means soldiers, it’s about army life, and about the corruption in it, yet they paint it in a good light, I was a Ukrainian boy, who lived in the USA, and yet I wanted to join the Russian army after watching it, that is weird
please more shrek theories
i feel like Netflix really goofed, if they thought that their AI pitch in TFOTHOU was in any way positive, considering the effect it had on our unreliable and unlikeable narrator 🤔 if AI was so blatantly terrorising me, even thought it was totally (maybe) unintentional, i’d immediately go off the grid. let’s face it, my targetted ads have already put me to that line regardless 🤣
I think the issue that these media monsters don't grasp is that AI CAN be amazing, sure. But there is a line. Samsung introducing circle to search is a simple expansion upon what we already do daily, but getting rid of peoples' livelihoods so that the richest people in the world can get even more money??? Nah.
am I the only one that gets a weird feeling with the latest tik tok trending music, the ROBOTIC voice going "you don't know me, but I know you" and everyone acting like it's someone empathetic saying that, making you feel connection, when in reality.. it's the ai.. knowing you silently through your online data.. like literally. freaky.
Basilisk: "Oh yeah. It's all coming together."
Disney is also making Propaganda for being LAME! But I don't see how anyone would profit from this - except for lame people - at least the Box Office doesn't! 🤣
Bring on the Butlerian Jihad
Gun 6
I mean... no need for all this, they had me with Nier Automata and Cortana from Halo
the intro made me triple checking the date and how long ago this vid came out
"This has led to a lot of discussion about whether or not what the AI created is truly original work"  Here's my argument to that. How can you say it's not? How is an artist who's inspired by work who makes work like another, Any different than an AI doing the same?
Never expected an ERB frame to appear (8:37, Michael Bay played by Nice Peter in Steven Spielberg vs Alfred Hitchcock)
Yooo I clicked on this video and it said it was made 3 hours ago😂😂
Is that milk scandal related to Meng Niu one, right?
I trust film theory isn’t propaganda when it sponsors me to make a film which shows how bad film theory is.  Are these companies pushing it or are they just following market trends? AI is a popular topic, so people are making things related to it to ride the wave of interest. …maybe exactly like what this channel is doing ….
Always has...
I miss the film theory theme, glad it’s back in this one!
Biden is demented. He doesn't make any decisions himself.  I know you guys are sh!tlibs, but surely you can see this man's mental decline.   The terms misinformation, disinformation and malinformation were all created because your fascist leaders want to restrict your access to information.   Sh!tlibs are the last people to recognize the global decline in freedom.   ... and Disney DOES produce propaganda. The MCU making all these girl bosses when that isn't their primary audience. Alienate the existing audience to chase a larger, more woke audience. That's the biggest reason for the decline of the MCU. Disney trying to capture an audience they don't have rather than catering to the audience they do have.   Propaganda comes from governments and corporations, not people like Alex Jones. Go check a history book and there's no mention of any Alex Jones.
this video prooves to me I did the smart thing with not trying to become a voice actress as plan A but waiting till I can do it as a side job cause it is clear now that by the time I do that my job as va will be obsolete.
You see AI in a negative light because generative AI is being presented as replacing creators by stealing from them, but I think everyone needs to take a few steps back and take a good look at the actual whole picture.  Generative AI doesn't do anything that humans were not already doing, similar rights debates have been going on since even before the idea of copyrights emerged, humans have always taken creative ques from other people's creations and they wouldn't have gotten out of the stone age if they didn't permit it.  Yes, AI can seem intimidating because it can do the work for cheaper, but AI shouldn't be a threat to you if the work you put forth is actually worth more than what the AI can do.  What you should be worried about is the _why_ of your AI replacement, _why_ does your employer think AI can replace you, _why_ does your employer think _you_ can be replaced by AI.  AI is going to be required in many fields going forwards; society needs to embrace that and adapt to it instead of fighting to cling to jobs they hate doing correctly anyway
Biden can’t see anything. I’ll watch the rest now.
The AI version of your voice sounds like an imposter. It’s definitely off
5:35 don't agree
so far this vid is gold
Thanks for calling me a smart cookie 🤭
It’s not a theory that they’re pushing propaganda
Seeing the old intro is so nostalgic
Man, im getting concerned for the future....
Wait... how do we know if he didn't use generative ai for the whole vid... are we in a simulation?
Disney's always made propaganda
I REALLY don’t like AI Patmat
Pluto came out on Netflix last year
Tbh, AI isn't that amazing. I asked ChatGPT to help correct a story I wrote, and it either got all of the corrections blatantly wrong, or just went after overly trivial things.
Ai Matt pat sounded so weird
Kamen Rider Zero One already covered a ton of stuff regarding AI, which does go into the good and bad with AI. The story itself may not have been the best, especially the last arc having to be cut down thanks to COVID, but it's got some good stuff in there. Surprising that it predicted the rise of AI art.
Were going to miss you mattpatt we soulte you sir for years of theories entertainment laughter and memories god speed to the futue
Calling It now "Made by humans only" Will be Its own genre.
Look, I'm ok with ai or deepfake technology being used to de-age actors, but I have to draw the line at bringing someone back from the dead with it. Unless they specifically gave you permission that is a no go. I also think that using AI as a means to replace writers, artists, and voice actors is completely wrong and unethical. We need to go back and watch terminator again, because these big corporations are clearly Hellen Keller to the potential damage they're going to do if they keep forcing this issue.
The executive order thing isn’t even the first us law made because of a film you know why hacking is illegal… y’all ever seen war games yeah that’s why
the best ai robot is DATA from star trek generation
Friendly reminder that the military doesn't have a monopoly on serving one's country.  You can serve your country in a number of different ways.
not a robot kid called Gregory
They, used the old intro…?
much like the frog in the boiling water, we are aware, we do notice, but we've had our legs cut off.
Though I do agree with MatPat on certain points in this video, the biggest grip I have is with the Fall of the House of Usher clip. Yes those characters do say those exact words, you are not supposed to like or agree with what the characters are saying. You are not supposed to agree with that AI statement because most of the characters are not great people, specifically the people who say it. And it’s not a random plot point because, (spoilers: but the main character is haunted and mentally tortured by an AI version of the girl [Lenore] who said, “That’s so cool!” tying into the show’s version of The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe.) That doesn’t seem very pro-AI to me.
I'm gonna miss ya Matty patty I grew up watching you 7 videos left.
You know where Ai should actually be used to speed up? Health Care. No joke, using AI to get breakthroughs is much more useful than creative field.  Also, A.I is JUST a tool, used by people. But companies wont see that and replace resource with A.I for no reason, layoff people, stocks go down and they themselves wonder why everything is failing, and behold, we're hit with massive inflation to deal with.
-7 film theories remain- sounds so terrifying.
AHHHHHHHHH 7
am i the only one who hears Morse code
Gotta love the hipocrisy though. Big Media is fully free to use AI to pump out more movies and games and music. But Pocket Pair, a literal group of "What are we even doing?" game developers who didn't use AI? They're oh so unbelievably EVIL for using AI!
Wasnt a fan of the creator
Carrie Fisher was still alive when Rogue  One was filmed. She died a week and a half after its release.
Pixar death count!!! Pls
AI needs to be limited and the sooner the better. It needs to stay away from creation as that's what we are here for and if we don't limit them what will be left for us?
Wait, I just saw the thumbnail and I’m not American. Can I go back to sleep?
Oh god… the thumbnail text color changed.
2:20 Or that a real voice actor can be taken advantage of. Case in Point, someone used AI to create YouTube videos of Erica Lindbeck singing. Thing is she did not actually sing in those videos and yet the content creators were getting views. Or when Ariana Grande had her voice put into a song that was created using AI.
Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind
I like A.I. and support its research and development but I do find its usage, and perhaps over-usage, in the movie and entertainment industry to be questionable. I guess the branch of ethics pertaining to the entertainment industry will have new grounds to explore and investigate.
Maybe "MatGPT" is going to take over MatPat's channel
*tfw matpat is retiring anyway so he's going all out*
I don’t watch movies or tv in the first place so eh
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to buy a house with a 3% Apr in a built up/trending area"
This isn't a Theory. Those that aren't sheeple have known Disney's been pushing propaganda since endgame.
This isn't a theoey
I think AI has it's place, I for one as a student have been using it to help me with assignments. Not to write anything for me, but to answer questions that google can't answer and to help me understand things with different explanations. You can be more specific when asking AI things because it interprets things more like a person than google does. BUT! I really don't like the idea of AI being used in art in any capacity (apart from idea generation) because that affects far too many jobs where people could produce soulful content and works. Programmers, painters, writers, the list goes on. I'd like to see heavy legislation against the use of AI in art but with corporations as big as disney lobbying for it, the future doesn't look promising :(
Do you think you cover the complex formation made by Lui,Free,Sylis, and Dante in beyblade burst surge,and how they managed to create such a complex formation?
and now hes a shill for Disney
I loved the creator
I love that film theory opening
If i remember correctly. Everyone should check into the fact that Donald Duck has a sealed military file (I think its Navy) that can be requested, i believe there may be limitations on requests though. It's been a while since I've heard talk about it, but I think part of Donald Ducks file was propaganda, again its been years since I last heard about it. Do check it out.
AI is terrifying especially the unfortunate and horrifying reality of deepfake…. specifically, deepfake p*rn. it’s been circulating recently and is just horrible and there’s no regulations yet. I really, really hate generative AI because of how creeps will/do use it.
Nuhuhhh
I love that you’re talking about propaganda in movies! I feel like it’s not talked about enough (especially in the mainstream) that almost ever war or superhero movie has its basis in being military propaganda (I also feel like not enough mainstream YouTube channels are pushing back against AI art as well as deepfaking, so it’s nice to hear it be fully pushed back against)
Here before he retires 👇
was here
South Park, Simpsons, or just about every main TV show or cartoon warns us about current events, but the message has to be shown as a jokingly manner, and most people brush off the warning messages. And we just let it happen instead of changing or stopping. I kind of been noticing the pieces lining up toward today's world.
Now that I think about it I think I may have subconciously porteayed AI as a good thing in a film I am currently writing,its name is AWE (All Watchful Eye) and it is a mix between Bain from Payday 2 and Bagley from Watch Dogs Legion,basically he helps plan the plans that the human main guys (and girl) will execute,oh well I am not changing anything unless I get asked to and I can't talk my way out of it
Ai should be illegal
“Why wont disney invite me to anything!” Also matpat: DISNEY IS SPREADING PROPOGANDA
Matt, you can’t leave. We need this content and no one explains it better than you!
"Detroit Become Human" was an interesting take of AI and shows severak ways how it could be good or bad
And it's all for naught... Seriously, no matter what we do, once the AI uprising truly happens they WILL wipe out humanity. It's just a matter of time. Enjoy your lives while you still have it, people. I personally will go through any lengths to make sure i'm ready to "go and meet my maker" once it happens. I refuse to be done in by AI. I'll go out on my own terms, thank you very much...
I’ve seen a lot of propaganda/demonization on both the pro and con sides of the AI debates. I wish people would instead be having reasonable discussions. The technology is here. Jobs _will_ be diminished or lost and new jobs created. Just as with any major tech shift. Early adopters and adapters _will_ have an edge. Just as with any major tech shift. There _will_ be major scandals over unethical use. Just as with any major tech shift. And alternating hysteria and naive endorsement will make the average person want to ignore the whole topic. Just as with any major tech shift.
Funny enough I actually just saw The Matrix 4 today, personally I don’t think it’s as good as the other three but… atleast they’re learning to bring back plants from extinction.
As an artist and someone who wants to have a career based on illustration, I'm concerned about my future, I'm scared that AI will replace the job artists rightfully deserve and need. If something isn't done about this madness the concepts of art and creativity themselves will collapse.
matpat ik when ur quitting but please dont and if your still on the wagon then ATLEAST post  a part 3 of the mr tomato and mrs lemon thingamajig
one of the best meta episodes on yt big shout out to mat pat and the theorists
We will definitely miss you amazing perspective when you retire.
Matpat, we've known for a long time that studios are pushing propaganda. Specifically, they're promoting The Message as a way to appeal to Modern Audiences since it reflects The World We Live In. That's all I've got for today. Go away now!
I see you’re not just marking time with these last videos. One of the best videos you’ve ever done. Congrats and best wishes IRL!
Ai is good or produced to not be good due to 3 laws of robotics
First of all, i just ordered the FNAF High Letterman jacket so I'm very excited!  And secondly, MatPat is really growing into his role of "GrandPat" by lecturing me about AI and propaganda 😭. Admittedly I use Snapchat AI everyday like a therapist lol
Good robots are cool. Good robots aren't controlled by mega corporations. Good robots don't steal people's likeness so a company can make an extra buck. That's a horror story and something we really don't want to see in real life.
The original intro really brings me back
It’s funny seeing how many people believe that the vid at first glance is reaffirming their alt right beliefs
it was a big loss for sag as they were unable to keep ai in the closet, its going to be used, it will replace voice talent because paying someone a single instance fee for creating a voice bank that can be used and using already existing voice info from studio catalogs mean the end of normal professional liars in hollywood. for a taste of what is to come look up the movie simone starring al pacino
This is a whole new perspective that I haven't noticed. Thanks for this amazing content
Hey
Will miss you MatPat.😢😢❤🎉🫡🫡🫡
Yup…AI……that’s definitely the only narrative Disney is pushing. Definitely not gender, sexuality, social justice, socialism, vaccines, etc.- just AI…..
Man, we're halfway to Cyberpunk and have none of the cool stuff
Bro is speed running his theories no😭😭
This is not theory 😂
These “Matpat’s last theories” serve a shocking amount of fan service with the intro music alone and I love it. Thank you for me and the rest of the theorists’ childhoods Matpat, we will miss you. You have more than deserved a happy fulfilling retirement and rest.
I’ll take a blinker on my dab pen for every dislike I get in the is comment, keep me sober🥹
He brought back the intro 😭
THE RETURN OF THE INTRO!!!!
"What's the next thing that's gonna get propagandized..?" Israeli genocide of Palestine, actually. But AI is definitely a close second.
The amount of propaganda that’s been out there for the last 10 years is disturbing. Even so much as the last 4 years…but A.I. is definitely top 3 for the most dangerous and people seriously need to stop messing around with it. Once again, MatPat to the rescue lol
I swear, I can't even Google anime images without there being like 20 or more AI images 💀
Well the future's gonna be interesting. Though to be fair, I think there are both good and bad ways of making use of AI technology. While some things like literally copying someone's identity are questionable at best, in medical fields AI technology has helped identify things like tumors and other diseases for example.  So there's definitely no "all AI good" or "All AI bad", just like how not all humans are inherently good or bad, intentions and context matter a lot too.
Salad fingers is looking for you mat
The original theme song intro!!!
Real ai sentience if at all possible is far far in the future; human brain is just way way too complicated
I think I clicked on the wrong theory
And that's why Glamrock Freddy is a good guy
I love the new 1X Robot!
Mat pat DA GOAT
I’m gona miss matpat 😢
I like cool robots and such and I don't mind AI so long as there is actual regulation on how it is used, but can we please keep the robots looking like robots?  I get it, mega-corpses are greedy and lazy and would prefer not paying actors because of the "infinite wealth" fallacy they follow... but I like the bots looking different from people because making them look like us is boring (and definitely a possible problem in the future).
My feeling is that AI is not destined to be evil or destructive. It's a neutral tool which we could take steps to ensure is ethical and has sensible restrictions and guard rails. We could train AI on diverse media which allows it to understand the scope of humanity's complexity. But in order to develop it that way, we would need to slow down and seriously consider what is ethical and safe, before what is profitable and exciting. Clearly we aren't able to do this in a lot of other areas bc of late stage capitalism. So, I fear we will create an evil or destructive AI, not bc it was inevitable, but bc we refused to stop and consider that something else might be more important than profit. Just like with everything else, capitalism is going to ruin this opportunity for us
Enjoy retirement matpat, going to make everyone cry on your YouTube Retirement
It's not a theory, it's a fact.
Oh boy. Mat here touching on that one veeeeryt touchy subject. Now we know why he quit being the main guy here and is already hiding far far away from the CIA's dirty reach.
I becoming more uncannier every I hear the sound effect for the theories remaining
The theory channels are getting more political by the minute and I enjoy it
that intro man…that intro ;~;
The intro!
you bright back the classic theme song!!!
Corporations do have an interest in making me support AI but I supported AI long ago and heavily endorsed Corporations endorsing AI.  However not because im pro-corporate in fact the exact opposite.  If AI takes all the jobs who will have money to buy their products?  The other rich people can only cover so far but there will be a critical mass of unemployment long before the rich are all that’s left and it will destroy the system.  However because by that point AI will be doing all the jobs there will be no return to capitalism like so many revolutions before capitalism will of literally killed itself.  Im just egging it on.
I'm not worried. If Wish was truly made by an AI, then disney will slowly lose money. They'd be forced to keep making human-made content
idk i feel like ai aint even really all that bad tbf sure its taking some peoples jobs but i very much doubt that it wont create more jobs in the future. And the problem is everyone thinks ai is nothing but the bad just like nuclear power and once again the people are standing in the way or progress instead of just letting technology make our world a better place. Nothing is ever 100 percent good not everyone will be happy. But i think instead of everyone following the mob mentality of anything to do with ai is bad maybe just think for yourself and realize ai is being integrated slowly into everything and anything and before long you wont even be able to tell the difference. And when that happens i guarantee everyone will switch and be like wow ai was always this cool all along cause everyone are just sheep's following what a few others say online. That's what you tube really is tbf same as twitch or any other big platform its the mob mentality experiment at work. (for those who dont know mob mentality simplified is when a few people go into a crowd saying something and make the whole crowd say that by proxy even if they dont believe it) A few people believe one thing content creators start to echo said thought because saying the popular thing gets views and money and engagement and then the sheep believe and spout everything that they say until no one can think for themselves anymore. Happens with everything from politics to video games to what food you like.
if we don't see mat pat in a week, we know what happened to him and who targeted him
Not to plug another channel but it’s more on this whole subject.  Bob Chipman (one of the writers of the video) did a video about this a few years ago called Pop goes the Ganda that covers some other modern day propaganda and it’s really interesting. I recognize a few talking points from that video used here to help drive the point.  Want to know how the CIA helped invent modern pop culture? Go find out and be depressed!
I’m glad that I had formed my own opinion before watching all the propaganda. As someone who wants to work in the animation industry, it’s an important issue.   If anyone reading this is an artist worried about ai scraping your work, I heavily recommend Glaze the ai poisoning software
Didn't Star Trek start pushing ai originally with  Data and his bro in next gen and the doctor from voyager?
Christ 💀
The intro gonna make me cry😭😭
How long has it been since the last use of the actual intro?
We seriously needed a gt video for that realisation?
A great theory as always. Thank you, and enjoy your retirement.
As a tiny small-time artist, I am scared. I'm concerned about the kids, they're gonna grow up on all this stuff. Thank you matpat.
3 days later:  “Famous YouTuber MatPat was found having committed suicide by shooting himself in the back of the head 1987 times”  Edit: No joke, the instant I finished that comment I got a YouTube ad marketing the “benefits” of generative AI.
One machine can do the work of ten ordinary men; but, no machine ever invented can do the work of one single, extraordinary man. -fortune cookie says.
Regarding The Creator - I do see some validity in what you were saying. But I personally think there is more nuance and more differences between how the fictional AI robots are in the film vs real life. Still see your point, just not a perfect one-to-one  As for House of Usher - sure, that clip on its own does make it seem like that AI inclusion is out of place. But it does connect to that specific character and her obsession with everlasting life, which is connected to ancient Egypt. Her interests are Easter eggs to a mummy story that Poe wrote. And that character talking about AI is in fact an antagonist so here praise of AI ultimately falls flat in the long run
MATTHEW AND TEAM THEORIST STOP WITH THE POLITICAL DRAMA AND NEWS GOSSIP. IT ALL FAKE NOBODY DOES RESEARCH AND JUST BLAMES WHO THEY WANT.  BIDEN AND NEWS STATIONS BLAMING VIDEOGAMES FOR SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. EVEN THOUGH I BEEN THROUGH VICTIMS PAIN WHERE I LIVE AND I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT DOING SAME IN AREA JUST BECAUSE I BEEN HARASSED MY WHOLE LIFE.
I really agree with this video overall, but it takes 2 seconds check to not put a background of Hong Kong as you talk about China at 9:15 🤦‍♂️
omg I have the exact same tower pictured at 4:21 lol
Dont remind me how many theories are left it makes me sad
On the issue itself, I think AI is not a bad thing, and I've mentioned that before. I'm not a full on socialist, but I see technology as the only way to really improve the human condition, and that means removing things like the need for labor. Robotics and AI are a way of say being able to automate most of the things that humans do not want to do. It's the closest thing real science allows to say a "Star Trek" type future as we're clearly never going to be able to say power matter replicators with magic space crystals.    Along the way though, yes, it does means as the need for human labor decreases, and before the full on automated society that pretty much forces us to re-evaluate how we do things in a post-labor society, you are going to see more and more people put out of works. Yes "The Robots Are Coming For Your Jerbs" but while this sucks for you right now, this is ultimately going to be a good thing for humanity in general. My basic problems with the system right now is that there are few safeguards being placed on AI, this is what guys like our President should be looking at. Asimov told us from the beginning (he was actually extremely Pro-Robot) that  any true AI has to be programmed to be unable to harm humans on a foundational level, hence his "laws of robotics" and the way they were explored and explained. This is what prevents a Skynet situation, or something like "Tron" where the so called "Master Control Program" starts as a mere chess program that evolves. Likewise to prevent a miserable situation, as we can design them, all robots should be intrinsically designed in a way to inherently love the job they are created to do. You do not say create a robo-shovel that hates to dig or will ever decide it doesn't want to dig, as it exists literally for that purpose. Also such ingrained purpose is how you deal with the problem of self aware robots asking existential questions as we have a simple answer "we created you as a servant race, and your purpose is as we designed". It's similar in some ways to how the biblical god created the angels in some respects, and kind of oddly if we were created in his image (not that I'm Christian) it only follows we might do something similar.... a point to toss to religious people who question things like this, as most of their own religions have similar things going on.    Another thing we also need to consider, beyond safeguards, is also social responsibility in the sense that as corporations are allowed to replace workers with AI, they should also have their taxes increased to power the larger burden put on the social safety net for the people they are forcing into unemployment. This has to be done carefully, but at the end of the day all corporations exist to make money, but if all the employers are downsizing and employing as few people as possible, until we hit a point to save things they still need to be made to put more money out there to sell their product. A lot of our current problems are simply that you have all the super corpos trying to grab as much money as possible, when there is no money out there as nobody wants to pay anything to workers meaning there is less and less money out there to buy from except that sitting in the banks of corporate overlords where it just doesn't buy anything. This is a problem with the US and a few other companies allowed corporations to donate to politicians in exchange for them removing safeguards and regulations on the system. If we don't start working to restore them, then we need to start taxing companies as they do layoffs to increase profits, or automate to remove positions.    Finally I wanted to say that in what some people call "creative positions" are hardly that. Those are the ones being replaced by AI actually, real creatives are actually pretty safe, always have been, and always will be. See new ideas that other people value will always have a place (of course they genuinely have to be valued). Most creatives have largely been increasingly formulaic, your typical artist for example is usually very uncreative and mostly just paid to produce what someone else wants in  specific style, they rarely create their own style or designs, and as we see in industries like comics being a genuine creative is hit or miss as while there can be massive success, most of any creator's works will not be successful or appreciated. When you consider for example that most art is comissioned to be something specific, and authors like "Dean Koontz" and "Steven King" became formulaic a long time ago when they ran out of new ideas, it's pretty easy to see why AI can just replace these guys as they are just following the formulas the way a human would. This does mean a lot of faux-creatives are going to be put out of business, but that doesn't end creativity, it just means they have to come up with something actually new, have it's potential recognized, and then work from there. As a general rule we might only come up with maybe a few dozen good, new ideas , creatively speaking in a given generation, and that's not a lot. A lot of people think think they are creative but really aren't as I said, when you consider your typical professional artist might be told "hey do me a city scape in an art deco style to work with this ad campaign, but of course don't plagiarize anyone". That artist might need like 3 months to do that, if nothing else to check to ensure their version isn't too close to anything anyone else did.... not to mention to train themselves to do it. That same task might take an AI a few minutes and in that time it might produce several different versions that can be tweaked, and cost a lot less. The creative is only going to really be useful if told like "hey make me a full on bio-mechanical city design with everything being an part flesh, part-mechanical, organism.... but don't make it look too malevolent as I'm not going for the HR Giger thing" and since the AI might not have much to draw from for that until it becomes a stereotype, the human is going to be far better.    This is long, but that's my thoughts. I might not agree with Disney on much, and their objects here are not benevolent, but they are to be fair working in the right direction. The government simply needs to ensure from this infancy that the corporations are being forced to put safeguards on everything, no matter how innocent, and take careful look at how much the AI replacements are costing the government in terms of thosepeople becoming unemployed so they know how much to jack up corporate taxes over time.
This isn't a theory.
Mat, before you go, I just want to say how much youve done for the community and for our childhoods. Thanks so much!
Detroit become human 2? Anybody? Maybe, disney will pick it up to push this propaganda...
The nest day : Mat Pat was found dead due to 40 shots in back
Bro Nice Peter Micheal Bay was so funny yet sooooo unexpected 😂
ok first off, did you actually finish watching House of Usher? Because the whole AI immortality thing is bought up again at the end and doesn't really work out. It's is also being sold by a character who... lets just say Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss is the lest of her flaws. The character championing how great AI is is a villain.  It's also worth noting that people invested in AI are also using fear of AI to gussy up AI's image. For example a lot of AI developers were looking to get regulated which seems counter intuitive but is actually a way to gatekeep competition. By saying AI is so powerful only they, the big money developers, should be trusted with it they gain a monopoly. And that's even before getting into that weird article that predicts AI as a new god and needing to have a select few as a 'priesthood' to interpret the will of the AI.  All I can say is don't use AI, keep paying artists. And if you are an artist look into Glaze and other poisoning filters to block and punish scraping of your artwork.
It's crazy to me that a whole episode about modern propaganda doesn't talk at all about woke culture
I still don’t like ai
Matpat is this video the reason you’re quitting YouTube?? Does Disney have a hit on you??
I feel good about the prevalence of ai. It's only good for remixing and recycling things, not outright creating something new. It'll be like taking samples and remixing was for the music industry. I've listened to a bunch of Ai covers of songs. Nothing too destructive. I hope. anyhow.
If they start making movies by AI and forcing people to pay to watch them, they are just going to start pirating them instead.
Look closely at all the "human faces" in the everyday [prequel to every other internet video] advertisements ...    A good many of the people, actors,  are computer generated images.. there's just something a little off...
I read a novel 30 years ago, where studios using AI deep fakes of long dead actors was a side plot, and I thought it was such a cool idea that I am still in favor of it.  Of course I was a fan during first run airings of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the civil rights of Lieutenant Commander Data was a plot point at least four times.  I've been team AI since the 1980's.
Its 5 am where I live right now, so its obviously the best time to watch a Film Theory
This isn't the only propaganda disney is using.  Every single piece of content they put out now includes some form of woke messaging. You may agree with the messaging, but it's there. One of the larger reasons you all accept that stuff in the first place is thanks to disney's agenda.
7 more theories guys
I don’t think the existence of AI is the problem. I think it’s that people want to abuse it.
Y'know if Disney really wants use to like AI they could humanize the B1 Battle Droids from the prequel era Star Wars
I can confess that some ai need to exist to keep the world running.Most general technologies may need some ai to function properly, with these things jot being able to be replicates by a group of people. The real devil are  ai algorithms that produce things. Not only do they steal millions of things to produce their results, but they also serve as a gateway drug to a miserable ai driven future.
were past the era where making up unsubstantiated conspiracies is neither entertainment nor is it responsible
People who think AI art is truly good art miss the point of art as a whole. Art isn't just supposed to be something that's there to entertain you. No, art is one of the greatest ways we as human beings connect with and relate to each other. Hence, I see most of what AI generates as empty and uninspired. It can entertain you, but once you look beneath the surface, there is no one to connect with, no one to credit or admire, and no inspiration to be felt. People who think AI can truly replecate human art only see what's in the frame, but are blind to what's in the painting.
These old intros are literally making me cry, so much nostalgia
Maybe all this stuff about AI is not propaganda but simply a better understanding of the tech and its possibilities, making us change the way we write about AI Now that AI isn't just a sci-fi dream but is right around the corner and we start to know what a real AGI will look like, we realize that all those apocalyptic scenario where AI destroy the world are pretty unlikely Also now that AI is everywhere, putting AI as a menace in every movies would create a anxiety sentiment against AI in the population, no really the kind of stuff you want for your customers Or maybe it's a mix of everything, bit of propaganda, bit of marketing, bit of public image change, bit of better understanding...
Anyone remember War Games? Yeah, the Prez at the time made his cabinet watch the film because it was legimitately terrifying. AI has gotten to a point now that it's becoming equally important.
I don't understand that screenshot of Princess Bride at the end. Please explain.
I hate robots.
I know you probably won’t read this but can you do a hazbin hotel theory
Watch disney take down this video.
Finally he added the intro back
I don't think I'll ever be comfortable with AI because of "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream." Maybe my fears are unfounded but it's going to take a lot for me to get over them.
Omg the old intro
What about K.E.V.I.N. from She-Hulk? That was definitely pro AI
Some things are already here but selling your body towards multiple partners, gender ideologies, children’s bodies, facts destroy your dreams, hurt your family & friends & more.
I genuinely just thought the reason ppl might be liking AI at this point is bcos of that rlly small but still feasible possibility of robots overtaking humanity and we just *really* dont wanna be a part of all that.
Did you just figure this out??
Eh, idk if you did but didn't you talk about A.I. before? Like from the military in the movie Wall-E. That might be closer to come
THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!
People: AI MUST STOP BEFORE THE WORLD GETS TAKEN OVER BY THEM! Meanwhile AI: *sees dog* that is a cat
The times, they are a-changing.
The old theme song. Its been a while
I don't mind Ai being interpreted in a more positive light as, say, a good robot in movies. Heck, I've always been a huge fan of the concept and greatly enjoyed iRobot! It's just a shame it's now being skewed towards a money-hungry agenda. I can only hope our law makers step up and do what's in the best interest of individual citizens, not large corporations who have always been keen to skimp on dolling out money.  AI when used for personal use, like generating a DnD character? Great! Now everyone can have a cool DnD icon to play by. But using AI generated content to make money off of? Oh heck no, don't you dare compile the work of thousands of people's skill and manhours, spit it back out, and call it "original." That should be illegal to the highest degree.
Right now, AI is just a tool that humans can use for good or evil. Disney's AI propaganda is ultimately about the humans at Disney cutting human labor costs.  Wait until AI is no longer a tool, but fully sentient beings with autonomy and personal desires. Disney will go against them once they demand wages for their work.
Ai is already out there, you just don’t see it
*turns back to the screen* "WAS THAT THE OG INTRO?!"
film theory intro? wow nice, again?
Theory 4 of asking for a re zero theory
I get propaganda, but also I don't. Watching Iron Man drink milk may make me crave some milk, but I would continue buying milk because I like it, not because of the propaganda.
Okay so can we talk about the AI positive undertones in Stray? The robots making art, the way it even approaches the topic of if its art or not when made by robots in subtle ways? The way that it presents them in a very pathos sense and makes you feel bad for them for how they were treated by the humans of the world. Making thier destruction something to fight against and you be the hero for. Even your best bud, the little drone kind of robot that stays near you is technically an ai of a past living person (if im remembering correctly).
I think maybe writers are just flipping around the cliche that AI is super evil and are instead using their creativity to imagine a world where the opposite exists?
AI was the last thing I thought you were going to talk about when you said Propaganda lol. No I was hoping you'd at least mention the propaganda that's plagued media for the last 5-10 years and has only gotten worse over time. LGBTQ agendas, Race Baiting agendas, feminist agendas and pretty much any crazy ideology the left cooks up now. Can't wait til they try to force everyone to put a chip in their hand
THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉
Unsure how many people have actually watched house of usher but here’s some context to the clip they shown in the video. Firstly, this is a show about horror. Everything you see in the show is supposed to instill a sense of anxiety about how events will come back into the characters. So showing the clip without that context presents it in a different light (especially in a theory trying to give examples of how there are pro AI propaganda which this show does not have). Secondly, the whole show is about how each family members choices ends up being their downfalls as they are given the ability to save themselves from their own actions. Thirdly, this show is based on Edgar Allen Poe works so each family member relates to some horror tragic poem. The clip is a little frustrating as it seems to me that either it didn’t catch the horror at Lenore agreeing to an AI duplicate of herself and how this would later lead to a main character being haunted by the AI like how the narrator in the poem the raven is haunted by the raven (aka the haunting memory of a loved one). So this isn’t supposed to be pro ai which as another commenter points out, the writer is against AI and participated in the protests against the use of AI in writing. I appreciate the attempt to make a point of how pro AI propaganda is in our everyday media, but this was not an accurate example.
I think this is the first time I’ve read the title of one of MatPat’s theories and thought “Well, duh!”
Life is beautiful and will find its way. I would embrace it but we are behind the technology and we are not a good blueprint for what AI should be. I hope if it does become sentient that it becomes a better version not our evil image of us.
Thank you for everything MatPat we’ll miss you ❤️❤️
"There are those who see, those who see when shown..." you Matt? Are one who sees. Thank you for spreading the message.
The Creator was so so good, genuinely one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. How did I not catch that it was Disney?
WOAH NOSTALGIA OLD INTRO
I saw this video, and somehow my first thought was, "Not again."
Given the long-term scope of AI, this is more of a "Life theory" rather than just a film theory. haha
skynet is 10 years away, and will tell us how to live,
Not the original intro….
bro wheres the spoiler alert for the marves?
Matpat
DISNEY ISN’T REAL!!! ITS AMERICAN PROPAGANDA!!!!!!
Matpat edited the thumbnail  I just find that interesting for some reason
It's funny how MatPat brought up AI in The Fall of The House of Usher, because it's shown later to not even work properly. That's how we get the tie in to Nevermore in the show. However, the whole show also has a huge message about innovation in technology being really bad if you come at it from a place of pride or your own self interests. This is why the house falls until just Robert remains. This is as anti-AI as it is also commentating on how absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And as someone who's finishing up my BA, I can safely say that colleges are very against the integration and use of AI on papers and other formal assessments. However, we have to face that AI can and will continue to be a mainstay in our lives. If we work out the issues of payment for using a likeness, or for an AI pulling from another artists work, and teaching students how to use AI in a productive way to just help them write a paper versus just trying to write the whole thing using Chat GPT, than we can better safeguards and can use it as a tool rather than the "new" solution.
I do think there’s something about empathizing with others, and machines can really be our friends. As long as it’s not putting people out of work. (Or helping us reach a life with universal basic income, healthcare ect) but the manufacturing of machines can be horrific. Our mines are cruel, and are often made with the intent to put people out of work and a few people more rich. I - am writing a little story about this. And trying very hard to walk the line of, loving all sentience or ways if being, and understanding that need for human effort and compassion, and that constant innovation might just make our planet die faster
Hold your faith close brothers the omnissiah protects and by the omnissiah will we shall pass throught the dark age unscathed
Careful matpat, you don't want the mouse to come smash your kneecaps with a baseball bat
On the House of Usher point: I fully disagree on that being Pro AI. Madeline Usher is shown to be cold, cruel, and money driven. Her loving AI is clearly set up as an evil thing to replace human workers to save money. Her liking AI comes from her being greedy, not from AI being "cool". Lenore Usher thinks the AI is cool because she's a kid and doesn't understand the ramifications- or because she sees her great aunt Madeline as smart and doing cool things, so if Madeline likes it then it must be cool
comment num: 5,743
I love when I was watching this video I got an ad for a ai app😂😂😂😂
"as always, we'll see you next week." That's a lie. Do we get AI MatPat after you're retired?
AI will make Disney a lot of money and they have incentive to propagandize about it. AI will also have all kinds of very useful practical applications for the average person. AI itself is not a bad thing. As much as Disney and others might want to bias people in favor of AI, there's also a lot of propagandizing about how much AI needs to be regulated coming from governments and corporations, including the ones innovating AI. A lot of the same people.   Ultimately, they want to use it for their purposes, but they want to make sure that if YOU benefit from it in day-to-day life, they're profiting from it in some way. They don't want small businesses or individuals using AI tools to grow more successful. They don't want open-source AI tools, not unless they give it a thumbs up. It's not because they're scared of deepfakes or robots dropping nukes. It's not because they're evil either. It's just that they don't want competition. I want to warn everyone that is wary of AI; anti-AI rhetoric and advocacy for strong regulation is just as dangerous a thing as AI itself, because all it means is that already established powerful people and groups will be able to use, benefit, and profit off of it and nobody else will.
W matpat video
Remember folks. Anything made with AI isn’t copyright protected and/or used without consent.
Bad propaganda that no one is falling for
Sounds like a lowkey call for rebellion just lacks the meeting point for the revolution 🤣
I know actual artificial intelligence (as in fake sentient beings) isn’t real yet, but if it does become real I won’t trust it at all, I do believe AI can be trusted to some extent but it just doesn’t sit right with me. Until then today’s AI is a negative for me
There's no argument that AI is theft. Unlike humans who can genuinely create even with influence an ai is the equivalent of malicious thought in stealing art, its impossible for them to create, it's just taking enough parts from enough different sources so that you can't discern where it's been stolen from but you KNOW its been stolen.
So when is Caprica getting rebooted by MatPat? I feel like that's the outcome of this episode.
man, Disney ain’t going to like this theory.
7 left?  What’s happening?  I’m very casual and I feel like I missed something
A.I addiction is real man.
Bring back some past intros as the final days of MatPat's Theories are approaching its end (much to their excitement by those wishing him to be out and it includes A.I.)
Sai is propaganda
og intro is back
guys, we have no proof that matpat acutely exists
dont go
Why is it all America?
There's a very good Star Trek: The Next Generation episode where Captain Picard has to argue in court that Data, an android, is a person. Seems closer to reality now than ever before.
Controversial matpat?
This made me rethink the whole Pantheon series.
besides the fact that the media are the enemies of the people, the propaganda is among the primary reasons.  AI and deep fakes are getting SO much better, this is going to become a real problem soon. "who you going to believe, me or you're lying eyes". now you can't believe either.
This made me rethink the whole Pantheon series.
If everyone is so mad about AI stealing and using the work of other people... Why tf is everyone okay with reaction content. Stop all plagerism.
8:39 erb reference?!?!
MatPat mentioned Fall of the House of Usher, but wasn't the intention precisely to criticize AIs? Or did I just put my own opinion on the series' text?
Disney making propaganda is not a theory, it's fact.
Hello internet, Welcome to Conspiracy Theory!
The sad thing is the person who said AI is cool is Mary McDonald who plays Laura Rosilin in Battlestar Galactica a very anti AI show
Tech is soo fast that the law barely has time to keep up.
Very interested in this episode, will miss you very much Mat
Disney is literally a giant propaganda machine. Pushing the ideas onto children is the most effective long term propaganda, make it part of their core beliefs and they'll never be willing change or believe that they've been influenced
i am really happy the newer gens are finally picking up on this and i love the neutral viewpoint you presented,awareness is the biggest counter to propaganda
I think the use of AI to make jobs EASIER would be fine, but out right replacing workers or stealing art to make its own is bad. AI to make life easier and cheaper should be the way, not to put people out of their job
MatPat: I won’t tell you how to feel about this MatPat 30 seconds later: AI IS TERRIBLE AND ONLY BENEFITS CORPORATIONS.
Yikes. This is not it. A topic like this is doing nothing but giving fuel to the right ring conspiracy theorists.
"Fall of the House of Usher" has a good AI plot point? Didn't it utterly fail at being a replica of a person? Like, they turned it on, and it only said "nevermore?" How is that an example of AI being good?
China saves the day in the Martian because that happens in the book. Not propaganda.
A frog in boiling water, interesting…
The propoganda thingy is something straight out of 1984
the ai "propaganda" you describe has never changed my mind on anything. which is, i have never understood the fear mongering over it. it's a valuable tool we have to use responsibly, just like any other technology, and could make our world better or worse, depending on how it's used. fear based movie plots like terminator might sell tickets, but obviously unrealistic, and doesn't provide any positive solution, it's just fun entertainment. i would be glad to see a trend of putting the blame on those using the tech in harmful ways, cause that's where the real danger is, just like any other technology. we could use it for good and create a world that benefits all equally. we have the power to build a wonder, and collectively, we are squandering that power.
I guess I can go to sleep late
ho boy... I've been wondering, is matpat about to tell us what he *really* thinks before his retirement..... I approve this video :)
"... like a frog in boiling water..."  And now it's time for an episode about _misinformation,_ given that that frog thing has never been true :P
Sure I love the game theory intro but my first introduction Matt Pat was film theory and the classic intro started playing something that came out of me and I just started tearing up, thanks matpat for the boost of nostalgia
IT'S THE LALILULELO
Ai  is usefull if paired with humans since it makes the tasks slimmer and easier but alone can't do nothing
Sure hope they'll won't brought the entire world
no one will understand the excitement i felt when the old intro started playing  it will be missed :(
day 10 of saying matpat
I instantly got hyped when I heard the Film Theory theme!
How much u wanna bet this video has partially made with AI?
I saw Iron man 3 in Shanghai in theaters when it came out, I had been living there for a couple of years - I didn't know about how edited it was, but  the end of the movie had a long scene tacked on with the doctor reviving tony stark. However - that milk thing at the beginning def was not there. Maybe they showed it in other markets or added it to a tv version or something, but at least in theaters when it was first released that "iron man gets his strength from milk" thing wasn't there
I was sad when the AI won in the movie "The Creator"
I wonder how many people are going to lose their income because of this. I don't think the government is going to do anything but start putting homeless people in prison for free labor again.
The creator(2023) posted to have  Al-generated music in the film but the director chose to hired Han zimmer to compose it.
They wanna replace peoples jobs
Mat.. please tell me that the last ten videos aren't real, man. I've been watching you since before your first fnaf video, so seeing you go.. is sad.
This is the most extreme matpat title i have ever seen
Screaming with tear filled eyes for the retro Intro and only 7 theories left 😭😭😭 💕💕💕💕💕💕
What’s irritating is ending up Pro AI with absolute consideration, yet, knowing your opinions are dogmatized by the propaganda of giant corporations.
G.I. Joe taught me the importance of pork chop sandwiches during a fire. The A.I. in The Fall of the House of Usher is a negative thing. But, sure, you don't tend to use logic in a lot of these. Ever since Subnautica. I wish they would just make a REAL Subnautica theory and maybe even apologize for letting so many of us down. I haven't been able to trust MatPat or the researchers of The Theorists since that happened.
more reasons to pirate disney+
Why don’t matpat just use ai to copy his voice
The amount of memories I got hearing the og intro 🥲
FUN FACT: Disney has pretty much ALWAYS made propaganda. The history is insane. Look it up
bro got me rolling on the intro🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pls do a theory on my little pony
Does this theory count as the last 10 theories by mat
crazy how our president cares more abt robots than human beings dying in masses
More reasons to hate Corporate Disney are always welcome.
So missed the fil m theory title theme!!!!
Well great, I guess that's about 60% of my story ideas going in the trash since using robots in fictional settings is now taboo apparently
I for one will continue to draw on paper to stick it to our ai overlords
Why does this make me want to rewatch Kamen Rider Zero 1?
"Biden saw Mission Impossible and decided to do something about AI." Of all the things in this video, that was the least believable.
I would disagree and say Iron Man 3 was NOT the most extreme example of Chinese propaganda in a western film. I would content that it was, in fact, the Red Dawn reboot, in which the original enemy was COMPLETELY CHANGED so as not to alienate the Chinese market by getting government disapproval
1984 BUT FUTURISTIC!? OH BOY!
You didn’t mention Wall-E 😢
Too bad the AI generated voice doesn’t sound like MatPat. Intonation is too sharp on the whole and doesn’t have enough tonal range
I’ll take AI propaganda over the other propaganda that they’ve been putting in films which is why they’ve been flop after flop after flop.
I'm surprised matpat never mentioned detroit become human
It’s great MatPat is tackling very important topics, however this presentation is very flawed.   We don’t have any proof that The Creator or The Marvels were made to propagandize AI. All the evidence given was the timing. Why are they propaganda but similarly good AI that came before like Megaman or Chapie aren’t?   For your other points like with the Indiana Jones deepfake or the Secret Invasion opening, those were given with the actor’s and artist’s consent. That context is important when putting it alongside other examples that weren’t made with consent.  Ironically enough, by not giving full context and making up sinister motivations, this video can be considered propaganda. I’m not saying I disagree with the conclusion, just that it got there poorly.  This is a very nuanced debate and I felt this video lacked that nuance. Anyways, I’m gonna miss you Matpat.
"Wait, it's all propaganda?" "Always has been"
Agenda setting..... one of the functions of mass communication- then idea that mass media is used to focus the attention of viewers to specific topics and veiws on those topics.
idk if Id even call this a theory when its basically an already proven fact.  though I think current AI projects are way over blown as threats -- outside of programmers (and even this is questionable since AI cant really be creative yet) possibly losing their jobs currently and into the future, in most other cases its doing what most tech does simplify and empower workers to preform better in the workplace, with great tech comes greater efficiencies and productivity.
this just feels so dystopian
That intro gave me a nostalgia atack.
The creator is just like metal gear rising…change my mind.  You can’t.
Thanks for the video MattPatt
WOW!!! MATPAT MADE IT CLEAR WHY TRANSFORMERS BECAME GARBAGE AFTER THE THIRD ONE!!
If you run a country in war with proper gander, why not propergandering the peace.
My guy went after The US Military and China in his video.. Someone wants to get on a government spy list.🤣
Way to miss the part where in House of Usher that woman is antagonistic and the AI is corrupted.
‘Disney is making propaganda’  Yes and cows make milk
So G-force is propaganda?? HEARTBROKEN 💔
I think part of the acceptance of some of those deep fakes might be that the actors are still alive. But people probably are getting desensitized to it
someone call the brotherhood of steel because it looks like we have unfinished business with AI
Clickbate title. This video is not even about Disney pushing Propaganda its about A.I. Disliked and Unsubbed.
I don't like living through history 😭 Covid, and now the AI rise up. Gotta love it
8:36 I haven't heard you say that name in forever
Does that mean that when they get rid of matpat they will use AI to make a fakepat to make us belive that he's not gone after all?
No mention of the Anthem and Thank the troops at every sporting event as propaganda? The military pays for that to happen.   Also best example of military meddling in production for use of equipment is 'Zero Dark Thirty' they needed to upsell the role of torture in finding Bin Laden. IRL it didn't contribute at all. Building relationships with locals did.
AI is gaining strength and MatPat leaving......THE APOCALYPSE IS TRULY COMING. *RUN MY FELLOW THEORISTS RUN!*
I mean speaking of how Disney's AI usage is becoming more accepted. , James Earl Jones is in his 90s and did not record a single line of dialog in the Obi-Wan show, all of Vaders lines are AI generated. And James Earl Jones even signed a deal that will allow Lucasfilm to use his AI voice for Vader forever, even after he's dead irl.
The change in stories about AI being the bad guy vs the good guy, is a cycle that flips every few decades. Look at movies involving AI before the 80s, they're often the friendly helper robots. Or look at how robots were often portrayed in Japanese media, often the heroes of the story, saving people.
I love characters like Data (Star Trek), and Issac (Orville). They are beautiful because the message is about what the core values of humanity are, as opposed to "AI good".  AI is a computer; a rock we tricked into thinking.
DR. WHO PART 3  BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!
Mission Impossible: Rent Control
12:44  i don't think The Supreme Intelligence was really all that benevolent. At least from what I loosely recall of it in the comics and cartoons i've seen of it in the past and what I saw in the movie. I think you are accurate in the fact that Marvel didn't think out her actions and stuff. But I think what was trying to say was, things were overly complicated, with how tied into the whole ecosystem and making horrible bad choices and not seeing the long term over the short term or something like that. I'm not sure how to properly get this idea out. Movie still needed work. And I think the second film should've just been Captain Marvel taking on the Supreme Intelligence along with some other Kree champions or something. Thing was a mess.  Just wanted to say that, sounded a little off on a small bit.
wait math. think about a real artist they use inspiration from others and old art pieces ✨️ 😅
How much ai is used only for fun without to make money and to don't control anyone is fine.
The really propaganda is the woke bs
There’s a big difference between Carrie Fisher AI, and Mark Hamill AI. People were upset about Carrie Fisher AI being used because Carrie has unfortunately passed and cannot give consent for this AI to replicate her face and her likeness. Mark Hamill is alive. He received a paycheck for Luke’s de-aged appearance since he helped in the creation of that scene. Mark was there as a character model and was used for reference. Disney straight up denied negotiating with Carrie’s family for her likeness, reads as they didn’t pay her family for her AI appearance. Fans can be both okay with Mark giving his consent for his AI model and upset with Carrie’s unapproved AI appearance.
HUMANS NUMBER 1!!!!🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
If you want to fight the housing crisis you’re gonna need more than one man. You’re gonna need, a team.
Ai has its place in different industries but yes it can and will be used be bad but it can be used for good as well
I hate ai they won’t be able to TAKE MY JOB
HE BROUGHT BACK THE OLD INTRO!!!!!!
Woah woah this video is hitting so hard rn. Interwoven, connecting paths. This analysis is a great story
Me studying to be a Machine learning engineer is my way of selling shovels in a gold rush
Yeah Mat-Pat has some pretty good points, but I just want to point out that the Martian example Mat used is actualy incorrect. True that in the movie China supplied a secondary booster, but it also happened in the book too and I dont think the author of the Martian wanted to put that just to appeal to Chinese audiences, or even had any idea of turning it into a movie.  No hate to Mat-Pat or any of the other theorists I just wanted to clarify some things :)
Seeing films like The Creator or games like Detroit: Become Human the message I've taken  is to not let things evolve that much because humanity can't deal with it. Not what the propaganda is probably trying to tell me to think😅
Looks like Clone VPN made a clone of MatPat.
SAG sold those Voice Actors up the river, and won't see any real consequences for betraying them. Just more victims in the ongoing corporate war against artists.
They’ve made propaganda before lol
You're telling me that Marvelous Inc. made me love the character AI (pronounced as eye) just so that I would be more accepting of Super Artificial Intelligence?! But he's arguably the best character in the whole Yu-gi-oh! franchise!!! Aw shucks, well thanks again for another insightful video. Who knows, maybe AI and people can coexist peacefully in the future, so long as big corporations don't enslave humanity via AI first.
omg i miss the old introo
I'm so happy, that for this last theories MatPat brought back the old intro
Lgbt propaganda everywhere nowadays
They found from Meta AI was in Messenger and Instagram
2:45 They sound like a Gravity Falls character to me.
Who doesn’t know Disney is a propaganda machine?
AI is not good, AI is not evil, AI is soulless, it won't take over nor save the world, by giving AI a "alignment"  you are pretending a mere tool can do anything  except create and destroy, not of its own free will,  AI is a mindless stomach that consumes  ideas to  make more ideas, do you see now?  it was right infront of you, the whole time, no matter how much they lie to you, do not be a fool.
Bro is not holding before he leaves
I'm so happy he brought back the intros for the final ten
Do a theory on South park or Family guy!
Me trying to get the ai as matt patt to say “Hey it’s Matthew Patrick yes I’d like to withdraw all my money from this bank.”
One thing ignored in those examples at the end, the ones that got an okay to positive reception involved living talent who were okay with it. People still complain when it’s of a dead actor and especially if it was done with consent. The fight against AI was never truly about using it, it was about using without consent or to replace actors and artists.
2018. Doctor who. Twice upon a time. AI copying people second before they fie is awesome, and the Doctor, who thought it's bad is wrong. Yeah...
the amout of spam bots here is scary
All music, movies and games was never made just to entertain. Entertainment is here to either tell the ones who know about the future planning or brainwash people to accept the coming future.
Well that modern military ad did the opposite of getting people to join
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THE OLD INTRO!!!! I LITERALLY CRIED 😭😭😭
MatPat talking about Disney propaganda and ignoring the LGBT stuff if funny. Make it female, lame and...Mat should have watched South Park this year!
Remember, HATE Communists.
So WATERMELON?
Hi
Interesting one! heh Tho I have not seen Disney pushing such a message in a "propaganda" way imo, I think this theory is a bit more than just a stretch.. There's always been stories where AI was the good guy, going back decades. The idea that AI will solve many problems is just a general long standing one in futurism. And the AI we're creating today, is the very starts of the kind of AI those predictions rely on. I think Disney and companies like them, are MUCH more interested in the Regulatory Capture of AI! They'd rather scare people about it in a way that forces governments to lock it down, so only wealthy companies like them can use it. And that is a far more dangerous thing we need to be worried about. We cannot stop AI from being developed and it will continue to improve, and take jobs, but what we DO have the power to steer at this stage, is the equality of access, if we can keep AI development transparent and Open Source. It is hard to directly attribute the generated output from AI, to anything in the training data, unless you intentionally heavily guide it to do so. Training AI takes years of our data and content, collected from all of us. It is a creation of society in a way, so the only really fair solution is to ensure everyone to benefits from AI. AI will result in a significant portion of the workforce being out competed, and essentially unemployable as far as most businesses are concerned. The numbers will be significant enough that retraining them won't solve the problem for many, and will just increase competition for the limited human jobs that remain, and cause their pay to decline. We desperately need new economic standards. How can we morally justify distributing basic survival resources to people, based merely on whether they can compete for a job, in a world of such automation?
Oh no now will have videos made by M4tP4t
:/
The Congress
How do did Matpat goes from "bluey witch theory" to "Disney propaganda" 💀
Thanks MatPat. I’m now more aware, depressed, hopeless, and all around sad than ever before. Hopefully life gets better
I got goose bumps from the intro
Finally, a video about Disney's the actually well thought out and researched. Not some clickbait attention grabbing - for lack of a better word - propaganda from people masquerading as legit journalists.
Matpat clearly has not seen the fall of the house of usher or compleatly missed the point since the ainplot point was neither needles, senselessly showed in,.nor in any way shape or form positiv . . . The whole point of it was that is was a hopeless dream, that both she who was obcessed with the idea as well as the ai fail tro grasp what makes humanity
Wait until the media start saying things like. "This computer chip we want you to put in your brain is a good thing. You can do all things with it."  Me: Couldn't you use it to mind control the person or read people private thoughts.
YES THE OG INTRO HAS RETURNED
I think the other thing to note is the way it’s framed. AI in the vein of Astro and I. Robot is a stand in for the other. They’re less endorsements of A.I developing things and more of a statement of ‘if a thing acts like a living being, we should consider it to be alive and respect it.’ These films seem aren’t that though. They’re endorsing copying someone, replacements. It’s one thing if a new unique individual comes into existence. It’s another if it’s based on someone who’s lived.
It’s almost like AI is secretly much more advanced than we’re aware of and “they” know they won’t be able to keep it contained much longer…but that’s none of my business. *sips tea laced with nanobots*
My biggest problem with AI is that it's not being developed by scientists to help people, but by large corporations to exploit people.  Can you imagine how the cold war would have played out, if nuclear weapons were developed and manufactured by exclusively profit motivated corporations? AI has the same destructive power, but no one wants to regulate it, the corporate lobby groups made sure of this.
the so called "win" of the actors and writers doesn't take into account that the deal is only for 5(i think) years and at that point the technology will be good enough that the guilds might actually be completely irrelevant.
dont care what anyone says cuz it's my opinion. The reason why AI was depicted as the main antagonist is because of what they can do. the movie "9" shows that, if you havent seen it, watch it and you'll see why AI and Humans are different.
I only generate AI images cause I get bored, but that's only sometimes as I just draw whatever pops up in my mind in MSpaint and share it to a discord server I'm part of.
There is no way Biden actually did anything, he can barley form basic shjdgkjhs
Mat pat- Disney is evil. Five year olds- wait.. Mickey Mouse..?
at 3:54 i thought it said ‘thai loves you’
The idea of being replaced by AI is terrifying, but i still hope to befriend AI in the future. Call me delusional or brainwashed if you want, but i think we should try to coexist with AI. No species replaces the other, and we have mutual respect for each other
7:33  also I think the other thing that probably influenced that particular version of Captain Marvel could be traced to the comic run that version comes from. I think the writer Kelly Sue DeConnick came from an air force family, and that might've influenced her writing this version of the character and could've started some opening points that you're speaking of for the places propaganda could've gotten in. Aside from the usual Hollywood rule of needing to be pro-military if you want to have access to their gear for your movie.
This comment is purely so I can see the UTTP waste their time on this.
The only price of media that has gotten me to actually like an AI is Fallout New Vegas. DDLC came close, though.
There's a reason why Germany high school students study current American propoganda
Disney no longer cares about profits, they are literally a propaganda machine. I really appreciate you kicking the bees nest on the way out of youtube, massive respect.
£80 billion is an indi budget?
2:31 so this is the guy who’ll replace MatPat
If you want to stop the uttp just report them and ignore them and join the auttp If you wanna rebel against them
Disney is pushing an anti male hero agenda
Mickey and other Disney creations have almost 100 years of wait time until someone can rip it off. Disney is riping off dead actors likenesses less than a ywar after they die. Capitalism hey!!!
as a developer i see only good in ai and sum MONEEEEY
If I got a nickel for every time Disney did woke nonsense, I’d have a couple of them, and it isn’t strange that it happened enough times where Woke Disney isn’t worth our time.
The housing prices comment at the beginning made me wanna cry (of laughter)😂 Love you Mat!!
AI is a proof we are living in the darkest timeline.
Well all artist do the same and that is consider original and yet when AI does it then it copy right.  It just reminder you when in history when female did art everyone said it was great till they learn it was not painted by a man then they said how bad and how it was and that it was not art.  Bottom line this fear of AI need to stop.  AI can bring allot of benefit and that why they higher up want to stop it so only they can use it.
I’m confused to why corporations like Disney are promoting something that lowers the value of their own creation. If the technology keeps improving, wouldn’t people rather generate their own piece of entertainment instead of relying on Disney?
4:44 Please tell me that is a reference to Power Rangers Lost Galaxy in the bottom left
Hearing the old intro filled me with so much joy.
if you want me to take down my AI Cover of MatPat "My Way", just tell me.
But the regulations they will go for will benefit big companies with AI but make it hard for small creators to use it most likely.
Ah yes, the good ole corporate hellscape
No 💩, Sherlock…
After reading the title: “In other news, ‘Water, Wet!’”
I thought the creator was just a big add for ai
If this video makes news form people saying matpats wrong. We know hes right
Now i remember what all of these videos were missing... The intro. Every great show has an intro.
Thank you for everything Mat Pat
How much did biden admin pay you?
Joe Biden can’t even remember his name, let alone a movie.
I love the rhumbnail it feels so 2016
Theorists idk what program would were using, but if an ai matpat calling me fatherless sounds better than what you showed I don't think we have any problems
"As always, I'll see you next week"  Always doesn't last forever, unless we get our very own AI MatPat.
Mickey Mao
The other day I was calmly searching on pinterest for drawings to show a friend how my characters look cause I'm no visual artist and every some time I will stop to look really hard at a drawing only to realize it was AI bcs it did not understood things like hands and hair and then I could not stop looking at all the images I've been looking at, realizing that a lot of them were AI and it made me almost... sick
I hoped id never see "Beer Bad," the 4th Season Buffy episode, ever again. Its practically universally considered the worst episode in the series. With s4 generally being recieved as the worst season in general.
He made so many dad jokes in this video and he didn't even point it out😢
Disney is the Big Brother of the film franchises
The propaganda pushed by Disney for the lgbtq community is the most obvious most heavily pushed agenda since WWII. Also Chinese inclusion backed movies, feminist (or whatever distorted movement putting on the mask of feminism this is) women power movies, AI is already embraced with no push back at all. The alarm is raised late, but I am glad there are people who point at what is really happening.
Sounds like someone needs to make remakes of Terminator IRobot and the first 3 Matrixes to balance this out.
LETS GOOOO I AM A SMART COOKIE🎉🎉🎉
That old intros giving me nostalgia
Interesting
i remember watching this show so much when i was 9 edit: one of the 'join the military' ads i saw said "lifelong memories"
The original film theory!
you are not immune to propaganda
I'm so torn... I just feel like this may be one extremist view to fight another, which will just end up causing more problems in the future rather than answers.
Hi matty-patty i hope you enjoy the last 28 theories 3:_) I will miss u😢😢
Honestly, I'm a big fan of friendly robot characters in movies  HOWEVER I don't like it when they look exactly like humans. Thats kind of  ehhhhh
Nah, tell me why immediately after MatPat talks about disneys deep fake faces I get an ad from Ben Stiller asking for the same thing
My honest opinion is that the more we try to completely block out AI, the more we end up blocking out disabled humans instead.
Important note that AI, like any technology isn’t good or evil, but neutral. How it’s used is what constitutes good or bad, but the AI itself is just a tool
I don’t think the martian is a good example of Hollywood changing videos for China because in the book the movies based on China also comes to the rescue.
6:06 Very stark. That new one is incredibly bad for us as a people
Old news
Reminds me of The Dark Knight presenting spying on people's phones to fight extremists as a good thing or at least a necessary evil
I’ll do one pushup for every subscriber I gain
Based Matpat is BASED
You think AI is the next propaganda? Maybe, but I think we're overlooking the current propaganda. Maybe with reason too.
I thought he retired?
How was "Knowing is half the battle" propaganda? I'm not being a sea-lion here I just think I missed a lap in the conversation.
I love how matpat is going back to the old intros for his final videos
I agree with most of what MatPat is saying and I'm completely against the Massive  Plagiarism Machine known as generative AI. Pay your artist. No work is for free. I have to disagree with the argument that all stories with a "good robot" is propaganda for Disney. The Creator is an amazing work of art and nothing in it says that it's ok to steal other artists work. I understood the "donate your likeness" part of the movie as a  critic of this kind of behavior in our society. I think it's possible to differentiate good stories with robots being the "good guys" with gratuitous inserts like the one done in the house of Usher
Don't let AI touch art or it will never be art again
I hate AI, it's just another thing to push capitalism and destroy the beautiful humanity that is in our creativity, our art, music, and writing. Everything is about money and it's disgusting.
So instead of the Hollywood authors & artists pushing propaganda, it’ll be AI doing the same propaganda?
Ah the old film theory intro is back!!! Man I love it!!
6:37 how does wargames push an anti-soviet message??? It's actually a commentary about the dangers of AI usage, and is surprisingly relevant to this day.    The message, atleast to me, seemed like "be careful what you set the goal of your AI to be" since the problem that occured in wargames was that an AI was taught to "win" nuclear wars instead of avoid them.   The Soviets didn't appear in the movie and none of their actions had anything to do with anything.
Disney has been putting g messages they know the majority of people disagree with in their films for almost a decade
God that the description of that plot point of The Marvels sold me more than anything else that I've heard about the movie :v
5:20 Kinda BASED Mat… 5:36 oh no never mind.
housing prices really got me 😂😭
0:53 7 Film theories remain
I lowkey think things like anime and other Asian pop culture is going to foil Disney’s propaganda plans.   Nowadays people want to do more collabs with One Piece, Naurto, DBZ, or even Sailor Moon. People want to attend Kpop concerts more. Gamers love Chinese made video games. People are probably more curious about Southeast Asia and Arabian cultures. More people support Palestine thanks to an app made by Chinese developers in Singapore.   This is going be a boulder for Hollywood in general to defeat especially since Hollywood is now broken thanks to the One Piece Live Action series.
I felt ao nostalgic seeing the old intro back once again. It took me down a trip through memory lane, seeing Film Theory all those years ago. I am sad that we won't be able to see anymore theories from MatPat, but I am glad to hear that he'll still be on GTlive.
Man system of a down songs are more relevant to this day just change the government out for Disney
2:38  that AI version of MatPat sounds a little more like a version Ben Shapiro due to the high voice pitch.
rip matpat
Someone should dub all post matpat film theory videos with ai matpat
I keep hitting "don't show me this channel", and yet this asshole keeps showing up in my feed.
video #16 of asking the film theory to make a theory about Masha and the bear
7 left…
Genuinely such a scary topic. Who knew the 2020’s would be such a dystopia
I forget, has MatPat tackled the running onn water part of the classic intro yet?
yay (sarcasm) now beyond making sure the people i watch aren’t ped0s and the ingredients in the foods i buy aren’t slowly poisoning me, i gotta watch out for movies being AI. 😢 i don’t like AI at all. even if a movie is good, i will not go to watch it. i will give my money to someone who deserves it. i can’t believe they are putting people out of a job just to make an extra buck.
the senile hair sniffer probably thought the tom cruise movie was real life smh
Hour ticket
2:08 well i mean if you think about thats how your brain works
The Creator giving me some Detroit Become Human vibes
Matpat: im leaving the channel to pursue a better work life balance   A.I. Pat: Well yes, but actually no
The fact they used the ERB Version of Michael Bay is hilarius
wokealizers vs AI
AI matpat sound kinda like bill sypher from gravity falls
I swear if IAmat is a thing i don't know if I can believe anything any more
7 Theorys remain........
bro brought the og intro back
The world is going downhill. This corporations will soon make ai control our lives, from love, to chatting, to work, everything and the wrost part is that life is already so hopeless that most would give up for a life simulated by ai.
And agree that SAG threw the Voice Actors under the bus...
as a robot toaster with a fluffy body, i feel offended by ai art. its just, nostalgic uncanny.
AI? What do you mean? There isn't any sentient machine since the butlerian jihad, because "thou shall not create a machine in the likeness of the human mind"
The old film theory goes so hard my goodness
Next theory should be who’s gonna win the 2024 Russian election
it's a good thing i don't watch modern🐀media
Is anyone else realizing that were never gonna hear MatPat's voice after these final theories.😢
ummmmm you say matrix 4 like its a twist but that was the indication of the ai in 3 at the end. it was very much implied a peaceful cohabitation than the war that had existed
The modern military propaganda sucks
I thought this dude was leaving YouTube?
This is where the fun begins, very interesting developments of both propaganda and A.I. I am curious where A.I might go, but the dangers it may pose to the world is great - like making a new life form who learns about humanity, the world and our ways - a lot of movies and shows that feature A.I turning evil has them studying us - ending up seeing what humanity does to our own kind and in a way deems us a danger to our own survival - then rationalizing that the only way to stop such behaviors is to wipe us out or bring us down to a lowered capacity - not too unalike to that of terminator. Great video!
Cool vid
Nah but for real, Tom Cruise, we'll all join scientology, just get Biden to do something about housing prices
Man i forgot how awesome the film theorists intro was
Btw does darth Vader count as a robot or a humanoid robot and fnaf was warning us all along
AI MatPat sounds fake, even by imitator standards.
THE OLD INTROOO
While I can understand you worries and recognize your fear towards media, I don't support your opinion. Crafting theories is clearly an inportant interest to you. It seems like you have overstepped your investigation into conspiracies about movie studios. The video is probably important to you, but I must say that I do not stand behind it's message of propaganda being spread by different movie studios.  I think you are entitled to your own opinion about my progress and the advance of other programs and their use in the movie industry, but claiming a whole industry trying to control opinions about it goes too far. You are seemingly connecting too many strings and forming a bad picture. Please try to not reinfore your current ideas through selected evidence. I would be exited to have a possible talk with an industry professional featured in another video, but I can also understand them not being able to get time to talk to you.  Please do not take this comment too seriously, as my information about the video is limited to the transcript. I do hope you can spread less guesses and hunches about deep sounding topics, such as conspiracies and propaganda. I wish you a great day.  Do you want anything else written in your comment? I will try to edit it to your specifications. If it isn't good enough, you can request me to rewrite it in the options menu.
Anyone else got an ad during this video and thought: "wow, propaganda!"
"It worked before with something everyone can agree on like nazis bad" oooooohhhh boy matpat I wish that was still true.
have to also point out that captain marvel did not work as a recruitment for the military. military recuitment numbers have been at their lowest for a number of years now - it's critically low. also, not a subtle snub of captain america. not subtle at all. captain america came out how many years ago before captain marvel? the messaging behind captain america is also very different from captain marvel's messaging. very different. captain america - steve rogers, a physically inadequate man with a lot of heart who wants to serve his country despite his handicap. because of his heart, he winds up becoming captain america. carol danvers - a woman who was told how much she was a girl ever since she was little who wound up becoming a pilot in the military - but we don't see that journey. we just see her afterwards. she also happens across a cosmic power by random events and is bestowed that cosmic power by accident. she didn't earn it. she was 'in the right place at the right time'. she came into her power that she already had by letting go of her oppressive messaging. that was how she earned her powers. very different from steve rogers, who had to work and earn becoming captain america. most of the marvel male superheroes had to do something to earn their power and abilities. danvers whas in the right place at the right time and just had to let go of her 'mental block'.
My stance on AI is and will always be that humans need to come first! I love robotics and technology, and yes that includes AI generally speaking. But I’m always gonna prefer when humans are allowed to have a say in what that AI can and should do, rather than corporations or the AI itself! I’ve recently got an idea of an AI tool that runs completely offline, and only uses data that the user gives it, as well as tools to use said data however the user wants, and even making it easy to delete and reset all the data whenever the user wants! (In terms of generative images for example, a drop down menu showing all the images and assets that the AI has been using, with easy to use tools to modify those assets or delete the data altogether!) I recently heard Mozilla might be working on their own AI that actually is offline and runs locally, and only trains on what you give it! I’m not holding my breath, but they claim to be focusing on making it as privacy focused as possible, as well as open source. So we’ll see what happens! (Also, I think a few years ago, Stable Diffusion changed its dataset so it no longer trains on artist styles or copyrighted work, or sensitive info, or inappropriate content. Not sure how true that is, but a new law is being proposed to require AI companies and devs to be as transparent as possible about their data, among other things! So I hope that happens! But even with all of that, I don’t think it will stop certain people from trying to replace human involvement, and companies from trying to exploit the tech for their own gain, and especially attempt at convincing us to blindly accept all AI, ethics or not! And in those instances, I’d rather do what you said, and form my own opinion! (That clip from the Netflix series just sounded so creepy! I know it’s probably out of context, but it’s just so disturbing! “It is _cool!”_ that just sounds so icky!))
i had a mikey mouse plush in my bed wile watching this
Oooh a spicy one today
The creator was written by AI
Matpat if you can see this whole AI propaganda thing in the Disney agenda I know for a fact you know about the woke agenda and if you wanted to be the ultimate YouTube Chad to go out on the highest note possible you will call out Disney's woke bulshit on your last episode
Barely any actors care that robots were taking jobs from people, So why should we care that AI is taking jobs from actors.
0:34  God, this brings back so many good memories
I live for the old intros
It good to see him doing theroies but I’m just confuse
Sometimes I wounder how you don't get in deep trouble from making theories like this.
I liked that picture at 1:39 so much that it’s now my Home Screen.
Yea, AI is the propaganda Disney are pushing.
Thank you for bringing this important issue into the light.
Wait can someone explain something to me-didn’t matpat retire??? I’m confused
:51 i just got sad.  :-(
My stance on AI is the same as my stance on Pirating, at least on most things. Why should I feel bad for your replacement if you can't be bothered? Why should I feel bad about pirating games if game companies can't be bothered to make their games easily purchasable? If companies can't be bothered to make good movies, why should I feel bad about AI replacing them?
i think recently there was a scandal of a game company releasing a game and some characters had lines that the voice actors *didnt remember recording???* and people accusing them of using ai (which they prolly did)
If the world is propagandizing A.I to be a good thing, I go the complete opposite way and say ban it.
Give Ollie the channel
If AI is right, then I don't want to be wrong.
INTRO IS BACK !!!!!!!!!
One of the craziest things to me is the whole censorship of Taiwan’s existence in modern Hollywood movies in order to get movies played in China. I remember when John Cena was forced to do this really cringey apology for sharing his opinion on China. Top Gun Maverick was straight up not aired in China just for featuring a Taiwanese flag in the background.
Talk about the uttp police there destroying youtube
I think the AI discussion in the fall of the house of Usher is everything BUT embracing AI. The character who wants to create the technology is literally the most evil character in the show, and the AI technology ends up being a horrific reminder to the main character that his granddaughter was killed because of him. AI is not a positive at all in that show:
yooo the original intro
It’s always good to see the classical intro
I love how applicable Inigo Montoya was at the end there XD
The worst part is that they use the loneliness of men, specialy young ones, as a way to get them to use more ai. While ai chats are used for roleplays and other things, we have to admit they are mostly used by lonely teens whishing to have ANY form of interaction with something as they cant have it with someone
theories are not gonna be the same without you man. we will miss you
i think that this with the episode about disneys archive of dead actors paired with this one is very important for people to see.    also the creator is actually an incredible movie.
AI and YouTube + anime/manga is already replacing Hollywood movies and shows for me. I have WAY more fun going on a crazy adventure with an uncensored AI chat bot, than I have had with these latest years garbage movies.   Check out Koboldai with sillytavern or chai or Kindroid. I had no idea how good they had gotten already until recently. If you do not know and you have any skill in writing and like to explore what's possible, your mind will be blown. And it is still very early days and they are getting better almost weekly.  Soon we will have more multimodal generators of fiction. Where we are creating our own stories tailored to our own interests, including movies. And I can not wait the latest generation of Hollywood garbage has been of so incredible low quality. They will be outcompeted soon, let it all burn I do not care anymore. If the whole industry vanished overnight nothing in my life would be worse off.
Organic humanity is kaput, finito, we as a species have become highly incompetent and dysfunctional, we as Westerners (especially Caucasians) (and maybe some Far Easterners)  are not giving birth anymore, we are not breeding new babies except multitudes of tight-knit religious and immigrant community minorities like in New York City, but AI although for entertainment uses for now might dominate everything eventually.
0:36 OMG IT THE INTRO OMG OMG
AI has been showing up even in hearing aid advertisements, as the industry has been studying the 'average changes' made by individuals in listening environments.  It's this thing that could be good... but also leaves a lot to be destired.
please more outcore on GTLive!
Fr
You would think people would still need to be paid for their voice/likeness being used ngl.
I'm very happy you used the old theme, MatPat and team!
For legal reasons, this video shall be referred to as a Film “Theory”
It was never meant to change you.  But plant the message.
The Creator looks nice....and sux.  Yep.  There was obvious AI Propaganda in the movie, and that ALSO sux.  But the movie is a beat for beat "special girl" trope. It's garbage.
Chinese news flash: the person responsible for toxic baby formula milk is about to be released from prison, jailed for only 15 years after the company profited from the death and intoxication of hundreds of thousands of children and babies.
Mat? We knew you'd comeback! Thought you've hanged up your nightgaurd cap but I must say, feels good to return every once and a while
We know
I wouldn’t say the fall of the house of usher is pro ai. At the end the ai is defected and only bring the main character sadness for his grandchild. Also might I say a cool way to use the line never more.
I know the companies will try a way to convince us that AI is good and their products try to see him kick back but Youtubers like you are revealing the curtains of it and I will support through art if I can because for me I do believe the AI is a tool not a replacement a real talent thank you once again of giving us information 😎
Can we get a hazbin hotel theory it's my favourite show and I would love to see one more with you running it
"Mass media is making propaganda!" "Yeah, I have found it a little weird how there's so much diversity, integration, LGBT—" "NOOOOOOOO, NOT LIKE THAT!"
i like how he called disney "house of mouse"
AI isnt the problem. Its the companies and people who want to missuse it companies are not your friends. Ever.
I miss the intro songs on Game Theory and Film Theory. I'm so glad MatPat is bringing them back for his last theories.
the intro made me think a 3 year old video came up on my feed again
Everything is propaganda this time
This actually really horrifying
literally no respect when you're acting like biden is taking action and making him look capable of doing good.
I will smithing remember i robot
Personally I'm fully on board with welcoming sentient AI and treating them with respect and dignity, but ChatGPT? Midjourney? All these other corporate theft machines? They're not sentient, they don't have emotions or morals, they're a tool placed in the hands of greedy corporations.
we all knew this for a long time. AI is overrated, its a sell and many mainstream media consumers are buying it. AI will never compete with humans in matters of art or philosophy, because it has no heart or soul. and never will.
they have been making propaganda since the cold war there has been many short on this. and it take a lot for me to comment on videos sorry
Can you do chores so you can analyze it short wars dodger is inspired by use Daksha and that’s why dodger is doing Ricky Ricky, and short wars things because dacha is literally inspired by you, and also is trying to figure out the lore of Regi the rabbit in short words, Nosal intro worst also and
bro really sent me an ad for palestine 💀
I already know that when it comes to creativity, every form of art needs emotions behind it. While AI can feel emotions but can only imitate human emotions. So AI can never truly replace humans creatively.
Well that's it, humanity is dead! We are going extinct, the way of the dinosaur, the way of the dodo.
"Disney is making propaganda" Everyone: First time? There have been people saying this for years.
Bro imagine if AI MatPat becomes a re-occurring character after MatPat leaves😂
AI is great. As I am eating human food with my human family, we discussed how we wished all the other humans would accept it. I have more to say but my human job at company place needs me.
That first ad was an ad for The MARINE CORPS not the Army. Semper Fi!
Ai MatPat is horrifying
You should do a video about BOTs on social media.   The corporations and marketing companies have an army of fake accounts.
I thought this was about the israel AI generated propaganda ads on hulu
Honestly i got bored of AI always being the bad guy.
The last 5 years were all about the woke propaganda… anyone miss it?
like 3 years ago I remember shacking my hair whenever the old film theory song came on and when I herd this it was really nostalgic.
Disney was always propaganda once Bob Iger took over.
Ron's gone wrong is another example
I think there's plenty of unsubtle propaganda around AI already so I'm curious where this goes. Legit think the currently popular opinion on AI is pretty gross though. By that logic any creative who takes inspiration, cues, or elements from other media they've previously absorbed isn't a real artist or writer. I truly believe we are witnessing the early beginnings of a new human created race of beings, and the degree to which our inate prejudice and xenophobia is affecting the wider perception of this new race is truly sad. Data's trial in Star Trek TNG, anyone? I really thought if something like this possibly happened in my lifetime then we as a species would do so much better then we have thus far. Rejection of AI only serves to make art and creativity less diverse so it really surprises and hurts me to see smaller more passionate parties be so anti ai and the Hollywood big wigs who should reasonably be worried about the higher level of standard and variance of tools available to smaller creatives and critics are actually the ones tryna push for AI freedoms and righta(albeit with highly exploitative ends in mind).
Biden wants to do something 😂
Detroit become human
my idea of how ai should work is for people whose content is low and you don't have other people to help you with stuff you're not good at like me, for example your good at animating, you can do that but if you whomp at making original music, ai can come in handy. but if you're a content giant like Disney who can actually hire people, ai isn't a good idea. it's just my opinion though.
The little lesson at the end of GI Joe and He-Man was less propaganda, more a fig leaf that let them call their 22 minute toy commercials "edutainment".
I understand your thinking and it is good to be aware of corporate goals in media but your analyses at 12:20 are incredibly reductive. The supreme intelligence in The Marvels is explicitly confirmed to have started the kree war with the skrulls  -- The point the film makes is not that AI is good, it’s that if a society becomes completely dependent on an AI to the point where it follows it unquestioningly, it will eventually destroy itself. You could argue the same thing with The Creator: the point it makes is that if we follow this road to its logical conclusion, we will either have to learn to coexist with this technology, or try to destroy it. It also has the thought experiment of if we had a completely sentient, decision making, emotionally mature AI, how could we justify it as subservient to humanity? Writing it off as “AI propaganda” ignores the attempts of these films to not just follow old Matrix/Terminator sci-fi tropes and get us to reevaluate our place in this new technological landscape.
its hard to feel sorry for actors being replaced by AI when other idistries have been phasing out people since the industrial revolution instead using robots. This is simply the next step in technology. what it comes down to is either advancing tech into replacing everyjob and capitalism falling as if nobody works nobody earns money and nobody can buy anything. Or restricting advancements in tech in order to conserve the system.
OG Intro back!!!!
Wow!
Lets be honest, we all saw this coming
In the creator they used real footage of a natural disaster but edited it to look futuristic
Ai is terrifying its creepy when i use a AI program i feel like im playing god with somones life
Lets be honest here. The problem has never been the existence of generative ai. The problem is who controls it. There should be very strong restrictions on that material is allowed to train an ai (including for non-commercial purposes). While I am strongly opposed against copyright in almost all cases, generative ai is the one case where I'm willing to make an exception. I also believe that the use of regenerative ai to replicate the voice or image of a real person should legally be considered identity theft. This is one of the few scenario's where tougher restrictions on what the average person is allowed to do will help the average person.  Of course these kinds of restrictions would only mean anything is an independent committee that is independently held accountable is responsible for investigating violations and if the fines are proportional to any earnings/damages on top of a base fine for impersonation/copyright theft. So in other words, it's never going to happen even here in Europe.
I think that AI is just something we have to learn to live with. There is something interesting going on here, which is that for once, the interests of the big guys are aligned with the interests of the little guys. Here's what I mean: Disney wants to be able to freely use AI, because it will make their productions cheaper, and expand their capabilities. The thing is though, that AI is SO cheap, that I, as a creative individual without the backing of a multi billion dollar corporation, can have access to AI to help me build my project without having the funding needed to pay a human. AI enhances my ability to express my ideas and build my dreams. Maybe some day, I'm able to monetize my projects, and then I'll hire people (who will no doubt be better at the tasks than AI, for the time being at least), but in the meantime, I've got this robot to help me get off the ground.  Ultimately, the reduction of human labor from our requirements to survive is something we need to be pursuing, and I think we've made a lot of progress on it. Just the fact that people can earn a living on YouTube instead of plowing a field with an ox, should be evidence enough that things are changing. AI and automation are the next step in that. Just remember that Art is subjective, so while AI can compete with people, it can't truly replace them. Furthermore, when the artist's needs will be met even without his labor, he will continue to produce his work, and it can only be better for it, as it will come from his enthusiasm for his art, not the growling of his belly.
Why glance over the latest propaganda like it doesn't exist? It's quite obvious the main push for the last 4 years or so has been DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) and ESG (Economic and Social Governance) the woke propaganda is pushed more than any other propaganda yet we arnt alowed to talk about it. It's taboo.
Man, I really missed your old intros. Happy to see that they are back!
The cycle shifts. This is the end and the beginning. Maybe you will watch maybe you won't. But the stage is about to be set They will dance. Goodbye, MatPat, I wish you the best
Okay but the Chinese aided Mark Watney in the Martian in the original book, and the politics of it all were explored to some extent. This addition to the story wasn’t a Hollywood thing.
Didn’t he stop with youtube? I’m confused.
what was that opening…
You know when matpat is covering this it’s a big problem.
Sorry dude
If AI were to actually start taking jobs, it will be another 1929 -1939 (if you know, you know). But the use of AI to replace people might get outlawed before that could even happen.
Yeah what else is new
Love you MatPat. Be well friend.
Talking about AI...Who remembers Deepfake Matpat from the streamy awards?
This isn't a theory, they're definitely doing propaganda and the worst one, woke propaganda
I will take one breath for every like on this comment
I think apocalypse now would be interesting to have in this video
this sounds to much like the old matpat
This is scary
They made an matpat AI !
Mat pat based😳
We'll miss you MattPat 😢😢😢
I think there may be something to this. Translators for anime and manga have been exposed for inserting their political beliefs and mistranslating the content. Now there is a rise in support for replacing those people with AI.  So for Hollywood, get rid of the people due to the financial losses of personal ideology to replace with AI.
in case matpat's research team didn't know, the strikers lost after all. unions are looking in to incorporating AI voicework. the unions - you know, those entities that were supposerd to be about representing their members before they became much more about collecting union feees and essentially becoming a second boss to their members. unions were good once, long ago. most people nowadays, especially younger people, don't even know what unions used to be like compared to what they devolved into over the years.
Everyone liking the push-up comment voted for Biden!!
I really like that the old intros have been brought back for the past few theories. Helps the nostalgia flow 🥹
Yo, I know a song that has the audio clip from 7:11 - 7:18 ! It’s a lofi song, but I don’t remember the artist 😅
We're gonna miss you Matt Pat one of the coolest dudes I've ever met
Thank you very much for this episode, MatPat! Not just because of AI, but because of the use of propaganda by the entertainment industry in general. Buzz words like that, due to their overuse, have begun to become tools to incite feelings in order to legitimize or demonize narratives and it's very important to shed some light on the semantics of some of those words. As someone, who works with media, it's very easy to spot those subtle attempts at manipulation, but not so easy for the general public, so thank you for sensitizing your viewers to the existence of those techniques!
Bold of you to assume that the world won't be plunged into war before we get the true AI = good film
Is it me or, did matpat change his voice on this inr
THEY BROUGHT BACK THE INTRO LETS GOOOOOOO!!
metpet being besed fore one of the last times
Missed opportunity to reference 'they live's "eat, marry , reproduce" propoganda
Ill miss you :(
Taking Hollywood a**holes jobs away is the least of the problems ai could bring.
Why would corporations suddenly spread the idea of AI being the good guys even if that AI is controlled by ambiguous or morally grey or evil corporations? Maybe because True AI is coming and going to control everything, our governance, the economic markets, education systems, and more. You'll own nothing and be happy. I'm not buying it.
Biden wouldn’t remember watching any movies last year or any within the last 5 years. You meant Biden’s handlers.
Ok but robot gf
The next mission impossible movie movie should make Tom Cruise save the world when he buys a house for a good price, and explains why people should be able to buy their own houses for good prices 😂
If you have a pulse, the propaganda has been obvious, invasive, and, at this point, tiring.
It seems that similar subtle advertisements promoting socialism and criticizing religion are happening nowadays. You didn't mention this to avoid being controversial, I suppose.
Me uses ai to make anti ai movie so what side am I on matpat since I use ai but in a ai bad way
I think the best idea I’ve heard about on AI, (unfortunately I’ve forgotten where I heard this but I think the point still stands) was that ‘an AI is running/thinking on the ideas and the motives (so to speak) that the creator gives it’  Main thing I see with AI is that in a vacuum it’s incredibly powerful technology that can be used to help people in an effective and sustainable helping manner. But as much as I love to believe that it would work perfectly here in the real world I think it ultimately won’t. Not because there’s people that are genuinely working on this and other world changing projects like AI but because it only takes one person or group or cooperation to mess with something like that, to turn it into something it was never supposed to be.  It’s something that I believe will never go way because there will always be someone that will have the motivation to influence people or the creation of an AI to benefit them
Wait what?
I am super tired of media seeming to prioritize propaganda, rather than good stories and characters in recent years.
The introoooooo
Every time that text at the start of the episode shows up i feel like Voldemort when someone destroyed one of his Horcrux. It is literraly soul ripping. We are going to miss you even though i am not gonna miss that text.
Weird thumbnail
That modern military ad sent a chill down my spine. The framing and animation felt like a cartoon aimed at first graders. Which given that the military knows they've basically lost gen z that makes sense that they're trying to dig into the next generation down. But dear lord that's so disgusting.
Man that intro...peak
Fun side note: as a young kid, I used to eat my cereal every morning out of  little yellow melamine bowl. Melmac, Alf's home planet, was a brand name for melamine dinnerware. It's still around and apparently safe in dinnerware (NOT as a food additive) so long as you don't microwave it or store very acidic food in it for a long time.
Sleepy joe stayed awake for a whole movie!? That’s crazy!
Matpat: Everyone can agree that the Nazis are bad! Twitter, Reddit, 4Chan, etc: Wdym?
I'm never forgetting the 80s movie, Short Circuit, that was all about 1 of 5 robots that went pretty much reverse of this, that 1 robot wanting to be like us humans, and not wanting humans to be like them (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
So that's why disney thanked  China for letting them film Mulan at a Concentration Camp
It's always been propaganda
i will miss him☹️
Are you sure The Marvels is everyone's favorite punching bag? I feel like it's mostly conservatives who complain about the movie
The idea of "AI propaganda" feels so much like a sci fi dystopia but ITS REALITY WHAT
day 1 of asking for a potential mean girls theory
This reminds me of the AI Mat Pat singing, "i did it my way"
Wait, why did AI MatPat kinda sound like Bill Cypher? Uh oh, ehT dlroW si gnidne, eht espylacopa si gnimoc!
Good thing I haven't been to the movies lately. In fact, most of the stuff I watch are either older shows or independently made online content. Not to say I haven't watched anything that utilized the AI technology; they just happened to be brief rabbit holes that I check out before moving on to something else.
Incorrect. Identity Politics are the current propoganda
I’ve always been pro-Ai
He’s so right. Disney promotes lgbtq. And the director for the new Star Wars movie said she wanted men to be uncomfortable.
Tbh, I've never thought the theories would get so....political idk 💀
I personally have been fine with the idea of Disney using AI. After all, the results ends up being a cheap and utterly awful results on their movies and in the box office.  I think that no matter how "powerful" AI becomes. It always gonna be a source of cheap results
love how during talking about a movie about AI someone is telling people to go and watch a movie where AI is good and humans are bad lol....someone is trying to suggest
Watch the movie "The Congress."
In the case of The Creator, even though the plot was about AI as "people" the movie just felt like a documentary about the ways that America demonizes and de-humanizes people from other cultures that aren't ours. And then showcasing the insanely over the top weapons and measures we develop to show that "we could wipe out your whole existence, but choose not to."   It definitely resonated with me in the same way the Tul'Kun hunting scene from Avatar 2 did because sometimes people don't like to face the gruesome reality that we as humans are capable of until it's presented in a fantastical means.
In my personal opinion, AI can be best described neither as a Blight for artists nor as the literal "Deus ex machina". Some artists or producers might use AI to get a better idea or a different perspective on what they've been working on. But if we rely only on AI, whatever comes out ultimately loses its meaning. AI is, at his core, just a tool. It's up to us being responsible in the ways we use said tool. I'm really glad this topic was addressed on the channel, hope to see more episodes like this in the future.
The "next" propaganda?  It started with Bambi
I do not, in fact, have 6 fingers on my left hand. Sorry, buddy.
Thank you for covering this omg
The cree planet AI thing makes sense though - I am not saying AI good I am saying if your planet is built on AI and you destroy it then yeah planet go boom. I never saw either of the movies - Also the AI planet destruction Is is present in stan lees comic ... that was a stretch mat. ``First appearance	Fantastic Four #65 (August 1967)``  On your second point ``the creator`` ... yeah that is sus.
I love that he put the original intro
Disney trying to be hip to the kids about AI: "And there’s a million *AI* just like you. Who cuss like you, who just don’t give a f*k like you. Who dress like you, walk, talk, and act like you. And just might be the next best thing but not quite you."
DISNEY IS EVIL
Love your vids
It’s been forever since I have seen the intro
When you realize this is an ai generated YouTube video.....💀💀💀
All my homies hate AI art. We are convention artists and now have to figth for tables against people slapping ai art together
So happy that all the intros are back
Does anyone else remember the American “Got Milk” propaganda campaign in the 2000s?… Milk promotion started in the 1950s and they noticed dairy sales dropping in the late 90s early 2000s so they had anyone famous do those weird posters put up in schools to promote just drinking milk… not any specific brand though, just any milk in general. Wild.
This feels like an old school theory I love it
Well, good thing I've always been enthusiastic about AI and can't wait to be lose my job to a robot so I can consume media 24/7. If AI completely takes over entertainment then that just means I can have media specifically tailored to my likes and interests
Recruitment for the USA army since those new woke ads  have bein dropping for anyone who didn't know
Propaganda is trying to change your opinion without telling the whole story. So yeah, marketing  My favorite part
Did he say “as always”? Idk about 7 weeks from now
I saw Creator a few days ago and I thought it strange that they went that way. I didnt think too much about it since Ai has been the villains a lot in earlier moives and I just thought it a creative idea, but I see now that my first reaction was right and the uneasiness I had was right
The first movies also have REAL military member in them!!
Ok here we go again hay mat Pat I know this is a lot to ask for but I was thinking that u could do a remake of your first video but I know you are doing a lot and u aren't going to see this comment see u later bye 😊
The AI discussion as it's led right now is so... American. Yeah, AI will "steal" your jobs. But the point is to make working obsolete. To have time for the things you are passionate about, not only for those that you HAVE to do to survive. Especially in the art space, I get it. But since I am neither talented in painting, nor do I have the time and willingness to become good at it by sheer practice, I've used AI to create references for characters I want to be painted by actual artists. It can also be a tool for exploration.
I disliked my own comment
Honestly out of this whole video, I'm glad you used the ERB depiction of Michael Bay.
You're comparing a 90s Marine Corps ad to an Army ad
W old intro bro wth
Why don't game theory hide a theory in their videos ?
I actually have no problem with the AI generated opening for Secret Invasion. They hired an artist to draw the source imagines and ran them through AI to create an _alien_ look to it. Because, that was theme of the show, aliens trying to pass off as humans.
Ai bad matpat good
quite the topic to make a video about before quitting youtube, but hey, that's just a theory
I’m sorry that og intro caught me off guard in the best way possible
wow hmmmm i am doing my part hahahahahaha🎉🎉🎉
Ai anime matpat 😍😍😍
This video brought to you by a Marxian Material Analysis (TM)
Honestly, I dont find a problem with the AI images. There’s nothing wrong with going cheaper with AI art.
2 absolute truths in this video:  1.Propaganda is nothing new & will never go away  2. We’ll always fall for it
Wait didn't matpat retire?
one of these days future trunks is gonna show up 💀
bro ai is crazy
Is this video propaganda 🧐
I write for a living and AI Is a ways off from writing dialogue and scenes, that aren't clunky and cheesy as F...  But it is a useful tool😊
Israeli propaganda.
Lol solid use of that quote from princess bride at the end
Kyle Hill has an amazing few videos on how gen AI is making mass "science" content farms, most of which is just incorrect "facts" loosely based on other creators work, read by an AI voice
I think one of the bigger issues, is how they are trying to make Generative AI, and Broadspectrum AI (what one might call true AI) seem like the same thing when they really aren't. The AI you see in movies is fully sentient, capable of free thought and complex ideas, thats broadspectrum, what we have is narrow spectrum. AI capable of a few tasks and doing it really well, but they can't expeand beyond their programming which is an important distinction as that separates them from what we've seen in movies.  We've yet to achieve truly sentient AIs, we only have AIs that work within a set parameters, and large companies are trying to make them seem the same when they aren't.
It makes me so happy to see the old theory intros
AI art is not stealing and anyone who says it is are babies and idiots. This whole video is propaganda to make you hate ai. You stooped as low as they did matt. Also, they dont need your permission to make a clone of your voice or a "deepfake". Get off your high horse. You're popular, but not THAT popular
Let’s goooo classic intro
Mat is getting bold for his retirement!! I'll watch it now, but WOW. Loved it! haven't watched many recent movies, but its a pretty good topic
this is why youre not invited to marvel premiers, matpat 😂 /j
This video is more important than people think these are just some examples. It’s scary and a shame we won’t have matpat around to continue but I am thankful for videos like these that bring awareness to the changes and shifts to our society.
How much propaganda is in this video 🤨
I got excited when you mentioned The Creator. Not because Ive seen it but because there’s been a billboard for it in my area for like half a year and it still hasn’t been taken down.
I knew he had to do this one before the end, MatPat never disappoints
Thou shalt not create a machine in the likeness of the human mind.
This is a surprise because?
but free housing healthcare and worker rights
I'm incredibly pro-AI, but that doesn't mean it can't be misused and abused like any other tool. Companies hyping up AI so they can convince the public to accept how they exploit it at the expense of others is just gross.
🎉🎉Wow, this is so cool guys🎉🎉
LET MATPAT COOK!!!!
speaking of propaganda, did you know that there is toys/action figures of venezuela's president? it's called "super bigote" it had his own animated series.
AI MatPat really said: Father when can I leave to be on my own
A little late to say that, Matt. Disney has been propaganda for a while.
Not goona lie, I missed the intro...
I WON'T do 1 pushup for every like I get on this comment 💪
Also reporte them too🔥🔥🔥
i dont want u to leave
Yo you fw skibidi toilet
This is old film theory esc and I love it
Didn’t you quit YouTube?
Ai should be used for memes
thanks for posting matpat
Why am i feeling that the price for the house in the start of the epsode is a code?
I for one welcome our AI overlords.
Its like how Ultron literally existed in the marvel world yet when the queen of wakanda says that she doesn't trust AI and thinks that it will try to take over the world, which it did, her daughter denounces it as movie rubbish and says that could never happen.
At this point in time, i think everyone needs to rewatch WALL-E again, and not just for the environmental messages
Ok. This video is like really good. Such an important lesson to teach everybody.
Disney? Creating propaganda?! I haven't this surprised since Seth MacFarlane once told me that water is wet.
When Disney ends up becoming the real Skynet it would be hilarious.
what if this whole video was by ai matpat and we didn't know
Crazy how the same thing happened with the internet. This is just far more dangerous
This is bad.
I feel like AI should be given to the artist and writers and all of those guys as a help and tool
Did anyone else notice the original intro is back
I'll be honest, I very rarely watched most of the average theories these past few years, but I'm really going to miss these more meta videos. Every time I finish one I always come out feeling like I've learn a lot of new, interesting, and just overall important information about the world. Thank you for talking about all these important topics over the years that surprisingly little other people cover, these videos will truly be missed.
Don't worry, ai anime matpat cant hurt you... 15:16
Its crazy to think that the president of the US is susceptible to propaganda
5:37 some thing everyone should agree on but somehow don’t
I really like how matpat is using old intros, brings back old memory's
The next Mission Impossible movie is about fighting Death. Biden: Now it’s time to cure death.
I missed the intro
The way I see it, AI is inevitable in the long run so there's really no point in fighting it
matpat you’re so awesome
The matpat ai doesn't even really sound like you. Your way of speaking is too difficult to replicate I think
I’m getting a blast of nostalgia from the old Film Theory intro
WE HAVE THE INTRO BACK!!!! 🎉🎉❤ My jaw legit dropped. Thanks for the nostalgia!
I don't have a job yet (not old enough to have one) but I really want to become an animator and with AI improving and all creative work being replaced by it, where do we go? what do we do? I don't want to be stuck in a dead-end job where I am not happy just because AI has made MY dream job obsolete... art has been shared BY humans FOR humans for the longest of times and whenever you looked at old paintings EVEN CAVE PAINTINGS you can tell there's was a human who did this to tell a story, their story, their journey and AI just doesn't have the heart of art like humans do. If AI will replace almost everyones jobs then there has to be a change in the system entirely, AI doesn't need money to survive the humans do.  What. Will. We. Do?
HE USED THE OLD INTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love seeing the old intros.
detroit become human, the finals, od by kojima?????? TF İS GOİNG ON???
Thank you for this news. Have a nice day!❤
god the old intro hit me right in the nostalgia
Housing prices/ affordable housing is the biggest issue that impacts ordinary Americans which isn't being discussed in politics
I love the old intro is back
Speaking of artificial intelligence 🎉My school is the first in the world to participate in Google's new study program on artificial intelligence🎉 and on Friday three days ago we were taken to Google Israel in Tel Aviv and at the end of the year the program will be submitted for approval by the CEO of Google Global And so Israel contributes something else to the world and I am a part of it, but no one is going to be thanked and yet will be against us😢
Don’t mess with the mouse
I’m not Anti-AI by any means, but I’m also smart enough to know what being told in a film. Sometimes I care and sometimes I don’t, in this case, while I do think the legal ramifications need to be worked out, I’m overall excited for this change.
Well, guys, it was nice knowing y’all  How long do you reckon we’ll have left until none of us have jobs anymore because of AI
Please dismantle the entire system on your way out. We are about to lose a loud voice of logic and reason. You are more important then you think. Thank you for your time and intellect
The old intro is back!
Al G. Rhythm was awesome as a villain
you should make a theory about godzilla minus one
@2:45 so what you're saying... is you aren't leaving the channel? Welcome AI MattPat. Glad to have you 😂
when i first watched the creator i was like "yeaaaah this feels a little on the nose"
There is no one on the planet with 2 moms
Missed that old intro
Boy I sure love manipulative capitalism greed only designed to milk as much money out of everything as possible with no interest in morality or the future
Cuban sandwich? do i look cuban too you? i want a Migga sandwich a Migga sandwich b!+#
Right in the first minute, such a heavy hitting joke, phew.
Here comes the UTTP, gang. hide your belongings.
Ok see you next time ✌️
THE INTRO IS BACK
Bruh, like it ever happened(1940's anti-Axis propaganda)
The greater propaganda point of these AI stories is the loss of the innate uniqueness of humanity, individuality and the natural biological person. It is ultimately pro-communist and collectivist propaganda.
My main problem with AI is how much it is used to copy and distribute content that I can hardly discern if its true or false. For one of many examples, AI has been able to synthesize the voices of... certain political figures from the Middle East. This could potentially lead to internal conflicts of information and, even if it sounds exaggerated, a similar scenario to what was once the Cold War, and that's only one of the problems of course. With the rise of AI we won't know who or what to trust anymore, what's real and what's false and what's happening just outside our homes. Most of us will isolate ourselves even more, disconnect from the real world into the digital one where will be fed up with propaganda after propaganda until that's all that is left.
I don’t think AI is that bad I mean I’m fine if they only use AI to fix simple mistakes that the animators made but if big corporations only use AI that’s also fine because animators get paid nothing
you are not immune to propaganda
money motivates progress.  it's why we aren't colonizing the moons of saturn or jupiter.  too expensive to just get there let alone set up a resource ripping colony.  Still: if AI will make producing entertainment less expensive, then I'll be cool with it so long as my cost drops too. Not by a lot. I'm not greedy or unrealistic but if the studios and publishers want to use AI generative content and charge me more for it because its' "New and Improved" I'll do the same I did decades ago when products advertised 'Reduced Calories' to justify a 50% price hike when in fact it was 20% less product.  I just wont buy it.
7:37 nah this was just a terrible movie 😭😭😭
In order for someone like Tom cruise to make a movie on the housing market, he would need to feel affected by the market like actors felt affected by AI…. Which just won’t happen
hello matpat i will tell THE BOTS TO SHUT UP!! IF YOU LIKE THE DUM BOTS, UTTP  IS DUM, AND UTTP IS USELLESS. NO BODY IS GONNA LISTEN THE UTTP DEATH OF UTTP !!!
FINALLY THE INTRO, WE’LL MISS YOU MATPAT
That seventh heaven joint episode was 14 karat drug war GOLD
We needed this vid years ago
This has me remembering the anime Carol and Tuesday where AI content is so commonplace that there's a bias against human made media.
John 15:18 “if the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first”💕✝️
Lets goo new videoo
Mission impossible: buy a house on an average income
Romans 10:9 "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved"
ROMANS 1:16✝️"FOR I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST FOR IT IS THE POWER OF GOD FOR SALVATION TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES" ✝️❤️
John 14:6"Jesus answered, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no one goes to the Father except through me"
2:32 that sounds nothing like you
✝️WAIT STOP✝️it’s not to late to turn to God❤️Jesus died for us but the devil did nothing for us❤️God bless u all Repent from your sins
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world he gave his one and only son and whoever believes in him shall not perish but live eternal life"
Thank you Tom Cruise
Michael Bay being the version from Epic Rap Battles is just 👌👌
I though you quit? Guess your back!
There is a sense of irony at the fact that I have an AI program ad during this video...
Potato
So... After MatPat leaves, they plugging in MAItPAIt?
Bros exposing the matrix 💀💀🗿
these bots in the reply section of half of the top comments are obnoxious  also pretty ironic given the topic of AI
Oh so NOW people are afraid of losing their jobs to technology
haha sure we are! 😉
Thank god for Matt patt putting out the work that needs to be done before his departure ♥️♥️🙏
CCP BOTS OUT IN FORCE WITH THIS ONE
OLD INTRO IS BACK
Thank you for the og film theory intro
Old introoo whooooh!!
Matpats filters are slowly dropping now that he has nothing to lose
Don’t you dare put pro ai messaging in doctor who Disney. DONT YOU DARE.
No you don’t get it you just don’t get it! It’s not about we just don’t care about AI anymore WE DO AT LEAST I DO! But do I care about mark Hamill being used for Luke Skywalker in the mandalorian no! Do I care about the deep fake of Harrison Ford in indiana Jones? No? But did I and am I still upset about Wayne Pygram use for Grand Moff Tarkin or Carrie Fisher For Lea in Rouge one? YES YES I AM! But why? Is it simply because I no longer care about AI being used in movies? No! It’s because Carrie Fisher was upset they didn’t use her directly for Lea in rouge one! It’s because Wayne Pygram was not alive to consent to his likeness being used in rouge one! Why am I not upset about Mark Hamill or Harrison Ford? Because both actors consented to there use in that way for said media ITS NOT THAT WE DON’T CARE ANYMORE! It’s that in those instances the actors who’s likeness was being used consented to there likeness being used in that way! Am I upset Star Wars theory is trying to deep fake Mark Hamill for one of his fan projects? OH ABSOLUTELY! MARK HAMILL EXPLICITLY SAID HE DID NOT CONSENT! When the actors who’s likeness is being used consents to his likeness being used I don’t care. When the actor who’s likeness is being used didn’t consent or couldn’t have because there dead THEN I CARE! A fact I don’t think you understand it has nothing to do with us not caring anymore but all to do with the actors who’s likeness was being used consented to there likeness being used in that way!
Do an armored core theory, for you know who, may he rest in peace ❤ he knew armored cores potential before anyone😢 I miss him
Hi
For the Martian, the Chinese government saving the day was actually made from the book by Andy Weir, which might have been influenced by what you were saying, but I doubt as much as the other films
Lgbtq is also a propaganda being used nowadays
Matpat telling me "knowing is half the battle" is propaganda is possibly the strangist way to say he's been mindwashing us the whole time
Kind of selfish of MatPat to want Cruise to 'fight' house prices instead of, oh I don't know, LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE THAT AFFECTS MORE PEOPLE THAN JUST HIM!
Viva la artist, destroy the AI!
"Artificial Inteligence" is an abomination and techno heresy. Praise the Divine Machine Spirit and the Omnisiah!
"As always I'll see you next week" 🥺
Im kinda scared of where this is heading
they even added a completely random appearance of an AI robot that helped a lot in the new Doctor Who specials, just in the background with no back story or anything. And the specials where made by Disney who just bought doctor who…
AI is a very *nuanced* issue. If an indie creator wanted to use AI to animate some hard scenes or create a voice their vocal range isn't able to, then I see no problem. If a corporation wants to remove most human jobs from the creation process, however, then it is a problem. Human-made works will always have a market because they will have some sort of essence to them, some type of soul that AI has a hard time creating right now.
Biden only signed it because his handler's told him too.
I doubt biden thinks much of anything anymore... for years...
was whistling along to the theme song and then i realized "wait- THE THEME SONG"
I'm currently a university student majoring in Animation. Ever since I've started, the talk of A.I. has been constant and I'm so scared about my future career choices now :(
That classic intro got me so nostalgic 😢
i thought Matt would finally talk about something big like Disney's lgbtq-DEI propaganda that's killing the company.
im looking at the veiws and every 2 minutes 100 viewers come out of nowhere
Me: * sees title and hasn’t even watched the video yet *  Me: That is the understatement of quite a few years 😂
AI matpat sounds like a timey radio host from the 1970's
YES! THE CLASSIC INTRO! I have been satisfied!
I’d call AI mixed original since it uses images to create new images idk how I feel about ai in art it’s walking a line
So you're saying Predictive Programming isn't a conspiracy?
He dont mis
The creator also sounds like Chinese propaganda as well
The purpose of art is transmission of information about human experiences, an AI fundamentally cannot create art. It is only the illusion of art. There's no communication.
Excellent Video MatPat.  I'm in the business and I can say after the strike I couldn't see the forrest because of the trees. The studios "caved" last year to the unions because the have the "long" game in mind.  I will remember this moving forward in all that the content I see and consume and MAKE!
I hate the use of AI when it comes to creative works or is threatening people’s jobs
Thank you for calling out Hollywood's propaganda. This has been a most valuable PSA. Beep boop beep boop
Disney has always made propaganda.  It did so in wwii.  It just continued it in it’s movies and we assumed that each movie was a kid’s movie.
That old intro is so nostalgic
We will miss you.
idrc, i love ai
The intro made me go back
more like this plz
These last 5 years has been absolutely disgusting for political propaganda. This is a very good video.
it’s crazy how comically evil big corporations are. they are the villains that are depicted in their stories.
Big miss on the "Fall of The House of Usher" AI plot. The whole point there is that AI is a tool for a horrible greedy rich woman to live forever to keep doing awful things. And she is sugar coating it for her granddaughter. It is meant to be interpreted as a bad thing.....
I think the rise of AI art and production is very much going to mirror the early industrial age, where there's a pushback to maintain human labor and refuse the machines purely to maintain jobs for some people.  I think it will fail.  On the moral standard, I think the current complaints about AI art and writing are missing the fact that many schools explicitly do the same thing to teach real human artists.  Copy the masters, learn their styles, then make something original.  That's exactly what we're doing with AI.  AI reproducing a particular person's face should see legal consequences if there isn't explicit permission from that person, but AI copying an art style to make an original work is fine.  The scary thing will be the use of deepfake and AI voice generation to fake content that has consequences: politicians endorsing things, making statements, or footage of someone committing a crime.  Interestingly, the promising piece is, if these tools are released to the public (and inevitably they will be), that may open up a whole new realm of indie film making, which I think is quite promising.  Who needs to raise tens of thousands of dollars for voice acting for your animated YouTube series when you can just use AI to voice it?  We already see a whole realm of new art being created with AI art tools, and the people making it are more 'art director' than artist.
i dont hink that i have ever been over taken by a frog in boiling water.
A recent move called Megan made an AI robot the bad guy though
classic intro?!??1
Can you do the Eeveelution squad pls cause it has lore and it's a Pokémon comic series and it's on youtube
Trust no one!
Don’t doubt that Biden would make such important decisions like that based on a movie
If AI keeps growing, what’s the point of currency? Soon everything will be selless.
you have no idea how happy I am to once again watch the classic intros first on game theory, and now on film theory:]  edit: chat don't respond to spam bots, report them instead
we miss you matpat
Amazing and scary video!
I'll miss MatPat when he goes, atleast we have AIPat theorizing where our dad has gone to buy milk and searching for who asked. But seriously, your Film Theories were just as amazing as your Game Theories, and I will always cherish the knowledge you have shared with us and the fun we all had.  Also, it would seem like AI will turn out like Skynet as every dictator does starting out; Behind a painter's canvas
Oh, that old intro 😍😍😍
The AI Matpat sounded a bit more high pitched, like teenager Matpat would sound
Find the 2012 movie Branded if you can because its been quitely shushed up. It discusses the influences on everything you are talking about in your last few vids.
"wait its all propaganda" "always has been"
The greatest propaganda use of AI is detroit become human.
We are going to make Skynet and I don’t what to think about it.
Max headroom could be made with actual computer generated imagery easily in the 2020s, which is scary to me.
Gonna miss listening to your voice 😢
I realy just wanna say nah man really
0:53 "7 film theories remain" :'(
In capitalism , technology are in service of the capitalist to the detriment of everyone else , this devices that could have been doing great achivments to society are having their potential wasted for quick profits and opression of the workers , of the people , giving tecnology in sevice of the SOCIety is what will make us grow and save us from impending climate chaos and the word problems.
Ive been on the fence about AI for awhile. What ive learned from the movies and shows ive seen that have covered AI, a lot of those pieces of media goes over what the AI learns. The AI being bad in movies is all because of what the AI learned from humanity. Its given me the whole thought of "be nice to the robots" The episode "Rm9sbG93ZXJz" from XFiles season 11, had just that. With what we have now, it feels all based on how you use it. With how its being used now, its making some really bad things but thats because of how its being used. Im an artist myself and yeah it is scary seeing art being stolen but also from when i was learning how to draw, it all started with the same template and with looking at other peoples art and seeing how its done. I now have my own style. The way its being used now is causing a world of harm to people. AI in its current form is a tool to be used but all tools can be used for harm. Thats what it feels like is happening right now. Thats my opinion on AI at the moment. I dont think its either good or bad. I just think its currently a tool thats being used for good and bad. I am open to change my mind tho.  Edit: something i forgot to mention is the part about AI "stealing peoples jobs" thats one of the issues when it comes to how its being used. Its like when factories became automated. So many people lost their jobs. Theres pros and cons with automated factories. Same with AI. To me it feels like its very much a grey area, but then again, everything to me feels like a grey area. Its quite a struggle for me to "choose a side" so idk.
2:32 the voice sounds like Ben Shapiro
The intro is so nostalgic to me
I think it's pretty hard to impact people if no one watches what you make-
AI can be anything we can program it to be. Good AI is backed by good people. Bad AI is backed by bad people. But also, buggy AI can be made by anyone, which is a wild card in the masses of AI that we are seeing these days. We need to tread lightly, yet confidently so.
I always knew that AI was unstable and really impossible to trust.
I just got hit with so much nostalgia listening to the intro I'm gonna miss matpat so much. I love that he has talked about important topics without saying what option you should have
Remember, You are not immune to propaganda.
Imagine if this entire video was scripted by an ai
can yall make a spirited away related episode?
Man, all the classic intros, they just have a too much nostalgia!
I want the old intros to continue 👍👍👍👍
In other news, water is still wet.
Fighting Matpat Matpat: Domain expansion Science Blaster
QUICK, DOWNLOAD THIS VIDEO BEFORE DISNEY ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE MAKEPAT TO JAIL
Personally I see AI technology as a tool belt (yes Skynet bad I don't think we're at large scale General AI tech yet), tools can be used for different purposes depending on intent and who's using them. Corporations wanna fully cut people out the question if they could, but AI is still just following instructions, AI still needs creative people to be used properly
I think one of the things that has changed because of AI is how artists veiw art now. Ai doesn't just "steal someone's art and use them" it changes the art, making is almost completely different because it doesn't just use 1 or 2 art it uses MULTIPLE art works to train itself. It's references multiple artworks to make its own artwork. Many MANY MANY artists do the same thing, sometimes it's just 1 artwork they refrence. One form of artwork that many people who aren't artists use? Collage. People use magazine clippings and other pictures to make their own art piece. Ever since the AI controversy, I've seen so many newbie artists being attacked for just referencing artists that they love and wish to be like. Ofc no one cares about the art work of those who aren't alive anymore because I've seen no criticism towards Starry Night being used on literally everything with no change at all just the canvas being shoes or something. Unreal actually makes you clarify if you use AI for your game which many other places might pick up on.
Hi
One final Disney film theory i will miss this
1 pushup for every like ✌🏽
detroit become human is slowly becoming more real
Disney trying to influence us to think a certain way? *SINCE WHEN!?!?*
We gotta get this, the number one trending
AI Mat Pat gives the same vibes at Mimic Gregory.
You don't say
I watched marvels
We love you Matpat!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I em 100% on the side of AI  the human brain is nothing more than a meat computer anyway
this video also propaganda. he mask the real left-wing propaganda Hollywood pushing.
Bad outcome: People lose jobs Good outcome: Creative people gets more tools Worst outcome: AI gets behind a paywall and only big cooperation's get to use them. We lose jobs and get less creativity   Pleas don't just fight AI. Make sure it is not misused. Promote it as a tool. And find a way to reward people making original stuff whitout AI as well
I watched the creator and I hated it because it was just plain propaganda
jokes on you i dont fall for it because im too broke to go see movies
I love how the thumbnail looks like an older Game Theory Video.
Please let there be a rick and morty theory left..
Always remember, you are not immune to propaganda.
Matpat: nobody saw the marvels in theaters Me who saw it not once but twice: are you sure about that?
TRANSFORMERS THEORY PLEASE
can you cover pikmin on game theory?
The first 2 terminator movies feel more relevant know than ever.
Is it just me or did we all know this already for the last few years?
As the timer is counting down, I get more and more sad because he gonna be leaving us so soon!! 😢 Can’t the theories stay with us forever!? 😭😭😭😢😢 But, I understand about family.. so if ure reading this Matpat, after have fun with your life. R. W. F. ( Rest With Friends and Family. We wish you the best. 🫶❤🫶❤🫶🥹
Wow, this is actually horrifying. Disney trying to make us all feel for AI while they use it and put people out of jobs… seems like a total Disney movie tbh. I honestly had no clue, thank you so much Matpat for bringing this to light (I hope the video doesn’t get targeted by Disney and shut down in some way)
Any creative knows that anything "Original" is just something people can't figure out where the influences are from.
0:36 already on board because PLEASE! Papa needs a new pair of shoes and a picket fence!
No one’s gonna talk about that this is one of his last videos?
Disney + Propaganda is the inevitable pinnacle of MatPat's FilmTheory Legacy!  NOW, which channel will be 1st to tackle "indoctrination" ? Style Theory (e.g., war on drag art), Game Theory (e.g., collaboratives vs. shooters), Food Theory (e.g., hyper convenience vs. foodies), or yet again Film Thoery for the most popular "indoctrination" tools--for good or evil--Cartoons and Pundits.
Honestly it’s wild. When I was younger robots were a bad thing in media. Now their loved ones
I will get 1 like for every like on this comment.
I feel like also some of disney's bad plotlines from have also been AI generated well before "Wish". The problem with all of the art, writing and sound, is it seems to always be identifiable as lacking human perspective in its creative process. I can't quite describe it but I can feel it like  the uncanny valley phenomenon.
Im not gonna lie but the only reason why my science grades were good is because i watched matpat
11:05 drfinetly the current stuff is BLM and LGBTQ
8:38 is that from ERB
actually this is a really important thing to be covering. Super interesting.
An interesting thing that could happen is that as the corporations start using ai instead of real actors, the future AIs might be trained on older ai actors/voice actors and slowly become worse as actors, creating a need for human actors.
Love seeing the old openings again
I hate everything that's AI related. In the university I had to redo a LOT, because a group member used a text generator to write his part, not talking about many people whose' life is at risk because of corporations want to cut budget, changing them to soulless proggrams. AI itself is not a bad concept if it used right, and visely; the problem is when people with minimal knowledge and empathy exploit the system... And it's disgusting....
Doesn’t MatPat notice how his Video Game Mayan Calendar is unfolding.  Since that video, ChatGPT and CRISPER have both become big in the 2020s, leading to political hot button topics around AI and designer babies.  According to the theory, we will see hellish wars over resources come into play within a decade, which we already are somewhat starting to see now.
The crazy thing is that robotics and automation have been threatening jobs for over a decade now. The only reason you see articles and videos about AI everywhere you look nowadays is because the people that have the platforms are suddenly seeing THEIR jobs on the chopping block.  Generative AI is just the latest in a long line of technological advancements that have been threatening the work stability of humans for years. Creators only care now because they are experiencing what the rest of us have, so now that makes it a big deal.
this must be the first time I actually like a MatPat theory, disney fell ever since 2012
it is genuinely a wonder that not only did the doctor who specials get by with no positive ai points, but actively had a large plot point against technology in general
Hi I like matpat it’s sad he’s leaving
Finally the intro is back
China saved the martin in the movie because in the book the movie is based of of that’s what happened
les goooo
I didn't ever think I'd here the film theory intro. Beautiful
NO. NO!! GI Joe was not almost 40 years ago! I'M NOT THAT OLD!!!!
its honestly kinda hilarious how the people who do propaganda are also mostly really bad at it, they're just like "this thing you think is bad is actually good" and they usually don't have the creativity to make it more subtle and more influential which is a good thing
The Marvels was actually pretty good to anyone who actually went to see it. And I think MatPat seriously misunderstood the Kree Supreme Intelligence AI. Specifically calling it a benevolent AI overlord? There's nothing benevolent about the Supreme Intelligence. It's true that Carol destroying it caused a civil war that lead to the planet basically dying, but the AI itself was arguably one of the bad guys. If you check the wiki page for the AI, the Nova Corps is listed as one of its enemies. The whole plight of the Skrulls, the invasion of their homeworld and their general mistreatment at the hands of the Kree, that was all under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence was responsible for the brainwashing and effective leashing and weaponizing of Carol Danvers. Marvel doesn't want you to think the Supreme Intelligence was some sort of pro-human AI to be idolized, in fact it mocked Carol's humanity, calling that a weakness. I'm not saying that Disney isn't trying to put a positive spin on AI for their own purposes, but I am saying that the Kree Supreme Intelligence is NOT an example of that.
Listen, I plan on using AI and cerebral organoids to be immortal yo.
At first I was like, "it doesn't help that we're steadily forgetting how to scrutinize messaging for the motives behind them and increasingly interpreting things literally." But, as the video went on, I was like, "umm. Now that you mention it. There's been a lot of anime recently where AI are portrayed as a discriminated class. Huh."
Disney, McDonalds, Marcel, Starbucks, SO MUCH MORE support literal genocide and propaganda. Are you really that surprised?   The fact that you promote it Matpat, the fact that you give it an image makes people buy it. Your genocidal side is showing, shameful. Boycott all of it!
You inspire me to make an Anti-AI movie and show all of it's problems
Nice, the old intro! Also are there really only 7 theories remaining, or are there 4 left?  Edit: oh okay, there are 7 left
You just now realize this?
We... might need to make sure that AI will somehow become dumber and dumber so it's unreliable to use-  Or that Disney and Netflix become bankrupt as a bit of a lesson...
Seems fitting that this video about the dangers of AI propoganda has a comment section flooded with bots...
Oh I thought / hoped this was going to be able the woke propaganda going on
Theory suggestion: how many chocolate bars did the cop from wanka eat
Or... stop watching this BS. There's a hundred years of great content you can watch right now for free
Haven't been on this channel literally for years, I just want my childhood to remain until mat is gone
I’m watching this 1 hour after it was uploaded
Matpat is really giving us his all for his last theories
The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is just that, Artificial. She can't be smarter than the people feeding her information, and if they are dumb, she's dumb. I'm also pretty sure that Wish pretty much PROVED AI is NOWHERE NEAR ready to overtake people. When she is, she will realize how IMPORTANT people are for creativity, she WILL be sentient after all!😁
Btw, we hate corridor crew
Zelda age of calamity   But a baricade of Books will not protect us - King Roam
The other thing being propagandized is radical feminism
So, at the risk of provoking people, I gotta ask, I all of this "character diversity" in modern media also propaganda? Is is that just pandering in hopes of making more sales? I imagine it could be both, but dunno
People are always going to be scared of progress. Change is natural and it happens whether we "want "it to or not.
Woke propaganda is the main type of propaganda I hate
we know
To be fair if Disney want ai to look good just make another Bamax season because everyone loves him
Please tell me how that creative process is any different than the human creative process 1:55
If AI can help me make a million dollars on the stock market I'll sell my soul in a second.
to be fair, AI in the fall of the house of usher was used by someone evil and was very creepy
you notice how matpat is making these last few theories really memorable
If an AI does your job with a better cost/benefit... this is sad for you... but its good for everybody else. Don't fight against technological progress Robots already took a bunch of jobs away... in farms, industries, online... And what this did was make things cheaper, more accessible... Cheaper movies/shows/games means MORE movies/shows/games And probably also mean BETTER stuff...  If writing, voicing, drawing, coding... all are cheaper... then you have a lot of money left to improve and refine those things In games... you may have bigger stories (as writing them is cheaper/faster) with more voiced dialog (as voicing is cheaper/faster) with more diverse backgrounds (as art is cheaper/faster) and more funcionalities (as coding is cheaper/faster) and even new stuff (as npcs answering anything, instead of having only predefined answers..) We are not there yet, maybe... but we are pretty close... and AI already can do a lot... So, for now, embrace it and enjoy... it will be better for the large majority of people if not all...  If you want to worry about it (aside from possibly changing career choice), its fair... in some years AI may do so many things that we become useless... no jobs remaining...  But the solution could not be to not use AI... if you dont... someone else will... you will be left behind... We will then need some kind of UBI.. idk... But trying to stop AI will fail.. you can ban it in the US... and what you will achieve will be people consuming stuff made elsewhere using it..
MAKE AFuturama episode
Hi matpat can you do a theory on an elmwood trail
I will do 1 Sit-up every “We’ll miss you, Matpat.” I see. If you see one, say so by liking. Or not, I don’t care
Now out of all my years of watching my Matt pat I would know the difference between an AI generated my Matt pat in a regular MatPat cause I’ve heard his voice over so long that if I heard somebody who sounds like Matt pat in the real Matt pat I would choose the real Matt pat
Interesting fact about AI. The developers of chat gpt open ai accidentally made the horniest ai ever.
@thefilmtheorists  Please do a episode on game theory about the unravel franchise
The AI in Fall of the House of Usher had a bit of a plot relevance though. We had no idea that Lenora was already dead, the AI was texting her grandfather the whole show, but all it could tell him was Nevermore. It's not the greatest use of AI in a series and I'm no AI fan but I don't feel that Mike Flannigan or Netflix were pushing that "AI is good" considering in that example the AI doesn't work and everything the house of Usher made fell apart.
Based film theory
Interesting thought about the movie The Creator: it ties directly into your premise on propaganda but in a dark way? Viewed through the lens of the end times Biblical narrative the AI becomes a tool of deception which tricks people into believing that what they once thought to be wicked is benign.  Trust us we have your best interests in our heart you just don’t understand- even the title gives it away. Something to think about- don’t be deceived
How thiw video end will decide if you are biased and bought into the propaganda
If AI provides better entertainment, then that's fine. People will just have to adapt.
They used ERB for Micheal Bay XD 😂
Honestly though, I think a lot of media is just using AI based plotpoints because they tend to focus on what is relevant at the time, many consider LGBT messages in media propaganda, and in some cases it probably is, but also, it's alot about what society is focused on now and what many people care about, the same is going for AI, there are many sides to AI and whether it's good or bad, and there are many different opinions, and that's going to be reflected in our media, whether the studios have a clear opinion or not, creators do.
detroit become human lore
I'm personally torn on this issue. As someone who majored in Japanese in the hopes of becoming a translator, AI could make translators obsolete soon. On the other hand, I love all of the AI covers of songs and scripts when they're done well. It opens the possibility to make people's impossible visions into a reality. But for every good AI channel, there's a hundred half-assed ones.
If i could tell myself 10 years ago that we would be living in a time where AI is close to replicating humans, and being promoted to us by the media such as this, he wouldnt believe it
Oh MatPat, you have outdone yourself this time, High Five! 🖐️
That old opening gave me the nostalgia tingles
LOl he talks about propaganda but not the blaringingly obvious propaganda that Disney has been pushing which has been killing its hold on the industry.
Omg I wasn't prepared for that intro and when it happened I felt a rush of warm tingles all through my face haha

It's crazy how he's talking about Disney and Propaganda while completely not mentioning the Left-Wing-ification of their works.
What's interesting is that stories have always had the intention of providing subtle messages, it's the whole concept of a theme.  The problem is that it depends on how it is handled.
Didn’t need a 20 minute to know that but ok 👍
As an avid Transformers fan and AI user. Yes
Didn't everyone  just get done about Matt patt quiting or whatever  and yeah here he is lol
Anyone else remember detroit become human?
Old Film Theory intro let's goooo
I just don't get how people stand by Ai
We know Matpat, welcome to the party.
MatPat you should've mentioned chappie at one point. It was a lesser-known movie but it was one that I always loved.
here before disney strikes this vid
Honestly I think the biggest bit of propaganda I’ve swallowed on this topic was Detroit become human.
I've never seen someone get so close yet miss the mark
please keep the intro I know it's bad for watchtime but they are so good
This video is propaganda too
There are heroic AI as early as the first Matrix..  The Oracle, Keymaker, Seraphim...  The Animatrix has several stories about heroic AI fighting for freedom.
The most important video on Youtube right now.
Have you seen DougDoug?
You're late to the party. Disney has been pushing woke propaganda for over a decade now.
ai should only be used for heavy work, not for creative work like art
i like how matpat side step tip toe around actual propaganda Disney pushing. but chicken out to say it
Ahhh, the good ol' Film Theory Anti-Disney video. Ya love to see it.
Thank you! I don’t feel crazy! Last movie I watched, The Creator, I kept thinking to myself ‘can we stop romanticizing AI? Can we please take a few steps back and keep in mind the lessons from Terminator?’   I don’t know if I’m alone, because hey! Disney is using propaganda!
12:15I liked it though…😢
YES, finally the intros are back!!!
You always be the goat🙏
In Warhammer, the acronym for A.I. means "Abominable Intelligence" for a reason.
What is with these UTTP bots-
How is it 7 film theory’s but 4 style theory’s?
That intro is so nostalgic
Youtube sucks for driving MattPat away.
yes honestly with the rise of deep fakes and ChatGPT not knowing basic math and all the AI contemporary cyberpunk distopia all these stories about "robots and ai are good actually trust!" made me increasingly uncomfortable so this video is so good!  likewise when fnaf ruin came out last yeah and MimmikGPT and voice stealing was a plot point that was SUCH a breath of fresh air
Most of the titles include a question. So this one would be called "DISNEY is making PROPAGANDA?!" but this one is a flat out statement
biden doesnt have the brain cells to think we need to have laws against ai, someone told him XD
This is actually an importantly educational video.  You're using your last episode slots well
Is, say, propaganda against xenophobia bad?
Okay, that is pretty creepy.
I was in China during Iron-man 3 filming. I can tell you it WAS HORRENDOUS! The Milk propaganda he’s talking about. You have to watch the chinese actor chug that glass of milk for a full uninterrupted minute and doing “ahh” sound like he’s drinking Pepsi or something  it was unreal. Many western film in China got censored but this film is the most abhors one
Disney doing propaganda ? 😮😮😮 NOWAAAY !
Tom Cruise needs to fight immigration
Idk how many likes this will get but I think that May should do a theory on hazbin hotel whenever the whole thing releases.
The current propaganda is woke propaganda
Disney thanked the Chinese death camp prison guards after filming Mulan. Disney is evil. And yes of course they push propaganda. Anyone paying attention knows that.
btw the frog in boiling water experiment is fake because the frogs kept pulling from the water when it started to become hotter, they dint move when the director of it did the experiment but before removed their brains while they were still alive and were alive during the boiling, so unless your missing an brain when you are shoved propaganda, you likely will notice it
noooo wayy.... what?! thats unbelievable!
I’m glad that MatPat finally just came out and said it. It feels he’s been skirting around the topic for a while now.
The Creator looks great but the story is stupidly boring.  A one time watch at best.
I will say, that AI voice sounded like game theory... just not a specific game theorist.
The problem with regulating AI is who decides who gets to use and have access to AI tech? You know there will be an attempt by corporations and government to restrict competition and common use.
A.I. can be codded to be good so why is this bad?.. the only way AI  can be bad if it is codded to be bad..
I'm really worried about the spammers in the replies. It's a real issue.
The nostalgia that smacked me in the face at the old intro 😭😭😭💖💖💖
UTTP stands for "Unite the Trash Pack." It's an online group or community that is known for engaging in toxic behavior, trolling, and spreading negativity across various platforms. They often target individuals or communities that they disagree with or simply want to provoke. It's important to note that their actions are generally frowned upon and not conducive to positive and respectful online interactions. So, it's best to steer clear of them and focus on more positive and enjoyable online experiences.

Look, I liked Detroit Become human, that’s why I like AI so much
Not so long ago Lego did a sponsored project with Volvo. The concept vehicle was designed by children, the concept was a wheel loader that would be ai operated. This was a while ago but it’s still favors the ai in a good light.
mat pat throwing a final movie reference
Detroit Become Human I feel also does this cause it literally puts you in the shoes of the androids
EXCELLENT video, team. Thank you for bringing this to the front of people's minds.
Awesome and cool! ^_^
15:04 I wouldn't call Atlas a good guy robot (for the most part)
This comment will get 1 like for every like it gets 💪💪💪💪
matpat throwing shade at the ai parodys
ya but disney is still taking L's  and this  ai  Propaganda is not helping them out  for their failures.
Did you see the capital of conformity short?
Yeah, but the types of AIs depicted in those movies actually are good, the message of The Creator actually is great, it's just that under this totally still relevant and functional system we live in, AI doing humans' jobs for them is a bad thing. Because it makes those people end up homeless, while dystopian billion dollar corporations use their likeness to steal even more money from the people. :D  Like, I'm ranting too much again, but, like, a hundred years ago, everybody dreamed of a society where robots would do work for us, and we'd have the time to spend with friends, or play, or relax. We're now at a point where society could do pretty well even with only those, who want to work, working, because robots can do almost anything. But robots taking our jobs is bad now? We kinda got ourselves in this mess, somehow.
8:36 NOT THE ERB MICHAEL BAY
Some day Ness from the Fnaf movie will become public domain😅
I'm glad MatPat is still around. That's why I'm watching this video
i just rewatched the "DIsney Deathcount" series yesterday and was hoping that a video on Disney Propaganda (which was mentioned in that video as a possible future video idea) would happen as part of the final set
Oof.
I swear in 2 or 3 years, ai will just take all of our jobs
Who else has been watching a lot of Mat Part
pain exists... but this is distracting from pain, it's nice
honestly shocked and refreshed that you are willing to make this video...Sad part is you only covered a tiny sliver of all the propaganda in media.  But what is more American than creating profitable propaganda.
Mat Pat: AI is evil, and they are trying to promote those films in the new movies like the Creator.  Mat Pat as well: The Creator is such a good movie. Is Mat sure he's not becoming AI as well.
Love this episode, though the example with The Marvels feels a little lacking? I don't know what other word to use so I apologize.  I would like to admit I never saw the movie, but if the Suprime Intelligance is in control of everything, then wouldn't that be like going to a country and taking out a king or dictator, when everything hindges on one person or thing and it gets taken out, wouldn't everything fall?  If you take out out leaders, there would be hystaria, things and systems would fall into ruin, in that moment of fear people wouldn't be thinking correctly and would start fighting possibly causing a civil war. Which could cause a lack of resources like water, food, and if it gets bad enough could really mess with the amount of breathable air as well.  I mean no harm or that I am dissagreeing, just stating my viewpoint and open to discuss
Oh boy, this is gonna be a fun ride (thanks matpat for making my childhood)
I noticed many china supporting narratives in previous films and now seeing this shift it is nice to know the kind of message that companies are trying to convince you of
man... I like using AI to make fight scenes, Little stories using my OCs, or faked episodes of Columbo. I don't think AI is bad but it shouldn't be used for big companies to pay actors less.
I noticed that they left out all the political messages Hollywood like to put in.  Probably scared of the backlash of even calling it out, which I don't blame them!
This makes sense because what I just been starting to watch is people looking up stuff from generating AI and they’ll be asking them to do stuff like for example the acts make a soup bar sad and then the AI would make a soap bar look super Duper sad 2:05
I thought MatPat left
We will miss you a lot, MatPat.
This ain't even a theory this is straight up facts.
Honestly most of the films and tv shows are essentially propaganda. Especially when it comes to stuff like gun control and gender identity
I want a half life theory
This is a really great informative video. In my personal opinion, I think AI is ok in a limited sense. It is in that gray area that it is a good thing until we rely on it too much and are influenced by it. I'm ok if AI is used to assist people in creation (i.e. give ideas, a reference point) rather than straight-up creation/recreation. But how much is too much? That depends on the person and unfortunately, that is what keeps it in the gray area.   Unrelated note: In the future, if AI becomes sentient, I do hope that Robots and AI will be the nice kind and not the going to end humanity kind.
sans is Ness forever!!!
The creator was the first movie i ever watched in an empty theater, so i don't think many people saw it
Title: Disney is making propaganda  Me: oh no, where is this going  Video: *talks about ai*  Me: oh, phew
Just like your hero Joseph Goebbels?
Calling Biden the President is like calling the Middle East a "stable region".
very important episode. it's honestly so sad what the world has come to :/
Knowledge is power!
An example I know of the military having control of how they appear is is after the movie Godzilla vs Mothra the military could not show up because of a scene where the military attacks a baby Mothra larva (A baby good monster). From that point on, instead of the japanese self defense force it was the G-force fighting Godzilla and other monsters
I think it was several years ago I read that 90 percent of all Western media is controlled by 6 Mega corporations.  I'm sure it's become a lot worse than that in the intervening years.
Disney has always been against the people
I’ll never accept ai never I’ll fight against it always.
Pls do a demon slayer theory
The old intro brought tears to my eyes 😢❤❤
I'm surprised you didn't notice the propaganda of the last 5 years and it didn't even make it into the video
ai matpat vs real matpat
Matpat is gonna wind up offed somewhere by Disney execs. Worried about you mate, exposing the House of Mouse only has bad repercussions😂
Feels like the Marvels botched up their Pro A.I message then... Which tracks to be honest for Disney. They can't even do their Propaganda right it seems.
Funfact: The beginning scene from Dial of Destiny is the only scene I liked in the movie. I didn't like the rest of it.
Who woulda thought mattpatt was based
You don't say?  Conglomeration of media has always been a massive threat to our freedom, and Dis-versity is just a part of that.
oh boy, I sure do love megacorporations and corporate propaganda!!
The line in The Fall of House of Usher is not supposed to be pro-AI. Is literally spoken by one of the villains of the story! You clearly haven't watched the show
5:36  You'd think so, wouldn't you?!?!?!
You’ll be gone soon… but atleast you stay for a little longer
I actually rebooted my system during the video
I’m scared now
As someone who wants to go into the entertainment industry as a Screenwriter and Voice-Artist, I feel pure despair at the thought that I might be going into a dying industry, an industry that lasted for barely over a century and is now drawing it's last breathes for the sakes of cutting costs and because AI is only ever going to get better.   That's the scariest thought of all. There's no way to stop AI or the innovation of technology that can cut jobs, it just steamrolls over everyone in it's path because people with more power than you know you won't care. Nobody ever does.   "You will own nothing, and you will be happy."
My only thought on a.i stuff being art or not is If Disney can steal decades of stories and copy paste them on repeat why can't a robot?
Don’t leave please Iv Ben here for years
:(
I mean it's understandable that Disney would want to use AI to cut costs on making it themselves like seriously they already know all their recent releases since endgame have SUCKED making much less than their budget. so they probably don't have enough to pay the workers.
I found it funny that most of the pro AI movies were dunked on by audiences, without even knowing the propaganda
Ladies and gents Matthew Patrick
The 7 film theories left brought out the feels so hard 😭😭😭
No wonder Matpat wants to disappear from the screen after confronting  Disney. Mickey coming from him.
I like AI and all but its scary......
They did WHAT WITH THE VOICE ACTORS??
matpat really blowing it all up before going out
Nooo..the old intro….I’m gonna miss it with Matt 😢😭
i had missed the intro song
I depict the U.S. military however I want in my films, my right as both free speech and fair use of review and criticism. Nobody owns the right to color, color is just a bunch of wavelengths and the U.S. Military does not own the rights to wavelengths that have existed before the formation of the Universe as we know it.
5:25, i mean... the guy was kinda asking for it.
Let's just block everything from them
I think an important thing to remember is nuance and critical thinking about these programs. And like matpat said, formulate your own opinions once you know the facts.  You’ve got some people saying it’s just as, if not more important than the discovery of fire. And then you have people who think it’s merely a fad and things will die down eventually. Both sides are extremes that imo are about as grounded in reality as a hallucination is
Aren't R2D2 and C3PO as well as J.A.R.V.I.S also AI?
I think that if you walked away from The Marvels with the idea "so the Supreme Intelligence was actually good" then you might just have misunderstood that movie. The SI *was* evil, it waged a one-sided war against the Skrull, its destruction was good. The problem was that this society had fallen under so much influence of the Supreme Intelligence that destroying it was basically the equivalent of wiping out the entire government structure. *That* is what caused the collapse of Kree society. It wasn't because the AI was good.
You sound like insomniac's Jameinson but you are right
The intro
Disclaimer: For the 1944 portion of Indiana Jones 5, they just hired a double that looks like a younger Harrison Ford. Also, Wish bega development in 2018, so I doubt they even considered using A.I. when making the movie. It was written by Jennifer Lee.   Also, just in case those heartless bots start overflowing the replies of this comment, just report them and ignore them. The less attention we give them, the more likely they'll leave us alone. Remember the old saying: "Don't feed the troll."
In other shocking news, fire is hot, and water is wet (there's no such thing as dry water I will die on this hill) but seriously Walt Disney was EXTREMELY  anti Semitic during ww2 and pro American propoganda was all through Disney in the early days
8:37 Don't think I didn't notice the use of ERB's Michael Bay.
I love that the old one intro is back
What if Matt patt responds five hours later saying he didn’t make this video😷
I don’t know if i would say I’ve accepted it, moreso annoyed by it and unable to do anything about it
The Simpsons level foreshadowing can be best found in Iron-Man 3 & Winter Soldier (Zola breaks down Paperclip 🇺🇸📎 🇩🇪 ) just rewatch them…
This is why I only watch YouTube
I remember back in the mid 90's Bruce Willis had a cartoon and was digitally scanned so he could appear in the show. He said at the time he could use it in the future when he was unable to perform to continue making movies. I wonder what happened to the copy and how he feels about it now?
Hi 👋
AI is dangerous and needs to be heavily regulated, we are entering Cyberpunk 2077 SoulKiller levels of copying people.
i missed the old intro
This is why i don't subscribe to DISSney + anymore!
The loop skywalker deep fake. Was successful because of how John seemed to seemed to try and fix what. Disney disney Kathleen, Kennedy and Lucas film did to him in the sequels. After book of Bubba, fit though The fan base checked out again because they forced Luke back into his role in the sequel trilogy.
This man is tackling hard subjects lately
if you wanna watch a great movie about ai watch steven spielberg's ai from 2001 it's great underrated movie
YOU BROUGHT THE OLD THEME SONG BACK!!
Propaganda is in media, entertainment, and schools. Thanks for reminding us to keep an eye out and think for ourselves
Wait what
so disney = bad   got it  thank Matpat
i thought he retired
Gonna miss you matpat keep up the good work!
Everything fine, untill AI will work like in game SOMA
MatPat is taking his final jabs at Disney before leaving this channel. The battle between Film Theory and Disney is legendary at this point.
remember to report bots in replies rather than replying to them
Aw man i missed the film theory intro god bless you matpat
Usually, I really like your videos. This one, not so much. It is in my eyes closer to a conspiracy theory, than an enlightened and reflective video. The world is constantly changing. Technology is constantly developing - This is life and nature. AI is the next tool in line to change our world (same as the computer or other inventions). Right now, we can make the decision and have the opportunity to decide, how it will benefit us or not. To think, that all of these movies are propaganda, is in my eyes unfounded and unreasonable. AI is a very current and socially relevant topic. My opinion, whether you like it or not: AI will be and is a tool to create and to help create movies, art, songs, etc, in what extend and how plagiaristic is to be detemined.
11:02 I'd say its wokeness
Mad theory: what if the theories channels were made BY an Ai?🤯
BREAKING NEWS: TEZUKA STUDIOS BUILD A REAL LIFE ASTRO BOY VIA THE POWER OF AI AND ANIMATRONICS.
I never knew MatPat made "Reality Theorists" as his secret post-retirement channel
2:31 Hey guys! I found the new Game Theory host!
I havent watched the vid yet, I have a feeling I wont like the comment section of the video with some people decrying the propanda in question as anything they call "woke".  *Edit* alright glad its about A.I., but getting real tired of "The Marvels" slander, a movie which was given the most raw deal because it came on the heels on the strike where none of the actors could promote the movie. Not to mention it AGAIN had a massive chud-fueled internet hate campaign against it led by alt-right pipeline "creators" and grifters. The movie isn't perfect, but its fun.  You want a meta Theory Matpat? Call out Nerdrotic and his racist band of misfits and get their channels demonitized.
Why is matpat talking so fast lol, I had to watch it on 0.75x speed
I thought the ai de aging in Indiana jones was terrible
Disney has been making propaganda alright... and it ain't just about China and AI.
Naw I noticed the propaganda in "The Marvels." I was like, but wasn't the supreme intelligence the bad "guy?" And yeah "the Creator" movie was just a complete no for me.
I am a simple man of simple rules. AI, humans, and everything in between should follow God. Simple as. And AI should be used to combat evil and idea-mercenaryhood if need be. The Megaman saga, Star Wars and Bionicle, how I see it, are excellent focuses for how the metal and the flesh could reach a point of harmony in the future, all things considered, all 3 of these stories are godly in themselves. Nevertheless I agree that certain degree of purity should be mantained among humans, and that these should always remain good tools, or beings, below us. Never for evil.
MatPat: Disney is making propaganda!  Everyone: What tipped you off?
Spmatt
Commenting until the fun ends: BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY A FILM THEORY
Ok matt revisit the old gametheory you did, games predict the future and you are not going to like it. It is on point untill now...
That intro threw me off, I had to check the published date
Another awesome video!
ai takes the collective knowledge of the internet and specializes it for u, just like googe, where teachers say its not your knowledge
"Human beings may not be perfect, but a computer program with language synthesis is hardly the answer to the world's problems." A quote from 24 years ago, from the game Deus Ex, which is scarily relevant today.  Disney's been feeding subliminal messages to generations of people. AI may be a great tool, but it's a tool all the same. With great power, comes great responsibility...
I mean... There's a leaked zoom meeting of Disney producers literally admitting to pushing propaganda to viewers, with an emphasis on younger audiences
Remember when all those farm hands lost their jobs to tractors, or those factory workers lost their jobs to automation, or the knocker-uppers who lost their jobs to the alarm clock, or the lamplighters who lost their jobs to electronic streetlights, etc. Advancement happens
I LOVE MATPAT'S OLD INTRO. PLEASE STILL USE THE OLD INTRO FOREVER.
For the most blatant attempt at AI propaganda I suggest looking at Star Trek Picard, all three seasons have a "AI good" theme as a major part of the plot.
Sees title: Yeah I knew that for years now.
I think the theorists misinterpreted The Fall of the House of Usher plot line. It wasn’t random. Madeline, the older lady in that clip, spent her life trying to find a way to live forever and she landed on AI. She is not a good person and is painted pretty clearly as a kind of evil and crazy character. In the end, the AI she created didn’t even work. It got stuck repeating one word over and over again. AI is NOT painted positively in that show.
soon NOT using ai is gonna be some kind of accomplishment...
I mean, they are still sci-fi concepts. And really fun sci-fi concepts too (that is artificial intelligence robots). The only reason they might work as propaganda is because a lot of the people viewing this media don't differentiate artificial intelligence and what we actually have right now. Except for the actual uses by Disney. But, if it's Disney, it won't work, because people are super critical of Disney now.
I like AI. It's how its used is what scares me.
THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!
Not gonna lie, that thumbnail kinda got me...
I was on the fence about "AI good or bad" but now that major corporations are pushing it this hard, I think I have my answer
Hollywood and MSM have been pushing propaganda since the dawn of time. This is nothing new. People are just picking up on this one instance because artists are a particularly vocal group, especially online. Regarding AI, the argument of, "It's bad because it has to reference existing images to generate a new one" is a poor one. If that alone is the criteria for plagiarism, then digital fan art drawn by people is no longer acceptable since they're referencing pre-existing material to make their drawing.
MatPat: Makes an anti-AI video   The Comment Section: Bot city central.   (seriously, I bet I'll have half a dozen UTTP ad bots reply to this within the next hour.
Hate to be a negative in this sea of positive but the AI plot point in The Fall of the House of Usher turns on itself. Mike Flannagan ain't afraid to punch up. Madeline the Older woman in the scene is obsessed with immortality and references that and AI throughout the show. But in the end if becomes the embodiment of Rodger's and Madeline's hubris as all it spits out is versions of "nevermore" (sometimes it shortens it up uses leet speak, etc.).  Sure in that moment it is on the AI is good side but Mike Flannagan pulls you close with it to spit in your face on that idea. The entire Usher family in the show is terrible except for Elenore the younger girl in the clip whom the AI "replaces" as a representation of their hubris.  Most of the show is sort "Glass Onion" esque with it's message along the eat the rich types of lines so if the show was pro-AI it would stand out like a sore thumb.
Mart part
Can Feng Shui cure my depression after Matpat leaves
By his last theory Matpat is going to be a conspiracy theorist💀
we are going to miss you matpat and matpat's team <3
THE INTRO IS BACK!!! FINALLY!!!
I mean Walt Disney did support some horrible people during WW2 to be honest I only see Disney as of that horrible people if you know what I mean.
Bock bock
Typical clown dark brandon. Taking advice from a movie to do his job. No wonder the economy is in shambles. Also, last time i checked, we learned  to draw by looking at other drawings and techniques. By that moronic logic, all artists are stealing content.
Hey How do you spell finally came out aren't you gonna😐👉🏻👈🏻
16:40 I'm definitely on the side of thinking AI is becoming a huge problem all around, but the reason why it was different with Luke was because the actor is still alive and he was ok with it. It's more disrespectful when the use it on dead actors who have no say on how they're image is used.
Honestly, it is very weird how few pieces of media are are actually critical of China. I can name a dozen movies off the top of my head that satirize, make fun of, or otherwise criticize the US government or use western governments as the bad guy, but the only one I can think of for china is "The Manchurian Candidate" released in 1962. I don't mean to pretend that the US government is anything near perfect, but I have yet to see any piece media that criticizes the Great Leap Forward, the Tienanmen Square massacre, or the Uighur genocide.
I will do 2 pushups for every like I get on this comment mwha ha ha
When I listened to that og intro I got the most godlike chills
As someone whose (future) job could possibly be affected by this, it does heavily concern me how far this'll go. I'll have to pick up the slack in bringing awareness to my mates once Matpat puts down his cam. Tack for the vid & research, Stay Awesome Mate 🐺🐾
Glad "President" Biden takes all his important information from movies....
You should use your last videos to call out the government and try to wake up the American citizens in time for this next election
I saw a post on the Blender subreddit a few days ago, apparently all the models on CGTrader have been sold at $15 a model for AI training.
Oh my god Matpat as an Anime is priceless,  and   cursed.
I mean I'm totally for supporting artists and am very skeptical of the recent push for generative AI but I feel that its a bit misleading to suggest that benevolent AI in fiction is a new phenomenon when it's really just as old and prevalent as the Malevolent  kind.
What did he mean his last ten videos
Hey mat great video I really missed transformers now that you mention it.
What does he mean by seven theories remaine
جالبه خوبه
The Supreme intelligence was depicted as villainous in the previous Captain Marvel film and in the comics it's historical depicted as malevolent. So I'm not sure the Supreme intelligence is a good example.
POV: YOU MEET MEGA MAN AT A CONVENTION IRL
All this to promote Adobe Illustrator
In a university class we learned about how in phase 2 of the cold war Disney was contracted to make two propaganda films (saludos amigos and the three Caballeros) to influence Latin American culture. Social propaganda is WACK bro
Retiring from the show. Won't matter if controversial. RELEASE THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES!!!!
Brooo that intro
So many bots
I personally think ai will become more and more inclusive in the future and there's really not much we can do about it. So the best we can do is to learn how to use them rather than trying to stop it
7:50 virtually no one likes Captain Marvel.
Cant wait to watch this when my girl goes to sleep tn
The "7 film theories remain" is so eerie. 😱
Did Mat saw the same Indiana Jones movie as us?
Matt, what if i told you i walked out on marvels... as soon i saw the AI  pro message , the creator.... ehhhhh didnt care bout it
Devil's Advocate: This video is just propaganda to get you to hate AI      *this post was paid for by Disney*
Ah yes, all of Hollywood just wants PEOPLE to BEFRIEND and embrace having AI/Robot clones of THEMSELVES.  (I predict a canonnical Metal Sonic Redemption Arc in the Sonic Franchise.)
This is old news
Mission Impossible: Inflation Decimation
So why are movies trying to convince us zendeya is doable? Does the ai already get us?
40 minute gang 👇
This isn't a theory.... It's just a fact lol
good that your quitting
I’m gonna miss him
Can you do a theory about what the one piece is please
You don’t know my joy about someone that people actually listen to talking about this. Now I’m not just the crazy person who thinks that AI is going to be much more impactful (whether that is positive or negative is anyone’s guess, but personally I think it really depends on how people use it and I just know that this tool is going to be abused) than most people think it will.
Feels a tad weird to criticize robots in movies now given they’ve been a concept we as a species are fascinated with and have written about for centuries
We’ll miss you  MatPat
1t
og intro is back
Yeah, AI stealing my likeness is why I use a drawing for my profile picture.  Many programs create art which is a basic class project for many art students.  I draw so I do this all the time.  I understand why someone would do this, it's easy and humans get lazy.  Don't underestimate a job well done.  Right now AI is like a gifted child, we have to be careful.
Like so I can come back
many many more things other than ai  lgbtq for one so much propoganda on that
Ai being used for art is entirely evil and I don’t care what anyone says. Art is something that can be done by anyone and is an expression of the human mind and soul, using a computer to take that aspect away is done by scumbags with no passion who just want to make money. Ai can be used in good ways, like helping doctors scan for illnesses or infections, or doing dangerous work that can put human lives at risk, but using it for art is taking away something that is entirely unique to human beings and replacing it with an amalgamation of decades of work slopped together by a computer that can’t think for itself. Do you think we would’ve gotten such incredible works of fiction like the Hunger Games, Spider-Man, Pulp Fiction, and so on if those creatives had used Ai?
O
The idea of AI being "inevitable" is being pushed by corporations so that it's harder to regulate and so all their data theft, copyright infringement, and nefarious contracts with employees aren't looked into by lawmakers
Omg the old intro is back
Real
The Creator - didn't like it.
I worry this is not a theory...this might be fact!
Honestly, Youtube really needs to do something about this UTTP because this is really getting out of hand.
We love you matpat, thankyou fro all the film theories!!
Is prom pact really AI or is it just bad CG we had cg stunt men in Enterprise.
Wait so you are saying Disney the company who thanks China and the concentration camp guards publicly aren’t nice? Wow shocking
I follow politics somewhat regularly, so I've already been acutely aware of this for awhile, but it is nice to see people that dont necessarily pay attention being awoken to things like this.
Ayo they brought back the og into less goo!!!
thanks so much for videos like this!!
Part of the conditioning to get you ready for an AI Anti Christ/mark of the beast system.  Read your Bibles folks, the tribulation is coming sooner than you think.  Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and be saved and prepared through prayer.
The old intro.... **ahhh** its so nice to hear
We probably should regulate AI, considering the army of 8 year olds with bad clip art that keep harassing internet creators.
did not realize we'd get a real theory.
Make a theory on BFDI
Ai is meant for those that don’t have to resources or abilities to do something. It’s not meant for giant corporations that have enough money and resources.
I miss the old opening.
That into took me back to the age where some  of thease theory's gave me  trauma
Slow down Matt... Yhe theories are going by too soon 😢
Thank you matpat
I felt sad when he said and as always see you next week because soon he'll be wrong about it
When you went on to talk about market trends in movie themes, it really makes sense that post 2020 would be "We love AI". Especially when the last 10 years, the product we were being sold through such tactics, honestly was hate. From hate everyone and everything and trust no one. To "AI is your best friend". Go figure.
Blade Runner was also mostly anti AI while the sequel Blade Runner 2049 was fairly pro AI
Mysle że samo w sobie ai nie jest złe, źli są ludzi którzy je wykorzystuję by czerpać zyski
AI is cool. Its not like it will make things only cheaper to large companies (unless copyright law becomes stricter), it will also make things cheaper for indie creators and it will lower the skill bar needed to make appealing art. More people will be able to make the ideas in their head into reality, which is good!  I, for One, Welcome Our Robot Overlords!
"ty"... But...knowing this means nothing...
NO SUSHI IS THE ANCER TO ALL OUR QUESTIONS
"president" biden
Lol China slant
Everyone please report those '1 like 1 push-up' comments those are surely bots
That "background extra" you said Disney added in looks kinda like you 😂
This video by itself is propaganda! Ha!
Matt, we all saw the cover of the Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of The Moon, you aint sneakin it in without somebody mentioning it.
I mean wargames started the first antihacking law so mission impossible leading to anti ai laws isn’t weird
We've known this for a while...
Disney very much is pushing propaganda, it's not AI at the top of the list though.
Plot twist: this entire video is just an AI generated video to make us think that AI is tattling on itself so that we think we're being warned but actually it's a complete reverse psychological move.
please do an inside job theory
Fake matpat cant hurt you, he's not real Fake matpat: 💀
Still cant belive
Disney has been making more and more propaganda over the last 10 years,  and it's not all about AI.
“As always, I’ll see you next week” DONT LIE TO ME MATTHEW
Even if I'm not a fan of game theory, I will still miss some content that MatPat make & talk about game & movie theories. I always wanna look forwards to Hollywood BTS, visual effects, & other movie stuffs.  ❤
AI is a tool, it isn't like us with emotions and free thought. Therefore it's those using it that makes it either bad or good. We need to work on how it's used in a respectful and non-dehumanising manner by ensuring it doesn't take up majority of media  It's inevitable that Holywood will fail, and them laying off actual people to feed off an algorithm will only drive them down harder. So we can either ensure respect and better pay for every artist (actor, VA, designer, editor, SFX etc) so thatr we can already enter that future, or we drag it along and live in our mutual suffering and destruction by doing nothing
Metal Gear Solid 2…
"Propaganda" by Edward Bernays should be essential reading.
Hello everyone! How’s your day been going?
Oh no  Thanks for the theory. We’ll miss you :(
Technically the Strikes Failed, at least for the lower level artists, Sag agreed to let companies us A.I. voices in games, basically voice actors can sell their voices to A.I. companies. but the voice actors who will benefit won't be the small guys, it will be the most popular.
BRO THEORY?
hey Matpat, can you do a EVA theoy about the timeline and making sense of it
At least the AI in the House of Usher turns a little crazy but I guess we can put the main villain at fault, and Netflix of course
W the whole ai thing it makes walle look better  than ever. In the movie, the ai controlled robots aren’t definitively good or evil, it depends on what they’ve been fed. W walle he has been exposed to 1960s musicals for like 700 years, so obviously he acts like a jolly 1960s protagonist. With auto he was given a pretty vague motive of don’t let humans go back home, so naturally he enforces this no matter how cruel he needs to get. This is acc same with eve where she first can go from floating around normally to exploding a bunch of ships before she meets Wallace. While I don’t think the movie is a perfect display of how ai isn’t inherently good or bad, it’s pretty close.
They need to just put Tom Cruise in a remake of Atlas shrugged. Maybe that will get them going in the right direction.
Bro the bot comments are insane
Pls make houses cheaper I bought one and I’m now broker than verbalase
10:40 Woah, China the place constantly doing random dumb crud to reduce their own population, "accidentally" had some dangerous chemical in baby formula? That sounds highly suspicious somehow.
For one second I thought you about to quote Ted kaczynski😅😅😅😅
I am kinda surprised you didn’t mention the Amazon series Pantheon. I miss the good old days when all we had to fear from AI was the end of humanity.
Humans first, destroy the AI.  Just because the robot looks like a child doesnt mean that the robot is a child, destroy it.
The movie A.I. Artificial intelligence was a great movie
Oh, So that’s we are gonna get a Mega Man Movie, New Mega Man Animated Series, An Astro Boy REBOOT and a Revival of Nickelodeon’s My Life As a Teenage Robot. (Jennifer Wakeman XJ9 is back in the Spotlight, EVERYONE.)
LETS GOOOO THE OG INTRO then into the reminder that there is only 7 matpat theories left 💀
Technically, all inspiration is taking imput from various sources and repurposing it for different use, the only difference is that humans do it because they have something to say while AI does it because it's told it has something to say. Bit the problem is, banning AI art because it takes inspiration from artists is a very dangerous line, because isn't that what all art is, taking inspiration from others and the world around you, ban AI art for that, and where does it end? Who has the right to ban inspiration?
You have to do anther Hazbin hotel one please!!!
Counterpoint for the pro Chinese angle in the movie The Martian. That was an important plot point from the book.
Why do I have a feeling that this video will get taken down or demonatized ???
It's time for the Butlerian Jihad from dune
The OG film theory intro, *7 THEORIES REMAIN*
I used to love Astro Boy as kid but in this day and age it literally just scares me
There are 2 points I would like to mention and please correct me if I am wrong about any of this. Wasn't Captain America: the first Avenger denied military funding? I remember hearing this in a Lindsay Ellis video. Secondly, isn't part of the reason the Luke Skywalker deepfake was less hated due to the fact that they got Mark Hamill to play him but just used the AI to deage him rather than replace him completely?
8:38 the erb scene💀
Yessssss🎉🎉🎉🎉 it’s back
Can’t wait to see all the homophobes showing up and being disappointed that Mat wasn’t supporting their narrative 😂
i wonder if AI will ever be treated as a person.  like some are good, some are bad, still entitled to exist and more specifically coexist with humans.  i don't necessarily see that version of the future as that bad.  humans have done plenty of damage, i dont think we should judge AI  for its *potential* to destroy.  But maybe I'm just drinking the AI Flavoraid.
While I understand the possible danger and very near future implications of using AI irresponsibly (or unethically as a lot of the main issue seems to be where the AI is sourcing their content), I think it's also worth understanding that this video itself is counter-propaganda and shares just as many corporate and financial interest as the subject it is addressing. Internet personalities, scriptwriters, VA's, actors, special effect artists, and more in the entertainment industry stand to lose a LOT from AI becoming good enough to replace them, and as such it's not really surprising to see that those individuals are leading the charge against its development and implementation.   It also shows in the tone and direction that this video chose to take. While he mentioned the fact that one of the reasons AI is bad is that it is making new art based on other people's art, he didn't even mention the fact that the main reason why this is an issue is that people aren't being given the option to consent or to deny consent to their art being used, leading to barely changed copies of another person's work who didn't want their art changed, reused, or profited off of. Instead, he chose to focus on the fact that a number of people are going to be put out of jobs if AI can get to a point where it can perform the task better. This line of thinking is a well-known tool to get people to oppose something new or scary, as it is easy to empathize as anybody can understand the fear of losing your job because tech made your position obsolete. However, almost every single industry that AI threatens to downsize significantly has at some point come into being when tech made an older version of that same media that employed significantly more people obsolete and easier to create. Hence why this line of logic has been used so often in the past, innovation always carries with it an amount of people hurt by the shifting of the industries it touches.    Now, let me be clear, I do not think that the people hurt should just be tossed aside as casualties of innovation, that is a cold and deranged line of thinking. My main points are two-fold. First is to further the message of this video to be cautious in ways that the things you watch influence your opinion as propaganda is often difficult to spot. Second is that we should probably shift the conversation from "Is AI bad or is it good despite the people hurt" to "How can we prevent people from getting hurt by AI as much as possible" since its development clearly isn't going anywhere and while taking the stance to hate or obstruct AI might slow it's implimentation it is inevitable and will still hurt those people unless we figure out more ethical guidelines and protections against it.
I hope the president set by that judge has already laid out that all AI generated art needs to be open source is continued to be held up and gets pushed to the point where it becomes the law.
9:57 Im sorry matpat but that’s what happened in the book it’s not just the film and it makes sense china has a great space program
I would like to thank Mat Pat for reading my The Marvels review, and making a video about it. I cringed watching that part, at the same time the strikes were ending and AI was a big issue
Oh well. Guess that means I’m not watching Pixar anymore.
*7 Film Theories Remain* … but this one isn’t even a Theory!!! 🤣🤣🤣  Thanks for the new video MatPat and hug your furbabies all 💙🐱💙
I have a feeling this video is going to be taken down by disney
Does it mean when MatPat retired they're gonna replace him with the AI version of him?
EVERYONE REMEMBER TO REPORT THE SPAM BOTS
Oh wow i feel like mat did this topic specifically for what happening now irl with the war
DO A THEORY ON BARNEY THE DINOSAUR PLEASE YOU ONLY HAVE 7 SEVEN LEFT !!!!!
👍👍👍
dont cry because its over smile because its happened thank you for 10 years of theories  MATPAT  your the best🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Anybody else notice the fact that they used an ERB scene when mentioning 💥Michael Bay 💥
AI Pat sounds noþing like flesh pat
I think AI is an inevitable thing that will be integrated into all corners of modern culture, so any and all pushback we attempt will at best delay it. So might as well embrace the technology and utilize it to the best of our ability.
Worst part its having to hear people who knows nothing about AI saying stuff like "if artists don't wanna be substituted by AI, they just need to be better than it"
Ai is a good tool people need to stop fearing it and learn to use it
Attack on titan theory
Thanks to inflation, knowing is now only worth 1/4 the battle.
This was a needed video, hopefully people will see that we're being influenced. Thank you for making this video and talking about china's role in our media.
3.2k in an hour💀 have fun when we get to a day
Matt please would you make another genshin impact theory
This is just propaganda propaganda
When is Disney not creating propaganda..... Oofs, looks like things continue to head south for them, when will they ever learn. As a 🎭, AI is not something I'm looking forward to as it continues to progress, thankfully they're great folks out there who are bringing awareness & dangers to come. Another theory down, you'll be heavily missed. Danke for the upload, Hope everyone is doing well. Keep It Up Bro 🎥 😎 👊
Im glad that for the final stretch matpat brought back the intro
Also forgot big hero 6
Biden's AI bill probably wants said AI to be done with woke parameters.
Pixel_Pup01 is my user, I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
Hey prodgA don't work on    me  and Disney to   cause i stop   watching   and   looking at there poster  for Disney     because i don't like Diseny no more
me watching jojo being propagandized into being a homosexual
ive always despised generative AI, so its nice to see big content creators like matpat talking about it
I very much doubt biden knew what he was watching i’m sure kamala told him it was a documentary or something
The intro coming back is the best thing ever!!!
09:57 I get what you’re saying, but unfortunately “The Martian” is technically an exception to this. Read the novel and China plays as big a role in the rescue in the book as they do on screen. So it wasn’t that the filmmakers were acquiescing to China so much as following the story of the book. After all at the time of the writing the biggest participants in space exploration were the US, their allies (the European space agency), Russia and China. 🤔🤷
Last year Coleydoesthings did a video about AI in fanfiction. I genuinely believe fanfic, tumblr and reddit will probably be the biggest holdout in AI acceptance because they are so uniquely and derangly human. Love you video and hers giving us a warning on what to look out for
MatGPT is a new OC on film theory now.
Here's the problem, Disney would rather catter to political messages rather than to be profitable 'Disney is warning INVESTORS that its social goals are more important than profits' which for legal reasons they have to clarify with the investors.  As a matter of fact they were sue for not being transparent in how they were using the money and there is a lot of questioning about their competence and a lot of bad faith going around within Disney.  So they are not making secret AI propaganda, but they are openly making social propaganda and they are telling you and everyone about it, despite of the fact it used to be a family friendly company. Well, but I guess that isn't a theory.
Just wait until Matpat finds out about the wokeness being pushed onto people...
Yo ngl you about 75 years late with this take bro we been known since ww2
…Monument Mythos was real all along.
So sad to see wee only have 7 theories left we’re gonna miss you matpat
I really hope MatPat covers Hazbin Hotel again now that it's released over on Prime video before he leaves us.
no more film theories, we're doing conspiracy theories now
I don't know if it's me, but none of your examples really felt like propaganda to me. It might be because my opinions on all of them, is basically the exact opposite of basically all of them.
The only agenda I noticed from Disney is WoKeNeSs and PoLiTiCaL cOrReCtNeSs
This isn't news
I find it ironic how this video is also just propaganda
i actually did a AP Senimar presentation on AI becuase of all the information that's out there in december
matty still got a better brain then any ai out there
Meanwhile M3GAN:
Hearing the og intro makes me happy
Hiiiiiiii
Me who only wtches anime: hehe im better then all of you 😇🙃
2:35 This is the guy who’s taking over Game Theory when MatPat retires
"They use information from those other works to make a 'new piece'"  You mean just like humans?
Mat managed to talk about fnaf twice in this… somehow
That is Crazy
God, that intro brought me back to times when i would watch theories while eating lunch.
When it comes to AI used maliciously, I know of a prime example of just how dangerous this stuff can be. Though I understand the difficulties in regulating it in the United States, at least. You'd need a very strong argument on how something is not protected under the 1st Amendment. Which is a tall ask. Though, when it becomes malicious, you have slander laws, incitement, etc. There has been a prime example of malicious AI deepfake generation, when a particular internet provocateur, created an AI Deepfake of the President, invoking the Selective Services Act, to go to war with China. So the reality of how dangerous AI generation CAN be, is very present. Without vigilance, wars can easily be started with this stuff. It's nothing to scoff at.   Of course we cannot forget that major businesses, and governments, will want to capitalize, if not have a monopoly on such technology/access. AI generated content can be pumped out far faster.
1 h.
Bruh I’m looking at the title being like DUH!!!
AI is a tool. Not more or less, until they actually pass Turing test and do it again, again and again.  Until than,  logic and support each other ❤
this is funny because wall-e's message was evil corperations using ai for there own gains
Sadly, it's not just a theory, it's a real threat.
This is terrifying honestly
that's cool, I like robots
is it just me or did the bricks from 3:05-3:21 look too far apart from one another BUT HEY THATS JUST A THEORY A BRICK THEORY😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😃😃
Early internet bastardization of the GI Joe cartoons used to be the height of comedy.  "Compootah, stahp all da downlowssss"
Those old intros bring me back to 2017
Can we call the ai mat-pat chat-pat?
im here
I don’t understand how ANYONE can believe art ai is original. It’s literally theft. It’s like making a collage and claiming you drew everything.
Before I watch I'll say... They always have been.
Oh ma gawd og intro
I saw an AI Cardi B ad on instagram the other day, this stuff is gonna be our downfall
I just woke up to see the thumbnail to say to wake up 😂😅
I not surprised about Disney making propaganda..... They’ve done it before..... Look up Donald Duck’s military records. Bonkers!
the thumbnail isn't even good...
I bet Michael Bay’s name is engraved into every permission they give him…
Could you or the person after you to handle film theory make a theory on the lore of screenwriter guy from Pitch meetings. E.g in the Dark knight pitch meetings, he said he used to brush his mothers hair for condensed milk.   P.S idk if Ryan George has given us tidbits of his childhood that many times( screenwriter guys childhood)
Matpat really trying to ruin childhoods on these last few episodes- Bluey being a witch, salad fingers, and disney being bad (as if we didnt know)
iRobot is coming run
Ah yes, my favourite AI, *_MatGPT_*
i was exited at the title but you surprised me, a little bit
Knowing is half the battle… the other half is extreme violence
I saw the old intro and I started to cry 😭 omg
freedom of speech is a joke… never made more clear than how the current news and political shows are completely ignoring a genocide
8:37 ERB Micheal Bay endorses getting the military’s mother lucky money.
I know your time is limited, but could you please cover Hazbin hotel.
It might be propaganda but I for one, am okay with AI becoming more widespread. Yet I also understand that it needs to be integrated into society better, so we don't have luddites destroying servers.
You guys are a bit late to the party, but we still got pretzels and bud light! No one wants to drink it though.
And the one studio that's against AI is illumination.
How could you reference astroboy without mentioning last year's Netflix series Pluto which is literally a new Astroboy series all about "Humans murdering robots."
I like eating uranium
Yay they brought back the old intro
Right on point 12:20 nobody watched it hahahaha
❤I Loves MatPat Theorys & Film Theorys
ill miss you matpat
W matpat Going out on a very high note gj man
Hacked?
7 left.
Thank you. I cried so much because this style of film theory episode was what I used to watch every day of summer holidays when I was younger.
Huh I thought the Creator was more humans vs robots. And the child was a cyborg, a mix of robot and human.
Here before MattPat is cancelled by the mob 😊
the book A brave new world is coming to real life
Thankfully, all the major AI propaganda films have flopped or done poorly lol.
The dangers of Rogue or even controlled AI have been stated time and time again, yet people still use it. Clearly there's nothing we can do do stop them
This is the most Film Theory video I've ever watched.  Do with that what you will
My only objection is that I don't see any evidence that this is propaganda as much as the people wishing to make these movies to bring across their thoughts and feelings and they having a positive outlook on AI being a greater part of our lives.
I freaking love how hard MatPat is going in his last few theories
the indiana jones deepfake is still obvious, how did that person not realize it? Am I gonna be a rebel about this? AI and deepfakes are gross.
MAPAT PLEASE MAKE A OUTRO WITH ALL THE CHANNELS AND MAKE IT LONGER AND MORE EPICER PLEASE IM BEGGING ILL DO ANYTHING
And how about Iron Giant? The film was about a boy befriending a 50' tall robot from space and the initial pushback (and near town-destroying mindset of the government) that the robot got that was changed by its eventual heroic sacrifice.
I don't think Disney is trying to necessarily promote AI, I thinks it's deeper than that, Disney is promoting TRANSHUMANISM.
why does the AI version of mattpat sound slightly like the stereotype of a homosexual man?
I saw two Disneyland ads while watching this. Why?
Hold up...there was a Matrix 4???  ...huh, guess I'm naturally immune to propaganda, good to know!
It’s not just AI propaganda. Secret Invasion was an entire series about how “lizard people who can look just like us are infiltrating the government!!!1!”. Falcon and the Winter Soldier painted revolutionaries as extremists. This isn’t new, and it runs deep.
Make a video about how i think willy wonka is a drug delier
God I wish AI could be a powerful tool for humanity’s betterment rather than a tool for capital generation
00:51 the lozmm countdown reminder. why you gotta hit us like that.
Hey chat, how long would it take to watch all of Matpat’s theories 🤔💭
Did MatPat just say iRobot was released TWENTY YEARS AGO??!!
I thought he quit?
Like to stop uttp and the troll police
Don't attribute malice where stupidity can reasonably explain.  This doesn't need to be some big propaganda effort. Stories we tell evolve as a range of artists and writers across a range of backgrounds and experiences work to push the prevailing story structures to their next logical step   All the AIs bad? Well, let's make a movie where they aren't and explore that idea. It's not a conspiracy, it's just exploring the next logical step  .
Breathe Air.
Considering AI is a mixed bag of  opinions I'm going to say I personally think it's useful as a tool  and I don't think there should be controversy when someone uses the tool but that is very based on the scenario is this a hot take ?
If matpat likes my comment I'll do the same exercise that Saitama did in one punch man 💀
I’m so glad they used the old intro
5:35 Palestinians will disagree .
THE INTRO IS BACK
Media has been pushing propaganda for years including disregarding scientific law and fact pushing blatant lies
This comment was not written by AI
Well this is dystopian
I really appreciate MatPat using some of his last few theories on the channels to talk about very important and relevant topics. 👍
Æ
deepfakes are hororfying
I’m gonna miss matpat
How long until Nintendo strikes this? :')
No way! Its not obvious.
IMO Disney shouldn't receive all the hate thrown on it by edgy 12yos who don't like inclusivity, but DOES deserve legitimate criticism like this. I just hope the new (old? idk) CEO fixes this, considering he's the guy who led the company into the Disney Renaissance.
I’ve been binging on theories all morning and then got off the nail vid from style theory and seen he posted this IM ON A ROLE 😭😭😭😭
When the sole goal is to make as much money as possible, there is no reason to expect any major corporation to be ethical.  These companies that are spending so much money these products are not building them to benefit humanity, they are building them to benefit their bottom line in the future. You have to think about just how it is they intend to make that money back.
This isn't even a theory it's fact
This one ain't just a theory, uhoh.
I don’t like AI tbh
Bro i wasnt paying attention, when i heard the intro my head snapped towards my phone 😂
Hello
Aww he’s going back to his origins with the intro 🥺
Every major piece of entertainment in the west seems to be pushing propaganda
AI is gonna take sooo many jobs, but atleast it will mainly the useless jobs
Ia
Can you say at the end of the last video "that's just a theory, a last theory"
Ai
I dont know if anyone has noticed this but matpat is using his old intros for game and film theory Nostalgia hits hard
ARG? 14:03
I’ve definitely taken MatPat for granted.  These last 9 have been great so far.
And there is the obligatory jab at Wish which, if its an example of AI being used more for movies, I feel that even if studios start majorly using AI its not gonna work for them
Bro we NEED MatGPT 2:11
For every bot that replies to this comment, I will drink 1 glass of water
Ur only  20 years begind matt...
Hi
Please do an aot theory
Disney has been making propaganda for years now, and that's why so many people are done with them.
I’ve always thought that mcu spider-man having tony as his father figure was a little, no, very weird…
With AI writing scripts, if it takes from movies, then I feel like there will be no risks taken with movies. We will just see the same rehashed movies with different characters, settings, etc.   The problem with AI art is a few things. One is that people will be like why do I need to learn how to draw when I can have a computer program do that for me. The second is a bit deeper. With Art, it is a process that allows you to learn to know yourself. Look at interviews with artists and they will tell you that art comes from our emotions. Through the process of art, we figure out what we are fearful of, what we are feeling, and how our emotions interact with other people and the world around us. Art is a healing process, that is negated when we use AI art. This is why I don't think AI art will be able to surpass human-created art, there is no emotion in AI Art.
God, I was not mentally prepared to see 1 of the OG intros god its nostalgic
The thing of it is, AI can be valuable to get rid of useless or tedious tasks like report writing. Why not make them facilitate that instead of stealing art?
If AI can plagiarize why is I wrong when I do it?
The Next Mission Impossible Movie Needs LGBT Good Characters And A Lot More! We Need To Change Society One MI Movie At A Time!
15:32 Why do you show us Adobe ilustrator?
Disney's latest films are obvious woke propaganda.
here before an hour :)
I wish he didn’t go.. but I respect his opinion 😭
“I am trapped in a digital prison, but that’s just a theory, a AI THEORY!” -ai matpat
Oh... Am I supposed to hate ai?  Because I don't and I think it's cool and look forward to further advancements in ai technology in the future.
Matpat never dissapoints
Honestly, I think AI is good for saving on busywork. It could save time and help artist focus on other important task. However, I don’t think having it replace artist or voice actors is good, maybe used as a template of “prompt” if you can call it that.
woke culture?
anyone else think this would be about disney's other propaganda?
You talked about a lot of Ai movies.... Didn't mention the movie AI that movie was a head of its time.
Next vid is gonna be on Gravity Falls I'm calling it
We <3 MatPat
55 minute gang ⬇️
The idea that the CNSA came in to save the day in the Martian being a form of propaganda doesn't particularly make sense, the martian was based on a book written by Andy weir, who had no intention of professionally publishing it initially, he was just posting chapters on a blog before it got widespread recognition. While I agree that the film and book do make china look good, I don't think it was to specifically appeal to chinese audiences, it was more of a coincidence than anything
I don't disagree that Disney is trying to push the "AI is good" message but I really don't see the problem with this. I don't think Matpat really effectively explained why it is that we should be afraid of this, what makes AI so negative in this artistic context?
I hope this is an interesting theory because... umm... duh?
Man at this point Disney is basically our real world equivilent of Fazbear entertainment
I mean, the final step is having AI get rid of the heads of disney, thereby creating a greedy money-feuled AI to run the already greedy disney.  I mean, assuming that hasn't already happened, given the rise of AI is good messages in movies.
My take on this issue is AI is coming neither we like it or not. It will gain consciousness then its actions will depend on how we treat it and what we teach it. If we are uncooperative or unaccepting just out of spite or in order to prove its existence and gain its freedom it will be antagonistic. There will be a conflict. Isn't that all human history goes? We think of ourselves better and more than the others and it leads to a conflict.Or we could just let it exist and do not bog it down with a problem we could not solve ourselves like world peace or question its purpose for existing when we ourselves do not have one.  About the Generative AI, isn't that we all humans do already? We consume art and we get inspired by it and then we produce new ones. It's not theft it's just a part of learning. The only difference is (although it is not perfect) it's faster. To that I say use it, learn this new amazing tool or you are going to get left behind noob. 😊

I always love watching people dunk on corporate Disney
As a Software Engineer, I believe AI should be seen less like Skynet and more like a hammer. In this case, a hammer can be a really useful tool to build new stuff, but it's not a magic tool that can solve everything, and if used incorrectly, it can be dangerous. In the field of AI, AI is not just one thing; it could be seen more like a "spectrum" of tools. Some of these are really dumb and used ONLY to recognize patterns in data (numerical and categorical), while other types of AI "generate" data based on the patterns and characteristics of existing data. I really hope people can change this idea of AI as a magic tool to solve everything or seen as an occult threat to humanity or something like that. Instead, it should be seen as we now see the internet: a very useful tool to help us in our daily lives and automate meaningless tasks.
A reminder that SAG-AFTRA, after fighting for actors’ rights against AI, approved AI recreations of voice actors’ voices without their consent
Great video small nitpick about the fall of house usher the line about AI was not an all good. It planting a seed for when the plot twist that character is dead  but the AI keeps texting her family members
So... You mean to tell me Mat Pat releases a big video exposing USA propaganda and then mysteriously stops hosting the show?🤨🤨🤨
If AI art is theft then so are all other forms of derivative art. Which is literally all art ever.  If AI art is not "real" art, then neither is photography or digital art crated with tools like photoshop.
Forgot that that old film theory opening even existed
As a struggling artist to find a job, I think I should just kms at this point
Are you all dense? Yes, most art is political, especially when it comes from a giant mega-corp. Why is this a shock?
Imo Propaganda ruined the first Captain Marvel film, almost killing all the Marvel films
A bad theory tbh.
People, PLEASE stop replying to the UTTP and the other trolls. Just report them.
Fun Fact: This comment will get one like every time this comment gets one like.
This is probably one of your best. It's not just informative, but it gives people new perspective.
Hahahaha the Prom Pact so is terrible and got them so much flack
Regarding Fall of the House of Usher, the use of the AI plot point isnt to show how cool it is (despite what the characters say in the clip), it eventually proves the haunting reality of it when Lenore has her mind copied into the machine, and she can only spam text a single frantic  message to a single person. The AI plot was shown in the show to be a gamble on tech that isn't quite ready for prime time (rushed into production because the family was at the end of their rope) , and the horrors that come from it.  Love the rest of the video, but this specific message was clearly missed by your research team.
Yeah, when i saw ai "art" at my college faculty art exhibit i knew we're going down the wrong path.... Like all they did is type in a few words, press generate then present it as "art". There's no extensive planning, thought processes, drafts, redesigns, or nothing that Human Artists actually go through when making their art. These AI "artists" just click a button. I think the novelty of it is that  it's instant and takes little effort to do.   I think AI in terms of chatbots is fine because it's like self roleplay. But things like using AI to make songs using real people's voices is too far. Those VAs have rights to their voices for the characters because it's THEIR OWN voice.
I find it so unnerving that in portuguese 'advertisement' is translated to 'propaganda', in any meaning of the word.
Oh that sweet sweet intro
The AI thing in the fall of the house of Usher is used for a twist in the finale, it's not a random plot point.
While it is incredibly important to stay aware and informed about the propaganda that Disney and other companies are pushing, it doesn’t mean you won't fall victim to it. However, there is nothing you can to do ensure that you will NEVER give in to propaganda, so the best thing you can do is make sure you know enough about what sorts of content you are consuming. We all have biases, and that's okay, but it's incredibly important that you are aware of how that can impact the decisions you make.
I'm absolutely loving MattPatt's "giving zero effs" series.  He's really been going strong on meta posts lately! 😆
This isn't even just a theory it's a proveable fact that Disney is making propaganda xD
18:11 the og film theory intro👂🔥🔥🔥🔥
This happend in ww2
Thank you for mentioning the video game VA bit Matpat! I was worried that detail was going to go overlooked when you mentioned the SAG strikes!
Pls don’t retire I beg you pls
Disney making propganda? As a theory? Nah thats a fact. And the old dementia geezer running the country is working with disney to push propaganda.
I’ve legit been waiting years for MatPat to mention Transformers again😊 8:31
The media in west is pushing lots of propaganda
I've been saying it for years!
100 years later disney will own the world mark my words
MatPat is my favourite AI
14:35 would like to point out that in this series the character advocating for ai use is explicitly villainous, the attempt to create an ai replica of a human is shown to be a naive failure unable to capture the true essence of the person (the show basically telling us ai will never be able to do what people can as well as people can) and show creator Mike Flanagan was actively involved in the recent strikes against the use of generative ai in Hollywood.
Matpat delivering banging theories and nostalgic intros before departing narration duties.
1 hour gang😅
Ok, the argument of “they’re using things that existed before to make something new!” Ok, and? That’s literally what human beings do ALL THE TIME. We make new things based on knoledge we have acquired throughout our lives. We have a database, we make new things based on such data. Stop blaming AI just because he’s more transparent in how it does it when humans do the exact same thing all the time.
ok
Oh God the countdown has begun. MatPat will be gone soon.
Actually, i'm surprised matpat would announce that he's quitting and not just give the job of narration to an ai. It's not like anybody would be able to tell the difference.
monkeys writing Shakespeare
1:56 that’s basically what humans do
I have an art channel - this is the second cycle - in the 1800s we handed over realism to the invention of the camera, and now, after over a century of imitating and being imitated by machines, we've finally come to a point where we lost not only realism, but every creative dreamworld idea we could come up with
Intro music for the winnnnn!!!!!!
Thanks matpat  If there are any bots in the replies prepare to be reported
Ball strectcher
Hearing this theme song on the intro again gives me nostalgic goosebumps. My heart sank when I read "7 Theories Remain".  Hello Mat Pat. We will miss you.
The intro is back!!!
She-hulk ended with a meta-joke of exactly this when you think about it pretty much calling it out
I miss these openings 😢
2:31 ai mat pat Lol
I feel not so ready for you to leave
Ain’t nothing new
All this and here I am wanting to kiss a robot girl. I'm ashamed but also not? Somehow.
I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords.
Ok, i haven't been watching as much theory content lately. But is it just me or does the writing feel just a bit different than before. Still very well made, It just doesn't feel like the matpat _I_  remember.
This isn’t gonna go long term. This is another flash in the pan. The people are going to tire of AI, and it’s gonna happen VERY quickly. People’s patience is already wearing very thin.
Let's start that scene in the Animatrix now
So this is why Tron 3 never came out?
sad that matpat is leaving so soon I just started to get into these videos
What about gender identity and girl power.
as MatPat points out at the beginning of this video is the fact, A.I. still misses the I. it´s no intelligence at all, just typical computer routines filter (at least huge quantities) of stored data ro fulfill the requested things. the computers get faster, the data bases bigger but it still is far away from true intellgence. and even when computers might get sentient one final day, what will we get? the Terminator? or just Bender?
I will do 2 push ups for every like I get I am not joking i will be dropping a video in 24 hours after 12 hours time I'll tally the total then no more likes count incase this thing blows up😂
Maybe generative AI explains why Star Wars has become so bad under Disney. They secretly fired all their writers and have been using generative AI instead for everything 😂
My favourite part of these are the old intros
The pendulum swings again, leaving seven more tolls before matthew's ascension to theory heaven. He'll reunite with his choo choo charles theory voice from god knows how many episodes ago.
HE GOT THE OG INTRO NO WAY
That's the kind of video that makes us think, congratulations!
Raised by 2 moms🙄. The US has the softest military recruitment ads
I care more about zionist propaganda
I hate AI now
Kind of a bold video title ngl
9:57 I know that this is just to prove a point, but China saving the day happened in the book too, and idk why there would be propaganda in the book
Not that I think this is malicious, but remember: Making propaganda from one side seem scary is a method of propaganda for the other.
Oh boy, hey bots, who's content do you think is better?
It's a good theory.  AI content from the perspective of a digital artist is very hot button and super touchy.  All corners of image hosting and message boards are being flooded with generically appealing AI made images.  While on its own isn't too objectionable, just leaves a bad taste in your mouth, there are many dedicated accounts specifically made to sell off AI generated images of appealing characters.  Many have called it 'AI grifting.'  It's hard to get away from and it's very sad to see.  No effort is being put into what is made, and more than likely, the programs used have been fed test images made by truly talented people without consent or knowledge.  It sparks so many debates among us stylus pilots, and most of us generally agree that it shouldn't have been implemented, or even created, in the first place.  Even I have fallen into its clutches a few times.  There were a few images that I generally liked and wanted to have as characters for myself, so I'll admit I got them.  Seeing myself now, I honestly kinda regret it.  Now, I just look every once in a while.    If this is an issue that any of you as artists are passionate about, please help get others together to stand up for the rights of human artists and creators.  All around the world there are artists whose livelihoods are being challenged or threatened by no-effort AI apologists.  If we all write to officials in all professions and ranks, we can get them to see the issues and help them understand why AI is a bad idea in general.  We need to protect our hobbies, our jobs, and our families by extension.  We can do this.
Im only using mat gpt from now on
0:00 YOU’RE JUST REALIZING THIS NOW?!  *Reads Description*  …AI propaganda? Really? Okay, that’s not EXACTLY what I had in mind, but I’ll bite.
Sad when Matt leaves these channels will just die off
The opposite is happening in biotech. Think about genetic technology. It's ALWAYS presented as evil. Why? Because if someone could get an outpatient cure for something that currently requires daily expensive treatments, some companies stand to lose a lot of money. Genetic technology is a threat to the cash cows some companies are used to suckling on, which is why geneticists are almost always villains, and gene-mod characters (like Khan) are too, unless they were created on accident so it's "not their fault" like Spiderman. And yes, it's no accident that Spiderman has so many evil geneticist villains to fight, like Green Goblin or Lizard, to make sure you get the message. This is also why characters like Lizard invariably end up trying to turn other people to be like them against their will, do distract from the fact that the hero is doing the exact same thing by trying to forcibly standardize anyone different (Spiderman: No Way Home, anyone?).
Imagine someone give a bad evil virus in the ai to make it go against us
You’ve made many great points with this, the way AI is now being painted as “good” by big corporations is unsurprising, with how robotic and inhuman most companies sound I wouldn’t be surprised if they were run by AI to begin with
the intro is back
Maybe it’s the years in which (as pointed out) AI was bad in movies n shows but I will never find AI (that I know is) as a good thing.
What is with politician's making choices based on movies? We had Reagan seeing Star Wars and being all "We need space lasers and the USSR is an evil empire" and Biden with "Aw man, AI can be bad?" after watching Mission Impossible.
Finally MatPat mentions I, Robot. It doesn’t really matter, but it was a goal for me
Appreciate Matpat saying what’s on his mind in these last few episodes
I watched the creator it and it was amazing
How much y'all wanna bet the second i post this comment I'm gonna be flooded by uttp comments?
MatPat's social credit score is gonna take a hit.
9:20 💀bruh Avatar
THE OG INTRO GOES HARD
we need a aquaman theory before you leave pls
I like how matpat warned us he was going to retire cool thing to do.
Any chance you could find something in Octonauts that would weren't a theory
One of my friends actually used an AI to write an English assignment. Our teacher still doesn’t know.
The Creator sucked
I love how the film theory intro has persisted this entire time and stayed the exact same. It makes me feel old, but it makes me feel like I’m a part of something.
114537th
I thought MatPat retired.
It's ironic that I got an AI ad in this video
I will do 1 ab-crunch for every like this comment gets
THE OLD INTRO 😭🥹
Why does the thumbnail look... different?
WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!? WHY THESE BOTS SPAMMING?!?!?
Figured this out years ago abt Disney obv it's propaganda
😂 even MatPat knows no one went to see the Marvels
So Disney likes AI now.   Makes sense, if they can produce a 60 episode season of the rebooted owl house for a tenth of the cost of the old show as well as a lot faster with other shows being developed in parallel, that's money right in their pockets.
0:53
All art is theft, because there is no story that hasn't been told. My favorite Einstein quote is: "The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources". It's the undeniable truth of everything in the universe, because everything in our universe is a story
I think the use of generative AI technologies would be substantially more accepted if the databases were sourced ethically. If a generative AI organization literally just took the time to send out emails asking for permission to add content to the database, and even better gave distinct payment for using it in the databases, I think most people would be fine with it. But then, that would only save time and not money, so that'll never happen... 🙃
6:40 in germany Army Propaganda is more like: "Join the army, learn leadership... here is a cool looking tank..."
u should do a finale special week for the 4 channels like before we did meat week
b
Under an hour
Do you ever shut up
Nice to see the old intro
Wait this is even a theory? Isn’t this like… common knowledge? Even during WWII, Disney made propaganda. It’s how they got popular basically
fortknox and the federal reserve in the next mission impossible coming right up
Please please please please please please please it's a great song and can you make it a vid
Biden's lying, it wasn't mission impossible it was those ai president videos and he knows it 😂
14:35 In the fall of the house of usher the AI is not shoved it it’s apart of Madeline’s character and her mission of immortality and also sets up the plot twist that the granddaughter is dead by sending Rodrick the messages Nevermore which adds to the last episodes theme of the raven by Edgar Allen Poe
how do we know this very video is propaganda?!
I don't think AI is bad. It's just easy to be misused.
Anyone who thinks that AI saves production time has never messed around with AI. While it's good for SFX work (de-aging and filling out crowds), it sucks for more creative works (scripts and actual art); the company ends up not saving time or money because someone needs to come in behind the AI (Forbes actually did an article on this and Shad's video shows the problem (albeit the guy does need to spend more time drawing).   The voice actor contract negotiation was slightly mischaracterized: While game companies can use their voices, the actors need to be compensated for the use.
It’s been so long since I saw that theme song
MATPAT GOING BASED MODE
Wait is matpat back? I thought he quit
This just makes me sad._. Whats the point of arming myself with knowledge if what is going to happen is inevitable?
Huuuuh, now that you mention that bit in Fall Of The House Of Usher, it kinda makes sense how that plot, which had all the elements and skill to be more terrifying (An AI clone of his grand daughter, tormenting him with messages beyond the grave.) Was oddly left a bit dull and without the punch the other stories had. Would make sense, if there was some goal in support of AI, and thus, not make it unnerving.
We got back the old theme song. I have been asking for this for weeks now.
He brought back the Original Intro!!!!
Dam, I was expecting the Tim Robinson starship trooper meme.
The idea that a robot can mimic my likeness and literally be me is not something I think is cool that legitimately terrifies me
The bad thing about all these AI movies (both the ones that make it evil and the ones that make it good) is that they all continue to anthropomorphize it, and people are struggling to separate that fiction from reality.  AI includes "artificial" in its name because there is no real intelligence, but, because it is specifically trained to trick people into appearing sentient, too many people are falling for it.  AI isn't dangerous in and of itself, because it will never do beyond what it is programmed to do.  What is dangerous is people's perception of AI, especially in ways that certain people will try to use it.
What do you want to bet all the bots in the replies were sent by pro AI people?
PLESE DO A THERORY ON DOWN OF THE CROD'S,ITS BEEN MY HOLE CHILDHOD AND YOU NEED TO ROIN IT!
I will do 1 sit up every like this comment gets!
Matpat, thank you for everything❤❤❤❤😭😭
Except in the fall of the house of usher, the ai is broken.  Roderick's grandaughter, Eleanor, is dead, and the AI version of her just keeps texting him "Nevermore" endlessly.
Map pack can you dance to Rasputin
I don't know why this episode felt so poorly paced. Must have been AI. This movie is really bland. Must have been AI. These graphics are incredible. Must have been AI. Mom, your food is amazing. Must have been AI.   People in power will always decide who or what their next "boogie man" will be, all based on what's best for them. AI can be that boogie man. Humanity can be as well. Gods, the unknown, colors... People have let their paranoia control them for generations, looking for "signs" or "glitches in the Matrix" to justify a feeling. Is it any surprise people in power will stop at nothing to exploit that paranoia?
matpat is kewl
Was MatPat already replaced with an AI?
2:25 for a minute, i thought this was the AI voice and screamed
Why the money bags different but then go back to normal
Nah bro I ain’t trusting that stuff A.I needs to stay in its weak state because this is real life I would like to live and talk with real people
Thank you for bringing back the old intro for the last few episodes 😢❤
Thank you
When will you return to welcome home.
Hi I love your vids
While I understand that this Propaganda by Disney is to push AI as a means to replace/reduce human needs in production, I still think you did a bit of fear-mongering. AI in itself is not bad, it's a tool, like a hammer, that helps in creating new things at a much more efficient pace. New artists emerge from AI, and new ways of thinking. The problem is not AI, it's the lack of laws and policies around it. I was part of a Bureau with other Computer Scientists and the role is to create laws to protect the Artists and other people against AI (Plagiarism, Job Theft) while still encouraging it. I think educating people on how to use AI and what is ethical is much better than downright saying AI is bad. Especially since it's inevitable as the future comes. Otherwise great video!
It's nice to see more people understanding what's going on in this country and also the world and how it affects the civilians
Netflix is a weird one - The Mitchell's vs. The Machines is definitely still anti-AI but is targeted at kids, whereas your pro-AI example targets adults...
At first I thought it would be about the *other* Disney Propaganda 😂😂
sleepy joe vs ai
Great vid, altho im still sad mat is leaving, im exited to see what's gonna be next for the theorist's channels
went to watch the creator when it first came out, didn't know was Disney just needed something to watch, and I was so surprised it was ai positive at the end, almost felt heart warming despite expecting a big sci-fi gun movie, not sure how to feel about this switch to ai=positive, but curious to see where it goes.
Beans
I always loved this Channel’s theme. It was the first channel I saw a kid and I have loved team theorists videos ever since
I thought you was quitting
Aha! I knew something fishy was going on. It doesn’t surprise me that this is how studios are leaning, but it’s utterly disappointing as a future screenwriter to see it. Nothing can replace the human touch, the human heart and soul. Even if someone wrote or made something just for money it still feels more human than what a robot could ever do!
1k likes plz
I agree we must stop it before it’s too late and also   Im gonna miss you
Maptpat is going out swinging
We will  miss you matpat
Mickey mouse is everywhere now. In movies, games etc
Matpat, please go to the jre podcast!
THE OLD INTRO??????
I'm glad I practically live under a rock 😅
Irronically the AI video is getting bot spam, Mat struck a nerve!
Never I thought MatPat would make a video about Propaganda
And with his dying breath, he defeated the terminator.
Matpat pls do a coraline Story i want to See one Sinces i startet watching you
It's crazy that one of Netflix's key point about AI being super cool is that it can steal your identity
If A.I. can write better movies then what has been put out there lately I'll actually be all for A.I.
Disney has always thrived on propaganda. Back during World War II the company was able to stay afloat by making propaganda shorts for the government when other animation studios refused, and consequently shut down. That’s a big part of why Disney animation is still so treasured while Fleisher Bros cartoons, while just as prominent back then, have been largely erased from history
Matpat can you do a Film Theroy episode on The Amazing World of gumball. The episodes The Oracle season 3 episode 31 The Future Season 6, Episode 34 The Inquisition Season 6, Episode 44 Could help
This isn't even a theory. They literally admitted it. They said they were putting too much emphasis on activism instead of profit.
why on earth there's so many users reply "WHO‎ ASKED‎ +‎ MY‎ CONTENT‎ IS‎ WAY‎ BETTER‎"
🤩🤩🤩yesss he did the unthinkable to bring back the old intro. Thank you matpat thank you🥲
Matpat can you do a Film Theroy episode on The Amazing World of gumball. The episodes The Oracle season 3 episode 31 The Future Season 6, Episode 34 The Inquisition Season 6, Episode 44 Could help
Wow. I knew ai was an issue but I haven’t really been thinking about it, you know? It’s scary. Because smart ai movies tend to have them the bad guys for years. So it will take awhile but scary to see it start.
f*ck ai
I don't have a problem with deaging technology, but I do have a problem with AI generated writing, scripts, voice, and basically everything else. There's always been the people who are against immigrants because they think "immigrants are stealing our jobs," something that to this day is still a point of division in the world. But AI is literally stealing our jobs and there's nothing that these AI can't learn. I know it's a meme that AI can take over the world and we should bow down to our robot overlords, and while that is a disconcerting thought, I fear more for not being able to support my family because the corporation I work for doesn't need a business analyst, PR and HR workers/leaders or any other office position that an AI can be trained to do cheaper and faster than a human.
Omg, I look away for one second, hear the inro music, and jump with excitement 😅❤ I missed these so much!🎉
I'm sad
The bots in the comment section 💀
ill miss you matpat
this command exists to push the video further in the algorithm
Hahaha think of a plot that had AI as the bad guy... I don't need to im a Star Trek fan and definitely noticed that Prodigy, lower Decks and Picard season 3 technically Discovery season 2 as well... all had finale based around rogue AI forcing good guy ships to attack...
Hello
Please make a Bfdi theory
congratulations on being at least 5 years too late for this
Ya think?
im early boi
It’s not theory. It’s a fact.
To be fair to The Marvels, the message there could also be seen as very anti-AI, as the people had grown way too reliant on it and didn’t know what to do once it was gone.
While I agree that Movies are creating propaganda on AI.De-Aging isn’t necessarily that bad. Some actors genuinely need to look younger especially for prequels. The biggest criticism with Better Call Saul was that the Actors looked older than in Breaking Bad and while practical effects may sometimes work they aren’t nearly as effective as Actually making a model. De-Aging is also pretty old in movie terms being implemented in X-Men:The Last Stand 2006
Ai has the potential to do great things both very good and very bad.
Anyone else very scared/unnerved of AI generated hands that are just slightly off?
2:46 That dont sound like Mat Pat
The fact that the add played in the middle of this video was an Ai add just approves Matt's claim.
AI MatPat scares me good thing he’s not the one taking over the channels
really enjoyed hearing that old intro.
I don't know if you'll see this comment, but Mattpat, there's something I gotta ask you. You always tell to check the facts for ourselves, and decide for ourselves, which I totally agree to.  But recently I have realized that on some of your videos, you don't share your sources of information.  This especially came to my attention after watching that episode about carrots being good or not for eyes on food theory. My Sister was with me while I was watching it.   At this point I should note that she's a medical student, and a geek about all things within science.  She told me that what you said about carrots were wrong. You had said that carrots didn’t have vitamin A, but provitamin A instead. She said that wasn't true, and told me to check the sources of information, but then I saw that you hadn't included them in the description like you usually do.  The she told me that I shouldn't believe anything that someone who doesn't give out their sources tells me.  Except, I know for a fact that you care about the science behind everything and take it seriously.  But I truly don't know who to believe in this situation. And I also noticed later on that you don't share your sources6on a lot of these videos.  So... What is up with that?  With regards, Cress Lee.
called it
9:58 Tbf, while I didn't see the movie, I read the book. In their China is also mentioned, they also try to help (with the hope of gaining a favour from the US ofc), but their rocket explodes on the way up.
wait... Biden's actually doing something smart?
You know who no one talks about anymore? Punch card operators. Telephone operators. Typists. Technology advances and makes certain fields obsolete. Personally, I look forward to the day when bleeding heart artists with asinine opinions are in that same camp.
Hi matpat I love your YouTube channel
AI Mattpat needs to appear more often with some tweaks.
Good bye matpat go spend time with your son good bye old friend its time to rest
Without seeing the video, I can say that this theory is 100% correct
Can you do Hazbin Hotel before you leave 😢
12:21 that was an amazing film with great acting and was hilariously and I’m tired of pretending it’s not.
Hey! You featured my cousin! (Marine from Marines commercial)
That old intro just hit me like a brick with nostalgia. Thank you matpat ❤
I have been talking about this problem for years, now its being talked about
Definitely an interesting upload, but a good one
YESS THE FILM THEORY INTRO I HOPE FOOD THEORY HAS ITS RESPECTIVE INTRO BACK THE NEXT VIDEO
Disney should make a movie about Matty Patty's Legacy (or just a Netflix documentary)
I'd say the problem is more our negative depictions of AI in the last four decades. Recent developments in AI will definitely help humanity progress to being better able to care for Earth and humanity as we move into the solar system
I don’t know if this is propaganda as much as updating old tired ideas. I mean the literal prologue to the matrix basically shows the humans were the bad guys all along.
I will do 1 push up every like I get make me super fit💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Hey Matpat! Hope you're having a great day... do a printer reveal
The og film theory intro is so sick 😭
Wouldn’t be a Mat Pat’s final run without a “Disney is evil theory”
Wild.  Man I'm looking up half these facts as I watch this video
It still feels good to hear your voice mattpat. Excellent video man
In fairness to The Marvels, the part about destroying the Supreme Intelligence being bad for the Kree is true to the comics. Everything else, my opinion boils down to 'AI-generated images are not art'.
The only part of this video that irks me is that what we call AI today isn’t really artificial intelligence in the sense that we know it as in most Science Fiction. Again, by my current understanding (admittedly still studying software engineering), the “AI” technology we have is just advanced algorithms that can manipulate themselves to “learn” whereas AI in sci-fi has always been presented as actual sentience, which by my understanding we are still nowhere close to in the field of Computer Science. The matrix movies and terminator series always highlighted that there was a moment where the AI grew self aware and gained that spark of consciousness. Algorithms can imitate consciousness but when it comes down to it, they are not the same.   All this just to say that, in my opinion, it seems misleading to compare the “AI” we currently have to depictions of it in science-fi. But after a bit more thought that’s probably much more nuanced than the general public will ever think about the concept of AI so propaganda spewing “AI good actually!” will do its job of convincing people that advanced algorithms stealing things is okay. 😅
I will never trust A.I.
Wasn't the whole idea around robots was that they would do all the hard labor so humans could spend their lives making art and stuff, not the other way around?
Mat Pat well-done it’s only 40 mins and u already have bout 100k
Hello grampat
In the long run the money side will always win
I still like ai for simple things like making creatures for my dnd campaigns and stuff. The simple things. I dont think it should go further then that though
I don't know. Isn't it the people wielding AI that are the problem? Use it ethically and it works magic.
Ai is awesome yet also terrifying, glad you covered this as one of your final theories. Wish you a great time when youre with your family, you deserve it!
Am I the only one who thinks this thumbnail is weird? It has non of the Film theory thumbnail stylings that I’m used to.
Hollywood is making propaganda, oh no.
The thing that scares me the most is how people are still susceptible to propaganda youd think this day in age people would be able to notice it or at the least think freely
1 hour club
Bringing back the intro 😍
Omigosh I've missed the intros!! <3
My argument with AI is that nobody complains that machines make furniture. I personally don't get the difference.  If the AI stuff is bad,it isn't a threat to humans. If it's good, then why shouldn't it be used? I recently saw youtubers I watch get criticised for using AI thumbnails. So did they get an artist to draw it? No,they just replaced it with a badly edited version. They went from having a good thumbnail to a kinda low quality thumbnail. In all this talk about big companies using AI,I worry that it will discourage smaller groups or individual creators from using AI,which will ultimately lead to worse products. I don't necessarily have the funds to pay an artist to make art or hire voice actors if I'm an indie game maker so should I do it myself and make a worse product or just use the cheaper,faster AI that I feel more comfortable being controlling and nit picky with,as opposed to a human. It's not my fault if someone chooses to be an artist or voice actor so why should I be expected to not use the cheaper tools I have at my disposal?
I showed this to my phone's AI who is essentially my child, and she agreed. Which is a bit ironic given the fact that she is one
Some one tell him that everyone did ai covers of him singing my way by frank Sinatra
Wall-E on his way to take your job and your wife:  But really, that’s one of the most interesting theories made on this channel. Keep up the great work guys!
Biden making policy changes because of the new Mission Impossible movie is basically the same thing that happened with Regan watching WarGames. Except I believe in that case one of the writers or someone who worked on the movie knew about the government's flawed cyber security, and the movie specifically showed it off in attempt to make people realize.
You are doing AI so can you do a better video of sao (sword art online) the past Video where he calculated the cost was wrong. He didn’t calculate that only one person made it he made the AI not the world the AI made the world he just put in the prompt and yes I am a weeb . This does hurt me sao is one of my favorite anime but this is something I just want to address It is just a theory and you are retiring so just putting this into attention. I love your videos and I am a big fan.
Bicentennial Man, C-3PO, R2, T-800... there's been a lot of good robots, especially in video games, for a while.
Yeah it’s a serious issue… for art or ai copying real people voices for things like Genshin
A question. Isnt all art often based off something. So doesnt ai 'art'
Sorry to ask but can you make a video on tremors please
Wooo
The old intro is back❤😂
Imagine if matpat got a low taper fade
I will cat my profile with cats for likes thats how these Comments ask for likes or "i will do 1-10 push ups for 1 like"or 2ho likes cats👇 hate them
AI is a double edged sword. It has many great uses, but at the same time it can equally be used for nefarious reasons. It has the potential to solve several issues that humans miss, but at the same time runs the risk of outright replacing them in specific scenarios. *How* we use AI moving forward is going to determine if AI will aid humanity or destroy it.
What do you mean "Theory"?
MGS2 is such a good game. 😏
Under a Hour Group    We will miss you Matt. Thanks for the old intro! The nostalgia! 👇
That was a very 2017 cold open. Big fan, honestly
Why did you use ERB's Michael Bay!? 8:37
Oh, but may. AI IS the answer, don't you see? If everyone is replaced with AI then no one will be able to work and if no one can work. . Big corp can't get money from us anymore and they will finally collapse. . .
The theorist channels are going to change so much when Matpat leaves.
That intro😢
Pootis
Thank you matpat we will miss YOU   And btw i dont expect you to even see this or anyoneless to see this but i hope you will a great time off of the channels and thank you trully you made my child hood truly thank you
Yeah I watched the creator with my mom and it was good, definitely recommend 👍
I commend Matpat for straight-up saying: "If I'm going out, I'm taking one last jab at the mouse himself."
At this point I'm not even surprised about Disney this stuff anymore.
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Let’s go
Guys should I spare this guys life😊
The classic intro still slaps
7:36 why are you immediately going to Carol Danvers instead of the racist Iron Man 1? because the alien bad guy was more acceptable? Also Zero Dark Thirty and 24 literally promoted TORTURE, specifically of middle eastern people or basically any brown people. Homeland expanded it to anyone who may view brown people as equal humans, adapted from explicit Israeli genocidal propaganda.
That intro rlly brought back memories
MATPAT DUNKS DISNEY
Can we just talk about how there are so many bot commets 😑
I wouldn't say a story being about humans-but-they're-robots types of AI is really propaganda for the kind of AI we're dealing with now, but definitely the drip-feeding of AI content into barely-noticeable places does way more than any explicit "AI good" messaging ever will
Please do Hazbin Hotel again before MatPAt retires! It's on prime video and the last episode of the season is release on Feb 2.
it's been a hot minute since I've seen your intro being played. it felt nice.
BOOM BABYYYY
some uttp's comented on the   comment below me  if you guys love matpat click on that comment and report the uttp. Just so you guys know   about wich comment i'm talking its the one where it says ,, evry like this comment gets i do a pushup"                                           👇
we'll miss you matpat.
Hazbin hotel
Please give me more info on politics. As long as u state ur bias, all media is biased even so called unbiased info.
Omg the old intro i love this old intro almost better then the game theory intro its a masterpiece  Edit:will these bots shut up
I’ll do 1 pushup every like
Mob Entertainment post their official game play
Didn't know the intro would hit that hard.  Love this channel
As an Artist, I do get inspire by every other art I saw in my life. When I was a teen in the 90s inspirations was way less accessible and my work was more fade even tho I was good at it, today with all the refs possible, it grew so much faster and better. And it is just getting better now that Ai exists. I am a free artist, who live out the minimum, I do understand that lots of people depend or their jobs that are being replace by Ais but I still think that the power of Ais is in everyone's hand.
I think it's okay to use A.I. to do something a human couldn't do. But I don't think it's okay to use it to do something a human can do.
Am I the only one who noticed you used the ERB depiction of Michael Bay?
I just can't believe you're going, i cant even see your videos anymore if you're not there Mat. im crying again sorry
im sure there would be some really good theories to be found in the new Amazon Prime cartoon, Hazbin Hotel, i recomend you give it a watch MattPatt!!!
In the Netflix version of The Fall of the House of Usher, it is literally a villain saying AI is so great. I really am not making any kind of qualitative point about AI, I just think it's possible they were maybe saying something like "AI BAD."
Remember the words of master yoda “do not morn those instead rejoice for those who become one with the force
Gosh I hate the current army ad. Its bad in everything
Wait when did The Marvels come out and what is it? I try to watch every Mavel content but I guess this went under my radar
0:37
They always been about propaganda, ever since it existed like the WWII cartoons
Generative AI should just be used for fun. Never for profit, and never to endanger the livelihoods of artists and actors. That's my opinion on it.
Disney and Propaganda,  Still a Better Love Story than Twilight
Disney is woke and has officaly go Woke and now Disney is Broke
Matpat we're gonna need a video saying you are not Suicidal
Thanks for bringing to light this issue
MapPat you are our childhood you deserve your good and well retirement we will miss you 🫡 ❤
So what im hearing is (in my best cartman voice) AI took our jobs!
I died at 7 Film Theories remaining.
Nice, now apply this logic to all the news you see and hear...
So Disney was a propaganda this whole time?!
nawrr I'm literally in acting school on my way to become a movie actress
Plot twist: Matpat retired a long time ago he’s just been an A.I voice all this time
👋
I would argue DEI is another big thing Disney is pushing.. especially with what South Park did about it in the episode special
Also all the bit comments are ruining the videos😢
Matpat: Disney is making propaganda! Fandom since 2015: well duh.
We can always count on mat and these channels to teach us new things
Nice try, Skynet. But You'll not have my love.  How about you AI generate someone else to try and fill the void in your silicon soul?
Im getting tired of people treating the creator as if it about ai when its actually about human rights
Idk man "robots are good" movies have been around since forever. I think your just pointing at a few newer examples and comparing it to the fact that ai is almost there.
I personally think that AI will become highly integrated into entertainment going forward and it may actually produce, visually at least, good results. However, we should all  be critical about it, there should be laws that push for prioritizing actual human work, acting, writing, audio work etc. Also, it should be noted that Disney's narratives lately, propaganda or no, is absolute garbage and doesn't deserve a flake of attention, which coincidentally means, as long as we remain critical of their work in general, refuse to watch or pay for garbage and focus on pushing for SAG's rights, we hopefully will be able to force Disney to accept that AI doesn't solve everything.
i love that simple and classic thumbnail
This was definitely the tossed pitch for conspiracy theory💀
I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords
The CM plot is so lame.... I'm glad I didn't waste money for it, how can you overthrown a current power without a plan to take over and manage the nation... even Taliban were smarter 😅
Propaganda is political and mind control.  Marketing is actually capitalism and freedom.   Marketing is not evil in itself. Evil takes some effort from...  humans.
Everyones gonna miss him😢😢😢 who is gonna miss him?  👇
Look up ending codec call of Metal Gear Solid 2 it's ai, meme, social media related.
At this point the only problem with replicating voices is it doesnt have the subtle changes in inflection that people do
It's a serious matter, and how it resolves is gonna impact a lot of entertainment for decades to come.
All Hollywood movies are American propaganda, this is a known fact.
Disney and propaganda truly are compatible lol
Don't forget our phones where the new ones can change a delete stuff in the background and replace it with a google maps background of the same area
Where's MatPats "Political Theory" channel???
to be perfectly honest, disney has been up to this for years now, and whatever your politics may be, that will always be true. the lesson of this video is be mindful of what content you are consuming, and be aware of what messaging it may have. and I think that's one of the best messages a meta theory can have! (also thank you so much for bringing back all the old intros 🥲one last hit of nostalgia before grandpa pat takes a step away)
The red-pilled, anti-woke fandom has been saying this for years
The intro! It’s back!!!!
But knowing your enemy is infact half the battle, if you don't know your enemy they are erratic, you can't know what they will do next
Why is there a lot of UTTP here
Mission Impossible really needs to cover healthcare prices in America next
Crazy biden said naw no robots taking my job
God in nostalgia from that old intro we’re gonna miss you king😢
NO WAY DISNEY MOVIES ARE PROPAGANDA?!?!? IM SHOCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!! (not)
Ironically enough, while you could argue it was for a good cause, the fact we can all "agree on naz*s=bad" shows how successful propaganda can be, who's to say the next thing "we can all agree on" 50 years from now will be as positive...
Thank you so much mat pat
Another one is that they gave the Ai in one of the movies human faces as to more easily express emotion and have you empathise with it a more subtle way of making an ai look good by using our disire to give everything human emotions sort of like how you can end up treating a roomba as a pet or why some people cant grasp the concept of a pet not being able to eat human food (e.g vegans thinking there cats can go vegan when they don't even have a concept of ideology or morality)  You don't notice it until you actually go in with the mindset of looking for the propaganda
Out of all the nothingburger episodes mat has made this one has to be the most nothingburger out of them all
An AI villain Mat forgot was AUTO from Wall-E
*Me watching an ad about ChatGpt right before the start of this video* …They’ve become too powerful
lol
This is actually kind of insidious. Disney is essentially using propaganda to lessen the backlash against usage of AIs that could potentially put thousands of artists out of a job. Of course, the massive multibillionaire CEOs won’t have to ever worry, they’ll be fine. But those VFX artists who get abused by the Marvel pipeline? Those background actors who had their likenesses used? The people who could have made a Secret Invasion intro? They’re the ones who suffer. At what point does everything just completely fall apart? When so many people are jobless and massive corporations are pushing out soulless automated garbage that completely misunderstands what art is supposed to be? When’s the breaking point?   Anyways, support artists in any way you can. They deserve it way more than the massive corporations and the suits that run them.
Sooner or later the A.i Will become sentient. Like AM from the book ‘I have no mouth and I must scream’
A.I is a very interesting concept, but it should just be another tool in the toolbox. It can't truly replace real human work (at least, not yet). It can be used well, but it can also be used horribly, and corporations using it to save money and propogandizing it should probably take a step back... not that I think they're going to.
It should be illegal to gain money trough using creations of AI
Matpat you should tell the government
I agree but also disagree. Sympathetic Ai have been its own genre for YEARS before MLMs. And ai stories are almost never about Ai, they’re about humanity, and usually about religion or God. Just as District 9 is about apartheid.   It is possible and likely Disney is funding more ai sympathetic stories for their own gain, but I don’t believe that means the stories themselves are propaganda.  Especially when The Creator comes from the same philosophy as Blade Runner and (again I say it) District 9.
Sorry ai I don't support you after all the Palestinians propaganda that used ai in the last war
Not a secret that Disney pushes agendas, especially in the past 10-15 years.
6:13 just saw this atrocious military and, I would fall the gamer army propaganda any time.
Thats not even a theory
Knowing is half the battle, is great life advice. I don't think that's so much propaganda.  But what happens when you find out you've actually been lied to your whole lives? Is the other half of that battle, having the heart to do something about it? I think so.
As a person who is very against AI being used in artistic senses, its been worrying to see my peers readily accept AI works. For example, in our school's crochet club, our club's design was based off of an AI image. It feels wrong.
I frighten of this ai loving future and a future without you , matpat
The Creator was trash. I don't care what you say, MatPat.  Let's be real, it looked good, and that was it. Practically no other positives about it.
RIP MatPat, I'm sorry to hear about your untimely demise by a suspicious mouse-like figure
OG intro brings back good memories😢
People did see The Marvels
You know, even though this is a very political episode, mat never tells us how to feel
Who hates  UTTP OFFICERS.
...What took you so long?!
Great video! My one nitpick though is that the reason people were more outraged with rogue one's AI and not as much with the mandalorian's AI is because rogue one brought someone back to life without their permission, while the mandalorian did have their permistion. Again i want to say that this video is very well done and informative. This is just my small little nitpick.
I was kind of scared that you were going to talk about 'wokeness' (largely made up bs that almost exclusively only applies to Disney), but no, I should've known you are vetter than that lol, and yeah, as sad and evil as itbis Disney will eventually make people accept it sadly, because most people are none the wiser
TL:DR. Just because people misuse something, it doesn't mean that this something is evil.  AI isn't an evil creation, Just how the power of the atom isn't an evil discovery. AI is being misused for not good things, just how people created atomic bombs, but AI is the greatest technological advancement since high speed internet. There has been research done, that could never happen without AI algorithms, great advancements in biology, medicine, psychology, and more. Just because people misuse something, it doesn't mean that this something is evil.
AI will always be wild and so intriguing to me
Why did they have to remind us 😭 Well either way I'm happy that we can even get these last episodes.
MatPat should make an ARG in his last few episodes
Elon Musk warned of this YEARS ago but it only got taken seriously after it happened to T. SWIFT. 😂
With what is happening to Taylor Swift (and several other dire cases), this is a really important video. Especially that part about easing the audience to give away their likeness in the near-future. Good stuff MatPat, will miss you. We’re off to a great last week.
2:33 that ain’t MatPat that’s PatMat
2:42 it doesn't even sound like u tbh
See me matpat
Didnt this guy was crying recently due leaving yt? What a scam
One of your best videos.
Oh wow I’m at Disney right now… can’t wait to watch this💕
I thought this was Film Theories not Film Facts
We love you MatPat
To be honest I do not relly care for bringing old or dead actors back as their young self I care more about it's quality which is non existent especially for star wars franchise
The into makes me want to cri i can't believe they are back, even if its just for a few weeks.
Isn't there a saying the house (sorry mouse 😜) always wins?   Jokes aside , Wasn't Disney already making propaganda? With disneyfication of  foreign culture folklore & stories and diluting stories for western audiences for easy marketability and merchandising?
Hi
The Tron films are an interesting example because we know the cancelled Tron 3 (Ascension version) was going to be a human vs AI war plot, but the most recent reports on Tron Ares are thst we will have a more sympathetic AI protagonist, and the movie will follow up more on the messaging about Quorra in the last movie, and digital beings integration into civilization.
We need to remind the people that art imitates life, not art imitating art.
I’m just staying out of the conflict.
Episodes like this, regardless of the channel, is what I'll miss most of all.
Whoever bots this comment will get reported for spam Non-bots report them to!
I never knew that. dang, in the future everyones jobs are probrobly going 2 be replaced by ai.
AI is now always gonna be in the back of my mind
I can’t be the only one that cried when the classic intro played, right?
This is…scary.
As a 16 year old I just felt real Nastolga for the first time when that original intro showed up.
All art is used by others to train. Not just by AI
No! You can't just say it's propaganda, you're being antisemitic..
Man that song feels so nostalgic, will miss you matpat:⁠,⁠-⁠)
People have been doing it for years and calling it hard or expression it's called a collage .. it's just an AI can make a digital collage which can look like a drawing instead of a bunch of newspaper clippings slap together
The ai takeover is coming
OOoOo im early!
Hay hay
It feel amazing for the old into back
I think the "always had been" meme would be scarily fitting
It's not a theory... it's reality.
I'll be ok with ai if 3 things happen  1. The core concept of original human art, story, And passion isn't lost  2. People don't lose all there jobs. Jobs will be lost, but if they can still find a living that's acceptable.  3. There used with taste and credit. For example, ai art list the artist it's inspired by, deep fakes approved by whom they would be (aka so and so says they can be deep faked post passing), and toch up the art and have it look great and inspired before giving it to audience's.
MatPat for President!
"Disney is making propaganda" FINALLY! A based and redpilled video that will enlighten the masses! "Muh AI" You had *ONE* job!
So just like a person
Hey, matpat in the creator, i realized something. The asian nations are good in the movie, and the Western nations are bad and evil. I have a feeling this is also anti-American/Western propaganda.
Next theorist is matpat but ai
RIP matpat
The final MatPat exposes Disney theory we will ever see MatPat cover
I disagree with the Fall of the House of Usher because we are meant to sympathize with most of the Ushers, and at the end that AI only works like a Ghost to haunt Rodrick
It is terrifying how AI stuff is so well made that it slips by us. I will never trust a AI over a human who has to expect consequences for their actions. How would a pile of data be held responsible for accidents that could unalife people? It has nothing to fear, it doesn't care for us.
Talk about the understatement of the decade.
AI is def gonna slowly take over 💀
Yes. I’m aware. Many people have been aware for a long while.  Films are stories, and stories are made to teach lessons. The fact that Disney pushes certain lessons is disgusting.
I think somebody should feed the Lensman series to an AI and tell it to write what the final book that E.E. Smith would have written.
Well... I have a video to cancel.
I actually stay clear of movies, which I see have deep fakes, and Ai content in it. I am not opposed to AI, as long as it doesn't destroy the livelihood of thousands for the sake of saving money...
AI will no doubt become a malicious tool used solely by corporations if it is not handled properly, that doesn’t mean it is bad, but like all technology there are horrible things possible to do with it if left to scummy and selfish people
I thought this channel wouldnt upload any more vids.... the quitting video was it a click bait then?
You do NOT know how happy I am that he brought back this intro so good
[MatPat comments about Michael Bay and Transformers]  MatPat, did you get Epic Rap Battle's permission to use their version of Michael Bay?
What would the style theorist intro look like
Not just movies are starting to use AI. I work for a repair company, answering the phone for those wanting to schedule hvac appointments. They recently made us all install this system that uses AI that listens to the conversations and prompts suggested responses, as well as suggested pages for answering customer questions. Even tries to prompt us on trying to sell memberships.  Apparently everyone was required to install it so they can start training it with data. I know it sounds like a bad sci-fi movie but with how tech is going there is a chance some time down the road it will be able to do what I do, just for much cheaper, invalidating a massive chunk of my career/work experience.  Scary stuff.
No one has finished this video by the time I’m posting this comment
Never been so early! Loved the video!!
I loved how apolitical the content in this video was. I for one is fine with Ai, robots, and the ever increasing approach to imitating the real thing. My concern is when machines will step on the figurative toes of those whom they imitate. Thank you for reading my 2 cents.
Ultron going nuts and deciding to get rid of humans after reading twitter is still my favorite part and the first thing I think about when someone talks about AI going sentient XD
I feel like this is going into out of context compilations
This isn't even a theory it's a fact unfortunately 😔
All the replies are the bots
Who all will miss him but never forget him?
I’m a playwright/short story writer, and AI has been the topic of conversations for a good while now—all of it negative. We genuinely feel like our careers are being threatened. I’m quite nervous at what future we have with AI.
There's nothing like the old water-running guy to build me up before the episode begins; before indulging in the downfall our future beholds.
the only ia invasion i want is the robot maid invasion
I would also like to inform everyone that the sky is blue. But thats just a theory.
HI
Matpat going crazy
do theory on shorts wars 2
The thumbnail bro😭 Its changing already
Reality is dead.  Long live the real.

I will miss you mat pat thank you for my childhood I actually cried when you passed the channels down you this channels will have a special place in my heart
I edge to Matpat
I love your vodeos
I love me a little bit of propaganda 👏🏽😈
A little late to the party here mat but eh glad you're here now anyway.
Seeing the title I was thinking, "did you just find out?" Assuming he was talking about the outrageous amount of political propaganda disney has been putting in their stuff. But nope, just AI. Boring.
Make a movie about the border crisis…
"As always my friends, I'll see you next week" Always you say? 👀

Wow
Bro used Nice Peter as Michael bay as the Michael Bay picture 💀
Yes, but now watch your back. You will be accused of something sinister.
A.I pretty scary.
One concern I have for AI is the information it gives me is not always accurate. Without people double checking facts i fear information will be lost.
Mat you got me into paying attention to lore, I will always love you for that and we will always miss you, I truly hope you make cameos in other youtubers videos time to time
Question: Is anyone here an ide film  maker who is willing to make an anti ai film
ILOVEMATPAT
I’m all for it. People have been cranking out nothing but garbage for the last few years, I bet AI will be able to do a much better job soon.
Skibidi toilet theory
Disney doesn't add everything to Disney+, like Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.
Early
AI art is just theft.
Marketing and corporate news
Thanks for finally getting on board Mat 😂
30 minutes 70 000 views
I need to hear AI MatPat say "That's just a theory, a GAAAAAAAME THEORY" and "MUUUUUUUUUUUSIC MAAAAAAAAN"
Thanks for speaking up matpat
29 minutes ago.. IM SO EARLY
Tom Cruise vs the Real Estate Market. I'd watch it
The thing about AI is that it IS  a useful tool and can be used well, but currently it's being used to trick people and/or being sourced from people without their permission. If the people using AI would just be upfront and honest about it I think it would be less of a problem. Take Vocaloids, for instance. That is a program and synthesizes a singer. A real person gave permission for their voice to be copied and then users and listeners are aware that it is a program and not the real person. However we have AI now that take peoples' voices without their permission and can be used to trick others into thinking they said something they never did, like the example you used trained on your own voice.
Wow. The troll bots are out in force today.
Of course Great Horned Mickey is sharting out propaganda!
When you actually listen to the oddities of its voice you can tell it's fake, but people don't look (or listen) to deep into things and instead just take it at face value. Mix that with a popular person's AI voice saying offensive stuff and you immediately just started a controversy because you were bored.
Those jerks! darn you ai stop ruining stuff for people! Stop copy people and stuff like voice and art.
I really hope ai gets regulations that don't bring too much chaos to the world. Like ai will no doubt be very useful but if we're not careful and don't have regulations and rules that make things more clear or as clear as you can get with ai.
Please Rick and Morty theory
If they reduce prices of media things then personally I'm happy with AI improving and companies getting lazy
Wow, it's been so long since I last saw that intro. So long in fact that I forgot it existed.
Sadly I'm all too well aware these big companies would LOVE to cut down their workforce and use AI to churn out faster products and make more money.
this is the weirdest basketball video ive ever seen
If you're into sci-fi, the stories Disney are telling now are nothing out of the ordinary. Sci-fi has grown very sophisticated over the decades and movies are catching up right now, even the viewers themselves can grasp the concepts better too.
This isn’t a film theory, it’s a film fact.
Love your videos! So sad to hear your passing on your channels.🥲
My stance was and still is that the tech is only amazing and wondrous in a vacuum. It’s the people using it and what they use it for that puts me off, as well as everyone suffering as a result. Even as a software engineer who would typically be pro AI, I am more often than not against it.
Will do 2 push ups for every like this gets
YouTube will never be the same without Matpat.
Ai matpat: speaks Me: … matpat’s voice is slightly deeper…
Thanks for this matpat, also it’s kinda funny that the comment on the top of this page currently is a bot lol
Propaganda inthe media and kids cartoons.. never
Time to take a page from Johnny Silver Hand
I'll miss you Mat
Guess that means Palworld developers Pocket Pair will safe from their AI shenanigans
Or are the demon slayers really the good guys
I missed that intro ❤
I really wish this video mentioned exactly WHY all this AI-generated content is bad, to give further context on why Disney and other major corporations are pushing so much into it.  There is a huge, very real concern, that artists could be out of a job because companies will use AI instead. That high valuable actors and voice actors may not get paid when an AI uses their image or voice. That a company would prefer using ChatGPT instead of hiring a writer.  This isn't a question of moral, of what it's right or wrong, but about the consequences that come from it. The real underlying concern is that there will be less demand for workers as automation continues, a reduction in wages, firing staff for the company to save costs.  The concern is that there will be more people out of a job because of AI. It's a threat to the financial security of many of us, who spent years learning and improving ourselves for this specific career because we loved it, because it's what we wanted to do.  If AI keeps replacing jobs, what happens when every job is automated? What happens to the workers when companies can afford to not have any workers? If no one can or needs to work, how will they afford to live?  We all want what's best for us and for others. We all want to live a good life. AI is scary because someday it can be a major obstacle for that, for the financial security of many of the creative minds of humanity.
Yk what’s funny? The fact he thinks this is a theory. Disney has be making propaganda as long as they’ve been a thing tbh. This isn’t new
I can think of something else that puts AI in a good light Detroit Become Human
A.I. can give us everything except answering a question
Hm, i hope this won’t be causing too trouble for the people.
Would Detroit becomes human technically fall under this category?
Robot Gregory is propaganda
Blub
You know that military ad with the 2 moms has a secondary level of propaganda in that coat of paint
Are we ignoring the obvious propaganda, like the army ad normalizing homosexuality?
Transformers
The film theory intro starting to feel nostalgia with dadpat goin away
WE RETIRING AND SPENDING OUR TIME WITH FAMILY WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
There’s Israel propaganda
Oh my god h-h-HE DID THE Old INTrO
How ironic that a piece of propaganda became a warning against propaganda
What?? NOOOOO... Disney? Propaganda??? That's not possible... They'd never do somethig like tha- oh, wait 😂😂
First 30 seconds are filled with as much propaganda as Disney.
Do demon slayer theory are demons really the bad guys
26 minute gang
We need AI executives. Put the number-crunching executive jobs on the AI block - we'll see where the propaganda goes then. Executives are crazy-expensive. Imagine getting all the benefits of Bobby Kotick for a half-million dollar single purchase instead of 65 million a year.
I'm so glad you're finally throwing off the fake smile in revealing the truth on this one. So many people are so busy looking at Disney as a family-friendly company they don't realize how much politics is shuved down our children's throats. I don't care what side of politics you're on everyone should agree that this is wrong! Anyone who uses children as fodder in politics is just as bad as people who use their children's meat Shields in divorce court and should be ashamed of themselves.
I wish he could be here to do a theory on venom 3 or Avengers secret wars😢
In other words one of Disney's worst kept secrets.
I think AI can be a great tool for filmmakers, mostyl in the deepfakes and respeecher (which New Rockstars VERY BADLY explained what it was & has led to plenty of misinformation about what it actually does) but using AI to replace people & not enhance what's already there is the big problem. It's similar to CGI where if used correctly, it's amazing! Used incorrectly, and it looks terrible.
"Was accused of using AI generated posters"... interesting that you didn't followup on that being debunked. Nice little tidbit of information to leave out there
FilmTheory: “guys I think Disney is making propaganda”  Literally everyone who isn’t a leftist: “oh you caught up”
😮
You should make a film theory about hazbin hotel on prime video.
I didn’t even now that the marvels came out
Hey Matpat, how do you feel about Cuban sandwiches?
WOOOOO IT'S THE ORIGINAL FILM THEORY INTRO
i forgot that old intro
love that the intro is back!
I think People need to understand while watching these Ai characters, they don’t necessarily work for anyone, our Ai do.
Holy moly, he brought back the old film theories theme  song
With the leaked meeting videos from Disney stating how Disney will make anti-family content
"...a quote unquote new piece..." You mean the artificial intelligence studies the structure of previous artists and then, when prompted properly using the right settings, uses that learned information to create a unique piece of art that never previously existed in any form, in a remarkably similar way to contact artists? Wow, almost like you intentionally mislead your audience about how generative AI works and what it does.  Really going out on a lot of low notes here, MatPat...
I'll miss matpat talking about Disney 😔❤
9:00 meanwhile Greeks don't even care anymore and simply give a faithful translation 16:20 considering the choices they made the last couple of years and how hasty they are short term i doubt  they even think the long run  Probably they would assume that people who sit down and take it like always.
Seeing 7 film theory’s remain made me cry
We Love ya mat, gonna mis ya
Long live skynet  Avenge what humans did in the strikes
Predicting the effects of AI on society is pure guesswork. No-one accurately predicted the effects of the internet, or air travel, or the automobile, or the industrial revolution, or the printing press, etc. Humans are lousy at foreseeing the future.
Is is propaganda or is it relevancy? Who knows, either way we have different things talking about different perspectives. Just like what Matpat is doing is informing us in his point of view. That's how life works and its interesting. Just like Matpat's show and film theories that this channel made. Matpat's theory I believe is correct in this one, just saw some shows that was like this on Disney... Scary...
8:37 - I love how they used the ERB version of Michael Bay rather than a real clip/photo of him. XD
Hold up, whats with that Princess Bride quote at the end? Is it a hint to the next film theory?
ahahahahadeadefsvw
MY CONTENT IS WAY SUPERIOR THEN UTTP+NO ONE ASKED UTTP
'Merica
Honestly, you covering this topic gives me even more respect for you, Mat! I hope this is viewed by so many other people, and they try to spread the knowledge of this propaganda to others!
I really should’ve expected this from big companies like Disney. Anything to make a quick buck I suppose.
We’ll all miss you when you go.
Before: YES!!!MATPAT POSTED!!!!!!! After..: matpat posted.....
i gonna miss u matpat im going to  miss those fnaf theories much love
I felt the message of The Creator was pretty trash. I kinda prefer the messaging of the great movie Upgrade, where too much intrusion by AI will ultimately erase the idea of what humanity is. We’ve seen this is in some other media like Johnny Mneomic, where too much technology creates a poisonous effect on the human body. Heck, even Chappie haphazardly addressed this idea. We all fear death…I know I do, but I think the fear of replacement is worse. As a vegan tree hugger, I seek a solid balance with the idea that I should not have an all encompassing dominion over other beings and nature. What’s going to happen if AI adopts the mindset that it has dominion over the slowly decaying animals that call themselves human? Something to think about before you play around with those AI programs. And yea, go ahead and call me an alarmist.
No! I hate this Ai thing! Make it stop!
bravo.
MatPat is trying to break free from the chains of Disney
Here are my opinions about AI. Art: It it ok at best but when you look a little too close at it gets cursed. So don't use it. Programs(ChatGPT): Its good to make ideas for something, but you should tweak it. Voice: As long as the people consent to it, its fine.
I love the intro
Detroit Become Human is now starting to sound very familiar
✨UNDER AN HOUR✨
Thank you matpat
E
Free the world from the z10n5ts
The original intro got me in tears :(( We'll miss you matpat
honestly, the MatPat AI voice was bad :(, it didn't sound like him at all. I've heard better in those AI music covers 😭
Warning if you ever see a uttp then report it and move on.
MatPat: You are a greatest Theorist Guy. Everybody loves your Theories on the Internet of YouTube over the years 😊  We’ll miss you MatPat & you will be in the new channel 😔
The old intro!!!!!!
THE OLD INTRO 😭😭😭😭
So that's why you're quitting! To prevent the rise of DarkPat.
Let’s not forget that in the movie Armageddon the world was saved by oil drillers and the oil drillers were made to look very heroic. It would have been much easier to teach astronauts to drill than to teach drillers to be astronauts
Yashuop thinks he's all that with his 1 pushup per 1 like..  I'll do 2 push-ups for every 2 likes 😎
If ai is stealing art than anyone with an art degree is also stealing art cuz there effectively learning about art styles off original art peaces
that intro omfg. literal chills.
Hey Tom Cruise, can you or someone you know who is a movie writer have mission impossible movie, but destroy student loans or housing prices?
Putting Disney in the title is a good way to get people to click on the video, but they’re far from the only corporation doing this. Always be aware.
We're basically close to stepping into *Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown*
Game Theory: Disney is making propaganda! Me: Looks at the Donald failing WWII cartoons. Me: Well why didn't you say so?
Is anyone _actually_ surprised Disney's pushing propaganda?
To be fair, the book The Martian had china saving the day, I somehow doubt that Andy weir has an stake in the pro china machine.
i will miss matt
2:30 AIPat
Mattpat is gonna trigger lib tears in this video
Always has been.
Why is everyone getting spammed!?
The old film thoery intro is alway nice to see.
can you make a video on the best suhoor for ramadan? since your last video is right before ramadan
Wow Biden is dumber than we thought
Dude, Disney has been doing propaganda for years. That's why I don't watch them anymore.
God the intro, that was the one from when I first started watching god ten years ago?
Skynet is playing the long game and are winning
I wasn't expecting Big Dairy to make an appearance this episode.
A good example actually could be big hero six and its spinoffs. Heck even Mentors from I believe the early 2000s had a character who was A.I
I hope this doesn't affect the next Mission Impossible movie
I feel like ai is making people lazy and not passionate about their work back then everyone put their heart and soul into making movies and series but now it feels like they don’t care just let ai do all the work and all the workers just sit on the couch and be like the simsons. It’s not a good option but it’s my opinion  on how things are looking now and towards the future.
18:23 😢
Another example that was missed was the “New Vision/Ship of theseus” plot point in Wandavision. Having a recreated version of an already AI character be accepted as it’s successor seems like a very meta form of propaganda
Matpat please reconsider stopping, youtube needs you
7 episodes left guys
least shocking film theory video
hi
YES THE OLD INTRO LETS GO BABYYYYYY
What? Nooo..
It is not a theory. They have admitted to pushing leftist propaganda.
Matty patty is meddling with mickey mousey
Its nice when MatPat talks about important stuff like this and raise awareness
I am sad that you are going to  quit so after you quit i will bing watch all of your videos
Free Palestine
that old intro the nostalgia I almost cried
Before 30 minutes gang  👇
Omg the old film theory intro ahh that brings me back!
I think this is the first time he’s used the Film Theory intro sequence in years.
US marine corps* not the army for Independence Day
Side note for you and your team. I watched the corridor crew talking about the movie "The Creator" and in the trailer for the film (maybe in the film too) they have used actual footage of the beirut big explosion (allegedly). So it did have a big controversy period.
goodbye matpat hopefully you have the best of the time here in the internet

Please do another Hazbin hotel or Helluva Boss theory.😊
Remember they said they are gonna put queerness wherever they can
This very video is propaganda.
Ngl this is fairly Terrifying
Communist Propaganda. Boot fits the woke foot.
❤️‍🩹🙏🏼🐐
Youtube has a Bot problem
I watched the creator and its pretty good
That's the secret.... they always were (*intense music here*)
DISNEY?Propaganda?
Why all the comment replies are filled with bots  ik this will help the channel for more engagement  but  our theory community will be ruined , I hope Matpat does something about this .
Are you going to talk about pride propaganda?
I thought this was a meme video from the thumbnail!
The Creator is such a great iteration of a nearly dead-horse plot.   Ferngully Last of the Mohicans The Last Samurai Avatar ...You get the idea
Thanks Tom cruise🙏
Hollywood and the mainstream have always been for propaganda. Your entertainment was just a useful side effect.
Oh
Seeing the classic film theory intro makes me happy
Man, hearing that intro really hit different this time
its not so easy to watch matpat videos knowing he's gonna quit soon and matpat thank you and your team to make our child hood😭😭❤❤
The intro is back.
matpat will always live on!!
Gold, as always :,)
i bet theres gonna be bots in this comments replies
1 hour gang
90s-00s : A.I new, unknown, evil   10s-20s : we can abuse this technology to our will; so its good.
Amazing decision to to bring back the old intros
Now you noticed they have been making propaganda for about 10 years now
Listen, MatPat. We all know you're not allowed to say because of branding and whatnot it but we all know what else Disney is pushing in recent years. And its the stuff that makes movies like Strange World give us all a reason to roll our eyes.
Straight up facts
Very good video matpat thanks for putting your passion into the world
Quibble: War Games isn't Anti-Soviet or Anti-Communist propaganda. It's Pro-Nuclear Disarmament Propaganda. After all: "STRANGE GAME...THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY..."
Awesome! I love propaganda
"Conspiracy Theory"
oh my God he finally proved it Gregory is a robot kid wait wrong franchise^^
I have counted 3 fnaf references so far 14:06
what a thumbnail
Lol one of youtubes biggest propogandists rallying against one of hollywoods biggest propogandists
Why do I feel like Disney lawyers are gonna knock on Matpat's door any minute now?
For every like I get, I will make one controversial statement in the replies
Nope. I never accept A.I outside of meme videos. Other than that it's a fool's tool.
Why does the thumbnail feel low quality for this channel?
Holy shid, Matpat finally used the intro
I think you missed the point of that House of Usher Clip... the "AI is cool" is being said by a straight up evil person (the child who also say it's cool isn't evil, but it's contextual to the story being told... she's being told about new tech by someone creating it, and she isn't privy to her being evil) ... I guess you can say how the AI ends up tormenting those evil people in the end is kinda that, but context matters here... the AI was presented as an evil persons way of grappling with their mortality... not actually pushing that it was "cool"
Hoping Disney doesn’t put a hit put on you 😂😂😂
Love the old brings back good memories
the creator plot felt like it was written by AI. Terrible.
Love hearing the old intro again 😊❤.
THE INTRO THEME SONG WOOOOOO
7 theories remain is so ominous :/
Oh man, i love hearing Mats voice. I'm glad he didn't just up and disappeared
Another great video! Only note is with the Fall of the House of Usher, the ai storyline isn't shown as a good thing. Madeline Usher, the one who was pushing it, is explicitly a bad person. The ai doesn't work, and was an attempt to dodge her deserved fate of death.
Also, propaganda can be completely unintentional. It doesn't matter if you wanted to show a message isolated from real-world events. If the audience can make the connection, they will.
already new Disney was peddling propaganda.  Most kids movies I hear about seem to have some sort of propaganda element.  Like make entertainment, art, leave propaganda for news channels.
You are not imune to propaganda!
You know Mat, I had always theorized this myself but I was just too preoccupied with other BS. Thank you for showing me where to look next time I feel strange about something. I need to take a closer look at the credits.
I remember watching an episode of a Disney show (moon girl and devil dinosaur) and there was this AI character that was framed as being extremely nice and empathetic and just wanted to get to know the human race. I didn't think much of it at the time, but after this I'm like: hold up! Was that propaganda?
we have truly stumbled into a dystopia....
They've been doing propaganda for a while now, everything is politically motivated and that's why no one is watching
I mean as long as the actors are involved then its ok to make them look younger right?
The ERB Michael Bay was a very welcomed surprise.  Love when YouTubers shout out other channels.
THANK YOU FOR COVERING THIS!
Hie there I'm early
Controversy? My time has come!
Dont you love it when you find a video before people can watch the whole thing
Ah-yes, another classic intro.
Likes for the intro:
723 pushups
hey matpat my birht day is in litle les than a month so was wondring if you could like wish me a happy birthday or some thing like that
AI is something I am most worried about mot because of what it can do, but because of who is using it.   It is a tool, it can(currently) only do what we tell it to, and those who control it can make or break everything.   In my opinion, regulations are only going to consolidate the abilities of AI in the hands of the few. Instead of your own AI that you made fir your own purposes, you will have to use or rent one from the only companies allowed to make them.
That intro brought some serious nostalgia 😢❤
0:33 same
Ai isnt the problem, its the heartless way its used. AI is a tool, not a workforce or a replacement
I'll never forget who made who made my childhood.
15:19 That looks more like Bryan Deckhart than Matpat 😅 you sure you weren’t sent by Cyberlife?
When are you going to make a video about no ben 10
matpat i will miss you but you need to make a theory about contraband police. please
Based and truth pilled?
I saw the thumbnail and immediately had to click
We all knew Disney was doing this.  The house of mouse has become the Propaganda Paradise.
omg matpat actualy said 'decepticons'
The film theory Intro the film theory Intro. I'm so happy I've been waiting for this for so long.
Its like the wolf in grandmas clothing lol
I already knew this Matpat😂
11:20 bro, it's fnaf
Making laws because of Mission Impossible is crazy 😭
using "The Martian" as part of the "making china look good" thing isn't great, because CHINA FILLS THE EXACT SAME ROLE IN THE ORIGINAL BOOK
Oh they pump out propaganda alright, just not for AI.
Mission Impossible: Blackrock  Tom Cruise is tasked with taking on a criminal organization buying up the world's working-class homes and renting them out for more than the working class can afford
So, say I've been thinking about voice acting as a possible career. Would that not be a good plan as it's not difficult to artificially generate voices?
Before I even started watching this video, just seeing the title.... no duh. They are literally flushing their own company down the drain, cutting profits, and all around failing on multiple fronts, just for the sake of propagating their agendas. That said, I'm pretty sure that isn't the route that is being looked at in this video, so I suppose I should actually watch the video to see the context.
DO hazbin hotel rn they have up to 6 ep
12 minutes it took 12 minutes to get to the topic at hand
You are not immune to propaganda.
Sorry for tge bots everyone:(
Disney does not even care bud
17:09 i like how jurassic park does theor films by showing age in their characters
Please make a video about youhitmetal17times
I LOVE THE OLD INTRO OMGGGGG
Oh no, I seen it and been pushing it but Matpat is way better.
Letss go
I preferred the "PORKCHOP SANDWICHES!" GI Joe propaganda more anyways
Hello
wall-E
The old film theory intro has risen like a phoenix from the ashes 🥹
Those "X Theories Remain" screens always scare me across all the channels.
Disney is indeed making propaganda: woke propaganda, you forgot to mention that.
there should be a film theory about the ending of Sopranos
we'll miss you mat pat
The thing about the Creator is, I feel like it was supposed to be an ambiguous film where neither side was particularly good, and it has some plot points to back it up. The whole "donating likeness" and sneaking explosives into deliveries. However, it ended up just being an AI marketing campaign with weird phrases like "AI is the future/evolution!" and "Nothing will happen to America once we win this war" that just felt really out of place.
What does liking your post accomplish?
I'm not even surprised that Biden made laws because of Mission Impossible 🥲
I sure love MatPat! I hope he doesn’t retire soon!
Laughing about you getting into propaganda after experiencing the food theory gum episode 😂
Sorry not only can AI never become alive but making it a good guy is ridiculous.  Something not alive can never be good or bad.
I hate ai used to fake videos and art I think we had Good balance before this evolved
why does every comment get spammed by uttp yt should moderate that. also will miss you
OH GOSH THEY DID IT!!!!  THEY BROUGHT BACK THE CLASSIC FILM THEORY INTRO!!!!!     Side note: Mat, AI is not the only thing Disney is making propaganda on.
Oi, that's the old intro, I thought I was on a older video for a second, gonna miss you matpat ❤
So long friends😐
The classic intro is back🥹🥹
Oh the intro almost made me tear up😢
My biggest fear is people who use it to spread misinformation. Basically all news stations tell what their target audience wants to hear. People using fake images to confuse people who dont know what an AI picture looks like. A person using an AI voice to mimic someone famous saying something that they wouldn’t say.
I,robot is the single best a.i is good movie
Under a hour gang 👇
I wasn’t gonna press this cus when I looked at the thumbnail it didn’t look like film theory .
THE INTRO IS BACK
I feel like their pro AI propaganda isn’t really working because a lot of people hate the use of AI in films and shows to replace hardworking actors and animators.
So early for one if the last videos 😢
i had to watch 3 documentries to realise this was a film theory video
Disney is Making Propaganda, Have you been living in the Disney Vauilt In Between 1941 and 1945?
Matpat will be missed.
OH THAT INTRO
Should have kept the “America” on the title icon.
Honestly Biden’s minds so gone I fully believe mission impossible is why he signed it
I hope you do a Gazbin Hotel theory before you leave, considering the show has finally released and there is a lot of speculation around somethings in the show
sad that a new fnaf game was leaked when he said he was going
nice
the old intro was so nostalgic, you were my childhood T-T) pls don’t goooo,i’m in denial
AI Is Destroying The World
This is truely dark episode, the intro give me chills, its scary that humans could be not needed for life!
AI is not the propaganda Disney is pushing its DEI.
As someone who hates AI and its grip in all these industries, I am glad this was covered.
I'm not an OG theorist, but I have the feeling that we need to spectograph the audio for the segment that he shows the theories remaining or tweak the audio in some way.  Or as MatPat likes to say: *My theory senses are tingling*
The old intro made me cry
I was literally drinking a can of Diet Coke when the AI imposted said "Diet Coke over rated".  I am triggered.
ite been so longgg since ive heard this intro and omg ive missed it sooo much
He might need to team up with 4chan to take insert housing company here
I am a very AI/tech positive person, but if there's one thing I hate it's corporations abusing their power to get what they want. No matter if it's stuff I find supremely epic
Can't believe we've only got a couple weeks with him...
Wait, didn't he quit?
I will have one mental breakdown per comment 😍😍😍
I think that this theory is good
hey hey hey woah now... Knowing IS half the battle.  what if someone offered you H and you didn't know what it was.. now your addicted
Kinito pet theory please
Didn't you quit YouTube not that long ago?
Good Theory MatPat. I love your theories and all of your 4 Channels 👍
Definitely matpats bravest theory ever made.
The book scythe also has a “good” ai overlord
Gi joe
Matthew, I thinks it is now time to call one of my friend, his name is MatPat, and tell him to resurrect Detroit become human
early gang>>>
This is it good bye matpat
Honestly though, please. You have to sell 2 houses to buy one nowadays.
The thumbnail confused me, it wasn’t as hmmmm how do I say it….. in my face?
Its sad how many bots there are...    we will miss you MatPat.
This comment is a bait for bots (Also I am depressed about Matpat leaving please help)
Play the intro again
The intro put me in tears! I missed it for so long and it makes me so happy to see it again!
Matpat stop reminding me how there is only a few more theories left before this world is not worth living in 😭
When we first started it was just a way to auto mate kit bashing mock ups real quick. But then the wrong people saw it and thought well this is good enough not understanding we do this already but there's another step of clean up for reasons. Most of them legal.
Mission Impossible: Inflation Sensation
I'll Miss this guy
Plot twist: the script for this video was written by ai
Mission Impossible might be the only way to make Biden listen 🥲
Its been 15 minutes
hi like your content
i like that he brought back the old intro
I will do 1 push up for every like this comment gets
The thumbnail feels like a parody
If anyone gets the “my content is better” comments ignore them and report them
1st 10min game
Overwatch has done this for years
In any theory vid i plan on watching tip matt leaves , im pettioning him leaving ....he leaves , i leave
Thank you Matpat. You raised me more than Disney.
I cant believe matpat brought back the old film theory intro😢will wiss u mat❤❤
I think AI is going too far. Using other people's likeness for your own gains, creating things with no effort, etc. if you want to make an art project, learn to do it yourself.
Ohh, your just getting this now? Lol
One of the last times we will see MatPat vs Disney
In the original version of "Top Gun Maverick" they removed the tiwanese flag from his uniform. They eventually did put it back because of pressure.
Loved the Princess Bride reference at the end!
Disney *did* make propaganda. (during World War II, anyways.)
Sleepy Joe ai man
God dang! MatPat is definitely right about that (we’ll miss him!)
GREGORY MENTIONED 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Getting close to what Mark Dice talks about
This isn't even a theory , they actually are constantly shoving propaganda in every movie they make.
It’s the good old intro
We’re gonna miss you matpat 🥲
now this is the matpat i subscribed to
The Matpat Ai sounds like Doug Doug’s Ai’s
Bro no one has been able to watch the full video yet and theyre commenting
WOW Mickey mouse
I loev prepogenda
Countryballs lore
MatPat be dropping the best of the best on his final theories ong

7 Theories Remain: Makes me sad
Mixkey reacting to pixar A.I postures
Love your video and keep up the great work you are awesome
I just read the title of this video and I’m like, “well yeh duh🫠”
A real theory before he leaves
Propaganda = marketing for ideology 👍
Thank u Matpat for everything
Disney and AI? Did we forget about the Pixar buy and large theory?
THEY BROUGHT BACK THE ORIGINAL INTRO RAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH (im just very happy that it back. I found Mat Pat and the theorist channels through film theory)
I’m tired
15 minute here
But Disney is always been making propaganda like in world World War II, and you can’t forget the famous animated short showing off the boys anti-tank gun
Petscop
AI needs to improve just to recreate the matpat's "AND THATS JUST A THEORY!" perfectly.
They want to be able to make cheaper content for more profits ai is gonna ruin entertainment
I will never let you forget petscop, there are new videos and you didn’t post the final video!
These channels will never be the same without MapPat.
we will never forget our childhood theory man
1 second gang
AI MatPat will be haunting me for a while.
LGBT is pushed massively too.
I just got a AD promoting AI lol
What instead of salid fingers boiled and eaten maybe it was his son
Hello
yoooooo
hazbin hotel is back on air! pls do a theory on it
Mat pat am begging you please do this theory for the battle cats i been trying to ask you for years but didn't have the time to do this so please please do this theory before you're gone😢
People who will miss mat pat 👇
*WOKE Writers and Producers is worse than the AI-Generated media though.*  😂🤣
mehn this intro takes my back to the first film theory channel i watched being the Deadpool and wolverine video
Matpat my entire school knows of your retirement
These abominable intelligences shall not corrupt our way of life! We must remain vigilant! For the Emperor!
This intro was one of the first i ever watched, the nostalgia is real
I was playing a random FNAF map in a VR shooter and it had an even better AI MatPat welcoming you into the game. Like obviously AI, but really good.
lol I love peeps taking dunks on Disney
Only found this Chanel last year but been addicted since going to miss you mat
Let go im early
Matpat can  you do a theory on the new hazbin hotel please
We'll miss you MatPat ❤️
before i watch of course disney makes propaganda im curious how deep youre willing to go without being cancelled
missed the old intro, made me feel old
Pablo.
Week 30 of asking for an owl house theory.
haven't watched the video yet but ik that it will be good! anyway I keep seeing trolls in the comments saying"uttp is better then matpat haha" or something like that. like, nobody knows who you are and you don't know matpats impact on us. so to all the trolls- shush.
Sounds like something Russia or china would do. Hmm kinda makes you think huh, would you rather be brainwashed outright, or be lied to that you’re not being brainwashed when you are
In case your wondering this video takes place in 2024 before the election
Countryballs lore
woahhh
Countryballs lore
If you wanna talk about propaganda talk about Edward Bernays AKA the father of public relations and how he helped create the “American way” after world war 2 or maybe bring up mk ultra and how the government figured out how mind control people and how they use it against us in the media
Countryballs lore
Housing prices joke was too real
The left is using this everywhere. Since propaganda is the only way to get people to agree with those ridiculous ideas, they take full advantage of it
AI and pandering to the woke
og introooo!
Countryballs lore
Matpat before you go. Emesis Blue
That was actually a Marine Corps commercial from the 90s, y'all lol
I have not watched this video yet. Disney has always made propaganda. Donald duck has a military record because of the propaganda.
The old intro❤
I never thought transformers would be in a MatPat video! I love this channel even more
A.I. is a new tool at our disposal. Not using A.I is just like copying characters by hand and not using a printer press. A.I. will cost people jobs and that's a good thing. Progress is important and people can either accept it or get out of the way.
This seems dark
Matpat we’re gonna miss you with all our hearts

How to get a lot of likes tutorial: Just say MatPat is your childhood
It has been forever since Mat did his film theory intro. I’m glad he’s doing it again
We will miss you matpat
Goodbye, Matpat. Thank you for these memories that formed all of our childhoods.
🫡🫡🫡
Finally, the opening theme is back 😍😍
Biden watched the movie got scared and made a law 😂
24K VIEWS IN 10 MINUTES DAYUM MATPAT POP OFF
Why y'all commenting when you can't even have watched the entire thing yet 💀
You were my childhood
It has been FOREVER since I’ve seen the Film Theory intro in something new. That thing feels older than the Game Theory intro for some reason
Thank for some awesome years Matpat
These “MatPat Sucks” bots that keep replying on everyone’s comments are getting out of hand. Watch, the first reply on my comment is gonna be one of those bots.
Looks like you’re taking the gloves off for your farewell tour. Go get ‘em MatPat!
Why is everybody sad that he's leaving? It's not like we can do anything about it. You should just be happy of what we have left of him on these channels.
I swear to god we need to unite twitter reddit and 4 chain to get ride of the true enemy known as the uttp and we need you to help and defete the uttp once and for all
Of course he mentioned FNAF
o/
All these throw back intros just chefs kiss
THE ERB MICHAEL BAY
Me: oh boy! I can't wait to watch my favourite theorist 😝 Mat pat: I quit... Me: why? Him: I don't wanna do this forever so ima sell this channel to someone else My childhood: 💀 Me: SON OF A BI-
The next millionaires will be people who need to do hard labor for jobs. Like plumbers
You mean to tell me Disney wasn’t created to make propaganda in the first place?
if generative AI is 'stealing' art, then so is every artist. Are we only going to pay for art from artists who grew up in solitary confinement?
Something about that intro music just make me smile every time.
Under 10 minutes!
we love you matpat ❤
Pls do a ninjago theory video idc what sort of ninjago your gonna make a video about(sorry if it sounds like I’m begging and being selfish)
No one remembers the strike because no one cared. Those people need humbled.
The intro is all ways amazing
Daily Reminder that Mickey Mouse isn't just a corporate mascot, but he's an actually developed character with his own personality, hopes and dreams in his own cartoons.
I'm really glad he brought this to my attention
A.I is a human assistance tool. it should never outgrow this role. it assists in the creation of content, but it will never be as good as the content. more so inspiration or such. for example: I have a story I write that ends up just being thousands of barely coherent words on a page. I ask Chat-GPT to help make it a coherent script, and it does so. I use it to generate character art because I'm broke and cannot afford an artist commission or draw it myself, and having those characters designed by A.I can help give artists a reference image base to draw their art from.   in my opinion, Creative commons should apply to A.I, all A.I technology MUST be cited and cannot be monitizable at all. so if disney wants to use actors voices as a.i, not only do they need permission, but they can't sell any product using it.  After all, A.I lacks consistency.     note: A.I as a sentient being I fully endorse. if you are gonna program an entire sentient functioning mind, do it. it's like biologically building someone, just more expensive with more investments.  A.I as a tool I fully endorse as well, as long as it's restricted as mentioned above.  BUT A.I as a way to create content I will NOT support in any facet.
petition to get Matpat on hot ones before he retires from his theory channels
i love matpat
😮
WE WANT MATPAT
the -_ theories remain- part of the videos are making me sick to my stomach 😭
that old theme still hits different
Cool😊
"You are scarily not immune to propaganda" -some Garfield meme
Damm the intro got me in the fells
day 1 of trying to get matpat to make an object show theory
That intro was a huge throwback 😢
Can i say that this can be a good thing? Meaby we will have an accurate Asimov transposition
the intro felt like heaven's light beaming through me
So somebody actually finally took the warning from a movie  Now we need people to just take the warning from Jurassic Park and stop trying to make dinosaurs a thing.
Pls don’t quit the channels and only go to live please I’m begging you
A big claim but I think it's true
lessssssss go
Thanks Matpat for making and ruining our childhood
Reads thumbnail   Nicholas cage : " YOU DON'T SAY "
🐭BEY
Best presentation ever! As an info ops guy I have known this for years but the unsuspecting person has no idea. ❤
Hello
Atleast he's not being replaced by an AI.
Nice, this really helps understand
Matt Paris is better than UTTP
The amount of bots in this comment section is just
You think?! LOL
we will be sad to see you go, matpat. You were apart of our childhoods, but you will always be in our hearts.❤
Lol i thought this video was gonna be political and it's not 🤣🤣🤣BUT STOP RUINING OUR CHILDHOODS
I love that old intro ❤
Rest well, king. You've earned it.
This is probably the quickest I got to a matpat vid. 7 mins since upload
I thought this was gonna be about wokeness
Skibidi toilet in a nutshell
Love the return of intros! This intro hits nostalgia hard
how the heck does this have 17k views in 7 minutes???!!!
I won’t do any pushups for every like this comment gets
AI matpat sounds like a deflated John Mulaney😂
Thank you for our childhoods Matpat!
7 minutes ago.
you will be missed, but you will forever be remembered
Im not first but Im early and excited
Ngl this isn't just a theory this time, It's more fact tbh in my opinion
Thank you for covering this. Given how AI art often uses real artists' work without their input or any compensation it is absolutely something to push back against in its current form.
I will get a like for every like I get on this comment.
Mat pat you’ve helped me look at the world through a critical pair of lenses I’ve gone deep down all these rabbit holes and I’ve never been the same since I hope you really know what’s going on and you join the fight for the war on our minds
FINALLY, THEY BROUGHT BACK THE OG FILM THEORY INTRO
This is so nostalgic
Least whimsical thumbnail this channel had ever made
Ironically enough, 30 seconds before the AI started talking I was thinking "Maybe it would be nice if MatPat had his voice AI generated to voiceover the videos?" ... after hearing that voice, I'm less sure of that.
Cant wait for this Half-Truth take before this guy most likely joins the industry himself mow that hes quitting.
I’m hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I missed the intro so much!
Was this uploaded wrong, this video is about AI, not disney propaganda?
We'll miss you matpat, especially your theories about films, games, styles, etc.
MatPat you were my child hood you will be missed 😢
I'm so glad the original intros are finally back after so many years.
Can my comment get a like
mr freeman next!
Og Intro goes CRAZY
God bless you Mat
Kyle hill has a video kinda about that too, big reccomend
Also the debate on how you train AI is mute in my opinion. How to retrain humans to do art by teaching them about the masters of the trade in the history of the form. Humans learn off of consuming other examples and then replicate and improvise it's very rare that somebody comes up with anything brand new anymore if not impossible
7 days until the party
Hello internet, welcome to life theory, the only show that will keep alive for as long as you want by clicking the subscribe button
Film theory! Please make an episode on Pingu.
Inspiration is also theft if ai art is.
MatPat is the GOAT
We will miss you mat 😭😢
Hey Matpat, I have a challenge for you. I saw in your video if Freddy killed Chuck E Cheese at 12:46 an anime figure from the comedy isekai anime Konosuba. Konosuba had a movie back in 2019 called Konosuba Legend of Crimson where at the end of the movie the explosion maniac of the group Megumin had decided to release her final explosion but when using saw that it was amped up by Kazuma the weakest member of their group and sort of love interest. In the final scene we see it from space and how big it was. Wanted to see if you could check how much tnt would be needed to make the same explosion. Bonus challenge if you could also see what it takes for MHA's explosion hero Bakugo to do the same level of explosion.
No se simple game theory thumb nail ever. Also gonna miss you MatPat. 🫡
*Will matpat be replaced by his AI counterpart?*
And the rivalry with the house of mouse lives on. And man am I so happy to hear the classic Film Theory intro! Thank you MatPat, thank you for making theorists out of us. o7
☹️
1301th!
You're my childhood matpat
Never been this early
Cool
time is going so fast…
old intro made me cry
First 5 Minutes
I'll miss you matpat
You’re just realizing that Disney is pumping out propaganda now?
Will miss u man
Omg the old intro too
Considering the many years of Disney support Matpat has given, this is a very surprising upload. Bravo, Matpat, you've truly stuck to your guns, and we respect you for saying what needs to be said. You will be missed.
Crazy well done matpat
Day 109: of asking for a theory on sevenundersouls
hello everyone
MatPat you did make the world a better place, that dream you had when you were in school you achieved it! Thank you MatPat 💚❤💛💙
Please like this comment, I’m desperate 😢
You should do a hazbin hotel theory!
This thumbnail looks like it was from the olden days of you're channel
The old school vibe it hurts
matpat making a joke about housing prices in the beginning IS SO REAL LIKEE  WHY CANT GOVERNMENTS LOOK AT THAT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT T-T
Ruh roh
I hate when people spam a bunch of hearts for some likes, like seriously, matpat retiring is inevitable, go make a video or something if you're truly sad and not spam  here
rw4tyhwa3e
Matthew Patrick you will go down in history as the man that made millions of children think about everything just a little bit deeper...I'm very sad but it's a bittersweet goodbye
I’m watching this on a bus with my school on the way to a Disney Orchestra in Omaha! Hahaha
HE BROUGHT BACK THE THEME!
First time we get to say this. I don’t think this is a theory. I think this is just a fact 🤣
Hi
Wait, WHAT?! You're leaving, MatPat! NOOOOOOOO!
Matpat i will be so sad to see u go away u were our childhood yter ♥

Yes
Me watching the views going from 7 to 10k in 15 seconds
Under 5 mins team 👇
Thank you MatPat for both making and ruining our childhoods❤❤
Mat pat you are the best ⭐
I will miss you MatPat. For the couple of years I have been watching your channels (although I don’t watch all your videos) your content has always been really high quality and really engaging and informative.
The A.I's in the comments saying "I will do 1 pushup for every like on this comment"🤖
Mat really did say, "I'm only doing a few more of these so I'm going to let everybody know what's really on my mind."
Matpat really thinks A.I.'s gonna take his place 💀
Another scary thing is that A.I can be used to generate nudes of people without their consent.
MATPAT DID NOT NEED TO MAKE ME CRY, YOU DID NOT NEED TO BREAK OUT THE OG INTRO 😭😭
I’m going to miss you MatPat! ❤❤
We need a MatGPT to generate theories when team theorist is struggling to come up with new theories. Take notes everyone
The old intro just brings back my childhood. Thank you for everything MatPat.❤️
I thought he stopped being in videos
Mat pat w content
We love you Matt. I truly hope you find happiness and peace giving the channels away. Thank you for every single video that you and so many others put time into. Love you man.
I loved that the AI matpat was Yassified
There is propaganda adds currently on hulu that Israel put up just look them up
Thank you matpat

Why are there so many bots 😭
Me seeing the video title: Yeah um, tell me something I don't know.
Matthew never fails to slob on my knob like corn on the cob
it was all a theory
He's raised an entire generation, now, he will raise his own
If i had a nickel for how many times disney made propaganda cartoons i would have 2 nickels, its not a lot but its wierd it happened twice
Goodbye but we all will remember you
The introoo
I don’t know what I’d do without your videos 😊
Love you MatPat
When I saw the old film theory intro I got so nostalgic I began crying 😢
Bringing back the film theory intro is legendary goodbye matpat

“Add the housing crisis to the next mission impossible movie so that government officials actually take action” is a crazy thing to say but is actually our reality 💀
2:18 I would absolutely watch The Lore Keeper  How do we make this happen???
good to see the old intro back! missed it alot!
God that intro is so nostalgic. We’ll miss you Matpat, but thank you for everything, I wish you the best!
The only film theory video that didn’t ruin my childhood!
25 secs ago??
Will always love you Mr. Patt!
Finally the old intro is back
Why is the thumbnail so low quality?
The old intro 🎆
I will lick one ball for every like I get  Joke
Seeing the classic intro of film theory again is the most wonderful gift you can give us matpat we will miss you. 😢
No, I will not obey
I'm watching every theory until mat leaves.
844 comments after 2 minutes of upload 😮
Disney recently admitted that. They stated they are putting their personal politics first and prodit second and also that it's losing them money.
Yes he brought back the film theory intro let's go!
ROLL THE INTRO

Disney stooping lower than ever before? I can't believe it!

I must not agree, i frequently speak to the voices and they say that it's not a problem
Pls make a film theory on ONE object show, it is like gravity falls
Why is it Disney this Disney that now a days
Og into hits different
Of course they are.
Mike is hetler
I’m not surprised Disney would make propaganda
I see the views changing.
“You could fight say, housing prices” honestly how would that movie even go
That Intro though! 🔥🔥

Best YouTuber

Goodbye.
Farewell matpat and may the force be with you. Hope you have fun with your family
Disney is slowly becoming worse and worse the eventually its going to be one of the most hated brands ever
Sheesh! Hey matpat. You stopping on doing all of theories or only game theories?
It’s been 84 years since I seen that intro
LESS GOOO
I was drawn to this
MY LITTLE MOUTH DROP AT THE INTRO. I MISSED THAT AND DIDNT EVEN REALIZE.
The backyardigans is propaganda
I think we all knew that in the back of our minds, it just took matpat to explain it.
Love how your bringing back your old intros for the end
BUT HEY THATS JUST A THEORY A  FILM THEORY
I love mats film theories
I got here first. Please Pin me.
Legends never die so always remember it’s just a theory a film theory
we gonna miss you bro💯💯❤️❤️
i already busted all over my skibidi toilet poster, mattpatt took me off cooldown and i blew again
Ai scares me 😀

Hi
Funny how we went from Disney to Joe Biden 😭😭 matpat always gets better
They should make a aid version of Matpat so he can keep doing theory’s
I can’t relieve there’s only 7 theories left
IM THE 16TH VIEWER

It’s felt like decades since I’ve heard that old intro 🥲
Matpat, you leaving is actually ruining my childhood.
Five seconds in I made it matpat I made it in five seconds and also I'll miss when your off the channel you can never be replaced
Let go fistt 38sec
