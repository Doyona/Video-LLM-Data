Roger wouldn’t be proud ….
Put wissa in a top 4 side and he is bagging 20 goals a season his finishing is so clinical every time
As the saint's come marching into the championship cause that's where there going this year
Brentford W enable their pursuit for a European Spot whilst Southampton remain bottom of the EPL.....
i want somebody to explain the difference between the Lavia challenge where he escapes a red n Casemiro who got red. they are extremely similar tackles. Refs n VAR are a lottery and cannot be relied upon for objective decision making, thereby they undermine the whole process of refereeing.
No red ? If it was a United shirt instant red
Wissa is decent player and Toney is just unbelievable I’d be shocked if he doesn’t move to bigger club in summer Brentford are having their best ever season incredible team
Imagine taking callum Wilson over toney to the world Cup 😢
Ivan Toney at Arsenal would be insane.
If that was Casemiro instant red ….
How is Lavia's foot going over the ball ANY different from Casemiro's tackle, from which he was given a straight red card? Both of their feet went over the ball after coming into contact with it and then into another player, did they not???
Shocking organisation and defending for that last goal, Southampton deserve to be relegated
OMG this is literally like Casemiros tackle.. 😂😂😂😂no red card 😩
How is Lavia's challenge any different from Casimiro's? By the way I don't think either are straight red cards.
How has labia not got a red but casemiro does soo inconsistent
Why isn’t sky showing the non red card? Same var person as Sunday against united
Good to see Hickey back and playing well!
That was a seriously bad tackle... unfortunate, but it's a Red card challenge
God we are GOOD. 🐝🐝🐝 As a long term Brentford fan seeing us play the way we are and where we are playing it feels absolutely amazing. Love it.😎😎
Southampton are down, they’re garbage
man i watched the game all of you think we won easily we got so lucky
Doctor Tottenham will see you at the weekend saints your all good 👍🏽
Toney shouldn’t even be playing right now after he admitted to all the betting breaches, when is that going to get sorted out.
Wissa is becoming a streets won’t forget player. Always Delivers the goods
Tell me why Lavia's foul is not a red but Casemiro's is?
That wasn’t a red but casemrios was, what a joke, whole country is against United
Betting scandal aside Ivan Toney should be in the England team. Kane spends too much time playing midfield so Toney as the no9, Kane no10, Rashford on the left and Saka on the right. That front 4 would be outrageous with Belligham and Rice behind playing box to box. England should be going full throttle attack against everyone at Euros except France who are the only country with a equally good front line
smarties won 2-0
How is Casie's tackle any different from Lavia's? They're exactly the same but Casie does it and it's a red lmao.
Saints going down
😮🔥👌🏾
Get osimhan and toney man utd....forward line gonna be lit❤
Don't know why the top clubs have not come in for tony
This group of players are exceptional. Well done Brentford, love watching you on MOTD
Toneys got to be the second best striker in the league 😮
Behind haaland toney is the best striker in the league
season leeds were promoted i said Brentford would be Prem top 6 within 4 years wish id have had a bet on it 🤣
Oh to be either a Southampton or a Spurs supporter. A tragedy.
Good stuff
bring Toney to the theatre!
All those Toney goals need taking away and results adjusting. He’s broken some serious rules and will get away with it along with his club. Really poor from the FA to have not got this dealt with instantly.
Another stone wall red card not given but Casemiros was
Red card all day
That second goal is unforgivable from Southampton. What the heck
same talk as Casemiro and nothing. 😂😂😂😂 VAR is trash.
Saints going down. It’s been clear for some time now. Insufficient investment. Quite a few candidates for the other spots.
What a season Ivan Toney is having! From watching him live at the posh to tearing it up in the prem! What a player
The refs who operate VAR in this country are just wack. Rubbish! How can they send of Casemiro but not the Southampton player, who caught the guy studs up on the calf, knew it and pretended to be injured?
If casemiro got a red card how didn't Lavia? It's the exact same tackle and he's left with just a yellow
Two seasons in and this Brentford team is just pure class!
Toney is a different beast man
Brentford are flying
didn't even show our good attempts the 1st half
Going miss him next season large ban incoming
I don't know how Toney is allowed to play in these games. He 's been found guilty of betting on games which has a ban of whatever length, so why is he on the pitch?
Imagine not having Toney in your world cup squad...
Where was this being streamed? Sky Sports or BT?
Two reds not given
The alliteration
The thumbnails are getting bettterr
It doesn't make much sense that Ivan Toney is facing punishment for betting offences, when he and the rest of his team (and most of the Premier League!) are wearing shirts that promote a betting company.
Frank's will be taken off brentford hands buy 1 of the top 6 teams sooner or later 🤑💯
im getting really worried for southampton i cant lie
Great player  shame Newcastle didn’t have more patience with him
So Casemiro gets sent off, but Lavia gets let off for a worse tackle? Refs hate United.
I'm not a man Utd supporter or a Brentford supporter, but someone explain the difference between the challenge that lavia made that didn't get a red card, and the one Casemiro made that against Southampton that he got a red card for.  It's identical, and this is the problem with VAR, it doesn't work properly because the people in charge of making decisions i.e. these referee are not good enough at their jobs.   They can't even draw the offside lines correctly, even though they have several angles of video replay to look at.  It's actually embarrassing for the sport, comparing it to every other sport that uses video technology correctly and efficiently, because the respective officials are competent at their jobs.
Southampton stink 😫
Would be a great Kane replacement  Sorry there I’ve said it
Happy Saints lost after the ref helped them with united
😊well done the bees i see a half empty stadium again, thanks also Gavin we knew you would do a good job under cover!!!! Play up Pompey.
What a season Toney is having, let’s hope he doesn’t end up on the bench for  city next season🤣
That’s a red card 15 years ago, let alone now
Have to say, Brentford played poorly in the second half, in fact so poorly that the biggest highlight of the second half was the VAR check. Saints had chances that seem to have gone unnoticed but then that wouldn't suit the ridiculous headline. Yes Saints are struggling but in the second half they were dominant until Brentford scored in the 97th minute. Just struggling to score sadly. Lack of a decent striker will be their downfall.
Wissa reminds me a bit if mane when at Southampton
Oh yeah that Southhampton tackle with studs out is not a red card but Casemiro one is a red? What is this agenda on Casemiro bro
It's funny to see how much Chelsea have spent during the transfer window an Toney is out scoring any Chelsea player is actually embarrassing from Chelsea coming from a Liverpool fan I should know
Brentford again doing big things
Gotta love the sky sports titles 😂 Sinks Sodden Saints  SSS + pretty much like Brentford’s performance
Bet they wont talk about that Lavia challenge tomorrow. Not even a yellow lol
'It has been all Southampton'...not really, and Raya was barely challenged. Southampton never looked like scoring and I don't think they'll stay up.
How tf aint that a red literally the same as casemiro😂the inconsistency is unreal
Wissa is contractually obliged to only score quality late goals 🐝 ⚽️ 😂
Toney was an Underrated Captain for FPL This week
It’s kinda gone unnoticed that Toney has 16 goals this season. 🔥
THANKS 🤍💛💙
funny casemiro got a red for the same thing.
"tHaT tAkLe wAs eXaCtlY tHe sAmE As CaSiMiRo tAklE"
Not arguing that Casemiro's wasn't a sending off, but Lavia's challenge was far worse, and nothing? Inconsistency of refereeing is appalling.
I keep convincing myself that Southampton arent terrible and they keep proving me wrong. Destroyed at home tonight
If only Toney wasn’t a gambling addict I’d love him at United
Once again, Yoane Wissa the most underrated player in the league.
Is Ivan Toney not getting a ban? Sky sports made a big deal about it  Hopefully Brentford and other clubs remove their bad shirt sponsors
VAR checklist: 1. Is the player's name Casemiro? No - ok play on
Toney should be banned from football taking bribes to score goals 🙄 Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha 😆 😅 🤣 😂 betting on himself lol
Lack of consistency from the referees is a joke, how was Casemiros tackle given as a red card yet that foul goes unpunished 😂
How that challenge from Lavia was not a red is absurd, in comparison to Anthony Taylor’s red for Casemiro doesn’t make no sense. Both won the ball and followed through fair enough but Lavia had his whole studs on him and Case slightly clipped him. VAR is inconsistent and useless
Wakanda forever!
Latvia stays on and Casemiro gets a red card. VAR doesn’t work so scrap it you FA loons.
That was way more a red than cazamiro 🤷‍♂️
Saints have sacked too many managers this season that’s why there losing so many games and can’t find there form
It’s incredible how many years Southampton have managed to stay in the league, whilst selling their best players. But i think it’s time for them to go.. it’s been coming
Similar tackle as casamiro one red this not even checked properly another match another bad referee/VAR performance
So that disgusting tackle gets nothing from VAR but of course casemiros is a red. Honestly just put VAR in the bin if these refs can’t be consistent with it
How’s Lavia’s takle not a red card but Casemiro’s was?
Southampton championship soon
Toneys link up play 😮‍💨
Southampton going where their name suggests ⬇️
They should’ve shown Tony’s yellow card… for attacking the keeper for no reason.
What are the odds of that!
Ivan Toney first goal scorer 5/1 get on hope ivan had a couple of bob on, southampton poor again no surprise when walcott still in the squad finished years ago
Other than Arteta, I'd like to see Frank win manager of the season, he's done a fantastic job
Southampton pushing a very high line, not a good idea with the pace of Brentford
Someone studied sibilance at school
Hate to see it but i think southampton is gettin relegated
If Casemiros is a red then that’s a red too
Saints deserve to go down with defending like that. Absolute sunday league stuff.
nice to see innovative thumbnails
I think United should sign Toney.
That Lavia one should've been a red
Can you imagine the outrage from Brentford fans if Toney played for any other club after admitting he broke the rules, shouldn't be allowed to play.
Red card for Casemiro
wow those are some dead highlights
How is that not a red😂😂😂😂
Ok, so that's not a red while Casemiro one's is a red, ok, vintage prem ref
Please arsenal bring Toney in next season 🙏
Bruh Southampton you had 1 job to do beat Brentford (brighton fan)
Southampton are gone!!
Shame about Southampton they had a good run in the prem tho 😲
Southampton beats Chelsea away,draw at old Trafford but yet lost at home to Brentford..👀
Southampton or draw I will be richer tonight,
Lavia foot rolls over the ball and into the player clearly not intentional, but is a nobody, relegation fodder player = not even a yellow card.  Casemiro foot rolls over the ball and into the player clearly not intentional, but plays for a top 6 side( Man Utd) and has won many things = Red card  Nothing to see here people, definitely no agenda here, no inconsistencies, no targeting, it's not like the var ref that sent casemiro of also sent him of before! Just don't question it! Joke league lmao.
Ivan Toney has 2 more goals and 1 more assist than Rashford, has played two less games and plays for Brentford. Imagine if he doesn't get a chance to play for England again
Brentford are such an underrated team, its crazy.
2:00 Casemiro gets a 4 game ban for that
Qwll done Ivan, the way way to deal with racists
Toney top striker, Thomas Frank top manager. Southampton going down with Bournemouth + 1 more.
Toney must have had a bet on himself to score!🤣
Why hasn’t he got a red card for that clearly had his studs up hm
Not even a yellow foot went over the ball studs into leg wow
That tackle is the exact same that Casemiro did yet he got a red 😂😂 what a joke these refs are
That Brentford kit doesn't look half bad
So can someone explain how studs half way up his standing leg isnt a red and Cassas was a 4 game ban 🤔
Shocking Toney is actually still playing.
Remind how Toney is still allowed to play despite admitting to multiple gambling offences?
Absaloutley shocking similar tackle like casemiro,no card nothing complete RUBISSH WERE IS V.A.R..
Brentford are screwed without Toney.
I have to say how can that not be a red if casemiros is. It’s definitely more reckless
Will Southgate overlook Ivan Toney again? Let's wait and see...
Poor old Scummers😂😂
Absolute disgrace Casemiro gets a red for a challenge with his studs up and this one from Lavia is even worse with his studs up no consistency the english referees are a disgrace and we need ex footballers in the VAR rooms absolute joke
Casemiro got a red for that by the way
About time Southampton went down.
Jwp thought he was becks for a second there
Coyb🐝!!! I do hope the saints stay up though
not a red for lavia but was for casemiro... another inconsistent decision-making situation to add to the ever growing list...
I wish man UTD sign Ivan Toney if we don't get oshimien
Ivan Toney is going to be a big miss for Brentford! Could easily be a top 6 striker
I like the consistency with the refs
Casemiro got a red but Lavia didn't. The same kind of foul. These referees are shocking
saints are going down poor club
Inconsistent refs shocking
Another frustrating game where we were the better team but just lack goals and any kind of threat in the final third
Come on you Beeeezz!!
Toney for England
How is that not a red card but casimiros is no consistency
Wissa is insanely underrated
Calm like Ivan Tony .lots of love on him
brentford has not lost a prem game when they have scored first ever 🔥🔥
Toney out here scoring more than Chelsea have this season 😂😂
Toney got a tenner on Southampton going down to. 😄
I don't like to agree with utd fans too often but the challenge from Lavia on Norgaard is a very very similar tackle as the Casemiro but this one not even a yellow was given... it does beg the question of why are the refs so incompetent and inconsistent?
It’s Crazy how VAR didn’t see that challenge at 2:06 as a red card BUT sent off Casemiro against Southampton. Great work
Toney must’ve had money on himself scoring!
Well in bees 🐝 👊🏼
Watching Wissa celebrate and just thinking NOOO!!! stop sliding towards that rough looking concrete. You'll get sore knees!!!!
Not a Brentford fan but what season they’re having
Beeeeeees my club ❤
Ivan toney not disappointing as always 😍😍😍😍
Toney’s goal is like the perfect set piece
SO CASEMIRO IS A RED CARD BUT NO YELLOW OR RED FOR THIS.
No consistency once again from the referee
Ivan Toney is the maverick that just keeps on giving!!!! Top striker
Brentford showing they are the second best club in London after Barnet
Great Result For Brentford! ❤
Wissa a good substitute player
This years relegation battle is going to be great
You could put money on Toney to score😏
Let's all laugh at liVARpool 😂😂😂
Toney has more goals than in the form of his life Rashford...
Sodden?
Wonder where JWP will be next season
Toney shouldn't even be playing tbh
Another great result for Brentford. Would absolutely love to see them in Europe. Southampton look like they are on their way out!
Another great result for Brentford
I wanna drown myself now, Cheers lads
First boyy
Southampton I think will get relegated this season
IM YOUR FIRST VIEWER
Toney out
First
Ah shucks
