For some reason if you look at 7:34 and many other times you can see on Nicks stream the slurp juice is on the first item slot while the flapjack is on the fourth item slot but if you look at Courages stream they are swapped. It makes no sense since Courages inventory should look the same for Nick since he is spectating Courage.
😂 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵daddy
Icl that’s not a British accent
Courage Guess What          I’ll tell you later😂

I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the burger go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on burger. hail burger. hail burger. The spinning burger, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a burger do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 8:00:00. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on burger. hail burger. hail burger.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 49:30. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.

-Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.   (1 John 5:21) -Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.   (Mark 8:33) -And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.   (1 John 5:20) -After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.   (1 Corinthians 11:25) -What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.   (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) -For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   (John 3:16)

Nobody talking about how nick went in a new game?
I am coming because I am Canadian
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Nick does a great Scottish accent and I can't even do it but that's because I'm quarter Irish and mainly British because I'm English

You think the United States of America is better than Canada!?  You’re all about freedom down there, do you have the freedom of not getting shot!?  Do you have the freedom of abortions! The USA doesn’t even know what a an African country is,that’s right! Africa and Europe are continents NOT countries, although Canada is not great, the us is worse.

Yo CouRageJD I would love it if you could run to duos with me one time
28:07  dude ate the wall 😂😂😂😂
EH 30....as a Texan you need to know we like Canada. But never do a Southern accent again. Keep up the good work.
Eat worlds spiciest chip
Just watched sypherpk react video and I'm not convinced this is nick eh 30 and not him
WTF is happening between these two 😂
Now way he said Captain America skin 🤦‍♂️
I wonder if I can beat courage in a 1v1
Yeah nick cheated he had two games when he was telling courage to give him a challenge it switched games after he did the american accent and his kills changed
Courage controller i need that
Your the king in the king😮
Btw i got a myth: if you get one raptor and get another one they will fight to death
😦
Can you and me
1v1 me please
Watch up to 16:42 and you will see it cut when there is more people then before, the scenery is different and he had less kills! Nick eh 30 probably died right after that and they tried to be slick because they didnt want to loose that footage but they wanted it to be a close game because before he only had 3 or something so Nick eh 30 did something wrong and they wanted it to slide under the rader by just continue speaking, like nothing happened and it was the same round but it was not and Nick eh 30 at the end said this is so easy. No offense Nick but maybe for someone who died 2 times in the whole video and tried to make it look like he did not the second time. Plus, he started the second clip with 30 or more but before it was 20 something so that means that courage gets a longer video. I see you Nick and Jack. Your not gonna trick me to think that Nick found this so easy and that he got the right amount of kills just like that in that one round and that that was one round because it was 2 and 2 clips of 2 different games for Nick, i see you content creators doing this a lot and Im here to say that Im not falling for it, acting like you can just play and talk again as if it was the first clip when it was the second clip in the 2 game. Nice try but you didnt trick me!
15:58
If you check Nick got 2 games because after American accent he lost a kill and more people were still in the game
9:16 Nick cursing
i accidentally twerked, said couragejd in his head
I’m just watching this now, I’m so bad for not hitting Nick in the head
