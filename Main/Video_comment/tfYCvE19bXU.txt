Tune into the live feed now to see Ruby and Tye's Ranger in action! - https://frdmplus.com/
Its a truckamino it was built for truck stuff
6 7
Darn it your in a real pickle this time man brother we gotta get the right set up
hard parked mullet complete
jaw drop on the perfect 8.5
Where do you live I want to meet up?  I'm your biggest fan bill in Marshall Dylan.❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The only thing louder then the exhaust on the cars is rubys belt squeal
Thought this was listed today.  I was like wait.. why is the smx in it lol
I am seriously bummed for you cleetus , rotten luck mate 😢
James reaction time is amazing thats all I can say.
Mullet did 220 m.p.h. in 6 seconds?! "HOLY CRAP!" "THAT'S FAST!"
I can’t believe how absolutely dialed RUBY is. She’s always ready to rock. JACKSTAND is going to be hard to beat if they can even run close to that time for the rest of the week. As for Mullett good thing he had them fancy brakes because good golly were they needed. Rotors were glowing
crazy coming back to this vid 1 year plus later when Sam is now running 9s lmao and he was happy with a 13 second pass here.
Seems like it's time to get bigger/thicker chutes
Ruby said hold my e85 ive got this😅.
Ruby is the best car on the channel. Sorry it’s a fact. Maybe not the favorite but the best.
Well this will have to do until sick week 2025 episodes come out
over a year and 180 videos in a row with over 1 million views. HELL YEA BROTHER
You need to put your parachutes higher in the air
Mullets first pass on sick week and instant spin and wheelie! Calm down mullet 😂❤   Let’s go Ruby! Such a good girl u are
Thank you TBM
Mullets 2stepch, id say because its super cold air and a warm engine youd get a small ice build up in the turbocharger..
Does the Ranger have a Coyote in it?
Would be cool if you could remind us what the set up is when it comes to the line.
I like how there’s cup holders in a drag car
Here’s a list of all their drag cars mullet,eagle,ruby,McFlurry,blazer,Leroy,ranger,
17:03 6 7 you say
what an IDIOT
Every time I comment, people on YouTube are jerks to me… so please be nice, I just have a quick question about how the race times work… if you are all in different classes, and have different times and goals for the week, how do you compare them and decide who won overall… sorry, I just don’t understand how that works… please help. Thanks in advance…
19:12 hell of a ride
Tuck that hoody in the waist band.
That's weird I have a class where you can go as fast as you can
I’m still amazed that 6 second cars can drive from event to event. Amazing.
19:28 those TBM brakes are glowing and putting in the work😂
15:41 whats the green rags for thats being held over sams tailpipe??
James is a heck of a good drag racer.
jackstands solid solid rip line needs to be on a shirt at this stage..he says it every time he finishes a run..
What I seem to notice,and I may be wrong, but cleetus seems to do good with a group,then, he dumbs them, or stops filming g with them as much hurt their channel,not getting as much attention,even though some of the channels are better, I love this channel, but he split with Steve morris sucks because Steve is so freaking g cool, smart,and really knows he stuff, so I wish he would drag along with the greats like Steve, I get the nascar, and he bought be back to watch it, but I know how big of a draw it is to be seen with the old school OG drivers from the 80;90’s,and mid 2000’s and hanging with dale jr, is a huge draw, but don’t front the little guys pls, they were a great part of the channel.😊
Nice driving.
Look at that sun set when the ranger made its 3rd hit beautiful
What year and model is your car
Won't be able to drive out of that in Mullet after CJR gets done with it! Love going back and watching
A spin, a wheel, then a 7.15 at 226?   Christ sake that car is on another level
21:15 Guy is such a know-it-all - can't let somebody have a proclamation without trying to hijack the moment?
The ranger doesn't look like it's running down the strip straight. Like the suspension is loose or something
I can’t wait for mullet to be rebuilt
If Ty’s a racer I’m Mia Khalifa
If anyone was wondering why they need parachutes to Stop, this video is why lol
17:01 future TikTok edit
Cleet was goin so fast in Mullet His hair went out like the Tide
They never have enough sand at the end of the track
26:59 just wait till you see lumberjack
Fing race cars
Excuse my statement of the obvious, but expensive toys don’t belong in the sandpit, Cleet!
Damm those brakes are burning hot
Good things mallet is part truck
Is it me or cleatus got alittle upset ,jelous ,couldn’t admit jack its a better racer than him ..,sorry bro but flooring it does not make you a racer .now jack knows how to use the pedal never seen his wheels spinning or doing  out of control wheelies both are good racers  (pedal rule  75% 80%85%100% smooth ,solid & strong). …SSS
Good thing cleet can drift his drag cars
Mullet with the smx was the best!
Sam is a LEGEND!!!
Sucks Brother, Mullet was ready for another Trophy. Sick Content Gentlemen, keep up the awesome work. From Aotearoa New Zealand
Mullet is usually very reliable.
When drilling through carbon or fiberglass always run the bit backwards for the pierce and gently step it up to final dimensions it makes life easier when its a one shot deal to make the hole perfect
du bist voll auf Koks !!!! mit 4 Mio. Abos .geht das wohl ?
First time seeing someone tuck their hoodie in.
My dad as a huyabuse it's amazing motorbike
i wish we got to see more from Jack Stand, seems like he's been getting the short end of the stick the past year or so, really hope he's doing good.
Noone cares that america is destroyed by a hurricane, unlucky lads
Best drag strip I know
Hi what prop size please
I’ve never been so excited to watch someone run an 8.500 except when Leroy was dipping into the 8s for the first time😅that was INSANE!!!
9:33 JS hitting a 8.500 is insane 🤯
I love that there's a fire just blazing behind the tree line and nobody ever said a word.
That’s racing.
Do they have a agree!ent with police or something because there's no way there street legal
I mean, if there is ever a good ad for TBM brakes its this lol
Ah, so this is when Mullet was running 2 gears, 1st and 3rd
Is what it is buddy. Mullet will shine once again in the future. I think it's ruby's time to shine lol again.
@3:10 2-step check into the race fuel jug lol
DO IT FOR DALE!!!! "3".. iv only seen my father cry once... the day he went into the wall, i saw him cry.. he was a huge fan of Dale.
glad your okay bro it is nice to see you get out in your own power brother stay safe out there
was this on night of fire?
dam dude u r defintely a all american home bread luv yea
Anybody know the breakout speed for parachute mandate?
RIP bracks
I think kevin was driving on the edge 😅
To spare you time he crashed at 17:30
You and the screw drivers in the drink cups scare the crap out of me! Gosh for bid something happens and you have a screw driver flying around looking for a "HOME"
Those brakes when he slammed the brakes where glowing red
Omg ur brakes were on FIRE 😮 DANG IM JUST GLAD U GOT IT STOPPED AN UR OK. GOOD JOB BROTHER THANK GOD U GOT ALL THAT DRIVING EXPERIENCE. Sorry about ur car an keeping a spare on hand is smart.
Jackstand nailed rubys first run 😊
Co😂
Diet bussy diet more
:49 I’ve never broken a pushrod or lifter so. Jinxed it
Funny how us car guys have a “wifes car”
Tell me how you have my dream life building drag cars have money drag racing the whole 9 yards
Holy fucking amazeballs 1 late chute and one amazing fukin driver got that big ass truck stopped from 220 at the end of the run way that's insane!
Ruby dependable as ever.
Watching those brakes was wild!
Thank goodness for the end, love the good old auction car still as steady as a rock.
Ranger had a 10 all day rear was way to stiff
The queen of bracket racing is BACK BABY
I was so fired up when I seen 850 with an O
You can see how warped the brakes are at the end hahaha crazy speed.
Ive never seen Jackstand so fired up, lolol. I love Ruby, especially with Jackstand driving.
U should take mullet to this vs that or Leroy
I love how Steve was picking out a handful of parts to give Cletus and thinks about it and has him take the case, like he thought to himself that he wasn’t running his smx so might as well
The face Jackstand made when you said " Yeah with my tune" at the end of the video was priceless lol
Bro you melted them disks down haha  Excellent save!
You guys have to set a race up with farm truck
My BRUDDA WE NEED MULLS TIRES ON HEAT WARMERS TO GET ER STARTEED... THOSE TIRES SHOULD HOLD YALL CHECKN TIRE TEMPPS BEFORE AT THE LINE
Eagle tallon as the new build for a mullet replacement. Put that SMX in a eagle talon. And let the eagles loose!!!!
Hope you get the guy who sold you the bad transmission fucked!!
This is cool
Cool
19:31 bro's brake on fire
I think I’m sold on them tbm brakes cause damn man
When are we going to see mullet again
HELL YEA BROTHER
Take a shot anytime someone says dialed in
Yeahhh Sam! Ripping that f150 as fast as my Evo x in a quarter
0:54 “imma let you take this whole case” Steve is cool asf he looked through it and said i dont need any of this rn and gave him a couple thousand in parts for free
I love the do it for Dale
Squirrel and Jack stand are the best co-hosts for any youtube channel ever made
The orange sky behind the ranger staging looks sick
The belt squeel. Oh GM. We love you.
Sick run, Brother. Badass!
Off-road pic is a 2025 calendar shot 🎉
you gonna make vents/heat extractors for the rotors?
Pro tip idk if yall do this or not but i drive semis and when we have to brake real hard real quick we use the stab brake method you just stap the brakes real hard then on and off quick then hold them idk if yall do this or not but it might help braking at short distances
Wow.
Once I rewatched this video it was obvious the trans was hurt that MPH at that ET doesn’t resemble anything mullet has done up until this point
That sucks, great video tho. Ruby rips
What kind of sunglasses these  dudes wear? I'm digging Jackstands who makes em?
is it just me or do i feel like cleetus has every vehicle produced in the world?
Do I spy with my little eye a Ford Festiva in the background at 1:21 ?
Somewhere around 25 years ago, I took my '94 Cavalier Z24 to the local strip for some bracket racing. First time I'd ever been there, so I had no idea what I was doing. I showed up too late to have set a time, but I'd done some internet sleuthing about what times my car should make, so I just plain guessed for my breakout time. I guessed 15.8 seconds. My best run was 15.805. It still blows my mind how lucky I was lol.
those brakes are probably welded to the pads…
I applaud you Jackson sick run!!  little late to the party
Can swap onto the ff truck definitely, sell everything you don’t need
"why not both🤷‍♂️" Build em both up.
I'd love to see mullets power plant in Mcflurry! Talk about a monster
Hear me out now mullet the sand dragster ?
TBM brakes look so gimmicky but damn do they perform well
Pull everything on the drivetrain and inspect. The u joints need a helecopter parent as does the rear gears, get a visual on those. P.s if you need a place to store Toast, I’m here for you.
Seeing Mullet at 234mph is my dream. A lot of positive vibes for the gear vendor from Australia!
8.500 OFF THE TRAILER is insane
Yeah lost grip first run.
Cleetus IS good Job 💪🏻💪🏻
Awesome job drive that beast go kick some ass and keep it straight Cleetus
What is happening in the background? All the smoke rising?
What in the actually fuck. Spinning and wheelie and still pulled a 225
Steel Crüe
I wonder if Cleet called the guy back and told him that trans is cooked. If he got his money back?
I love that ranger
Jackstand is a machine 🤖
I happened to catch some B2 action in the live stream but never saw it in videos. Any updates on that?
Maybe it’s time for a rossler 🤷🏼
19:24 I love how you see the brakes getting red hot
GameStop Buy!  GME!!!!  🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢
The air under the center of that long deck lid is bad. Air moving over the body creates a low-pressure area in the middle of the backend. This becomes a big problem at speeds over 300, but it can happen at speeds less than that under the right conditions. This is why we experimented with chute placement on funny cars in the late 90s. Moving the chutes to positions on the outside of the rear deck will fix the problem. The air on the outside of the body is cleaner and gives the chutes a better chance to develop without getting tangled.
That fella that does the tune for garret you can tell he is sutch a nice dude
Racing is all about lessons….. Now you know what needs to be done for Mullet…. I wish you the Ultimate Best in the future….👍🏾💯
00Jackstand! So incredible!
Man those brake were cookin!
Ya put up a hell of a fight includinig that beautifu skid stop barely into the sand...loved the whole video - thank you!
🤫🐌 5:26 🐌🤫
That Ranger looks terrified when in 2 step 😂
anyone else pause off the bat to see if it was the fire alarm in your house? xD
I'm sorry Mr. Belaire , Rocket Man is here to leave you on the launch pad.
You can build a transmission to hold that power level and be bullet proof. But it would weigh a ton, cost $50,000.  The trans you have from M&M is a good balance of reliability, durability Vs cost.  A spare trans isn’t a bad idea. And maybe a spare converter and input shaft?
Thank you for fixing George's volume!!! I quit watching cause I couldn't take his volume being way louder!🎉🎉🎉
Automatic Transmission Design builds some solid transmissions. Especially 400s
This should be a great lesson for you to wake up and learn from your experience That you can't drive anything Not even a broken go-cart !!!!
I will be lookin for you if you go to Gainesville
Hey cleet, maybe it’s time for bigger brakes buddy and antilock system, was a close call
I love the ranger bro
Get a rosslers trans out of Philadelphia
great save bro
Jesus christ bro yall build some monsters that shit is redonkulous hahaha
Go go roughty ranger 🎶
Take off that Mf ing hitch before you die!
That dirt stopped that shit quick
Holy shit mullets power wheelie I love it
Nice run Ruby!!!
Thats to bad 😢you guys try realy hard
5 drag strips in 5 days?!!! Here in NE we have one for the entire region.
the wives LOVE stuff like this.....send it brother.
Mullet out there doing truck stuff. He saw the dirt and had to remind you that he was still a truck
Dude I love watching y’all’s sick week videos!!!  Never disappoints
America needs more Mr. Sam and less Taylor Swift
Jorge better use protection, his ole lady be mad he come home preggers from cheeks ridin cleets peet so much
Damm mullet is down! 😩🥲another loss but it’s alright we got this. 💪🏼💪🏼yeah I would say a spare transmission would be a good move. It’ll definitely help it last a little longer!
Random thought for Cleetus and the team: Ruby is the real OG u can’t just put it in auction or scrap yard. It’s one of the original cars u started with. It’s too real. If y’all really don’t want to run it at least let it be a show car or display car.
Video paused currently at 10:40.....how in the hell did James call that time perfectly from in car. That man is made to drag race just like our boy cleeter, I swear he is just so good at it. Living Legends in the making
Smart move not running that loaner trans, woulda been on the hook for a rebuild on that one too
Support
Why the steel front end back on mullet???
Cleeters drifting  skills  definitely  helped bringing  mullet to a  stop
Mullet loves chewing on m&most. Is there  a stronger transmission to be had that can take the entire barn of horses and last a couple years?
Oh shoot where is my chute …this should be a movie at this point…
I’m,,,, glad everything was good, that was crazy,off the end onthe track,you should have a lunch flags for the parachutes and get rid of that trailer hitch, right, thanks BigAl California.
This incident means mullet is now officially the fastest off road vehicle in the world.
Heat them tires up fellas. Can't take em with ya lol.
ruby stand on business
Getting close to alcohol funnycar numbers we were running 15 years ago...really nice job driving and not letting it start bouncing too much
PLAY WITH POOP LONG ENOUGH AND YOU GIT  SUM ON YOU.
Not that scary.......shaking my head......
Whoever sold you that transmission is a POS, they 100% knew that transmission was shot.
Well, time to put some money on GOOD breaks... I'm pretty sure Youtube will give you that, LOL...
Anyone else want to see the mullet participate in NPK?
Can get a toot toot Can i get a clete clete
Love seeing all the guys getting turns driving racecars.
hoodie tucked in, CHECK!
Garrett try sucking un your harmonic balancer a little it might stop the squealing that Ruby gas been cursed with. I'm not sure your issue or why she is doing it but I thought it might help. I'm sure you guys have tried to find out why it is squealing and you probably already know. I just fixed a car that would stop no matter which many belts they tried.
The driver skill is unmatched
Bummer
Yall will figure it out
Very cool to see how far you've come in 5 years cletus and gang!  Thanks for the entertainment!
Sorry to see that!! Still got the rest of the crew rock it. RUBY !! WHAT A PERFECT PASS! HELLL YEA BROTHERS!
Well that sucks 😢 mullet gets some upgrades 😮😮😮
Maybe it’s time for a rossler. Carl has been building and perfecting his transmissions for 43 years and racers are running them behind 3500+ hp engines reliably. Maybe it’s time for a change. Now I am not knocking M&M I am just saying rossler has been around awhile longer and Carl is extremely passionate about making sure his quality and reliability are more important then profit. He is consistently looking for ways to improve performance.
Glad you’re Oka is the main thing 💪🏾‼️
Good thing you have great brakes lol. Glad it worked out
Just a quick lil offroad sesh, nun too whimsical
TBM brake sales just plummeted into the toilet 🚻 😳 😂 🤣
Sam is THE dude. F yes Sam!!!!!
9.30 min+3min is the next GOAT YT George moment since 'accidently' blown up truck at Jeremys shop. Those days I mean, yep. Squirrel... Jack StandJimmy aswell. I cryied for a bit.. George - Completly rusted, like there is a chunks of metal👏 rusted into the cylinder wall...I show you... ❤
Ruby don't miss!!!... Never has and I don't think ever will 😂
Kinda mind blowing to see how fast those brakes start to glow
It should be illegal for me to get an ad in the middle of a mullet two step check !
Man! Not the trifecta gold I was hoping to see a thumbnail in a few days but, considering how bad things could’ve went thumbnails can wait! Glad you are alright
Always have a spare
Highboy that elco  Problem solved
Off road in the Mullet.😂😂
Honestly cant believe you dont carry a spare transmission and this point. Or 2
I would have thought you would have carried a spare Trans and Pumpkin and Converter , in your Kit when you make that kind of Horse power .
Damn nice run RUBY
Sam racing in the ole “I know my truck” class
Why don’t you do it for dale anymore Cleetus?
HOLY CRAP they put the hood on Ruby!!
Vette goes very smooth and nice !
Those brakes were red hot! Glad you got it shut down.
Jimmy dale!
It sux that Mullet is out, but thats racing Brother. Congrats on Jackstand, THE perfect run.
havent seen one of your videos in a couple years and youtube decided i should again
Can we get a mullet in the dirt shirt? !!!
I would be pissing and moaning whatca good attitude i need to take notes
Them tbm brakes coming in clutch
Lots of silly fun and games but damn you can freakin drive. That was a smart move. 🔥🙌🏻   Crazy!
Why does mullet have the steel front end back on her?
What happened to Mullet's carbon fiber front end?
Where are we going?
That was BIZZAROS pizza in Melbourne beach
15:04 brush fire in the background?
Good stuff!
Those brakes were roasty!😮😮😮
Daaaaamn.....bummer mate. At least you still have skin in the game (Ruby), and it should be a good trip regardless....race cars are a cruel mistress.
That stop looked like Cleeter was downhill skiing in a car lol
Back brakes were glowing red you got her stopped though
I don’t like to comment much, but the white walls on MULLET look sweet!!
Mullet left this competition with a bang, and the shutdown field was cool to witness.  Now George is no longer the only one driving into fields 😂
noooooooo not mullet
Dannit man but it be alright  Ruby gonna do it 😅
Only cleet would add some drifting""""  at the end of a 1/4 mile run. Glad you are SAFE brother! You paid dues along time ago. Im glad to see the shop guys having fun.  Ty with the ranger and jack stand with George in ruby! I love it you guys have created a TIGHT crew.
Transmission aside. Just glad you’re ok after that parachute mishap. Can you run it without the ball hitch? Also, let’s not start any videos talking about a wreak.
You need a super heavy duty transmission cooling setup
Why aren't they using Mullets fiberglass front clip?
It never freakin' ends! Jackstand in Ruby, Tye's Ranger and Mr Sam's F150 carry the torch to the next track!
Couple hours into the family BBQ, I always do a 2-Step check.
COngrats on the perfect pass Team, nice save Cletus.
I HAVE A NEW RACE IDEA. Drag race to rally😂
Hey Cleetus did you have a laundry problem after that pass , thankfully you didn’t get hurt or your car good save
At the end of the day, Mullet is still a truck XD crawled right out of the mud and gravel.
Bro really gave you a broke trans.... he was setting you up brother
the discs wow 19:35
Heck, mullet is making so much power a transmission forged by Thor himself would have its hands full! Love the content man!
You're long passed needing a spare transmission,  after all,  how many other vehicles of yours have you trashed the transmissions in😂
The sun shines on a dogs a** every once in a while!! Hell ya! come on! Jack stand great job brother!! Great job!!
Mullet threw a fit cuz he didn’t have his carbon
Man, you need a T-shirt that says “Gravel Gremlin” 100%!!!
Hate to sound like a Monday morning quarterback but the trans issue irks the heck out of me. When you know SICK week is coming, which will put more wear on your car than a regular event, you HAVE to go over all the major components of your car if you want to compete. Testing with Pete should have been a sign the trans wasn't 100%. That trans fluid was like black oil. That's neglect folks. Still, I love Cleet and crew.
Let’s gooooo Ruby ❤
Take the twist out of that ranger! Add some structure!
I cant wait until cleetus hits the 5khp mark and starts running mid 5s
I can see mullet going pro mod in 2 years.
That “yeaaaaaaahhh” of cleet hype me up everytime🔥🔥
First time i've seen Jackstand fired up like this :)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah brother. That's so sad to hear Mullet is out of the competition. I was rooting for you Cleetus. Good luck to the rest🎉
Holy fuck bro, Cleetus is a driver. What a save good fucking job mate. Hats off
I’m gonna need to get my hands on that Cleetus Carhartt hoodie!
Perfect pass on Ruby’s first race back. She’s making a point, she ain’t going up in the rafters or out in the barn no more. That girl belongs on the track
cant help but be nervous for cleet with that screwdriver in the cupholder bouncing around at 226mph 😂
Wouldn't live up to its name if it didn't do a lil off-roadin!
Hell yeah brother !! Stay safe !!
I was so fired up when James and ruby ran that 8.50….. wow… good job boys 👍🏻
I wonder if that dig into the dirt did anything to the tranny.
Cleet is one hell of a driver!
use a deeper wing cord plane/glider as the force that the pole pushes up against the plane above it. It might act like a shock absorber stretching the wave length of the oscillation over a longer time.
Ruby doesn’t wanna go back in the barn brother
Amazing save by an amazing driver. Awesome to watch!
sweet car control into the hockey slide! looked bad from down track but you kept cool
Need to have the other seat out will do a 5 sec
mullet be better off road than a cyber truck 😂
HELL YEAH BROTHER 6.73 AND SAVED MULLET, GLAD YOUR OKAY 🙏
Algorithm Comment Hgtrwwpmng
Mullet is that hero car. It absolutely rips, especially with that new suspension.
Reliability goes out the window at 3k hp 🤘🏼rock on guys killer video 🤙🏽great save with sliding into the sand trap 👌🏽
holy crap 8.500?!?  I was excited when we went 8.51
Hell of a save into the gravel Cleet.  I have always hated that shut down area.  Way too short for the high speeds.  Great job TBM brakes!  Wish you could have continued.  :(
Ruby was so mad being in that barn she showed her best to show her speed. 8.500! She hated that barn
"I hope you guys break down."     I laughed so hard at that.
To bad that guy sold you a lemon of a trans. Tough break. Youll get em next time
Mullet has some more in it!... Sounded like it layed down a bit towards the end..
Sorry to hear about mullet. Wish you could choose the lesser of two weevils 😂 and get on to the next stop. I'm sure lots of folks with a spare would love to help your team out! You guys can't put in a new transmission and get a late run in? Just asking, I really don't know what all you guys have to go through.
Like if you thought your fire alarm was going off
Yikes!😮
I’d drop the transmission back in, and send it… meanwhile getting someone to Uber your transmission to you so by end of day you can have a good transmission waiting to drop in…
Ruby standing on business
Jack stand jimmy with the ICE IN HIS VEINS
Mullet is not a sandrail.......I repeat Mullet is NOT the sandrail.....lol..... glad  your ok!!
GREAT SAVE BROTHER! damn
Enjoyed watching y'all role through Vero the other day.
Damn damn damn and with that last run that was so fast I'm sure you would have had first place with mullet
Jackstand putting the pressure on em
I know a guy with a wagon who u could ask to borrow his transmission
After watching btm brake's save a car i am thinking about a upgrade 1972 nova front  Ford 9 inch rear.
Man that sucks.
See you in mango Florida did not know it was you untill I saw this video you were behind the school bus while my son was getting off pissed I did not realize it was you I knew the car looked familiar definitely just made my day
Time for a rossler
I think it’s time to start taking the hitch out, in track mode. Nice save!
Awe such a bummer Cleetus.  Love Mullet, what a beast!!! There was no hiding how utterly bummed you were.
I mean, there's no better place to have to concede defeat than at home in your own shop... Better than it going to hell a LONG ways from home!
thank the car gods he had that 4link cause if he were to do that manuver without it? it probs flip the car GOD BLESS CLEETUS
I know the chutes failed but DAMN that was arrow straight. Glad you're alright cleeter
Also, I really wish I had kept my 95 Ranger Super with an extended cab longbed so I could've yanked that 4.0 and put a Coyote with a turbo because it would've hauled AAAAYYYYSSSS!
Hell fuggin yeah James!!!
Man Garrett, I am really glad that you and Mullet are OK after that. I seriously got scared when I heard the sirens. 6.73 at 220 MPH!? That was an AWESOME run brother!
Those TBMs were GLOWING!!!
More than 7 years in racing but you don’t have a spare 😃😃
9:33 GODLY
Actually glad you called it off for Mullet. After seeing those brakes glow, and as fast as you trap, I hope for everyone's safety that you at least replace the pads.
Wow... that chute not deploying proved your level of awareness/driving skill. I've NEVER seen anyone threshold brake like that before. That was crazy to see. It doesn't cross 99% of people's minds in real life and death scenarios but once again, that was awesome!
What happened to mullets full carbon front end?
Dude just grabs his wife’s fully built drag car lol kind of wealthy I’m trying to be
That racing. Sh*t breaks.
Thank God you had good brakes and did some difficult
Alright but can we get a Steve morris collab shirt with just “thanks buddy”
Tough break man. Get em next time.
Nice work getting it stopped Cleet. Hell ya.
Get your tail out between your legs and show us what ruby,ty and Sam are doing..its sad that your not in it we don't get a video
Good Lord Cleeter! Glad youre ok! Way to handle it! TBM Brakes FTW!
This is said it's 8pm and we don't have a video of ruby, ty, sam...  get your shit together your done racing so you have all the time in the world to edit and share each day
I hate seeing Cleetus this depressed. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. Well, it's part of racing, but man does it suck. Good luck on the other vehicles. Hey, Ruby is the only car, so maybe we learned something.
Atleast your smileing
If I ever build anything I'm putting TBM Brakes on it I don't care!! 2nd time I've seen those brake do absolute unbelievable work!!
Them tbm breaks for the life!!!
19:04 countersteering slowing down that fast with one hand inches from the wall is actually crazy, some serious driver mod right there Cleetus
Stop fucking around and do something with street racing channel!!!
SAM
Yea brother nice save
Great job jack stand
Awe, man, bummer about the transmission
Dang ty why the long bed!?
James is the iceman
Cleetus, did you ever consider using a Monte Carlo SS front end to help with aerodynamics? I know you said your  fighting that with Mullett.
Cleetus McFarland could would make snow cones out of a hail storm.   Never ceases to amaze me how well this man handles adversity.
These tbm break ads are getting insane
It’s so was cool meeting you today!
I’m planning on bringing my 1988 BMW Vixen XC next year… we runnin in the same class as Sam
Stuff nice driving, pucker factor 10 love the rear shock camera shot.
What happened to the carbon front end
That's why i never race at the track in my area Yellow Belly cause the shutdown is to short and u have to turn a sharp left.
That absolutely sucks about mullet
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Need to invest in a transmission like Steve  and tom run with the smx combo and if its the same wait for them to go to sleep and borrow theirs 😂
The mullet is music
Handled that car like a boss most people would panic
seems like you shifted into neutral before the end of the run and them brake discs were REDDDD HOTTTTT. awesome driving 🔥🔥🔥👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Sent that MF and has the experience to stay calm and get Sh** done! That was one hell of a run and a save
That’s a shitty but when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade
When are we gonna see mullet hit a 5.99? It’s about time you guys hit up Sonny’s for a motor and put together a TT 903.
Oh man! I did not see that comming!!! MULLET!!! NO!!! @#$#@#$##@#$$#@$$##$$$$##@#$###$#$$@#$##$$#$$@#$$#$$%$##$$%$$$$$. OH THE PAIN, OH THE PAIN!!! SO SORRY BRO 😢
When you can't see Tye's beard because of his helmet he looks like a school kid?
Let’s see the Supra on the road trip Cleet
Looking really good guys ❤💪🇱🇷
Bagger, better, faster, stronger  He will be back
Really??? NO BLAZZER??? WHATS GEORGE LOOSING HIS PASSION FOR WHEEL STANDS? BRING BACK THE BLAZZER!😂
People ask why you watch racing on youtube. You see a real racer get rattled. You can see his hands shaking. A real guy and real racer.!!! GO MULLET!!
Hell of a save on mullet!!!!! Them TBM brakes were smoking
@11:10 dude I was cheering at home, my wife looks at me like WTF 🤣🤣🤣
What happened to the carbon fiber front end?
Put a livery on toterhome and trailer it would be cool
talk about not even needing to use fake click bait😱😱 at least mullet isn’t totaled…
Those brakes were putting in WORK! TBM for the win!
19:02 great driving cleet could’ve been worse
the rangers whole front clip shaking apart on the 2 step😂😂
Garret, when are you going to show my face in a video? Are you embarrassed of me? You treat me like the Sloth in Goonies. lol
Now I know why you didn’t show the guy who sold you the Trans! Here you go! I’ll sell you this destroyed Trans to replace your hurt one and charge good money as I know you’re desperate.  Did he have an eye patch, a wooden leg and a Parrot on his shoulder?
You'll get them next year Cleet!
THOSE TBMS WHERE GLOWING
Mannn those TBM brakes were COOKING! Sick to see those puppies in action!
That was a really cool shot of the brakes.
That’s insane! How scary it would be headed into the sand
You should invite the DDE lads to race at the freedom factory
Noooo! Mullet!
Cleet got so lucky at the dirt, could have rolled there easyily...
19:30 those brakes look hoooooooooot
In the words of Jeremy Clarkson, Some poo has come out!
Them brakes being uuuuused 😮‍💨
Ruby kills it every time!
Wild ride!!
Props for handling your car well. You looked calm and collected the whole way into the sand. Being a pilot is paying off already it seems 😂
Mullet with big white letter tires is sick looking.
Man had that 1 chute not come out this would’ve been super ugly! God was watching over him for sure!
Så synd at mullet måtte bryte 😢 håper ruby vinner sin klasse 👍😁😁 Good luck from Norway 🇸🇯
Didn’t think I’d see anymore of ruby but she’s back!!!
George, turning the camera around was freaking awesome! Love seeing the excitement on your face!
Sorry about that, best wishes to the rest of the team!!
So about that Fiero...
That’s why it’s a car and a truck
LETS GO SAM!!!!
Glad you are safe Cleet.
You should race at the maple grove track in Pennsylvania
Mullet: I fucked it up damn it.  Ruby: I gotchu big dog.  Proceeds the most epic run at 8.50 with an o
Ruby does NOT want to go back into that barn lmao 🤣
Damn. That freakin sucks man. I'm sorry mullet had to go out like that. And what a pro at bringing that Bullitt to a stop with no damage Garrett I'm impressed.  Ruby you beauty great run!
Anyone see what looked like chunks out of the glowing rear brake discs or is there something I’m missing?
Ruby said I'm not going back in the barn!!!!! Hell yes brother!!!!!!!
Good call! I am sorry it happened but like you say, "That's Racing".
Mullet needs bigger chutes! LOL
Great driving cleat keeping it calm in not calm situations
Hell yeah brother......... Freakin cool brother......... New merchandise so cool......... Greetings from india 🇮🇳🤠🤠🤩🤩🤘🏻🙌🏻🇺🇲God bless america 🇺🇲🇺🇲
Nice calm there at the end of the run there. No panic despite shoot issues!
This is ruby's redemption year. She going to make everyone happy this year
you win some and you lose some man it’s how the race life goes
Cleetus is an insane driver omg this man has some big balls😮
ruby came out swinging huh
Maybe get rid of the lose stuffinthe cab!
Snot rocket less HP more MPH.
Id still like to see Steve and Pete do a Drag and Drive together - not sure how they would mesh but I bet it would be interesting.
this was top notch entertainment
Where is the Blazer? Did that thing burn to the ground ??
The fence was callin his name !
Just hear Cleeter yell woaa! 😂
The under truck camera shot with the breaks lit up was crazy. Glad you're safe brother
Nah who tf gave Cleetus a f’d up transmission!! You know they knew it wasn’t good to begin with that’s crazy
i love that garretts instant reaction isnt fear that he nearly wrote off mullet it was a cheer that he didnt
Dang sad to see Mullet go. Great video Cleet
It will never be as fast a Jeff ‘s car
Imagine just driving down the road and see mullet next to you 😂
Put me in that passenger seat cleetus!!!
I was most impressed on the f150’s 13.7’s
Just stopping by to say thanks for the fantastic live feed of Sick week it's been a blast watching everyone.
Wow, that sux about Mullet. Love watching its progress. Let's hope the other cars do well. Ruby couldn't have done better. Good luck everyone...
Sucks You and Mullet are out.
Are we taking the pitchforks out for the guy who sold cleeter a blown up trans or what?
The brakes were so hot they were glowing! Hang them on the wall as a trophy!
Old front end on Mullet?
That really sucks about Mullet however Ruby is back and as amazing as ever! Focus on a perfect 8.50 week and set a record. Damn good driving by everyone and one hell of a team.
Skydivers dont jump out of aircraft without a Reserve Shute. Why do Floridians dare go faster than termnal velocity without one?
Dang it sorry bud
Sorry to hear and watch that Mullet is down for the count. Engine is making a lot of power for the trans now. So u have upgraded the transmission, then its rear-end time 🤔
Tough break…but as usual, taking it in stride.
So sad but happy to see you’re ok brother!!!
Hope the suspension / steering didn't get bent/messed up by that sideways skid through the gravel. Nice save though.
Damn that sucks, you’ll be back with mullet I love that car. Ruby is awesome too glad to see she’s back!
Ruby my girl.❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
If he would've only had one parachute and it was the one that never deployed correctly, things would've been sooooo much worse
Good way to promote the breaks
Should come to Piedmont Dragway in NC ,. People would love to see you make passes & race 💪🏾
Bruh you better give TBM a call and thank them for those brakes being so damn good
Looks like mullet need better parachute
Cleeter is literally the new super Dave it's fuggin great 😅
feels bad but glad you are safe
didn't expect sams truck to be so fast
what an awesome pass for james. that was so sick
mullet looks good with a little dirt on him
Well shit
I like tye’s truck, its a relatable garage build
Ruby needs to have a talk with Mullet about how to go one and done.
Good to see you in high spirits even though Mullet is out, but hey thats racing and you will get her fixed and ready to race another day.
Go jackstand woohoooo🏁🏁🏁🏁
Ruby's 8.500 is a hole in 1
Thank god for them tbm!!
love to see Tye finally getting in the action. keep that coming
James can drive.
It hurts to see Mullet sidelined so soon, Ruby did amazing, Tye and the Ranger will grow together and hit the numbers by the end of the week, and Mr Sam in The Street Sweeper F-150 going 13.7 not a bad number for a stock truck, what rear end did he get with that though? I know they offer electronic lockers or non slip variants.
Cleetus, has'nt Mullet gone 6.50 under Kevins guidence?  was that on the old big block? Why the lack of progress?    i realise you have a lot of fun through the year, spend a shit load of money on all sorts of stuff,  i would have thought, sick week Florida 2024,  would be your biggest event of the year?    So whats going on?   sure we can put all sorts of shit down to "Thats racing"   but if your not serious?  why are you doing it ?  For channel views?  come on,  a new year,  a big event, how many passes do you expect to get from your engine or gear box? Preventative maintence, means this shit doesnt happen, sure you should have a spare!   Spare engine, gearbox, tailshaft, diff, turbos, that goes with out saying,  its not like your doing it tuff?   you waste money for views all the time.   the car should be fresh and ready to go for a main event.   While mullet was down, with chassis mods, that would have been a great time to get the gear box looked at, freshened up.   Sick week Florida would be your main event Right?  getting mullet tip top would have been top priority?  you pay a guy to come and set the car up! yet your, Farking around on a snow rail?  i guess this is why your competition is getting faster and your not,  there concentrating all there effort on getting there car right,  on smaller budgets! while your in a continuos kaotic party mode, all for channel views.  planes, helicopters,  boats, sand rails, snow rails. All for channel views ?    i am sure there is a big $ sponser just waiting for you to lift your game.  but  all they see,  is just another you tuber wanting to have a good time! Why would a serious, big $ sponser give you money to watch you piss it away?  i would be happy watching testing, mods, maintenance and progress at the track videos,  seeing mullet running consistant low 6's or getting into the 5'6s, and seeing the rewards of such work.  The green ford mustang guy breaks records day 1, so whats he doing right? i bet he doesnt have your budget?  or partys all over the usa through out the year for views.  Seeing less off the kaotic stuff would not phase me, if it ment you got more serious with team Cleetus!  i am not watching, for planes, helicopters, boats, sand and snow rails etc.    i am sure if you did less kaos and concentrated more on your cars and team, you would have one of the fastest and most consistant teams in florida.  a Big $ sponsers and a 5 second Mullet.  Instead,  now mullets Broke and out of sick week...........after one day. When was the last time you checked that trans fluid? how long do you persist in break down mode of fix it mentality? i mean the car should be faster than 6.5 consistantly , with all this time, money and effort. what is holding you back?  any one can do multiple things poorely!  (yay channel views!) there are multiple you tuber's doing that already on you tube.  Do we really need another channel like that?   maybe,  you and i,  just measure sucess differently Cleetus.  Maybe its just my frustration , watching you piss away money all over the place, and seeing Mullet stagnate due to it.     you have been crying that mullet is out classed competing with the big boys,  so fix it already!  just trying to be a voice of reason, and i am sure the haters are going to hate on this comment.
Tye just needs to go ahead and put mullets old rear end in the ranger
It’s the weight plus power that kills parts. Wish you could find some weight to cut
Special thanks to Kyle @ 1320 video for insuring Cleetus still is of value, without Turbo Exhaust whistles.  I mean, without Mullet.
Leroys trans wouldn't fit
Tye needs a different shifter location
Tough break buddy
I hate seeing Mullet out of the game, however, Cleeter puts in a lot of work on these events between the wrenching, driving, filming and editing for these daily videos. Hopefully, this gives him an opportunity to relax a little and enjoy it from the other side. He's earned it.....or audible to mcflurry
What chassis do y’all think Cleetus would have gone with for his big dog car if he didn’t already have mullet as a jet car build
Can't park there mate
Not trying to overstep a boundary, but as a former trucker and tire guy, you probably flat-spotted all 4 tires in that brake lock.  Call nitto?. They will know for sure.
Good thing ya had those TBM brakes Garrett.. glad you’re ok
I'm from. Alaska
Whoa, Mr Cleetus was moving fast 😮 Shows how good the TBM brakes are, also brilliant car control when under pressure 👏👏. what a team, what a Family to have 😃👍
Damn that sux
Holy smokes, Congrats to James on a perfect pass 😎👏👏.
Those TBM breaks❤
what caused the chute to come out late?...that was scary
Lets gooooo!
We had it on 8 the other day. Proceeds to set it at 10 psi boost 😂
You can't park there bud.   You scared the pants off me cleet. I don't want to see that headline. Please be safe. Glad your okay
I do think Ruby is such a cool looking car with the sticker bomb rear and big single turb-ski poking outta the hood.
Put the man in the red car and let him work.
bro you still advertising for KEEPS? you know the product that keeps your hair on your head, you might need to start using their product, Ya balding brother, your hair is receding faster than a out going tide
happy to see you safe what a hell of a drive you have skills!
I have no idea why there's not a fresh transmission or 2 Just sitting around with all your money, Even worse you got a transmission given to you and it's junk. What kind of friend is that? Oh well racing is just one disappointment after another with maybe some happiness in between.
Those TBM Brakes really did wonders right there xD
Those brakes were glowing
Scariest pass of his life…. Ends with a “WHOOO!” Dude has octane running threw his veins
Day 12 of asking Cleetus to build the flip car from fast and furious 6
Cleeter! This is your sign that you need to get in an ultra4 car and race king of the hammers!
You are one bad motherfucker I love you cleet ❤
TBM brakes for the win💥💥
Well, at least you still have that red auction car that refuses to stop giving great content!  Run Ruby Run!
Hopefully that person that let you borrow their transmission was ignorant of its condition.  Maybe they wanted a free rebuild after you torched it in a run.  People do weird things when competition and money is involved.  Thank goodness you removed the pan or you would have never known.
Guy tried to get a free replacement trans by loaning to cleet.
Muppet! concentrated so much on making the car go fast forgot about the brakes and chutes.
I hated every second of him drilling that carbon fiber door lol
That was some flashbacks to driving Tom Bailey's promod with no chutes haha
Man I loved that camera on the brakes, well handled all round brother! 👏
Can you change classes and run your supercharged corvette?
Ruby is back. Good job guys.
When he’s a jerk he’s a jerk.
This channel is one of the most watchable, enduring tips of the hat to motorsport. Love it. 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Truck shid😂
F1 Smokem .... YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE!!! Go race damn it!!!
Go Michigan, I mean Steve!
Ich bin aus Deutschland hier und ich liebe diesen channel
Ruby's one and done
Really sorry to hear about Mullet
I’m glad you are alright man!… 🤙👌
9 mins in so far and that dead on 8.50 had me shook
Way to stay composed and get it shut down. True wheel man
Shame about mullet but I’m so happy to see ruby. She’s so damn cool
The way you handled that stop is incredible 😅😅
It's a real bummer that Mullet's out of the race on his first day but, on the bright side at least it was close to home.
The WOOOO is hilarious ahah
Jackatand is the goat whatever that is I assume it means gnrwly awesome radical excellent.. I'm old. Hahahaha
What a great promo for TBM brakes.
Mate all i can say is good job pulling the car up and keeping your composure you really are a legend
Seeing George all pumped is so much fun.  Getter done boys!!
It’s unfortunate the person who sold the transmission didn’t give any disclaimers and lied about the status of it. Cool to se Garrett not calling him out, but he deserves it when he knew he could take advantage of the circumstances
Mullet just wanted some off roading 😂
That save in mullet was damn impressive! TBM brakes for the win!
Come on buddy don’t give up!!! You didn’t get this far by Quittin!!! Find a transmission somewhere else! One of these racers has to have one
Hey cleet you can't park there!! 😂 glad you're ok, that was some smooth driving! It's definitely an advertisement for TBM Brakes for sure!
Those brake rotors......😮😮😮
BRUNO LENCO TIME FOR MULLET . POOR T400 ISNT HAPPY .
How crazy is this. A couple weeks Cletus and  Doug from Motion Race Works were on Stevie Fast and Lyle Barnetts pod cast, and at 23:30 of the video Doug tells them that there is no better way to test TBM brakes than to put them on Mullet weighting 2900lbs and running 230mph.
Never again will that happen again...Holy shit!! That's an OCD thing from now on oh yeah pull the hitch...
Why the steel front end back on mullet?
Ruby: You couldn't live with your own failure brother (Mullet), so where did that bring the crew? Back to me.
At least the rear brakes are working. That was handled so well, just tip it in sideways and drive out like a Jeep on 35's.
Ive dedicated my life to racing and know its hard to retiree a car but if cleetus want to be a successful racer he needs to revamp his program, people say its just a tranny carry another fine u gonna carry an xtra car it weighs 3400lbs can make 5000 hp he runs the car at 3500, limited on tire size, that tranny cosu over 20k with converter its the best of the best WEIGHT KILLED THAT TRANNY he needs to build chromoly double frame rail, carbon, titanium he can get the car down to 2400 lbs or less have room for different tire sizes ability to make car work for different classes if u have to add weight for class u can choose where to put he needs to realize this and wouldnt be on buch firsu day of sick weedOH IN CASE OF EMERGENCY LIGHT CAR STOP FASTER ALSO
Glad to see you got out of the chute situation unharmed, looking forward to the daily updates 🤌🏾   Thank you  for sharing your content
I blame dave I saw him drive mullet.he was off to recover some women and needed a wheelie machine.
Does the ranger have rear suspension lol
HELL YEAH TYE
Ruby looks sooooo damn good lol
That 8.500 is insane! Like actually mental how good that run is!
The rise and fall of mullet 😭😭
Aerodynamically I wonder how much of a difference having something to change the angles of that rear window on mullet would make.
The way Cleet looks after people especially Sam, you are one of the good guys brother and in today’s world it’s a dying breed. Keep burning rubber and setting them eagles free
Them TBM Brakes worked hard enough to lock the tires - couldn't ask for anything more than the tires could give. Damn glad you've got great sponsors that keep you in a place to get home to your family. Might not land Sick Week, but you adulted real dang good.
Dude that is one hell of a save! You lucky lucky man! Thank god your ok
He looks pissed about that trans.
A massive high with Ruby and Jackstand, then a huge scare and hurt for Mullet and Cleetus. Just another day in the life of McFarland Racing. You guys are incredible, thanks for keeping us all entertained.
You can't kill Ruby...She's come a long long way since that Auction
Look at the # of views in a half day . Testament to how many people have respect for Cleet and his team. Not one person could not watch that video and scroll past. He’s still one of the Best Drivers in my opinion in any dam vehicle it seems.
Full circle. Garrett had a double shoot failure on his first ever 6 second pass in Tom Bailey's 1.0 and now happens at tom's event
Sucks mate. But couldn’t you have put fresh oil in, done another pass and hope it went well and also found a replacement in the time?
Did Mullet get the steel front put on just cause of headlights or he wanted the weight?
Pretty messed up for that guy to give or sell you an already destroyed trans, would’ve loved to see mullet finish out sick week
I thought you couldn't run street tires?
Sam is just the coolest dude ever!!!
We ALL saw you being distracted (interviewed) while packing it. Attention to detail is key and that little one is counting on YOU to be the ball.
Cleetus, have you evere thought  about a top Speed run? Something like texasa Mile...with a smx 5k horsepower you should top astonishing speed record! 300+ for sure 😊
its a wonder you didnt boil the brake fluid off
That poor transmission lol
Tough seeing Mullet out but Jackstand and Ruby are on point!
Mullet off roading. Let’s go! 😎
Glad you're safe brother
great filming couldnt see shit then the sky nice real cool.
Ty’s truck is my favorite vehicle on the channel right now! That thing is just so cool!
Who knew mullet was a safari drag car.  Great job handling that. As you were skidding i was like, hes got this cuz hes gonna try to pitch it sideways and you seemed very calm.
Let's Go Ruby!!!
2024 Ruby’s year!!!!!
Garrett and Tye both need to learn how to do a longer burn out in order to get the tires good and hot so they will stick and not spin
I shit my pants when ruby made that run! Holy crap!
Little Ripper Tater Chipper isn’t too upset about it tell you that! More family, camera, and toter home time ain’t bad at these events either. Bummer for mullet brother but she’s gonna have so many race week wins in her life. Keep it up! Looks like a heck of a time
How do they pick checkpoints for the week? I’d love to be able to talk to the city about hosting a checkpoint and get you guys to stop by my restaurant Coconuts on the Beach. Reserve our parking lot and reserve inside the restaurant for racers. Pretty much what we do for our boat racing teams during the boat races.
Wooooooooooooooooooooo!
Those tbm's might have saved your life, along with that semi-drift maneuver 🖤
Fuckin Jackstands buttdyno is DIALED. "That should be right around 8.50s hopefully not 8.40s", 8.50 MONEY.
That really sucks to have to tap out on the end of the first day on the other hand tho i thought at this level of performance and demand you would already have an extra transmission for every car your running, whats worse than a quarter million dollar car? A quarter million dollar car that doesnt work
I think this is a fabulous advertisement for TBM brakes. Don’t know what the heck would have happened without them thangs
See yall in a few hours fellas. We got some nice cold air for you in Gainesville. 🐊
Someone get George a megaphone stat!🤘🤘
Jackstand Jimmy - Lets get er done ruby Ruby - Just a walk down main street 🛻
Great to see Jackstand and George so pumped. 👌🏽
Well Hell not the opening I wanted to see poor Mullet 😢
Glad you’re alright cleet that was some quick and great decision making right there!
Hopefully that guy gives you the money back for that trans
I’m sooooo glad ruby is back!!!
DO IT FOR ED!!!  Lets go RUBY!!!
cool to see sam drive
Thats some great driving there Cleetus, saved it, could have been a roll over or in the wall like Steve..Sams truck did a better time than Wyatts Corotta
Dude who sold you the trans has karma on the way 😅
Drag cars need some normal road race breaks that was dangerous
TBM FOR THE WIN
Thats the right attitude to have, because one thing that's guaranteed is that cars break. Keep on keeping on men.
Cleetus saw his whole life flash before his eyes in that run. Sheesh😅
Sand blaster. Cooter
awesome work Ty, I new that second run was going to be a 9.70-9.80 seeing you spun and let off twice and did a flat 11 the first run
That will make your ass pucker fr sure
That’s suxs day one out 🤦‍♂️ should call Steve  He has a trans not being used
6 on trending
I need to know the roof rack for Ruby. So sick
I'm so sorry your trans picked this moment to retire 😢.  Man I was soooo routing for ya my friend!!!! I really wish I had a trans that'll work for you but unfortunately I haven't raced cars in a good while. I actually had to go to racing go karts (open modified) because of the cost, but they still can and Will,  jerk that knot in ya ass when ya need a little or alot of stress release!!! Lmao!!!!!! 😆 I got my Racing Number (38) by my age at when I switched from racing big stuff and racing on the streets buy my age. I had just turned 38. So that was it.  After Dale passed, things weren't the same in NASCAR for me or even to watch it but my number worked out so well because of my Love for the Earnhardts and all the great memories I've had because of Nascar.  Hell, I even dated Jan S. the vice president of racing radios way back when they started with the racing team radio programs. Here in Bristol and NE Tennessee.   Fun, fun times then. Before that, I did all of the paint work and body work at Roberts Motor Cars in Kingsport, Tn.  That is where all the stunt cars and some movie stunt cars were made for MGM studios back in the day.  You remind me of Me back in the days of life without the stress of being retired and on a fixed income. Now I'm building some mean ass chainsaws and collecting vintage saws from all makes and porting for max output!!  Racing and competition is just in my blood till I check out of here some day but I really enjoy your shows and all you do my friend. You are having the fun, fun, fun now, so appreciate it and enjoy every song minute of it all!!! SSI sorry you're car is down at the moment. I'm sure someone will come to your rescue!!!!! 🤞 Im praying for it!!!!  If they don't,. (someone Will get ya going again, they just got to man!!!) Well if not, There is always the next one and it won't be long until you have Everything you need and Everything clicking right on time together at the Same Time. I miss racing so Much but You and Your shows always helps with my PTSD and not having my outlet and stress relief i had gotten so used to having each week or in all and all,. I honestly can say,, I'm hooked on Adrenalin and it sucks not having a regular fix of it!  Lol!!!. Racing was my outlet! The doctor put me on darn blood thinner so my racing days has to come to an abrupt half without any warning and then I got the call from the racing director to tell me I wouldn't be eligible to race at any Sanctioned Kart Track (WKA) again without a formal Doctor's release and off any blood thinners of any kind.  I hope you read this Cletus and know my thoughts, best wishes and prayers are for you and your family and all your brothers at the FF from other mother's.  Good bless you all my friends!!!!  🙏🇺🇸💯🍻👍👉😎
Love seeing Sam make a pass, but wow 13.7 looks so slow next to all these 6-7 second cars 😂
Sad giraffe at the end 😢
Go get them Sam you got this!! I'm pulling for you 🦾🦾
damn. that sucks man
Love Ruby’s hood.
That sucks Cleetus, was looking forward to seeing Mullet go hard with new rear end. Ty and Ruby can carry the torch. 🇦🇺👍
God damn! Lol That one chute and those brakes team of guardian angels, just down to the end
you should be warming up that oil before doing 2step checks
But you cant knock how many passes that trans has on it, who knows it could have made it all week before it went. A spare would be ideal to have at the level mullet is at.
👍
Good save they needa extend it
Will still be watching live feed all the way from Australia.  HELL YEAH BROTHER
i was surprised to hear you didnt ever have a spare trans, i would always for something like that and spare diff.
love seeing you guys pumped! lets go ruby!! glad clet and mullet are okay!
Why don't we get to see the small problems you have ???? Like mullet starting at the end of the track on sick week day one 2024...
It sucks when you have to take the conservative road and park the toy on the other hand is that’s the most beautiful pass I’ve ever watched on this great channel that car was the definition of dialed in that 2nd pass and as for ruby the og you can said it’s DIALED IN FOR THOSE NEXT 4 days because that’s the best 2 passes I’ve seen them make ever
Bet he was glad to not have that carbon fiber front clip on mullet lmao
Shame about mullet but man Ruby  is on a come back can't wait for the rest of the week
Seeing only one chute deploy at 220+ was anxiety inducing, thank goodness you're okay Cleet. Whatever happens to Mullet happens, we can't replace you
I'm beginning to think ol cleater don't like driving stick where is leroy
That ranger when its on the move it sounds so smooth. Well done all
Glad your OK  mate, that must have been a brown trousers moment for sure
What a freaking driver. It was sliding back and front. Then the whip at the end. Bravo cleet
FUCKEN SICK
Anyone else notice the cleet carhartt sweatshirt at the end? Think we need some of those for the guys in the cold states.
Good save cleet.
ruby is out here showing us what we have been missing.
Surely just pull McFlurry out
Now you can go hangout with Steve.
Might be time for some bigger brake pistons there bud
I love how James never takes the steering wheel off and just squeezes himself out of the car
Ole sam should have borrowed the blue f150's wheels and tires.
I saw Ruby's run the other day and all I was thinking until this moment was I cannot wait to see George's reaction when it's posted up on Cleeters channel... So worth the wait! lol
Sucks Garrett :(  Good to see Ruby rippin.
RUBY IS NOT GOING BACK IN THE BARN!!
Dang it!! It’s funny, but it’s really not. I’ve taken vacation 2 years in a row on Sick Week for the sole purpose of going to go watch Cleetus run mullet.. Well 2 years in a row it’s broke before it got to the race we had tickets for. I think we are going to skip Gainesville  and just get started on the thousand mile trek home. 100% figuring out a different vacation for next year, no more Sick Week for us anymore. Uggg!!!
the smoke in the background .. starts off a wisp and within 10 minutes you got a genuine forest fire going
Ruby is the real G!!
you take the good with the bad mate. great efforts all around. 10/10 boys
Greatest car team in the world now George when are we going to see the blazer back comon George leshgoooo
😢
LMAO Ruby hit that 8.500 and George was speechless for like 2 tenths.   "oh 8.50, right on, well,  ......EIGHT FIFTY!!!!!! "  haha
NOOOOOOOOOO BROTHER NOOOOOOOOO My whole sick week was built on watching you and Mullet bring home the W!!! That sucks welp LETS GOOOOO RUBY, Ty, and Sam bring it home for Cletus and Mullet🎉
wooow :D
I’m glad your good my boi god damn Jesus take the whole wheel I gotta brake bro
I think it’s time to do a rat rod for my next build. Finishing up the tow truck that I always wanted to build. That’s been fun but I keep thinking about the next one.
What about Steve's trans? 🤔
Bro I reckon mullet was telling you something. Not this week mate !!! Please go over every nut and bolt haha. Gonna sound crazy to people but first scare going down into the sand and the next run trans gives out. I reckon mullet knew something we didn't this week.
Mullets out here doing truck stuff
WE DECIDED TO TURN MULLET INTO A 4x4   🤣
George sucks. Booooo 😂
Need to get rid of the m&m trans and go with a better company
It would be nice to see the doors color matched at some point
All I can say is “that’s racing”
The pain in that last minute 😢
Good seeing ruby back lmao that run was PERFECT!
Jackstands 50.0 brought a tear to my eye.. such a beautiful thing!!
Man Mullet was a bullet on that last run too. So sad he's out already, but I look forward to the next one!
so sad Mullet is outta Race , shit happens every day , sometimes twice
Those tbm brakes puttin in work!!! Glowin and sparkin bringing that beast to a stop!!! Glad your ok!!!
Cleetus...on the bright side views....Pete shrugs dammit.
0:53 who’s the girl ?😂
Goddamn dude start the video that my damn fire alarm from my house we’re going off😂
#6 on trending! knew it’d be on trending after i saw someone else upload a clip from the stands
i absolutely love seeing tye in here aswell this time around in sick week. lets goo i have always wanted to see him racing !!!!
Happiest moment in a couple of years is jackstand and ruby running a 8.500 first run.
He Said Woah!🤙🏻😂🤣
Nice job slowing mullet down
Gotta thank them tbm brakes 😂
Pity. 2 of you already out. Keep supporting your guys please.
Wow! Glad your okay.
damn son those rotors went forged orange super quick hahaa fkn grouse to see you pull it off stay safe ya big giraffe
Great driver
Them TBM Brakes 🥲
Mullet wasn't made for off roadin', gees!
Bloody hell that run was hairy, i will say the suspension shot is awesome, that rear end is a work of art!
Bro! That sucks about Mullet! What are ya going to do though except make the best of it! Ruby!! 8.50.0 Git-R-Done!!
Ruby said “you aint putting me back in that barn”
It's bonkers that these days a stock f150 can run the same in the 1/4 mile as the 69 charger r/t
HELL YEAH RUBY!!!!
“Hell yeah brother your on the Cleetus McFarland YouTube channel”
Now you have 2 transmissions. Send them both to get rebuilt and made like twins and have tye make a strap in the bed of mullet for it lol
Team McFarland for the win even without mullet
Glad you're safe brother. The worry in georges voice made me so sad for a minute lol.
am i blind or is it a item available to purchase, 31:08 your cleetus hoodie is a carhartt hoodie or did i miss that train
Sucks brother hate to see you and Steve go out like that
Is it too late to tag in Mcflurry? I know Mcflurry would make the trip
linco in mullet.....
Running ruby down at an 8.5... disgusting!!
I love the new camera angles! Especially under the car, looks so sick watching that 4 link work!
Great job but gotta be like Lutz an all the way lol
I would either keep a spare or send it out for a refresh before big events like this. Im sure you know but just sayin
Gotta love George looking around for one of the guys to film when Ruby knocks off a 8.500. Then turns it on himself to film the excitement. Love that guy!
I love how cleetus’s response after coming to a stop is just “wooo” fucking legend
James... my man congrats fr tho. Amazing
just want you to know it’s 12:18pm and i just watched jackstand hit a 8:500 and jumped out of my bed in excitement. congratulations on your first race of sick week can’t wait to see more!
I know Cleeter went and cried by himself for a minute… the disappointment in his voice and on his face tells all. Sorry Cleeter💔
RUBY 8.50 is crazy!!
Bro! Mullets first pass was insane 😂
What a good save and thank god for tbm brakes 😮‍💨
Nah. Then yoh get to a dentist eventually and have that part removed.  I’m just letting you know how to help it now.  Haha
Those TBM Brakes got a workout
I think Pete is the guy I identify with most. Mostly I like to be given interesting problems and left alone to play. But I also love to create a spectacle.
Ruby doesn’t want to go back in that barn😅😅
Dude, …Clete, you saved Mullet with that scrubbin action before the sand pit.  Great driving!
Time to step up to a Rossler tranz cleeter.
No way they guy sold him a junk trans
Such a bummer 😮😢
Them's the breaks. At least your brakes work :D Seriously though, you're pushing the envelope here, literally breaking record after record; if it don't break, you ain't trying hard enough.
@CleetusM Colder temperature increases damping ratio due to higher oil viscosity - shocks will tighten up in the cold.
all good root ya boys on 👍👍
Two things I know for sure after watching this video… TBM brakes are something serious and Cleetus dude you can drive a car. Unfortunate mullet got hurt!
24:27   “WE”.    😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
“8.50 with a zero” 😂😂😂
FIRE ME UP RUBY!!!!!! LET'S GO!!!!
Well thats racing .
Seek Jesus! Repent for the Kingdom is at hand! Jesus is the way! The truth! And the life! He’s the ONLY way!  Open the Bible, read and understand that we are in the last days! Put your full trust in him! Believe 1 Corinthians 15 1-4!
Bummer broseph. Get em next time.
Dangggg unlucky mullet
14:38  “WE”. 😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
9:50  It can definitely get better than that. As soon as they get a new camera man then it will definitely get better.   Damn titties you’re so damn annoying
Nice save, got is slowed down far enough, those TBM's glowing hot, can see how effective they cool between brake applications, right till there's no airflow in the sandpit.
Send mullet anyway.
Bummer dude, but dems the brakes ... Glowing hot TBM brakes !!! 😂 You can't win em all cleet, you are now the hype guy in the lanes son. Killer start for Ruby 👊😎
Mud bogging in mullet I see lol
Love that you found enjoyment out of football 🏈 & your husband’s passion. I share your same sentiment when it came to football. I did not get it at first & missed out on so many games with my family also. But now I do love ❤it. Also, with any large group you will always find people who are gross or extreme especially when alcohol is involved & competitiveness. But either way its fun & entertaining as games are.  I’m just happy watching you grow & are enjoying life & embracing all it has to offer. You’ve brought us so much enjoyment over the years you deserve all the positive coming your way. Never forget it. Hugs Colleen and family.
Ah Man So Dissapointed in this out come for Mullett.
How come ls George doesn’t run the blazer any more?
8.50.0😮😮😮😮😮🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Well this sucks my fav is out on day 1. Guess that's part of racing
That sucks that Mullet's out, but at least Ruby's still in and definitely doesn't want to go back in the barn.
The awkward feeling when you're the topic of the next safety meeting: "New rule, hitches must be removed at the track"
Ruby is so dialed
Now mullet is out how about dusting off the dale truck to follow on the road trip with the guys
Look at that. 11 hrs almost 900k views. I love it 👍🏻😃
George said it Ruby's like I don't want to go back in the barn
i got so excited when ruby did a 8:50
Cleetus, you are a machine man!   Thumbs up to your driving skills. 👍👍 Those brakes were cherry red. You gave Mullet everything it had to keep damage to a minimum. Your reaction just after and the interview with 1320 just show that you are one cool, collected dude.
what in TARNATION!?
Our boy can drive!!! I'm glad your good and so is Mullet!!! Sorry besides the transmission...
Never actually paid to be member so it's nice to see the perspectives of people that had the money
Jack Stand is on a Roll.
cut the check t.b.m. lol
First Cleetus has a parachute failure in Tom Baileys car and now in his own. Nature likes to keep his life exciting
hey race cars long enough you get things like that happen, you just to keep charm and you'll be fine, congrats to Jack stands wn at street car nat
How many guys u have and u didnt check gear box oil on your 6s car u moron ......... just need another gear spare as we are idiot's and have bot loads of cash now.  Maybe stop the boats planes all the other crap and look after your cars which made your channel. Checked oil 2 or 3 days b4 the event ... dude good job more testing more cars ,old sayn money changes ppl . And u have it recorded.....
Way to fast on the first second shift with the ranger
That 8.500 needs to be the reason the hood stays, I love a hood less ruby but that’s just the craziest shit I’ve seen in a race week video
Cleetus please sale me a carhartt hoodie like that 👌🏽
How th does cleet not have a spare trans 😂 shit steve has like 5 😂
Just imagine how much farther Cleet would have sent it into the sand if 2nd didnt slip lol Mullet was on a tear!!
Cleet you should definitely link up src man. Yall could have some pretty cool content together
Nooooooooo!!!!
You're killing it bro.  One transmission at a time.... But seriously this channel brings so much happiness to my life you wouldn't believe it! thank you Cleetus and all the rest. Sam is having the time of his life!!
Welcome BACK Ruby, we all missed you. She said "Im sorry what was that about the barn again?"
Bummer Dude
Can we take a second to commend the fact that Cleetus never even flinched when the chutes didn’t come out, just stayed perfectly cool and calm and drove that rig all the way to the end where it stopped. What a legend 😎
Insane how fast your going
James & Ruby made that Connection though!!!!
Sucks that your out, but way to hold it together and keep mullet in one piece.
transmission no maint means no winner
I love Mullet. Glad Garrett’s alright after that one holy hell 🫣
At least you saved it from the sandman...😳
Great job day one guys. Ole Cleetus time to pick up the slack as a cameraman 😂 sucks you’re out but I’m glad the failure wasn’t worse
Mullet trying to stop like he got carbon ceramics 😂
At least you got the longest pass of the day…
those rotors are literal toast
Bummed for mullet, but I can't wait to watch ruby crush perfect 8.50s all week and watch tye dial in the ranger
gawd dang you guys are such a well oiled unstoppable MACHINE of a team. i hope we get to enjoy this channel for decades!
Why does Pete do sick week and not dr tune em all?
9500 rpm with an BBC😅
Next year brother, me and my cousin will be there next year. Me from California and my cuz from Florida.  Can’t wait
We need Thomas the Hype man back!! Glad you and Mullet made it out okay Cleet. Tough break. Glad your here to tell the tale!
Sucks for mullet.
@19:13 love this view. glad youre safe!
I’m assuming the trans got hurt when it was hopping and the sudden stop in the sand?
Leroy wouldn’t have let ya down like this. Jus sayin
Fred from 1320video was In cletus's ear when  he PACKED THE PARACHUTE😮 just saying
Old mate wanted a new rebuild transmission at your expense
Damn that sucks about getting a trash trans.
Ruby coming out strong!
“Wooh” after he stops sideways got me😅😅
Cleetus.... That was Fantastic, but Sketchy af Brother!!!!
Noooooooo
Need to get George a car
SUPER BUMMED FOR YOU
Unfortunate Garrett, but we will be watching regardless!!
Rip Mullet....but hey, least you have Ruby an possibly the Danger Ranger to carry the rest of the event!
Stopped on an dime!😁
Jackstand for the win.  What a pass.  Ruby looks fine AF with a hood on her.
Cleeter thought he was still in the Snow Rail!
Way to handle that Mishap Cleet!
Thanks for the content in this hard time, my dog just got cancer, that you cleetus!
The Whoo is the best part
Well...dang. Looks like you and Steve are camera guys this time out. Thanks for all you do and everyone that's in your crew.
Ruby must remain in the race team she has earned the right and respect.
Jack stand is A BADASS!!!!🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Glad Ty is getting to enjoy the track in his ranger
Sucks.
#1 neighbor #2 ruby #3 donnie
I'm sorry did this man say 226 on his first pass? tire spin, wheelie ... 226
Thats what they get for getting greedy with the ppv.
did anyone else see Steve's angry Alex Taylor photo? haha
I literally threw my arms up in the air after Ruby's run...my wife thinks I'm watching football 🤣
Bummed... but glad to see you're alright after that scare. Mullet is a high performance machine, and sometimes stuff happens. Might not be Mullets time to shine. Maybe Ruby is due for a trophy, or my boy Sam in "Frosty" the ol stock white Ford F1Smokems. We're excited to see/have you and George behind the lenses.
Too bad about Mullet, maybe next event he can win.
I mean mullet is technically a truck
Glad you are in one piece! Watched the livestream shame we missed the B2 “update”
So many idiots posted speculation and exaggeration videos. Pipe it down drama queens, always wait for the man to post his own. Sofa king frustrating when idiots snipe it. I guess it's ok now because they made themselves look stupid. Views I guess.
That new 4 link got you hooking hard enough now that all that power is trying to find a weak point and now it's the trans I guess.
Unfortunate events with the transmission deal, that just sux, great video though!  That run time was like hitting the bullseye in the center of the bullseye!  Awesome!!!
This guys a legend. The WHEW!!! After lolol
Let’s go Jack stand!!!!
You need a risk manager to anticipate the issues. I’m available for consulting.
Where is McFlurry....come on now
That was absolutely best case scenario! Damn dude...
Sorry bud, better luck next time…..
Keep telling them they need an in house trans builder but no one got back to me and here they are 🤷‍♂️ still drives and shifts thats a 2hr refresh if parts are in hand
trump supporters
that a boy glad it wasnt worse
Why are the go pro angles different
Cleetus, Could you (or someone listening) Please tell about How the Two-Step Works???
Definitely gave me goosebumps seeing the wipe out.
I sure hope you get your money back for that transmission
been seeing the thumbnail around youtube of mullet in the pit, its been so hard waiting for your video on it!!
Hey Cleet, would Steve morris have a trans you could buy since his car is out?????
I see James is still a tool. 🤡
Only reason ruby ran a 8.50.0 is because of the hood
🤡
i can smell that fluid from ohio
Damn that sucks 😢😢
Bro literally did a manji on the brakes to slow down like a genius
Only happy you are safe and car in 1 piece.
Sam is how I imagine the Grandpa I never had , what a good soul and a good man 👍👍
It’s all good! Ruby is clearly in 1st, and that was a close call with the parachute! I raced bikes, those brake’s saved yo ass!!
Bro that is an amazing save right there brother very calm and collected
At this point it's has to be your tire compound right?
That sucks! I don’t know who gave you that trans but how could they not know it was bad?🤔 hate that for you guys!
Where’s the freedom 500  helicopter prize video ??
Bummer! On the positive side you’re in one piece.
what a dirtbag move to sell you a burnt trans.
Sucks but without a doubt the right call.
Va-rooOH No! Whew.
i wonder how ruby would do with a formula setup for handling
To be fair that transmission has seen some shit. And at mullets level of horsetourqes nothing will ever be strong enough
That was bad going in sideways. Too much faster and you are figging in and rolling over!
Thats my girl.
I see Mullet still has his old nose clip, since you need headlights to be legal on the street for a drag-n-drive event.
It’s one thing to drive that car fast, it’s another TO STOP THAT TRUCK GOIN 200MPH AND SAVE IT JUST IN THE SAND!!!! GOOD WORK CLEETUS
You're my friggin role model. Way to keep it positive bro. 👍
1:21 is that a ford festiva?
Too bad about mullet but Jackstand, tye, and Sam can still rep McFarland racing. Glad to see tye having some fun
second time youve had chute issues ...... time for new ones
Welp, im glad yall put the steel front end on there and not the carbon one for sick week 🤷‍♂️
Trucks doing TRUCK things... ~( 'w')/  RUBY doing RUBY things! \(^_^)/
When is Mullet going big tire? He's got a promod engine, but running smallblock tires.
30:15 .. all the Mopar boys saying 'Hey, that's my filter'.
Dude that woo cleetus did when the car fanaly stop ! 😳 what a relief
I was always told if you ain’t breaking sh•t you’re ain’t doing nothing. HYB ! 🇺🇸
RUBY IS BACK!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Hell of a job shuttin her down Cleetus, Your reaction to the shoots not deploying was super fast and defintely saved you from goin deep in the sand. Glad it was minor.
gotta put this out there, Garrett is a BONIFIED driver man, that boy's got the touch and knows the feel, great job man
Won’t one of Steve’s trannys work ? He got like 4. lol.  Ow we know why
Can you answer this if you have the chance to. So then what’s next in the realm of transmissions? Like what’s better than what you have now. Or what would be the next step? Hope you’re able to answer this. Just curious.
Sucks knocked shifter into neutral under power instead of hitting the chute lever…. That explains the 9500 rpm at the lights…
Brother! Put that screw driver away! You don't want that flying around the cabin if you wreck!
I could see how damn bummed you were man... it sucks but we all still got your back! Ruby and crew will make Sick Week amazing
Mullet NOOOOO!!!!! Everyone else AWESOME day 1.
RUBY looks killer 👍
I’m pretty pissed about the transmission issue, I assume cleet bought that for a good amount and for that bs to happen to him. Maybe I’m wrong but he seemed bummed. Good job team,  I just wish the best for the rest of the week.
You're a real truck now mullet 😂
The fact that Steve just handed over all those parts to help Cleet if anything were to happen. That’s so cool man.  That just shows you how good Steve is to his friends and customers.
Those brakes did their job brilliantly! Glad you ended up OK
WHAT A F'N SAVE GARRETT!!!!!!!
Dont matter how much you engineer something or spend on it. When racing shit breaks
So the random sold you a bad transmission?
George after Ruby's perfect 8.50 was awesome.  He looked around for somebody to celebrate with, realized everybody was elsewhere getting ready for their own thing, so he spun the camera around to selfie mode and celebrated with us, in the future.  No hesitation, instantly thought to do it.  That's why he's the best.
what a scumbag to sell you a busted trans... how can someone do that. ruin thats dues life no cap jk but really
Sad to see Mullet go out so early.  I think it's his way of saying I'll just chill out home this week & let ole Ruby Gal shine once again. Let's Goooo!!!!🇦🇺
ruby said i aint going back in that barn she wants her 6
Cletus I think the sound of that  SMX growling like a beast and that lockup hitting is the best sound in the world sorry for the mullet setback but sometimes we have to fail to get better keep up the great work looking forward to what's next
Man that sucks about the guy ripping you for that transmission. Hopefully he'll do right by you and maybe you'll end up with a core for a spare!
Nice stop at the end Cleetus! The concern in George's voice is real, what a tight team.
Experiment idea will a door close all the way when drag/launching hard enough
George is great 👍
Cleet that was some incredible driving mate.
Cleet, it’s the guy who left his gf in the hotel on her bday to speak at the land use meeting. Thank you to you and George for filming another shout out to my gf today, and thanks to Jackstand for not throwing a wrench at me, lol.  This (day 2) was my first drag race ever, and though it sucks there was no Mullet, it was cool to see you guys again and watch Ruby do her thing.  I’m gonna remind you who I am every time I see you until you finally start saying “Oh, there’s Tim again” when I start walking up to you 😂 Thanks for everything. Do it for Ed!
Each video I watch on this channel, at some point I remember him still in the early stages of Leroy. I’m so glad the guy has become so so successful, he comes off as incredibly genuine.
Unreal car control by Cleet, kept his cool and saved it.
Bummer about Mullet! Transmission thoroughly STEVE'D!! :) Jackstand winning! Tye getting dialed...Epic to run that well on the 2nd/3rd pass! Sam needs a supercharger!
so the guy who gave you tbe trans will take it back ...or ?
was awesome to hear 2 step check go sm not right and u confirm thattt love watching the checks
Poor Mullet, at least Ruby is behaving herself...
Ford Sierra XR 4x4 2.8 V6 turbo turbo four-wheel drive suspension many other things including turbo all done by turbo techniques. @cleatus know anyone interested in 1 of these
Let’s Go Ruby 🦅🇺🇸💪🤟
#8 on trending!!!! congrats there, but sad to see you out of comp
Live and learn brother. That’s what we are here for. I’m sure this won’t happen again. Good luck to the rest of the team.  🙏
Oh that’s why mullet was in mud 😂😂😂
All them Spark entries came in handy!
What can't cleeter drive everyone????? Are yall not entertained?!?!?!
got me some sweet honey bbq to watch dis
Why would someone hook a person up with a known bad condition transmission 🤦‍♂️ if your fluid is that bad then you should know the trans is shot.
The Ranger of Danger.
George lookn good with the hair cut. Who's next
Ridiculous absolutely ridiculous all that work all that money for seconds of time to run a car. They call it race😂
I want the ranger
Thai’s truck is perfect but for those size tires , time to tube out that truck bed buddy you need more grip for that monster ranger
Bog Deep!!!!!..... in Mullet!!
Im sorry but mullet is fuckin boring as hell to watch.  That car can finish shit without being broke, running like ass...    They got multiple cars that are entertaining and hes stuck on this one turd.
Cleetus driving Mullet like it's the Dew Unit
All the cars look amazing.  Great driving cleet! Thanks for keeping mullet safe. Great driving
Why not borrow Steve’s spare 400 he won’t be needing it for a bit .
What did Sam do about tires?
How is that 8.50 possible on the first pass ? James’ really different 😂
geuss we need to buy some merch so you can get a spare trans for him
Hope you dident buy that transmission thats already burnt up
Props to Cleetus for staying calm in the no chute situation and keep control of the car. That shit can be scary as hell and panic can overtake quickly. Good too see you and the car alright
TBM brake for the win
So Cleetus you tested the other day and the car was not in Race mode  ? So why bother testing
Thems some hot brakes
Mullet is a truck after all 😅
Sorry about Mullet. Get em next time. Can’t wait for the next  video!
Talk shit about ruby and she bites you immediately
Supra time baby!
Nice job Tye!  Happy to see you out there!!! Cleet- sucks to see you drop out already, but that’s how it goes sometimes. Great job so far team McFarland Racing!!!!
Fucking Driver! Excellent save cleet!
good job guys!!! poor Mulley hope she feels better soon
MY GOD IM SOOO HAPPY TO SEE THAT BEAUTIFUL RUBY RED BACK BABY!!!! FUCKIN PERFECT BABY!!!! FREAKIN LOVE THIS CAR MAN! When you retire her seriously! Put her in the freedom factory hall of fame! She belongs there already!
Damn
Hell yeah brother
What a frickin save Cleet! Glad you're ok brother! Ruby's back my dudes!
Man I love the race week content
I’m so glad Ruby is back and looking Snazzy at that
Cleetus did you see Bill Hoskinson talking shit about Mullets fuel injected motor?
Honestly, wouldnt be Ruby without the Belt squeal.
Cleet was trying to see if he can take mullet to the sand drags
Hell yeah brother!!!  Nice driving. Then tbm's working hard!!
Sorry about Mullet brother.  Get that trannie going and test her when you can. But good luck to the team!!!  Just support the team and try to have fun Brother. ❤
You know what they say. You'll have that on them big jobs
hell of a drive from the ol giraffe to slow that bug girl down. Balls of steal my guy.
Ruby a good lookin car damn
Let's thank God for TBM brakes 🥺💪
Just seeing that intro I must ask what blasphemy was that , a tube chassis drag car driving in mud ?
TBM'S to the rescue!
Man I missed Ruby! She's Back!
Did a REALLY good job of threshold braking there. That's some driving!
Looks like it’s time to send one of your guys to transmission school so you can start servicing your transmissions complete service after every big event, full tear down and rebuild
how did you doe that
Fkn breaks my heart dude
That man did not sound happy at the end of the video.
DAMNNNNN ruby is fuckin nasty now, i remember when he first got that thing from the auction. It looks fire with that hood😮‍💨🔥
Cleetus is now taking the carbon cub for the rest of sick week now that mullet is out let’s go ruby
I was kinda worried I'd never hear another Buenos dias from George. Made my friggin noight. My Buenos dias sticker is starting to peel
Man congratulations to all you guys 🤙🏼 I was hoping a trans for mullet was in the future to continue the journey but dang that stinks ! Cheers brother the team will carry home a trophy 🏆🤝🏼
Dang, to bad even after that sketchy save and all the rear end work. Bummer glade you and the car are okay tho!
Calm the hole way your a real driver there cleet good shit
Those damn mirrors are bad luck! 👎🏻
George's energy is UNMATCHED, he was born for a camera hahaha
Man I was just there for cadillac attack. I hate that I missed seeing all of this in person 😢
Dats racing!  🇦🇺🤜🏼🤛🏼😎🍀☮️
" I hope you breakdown "Your entire crew always makes me laugh
My god what a rollercoaster of emotion. George’s reaction to the 8.500 was so amazing. Seeing Garrett putting Mullet in the dirt made me nervous. Cleet you’re a legend man . Please be safe dude. I don’t need my hero going down.
Drag drift and drive. Mullet is the triple threat.   Show Steve some good times this week, make the most of the no pressure sick week 2024😎
Cleetus… humble suggestion: go straight into the sand trap; never sideways… or the car may dig in and flip. Keep safe.
Looks like it’s time for a Rossler transmission in Mullet.
Pretty sure he drove it into the sand trap and said it had broke trans , cause he is sick of getting spanked by a damn coyote in his billet big block .
Damn I'm sorry we got this next time
Cleet never looked frazzled at all during incident. Dialed fully in complete control one hand on the wheel as he headed toward the sand. He was calm and scrubbed as much speed as he could. Man is insane under pressure, glad he’s ok and it went was well as it could’ve given the circumstances.
fired up bout the 8.50 in ruby (she ain't going in the shed no more), definitely impressed with Mr Sams truck running a 13. Sucks the trans fried on mullet, but I swear that's a 727 filter on the used one
Mullets brakes were cookin! TBM 👍 👌
Project prime should have hooked Sam up with the old Home Depot wrap for his f150 for sick week
Got those TBM brakes glowin!
Hey atleast Mullet got to go off-roading!🇺🇸🦅
FLIRTING WITH DISASTER!!!!
And to think Ruby was almost cancelled to the museum… Let’s Goooo
8.50 with an 000000hhhhhhhh!!!
So who’s the genius who remembers to get a thumb nail photo before you extricated mullet out of the sand? What a high oiled machine your team is.
Tye looking really relaxed.
well technically it is a truck
It'd be cool to see a "Sick Sniper" award. For guys who hit dead on their target ET perfectly!
Ear to ear smiles when Ruby ran that run. Felt like I was celebrating with y’all. Wow.  Dang, sorry about mullet. That all nighter transmission swap had the makings of another great story.
Mullet is a Kat. Spending some time in the Litter Box.
Brake rotors were glowing and shooting sparks on that stop!!
Ok is it time to  experiement  put a bruno  conv. drive  4 speed airshifted  liberty in mullet ,  automatic tranny costs seem to be increasing this is the umpteenth time tranny issues/ longevity ie  hp  eaten issues  , if you dont like it zach will just yank it out and go back to m&m.
Well this surely sucks ! I was looking forward too this five day event with the mullet ,,, nice try
Glad yer alrite cleeter. Cars can be replaced, you cannot
Should have grabbed a spare trans from Steve .
bruh the thumbnail, heart attacks
Too bad for Mullet, but I'm sure happy for Ruby's 8.50.o😊
James is such a better driver than Cleet. Cleets ego holds him back
Ruby pulled a Roman Pierce, said: “I’m not going back to jail.” And ran a PERFECT pass.
I knew an Elcamino was a truck not a car!  Proved it by off-roading!  Jump in McFlurry!
Well dang.
You can hear the dang lockup on mullet
Damn brother, sucks they won't let you grab another car.
4wheeling in mullet thats a 1st glad it was not worse and your ok, sucks for steve he had a crazy crash i saw it live
Keeping Mullet off the beach made the trans ragequit much less of a hard hit in my eyes, it still sucks but it can always be worse, stay safe brother.
Let's go ahead and remove that hitch when racing.
You started with 1320 and you had a bad sick week but you and Mullet wrecked and drove away that’s a win big man. Sam in that stock truck. Love y’all sorry Cleetus!!! Bye
The first guy in the video that had a wreck gave you crash energy he jinxed you😢
Bummer dude
Crazy cool thank you
That’s racing sorry about the transmission.
I think the next thing for the ranger is rear suspension
ive been watching the live stream at work the shop manager loves it old school guy who had a drag car back in the day catch him wallking by going god damn thats fast
Ruby said “I was here before that grey truck thing, and I’ll still be here when it and it’s tailgate are gone. Watch this”
Thats a tragic turn of events for mullet.. on the other RUBY putting in work like a boss. You might as well grab the Dale truck run against Ty
Damn the SmX crew is not having a good run at it
even though i already knew you were safe after the run i still got choked up watching this, stay safe out there. <3
George is annoying AF
Garrett - If it was easy. Everyone would do it! I'll stick to trailering.. See you @ Bradenton
I love it I was just telling my friend about this video I walk outside and watch cleetus McFarland and the whole crew roll right past my house in Brooksville. much love stay safe and stay blessed brothers
The knowledge between Pete and Steve is incredible
Good job getting her slowed down in time any faster and hitting the sand sideays could of turned her .
I can’t believe no one has one near you
Bummer. Glad the chute issue wasn’t worse. Go Ruby
Deammm 😮😢 but bless and good luck an amazing driving skills what is Sears have paid off jajja
Dang that sucks mullet is out of the race. Your team works their butts off to make these cars ready to run and get this content and we all really appreciate the level of professionalism you guys have. Great family of guys.
Kudos for staying that cool when Mullet’s parachutes didn’t open. My eyes would have been popping out of their sockets. You were totally in control of the situation. Amazing to watch!!
Here’s a comment for your transmission! May it RIP! ☠️
Yet another (unfortunate) example of why TBM brakes is the goat of all goats
You found the next week leak after fixing the rear end. Sounds like you need to get with Steve and check out his research on trans he has put a lot of r and d because of this with big power. Go cleet
Did you hit the boost scramble or the transmission scramble?
Damn that’s tuff 😢. We only get 2-3 drag events a year now and it seems the last two were just wasted.
That sucks brother but im sure the mcfarland race family will carry the team to the end.. next year.😢 hey ruby did her job..
Everything happens for a reason, don’t sweat it man ! Loved going to cleetus and cars in Baytown ! Great memories
That was the most adult closing remarks, and adult decision I’ve ever seen on this channel. Cleeter is pissed off, now watch what happens…… this will be good. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Just got off work gonna watch some cleetus and cook some wings with a brew
Bro those tbm brakes were glowinggggg. Thank god for good parts to keep us safe
Jack stand 850 with the double 0 in fire up on that
Ruby’s hood looks sick!!!
Finish the drive in the blue truck or borrow the wife’s car
George is the hype man everyone needs
cleetus come to cecil georgia at SGMP!!!!! We've hosted pinks and pass time, come check us out!
So sorry to see that mullet had to go out that way on day one. Amazing save at the end of the track though. If your driving skills weren’t what they are you could have done a lot of damage to mullet or yourself.
🔥🔥🔥
Your mullet is just to short for mullet lol.  Good luck with the rest of the cars.
Yall I must say those tbm brakes put in the fucking work I'm throughly impressed, even being on them hard they still held up and didn't glaze over and give up
Nice Save In The Sand/ Dirt ! Sucks About Your Tranny! 😢 Great Job On Ruby. 👍🇺🇲🤠Yee Yee
Them TBM breaks put in some work!
I need to know where the heck is the blazer
loosing because too powerfull , not that bad i guess
I called it as soon as I saw that four link. And when that trans is replaced, they will start to tear up rear ends and drive shafts.
How come we didnt get to see you flying around with your stealth?!
Do you think the parachute didn’t come out because of the speed and aero on that area of the car ?
I loved watching all the sick week cars drive by as I worked today. Was hoping for a trailer burnout but no luck.
Bad luck mate hope the rest of sick week goes good for your tean
I've always enjoyed how you handle short comings and issues that normally would piss someone off. The temperament you show is one of the reasons I subscribe. We all have our bad days, it's how we deal with it that matters. Thanks to the whole crew.
We all know tye's ranger can go faster then 11.00 should be around 10.30 if not faster
Whos the ass who gave you a fucked transmission? Thanks for the help dude! Jesus.
you're a cool customer Cleetus.  Those brakes were not!  Nice save.
Ol’ Sam living his best life. Lol
Don’t you ever scare me like that again I’m so glad you’re OK. More importantly I’m glad mullets OK
Ugh poor mullet, 😢
A mullet silhouette, MacFarland off road shirt should happen....
LETS GO Jackstand Jimmy!!!
Sam!! What! When!!
U win some u lose some but u live to fight another day , u n  Mallett will be back better then ever 💯 ❤🏆🏎🥇💪🫡
The whole team still did a great job on Mullet.  - You guys still have some cars to keep running for the week. Have fun with it still 🩷 - Thanks for another great vid 💯
I don't know what brakes Alex Taylor has, but she stopped a 6.79 run with no parachutes! 😂😅
Great pedal job on that run man, those TBM brakes put in work! Definitely need TBM to make a commercial or Ad with mullet smokin those brakes after a Shute failure
To short a shut down at Orlando! Hate it for you guys!
Boy them tbm brakes putting in work the rotors glowing😅😅 glad you are ok Bud.
Damn good save Cleet!! You really are one hell of a great driver!! Me and my son always sit and watch your videos!! Be safe brother! You got kids to come home to now!!
Sorry man!!
Unfortunate for Mullet but let's go RUBY!!
those TBM's got a workout!
Ruby’s turbo sounds so rad. Love that thing.
Ruby always delivers
Steve is such a good guy!
It gives me great joy to see these guys putting their gifts together as a team, function as they do, & still giggle like my six year old at vehicular awesomeness. Rolling with the punches.
So someone sold cleet a bum trans?
Such a shame 2nd year in a row mullet has transmission issues on sick week.
Oh my goodness Mullett looked stupid fast once it hooked.  That's crazy.
TBM’s putting in WORK!
Shit happens man.
Cleet and Jackstand.. great Fn drivers... True Drivers
total florida man moment: launching fireballs out the exaust right past the gas can. 4:10
Dude I fucking felt that 8.50 when she spooled. Go Ruby!!!! Hell yeah! Gasped audibly and scared the dogs lmao
Oh, reliable Ruby
Look Cleetus, even if mullet has to bow out you are still so far ahead with that team and this content. Nothing says true leadership like being humble when the dice didn’t roll and picking up the camera and wrenching with the guys. This is why your audience loves you and your channel. Go McFarland Racing Team!!!
When you look at how far automatic transmissions have come it's amazing that it can hold that much power at all. Definitely need a spare and quick change installation.
Proving again that people should upgrade their cars safety components before any power upgrades. If those brakes weren't up to the task. This video would have been very different or not posted at all...
Tuff break at least you still are gonna have fun .
You cursed Ruby!
Man I live close to MnM transmissions if it's the ones out of jc mo. They build some nice trans for racing
Listen hear me out. I’m going to start something I hope catches some traction. Big Chief’s camp against McFarland Racing’s camp. I think the people would freaking love to see some type of collaboration. I’ll post this on every video from now on… on both their channels. Who’s with me??
Great driving!!!
You drove that mother fucker  What a pro !!!!!!
😅 I can't believe that truck ran a high 13
Yall need to start prepping for sick week by practicing in the cold mornings - probably would be more prepared for the real deal!
Helluva video! Ruby is NOT going back in the barn! ♥️🇺🇲
You can't park there, bud!
Tiny brakes and 200+ mph smh
Steakhouse? Not eat your microwave shi*?
Ain’t no stranger that’s a Ford ranger
Well dang brother!
Couldnt imagine the panic setting in
Tbm brakes absolutely screaming
Great brake control, keeping them from immediately fading. Very nice.
That's why I spent all day today looking for Mullet 🤦‍♂️ damn that sucks, but well, next year for sure and I'll probably get to participate with yall next year, that'd be cool
Epic!! youll get it together as always.... but jus want to say ,, personal opinion, i really wish aniite to 187 customs for another big race would be awesome!! he says in almost every video he loved it and wants to go back!    lets gooooo!!!!!
Nice stop at the end Cleetus! The concern in George's voice is real, what a tight team.
Just curious how much power mullet makes? I’m assuming it can’t be dyno’d, but ballpark? Like are we talking 2500hp?
Cleetus Now you can fly from track to track ....... Thoughts?
My boy cleet was working those red hot brakes boy! Whooo that’s driving! Dang.. scary..
Damn, Ruby’s first pass literally gave me goosebumps! She’s like “I’m back boyyyyyys”
Way to handler  ol son good job
Things to heavy. If it means winning, re chassis that setup.
Just had to wheel the pickup truck eh?
Tbm brakes and the fluid you got in there did amazing tbh, never lost braking force, you still able to lock em up hot as hell. Also they look to have cooled super fast when you did your manual abs, that saved you watch them glow and then go back to nothing every time you let go of brakes super proper
time for a CVT
Love Pete, and the man is golden on the laptop, but he might be bad luck on race weeks.
What a shame. I think we’re all more disappointed than you. But you know what, you and the car are safe and will race again soon.
Great f’n save cleet! Shout out TBM
I waited to watch the 1320 video until I watched yours
My guy. I absolutely love that after that ass clenching event the first thing I hear is "WOOOOO". Correct response lol.
Tbm brakes were glowing!
The most truck thing I’ve seen mullet do! That could have been real bad. Gave them brakes a workout.
Ruby & her bald eagle screeches.
Damn. Sorry man.
Tpm breaks for the win.
here in ZA we call that car a bakkie. You thwrowing lithe Cleet is another story! Hell Yeh Brother
We have McSmokems , and back from retirement McSqueakems!
Boy fried them TBMs
Loving the extra angles 👌🏻
James is such a fun and important part of the channel. Always fun to see him have success. Works on the cars, drives the cars, 8.500.
TBM BRAKES FOR THE WIN!
Cleet runs er into the shut down: Woo! 😂
Garrett is the ABS 😂😂 GREAT driving bud
expensive day for mullet and cleetus.  rebuild one trans and buy a backup
Does anyone know what the black smoke is at the big end. 15:44
Dont get me wrong  I love watchin ol cleeter drive but it is so sick seeing more of the boys out there on the channel racing.
Can you launch the plain off a moving Mullet? 😮
Shoutout to TBM Brakes for keeping our boy safe. Do you know a better driving giraffe? What skills!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Who wants to see Tye go ALLL THE WAY?
Dude... Awesome driving!
Im not saying that Ruby is more than just "The Auction Corvette" But I think WE TOLD YOU SO
Ruby did it for ed
.
Nooooooooooooooo😢
What. A. Save.
I hope you put some new brakes on mullet before you run again. Those puppies were glowing when you hit that sand
When ya got 5lbs of danglin’ meat between your legs, all you can do is paaarty brother…. Mullet just wanted to party…, and he did…..!!!
Damnit Man! 🤦‍♂️. Hella way to go out.
Without the hitch , Mullet goes 6.72
Great vid! Great save cleeter! A little cameo by Jeffery Lutz OBS 26:20… love me and OBS GMC!
Ruby the bracket monster
I guess it was a good thing that it the trans mess up. If it didn't could been a lot worst with going into the sand
Love me some Ruby!!!
Need a race between cletus and  on dgas team
Hahah mullet broke
Really cool stuff! Fast cars.  Goodness.
Yo let's go ruby 8.50 spot on wow.     And holy shit dude those breaks were sooooo hot red-hot!!! Dam that was awesome  killer save
Knew Ruby wouldn't disappoint!   Cleet...told you so. 😂
Ruby & Jackstand might be my favorite couple
A. So glad you were okay Cleetus! B. So awesome Mullet drove out! C. Go kick some ass RUBY!
Well Dang! Main thing is your alive and everything else will be fine. Good luck on the rest of the week.
Let’s Freaking Go!!🏁🏁🦅
K my dying wish is to do a drag and drive with the McFarland race team . And hear George like a morning rooster signing Buenos Dias 🥰🤣😂👌. Have a great week guys. And every team finish off safely 🙌
Steve is an awesome guy. Glad you are okay.
"At least is got a couple gears" Pete always catches me off guard 🤣
Dang Mullet!   Go Ty!  Love seeing the crew getting in laps!
You guys oughta frame that Ruby slip!
Good driving Cletus!
I love the Wooo! after he hit the sand. 😂😂😂
The whooooo from the suspension cam caught me off guard 😂
You've got an excellent attitude Cleet, good on ya brother.  Enjoy the rest of Sick Week!
19:30 them TBM brakes work boy!!!❤️❤️🤘🏻😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That sucks!
Nice run Tai
Tye's ranger is so good! Love that little ripper
😢
Ruby said she wanted the rest of the day off 😂
Ruby is a workhorse. Got her sticker on my toolbox to remind me to be the same.
Unfortunately Mullet needs lots of upgrades to get the most out of that SMX in the classes it's forced in. It just can't compete with all that weight and lack of backup parts.
I think we can all agree a +1 on cleeters ability to stay calm and a big +1 to TBM Brakes! Do it for Dale!
good call, worst thing to see is mullet hurt 👍
Glad your safe man. Could if been ugly but you know that.  GET ER DONE!!!
It's so hard to hit the thumbs up on this video.. great video but damn Mullet in the trap and then busting the trans on day one is such a bummer...
We need more of Tye’s Ranger on the channel. I’d love to see what that truck can do once he gets it dialed in.
Two is one, one is none. Get three transmissions!
You mean that Mullet DOESN'T HAVE A SPARE TRANSMISSION!!???😮😮😮 That's it,you have to sell the snowrail!😂😂😂❤
Sorry about Mullet, but you still have a couple of contenders in there swinging!
That sucks man. Who ever sold ya that trans had to have known it was blown, or at least something wasn't right with it.
😢😢😢😢
pull out game ole mullet said ur done ginne my applepay card bub
Jackstand Jimmy, Standing Tall, and Setting the Bar, "With an O!"
Anyone know what all that smoke is from on the big end other side of the trees??
Fun Fun and more fun 😊
Wow, y’all make a good team. I’m glad everybody’s OK. I pray that you have a good week and everybody comes home safe. Have fun fellas.
Bummer Mullet is out but I think it will make for a fun week of commentary/video work. Gotta look at the bright side.
Ruby out there looking SHARP!!! That hood is awesome.
I feel like you were accidentally made a commercial for TBM brakes. The sparks on the four link view was awesome.
my stock mid 90's 300HP Corvette ( auto ) ran a 13.8. I thought Sam's truck would be a good deal faster.
Take that ball off while running then put it back on, might save your life/ maybe more
When Steve says "I'm gonna let you take this whole case". I'm middle aged. When I was in my twenties I had older mentors say things like that to me in the same tone. You can tell how guys like Steve and Tom really seem to root for this team.
That's racin baby 🙌🏁
Time to hire a transmission guy
Great job
shoula never put ruby in the barn ... girl is READY
LENCO, LENCO, LENCO!!!!  just like McFlurry
at 226 MPH Do you prefer breathing in carbon fiber over asbestos ?  8:04
I don't care how reliable any part of anything is, there is no such thing as an indestructible material of any kind. Everything eventually breaks
bro that twin procharger setup is god damn wicked steve knows how to do it lol also such good braking for cleeter he saved it good
I love the drag and drive videos. A little disappointed theres no FREE live stream like in past years though.   George, don't let Cleet take that camera, you do an awesome job brother!
who sold you the trans fuck that guy lol
Your big time now idc what anyone says. Now you are gonna have to carry a spare everything at least one of any single part that cane break. Cleetus you're the man and i love you and your whole team you guys are just the BEST . Keep up the great work and God Bless you guys and your families, stay safe brothers 😊👍💪💯🙏🏼
Damn that guy who sold yall the trans is very messed up selling that broken pos trans
THE LEGEND IS BACK ONE AND DONE RUBY IS HERE BOIZ
Ups and downs man, just like life. No consoling a true competitor, get em next time!
Ranger hits boost real quick
i tell you what, man... if i wasnt sold on the tbm brakes before, i am now! lol
I love watching the team grow and keep doing better and better, and it’s amazing to finally see Ty actually doing some rips!  I can’t wait to see him grow on this channel as well!
Man that transmission going just sucks, can totally see Cleetus is upset at the end and totally cant blame him, but seriously guys, im just so glad hes ok. That last pass could have been so much worse
8500hhhhh
Bummer Garret .
That sucks about mullet. Time to keep 2 transmissions, a motor, and a rear end on deck. Congrats to Ruby.
Ruby almost missed the trip -- Now Ruby is going to save the trip. 8.50!! Lets go Ruby!
What a freaking driver. It was sliding back and front. Then the whip at the end. Bravo cleet
The composure on the overshoot was impressive, well handled cleeter
Why no carbon front end?
Woooo
Shout out to Cleetus's driving ability. Glad you didn't get hurt. Glad see Ruby doing good. Was hoping to see some good numbers out of Mullet  but that's racing. Great job team!
Fuel can right next to the exhaust. I too like to live dangerously.
2 stepping right on startup bad for the cars?
Thank you tbm brakes for keeping cleetus safe!
rossler
I don't know this for sure, but it seemed like James and George didn't get along in the beginning. I love seeing them be total bros now.
Trending!!!!!
Hell yeah brother! I’m sad to see him go, but I love he left the way he did! ABSOLUTE UNIT! Mullet is the G.O.A.T.
Only people who run their cars off the end dont have spare transmissions😂
Doesn't Steve have an extra trans you could borrow or buy??
You can tell it’s early they woke up from the morning dew on windows  Must of been a beautiful fresh smelling morning  🫶🏻❤️🙏🏼🏆 ☀️ 👃
TBM brakes glowing red hot, putting in the work to save mullet
Dang It!!
great video cleet !! can someone tell me if these are belt driven turbos or some kind of superchargers on sugar momma cars ??
You Cant Park There Cleetus
I can definitely tell that you  are totally bummed. That sucks! Look on the bright side at least you were headed back towards the shop anyways. There’s always next year!
I love all the cars but Ruby looks so good. Sam is having a blast, GOOD DRIVING CLEET. Close one
even though i knew he was safe before i watched this i still was like oh sheeeeet brother as he reeled it in. GG Cleeter
It fills me with so much joy every time I see Cleetus and crew are trending on YT. Hell yeah brother 💪🇺🇸
Great news you know how to drive with a shoot, running under 7 seconds. Instead of a new transmission, be able to carry a rebuild kit? ( clutches soaking in a zip lock )?
Damn man, Mullet was on a rip before the transmission gave out..
LOL George right back where his career with Cleetus started. Riding in Ruby for sick week.
I just found out the prize for the next freedom 500 is a helicopter
Glad you made out big dog 🐕. Sometimes the sports we love and or our hobbies can be dangerous glad it wasnt for you or mullet.
Duuuuuude! You held that soooo clean! Good earn brother 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
You looked pretty sad at the end. It’s ok, brother. You’ll just have more time to have fun and interact this week.
I always thumbs down a cooter mcfartcan vidya for dale!!!!
Alright gonna have to buy a new hat 😂 that one looked expensive
Sorry to see it Cleet, it is what it is.. what racing is all about. You'll be back next time ready to go. Still got a solid team going. Have some fun and enjoy the week with the boys!
I love watching jackstand get pumped
Truly sorry  about Trans  but really happy u r good  after no chutes never seen rotors that  color red . Have a great week
I'd still take that intake apart and make damn sure there aren't any rocks in there. I hope that "good" trans didn't cost you anything, aside from continuing with the week. Sucks bigtime, but Mullet will be back!
That transmission better have been free. That guy probably knew it was cooked.
Darn it…
James coming off that 4.4 win last weekend boy is on fire
Mullet needs a Liberty transmission. No more automatics
The power glide in Ruby seems to be the way to go, good luck fellas
TBM FTW!!!!!!
:(
Damn brother…. That’s sucks but hey it could’ve been worse given the chute situation, thank goodness you’re a hell of a driver cause Mullet is still in one piece and so are you 👍🏽  Ruby going out there and showing out though! Dannggggg, she is not down with the barn accommodations 😂 Best of luck to Tye and good ol’ Sam in their classes. Safe driving out there boys
Tyler’s work got tested in the spin out Gezz. Glad it wasn’t too bad!
I've got to say seeing tye out there ripping it up is awesome, hopefully we get some more content in the future with him and his truck!
Good save bro.  You exited the tarmac almost perfectly.  Glad that you and both of your mullets are ok.
Glad your alright man
I purposely didn't watch the video on YouTube that someone in the crowd posted before you did!
Girard oh hmm: make a 25 minute drive
Thata boy jackstand killing it in the tree grate job boys 🍻
Its as if Mullet knew if i dont shred this slush box right now me and my dad are going straight through the sand trap and into the back fence and we might both die lol what a good boy Mullet is and yes its a sign time for you to take a breather i think this sick week there Father Cleetus that hitch had a evil plan for you and mullet seen it coming lucky boyz you are Cleet & Mullet.
Damn thay sucks but thats the risk u run buying a used transmission hopefully u didnt pay top dollar on a crap deal also
Put a Alison transmission in it
😱😱😱😥😫😫😫😫😫
Man this channel used to be so good
Lets go mullet!
Good lord. Might wanna go ahead and slap a fresh set of brakes on mullet. They been gettin the work
So good to see Ruby back out of the barn. James, you're one heck of a driver brother! You cut that 8.50.0 light PERFECTLY too! Congrats all! Cleetus, unlucky on the non--deployment of the parachute, good to see you're all good and didn't have to put it further into the beach. Enjoy Sick Week because we sure are! 😎
damn good driving cleet!
damn good stop brother couldnt of done it better
if that isnt the greatest endorsement for TBM brakes idk what is lol
ol' Cleeter out here thinking Mullet is a drift car too shoooooo buddy
Ice water in Garret's veins, cool as a cucumber on that last run, wow!
Belt squeel ruby's battle squeel
Mullet vs Safari GTR in an offroad battle when?
Gf good call. Rip. But let's gooooo ruby!
Well hell at least you were able to drive it back to the shop and sleep in your own bed! 😅
Ruby is a MACHINE!!!
Man I'm sure a big part of it was being super exhausted from no sleep, but you can most def see how bummed ol cleeter is about mullet being out of the fight. Its all good brother you will come back stronger like always. Much respect from Columbia, TN!!
Sad to see mullet out, but glad you are good.
10:10 Ruby and Jackstand hitting that perfect 8 50.0 was insane
SMX MAKES TO MUCH PROWER!!!!!!  REID NEEDS TO RETHINK THE HP RATIMG OR BUILD A BETTR TRANSMISSION!!
Excuse me sir, you cant park there.
When it said “Rubys target time is 8.50” I already knew what time it was💪🏽
Ruby seems happy with her heart transplant. Dialed in! Meanwhile Mullet has not fully recovered from his surgery and is a bit out of sorts.  You boys stay safe out there.  No more playing in the sand box!
Looks like it's Leroy time
Just think mullets capable of 5,000hp which is over 10 times the hp of the factory engine
Dangit!!  That's a crap way to start/end sick week.  At least Ruby and the Ranger are dialed.  Frickin' Ruby!  One. And. Done.  Let's go!
I must have missed the reason why he put the steel front end back on mullet. Can someone fill me in?
soo happy for ruby what a dialed car, HELL YEA BROTHA. nice run with mullet and sad news but what about a rebuild kit? relitivley new to drag racing and high hp so dont rip me to bad lol
You handled it well with the malfunction. Way to keep it under a controlled crash landing😁
I didn’t look at the thumbnail and got so stressed watching the video that I didn’t finish my dinner until it was cold. TBM Brakes saves cars and lives!!
Did anyone else get….”separation anxiety”…. At about 19:17 ?
Sorry about your car being out on the first day.  It sucks but that's racing next time
Not mullet pulling the tires past the 330😂🔥🔥🔥
I mean mullet is a truck so 🤷 it can off road too..
seeing those tbm brakes from under that rig was insane they did well and some fantastic driving as always glad your safe
Sucks that Mullet is out, but we appreciate the level of positive vibes you send, and that we can still watch the team do epic racing! Let's go!
Just another great advertisement video for TBM breaks. Glad that Cleet is okay and that there ain't much damage to Mullet besides the trans.
Them TBM brakes coming in clutch huh?
You guys are so assume. If I win the lottery i will build my dream Mopar ride! Keep the vids coming, much enjoyed!!!
only way cleetus didnt ruin mullet was he driving skills and those TBM's
13.70 for Sam!!!!! I had no idea those were that fast stock, wow.   And ruby, you beauty! What a run.
Mullet Is A Fucking Monster, Fucking Pulling Wheelies Half Way Sown The Track, I Bet He Was Doing At Least 150Mph When Those Front Tires Lifted Up!!
🙏🙌🔥
Tye needs a tonneau cover. He'll pick up another half second at least..
Definitely gonna need some new tires after that ride 😅
TBM BRAKES FTW!
Ruby said I ain’t going back in the barn with the rats.  Let’s go!!!
That “Whew” when he stopped.
God damn cleet is a DRIVER, to not send it completely sideways on the big end is incredible
Bummer but smart move
Garrett your a fuckin wheel man nice save brother glad your ok
yep, nothing you can do about the laws of physics, you can't make steel harder than the hardest it can be. also close call but still very lucky! also those TBM brakes still had grip even if red hot!
Idk if yall heard but ruby said she ain't going back in the barn
The spice kicked in like taco bell, good save from cleetus and amazing suspension tweak job, told ya, not a professional but if you do it you’d see for yourself, if you hold the power wheelie and slowly let it come down, she’ll move like a bat outta hell
It’s almost like someone came up to you while you were packing the chutes and distracted you …. Fred…
Well played , at least keep some bands and clutches on hand ….. Alex Taylor knows how to car park refresh TH400…
Who owns the car named Rife ?  Who-what is it named after ?
TBM Brakes for the WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!
That’s a bummer but let’s go @jackstandjimmy
Sometimes broken parts keep us from pushing when all the signs are telling us to chill out. Stay blessed Cleetus.
Great job Tye, nice to see you having fun and not welding! You'll get it dialed in!
Dam brother u can genuinely here the hurt in Cleeters Voice after all that last minute changes everything was cooking & Bookin. im freaking Sick for you my dude dam I would give anything to have one of those transmission to let u borrow just so u could complete the week man spends all that time $ effort that freaking Blows Chunks but as they say everything is ment for a reason after that parachute ordeal I would be sick but content with still have my race car intact to see another day I know this I have never seen Mullet do a freakin power wheelie that far what 300ft or so down the track she is Maken some freakin Steam boys SHEEEESH Man has to sometimes count his blessings 2 never take them for granted 🙏 this is one....Mad Respect
There’s an alternate universe out there where Sam and K.C Kasem are swapped
If the rear brakes were glowing that much, imagine what the front brakes looked like lmao
When Mullet r-u-n-n-o-f-t, I nearly lost it. Glad to see it moving on its own.
How come they went back to the steel panels on mullet instead of the carbon fiber front end?
Steve M. and Cleeter out early. To bad. James really is a seasoned drag racer.  Good times, enjoy the weather.
Great attitude! It happens
Can they be on trailers or have infinite repairs?
Dang was lookn fwd to seeing mullet bask in freedom. Guess ruby will do just fine
And people say mullet isn’t a truck
stayed calm the whole time, good job & great save.. could have been  hella worse
Have to call the ranger Goldilocks
nobody talking about that green stock looking fox that went 850 running quite and smooth must be a coyote
Sux bout Mullet. But great time for Sam and Tye! Gonna be fun watching them learn new rides!
Haven't seen James that excited in a long time.
Ruby looks so good with the hood.that turbo looks like a monster peeking out 😂 Tyes ranger is a monster.
George wearing an AG1 beanie is pretty funny 😂😂
My first time seeing mullet wheelie🔥🔥
Mullet had no party in the back. Thanks for TBM brakes
Jackstand is the calmest person ever down the track!  Just another day on the job.  Kills it every time.   And when he doesn't,  his feedback to the tuner is on point.
I hope someone finds a trans for this man!!!!
I've never seen Mullet move as fast as it did after spinning the tires to still hit 226 mph.
5.92 in mullets future
Glad she doesnt shoot flames. Mighty close to that fuel jug
Someone needs to meet them at the next track with some C6 Wheels with good tires
I love George man! He's just a solid bloke!
Damn! A little hop/skip on the 1-2 shift. Maybe the shock is damn near topped out… travel sensor will tell you of course…   I can’t believe the damn chutes… locking up the tires, driver of the year right there. Just barely scoots sideways, and stops in the trap like a feather pillow lmao 🤣   I don’t know what hot side is on Tye’s truck, but that b*tch spools instantly! Definitely needs a bigger a/r…   Power and weight are a killer of transmissions… might have to look into something a little more beefy… 👍🤘👏
Not watching any more sick week
This car has had more bad luck since the SMX install than it had before that. Obviously, the engine is good, but I don't know what is gonna take to ever win again with this big heavy car!
Stay safe buddy!
Darn, was looking forward to Mullet running all week. Is what it is!
That helmet is way too big for Ty
So good to see tye racing he deserves it and mad respect for building his beautiful beast of a ranger by himself in his spare time also glad cleetus and mullet are safe and jack stand and Ruby are smashing it
When is George getting back behind the wheel? I miss seeing his excitement with every race 😂
He probably spent a pretty penny on that trans too for it to be bad dang
Hey call Steve morris he might be able to help
Was that twin prochargers in sugarbomb⁉️
Angry gretta is an awesome addition to the parts trailer
I have to watch these videos on mute with george on the channel now. cant stand the guy
At 17:36 is that hurt?????
That’s it I’m getting me some tbms
That’s a drag.
Ruby out here setting the tone!!!
Not being able to race mullet might be a blessing in disguise you had both of your shoots get caught on the hitch one came off why it was late comming out other stayed. What if the gear box was fine and you went to the next track and the shoots didn’t come out? Might be time to rethink that area so you are safer just a thought after seeing all of it
Sorry to see Mullet go out, but it will live another day. Best of luck to all of you!
Steve’s case is sweet. I love the plexiglass top. Looks really good
Well hell, looks like you're going to run into Steve's issues with transmissions now... Hope you get it figured out quickly..
Aw man! I’m so sorry about Mullet. Y’all did your best and the new 4 link definitely helps. With a new trans you guys will dominate your next races. Good luck to Ruby, the Ranger and Sam!
Im soo glad you okay brother thank god nothing happened to you you’re my favorite YouTuber I always worry about you cuz you be going super fast in short periods of time anything can go wrong at any second
Glad you’re alright man! I bet that was a helluva ride.
Who else missed seeing Ruby on the channel just killing it 🤘
Ruby is such a good girl. To bad about Mullet but that wheeley was cool........The off roading was a little dramatic........but some mighty fine driving that saved a bad situation from a being a full on castraphy. I think Mullet is maybe a little jealous of Ruby getting all that attention and just having a little hissy before he decides to behave. Good stuff gang.
i think this counts as the fastest flip a bitch in history🤣🤣🤣
ALSO THEM TBM BRAKES WERE PUTTING IN THE WORK
Steve is a solid homie gives the whole box of goodies. 🤟
TBM BRAKES failed again !!!!!..... Steve morris and many other racers have had front brakes fail do to overheating. They look cool but rotor is to small and thin........ Buy Strange -- You can tell by your video front got to hot and failed, you can hear rear locking up skidding, smoking the tires. Even you say they got hot in other videos and glaze pads. BE SAFE.
Handled that like a pro
Fix mullets hood its guna fly off. Lol
GOOD SAVE MR. MCFARLAND
Gonna need a fresh set of TBM pads after that break check..
I feel for ya need to run the sonnax module no more issues
This dude has to have more than one family.
20:30 had to pause the video thought my house was on fire
Mullet humbled you real quick
Thats a shame Cleeter.  Trans troubles... but you'll have a totally different experience this week than you were expecting.  Enjoy it brother and have fun 👍 Cheers from New Zealand 🇳🇿
I noticed on the very first past that the second shoot was way late deploying, I’m sure that was the start of the problem with the second shoot not deploying at all the second time
Sam is a freakin' legend. A man who tucks in his hoodie means business.
I like how stoked they get for a great run no matter who is driving. It feels corny to type this.. but thats what real friendship and team mates are.
I love how hype George was when Ruby went 8.50.0. Love that guy so glad he is on the channel
Its okay. You've got a half million views in 6 hours anyway! $$$
Dammit mullet
WOW!! Thaaaat suuuuucks!! I'm sorry to hear that dude.. yeah, time for a spare.. all of the top Dawgs are carrying spares anyway and you're right up there with em..!
Steve probably has three transmissions he isn’t using now
Sorry to see you're out man but, just think of what other kind of fun you can have at the tracks now that you're not driving! 😅
I love seeing tye out there on the racing side of things and enjoying racing his ranger for once
I like Steve Morris and DR Tunem All but Pete is kinda like a different flavor like imagine a regular not kinda good put could turn into anything chicken tender that's in your local Krispy Krunchy gas station chicken but then all of a sudden some one shows up with real spices and seasonings instead of all the red powder that's under the skin of that chicken now you have salt and pepper  I don't see where you could go wrong     I have edited this to many times in sorry on my phone but it's just an opinion
So sick week with Cleet in the… Towter? Raptor? Neighbor? Twisted Tea??!
JW Performance Transmissions
Ruby putting everyone on notice
you need to get a Rossler transmission they are the best no need for a back up transmission lol
Steve, "I'm going to let you take the whole case", Cleetus " ooohhhh".
Ice in his deggum veins!!  Cleet whoaing that thing down in the absolute calmest of fashion!!
Well that sucks about Mullet, but I am kinda relieved. I saw one of those early upload channels with a title about him being in the sand (I didn't watch it) and assumed that was way worse than it turned out to be. Bowing out over a bad trans is way better than a wrecked car! BTW that power wheelie was sick!
TPM Brakes doing work!! Top tier safety equipment!! Glad to see you got it stopped and are okay - that could have been bad
What happened to the carbon fiber front for mullet?  Did I miss something
Love the camera shot where the suspension rises from the rear end. More of those shots please!
Ruby is the best looking car in the fleet and my personal favorite
Daaang what a bummer for mullet
I love that George is talk to the camera now ! 10:21
Switch it up to Rossler
Love the rear end shot in the last couple videos!!
Looking at the thumbnail, it's about time you started using that like a truck. Next you should help someone move.
Then there is that pesty Snot rocket running 6.35 with a fawd coyote motor off the trailer.😅
Every day I hope to see Leroy with his new body..... Ruby will hold you down!!!
That’s Jack stand Jimmy for you.  Now let’s see how many times in a row he can do it.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Wow. Crazy. Was it a month ago I called out this exact scenario happening? Oh well. Time to go buy more vehicles, trash some tires, ruin some asphalt, destroy further rotting vehicles people use to care about, and make sure to advertize gambling and shill a scam advertizement some more. You forgot this episode. Surely this will solve the problem that occurred. Edit: Well, It seems you threw Ruby together last minute... So I was partially wrong.
Way to go James and ruby my jaw dropped on the first run !!!🤯🤯
All the resources available and you don’t have a spare?!?!
Man sorry to see mullet out but enjoy the week with the rest of the crew less stress have a good time ride with same in the 150
Start doing preventative refreshes for X amount of events and the spare trans just means minimal downtime.
No more hitch balls on the runs. Note to self…..😮
Ruby really said "this is what you get for shoving me into the pole barn for 6 months with no engine"
Been a rough day but after seeing jackstand and George celebrating it  made me lol and have a huge smile
I know Mullet is broke and all, but thank you for the usual excellent content.  You’re the GOAT on YouTube brother.  ❤❤
I was wonder just wondering not hating but what do use win ?
Wow, he handled that so well.
They was gonna shelf ole ruby then she came back and said square up bitch 😂
Ruby will never sit in that pole barn again😂
“Wooo!” From the camera on the roof when it finally came to a stop 😂 I bet Cleeters blood was pumpin right then
Nice driving young man
THOSE TBM BRAKES PUT IN THAT WORK.
Seen a lot of guys tonight headed through town. Only 1 breakdown seen
Ruby deserves her own ruby red trailer to pull.
These are the videos that we love. Jackstand's reaction was just phenomenal
Spun and then did a power wheelie. Mullet was wound up that first rip!😁
i said the other day they were testing with the wrong front clip on mullet
Ruby is looking excellente. Hood looks good on her.
America 🇺🇸 💪🏼🦅🛠️
Yea brother it's time to start having several backup parts...lol...it's defiantly a bummer it happened during sick week tho...🤙
steve morris his trans might work just a thought
TBM Brakes, for the win 😂
Great effin save dude let’s gooo!!!!
Dude the brakes were glowing on mullet in the sand pit. Holy shit that could’ve gone a lot worse.
Those tbm brakes be putting in the work
I’ve never seen jack stand so hyped😂 so awesome
It's all good, support the team, celebrate their everything.
Tough break that’s racin still learned from so not a loss and the funnest crew ever.
I feel your pain, spending so much money and time, only to be killed by a part that normaly never fail. You need a complete spare and tested drivetrain on this level of competition. More money, but less infuriating and stressful. In other words, keep your chopper small, don’t buy a blackhawk yet. :)
Tough luck
Those TMB brakes where glowing
Ruby is my favorite car. Paint or wrap it black cherry candy paint. Black candy. Any colors is just it Naruto Gray used to be my favorite but now I'm just in love with Black candy just makes everything look better
Several of us were remarking how much taller the whole team (even Sam are). Guess it’s because George is taller than we thought and is shooting down a little.
I see tuning at the home track is hurting you guys.  No other track has the prep like Bradenton... might have to dial back the prep before you head out to events like this
Well dang, my favorite racecar out of commission. Let's go ROOOOBY, SAM and TY!
I know I am ranting and never been good with words but where's the spare transmission or 2 even you had to barrow stuff from Steve incase of an engine part failure 9500 rpm won't last forever just a real let down to your fans man for me anyway who looks forward to this. I have said to much but you been very blessed don't throw it away for whim's tell those trying to sell you on crap where your heart is. follow that bud. I really do care man or wouldn't waste typing all this.
ruby lookin all "ka-chow"
Where's McFlurry!
11:28  thats Awsome Jim ! Perfect 8.50 ! You're always so accurate and Fast bro ! Cheers from New Zealand 🇳🇿
In 20 years Cleet is gonna look just like Clark. I mean that in the best way. Clark is awesome.
Shame about Mullet. But I guess it wasn't to be with the chutes, going in the dirt and then the trans dying. On another note, the "WOO!" picked up by the cameras OUTSIDE the car when you hit the dirt had me chuckling. Glad you and the ElCo are ok.
Good call pulling out of racing with mullet ik it sucks i was looking forward to him but that smx gets hurt and thats when u will be saying well crap smx isnt worth hurting because of transmission blowing up plus ya always have 1 or 2 spares just for incase i would even have one at shop just for incase your already on backup
You and George have taken my breath away now, not in a good way.
I feel like you should have vinyl slips of all your record passes on the cars... Break a new record or win a big event .  Make a Vinyl copy of  that slip and pit it on the car ..
Even though that was a ride of fun lol def keep ya self safe!!!!!!!!
I always wondered about that watching these fast runs, what happens when the shoot malfunctions? Seems pretty reliable, but must be a contingency...
I honestly think if you guys make mullet an all wheel drive it will be a monster
What’s that bar for at the base of Mullet’s windshield?
Enjoyed meeting Cletus and all the other guys at Bradenton today. I’m sure he was frustrated but he was friendly and smiling all over the facility.
I'm a little late because, well work all day, but It's time to throw it back to 1320 time ......... Get the camera .... and ...  da plane da plane... the love boat........
I know thats got to be incredibly frustrating
now I like a off roading mullet tee shirt  hahaha...
Imagine spinning and then a power wheelie to 226 mph. And just casually saying that ain't gonna work. Crazy
Sad for mullet😢
Hopefully ruby can hold it down for the team and get the W 🏆
I’ve seen when you ran off the track in another video thought you had the carbon Front end looks  really fast that tracking not Long enough
That 4 link looks fucking great in action 😭😭
You would think with the way computers are now you could dial it in perfect every time. A second or two off.
Best team award without a doubt. Keep it up fellas!!
Damn son, hate that for you. Time to added a couple new super built transmissions to the parts bin!
Least when it comes to mullet you can get both rebuilt an have a spare around, but understand the frustration and sure you will still have fun with the team :) an all the other people around.
TBM breaks still did a fantastic job!
Dang it man
That's a racing part's lifetime warranty- the parts will live until the second they die - Guaranteed!  Spare transmission on hand sounds like a great idea.
U goin to tx2k this year cleet?
Him pumping the brakes and not just standing on them is what saved him
Can I get a #7. NO.
With that new rear end Mullet is hitting its prime. That freaking El Camino is fast AF.
Mullet looks so much better with real headlights in the front.
Let's go Jimmy 💪💪💪
Rip Mullet
Bummer but the ol girl ruby still in it to win it baby.
NOT MULLET!! Bummed, but we still get go see the other whips getting it done! Freedom rings, brothers
Maybe a Rossler trans next? Glad youre ok Cleet! no chutes no joke but nicely done👌🤘🇺🇲
Dude that sold you the trans is a prick
James the index Killer !!
Next year Ty can compete with Ruby in the 8.50 class
Have a backup for your backup!
Yoooooo that guy sold you a bunk trans?
So now Mullett is a real truck!! 🤣
Pour out a 40oz for Mullet. RIP
Ruby keep doing that!!!
5:15 She is always ready. She is like a golden retriever; trustworthy.
I know you guys are disappointed, but at least its still in one piece after that chute mishap. Seeing Mullet and the team on the drag and drives are my favorite videos.
Dang. 13.7 at 101 mph for the stock F150
Someone get this man a transmission asap please
Bro those tbm brakes were glowinggggg. Thank god for good parts to keep us safe
Ruby is just a race car.
Yea well he learned not to make any pulls with a hitch and got a hitch in his gitty-up blowing trannies with mullets in the sand..  grross..
Dude that sucks. Mullet is out but as you said, You've got other cars in the race so do what you can. Bring the Pom-poms Man. LOL
Thanks to the one guy who was ready to push the stuck car... @20:24
So glad you're ok Cleeter!!
Shirt on a spinning turbo omg u lucky
Damn that sucks for Mullet but Ruby seems to be dialed and Ty is getting there with the Danger Ranger and Sam seems to be having good time all the best for them and Mullet will make comeback stronger and faster than ever
Oh, man that sucks!  I am huge fan of the program Garret has going her and I so look forward to seeing mullet run and do good.  Trust I am jealous of his rides and things he gets to do but I also know how hard Garret works.  He still edits these shows him self.  That alone is work and half.  Then being a father on top of everything.  Garret when do you find time to sleep?   Just was looking forward to seeing Mullet run all week.  Just hope Garret is keeping his eye on that 16 year old kid nick named Crew Chief.  He's a star in the making.
Well settles that swapper into travel mode time to pop a brewski open Watch cleet do his thing now
Cleetus has been hanging out in the dirt with HeavyD too much lol. Mullet is not a truck
You should have got a transmission off Steve!
Glad to see all you guys behind the wheel.
Is mullet in the class with the big dogs? All big tire and pro mods?
Man I know Cleet doesn't want to throw M&M under the bus - but there are other trans shops out there that I'm sure would love to have a shot at putting a unit in Mullet.
Take the supra 😅
George cracks me up. 😂😅 Good luck guys!👍👍
Total bummer for the Mullet!   Love you guys, thanks for sharing.
These things happen Garrett, you've id'd the issue, already come up with a solution for the future, that's all that matters in the end. Sucks that SICK week is out for Mullet but Rocky Mountains still out there and world cup.
also Adam the woo @TheDailyWoo filmed a lot of this and it was his first drag races, he even got some footage of Steve almost crashing and Ruby and Mullet in the pits!
Ruby woke up from an over one year nap and threw down a 100% PERFECT PASS! Unbelievable! 😮
Cleetus. This wasn’t your first rodeo, show the Tim bailey ride you took, gave you some sperience in ooops,
Awesome episode.
Mullet doing off-road truck stuff.
Mc who? Ruby is the one.
So glad you’re ok Cleetus…scared the crap outta us all brother!
Fire red brake discs. Best to chabge the disc and brakes. Great brakes tho. Stopping power.
The fact ol cleet still says whooooo an handles it completely calm is legit! Glad your okay brodie
George sounds like he has a good voice. You should make him sing a song for us.
Big bummer…
Just Glad ya Didn't Cook Yourself Cleet 💪
Zach always smiling I love that guy I can see God in him
Now it’s time for the other guys to shine!!!!   Team McFarland!!!!!     Go Sam go!
In that undercarriage shot. You can see the damn brakes Glowing. Glad Cletus is safe. God dang.
I would never ruin it for myself.
"Drag radial" aka slick lol
Cleetus is a master of the automobile. hands down best drag, drift, offroad, in the air, on the water driver that has ever been
Mullet is a savage beast and I love it. Thank you guys so much for all the effort you and the team put into making this something special that truly inspires and unites all of motor sports at a personal level and not a corporate level. Thank you for giving me something to watch with my sons!!
Those tbm brakes puttin in work!!! Glowin and sparkin bringing that beast to a stop!!! Glad your ok!!!
So that guy sold you a blown trans
Hell of a driver bro. Beautiful work on that save.
Whats going on with the blazer!?!?
Why did cleet have that lump in his pants after that 2nd pass!
I don’t care what anyone says Garrett handled that beautifully and for the size wheel they’re running he’s got the best brakes money can buy wonderful job cleet
DAM that really SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
My goodness, Ruby with the perfect 8.500 on the first run was unreal!!!
To bad you couldn't borrow 1 of Steve's transmission's he has cause he won't be using them this week
HOT DANG THEM BRAKES WAS WORKING BROTHER!!!!! Yea buddy, God is good brother and so are them TBM’s my man!!!!!
Hey Missy 😍
Man, hate to see Mullet go down like that.  But it is what it is.  Anyway, did anyone notice Mullet's run for the sand trap, that the rear springs left the seats by almost 2 inches when the shocks reached the peak of travel?  That's bad!  If a spring gets cocked under one of the adjusters, it will upset the car when the weight comes back down on them.  Need longer springs guys.
That 8:50.0 is actually crazy mind blown 🤯
I saw the "mullet in the grass" footage yesterday and thought it was from a different year!
Mf rocked a 6 second car out of the dirt 😭😂😭 Florida man strikes again. Stay safe brother
Why cant we run the carbon fibre front?
Noooo! I really wanted to see mullet all week!
Those TBM brakes might be light, but they don't seem to have enough metal to absorb the heat of stopping mullet, they were almost on fire doing that emergency stop
It's insane how temperamental racing is at that level and those speeds.  No wonder these pro teams have literally dozens of people working on them 24 hours a day.  Sucks but Mullett will be back.  A learning experience for sure.
Plus the myth did it with no dash!!! S/o jackstand!!
It might be time to change the fluids after every run ! If you cant afford it , sell the airplane !
Tye’s ranger should be named “White Sheep” just saying.
Ol jack sparrow got the 8.5 flat that's sixkkkkkkkk
Nice little ksr fab burnout
Man that was a short shutdown area. That could have been way worse. Great driving
Go steal steve Morris's extra transmission. He aint racing
at this point i dont know why Garrett isnt always carrying an extra of everything he's broken multiple times. Better luck next time for mullet, Ruby is gonna have to hold it down for us.
Even the most reliable best performing cars have to break down eventually it sucks to see it fall out of the event but there will be more to attend later
Tough break brother
@1320video should not be doing interviews while drivers are packing chutes lol
Holy crap dude, saw the run yesterday and freaking got worried for a second there. Think we need a bigger chute...🤣Good luck and get first brother!
Those freaking brakes brother!!! Red hot saving your ass! Hell of a ride hell ya brother!!!
Glad you're alright man that was pretty crazy and Ruby ain't going back in that barn lol.
Tough break cleeter but how bout a big hell yeah for tye and jackstand
Tye needs to work on his tree reaction all in all hes doing great but the tree can make or break your race yall keep up the amazing work an we will keep on watching
So awesome to see James FIRED UP !
Glad you and Mullet are safe and sound bro
Where is ruby’s tractor flap?!!!!
The guy can freaking drive!! Nice save! 🇺🇲
Guess mullet pulled truck duty.. glad your good.
Hats off to James on that perfect run!  Boy can drive!!
RUBY SAID LET ME SHOW YALL SOMETHING REAL QUICK. 8.50.00. HELL YEAH BROTHER
keep a motor and trans that are ready to go in the trailer... you'll have 90% of anything you'll ever need
I mean, i like mullet but i fucking love ruby 😍🥰
Whoever sold you that transmission shame on them
Well a good friend of mine always said "Your not racing if you ain't braking shit!" So throw in a back up tranny and be safe! Thumb's up
Ruby is out here showing she doesn’t deserve to sit with no engine in it
James Taal, you are one bad man. Mullet, you are NOT a trophy truck.
Good save sir😮😅
Your fancy dancy transmission is messed up and so is my week of awesome mullet action. Thanks for trying brotherr!
21:40.. keep straight..Any more speed getting sideways in sand and she's rollin..keep er straight Cleet..YEE-YEE🏁
This is what makes Ruby one of the best. James casually makes the perfect pass, looked like he was just on a casual Sunday drive.
Tbm brakes for the win
good thing mullets turbo's are mounted high
George's momentary delay reading Ruby's time. Calmly read the 8, then completely loses it. Love it.
Tbh waited for cleet an fam to post until I watched any of sick week! Who else did the same!! I was tempted  but didn't wanna ruin the video lol
I like how the breaks where red hot
Who else did the audible " Gasp " when the step bit broke through the carbon door 😂
8.50 with and 0 that’s impressive
Tyes ranger is the best one out of mullet and ruby
tbm brakes putting in work
How's Brett running 6.2 something on radials
Come on Cleet! Do a redneck rebuild on that trans and keep going.
My heart drops when I seen what happened. Then seen a replay and the 1 chute that fast is scary af
those mullet socks
You drove her tho bud
At 3000+ horsepower nothing is a given and everything can be broken.  Nothing is reliable at that level.
I seen the. Drone footage of this and from it  y'all got check it out its wild old boy was on one lol🎉
So happy you are okay, look at it like this though... you get to watch your friends race while kicking it it with your new family. You will not get many race events you get to just chill, enjoy it!
Geezus christ, glad you're OK buddy!!!!
Someone should probably tell these people starting a cold engine and reving it is not to fkn bright! Cold seize is definitely a thing!
The Wooo at the end of that run made me LMAO.
I hate that the ads always start right as the bald eagles start to flap their power attachments 😂
12:32 why is that guys face blue from the nose up?
Those red hot brakes!
Why does Pete always have that i dont wanna be here vibe 🤷🏽‍♂️
You are right at that power level your going to blow up the transmission it’s sucks  Let’s go Ruby  Ruby kicked ass
Tye is no stranger
Was admiring the 4 link doing its job then noticed the glowing!
Tye an zac together on a sick week. Heeellll frigginn yaaaaa !!! Or so i hope LOL
What happened, happens when street cars run in the 6's! So don't complain when it does happen! LOL.
Just put it in the barn...
great brake control damn son!
Are the tbm brakes supposed to light up like carbon ceramic brakes
8.50 with an 0. That's one hell of a machine!! Ruby's not bad either!
Remember when Leroy was the only "serious" drag car on this channel? 😂 Seems like an eternity at this point. Now there's more legit Cleet competitors in the parking lot of a single event than anyone could have ever imagined. Sweeeeeet!
What happened to Mullets front fender? Looks like a slot-hole in the fender..
Nooo!! Ive been waiting for drag and drive content forever! Ruby better save the week darnet!
You know it was a wild ride when you can hear Rick Flair on the go pro under the car🤣
Cleetus  would it be worth installing a emergency back up chute?
You're killing it bro.  One transmission at a time....😢 But seriously this channel brings so much happiness to my life you wouldn't believe it!❤ thank you Cleetus and all the rest. Sam is having the time of his life!!
How do a lot of these cars pass tech at a drag and drive event without DOT mandated safety equipment like having windshield wipers? Its state law? I don't even know how some can get licencing and insurance? If they do get in accident the insurance company has stipulations that vehicles have to be road legal.. 1 little thing is wrong and they can deny claim! I don't know how these people can put their livelihood at risk without everything being on the up and up! 1 accident and someone gets hurt and you would be sued into complete dirt!
Steve’s wife’s twin supercharged Malibu looks sick!
Epic run by Mullet anyway, great job Jackstand and Ruby!! WOOO! enjoy Sick Week!
James + Ruby = UNSTOPPABLE🏁🏁🏁🏁😊
Bro spun, hooked up and wheelied😂
Eats clutch for breakfast
Should not have gotten a new helmet. All mullets luck is in the old helmet
Let’s go Ruby with a 8.500!!!
Who thinks Pete and DrTuneemall should be a permanent members of McFarland Racing?
First 5 seconds of the video could pass for whistlen diesel
You need to start pulling shuttes before the finish line. When running a 200mph pass by the time you go threw the motion of pulling, lever your past finish line 200ft
Super Bowl win for Ruby damn!
That sucks.  Ive been in that situation it does suck but the whole teams a bunch of troopers and its still a team thing so it will be fun.   Im ready to see ty start drivin with u guys tys awesome
Goood F’N driving Garrett!
Sorry you guys are out. Will keep pulling for the rest of the team!
Thought the hood was coming off the ranger along with the fenders😂
Ahh maaann!! Gutted for you that Mullet is out. Stoked that Ruby's back though, she's the consistency queen!
Full on Commentary/Videography by Cleeter videos coming up.  George better put on a fresh hat for all the screen time he’s about to get ✌🏽😎
What was the reason for the rag by Sam’s exhaust? Is that to catch any moisture that comes out on the launch?
7:43 was that mullet's first power wheelie?
Sure am glad you got Mullet stopped . I would of loved to seen Cletus's facial expressions as he was getting ready to go in the sandbox . Dang I hate that for you being out already . Come on Ruby !! Hell yeah Brother . 🇺🇸
That was some driving right there.
How’s the form on the guy that sells a junk transmission to someone in desperate need of a working transmission.  Jerk move
Honestly that track shouldn't be hosting such fast cars with such a short shut down...
i prob missed it but what happened on the driver fender?
I don’t know about y’all but for me Ruby look so strange with a hood on
Good save cleeter!!!
It's just Ruby's time to shine. Mullet will get em next time!
You win some you lose some it happens but at least the ruby is still in there
One of Steve's trans maybe?
I dont know Cleetus looks like Ruby has a new boy friend ,got hand it to you cleet got that boy to a soft landing glad to see was still functioning.
Sucks Mullet is out but you gotta know when to call it
Imagine  making over 1000 hp and not having a spair transmission my car makes 850 and I have 3 spairs
With all the Instagram spoilers I was looking forward to the hype from George for the 8.5.00...he didn't disappoint 🎉
Glad you're okay brother
Where is mullets carbon front
Don't worry Ruby will carry the team.   Can we get a Taco Bell run in the Dale Tuck for old times sake?
Glad nothing back happened cleet. Great job handling the incident
More Assphinctersezwhat that that transmission can handle.
Is it wise to do a 2-step check with the fuel bottle next to the exhaust that is blowing fire out of it?
Kicking puppies with ruby again
Eat sleep break repeat!
Mullet makes a crosswind slip landing into the gravel.
My first pass at BMP in my 2002 Trans Am, I stayed in the gas past the trap (trapped 108 @ 13.5) up past 120, then realized the back half of the track was disappearing really fast. By the time I put both feet into the brake pedal, the ABS kicked in and I was doing a 360 in the dirt pit at the end, lol. The guy at the ticket booth yelled at me not to do that again, and believe me, I wasn't planning to. Easy way to learn that lesson.
😂😂😂 ruby said not today brother send mullet to the barn let's goo rubyyyyyy
Lets go Ruby !!!
God damn glad you’re ok!  Brakes were almost molten
Mullet made it home all you can ask of her
I need a George in my crew! Love that guy.
Cleetus what does the hose going to your helmet do? I’ve always been curious.
George losing weight?
James is an animal. 850.0 crazy
Yo F the guy that sold you that busted trans
Did you lash the valves on mullet ?
Tuning into CleeterTV!!! Loving the steady content
Glad your ok bud !
Sorry cleet. I know how much this event means to you
I’m just glad my boy knows how to fucking drive and nothing happened to the car. Shit was sketchy just watching. Can’t imagine actually being in the car. What size underwear you wear? I’ll send you a new pair
I wonder what would happen if Leroy's transmission and left side pedal accidently fell into mullet... <.< >.> Nahhh but sorry to hear Mullet isn't gonna make it the rest of the week. Either way. I'm still wearin' my Jersey for the team boys! Good luck to Jackstand, Tye, and Sam for the rest of the week!!! May your runs be filled with squeaky belts, Sketchy 10s, and Smooth 1370's gents!
Should start drag racing snowmobiles
I can't believe Mullet is done already ! I am even more surprised that a Race Team doesn't have at least 1 spare of every single part of that car ! Seems crazy to me.
Damn I wonder how much Cleetus got scammed out of that transmission 😢 bet that guy won’t show his face again
Yes, you've either got to have a spare, or choose a specific number of full hits to have it completely rebuilt.
What happened to carbon front end on mullet
When a car is making 3500+HP, and what im assuming is ~2000FT/LBs of torque, the fact that the trans lasted as long as it did is a feat of engineering.
Cleeter venturing into different areas of driving definitely prepared him for that one.
WOOO
As many two step checks you do constantly heating that trans up on the brake it’s no wonder it’s burnt up at that power level
Everyone shout out to james for winning the 1/8th mile class this week for the first time ever in his 4th gen Camero
The 4 link camera angle of mullet was so sweet.
Can you use another car to finish the event?  Just for fun?
might wanna freshin up the brakes after that last pass too
You should have two or three transmissions on hand. Ask Steve to borrow one of his.
What is going on with the drivers side of the hood on mullet
RIP Mullet. He sure does sound rowdy at 9500 rpm BTW lol!
I guess Mullet is a trailhawk? 0.o
Damn my Girl Ruby is Kilin her Comeback Race... that's what Im looking for 5.0 on the 1st Run
Tough to make a call like that so early into the race but when you are at home, and know it will be more expensive to do something else it is a great call.  can't wait to see how this saga ends.  cheers.
Keep your head up you’ll get um next time
I love the signature Ruby belt squeak
New t shirt otw!!!
I know its not the main part of this video, but the smile on Sam's face made my day.  Love that he's a part of the team.
What about a Liberty’s Gears transmissions? I see some Bonneville top speed cars running Liberty clutchless transmissions. I know they also have their Extreme-T transmissions. Idk how they are for street driving but I know they hold a lot of power!
Bummer dude
Pulled the chute late and remembered the hitch. What a ride
Sorry Mullet is out, but I’m proud of Ruby and Jackstand!  Ruby is my favorite car because that was my dog’s name.
Very thank ful nothing else happened when the chutes didn’t deploy.
Ruby's hood looks more like a Toga! I love it!!
New to the channel really want to see victor like he said he could make the supra go 8 sec with easy...now that really excited me cnt wait for that video
Just like to point out as much as that run went wrong, the transmission slipping slowed it down enough it didn't go into the sand and roll over, you got someone watching out for you.
Knocked the tires off and then power wheelies it….    WOW
Jackstand is on fire 🔥
8.500 the hole in one of drag racing.
Sorry you're out bro but pretty happy you didn't get lock the rears and roll at 150mph 😊
The "WOO" after the car finally stopped is exactly why I love Cleetus
Man that news made alot of other people happy. Mullet was gona win it all baby!!!😊
Old jack stand Jimmy is a good mechanic and a better driver
Good job at getting her stopped!
love the drag and drive content some of the best and favorite vids.
Whats all the smoke from past the end of the track?
One word rossler
Dude who sold you that trans is a punk
Im going to build a barn and threaten to lock my cars in it when they dont run perfect times
Thank goodness that mullet is a real truck love it
Any idea what caused the trans to start slipping ? Just wear and tear from All the events??
sorry buddy I know you like your drag and drives 😢
Glad you are good Cleetus, the most important thing. The second important thing is that you best outcome you could have had and the car is in one piece except the transmission. Now we need ruby to win it for 8.50 class
well he didn't make it to the trees
😢 Very unfortunate. I hope the rest of the team will have some better luck! 🦾
Damn I was so happy when mullet hit that 6.7 something then after that I was bummed good job Cletus for keeping it together even through a unfortunate situation 😔
Think of the bright side. All the time u will have to edit and post videos. We will be waiting for day 2 buddy😅
Sam wants to live the out the dream Cleet!! I say give that man hrs prs let em go 6s!
Ruby does not want to be a barn cat anymore!
I love how every camera angle you can hear Cleetus say Wooh!
My heart skipped a beat when I watched him go off on the stream if we lose Cletus my world would be shattered.
Isn't there a sensor that can read the translucency of oil? If it falls below you get a warning? Or check the dip stick more often.
Get your money back for that trans. What an idiot to sell a broken trans!!!
Way to got tbm!!!  Saved mullet
Those TBM Brakes just did a SOLID for the USS Mullet. Whats even cooler is that they are still good to go for the next run! TBM for the win! Glad Cleetus and Mullet are safe.
4:50 I never thought belt squeal would fire me up, but here we are!
Get onto Steve,, he has a 6 pack of them in his trailer
Need a drag and drive for YouTubers. If you use this idea you need to quit using the same song.
Shoutout to those TBM brakes for keepin ol Cleet and Mullet safe when the chutes failed!!! Them things were red hot and still putting in work
You can find a transmission dont give up
4 cars awesome guys. Other than Pete co-driving for Cleet,  who’s co-driving for who ?
Well that sucks. Get it fixed and go again next time
George is so annoying. If you dont think hes annoying then do you think hes funny?
Jackstand with a win at ultra street and a 8.50
Sorry about your transmission, at least mullet and yourself is good to go another time, enjoy and keep going fast and safe !!
If this doesn’t prove TBM Brakes, idk what will
If mullet wins a mullet rolling chassis replica giveaway and if ruby wins a corvette giveaway and if both win a supra giveaway lets gooo cleetus GET’rrr DONE
Where's the carbon fiber front clip? Oh,wait...no headlights in the carbon clip...lol
Youre too fucking heavy... every car u own 60 foots quicker than mullet... but thats the car u spend all the money on?? Make it make sense... mcflurry would run 5's
Man that rear end is working good
I like how the auto generated captions say that Mullets engine purring is music
How old are those 'chutes and how many passes have they done? would new ones help and keep you safe going fast? if they are old and stopped multiple 220+ mph passes are they at risk of tearing off etc? i know one got caught on the hitch but why did they open late? something mechanical? cables worn out ? Driving this fast needs a lot. Not only engines, transmissions and new rear ends...
nobody talking about the jerk that most likely knowingly sold cleet the reckt trans. Such a bummer mullet is out, I will be cheering for the others
Hearing the trans eat right through itself on the 6.70 run sucked big time!
I wait on the buenos dias every race week video 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Jackstand's middle name is now officially "Dude Perfect"
This is message number 458 of "I want Cleetus to buy George a new truck" campaign. Cheers
where's the in car camera footage of that joy ride?
I'm fired up for this week... let's go
Cleet you’re a god damn wheel man . That’s all there is to it,you can see the focus in your eyes! Good save brother !!!!
Your first checkpoint was Port canaveral, I recognize that and your second checkpoint was bizarros pizza. 😂
So glad you're ok buddy! Since I know you are, sending my extra prayers to Jimmy Dale for a speedy recovery. He got burned really badly.
Mullet sounds manic in the last run... jesus crist
Thats racing  unfortunetly could be prepared as anything and something else could happen. Luckily your safe.
28:36 hold up!!!! That's bizarros pizza right off the intersection of A1A and 192. You boys should have told me you were coming to my side of Florida I would have bought you a pizza.
'8.50 with an O' should be the next shirt.
Seeing Jackstand hit that 8.50 with Ruby first try will bring a tear to a glass eye we missed her
Thank God for that amazing driving skill and to know to put it sideways🎉
What a real life test and advertisement for TPM brakes. Slowed him down that much and didn't fade with only 1 chute and coming out late.
Jackstand reading the slip but telling the replay of the run is priceless lol!
It's time for a C2 promod with mullets power plant. That power moving that weight will never be reliable. Idk what that will mean for mullet but yall are creative.
Get George a real race car of his own so he can enjoy the festivities too……not the blazer
Why does drag racing come up with such stupid rules?
💪🏼🔥🔥🔥
Ruby says, "you dicks should not have left me in the barn all that time, i am perfect"
Next time for ole Mullet
McFarland farming. Worlds highest horsepower tractor
Ruby does NOT want to go back in that barn
TBM's!!!!
Cant believe that guy sold you a bunk transmission bro. That sucks ass. Have Jackstand give him a home visit mob style  for everyone watching
Oh thank God you and mullet are okay, but jeez that's too close for comfort
Dang man tough break you should definitely keep a spare or 2
What a driver... That was a flawless save. Sorry bout the trans.= \ Rough turn of events but this just adds to the wonderful stories you'll tell later on. You're still the GOAT to us Cleet!
I thought farm truck was a different color....out in the field any everything.
if this doesnt make you want to buy TBM brakes then i dont know what will convince you
I truly hope he didn’t actually buy that other transmission from somebody that tried to pull a fast one on him
Glad you walked away from Fred, George.  That guy's about as useless as they come.
Put a bed cover on the ranger. And add a little weight in the rear JS
220 into the sand. I'd be changing my pants
who needs a sandrail when you have a six second drag camino
Mullet is back
On the bright side you now have a spare transmission.  Just need to pay to have 2 rebuilt at once this round
Noooooooo!
Good lord.  Look at that filthy blue Silverado in the background.  Does the owner ever wash it?
Not to be a dick. Why do you guys always run into these problems? I guess it's hard running a YouTube channel and going to races the last bit of races. There's all these problems I think. Not enough testing
Live stream the freedom factory laps?
TBM Brakes on 🔥 that was a good save
Brother that trip in the sand scared the bejesus out of me as I saw it live! I thought Mullet is done for sure. Thank God you were able to save it. Already enough that Steve crashed his Wagon.
Glad your ok Cleeter
Sorry for your luck buddy. Glad you survived the beach. Lets go Ruby!
Sent her a little to hard there bud.
So sorry to hear that brother. That Trans probably made it longer then it should of. Ol Mullet pretty rough on her... RIDING her hard Putting her up wet!!!!
I mean, a little off-roading never did hurt a Chevy Truck!
3:16 fuel right by the exhaust no big deal lol.
If mullet isn’t an ad for TBM breaks I don’t know what is.
You and Parker with these off road cars! Glad your ok
Seeing jackstand that fired up is f***ing  amazing, love you guys! I’m literally grinning from ear to ear seeing him that fired up
Man I saw another video before this one and I’ve never been choked up more waiting to see what happened. Stay safe out there cleetus.
Glad ya didn't die !!! Maybe it's a sign ..  Camerman is also a good job title  As well as all the other hats ya wear ...  Just don't die....RIP KEN BLOCK
Ruby is playin for blood!  She wants their souls and she wants them now!  Well done boys!  Keep em rolling!!!
That 7.15 pass was crazy pedaled twice big time then still ran 226. That thing was cooking with HOT grease.
Wow! Ive seen cleetus have more facial expressions when driving the spark. No scared expression the whole time of trying to stop Mullet. Just pure execution of that brake pedal and steering.
Cleetus transformed in to Joe dirt pretty quick
Mullet finally got to do some truck stuff!!! Lol!!!!
What kinda gearboxes does promoderse use? Turbo400? An allison would prob break pretty fast? I have no proper understanding so if you wanna tell me why im dumb, go for it. I just want to learn😂
So awesome you guys get to do this. I really made some bad decisions in my life. Glad I’m able to experience this incredible event through your videos. Thank you
1320 distracted the Cleater while packing his chute. I think i know who I am blaming for chute failure
I will be at the Gainesville track to see y'all tomorrow... I was really excited to see Mullet for the first time.... but...  it looks like that isn't happening... I also wanted to see Steve Morris' wagon but it decided to hug the wall :(
Suprized you didn't include when you crashed the plane
Glad you are good. Way to stay calm.
I'm so glad you all work hard at safety - things happen.
Mullet poppin wheelies at 100mph+ is frickin nuts!
God bless Cleeter! Stay safe❤
Garret, y’all know the chutes not deploying was count of 1320 video, distracting y’all while y’all were packing the chutes…😜 Kiddin’, but feel free to use the excuse. How bout switching Mullet over to the Bruno-Lenco from McFlurry, and air shifting it?
Cleeter is a hell of a driver.  I think it needs to be said every now and then.
With mullet down I'll put all my cheering towards tye and the ranger
Its ok mullet will come back ,better. He was just throwing a temper tantrum because you added metal   fenders, and radiator back on! He was like extra 300 pounds and drilling holes in my carbon fiber is no Bueno. Brother said we aint going backwards on this deal. Put my carbon front end back on and get me some carbon quarters, and tailgate, and take that fuel cell off my back😅
That 4 link is doing work!
Get it done brother. You gave it a good shot and you're not totally down for the count! Ruby is gonna pull in the win.
Spin +wheelie AT 226. Mullets HP's are breaking himself, down, down, down.  On the bright, Ruby came back smiling shyly.  What a unit!! Just point her and send it. Btw, congrats, Jackstand. Had the Maro up and scooting. Good job fellas.
That was a perfect example of what to do when your running out of runway. Great driving!
Cleetus, no matter how rich or famous you get, YOU always pack YOUR own chute, godamn it son. Not cool.
Daaaaammmmn who jinxed it i think zach has the receipt for that one.
@5:00 no better way to warm up your car than a 2-step check!
well done sir. kept her together. credit where credit is due....!!!!!!
And theres a good fire in the background, prescribed burn or what?
RIP to the Mullet trannies!! But HELL YEAH RUBY! Lets go Sam and Tye!!!!
That freaking sucks dude but I'm glad you didn't blow through the sand and end up in a wall got to look at the silver lining
Man what a run for Ruby, 8.50 the best possible outcome. Sucks about Mullet though, cleets right he needs a backup transmission handy.
Ruby said this is my drag and drive I show use I staying out of the barn
damn cleet glad youre all good! that was some drivin to not let that car hit the sand too hard and not spin it before.
James is a machine in Ruby. 👍
James is a stud!
Daaaang tough break on Mullét. Next man up,… LETS GO RUUUUUUUUUBY!
Cleeter drives so many different cars and shit that he forgot he wasn’t in the snow rail
Ya we're going to try and be close to a 8.50, proceeds to do an 8.500 on the first pass. Go Ruby
Is good yo see tye at the wheel.
Mullets rear rotors were glowing in the rear and dam that car was separating some serious travel good luck to the rest of the team 😎👍🏻🇺🇸
Cleatus and Derick are aome of the best embassadorsnof the sport.
Hey Garrett I know you rifting and stuff but probably shouldn’t be doing it in mullet even thought your a driver driver and do so straight or sideways makes it a big plus. All jokes aside glad you’re okay and also hope Maddie is alright and hopefully she wasn’t watching live. Cause she definitely don’t need that stress with the little one in the oven 😅
Thank God youre okay buddy 🎉
Cleetus saw parker off roading his lifted hellcat and said hold my mt dew watch this and off roaded mullet
That sucks guys. nothing you can do but smile. hoping for Ruby and the ranger and Sam ofc
😮Trimmed facial hair!?
And yall wanted to park her up. Just saying
James do an 8.50  Ok..😂
them TBMs saved the day! they were glowing something fierce!
You need to put the red white and blue  on there that thing will get it done
That’s some damn good drivin into the sand there cleet.
Put a Lenco in mullett
That’s the reason why her names mullet man, she’s been clean for too long so it’s time let her redneck side out 😂
FUCKING LOVE LOVE LOVE seeing Jackstand and Ruby at it again!  Hell yes
James is a MENACE on bracket racing. Amazing to see him do his magic!
WHERE IS SAMS 2 STEP!?!?!? 😅😅😅
Love that you can hear “Whoooo!” from every camera
Day 368, chief needs a Barra swap
Running deer is acting like Coop the Poop don't want invest in spare parts. I have to deduct points, your no longer a Big Dog. LOL LOL LOL  Ruff Ruff Ruff another one bites the dust. LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
Ruby’s turbo sounds the best
I hate liking these types of videos. Let's hope Ruby and the ranger finish the week
Hell yeah brother, glad you and Mullet are okay!
James is a natural born bracket racer
Who would've thought both Steve and Cleeters SMX's are out due to transmission issues.
What is a scramble button?
Cleetus should really get into Top Fuel Dragsters
When you run with the big power you need lots of spare parts especially in a heavy car.
Nooooooooooo‼️ 💯%🤦🏼‍♂️💯%
Congrats to Jackstand and Ruby for making a perfect pass! Too bad Steve doesn't have a trans on hand, like in his smashed up Roadmaster.....
The video I was waiting for, glad you’re fine and mullet too
Cleetus is a boss, handled that like nothing. Another day at the office
That manual ABS was clutch. Good on you for always equipping your cars with damn good brakes as a backup, because that could have gone waaay differently.
Ok so mullet, then drive toter home and let everyone be comfortable the whole trip.... and fill it full of other cars parts.....?
You’re done!!!!!
Mullet is a drag car not a drift car silly
Dude....... I'm stoked you're ok. 🙏
I think a removable hitch is in order if that's in the rules ?
I am Loving this sick week already
Never seen a car spin then proceed to wheelie. Just nuts how much power that car has
Ty and Sam gotta name their trucks
😞😞
So sorry about mullet! You'll be the best dang camera man ever. I was just watching the 1320 video and the B2 too! No way... let's goooo James, Tye, and Sam!
Listen Cleetus, I know your the main character but we need more Tyler and James anyways great job team great content
Pete reminds me of lynard skinard
From 220 mph to towing shit lol. Gotta love it
Hey Cleeter, the important thing is that youre okay, and you had a freakin blast out there. Racing for prizes is great, but being safe and having fun is vastly more important. Looking forward to seeing Mullet set a new PB sometime.
Im pretty sure mullet is 0 for 3 making it through sick week
ive said it before and ill say it again - safety check i swear, since ken block passed, there's been at least half a dozen close calls / near misses on big number channels   you've had brake failures, now a chute failure...it's past time for a safety sweep, close calls should be wakeup calls  you're an idol and inspiration to so many people; live that legacy until God takes it away, not your own hubris.
HELL YEAH BROTHER
James "007" Bond??  more like -- James "00" Jackstand -- licensed to drive
When that hit 8.50.0 I nearly jumped out the window 🥳🥳  LLLLEEEEETTTTSSSS GGGGGOOOOOO
Glad you're all right but your 4 mph short of your record without a shoot. remember in Tom's224
Those TBM’s PUTTING IN WORK!
That's at Bithlo in Orlando.  That strip and lane is where my pretty much stock '85 Porsche 928S2 ran a 13.86 @ 105 in 2003.
I said it on Nate’s channel and I’ll say it here.   Holy crap James is a wheelman!  I swear the McFarland team is in its prime!
Well this sick week is going to shit for me , all my favorite cars are not making it past days 0 / 1 . Mullet gone, the wagon gone , guess we just have to see if maybe Jeff let's cam pull a 5 out the back and see if ruby can win her class . Damnnn this is disappointing but glad you survived the sand  pit cleet and onto the next
I must say, I'm quite surprised that this wasn't already planned for. I mean that's why you pull the darn trailer...maybe the plane took up too much room.
Well dang, even if Mullet is out, I still enjoyed the video 👍
9:30 bro, no one can work the camera as good as George, idc what anyone says, George is the MAN. The glasses lift/squint was A+, never seen George a single time IRL but I love the guy lol, never change George, never change!
You been hangin' out with those Diesel Bro's too much....4 wheel'n Mullet???
I bet Tye has to put a weight box in the bed
Props to how one how good them brakes are and 2 how good mullet is off road
Cleetus can drive.
Get some proper brakes. Those little tbms are not up to the job if the chutes fail. You're lucky that one chute fully deployed otherwise it would be game over thanks to tbm brakes.
That sucks.  Hopefully the seller will make it right for you though.  I wasn't so lucky last year.
Dually noted, always pull the pan when buying a used transmission lol
Off-roading channel coming soon.
-- *_Cleetus bites into a slice of humble pie as the sun rises in the East._*
Hats off to Mullet😢
jackstand need to loto
That really sucks
It's funny Dr. "tune em all" is never used as the tuner if the stakes are high. I am not sure he can tune em all 🤔
Can’t tell you how sick it is to see your cars in front of the Cape Canaveral tower and then at my local pizza shop on the beach!! So sweet!!
Time to upgrade to ROSLER TRANS and CHANCE Converters. Do it right and get a backup while at it
12:12  RIGHT ON JACKSTANDDUDE!!!! :)  AWESOME RUN~!!!!  :)    like LUKE...   USE THE FORST....  forCe... ;)   as in JONFORCE LOL  OOOOHHHHMMMMMMM :)  SEE IT AND BE IT AND MAKE IT HAPPEN !!! YEEEEHHAAAAAA :)
Put some Lucas in it!
I mean....El Camino is a truck so it should be right at home in the dirt, right?
8.500 is crazy 9:54
😟
That could have been so much worse. Fantastic job.
The rear springs did nothing for almost the entire run lol
Mullet out there doing truck stuff.
OMG mullet is FAST!!! Tunnel vision time traveller lol
take 5 mullet, time for ruby to shine AGAIN!!! woohoo
I only saw the thumbnail from a different video and it looked worse, so glad Cleet and Mullet are okay.
pulling chutes pretty late
Let's just admit it.  Ruby is the shit, the Queen is back and bringing the smackdown.  I'm just happy as hell she's back.  Hope you can get Mullet fixed.
TBM brakes are legit
I'm so mad cleetus mullet was the number one competider man that sucks go cleetus it's k  she did awesome can't complain what so ever😊
You should put a pair of boots on the rear and see if they will drop straight when you launch
So unfortunate that happened to the trans. I guess better now than later when you’re up in Georgia. Atleast she’s home
Dude. You in the sand, saw on PPV/FP and holy crap!!!  Steve and then you. Those safety crew was at Steve in less then 5 seconds. And right to you within 30 seconds to get all the way back there !  They are a killer crew!! Mad respect!
Man y’all need an air mouse  to work the tune for air density changes might be more consistent
Fleet is a fucking driver bro this dude really can wheel
“Alright boss I gotta go take a 30 minute poop” (I’m on the clock)
TBM true and tested
Hope they let him do some exhibition stuff in the F150 or something to still tag along and make some passes.
187 said you need a rosler
Noooooooooooo!!!! Was soooo looking forward to this weeks fun and frolics with Mullet. Gutted you've had to pull out. Go Ruby, Tye and Sam.
I hope today is a repeat for the most part. Good luck guys. DO IT FOR DALE BROTHERS 🇺🇸🇺🇸
You know leroy sittin' there saying put me in coach! 😆 if only you could.
If you can't remove the hitch maybe you can fab a carbon cover that snaps over it to avoid this in the future.  Glad you are safe Cleet!
Just saying, good thing mullet is technically half truck!
The live stream has been awesome this week!
Should hope your butt in the Mustang and go have some fun.
I swear, that "little red Corvette" has got to be the most consistent car they have in the entire fleet.
That sucks cleetus
It's Ruby's time to Shine!
Video shows exactly why TBM brakes are trash.
Those TBM'S are the MVP
19:47 then brakes where hot hot 🥵 😂😂😂😂
Most important thing is you are safe and no real damage from the sand pit.  The transmission deal sucks for sure but you did make it home safe and sound.   Good luck to Jimmy, Tye and Sam, I’ll be watching the live stream!
I think Pete need's a new jacket, it's looking a little ratty. Pete need's some McFarland Racing swag!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25:35 need to toss 100 pounds on the bumper
James is a machine!!!!!! Mad respect 👍👍
Sorry Mullet is out, I know how annoying it is when you just want to drive and have fun and show him perform. All part of getting bigger and better really, an order of 2 transmissions ain't a cheap one. Let's hope he is back in action soon.  Need to ask, why did you swap the front ends over too?
I was really worried when you didn't turn...took quite a while for the coverage at the big end.  Glad it came out ok.  James is doing a great job with that perfect 8.500.  Saw you this morning without the race suit on and figured you were out but the other three will still put on a show.
As soon as you said you'd never broken a rocker/pushrod etc, Steve immediately knew you were jinxed and sent you off with the whole case of spare parts. What a guy!  :) Hope he can get his car patched up and running again soon. It's definitely a crowd pleaser.
I truly wanted to see mullet do something great 😢😢 Is there another transmission that can hold mullets power? I know the m and m is a good trans but how can it be made to live a lot longer?
Jack stand looks like he’s driving to the grocery store 😂
Man that sucks
those breaks kick ass my friends. look at them glow during lock ups !
I liked this video, but I hate the end.
ROOT 4 RUBY !
That was crazy,  time to upgrade to 3 chute maybe 4 Garrett. That was a fast run.
I had 79 Mali good solid car for drag  highly underrated
Yeah, ”TBM For the win”… Give the disc’s mire surface, more surface on the pads and maybe one more caliper. After that, you can shout tbm for the win.
Ranger still to fast if he didn't spin in run 3 he would of probably still been to fast.
Man that back camera angle on mullet really did something for me..
Ruby said naw never put me back in that barn. 😂
8:00 second car Corvette,I need One!!!😮❤🎉
Morris has parts available now.
Time to swap in a 220k mile 4L80e from a work truck !
Damn might as well back the blue f150
14:48 are those some forest fires in the back? whats with the smoke?
The ranger needs more weight in the back to hook was a good video 💯
Sucks that cleeter and mullet are out, but kinda looking forward to the videos he's gonna be recording haha
I felt the 8.50 hype from here! Jackstands the man.
Sucks mullet is out but like you Said nothing can truly be "reliable" at that power level.
Bummer dude, but now you're the hype man for the team, riding with Sam now?
the picture of mullet in the dirt needs to go on a t shirt asap.
Ruby says shes here to stay, what a first pass
Soooo at this point in time Mark this video. Ty is now a full racing member of the crew. Just like how hack stand and George started . Nice
Please make a shirt that says “new tune goofin” plllleeeaassseeee:)
4-link was doing work. Unfortunate about the transmission. Pretty soon you are going to need a trailer big enough to tow an entire car's worth of spare parts in it. You saved yourself from a massive clean up job on that sand. Just look how Tavarish is still struggling to get sand out of his P1 and its been taken apart entirely.
Send those rotors to TBM for some R&D inspection!
Wow great save top driving
Gotta keep er outta them rhubarbs.  Rhubarbs and mullets don’t go together!
I wish I could ride along with you on one run in mullet!
no no no, you forgot to say one thing.... "Fuck That Guy" that sold you (assuming he sold it to you) that trans. That's some bullshit. Put his face and his information on the screen.
James n Ruby being so cool, meanwhile George is over the top.
I have missed ruby so much.
Great video
4:25 might wanna move that can of race fuel away from the exhaust 😂😂
Love Sam but I'm a bit curious how he can tuck a hoodie into his pants and be comfortable haha
Dang, sorry brother y'all work to hard for this to happen but as you say, "You're gonna have this on those big jobs". Y'all are still young and I'm sure we're see Mullet back up and running at the next event. Okay boys, it's time for Ruby to shine as we know she can from today and Tye buddy this just became more than a test and tune for the Ranger, you got shop honor to uphold. JK Y'all have fun and a great week, set backs happen don't let it get ya down. Take care and God Bless... Had to edit because I forgot our boy Sam in the brand new F1fitty, go gettem Sam...
Been waiting for this vid, sucks about mullet and I'm still hoping he found a spare trans, and that 8.500 pass! Holy smokes!
Go Ty!  Great run.
One thing I would like to point out is how observant, and how much attention he was pay the entire time, that is a wheelman!!!! Awesome job
Dr poopin pants
Lets go Tye
For the 100th time get a Rossler Transmission!!!
Those TBMs working hard
Jackstands wins in the Camaro and then runs the perfect 8.500
Teamwork makes the DreamWork!!!  LETS GOOOO
Let's go jackstand
Sheew.... N dam. The car lifts off thr springs completely...lol
Dang sorry for the poor luck guys
Ruby is looking amazing with her bikini hood back on.
Great save my dude!  Mullet deserves a new set of brakes after that one!
took Ruby down the strip for 8.500 and had an open drink in the cup holder, baller
bummer
RUBY IS FIREEEEDDD UP BROTHER SHES READY TO RIP! 8.50 ON THE DOT LETS GO GEORGE!
That sucks I wanted to see mullet chase Jeff luts down I like Jeff but the competition between you two would be great to watch
What is all the smoke off in the distance? Saw it yesterday on the live feed all day.
Great save Cleetus.
11:38 James is on a rip. He got it done in his car now he’s getting it done in Ruby. Jack Stan is the man.
Well,good news on Ruby for sure but unfortunately not for Mullett. Tye is doing okay and hopefully can get his ducks in a row soon. Sam in his new Coyote powered F150 running a 13:71 is pretty impressive to me. That truck isn’t light running that quick is really quite good I think. As long as the truck is consistent, Sam could be in the money. Good Luck to all. 👍👍🇨🇦
1340 beat ya. Already seen all this. 😂😂.
Legend did not panic at all that is a race car driver
Purpose built-nowhere close. Junkyard build-perfection 😂😂
It's a truck it wont get stuck.
Holly shit BROTHER! IVE watched since you started racing an that is scariest I've seen you do! I'm glad your safe an sorry Mullet blew the Trans, always next year to DO IT FOR DALE 3 !!!!
Let the Freedom screech. I knew it Ruby as usual being the most reliable with a one and done. Let’s GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Maybe it's time to actually properly check and maintain stuff.
SHE'S A WHEELER! 🍻 Had me shittin my pants for a second lol
now this is content
Sorry about Leroy but it happens, great video.
The camera on the suspension was really cool
How many passes can a 4L80 survive in mullet?😂that’d be a good video
Hell yeah cowboy that’s a good ride 👍🏼👍🏼
You dont need a nhra license to run a 9 unless thats his class
aw Garret I could see the frustration on your face buddy - But I totally agree, at the power levels you are running, add that to the fact you really are going fast, its time to be like the big teams and carry a spare. You will feel a lot more confident having that spare. Nice save on the sand trap!
How much do you think mud flaps would hurt the aero?
Cleetus, you need to put Wheelie bars on the El Camino, so you can hit it hard from the beginning.
You need to make a McFarland off road shirt. Glad you’re ok brother!
Glad you're ok brother!
Well dang
I remember when Mullet was getting prepped to be a jet car, LOL!!
About the 8:10 mark looks like cleet didn't clean up all the carbon dust.
Holy crap what a scare glad your good brother god looking out 💪🏼
TBMs are DownHill MTB brakes lol
have you tried belt dressing on the belt in ruby
So Jackstand drives for this team and drives Dr.Tunemalls camaro? I didn't know you could drive for two teams at once.
Sorry to hear about Mullet, but sure you guys will rock it with Ruby.
When your competition is running funny car slicks and wheelie bars I'm wondering when you are going to do the same and turning the boost all the way up.
Who else thought their fire alarm was going off on the intro
Nothing better than a manually operated ABS system haha
Holy Toledo you fully sent it your done!!!
Don't think I've ever seen Jackstand that happy. It's contagious, lol.
Then brakes were fired up
lately you have been dropping the chutes way after the 1/4 mile, prior you were dropping them as you were crossing?!?
James is spot on here .
At that power level. You should be rebuilding the transmission after X amount of passes and at that power level you should have spares if just about everything.
Why did Cleet switch back to the metal front clip?
Take ol blue
The c6 corvette is a nice looking car
Garrett- " I've never broken a rocker or a pushrod" Steve- "I'll just give you the whole case"😂
We need the blooper of George, the obvious reason for the cut 😂😂 pleeeeease 🙏🏼
Sorry bro 😢
That sucks.... I bet Lutz had a trans.  Ruby for the win though!
Glad you’re okay!!
Mullet AND Steve Morris' Wagon both out! What a bummer...
Sam’s got ruby lookin good, never seen’r cleaner.
The “Truck” part of Mullet came out for a visit!
It seemed like you had an issue back in Bradenton shutting down Mullet, and seemed to have issues on the first run at orlando....
NOOOOOO MULLET
Wow those rear breaks were bright red. Good advertisement for TBM how well they stopped the car in an emergency.
Can we talk about the 6 second hitch that almost killed mullet for a sec. Like what if that hitch came out on the track lol😅
That right, there goes to show that you are the greatest. That's ever came to be that driving. Anything that has Wheels doesn't matter. You're the best and❤
i did threaten ruby on that first run that if she messed up she was going back in the barn. i think it worked. 850 dead on. lets goo ruby!!
Everybody has a "Road Trip from Hell" story! Mine was maybe 40+ years ago. Leaving Atlanta on the way to Bilouxi then to New Orleans. Got there in one piece. Got back to the '76 V8 Monza 2+2 hatchback after the French Quarter and some SOB had slashed my left front tire! I was parked legally on the street and everything! I am SO glad I took the "inflate a spare" out before the trip and had a REAL tire and rim to put on! Those things are only good for 50 miles and Atlanta is a LONG way from there!
You can't take a hint huh!? You are going to keep messing around until Ripper don't have a dad! Fun is fun man but you play with fire 🔥 you WILL get burned! Take it from a guy raised by a single mom because my dad thought stuff like that was just fun, me or my mamma didn't get to see the fun in his risky life! Thank GOD you were ok!
I love that Sam is running a brand new truck for Sick Week! Now THAT’S how you break in a new engine! 😂
Wooo!!!! Good Save ✊🏾
15:13 check out tyes roll cage did not disappoint!
Life at the bleeding edge is made of big highs & low, lows. It is the very reason it's called the bleeding edge by the people living it, and the cutting edge by the people watching.  Could have been a lot worse when Mullet decided to get back to his PU roots. You been going on about them damn Ford trucks & the rowdy boy decided it was time you remembered who makes a real good truck.  Chevy is so good at making trucks, in 1958, they turned a 2 dr sedan in a truck and christened it, "The Way".
I can see a new t-shirt design for Jackstand in the near future...8.500 King.
One hell of a save
JackStand is dialed in for 2024. Good stuff young men. !!!!
New sponsor... adult diapers for racing.
Sad mullet is out. That things a competitors worst nightmare. It will be alright though. How about some more 8.500’s from Ruby!
GEEEZUS those brake were hot to shoot sparks.
The sand trap happens sometimes, actually surprised it took this long, 8.50 with a zero... I'd be so smug if I was Jack Stand. The real question is, can you get the Carhartt Branded hoodie off your merch store? That I would buy... then ruin, like all the others.
RUBY 8.50 WITH A ZERO!!!!!! She's happy to be back
Cleetus can wheel anything good thing he has those tbm brakes
Noooooooo not mullet 🤧😭😭
Safety first boys!!!   Try moving you gas cans away from exhaust before doing 2 step checks.  @ 4:10
It's always the same, finding the weak link and upgrading! Mulet will come back stronger and even better!
Ruby is the queen
That 8.50 hahaha Ruby is back boys!
Bummer about mullet. But Ruby and James are doing great.
Sometimes broken parts keep us from pushing when all the signs are telling us to chill out. Stay blessed Cleetus.
Sucks for Mullet, for sure😢 dang!  But Ruby?!?! DAAAAMN!!! LETS GO!!!!!
Ruby doesn’t want to go back in that shed
Ruby has always been the star of the fleet. The other cars break, or struggle to make a clean pass...  Ruby runs A to B. Every time. The best car in the fleet is not the fastest car in the fleet.
Whooo
Cleetus got the cojones in place and skills to drive these hotrods.
Tough break on Mullet .. glad your ok after sandpit.... but dude, you need to clean your race car out before your runs, screwdriver in cup holder? Crap on seats? We got you to close your visor, now we need you to do your house keeping.
Always test your 2 step, and always take the hitch off lol
Happy for you Cleetus, so glad it didn't end up bad. If i can be honest about something unrelated, i don't thing your "Keeps" commercials are helping lol, you're hairline looks like mine hahaha
NEW category... FRESH OT OF THE DEALER! Less than 50 miles start first track.
saw the aerial footage yester day and was like damn my boy slid her in perfect
Gutted mullets out 😩
Don't hang your head about, mechanical shit breaks when you party that hard, I am surprised you didn't already have q spare for this event, that's the only part I'm in disbelief about.
I like Pete and I know he’s the master tuner but there is nothing like Brett or George riding shotgun on these drag n drives.
Mullet was getting ready to kick some a$$ too! That freakin blows. Ruby is going to get it done!!
That transmission had a good run!
Cleet, It's better to have that spare transmission and not need it. As to need it and not have it....
Nice save brother
Let's go Ruby!
Ruby with that 8.50 said im not going back in that barn
You can see the disappointment on Cleetus's face when giving the news of Mullet going out.
Rip
8.500  Ruby 🏆   WIN or BARN  👕
Them TBM brakes tho 🤘
Frickin love sick week coverage! Between Cleet, 1320, Tom Bailey, and all I know what my afternoons are gonna be after work all week 💪
0:50 we just not talking about the  alex taylor poster with drawings all over it lol
I gotta say.. it is lovely to see Sam getting it done, Have fun brother
I think I’m most impressed with the 13.7 in a bone stock 4wd f150
Lead by example. RockOn
Jackstand 1 and Done. You been missing Ruby. HELL YEAH!
Y’all look forward to these events for so long, and then you’re out on day one. Dang that’s sucks Cleet.
We need a new “one and done” shirt with ruby hitting that 8.50 😂🎉
Ruby to the rescue.
Those brakes took a beat in the last video with all the sparks 😂. Add that and the parashoot failure   ouch
devastating
We all know mullet is a truck. No need to drive it in the kud to prove it.
Nice driving brother. Glad you and mullet are alright!
Doesnt mullet have air launchers for the parachutes
I think u need some new parachute now they done shit there chute on that one.
Truck made for truck'n yeee yeee eagle 🦅 🇺🇸
I was watching the stream and when they said your parachutes didn’t deploy my heart skipped a beat, I’m happy you guys are all good
Starting to believe that Sick Week is Mullets kryptonite. Every year that Mullet has run, it has had mechanical failures. Hopefully, Sick Week 2025 will be better
I believe James is coming after old mullet ! !  ! !
Make some sort of panel that mounts from the hitch to block all of that area off from the chutes so they can't get snagged on anything.
That sucks mullet is out but RUBY ! LETS GOOOOOO !!! 8.50.0  Way to go Jackstand !
Crap... Right on Ruby and ranger and F150 BUT ouch .. at least nothing super major I hope.. Stay Safe.
Cleetus number 2 james number 1 this car can do 5s
👍🏽👍🏽
Hell yeah brother go jack stand and Rudy meant to be
Saw this on 1320 and sh*t my pants when I read their title!!!.
What a bummer! I love seeing mullet making passes and kicking a$$'s  Still excited to see how tye's ranger does!
I’m going to be honest this hurt me
Love mullet and ruby !
Cleetus used his drifting and driving skill to put some side ways aero drag on mullet to keep it from going deep in the beach, bet thats the first time he didnt want to go as deep as he could😂
😢😢😢
I love these shots of the rear suspension and the brakes burnin’!
its so cool to see ruby back in it man ive missed her shes just amazing and sorry about mullet that sucks man once tye gets used to driving the ranger its gonna be nasty
That is to cool you have Sam racing!!
Jackstand don't even blink when its go time !!!
Yep, b4 plowing up the back 40 those rear rotors were glowing and throwing sparks pretty good. Lesson learned: Remove hitch and or ball b4 any full passes are made and chutes are needed!
Heavy D Sparks could always build a 'small' ramp at the end of the track ... It will help you stop faster I'm sure!  Stay safe out there!
Nice driving Cleetus. Who needs parachutes
Ruby!!!!! James was amped!!! Let’s Go! 🤙🏼
What a run, Jackstand! Sucks about Mullet but it's Ruby's time to shine. Let's go, Ty! You got a 10 comin'. Sam, beautiful pass! Lol Cleet you're a driving machine! TBM for the W!
I know you are a phenomenal driver Garrett and have the eye for detail. But you got 2 lil rippers that need ya and a family outside of your home that loves ya, we want you to start being as detail orientated for the chutes and shut down lane procedures as well. This should be the focus of 2024, you got the run portion down pat brother🙏🏼
That sucks dude! Really sad turn of events. But I'm still really looking forward to follow the now Steven Spielberg quality of this production😅👌
Dang bro that really sucks you had to drop out early in the races
😮HOLY SHEEP SHIP.......
Dude what a fucking save!
Verry nice save
Shoulda took the Supra..
Steves wife's malibu is so clean
Love all cleetus's cars, but something about ruby just works.
Ole boy that walked in front of tye's truck on the phone lol.  Yo is this a VW commercial. Cold blooded! Way to go guys Nice runs though!
Ruby said, Hold my Mt Dew.
Phenomenal video except the end! :(
Steve couldn't lend you his transmission for a week?
Watched Rubys perfect first run from PA. The live streams awesome man. Good job Cleet & Crew
Thats nuts how those brakes were GLOWING and STILL managed to lock up, SOLID brake setup 👌 and yea, at those powerlevels everything eventually ends up becoming a consumable lol.
What’s on fire at the end of Orlando speedway?
God bless King George
Damn that sucks that transmission was no good. Dude probably knew it was trashed and thought he could make a quick buck getting it to you guys. The spare transmission is a good idea. After all you guys would have a spare trans + diff when leroy was doing drag and drive. But now you can say that Mullet ran a full pass with a tangled up parachute and still stopped right at the beginning of the sand trap with no damage.
Anyone here know what happened to Toast?
Mullet ends up in the sand but it ends up being the transmission that takes him out of contention. Sad day. No 2.0, no Boostmaster and no Mullet. Now I have to root for Alex to win unlimited iron and Brett to take the overall with that bad 5.0.
Man i love the Ranger Tye
Mullet ain't no pavement baby now😅😂 glad to see that came to a safe stop
Boi them brakes was on fire 🔥 lol But Did Yu See How He Worked The Wheel ? ✊🏾
them rotors be glowing ....thats scary bud im glad you made it thru safely
Make Cleater finish the tour with the electric car!
the behind the camera commentary from George is the best.
Ya know Steve is bummed when he gives up his spares. What a drag man Literally and figuratively  Ty That little ranger could use some caltracs on them leaves
i don't think ive seen james that pumped ever before it was awesome
Take Steve’s trans he don’t need it 😂😂😂
Love how ruby looks with a hood
Good driving and discipline on brakes, your other driving experiences helped keep her alive. RockOn
i love ruby! makes me want my own ruby! jesus!
Garrett’s driving ability is insane!!!
You are such a rock star dude.
Two BIG signs that Mullet wasn’t that guy this drag and drive. Sorry man. But hey! Three other horses in the stable that are ripping!
TBM brakes for the win!
Cleet you better report whoever sold you that transmission and said it was good
FIX MULLETS STEERING WHEEL
Damn that was scary... But luckly Ol' Cleet has been 200+ MPH before with no chutes at all... But yeah... Try not doing that again... Poor Mullet
Brought mullet in for a soft landing. Those plane lessons are paying off.
Bust it off boys
Definition  of "Coming in Hot!!"
might need to get rid of those little bitch brakes and next time might not end up in the sand.
How come you don't need catalytic converters on the streets over there?
All that drama, topped off with wrenching back at the shop, yet still managed to edit and upload a video! Impressive!
Cleetus sounded like Ostacruiser when he hopped out of Mullet 😂
Such a bummer dude I’m sorry, it’s cool you stay optimistic and stay rooting and happy for your guys
Man.. SO bummed about mullet being out already but gah DAMN RUBY!! What a freakin start to the week! Glad you're okay Cleet. Hopefully, you guys can get some testing done on Mullet to get him dialed in now that the 4 link is in him. Keep your head up!
You already know it’s a hell of a pass when cleet puts the time up before the run
AND THIS COUNTRY IS PUSHING ELECTRIC…… I AM ALL SET……….LET IT ROAR…….
James is whoopin ass, first big win with the Camaro now a .50 even. Keep killing it
My man can absolutely drive! Hell ya man! Glad you're ok!
its like they say racing is the only sport that in order to make a million you gotta spend 10 ........ lol
Gotta say, thats skill to stay cool calm and collected with that speed, while also applying stab braking to get ya slowed while still in control. Good stuff Cleetus, Hope Mullet is ok!
That transmission was toast.... should've opened it before taking it
There has to be a point where cleet moves to a better platform for going deep 6s. Mullet is great, but it is a behemoth of mass that is going to be exponentially harder on parts than a lighter rig. Obviously, they all know this, but its time to start getting serious about it if he wants to be competitive (which im sure he does)
Ruby: “We taking this dub jackstand, i ain’t going back in that barn”
God bless you Garret. Man, it's all fun and games until crazy stuff like that happens and that's not to be taken lightly. Thank God you're safe brother
Am I the only one sad about mullet
Ruby is just going to get all the love this week. Cant wait!
Next...
That's motorsport nothing more needs to be said .
Good to see James get that 8.50 right off the rip. And at 19:00 Cleets sphincter probably locked up tight, need Mexican food to unlock it, but seriously he did good in a panic situation, and it is on tape. At over 200 mph in 1320 feet and short run out at Orlando is no Joke, And those TDM rears were worth every penny. Heartbreaking ending.
You boys are having too much, fun ! the world needs more Cletus, and Company!
Ha, that'll learn ya to put a hitch on a race car!
Damn good driving. Knew what to do right away no panicking. Real good thank the Lord on that one
Let’s go outside, get it together and get it done boy do it for Cletus
Tyes truck sounds great !
THEM TPM’s GO HARD!!
Great save!!! I want to get some TBM brakes for my 7,000 lbs truck since y’all just came out with them
What does it feel like having the front end lift up at 100 miles an hour and then I don’t even know I just wanna go for a ride
It's like Ruby does this for a living. Professionally.
I feel gutted
Sam needs a lot more power
226 mph in an El Camino! That might be a first!!!!
Glad that you are okay brother.  Bet the pucker factor on that one was high!
Those brakes were glowing red. Thanks for the under carriage gopro
Ruby is the perfect drag car. Anyone can drive it stright down the track and she just goes!!
Holy crap did you see it lift the front end up halfway down the track I choked on my food
Damn man. Hope buddy didn’t try and sell you that trans as “fresh rebuilt” because if so that was shady
Bro goes “wooo”. Lmao.
❤ Ruby
Great save but going into a sand trap sideways is a great way to flip though….
Bums me out. i know it bums you too. Just focus on the other cars bud. Good Luck
Dang.  This sucks
What a shame that the transmission didn't hold up to the power of Mullet. Let's sèe if Ruby makes good for the Freedom Factory.
Saw the run earlier today when someone uploaded. Glad you're ok.
I hope you break down… 5 minutes later ruby’s down
ABS < CLEETUS’S FOOT 😂
Ty truck looks sideways all the way down the track I do belive his frame is twisted or his suspension bad one
Why didn't you do a back entry and drifted the corner would have been more crazy than the situation 😮
Rube looks soo good.. would love to see a 9inch and th400 in her...
Mannn im so gutted that mullet is out!!!! Drag week redemption mate
I love this channel always looking forward to seeing what's next. Keep up the awesomeness
Mullet runs a six then drives out the sand like a 4wd.. just a truck doing truck things.🤣
Them rear wheels look good mallet.
Damn three heavy hitters out !  But many still in the competition  !  Drag and drive is the best ❤
When you can’t match or better snot rocket in the first day. You gotta find some excuse to bow out.
What ever happened to the original rocket engine that was supposed to be in the back of the Elco
Dam jackstand got gray hair beard in all and that kid not even 35 yet what's happening to you ohh wait I know married life lol I am 39 and I am coloring my hair every 6 months bro
well well well my two favourites are out - now Riding with Alex Taylor  👍👍
You boys need to check your damn fluids!
When did you install orange neon lights in the wheel wells? You can see the orange glow from them reflecting off the brake disk. Pretty neat trick.
Jackstand doesn't get enough credit for being a GREAT driver.
BUENO DIAS!!!!!!!
Shout-out to the guy who sold cleetus a broken transmission and ended his sick week. Scum bag
Those break disks look absolutely goner on mullet.
Ruby is like "I'll show you why I don't deserve the barn"
Ha ha I miss hearing George say that.
That’s no prep kings championship fast
Hey man. Tough break, mullett is my favorite car on the channel, my dad had mullets twin only his was yellow and black and only ran 9.70s, but it is a bit sentimental to me to see a good ol el comino going FAST!  Youll get him back and better than ever, you all always do!  Ready for another giveaway sir!
I'm just glad you're ok brother!
2nd time i don't get to see mullet at gainesville. hope i at least get to see you since i didn't last year when i was in a wheelchair
Looks like he did an A to C run right there.
Dang cleetur maaaad about that tranns. Like come on pal you know the boys are going to pull it apart, why give them a shit trans.
I suggest when you the burnout box do a longer burnout to heat up the tires. It doesn’t seem like the tires are hot enough that’s why you spin them. Check the temp of the tires after the burnout.
I reckon a little bit of poop came out right there......
If mullet had run a better time day one, a transmission would have been found. 😂
Curious if it the fluid was changed before this event?  I'm guessing not... you guys have a lot going on, almost need one person just for maintenance.
I'm sorry about mullet
Need one of Steve's transmissions 😂
Bad luck with Mullet, but you still have a strong team of winners. Go for it and have some fun. Thanks for sharing.
sheeeeeesh love the content!
Cleetus knew exactly what he was doing in that situation
Why did you not take the RAT ROD SUPRA AND RUN ALL THE CLASSES
You pull your chutes way too late. You did the same thing in the first run
Cleetus is a damn driver man, that was very impressive
Oh I'm excited for some George an Garret cam views reactions lol
I hate it for you big guy but good luck with the rest of the cars
Danger Ranger is badass
That’s racing
Steve is a pro, id have told you to feck off 😂  "Whoa!" Np here, all good 👍
Being able to go to a garage with every tool imaginable kinda kills the idea behind a race week.
WOW thats wild how you can see the Brake rotors turn Fire red during your braking and THEN they warp like crazy right before our very eyes! Like.. they were just about molten metal at that point to be able to warp like that, you see them?! POST a pic of those rotors aftermath! Awesome race and glad your ok and seemingly no damage to Mullet besides needing new brakes.. lol!
Tbm brakes iut here saving lifes
Cleetus being sassy about tuning Ruby was funny.
2 things jackstand… 1, you need to turn your can around so ya drink doesn’t spill and 2, put ya visor down on ya helmet mate hahaha good shit boys🇦🇺🇦🇺 ps you lads need to come back to the Summernats here in Canberra👍🏼
THOSE TBM BRAKES PUTTING IN WORK!! 💪🏼
Damn dude! you a you as well! that sux but this video was epic!
You can always go with mcflurry or the f-150 and do the 10.00 class or is it already to late to change cars to mcflurry or leroy and Leroy would be the perfect replacement for mullet so you dont have to hold the camera all week
Maybe jack Steve’s trans 🤷🏻‍♂️😬😀
I hope he doesn’t make a habit of steering sideways into the sand trap…. That’s asking for a roll
I think this is why people love Ruby!
Hey cleetus the next time mullet gives you problems tell it that you will be put in the barn and will be sold lol . Look what ruby did after being confined to the barn. Just some food for thought
Bet ya that run made ya poop  thank god your alright and got the car stopped 🙏
Big F to Mullet's transmission. It couldn't handle the bald eagles for that long... Carry a spare... Hell, carry two!  Ruby tho... Dream pass.
I’ve been waiting since 1053… AM LMFAO
Ruby- “I got this in the bag boys don’t worry”
Brother,you can’t park there 😂😂😂😂😂 glad your ok
My heart dropped when the chutes didnt come out. Im so happy you saved it tho thank god your 1 hell of a wheel man
Those TBMS putting in work. That's not the first time you've flirted with the Orlando sandbox though!
I don't know but before the transmission problems I noticed some smoke come out from under the transmission area on the burnout have a look at this video from 17.20 and watch just at the back of the front wheel smoke 🤔
El Camino went OFF Camino 😮 Good Save!!!
Nose weight
Love the off road 4x4 Who said u can’t off road in the elco.
When will the blazer be back I miss the wheelie machine
Ballpark cost for one of those trans?
Playing in the Cat Litter, Not Ideal! lol
To bad for mullet and cleetus. Did freaking quick run but cant always win them. Hopefully rest of the team will play fullhouse.
i have always been a firm believer in that you can talk shit up and this was a prim example.....when dude said i hope you break down...now we all know he was joking but he talked that shit right into reality.....food for thought.......SICK WEEK 2024 FTW!!!!
I’m excited for Tye’s Ranger. Dude built it on his own (that I know of), and works his a** off at the shop. Would be cool to see him do really well. I don’t think many people here would disagree (Chevy fan or not).
I’m sure alot of people are going to say the brakes weren’t good enough or yada yada, but after seeing the clip from the rear end, those brakes were absolutely working, glowing red hot still had enough bite to lock up, definitely a believer in those brakes now.
Why not build something else mullet is getting boring now
Mullet got out of the sand??  That must have some good posi traction.
woooo :)
Don’t lie dude you weren’t scared that was a crazy ass rush
James is so good on the tree
that smx finally broke in lol dam mullet is a rocketship , that transmission is a trooper lock up aswell and ruby jack stand races in his sleep lol his life is racing good luck and im on the feed
Don't let yourself get distracted when packing those parachutes anymore. Your safety is incredibly important. Nothing happened this time, and we are all glad of that, but don't take the risk, When it comes to safety comma you should focus on it and not take an interview.
Put old spice on Ruby's belt
Great save on the chute malfunctioning
Only 7 cars have ever gone 8.50 with a 0 on Sick Week. That’s awesome. Watched it on Frdmplus so I was pumped for this video. Edit: just made it to the end of the video, terrible news on mullet. Now I’m less pumped.
For mullet to spin as bad as it did for the first run n still run 220s n 7s is fukin insane tht car will prob be able to get low 6s to high 5s it’s definitely needed the suspension done can’t wait to see it fully dialed in its gonna be a rocket
Steve's out. Take his transmission as well
Damn it mullet is out hopefully ruby can get it done
James for sure is pulling the chute now after coming in hot after winning in the Camaro.
Damn! That stinks.  I to the next weak link I guess.
You can just see how tired Cletus is at end. Sad to hear about mullet. The rest of the teams gonna make up for it tho.
So, someone got one over on you?
Poor some Lucas stop slip in that thing lol
Look at the bright side the car is still in one piece you're still alive. And the other car seemed to be doing good. I always say everything happens for a reason.
Still got Ruby.
Glad ur ok cleetus
Great job keeping a positive attitude ❤ as always 😊 sorry about the transmission.
sad day for mullet, but as you said Cleet, we learn and now spare transmission GL for the other cars
Glad you’re ok cleet! The automotive world wouldn’t be the same without you. Stay safe brother
Take those gay honda lights off ruby!
I'm so glad ol clettus is fine. Can't be loosing our clettus
Man I hope somebody comes in with a trans for you even if it makes you guys a bit behind. Or even a day behind. But man with ruby perfect run. Put a speed limiter or something 1mph higher than it hit if that's possible lol
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck…🥺
Definitely time for spares. Nice driving though.
Dang two big hitters already out.
I love that you don’t show other peoples content. I seen a video yesterday showing your crash and I couldn’t watch it.
I know you are a pretty good driver but turning your car side ways like that before the trap is not a smart thing to do. The first thing the car will do is dig in and flip if it has enough momentum. I’m sure it was a reaction thing and a lot of people would do that same thing in a situation like that. Good luck brother I’m rooting for you!
I hope y’all feel bad for leaving poor ruby locked up. She always does what’s needed. So happy to see ruby back in action. WITH A HOOD ON. lmfao keep it up guys!
Ruby said "i'm not going back in that barn!"
Did the guy who sold you the transmission tell you it was fine? I can't see why youd buy another one that was busted too..??
Them tbm’s where holdn on for dear life!
I dont know nothing about drag racing to much only internet knowledge and from what I see I'd say the first thing to cheap if car pulling left or right it make all tire pressure is the same first I guess cheapest and easiest first thing to check i noticed last video i didnt see u guys check that assumption on camera im sure you probably did that tho off camera 👌🏼
His face was so calm when he was going into the sand just a fucking driver!
That's some driving son😂. Tbm's putting in work
Awesome ! Caught some of yesterday moments yesterday and didn’t know what I was witnessing . My first drag race and loved it
Can’t say enough about the commentary and energy George provides on the videos. Keep it coming! Ps. Damn good driving across the board boys!
Dude my heart sank when I saw the footage live, SO glad you're okay Cleet!
I wanna know who gave cleet the hurt trans..slightly used and metal in the oil pan are 2 different descriptions..they did all the work to the rear end just to be knocked out day 1..I'd rather cleet get last place then taken out by this
Bummer Cleeter , I was looking forward to Mullet killin' it this week.
Might want to check the brakes after that one lol
20:26 almost looks like whistlindiesel is driving mulet
Love the content I love the track race you and everything but I would like to see you do some street racing or some gas stations on the streets
Cleeter instantly spinning the tires into a madness wheelie with all the grip in the world was sick!
you cant park there.
Good call Cleeter. Let Mullet live to race another day.
Is the carbon front off to protect it from the street driving?
Thank goodness you’re alright. Did you see the sparks coming from the rear end. Was that the brakes?
Rip to george’s mullet 😢
Boooo! Thats racing...
Wow great driving glad your good!!
Can’t go wrong with a dirty girl 😏🫣
I love all these guys. They are just a bunch of good ol nice guys.!!!
"I got my own laps-top."
Garrett always stands up for his suppliers.  Top notch partner.
Holy hell brother that was scary as hell
Full circle. Back to Camara man on Drag & Drive. Do a tom bailey reenactment. Lol. Let's go Ruby and park ranger coyote.
Thats an easy win for Ruby, cant get any better then that
Hang in there cleet ✊🏼
"Manual ABS" - Cleeter
Who gave you that transmission?🤦🏻‍♂️
Mullet goes off road 🤪
Damn. How does Mullet not have a spare Tran??
Hope y’all get her fixed up and ready for tmr sick week
Where is the carbon front clip for Mullet? What did i miss?
Literally I commented that mullets  transmission was slipping should have read my comment you can hear it in video
You kept the car out of the sand and yourself above the ground. I'd call a win a win. Great work fellas
Jack stand is so good at driving
Ruby waited so patiently and came and killed it
Reminds me of the Geo Tracker days.
What a ducking save 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So first and foremost, I'm glad Garrett is ok...that was scary. I'm glad Mullet didn't get damaged in the off road event. And then I'm glad Mullet doesn't come equipped with seat cushions, or else Cleetus would have had to go to the hospital for an extraction!....lol.
Damn, damn, damn. Good stuff for Ruby though!
Great efforts guys 😊 Go ruby ❤ Feel super bad for mullet 😢 Let's hope little ranger in the F150 do well during the rest of the week 😊
@Cleetus McFarland man that really sucks, But in the racing industry nothing is a given due to how hard we beat on our vehicles and old Cleeter has all the top dog parts. On a good note you didn't crash Mullet up and your safe. There will be more races brother
Thought It Was A Fire In My House
To the guy who sold you the trans. Thanks for screwing the boys over, hope you spill hot  coffee all over yourself.  Cleet I love how calm you are through this whole situation, next year will be better brother!!!
u know hes out when the videos late... lol
Good moves scrubbing speed by sliding it at the end.
Watching Pete with all his tuning knowledge spraying starting fluid in a 100k engine is kinda weird.
love seeing james so fired up! lets go!!!
How do you not have a spare dude it’s a low 6s car 😂😂😂 it’s gonna eat trans 🤷‍♂️ so sad 😢
I don't know if you were just physically spent after that morale probably just was shot when the second trans got put in and you realized it was no good... I was trying to get in touch with you but I had no way to directly get ahold of you I was going to just let you use my lock up 400 since my builds  nowhere near ready but then I saw you said you're out so I figured you didn't want to throw anything else at it...
Cool under fire, Cletus saves Mullet from certain death!
Thats some fire in the distance... too far to be Jacksonville? Im not that good with Florida geography
A little rtv on the wheel before installing the wheel lock will help seal it.  Old dirt track truck lol.
The fake reaction pictures in the thumbnails is so annoying lol
Nic save dude could have caused a lot more damage
You should definitely finish off the journey in the carbon cub!
Does anyone know what happened to Uncle Chet??? Did he quit YouTube??
Damn somone dooped Cleet on that trans. They knew that one was hurt. Asshats.
Why put the drag of the mirrors on before the run ? Or is that the rules , that you cant change anything once you run ?
skrrrrrrr......"Wooooo!!!" - Cleetus, 2024
That’s a bummer. It’s hard to build a transmission that can hold 4500hp reliably for dozens and dozens of runs and be driven on the street for thousands of miles.
That rear end set up Tye put in there is bad ass. Dude could probably work for nascar he's that good. Love the camera angle from the rear end
Mullet the trany eater …😂😂😂     That’s just bad on so many levels.
Parachutes? Don't need those where we're going!
great save at the track and mullet will race again!!!!!!  go Sam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
James killed it!!! 👍🏼👍🏼
The New TBM Brake Commercial.  Cleetus Has the TBMS Locked Up & Goes Perfectly Sideways In the Sand.
That under car view was crazy seeing those brakes glowing going into the pit
That sucks. Hope this week gets better for ya!
Sam rocking a tucked in hoodie is a vibe
It sucks to see that. I was looking forward to this week! But it is the right call. The right call isn't always a fun one.
yep, definitely gonna need new brakes after that one.
Sucks you got sold a bad trans. But now you have a spare, too bad it isn't same gear ratio.
Does anyone know why he changed the front end of mullet back to steel?
ty's two step sounds siiiick
RIP mullett
Make sure sam doesn’t fall asleep behind the wheel he probably doesn’t stay up this late
Ouch. !😮
Impressive runs for everyone, the fact that tranny took as many runs before dying is a testament to M&M
Cleetus showed how good his driving skills are to be able to save Mullet from a catastrophe Congrats on Ruby run too
I assume the gas jug is sitting there to warm up the e?
Bummer about Mullet but I bet riding with Sam will allow you to relax and enjoy the trip
Safe!
Thanks for taking time to meet with me and my son yesterday. We have been watching you and the crew for 3 years. My son will say your intro "hell yeah brother welcome to the Cletus McFarland Youtube channel".  He was unusually shy 😂  Thank you!   Good luck!
Mullet did pretty well in the sand!
George sounds like a man who almost lost his meal ticket lol
Make sure you check your anti-Robar to make sure it’s not bent
Excellent job controlling Mullet to the stop. That could have gone so much worse.
Is that the carbon front clip!?
Ruby took that threat of going back in the barn to heart lol
I heard Cleetus' description on the 1320 video - but SEEING him locking up the tires and skid Mullet sideways into the sand pit is damn impressive! 😲
Shame that Mullet is out but thats racing for you.
Why no milk n cookies ? Where's Mc flurry
Ruby is a champ!! She went a perfect 8.50.0 to say don't put me back in the pole barn. Never give up on her, she hasn't given up on you all yet either. Ruby's ☝💪☝💪☝baby!!😆😂☝💪🖒
Cleet you are UNBELIEVABLY lucky you didnt flip when you hit that sand my boy... any faster and mullet would have been totalled.
cleeter had his DANCIN' shoes on for that one!
absolutely gutted for cleeter and mullet but unfortunately that’s racing. jackstand and ruby are in a great place and it’s so good to see Ty and his truck racing sick week. nice to see Sam enjoying his new truck too! i’m sure mullet will be back and better than ever once you’ve put it back together bud! love your videos, keep them coming!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That makes 2. Apperently Alex Taylor had chute problems too after going low 6s. 6.24 if I recall correctly.
Day 155 of requesting a race with Peg from Zip Ties on the roster
Sucks mullet is out. Hope jackstand and ty kill it for sick week. Sam keep on having fun sir.
How bout them TBM breakes, huh?
Rubis paint has always been so clean
why no carbon front end on mullet
so glad to be hearing the good ole buenos dias from the man himself!!
Glad your ok man. That looked way worse than it was in the beginning. I could hear George's soul leave his body when he realized that the smoke was from running off the end of the track.
God has blessed you with all that equipment needs to say I’m glad you’re safe and your car is good ❤
Dam who sold it gave you other transmission....we need answers
The B2 Bomber crash didn't make the video!! But damn Ruby looking so good .. 🔥
Honestly, I don't understand how you guys get away with the shit you do. Mullet's failure is about due considering how you tend to just send it. We love that about you guys, but your cars might not like it quite as much.
never fix ruby's belt issue. its hilarious
This is not cleetus first time being over 200 and the chutes not coming out. The boy is getting good at stopping with brake power only.
Shame I watched SMX and Steve is broken man in your video or he just woke up. Shame man.
I bet Maddie and rip both shit their pants at the same time
What the hell is burning at the track? Every time I have been to Florida something is burning!
I’m glad you’re alright
Bummer
Jackstand reading slips is like a short action story! So exciting 🤤
That uncontrollable *WHEW" after an unexpected andrenaline spike 😂
Damn, this sucks mullet and Steve Morris both out
The cool thing about these drag and drive events is that you can race as much as you want, no matter where you place. A normal  race day and you can get sent home after first round, after months of prep and money spent.
26:43 i love that ruby is back and dominating as always🎉
I watched a video from a different angle last night that made this seem SOO much worse
Sam headed down there right away
Great freakin drivin dude!🇺🇸
James and Ruby together = perfection
Man I don’t watch anyone else drag race but when I see cleetus post man I love these videos can’t get any better
James where he belongs in Ruby 👌
JJ stole all the good luck to run that 8.50 with a zero. Now he’s got a flat. Mullets chutes don’t open and blew a tranny. I don’t get why you’d use it all up on the first pass? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣🤣
Jackstand Jimmy is the man.
Would going to a lenko transmission be more reliable over an auto?   I don't know when it comes to this ammount of power,just wondering.
TBM brakes stay winning. you actually can not get anything better. sucks you’re out but hey glad your stopped
Everything happens for a reason. Now you get to discover why.
Dang bro them brake GLOWING .. Side note you cant park there
I been waiting since last night for this video... couldn't wait..  got ti see a glimpse of it last night on another channnel...
So what’s the mpg on that thing traveling 😅
This should be an Ad video for TBM Brakes
Was Tye's truck crab walking down the strip or was that just an effect of the camera angle?
All good! Well done to all!!
Bummer for ol mullet. But Glad to have some full time cleeter the camera man like old times though 😂
Thank God our boy is a driver
Dude that wooooo when u stopped was definitely  a relief. Pucker facter was very hi. Love watching tye get to run and have fun. Hes definitely one of the master mind of those bad ass units
19:24 shiii can't help but admire them TBM breaks thoo 🤣💯
I did the calculations in my head if James was a fart of a blonde hair off he coulda lost. I guess there was light at the end of the tunnel, or the beginning. Probably more in the beginning I would say, it’s all about the start line!
Stopped It like a Pro.
Those TBM’s were working hard!
😢
Way to keep the shiny side up, Cleeter!
Mullets first run, span, lifted, got into it, wheelied, lifted, got back into it and STILL ran a 7.15?! If cleet and Pete can get him dialled, he’s gunna run low 6’s for sure
Where is the carbon front end cleet??
It's all because you broke that mirror, bro.
someone should have told Garrett that he cant park there🤣
19:00 I bet cleetus could've sh!t a diamond at that moment 😂 glad it turned out ok!
I think the wheelie to 7.15 is the wildest thing about this video
If Alex Taylor can rebuild a tranny on top of a barrel at a track, you guy can surely rebuild one in the shop!!!
Using one drag radial on the street was very relatable. Gotta do what you gotta do
Wanted to put a jet engine on this
Love seeing the whole team race!
I wonder if one of Steves Rottler transmissions woulda fit in Mullett? Steve wasnt gonna need it this week after his wreck n fire.
At that kind of power levels EVERYTHING is considered “consumables”. Could have been worse, at least she made it back to the shop and didn’t leave you stranded.
Swap to leroyyyyyy
I need a link to that b2 bomber that I seen on the back of mullet.
Wish George was out there with the blazer.sorry to see mullet out😢
I remember my first trip into the sand trap its kinda scary guys . 😅 they grow up so fast 😮.
So every time Pete does the tunes things get too rowdy and everything goes wrong? Is that the trend? Just like last time Pete helped on sick week.
Well now you have a space.  That under car cam of that last run looks like a fan shroud was loose or missing a bolt or something.
Cleet is a fucking DRIVER. What a save
An 8.50 with a zero is insane 😂
Dammit… that really sucks…….
That again proves your skill to drive. Going over 220mph and remaining so calm and not locking the brakes completely, small movements on steering... glad that every one and everything is ok! Keep it up guys!
I know Cleetus is to nice of a person but the dude that sold him that transmission had to know after he drained the fluid that something was up. That’s very annoying. Stupid transmission caused so mud waisted time and content. That being said I feel Cleetus will come back with something up his sleeve
Tys ranger spools soooo good
OH NO BROTHER!
Hey, YouTube, STUFF all yer damned ADs!
Our boy is a driver for sure. After watching that second pass, I had to go change my britches
Do the rules allow removal of the parachute snagging tow hitch for runs? If not, there's gotta be a rethink now and design an anti snag guard to fair in the tow ball and snag proof it for all future drag & drives. Get Ty to fab up the trickest sexiest removable part ever seen on a 225mph tow rig. Then sell them to every  'chute spec rig in the competition. I want 15%
Get hold of RPM and you'll have one in the morning 😂😂. So sad, Mullet is out but everything happens for a reason
Now THAT'S what I call a good advertisement! Proofs in the puddin
Ruby's like 'Don't Park Me Again"
That sucks, but at least you made it home
What an amazing save man!!!! 19:52
Anyone else pause the video thinking there smoke alarm went off lol
Too much freedom
He showed us his "O" face! 🤣😂
Jack Stand is the daddy of daddy's.
Dude! Mullet isn't made for the Baja 1,000.
Garrett I love how we could hear you from the camera Under The Car once you stopped!!!   Thank God brother
hell yea brother good run cleeter!
I'm in England and we are going to Florida this year for our 1st visit. I am definitely going to go to the FF. Apparently it is possible to have a look around I think I heard Cleet say that once? Hope so! 🚗 🚘 😊
Soo glad he didnt get hurt , add a camera drone thingy to your vids .
Looks like Tye is crab walking. Could be the angle it was shot.
It's ok Cleet! You're a hell of a camera dude!
jack stand is on fire baby.
Dude sold Cleetus a smoked trans 🤦🏻‍♂️
Keep your head up Bro, just a Minor setback for a Major Comeback💪
I'd say, don't run with that trailer hitch on again.
Did you see on your second run you were leaving black marks all the way down the entire track
Ruby's like that dream girl that everybody swears can't exist in real life.
NEW NAME UNLOCKED!!!!  "DEAD NUTZ JIMMY"
Crazy doing 2step with that nitro gas can right at the exhaust outlet. One backfire and kaboom just be safe don't want to see you disabled like me. I don't wish this life I live on anyone. You guys make me feel alive again thanks I wish I could race again it's been a few yrs since I ran 13sec in my stock but fast 06 SRT8. had to sell it to try to survive an that only lasted a couple yrs but since I owned it out right off the lot it helped me last a couple yrs more. But broke now and life sucks so watching you guys just brings me back. Thanks
Fun to see Jack stand get that worked up....🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wooo!!!
LOL Roby is scared s&^tless to go back in that shed!!!!!!!  Glad you are OK Cleetus!!!!!
I love mullet but he has his work cut out for him to catch them pesky mustangs
Everyone is watching the cars and I’m setting here like damn there a big fire
Use me as a “fix rubys belt squeal” button
226 mph with a spin and lifting twice and a wheelie 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Pop that pump, slam some new clutches in there and let er rip….take an hr if you’re slow.
ruby da TANK
JSJ and Ruby never left... 👌
Mullets weight must be so hard on everything with that power and speed. Time for the full promod build 😂
That just kinda sucks that you didn’t take the carbon front end changes things but if you get in an accident with any front end I would want it to be the steel
I really love following the drag and drive events, its what got me hooked on this channel in the first place, these guys solving problems on the fly is fun and informative, keep doing it guys, love the dedication and adventure.
LET'S GO RUBY! You are the whole team now.
*HEADPHONE USER WARNING!* 20:25 Golly, that’s definitely gonna affect my hearing
Rookie move by not having a back up transmission.
Ruby is flipping you guys the bird for real now. RUBY!!! That car got me watching your channel. That car is awesome, and I’m not a Corvette fan. I’m a C6 fan now for sure.
L to the guy who gave you that trans 😢
But what about the b2? That sucker almost took me out lmao. Landed 25 feet from us.
The camera angle of the rear end was great! Those brakes did a great job!
19:26 Those TBM brakes always coming in clutch!
It's wild, in the first run, you can see one chute is really lazy on coming out. Wonder if its the same one that dind't come out.
You see his eyes pop wide open too lol like oh shit
It's shocking that three six second cars had parachute failures yesterday. Glad you got it stopped.
Need a shirt , tank and or hat that just say " She's literally Dialed. "
Drag 'n drive events and you got hellaof convoy in there, good luck for rest of the week, too bad for mullet but it is just racing.
When you don't want to like a video but have no other way of showing your appreciation 😢
Spin and then wheelie on the first run??? How in the world
Jack stand is the man . Ruby is dialed he looked so calm in there like it was nothing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
dam at least youre good
glad ur good!
No way you don't have a spare trans LMAO!! WOW! that is too funny year 2 with DNF for Mullet it's starting to be a habit it seems.
Tye's truck has a twitchin Elvis lip!. Watch the headlight on the 2 step ck.
I KNOW THAT TRUCK, I AINT NO STRANGER! I KNOW THAT TRUCK IS A FORD FUCKEN RANGER!
ruby said ill show you why i don't deserve the barn treatment...bam 8.50
i bet converter issue not trans
Sad to hear! Can't win them all bud!😢
Those rotors were hot as f.  Glad all is good brother.
so are you all going to pile into Sam's F150 on the bench?
Garrett you are a class act.
Would be really cool to see cleetus do a light weight big tired car
Mullet: I don't know if I want to sit here and spin tires or go to the moon! 😅 Next upgrade, 3 chutes!
Cleetus I think you should have grabbed Steve's spare transmission, lol...
Red rotor... Fun
I just noticed that Mullet doesn't have her carbon front end on. When did that happen?
im glad u ok bro on yo first run u can see the second parachute took for ever to come out  the second run took longer doe get that check out
I just found this channel but binged all the freedom factory updates but can you do one on where it’s at today I know it’s got to be even better now
Drift skills kicked in at the right time
Congratulations to James for his recent win at Bradenton after all those years .
I had a feeling ruby was about to nail that 8.50 as soon as they told us the time right before. Ruby is back! That was one of ny favourite moments on your channel!
Let's goooo! Jackstand!!!
I didn't know TBM brakes came in lava color.
Sorry to hear that poor mullet
Bro just drifted the drag car to shed speed. Cleet is an animal.
Mullet is so damn powerful😂😂
When you were gettn it out of the sand all i could of think of was.  Rock it barb 🤣
We need a Mulett VS Alex Taylor 55 race. Could be spicy.
Cleet drove the shit out of that thing at the end of the track...
1 and done for the great jackstand Jimmy
Definitely not his first rodeo on chute failure. One of his first 6 second passes was a double chute failure in Tom's camaro almost 3 years ago. Handled it like a champ!
Sucks about Mullet but hope to see him back in action soon 👍🏻
Those tbms glowing orange god damn
He always said we was never any good off road 😅 Awesome save!! LET'S GO!!!!
I’d like to hear Pete’s opinion of the smx since he’s also a badass builder.
That’s a wild ride brother! Bled off that speed like a pro though!
George had no energy for that 10.76 ranger pass lmao
HELL YEAH BROTHER Love this channel.
Man I was so excited to watch Mullet's progression throughout the week but things happen! My Dakota trans just blew and its all stock! Anyway, guess we cheer for Ruby now!
Real talk. I don’t think I have seen a genuine look of disappointment on your face before this video. Seen a lot of other emotions from you man…but this one, you look gutted, and maybe a little like the dude that gave you the trans has one in for him.
What happened to Mullet’s driver side fender 😮
Hell yeah brother 🎉
Good Save Cleeter!
Things just happen sometimes buddy. Shame about Mullet,  he'll be back but good thing is you still have 3 more of the McFarland racing team still in the race.
Could go get McFlurry!!!!
bro glad you're alright, i seen it happen on the live, i was like brother! we only just lost ken a year ago we don't need to be loosing cleeter!
Steve Morris needs to make a transmission that holds up to his engines!
If it ain't squealing belts, it sin't Ruby! 😅
Jackstand has won Ships, got him a boat. He’s been in the sixes, and now he’s bullseye on an 850. That man can drive.
Do it for Dale, next year is gonna be neck and neck at the end with mullet and Steve's wagon.
Got dayum Cleet! Good save!
It's Ruby's season anyways. Don't feel down for Mullet. Let's go.
We love you Cleeter it's okay you have won so much especially as a father. You're a wonderful guy. We always have your back and will always believe in you
Man that sucks for Mullet s sick week.  Ruby is running though.. nice.. btw the "wow' when u stranded in the sand got me 😂..
Bro. Bummer about MULLET! Best of luck for the rest of the crew. Let’s go RUBY and TYE!! Can’t forget about SAM! Let’s go brother!
It’s so crazy how I don’t know you personally and when I saw a vid last night click bait Cletus crashed my heart dropped and my girlfriend jumped up and she just listens in the background glad your good brosef
George's reaction to the 8.500 was the best thing ever
i think everyone seen the sand trap incident way b4 cleeter had a chance to upload his video but ill say i was glad to hear u was ok. its never a good thing to hear someone hit the sand traps so i was glad to hear u was ok after an from the looks of things didnt take u out of the event so good luck an stay safe. also might look into putting mullet on some kinda diet if thats even a possibility an get as much weight out of that thing as possible to help slow the thing down or add a set of back suits or something, we cant have a suit not deploying get you hurt especially as much as u've talked about it being an issue with leroy, mullet cant start having the same issue.
RUBY REALLY DOESNT WANT TO GO BACK IN THAT BARN LOL
TBM FTW. Those bad boys were radioactive by the end of it.
If that wasn't an excellent ad for tbm brakes idk what is. They got red hot and still worked. Thank God you are okay. Must be scary at 220.
Man watching mullet get outta control like that had me nervous, 10/10 with the 8.500 dead good show ruby🤘🤘
Tough break cleeter. But mullet will be back and ready for war shortly
The "WOO!" at the end was the best.
Ruby’s like… “I ain’t going back in no barn”
That was Badass
Jackstands “day one stepping on their necks”  the most gangster thing jackstand has ever said on camera
Them brakes putting in work! Great advertisement
James cutting tree down to knub !  Keep rolling boys let gooooo !
Wtf is glowing after the 19:00 pass? Does it have rear brakes like a monster truck or what?
That ranger he should tie the roll cage into the back of the bed and up to the Frame, that would stiffen it up a lot and hopefully help that twisting. It looks pretty bad when it runs
James Taal- That’s a bad man. What couple days he’s had. 🤙🏻
Nooooooo
Ruby Bald Eagle SCREECH!
Kinda feel if was about the fans, would just Livestream to YouTube. Same community that helped you buy a racetrack.
1320 used you as a thumbnail Cleetus McFarland
Get the Porsche
Ruby got me into this channel and I absolutely love when she crushes it and this was about the most absolute crush you could crush!  Also, good job James, Ruby needs a strong yet gentle guiding hand!
James Taal is an absolute machine! He didn't even blink once during the entire run. Oh and that '79 Mustang Pace Car going by in a couple of the shots is beautiful!
Sucks that Mullet is out... but at least it happend at home :D Could have been worse.. What a sick rip Ruby did.. phenomenal...
Ruby REALLY wanted to get back in the game ! ! !
Code Brown! At least Ruby carries on.  What a opening pass!
woooooooooo brother them brakes are HOT!!!!!!!
I think Ruby took that barn threat personally 😂
Jackstand 🔥 me up..
"Sponsor of the today's is TBM Brakes, and my brown pants" -- The Giraffe 2024
Unlucky cleet
Ty gets that ranger dialed and faster, he will need some better hood pins 😆
Just doing truck stuff
Just a quick little mud bog 😅 no big deal
Go Ruby! Back to the front baby.
Immediately after Cleetus says “I hope you break down” ruby gets a flat lol dang it dude! Glad your safe after that run brother, that had to be scary
Shooooo! Tye's poor ranger almost fell apart when he hit that 2 step.😂
Mullet was BOGGIN DEEP! HELL YEAH BROTHER! Glad you're safe.
Cleetus seen more sand than David Hasselhoff (Baywatch). Ruby is bada$$ as usual she got a driver.
Wow way to go! What a come back for Ruby. Keep up the good work.
Ruubbbyyyyyy! You beautiful crimson lady. Lets gooooo
Where's the carbon front clip
Big fan of the channel, big fan of the cars, but HOW in the world is it legal to have such lights? ( 28:25 ) xD
Turbo Rocky! Super charge Ruby please,  Mullets about topped. Return of Leroy😮. Can't wait ❤
I love Rubys hood boys. She looks so good.
Such a shit deal with the Ute better luck to the three other weapons 🤘🏼 drivem hard boys
Let's just take a second to point out cleetus' driving. Dude is wicked
George's energy is unreal! What a guy to have around the place 👊
At Mullets power level, nothing is truly reliable. There I said it.
At this weight and power level, repeated hard launches, Mullet is just going to abuse anything.
I was really worried when i saw 1320's video title but good that nothing too big happend.
Have they not came up with a system that you put in how fast you want to reach a quarter Mile and the computer adjusts everything  during the pass to get you to that number?  It would take the challenge out of it and wouldn't be as fun but you know someone would use it just to win the prize money
Damnit Mullet......Whyyyyyyy
7 years ago, Cleetus once said to us "maybe mustangs aren't the only cars crashing"
The index racing kinda sucks would be cool to see some class racing with a points system from track to track
Drag racing at it's craziest 😂😂 highs, lows and everything in between! Ruby looking awesome, mullet trying to kill cleet but also going damn fast then eating a trans, Sam and Tye having fun. A total roller coaster of a day. Thanks for bringing us along!
Rick Flair would be so proud of that , " Woooooo !".. Glad ur safe kid
Good news: found a transmission Bad news: not alot of time to get it swapped Badder news: New trans is smoked worse than the one they pulled out....
Heart sank when I saw the post on Facebook with mullet in the sand pit. Glad everything is fine
Ruby is so strong and consistent.... Too bad for mullet...
nice save bro
226mph on a spin/wheelie is a good indicator of the power that transmission is dealing with... Super impressive. Glad you/mullet survived that rocket ship landing Cleeter
That was a beautiful sunset behind the ranger
Make the chutes spring loaded on the deployment drogue and they'll always deploy.
Still can't build anything that works correctly.
Ahh man.. sorry Cleet!
nooooooo mullet  but hell yeah Ruby Ruby Ruby (i swear she's been painted looks so clean, or is that spray wax really that good lol)
I fuckin' love Cleetus!
I love it, all yall can do your fast double 00 passes, but the real mvp is Sam just cruisin having the time of his life. He'd have an arm on the window if they'd allow it I bet. But careful, you can still pull a muscle smiling too much there Sam.
Such a shame to have to pull out so early.  All the best for the other cars.
Dang that sucks Mullets out……too bad you can grab the rat rod Supra and enter a different race with your entry.
Bummer
Good ole Ruby back to her old self again that was awesome making a perfect pass with a perfect time she is just so perfect
Lets go ruby
great job again.
Son of a biscuit
Come on, how good does Tys truck sound!!
Man, my heart sunk seeing Mullet in the dirt. Glad everyone was safe!
Taking that out with Mullet like a boss. Instantly pivoted to focusing on and supporting his team. ❤
James got some grey hair big-time 😂😂
Off roading in an Elky, ain’t nothin more mullet than that 👍
you stayed damn calm in that situation man, nice save
why did the steel front go back on? I missed that....also when a bone stock basic trim F150 runs mid 13's at 101....unreal Sam...
Hey buddy you can’t park there
Kudos to Cleeter..
Steve Morris would give his right leg out when your in need. Heart of gold.
I probably jinx'd you! Wife and I were watching a youtube video about drag car crashes Sunday. I made the comment that I'd never seen Cleetus have an accident really. Then, bam, off the end of the track. Glad everything was ok.
I told you that in the last video ! The other front end is heavier you guys should tune it with the right one !
I'm glad you're okay. It really showed how good them tbm brakes actually are! Stay safe for all racers! Also, good job, jackstand and I hooe tye gets his truck figured out. I just wish George was running. I can tell he is really wanting too! Can't wait for all the content coming up! GOOD LUCK TO THE CREW!
You all didn’t change tran fluid or inspect upon leaving. Race prep!
Glad you’re ok. That was a scary close call.
Ruby’s signature Bad Eagle Schreech upon startup
Why did you have to take the carbon front clip off. Have to have the original quarter panels?
I LOVE 💕 HOW CLEETUS'S CREW IS SOO UPBEAT AND HAPPY 😁. Smiles all around this team, plus, the positivity uplifts the vibes! Sam just beaming with joy, so cool 😎. Plus, the stud mechanic with Ruby doing 8.50, sooo exciting!!! Great job Cleetus & Friends. Anyway, thanks for the video 📸.
Bro that 8500 was wild good shit dude
James is a true hired gun, legit race car DRIVER...and the disappointment in Cleetus face at the end showed it all, he wasn't mad, he was truly sad.
That under-car camera angle showing the front axle and brakes was insane 🔥🔥
Such a good racer and knows when to stop
Damn man that sucks! Atleast your safe from your chute incident.
Tbm brakes for the win
Bummer. Make the best of it brother. Work as a team. Win as a team.👍👍👍😀😀
I’d have ran that trans. If he hasn’t been changing that fluid regular it’s gonna have some stuff in the pan.
That’s a bummer mullet is out already 🤬
Easy Cleet  faster you go the faster you die 😳
Mullet was just getting back to his pickup truck roots 😂
It just hasn't been a good week with the  2 SMX cars 😢
Sad ending for Mullet.  I just want to thank you for not telling us what happened at the start of the video. All the best for the rest of the week. Go Ruby...
F@%&
Make a place on Mullet to have a spare transmission, but it's also a counterweight for the car
Paying my respects to mullet’s transmission 🪦🙏🏼
Poor Mullet.  By statistics Ruby, Tye, and Sam are golden for the week.
Dem glowing discs🔥
I bet the tires have some flat spots
I mean i knew the chutes are important but dang... TBM brakes for the win.
Mr Morris has some transmissions he wont be using this week...😅
Its really nice seeing Ruby back up in the lanes
Ruby is back and rocking it!  A bad transmission in Mullet is a small price, I thought we lost both Cleetus and Mullet for a minute there.  So glad everyone is safe!
FANTASTIC job DRIVING through the lack of a chute deploying. A lot of guys would have panicked and made the situation worse. Lesson for EVERY racer is never stop driving your racecar.
I already know about the B-52 bomber so what you need to do is get yourself and controlling that is like a 900 megahertz or a Express lrs system that works on a 900 megahertz either or one way or the other it's a module that goes in the back of your radio does not have a modules running an old Spectrum radio that you should get rid of but needless to say if you have an expansion Bay get you a 900 MHz system from either from Radio master or from TBS Crossfire either way you can't go wrong TBS Crossfire has been around forever and if you set it up right you can pretty much have Whatever frequency and whatever output you want would that being said do not pick a particular region leave it open and then you can choose the frequency that you want to work with if first time I'd reason you're outside of the United States or if you want to buy chance run 2 watts of power and if you know you know what 2.4 has a lot of interference with Wi-Fi signals which of course in your area currently now with all the Wi-Fi stuff going on because you're Broadcasting
Sucks for Mullet, but way to go Ruby!
George keep that selfie commentary going brother. Solid
Holy shit🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
so glad your okay cleeter and amazing video like always, and we should all make it a tradition to bang revy in the future when cleetus passes away and always say do it for dale and qwenos dias
screw that guy who sold you a bad transmission and didn't say it was bad.
Saw this video yesterday, it was definitely scary when the guy said “only one parachute has opened” I just knew you’d go flying into the rocket luckily it wasn’t as bad as I thought it’d be.
as a swiss guy i really love this raceweeks. looking racing and see your country till you drive to the next racetrack!
TBM brakes and massive skill saved you big time well done bro.
Those TBM brakes putting in some WORKK them thangs were choochinnn
Dude I'm so glad u didn't bomb the gravel or hit a wall. We still got the boys in it. Better luck next time .
What kinda dirtbag sells a basically blown transmission to Cleeter as a replacement??? I'm sure that dirtbag knew it was hurt.
Ruby like I was tired of sitting I wanna go fast
Maybe it’s time to upgrade to the next level
Clean driving to get her stopped. Glad you're ok brother
Ruby with the 8.50 is like "lemme show what these nerds were losing"
Man, that ranger spools fast as shit, doesn’t it? 😂
I guess mullet will have to beat Bratt at FL2K 2024
That sucks
steve is such a nice guy!
i think ruby gonna win her class...................................
Nice clean calm sharp consistent driving JSJ! Rooting for you!
Tough break, but I think we can all agree that "At least you are safe!" hits differently right now.  🦅🏁❤🤍💙
No way mullet is out already that makes me sad 😞
Said it before you need 3 transmissions as a pro racer. One in the car one at the shop and a good spare. 3 “Should” last all season.
I'm constantly impressed with Cletus's situation awareness.  Planned that whole slow down to a T
Nothing new Cleet. finishing the car 5 minutes before a drag week and then stuff happens.. :P "driving to the shop" not sure if that's allowed during sick week. so yeah your out :P
Brudder
The weight is now on ruby but like always she never gonna disappoint us. ❤
Ohhhhhh.....so sad for Mullet😢
I think it's time for a Rossler
This man is cool, calm, collected knows exactly what he’s gonna do to stop that heavy beast going 220 miles an hour.    Pure wheel man.  👍🏼👍🏼       I would’ve had to find a porta-potty after that.
Manual abs for the win
atleast it was with the steel front end and not the carbon one
Sucks mullet is out but Ruby killed it day 1.
Can someone explain something to me. If the goal is to go as close to a time, why not program that into a computer to do it automatically? I mean, if the car is running faster than the time, just have a computer calculate the estimated time. Then you can have it modulate brakes to get you to that time... Seems kinda simple, but I work in IT, not cars...
Wow what a run out of Ruby!!
That does bite.... stay safe brotha
I'll never understand why drag strips make the shut down so short. No excuse in my opinion.
ruby says HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!! i am NOT going  BACK  into the barn again!
Damn, fuel pump in Ruby might be as loud or louder than gonzos Camero
Mullet ain’t a mud car
Jackstand is on 🔥
Glad your ok. Try the parachutes without the rear spoiler/flap on Mullet.
All I got to say brother is thank the lord for those TBM brakes! And thank god your safe! Nothing but love and Blessings from Va
I thought for sure watching Ruby go down the track that it was going to end up an 8.4. Nice work! 👍
This is what you get for leaving Ruby to gather dust for well over 2 years... Ruby for president !!!
Damn saved the car at the end just to park it from transmission issues.
Tye has some heavy foot! and those gear shifts were sublime :D
What a bummer
Brothers going to job town in the background @14:47
Casually countersteering with one hand at 19:00 shows that drift experience isnt a waste of time lol
well, you fond a weak point but you'll be back ruby has her happy spot covered!
Should have Leroy in there anyways no hate just saying.
I know it was said, but TBM brakes for the win. Damn.😮
I feel like that should carry a spare trans for these events 😂
Get Lutz on the channel!! Always been a fan of his even before the shows and all that stuff. Just a good dude and racers racer
Nice work James.
George wants to race. James is getting back into his prime. Garrett was hurt by that transmission. But something is going to come very good of this sick week.
Literally hear cleet from every angle😭💀
Damn that sucks mullets out for the rest of the week.
Man I love these sick week videos!
That's my boy!! I'm glad you're a driver! A normal person would have started spinning the first time she wagged her tail. I HATE Mullet!l wish you would just bite the bullet and get a roller of a light car that's aerodynamic, something else that's different like a carbon Audi body or something... I would have picked a 67 Chevy ll but I'm trying to give you every advantage
Glad that went smoother than it looked yesterday. Hell yea brother!
Man I just watched the 1320 first day of sick week on YouTube and I was looking forward... mullet just upset me but I guess that 4 link adjustment got me too excited as well...but.. EFFING figure it  out... I don't care about Ruby or Tye's home BUILT F150 SMOK'EM...Mullet is our guy!!!!!!!!!
Look at those brakes light up!!
Glad those brakes were glowing
Mullet is a MENACE!
Hold my beer y’all. Let me put Mullet in 4 wheel. 😂
Well on the bright side…..if you’re gonna be on a drag and drive and have a break down, there’s no more perfect place to do it than on your home lift.
I'm broken hearted about mullet but ruby is killing it.
A bone stock work truck running 13's at over 100mph... that is seriously impressive!
Leroy is ready!
Damn suspension extends so far there is a gap between springs and seat.
Hell yeah tbm brakes putting in work!
Wow the brakes did there job.
Glad to see Sam getting some action.
I was watching 1320 and there was conversation about the rules. If I heard correctly, Steve giving the chest of parts was against the rules? I'm not completely sure. There was remarks about competition helping at certain times and tiers that is prohibited. May a person please help me with this?
Only @CleetusMcFarland would get an adrenaline high off of almost crashing… Bro I’d be $h!t!Ng my pants!!!
Why isn’t the carbon front end on Mullet??
Ruby does a perfect 8.50 one and done. You can't meet that.
Sucks about Mullet but pumped for Jackstand, Tye and Sam let’s gooooo boys.
Ruby is running great, Tye and the Ranger are having fun, amd Sam is Chilling. Sucks for Mullet but good driving and save Cleetus hope to see Mullet winning again soon.
Take ole mcflurry
Lmaoo I bought you dinner 😂🤣
One thing is for certain cleet is a driver dang
a first for you if im not wrong  glad youre ok and mullet too
Sam is sparkling . Y’all are amazing people giving him the opportunity to do that and making him included. Fires me up
Is Orlando on fire or something?

Honestly not that bad, those tbm brakes did their job
@21:26 photo of Mullet in the dirt reminded me of Doc Hudson from the movie Cars. Thank God Mullet didnt wreck. He should now be called the Fabulous Mullet 🤣
Thanks finally got my buenasdias if that was for me then that’s how you got your bad luck sorry to say  my luck is bad luck 😮😅
Damn that sucks. Can’t believe y’all don’t have a spare laying around that shop. Well, there is always sick summer!
Ruby doing Ruby stuff.
I love when James and Cletus go back and forth. That’s me and my friends. “Oh yeah you did buy me diner so we’re even” is a relatable quote When busting balls.
Maybe time for bigger brakes
Why didn't we run the new front end?
Way to stay positive, keep it up.
Nooooooooooo😢😢😢😢
James nails 8.50 and Clete goes the extra mile to sell those TBM brakes
This may be the very best Ruby (on the channel) has looked
The sheer joy in Cleets voice at 10:39 is what makes this channel great!!
Ol Jackstand just running on a dial index. Hell yeah, Brother! Good thing ol' Cleeter is an expert drifter.
I hate to see that-but I am really glad your ok!!
Smiling through the whole video with you guys! Man I love this content
Man, I was really looking forward to seeing Mullett in person for the first time on Thursday. That sucks man, sorry! Hopefully you still find the encouragement you need for the rest of the week with the others still going strong.
You fine people saved not only Mullet, but our boy as well.
You sir are a hell of a driver skidded sideways like you was stunting into a parking spot. You da man bro big dawg status.
Atleast you didn’t pull a George and take the full scenic route.
I'd have some questions for who you got that trans from. Just saying
TBM Brakes, worth it.
Not a sub but I do watch  all  of  Garrett  drag  and  drive  and World Cup TX2k videos  every  year  such  a  shame about mullet  probably done   the  right  thing because  Garrett could’ve   put a new transmission  in  but like. he  said  with the power  of  mullet could’ve  blown A new  transmission and   who  knows could’ve  took  the nice  new  rear end with  it  Doesn’t matter  if  you  have a pro  mod  or popping wheelies  in a milk truck  this  is  the unfortunate and brutal  side  of drag  and drive  and I bet   Garrett  is  not the only  one  who hast to call it on day  one
Thank you Cleeter for the always banger coverage. Been watching and supporting since you and Kyle(1320) had the OG matchup at the ice cream cruise. Watched every episode since, so thank you and the crew for the pure entertainment
Pete looks like the really cool Uncle that you always want at the family barbeques...
😂😂😂😂 "wooo"
Should have had the guy pull the pan on that other transmission before you paid him , glad your ok and mullit is a boss 👍 Let's Go!!!
Gotta love those tbm brakes!
Go ahead! Put my ass back in the barn! - Ruby
OUTSTANDING JOB CLEETUS! Wheel man right here got mullet slowed up B4 the sand and only scratches the front splitter! YOU A BAAAAD DUDE!
I bet Alex and Dennis Taylor have some transmission parts for Mullet.
Dude.  That's an incredible ad for TPM brakes.
Lol, once Cleet came to a screeching halt just in the sand, the "Woooo!" said it all, good save brother.
She hooked up good on that sketch run
Be careful out there Cleeter. The speeds you are running, safety checklists have to be paramount. You got a couple of little ones now. Love the content brother, stay safe.
Nooooooooooooooooooooo
Cleet said bubba I didn’t become part owner of TBM to not showcase the product. That was the cleanest landing of a bald eagle into race track sand I even did see.
A+ driver there Cleet !!!!
We will see you tomorrow camera guy.
TBM brakes were COOKIN. glad they did their job and you're safe and sound
I could see how tired and disappointed you were at the end there, cleet. Get some good rest, and enjoy your time with the boys. Don't let not being able to compete bring ya down. Love ya bud.
Thank goodness for those TBM brakes!
what happen to mullets carbon front end? or did it get painted lol
Let’s get a hell yeah brother for some OG cleetus camera man work coming up! Full circle
Never thought I'd actually see that pickup truck offroad.
"This video is sponsored by TBM brakes!"
Yours wasn`t the only shute that didn`t work properly.Another guy ended up in the sand with some front damage.Gotts pack them shutes right.
Time out in the barn for mullet. Ruby needs a girlfriend built for her
Tough breakage mullets mulletsville. Next time.
Only time will tell. The story now has a new beginning and he's gonna be better next event.
That was an amazing job getting that thing stopped
Speaking of The Stig, when the hell are you going to get Ben Collins and Mike Fernie over there? You have to do that. Please
Time to drive the spark for the week
That sucks. I look forward to sick week and mullet  all year
It blows my mind every time I watch one of your videos 😊
Mullet the Off Roader...lol 🦫
I waited cleet to post about the mishap while few other channels had already posted earlier 😂❤❤
Damn you can see how sad he is mullets down.
Sucks you’re out but it’s best to bow out than to destroy something else
Ruby said I ain't going back in that barn!
Them TBM brakes put in WORK. Guess that torture test was put to real world use...
This transmision always was slow and lumpy, and this is not ass good as you think.   About good trans - talk to Larrry Larson
Hell yeah Ruby, that’s a killer pass. Rubys back y’all.
Could we hear Goerge doing a buenos dias in every video ?? Just soooo great  😁😁
What a shitter dude. Feeling sorry for mullet. BUT,,the other guys are doing well 👏...✌️👍🇬🇧
them TBM's doing there job right there 😮
Im really glad to see Sam racing, you should make him your Stig.
Cleetus knows snot rocket got his number and He’s playing for second place in that unlimited class😂😂😂. Love the content keep up the good work
Steve and Pete need to be set on a retainer like an attorney for cleetus.
American Culture staying cool>> Nice /now stop that lo👍👍👍✌️
Is it just me or does it seem that all these other fast car mullet and us go against run slicks and are all faster? Idk I feel like we can do even better , I know we just got the 4 link but I know Mullets got 5’s in him no problem.
Sick week for me is literally being sick, awesome!
Jimmy can drive boy!
Ruby is just trying to show that she belongs in the fleet.
That sucks
I enjoy watching the cruze to the next race track just as much as the races them selves
Hughes Performance builds a TH 400 that's rated to 5000 HP.
Yo..in Steve's trailer..is that AOC with a mustache??
Cleeter HARD on those TBMs!  😮 🔥 ♨️
what was all that smoke off in the distance????
Spin then wheelie, Cleet is just trying to be Don from fast and furious.. He just needs to mix them together now
only day one and sick week has already been absolutely amazing
TBMs get an ATTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAA BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
James👍💪
Chin up Cleet! This is a great opportunity to sit back and reflect on the other vehicles in the fleet.  Maybe even start to consider a next project, big tire light weight build to exceed what Mullet can do.
Cleet is a beast behind the wheel. No panic, perfect reaction. My man!
So glad you’re okay!
Sad to see mullet broken down, but good ol ruby at it again hell yeah brother
Anyone else imagine mullet sucking up Pete’s flannel? 🤣
Lost my shit when mullet went in the sand and Garrett responded with whoooo!!!😅😅😅
Damn good driving cleet, glad you are okay and car is good
Live to drag another day.
That “Whooaaa” was a sign of relief. I bet Cleetus changed his pants after that run 😂😂😂😂
Steve knows when cleetus is around he just brings alot of extra parts just for him, has his own case ready.
Trucks doing truck things 🤷‍♂️
Sucks that mullet is down for the week, took her on one hell of a ride though at the end.
Eight Five OH OOOOOOOOoooooooooohhhhhh....
Since i Heard that Ruby's 2 step,, I knew she was running Perfect,, She Sounds Healthy and Like a Winner Already, Hellyeah Brother. Lets Go Ruby.❤
Sorry to see that Mullet is on the IR list for the rest of Sick Week. Not good news.
Well maybe it didnt go how you wanted, but thats ok, shit happens. We are still gonna stand behind the team and support everyone we have left in this journey! Til next time, Hell Yeah Brother!!
I get next level pumped up for your racing uploads brother! I remember thinking my dad was nuts for liking drag racing. I fucking get it now! When Ruby hit that 8.50 my neighbors probably thought I was fighting someone in my apartment! Awesome team you have behind you too!
Okay Ruby's pass might have been one of the greatest ever lol
Dang all bad for  mullet on the first day hopefully you get it something done after this video but glad you where able to save mullet from worse problem
Goes to show how good of a attitude this guy has, not many people put their car in the sand and are pumped and ready to make another pass 😂
Tough break on Mullet, especially after the cowboy ride. Still got 3 rigs in it. Ruby with the top spot 8.50 with an 0. Tye gettin the ranger dialed in and Sam with a 13.7. Let's Go!!!!!🇺🇸🦅
That boy can driiiiive, saved the shit outta it
Love Steves wifes Malibu....
I'm so glad Ruby is back. My favourite car of the fleet! Also great to see Tye in the action with Ranger. ...and Mullet will rise again. 👍
The infamous ruby bald battle eagle screech should be a noise feared amongst the mortal cars
Seeing James and George hanging out always reminds me of Jay and Silent Bob in front of the Quickie Mart.
Ruby is a legend!!
Ruby showing how its done ...
Why no carbon front end in mullet?
You're in good company... Just look a Steve Morris' problems, you are both finding the limitations of the next part in the breakage tree....☹ It's all part of going faster... 😎 Don't despair, we all love the journey you're  on.👍
That buenos Dias from George gave me chills!
Mullet sounded PISSED on that 2 step check💀
Jackstand is dialled!
Mullet needs a timeout for a bit. And then it needs to win something big.
Ruby saying don’t you dare put me back in that barn
I think with weight... Mullet needs to drop down a class. Be a drag n drive marvel. And you should smx a full purpose built car to compete
Got to get me some of those TBM brakes
I can't believe you guys haven't repainted Ruby ,Sam has done an amazing job she looks great. Oh Cleetus we still miss Leroy  Good luck boys
Every car tuber used cleet as a topic finally able to see the man the myth the legend himself 🎉🎉
Best group of people on all of YouTube fight me lmao jkjk
You drove the wheels of her brother! Nice save!
0:52 I need that cardboard cutout for my truck window😆
I love how Tye built his truck and kept up theme and has his turbo sticking out of the hood.
saw this happen live my heart skipped a beat!
Its literally a sin the blazer isn't there with George haven't seen it in a while
Idk why I got things confused on Tom's channel when he posted about mullet going off track about the way they average the times. Stupid me
The click bait on YouTube right now is EPIC... "Cleetus Wipes out at Sick Week"  "Mullet Destroyed at Sick Week"   "Cleetus Wipes out"
It's sucks that Mullet is out of the race  But that was a nice save
Glad your ok cleet but on the bright side that clip would make a great comercial for tbm brakes!
I hate that 20 mins after he wound up in the sand there were 3 videos of it on my feed. I hate when content gets spoiled like that. It’s like you don’t have an original idea so you slap your name on someone else’s content and there are no repercussions.
James won the other day and was so excited he did a power slide getting off the track. You do a power slide to keep you out of the kitty litter. Just be safe out there boys want to continue to watch you for a long time
Damn, Jimmy and Ruby are great team
Ok I'm only 1:11 in and have to say hats off to Steve Morris. Hey I may not win but I can help this guy win with some spare parts image in case. You're a gentleman and a scholar.
Y’all were DRIVING today 🤘🏻
Gotta get the blazer fixed up for George
You sure that's not GRAVEL on the drain plug magnet?!  😁😊😉
Glad you're okay and Mullett also came out safe. Could've been a lot worse.
Can I get a compilation of Jimmy reading timing slips? Congrats on the 8:50! And great job stopping mullet
That’s why cleetus is a bada when it comes to driving. That manual abs worked wonders slowing the heavy girl down.
Shoutout TBM Brakes for the BIG save! That and Cleet's ability to drive the balls off anything anytime!
Glad you’re ok brother. Definitely could’ve been worse.
Cleetus got him some serious brake control. Nice save!
I can't believe you don't have a spare!
that gave me goosebumps watching you go off the end. stay safe brother!
Mullet doing pickup truck stuff! 😂
That's racing. It's a constant learning curve in pretty much every area of the effort. Lesson learned to carry a spare gearbox, and there it is. Racing is way harder than it looks. Good luck with the rest of the crew- Ruby could not perform any better.
Mullets ready for a Bruno
I felt that "Whoo" at the end of mullet's run in my soul. Scary shit
This is my wife’s car! Jesus Christ Steve lmao
You would think having spare car-specific components is something that should come as standard practice. Lose a brake pad? No worries... you could rig a smaller one and fry it but still make that pass.  Lose a clutch? Well let's just look right around this darn-toot'n town here, Anyone got a clutch I can throw onto my car from like your Honda or something?
I would think when it's cold, you need to burnout a bit more in the box b4hand
I think Ruby has earned a permanent place in the garage. And to think you guys were about to turn your backs on her.
I love how Sam is turning into a content creator himself! You need to give him some budget and more screen time, he is so gold.
Hell yeah brother glad you're safe wicked ride
Dang cleet. Sorry brother. Guess Ruby n Ty n Sam gotta bring home some hardware for the shop
James' good luck from the weekend is carrying on in to Sick Week.. Keep that momentum going! Soooo awesome!
That sucks that guy sold you a crusty trans... but he'll maybe he didn't kno
Could cleet enter another car ?
Damn, bummer. Your ole engine builder Steve Morris has like 3 or 4 transmissions for his wagon.
That's freaking amazing for Sam Clean Em Up in Bone stock F-150 coyote
Ruby said she wasnt going back in that barn 😂😂😂😂
What’s gonna be the chase vehicle the raptor, 911, neighbor, McFlurry, random crown Vic, the spark, bald eagle machine or 316’s r8?  We shall wait to find out!!!! Safe travels guys!!!
Ruby just told you shes not going back in the barn!
Ruby just doing Ruby things!🎉
clletus you're always positive !!no?
That first run, Mullet was telling you he needed more heat in the tires, they spun for a sec, heated up, then, zoom
TBM brakes for the win!😂
Bro I was driving to work yesterday and a fleet of cars and trailers with Sick Week stickers past me, god they sounded so good, I knew this vid would be popping up haha.
I am just glad you are ok Cletus ! !! You get to race another day !!! 🍺😎♥️
Was that a festa in the background at the start of video
What a great start to the race week James , getting a perfect 8.50 Ty doing a high 10 but unfortunately mullet not opening a chute and losing his transmission sucks. I’m sad to see that  Mullet is out but I’m surprised you guys don’t have back ups as far as motors and transmissions and such which is definite must basically knock yourself out for a simple mistake not keeping spares around
Been watching the channel since the start,  since James joined on and I've never seen Mr cool calm that excited 😂 James was PUMPED
Dang, Sam, whatchadoing to Ruby? She‘s looking brand new!
better take that on a small road trip down the road and knock out the rocks and sand that's now trap under the car. don't want that to fall out on the starting line or going down the track. looking good cleetas.
That sucks gotta have a spare
Bro why not just ask steeve to borrow his transmission since he already wrecked the wagon
What happened to the carbon front end on mullet??
Hope you called that dude back who sold you the second trashed transmission and got your money back.
Brother is drag racing not off rodding glad your good
Do u have to run with sidemirrors now? I understand for the streetdriving But on the drag runs they create drag
Ruby wants to be the center of the show sorry mullet Ruby's a bitch sometimes
What a run in Ruby.
Got spooked
The real question is how many microfibers did Sam use on day 1?
Yall had to have added at least 5 years to Mr Sams life and i love every minute of that lol
So, if you pull a perfect track time, do you have to run again?
The ultimate TBM commercial 4 the win😂😂😂😂
Just curious why no carbon front clip for mullet?
Def look at strengthening Tye's hood, it was shaking when the two step was goin
Excellent driving getting that monster stopped, Cleetus
Good to see whole team racing.  Glad you’re OK Cleetus.
Dang, you and morris out. That blows
Glad you're alright, saw it yesterday
Ruby will never let you down
Wow perfect run for ruby. She saying "I'll be good please don't put me in that barn again I'll be good she says"
Bummer dude with Mullet
Good luck, brother. Hope Ruby can get the win.
Keep on pushing guys ..Best regards from France ...happy Cleetus is OK 👌
Jackstand don’t have eyelids when he’s on the tree man
Why would someone sell a trans knowing it's burned up
Ruby is the definition of a screaming eagle with that belt screech
That was a definitely a full blown "Code Brown" moment!
Drag racing and off-roading?!?!? I love it!!! In all seriousness, though, I'm glad you're ok, Cleet.
bruuuh those florida sunsets! 😭
Seems like Ruby needs some ribbed pulleys
I hope you know you choked up a few million people hitting the sand.  DON’T SCARE US LIKE THAT!! We love ya too much brother. 🇺🇸🤘
Sorry for the short exit..
On the money Ruby. To the zeros. RUBY!
What’s funny is crashing in one of these cars at 200mph is a lot safer than 60mph in a regular car 😂
Bummer man, but it's all perspective. Your safe the car didn't go into a wall, it will be back together. Thanks for the great videos.
Its not broken until its spewing oil all of the top end for the next guy though
That sucks but that is racing.
I'm loving the FRDM+ coverage of Sick Week 2024!
Non drag racing people or new people to drag racing. I cannot explain HOW RARE it is to run dead on your dial or index. I did this for 10 years and the closest I got to any of my dial ins was .002  Way to go jackstand and ruby!
Ya done good!
NOOO 😢 mullet is out 😢😢😢
21:30 Manual ABS  That is a good one. I am glad those TBM brakes are so good and were glowing red during the manual ABS stop.
The smell of trans fluid tells you if its burnt every time
Mullet just got shy now cause his old lady Ruby just showed him up on her first pass
Saw the mullet in the dirt label on many other channel videos refused to watch any till your video came out lol Love ya Boys You all Rock Each and Every One of YA!
Time for a rossler
that was dope jackstand!!!
HOLY TOLEDO!! The composure is absolutely heroic and hilarious 😂😂
Dang tough break with Mullet breaking but at least garret gets to go back to his old 1320 days and record the trip for the team. Good luck boys 🤟👍
Honestly loved seeing Ty and Sam behind the wheel, they put in a shit ton of work, would love to see more of that🤘🏼🤘🏼
dont forget to replace those flat spotted slicks (assuming you run rear brakes). and i hope those different diameter tires on Ruby doesnt burn up her diff!
why didn't he run the carbon fiber front end? Because of some rules?
Everyone in the comments was right about bringing ruby back
Tough break
Well, at least you weren't too far from home when you had to throw in the towel.
Notification Squad!🔥🔥🔥
That driver mod always comes in handy.
Dang Cleetus put the  hex on Ruby! You dirty dog!!!
Tye's truck looks just like a Sunday drive going down the track.
Suck a bummer
Really great camera shots from underneath Mullett. Thanks God you are OK Garrett. Everyone of you did awesome on your runs but holy hell, James knows how to get it done!
Cleet mixing in that drifting and drag racing together. Glad you kept it upright and in one piece.
Thank goodness for them TBM brakes
The hood on Ruby looks so good
See. The Elco is a truck.
"I hope you guys break down" 😂
Dont look for another transmission just give up...
This racing event (Sick Week, now in its 3rd season) remains consistent regarding fluke vehicle behavior and frequent blown motors, not called it plagues or cursed, yet..
Where are to carbon fiber fenders?
It's ok dude, the wankers can shut their faces.
Danggggg! That is not what I expected to see.
Dat sux
Mullet is a truck so a little off roading good for him
😭
Unfortunate to get another transmission just for it to be blown also. Hope it came with a warranty😂
Always drive it until the car comes to a stop, made the best out of a bad situation
Man wild ride, glad you are okay, good luck guys
sam is gonna start a trend with tucked in hoodies
Sad to hear about Mullet but damn that was some phenomenal driving to save it.
You're an absolute menace behind the wheel of anything
At this point Mullet choose to be a mud truck
This sure don't look like A/T tires. Bummer that Leeroy is out already
Nooooo mullet ☹️
James looking like an absolute machine on that 8.50 pass
Man that was a sketchy stop. Hitting sand sideways has sent many cars rolling. Glad you stayed on all four wheels.
Dang! Ruby is looking super slick and clean! Nice attention to detail!
Hopefully the guy who sold it to you makes it right. Sold you a "good working transmission" not the truth.
Cheers to Jimmy and Nate for blasting out a win, 4.43...
I was worried about that new trans when I saw the rusty bolt heads when you first showed it. Bad luck guys.
you are so right. those transmissions are reliable, BUT Mullet is at that point power wise where he can hurt even the most of reliable parts. Great transmissions, just time for a spare. (also you are awesome for how you word that, you don't dog on the company or blame the trans. you just say it how it is. Mullet is at that point.).
One hand on the wheel into the sandtrap! My boy can wheel and deal!
Brother, we are gonna need you to retire that Dale racing theme suit. Please.
I would expect you to pitch it sideways and drift around the corner.
Ol cleet definitely had to change the pants after that one
Not even lying, Cleetus has got me hooked on no hoods
Thank God for those brakes!
Rookie
The way tye’s ranger leaves the line tells me it’s gonna be dumb fast later on 🔥 all you guys are great additions to the team lowkey wish you guys brought the blazer too so George could race as well
Tough break, Garrett. At least you set yourself up a good team to run the rest of sic week with! Much love brother, and much love to the team!
Guess you boys arent mad we demanded ruby come back now!
Nothing is reliable at the power level you guys are pushing trough these cars
The Ruby's paint is looking insane. Excelent job Sam!
Cleet is an absolute Wheel MAN!
Tough break for mullet
Thanks for the video
Dang, hate sour endings but on the bright side, the plan to keep a spare around is good one. Cant wait to see how James, Tye, and Sam do!
Quitter; no backup??! Thats Childs play
Well that's not how I wanted sick week to begin with you. Hopefully it will still work out for y'all with the other cars. Good luck guys!
Those TBM Brakes really came in clutch
Ruby just ain’t a race car without Jackstand behind the wheel.
You will have that in these big jobs, better luck next time. The rest of the crew is strong. HELL YEA, BROTHER.
Mullet, being the gentleman that he is, wants to give Ruby her time in the limelight.
you guys need to put those cars on an alignment rack and setup caster to eliminate or reduce right hand pulls.,.
ORV 😂
Should have worn the brown race suit for that one cleeter... Those TBMs were pulling double duty today.
every view  i hear whooooo
Ruby is an absolute gem.
HEY BUD YOUR PROMOTER HERE.  TELL MY GUYS TO FUND HALF IF NOT ALL THE SPARE TRANNY     AND THERES YOUR DINNER..
Thanks for the entertainment....Looking good
👍😎👍
RIP Mullet.
Yikes dude,
Can yall take george off the camera he acts like a lil girl screaming
Why does mullet always sneeze and cough when in the spool up and burnout? It always seems to do it on the right side I think
ty just needs to lower the power, make a legit pass then start givin her the beans after they get a solid base. Spinning and letting off first 80 feet aint gonna get ya nowhere
need to post the guys name who sold you that pos so no one else gets ffffed and he is banned for life from FF
Mcflurry, rat rod supra, f150, all cars you can jump in to finish sick week
Well that sucks.  BTW, seems like the answer for the Ranger is to footbrake it.
Bad things happen for a good reason. Lets get the rest of the team to the finals!! Win as a team!!
Mullet is to the point where you will needs duplicates of almost everything to be competitive.
Now it all makes sense the video is kinda late....had to throw a trans in!
Is that a greta thornberg poster on steves table 😂 at 0:57
Cleet, please do a Brother a solid and tell Steve that having  "Sugar Momma" in giant letters on the front of his WIFES car looks like she's driving his older girlfriends gift to him!!!! Or that his wife is his older, rich, girlfriend that he is only with for the money and I'm sure she would not approve of being called older lol
Time to put a front diff and transfer case in Mullet.
Well. That sucks. Better luck next time! Ruby for the W!
I don't care how high quality the parts are, when your racing a car at that power level your gonna break stuff sometimes. That's just how it is
Mullet is Street&OffRoad Certified,  at that power level nothing is reliable,,  lol
"I hope you guys break down"  Immediately breaks down
The Camino just wanted to see some gravel to bring out its truck side 😬
Jackstand is a top tier driver
Old Mullet said screw racing, I'm going sandcastle building. Glad you're okay Cletus,
Well best lesson learned? The new Brake system works absouktely awesome stopping Mullet that quickly and safe! Cheers to that at least and all safe ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏.
Sorry bout the trans. They didn't want the smoke anyways. Mullet would have put up a fight!
Somebody get Mullet a set of A/Ts lol
Tough luck brother. Dammit.
Go Ruby, Go!
Mullet will be back even stronger. I'm counting on you guys :)
Man I love that under car camera.
Absolutely fucking driver mod. Well done Garret.
lets go ruby!
That big raw
Jeez, those TBM brakes put in some work!!!
Hey Cletus you should seriously consider making a video that follows all the crazy stuff you.
Rock it Barb!
Dam that sucks. I was looking forward to watching mullet kicking ass and taking name. It's all good at least we get to see ruby carry the team. I will not ever cheer for a Ford. Diehard Chevy guy. Period Point Blank The End.  Great save cleet with mullet.!!
George's initial reaction to the 8.50 is one of the reasons I love this channel. You can tell all these guys live for this stuff.
You need to get ya boys some training in trans over haul! That’s all your lacking in your program. Zach could have that thing built in a couple hours if so it need is a freaking up with new clutches and seals. Get him trained!!! He’s a smart kid!
I saw some random persons upload about your run, my heart started to sink until I saw you get out and they announced you were ok.
sucks about Mullet, glad ur okay. but im so happy to see Ruby back!
Cough... Rat rod supra... Cough...
Mullet needed to do some truck stuff.
Mullet brakes looking like NASCAR at Martinsville
flipping ruby said " i aint going back i aint going back"
Transmission oblige ❤
No way mullet out that sucks
Look at those TBMs glow! 🔥
Pete's pretty good at doing stuff. Wrote a song about it wanna hear here it goes
Damn common sense would have told me to have that other transmission rebuilt and ready
Mullet is the greatest marketing campaign for TBM brakes of all time
Ruby-“please don’t put me back in the barn”
Man, that sucks first Steve and now you,not gonna be the same without mullet and the wagon give them hell boys love y’all
Back to your 1320 days i guess this week. Lol jk that sucks that ol girl is out
Well done saving yourself and the car Cleet! Im so glad you are safe!
By pointing the exhausts upwards, will it not help keep the frontend of Mullet down?
Gutted
Should make that photo of mullet in the sand a poster that’s awesome! Glad you’re ok🫡
Why doesn't keeps work for you? I was thinking of getting some but it appears to be a waste of money
Love Sam need to see more of him 😊
Ruby… what a car.
Woooo!
"CODE BROWN, CODE BROWN!!!"
Cleetus we need to have Blackhawk racing.
Congrats on the 8.50.0  love the live feed sorry about mullet great driving  Been there done that Just glad your ok as for Mullet it can be fixed
"With no dash." O.o
hey, Mullet just had to remind yall that a truck has to mudbog everyonce and awhile!
Good brakes would have stopped before the end of the road
I've got to say, I live that cleetus is taking our habit of screenshoting his face for memes and incorporates it into his new thumbnails!
Cleet, you are one hell of a driver!  Whoa.  Well done man. I woulda sharted my knockers man.
All because if one guy. He should have known it was blown
Georgie wants to race so bad, you can see it on his eyes!! Get the blazer back on the asphalt for that Ole boy :)
At 3000HP.... Nothing is fully "reliable" anymore.... Its not a question of if, but when.
The way you got them ladder bars controlled. You are pulling two twelve to eleven At 59 Now you're pulling 2 20 at 6 7 and you lost your the other day at the actual event.  Those ladder bars are making you bounce. Load talow torque high RPM. 212 to 11 keep you under 6 all the time.
That blue MR2 is gorgeous cotdam
Mullet is just my favourite.
George is the perfect hype and camera guy, just wish he could race too. You really screwed him with that Blazer junk
That is the best commercial for your TBM's you could possibly "oops" into. Those puppies were h o t HOT and you got stopped. Congrats to the team for a good day!
Over 200 mph and power slid out n the sand .who does that
Mr Sam living his best life right now!
Could’ve been so much worse. Great driving. Great breaks. Everyone comes home in one piece.
Jackstand is on one 😂😂
You will remember today, as the day you almost caught captain mullet.
MY GURL RUBY!!!!
Back to the wind tunnel to find the bad air holding back those parachutes?!  Perhaps a rear defuser or lowering/extending the chutes would prevent this ever happening again?!  Are the parachutes too small?!  I can’t wait to find out.
Fam cleeet that was some awsome driving brother wooooo
Let's give a round of applause for TBM Brakes in getting mullet stopped when it mattered
Ruby one and done, Mullet one and I'm done! 😥
Ruby man! She does NOT wanna go back in that barn!
I want the cougar cleetus
every hair on my body is still standing up after that ruby pass.
Ruby cracking off a perfect 8.50is solidifying that she does not want to go back to the barn.
perfect safe thougt it was worse. cleet your an absolute ripper keep the good content and your personality
Sucks Mullet's out, but at least you're both in one piece after that off road adventure!
2 step cold..what it looked like on camera.. haha don't try at home. Your supposed to put painters tape over carbon when drilling, so it doesn't crack.. or separate
Best off-road channel on YouTube 😂👌
Ruby said, “hold my beer”
Adam lz made a safari car so clean said hold my beer and made mullet a safari car 😂
You can come to yyyy
Saw this earlier on another channel I had to double take good thing all is alright
Howdy, how much HP/Torque is the Mullet making these days?  Great Vids!
Glad you're ok.Good driving.
Time for a Rosler and  never look back😎 M&Ms are great transmissions, but mullet just makes too much torque with that big block go big or go home👍
Props to the tbm brakes and the driving skill man.
Am I the only one who started the video and tried to figure out why a fire alarm is going off in the house?
That sucks so bad man! On the upside ruby is dominating as always 🤟
Fakkkk
glad you are ok man.
Tough luck for sure, but at least Mullet is in one piece. Enjoy your week.
I'm happy to see ruby back
9:44 George adjusting his glasses to make sure he’s seeing what he thinks he just saw is pure gold
Tough break but Im more than happy to follow along with another legend cameraman. So happy you are ok and glad you're learning lessons with minimal damage
That’s a tough break!  Looking forward to the rest of the crew taking some wins this week.
Ty is if Big Ray from Victory and Diesel D had a baby
I think I would be having a word with the guy, who you got the transmission from!!!
Rip to Mullets transmission. At least the content will be top notch all week. And you can spend time with them fans a little more than normal. Good luck to Ruby and Jackstand for the rest of Sickweek🍀🍀🍀
Mullet needs some paddles
Thank god for them tpm brakes 🙏
Love to hear Ruby's freedom squawk! Glad everyone is safe
The GOOD LORD kept you from barrel rolling!!!!  If you had hit the sand any faster SIDEWAYS......  ALWAYS try to hit the sand straight even if ya have to let off the brakes a bit!!!!
That was a wild ride! Woooooooo!!! 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cleet been hang out with Dave sparks to much😂
Hell yeah brother!!!!
Been absolutely mind blowing  following your channel Cleetus and Co... Much respect gentleman on on 8.5......000000 From Jono in South Africa... I hang for the next shows always👍👍👍👍
This is the reason I been commenting to bring Ruby back. Nobody puts Ruby in the corner! She was ready for some dirty dancing but looked so clean doing it.
hell yeah brother
James on a mission with a big win and then a perfect ET🤘🏼🤘🏼 Bummer to see mullet out like that!! Good luck to Sam and Tye and as always everyone keep it safe
Thanks for grinding out the vid cleet! We are looking forward to the rest of the week even though Mullett had to throw in the towel.
Definitely still a truck.
That's unfortunate man.
It sucks watching this when he already told us what happened on Facebook.
JACK STAND! 🤯 You ARE a driving MACHINE brother!
Jackstands having a good week, class breaker earlier and now 00 flat.. crazy.... can we get a class breaker shirt?
James sticking out his chest !! You Go Jimmy !!  🇺🇸🏁🇺🇸
13.71 out of a bone stock F-150. That's wild. I might be getting old but I remember when that was stock sports car 1/4 mile times. Damn.
That's some good driving jeez glad you are safe
GREAT driving! Zero panic.
KEEP RUBY AS An 8.50 CAR TO BRING NON DRAG RACERS TO DRAG WEEKS!!!!!!  Edit: Or other events like fl2k etc!!
Thr rick flair woooo when you got it stopped balls of steel cleetus glad you stop brother
First day of sick.. people are acting a little slow and quiet. Meanwhile, George and James are having a combo celebration at full decibel! Like, 3 high fives in a row!😂 you kidding me these boys are hyped ❤
Go Ruby!
Those brakes were glowing red hot!
Need Jack Stand Piloting Mullet
Send a copy of rubys slip into all of your sponsors and usually they will send you money. It may have changed in the last 15-20 years since I got out.
Looks like Mullet is ready for tge dunes. 😂
Did ya pack a clean pair of shorts in that trailer
I wonder what the tire diameter difference is on the back of Ruby? Does the rearend make it through the week?
brakes were glowing red at 19:28
Should at least try I have put trans in they looked way worse and they lasted forever
Steve’s wife’s car might be cooler than Maddie’s Porsche 😁
That bites for Mullet dude, but that's racing. Head down for the next one!
😅💨💩
The ages: Is an El Camino a car or a truck? Mullet: YES… lets Party 🎉
Check lockup. Clutches
Im sorry to say this but thise tbm brakes are just to small for going over 200mph
The worst thing to do in times like these is to freak out, staying calm is what will make you a hell of alot more likely to survive. Solid recovery glad youre okay Cleet and the car didn't get trashed!
I think the ranger is awesome.  Can't wait to see how he finishes!
It’s too bad you can’t slip in Leroy
Kinda impressed that ol' stock work truck is just a few clicks off what that Lightning was back in the day. Shout out to Ruby for whoppin' it day one too.
Holy crap ruby is perfect 8:50:00 dead that’s crazy
That rear suspension shot on mullet is sick.
Good thing you pulled the pan! Bummerzilla having do drop out...
James is an ANIMAL
All camera views you can hear the WOO!
You know I used to skydive, okay? And I packed my own primary shoot, basically from the beginning.  But I always had my reserve packed by professional.  And whenever he was in the building, I would have him observe me packing my primary to make sure that I was doing things correctly.  It may be time to add a third parachute to mullet.  Simply so, you can be at a very high probability of at least two deploying.  Maybe the third parachute would be a reserve that is not packed by you, but is packed by someone else, and you only deploy that parachute in the event of something scary.  I also have suggested this before, but I didn't see any kind of reaction on it. You might want to look into sliders.  Sliders delay and slow the opening of parachutes.  I know that sounds counterintuitive, but it would greatly improve the controllability of the car as the parachutes are  I've seen several times it looked very scary because of the way that your pair shoots deploy and the way it jerks around the back of the car. Now, I am not a drag racer, never done that. So I really don't know a lot about that. I do know something about skydiving and sliders when appropriately used really do make a difference in both reducing the impact of Shoot opening, improving controllability and reducing the number of tangles and other malfunctions because of rapid  Also, reduces damage to the parachute itself.  Now, I don't know if sliders are applicable in drag racing, that might be something you want to look into.  There may be a good reason that they're not used. I don't know.
TBM BRAKES FOR THE SAVE..
I guess the TBMs work... you could see how hot they got!
What was up with the picture of Alex in Steve's tool box?? Sharpie?? Lol
Brother, you are one talented man 👍👍👍👍
All time camera guy goes on the resume
Peet dose not like the cam lol
Good job getting g mullet slowed down, bet those brakes were cooking 😮😂
Poor mullet 😔 but can I just day I absolutely love this channel , been following it for years and its the best car channel on YouTube.  Keep making great content we all love it ❤
Crap Good luck with the otter cars 💸💸🇩🇰👍
Truck stuff!!
Mullet should be freshened up after every event at its current power level. The funds are there, the sponsors are there, the man power ect. So Why not… Sucks y’all couldn’t continue the event.
Just came from the cboys podcast. LETS FREAKIN GO BOYS!!!
TBM  brakes baby
that suspension shot was cool AF. you can see the 4 link is pushing down so hard the car comes completely off the spring
Shit happens, stuff breaks.. you did your best.. we’re all with you, brother.. sucks but glad you weren’t hurt in the 4x4 adventure.. but be assured, we’ll be with you on the next one...cheers!
I ignored everyone else's video that they put out before you. hell ya brother !
Ruby don't want to go back to the barn
Those  back brakes were glowing again they might want to change them to be on the safe side
In an ideal world, how much weight would there be on the front tires on a run? Do you ideally want as much on the back tires, and only as much as needed to steer in the front?
Howdy howdy Mullet sounds ROWDY
Damn, I figured you guys would have a spare. Gotta have one now. Miller will kick ass at the next event im sure!
Alright I give George credit now. Love that guy
rotor porn
Nooooooooo😢😢😢😢😢
Ruby hit dead nuts!
Sad seeing mullet getting the shaft from trans problems. Most importantly the off roading did not hurt the car or you. Now we set our sights on ruby...Shiny as never before and still a rock solid car that just delivers exactly what you ask for.  I guess issues start rising when you build a car with 3K horsepower things get completely battered in every single run and still mullet has delivered SO many passes on that engine without blowing it up it is almost mindblowing.
Dude, Jackstand nailed the green light!
Day 31 of asking why George doesn't get to drag race anymore?
Noooooo!!!!!
Gutted that mullets down but at least we get cleetus cam for the rest of the week 😂
Cleetus handled this like a boss! You could see the focus in his eyes. Thats the definition of a dialed driver. Driver mod and TBM saved mullet
*Mullet has already brought home a Metal. In his transmission that is.* I can't believe with a plane you can't fly somewhere to get another transmission, install it and get to the track intime to race.  But I guess not so hard lesson to learn. Safe travels and fun racing guys.
What a save cleet!
Literally thought my fire alarm was going off at the beginning of this video 😂
You can't have an El Camino and not expect it to go off road a lil bit
Man,I am so bummed I'm missing sick week this year. I've gone to Bradenton the last few years and it's such a awesome event to spectate. I hope to make it back next year to cheer everyone on and watch the excitement up close. Awesome video.
Tough break. Dick move by whoever sold you that trans
Heartbreaking 😢
To bad Steve didn’t have a extra tranny since he’s out 😢sucks that both you guys are broke down but glad everyone is ok thanks for sharing
If you warch jackstand and others they are pulling the chute before the 1320 so the chutes hit at 1450 1500ft mark cleet didnt pull till then plus the delay plus 1 shoot yikes maybe got the chute out at 27 3000ft mark that could of been real bad
I don't think that is what Tye built that 4 Link for.
Raptor got replaced by mullet 😂 glad ur okay 👍🏽
😆 love the "whoo!" after he finally stopped. lol Cleetus
Wait hold a sec is Steve from Michigan his wife car has a Mi plate
Cleetus looked pretty tired, frustrated and maybe a little pissed
Awesome driving!  That could have gone way worse, if you had angled harder into the sand that drag racing suspension would have snapped right out from under the car.  🤜🏼
C est pas des connecteurs que la gomme du pneux doit être chaud pour du greap c est vraie parole de scout 😶🤲🇨🇵👉☝️
Welp that ruins my week. Thought Cleet had things like that on deck. One to many RC purchases lol
It’s an off road channel now too!
Mullet belongs in the truck class, he has a bed and can handle minor off-road inconveniences!!!
Much respect and give Steve Morris a hug for me he looked rattled.  I love all you guys!!  I look forward to what's next!!! (Never a Dull Moment!!)
Pfft. What good was a wrecked transmission? Slap it in, run it, and see if you can get another one sent to the next day's track.
Woo-ooo! 😂 What a "R-debut-by!" 🔥 Sorry about Mullet, but 🙏 for remaining  FF cars...safety of all involved in Sick Week.
Ruby looks so good!
Cleet that pic of mullet in the dirt will make a good shirt. Whit what you said doing it in the dirt.
I know it's scary and most people would panic. But you handled it perfectly the side slide into the pit was perfect. If you went straight you would have buried the front end and broke something for sure. Let no one say this man can't drive.
I don’t see what the big deal is….mullet is a truck after all
Damn ❤️ breaker 😢 best of luck for James and the rest of the team let’s go!! Stay safe looking for the winners circle HELL YEAH BROTHER!!
Take your family to the beach. Not your race car !!
Oh man that sucks. Go RUBY...
loving the rear-wheel camera view!  those TBM brakes were working!
Right on my lunch break. Sorry about mullet!
Sucks that mullet is done for sick 2024 but your safe and mullet will run another day hell ya brother
Wheres steve morriss transmission?? Hes not using it this week!!!!😢
First off, Glad you're still good brother. Second, What a frickin save.
No Mullet sucks!
Does this mean that Ruby doesn't have to run for the rest of the week unless someone else gets an 8.50.0?
What a save.. time for the dual brake kit for repeat offense
Nothing like a good buenos dias to get it started!
Glad you and Mullet are okay
Jack stand new name should be badass James 😂💪💪
I commented on yesterdays video that the under the car gopro had to stay and damn I was right that was possibly the sickest angle of that crash you could have gotten
Man that sucks about mullet
Love George's reaction to the 8.500! What a guy!
Damn Mullet out already, so sad to see that :(
Whats the reason for putting mullet's original heavy front end back on? because it has headlights? why not just put the headlights on the carbon front end?
Really miss the chat section, anywhere we can keep up with stats for sickweek?
Great job Jackstand!! Clearly I knew I was going to see ruby do a great run but that still dropped my jaw!
Ruby is so happy to be in sick week, if you look at her... she is smiling :D
Need a “trail rated” mullet shirt
Changed the front clip?
eh...that hurts
Tough break on the trans situation  :(
Glad your ook!! Stay safe out there brother!!
Watched it on another chanel before the release of this  and felt my heart drop when i originally saw the title. I'm happy to see that you're all good Garrett! Keep on gettin er done
Them brakes was hot
Just a pickum up truck doin pickum up thangs 🤘🏾😎
So sorry for you Cleet. but Well done to the others!
gotta lift mullet now and take him to some sand drags lmao
Way to ride it out handled that perfectly with confidence 👌
On Mullet's first run you spun, lifted, did a wheelie, lifted again, AND THEN BROKE YOUR TOP SPEED RECORD. Good lord!
Anyone else see the life saving ORB at 20:53 ???
Steve is out why dont you borrow his trans
So glad tye and Zach got there set up finally!!
Dang Brother Mullets woe wasn't  woe'in WOO‼️🤦‍♂️😂🤣🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Georges reaction to Jackstands 8.50😂😂😂😂
Mullet is a truck lol
I know jackstand can install some new clutches in that transmission.
JackStand is a god damn wheel man, cant be beat!!!!!!!!
Glad to see you call it instead of push it more and break more.  Mullet will be back better and faster.  Now we can see more of the other vehicles.
Wish he would build a rally car
Great save mate
Mullet is half truck, gotta do truck things every once in awhile.
You can have the steak bites off the kids menu 😂
that one puckered my butcurd
It is a truck soooo...
Badass drive'in fellas
the most surprising thing to me is that Sam did a 13.7 in a stock F150
Them brakes though, instant TBM commercial!
TBM brakes baby!!
Time to build a racecar for the street instead of a street car for the race
At least you’ve got the backup now, just have to get them both rebuilt
Aww man  sucks 😢  next yr mullet
2 steppin mullet with 5 gallons of fuel like 2 feet away 😂🤦‍♂️
Good job driving that car into the dirt, good control on the brakes and the slide at the end was great. Good to see y'all are safe, sucks mullet is out :(
The Ruby squeal is back - Let’s Go! 8.50°°
Way to go rudy
LET'S GO RUBY !!!!!!  No more barn !!! Sorry about mullet  😢
Love Sam's truck my dream truck even live the factory slealies
this video is proof you never name cars male names..... ruby out here smashing!
Run it until it doesn't run anymore
Jackstand Jimmy ftw! Dudes reaction times are on point and ruby is dialed in for 8.50's! Let's go!!
Damn Bro you almost saved it at the end!  I seen what you were tryin.  Good drivin brother
Dude you can't give up
I cannot describe how pumped I was after Ruby's first rip on Sick Week. Soo good having old girl out of the barn!
It's because you didn't bring the "HELL YEAH BROTHER" guy with you!
You know it race day when LS George yellin Buenos Dias!
This cost a shit load off money dude.😂😂😂😂😂😂boys and there toys. LETS GO.😂😂😂😂
It’s a truck, it’ll be alright
You should have to follow in the spark as punishment for being the first one out
:-)
If that isn't a true testament to the stopping power of those TBM brakes, than idk what is. To get a 3400lb machine to stop that fast from 226 mph is absolutely insane! And of course, having a highly skilled driver behind the wheel definitely helped! Glad you're ok and Mullet was able to drive away virtually unharmed (Other than that Turbo 400 😅)
George is the best corn bread mafia loll ruby said I'm tired of being in that barn
My jaw dropped seeing Ruby run an 8.500, thats wild lol
7:40  I said this on the 1320 video, but I'm going to say it again because its still blowing my mind...3400 pounds, blows the tires off the line, lifts, gets back in it, pulls a wheelie, lifts again, gets back in it again, still pulls a near 6 second pass at 226mph.  Mullet is absolutely ridiculous!!  Really glad that Cleeter is ok too, we didnt pucker as much as he did, but I was still pretty clenched lol  The rest of the crew nailing it as well, best darn auto channel on YouTube!
Hope that guy didn't try to pass that transmission off as a new one.
Someone enjoying their Sand rail little too much
Can please sponsor Sam with some new rims! 😅
The fact that Cletus says “I hope yall break down” to James and George before leaving and they proceed to have a flat tire before leaving the track🤦‍♂️
GOOD SAVE 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Heck Ya  , Dale would be proud Brother's . Ya Brother's .... me opinion.. lol
Been offroad more then my dad's mall crawler jeep
Glad you and mullet are good but I like how you see the ass end skate around and all you hear is woo from inside the car 😂
Glad that’s all it was you can always replace cars long time fan
😮 oh my little baby Jesus! The shoots didn’t come out and help at all really. TBM brakes for the save brother!
Pete’s channel is legit too. Glad he’s doing stuff.
Solid work brother
U may need brakes n tires after that one
Mullet just having fun on his first run. 😂😂😂. And ruby just letting everyone know she’s back.
Those tbm brakes are seriously amazing.
Standard Florida man pickup truck stuff
Mullet should get some oem style carbon fiber mirrors
mullet is a truck after all, shouldn't be a surprise it can run over dirt😂
Check the breaks they were bright bright red lol
19:02 Only Cleeter would "woot" as he was going into the sand lol. 🔥
Mullet the Swiss army knife of drag and drives goes 6secs,drive to next track and go off-road like a truck 👏👏
Good thing your TBM ABS worked!!!
I have never seen jackstand so jacked up.  He races so many badass cars he is normally so nonchalant about any run
Trucks doing Truck stuff.
Crazy
Last video he forgot to pull his chute... this one his chute forgot to deploy.
Doin truck things 😅
So much for promoting TBM brakes! 🙄 😅
Hell yeah dude a lil more speed and them tires grabbing sideways could of ended things much differently.
Remove that hitch before next pass
The world is just happy cleet is OK And Steve M are OK
James and ruby are the squad you might as well just build ruby for a class and let james make you some money full time
TBM brakes for the win.
I never been close to 200 mph. I can't imagine having no breaks😬
Sucks Mullet out on day 1 but live to fight another day  and get ready for the next races
I woo'd at the exact moment you hear Cleetus do it
6 sec off-road truck
Glad your safe cleet. That must of been a hell of a ride. Stay safe bud.
-  👍 👍 🔧 qoᒋ ǝɔᴉN 👀❤🤍💙
Damn, man, I know you're heartbroken about Mullet eating that transmission at the worst possible time, but Ruby is still one of the OGs holding it down for McFarland Racing.  Also, given the times that people were running in Orlando, I would not be totally surprised if somebody squeaked out a 5-second pass this week.  Probably Lutz.
Est pour que ça casse pas un moteur la basse vous y monter quoi le bloc et les chemise hummmm❤
4:25. IT Doesn't Sound Good AT ALL You ALL Deaf.  ITS FLOODING OUT
Hey bud you have a kid and a second on the way don't you think you should leave the playing in the sand to them!
Woulda been cool to have Steve as mullets Co driver and the cheat code pete as Sam's Co pilot he could tune the fleet and Steve could keep the engine together
Put painters tape on carbon fiber to stop it from splintering and can help stop cracks when drilling.
Extremely happy she just ended up in the sand, could have been waaay worse.
16:58 Cleetus: "Just hope for ANYTHING with a 6.7 or 6.6" 17:52 Universe: "Okay, you got it brother!"
That was the smoothest slide into the sand I've ever seen!
7:40 Popping a wheelie MID TRACK ! Holy shish kebab!
George needs to be fired.
Tough break on the trans. Both of em
Hell yeah brother!!!!! Let’s goooo
Wooo!!! 😂
Wow just wow brother
Can anyone tell that ruby is fucking excited to be back?
WHERE'S ROCKY AT???
That attempt to scrub speed was phenomenal.
Drove the heck!! Outta that thang boy!! 🔥🔥 smooth landing. Great save💯
James is cold as ice, man doesn't blink during his runs. One hell of a driver.
Learning all the time...
Slipn ol mullet like it's the cub lol
Cleetus  you need to add a clothes washer to the drag n drive trailer  . I know how that feels when the chute fails ..
Remember that one time that Jeremy told George that he couldn’t go on race week with cleet, yeah that was the absolute best decision George ever made in his entire life.   Hasn’t hardly  missed a race week since.
As someone who is stuck in "dad mode" after fostering a little boy, I recognize it.  Cleeter was honking his horn for that little kid in the stroller, notice the gentle honk.  I say it every post, but you're killing it as a dad bud!
Love seeing jackstand so fired up haha, love that guy
I love how every camera, including the one under the car, picked up Cleet yellin WOOOOOO!!! Glad you and car are ok brother!!
Damn that’s unfortunate you’re out but holy ur lucky.
well youve shop tested the tmp brakes now youve got a track test done just because ruby was one and done doesn't mean you get to go to the beach they can
Damn ruby looks good.
Just watched the sand trap on 1320 video glad there's no damage and your okay 👍. Gorge is a awesome camera man love his positivity it's contagious
Ruby proved she don't need to be put back in the barn!😂
For one of the days he needs to say hoooooooggggg riiiidddddeeeeerrrrrr!!!!!!
I love when James and George get hyped! It’s the best
Coming next Mullet on Traxx in Heavy D's snowed in vlog
Well, that sux. But as Garrett said, at that kind of power level, they can go at any moment. Just going to have to up the spares level.
Watching jackstands luck turn around from wrecking Lt Dan to winning street nationals and now getting a perfect 8.50+0 in ruby made the video. Lfg
The day mullet became a real truck
Ruby Ruby Ruby and Jackstand  Jimmy .
I’m so glad you’re okay and mullet is okay.
I'm just confused how you guys don't have a spare transmission... Pretty inexcusable, honestly. Y'all aren't some Podunk race team. This is embarrassing.
FRDM+ has been amazing so far. Keep it up
Mullet Train
How ironic is it that I came from 1320s video a little earlier today lol
If that door was real carbonfibre, please protect yourself :) Been chopping up carbon bike frames, and it some nasty stuff.  Love the car anyway, looks so GOOD!. And happy it ended well :)
Mullet wanted to use the truck side instead of the car side for once
Mullet Identifies as a Mullet Train now
We can't lose Cleetus!  He is a national treasure! Be careful!
5:29 the exhaust flow is so fast it creates a low pressure that opened the passenger door
Well I was gonna watch the video but now I can’t hear anything after the lack of a headphones warning 😅
In all your excitement George I can’t help but wonders Where is the Blazer?
Good driving brother
Noooooooooo mullet. Dang it.
Great video.  As a long time track 1/4 mile racer, I got just 1 thing to say to ya. How do you guys keep getting away with having clothes and papers ect. In the passengers seat ? When I was traveling the country in my BB Vega that run a consistent 9.3 the track wouldn't let you run with stuff that can fly around inside the car. Tracks must be less caring about that because I see it all the time now a days..   NO hate just an observation.
Cleetus you can run a 6.0 at 250mph but all means nothing if you can't stop the old girl. Thank God you're OK
Good driving Cleet.  Them slidin skills coming in clutch
ruby 2024
When I saw you go off on the live i had turba tom flashbacks glad your ok man
Spun, wheelies, in the sand, f'd up transmussion. Maybe Mullet is just getting it all out of the way the first day!😊
Carbon fiber is harder on drill bits than concrete
George looked swagged out AF with those glasses and beanie 😂
Ruby with the one and done! Then cleeter pulling an ls George venturing out into the corn. . .
Those offroad tires would of help you like 1320 video showed. Mullet with mud tires would be next sick week.
Go James. Carry that momentum boy.  From a big win to perfect.   James might be the GOAT at McFarland racing.   So Cleetus has some work to do.   Lol
STEVE IS AN ABSOLUTE GEM LOVE HIM!!!
Pete's tuning the B2
Loved the suspension angle of the slide. Ohhhhh and yeah, James Taal is a Badass
Flick Your Mullet!!!! ...
Damn, George can’t talk til he fires up a Buenos Dias. Talk about a cold start 2 step check.
8.50 in the 8.50 class on the first hit!? Damn.....good omen.
Perfect ad for TBM brakes in the making
Another workout for the tbm brakes, with in the same week! This is getting sketch brother
good thing mullet had a little truck in her for off-roading
I want to say this because I like everybody to be safe. You know, you have that gas container next to the exhaust. While you are too stepping please don't do that again
13.71 is what muscle cars ran when I was in highschool, is that really what stock work trucks with a 5.0 run these days??? WOW LOL 😂😂
I really wish George demonstrated more enthusiasm :P
TBM Brakes baby! 💪🏾
Now THAT is a TBM Brake commercial if I’ve ever seen one!
Cleetus big balls
I got recommended a random channel showing the off just after it happened. I was stressed as a mfer. But glad to see it was minimal damage and cleets safe
Should put some die electric grease on Ruby's belt. Just a little might take the squeal away. Works for me all the time.
You are a DRIVER brother 💪🏼
thank god for the sand traps  this could have hurt .both human and mechine.
🙏🏽 think I speak for everyone when I say you gave us a scare there bud you are one of the good one's cleet glad you're ok.
You need to take the hitch off
Mullet was upset cuz you didnt hold his E85 beer brother also letting you know at the same time brother im a rally car to. Letts go.
I blame 1320 for the bright lights and the distraction then 🏖️ trip. Stay safe.
Mullet out there doing truck things.
What a monster Mullet is. Holy crap😮
9:33... George's delayed reaction has me dying! 🤣
I've never been interested in cars but this channel is changing that, this is awesome stuff.
So glad your okay man
Buenos diaz.. i could definitely go without!!🤷‍♂️
Not being a Karen but get screw driver outa the cup holder if something went wrong and that thing start flipping that could be bad
Sam out there bracket racing put that man in a big money bracket race 😂
Ooo cleeter has been hanging out with Adam lz here lately lol
Ruby FIRES ME UP!
wow...check out the brakes glowing red...
Hell Yeah RUBY!!
someone else posted mullets accident  but i hit do not recommend their channel rather watch yours
ok on Ruby and Tye if they know if they can go faster how come they are in a 8.50 and a 10.50 class?
Is George not racing anymore?
Jackstand came in sideways , fired up cause he won, and now you come in sideways , brakes on fire.....
Glad you and Mullet are good. Holy hell fire me up Jack stand Jimmy 🤘
ok george, you have been out of racing way to long now, time for you to get back into the saddle again!!
19:30 where it’s at
Shout out to Steve Morris always taking care of cleeter with the excellent customer service
That ranger sounds like a damm nascar
You know what’s funny, my Miata is also named Ruby and she also screams like that on startup
Ruby and James be like "we're back, bitches"
Those brakes were GLOWING😂
You Landed Mullet. Safe and Sound. Good Day
Ruby has had enough of the barn! She does NOT want to go back in there
I know Garrett is obsessed with no hoods, but Ruby looks SO good with a hood
Glad you have Pete  there  i like his tuning  he is a great bloke
Are you gunna fly the B2 over the track as they are playing the anthem to start off the races?
The lad is filming in 60p now!
Badass keep it up
Put Ruby on nitromethane after sick week
The woohoo after cleet almost ran out of track was great! What a positive guy!
Man it’s good to see ruby out again
Happy that you are safe man!! Time for a 3rd parachute as a reserve 😂
Tye's ranger looks like it is dog legging to the right rear
A truck doing truck things
Ruby is SO fired up to be back on the track 🔥
Why change the skirts from carbon back to the old one? Rules?
Cleet. Yeah ive never broken valve terrain  Steve. Yeah go ahead and take this whole box
The amount of channels using you and mullet for clickbait is irritating af. Any channel that has been using your channel as there video titles has been getting unsubbed
Zach need a drag car to have full crew on drag and drive
I saw this wipe-out being talked about on another guy's video, and I had to resist watching the spoiler.
It’s that mirror that you broke in the previous video!
Those brakes are a testament of good stoppage.
Glad you let us poor people watch some of the action
Did we not see an spark burst last video under the car when you had the suspension video was worried from then because you said parachute then but then you still have brake issues and shute again glad your ok
freakin TBM Brakes for the win those bad boys were red hot
Tyes Ranger is bad fucking ass!
Bout time cleeter been waiting on sick week videos
i just got flashbacks from baily saying chute chute chute
Mullet is a truck so it's all good.
Jackstands got that winning touch right now.
they took off the carbon fiber front end off mullet
Be sure to put some glue in those holes so it doesn't spider the fiber
Ruby has sat long enough. Jackstand is a heck of a driver and shes happy when hes in the cockpit.
Pete might not show many emotions, but he loves commanding that Billet BIg Block SMX with the twins 98s
Those tbms were glowing and definitely did their job
James is a Badass
Jack stand 2024🙌🙌🙌🙌
old George is looking healthy these days congrats
With glory, there’s some pain along the way to achieving it. Glad you and Mullet will be able to race another day.
Should hit the brakes lmao
You know George got excited about Ruby's run when he turned the camera around and talked to it, he doesn't do that to often!.
if you didnt have the new rear end you might not be here anymore brother so glad everyone safe keep the bag eagles on the track
James cracks me up “steppin on their neck boys”
Need us a cleet&pete meet lol
Yesss with the Buenos Dias got me fired up lol 😂
Just the right timing.... We need a SML in Ruby shell be one of the fastest car in the fleet the way she leaves amazing  He'll yea brother
Was just about to ask where mullets carbon front went till I remembered this is a drag and drive and you need lights and signals .
I bet them brown marks in your draws would be needing a looking at too after that stop damn mullet was moving
I Frickin love George, coming and working for Cleet is the best thing he ever could have done!
Ruby carry!!!
Not many people drive out those traps in the end. ELCO TEUCK putting in work
Mullet is definitely my favorite vehicle
What a ride brother them tbm brakes working triple time to slow you down enough glad you and mullet are okay
Plz fix the HOOD ALREADY 😂
Congrats on the prefect pass Jackstand 🤘
It wouldn't be a video without the drama! 😮😅
Soo glad you're ok man!! I can't even imagine how scary that must have been!!
Those rotors put in some WORK in the last two videos
God damn what a rig Ruby is. Looks so fucking good with the hood on and Tyes turbo kit. What a unit
I seen this yesterday on a new channel that had five subscribers with one video of you crashing for 30 seconds and it has 500,000 views
Yeee Yeee
It’s a shame about the replacement trans
Ruby said…”what barn!” Great job Jackstand!
Little mud no problem for mullet 😂
That intro
BUENOS DIAS!🇺🇸🇺🇸
Why do I feel like Ruby is Gonna win the 8:50 class first year back
I mean Mullet is technically a truck right?😂😂😂
Mullets carbon front end why isn’t it on the car jc
Must be the truck part if the elco showing through.😂 Glad it and you are goid to go.
You have been spending to much time with heavy d
That Squeal in Ruby when she starts is just her bald eagles waking up
Sam is going to have some wiping and polishing to do.
I seen that on fredom+ it scared me I thought you was toast
How about dialing in the car a little earlier than a few days out...
Been waiting for this one
🔥go mullet and team, Hawking ford ranger bud 🔥👊🔥⚙️🔨🏍
Can't wait till Sam is piloting a rocket.
You'll have that on them big jobs
Crazy bro!
Glad to see everything is OK after day one but there ain't nothing like a good two step in the morning
MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM
Ruby straight up flex'n and reminding us that she helped build this awesome channel and she demands respect! 8.500 Lets GO!
Sketchy Mullet, almost lost a full second on the launch in first pass… so sad that Mullet is out, she eats trannies for breakfast. Ruby the dominator, let’s go!!!!
Mullet is now ready for some dunes.
I dont think party in the back should be taken litterally.
Builds character. Glad your okay hope the rest of your week goes better.
Mullet looks like a toy driving through grass
Mullet is still trucking
I wish I could see the race
Silly mullet thinks it’s a truck
Could see George saying "What in the world?"
Just got home from the gym, planted on the toilet. Open YouTube and couldn’t have asked for better timing. 31:48 mins on my porcelain throne
Saw the run on Tom’s channel but camera was too far away to see what really happened glad you got this uploaded, been like this 😬 ever since
Sucks your out! Go Ruby!
Before I even watch the video ( I been waiting since last night) I want to say Im glad you are ok and congrats on ruby running a 8.500
Drilling into Carbon Fiber with no gloves on? Brother you’re crazyyy lol
No -Prep gravel/sand ....new class ..?
4:10 almost popped open the gas cover on the truck. XD
That dude with the Porsche 928 with the SMX 572 and a 8-90 blower with the shark fin ontop is a killer, cant wait to see what he gets outta that thing
Someone snuck in that and button
We all been wait for this video
Great driving brother!
Georgie wants to race so bad, you can see it on his eyes!! Get the blazer back on the asphalt for that Ole boy :)
What was scarier? This run, or the 6-second run in Tom Bailey's car when the chutes didn't come out at all?
Love watching the content Cleet  keep em coming from Kent in England 👍🏻
The coverage has been really good and without the Drone.. well we were all freaking out! We miss the chat, but I know it’ll be back soon
I like Turtles 🐢
Mullet is doing truck things I see
The guy in Florida on a nitro power 3-wheeler wrecked  at the end of the strip into a swamp with a alligator 😂
Cleetus is a wheel man.
Iv been waiting  since last night for this video was so glad you were ok !
What happened to mullets fender?
Hell yeah brother what a rip
My heart dropped when I saw the title to that video that was posted yesterday.
What happened to the one piece front end? Headlights needed for tech?
Mullet thinks he’s a jeep
Good luck go get em!
Sir this is a Wendys!
I've seen other Tubers posting about the Mullet incident, but I haven't watched them because I wanted it direct from the source!
Glam you’re ok Cleeter.
Dang son, that was sketchy!  Glad you got it stopped!
now thats  the GEORGE that i know!
You can't park there.
Sam and Pete bird watching
Sick week and Rocky Mountain race week are my 2 favorite events yall put on/go to. You get racing 5 straight days, you get a small roadtrip and all the hectic things that come with that such as breakdowns and yall goofing off. I remember when yall where throwing water at eachother on the damn highway 😂😂😂
Man, imagine if he had the carbon fiber front clip on. Mullet would be held together with zip ties right now.. It's a blessing in disguise that you never put headlights in it so it can't be used on drag n drives. I swear this event is cursed lol
You definitely sent it
Well I enjoyed sick week day one me and my husband went to see Cletus he was busy and really nice but I must say la George to my amazement was not very nice totally blew us off and he was not doing anything either oh well we still enjoy the channel and I’m glad you and mullet are ok
Yeah !! new sport off road drag race series with first up cleetus 😜
Steve is the man
The fact 😅 that another channel posted your off roading first sums up to me the video cleetur
Glad you're okay, Brother!
McFarland Farming 🚜 🌾 New episode. Good u are all ok 🇸🇪
Now you know how your engines feels when the boost controller stops controlling the boost and sends it all in there. Rest in peace shorts.
well.... the brakes didnt have any oil pressure
Unfortunately I am all too familiar with parachute failure. Glad you got out alright and those brakes held up. Definitely a scary feeling. Man seeing those brakes glow red is crazy.
Glad ur ok brother
Glad you're safe, these cars are insanely dangerous at the end of the day
A 6 Second Car that is also good for the Sand....  get some paddles on that Boy Mullet!
Cant park that there mate...
Glad you’re OK brother!!
Notification gang!!!!
At first when I seen the drone shot, I thought you had clipped the edge of that yellow wall and I was like, "I know my man Cleet is alright but THERE GOES SICK WEEK" dang, Mullet a certified offroad build now! 😅
Mullet mud boggin’.
Wheeling that rig cleet 😂
Waiting to see your side of the run, 1320 didn’t get into the details. Also RIP to the B2
I watched the one parachute run live and was scared as hell for you cleet glad your ok
Aye he brought back the buenos Dias!!!!
All go but no whoa. that was a close one cleet.

Perfect time for my lunch break
1st.. hell yea brotha !!
Cleetus; your an inspiration my bestfriend passed away suddenly and his whole shop goal was to build a car for your burnout event it would mean the world if you can shoutout gonzi he meant alot to the cali race scene! he would purchase all your merch and went to pri to meet you guys!
Glad everyone is okay and the effort is incredible in this team!
I was worried for you brother! Glad to hear you're okay.
Close call, glad you and mullet are alright!
Glimpsed the news and said I’m not going any further until you upload!
FIRE SAM!
Lets go cleatus
I'm glad you are all good
Fastest I've ever clicked a cleetus video lol
First baby!!!!! Cleet we’re glad your ok! When I saw the first clip of this that was posted, my heart stopped and my living room was silent. I’m glad you got it stopped! We love ya bud! Gotta keep you around for a long long time 😉 Sorry your out of the game for Sick Week man! Ole Mullet just said nope not this time. Maybe you’ll have just as much fun rooting for your boys tho and letting them bring home some wins for the team!
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY BRUTHER!!!
Next truck suggestion Nissan titan 👀 has a 5.6 V8 there pretty quick for stock
Mullet: now a certified off-road vehicle
Giving mullet the ol’ off-road hellcat try!
Hades affirmative male siblings!
Get that mullet under control brother.
Hell yeah brother! Straight to George's winners circle!
Glad everyone walked from that including mullet
That run was gnarly, glad you were safe in the end. And Jackstand absolutely nailed that run
