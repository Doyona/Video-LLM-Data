Bye bye Hopkins
Patriots need to really draft

WAY TO GO PATRIOTS
Referees never lose only dumb asssss watch pro sports
At about 10:37, Mac Jones rolls out of the pocket and and eventually tosses a precision pass on the run to Kendrick Bourne along the sideline. The sideline ref rules it's a catch. At that moment, Joe Buck's first remark is that he isn't sure that Bourne was inbound when he made the catch. Wow! If it was Patrick Mahomes, he'd of called it a spectacular pass and catch. Thankfully, the next play, MJ throws a beauty of a pass to Hunter Henry and for all purposes seals NE's win.
There is no luckier team in the league than NE, every team they play either flat out sucks or has their key players hurt. When that doesn't happen they lose.  Garbage team that has a horseshoe up their ass and a fan base that thinks their coach is the reason they won super bowls
Cards need a D line.
We're not that far off from being back to SB contenders; just need some repairs on offense.
This Patriots team is finally figuring it out.
Marcus Jones is going to be the steal of this draft. He is already the best punt/kick returner in the NFL and is also a decent CB. He can also get some good yards out of the slot position like he did the last two game, they just need to pass to him more
Kari Lake has sued the Patriots and the NFL. Demands Cardinals be declared the winner.
Colt has no protection
We got some good receivers hope Bourne keeps getting targeted
Can we still make the playoffs? #patriots
Damn shame
Thank you
Finally Pierre Strong Jr was able to play and he got his first touchdown. Hope he gets more playing time cause he's really really good and can become one of the greatest Running Back of All-Time.
If I was a cardinals fan, I’d want a refund on that guy. What a horrible purchase.
Love my Pats!
No one talking about the best play of the game, where Agholor frantically tries to get the play to stop because of Parker's suspected head injury
Patriots are in third place
STOP THE THUMBNAIL SPOILERS!!!!!!! Many of us are watching your vids because we don't have time to watch the whole game. If you show the losing team scoring in some percentage of the thumbnails, that completely solves the problem.
My boy Tyquan Thornton missed dat edge could've had a 1💯
This rookie class is special excited for the future
I remeber watching Nick folk on the jets and always admired how he floats his kicks, feels like there in the air forever! He’s the man! Glad we scooped him up, solid vet. But watching Nick folk at Gillette when we had gostkowski, think we went two home games bs jets, won one and lost one but these athletes are amazing to see live and up close, you literally can’t even beat watching the jumbo screen as they play it’s so sick and the immediate slow mo replays of the play, even if it was a stupid no gain run or big plays, but watching gronk live in his prime was something else
still think we would be better off with Bailey zappe
The Patriots always run the same defense. It’s a 4-3 with 2 shallow safeties. Lots of blitzes with the backers, but they telegraph when they’re coming and when they’re using joker. That’s why they’ll always struggle with a good TE and running QB. Chip and slowdown Joudon and you have all day to carve them up
Pats defense carried
2 terrible teams
Patriots fans should just thank Arizona for this game.
🏈🏈🏈
Mr Fell off the Kliff Kingsbury got outoffensed by Fatty Matty who spammed lots of screens and has no right to be calling any plays on offense defense or anything
Judon and uche could be best pass rushing duo for the next 3 years!! Pats need to go out and get weapons for the offense immediately!
This video somehow left out Kyler Murray’s injury, which was a major factor in the outcome. If he was healthy enough to stay in the game, the Patriots’ defense would have faced far greater challenges
Patriots + [Insert running back here] = Instant (Temp) Success
🧳
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved
Can we just keep throwing in more commercials? thats what i came here to see
it's frustrating to watch Mac
First game i ever went to and my boys won! God bless! Hopefully i can go to more
Is no one going to mention the Davonte injury where he was clearly concussed and the NFL spotters did nothing? And Aghalor had to force the refs to stop the game? What happened to player safety? Why hasn't the NFL issued a statement about their failure? No one seems upset about this, and I find it weird.
Forgot jj watt existed
Kyle Murray career was short n got paid generational money. Good wrk bro
Is this even football ???  I see people fight each other
P.a.t.s pats pats pats
Judon and Uche ! Thats the comment
Glad we won the game but we are not playing like a playoff team- hoping we do, but I do not see us going past the wild card even If we make It to the wild card. Offense not In sync
wow 1080p highlights... hey NHL.... you could learn something here
Should have put Bailey in, he would have scored fitty bones.
Feel bad for Arizona the stadium sounds like they're playing in Foxborough. It's criminal.
Let’s Go!
They were saying during the game Patriots didn't look like a playoff team ? Patriots won!
Not seen in this video: the 900 injuries by both teams including Kyler Murray on the third play, the GODAWFUL sports casting, they. would. not. shut. up. You could hear them rambling on and on and on and on about literal nonsense. And the BIAS... they were acting like the game was over BEFORE halftime! The game was 13/10 and they were acting like it was garbage time.......
Anybody know what Kingsbury is staring at the entire game on that play card? He stares at that thing the entire game, who does that? You're not hiding your face, (lip readers) what are you doing?!
What rhymes with "Terrible Results", with awesome players? Hmmm, I think it's Kingsbury, Keim and Bidwill. Example of player personnel poor QB selection: Kyle Murray.  Mr. Irrelevant? Hows he doing?
eggball
good win for the Pats but ...tackling is lacking...quit trying to bring guys down by draping yout body on people and HIT a mofr!!!
At least McCoy didn't fake an injury. That's a positive.
Baker to az this off-season. And lulz at kingsbury
The Patriots defense forced and recovered two fumbles by the Cardinals offense leading to a second half shutout. A superb effort. 27-13 Patriots!!!
The biggest event from this game was the Cardinals losing their QB for the season. And yet there's nothing about that in this video. Some highlight video, NFL. So lame.
we always draft rhe best corner back pats nation baby
that catch by hopkins was crazy even doe it was incomplete
The past few drafts have been solid. If the patriots keep it up they can get back on track.
Ok can we finally move Bourne up on the depth chart, when he gets the ball, good things happen
As a Pats fan, the fact we have a playoff seed and are competing to stay on top of it is an indictment of how bad the AFC is. Defense is really good but Vance Joseph is right, a defensive guy is running the offense.
Nice to see the Patriots beat the Cardinals.
why do they spoil who wins with the thumb nail
3rd down and out Mac is nothing to write home about.
Hollywood Brown?  How did his mother come to call him such as awful name?  The Blacks I know are Christian believers and name their children after persons in the Holy Bible.
This looked more like a "Patriots D-Line montage" rather than game highlights.
Who day
You yeah you I hope you know that your awesome,kind,and will always will be.And you be you,don’t ever ever give up.
Why was Dak Prescott making passes for the Cardinals?
Colt didn't do to bad. Glad to see him starting again.
NFL MY LIFESTYLE 🎉
Repent to Jesus Christ “Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭126‬:‭5‬ ‭NIV‬‬ J
Boring sports
Packages used as bait. What an idea !
Bryan g groff frdiens reedy wo love ladeis frdiens yes
Marcus the best Jones
Kingsbury is done 😂😂😂 Im so happy
The defense won that game. Mac jones needs to go
Are we just gonna ignore the fact Marcus Jones is playing Offense, Defense and Special teams, all at a very high level?  Dude is a BEAST.
Great come back pats
Am I crazy or is Joe Buck a lot more tolerable as a broadcaster now
Stupid cardinals
No Damien Harris, Stevenson or Jacobi Meyers and these guys stepped up their game. A lot has to do with opening up the offensive calls and let Mac Jones take shots down field. Arizona might now be the best defense but they still caught the ball and made big plays. At least they fight to the very end no matter where they wind up come playoffs hopefully they can squeeze in as a wildcard when all is said and done. But Mac Jones has to be able to throw the ball they can't win only running it. This is a while new era a whole new team starting from scratch. They were only a few bad breaks from having more wins to their record
Damn colt
Sad to see Kyler Murray go down with that scary non-contact injury Hope he and DeVante Parker recover especially Parker since they might make the playoffs.
“Sheeesh” These ARZ defensive players are Elite in Hitting Hella Hard but overall good game Patriots
I am so glad that my pats won go pats
Is that colt McCoy?
Let’s go!
Everything Aikman says is NEGATIVE...

Tvai was the x factor in this game. Tip on 4th and shorts and another tip for the interception.
Solid Win. Fire Matt Patricia.

Good hit my boi.. Idk if anyone caught Marcus Jones ask the other player if he was ok after that hard hit because they aslo bumped heads. Respect for Marcus Jones for that u wanna play the game and have fun but u don't wanna end someone else's career.
Is Hopkins hurt? or just checked out for the season. Always has taken plays off, but when he's not getting thrown to 20 times a game he seems to just not care. That fumble was careless and broke a tie game. Then a drive or 2 later the dude runs straight out of bounds with his head down - he could've easily had another 5 yards or so without being touched and still stopped the clock.
0099089kkh0ok
The next few games will be interesting for NE they have Raiders, Bengals it'll be interesting
This was the most boring football game I have ever seen. It was like watching pop warner football. At least then you can watch your kid play.
Judon is definitely the DPOY no matter what anyone tries to say
Stop losing the lead Arizona!!
These highlights didn't show the biggest play of the game; the one where Kyler Murray scrambled to his right and then ripped his ACL apart.  After that, Colt McCoy played pretty well, but he wasn't the one to make spectacular, game breaking plays. In the end the Patriots defense got to him.  Also, I wish my Patriots had a WR as dynamic as DHop, but that was unforgivably loose ball security on the play where he made the Fumble Six and cost the Cards the ball game. In today's football every tackler is taught to swing at the ball to get it loose. On this play, the ball wasn't even hit. But he was holding the ball one handed and swinging around in traffic.  Abysmal ball security, especially in a tight game, tied at the time.
Luke was a GENTILE.
Arrogance.
I hope ESPN goes broke so they cannot buy the rights for next years Monday night football!
Beat LV Raiders
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Pats are still garbage

в:вцуефуждклклклклклкьвьв в яФф юзащкщкщкщкщщквяrreeeeere eeeee es eeederr
AZ summers are SUPER HOT, but their team is RARELY SUPER HOT.
Pats offense is horrible
Listening to the crowd, you'd think this game was in Foxborough
Personally I hate Matt Patricia as on offensive coordinator. This was the first game we finally started throwing the ball down the field and it didn't begin until late in the 3rd quarter. If we want to be successful we are going to have to keep throwing the ball down the field and not these two yard check downs.
At 7-6 with four more games the Pats need to beat the Dolphins and at least other team to have a chance at the playoffs. That loss to the Vikings is looming large.
Cardinals look like hell, lousy team.
When them patriots get rolling there so hard to beat. Complete team always.
Pat's are going nowhere.
endrick Bourne was a crucial contributor for the first time this year. His stats were 5 catches for only 47 yds , but 1 was a terrific diving grab coming back to the ball on 3rd down, keeping alive a TD drive that put the Pats  ahead 27-13 in the 4th quarter. He also threw a few key blocks, including freeing up Kevin Harris on his 14 yard end zone dash.
What is the story on this Pierre Strong ?  Guy has some speed and moves.
No off coord
That was a weird P.I call the fact that hollywood nd the ball was out of bounds without force that flag shouldn't of been thrown
Pats are awful  without brady and gronk
Pats defense  is awful
Not a good game at all for anyone
That fumble and intercept cost them the game...
Just think what the Pats could accomplish with a good quarterback!
Guy is literally running 30 yrds down the sideline threatening to score and Joe Buck is just continuing to tell his bull crap story as if nothing of note is happening. I also hate how he says "and the ball is out" as Mac throws it. Usually ball is out means someone fumbled.
Did my guy just flip back up at 4:53?
as a patriots fan we still should of drated fields  he has that it factor
Poor Kyler Murray!!!
Unless it's just because I live on the East coast, I don't hear anyone talking about Isaiah Simmons. That guy has been a playmaker since coming to the league. Doesn't get crazy sack or int numbers but always around the ball for a recovery, pass block, tackle or big play.
W.
Sad about kyler. Man Mac is the real deal though
How does Myles Bryant still have a job
I gotta say as a pats fan, Mac is not good.
That's the only way the Patriots where going to win with Murray out!
Thank you to the patriots defense for scoring 19 points and winning my fantasy match up for me
I can’t help but wonder how good the Pats would be IF WE HAD A LEGITIMATE OFFENSE AND AN ACTUAL OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR INSTEAD OF A DC PRETENDING TO BE AN OC!!
Hopkins: Damn right! I'm the best, just need one hand to carry the ball!   New England: thanks for the easy pick 6 Hopkins!
12:52 this is exactly the reason I like Mac Jones. He’s been rough around the edges this season but I’m loving all of the videos of him getting fired up and yelling. He’s passionate and he’s a leader. He’s there for his team and doesn’t sit back after the play.  He’ll always run up and help the running backs push through or the wide receivers. Once that ball flies Mac Jones follows it and I love that
That’s a shame.  Any state that actively collects child support from a man that was only 13 on behalf of a 20 year at the time deserves to lose everything.  Justice for Nick Olivas is what I’m saying.
Way to go Patriots!!! Hopefully they win the remaining games and the teams we need to lose hopefully loses so they can make the playoffs.
U carry it like a loaf of beard. And they will mack it right out. when u think ur a rock star this will happen. All that money they spent. 4 this !!!! Joke of the hole NFL IN HISTORY 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahaha! https://youtu.be/SFnwdaY_aDk
Just saw one of those Patrick Mahomes car insurance commercials.  I am so sick of them.
Should been 34-14 time ran out
Go pats
Congratulations bb you are good at drafting rbs
1st Down Hollywood Brown😂😂🤣
Can’t blame mccoy for this one he put them in position a few times and his receivers let him down
https://youtu.be/5dODNZiAV9M
That Conner TD run featured a horrible effort by Dugger.  He didn't even try to tackle him.
Only takeaway from this game...why didn't the Patriots throw more screen passes?
this video could be cut into 5 minutes. Some of these highlights are unmeaningful
Fire kliff
Thanks McCoy for keeping the football😄
You know the Cardinals could do good if they could actually catch a ball
Dat thumbnail
Is it just me or does it seem like McCoy is playing in slow mo? He has an insane amount of time to throw the ball and is very calm and acts like he's taking an afternoon walk with his girl at the park, rather than playing football. Either the O line is just that good, or NEs defense is garbage. (this was halfway through, have to edit this by saying, never mind, after all those sacks, McCoy is just literally in slow mo, lol)
as a pats fan the win is good but offense gotta show up not 1 player with over 500 receiving yds
marcus jones is amazing   it would be nice if we had a decent weapon for mac aside from rhamandre
NFL video editor spoils the outcome, as they do every time by showing a picture of a member of the winni g team on the I tro picture. ESe stop doing this!
Anytime announcers talk about one handed catches and say Odell started the trend, it makes me wonder why these old men have only watch football for the past 10 years.
Reports have come out that The GOAT and New England would be willing to talk about a return ! That would be awesome. And I hope Tom brings The Gronk with him. At least there Tom would have a better chance at ring #8 because NE actually has NWFL ( national Woke football league )  caliber coaching. Come Home Tommy !!! ♥
Love how they omitted Kyler’s injury.

just checking
The missed 4 and inches and 3 point kick at the end of the second quarter, the difference.
Prayers up for Kyler. Knee injuries are definitely never fun, but hopefully this won’t derail his career too significantly. A few months out and let’s hope he’s back better than ever.
Rooks stepped up this week. Good and NEEDED win for the Pats!
Um grande jogo para comedores d corda d violao
Pats always have like 4 good running backs.
“It’s mind numbing as to how the Jets lost to the Pat’s? Jets have the better WR core, better defense etc.” like Boomer Esiason said this morning on Wfan & he’s right! We lost because of Zach Wilson was still the starting QB, that’s how!
May have missed the season changing play in the beginning there...robot.
Anyone remember after the draft when people were saying this was the worst draft class ever?  That didn't age well at all.
Hi|!
*FYI for Cardinal fans* DHop sucks. When Murray was the starter the entire team suffered because Murray constantly went out of his way to get the ball to DHop. DHop is not Devante Adams or Justin Jefferson, he’s a liability, and Murray was still only throwing to DHop. I hope it’s obvious to the Cards that DHop is garbage now, and Murray was an idiot for constantly throwing to him.
And mac Jones is the guy niner fans wanted? 😂💀
Great game Pats!!
im just watching for judon to get those sacks.  makes defense fun to watch
Shout out to Nelson Algahlor for recognizing Davante Parker wasn’t well enough to continue playing and stoping the play so he could get looked at
Just goes to show that they really need Larry Fitzgerald to come back strong!
Much needed win for the Patriots.
Why would the NFL start this after Kyler's injury? Obviously it's not a "highlight" per se, but it was quite an impact in this game. Not to mention the other 5 or 6 injuries that happened.   Hide much?
D-hop definitely got roasted for that fumble. That’s why you don’t try to carry the ball with your hand
Cardinals just had to lose to the Patriots. That means the Patriots are in the Playoff Picture, with a 7-6 record, above my Chargers (for now). You had one job and I was rooting for you.
Arizona Cardinals should seek out Coach Payton at all cost
Sean Payton should # 1 priority Christmas wish list
Pats offensive line sucks!
Cards have too much talent to look that bad... new coach is needed for next year.
Seriously, NFL? You START the highlights with Colt McCoy at QB? So what happened to Kyler Murray? The loss of Murray is a HUGE factor for Arizona, but some clown at the NFL came up with some stupid policy of not showing what happened if the most important player on the team has to leave the game?  Why not also cut out footage of every FG and Touchdown? I mean, we can read about those in the box score, right? Just show random clips of players running around. You people are pathetic.
So, the most important play of the game, the third one, is not included in this? How freaking stupid. That one play alone had more impact on the game then anything. Wouldn't call it a highlight but having the first play being a Colt McCoy pass leaves everyone going WTF?
hey what's the easiest way to lose a game? turnovers yep!!
Patriots have so many weapons on offense but it’s the play calling & pass protection that’s handicapped us the most!
Go Patriots!!!
defense saved are ass last night
Typical Hollywood brown dropping the ball
With how many good players the Cardinals have you'd think they would be so much better.
Mac desperately needs a #1 receiver
If a Quarter Billion Dollar Quarterback gets a team a 4-5 win season , NO THANKS.....The pretzel logic of the Cardinals continues ... Arizona deserves a WINNER... Can Keim , Kingsbury , Murray , scrap the whole lot and START OVER !!!!! A Sixty year fan that has seen this TOOO many times before !
Mac Jones with better protection and better weapons next year is going to be awesome. If they get Josh Mcdaniels back at O.C. then watch out AFC East division
You would think with the receiving core and running backs the cardinals have they'd be better than they are lol.
Colt to the colts
how nice of the patriots defense to get mac jones and matt patricia a W
Fire Matt Patricia.
Y colt still has a job on any roster baffles me
McCoin plays for New England ?
I call you all non-muslims in this chat to accept Islam, I call you all non-muslims to admit and accept that  لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ‎  this encompasses two concepts: 1.There is no deity but Allah. 2.Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is his messenger. ALLAH s.w says in quran chapter 3 verse 85  وَمَنْ يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْ خَاسِرِينَ  translation ; if anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to ALLAH), never will it be accepted of him; and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost. Also in chapter 3 Imran in verse 19 ALLAH swt said  “Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.” Look for koran translated in to English or to language read the translation of the following chapters 3,4,5 and 19 after that you can read the whole of the koran thanks.
Ucher eat the ball.
f*ck the paycheaters
Patriots won't go far with Mac Jones. I expect Brady to rejoin next year, just wait and see.
I hate being a Cardinals fan sometimes
Hopkins was drafted before OBJ💀
Best 4th quarter by the patriots in over a year. Finally finished a game.
Great win for the Patriots.
Matt Patricia shouldn't be the offense coordinator, he is doing a mess of a job..
Anybody catch the synchronized sack roll at 5:59? 👀
The U.S. has the best football!  Even watching the lame-asss Cardinals get soundly beaten by reliably boring Patriots was WAY better than a few minutes of the World Cup!   Definitely don't "need" beer for this sport.
Cardinals did that to themself.
Yo Arizona Cardinals dont look that good this season only 4 wins... SMFH that's crazy.
Sad to see the Cards sink so low, they’re done for the season.  Really hope they trade or release their tiny scrambler-Murray and work to get a new QB
Seems like AZ played hard the first half, then acted like they didn't care about the game in the second half.......   🤔
I'm not going to lie we did okay our offense needs a little bit more work but I defense did good we seven and six  we got a lot more games to go GG  let's go patriots  let's get these wins we got a  playoff spot
Jones is terrible
Pats found a gem in Marcus Jones.  Talk about a swiss army knife.
4:10 what a catch by d hop if only that counted!  9:58 Marcus jones threw his whole body into that hit than stood up like nothing!
🏉👍
I miss Judon on the Ravens. dude just can get to the QB so effortlessly
Colt has a history of playin for some sorry,,,and I do mean, sorry ass teams. Its amazing he still gets up & goes to work for them.
Fue horrible vi plumitas rojas por todas partes....
The Patriots Defense have the most take away points (85) in the N.F.L.!!
Nice try at a flop at 11:41
Comes to show someone like kyler Murray is important cuz he can get out of the pocket and use his wheels
Negroes! Negroes everywhere!   One thing I love about the Patriots is all the White men on the field.
Yikes. What a boring matchup. The broadcasters tried their best.
12:49 Listen, this move was amazing. I think I heard the guy say OMG!
The Pats are 7-6 and close the season with Cincinnati, Miami and Buffalo.  They are not getting into the playoffs.
Naw D hop catch out the endzone at 4:10 is nasty 🤢 man was falling with3 dudes closing and just grips it with one hand 👀lucky he was out of bounds
DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS ! LETS GO PATS !
Why didn't you show the most major play of the game? It doesn't even look that bad when he hurt himself. TF NFL. FAKE NEWS HIDING MAJOR EVENTS. TF.
...Mccoy... your 1st highlight should of been Murray's injury 🤦🏾‍♂️
Who buys a car without test driving it first? Signing Kliff Kingsbury to a long contract deal was a HUGE mistake. Same thing with their general manager Steve Keim. Wasted money. I won't even go there with Kyler and his ridiculous contract signing because he's hurt and I wish him well. But let's start at the top and get rid of these lemon cars that wouldn't stay in my garage! Remember to test drive first! Happy holidays y'all.
I would like to see Strong used more especially play action passes.
nice script
Feel bad for murray. 💇💆🙋
9:56
Defense played outstanding that second half. We’re still in the hunt! Lets go Pats!
10:34 didnt think he was gonna catch it
that fumble at 9:23 was the end for the cardinals and the pick at 10:13
Patricia needs to use the play action more to the slots
I remember just last year at mid season the Cardinals were the best team in NFC and midget was MVP,  so they said. Then their playoff run, and it came crashing down and here we are.
Did the Pats gain their identity on offense in the second half?
Well at least kyler got the money . Get well yo
Kliff Kingsbury used to look youthful and spry. 6:28 This is the face of a man having a stressful season 😂
Troy Aikman sure doesn't like the Patriots...ya think ?
Colt McCoy still plays in the NFL? I’m legit impressed at his resilience. Especially after watching that sack-marathon.
Cardinals are officially the worst team in the league.  Congrats.  Oh and learn to tackle btw
Damn Jones was really everywhere
Cam Newton to the Cardinals!
Marcus Jones is a Deebo Samuel that nobody knows about who plays defense and special teans too
Marcus Jones at 1:03 is so funny
Need to see more of Kevin Harris. Dudes legit
Now that is the Patriot Way to play the game.  Both sides of the game producing points and effects.
What a come back!
PatsStrong!
Bro if they don’t sit Nelson algordroptheballeverygame
Great game plan new England keep doing that for the rest of the season and we will get back to the super bowl without Brady
My boys looking so good.
8:58 tie gm, 4th dwn, you'll be on you opponents 15yd line, just f***ing catch the ball at all costs- well, Hollywood has gotta be dramatic, 'jump', drop, never recover momentum, loooose.
I mean there 7-6 they could possible finess and win the rest or end the szn 10-7 and make the 7th seed, that would be nice as a patriots fan. But idc cus my ravens are 9-4, RAVENS FLOCK
Matt Patricia needs to go. Every play call was behind the line of scrimmage. He expects every WR to get YAC when they start 5 yards behind that line. What a waste of e energy. I would rather have some teenage kid call plays using a Madden 22 video game playbook. Total clown show. Not a single passing TD or attempt when in the red zone.
Cards have always been awful. Murray, Kingsbury?
Prayers go up for Kyler Murray 💯🙏
I'm so old that I remember when Jake from State Farm was a white dude in khakis.
Injury is gonna give Kyler an excuse for this terrible season. Mans is not the one.
Marcus Jones simply awesome in this game vs Cardinals. He also recorded 14 sacks.
Marcus Jones is my team MVP dude is big play waiting to happen future looks bright for ouryoung Dbs !!
Let's go pats nation and my patriots family no body want to see are new England Patriots in the playoffs this year if are new England Patriots get healthy everybody's in trouble let's go pats nation every body is sleeping on my favorite team the new England Patriots and are two new rookie running backs did that thing Marcus Jones did his thing everybody stepped up big last night to my Patriot family do your job next game
Mike Jones Who? Mac Jones Who?Marcus Jones. Dam DHop fumbled McCoy throwing picks and Hollywood still dropping passes lol.AZ offense looks bad
Mac 10 needs a new offensive coordinator
Whoever said the one hand catch isn't special anymore let me see you do it goober why would you say that
"Maybe we're just better " JJ Watt
Looks like Arizona is going to have to sweep the coaching staff out of there. Damn shame to waste some of those players.
Didn't even know Colt McCoy still played. 😂
LET'S  GOOOO PAT'S
the Patriots needed this win bad and hopefully we can still make the playoffs in the end hopefully the team comes together in the final stretch
This just in:  KM will play the Joker in the next Batman film since he hasn't stopped laughing since last night.  TMZ to cover the story...
The pats need to throw the ball.
49er for life but that run by Conner was devastating!!!! #faithful
One more game like this of dink and dunk screens is gonna cost Patricia his job. It’s either going to be Mac Jones, or Matt Patricia as last man standing. My vote is for Mac Jones - and soon. And what’s with Trent Brown being carted “on to the field?” the guy keeps spinning around like a Lazy Susan.
Safe to say.. Pats had a decent draft this year. Just about every rookie has contributed to the team this year. Marcus is a weapon and I'm glad Pierre strong had a good game. He should have been more involved in James pass catching role but I know it takes time. Jack Jones needs a bit more experience but has the making of a great corner. Thornton I hope they let him fly at least 1 to 2 times a game on go routes and take a shot down field
Glad Uche starting to come on. This is who we thought we were getting when he was drafted. Now Judon has help and when Barnore comes back our D-Line should be pretty stout... I don't expect much from this team this year. But hopefully with an actual OC and a number 1 wr. The team should take a giant step forward Kind of excited for the upcoming off season
Let’s go pats!!
I been waiting for Pierre to get playing time all season
10:05 wonder what he was saying to him
Cards line is real bad. Maybe GM SHOULD HAVE DRAFTED CENTER OUT OF IOWA. INSTEAD OF INJURD PROWN  WIDE OUT  THATS BUDDIES WITH MY QB. CARDS NEVER DRAFT DECENT LINEMEN. & U WONDER WHY THEY NEVER WIN WITH CONSISTANCY. GM U STINK. U CANT WIN WITHOUT GOOD HOGS. U SPEND MILLIONS IN LITTLE UNDERSIZED QB THEN PUT DOG POOP IN INFRONT OF HIM. U TRADE FOR OLD CONSTANTLY HURT CENTER THAT CANT HIKE A FOOTBALL WITHOUT IT FLYING OVER QB s head.  Or a grounder! F!  Clean house bidwell!! Start with bozo GM! DRUNK!
i’m glad joe buck is still being an announcer for nfl
patriots arent making the playoffs ur going 8-9
How is colt mccoy still in the league?
I love kevin Harris lol
Pat's suck
Who cares
Why is the commentator throwing shade at odell? If those players actually made the touch downs or receptions with those one arm moves then that's different...
Hey! I didn't see Kyler's injury jawn!
sorry for the time spent
Pierre 💪    Mac 🗑
The Arizona Cardinals suck they might as well pack it up and forget about Superbowl hopes aint gonna happen with the way they been playing lol.
Good enough for injury ridden Cardinals but far from playoff level. Unfortunately it's not looking good this year for the Pats.
Go pats Devante Parker was great now the pats are 7-6
5:34 The amount of time I kept replaying this run.. Filthy
Glad to see Patricia finally using the short timing plays to open up the long game.
Baltimore should have paid Judon
Hopkins look scared... Dude should retire if he scared to get hit...
The person who overlays the fake crowd noise over the highlights needs some serious chill. 6 yard pass - rawwwwwww. Run up the middle for 2 - rawwwww!
Win or lose still my team
Nah, patriots still wack
Marcus Jones… YES all day.
Looks like 4-13 boys. Tough
Very Nice Bro! Get Good People!
Let's Go!!! 😎👌
Please make the thumbnails neutral so we don’t know who won before watching the video.
Damn Hopkins got paid alot to throw that game on a fumble
Mac jones is terrible
Hopkins is a great fumble  machine
Pats still in the hunt.
Poor Cardinals. Poor Kyler. Poor Colt McCoy. He never gets to command a good team. Always a struggle. That coach toast?
kevin harris? not damien harris?
Jesus, the Cardinal's QB goes down on the first play from scrimmage and that doesn't rate as a "highlight"? Who puts these compilations together, a tree stump?
What a game from Uche! Go Blue!
I think the Cards should have paid McCoy and let Murray walk. Running QB's are over rated. They look great running around during the regular season making splash plays but more often than not they flop in the play offs and that's because coaches take less chances and demand QB's deliver balls accurately from the pocket. Hurts in Philadelphia may be the exception but with all the talk about Lamar Jackson, it's because of his running and not his all round ability as a QB. There's a reason why every Super Bowl has been won by pocket passers and I don't see that trend changing.
Good game in all three phases. Now for Patricia to get more creative with the playcalling. Offense requires a healthy dose of unpredictability. Stop the overload of vanilla plays.
McCoy really gave it his all this game. Even with the L it was cool to see. Would be cool to see more of him!
Players we’re dropping like flies ?  🤔
Cards, I think McCoy is a worthy replacement for Murray. Most definitely. Give him time.
AUDIO BIBLE https://youtu.be/JpP1UrggdSE
PATSGANG!
Kingsbury is trash what's it with these coaches not punting
🎉🎉
4:54 how to stand up like a pro
What happened to KYLER ?  Why isn't it on here ?
Can’t lie I was a little worried when Colt McCoy came in to the game 😂. Go Pats!!
Wish they’d get Mac Jones a super star WR. Also is Damien Harris injured?
🎵
No mention in the comments of the excellent performance by Pierre Strong. Looks like a very good RB in the making.
Only watching highlights here cause the NFL app sucks now
11:51 I'm assuming the offsides was eventually called on #9 on this play?
Hollywood brown still dropping passes
DeAndre Hopkins the reason they lost this game. He suppose to be the key guy but he wanna run with the ball with 1 hand
No peewee, no win.
Maybe I'm just crazy, and to be clear, I have no dog in this fight... but I'm seeing a lot of plays in this highlight video where the officials are heavily favoring New England.
Can you imagine this offense with TE Darnell Washington of Georgia blocking for these RBs and being Mac Jones' safety valve? Good Lord.
11:47
9:56 Did they legit not throw a flag on this??
D Hop holding that ball like he's Deion Sanders 🤣🤣🤣
It's so simple: Kyler Murray down=Season Over for the Cardinals (The Bidwill Curse lives on!)
Colt McCoy sounds like the name of a cool handgun LOL
McCoy looked pretty good. That INT might've been a touchdown if he didn't get hit mid throw.
I lost by .2 points because kyler got hurt
if the pats offense was half as good as the 9ers the would be SB contendors
Hollywood still can’t catch. Was it really Lamar
That clap nonsense to snap the ball is just such a big tell, watch Uche and Judon, they get off the line so quick because of it
Cardinals offensive line looks bad
Cardinals paid for what exactly?
Shout out to the editor who didn’t start the game highlights off with the Murray injury 💯
Mac jones sucks still😊
The Cardinals traded a top 25 pick for Hollywood Brown lmao
McCoy: Can you STOP snapping the ball at my feet??? Center: No.
Legendary 49er linebacker "Hardy Brown" woulda loved that hit on McBride !!!
ball is the progrum..... you lost to yourselves. McKiller was doin right for Murray and you wronged him!
I wonder if Coach BB knows WIDE RECEIVERS are allowed to run VERTICAL routes
Horrible fumble by Hopkins
Cardinals are creative in finding ways to lose.
Thank god cardinals suck. Should be easy for the 49ers to win the division now
Huge win pats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The way Hopkins hopped to block at 5:35. Lol
I bet that they would score a combined over 44 … they scored 40😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
What happened Cardinals god let's go my second best team
Mac Jones is 💩.  Zappe would have lit up the Cardinals.
The Cardinals are horrible.
As a cards fan this one stings.. better luck next year, hope kyler heals up fast!
Smh
Dudes talkin way to much fr. 4:20
LFG it’s playoffs time 👀😈💯🙏
Go Pats!
They under utilized Kendrick Bourne all season. Bourne should be on the field 85% of the time, at least he gets YAC and makes tough catches.
Cada día los Cardinals vamos peor...
damn mc coy strong
Damn, they ran the entire clip in 1.25x time 😂
Robbie Anderson wearing the worst fit I've ever seen
https://youtu.be/gEeufiZ4z_E
Said this before and will say it again. GIVE THORNTON MORE PLAYING TIME. Dude can ball
Sunday night, on another website, I posted that the Patriots would win this game. They beat bad & mediocre teams, & lose to good teams.
Fire kingsbury
Cardinals coulda won this game if they put in that kid from Brywerwood who throws it on a dime..
Well, At least Murray will have more time to play Call of Duty.
Judon really got my attention this season.  He's a beast!
With a strong run game and decent tight end, wud obj now be a gud fit for the pats??
12:49 "oh" "OHHHHHHHH"
How is Colt McCoy still in the league.😏
Expected more from the Broncos, Raiders this year. But the biggest disappointment are the Cardinals. They were hot last year, Play the Bowl in their Stadium (a Chance you don’t get often) and now they don’t even make it to the Playoffs
If Tom had this we'd be in the Superbowl and not 7-6.  I hope he comes back next year.
The Cardinals are the Chargers of the NFC
is kyler Murray injured?
Colt McCoy did ok for the situation, with some more play he could be starting somewhere one day. . . .
I'm so over Mac Jones
Ref was like bruh, stfu Jones
Yeah not a fan of either team but I'm certainly watching most of these games and the refs are getting worse. This season I noticed lots of calls going in favor of: - The Patriots - Tom Brady - KC Chiefs. - Last season it was too obvious but the Rams took the crown on calls going in their favor.  Controversial and non calls going to: - Cardinals - Seahawks - Saints - Falcons  There are other teams but I can't think of them right now. What do you all think its going on?
I love the Patriots and the patriotic town of Chillingbourne. ♥♥
Pats come from behind with a W against the Cardinals....
I was there definitely more patriots fans this time from the last time i went
Gee, I read today the DeAndre Hopkins was other worldly - he could do things most ordinary WR's could not. Well, tie game and he COUGHS up the football, game winner - for the other team. Guys are hyped - then can't run a crossing route without turning it over. GAME OVER
The hypocrisies of the fifties were vastly superior to the swelling lusts of those who feel so superior now. When referring to the hypocrites of the fifties, we only had use one pronoun—they.  A glance at our cultural elites today reveals that their pronouns are legion, and they live among the tombs, cutting themselves with stones.
Even without Brady I still hate the Patriots. Cheating pr*cks. Fly Eagles Fly!
A blessing in disguise for the Cardinals. Murray is so ridiculously overrated.
Thank god for Judon and Uche. Our O line needs serious work. Mac is running for his life every game.
Defense won the game again we need  good wideout sign obj
As a Pats fan, I can confidently say. Kyler Murray would’ve made that a different game. Lol! Hope he comes back even better. #LFG
Well unless your vomiting blood,  NFL concussion protocol does not kick in. Kudos to Agholor for stopping the game
Who won?  The Thumbnail said it all folks! lol!! 😅
Condolences to Cardinals fans. As soon as I heard "non-contract" injury, I feared an ACL tear and I was right. Speedy recovery, I understand the pain.
Rooting for McCoy but not the Cardinals.
I imagine McCoy literally handed the win to pats as bad as tribusky did
Wow, that was like watching a HS game lol
Admirable diving catch attempt by Hollywood Brown the CLOWN he didn't need to dive, good job D Hop on fumbling THAN giving up a TD in the process. Get rid of these turkeys. This team is a disaster!!!!!
Cardinals looked more like a football team with McCoy
Great job Pat's
More than likely will be our last win of year lol besides playing the Raiders
As Seahawks fan , I don't get the cardnals they have the talent , they have there Qb? So what is the problem?
josh uche is an animal. him, dugger, barmore, and the two joneses give us some nice building blocks on defense.
Damn Hopkins cost me a playoff north with that fumble lost by 1.7 points
Kendrick Bourne was a crucial contributor for the first time this year. His stats were 5 catches for only 47 yds , but 1 was a terrific diving grab coming back to the ball on 3rd down, keeping alive a TD drive that put the Pats  ahead 27-13 in the 4th quarter. He also threw a few key blocks, including freeing up Kevin Harris on his 14 yard end zone dash.
Lol forget everything else. We literally have four potential RB1. We need to expand the playbook badly
I bet lions fans are super confused by tavai lol
Don't look now, The Pats have a better record than the Bucs
To be fair, if I'm a cardinals fan then I'm fine with the GM. I'd want Cliff out ASAP. That roster is pretty freaking stacked
Embarrassing for the Cardinals.
We just watched two bad football teams playing for nothing. Now that's entertainment! If you think the Pats have a shot, you are deranged. The Cards were embarrassing again, but they're still less embarrassing than our elections and our idiot governor elect. Cards need to stay off Monday Night Football. If the Cards were a high school team they would be scheduled for every opposing team's homecoming game. Beating the Cards is like picking on the smallest kid in school to show how bad you are. Enjoy this victory Pats fans because the next few weeks are going to be a rough ride.
Damn the Cardinals were a potential Super Bowl team last year.Now this season looks grim.They just lost Kyler Murrey to injuries.That sucks.Hopefully he is alright.As for the Patriots if they can win out they will probably be in the playoffs if the Jets fall apart and the Dolphins lose a couple more games.There has to be alot to the Patriots so they can get in 2022-22 NFL playoffs.Good win for the Belichek and the Pat's. 👍.
Finally the comment section is off Mac Jones.
Pats gotta fire matt if they want any chance of winning
Curious why McCoy was using a clap to signal for the snap on every shotgun. Was it really that loud, a home game? Did AZ not really have a silent snap count in their arsenal? Some college teams even use silent snap counts.
Cardinals really suck
Yo, I know you are the NFL and you want to pretend that you have a safe game. But we all accept that you don't. Real fans want to see the injury. Don't take us for granted.
I love the cardinals but i gotta say I'm tired of looking at this dumpster fire of a team all three k's are a joke right now
The Pats DEFENSE won the game. Mac Jones is very underwhelming and deserves none of the credit. 🙄😂
I went down and viewed the comments to see what y'all thought about Mac Jones???? Nothing as usual 🥱🥱🥱🥱 ⚡⚡⚡ Zappe Time.....I wish New England could give up Mac Jones for Jared Goff and we keep Zappe.......
Mac jones still looks shitty smfh he is not the guy he hasn’t show he can leqd the team to win without the defense bailing him out 🤦🏽‍♂️
NE WAY more interesting to watch when they don't have the ball.
Saw this coming  ,Murray  just can't  imagine this character making  it in the NFL definitely not someone you would trust with your teams , future  on the brink sink or swim Cardinals problems are in there ownership GM Wow who in there right mind would would ever have the patience  to clean up this sespool  of supposed professionals .
The pats have got themselves are very deceiving running game.
Great game by The Patriots! Bourne, Jones and Henry rocked! Murray is enjoying his millions while McCoy does all the work! Nuff Said!
If pats lose to Miami are they out ?
AZ 'highlights' end when they take a 13-7 lead.
Funny hand-egg game 😂
HELL OF A GAME 💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌  #NewGenerationBullies
Man I thought Colt was retired
Marcus Jones is just so awesome. Gets a game winning punt return, a passing touchdown on his first offensive play the next game and then today he gets an interception. That was also a brutal hit on that receiver lmao
Rip kylers ACL
Yes patriots winen
Just gotta let mac cook. Once he gets going the team gets rolling on all cylinders
Colt McCoy?  He's still in the league?  Flacco, Dalton, McCoy.  These guys just keep showing up and getting paid.  Good for them.
As a cardinals fan: this is so embarrassing. This team is a joke
Always find it funny when the ref mear feet away doesn't throw a flag, but the 1 in the south 40 does 😂
Does Joe Buck commentate about anything besides last names???
Hopkins, a waisted receiver talent. Don't be mistaken. Why did Texans trade him? Not a pro attitude regardless who's throwing him the ball. Add injuries and you get no production. What a waist!
Finally pats get a win. Ugly but a win
6-6 is a record I never imagined the Patriots would never ever have. Last in the division to Jets and Bills and Dolphins? This hurts.
lol it sounded like there were more Pats fans there
World's fastest toddler gonna have plenty of time for Call of Duty now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is kyler Murray benched
As a Pats fan who’s been living in AZ for years, the feeling New England fans gave in the stadium was electrifying! Something I’ll never forget! 🔥💯
I don’t care how inconsistent mac jones may look at times, he’s got really good downfield throwing ability in both intermediate and deep routes.  He also seems to have a pretty high situational IQ
Can anyone confirm the rumors?  Is the ENTIRE O-line for the Chiefs really being inducted early into the HOF?  They’re really going to bypass the normal 5-year wait after retirement because these guys are just that good? 😂
Yo the cards ruined their chances. Watt ain't gonna ever be what he was, Kyle is only gonna get slower and his height and inaccuracies will start hurting his numbers. If they don't get a stud next year in draft this teams done and rebuild again
easiest fanduel bet, just bet against the Cardinals 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m sorry but I just don’t see #JONES being the future. Hell maybe Brady will come back next year, he’s serviceable #sitjones
Myles Bryant with the extra effort...
Prayers out to K1 😢
Strong, Thornton, the Joneses, Strange, et al. look like a good rookie class.  Mac needs more time in the pocket.  Where's Dante when you need him?
Patriot fans (I am one) all pumped up in the comments when the opposing starting QB went down in the first series. This was not a good win but a win nonetheless.
they finally let him throw the ball
THAT was awful; coaches need to be fired. Team not ready…..AGAIN!  Keim, Kingsbury and Kyler need to be let go and start rebuilding (despite the new contracts)
needed Hopkins for 80 yards in my fantasy league, he got 79 yards, even the announcer on the last catch said a gain of 10
Az will be lucky to win another game this yr. McCoy is terrible.
Kliff on his way out yet?
Must needed dub LFG
Thank you , Murray . Im not making the playoff this year.
Jones is over there getting in the referee's ear about a defensive off sides penalty he thought might be a holding call against his team.  They know how to teach 'em up in New England.  Will the Gillettes win it all with their Kraft-ee ness and massive influence?
Cardinals were right there and then Hopkins goes into "Hay Look at Me I'm a Clown" MODE ---->>>>  and RUINS THE GAME
As a chargers fan I would’ve loved to see the cardinals win but can’t hate on the patriots here they just played better. The hunt for the playoffs is gonna be tight.
Pats Rookie RBs looking good with the starters out! Awesome to see more of Henry and K. Bourne as well!
Oh man stop given spoilers with thumbnails..
You’re not supposed to touch the referee’s right ?
looks like Murray's contract is a winner, 4-8 and now out for the year
Since getting back UCHE has been Hell of a player on the defense. Well done.
Patriots
Online quit. Fire kbury.
Pats really needed this one. Cards are awful; we’re not much better. Ugly win, but enough!
Who? Mac Jones.
Seee you next year cardinals bye an sign off
6:43 get rid of Jones already. We've seen enough. He should play tennis.
It sucks to be a Cardinals fan right now 😂😂🔥
After tn the az front office needs to really see what this team needs.  A heavy o line acquiring off season because we can’t keep kyler from scrambling cause he doesn’t have the time to throw
Go patriots
👊🏾👍🏾 Nice
Was Murray injured first play of the game?
5:57 I don't even have to wonder how scared Jim Carey would be playing QB.  I can just watch this guy play instead.
I'm here because I didnt know who Pierre strong was and his name sounds fake
It was the Cardinals...
Good win let’s keep it up boys
Cardinals need to go back to St. Louis.
That suck for Kyler Murray whose been trying to get to the next level I'm playoffs but team fails him now he's out for the rest of season.
Like as I predicted before star the season!...9 losses...and more to come.....can wait to see new coach staff..and new qb?k has to go!!!!!bring brock purdy...home made real talent!!!!!
Gee, it's almost like Hunter Henry is a competent TE when used properly..WHY DON'T THEY USE HIM MORE!?
Good to see Kendrick Bourne finally get some passes thrown to him. Go Pats!
So after 14 weeks, every AFC East team has a winning record still. Dear lord
2:02 unlike Mahomes, this clown has no pocket awareness.
Do your job💙
Mac Jones is still a scrub I don't trust him
Also, its good to see the Pats utilizing K Bourne and Henry more
People wanna cry and scream racism when coaches dont pick Black Scrambling QBs as their QB, when Kyler M and Lamar J are proof of the real reason being that they get hurt wayyyyy easier and dont last as long as Pocket passing QBs.
As a pats fan, the last few weeks is about to be a long ride
I lost in my fantasy league and missed the playoffs by 0.5 point. I had the NE Defense and James Connor. Final play of the game all McCoy had to do was go down but he fought for a 4 yard gain on 4th and 13....
It’s shocking how there’s teams who, just 1-3 years ago, were playoff ready and now they’re almost like garbage. Whereas the garbage teams are doing a lot better. The NFL is something else…
Man i love the Marcus Jones kid
new england winning based on turnovers turned scores is as good as it is bad.
Been waiting for strong 💪  He’s special already 🎉
Couldn't even bother to include Murray's injury in the highlights.... C'mon, who's in charge of these things?
I swear I could smell those Massholes through my screen. New England vermin need to go back home to their loser state if theyre so proud of it. So proud they had to flee that cesspool state yet cheer it on? lmfao
Not impressed at all with this win. If this wldve been a good team we wldve lost by 2 touchdowns
cardinals are so bad lmaooo
Haha that kyle Murray money is the biggest waste 🗑
Patriots defense had so many defensive miss tackles like hv been doing all season. Smfh
This whole game is fixed.
The cardinals gave the patriots this win
Cardinals fan - sorry for the injury to murray . . . still no excuse... defense, watt, allen...great run connor. You have too many talent. McCoy, do what you do...Fire Chime, fire Kingbury...you're not a NFL couch, barely a high school couch, sorry. You're a Chime mistake. Bidwell, time to make a change
@azcardinalfans#1strndpickbaby
Should we really be excited as Patriots  fans you beat a team with a back up Quarterback. Would this have been the same outcome if Murray  didnt get hurt. Should we be excited you beat a team 4-8 , but cant beat teams 10-3 !  Mac Jones throwing interceptions  once again and getting sacked and letting his frustration  show. He really needs to get control of his emotions , He comes across like a big baby when he acts like that  !  I thought Patriots looked flat the first half and  the penalties made it even worse.  I guess we need to look at it as,  a Win is a Win !   I would call it once again an Ugly Win !  Sure doesnt give me hope we will go deep in playoffs  when we really came out flat and penalties  and just bad football. I think we're lucky we came out with this Win and once again, I ask, is it because Patriots played great  or is it because  you had a back up Quarterback  and a team 4-8 !
Feels good to win a game! Defense showed up in the second half
Welp. Hard Knocks this week will be a rough watch.
that last AZ drive was pathetic
Im calling it rn he faked that injury. He doesnt like kliff, seasons over, he's gotten enough snaps to get his guarantees and hes gonna get his money and hes showing kliff hey you cant win without me
Glad the thumbnail always tips me off to who wins
Football is gay
The defense secondary and linebacker for my Patriots are weak and can not tackle.
New England Patriots vs Arizona Cardinals
Dang that’s bad 27-13 0:01
It's all good as a Cardinals fan I can honestly say we didn't come into the season as prepared as last year It was a rough season 4sure but hopefully this coming up one we come back stronger but regardless I'ma always support em 💪 💯 🏜️🔴⚫⚪ #AZUP #BIRDGANG
Now that there is an injury it gives them an excuse, but to me Kylers injury looks fake as hell, now Kliff and the GM have an out, All three need to go, Kliff is Lost and The GM is Horrible at best. You will not convince me that a Pro athlete that can run like an angry toddler just falls down, It was Planned and there needs to be an independant doctor looking at the MRI. And if Iam wrong and its a torn ACL, I hope Kylers future in the NFL is over and he can become a Pro Video game player
Pats nation how do we feel about having a Von Miller and Von Miller Jr in Judon14.5 sacks and Uche 10 sacks first duo to have double digits this year and the best pass-rusher duo for the far future it looks like also lots of positive young guys making plays I think Tom's coming back he sees a loaded and I mean loaded defense and that boy Tyquan oh boy would tom have fun with that kid 😉
That was a great game! What a win!
Nightmare season for Cards
Hey Cardinals fans, you still feel ok about that contract they gave that midget murray?
Sad game
Kiff needs to be fired, I think he would fit well under Bill here in New England as a QB/OC coach and coach Mac Jones. Move Patricia to defense and judge to special teams. Oh and we will take Hopkins as well.
Judon has been nutty for the pats
Show game live you jerks
If only the offense was as good as the defense the Pats would be in 2nd place right now.  Go Pats!
I was at this game. Patriots fans EVERYWHERE. more than half the stadium was in pats gear
Cardinals need a QB
The New England Patriots are 7-6🔵⚪️🔴 Week 15 at Raiders
Esse QB dos cardinals da até pena ver ele jogando
Pierre strong the next james white 😄
The patriots got something special in these rookies they drafted all of them look good
thank god for patriots d giving me the win in fantasy with 19
Can’t remember when the AFC East was this interesting. All four teams has a shot at the playoffs.
I’ve never seen so many injuries in one game and I’ve never seen a quarterback get hurt so early in the game.
WHats this quality
Anyone else currently not caring about football right now since the world cup is still going on lol I feel so european
Murray is not a good player and never will be. Irregardless of this injury. He’s not even a poor man’s Doug Flutie. Not even a homeless man’s
Another frustrating game. Loosing Kyler Murray didn't help, but the offense wasn't doing so bad in the first half. Did absolutely nothing in the second half besides drive it across midfield a couple times and stall out because of a turnover in downs and an interception. It seems like they just quit after Hopkins forgot how to protect the football. Can't put the loss on the defense because the offense couldn't sustain or finish drives and they got worn out. Patriots absolutely deserved to win this game. The season was already lost anyway, but loosing Kyler Murray to a potential torn ACL is an insult to injury. What Is it going to take to get Kliff and Keim fired?
New England is going 3-1 the last 4 games!
Go pats
GO PATS
yep the cardinals arent playing at home in the SuperBowl disapproves the NFL is not rigged never has been
So let’s see - Kyler likely tore his ACL and will not only miss the rest of this season but likely next season as well. - Keim and Kliffs jobs might be safe for now. - Even when Kyler comes back which is a long time away he may never be the same. This whole Cardinals franchise is cursed.
Solid win against a team we should have beaten. Excellent defensive performance, but too many offensive line penalties (again). We're on to Las Vegas.
Pats still felt like they were losing 27-3 for 90% of the game.
Glad we got the win but our offense is lack luster
I like how the refs didn’t even try to take a second look at the Collins pick yet Bourne clearly landing out of bounds on the next play doesn’t even get a review.  I was wondering when the 6 extra pats defenders would show up today
Pats still felt like they were losing 27-3 for 90% of the game.
*Kingsbury is one of the dumbest head coaches in NFL history & needs to be fired ASAP !!!🔥*
New England is Broncos East: all defense, minimal offense
This Patriots’ Defense would be the reason they make the playoffs. The offense is still struggling with an offensive line dealing with injuries, but Matthew Judon was all over the field
1st
They’re playing like they’re allergic to the ball
The patriots defense is special, Patriots definitely can make a playoff run!
6-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS BEATS SUPER BOWL XLIII ARIZONA CARDINALS
Rip Cardinals season
First
Patriots: Real Madrid! Cardinals: AS Roma!
Let’s go pats
A much needed bounce back win against the Cards! Onto Las Vegas! Seriously though, can this Patriots team show up every week? Go Pats!!!!
