I love the fact that Dinkum is finally a Nintendo but I wonder if we're going to have what you call it cross play because I already have a good amount of progress on Steam and I want the progress also on my Nintendo if I buy it there has to be cross play
hate it when they announce a new game and add a dlc before it even comes out!😢
This direct SUCKED
Ending it with the wet fart of a fire emblem game
5:18 lawkitos
Do not forget, do not forgive
😅
why did the red ranger use a minigun in the trailer thats not even his weapon
Cant Believe its been almost 2 years since this announcement. My excitement for the game was immeasurable

Hola zeta, mira me llamo Hugo Iñigo y veo tus videos desde mucho antes de que rompieses la wii u (como cuando jugabas mario kart 8), tengo 13 años y te veo desde que tenia 3. Mi sueño es que me contestes a un comentario y que seas amigo mio de la Switch. Gracias. Hugo

❌DON'T BUY NINTENDO GAMES! SWEET BABY INC WORK TOGHETER NINTENDO.THEY ARE INTRODUCING WOKE IDEOLOGY IN BOTH THEIR GAMES AND MOVIES, IF YOU ARE A PARENT DO NOT BUY THESE GAMES FOR YOUR CHILDREN
Nintendo, THIS is how you do a 15 minute direct
You know when I was watching this, we are going to my older brother’s funeral not to make things damper, but this direct is always gonna sad for me😢
4 Players: Hm... Full of 4? Online: Yes!
Travelling through these funny stages rather than shooting can be difficult when Super Mario Bros came out for the first time in the 80s because of the arcade coin-operated system. As time goes by Super Mario has become enjoyable in that you can continue where you have died, which should be the same with all other videogames in whatever industry, that's because it is the journey, not the enemies, that gets the player to move forward like a tourist visiting weird and funny landscapes
Looking back at how incredible this direct was after how terrible the Mario  Kart World direct was makes me even more disappointed.
I loved the good old days where Nintendo games were 60 dollars.
Bowser decided he ain't never getting with Peach so he decided to become a DJ instead.
Drop the price
Not adding the steering wheels to the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle ist just devious
And they say the Mario Kart World direct is short
What is Nintendo cooking
Idk why but this gamss artstyle reminds me of claymation for some reason 😂
Anyone here after the Switch 2 Direct?
Man that direct was awesome, can't wait to try it    Wait, what do you mean Nintendo Switch 2 Direct?
This is only like not even 2 years old, but I feel ancient
I still need to try it
This game was… very easy to beat, but fun overall!
沒有2017u版好玩這次做的很失敗
SMBW is already a year old, this game is a retro title now…
*I W O N D E R W H A T Y O U T A S T E L I K E*
morra nintendo
Maybe the deltarune tomorrow was the friends we made along the way
Everyone who remembers when this was new
You didn’t mention this to us about Super Mario Bros Wonder. There is no Time Limit throughout all the levels. That’s really kind of you.
Happy Mario Day!!! I’m upset this game isn’t on this year for March 10.
3:21 The reason im here
HELLO NINTENDO ILOVE YOU ❤
why is this game so good nintendo after 12 hole years i love this game idk why its good but you have to try this game out
The Wall-Climb Jump Looks Like The Wall Jump Glitch From Super Mario Bros.😅 9:50
U Made Smart Ideas!😊
I can't believe it's been a year already!!!!😅
In my opinion the new super Mario bros series is better then this
Im in.  Ive been disappointed with the selection from PS5.
9:18
They should have called it super switch not switch 2 lol
5:18  Sorry... how did you pronounce Lakitu?
thank you for making the booster course pass.
Bowser the castle
Wow one year passed already!
YUPPY
I love the game, but it would be better 8f there was a world 8.
Wtf is nintendo doing?!? This is why I canceled dumb games being brought back.
My club bought this game in my college! It looks great! I knew the princesses would turn into elephants   in this game! It's cool how Daisy can throw fireballs and how you can play different characters in it. The beginning was scary, but I liked it. And it must be tough for Yoshi to move with an elephant 🐘 on his back.
Someone tell me if it’s a good game, I want to get it real bad!
Would've taken this as a straight to dvd type movie since we lost the Netflix show
3:34 I wonder what Goombas taste like...

i love that game
Why is this already nostalgic?? I love this game sm 💕
This game looks like garbage
I don’t understand the art direction or style anymore, I get that Nintendo want to sell games to the super young generation like 7 y/o and up and keep it a good influence but as a avid gamer of the early 2000s this does not impress me. You can animate and draw Mario a million different ways he’s still doing the same things an animation and traversing the same thing over and over. More and more of an almost Teletubbies style of art direction. 0/10 would not buy.
1 year anniversary on this!
Whoes here in 2024
Can't believe is gonna be a year ago on October 20
1 year since the hype for this banger, time flies
mario
Mario friends
Peach riding on Yoshi 0:05
We got to get a Super Mario Party Jamboree Direct.
7:27
Sad the game was mid😢
11:35
ooh that was very lovely!
what a ludicrously good game this. i almost think they went a bit far on the scope creep front.. astounding, gives me tons of ideas for my games too. im glad they refuse to ruin mario.
(7:41) I got to tell you, the Wonder Flowers are unpredictable.
Edit: tell me your favorite enemy in the comments :)

Can’t believe we finally got Metroid prime 4 before gta 6
Can a Yoshi ride on a Yoshi ride on a Yoshi ride on a Yoshi??? 😂😂😂
Nintendo of America, Wow, this made my day brighter! Thank you!
I Love Luigi😍😍😍😍😍
Good game. Just got the game. This is what creativity and design do to the game
It feels so weird seeing the normal presentation after watching the YTP so many times
Who is watching this after the game got released
hi
The sheer number of good YTPs that have spawned from this one video is hilarious
Bowser’s Castle ❌ Bowser’s the castle ✅
what do goombas taste like? WTF?
J
Okay I’m sold. Where can I purchase this?
Thanks to yuzu I managed to play this game for free
GRAND DAD
If Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, the Toads, and Toadette all play the same, what's the point of multiple playable characters?
I’m gonna restart my save file so I can play online all over again
I beated Mario wonder
Nintendo You should make mario maker 3 in 2025 I dont care that I have to wait a year I just want Mario maker 3 and I cant wait
just sad to see only mario got a redesign
You realest it on20.10.23
Can toad have a fire powerup
Ihr habt diese direct nur gemacht um denn tag noch zu verschlächtern denn an denn tag wo diese direct stattgefunden hat ist Stadtfreiertag wegen Umwelt Wohnung Streit und wiederbelebung Krieg ausgefallen am Stadtfreiertag 2024 wird das auch mit gezählt
My favorite 2D Mario game
8:59
Hello, good evening, please, a smash bros ultimate movie.
I actually got the game for Christmas and it was really good
Oh Yoshi's easy mode
F
I don't know about the elephant part
Honestly, I would love to play super Mario wonder but I have mixed feelings about it because Charles martinet retired. It looks pretty fun but honestly I’ll probably give it a chance. I love playing the old Mario games with Charles Martinet . I’m happy that they got the new voice actor for Mario but either way, I’m proud to say I grew up playing Mario. He was my childhood and he still is today.
They should have added wall luigi and wario
WAIT WAIT WAIT IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW YOSHI SWALLOWS HIS NOSE WHEN HE EATS THE SPIKE?!?!
Yellow Toad has earned my respect for defending peach during the bowser castle transformation scene
Hey Nintendo, I’m having trouble trying to get to the badge marathon level and super Mario Bros wonder and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong
Ha the game 2ill be very good and talking flowers ar3 funny.i wonder what goomba's taste like😂😂

Imagine this becomes a mario Maker style
Why the flower said i wonder  what goombas tase like
Yoshi: "Why Nintendo love to abuse me." 11:55
Nintendo you only have one job why did you call that outmaway? The character is just kick the ices and people be like: out my way outmaway!
2:33 Sunbaked Desert 2:37 Fungi Mines 2:41 Deep Magma Bog
can   i     have          a       suitch       pls😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
it's  pretty, but the game seems too easy from the bits I've tried. I find enjoyment in difficult but fair, Ninty seems to be moving too far to the casual, which loses the appeal for me
do not subscribe to nintendo, they will fxcki your payments up,,, oh and there are no trophies,,, say no to notendo
I ordered this game from target
3:33 when flower say, i wonder what goombas taste like
The Content at 0:02 Is So Cool! I Love It!
Thank god they didn't bring peachette
You just had to be there
Already played a day ago don't worry no spoilers with me but with what I seen so far you don't want to wonder for long a sleep on this game it's Really fun sad they took out bumping a little   but I'll live to play another day.
8:34 "Or u might float.... through... space" no script?😂
so cool
I wonder what goombas taste like
Where can I get this game from ❤
This time Peach is fighting against Bowser!
It looks better and better!! 😍😍😍😍
3:22 *Your Best Nightmare starts playing*
X i. [Open

Super Mario bros wonder should have a super Luigi wonder dlc
I have this game
I feel like nabbit will be fun to try and run through a level getting every coin
WOWIE ZOWIE
wait THE YELLOW YOSHI RENDER IN THE THUMBNAIL 😭
Thank you for bringing yellow toad back along with all the other characters
Spiney not spiky
Чіп і дейли арестовувать гочуть 400 років тюрьми
Just like Super Mario Bros. WII, This game will be memorable and nostalgic when kids grow up to adulthood.
They should remake all stars using wonder's graphics
The only flaw I have on mario wonder is that you can't really start  new games on it,you have to use or make a different profile to start a new game.
Mario & Luigi, Rayman & Globox, Bob the Tomato & Larry the Cucumber, Zim & Luis our own famous Ultimate Weapon....... Plungers🪠 Together (Plumbers of Super Mario Bros)
That's Rayman & Globox, Bob the Tomato & Larry the Cucumber, Zim & Luis's our own Nintendo Super Mario Bros.......Mario & Luigi
Finished the game like 10 minutes ago. Glad i didn’t watch this when it came out, christ they showed everything short of the final boss.  This was the equivalent of watching a spoiler review on YouTube lmao.
Freaking wonderful
Nintendo is so creative and unique, so Japanesiee
I Not gamer?i have Not money and Not lucky in the Love & gaming
Nintendo piano lower your prices On your game 🫠
The Swamp (2:37) sounds slightly different in the game.
Who is the guy who does the voiceover in the trailer?
When will you do an offer on it? Why don't you do an offer on Mario games?😒😒😒😒

They suck the new game sucks everything that they make sucks
I am mad at Nintendo
“WOWIE ZOWIE” just makes my day
8:49 joocie? Is that you?
super mario bros wonder vs sonic superstars
Pls make super Mario land's part 3
I've been a Nintendo fanboy for THIRTY-FIVE YEARS.   The existence of Elephant Peach is making me question that.  It's basically advocating obesity! Can we get some fitness stuff to make up for this, please?
hevent played yet but im gonna bet the caterpiller is evil
how can you not want it when bowser is a castle
WHERE THE MIIS AT??
Looks like Nintendo has dumbed down the game & made it super easy for the younger generations, who don’t know how to lose or work at anything difficult. Seriously, a “standee”?
I love this game SM!!!! CANNOT WAIT TO GET IT! I hope they give us the demo that they put in stores 🤞
Where is Wario and Waluigi
Can’t wait for tomorrow!
ITS RELEASEING TOMORROW!
you should add new super Mario Wii to the Nintendo switch
Bowser doesn’t even have a reason to do these things, he just does them for the vine
9:24 is this a full track in-game? I can't find the song anywhere.
Looks like a little over the top to me.
I ❤ mario wonder
I CANT WAIT
Just *WONDER* ing if the ice flower is here??
0:25
It’s funny how Kevin Afghani narrated this whole presentation, and now he’s voicing Mario/Luigi in this very game.
so essentially you get a good high when you touch a wonder flower?
像マリオ一番好きかもw
This is gonna be a WONDERful game!
0:37
What's up with bowsers wonder flower being so much more powerful than the rest?
3:33 the line, 4:26 the face, 5:29 and the power-up that changed it all
While you’re playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder you will see a flower saying “I wonder what a goomba a tastes like?” Then you notice he will remind you of the meme “I wonder what a goomba tastes like” !!!! 1:24
I remember playing new super Mario bros Wii as a kid, I can’t wait to play!
OMG I can’t wait for this game to come out go look at all the detail and when Mario wonder comes out. I say i can’t wait to play as Mario and red Yoshi.😅
Nintendo
can you add Rosalina in Mario wonder please
It's not Mario if It's not Charles
Nintendo forgot WALUIGI
Will it be possible to play 2 player on one console with 2 player online?
Everyone didint notice but there’s bowser jr 0:28 and 0:42
The new super Mario bros. Series is now irrelephant
i watch this like everyday
If they know whats good they will remove the dumbed down talking flower. I am so tired of games that spoil the surprises by holding your hand through the whole game and telling you all of the so called secrets and surprises.
So we are just not going to talk about how good this art design is?
I wonder what Goombas taste like
At first thought this was what Mario would look like on Acid but now it seem like it could be a good game 😂
I  W O N D E R  W H A T  G O O M B A S  T A S T E  L I K E

I am so exited for the Jet Run badge! SUPER MARIO RUN 2!
8:59 WONDERFUL❕ 🔥💥

3:20 talking flowers you say? Sounds familiar doesn’t it?
I wish it can release like October 7 or 9 but I know they are releasing October 20
12:31 Nabbit: Here you go, It's a balloon Peach: *pops the balloon* Nabbit: Uh...  Peach: *turns into a elephant* Nabbit: YOOOO-
12:29 Mario: Let's start a Gameshow!  Toadette and Yoshi: We are coming!
12:07 Everyone: It is time for the Party at our Festiva- Elephant Mario: *goes in here*
"Wowie Zowie!"
i still love the yoshi sound t this day so glad they kept it the same ❤❤
5:58 Luigi is a elephant just like Mario? 6:01 How!? Toad is an Elephant!? 6:06 Peach is really a elephant!? 7:24 Toadette is also a elephant!? 7:31 Wow!? Daisy is now an Elephant!?
Amazing video, but the amount of missed blocks and coins drove me crazy. 😵‍💫
I am going to predict world names:   Blocky Dunes  Shroomy Swamps  Molten Mountain
3:35 meme
Mario turning into an elephant not only him but peach and daisy and Luigi and the toads as well
Nintendo of America Nintendo of America Nintendo of America
NINTENDO OMG OMG OMG
Nintendo you are the best video game company
He said “LAH-ki-tus”
This is a crazy game bro!
Ok, is it me or do I think some of these new characters, power-upped characters, or enemies would make great plushies? Like for example the Maw-Maws or Elephant Mario
14:31 no one gonna talk about CAPTAIN TOAD returning?!?
Can you play online CO-player? Or no just the helping stuff
I already pre ordered  this game 💙💯
I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t like the graphics and the way the game looks… unpopular opinion but that’s just me🤷🏻‍♂️
Why am i already thinking abt super mario bros wonder deluxe😂😂
Badges are an excellent take from Yooka Laylee: The Impossible Lair!
I wish i will be an Mario game haracter in an my own Mario game made by Nintendo
Great will be for Me if you make a Bowser game where he is good and he is helping mushrom kingdom he must be the main haracter im dreaming about it
Bro there way to much stuff releasing this October Mario Wonder,Marvel Spider man 2 Sonic Superstar,SpongeBob The CS on Ps5,Five Nights At Freddy movie,Among us New Map,
But this game look amazing I so excited for the wonder effects power up,the open world,and the level design,and playing as Luigi
This game looks amazing! Picking up on day one!
This is the super mario bros 5?
1:25 Yellow Yoshi is like: Who is this joining us??
All the audience are gonna loooooooooöve THIIIS game
This game looks incredible!
Well, I am not the biggest Mario fan, sure it can be fun and enjoyable but they don't generally fill me with excitement or anticipation.   However watching this, I have to say, it looks really dam good with some great features.
uE
3:33 that's got to be Bryce Papenbrook
😮
14:57 The Switch 2, everyone!
And Mario's voices different that has less of the accent
Wait a second guys look on the icon of the Super Mario wonder the game it shows yellow Yoshi isn't yellow yoshi his pose is the original green Yoshi what happened to the yellow one
Can't wait! Looks super cool :)
I like
cant wait to see the a laggy peer-to-peer connection mario teleport across my screen while i try and direct my bubble towards him
Pre ordered my copy!
This looks amazing! My only qualm about _Wonder_ is the voice acting. There's something about the characters actually “talking” talking in cartoon-y games like this that turns me off in some capacity…It happened with _Lego,_ and it seems to be happening here with the Wonder Flower; although I'll admit that _A Hat in Time_ was an exception to this.  Anyone else feel this way?
Just WoW😲
Looks like the best super mario bros game since world
Basically zelda
So your classic mario game except Bowser actually hasn't kidnapped princess peace

Give us what we want. We want a luigi switch model too!
Rosalina needs to be playable
I still play mario
This on the switch OLED will be so beautiful to look at, and the red switch looks so sexy
5:13 I'm in love with that little animation that the koopas do. So much personality in such a simple style.
Also the #1 thing I CANT KILL MY FRIENDS IN THE GAME ANYMORE!😂😂😂😂
10 bucks says the caterpillar is evil
At 3:15 They say Yoshi can't take damage in this game. And at 11:55 That explained everything about how elephant mario cant bust Yoshi's spine in half But we can hear the struggle Yoshi is going through trying to do the jump
Don't watch it, it spoils the whole game for you
Im questioning myself what normal coins do lol
I AM SO HYYYYYYYYPED
Yes I need more Daisy content!
4:30
4:26
This is INSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE
its always nice to have classic version of mario
this is the perfect mix of Super mario 3D world and mario bros U and i am HERE FOR IT!
i need this game in my life
The animation when they are blowing bubbles is so wholesome. ☺
Castle Bowser looks similar to Bowser's Galaxy Generator.  Edit: I just realised a few things and wanted to put them here. When Castle Bowser is revealed, the guitar that plays uses Bowser's theme from Super Mario 64. The drums and cymbals are similar to it, too.
I couldn't be more excited about this game, it will be amazing!
I just want super Mario 64 co-op on switch
8:43 looks like he forgot to watch the super show, silly mario
Lol bowser gave up on peach 😂
The way Yoshis work in this game is a bit disapointing. We already have Nabbit, so another invincible character was unnecessesary. How I think it should have worked:  - In single player, Yoshis cannot obtain any power ups, but they do naturally have additional moves.  - In multiplayer, when a Yoshi is hit, it goes into a panic and the player loses control. Other players can calm down the Yoshi by jumping into its back.
OH MY MAMA MIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I always wanted after my birthday on November 18,
Its finny how this game looks off brand
Man, nice job, nintendo 🎉
AHH I JUST WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME ALREADY
Now we just need a new mario kart
Is it on mobile or nintendo switch ??? (Will be )
so a reskin of the new super Mario bros games and you all believe it’s gonna be the best? Consumerism is Nuts!!! this game looks uninspired 🚶🏾‍♂️
Looks good but i think theyve gone abit over the top, cant beat the older mario games
The level design reminds me of an over simplified logo they made the levels are over simplified looks like they lack design to them it's seems like it is lazy what they as if they tried to rush the making level and tried to make a level way too fast and did not take the time design the level and not make it lazy.
Did you not care for any of the modern 3d game like galaxy, odyssey, or 3d world?
They straight up gave Mario Soft and Wet. Respect.
So the wonder effect is dmt? Bet 🫣
mariosaidhepphedodo
What would happen if a toad uses a parachute hat badge?
I have a feeling I'm never gonna be able to stop watching this until Oct 20...
For a flower based kingdom, nice that Daisy is there for the adventure.
the music is hype when bowser merged jack would approve
I love that saving peach is NOT the plot
Who is your Favorire Super Mario Bros. Character  Mario Luigi Wario Waluigi Peach Daisy Rosalina Pauline Yoshi Birdo Donkey Kong Diddy Kong Toad Toadette Bowser Bowser Jr. The Turtle Guy Or Dry Bones
I really want this game!!!
IT'S COMING OUT IN 1 DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY🥳🎂🎉🎈🎊
Fire Flower Daisy :D
Not sure how to feel about Mario taking the plastic-y aesthetic all the guidebooks and handbooks had him look like in the 90's, but it's definitely a change from the "New" style, which got old quick.
Oh brother, NOT ANOTHER ONE!!!!!
Looks neat, but how can it feel fresh when it is the same effing story over and over again
Compared to “new” super Mario brothers, this is very good! So much happiness in the flower kingdom ❤❤
Straight up hood classic. Great work😉
This is the first time since Mario 64 that I really excited for an Mario Game (besides Super Mario RPG).
Haven't been excited for a Nintendo game in YEARS, but the level of excitement I have for this game is immense!
this is just new super mario bros mixed with 3d world but instead of a furry bowser is a castle
I feel like bowser is gonna win this time
I love everything about this direct, the new characters, the friendship counter thingy, the new power-ups, the the online accessibility, the funny elephant mario riding the yoshi, and even the new OLED (even though there are definitely cooler ones) is unique in its own ways
Ehy have a local coop but not a onmine coop. Why the japanes always have to make so strange stuff when it comes to coop.i mean in other games they had online coop, and it works with out problems
Mario looking at the enemy is a nice touch 👌
3:46 Characters  Mario Luigi  Peach Daisy  Yellow And Blue Toads Toadette Yoshis And Nabbit
Nintendo why don't you make a demo on the Nintendo switch?
Online play is horrible. This is an absolute disgrace and you do not deserve our money.
si buscas un español, aqui estoy yo jajajajajajajajaja
It's like Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World had a baby and then that baby took steroids! 🤣🤣 I love it! I'm getting this!
This looks absolutely amazing!! I can’t wait to play. I think I’ll be trying online play for the 1st time playing Wonder.
2D Mario just had its Odyssey moment.
1:23 B O M B A S T I C   S I D E - E Y E
Who is Daisy? Can't remember her from previous games.
What About Rosalina?
Peter Griffin: BUT I WANT IT NOW
Heh heh... Who would attempt to anger me? Heh... Only the unwise! For I am powerful! And I have many loyal henchmen... And they do not take well when someone disrespects me... Heh heh... This is your warning...
Super Mario Bros Wonder It's Compatible With Amiibo New Amiibo Figures Of Mario!
Mario and friends take psychedelics
I've been playing Super Mario Bros. my whole life, from 8-bit to High-Def!
5:16 booze
Im guessing it will take 4 hours to beat. 😂 then after 4 years with no price drop, we'll get a "deluxe" version. Then on the next console it will be released for the 3rd time for another $70 😂🤑🤑🤑🤮
A 2nd Mario Party Superstars and I'll be complete
This game looks truly AMAZING! VERY excited to preorder this ❤️🎮😃
Oh yea can’t wait to play
I'm 43 and so hyped for this game! I've been playing Super Mario since 1988 and the creativity continues to pour out of Nintendo with games like this Xx
I'm very excited to be able to play as Daisy! Also this game comes out on my 30th birthday, so that's fun!
This is my favorite mario game ever.
i think the song that plays when they reveal the mario switch (14:55) is probably a coin heaven music? no clue what it could be otherwise Lul
Was genuinely upset when I found out that it wasn't Smooth McGroove doing the acapella parts.
It looks short asf.   Other games have 8 worlds
Got the Super Mario Land 2 bubble hippos in there, love those guys
I remember playing the original Super Mario Bros. in the arcades about 37 years ago.   It's been great to see the series evolve, and this one looks... well, "wonder"ful.
If the Mario characters don’t say “owie zowie” when they lose their elephant powers, they must be arrested by local Flower Kingdom police.   You know I’m right
When Olympics gets E-Sports, Super Mario has to be there. PERIOD.
ESRB rated this game E for Everyone, EVEN with the "language" at 3:33? They need to fix their mistake! It should be rated T for Teen.
Hands Down The Favourite Game in World History of Gaming Culture. Only Major Pet Peeve is That Nintendo has never tried to release a Non- Pixelated, Cleaner and Detailed Original Super Mario Bros.(1985) until now...I hope They do it in their 40th year Anniversary on 2025 or before. When most people want to play it out of nostalgia, Why dont Nintendo do it with better Animated Graphics than the Pixelated Ones merely for Less File Storage? Include Better Processors and Graphics for Better Gameplay in the next gen Switch Console. And Never Downgrade from OLED panels to LCD. In times like now, Handheld Gaming is set to soar crazy over the next few years as People will travel more often and they need a Handheld Device. And Nintendo has always delivered in this space.
3:33 watch out goombas!
Omg, it's king Koopa.... Again. That's original 🤦
I need this game! I want this game, NINTENDO!
Looks like a complete acid trip and I'm here for it, just wish they'd switch up world styles a little more
HOLY S***, THANK YOU SO MUCH NINTENDO. THIS MAY LITERALLY OUTPERFORM MK8DX IF YALL KEEP PLAYING YOUR CARDS RIGHT, CUZ I’M BUYING THIS AS CLOSE TO DAY ONE AS I CAN MANAGE.
Heh heh... Who is this red mustached man? And why does he think that he can defeat me??? Heh heh... Because he is a fool... Heh heh... If he continues To anger me... Heh heh... Well... He will see... Heh heh... He will see...
I wanted Mario odyssey 2 or Luigi mansion 4 but this game is gonna be a ton of fun
11:57 how does yoshi not collapse from this 💀
WOW WAN  NINTENDO JUST NOW WAN STLL didn’t added me in smash ultimate 😒 WAN
So excited to play it!
why are there only 4 power ups?
this is gonna be the best 2d mario game of all time
It's called Super Mario wonder bc at that price point you wonder when you can afford it 😂
So its slightly less like a drug trip now. Awesome!
I’m super excited for this game
I knew it! I knew that Pauline would be in Mario kart 8 Deluxe. Knew it for the last 7 months😄
I can not wait to get this!!!! I have been a mario fan since it first came out in 83 (telling my age🙃) I also hope they make another rayman and kingdom hearts soon
Good
So many mario game lol... the reason of lack of game from 3rd party is maybe because of unity engine debacle
👍
Wow
👍🏻
Yes! Mario on drugs! In all seriousness I love the looks of this game and it might get me back into Mario.
Can you turn the flower off?
Super i like❤❤
Standee mechanic is absolute genius. Prepare to see that in all 2D platformers going forward
What the AF is this. I need it.
yawnnnnn..... 🥱 why must nintendo always take the easty way out of making games.... getting tired of this.
OMG I can’t wait to play this game!!
Looks fun, but let's be honest. It's no Super Mario Odyssey 2.
4:01 thats boring
I love how each world has multiple biomes in it rather than making a specific world for each one❤❤❤
Aw man why is yoshi in easy mode
Heh heh... Many have angered me... Heh... But soon... Heh heh... Soon... Well... We'll see... Everyone will see... WE WILL ALL SEE... Heh heh... This is a warning... Do not anger me...
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND CAN PLAY AS 2 SEPERATE TOADS NOW 🥳

Nintendo, stop putting Kurby games on Nintendo online. Here are some new suggestions: -SinCity - Goof Troop - The Mask - Power Rangers - War of the gems -Jurassic Park - SunSet Strike
Partly me wished that they each turned into something different and not all elephants I want Giraffe Luigi that swings his neck, daisy becomes a Kangaroo that kicks. Peach becomes a hippo that chomps, the toads become rhinos thag smash and toadette becomes an ostrich that pecks BUT it's still really cool

Oh brother... A 2 D Mario in 2023. Two steps forward, 20 years back...
Heh heh... Who dare stand agaist me? Heh... Nobody... At least nobody that is not foolish... Heh heh... For I am The Wolf King! You will never defeat me... But you can try... Heh heh...
Hey, how about we get some news about Pokémon? Let’s be real nobody cares about Mario
I just want to play as one of the Princesses lol I love the polished animations and character designs so much it's gorgeous!!
3:53 Luigi's Mansion?
Super game!  Super Mario!  Cool!  We play in the evenings with our daughter.
I have the game on preorder. Can’t wait for October 20th!
The virgin “New” Super Mario Bros. Series vs The Chad Super Mario Bros. Wonder
The main thing i hate is yoshi and nabbit being easy mode. I like them as characters and would rather use them but im not a bot i dont need some dumb crutch, just let us toggle easy mode for any character its such a dumb decision
Legitamately seeing how big he got and got closer is terrifying.
Dude instead of enemy collision, the koopas literally do a friend bump when the touch each other. This is gonna be a big game bro.
ah s, here we go again...
nice video
"Its got a little something for everyone"
Super Mario is an eternity game)) Several generations have loved it.  I believe that it will be improved and many more people will play it
I'm scared of what kind of fanart wil appear because of the elephant powerups
This game has a variety of characters to play as. That's so cool! 😃👍👏
Is it just me or does the music sound like Smooth McGroove
I can’t wait 😮😮😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉
Enjoying
The handicaps are perfectly fine but if Nintendo is adding ways to make the game more difficult for people looking for them this game will be a slam dunk
at least they do not have peach disapearing
Pantano🐸🐢🐍🐊🐀 and 🏚👻👻
BEYOND HYPED
They whitewashed Daisy.
Can you please release the demo on switch 🙏🏾
We don’t care about Mario. We want pokemon. Where’s the news about pokemon? Or trailers for a new game? Stop wasting resources on Mario PLEASE
I’m so incredibly excited! This looks so well made! ❤️

IMPORTANT NOTE: if anyone has a problem with Peach's elephant form...GET TF OVER IT! also, let yourself know that some of those artists you carelessly think are outcasts to us human beings. You're just boomers and we say "OK" to you. Why? Because people, like me, are going into game design at college. Repeat: GET TF OVER IT! If you want to change Nintendo for the better and hope no more wrong sites would get their inappropriate hands on any of your stuff, because Gamers are nothing but overage teenagers and adults, JUST TRY AND GET A JOB AT NINTENDO IF IT'S BOTHERING YOU! I WILL REPORT IF YOU DARE REPLY, SO IF YOU DON'T GET OVER ELEPHANT PEACH BEING ART STUFF, (funny that you only mentioned her and not Daisy)   Cowards...
A good future DLC for this game would be having the option to change the Yoshis and Nabbit's easy mode to normal mode
bowser turned into pollution 😂
Heh heh... As they continue to anger me... My power grows... Heh heh... They don't know that my power is fueled by my anger... Heh heh... GRRRRRR... THIS IS A WARNING... DO NOT CONTINUE TO ANGER... ME... OR ELSE...
this looks so fun !
Wow! Cool game and better design, it was a little different before.  But they played with great pleasure.  Cool!
Super Mario Maker 3 is going to be inSANE.
I love this, the game looks Amazing.added more features and more ideas in Mario. Lv it 😍😌
Prince Florian huh? Isn't that the name of the prince from Snow White?
6:04 why is this most replayed..? 💀
Guys, I think Mario Wonder already might have 2.2 mil downloads when it is released already and might be better than Sonic Superstars.
I am not a fan of the on screen words of good, great, and excellent popping up all the time. I find it distracting and a little annoying to watch wiggly words pop up every time an enemy was hit, a power up was collected, or a purple coin was collected. Also while I think it makes sense in online to have "thank you" pop up when you are revived, it doesn't make sense for local co-op where I'd likely say it out loud anyway

There are so many elements from multiple titles that make this one intricately unique. Some techniques are from Super Mario World and Galaxy via. drill and shell tossing. Other things, like the badges from Paper Mario and perspective change like Mario & Luigi or RPG keep that variety exquisite. While my only drawback is the Online Play, since there are "certain" ideas players might do, the cooperation is very much heavy in this game. This is one heck of a solid breakthrough.

I'm already feeling jealous of people who are going to play this game.😭😭😭😭
I'm so sure there's going to be a secret world 🌎 in this game 🎮. 😑😐
I'm  overwhelmed. 😭😭😭😭
This game 🎮 will  be  a  blast. It'll  make so much money.
This game 🎮 is making me feel pain on the inside. See what  I'm  missing. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😥😫
Who let them cook🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
I wonder what goombas taste like 😂😂😂😂
Heh heh... My power will soon reach its limit... Oh... Heh... I forgot... My power has no limits... For I am The Wolf King... Heh heh...
We don’t care about Mario. Where are the Pokémon news? We want a new game.
I wonder what goombas taste like…
cant wait for this cute game
Wow amazing Very Very nice
Esto tiene mucho potencial, está lleno de contenido nuevo y con una mejor idea que la anterior Y me gusta que tengan cierta similitud con los Sprites de Mario 3 :3
I never play this
Ahh yes, the Wonder Flower. Mushroom Kingdom's finest zaza.
12:47 Talking flower said WOW when Luigi fell into lava 💀
“This is a new era for Mario”  It’s the same crap as usual
Any ideas what the bosses are going to look like in this game?
No way! My favorite game mario and rabbids sparks of hope released October 20th! Now this gaem does to!
The game will feature vibrant and colorful visuals, reminiscent of the original Mario Sunshine game, but with a new twist of encountering ink monsters and navigating through ink-infested landscapes. The addition of co-op gameplay and the ability to upgrade flood's powers will addmore depth and variety to the gameplay. The ink monsters will pose different challenges, requiring players to strategically use flood's upgraded nozzles to defeat them. The open-world design of Isle Delfino and the other islands will encourage exploration and discovery, with hidden secrets and collectibles scattered throughout the game.  As players progress through the game and collect Shine Sprites, they will unlock new areas and uncover the truth behind Bowser's plans. The story will also feature comedic moments and interactions with memorable characters, adding to the overall charm and fun of the game.  Additionally, the game will introduce new mechanics and gameplay elements, such as platforming challenges where players must navigate through treacherous ink platforms and races against time to complete missions. These new elements will keep the gameplay fresh and exciting, appealing to both new and longtime fans of the Mario franchise.  Overall, Mario Sunshine 2: Ink Invasion will provide players with a captivating and immersive gaming experience, combining the beloved elements of the original Mario Sunshine game with new challenges, powers, and a compelling storyline. It will be a worthy successor to the original, bringing joy and excitement to players of all ages.
Yo Nintendo can we get Mario Sunshine 2 or smth ?
Videogamedunkey be like : You can become a goomba , 10 out of 5 Best game

WHERE MARIO MEETS KIRBY!!!
THE ORIGINAL MARIO SONGS ARE NOT ON THIS GAME, ILL PASS!!!
Is it me, or is the wonder flower just…                                          Weed?
this looks fun but where's the next dk country game?
GRRAAAAHHHH... You did this to me... It's over... I warned you of this... Now I am furious... Heh... Your only chance of survival is if you beg for forgiveness... Heh heh...
add tanooki leaf PLEASE 😭😭😭😭😭😭
He is a building, don’t be racist
They combined most of the classic game mode. This might be one of the best Mario games
This is mario
I thought that was gonna be the bad old "Aaahhh help me I was kidnapped" but nope, bowser becomes an airship
This game feels like Rayman Origins/Legends and it looks like the best Mario game yet. Bonus points for finally making Daisy a playable character in one of these games.
Kinda wish that Yoshi wasn’t an easy mode character. He looks like so much fun!
Heh heh... So... You think that you can defeat me? Heh heh... We'll see... Heh... Do not anger me...
I'm totally fine with drill hat Mario catsuit Mario fire flower Mario bubble Mario. What I'm not okay with is anthropomorphic elephant Mario that is stupid and it makes no sense. If you want him to break blocks just give him a hard hat or something. Definitely passing on this game.
who’s that in first one 0:04
Also Nintendo please make a new paper mario called paper Luigi the marvelous compass
I want 12 players playing the game
I love this game but I want super bell and boomerang flower
this looks fun, i love the flower guys. cant wait to play through half the game as luigi in one sitting then promptly forget it exists for 6 months
2:26 What Name Of The Fish Monster That Hide In The Sand
People who thinks Nintendo should add the game Roblox like
I’m so excited for this new Super Mario game, it looks so fun and I love all the new characters that we can choose and the new powerups and everything! Can’t wait to play it, Nintendo you really did a great job with this one :) 🤍
❤️
This is super cool and I’m excited but I really really really want this style to be added to Mario maker, either in a free update or a dlc please nintendo!
3:57 is like they knew Twitter gonna blow up for Daisy
I take it Nintendo is gonna reboot Super Mario Bros every time there’s a new generation of people. But seriously im extremely excited for this. The NSMB games are very close to the heart for me as they were my life when I was little
Beating bosses and course with online friends now this is D&D Mario style !! Let’s gooooo boys !!
Wow the online play actually looks really good cool and fun can’t wait to play this game
the first strand type mario game
Cool it’s kinda like Mario for Super Nintendo
Is there donkey Kong? In the game
0:18 “cause tonight will be the night that I will fall for you”
Nitendo agan una actualización  de. Mario  maker 2
Wow, this is more than expected.
Dude the badge mechanic looks so much fun and will make the game so much more replayable
Heh heh... If you think you can defeat me... Then you are a fool... Heh heh... You are but a mere ant compared to me... Heh heh...
Toad became Spider-toad, daisy got the ability from super Mario bros 2, I see this as a absolute win
THUMBS UP button
I'm super happy that we're getting another Mario game like this, we haven't had a new Super Mario game like this in years and I'm so happy to see another one releasing, the graphics look like the ones in New Super Mario Bros U but slightly more improved, I really like the new power ups but the elephant one seems really strange, I also like how Peach won't be the one we rescue from Bowser's captivity because we can play as her, I can't wait to get this and play this on 20 October!
When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day. When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day.
When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day. When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day.
When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day. This just looks so creative and polished I love it!!.
mario is now certified fat with the new elephant power up😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is a joke dont take the comment seriously nintendo also love that william aftons here
Now if only this was in mario maker
Finally ome wjere peach aint kidnapped. I like this and it also looks like it has alot of work into it
"Locky-toos"?  What?
First Mario game where Bowser doesn't steal peach lol
Can Jubilee buy out YouTube Channel from Nintendo Company in December 28 2032? Improve Services and Quality  Videos
Did anyone else notice Daisy helping Toadette from falling down 🧡
When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day. Speedruns of this game are going to be INSANE. Well done, Nintendo..
if Nintendo was smart (which they tend to be), you could make a Mario Maker 3 with the badges alone
wow this is so good
Wait first it was mushroom kingdom, now it’s flower kingdom?… weird🤨 0:13
New things to see. New mechanics to tackle. New gorgeous art style. New charming nonsense. This is sorely needed.
Where is Kyle? I want Kyle in this game!
This is what the 2D Mario series NEEDED. I’m so excited to play this!!
We need Mario Odyssey 2 now please Nintendo please
Those hoppos are funny and cute, and some are mindblowing, such as the mummies a bit and those snail guys; may have been another that I forgot (and those domino goomba things). It's good that it confirms that all characters can become elephants and that they do have the ability to store water in their trunk. And yes, I am glad you can store a powerup. I also realized that some powerups are actual powerups and others are from wonder flowers. That drill one is cool, it's a mix between the spiny shellmet from Super Mario Maker 2, the propeller pummel ability and the Monty Mole powerup (which doesn't actually exist). I didn't know that Nintendo would actually be able to make a digging powerup work. I guess that is possible, since they have made the P-Wing before, and there are sometimes alot of crowded gaps. I think something awesome I learned was that it has badges, a new feature in mainline 2D Mario platformers for sure; badges just like from Paper Mario. The world map, aesthetics, challenges and so much more; so looking forward to this. I also just love that recurring funny Skedaddlers character; like a mix between a squirrel, Birdo and Nabbit. The online multiplayer mode is not too bad and has the cool features such as the ghosts and standees, but a bit disappointing that they can't all be solid and interact with the same "plane of existence", so to speak. The new Nintendo Switch is pretty cool too. I must say that I also like the mechanic of the wonder seeds which are like the warp keys from Papa Louie platformers, and of course the stars from Super Mario 64. But man, I love those talking flowers, they are like those talking blue flowers from Undertale except much better of course. Prince Florian is interesting and probably the one you save, wonder if he has abilities or something. I just remembered that other goon that I found mindblowing by the way: The Melon Pirahna. 🍈
Cqn you put mario games on the ps5?
Mario has ate to many mushrooms
what happens if a yoshi sits on a yoshi thats already riding another yoshi?
🔒ytues 5:17

these new main powerups are over powered, like they can just deny an obsticle from hindering you (especially the bubbles)
9:42
Law-kee-tus!? I thought it's La-kee-tus!
I wish I could unsee all of this 😭
This game shouldn't be more than 40 bucks.
i am going to love this game! :D kinda wish they kept the outfit feachure from super mario oddesy tho
All characters you can play as: mario luigi blue yellow toad peach toddete daisy red yellow blue green yoshi and nabbit
Bowser Polluted Flower Kingdom
Bro what is this what happened to like all the other Mario bros games
I've never tried Mario on Switch, the last time I'm paying mario was on 3ds. Now i want to buy mario game, but I'm confused. Should I buy Odyssey, or wait for wonder?? And I'm definitely buying a mario rpg later. Any suggestions  anyone? Odyssey or wonder?
Wow
Peak Mario Bros.?
These new Mario games wouldn't be terrible if it wasn't for the naming of them... Wonder? It looks like a great game, but they need to bring out their A game when it comes to titling.
The online feature in Mario wonder might just be the one reason to get me to buy the game
Mid
yoshi ride a yoshi haha... and elephant ride a yoshi, LOL
Oh no mario didn't watch the super Mario bros super show and now he's a goomba 😭😭😭😭😭
Looks so good! Is that Smooth McGroove singing at the start??
Sper i like ...
BLUE TOAD!!! 🔥🥶💯😫🗣️
Awesome
Is there a reason for players being shadows online?
"7 areas"? Bro why are you lying, we all know it's gonna be 8

Nintendo understands that the main focus of games is that they should be fun.
I was hoping that Day Bring the cat suit back when the game is released
I hope there's going to be a level Creator but that will probably not happen but I hope it does. If it does happen, the level creator will probably be called Wonder Maker mode
It so good
They made Koopas even more passive.
8:06-9:01: Fever dreams be like:
I hope this game comes real soon I can play it and Super Mario RPG.
the game looks like a lot of fun 🎉🎉
Is this Mario souls?
They finally brought back BLUE TOAD!!
There is no way Nintendo can convince me to buy this game
GAME RELEASES IN 1 MONTH LETS GOOOOOOOO
Same day as Spidey.
the fact this made me want to cry out of happiness is  insane
looking at those elephant forms... talk about elephantiasis
Mario really said wowee zowee

Please, please Nintendo, when will you make a new WarioLand game?  Stop with those WarioWare minigames and give us a new 2d Wario platformer like Mario Wonder.
cant wait to play this game on my virtual nintendo switch :D
I love how they bring some things from the old games like the ghost idea (from new super Mario bros deluxe) and turning into enemies (from Mario Oddessy)
i love the subtle animations for the enemies and characters! like the koopas getting surprised by the bubble approaching them or mario getting electrocuted. such a big improvement from early 3d mario games like sunshine and galaxy. it really gives the game more personality
Now i can confirm that this game will traumatize me now <3❤❤
bro mario got a Super smash bros melee clothes
ters no timer in levils
bet this is gonna be in Mario maker 3
This game was mad with much love i like it
Listen, im sorry, this is a beautiful game but also so uninteresting to me. Mario games feel so childish nowadays to me.
For some reason I think 2D Mario has been never able to reach it's peak that it did with Super Mario World, which was released about 30 years ago. Never have seen a game with such a well realized world map and so many levels with secrets and secret exists. Some places are just brilliant like the Forest of Illusion or the Star Worlds. Modern Mario games are just so easy that playing feels more like a chore, like going through some motions rather then playing a game.
This looks like a game for Babies and Game Journalists. Where is my punishing and unforgiving difficulty?. I want a challenge!.
this is gonna be the greatest mario game oat. they somehow outdid themselfs. nintendo making me cry with this, the abilites and badges will make for some insane level design
You can download this game? Or you need to buy the micro card?
I wanted a Nintendo Switch from the day one, I'm getting one in 2 days, my last Nintendo console was Gameboy Advance SP oh boy.. Long time without Nintendo and Its cozy feeling
Daisy is going to be my main for sure
peach is using a hat to glide but if she uses her umbrella that would be awesome
0:44, Daisy is so sweet, look at how she helps Toadette back up  0:47, And then we got Yellow Toad protecting his Princess 😂
6:11->6:24 Super Mario Bros. Wonder soap bubble scenes
my biggest complaint is the Yoshis don't store stuff in their cheeks it looks ugly with their mouth folded up like this
11:52 finally some Yoshi on Yoshi action
well this looks like complete garbage
This may sound controversial, but I think this game is way better than the New Super Mario Bros series in my opinion.
8:34 ''Space? SPACE!? SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE''
i dont trust talking flowers not since undertale
Nintendo Switch hands down the best Nintendo console ever with all those games.
My dream came true. Yoshi riding a yoshi and all they do is try to eat things
👍
There is eight worlds look at the place were you can go to any level quickly
Aqui equipo 2 👇🏻
I don't even own a Switch and I want to play this. Just wow.
Looks good as expected but over hyped.  Not as revolutionary as say Zelda botw for the franchise.
I'm so excited!!!

NOT I WONDER WHAT GOOBAS TASTE LIKE 😭
8:34 I like how this is the one that breaks the narrator.
I'm calling it now, mario elephant rule34 will be bigger than Overwatch
Yawn
This will be the best game ever, calling it.
If I wanted to play doom eternal I would play it... Zelda Totk is a doom rip off.
The game looks really great I put it on my Christmas list.
Mario is reaching at this point. Elephant Mario and including a rabbid lol. So dumb
I have been playing mario since I was three and now look at my man
Online looks pretty lame that there ghosts n u cant pick them up or threw shells it em disappointment is immense
An elephant riding a yoshi...WTF...so much abuse.
Anyone else not impressed with this? It looks boring and bland. Too easy.
So what I'm seeing is that someone at Nintendo hq took a bunch of acid and created this. Cool. Take my money. I'm into it
LockeeToos lol I find it strange the flower just sounds like some guy
So wonderflowers are more or less drugs?
I still can't get behind the NSMB style, it just doesn't look as good as the SMW style.
bosses?
Very impressive game
Super Mario bros. on acid: The game
2:02 Oh my, those little goombas have evolved into king oyster mushrooms!
But who's the new voice of mario?
Aw I wish I could afford a switch
11:57 Poor Yoshi. Imagine the pain he is going through having to carry Elephant Mario.
wow yet ANOTHER mario game. yawn. Pokemon is better
Very based
I was so excited until they explained how Yoshi works.  I want the ability to ride Yoshi.  Bring us back to the SNES times.  This new "Can't be damaged" garbage takes away from mario.  It's going in a direction I don't enjoy.  I will skip this one.
This looks SO fun!!! 🍄
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOSHI
is it online?
I want to watch this soooo bad but I’m not gonna cuz i want the game to be a complete surprise
There NEEDS to be an AUTO-COLLECT for item drops in Zelda TotK and BotW, either full update or make it unlockable to auto-collect items before they plumet and fall off the edges of the world. Its just bad programming and poor development that punishes a player.
私は日本人です！！ほら見て！！日本、ニンテンドーはすごいでしょ！！
Can’t wait for nerds to tell me the optimal badges and power ups for the best run😒
I noticed that the first wonder effect that we saw in the last video 2 months ago they changed from the pipes staying in their places and moving to all being on the same level and moving
Just imagine super mario maker with all of this....
After all these years they might finally have a decent successor to the original super mario bros.
This game will stomp on Starfield like Mario stomps on goombas....
Cool vid ...❤😊
Twitch is about to be up. 👀
Looks like another version of Super Mario Deluxe U which is god awful.  Guess Nintendo is saving the fun Mario games for the next console.
Nintendo also, can you make a android 0ort if possible 😅
this looks like an odyssey version of a 2d side scroller mario game
i already perordered and i have a suggestion to include mario wonder assets in den next mario maker game.
This just looks so creative and polished I love
I'm actually SUPER GLAD they went back to the Mario Bros 2 way of exploration.  No Timer.  Just exploring the land.
The idea of the game is great. This why nintendo is beter then ps cuz i knows what nintendo wants
DAISY
This looks amazing. It looks so fun.
Wonder flowers are just deliriants and hallucinogens
Holy cow, is this a Mario reference??!
Mario 2D is the way to go. Wonder flower a.k.a acid trip
The only thing I hate is the face Yoshi makes when their mouth is full; it looks too weird.  It looked cuter when their cheeks puffed up.
Now the question is: Will Nintendo keep this game running in five years or are they going to ditch it just like they are ditching Animal Crossing New Horizons this year?
This game looks like it has been optimized for toddlers.
Hope this has moderate difficulty.
fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🍆🔥
A 2D Mario Game with a unique story, gimmick, and visual style plus a decent difficulty curve that likely won’t be boring and generic? It’s a miracle! I’m so excited for this!
imagine playing this while tripping
I just can’t get past the fact they made peach and Daisy smaller than Mario 😭 there was no need to cut their dresses in half
It’s too bad I can’t kill my friends in game anymore :(
My daddy is buying it when it’s Christmas
This looks great, and I love that they added a lot of new and interesting ideas and character abilities!

Game art style looks amazing!!!
Don't read the newest comments, worst mistake of my life
This game is peak 🔥❤️👌🤩
I burst out laughing at the "Yoshi on Yoshi" part
looks good but the narrator's voice makes me want to die
Peach’s elephant is cursed
FINNALY A 2D Mario game where you cAn play as peach
Thanks for all the info! I've learnt all these secrets now, I don't feel like I need to play the game to discover all this. saved me some money. :)
3:33 Louie moment
Shame that Nintendo won't publish any game on Steam. I would buy it in a heartbeat.
I wish Nintendo would either get rid of underwater levels or actually rework it to be more fun and interesting. Water levels have sucked since they were first introduced.
Oh my god, bowser is the ship??? The end fight is gonna be amazing.
I hope online players don’t look so transparent.
When the next Nintendo Direct arrives, the ESRB will change the rating for this game.
Nintendo has been on a roll with these titles! I feel like, at this point, 2023 is just a victory lap for Nintendo 😀
Daisy actually getting to play in a main game is crazy
Nintendo, we forgive you for your 2012 sins
Yoshi riding on a Yoshi feels like cannibalism in the Mario world
I'm very excited for this. What a great multiplayer and online player concept with the shadow player system. Very nice touch Nintendo
12:05 I don't understand, can I play it in co-oop?
THE MAW-MAWS!!!!! I need a plushie NOW. They’re so silly I’m in love
This soundtrack bouta be so fire
Engagement
"they all play the same..."  DOH.  What a missed opportunity.
Am I the only one who's excited about Kamek's return?
i hate the new character models and animation. They all look like the game is made for toddlers. They all look fat, childish and mini mario looks like he has some kind of retardation + the jumping animation is just not it. This might actually one of the worst mario games visual wise that ever dropped, id rather play this with N64 or gamecube graphics than with this overanimated graphics. Should have kept the original graphics of mario bros for switch
There are no Waluigi and Wario as playable charcters? I hope they will be!
goomba sound like goku
It looks exactly the same as the last few super mario bros games
Thank god for not another princess saving plot! Those flowers sound annoying so I may play on mute
This looks awesome!
Looks the same
Super duper nice color and review
Nintendo pls the online is bad Change it as if it looked like 3dword but the rest is good
THAT SHIP OS BOWSER AND A CASTLE??
The fact that they actually brought back the animation from Super Mario World where Mario's hat tilts up a little when he comes down from a jump is freaking awesome
Good game but I was hoping we would get a good story line.
They say all the characters play the same (like the peach mario logic toad daisy charcters) but that shouldn't be peach should be able to float after a jump, lugi use to do a jump then run in air to get hang time.. do they not do that no more?
Man. That hub reminds me of super Mario world with bowser in the middle lol
the name looks like my ip
wonder flowers are basically psychedelics when u think about it
8:54 oh noes...
6:11 didn't that powerup come from a smw rom hack?
“I wonder what goombas taste like”
4:38 smm2 skipsueaks but without the delay
They keep reinventing themselves and make some many new stuff. This game looks awesome I can’t wait to play!
1:15 off topic but why tf do they all look so happy when Bowser literally just invaded the Flower Kingdom in front of they eyes ? Also Peach, you better close that mouth
I will be getting this for my birthday, the best birthday gift
I want to take a moment to both thank and congratulate Nintendo for bringing back the spark they used to have that made their games timeless masterpieces. They never necessarily lost it, but they didn't always tap into it either.
Is this game 4 players at the same time
Speedrunners are going to go insane for this
I think this is the best way for Online Play Nintendo came up with for a Mario game.
I dont like the talking flower
Super Mario is that simple and fun game that even those who don't know how to play can play and full of details to replay.
Looks like the best new Mario game yet. Can’t wait to play it with my son.
best mario
When this game comes out, I’m gonna play with it all day
This game is a masterpiece
Theory: prince florian' was prince haru all along.  Warning: made up.  In 2002 august 8' during the mario sunshine year. Bowser kidnapped prince haru' turning him into a caterpillar.  Then prince haru as a caterpillar' made a new idenifty' called prince florian.  And actually started enjoying it. Also he needs' to hide his secret being a caterpillar.   Thank you.
This is the year of Mario. First the Mario Movie, then this game, and we'll see Super Mario RPG remake soon!
WOW nice this game is so amazing
Any Toadette mains in the comment section
we want a new game of donkey kong
A true spiritual successor to the SNES Mario Worlds
まじでえぐい
Drugs.
Had the chance to play this game at Nintendo Live and it went from day 1 purchase to I *NEED* this game now!!!
Legendary games that stand the test of time not like today's crap
Mario talking so much is odd
did anyone notice the flower glitch

You know not what you've done Nintendo
14:49 nintendo...
Finally something Mario that’s new and refreshing, this is exciting to see for the Mario universe. It gives me strong psychedelic vibes
They finally made super mario world 3
yoshi baby mode lmao
This looks really good
I am already theorizing ways to “bubble jump”
Oh thank you so much for showing this I watch it over and over again, but how do you know?
Since we got a new style in Mario wonder. Does that mean we might get this style in the next super Mario maker game?

Jeez the fanboys are in full force for this one… it literally looks the exact same as every other single modern 2D Mario gave over the last decade on multiple systems. You guys are so easily impressed by a quick change of scenario or a different animal power up. Raccoon, bee, cat, and now elephant… so innovative!
Wow,such a nice video...
cannot wait for this, im currently playing super mario odyssey, i must say the mario switch game series really hit different, so fun
this looks like nintendo is experimenting with new things which everyone loves!!!
So, what you mean to say is that Prince Florian is now homeless. Bowser stole his house, remodeled it and then relocated it.  Bowser is a squatter to the fullest.
Ngl, this game looks like a pipe dream (no pun intended), but also very challenging and fun. Can’t wait for October
This is gonna be peak

Where is Super Mario Maker 3?
I'd buy it for 40 bucks.
No Rosalina :/
I really like how many net enemies they've come up with that feel like they've always been apart of the universe. Mario maker 3 is gonna be insane lol
They made a mistake with the elephant berry. They should’ve made a specific animal for each character, like for peach, she could’ve been a cat.
BRING CHARLES BACK
BRING CHARLES BACK
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 it's  so funny that mario is so big sitting on yoshi
BRING CHARLES BACK
BRING CHARLES BACK
This game has more enemy variety than Tears of the Kingdom.
Oh....wow.....another 2d Mario game 🙄🙄
I can't believe you can play as Princess Daisy in a main Mario bros. game! This is great! We got to play as her in Super Smash bros. Ultimate and now Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Way to go, Daisy! 🧡👑🌼  I bet Luigi is proud he gets to be with her.

..i feel like EVERYthing created post-'rona 2019 has been compromised in one way or another but i fully support the delightful nostalgic happy place therapeutic value of Nintendo entertainment sooo I'll pretty much buy anything they release..but I wish they'd make a VR platform to rival Sony PSVR Sony's Astro Bot is transcendent..but theyve moved on from it & none of their epic VR games are cross-platform w/ PS5
low key..in celebration of this release..i need Nintendo to drop that Mario World Tetris 99 theme i missed..ive unlocked EVERY skin except that one & im sick about it..the retro Gameboy theme is my favorite & i use that one the most..it was the theme that drove me to Tetris 99 in the 1st place..but i need that SNES Mario World theme bad..i'll be playing Tetris for the rest of my life..need it
2023 is the year of mario first the movie now this game completely shaking up the formula with new abilities and online experiences
I had a mental breakdown when I heard them pronounce Lakitus 5:21
HEY! I'M DAISY!! :D
What are the platforms for this game ?
That Bowser theme is lit.
Who gave miamoto mushrooms

this looks so mid
Been a hot minute since I played a 2d Mario game last one I played was new. Super Mario bros wii definitely Gonna try this 🦀
cannot wait!
This is one of the best episodes
Yknow now that I know it’s not Charles Martinet voicing Mario and the other it’s gonna take a lot of adjusting.
This is THE 2d Mario game W Nintendo
Nice video
As a yoshi fan I hope that I can play as yoshi and still take damage.
I'm 27 years old and this reminds me when I used to have my gameboy when I was a kid, Good times!
6:06 my god Nintendo, what have you done 😳
Mario Maker Three bouta be lit
11:53 - "OMG it's like a mummy and a daddy!"  ...Kudos to anyone who gets this reference LOL
I actually can not wait for this, I really want to play this sooooooooo bad, its just a matter of time for it to come out, I'm so excited :D
This sounds like a rick and morty alternate commercial. The way the guy talks is hilarious. REAL fake DOORS!
Awesome.. Looks fun
6:10 naw spunch bop be mario now
Bowsers castle is sick
Can you make a stack of Yoshi's? 11:53
Game looks epic
THIS IS AMAZING! everythings just perfect about this game
another special masterpiece from nintendo <3
looks really good.
What’s bowser origin story
03:34 they taste like mushrooms pizza...😆
my goodness ^_^ this may be my new favorite mario since super mario world!
Another side scroller. Nintendo, get off your butts and take a risk with something fresh. Also, for the love of god have some continuity in your series, don't be SQENIX and produce shallow content like they do with FF.
I bet this would have looked amazing on the 3ds
Mario overload
8:58 thats not marios tone anymore... the one line the new actor didn't quite get in the happy tone.
10:35 - 10:40 my man trying to be Sonic over here he's trying to be him so bad
Yessssssssss. I pretty much only play Super Mario games. Excited for this new one and their remake of RPG
3:42 - 3:44 this one just said 👉👈
Ok I know all the drug people playing this game while high on shrooms or acid finna be having amazing trips while playing this game and I’m down to try
Hey, It's Bubble Bobble Mario!  🙂
Wow! This Trailer Is Awesome!
I can only dream of a Super Mario Maker with Super Mario Wonder as a theme with all these awesome new mechanics and power ups!

It’s honestly not the super Mario bros game I was expecting but I love it, wish we could of seen some old items back but I can’t complain about this trailer it’s perfect🙏🏻
With Yoshi being a playable character, I'm sensing friends potentially betraying each other by giving their partner an "extra" jump...just for the said partner to end up sacrificing the Yoshi player off the cliff in co op
If its anything like the 3DS NSMB titles and the bangers they dropped for wiiu/switch, im all in.

WAHOOOOOOOO!!!🔥🔥🔥
I must find out if all 4 yoshis can ride each other all at once.
Ah, yes, I can't wait to play Mario on drugs
pokemon is better
This may be the best Mario game to date. It’s so polished and easy but also I’m sure they have some solid difficulty scales for those hardcore Mario fans. Love it!
Great game, it seems a little bit too new for my taste, but also too easy. Last thing, the power ups are too powerful id say
This game looks like FUN beyond all else. As Mario should be!
Imagine getting groomed on Super Mario Bros. Wonder's online mode
come on nintendo 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ this just looks like a wii game
BLUE TOAD!!!!!!!!!
Boring and depressing.  Nintendo is done.
It feels like throwing everything at the wall to see if it’ll stick. Can’t wait
Why do they give Mario so much attention and all of these games and yet donkey Kong gets treated like garbage no games no attention no new characters nothing
They added toddler mode 💀💀💀💀
If you're over the age of 6 and you play this, go touch grass

if nobody is gonne say it  I wil the wonder floer looks like your just high asf
Those talking flowers are going to get annoying.
Do you need nimtendo switch online to play online mode or to play with ur friends online
the wonder flower is like being high
This looks promising. Loved the Fire Spike. Also I wished theyd include more Bosses like Wart, Mouser etc into it along with Bowser.
Memers: Where's the Koopa Troopa bah bah music?  Nintendo: The contract says it won't be in this game.
I can’t believe we’re finally going to see Wart in a new Mario game! Insane
Excited People!: 👇
this Nintendo direct tickled my pickle
I'm glad that Nintendo is finally evolving past the New Super Mario Brothers formula, even if this looks to be bowering a bit from Kirby Star Allies.
Turns out Bowser was the good guy this whole time. 😏💯
Have they got Smooth MacGroove for the acapella?
multiplayer integration is genius, well done!
There’s no way the wonder flower wasn’t inspired by Kirby’s epic yarn
Great
Wait so I can't play the story mode with friends online???? WHY!? I wanna play the co-op version that's available in local play online!! My friends don't live near! Why does Nintendo make online play so complicated and limiting??
I… love… it…
Is it weird to say that I am excited for the talking flowers?
12:44 Super Mario Dark Souls?
Bowser becomes the Dark Gundam
I know lots of people like the art style, but I think that’s the only thing I’m not a big fan of here. But the new mechanics, powerups, and stages all look awesome
For some reason, I see Prince Florian being a twist villain. Am I the only one who gets that vibe?
this is AMAZING! im buying this the second it comes out
What the mushroom kingdom characters have turned ninja!
the talking flowers are soooo cute!
I just love how after all these years, Nintendo's still got it in the creativity department
This probably won't matter to many people, but my dad just watched this whole thing through with a look of wonder on his face because he loves the original Mario games. He's probably played the games bought for me and my siblings more than we did, and he's beaten New Super Mario Brothers Wii and Deluxe more times than I can count. He was asking me questions like "how can I play this?" and "we have a Switch, right?" He says he's gonna buy the game as soon as it comes out.  The amazing feeling Mario games give to people truly is wonderful.
Yeeeeeees
Bro why toadette
To think that bowser now has fate and plot manipulation can absolutely obliterate sonic
Looks great except for those annoying poorly voice-acted flowers that talk to you.
Excited to play this game!
Nintendo do you have any updates on the princess peach game
Nintendo do you have any updates on the princess peach game
mr electric and his power cable dogs
I have a feeling this game is gonna be more fun to me then mario odyssey, ands that insane because i love odyssey.
Lol this voiceover guy is the same guy who does HowToBasic 😄
I only wish that they would make the final plunge and do full online play.
Pls add rosalina
Tomodachi life when
A new Super Mario in 2023 … in 2D 😂 Only Nintendo can take full advantage of their customer and milk them with something like that 😂
nice game
The voiceovers for these are always so weird. Like what mood are you in dude? All of them?
8:53 NO WAY IS THAT A SMW REFERENCE
Nintendo social credit score
I love the heavy metal involvement
😊😅😅😮😢😂❤😮😅😊
Glad they made 2d Mario as interesting as Mario Odyssey. Imagine if this game gets a Mario Maker...
I was Wondering how Nintendo would change it up after they created Super Mario Makers 1 & 2... the games that could make for any levels. This game had to introduce a ton of new mechanics ... and they did!
I love the little co-op improvements here! My kids and I played New Super Mario Bros Deluxe and I always ended up grabbing my daughter's character just to get her through difficult parts of levels, so stuff like the Yoshi mount, shared lives and the ghosts are gonna make this even friendlier for the little ones at home
They better not charge 70 for this
Did they do to much? Guess we'll find out.
Crap! Same day as Spider-Man 2. I am broke😂
Peach ELEPHANT？？？？
With the grappling vine you literally become spiderman
Elephants are bigger than Yoshi’s. How is that possible if an elephant can ride a Yoshi 😮
Seems nice! Really distinct from other mario 2D plateformers
im surprised no one has mentioned how hoppycats behave is very similar to skipsquaks in mario maker 2
Finally a Mario game where they do drugs!
it looks cool and all but i would love some more 2d Mario games that use 2d sprites again and were mainly single player focused
This is gonna be so good
now this feel like a proper 2d sequel! so exciting!
They need to implement this in "Mario Maker 3".  I can actually picture some cool and hard levels with this game mechanics.
I want to see the trailer of Disney illusion island DLC Update in next month please 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nintendo still have some great surprises for us
Those maw maws are really creepy...
Nice
5 stars
Yes now i play as Pech!
I cant believe they killed the best feature, throwing around friend😢
While it looks great - It doesn't really look any different from past side scrolling Mario games apart from the wonder flower bits...
I wonder who's voiced Mario, since Charles Martinet won't reprise his role in this game
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THIS GAME!
This looks awesome! Definitely one I'll be picking up!
Bro what is that jump sound? It sounds awfull
Yoshi squared.
This is the first time Nintendo have changed the mario formula in nearly 17 years. Its safe to say it looks like theyve done a good job.
AHHH THIS SO LITERALLY AMAZING!! I CAN SPEEDRUN WITH MY FRIENDS AND SO MUCH CREATIVITY WITH THE GAME!!
game is not only about ultra-realistic graphic. mario proves it.
Can't wait. Stoked for this and Mario RPG.
im waiting
I can’t be the only one who thinks these graphics look goofy af like it feels like a Mario mobile game
Brings back so much Nintendo DS memories😍
Drill that can go on the roof 🤯 my mind
Everything about this is absolutely perfect. I really dont care about waiting 11 years for this game just because of how good it looks. Its honestly such a disappointment that this wont be a game of the year but it will be in our hearts for sure
This game is going to be an absolute fever dream and I am here for it
I'm so excited it's insane.  ANY Mario or sonic game gets me moist~
This game looks awesome. It’s like a modern version of super Mario world.
Bowser is a very bad guy !!
This looks amazing
When will wario return as a playable character

Wow. Best 2D Mario since 1991?
I’m so excited to play it next month
ASMR
This feels soooo fresh
WHY do we have to wait so long
They made mario fat GOTY
remake of mario 2 but looking like this
Last time I was excited for a Mario game was odessey. I have hope for this. Just scared it’s gonna be too similar to new super Mario bros
i might actually buy another switch after watching this
Yoshi and Nabbit are 'Little Brother/Sister' mode lol
it’s looking like this going to be game of the year but the only mistake y’all are making is when we are playing online or co op they shouldn’t be ghosts
11:49 "If someone's playing as yoshi You can jump on their back and ride them"
Yes, sonic versus Mario pot to the electric. Boogaloo has started and I am on team sonic not team Mario.
In the beginning, to the left, you can see the mushroom kingdom!
When will Mario developers realize that always usin online co op in Mario games almost NEVER works out properly 😭😭
Who is the new voice actor of Mario and Luigi?
I really hope the talking flowers say the weirdest things
Is that SmoothMcGroove at 2:50?
Shoulda made each character play different like super mario 2.

I want a new Console Nintendo, announce it already please, it's time.
I can't put my finger on it, but this game is giving me the same feeling I had back when I first saw Super Mario World for the SNES
should have called it super mario cloud-9 mario tries weed for the first time cause holy crap there's a lot going on here lol
with so many animal-related enemies, I hope dolphins can make a return.
I hope there’s some recurring power ups from past mario bros like the hammer suit🔨 or frog suit🐸 or even the super acorn🌰
PEACH WTF
Nice
Kind of ironic that this game doesn’t have the word “new” in it like all the other Mario Bros games
Thank GOD Blue Toad is still playable.
So excited for the Bubble Flower power-up, it's about time Mario embraced his inner bubble bath enthusiast.
1.6k dislikes? Why?
yay another old game
Bowser: Look at me, I'm the castle now.
OMG, everything looks totally sweet! Prince Florian is so cute, I love the Bubble Flower, I’m so happy that the Fire Flower is returning and I hope that many other power-ups will too, especially the Ice Flower! Long before Super Mario Bros. Wonder was announced, I always believed that the Flower Kingdom was located in Sarasaland, and that it was the kingdom that Princess Daisy ruled over. After all, her theme is flowers, and I thought that those two things were the reason why she’s in this game. Maybe Florian is Daisy’s brother, and he just happens to be a caterpillar. Either that or there are two Flower Kingdoms, with one of them being in Sarasaland and the kingdom that Daisy rules over. I’d say that the latter is the most likely answer, so I’ll always believe it! Anyway, I’m so hyped for this game’s release date, as well as the remake of Super Mario RPG, the Switch port of Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon and especially the new game starring Princess Peach! I also really hope that Nintendo will someday make New Super Mario Bros. 3, a remake of and a sequel to Super Princess Peach, remakes of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 and Super Mario Galaxy 3! I came up with some totally sweet ideas for them, and I hope that all of you and Nintendo will love them all just as much as I do! I just can’t wait for Super Mario Bros. Wonder to be released! Yay! 🌼🐛👸🏻🧚🏻‍♀️🧜🏻‍♀️🧞‍♀️💝💖💗💕🌹💐🌷🌸🌺🎀🩰🐱🦄🍰🧁🍩
Next fig i here about Mario wonder it better have a dates for a demo coming before it actually releases cuz I need my hands on this game  N O W
Looks amazing im pre order !
Idk why but i really dont like the artstyle i much prefer the odyssey/ mario galaxy/ mario bros wii artstyle
I know this is a nothing thing, but I'm so glad they finally switched back to a more NES sounding jump sound effect, instead of sticking with the 'soft' SNES jump sound they've been using for forever
Honestly this is crazy. I followed Nintendo throughout the ages, and there where few games that where crazy inspirational. Among them was Super Mario 3 on NES with its crazy inventive world map that got copied by many games and diverse levels. Or Mario 64 the first 3D one. Every Mario game after was just "more of the same" in many cases, which is despite very good and fun not ground breaking. But this is. I am curious as to how wacky a level gets when you grab a Wonder Flower! This makes me hyped for a Mario game once more, the last one I beat was Mario 64.
Looks average
Ok so the Bubble Flower is broken

One of the greatest things is what I did NOT see... a level timer.
I can’t tell if they’re saying there is no online multiplayer or not, probably gonna need a rewatch. But I’m glad there’s not a koopaling in sight
Can’t believe Mario Wonder is only the 2nd type of Strand Game. Well done Kojima-san!
I’m so excited! I’m 42. But I feel like a little kid. Me so happy.  My sons going to love this too.
8:29 whoever came up with this effect deserves a raise, that’s so clever and cool!
Makes me want to buy a Nintendo Switch.
I am so thrilled about super Mario bros wonder it's going to be the best game ever
11:41  They copied the parry thing from CUPHEAD, I “wonder” if they played it…
i smoke wonder flower everyday
I want to ask if yoshi can use Badges?
Almost reminds me of Paper Mario
Not sure how I feel about the flower. I get why it's there, but it's a bit jarring too. Doesn't seem to fit. Those ENEMY ANIMATIONS ARE AMAZING THOUGH! And really cute too.
SO NOT WATCHING! I want NOTHING blown for me. NOOO Spoilers!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰this is gonna be awesome
So basically like  Cuphead because when you revive another player you had to jump at their ghost
I’ll bet game freak would use generation 11 or 12 as their own equivalent to this game
Awesome cant whait❤
The pain in Yoshi’s eyes carrying Elephant Mario 😭
Am i going to be the only one playing new super Mario Bros when this game releases
Woah, this game is gonna be AMAZING!  Question: if you touched the wonder flower, what do you think would happen?
Man Yoshi can lift
Princess Peach is like, “thank god I’m no longer getting kidnapped” 😂😅
Remind me when Nathaniel Bandy makes a video beating Mario Wonder while always invisible. 😂
Hopefully the Nintendo's next gen console can handle those framedrops
am i the only one who thinks they could’ve done way better? these are just spin offs of the original world themes, nothing is very new. pretty lame if you ask me
For years of having his castle, bowser IS a castle
looks awesome. cant wait to play this
Online looks like a fun thing, along with the elephant power up and drill power up.  🎉
Please drop another Mario baseball game, sincerely someone who only plays smash bros on their switch.
what can you ride around the course again? [eye emoji]

~What happened to the old c lassic super mario 3 and mario world, it was basic yet fun, now look at the crazy mess this genre has become lol.
zzzzz...
Why do I have the feeling that we're going to battle against an elephant Bowser in the final boss?  WHY DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC??
Mario Gacha on switch with standee? lol
How many times hsa bowser attacked the mushroom Kingdom and Mario and Luigi try to save it all over again now? I lost count lol, what is this physical game or digital only? One day Mario will be VR and you will be jumping about with white gloves.
Shut up and take my money
welp I know what I'm getting for my birthday
I’m so hyped for this game
this guy is literally filtering out comments by newest and responding negatively to everyone because he is desperate for attention you can literally see it in his channels content too
I am so freaking excited for this!!!!!!!!!
justice for wart and subcon
Everything about this game is just magnificent. Just like Galaxy, there are just so many new ideas that change the way we know Mario.
Hope they bring back star battles
i wish zelda would get the love mario gets
OMG!!!! FINALLY DAISY!!!! I LOVE HER SHE'S SO CUUUUUTE!!!! I'm buying this game just for playin' as Daisy 🌼
Badges?! You collect Badges? We don't need no stinkin; badges!
Just imagine Mario Maker 3 with these new mechanics and features.
Big W
I think it would be great if the bubble power up could trap the enemy instead of killing it, and once you pop it (like jumping on it), they will die
This definitely has a new feel to it
Animal Crossing news?? PLEEAASSEE!!!!!😢
IM SO excited
I wonder where wario is?
Is that Smooth McGroove in the soundtrack? It sounds just like him.
11:54 🤨
i was kinda hoping for the return of the cat bell
Can more than one yoshi ride onto another yoshi?
That's the Future of Super Mario
I do not even like mario, I just like nintendo, the only this I want to say is this game is a fever dream
I like how the Wonder Flower is basically an acid tab
I hope that flower isn’t too talkative.
how its gonna be called the next  super mario maker  super mario maker 3 or super mario maker 3D
Too bad Nintendo is a horrible company.
Am sad we didn't get lighting Mario or tornado. But I can't wait to play!
ok but the kirby sound effects???
This game will be a testicle twisting good time
This game looks really great, the badges are a great idea to include.   I just wish the villains were somebody new or another familiar villain like Tatanga or Fawful. Bowser is played out Nintendo. 🫤  Also, the bubble mechanic should just straight up lock the enemies in until you pop them and they turn into food... ala Bubble Bobble.  I'll pick up the game when it is on discount... shouldn't be full price. 😑
I always forget these are made for kids...not the old kids that are now adults. Take away the gymic abilities and the story itself is weak asf again😑😐.
I hope the charging chuck and other types of them make a come back because this gives me a super Mario world vibe.
7:30 Daisy’s “wowie zowie” is so fun she is so great
i dont know...but something about this just makes me happy :)
Hi I’m 3:57
I LOVE how this game looks amazing! I've re wached this direct so many times. This is 100% going to be my favorite mario game yet.
If we have things like the badges, this game better be hard
6:01 Toad….
Love the new Mario look! But we wish all these switch systems came with the games they’re themed around.
Dont own a switch but good job Nintendo this new Super Mario Bros looks fun and I think Nintendo fans are going to enjoy playing it
This looks AWESOME!!!
peach elephant, thats just a disgrace
I can hear jack black voice saying I got flower power!!!
15:05 lol thanks.
Mario wonder and Spider-Man 2 come out on same day 😭
Epic
phil
Glad to see Nintendo taking Mario back to his roots - drug-induced, hallucinogenic adventures
I love that there are a variety of characters to play with can't wait
Law-key-tu?! That’s how you say Lakitu?!
Wait the melon piranah plant made remember about yoshis wooly world jk how could i forget about one of the best  games and oh god i was gonna use daisy but after she transformed in to a elephant im gonna pick yellow toad or try my best to not use that ability
Can't wait for the speedrunners to finish the game in 0.2 seconds
Internet Explorer Windows Windows Windows Windows Windows Windows OS Mac Windows Linux OS Windows OS Mac Windows Windows Windows Linux Windows Linux OS Windows OS Windows Linux OS Windows Windows Linux
the music is gonna be the highlight for me… a katamari sound
Its just too much information on only one game
This is probably gonna be Nintendo’s best game of 2023-2024
Also yoshi riding yoshi seems weird. Edit: idc I pre-ordered it
Make it available for PC
I want things to go back to the bean bean kingdom.
The elephant on yoshi lost me 😂😂
You guys are getting me hyped. I'm still hoping for some other power ups too. But the ones we have are still cool!(I'm used to having like 10 though)
The game looks awesome and I'm super excited to play it. I wish the characters had different attributes though (like Super Mario Bros 2). It's kind of a bummer that they'll all play the same except for the Yoshi's and Nabbit (which are easy mode characters which ruin them for players who don't want the handicap). That's the only thing that's bumming me out about the game. Still looks like a lot of fun and I love the badge system, just wish characters were unique and Yoshi's weren't just an easy mode character
Wonder sounds like an awesome game but I really don't like the new ascetic of the game
Course selection is fantastic for those who like to do speed runs. I kind of was wishing for a Mario game with the aesthetics of Bowser Fury. But this looks like a 10/10, Mario new design looks adorable.
This is gonna surpass every mario game even Super Mario world Odyssey SM64 even more!!!!
0:47 I always knew Bowser was a metalhead
i love the perspective change, thats really cool
TAKE MY MONEY
my ONLY criticism is that peach should have grey skin as an elephant, its kinda creepy left the way it is
100% passed my expectations. Literally everything I wanted plus more
hi i have a game suggestion but cant reach out. "Capitan Claw"
YAY BLUE TOAD IS BACK
we waited 6 years for oddysey 2 and you give us a new super mario bros wii rom hack. my disappointment is immeasurable
Looks good, but Nintendo keeps failing at local co-op. They need to start doing split screen again.
Hotspot!
I am not into 2 players, I like to play with myself instead of others.
Ready for a Mario Maker 3 ? ;)
Looks phenomenal—and my girl Daisy is there, that’s enough to make it a day 1 purchase for me 😊
I love that the art design reminds me of the yoshi games
I hope Rosalina is in as a secret character again…and Paulette.
Yoshi truly is the MVP for being able to be ridden by an Elephant and riding other Yoshi’s.
I love the Nabbit and Yoshi characters, so my 5 year old can play along without dying 😅 He even wants to be Nabbit for Halloween
It only took over 10 years …
Words can not describe how beautiful this Mario wonder direct is! Can wait to play it!
Zzzzzzzzzzzz
When does it come out?
Mario can take acid now this is great!
I know this game would probably be 60 bucks but please can there be discounts on these games
Nintendo aren’t really ready to make games like this until a brand new console is released, the switch is plain, no excitement to it, people buy it because of handheld mode 3ds/ Wii U had way more personality than the switch
Nice video 👍
Do I hear smooth Mc groove???????
Please be able to grab
SONIC ERES TU 3:25
the ghost mechanic is really cool, I’m pleasantly surprised
I love speech in a mario game, please give every character a voice. There is just no reason to have silent characters.
Somehow the water levels look like tons of fun Can't wait for Nathaniel Bandy's triggered, mind blowing and all coins vids, and Nicobbq's no coins videos 10:33 Never thought they'd bring an aspect of Super Mario Run to this game but then again the name says what we all are doing till the arrival of this game, wonder what is inside the gameplay of Super Mario Bros. Wonder. I'm really curious to see this game's version of The Perfect Run, Special 8-Crown, 8-Airship, Champion's Road, Darker Side, C-3, etc.
Bro someone at Nintendo thought of something that needed the New Super Mario Brothers franchise: Replayability. And that’s how the badges where created.
It looks to play like Super Mario Bros 3 + Super Mario World with a touch of Yoshi's Island!  Can't complain about that!  I couldn't finish the video though, the guy's target market seems to be 4 year olds.
thats one intresting mario game
THE CO OP PLAY ✨😭
It's gonna to be the best game made ever.......
i don't want it, i need it!!!
I wish yoshi wasn't restricted to baby mode
Stop blowing smoke up Nintendo’s rear ends. This new voice actor SUCKS. Either bring back Martinet or give Mario no voice like in Super Mario World. This game has a chance to be something great but this voice part is bugging me!
was expecting bowser to transform to hotter version than his bowsette form, Now he's just a fart machine, sadge.
This game is the Mario version of the Great Calamity & Upheaval lol. Complete with Malice & everything!!
Looks amazing, full of so much charm, creativity and fun. Bravo Nintendo 👏
Super Mario bros WEED    Seriously this game seems… funky.
You this looks like the modern sequel to super Mario world we deserve.
Mario saying “Wonderful!” at 8:59 is wonderful
The graphics are so beautiful but it looks so lifeless..😢
Daisy's return to a mainline Mario game since Super Mario Land on the Gameboy.
Amazing new features 🧡
i love this Direct! Now i dont have to play the game anymore
No time limits yay!! No having to rush with friends
ADD MARIO BROS WONDER TO MARIO MAKER 2
do i hear SmoothMCGroove in the background? :D
This is Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World all in one
This looks like a great game for 5 year olds
This could honestly be game of the year when it comes out
Will this game be physical
Let super Mario Logan use the plushies
Genuinely super excited for this, cant wait to see speedruns with the whip badge.
:O
Everyone at Nintendo is smoking pounds of weed daily.
This is going to be so amazing I can’t wait!
This looks so amazing, creative and unique! I’m looking forward to playing this game when it comes out!
Different color wonder flowers do different things
Mario forgot to watch the super mario bros super show 💀
It looks like a reskin with added features
And then he turned himself into a castle! Funniest thing I've ever seen!
Only thing I as for is an option to have   • Players Collide  • Separate Lives   Besides that it’s perfect.
Nintendo please make a sequel to super Mario odyessey or else I’m sueing you
Sonic Colors for Nintendo DS got the remake and now Mario game?
I always said after Mario maker, the next 2d Mario has to be revolutionary in some way. I think you guys nailed it, I'm looking forward to this one
From what I've heard the game's difficulty is going to be very challenging. So it's nice to have an easy mode with the Yoshis and Nabbit to still make it more accessable.
I'm not buying it, the trailers didn't convince me, look another boring 2D mario game.
Looks amazing ill buy this instead of starfield
I'm not sure about the talking fire, they sound annoying and super unnecessary
This Mario game looks interesting. If its available offline, I will get it a chance, I'm a sucker for Mario and the Zelda titles.
Wow I want this game so bad
I like the power-ups will there be other animals like a cheetah,giraffe etc and will there be the cat power-up
It makes no sense that the Yoshis and Nabbit take no damage. We do not want Mario games for beginners! Major criticism!
When bowser turned into the castle the music was straight up bowser’s fury!
12:00 That seems like its going to be fun. Also Yoshi looks like he's struggling there..
Nabbit is back!
My first thought after seeing the Vine ability: "Spider-Toad, Spider-Toad. Does whatever Spiderman does."
I’m so glad Princess Daisy is finally a playable character in a mainline Mario title. 👑🧡 The kid in me is so excited about this release. There’s a lot of creativity and originality on display, and it’s a well-overdue breath of fresh air in the franchise. There’s nothing better than kicking off the autumn season with a new side-scrolling Super Mario adventure. 🍁🍂🍄🥰
So we not going to talk about wonder flower ( marijuana) lol😂😂😂😂😂
Somehow… even you’ve think they’ve done everything there is to do in a Super Mario side scroller— Nintendo always finds away to make them even better. This game is that.
Best Direct Ever My Favorite Thanks Nintendo
WOW WOW WOW take my money
The elephant riding yoshi 😭
SOLD!
Flower sounds like Goku, didn't expect that
Nintendo you told us that Charles won’t voice Mario or Luigi. Will you play Mario games where Charles voice Mario,Luigi,Wario and waluigi
So...anyone know where I can buy some wonder flowers?
condart: Hispanic bird, I repeat Hispanic bird
Yoshi is better than Nabbit and is way easier to play with him, (heh, he ate Boopkins spike ball).
This game looks great but I wish the playable Yoshi weren't relegated to Easy mode 😔
overload fun!
It's pronounced "Lack-A-Two"
MASTERPIECE
They finally used the pink sweater, and red overalls color scheme that Luigi rocks in Smash except for the Bubble suit.
I like the feel of this where nothing makes any sense
The new jump noises are noises I don't like.
Funfact: These Talking Flowers Are Named Oshaberi.
Not going to lie, I wasn’t expecting much since it’s always cookie cutter levels. Basically just expensive DLC add on levels but the drill power up and the bubble power ups are cool. It’ll be much easier to get all the coins with only one player. And being able to swap in items is a feature I missed from the DS version so much. I’m sold.
I dont like the flowers that talk
wow
Yoshis not taking damage kinda sucks imo. I wish they were like the others, not just a cheat.
The speedruns for this are gonna be real interesting.
this is why their called SUPER Nintendo

I like koopa troopas.... need them more on levels!! they are so fun
This looks like a lot of fun!
Poplin shop? That doesn’t mean micro transactions does it??? 🤷🏼‍♂️
i can’t wait!! everything seems like so much fun, and this is perfect to play with friends and family. the art of the game is beautiful, and i love all the colors. the new nintendo switch OLED model looks pretty cool, too. the music is really funky and fun too! the new abilities look awesome!! keep up the good work, nintendo😼💪
It was my 18th birthday when this video was released.
DAISY!!!!🌼
Those power ups are way too OP needa be nurfed
This looks really good
What if Rose Town (from Super Mario RPG) is part of the flower kingdom?
I think its a bit ugly and the floor has so many „edges“ instead of looking natural. The last good Nintendo game was Odissey.
Badges: More ways to make the games easier for kids.  Online: Shadows so you can't die  Standee: a 3rd way to revive...  You might as well just remove dying from this game.
I cannot put into words how much I love this absolutely FRESH approach to a classic platform game. It would be really nice to have classic Toad back though. The blue and yellow Toads just don’t appeal to me. In the future it would be amazing for Mario to have more antagonists besides just Bowser so we could get a playable version of Bowser on a different path or storyline. Perhaps even a common enemy to unite Mario and Bowser as temporary allies or something similar to Super Mario RPG. This game looks so phenomenal though. I am absolutely excited to play as Peach and Yoshi. This is literally all I have ever wanted since I was a child. These fresh animations and styles could open an actual flood gate of inspiration for the franchise as a whole. Seriously, think about all the fun we could have in a Mario Maker 3 with access to these new animations and playable characters to give us options. Giving us an “easy mode” option while playing as Yoshi is genius, too. Playing two player with my younger family members would always get them upset and frustrated at the difficulty, and while they did enjoy Nabit in the last Mario game, they didn’t appeal to his character too much. Giving them one of the cutest and most lovable characters from the franchise will definitely appeal to them much more. I really hope we continue to see this level of creativity and freshness going forward for the Mario 2D games
0:57 hes harming the environment!     again...
Pls add more power-ups like the iceflower and cloud flower
Honestly looks incredible
Is that intended?
The drill mushroom looks like the drill from super Mario galaxy!
is this the final performance of charles martinet?
Oh my god the speedrun strats on this game are gonna be too fun to watch evolve
Incredible
Nice to hear that Lars Ulrich has joined the Mario Bros 0:47
New power ups r disappointing. They r the same power ups from other Mario games. but the badges r cool. Badges give a PM vibe. Online play seems fun enough(better than local only) & so does the enemies
this looks incredible but some of those mechanics are from other games
Wow... They can show the ending of the game at this point of spoiler level...
They put all their work into this game
I like how he said Daisy
whatttttttttttt
*1:24* NABBIT!? MY BOY CAME BACK!!!
This is why i jailbreak my switch, new free game.
Dang, looks like there's more new enemies than what TotK had. Mummy ones look fun.
I love how the game looks but I don’t like Nabbit and the Yoshis are being used as a “Easy” mode character
we used to get colorful manuals included in the box, now we have these goofy videos
I have super high hopes for this game....lets hope it doesnt flop
Wow a huge change to Mario's voice
Luigi be like if i die blue tode is gona die first 😂
Some of the badges sound like genuine powerups. Some of them sound like baby mode. And others sound like challenge mode options. Lots of appeal to all types of players.
This lowkey reminds me of guacamelee
Unfortunately, Charles Martinet stopped voicing Mario and his friends. We will never forget him.
have a good day everyone

Can you provide?   On December 6, 2026. Tokyo Creative YouTube Channel buy the company by Nintendo.   On August 22, 2027. Tokyo Creative YouTube Channel  co-partners with Samsung.   In Future of November 18 2028. Need Japanese Language Episodes.
This just looks so creative and polished I love it!!
It looks easy
I like how 11:35 - 11:40 is a Cuphead reference.
I'm so glad we finally get something fresh and brand new!! Can't wait to play the game came out, it looks like a ton of fun
🙂😇😃
“BOIING.”😂😂😂😂
People say this game is so fresh, they are blind or either are 13 years old, this is more of the same with different hat
BRO PLEASE I LOVE THIS GAME
So excited for this Game AND MY BOI BLUE TOAD IS BACKK BABY!!!!!💙💙💙
I'm sorry but is this not the same 2D Mario game repackaged lol
I wonder if the voice of that flower is the same voice of Goku. Lol
I wasnt really to excited about this game... SO GLAD I WATCHED THIS!! THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT!
I like the Bubble Bobble and Dig Dug inspired power ups.
Why are the Yoshi’s and Nabbit easy mode? Just create an easy mode so you can have the same challenge with these characters. So silly.
Blud finally put me in a game as a playable character
6:45 UM THE THINGS THAT COME FROM LAKITU EGGS ARE CALLED SPINY, NOT SPIKY!!!!!
How Is This Not A Fever Dream?
I just can’t wait😁😆
Ya know, it would’ve made more sense if Princess DAISY ruled the flower kingdom, I know she rules Sarasa land, but it would’ve been nice. Who knows, maybe Sarasa land is apart of the flower kingdom
I'm surprised that there isn’t much if any security added to these artifacts. What a bunch of idiots, they should be armed with m16s and tanks sense that flower can create so much destruction with just a touch. Nintendo should make a game where you pop koopaling and goombas with AKs and M16s. Where you go on murdering Bowsers entire bloodline and call it "Super Mario Bros. Modern Warfare" I can see the GOTY already. Nintendo, feel free to take my idea idc about royalties.
So cute!!
This is so silly and i love it im probably going to save up money for this 🤞
0:39 damn, that bowser castle theme slaps
Pokemon releases quality games every year yet everyone is ungrateful about it. Then there’s a new mediocre mario game every 5years and somehow everyone seems to love them. Gaming is dead.
I know we all made fun of the idea at first with elephant Mario and even the other characters as elephants look ridiculous   But cmon, this all looks sick, including the elephants :D
Pretty nice how they finally brought in new story characters that we haven’t seen anywhere else before. I don’t think the New bros. Series actually introduced anyone besides Nabbit.
dis looks so cool
NABBIT RETURNS
Finally, Platformers are getting experimental instead of hounding after their glory days
This is the glow up 2D Mario needed! The only thing I don’t like is that Yoshi doesn’t take damage.
5:24 11:24
This game look so fun ,
What if I.... DON'T collect the wonder seed?!
I love the announcers enthusiasm while explaining the features
This shyt look like made for phagghots 😂😂
Releasing this, pikmin 4 and totk in the same year is a crime, it is actually criminal what they are doing to me. An amazing expressive art style, the music is great, they have listened to like 90% of our gripes with previous games, the wonder segments, bringing nabbit over for the play that is accessible to younger and older audiences, badges, ONLINE and so much  more. New Super Mario Bros 2 was my first game and I played that for actual hundreds of hours. I am actually stunned by how many great Nintendo releases we have had in such a short span of time nowhere near a console release. I LOVE MAW-MAWS.
This game looks amazing! It really seems to be inspired by the immersion of super Mario world which is super cool!
Do you think any of the developers saw elephant Mario or inflated Mario and realized they may have flown too close to the sun?
4:26: BOOPKINS IS IN!!!
wow so.. inflation Mario is official huh?
seems so great but WHY DO THE FLOWERS HAVE VOICES PLEASE EW
This will change Super Mario games forever, And sonic still can't swim
This game looks trash imma be honest. Elephant power up most trash thing i've ever seen. You all want this game to be good but yall know it's gonna be easier than washing your hands.
Koopa riding is gonna be so toxic
Amazing! I love how the characters are showing their expressions in the game!❤
This is soooooo dope I can't wait to play
This game honestly looks like a $70 game 🤣
Can we turn off the talking flowers that's really the only peice of information i need to make an informed purchase.
Ah another mario game for pc port awesome
wait is it Super Mario Bros Wonder or The Super Mario Bros Wonder Game? You call it both
Law-key-twos 😑
Some of the most inventive power ups the series has ever seen
Yet another Mario game. Yawn. Pokemon is better
nintendo, wow.
I can't believe they added "Strand mechanics" to Mario, that's crazy
This looks awesome
Release a new console. This 2015 game isn't it 😂
Was it worth six years? No, it would’ve been worth it even after 20 years! This is amazing!
I'm going to get Super Mario Bros Wonder on October
To be completely honest with everyone here, this game honestly would benefit A TON from having a built-in level editor. I mean, there's a bunch of interesting enemies, blocks, stage hazards and that such to use for levels, and interesting maps, even the badge mechanic! I swear,  if this game DOESN'T get a level editor anytime soon, I'll probably be a bit saddened.
Nooo it comes out on the same day as Spider man 2 :c
Esse tipo de jogo já deu. Não tem graça, só mais do mesmo complicando as coisas deixando chato. O legal era a simplicidade, isso daí é bem sem graça.
4:26 Imma be honest Yoshi looks kinda goody when he has something in his mouth
Yessssss this is going to be fun to play 👍🏻
This game looks amazing!! It will be a ton of fun!!
rock pipe plateau?? really??? 😂😂😂😂
I’m Disappointed that the villain is still bowser
This feels like a Wario game they swapped to Mario at some point. Maybe he wasnt testing well on smash or something.
Nintendo smashing it as always! Mario games are always a must buy for me, can’t get enough
C A S T L E B O W S E R
this game is either going to be trash or a masterpiece. but with what we have seen it looks good
This might be a bold statement, but I really think we might be looking at the Odyssey of 2D Mario.
See? That's why you put a "Do not touch" sign on your Wonder Flower. All of this could have been avoided.
Not me, a grown adult, excited for a Mario game. I am only sad there is still no return of the penguin suit power up :(
I’m so ready for this
THE DESIGN IS GREAT
5:14 the koopa troopas bump their butts together x) love it
Wow this new Mario set the bar so high, I love the Dark Soul mechanic where you can see other live players!
Oh my gosh 😍 no way!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
14:48 DEVIANTART 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Yawn. Another boring Mario game. Pokemon is better
give me this game i need it like right now
Nintendo you did it again
This  is dope
Now I want to give this game a shot, it looks epic
I love how everyone says this isn't a New Super Mario Brothers game. Let's be real, it is. It always has been. It's just not going to be called that. A side scroller platformer with 6 worlds (and a possible secret world), collectable coins to add to life counter, power ups, and all ending with a fight with Bowser. I mean, it ain't no Princess Saving thing, but I mean let's be real.
Maw maws?  Eat anything?  Ripping off Splatoon.
New super fever dream
Woah! This looks like a LOT of fun!
I was... expecting more.
Ok but that song at 0:40 slaps hard
Am I the only one that considers "Wonder" to be the worst subheader in the series?
Can't wait!
Im just scared it will be easy
I think bowser should do drugs
0:40 pretty sure it's inspired by The Eye of Sauron
We can knock out baddies 😛
DAISY FINALLY BEING A PLAYABLE CHARACTER YES
The shadow co-op feature is so cool
Like the idea of this! Reminds me of Rayman Origins in a way. but here's some things I noticed:  1: The wonder Flowers seem to make you hallucinate, but just to travel where you need to. 2: The jungle and cave mixed. 3: The Elephants seem too big for Yoshi.  Still a game I want though.
Gsmeplay looks great. Honestly, while the art style looks better than the "New" super mario series I still think it looks kind of cheap and a return to a completely 2D aesthetic would have been better!
Let’s go they brought back the two toads!!!
Daisy is my spirit animal 🧡🧡🧡
Cmon, why couldn't at least one of the yoshis take damage. I like that there's an option for no damage for players who want that, but I dislike how players who want to play the game normally with damage are locked out of characters.
Bowser seems pretty happy being a castle
Who else grew up with Mario games 👇
This looks like it was made with passion, and I like that. Theres a LOT of personality in this.
My first impression of this game was mario for a younger audience
This game will probably be top 10 all-time in the mainline series
Can you provide?   Belly 80 percent full of eating meal and drinks at Restaurants and Fast Fast in Grants Pass Oregon USA with help Blue Zones, Nintendo, Ghibli Studio, Amazon, and Samsung   All place eat out to change food sizes.   In February 18, 2026
Become Luigi with the Luigi badge.
Wow, the story of this game escalated quickly.
Looks perfect
Is ther any one actually buying the new mario switch 😅
After his success in the movie, it is clear that this will be another one <3
I miss the old new super mario games 😢
so does peach and daisy still float?
where is red toad
Sonic need to take notes its so boring now smh nun new
“The Yoshis and Nabbit won’t take damage”    Well this and the fact they they can’t use almost all of the power ups made me so disappointed
Just in time too I was going to sell all my Nintendo's and get a Steamdeck....Not Really!!
What we're able to comment.
This Super Mario looks too childish honestly. I don't think the art team did a good job.
So wonder flowers make ur character high on shrooms 🤣 Okay Nintendo… 😅
This game sounds so fresh and fun!!!
Looks good but would be great if there's an option to turn off the stupid/annoying screen shake gimmick!
Remake bomberman   N64! Pleeease!!!
That's my birthday
I hope the “good” “super” prompts can be disabled. It got annoying on the trailer and it’s only 15 minutes long.
Nintendo when you update fore patches in totk please fix the tunic from botw so you can se hp in combat
This game was made with so much love. This is for sure a must have.
wah hoo
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: October 20th can’t come soon enough!
All though it looks amazing, I could really go for a SMG 3 rn, thats all im sayin
The game looks great and I’m excited for it. The only thing I would want them to add is an option to toggle if you can interact with other people in Co-op because at the moment it seems like you can’t unless they are a yoshi. I feel like in the new super Mario bros part of the fun in co-op was throwing your friend or bouncing on their head…
"Besides Mario, you can also play as..... *picks blue toad*        *L U I G I!*     idk why but that made me laugh more than it should have
Finally we get a different 2D mario game that isnt just go from A to B like this and save  Princess Peach
Honestly i just want another donkey kong country game those were so creative and challenging
Can’t wait!!!
this looks so good bro.
Bro i dont know if people are being sarcastic or genuine about the game
The blue toad elephant transformation reminds me of A.J from Diddy Kong Racing
11:57  I feel your pain Yoshi, I really do 😭
All my son wants is a Mario maker 3 now
That little flower sounds like Sonic…👀
Mario ate way too many mushrooms this time around
this is like actually original for the first time since mario bros wii or ds
This game is going to be fire, I was not expecting it to be this good. We'll see, but it might become the best 2d Mario
Only Nintendo out here can be this creative this consistently
It will be a REALLY good game.
This game reminds me so much of rayman legends and I love that. And I love how each world has multiple biomes in it rather than making a specific world for each one. Super excited for this game
THE FIRST STRAND TYPE MARIO GAME
no ice flower = not cool game
Instant buy
Game looks great! I just wish online play was the same as local play with friends.
Mario Stranding: Koopa’s Dogma confirmed. So many ways to help other players and contribute to asynchronous multiplayer. These innovations rock. The Badge system acting as a Perks or DnD Feat style system to customize gameplay is genius. All with the charming Mario levels of creativity and polish. Great job Mario dev team!
I can see them add another character at the end like in 3d world
The only thing I don't like is that Yoshi and Nabbit are essentially easy mode
This is a great game all around but personally I don’t see the point on online if there’s no mini games outside of levels
This is proof that mario maker 3 is not happening. Like what the heck is happening half the time
This seems like it's going to be the Legend Arceus of Mario games.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh this is so GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!
So many spoilers
OMG I am falling in love with this game. Almost want to pre-order it. Really happy that the time limit is gone, so you can really explore the level for secrets or play through it meticulously
Nintendo has to get rid of that narrator he is so obnoxious let the game speak for itself nintendo
I hope it's long as 3d world
they finally changed up the gameplay of the NSMB formula
This is something I never seen before on a 2D Mario Game, 15 minutes of pure gold stuff, online mode ufff looks so good without being putting off people who don't like online modes. I wish only Nintendo had trophies/achievements like playstation to show and share with friends what trophies games I have platinumed or 100%, trophy hunting is a community that we're serious about and makes gaming even more special. I hope one day Nintendo does this with trophies, I will definitely play more Nintendo when this happens
well, at least for once Mario doesn't have to save Peach 😅
never have I been more hype for a Mario game
Mario touches a flower: can throw a bubble.  Bowser touches a flower: CAN BEN REALITY AS HE SEES FIT  😑 because ofCOURSE the bad guy gets cooler powers
My 5 y/o is going to love this game. Who am I kidding, I will too!
Hate that Yoshi is essentially easy mode, would've loved to play as him normally. Game looks awesome otherwise though
When is this game coming to play
This is pretty much a 2D Mario game that plays like a 3D Mario game because you don’t have the timer and there’s a big ask to find a lot of Wonder Seeds and Flower Coins.
Idk if i missed it but i hope there’s an online “version” of the local play multiplayer gameplay, bc i dont just wanna see the real time ghost things of my friends, id want to interact with them while playing levels
Resolutely oppose Japan's discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the ocean
This actually looks insanely fun! I had my doubts at first but after watching this I’m very excited to experience all the new functions in game and see how they’re implemented!! Also, my mom usually doesn’t play games with the rest of us but because of the characters that don’t take damage that will make it easier for her. I love how innovative this one is compared to the previous 2d Mario games I grew up with :)
I can’t wait to play this!!!!
Super Mario Acid Trip
First time I've been as excited for a 2D Mario game as for a 3D Mario game.  Also, anyone who claims SMB Wonder looks like a mobile game has exactly ZERO idea about stylization. Any visual artwork can use strong stylization, that just means it doesn't look like anything else on the market. Ever seen the Spider-Verse movies?  Many mobile games, especially adaptations of console or PC games, use strong stylization to mask the lack of detail due to the weak graphics processors of cell phones. SMB Wonder, on the other hand, makes a deliberate decision to use a surrealistic style and has tremendous detail work in every animation, e.g. the facial expressions, smearframes, model deformations, etc. The comic book-like special effects are just as intentional.  Anyone who doesn't like this style seems to want the vanilla standard graphics of the NSMB games back, after complaining that 2D Mario games never try anything new.
Badges making a comeback, man you making me want more Paper Mario Nintendo!
Can’t wait to play this! It looks super fun!
At first I thought the physics were all wack, but then I realized they just weren't running in any of the earlier gameplay clips
Mario's been fighting browser for over 40 years. Can we get another villian?
This just might be the best 2D Mario game ever made.
I can see this is a strand type game
8:06 I see u took magic mushrooms to a new level
I hope they do a new donkey Kong country and yoshi island game in this style also. This is the kinda art style game we have dreamed about when we were little getting 2 or 3 frames of animation.
Being able to pick a course in any order is great, I have a feeling speedruns will be legendary because of that
Like
no rosalina im so sad
Looks samey and boring
I really hope a speedrunning community will form with this game, it’s just impossible for it to NOT happen!!
This is going to be my first Mario game since Mario 64 on the N64, and I'm really stoked for it!
Yayyy Todette I’m gonna play as her! Since they didn’t add Rosalina .... 😢
Bowser is at it again
Raramente um jogo é tão irresistível quanto Super Mario Bros Wonder.  Só esse jogo já vale a compra de um Nintendo Switch ❤
Have you played Atari today?   Atari just released a console that plays all of their games in one console. Made by Atari!!  So Nintendo, when can we expect yours?   Let's put an end to all these crazy up sellers.  You already admitted that the 35+ age group are your least important players. Funny but ok. Will wait for you version. 👍
So is OLED the next console then?  This game looks fun too!  Giving me 3D Land and World vibes as far as the format goes.
Same formula for over 40yrs. Wow
Gonna wait and see if someone will pirate a early release copy of this and leak it. 😎👌
Hey nintendo I heard people have been making jokes about the new elephant powerup
4:07 I just hope that Sonic Superstars have even Mighty, Ray and the Classic Chaotix (since Mario Wonder and even Crash Team Rumble will have more characters than Sonic)  And yes, not only Sonic Superstars have 4 characters like Disney Illusion Island, it should have mighty, ray and the chaotix.
Go Bubbles 🫧
0:45 >Toadette was about to fall over and Daisy caught her and helped her regain her balance. OMFG ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT WAS SO CUTE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT THAT IN THERE BUT THEY DID IT FOR US I LOVE IT SO MUCH!
We're never going to get a Super Mario Galaxy 3, are we? I don't understand how that's possible... Galaxy 2 was one of the most entertaining and absolutely amazing titles released for the Wii, and in my opinion still the best Mario game that has came out since.  It's an absolute travesty that there is no push to make a 3rd game..  I might as well put the chances of ever getting a 3rd Galaxy right next to the almost completely deceased hopes of ever seeing Donkey Kong get a new original title.   I'm just sitting here wondering why I even bought a  new OLED Switch considering it was used for Tears of the Kingdom, other than that its been a giant paper weight that collects dust. All while I see completely inferior series such as Pikmin, Splatoon and Xenoblade Chronicles continue to get sequel after sequel.
I dislike the face they are coming out with another mario edition oled switch.  Like do a Yoshi other than green or a toad even better the wonder game theme.
I love this already
Do they all say Wowwie zowwie
Super Mario world vives here. 🎉
E X E L E N T
Did Bowser's soundtrack raise anyone's devil horn's up in the air? 🤘
Lah-key-twos
Could you have imagined if it was Waluigi who was the main villain of this game? A wacky new game needs an even wackier new villain!
Feels like the successor to SMB3
When will that a hole bowser give it up?
Wither storm vibes 0:51
DevientArt will have some fun with that balloon wonder.
Little buddy mode
Negs any sonic game
Omg I am so beyond excited for this! Im so late to the Switch party! But omg Ive had so much with New Horizons & Links Awakening! If anyone is selling any titles let me know 😊!
HOOWW!??? how can Nintendo Re-invent Mario every time?? It just keeps getting better and better... amazing!
This feels like "New Super Mario Bros." if given the "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish" treatment.
You can play as multiple characters, but they all play the same, and you can’t even pick bowser? I’m really not impressed at all. Lazy game. Just remake Paper Mario 1 and 2, thanks
This looks awesome.
This is so nice I have to buy it when it comes out🔥
i hate mario
So... Super Mario Brothers 2, got it 👎
I..da…wha…….I ju…… WHA?!?! THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST MARIO GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
All I see here is a potentially new theme for the next Mario Maker game.
Thank you Charles martinet
It Was At At This Moment The Paratroopa Knew, It Screwed up.
Wow this game looks really fun so many fresh new abilities!😄🍄
12:30 mario’s first strand game
this looks great, the badges are so cool!
This series should be an inspiration to other titles out there.
I love how happy Bowser is to turn into a giant fortress. Most people would be having an existential breakdown, but this dude's like "Yes, this is exactly what I wanted to happen"
no wat he said lockey toos
Super Mario Junkie
A badge that makes you Sonic. Lovely
This looks like it's not challenging at all
Best Mario ever
But I didn't expect him to become Castle directly. This would make for an interesting final boss.
If you haven't seen the Mario movie yet ....Go see it!
Has anyone else noticed that in each course, there's no time limit, unlike every other mainline mario game?!
That's really good, i love this.
I’ve watched this video 7 times. And I’m about to make it eight.
The Maw-Maws are so cute!
The Mushrooms finally got to Mario
This looks astounding
The way he pronounces Lakitu 💀
My Goodness! What a glorious game! Would love to see a Mega Man game that looks and plays like this, the world is so alive and vivid, AMAZING! 😮
mario Dk fusion
This is so great. OST sounds amazing, but I especially love the forest track at around 2:37. It's sounds so enigmatic and magical. Love it.
You convienced me, it looks like an instant classic.
can we get a Wario villian plss
Gosh I hope we can still ride Yoshi in 1 player mode.😥
mario maker 3 looking promising with this game type. theres so much more to do with it.
is that smooth mcgroove for some of the music
The FIRST thing I thought when I saw the online features was "Man, I don't think Bowsers ready for an entire ARMY of gamers storming his castle (or I guess storming HIM would be more accurate) handing out free revives to each other like candy."
Im glad yoshi and nabbit has made a return
Why is this game allowed original characters and themes whereas paper Mario has to stick to the same boring characters with no personality?
How many times are we gonna have to teach this turtle this lesson?
They did so many changes 👌 I love Mario games I already pre ordered it 😊 add me y’all let’s play
I wish it was like SM3DW where they had their own special abilities but this is cool too.
12:56 guys it’s Lizzo
This game looks so beautiful god damn
I think its time to get a switch
I'm I the only one who thought he pronounced Lakitu weird.
The wonder is literally an acid trip thats amazing
So we’re getting a Mario maker of this, right?
Why is ´Twilight Princess HD´ written in the third timestamp?
It seems like a way to collect a wonder seed is to activate the wonder flower right?
Piola
this gives me Super Mario Bros. 3 vibes, looks like they got back to Mario's roots, I was getting so bored with the NSMB aesthetic and gameplay
It’s crazy how Nintendo’s not only combining a bunch of concepts from other games, but still are managing to make new ones.
13:10 im boutta have 0
Although it looks great I am slightly caused that it will be easy.
How did they get from 4 options for characters to 12 options for characters? 😅
This is game is gonna be incredible
Anyone else notice the GLITCH at 14:23?
Can't wait for the Summoning Salt World record history !
Don't like how yoshi doesn't take damage... kinda ruins the character selection
11:33 wait what cuphead?
Why did they make the flower fruity?
6:18 pokèball
I'm so excited to see if there will still be a star or not
I wish they would make a new game with the same art style of Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. That hand-drawn crayon look. Much more magical than the current computer-generated visuals.
6:56 for the people who don't realize... Super mario Galaxy memories :(
6:05 they fr tried their best to not make it look like ms piggy.
A new 2D Mario game bursting with creativity? I thought I’d never see the day.
I love all Mega Man references: Badges are like Mega Man Zero Skills The Bubble Flower is like Mega Man 7 Burst Man shot. Grappling Vine is like Mega Man Zero 2 Chain Rod. 10:40 this power is like Mega Man X Wall Jump (maybe).  This is really a good job.
They made a lil bro mode with the yoshis
I was initially bummed out that the yoshis are easy mode characters, but considering that they’re the only ones who take knockback from damage, some situations might actually be more dangerous for them than the rest of the cast.
VOICEEEEEE ACTINGGGGGGGGGGG LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Speedruns of this game are going to be INSANE. Well done, Nintendo.
wait.. NABIT IS IN THE GAME!?
Se tiver pt Br eu jogo
Most excited I've been for a 2D Mario in a loooong time
Man, this is gonna be the best 2d Mario game ever!
im hopeing the game tracks what levels you use a certain badge with, cuz i plan on beating every level with every badge when i get my hands on the game!
When will it release?
I can't wait to play this 😩 but I'm working like 12 days straight😢
It seems a perfect 2D mario game 🎉!!
this game feels like a fever dream
Looks great for the 2D lovers but think I got over this format in the 00s
the new jumping sound effect feels weird
The only thing I’m thinking about: “Mario Maker 3 is going to go craaazzy”
the goomba transform is a reference to super mario odyssey
This game looks really fun. They better have a way to turn off the talking flower voice
sonic superstars is better than this mostalgia relient trash
My only issue is that we are all going to be so sick of those talking flowers by world 3
This looks fun
What a great year for Nintendo. This looks like a big improvement from the new super Mario games.
oh and also can you bring back when we can hold people and throw  them
Love this new mario
14:30 Captain Toad
8:59 Mario: ”Wonderful!”
I love it! Might disable qudio dialog though. (If you can)
While I know Nintendo won't condone what I am about to say next... I'm gonna play this on an OLED, HIGH AS A KITE! The new Wonder powers are trippy.
we want tomodachi life😔😔😔
For over 30 years, Mario has been dominating the 2D platformer space. There's no 2D platformer that can even come close.
3:37 “WONDER if you can get over there” Loving the puns Nintendo keep it up 😂
Was not expecting this to be a strand-type game
This is Game Mechanics: The Game and I love it
7:23
Please release a mobile port of super mario bros wonder game
Mario Wonder is a strand game
WOW I LOVE THAT THERE ARE LIVE PLAYER SHADOWS! THATS SM FUN 😍
cannot wait for release!
Smooth McGrooved it!
It really looks wonderful and I'm getting it day1 but there's very noticeable performance problems. Switch 2 must arrive in 2024.
Multiplayer would be great but we can barely see the "shadows" 🙄
Now that's a wowie zowie!
This one is definitely worth getting 🤩
That elephant peach us cursed
why isnt the a button jump?????
So the whole point of the game is to stop Bowser who becomes MODOK
Yes please
The grappling badge about to be a game changer
Can't wait for the next game to have the star kingdom and then The special kingdom
Switch last 2 major hit... fall 2024 switch successor
Should update hardware also
Can i play it on switch lite
This looks incredible ❤
I HOPE they've changed when you lose a life it doesn't bring u back out of the level. Super mario deluxe is such a good game but why bring you out the level? Why not just start from the beginning?
It's like you combined a little bit of Super Mario RPG and a lot of 8-bit Mario side-scrolling particularly Super Mario Brothers world like for the Super Nintendo still got that game and my Super Nintendo
12:46 Mario Wonder is a Strand game? Kojima was right!
What if one of the talking flowers (or “floweys” as I like to call them) was a secret unlockable character at the end of the game? That would be pretty funny, cause then we’d have a REAL Fire Flower lol
. M
Grapple hook badge is OP.
ah, the mario game in which herb is the main selling point
The switch needs an achievment system so bad, bring back stickers from wii sports resort atleast
Nintendo really outdid themselves with this one.
Deviantart is gonna have a field day with this
Mario tycoon
Now i hope just they add this mode to SMM2
I'm glad we can turn the flower's voice off, would get annoying fast.
I was actually worried about this game but damn they did a (wonderful) job with this I’m surprised…see what I did there (Wonder)ful🤣🤣🤣
Woshi, its a double yoshi exploshi
Shut up and take my money
Wonderful!!!
I love elephant peach, elephant daisy, elephant toad and elephant toadette they are so cute as fat elephants. I would love it if the playable characters got more adorable animal transformations
We need dog transformations and cute chubby mouse forms for the mario characters along with other cute chubby animal transformations in Super Mario Bros Wonder
Please dont make me play this game alone add online multilayer
Beautiful game! The new Mario themed OLED is also 🔥This gives me an idea that a Switch 2 is NOT yet in sight for the near future but I'm happier with all this right now!
Prince Florian my beloved
so cute how goombas sleep or walk in this game, Melon piranhas, a delisous touch, lots of old enimies came back in this game, heck even kamek, please make a boss battle for him🥺🥺🥺
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS ! THIS LOOKS AAMAZING
슈퍼마리오게임 유튜버로서 진심 구매해서 꼭 영상 찍고 싶네요
so many innovative things .. i should have work with nintendo !!!
I MISSED NABBIT SO MUCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yoshi on a Yoshi on a Yoshi in a Yoshi 😮
Just take my money
Mordor
I hope there’s a way to add the old multiplayer mechanics
Wonderful
It’s basically yoshis woolly world mixed with Mario u
I love how they took Super Mario World style and made it even better!
MARIO IS NOW A STRAND TYPE GAME
I didn't want to watch this at first, because I wanted to be surprised but I couldn't take my eyes off it😃
I can't afford a Switch (Sadly) but man, Super Mario Bros Wonder still has me feeling excited for it. It's colorful, creative and it looks like so much fun! Not to mention the new voices for Mario and Luigi sound great too.
I guess OG Toad is dead.
i really hope this game sells really good so itll tell nintendo that making more creative games are worth the effort!
First time hearing 13:35  What ?
it's hard being 47  and having played Super Mario Bros on the NES at launch and Super Mario World at launch on the SNES and seeing this as I still regularly play my SNES on a crt tv and love it, I'm sure it will be a great game but I wish Nintendo would use pixel art for 2d Mario games. This art style looks so much like an iPad game it makes me want to fire up Super Mario World on my crt instead.
Feel like this is a short game
Nice
Ngl being a Nintendo fan from nes is fun sometimes weird stuff happens but that's acceptable
Nintendo, I love you!
Very hyped for this game.  I can play as Daisy & Yoshi🥹
Bad trip
I love nabbit
boring.
this looks fantastic! i can not wait to play as soap mario
I'm really fond of the badge system. It adds a refreshing twist to the gameplay without introducing an excessive array of abilities that might overwhelm the player.
Masterpiece
Excited!
Original Mario: Bowser hides in Castle Mario Galaxy: Bowser steals Castle Super Mario Wonder: Bowser becomes Castle
Disappointing that the characters all play the same and that if you want to play and yoshi or the little rabbit you are stuck in easy mode with no damage from enemies. They could have just had that be a setting to switch on or off rather than have it delegated to specific characters. Not a very smart choice.
NEARBY MOULAH
This was an excellent presentation. I really like the cool extra features like the new power ups and how you can play as any character you like compare to any other Mario game. The multiplayer features are also amazing. I can’t wait to see what adventures this game has to bring.
9:04 - beautiful music
12:30 ....Okay thats cute and everything but then WHY NOT JUST LET US PLAY CO-OP ONLINE THEN???? And yes online play with friends stuff is fun but why not just make it the same as local co-op bit online instead of having them as shadows??? I do not understand why nintendo do this to themselves? To be clear, I think the rest of the game looks great but I don't know why Nintendo avoids standard online multiplayer like this and insists on being oh so quirky and different in a way that is annoying.
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They missed the badge to double jump
Imagine another tubular level 😰
Omg is mario!!! 1:42
It would be cool if each character had there own ablities ala Mario 2.
“Mario Takes Shrooms,” the game (2023)
The bubble ability seems very reminiscent of Bubble Bobble.
Im so excited
I can't wait
This is like the anti-Super Mario Maker. They made it so accessible. Disappointed.
Looks boring in my opinion but I'm sure it will sell millions on the first day.
they are a tad bit too expressive for me, but I am sure my younger cousins will love it. it is good to see that nintendo has done a great job again. also interesting fact that the flower kingdom legalized wonder flowers unlike the mushroom kingdom I guess ;)
Mario just had another paradigm shift in his design 😳😳😳
I love the randomness
I think I'm going to buy a switch just to play this. This looks incredible. I love these ideas.
Nintendo is the best videogame company their creativity is beyond any other franchise
Spoilers incoming 😢
Too bad the characters all play the same....
RISE OF THE YELLOW TOAD HE IS BACK
this looks amazing i am about to cry
Not so fond of the gay talking flower
Love all the new characters, power ups and enemies. This game really feels "NEW"
12:03
big L
Omg,can’t wait 🎉
10:24 as a french listener, i’m confused lol
Am I the only thinking it looks like any flash game on a cellphone ?
Is jack black in this one?
I used to play New Super Mario Bros to death on my DS when I was just a little lad and I hold a lot of praise for it to this day. I hope that there will be a new generation of kids who will find that kind of joy for Wonder, and gain the same nostalgia as I have 10 or so years down the line.
It all looks amazing! But just why can't we get a regular online multiplayer? 😢
Man im already tired
This is everything I’ve ever needed
I swear nintendo can’t make a bad game
This it's how you make a game: Fun.
I just noticed, princess peach didn’t get kidnapped this time, they finally changing it. 🫨
Game looks DONE!! why wait till October 20. release it now!!!
This is so 3D world
I hope there's an option to mute the talking flowers. Otherwise this game looks super fun.
I can’t wait for this game
They still can't do online co-op right...
I'm glad we don't enjoy these games for the plot. They do some of the most off-the-wall bizarre things to get the characters into their starting positions.
Jojo reference soft and wet
It's the dark souls multiplayer of mario games.
does the wonder flower put everyone on acid or smth???
Nintendo take my money
Someone cooked here
This game looks pretty good. Not into elephant mode, or the fact that the prince travels with Mario on his back. Like I said.....good, but still bows to SMB 3, and SM World......the forever champions of 2D Mario platforming.
these level designs are lookin a little too much like new super mario wii
I love how expressive everyone is. How does Nintendo continue to be so innovative? This looks incredible..
Still no achievements
12 playable characters?! Yo this has to be a 10/10 Mario game. This will be my day one purchased follow by sonic superstars.
Nice
why don't they just shoot boswer in the face?
Wow. That elephant form is funny 😂😂
As much as I love how innovative and creative Nintendo. I truly just want a BRAND NEW IP or a Legacy IP that needs to be revived in Nintendo Game archives!
they're such cutie patooties!!!
Super Mario for N64 was the best.
This looks like it could be the best 2d Mario game yet. Can't wait to play it on my Steam Deck.
Still not as exciting as SNES Super Mario World or Mario Odyssey. The map looks boring and plain, no special hidden areas, cool interactions at the end for the board that effects the map layout, or different routes to different areas on the board it looks like. Super Mario Worlds was the panicle of excitement for exploring a mario world.
Fire Daisy is so cute🧡
This is just too cool Nintendo. You took the mechanics of Mario from the Wii U, to bringing some very enw mechanics without it feeling like too much. I am always impressed how these games shift up the game mechanics while making it still feel like the Mario World.
I wasn't expecting this to look so epic. This is amazing
Yoshi stack!!!!!!
I can’t wait I’ll be someone’s Yoshi lol
6:33 I see bubble bubble!
Calling it now… the second world is the desert world
This game looks really cool for speed running. There’s so many cool and unique movement choices
Ah a proper nostalgic nod to the traditional style play weve been oh so eager for👍Cant wait to play!Now do a Legend of Zelda like this next please and thank you Nintendo!
Game looks whimsical af also the talking flowers are annoying
How could anyone literally not get this?  Nintendo always 10 steps ahead.
I'm so excited for this game!! I love the new style so much
8:59 "wtf!"
I wanted to be able to yoshi in this game.
なんかカービィっぽくなったね😢
Holy crap it's a 2d mario game with new ideas!
That showcase was really great! I love this art style! It seems extremely creative and outlandish! The enemies are also pretty cool, I like that there are so many new ones! I really like that dessert-themed level! It looks absolutely delicious! That desert world also seem pretty cool. I really like the colored blocks in those sand dunes in the background, and they're transparent too! They kind remind me of rock candy crystals. When this awesome-looking game releases, it is going to be incredible! Nintendo, thanks for developing Mario's next new adventure: Super Mario Bros Wonder! This fresh, new idea it going to get lots of praise!
I think it would be cool if you could toggle a button to make Yoshi's take damage
Mario's bizarre adventure
Wow, this looks amazing and  FUN. Wait, so speedruns will never be the same with this game?
At Nintendo live 2023 we got to play this for 15 minutes. I thought it was a fun game. My son and wife enjoyed it.
Yes this might look like a good game but pokemon is simply superior
Pokemon is better!!!
Pokemon is better
Question can nabbet get power upa to or no
day 100 of watching the Nintendo direct
I'm gonna be honest, I like this version of online play. It's very experimental and gives it a new spin. I feel like Nintendo is testing the waters for different types of multiplayer and it feels nice and cool for me. But that's just my opinion.
Mario Souls confirmed
Nice game
Mario super👍games
nintendo W
Is it me or does the chorus seems like it was made by Smooth McGroove?
“A new Nintendo Switch…  OLED Mario edition” They had us in the first half.
So basically the wonder flower is just like drugs?
I heard they’re doing a day one patch that adds a mode where you can face a camera towards yourself and start sucking on your thumb. When you do this, the game starts to play itself and you can’t possibly die and automatically get the high score
not another copy and paste mario game. they scamming yall
It's both unbelievable and beautiful to think I grew up with the OG Mario and now my kids are actually playing Mario on my NES.  Now we get this new Mario 🍄 Love it.
Oh my goodness i love that they created new characters instead of sticking with just the same stuff theyve always had. Just feels so fresh
this looks near perfect. I only wish mario could swing the two handed hammer from paper mario 64
It sounds like they got Smooth McGroove for the music, I wonder (ha) if it’s actually him
Just imagining this on my OLED. 😭
damn really been waiting it and will end it in 1 days
5:18 bro I’ve been saying it wrong this whole time?
IDK if Nintendo has a new console coming soon, but this would look SO MUCH better on newer hardware
I love this
Props to Monica 😎
Spoiler Direct lol
looking forward to playing this in Yuzu. 😉
The worst part about Elephant Peach is going to be the fetish art. 💀
This looks amazing, but please god please let us turn off the talking flower.
they went super gimmick on this one with too much abilities... thats why ima get it lol.
que buen juego crj, usen traductor pe me da hueva ponerlo en español ":v". pd: Ñ
LOVE all the new features, but really hope that there are some challenging levels and that the game doesnt end up being a cakewalk.
😮😮😮😮😮
So basically, Super Mario Bros Wonder is another one of those Strand Type games
WOOOOOOW
The 'Petal' Isles? Mario 'Wonder'. Lmfao. Nintennuendos are getting quite... Uh... more kid-friendly? 😂
Bubble Bobble called. They want their mechanics back.
None of the major game developers will ever match Nintendo's creativity. I'm amazed every time they find a new way to turn a franchise favorite into something new and interesting, whether it succeeds (Wii and Switch) or fails (Wii U and Gamecube)
This Makes Me Hyped For The Game!
I love how expressive everyone is
Looks painfully generic
All of this is way too good! I abolutley love it! My top reasons:  1: The new power-ups. I like the Bubble Flower the most. I think nintendo looked at the fangames for this one! In Super Mario World but with more power-ups, there was the Bubble Flower.  2 : The art style. ITS TOO NEW!! Like, its too good! Its fresh, and very loveable.  3 : (Not accociated) Pre-ordering this. Pre ordering this is too easy with Gold Points! Its too easy for people that dont want to spend money.\  4 : Character/Select and new ones. There are 5 NEW PLAYABLE CHARACTERS! And there are 11 total!  Thank you so much Nintendo for making this.   PS: The badges are too good! Definitly makes up for no playstyle-exlusive character types.
I cant wait for 2d mario
rule34 artists are having a field day with the elephant power up
This better not have denuvo, I don't want to lag on a great game.
5:08 He looks like a pancake with syrup,
Wow, The different effects of the wonder flowers and the badges are so cool 🙂
When the house turned into a prison I thought "What's the difference"
My only request is like the local co-op, make it online too. I don’t want to just race or see ghosts. 3D world online was really nice with friends in co-op.
This looks terrible.
Anyone who played a Super Mario game knows all characters plays different
It would be great if Nintendo also added the Zelda HD games (Twilight Princess and Wind Waker) and the 3ds games (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask) on the Nintendo Switch Console, like they did with Miitopia (3ds), Super Mario 3D Stars (N64, Gamecube and Wii), and some games of Pokemon.
10:41  Looks like a custom stage. I wonder!? Probably a special stage to earn the badge.
4:42 Melon Piranha Plants: *exist * Viridi: OMG, ANOTHER PIRANHA PLANT SPECIES!
They always deliver
I'm just waiting for the time to come so I can emulate this game
I think this might be the best mario bros. game in the series
I love it.
Finally more news
the badges idea and the new bubble form has got me PUMPED FOR THIS bc essentially the bubble form is an unofficial powerup turned official like thats so cool
Five minutes
This looks AWESOME
I wouldn’t mind knocking out baddies with my drill
This looks amazing.Can’t wait to buy it
I cannot wait! This looks very adventurous filled with hours of fun!
Amazing!. will be soon and I buy it, keep work
its always bowser
no elephant nabbit? :(
oh so u can do online play just everyone your in a room with is semi invisible how is that fun
shame itss only HD - looks really poor quality video on youtube
Ok but why the music banging tho
Ok
For a solid 60 im good
Nintendo of America make a blow hog Pikmin😂🎉😅 ❤
I already dislike the "good" "great" while bouncing on stuff
The only thing i dislike is that I can’t take damage as yoshi. I just want to have a normal play through as yoshi. Other than that a+++
Kissy checkpoint!!! Get your kissy here 💋
SUPER MARIO GALAXY+ODYSSEY 2D MAKER DELUXE WITH SOME SOUP
Better than TOTK
They just unknowingly made competitive Mario
I was totally skeptical about this game, Im pretty impressed after watching this. Some aspects of the aesthetics could be better though.
Isn’t prince florian the fiancé of princess peach from the anime move from the 80s
This looks nice and all but when is mario maker 3 being released?
“Wonder effect” yeah alright
11:55 I’m sold on this game now 😂
please release on mobile too... sobb... 😢😢😢
Dont take over the castle, become the castle
Nintendo really put a ton of effort into making this 2D game experience something unique, unfortunately for me it’s just not interesting enough but I do appreciate the effort. I know others will appreciate it as well it’s just not a game I want to play.
Dios que juegaso
This will probably be the best selling Nintendo Switch game
3:32 is that smooth mcgroove? Sounds *just* like him
Wonder if four players can play yoshi and all ride each others backs hahahaha
Oh this looks SO fun and creative! I’m already excited, can’t wait for launch!
elefant peach is so ugly . not complaining.
Finally no more of that 'New' SMB garbage.
Sold my Lite just to buy the Oled along side this game 😂 it looks great. Let's hope they dont over due this style 😅
Ok, so other Mario games can have original characters but Paper Mario can’t?
Where to get wonder flower????? 😛
I'm getting a Switch just for this. It's beautiful!
6:06 Participação especial da Joice Hasselmann
When does the sequel for Super Mario Bros on the Super Nintendo come out
14:12 Do you hear the Mario Kart 64 Toad scream?
日本語版はまだ出てないのか
I'm happy that we finally get daisy as a playable character other than mario kart and mario party.
this feels newer than all of the “new” smb games combined
Hi on my channel, I'm restoring cars after an accident. Come see how a whole car turns out from a pile of scrap metal :)
BLUE AND YELLOW TOAD>
The wonder flower looks like a drug
I don't care about co-op but this looks like a fun game.
雰囲気が マリオＵＳＡみたいでホッとしますね 買うか買わないか 悩みです(≧▽≦) NintendoSwitchが アドバンスみたいなサイズが 欲しいですよ
The sound Yoshi makes with Elephant Mario at 11:57 LOL 💀💀💀
2:28   flappy bird?
Love it
Super Mario Acid Trip  Masterpiece
LET'S FREAKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😍🔥
They can't miss with mario
No way! References, Hollow Knight & Cuphead concepts….seems like a pretty interesting game!
Definitely getting this.
10:10 ..."Spider-Toad, Spider-Toad...does whatever a Spider-Toad does..."
This is next level 2d gameplay I love it, I can’t wait to play it I have a switch
“Nice of the Prince to invite us over for a picnic ey Luigi?”
Beautiful beautiful I cried how beautiful the game is clap clap😭😭👏👏👏👏
Mario always hits hard!
So no peach in this game?
Is that Smooth McGroove in the official OST?
THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME AND FUN! I'm so excited to play it!
300 conto um jogo desse 🤦🏻‍♂️
algum br aqui?
YES YELLOW TOAD IS HERE
Dawg, can we get some new Mario Party maps?!
This will never outsell madden 24
Wow just wow
Wow
Esse jogo vai ser perfeito,nintendo já aproveita e vão trabalhando pra lançar outro Mario que já tô sentindo saudade antes mesmo de zerar kkkkkkk
EXTREMELY EXCITED for this! Thank YOU!
I’d still love to throw people off the map in local play though
I’m definitely getting this on October 20th!!
11:45 I think it's entertaining that they pointed out that Yoshi can also ride other Yoshis :p
I can feel the inspiration from so many of the spin-off and older 2D games, and I'm all for it. There's so much originality being shown here
Mario's in 2D>>>>
Prince Florian, huh? Like Florian from the newest pokemon game?
smooth mcgroove vocals?
Does anybody remember the super Mario anime movie that was released in Japan? It had the flower kingdom prince in it
0:52 this is one of the best bowser’s I’ve ever seen.
I really hope there are more power ups they are so cool
By far one of the goofiest bowsers ever created
"I wonder what goombas taste like!"  The twist is going to be crazy on those creatures when we find out that they're evil like in Undertale with flowey.
This is gonna be a 10/10 Mario game, so many new ideas
Im sorry. But really failing to see anything truly special. Im not trying to be that guy, but it looks like a 2d mario with features that should have been included years ago. Theyll charge 60 bucks for this and people will buy and talk about for a week then move on
Yay! Peach and Daisy and Toadette inflation are all canon now! ❤
quite ugly graphics
gimme dat red oled pls ty
Wowie Zowie 2: Eletric bogaloo
Date of game release
4:48 "Condarts will fly at you and stick their beaks where they don't belong!"
9:35 okay but can i use it on miiverse?
this game is almost perfect. I am honestly bothered that the yoshis are invincible. Them not powering up makes sence, they play different and have a unique way they play. But locking them behind easy mode just kills my hype for them. Please nintendo make a togable option for those who want to challange them selfs. Alot of us grew up with challenging are slefs and growing to get better. Im all for easy mode for those who want it but not when it takes a exciting part of the game and locks it behind it
Brooo!! This game looks sick! It’s like a mix of super Mario 3D world and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe! I looove it! ❤ and a NEW NINTENDO SWITCH?! Thank you Nintendo so much! 😭
Bowser's castle = Bowser is Castle
Nice, FromSoft's kind of multiplayer in Mario sounds great.
3:20 is that Mcgroove?...
I hope that mario red switch is not TOO expensive
I love the look of this game! After endless samey New SMB games, this feels like a proper evolution!
Now do Mario Galaxy 3 😈
I like the grappiling vine. Its like spider man.
Gave me Rayman Legends vibes. Wish they brought that game back as well.
The enemy(?) in the bottom right corner of 3:34 is so cute!   Edit: the enemies are called Maw -Maws.
This game looks so fun
Wow. This is awesome ❤
This is gonna be the greatest game of all time I can’t wait 😭😭
“I wonder what Goombas taste like…”  Wha-
BLUE TOAD IS REAL!!!!
That is why Nintendo not need power, good gameplay is enough
i hate that the flowers speak. i hope there is an option to turn that off
Always loved the side scrolling Mario games. Cant wait for this one.
WHY RIDING AS ELEPHANT ON YOSHI IS REAL ? WHY RIDING AS ELEPHANT ON YOSHI IS REAL  ? WHY RIDING AS ELEPHANT ON YOSHI IS REAL  ?WHY RIDING AS ELEPHANT ON YOSHI IS REAL ?

Bubble bubble
Finally, a new game that truly seems promising.
I will play this game regardless but why do they have to say wowy zowy when getting a power up.
WHAT TRASH!! NINTENDO CAN'T CREATE ANYTHING NEW!!! SAME BS FOR 30 YEARS
The talking flower is super annoying.  Hopefully we can turn that off.
My friend said he’s not getting this because he says “it’s the same as the new super Mario bros games”. I am very angry.
Only local co-op? Sighhhhhhh
Please bring back the mario and luigi RPG to nintendo switch
I can feel the DLC character packs coming. Give us Wario!!
"wonder flowers" or magic mushrooms?🤔
The live player shadows is awesome, honestly. It connects us in the right way 👌
This seems so well thought out and polished. It’s not just another NSMB game. This game is super unique and innovative for the franchise. I can’t wait for this!
Has to be said that Bowser is THE best level designer there has ever been!
"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  John 3:16
I genuinely think this might get more sales and hype than Super Mario Odyssey.
speedrunning's gonna be lit
I CANT WAIT❤😭🙏
Mario strand type game
Did no one realised the yellow yoshi pose is the pose of yoshi from mario party superstars 9😮😮😮😮
A fanmade powerup is in an official game, huh?
can a Yoshi riding a Yoshi ride a Yoshi?
I sorta wish Yoshi wasnt like Nabbit in the sense they dont take damage but I cant wait for the game 100%
Amazing, but I missed the main Toad as a playable character
As cool as this game looks, it's sad that the online feature to play with friends isn't the same as if you were playing local coop. I feel like Nintendo has heard so much bad feedback on their online services with connectivity to others that they had to implement a feature to avoid negative feedback on the game as a whole.
I’m so glad we finally have a new 2D Mario game that’s good and they went crazy making this. Also online play is gonna be crazy
I just love how vibrant and unique the new worlds are. Everything looks so fresh and full of adventure!
Flower Kingdom located between the Mushroom Kingdom, and Sarasaland, lol.
6:29 bruh
i love the new mechanics in super mario bros wonder it’s quite refreshing to have something new
Seeing Bowser merge into the castle cracked me up. This is going to be a hilarious game that is great in general.
I wonder if the drill power up is a callback to the Mario galaxy one? It would be super neat if so
There are so many good ideas that are being shown. I just wish the Yoshis were like the other playable characters. I want to play as Yoshi but keep the same difficulty as Mario and the others.
I need this game asap!! I want to play it now !!! 😊
This game will be a masterpiece, I can't wait, I love Mario so much, one of the best franchise ever created, I love how it feels old and nostalgic but also new and fresh ❤
Nobody’s talking about how the final boss will be A LITERAL CASTLE!!
Game looks phenomenal!
I wonder if Charles Martinett still did the voices of Mario and Luigi for this game
Wish I could play this on my MacBook!
1:50  Smooth McGroove?
Is there anything Nintendo can’t do?!
So does each character not have its different jumps
Mario Bros. Wonder looks fun af, but it is a shame that they're going with the Mario Maker 2 "all characters play identically" system rather than the classic Mario Bros. 2/Mario 3D World character differentiation. Also, Yoshi and Nabbit should NOT just be Funky Kong-style Easy Mode characters, that's such a waste.
The badges remind me of Yoshi’s Wooly world and The Origami King! ❤ love these new ideas Nintendo, glad I preordered it!
Mooooollaaa
The amount of memes about elephant Peach was absurd.
This Going Be A Best Mario Game Ever! This Mario Game is gonna be Wonder is GamePlay is Familiar Plattform Changes and New power up And New Silly Enemies.😃
...DeviantArt's having a field day with this, aren't they?
Niceeeeee
"The Son of Man is coming!"  are the words to be heard soon by the whole world from the Arch Angel Micheal during the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first thing I want you to know, whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus. I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And the Holy Spirit will dwell in your heart and you will become a new creation through Jesus Christ.  Let us pray...  Dear God in Heaven. I come to you. I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived. The things I have done. Please forgive me. Cleanse me. With your precious blood. From every sin, I have ever committed. Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus. And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead. And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life. And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.   We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen.
The game looks so nice and creative! One thing I would change is to have the different playable characters (besides Yoshi and Nabbit) turn into diferent animals instead of just elephants. But yeah, overall, I think it will be the best 2D Mario honestly.
Better have an option to mute the flowers
Super Mario Elephant Drill looks dope!
or you're gonna turn into a goomba
What a well put together presentation. Looks like they are really busting a lot of Mario conventions in this game, which I love. Really makes me excited for this game!
Wonder flowers just seem like Mario getting off his rocker I think it’s pretty funny
Yellow toad join party
Let it be know, the plural of spikey is spikey 6:50
wow this looks so good.
This looks absolutely fantastic and super fresh lol I cannot wait
This is amazing! I can’t wait to play with my niece!!! 🎉
looks fun!
cant wait to buy the game
Couple of hard, pipe rock hitting plateaus
I like the Idea of riding tho
Yoshi should be just like normal characters
The Maw-Maws look like a cross between Poochy and Clodsire, with Kirby's mouth and appetite. 😆
i cant wait
I need dat
Ok 👍🏼👌🏻✅ three things. First off, best 2D platforming Mario game ever! 3:56 Secondly, it’s about time you stared putting Daisy in these games again. I heard on Slick Frame’s YouTube channel that you guys have her as a secondary character, and that her fans keep trying to convince you guys to put her in these games again. And it’s ironic that you’re putting her in a game about flowers 💐🌸🌺 cause well, she’s literally named after a flower 🌸🌺🌹. 5:22 And thirdly, I love 💕 the new power 💥 ups 🔝! But I want more! Like 👍🏼 a dragon 🐉 one ☝ that can make you fly 🛫, breathe fire 🔥or ice 🧊, give you extra coin 🪙 luck 🍀, ground pound crystals 💎, or bubbles, and claw your enemies. I mean 😭, Mario and his friends already go head to head against Bowser on regular basis. And he’s literally a Chinese 🇨🇳 Dragon 🐉 Turtle 🐢. So why not make the playable characters dragons 🐉 to. Also I just really love 💕 dragons 🐉. Which is literally what profile gives away. Oh and I’d also love 💕 a ninja power up ⬆ where you can, throw ninja 🥷 stars ⭐🌟✨ and knifes 🍴🔪 , weld a katana and a Cherry 🍒 blossom fan, and use smoke 💨 bombs 💣. Oh and if this game is about flowers 💐🌸🌺, then make sure to put literally every single flower 🌸🌺🌹 power up 🔝 in Mario history in it!
This honestly looks incredible. I’m going to have to get this alongside Spider-Man 2. I guarantee this game will do better than Sonic Superstars.
Seems awesome

2.1 million emraties in thr uae 30 precrnt of uar is  emratie  soo  uae with emrtaz5ion is o creasi g thrn uae will be majiorty emratie
IM SO HYPED! I really love the new mechanics and formula of this game! 😃
I want Nintendo to make a switch port of yoshes wolley world
number of likes this gets will be the number of people that wants the flower to be named "flowey" 👇
So when are we getting Super Mario Sunshine 2?
The ESRB may change this game's rating following the reveal of new content in this game's trailer.
The way everyone was so happy after Bowser took over the land.
Does anyone else think that these Kindoms need to invest a bit more into their defenses??
Mario should have just stuck to shrooms...
GOOMBARIO FROM PAPER MARIO IS BACK (KIND OF (NOT REALLY))
I wonder what goombas taste like
I dont know how to feel about the talking flowers...
This game will sell a marmillion copies
Just from this direct, I can say with full confidence that this game is going to be one heck of a banger.
The Yoshi’s Island inspirations make me smile :)
I already bought my copy
Yeah, apples that turn you into an elephant are cool, but can you ride on a Yoshi that’s also riding on a Yoshi? Can you create the Leaning Tower Of Yoshi!?
Pov: you go into a boss fight with the invisibility badge and the boss doesn’t activate because it cant see you
0:11 OMG the opening cutscene is here as well as the start of the game??? WOW!!! 🤩
Already loving the look of this game. It’s so stylized and doesn’t look or feel like another copy and paste installment of the franchise.
Yknow what would be really cool?  If the final boss has Mario merge with the Mushroom Kingdom Castle to fight Bowser.
Wow this is exactly what we’ve been asking for for so long, Nintendo continues to amaze with their creativity and just fun games :)
I wonder what goombas taste like
Looks good, but the fact that all characters play the same is a real downer :(
the sequel to mario bros. we never thought we wanted so badly.
i love everything they showed but why not have normal online coop?
Like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Daisy gets a playable source!
I will get that game for Christmas.
This game is five times as enjoyable as the other modern 2D Mario games, but there can also be a new game; Super Mario 3D Universe. It would feature everything from all past Mario games as well. Same for a Mario Generations.
Take all my money right now Nintendo.
Is this Smooth Mcgroove!?!?
Somehow you made me even more excited for this game
The flowers give more personality to the game than the characters.
Same crap different flavor.
Get ready to witness Mario merging with Dora the Explorer!
I hope we can take off the good great stuff
Can we make a smash move set based on Mario’s moves here?
this phnominal
I haven't really played a mario game in a long time, but this is one I want to buy for sure. It looks amazing!
Well the Switch went out with a bang!
I’m gonna be Luigi and this has online mode rise
i don't even know what to say there are so many things in mario that i do not know
Okay but why does he sound so weird and WHY tf does he say wowikazowi
i really dont like the amount of inflation in this game
Wonder flower, just leave that laying around anywhere huh?
No online co-op, really Nintendo??!!!! How hard would it have been to include this feature?
Speed runners already planning routes probably😂
3:57 Ok I love how the presenter named _Daisy!_ the same way she typically shouts her name. I caught that, and thank you 😌👌
This is gonna be the best 2d Mario game since Super Mario World.
I wish some of the yoshis weren't invincible.
Summary: WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
"Turn into a goomba" CAPPY GET UP!!! CAPPY GET UP OFF THE FLOOR PLEASE CAPPY. CAPPYYY
I love the heart points idea. It’s kinda like collecting hearts from the “Kingdom Hearts” series. Only this time it’s more friendly.
I'm so glad that this direct was an introductory to most of the features of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and not just a gameplay with very quiet commentary. This honestly feels like a Fantendo dream come true.
really can't wait this is a new Mario Era. here. we. go!!!!!!
Oh El Ee Dee No one pronounces OLED like that (IK it's an acronym for Organic Light Emitting Diode)
I like how it seems to be going back to the crazy, experimental era of Mario we haven’t seen since the original Game Boy
True Super Mario Land Vibes as we're ever going to get here power ups an all (can't help but feel crafted world got robbed of badge system here ha ha) Smart with Online while it's not the same at least this is a good alternative for those that desperately needed the extra company,  with a nice race that reminds me of Super Mario Run  some people think this is too much or cheesy but I think this is a step in the right direction for sure😁  so with that in mind can't wait for the inevitable reveal of this as a new game style for Mario Maker 2😉
Peach game update when please? 😭
I'm not a big mario fan but this looks fun.
Boutta bring back dem 2009 WII vibes…
Crazy creation! See you in October
Nah Bruh why Non-mushroomed mario look like that tho
add a retro world dlc, some challenges like in nsmb2, mario vs. luigi, and some minigames and you've got yourself the best mario game ever made. also add wario and waluigi.
Nintendo PLEASE add a setting to turn off "no damage" with Yoshi! He would be so fun to play as with the flutter and tongue as long as he can still take damage
I'm honestly more a fan of "actual" online co-op, but I'm just SO excited that Wonder has online at all. Especially the 12 player things makes it feel like a mini-MMO to me lol   Pretty excited to travel around the forest and stuff while seeing others doing the exact same alongside me c:
Update super mario maker 2 please and thank you
Did they design the drill after the same drill ‘power-up’ in Galaxy 2?
I want to play as Yoshi with health. 😮
❤
BRO THERES SO MUCH COOL STUFF HERE! POWERUPS AND BADGES?!?! AND THEY DID ONLINE PLAY YESSS!!  I’m too hyped for this, this is an AMAZING Mario game!
no online play. great
Great, they got Benjamin the elephant in the game.
Bro this mario game is boutta be amazing player shadows like dark souls what?!
Awesome Voice. I loved to watch. Best Wishes.
Black cal inside photo karo❤❤❤
Mario: If you don't watch the Super Mario Super Show, you're gonna turn into a Goomba! Also Mario: 8:43
The fact that the characters don't have separate animal transformations is a bit sad, if they did, we'd have to a reason to want to use the other characters. I mean, imagine if Yoshi was able to use the mushroom, and transformed into a T-Rex. That would have been awesome. Oh, well, the game still looks amazing!
8:46 SPIKEBALL AND NINTENDO CROSSOVER
8:52 Uh oh... the elephant powerup was just the beginning...
If they were still supporting Mario Maker 2, all these block additions would be so great. Excited for Wonder, kind of wish they built Mario Maker into the Mario games now.
This looks amazing
I don't understand why this has to come out the same day as spiderman 2
I really like the style and some of the changes but this feels like its gonna be super easy for anyone over 5 unless they intentionally limit themselves from mechanics
This is awesome and I'm definitely getting it, but I can't wait for the next 3d Mario game 😊
How does Nintendo continue to be so innovative? This looks incredible.
What happens if Mario and his friends jump on the off block?
This game looks spectacular. I dont have a nintendo switch tho... i hope i get one for christmas so i can play this amazing game :)
I still can't get over how good this game's aesthetics are
I LOVE how Nintendo are expanding the Mario lore/worlds and remaking Super Mario RPG (Legend of the Seven Stars) which already expanded the lore, which gives me hope on a new DK or Wario game cuz those are like the biggest extensions of Mario as those games barely even have Mario in em
Can we skip the intro in this game?
They did it again. The world around us might be in chaos and turmoil, but Nintendo gives us something fun and fresh- just like 30 years ago. ❤
A masterpiece!
This IS Super Mario Bros. 6
Bruuuuuuhhhhh!!! I never thought Nintendo could top Super Mario Galaxy in this modern era but bruh! 12:05 made it clear thia game is going to sell a trillion copies. The online / other players shadows from across the world that can interact with you, give you items, bring you back to life? This might be the most forward thinking Nintendo made game ever. Im blown away by this direct... Metroid Prime 4? What Metroid Prime?
They dont have unique abilities? That sucks. 4:03
Wowsers.
Nice to see some animations from Super Mario world
14:48 Oh boy here we go...
I’m more than ready for a whole new chain of 2D games taking place in the Flower Kingdom
The game looks a bit blocky. Best way I can describe it. Like when Mario smiles in the beginning, his smile just looks painted on with a marker, or when Yoshi has something in his mouth, his mouth looks mechanical. As cool and varied as the backgrounds look, they do look a bit burnt and hazy. But don't get me wrong, the game looks amazing! All the details, new enemies, new mechanics, and new animations are incredible. The visuals just look weird.
I wonder what goombas taste like? Wtf
The shown level design, power ups and I hope challenge makes we want to pre-order the game. Pure Nintendo creativity 🙂But some things are personally holding me back so far:  Can experienced players also switch off all the hints? They do not have to be treated as new entry players and would like to dive right in without explanation of where to drop water of if they can get somewhere in a level. They know. Just add an option to switch off the talking plant, it is annoying me already in this Direct, let alone when spending hours with this game. Similar for the 80s Batman-like text bubbles. Not needed. And I think it is a missed opportunity to have the main characters have the same gameplay. No more quick grab from Toad, higher jump from Luigi or skirt float from Princess 😕  Oh, and sooo close to online coop play. I really enjoyed that with NES and SNES online play with friends. I think that is a missed opportunity. We can play online coop with the first Mario games, but not with the most recent instalment?
And DK continue in the abyss...
I'm so excited for this game! I'm really looking forward to the badges!
God i hate that jump sound
I’m buying this.
5:15 I like how the Koopers hip bump when they turn around.
i can’t be the only one who sees the resemblance between king wart and prince florian
Oh my god this is amazing!  I actually really like the online multiplayer aspect.
I liked this new Mario game!
Nintendo deixando os haters 15 minutos calados.
New Mario characters ❤
Really do *wonder* why they replaced Pink Yoshi with Red Yoshi... hmmmm... lol. also yeah I'm definitely not the only one who hates that Yoshis can't take damage (like, Nabbit as easy mode is fine, but why you gotta force easy mode on the Yoshis too :c)
Elephant peach
This looks really cool!  Am I the only one though that wishes they would allow you to play the old school way of having players take turns on courses though?  I imagine trying to play this with my kids and it devolving into all kinds of chaos, which can be fun but tends to wear out quickly.
toddler mario game (it's pretty cool though)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This game looks amazing! all the new items and enemies look great! I especially love the bubble flower character designs.
This has so many similarities with Super Mario World rom SNES, I'm so happy! Even the sounds! And the music is so good!
Port pizza tower on nintendo switch
Did they seriously make a Mario MMO
Oh and when you save the flower from the ice cube in super mario bros wonder 7:08 i think the flower would say thank's for saving me
i love the talking flowers already
Well well well, Switch OLED we meet again...
Why does this have more personality than every paper mario since sticker star
It's sad that you need an NSO subscription tho. Not everyone can have it and online play is such a big chunk of the game, that I would've preferred something everyone can play. I personally don't think having to pay for Online Play is fair, since you already had to buy the Switch and the game itself, why would I need to pay a tax to even play with other people?
GOTY
LOL Even Nabbit is joining in on the action!
This is incredible!😲I can see there are two Toads and four Yoshis in different colors.
Locky 2s
Would have never thought Nintendo would drop something this creative and out of the box. Lets goo, October here we come
My boy Mario can get a hookshot before link ever sees that thing again
I want it now 😍😍😍
Time to instill a fear of pachyderms into Goombas forever!!! >:)
honestly, i think nintendo (or someone there) saw sonic boll. waiting for playable bowser jr.
1:50 is it just me or does this sound like Smooth McGroove singing?
First watched this on my birthday
Love it! So classic but, new and fresh. The new design and animations look beautiful, I love the new courses, powers, and idea of badges.
I can see the mario inflation and Yoshi's spine being crushed by an elephant memes now. Cant wait
An option to play as Yoshi with only the same abilities as the regular characters would be nice. Yoshis my character but I don't need my hand held in these games 🤣
Did they hire Smooth McGroove for the overworld music?  This is ba-boo-ba-baaa-bing fabulous.
Mario is a strand game now
2d platformers are back babyyyyyy!
Super Mario Acid Trip would Be A better Title
pretty cool  i just wish before release they will add an option to make yoshi near immortal and have the option to give him a health system like the others
Bowser fusing with a castle is the stupidest idea I've ever heard and I love it
3:56 I love that they did the”Hi, I’m Daisy” inflection.
i miss the coin battle, hope there is some "versus" mode to play with friends besides the race one
Peach elephant....  OMG...
If there isn't an option to turn off that stupid talking flower I'm not buying this game.
i like how they used the smrpg jump sound for jumping
So the bubble power up is kinda look like same bubble power the two bubble dragon duo have
I just wish they would’ve let us fully play with friends online
Is there a nintendo direct soundtrack?
it is sad that my mum lost my switch, have to miss out on such a game...
Art style reminds me of that Nintendo Power cover
I hope they add goomerang bros as a dlc enemy
8:43 mario did not watch the super mario bros super show and was punished
I LOVE HOW MUCH DAISY GETS HER SCREEN TIME SHE DESERVES!
I love how this game looks! But the online feature are giving me mario maker 2 flashbacks
This looks like it has been in development for a long time.
SMG4: stupid mario bros wonder, when?
omg this looks amaaaaaaaazing!!!!! can't wait for this and SMRPG!!! Thank you Nintendo! <3
Get Wario in this character line up!!!
I really hope their is a badge that kills you if you get hit once so I can play as nabbit and yoshi while still having a hard time
take my money
when Nintendo were making Super Mario Bros Wonder. miyamoto was like how werid can we make this game?
I found myself smiling as a lil kid through this whole video! 😅 It looks really really good! And i can´t wait to play this! Oh, and badges! I love the idea of them helping you through some stages! Amazing!
MedMen Stock Running Up Now! Health Services Directs DEA to Reschedule Marijuana! Buy MedMen Stock Today!! Mmnff........
Wonder Flower are so far the most powerful item in Mario they basically Warp Reality
Everything is perfect, except how they made yoshi for beginners. I wanna play as yoshi but still have the challenge 😭
Guys there's already 43 results for elephant peach on r34
I love the visuals of this game. It's like an updated NSMB but with way better animations and a little more sass. That bubble power is gonna be OP af for speedrunners tho 😅😅😅.
I only say this once let's a go, this game so going to make my birthday worth it
Before one day of my birthday, lol
Sweet
Mario on drugs: the game
I want it I want it! I get a nostalgic happy feeling with this one. Also every character playing the same is kind of a bummer to me. (Other than easy mode characters I mean)
This looks like fun. Glad they put more characters in this one.
The bubble suit is so cool omg
Loved the open map on some parts, the new design and worlds looks amazing too!! Very exciting seeing a new 2d mario after 5 “new” (even thought the Wii’s is one of my faves from all time)
Am I the only who realized that Mario’s bubble form looks like one of his alts in Super Smash Bros. Brawl?
Speed running is going to be insane for this game
oh my god toadette is here THANK YOU for finally stop playing her dust (also daisy) hope birdo is next!!
Well at least there's some semblance of multiplayer outside of couch co-op. Not exactly what I hoped for though....
This game has so much personality, snd I'm definitely buying it when it comes out
This looks really good. That grapple vine looks like a lot of fun
I'm not the only one who hears that snare, right?
Looks good, but I really wanted something more akin to Odyssey.
The fact that they had no deadline to get this game out gives me high hopes for this game.
there will be a mario red edition, but there wont be luigi green edition :(
Can’t wait to play this game with my family
I don't like how when you play as Yoshi you can't die. They should do where you can change the difficulty or when you play as Yoshi it makes the game harder since Yoshi has his own powers
Bowser, someone got to trap him like how they did in the Mario Movie.
Where’s the Charles Martinet and Miyamoto video
My names for the worlds (when the name is in bold, that means the world is already named) : •World 1 - *Pipe-Rock Plateau* •World 2 - *Fluff-Puff Peaks* •World 3 - *Shining Falls* •Central - *Petal Isles* •World 4 - White Sand Desert •World 5 - Uncanny Forest •World 6 - Volcanic Valley
Plantera bulb at 7:05
Important question! Can a yoshi who is riding another yoshi, also have a yoshi on his back?
OK You sold me.
nice
Badges are always make any games so much better! Playable Peach should be the norm 😍🍑
WOOOOOOO NABBIT MY KING
I think from now on I'm gonna try to get a new Super Mario or Kirby every Xmas
Nah, this 2D mario is GOATED
I Like The Idea Of Standees And The Ghost Revive Mechanics!  It’s Very Cool For Us And We Need More Mechanics Like This.
Finally Nintendo has mde a very fat powerful game after odyssey
This feels so fresh. Love the fact that the developers weren't given a timeline for release so they were able to get creative more
One Of the Badges Is a reference to super Mario bros 2, what is the badge name?
Peach and Toad as elephants got me
tell me when this game comes out
QUEEN DAISY!!!
This is truly a strand type game.
I wonder what goombas taste like....
E L E P H A N T  M A R I O
Genuinely my only 2 problems are that I wish Yoshi wasn’t invincible and I hate elephant peach
It looks so pretty but I wish yoshi was the same as the other roster characters rather than being an EZ mode addition
5:18 Lokeitus
prince florian looks like hitler
This game has great new powerups, many characters are available like Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, Yoshi, Daisy! This is a whole new adventure for Mario and his friends.
I honestly want wario and waluigi to be sort of a hard mode for the game. Just imagine, maybe they can’t use badges because they don’t have prince florian by their side, when they get hit when by a power up they go all the way back to their small selves like in the older games and they don’t get a life every time they get a 100 coins and they can’t use the newer power ups, they cannot hold any power ups, and the worst of all, talking flowers trash talk them.  On a side note: PETEY PIRANHA MUST MAKE IT INTO THE GAME. And I won’t forgive Nintendo for not including a major STRANGE PLANT character in a game that revolves around STRANGE PLANTS.
So hyped
It looks good. But I hope I can turn off the “good” “great” pop ups when you stomp on an enemy.
0:46 Yk that's some Luigi's Mansion type stuff-
Not bad but I think I will stick to Super Mario RPG and Star Ocean 2
Shining falls don’t sound like falls
12:42 OMG!! Death Stranding!!!
So does that mean the flower kingdom belongs to Daisy? Because they were all coming to her.
"i wonder what goombas taste like" -Talking Flower, 2023
the online mode is an amazing way to do co-op without the risk of betrayal
No Amiibo support?
#1 on trending W
I AM GOBSMACKED this game looks WONDERful!!!!!
This really is Mario on drugs
Did Smooth McGroove do the music for this game??
This game promotes black magic. Please join my protest
this doesn't look impressive, this looks corny and over complicated, they should stick to traditional values that work, the VA is complete garbage.
The characters playing differently is a fundamental part of Mario and has been for decades. I don't like that change.
This is next level mario
I miss charles its a good game tho
This game is dope 😮🤌
I'm glad that they gave yoshi that cute face he makes when he has something in his mouth just like he did in super mario world
This is a beautiful looking and fun game! I can’t wait for it to release!
Ughhh i guess
When you realise that the Mario gang accepted Nabbit, an active criminal, into their friend group before Waluigi.
Wait is Charles martinet still mario?
I love the idea of the badges. Changes up the gameplay, while still keeping it fairly simple and not overwhelming the player with lots of abilities.
This is looking like the most innovative Super Mario game yet. I can’t wait!
a new 3d world would be better
I love the idea of the badges.  Changes up the  gameplay, while still keeping it fairly simple and not overwhelming the player with lots of abilities.
I just realised that super Mario bros wonders comes out 2 days before gd 2.2 lol
Wow this reminds me of seeing super mario world for the first time on super nes. Is this running on a new switch model didnt notice any slow down with all those effects happening.
I can imagine players forming a great connection in the live ghost mode, excited for the release!
No way its the villain from shark boy and lava girl
Mario Maker RUINED side-scrolling Mario for me. This will bring me back.
11:16 Local co-op up to 4 players! 👍😃
That was a best day ever yesterday
2D is back babyyyyy
Deviantart be going crazy💀
That flower having full voice acting seems like it might get annoying after a while
Love to see how Dark Souls has influenced even games like Mario.
I’m so glad they added yoshi and it looks really good
I mean ... aren't we supposed to have fun discovering this for ourselves? What's the point in purchasing this game if we already know what it involves?
I'm so glad they are trying something new for 2D Mario
The Speedruns are going to be nasty!
Did anyone notice there were Fire Spikes?????
absolutely living for how this franchise continues to innovate. also not me waiting for the internet to get weird about elephant peach
there were so  much memes about mario elephant form but on that point no one didn't t saw toad and peach
3:26 YUNOBO???
Bye Charles Martinet 😢. But am excited for this!
Its always bowser causing trouble
I just love the new wacky, new style of this game. It takes things from others games and puts it in one masterpiece. Hats off to Nintendo👏
Dude a new Mario with this level of polish and creativity is so exciting
I would suggest that each character plays different, and that yoshi should be rideable outside of someone else needing to play as him
Yo they brought back the mechanic of throwing objects upwards like in Super Mario World
who thought the bubbles will make good kaizo?
Can I disable the talking flowers???
Dudes, some of the music sounds like Smooth McGroove.
Everything I ever wanted in a 2D Mario game. Except the elephant thingy apple power up it's so cursed.
This looks like every other 2d mario game. Yawn
All I hope for is that life sharing is an option
Wow, I "Wonder" how great this game will be! 😅
u can use the bubble power up to knock up baddies⁉️😏
It’s kinda scary how many ideas the Mario team has lol
You literally can’t touch Nintendo when it comes to their first party IP’s man. Can’t wait to play this with my baby siblings n friends family kids
Golly gotta love Flowey the flower
My only concern is that it will be wayy too easy. Seems like the player is absolutely jacked at all times
I really hope you can mute the audio for the flower, I can see that getting annoying.
It is wonder full!
Nice!
Bubble mario's out pfit colour looks familiar, i might not remember it 100% accuratly, but i think they coïncidentally canonized 1 of mario's alt costumes from atleast 1 of the smash bros games
This is a great thing to come out on my birthday
Deviantart is gonna have a hay day...
I'm 57 years old and I'm not ashamed to admit that playing Super Marios Bros games made me Gay. :)
Arr!
October Is gonna be a wonderful month for games!
they put terraria hooks in the game
Rosalina was an unlockable playable character in 3D World so I'm crossing my fingers she's in this game too 🤞
One word, amazing!!
this is Nintendo’s year.
RIP to the Superstar😨
I WAS RIGHT! YOU CAN RIDE YOSHI AS YOSHI!
Now we know what to expect of Mario Maker 3
The best thing has to be the fact that blue toad is back
This looks very promising as a new installment in the series! Very nice to have something different.
Petition for Pauline & Rosalina as DLC.
Blue toad is finally playable.  Wait a sec I thought elephants can't jump.
I just hope they didn't make it too easy

Super Mario Bros. Wonder content could come to the next Super Smash Bros.
Imagine a Mario and Luigi game in this world 🔥🔥
I am bored of these 2D Marios, where is the 2D Donkey Kong game??! Come on, Nintendo!
i love this game, it still has the same old mario feel, but adds so much more, im hyped for this
Nintendo: We're gonna make a brand new 2D Mario game.  Everyone: Let me guess, New Super Mario Brothers 3? >:(  Nintendo: No. THIS!  Everyone: I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK.
I swear the speedruns for this game will be complex
Love everything about this! Can't wait to jump in and meet y'all! <3
All Nintendo has to do is do something similar with next Mario games.... and BOOM! Everyone will be so happy!
This looks so good! It really feels like they’re trying to makes something unique, and I love the visuals and music. The badges remind me of the Alphadream games which is no bad thing
Most of you won't care, but those "hidden coins" in the dock of the new Swtich OLED model is actually the very first sub-area in SMB.
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about the style of this game that feels a bit... off.
I want to watch this but I want to be surprised when I see the game lol
Looks so good! Can’t wait.  The online play looks fun!
Esse vídeo foi  curtido 👍 e  compartilhado em nossas redes de divulgação.
Elephant peach 💀
I saw that bubble power up and the same Luigis costume in a SMW hack! *insert DiCaprio meme where he points at TV*
Definitely looks more inspired than I first thought. I’m upset with the direction the art style has gone though. While it does look more varied, I hate how squishy and bright everything looks, the characters especially. Anyway, this game is for kids, so I wouldn’t consider that a flaw.
6:45  Am I the only one who thought ''Kirby and the Forgotten Land'' when I saw this new power up?
Nintendo you should fix yoshi's sprite because he looks weird compared to the others.also there should be a sort of drill dash were you go flying forward drilling anything in front of you
Love how the wonder flower is just acid. This game looks awesome
Theres more enemys
ooooooohh! Nabbit! + am i the only one who noticed the koopa shadows?
Nintendo lost a great opportunity to add a new princess to the cast.
This is everything that makes a great Mario game.
AMAZING
bubble powerup is stolen from bubble bubble game
I’m just happy Nabbit is playable again.

Is it just me or does it give Mario & Luigi Dream Team Vibes?
This will be a nice refreshening installment to the 2D Mario games, and the best one for a while. I’m excited and ready to play it whenever I get my hands on it.
I like this new talking flower, he’s nice and silently evil.
I’ve been a Mario bros fan my whole life and I gotta say this is one of the most unique trailers I’ve ever seen, can’t wait to get this game and try it out with my siblings
The badge abilities are such a huge addition. Nintendo always knocking it out of the park with 2-D Mario series
I love Daisys wowie zowie
Have we ever had metal rifts in a Mario game? Jack Black really rubbed off on the character, and I'm here for it.
👼😇✝️🦁🏰🎮 Lake of fire and sulfur Heaven Universes Hades Multiverses Planet World Earth, All Every Comics Cons Wonders Worlds World Images tv Channel Bible. Super Mario Wonders.
Wonder flower is a shroom trip 😂😂
this is just like dark souls
Did not expect obvious Death Stranding influence. Love it. Everything about this game looks like a joy
Looks like a day-1 buy to me
Noice
New little Toadies
Most likely you will make Mario Maker 3 I would like to add Super Mario 64 mode
Man they ALMOST added online co-op and said nah halfway through XD gave us everything but the ability to play with friends directly online
Welcome, to the flower kingdom. But Bowser. (Video ends)
Oh nice, it's Super Mario on shrooms...
7:30 daddy’s daddy! 7:35 I doubt it
The online mode is super cute. I love all the characters too!!!
This is the real NEW Super Mario game
OooOOaaaAAH!
It took them until 2023 to have a character select instead of forcing you to play as Mario until you beat the game to play as someone else. It's about time God damn.
Finally, a strand-type Mario game.
I loved  Charles Matnie voice but it's gone
3:33 Talking flower: "I wonder what Goombas taste like.." LOL
Ima play as yoshi cuz invincibility, can't wait for inf lives!
looks more like a Kirby game
So does this have regular 4 player online?
Is that Smooth McGroove in the soundtrack???!!!
Worst 2d mario game lol 60$ just saying       Characters are all the same tf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TF!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not to mention baby easy mode huh lol and other cons but oh well      Spend 60$ or 70$ to Nintendo that's what they want ;3       your money lol
Mario games never cease to amaze me
This looks so good, cannot wait to play it! I hope you can save after each level you played. I did not like what they do with the Super Mario Bros U Deluxe on the Switch. Where you sometimes needed to play 4 of 5 levels to finally save your progress!
Basically, the yoshi's will be doing what Princess Peach should be the one doing (floating with her dress). Seems like a missed opportunity for some flashback hahahaha. Loved the game ;)
Nice
Dude, this direct went so hard. 💯  I can't wait to see how they  implement these things and characters into the next smash game!!  Or the next smash direct!
Hello Thank You For The Movie  .   What a good game i liked it very much he is a Superstar  coming soon.. the animated series of mario world 3d world
I can finally have the feeling of having friends, thanks Nintendo
Mario x Bubble Bobble
This is going to be a blast to play when you're high  Also 10:23 i never thought i would hear a sentence like that in anything related to Nintendo lmao
That lip ok Yoshi looks so stupid please do an update or something to fix that was the stupidest decision like whoever made that decision should be fired! You had to animate that monstrosity…..like I wanna play as him but it’s like what’s the point now? He eats anything and looks derpy
I'm not a fan of the elephant power-up, but I love everything else about this game! Especially the online mode where you can not only be a hero for the Flower Kingdom but other players too! Nintendo outdid themselves once again!
I love those koopa troopa animations so much! In fact, I love all the animations! I know this game will be amazing! I’m just glad y’all didn’t completely murder the new Mario series
Cant wait to play as peach!!! 💖💖👸🏼👸🏼🥰🥰✨✨
Can't wait to pay $70 and beat this in 2 hours.
The Mario red edition was just a lazy move by nintendo but WOW this game is hype
Which game is this ?
6:05 *C U R S E D*
still no playable red toad???
Currently this game has more voice acting than Pokemon
THATS THE ROSTER
I Have A Lot Of Guestions  Guys Is This Game Is Related With The New Súper Mario Bros U,  (Sequel Or Prequel)
Charles Voice lines will be reused  because of course
Literally unplayable..... no Rosalina.     I mean, it's probably like 3D World again, right? ... Right?  I thirst has no limits.
E L E P H A N T. P E A C H
Elephants cannot jump as they dont have knees, but these can!?! I hate logic
When does this game come out?
PIPE ROCK plateau!!! Mario meets GTA!
The only thing I dislike is the stupid acapella song
Sparks are back🎉
juegaso the online wow!
The new voice actor for Mario is so good, it is as if Charles Martinet never stopped voicing him. I'm still going to miss him voice acting Mario as he has been his voice for almost 30 years
So does this mean we can create an Yoshi tower if a yoshi hops on a yoshi and then another yoshi hops on yoshi and so on?
The devs werent cooking, THEY WERE BREWING THIS LOOKS LIKE ODYSSEY IF IT WAS 2D
It is fair to say the new power up is kinda like kirby copy ability
It’s like it’s SMB5!
Nintendo online service is so great I can't see all those online feature going wrong especially the race, afterall racing in SMM2 has always been so smooth and flawless
You’ve outdone yourself
Sonic Superstars doesn’t stand a chance 💀
I think Yoshi shouldn't be invunrable, Nabbit is enough. Would've been cool if they *only* flutter jumped
Did he say mula?
10:05 did mario Just got a grapling hook
It's a little much for a 2d Mario games. It's not simple and accessible to get into
This direct was insane. Looks like one of the best Mario games ever. I can’t believe that some people still want more from Nintendo. It’s kinda sad tbh
I‘m very hyped😍‼️
This is crazy.. nintendo literally is writing another history for 2D platform Mario with the online feature that none other game has ever done. Such a simple idea but yet noone thought of.
6:05 maybe elephant peach is the most curse thing i saw in mario but i like it
I think that yoshi should not be immortal
i’m the
Hiiiiiii!
So Online is only to play with friends as ghost? I wanted to see my friends with real colors as local co op.
Prince floria looks like a caterpillar
Bubble is my new fav thing
mane get that elephant off yoshi's back that's dino abuse
The yoshies look so high
At least Please Happy About This New Mario Game
Mario platformer games are consistent and familiar and not too complicated which makes it one of my favorite comfort games.
A promising game.
The badges take all the challenge out of the game. I will still try it, but I have really cooled on Super Mario Wonder. Its not going to be a day 1 pickup for me. This from a huge Mario day 1 fan.
No Rosalina why?????
They need to start adding Classic Mode, where you only get mushrooms and fire flowers, cos all these new suits look like they're made to make it easier.   Mario 1, 2, 3 weren't easy, neither was World in parts. But NSMB weren't hard at all
well i know what im getting for my birthday
Finaly, it seems like instead of implementing maybee 1 or 2 fresh ideas to the 2D formula nintendo let their developers go nuts with this one! Cant wait to play it!
Mario Evolution!!!!
I don't know what was Nintendo smoking but this looks absolutely AWESOME
Nintendo giving us good XD
Plot twist: Mario is voiced by Charles Martinet's Cousin! Which is why he doesn't sound too off putting but is also noticable that it's different.
Okay I’m sold
dang, a little disappointed that the Yoshis are part of the no damage easy mode
I swear there gonna make a wonder 2 a wonder switch 2 version and wonder 2 deluxe 💀
mamamia
oh no! they gave the devianart users material!
probably the only reason i feel compelled to get a switch now
Mario wonder is a strand type game
I grew up with the original and I love this concept. I haven't played in years but this makes the little kid in me want to go get a switch and play ❤
❤
Anyone got a spare Switch?
This is HUGE!
So let me get this straight. This WHOLE time, for over 20 years or so, the Flower Kingdom apparently existed "not too far" from the Mushroom Kingdom, and they are just NOW telling us about it? WTF have they been doing over there???
VADDADADADADADADADADA
FINALLY
But thanks Charles
Seriously its world that be open for us. There comes more abilities and its so big and cool. I love the online play and contact with people yeh i love it.🥰🤩🥳
Omg when this gets added to Mario maker
2d mario needed a chance and boy does this game live up to that promise already, cant wait for the game to release
wow i havent been interested in a platformer in awhile, i cant wait to play this game! hopefully they will add characters like Wario, Rosalina etc as future updates/dlc
So badges are like shards from Ori and the Will of the Wisps?
I like that the parachute cap badge is their version of stilling the ability that papa Louie has but nobody talks about it
Mushroom kingdom: Mushroom 🍄  Flower kingdom: Fire flower 🌹 🔥  Next you’d think would be a star kingdom but,I think that the star kingdom could be the Comet Observatory; Rosalina is referred to as a princess in a lot of games.Also in the Comet Observatory, there are hundreds of lunas and star bits..... ⭐️  SPECIAL KINGDOM!
8:34 I love how confused the narrator is
Pretty good, but this is so slow, I know you want to focus on younger audiences but it is a video covering a single game for 15 minutes, I don't think 10 year-olds will watch this anyway
GOOMBA MEAT
Yoshi's Island and Super Mario World vibes. Am I the only one getting them? Animations, stages...
Bowser again? Really? Otherwise looks great
WHEN IS SUPER MARIO MAKER 3
3:00 sounds like smooth mcgroove
Bowser really said “Mario keeps destroying my castles so I WILL BECOME THE CASTLE”
By now, there is only so much Mario 2D games and 3D they can make. Getting pretty tired of seeing mario games now. Nintendo, make something new!!
i hope you can stomp that talking flower out of existence. there is no way that feller will be anything but annoying lmao
This is going to be so much fun!
Gosh, you have no idea how excited I am for this romp through the Flower Kingdom. The badges are a pretty fun idea, and those new Power-Ups look pretty good, even if the Drill Power-Up does remind me a whole lot of the Drill Copy Ability from Kirby & The Forgotten Land. This isn't the first time Mario has used a drill in this way, but for this take, I'm definitely convinced they took a couple notes from HAL. Either way, I can't wait for October 20th!
I love this! This is beautiful!
bro... my dreams CAME TRUE!!!!
With Mario Maker 1 and 2, they put 2D Mario into the hands of the player. This game puts it right back in Nintendo's hands cuz they just put so much inside of it. The visual style, the music, the multiplayer. I love the new enemies and enemy variations. And the transformation animations are crisp. I wish they would give Donkey Kong this kind of treatment.
It’s like Nintendo gave us an early year of Mario! A movie, then a remake of a beloved RPG, and now this beautiful fusion of art and technology!
These finally feels like a legit new addition to the 2D Mario games. The Badges are the coolest part, and the only thing that seemed like it could be annoying is the talking flowers ( I recognize the voice...I think it's from FE:Fates)....but this game looks awesome.  I had zero interest in the game until this Direct, now I really want to play it. So much replay value packed in.
Hehe new charcter is nabit
Hehe new charcter is nabit
Damn I didnt think mario would become like dark souls
Hehe new charcter is nabit
6:33 I see everyone happy but who knows what kind of devious act Nintendo is gonna ask us to do for world 9  Edit : i didn't even see the badges part, we're gonna play kaizo mario i swear
From an 8-bit game with maximum 64KB to this? I think Nintendo has reached their peak game creation abilities
OMG NABBITS IN THE GAME
It's the New SMB games with a new coat of paint. Honestly, the more I see of this game, the less I'm excited for it. It just looks like more of the same. Seems Nintendo is continuing their streak of mostly underwhelming or, in some cases, outright bad Mario games. It's honestly sad that we've not had an excellent mainline Mario game since 1996. At this point, I'd almost say it's time to just follow what they did with Link's Awakening and Mario RPG and just remake the classic 5 games in full, modern HD and then just retire the brand outright.
I like how despite this game not having a damsel in distress, there isn't a prince in distress. Instead you're helping a prince get his stuff back after Bowser goes psycho and robs him 🤣
I guess this means a few more years until Super Mario Maker 3.  But by then the Switch 2, Super Switch, or whatever the successor to this generation will be out.  Maybe a DS switch.
It feels like they dumbed down Mario a little bit and the powers feel more like they belong in classic Wariolnd games. Graphics look fun tho
we still don't know who is gonna be the voice of Mario
We want a new 2D Zelda game nintendo
This is so dope! I had no idea the game would be this good!
Looks a lot like a fan-made game (but nintendo doesn't allow those)
la moula 10:24?
10:28 You see Mass Media?  From now on, That’s how you make a good invisible power-up!  I never should’ve bought Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue on the N64 when I didn’t know it was the worst game.
Hay
bro the music from this game feels so nastolgiv reminds me of the golden age of Mario 2:50 to 3:44 is what I'm specifically talking about
I hope there is a versus mode.
is Peach Elephant gonna turn into a Bowsette situation 🧐
This game is going to awaken so many people’s fetishes.
Oh Oh! SO NOW THEYRE WILLING TO USE BADGES! Where was this when origami king was in development instead of the stupid breakable items noone wanted
Right so we can agree that Wonder Flowers are psychoactive drugs right?
Looks like Mario's got a new side gig as a game show host! Move over, Luigi,  it's time for Super Mario's Wonder Game Show'! 🕹️ Can't wait to see if the final boss is a tricky trivia question!
Why is everyone in the game saying "wowwie zowwie"  has Bazinga energy, and I hate it
They took quite an interesting approach to online play and I think it’s actually cool
Mario on drugs be like:
WAIT NABBIT??? CAN HE FINALLY GET POWERUPS AND BE A CHARACTER???
Nintendo, you'll always be a wonder to me. 😊
i can't wait to play this !
I love how expressive everyone is
Peach Inflation!! Balloon Peach!  I absolutely love that, a dream come true!  That element combined with how good Mario games are, and how expressive the character models are here, made me decide to get a Switch and this game! (I usually stay with the NES and SNES, but this is irresistible)
i should play mario maker 2 to practice before this game gets released
Really hoping all these characters check into rehab after this
yaey im so excited for this game
that music sounds like it is sung by jacob collier xD
----Mario Stop Eating mushroom , and start smoking flowers----   Freshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Even tho i play new super mario bros and was my fav game for so long on the ds then on wii but idk why this doesn't conviced me.
I’m just sold with the performance of the game. If it actually runs this well on the Switch, it’s gonna be an impulse buy for me 💯
No Rosalina? 😢
0:21 My favorite part.
I was so hyped about this game.  Then they talked about multiplayer online and yeah...  my dreams are shattered yet again.  Back to supporting Fan Mario online games.  Nintendo just doesn't get Gamers sadly!
Peach elephant-
I love how they’re okay with showing Peach’s underwear in this game, but not in Smash.
I'm excited, and I love the art direction that they went with, especially in the silhouette stages. I also like how you can help other players online. Can you imagine if you could also invade their worlds? Haha.
The music is amazing
That’s so cool 😎
Uhh...Hello?  Nintendo? you REALLY forgot to collaborate on Spike Chunsoft for the Brand New Game.
Is Mario’s voice new already or still Martinet’s voice? I can’t decide it. 😅 Anyway can’t wait this game.
14:11 - is that a blue koopa shell?!?!
This game looks amazing, but I wish you could still grab your friends and toss them around.
this looks freaking incredible! will def be playing day one.
❤
This is mind blowing. I remember playing the New Super Mario games and enjoying them... but I was like: this is cool but we need new concepts. This is Nintendo's anwser. Bravo!
Need more elephant peach 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This Game looks so refreshing
I found a mantis with a broken leg Do you want to see it?
This game looks incredible! This Super Mario Bros. game is the Ultimate, I want it so bad 😂. Nintendo you probably have the flag to high for the next new Mario game 2D side-scrolling.
*Isn’t called new super mario  *is actually new
THEY’RE FINALLY CHANGING UP THE FORMULA
big W
Greatness game and information!! Love the new powerups, enemies and story!! MUST BUY Day One and at holiday season!!
Oh my God, this looks - dare I say it - absolutely _WONDERFUL!!!_ ☺  Loving all the new power-ups and features. The visual design for the levels, graphics quality, and new baddies look terrific, and it makes me so happy Daisy is finally going to be a playable character in a 2D Mario platformer! Really hope to see more playable characters added via DLC. Would love for Wario, Waluigi, Pauline, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, or Diddy Kong to be added. ❤  The various online features look fantastic, but damn it all, Nintendo's giving us practically everything short of what many of us have been asking for for years in previous Mario games ~ proper online co-op. Ugh... come on, Nintendo. _PLEASE_ implement 4-player online co-op for this! 🥺🙏
I have seen elephant toad and I will now never unsee it
Playable Daisy makes me so happy!!!!
Infinite gimmicks in a world where everything is pastel coloured with rounded corners.  It looks so boring and soulless to me.  It's not their fault, everything goes this way once all the juice has been squeezed out of the franchise.
5:40 Nintendo why are you making fun of our gods, why so much resemblence? Why don't you include 1 powerup of other religions? Because you are scared you will be shut down or bombed?
Bubble for smm3
So SO INTERESTING! This is old school bit fresh at the same time!
Smbw preorder bonus speculation    A free exclusive badge thats just a double jump named the Petal Pounce, which will be dlc that will release after the preorder bonus ends.
ok
i see this game is again for 6-12 yesr old childs…it loook sooo easy to play why you doing this nintendo
The amount of ways to play a single level are ENDLESS! Making this game always having something for you to do. This game is going to be a great one. (And how would superstars catch up?) One more thing, I feel like it should be that when you selected your character, if will show you a menu within that characters box showing a Button to play Normally, and a button fo play in easy/mellow mode (basically when the direct showed that yoshi and nabbing can't take hits)
The bubble power up is gonna be a completionists dream
I've got Tir Na Nog(Bayonetta Origins) vibes in wonder effect
You shouldnt go in your home my frend
Badges? Is this the Hollow Knight of Mario games?
Yellow Toad protecting Peach and Daisy catching Toadette is so cute and wholesome♡
Is the wonder flower a drug
Online co-op situation is disappointing, but everything else looks great so far. Can't wait to play it
Is there only 7 worlds or is that not including the final/bowser one?
I'm scared of this new toads from flower kingdom.
I wish it had true online. But this looks great.
Oh I DEFINITELY Hear SmoothMcGroove at 2:50!
This is like everything I wanted for a 2d Mario game and more
Perfect evolution of mario
I love how they actually made Mario a “strand-type” game.. Justo en la nostalgia .
The badges are gonna make it feel like an actual progression. Like not only will I get better as I play, but so will Mario. So cool
I can't believe Jack Black is in this game
Can’t wait to play this game
don’t do drugs kids
I love verything about  this new Super mario bros wonder badges , power ups they are like collectibles and the multiplayer feature is awsome i wont be alone finally while I'll be playing super  mario bros wonder :D
nice
I don't care about your credit score I just wanna know how many heart points you have
The only thing for me is Mario getting more power ups seems like he’s getting the Kirby treatment. Maybe balance it and have certain characters have specific abilities for replay value. I do understand that could get annoying though. IDK, just first thought although the game looks really good.
I was wondering what Fire Daisy would look like, after they made Fire Peach _red_ instead of _pink_  Also I am now wondering whether you can make big Yoshi stacks like Goomba stacks :P
Genuinely surprised that I have yet to see a comment about the new voices. Except for this one, of course.
DAISY!!!
Game of the year already
8:53 Oh no.
Let's play a game!  Spot which other 2D platformer each mechanic is based on!
Is it just me or does the singing of the music sound like smooth mcgroove
Ngl, not a fan of how the characters look in this style. The base models just don't feel like they "fit" in the world.
Who’s Mario’s new voice actor
I just CAN’T with the excitement  straight 15 minutes. Nintendo players will be busy while having fun. Excited for the contents also here in yt.
This was .... wonderful
Stupid
Common flower w
Before seeing this I figured it would be a good game but nothing too crazy. After seeing this I think it's safe to say this will be one of the best Mario games ever made. Every new feature they showed off seems like a great addition and I am genuinely impressed by how experimental and unique the gameplay will be from any other Mario side-scroller.
I miss Charles Martinet.
elephant toad isn't real.  elephant toad can't hurt you.   elephant toad :
OCTOBER 20?? Why not this month
Bubble Power up maybe is inspired from SMW 12 Magic Orbs
From the neat online portions to the just amazing looking level design and ui, I am SO excited for this game! I am literally gonna buy a new switch JUST to play this. I'm looking at that mario oled model with a glowing passion. I hope they have 4 player multiplayer but the room thing is so freaking cool already, where you and some friends can just play levels together and have a good time.  Not to mention the absolute glow up of a map screen this thing has with both the traditional pathing AND open sections like 3D World!  Badges are a neat addition to spruce things up and just make the game more FUN and less the same. Not to mention I can just tell that the amount of stuff in this game is gonna keep pulling me back in for more.  AND ON TOP OF THAT, Imagining the posibilities with speedrunning itself, using different characters and new badges to mix up strategies...  I think Nintendo did a perfect job of ramping up the 2D Mario game industry.
Justice for elephant yoshi
They really thought of everything.. 🥲♥️
Is the art style that disgustingly ugly intentionally? It actually makes me want to vomit. Most of this is just old stuff brought back into this game. Fundamentally lazy and uninteresting.
Peachy peachy peaches😂
We need waluigi
This has got me more hyped than ever!
That mouth got me dying… 4:27
Calamity Bowser X M.O.D.O.K.
the new mechanics, powerups and badges feel fresh, yet still so true to the classic Mario brand... and seem to fit perfectly into what we love about gameplay in 2D Mario games. i'm really excited for this game!
Looks great only complaint is you can’t pick up other players anymore 🥲
Wonder Flowers are just the "haha Mario eats mushrooms and is on drugs" joke contextualized in a family friendly way and I love it.
Elephant princess peach🤤😭😭
This game looks like it's advertised for toddlers. Ok, I'll skip it then.
I really wish I didn't watch this would've loved these as surprises
Glad the Nabbit is back. Hope we get to chase him in some levels.
This game has so much potential!!! When i saw it on the 21st June, i thought the art style was kinda weird. But as the trailer went on, i started loving it. After seeing this presentation, i knew it. The art style is modern and it looks gorgeous. The art designers deserve so much credit. It looks a TON better than Mario Bros. U's 3D models in a 2D space. They nailed EVERYTHING. But, we just have to wait to see if you can still throw your little bro in a lava pit
That presentation was so good that I had to turn it off after five  minutes - and it made me feel like I never needed to play the game myself.  Looking forward to purchasing the less technically advanced sequel in 2012 though!
is there BAH BAH
nice to have a easy mode with yoshi...xD
I like how at 3:57 the narrator says “Daisy” how she says it!
if you Add wario I bet it will sell more than hundred thousand  copies
3:35 this make me chuckle  💀idk why this is funny to me
I associate a color with each Mario game. For example:  Forest Green: SMW Green: 64 Dark Blue: Galaxy  Sky Blue: Galaxy 2 White: 3D Land Yellow: 3D World Red: Odyssey    In the case of Wonder however, it’s the entire rainbow. That’s how good this is gonna be.
Now even Nintendo has Spider Man
this game has so much charm and personality that really sets it aside from the rest of the mario sidescrollers and i love it so much
I still have my fingers crossed for Wario as a DLC character, but other than that this looks perfect, down to the very last detail.
Petition to make Nintendo make a rated M game
DUDE… Badges?! Online races?! This is HUGE for Nintendo
this game look super addictive and fun to play I can't wait!
gimmie a badge that makes you DIE INSTANTLY upon taking damage
they definitely made super mario bros very new this time
This is such an exciting and unique take on Mario!! Havent been this excited since 3D World
This game is shaping up nicely! The only real letdown is how all the characters (minus the Yoshis and Nabbit) all play the same. Still, it is a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things as it shapes into the ultimate 2-D Mario game!
I am genuinely happy
Still waiting for a game set in the unique and already-established BeanBean kingdom
Bring back carrots and bunny ears
Mind blowing right now
I'm wondering, why Elephant?
They added PERKS? Can't wait to equip Marityrdom to drop a live Bob-omb next to any enemy who gets me!
I love it but can i turn off the talking flower please?
if we could put on every badge ever at once that would be nevermind then
Everything was perfect... Except the end of the video
Shame that special edition consoles these days have become so lazy. Remember the New 2DS XL special editions? Those were amazing.
This game better have 1 marioillion purchases when it comes out bc THIS GAME LOOKS SOOOOOO AMAZING
Wow, Nintendo did the unthinkable and upgraded Mario to the 21st Century! This game looks really cool and I‘ll pick it up. Might even pre-order it.  I‘d have loved to see this as launch title together with the Switch successor, but oh well, we all know how Nintendo is about updating their hardware🤐
This game is quickly reaching Mario 3/ Mario World levels of awesome.
WE SAW BLUE TOAD SO WIN
07:05 plantera's bulb?
I love taking anabolic steroids
Idk why i watched the full thing, i don't have a nintendo switch
Honestly, I’d prefer a Mario rpg instead but I understand these more kid friendly titles are important for the Mario brand 😅
This game looks so good.
Thoughts:  1. Wonder looks cool and unique enough to buy. Honestly this should have been the Switch release game instead of U Deluxe, but I digress. 2. The online features and character abilities make this game so chaotic and I wonder (no pun intended) how on earth this game is going to be balanced. 3. The new OLED looks like trash lol
I can't wait for this game to come out and people start wishing me happy birthday and I ignore them just to complete a level 💀
I really hope that the "good" and "great" pop-ups, they look very intrusive and annoying
Looks like Nintendo finally woke up, this is INCREDIBLE
That sucks Yoshi is an easy character
This looks fantastic, they really tried to make it stand out from previous marios. Can’t wait
I really hope you can turn off the talking flower's audio...
I cant wait for this to come out omg
Does nabbit still get 1-ups when he gets power ups
MARIO IS BACK!!!!!!
I can't wait to get the game
The fact that this wonderful game releases on my b-day makes my 20th Anniversary of living even more exciting.😀💯 When this games comes out, I'ma cop it Day 1🎂
i wish you could local co-op with all the characters but beside that, the game looks really fun
Yoshi riding a yoshi 😮‍💨
Can a yoshi ride a yoshi riding a yoshi riding a yoshi?!
I did not expect a yoshi riding a yoshi but well that’s interesting
Invisibility Badge Only run is currently being worked on by Gamechamp3000 as we speak
not so distant land... beyond the mushroom kingdom.. like.. the bean bean kingdom?
5:33 oh no it the elephant
Mario and Luigi may have gone separated, but now they've been resurrected and are now fighting all the odds that are against them.
can you change the animation where yoshi has his mouth closed while in "enemy etc mouth mode"
So no online  2023 and Nintendo still struggles with the same thing
i hope you can squish the talking flowers
Did you get Lars to do Bowser's drums?
It’s the fact it’s not a “new” super Mario bros game it’s just super Mario brothers
Muper sario
I love everything literally everything but that taking flower is gonna get annoying real fast.
Honestly, I am super excited for this. I loved Super Mario Bros back on the Wii with my buddies in middle school. (Also World as a kid on the SNES), but Ive always wondered why Nintendo doesn't capitalize on all of the Mario characters by making one of these games have more than just four characters playable. I'm very happy we finally have more variety to choose from. And the art/design so far is gorgeous!
Blue yoshi my beloved
This is not Charles martinet
Does anyone else notice this game does not have a time limit? This game is perfect change my mind if not 💯
I’m so happy to see Toadette is playable
Revali's gale is back baby!!!!!!!!!!
What a TERRIBLE direct. I just hope Samantha Kelly resigns, if so, then MAYBE I'll buy this game. Otherwise, I'll just stick with Kirby. Thanks, leetl1 and livelovelaugh22.
LA-KEY-TOOS
This is gonna be a good game even though it didn’t come out yet
A lot of this stuff should be in Mario maker 3 if they ever make it
5:11 Am I the only one who thinks these guys look like Screech from Roblox Doors?
I’m exited
I would love to watch all of this but I rather not spoil every single thing before having it in my hands, I saw a few minutes tho I am impressed.
The power ups are too OP.
FINALLY
8:43 If you're not watching the Super Mario Bros super show, you're gonna turn into a Goomba!!
It's not coming out this month so why does ot say 8.31.2023 because it's coming out on October
This is great Nintendo do more of this. Be different! Try new ideas! I want to see you try more stuff with your IPs. Frist time I'm excited for a 2D Mario game since the oringal Mario Maker
Where are all the "this isn't a real Nintendo direct" comments? That aside. I hadn't played a Mario game since Super Mario 3 and I'm starting to think I'm missing out on a lot.
Congrats Nintendo for getting #1 on trending
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HOW TO PRONOUNCE LAKITU!!! Dude overemphasized it, but I KNEW that "lackitu" was wrong! I have been vindicated!
Just stop with the mario games and this looks cursed..not even going to give it a chance.
Looks like some cool new features in this, but I find the "good" and "great" words to be really annoying.
The game art style is somewhat similar to Super Mario World
Nintendo please give us a new DK game or at least port DKCR for NS.
It’s funny how the switch came out in 2017 and it’s 2023 and there is still no option to change the background to a different color or have your own background it has been six years come on😂
My Birthday is on October 21
If 4 people play as all Yoshis, then can they stack up on top of each other or is it only "one Yoshi on another Yoshi"?
Eventhough this wasn't developed by Ubisoft, I still get an Ubisoft vibe from this game's presentation!
I almost beat super mario bros u and luigi u 3 times each
I LOVE that they finally added Daisy to one of these main games and not just the spinoffs. I was kind of disappointed when they announced that the characters all played the same, i was hoping she would have a double jump like in super mario run. But nonetheless I cant wait to play this.
I appreciate how the announcer says Daisy's name in the same tone that she would. 3:56
Looks really fun. Nice to see new enemies, imaginative lands, playable characters and no damage players so my little daughter can enjoy
I wonder how long it would take for people to make a fast speedrun of this game the moment it launches. And then I wonder how fast the game could be beaten in. Sub hour? Sub 40 minutes? Maybe some glitch to get sub 20??
Don't worry.  I just got my cap And my hat shaped ship   On the road to the flower kingdom!
People that are excited for this lost all their right to ever complain about pokemon being the same every year
All i can say aout the drill i always get tht beyblade theme(the og) stick in my head
Forget the entire game, you can play as Yoshi. I’m sold. Also elephant toad is cursed.
they did it.....they made it better than I could ever imagine
👋 That is so nice 👍 🙂
This is why i love nintendo product, simple and fun....
AND NOW SOME BUBBLES OF PURE MADNESS!!!!!
Que chingón se ve 😊
Very original super awesome and looks like a blast
The drill reminds me of the power from the mario and luigi rpg series
No way we even got nabbit
3:47 Darn. And I was really hoping to see the Goomba with the Blue Toad hat as a playable character...
This makes me want to buy a new Switch!
I was originally skeptical about the game, but this was a perfect direct and they’ve finally got creative with 2d Mario again
i need more than seven areas to explore smh
Did he srsly say laky toos? Its LAK A TOO
Smooth McGroove singing those harmonies? lol
Switch 2 when???  Better be next year. I'll pre order it.
This is full of features I’m overwhelmed
whos going to be able to afford it with everyone not having much money? can nintendo send it for free
This is the true sequel to the original 2d games
Oh
Yeah! I was correct about the Yoshi's!
WOAH NABBIT IS BACK
So just to confirm, there’s no timing on the levels, right? Because if that’s a yes, that’ll be a great thing for me.
1:57 no way thats smooth mcgroove
Super Mario's acid adventure
Oh sh.... this is unbelievable. I can't wait ! Also need that Red Mario OLED switch !
Badges? What is this nba2k
R.I.P. - O.F.F Charles "god" Martinet(for the record: i know he is not d3ad,but i don't know how to say when a person retires of doing something :P)
online seems weak was hoping for actual online co op not ghosts
🦾👀
Is the soundtrack done by that guy that does a cappella arrangements of videogame music?
It is so wonderful!Can’t wait to play!
"In these spaces, if you're not ready to take on a particular course, you can try a different one instead." Oh man. Some wicked courses this way cometh.
I turned myself into a castle, Mario.  Boom big reveal.  I’m a castle.  What do you think about that?  I turned himself into a castle!  I’m CASTLE BOWSER!!!
Wish Mario could visit the village of Chillingbourne.
Coming from a splatoon player, this is absolutely fantastic! The fact that Nintendo put a lot of work into the animations, graphics, and art style is mind blowing! I swear, if this was another New Super Mario bros. I would have not been hyped for this 😅! Can’t wait to see it in the possibly Super Mario Maker 3 😊
11:38 You mean like the parry from Cuphead?
The mario game we deserve.
Everyone called Florian: MOM I'M IN THE GAAAME!!111😢🎉🎉🎉😢😢
Splatoon 3's Side Order Direct in September. More New Mii Games Rhythm Heaven Fever (Megamix)
This game looks absolutely peak. So hyped for both this and Sonic Superstars
I love how old-school this is, but fresh and new at the same time. This feels like Super Mario Bros. 4, or Super Mario World 3. I did not hesitate to preorder this game as soon as it was announced. Super Mario Bros. was the whole reason 10 y.o. me saved all my allowance, Christmas, and b-day money to buy my first NES when it launched in 1985.
Nobody talking about how marios bubble form has the same color scheme as luigi's alt in smash?
spoiler of super mario movie 2
I'm ngl the fact all the characters play the same is gonna deter me from buying it. That was one of the best parts of 3D World, it's super lame there are 8 characters and they're all the same
12:46 Standees nu-
And I Wonder, What it means! What it means! And I Wonder, What it means, to find your dreams come true!
There is one aspect i dont like and that is i notice some of the wonder effects have a time limjt and if that is like now you have to replay the level then NOPE NOT PLAYING THIS grinding literally ruins EVERYTHING in a game was really excited for this but if trial and error style grinding like that by which i mean the only way to retry the effect  courses is to do the course then im not getting this because that trope literally takes out ALL THE FUN not joking really hope they dont ruin the game for me
If you played one Mario game, you pretty much played them all.......
It looks like the most childish Mario game so far. It's like New Super Mario bros even more childish.
I love the Bros new Voice now that I hear more of it the New Guy really nailed Martinets Charm he brought to Mario all those years ago
This game is looking WONDERful! Can't wait to try it out 😁
this looks wonderful
Yeah
This looks just incredible.
Kinda a missed opportunity that Yoshi can't swallow, make and throw eggs.
Nintendo did a fantastic job on not only this game but the trailer. I haven't been this excited for a Mario game in a long time!
Will you need Nintendo online to play the game online
is the game out now?
10:35 i Wonder how many kids are gonna have nightmares from this
why does mario look fat now lol
SUPER MARIO WONDERS AKA NSMB3 LOOKING GREAT!
Yes.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is a new era of Mario games.
hopefully you're able to mute those flowers lmfao
how does Bowser somehow keep becoming more and more insane?
get rid of the talking thing and you can take my money
this trailer genuinely made me choked up. watching Nintendo put so much love and care into their gameplay, art, powerups, and their online connectivity. everything that I've seen is perfection. cant wait!! ❤️
so is the wonder flower just acid
Super mario bros in dreamland
So will we be able to play the normal game online with friends? Seems like it's local coop only.
Yoshi spit animation doesn’t sit right for me at least lol
Did they pick up Smooth McGroove? Sounds a lot like him in the music.
Absolutley love the designs, especially Yoshi! He's so unnecessarily cute and his design combines both modern and classic elements so he can look playable and charming at the same time!
Speed runs for this game are going to be Wild
Castle Heterodyne cometh.
This came out during a super blue moon where I live 🧐
Love vid
i love you nintendo
Im rlly enjoying everything im seeing from this BUT  With what was shown off there is no excuse to of not have propper fully intergrated online co-op with friends
if im able to afford this (unlikely since it comes out end of october and there's stuff in november i want) I might pick this up..i prefer RPGs but i dont mind a mario platformer now and then .... even if i do suck at them
It does look fun, but I am not a fan of all the mechanics that make the game insanely easy. Like the pick any level on the map, and special badges. It takes away the challenge of completing a 2D Mario game that all the previous games had. As a 21-year-old who grew up playing Mario on Gameboy Advance, DS and Wii, I am sad to see this as I was actually looking forward to a new Mario game.
This will be the greatest side-scrolling Mario game since Super Mario World.
I really love the idea of the shadow players. Makes the game feel more alive seeing other players in the same level in real time
The devs seriously gotta lay off the drugs
im a super mario fan
Unlike the new Sonic game, THIS game actually looks like it's worth the $60.
Let's-a Go! 😂
this might be the greatest october gaming will ever experience
5:16 hey dad what do you want to drink?
14:31 Captain toad !!!
Oh wow dropping the ball with online once again any other system you could actually play with your friends without it being weird like this.
WHY IS THIS SO COOL
This game is gonna be one of the best games of 2023, and it's already a top 3 2D Mario games of all times! Nintendo just showed they still have it, because this is simply the 2D Mario game from my dreams. It's just wonderful!
Wait Bowser combined with a actual castle? Well that's a new one 13:59 Bowser Jr what happen to you little guy?
3:34 💀
Did anyone see some of those courses some of those look hard and i mean like mario bros 3 hard can definitely see why there including the yoshis
I like what I see. Surprised to be saying that.
😮😮😮  Awesome！！
I can tell its gonna be good because for once the presenter actually sounds excited without it sounding forced lol not like those were but you know
looks like a fun game but some of the power ups seem to op.
14:55
Me grappling with my vine tether onto a random wall and trick jumping off a Goomba before drilling into the ceiling.  I can't wait for this game.
It may be just me, but I fail to see what everyone is getting excited about. I love mario games, but this doesn't look that much different from the other mario bros 2d games. Sure, there's a few new concepts, but is it that nintendo fans get excited all too easy? I may be wrong and final product will be a great game, time will tell
WE ALL NEED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I NEED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
12:04
11:17
I wasn't expecting a game that was heavily advertising Elephant Mario to look this good, but this seems to be one of the most fun, creative Nintendo games in years. Can't wait.
i’m predicting that the bubble power up is going to be used way too much in speed running
Good there's a yoshi as some of those courses look like Kaizo levels of hard
08:15
I wonder what Elephant Daisy would look li.... *Elephant Daisy appears* So......CUUUUUUUUUUTTTTEEEE!!! Headpats and hugs for her!!  Also this game releases EXACTLY one month before my birthday!! I am streaming it DAY 1!!
Nab it is back baby
06:30
...locky-toos? 5:17 like ive heard of lack-it-toos and  luh-kee-toos BUT LOCKY-TOOS?
06:00
YAYYAYY NINTENDOOO
My only question is are heart points worth anything in the game?
....Charles Martinet is missed here
Easy GOTY. RIP TOTK and BG3
05:28 🐘
05:26
Music sounds like they Hired Smooth McGroove!
05:16
That's actually pretty sick!
We were this close to the first Super Mario Bros LASO THIS CLOSE
2023, mario does drugs
04:38
Damn this game looks freaking amazing. This game is really tempting me to purchase a switch just for this game. Wonderful job Nintendo. I love the direction, art style and gameplay. But damn this is really tempting to get a Switch!
Not even Mario can escape the grappling hook
This, to me, seems like a spiritual successor to mario world
Elephant Toad Exists I never knew I could be this happy
03:42
Game seems a little too easy aside from that it’s really cool
03:34
02:38
02:16
There all op tho😂😂😂❤
Way a go Nintendo, let's a go
01:46
The flower will be the death of me
01:12
elephant daisy uohhhhhh 😭😭😭💢
00:29
wonderful❤
A REAL SMW SEQUEL? DOWN TO THE FREAKIN’ W? I’m so happy right now. Edit: I can’t be perfect, Yoshi is a solo playable character, not a stage item. Meaning you need to play with someone else to use him, and he isn’t incorporated into the level design, sadge.
I really hope there is an option to mute that talking flower. Idk, just my opinion
Nabbits in the game that’s all I care about
Yoshi is hating carrying elephant form lol
E L E P H A N T  P E A CH
11:35  I lost it here lmao.
I really respect nintendo for adding features from previous games they already made like super mario odyssey goombas ,mario 3d world animated selection levels they even added that one multi-player mechanic from cuphead u die your a ghost but your partner has a certain amount of time before your ghost disappears off screen so yeah great game i cant wait for its release
If there's even a fraction nintendo can take this idea I will try it, would be great to have a bonus world just like most other 2d mario games the galactic gardens were Rosalina will be available with a good amount of final special and unique courses that will have different aspects than other levels and your final reward for getting every single wonder seed from every world including galactic gardens you will unlock special rewards it would be a dream to affect this game in any way thank you nintendo for these amazing games all these years. 🐘 🌸
Mm3?
Definitely a must buy for me woohooo....!!!
Even the online play idea is cool
Noticed that half the new enemies are named after flowers/plants. Props to that.
Yoooo so much is happening in October! Gd 2.2, WoF a guide to the dragon world, the Fnaf movie, and now wonder and the new switch!
This was wonderful
Those fire Spikes @2:45 stole my heart. I'm sold!   Also, there's something about this that reminds me of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. It's a vibe thing; does anyone else get that?
The best looking 2D Mario since World on the SNES
The NSMB games were getting a bit formulaic so I'm glad that this game is doing a lot to change up the formula.
will wario and waluigi be there too?    :(
I really hope the new console they’re working on is a switch dock that upgrades the power of the Switches we already own and then has some new cool tricks suuuurely 🤞
OMG I REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!!!
This will be the best 2D Mario game ever
There's so much cool stuff to talk about here. Here's one thing it seems the other comments haven't brought up yet: the new enemies. They're all amazing and I'd buy plushies/draw fanart of all of them! Hoppycat, mumsie, and maw maw are all precious beans who I'd hate to stomp because they're so darn cute!
Mario now turning to mega man
I love how there’s lots of things reminiscent to the more ambitious Mario games. -Super Mario land 1 & 2 -Super Mario World -Super Mario Bros 2  Also bowser becoming the airship seems just like that final boss in Yoshi’s Crafted World
Speedrunners are gonna love this
my expectations were at the floor because of the nsmb series, and you shot to the moon
Goalkeeper
This is legitimately the first Mario direct in years that had me smiling the whole way through. Hope this game lives up to the hype, which it looks like it will!
I hope we can turn off the ghost mode. I love the online shadows but I don’t like that they can revive me and make the game too easy.
nice
F for b,uttocks of the wild age of kk-lamity and t!ts of the kingdom,such a densetsu no kusoges,no offens but they're just dissapointing,they're a scam and a scum#,nintendo make it well with mario AGAIN
To have a 2D Mario game with this level of imagination and creativity is amazing. October can’t come any faster.
there’s no such thing as a bad Mario game this game looks amazing
I miss black Yoshi in my mario games
Super Mario Bros. Wonder Thật Tuyệt Vời! 😄
Gonna be a masterpiece for 2D Mario series.
Luigi 90s: The Magic Ballown! 8:53
You know what having Daisy in a flower themed land makes accurate sense
With this and Sonic Superstars my wallet is gonna hurt for a bit
MID ONG
Uh oh... looks like a certain website has more material now
Hella mid lmfao
Mid
i love how bowser gave up on trying to kidnap princess peach and instead wanted to become a whole castle😂😂😂
this mairo is awsome , good grhapic & gameplay  i love it
yo, love how they put the RPG badges in this
This is the most trippiest Mario game I've ever seen and will play
Nintendo has basically stolen my heart with this one
Wish they brought back Prince Haru. It would’ve made sense.
They made a 2D platform Mario game into an rpg AND a death stranding game put together. This is amazing lol
Now this is how a Nintendo Direct should be, Fun, Engaging and Exciting. Let's Go, Wahoo!
Super Mario mid
Goty
why isn't there proper online co-op though…
0:40  it’s so weird that they made bowser fuse with a castle
Justo en la nostalgia ❤
12 CHARACTERS!!!
The Grappling Vine reminds me a lot of Strike Chain, ability after defeating Wire Sponge from Mega Man X2
IM SO HYPE FOR THIS GAME
This will hands down be the best 2D Mario ever
Why elephant peach is Bald... pls fix with her original hairstyle
This is going to be the best 2D mario game yet
“I wonder what goombas taste like” 💀💀💀
I wonder how SMG4 is going to adapt Super Mario Wonder into his video?
Noo ice sad.  Ice flower 3rd best ever
This almost feels like a repurposed Mario and Luigi rpg to me.
This looks like the best Mario yet!! They absolutely nailed the art, continuity, theme, all of it looks fantastic!! Wahoo!!🎉🌼🍄❤
3:34  why the heck does he wonder what goombas taste like  why
Love it. But who is voicing Mario? It's not Charles so we wanna know.
WHY ARE THE YOSHIS AND NABBIT STUCK AS EASY CHARACTERS 😢😢😢
This game looks so freaking good!!! This game is gonna do really well!
Doesn’t Daisy have something to do with the Flower Kingdom?
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
yoshi can ride yoshi. this is insane.
Finally online play. It's so weird its more like a Dark Souls type of online play, but I love it.
But Alan Wake 2
My mom doesn’t think the super Mario Bros commercial from the movie phone number is true she think it’s fake😡😡😡😡
as much as I was planning on getting U deluxe, I'll just have to wait for this instead
this game is gonna be amazing
Mario galaxy did the drill power up first, there for it’s not a new power up.
I am waiting for it’s release
Aging myself but I haven’t been this excited to own a Mario game since Super Mario 3 on NES. Congratulations Nintendo!!!
I didn't except the online functionality for this game to be death stranding
It would’ve been cooler if the characters played differently like in SMB2 and SMB3DW. Also if Yoshi wasn’t easy mode 😕
Are the koopaling I. This
Nice fake comments Nintendo
the game seems to be super awesome and i'm really hyped for it but the oled switch is booooriiiiing
wowee
i can imagine the challenge runs with the implementation of badges
So Wonder Flower = Triforce. Right?
smw vibes
I hope I can play this game on release day, it looks very cute and charming, not to mention the online features which look super helpful! But good LORD UP ABOVE I AM SCARED WHAT PEOPLE WILL MAKE WITH THE NEW POWERUPS
can multiple yoshis stack up on eacheother if so that will be funny
Even though Charles martinet isn’t gonna voice Mario anymore, this game will still be amazing
They never ran out of ideas
Take my money
This trailer sold me.
This game looks legitimately super cute. I love it.
just like kirby vibe?
gaaaaaaay
Artistically and mechanically this game looks amazing. Bravo Nintendo!!!
Game looks great but I don’t like it
strand-like game
Excited to ride my friend!
This game honestly has so much replay value compared to the previous 20 years of new soup. Really excited for the youtube challenges to be popping up in my feed soon
Adios chats martinet 😢
A New Adventure Begins With Mario And His Friends as Our Heroes Arrived at The Flower Kingdom With The Invitation of Prince Florian But When Bowser Along With His Son Bowser Junior & Magikoopa Shows Up The Evil King of Koopas Used The Power of The Wonder Flower By Fusing Florian's Castle To Become One Giant Castle Now He Plans To Spread All Chaos To The Flower Kingdom So Mario Luigi Peach Daisy Toadette The Two Toads The Four Yoshis & Nabbit Set Out on Their Journey To Stop Bowser Once Again With Florian By Their Said To Save The Flower Kingdom
I still dont get why they ditched blue toad in nsmbu dx, he was my fav character to play as
“I wonder what Goombas taste like”  Excuse me?
Bro peach and the toads look like they have massive diapers 💀💀💀
When the 2d platformer mario has a better badge system than their paper mario games
They took such a big risk with this new Mario and I believe it really paid off the new super expressive style seems really fun and refreshing. Excited for the new mechanics even if all the chaos is going to hurt my eyes at times XD. Can't wait for family to join in as well gonna be so crazy XD
Darn I need this for my life.
Bro!! I am so excited, this comes out on my birthday! :D
“Bubbles might, uh, bubble up,” may have single-handedly been the best words ever to come out of Nintendo. But then they went and caught me completely off guard with the way he said “Or you might FLOAT THROUGH SPACE” in a way that sounded like he hadn’t read the script beforehand.
There is so much innovation in this Mario game that it's hard to absorb it all in a single viewing!😅😮 It makes the mind Wonder...😊
I had a wonder flower once. I named her Lucy. The Beatles actually wrote a song about her. She was full of potential, but once I hung with her when I wasn’t in the right mindset. Needless to say, Lucy and I don’t hang out anymore.
Why build another castle when you can Become the castle
This game is so amazing, yet it makes me again think about the fact this game will be the new "Super Mario Bros Wii" for the new generation of people. Mainly the kids who got Nintendo Switches at young ages.
I'm so excited! I wonder if they timed this release because of the movie. The new extremely animated vibe of Mario and the enemies reminds me of the movie. I like seeing mario elated, shocked, scared and angry. I hope bowser will be just as expressive.
Where is Rosalina???
how is there TOO MUCH content
Milk our wallets, more, more.
They added too much, doesn’t feel like Mario at this point
Arlo is gonna love AND hate this 😅
This game is INSANE! ❤ i love it a lot!!
I also wonder what Goombas taste like 😅
Bring back the pixel graphics
You can play as Blue Toad and Toadette in super Mario bros wonder that is so awesome
weak
Could this mean we could get a Mario maker 3 or new updates?
now I have to buy this game
It looks stunning.
Bubble Bobble bubble jumping. I like it.
Damn they all play the same wasted potential (except Yoshis and Nabbit)
My favorite character Wario isn’t in the game so I won’t be buying this
That looks amazing!
They made Mario look angry 24/7 with the eyebrows…
Too much mechanics 😮
I hope Nintendo reveals more new original power ups for this game that turn the characters into cute chubby animals. and maybe have them become animal form versions of Raccoon and Cat abilities instead of being costumes they should be adorable animal transformations. We also need DLC Costumes and DLC characters like Wario and Waluigi and Donkey Kong and the adorable Koopa Ninja Pom Pom and more as playable characters
looking forward to this one for sure.... looks like a blast...
OMG!!! is @SmoothMcGroove ???
I wonder if there could have been a bear  power up🐻?
I want to see the following options with Yoshi. 1. Be able to change the settings that Yoshi can take damage like other players.  2. Have setting that Yoshi rather than taking damage if getting hit by an enemy he will run really fast like he does in other games. It would be a fun challenge to try to control him when he is going so crazy.   I think there should also be a ride yoshi challenge where rather than just a race, you have one player trying to ride on 3 other yoshies, meanwhile the Yoshi's can run as super fast pace but can't leave the screen of the player that is trying to ride them. This way it would be a fun game of chase and tag. Yoshi tries not to be ridden while other players try to ride him. That would add a lot of replay value to the game.   Give it a thought!
THE SECOND STRAND STAND GAME
I wish the Super Crown could appear again
Ẃāĥø
I realize they've put a lot of time into this, but I don't think I could be less interested in playing this mess. We want more Mario Odyssey levels.
10:02 OH MY GOODNESS PIZZA TOWER🔥🔥🔥 11:34 CUPHEAD !1!1!
O jogo tá incrível.
Getting a Death Stranding vibe from the multiplayer components, big time.
I can't wait to play as Daisy ❤💞❤️
Can you provide?   Blue Zones Environments Quality of life   To Release Saturday November 18 2026   In Development   New Game Video   Nintendo Next Home Console after Nintendo Switch
I was mildly interested until I saw the badges. Now I want to play it.
aww man Yoshi is for easy difficulty, whatever ima still use Yoshi. Yoshi on top
I knew the warriors thing was false. Bowser is indeed the main villain
Can you provide?   The Sims   To Release Saturday August 12 2028   New Video Game Experience  High Quality Experiences  In Development   Nintendo Next Home Console after Nintendo Switch
the badges are such a good idea. it's simple but effective. they add an extra boost and more variety to courses for people who want to use them, and keep the game a good solid challenge for those who don't.
art style we can agree does suck gameplay indeed hits like a truck
7:31 ELEPHANT DAISY
Is it weird that the thing that made me the happiest was seeing Kamek?
Who already wants this in Mario Maker
Next Direct in September (if it happens) will probably be focused on the Super Mario RPG remake as well as Early 2024 games.
Nintendo is always brilliant. People who make fun of Nintendo are so stupid. I was not even excited for this one and now I am. The almost “multiplayer” feature is really fun.
wait since the elaphant power up works with most if not all characters. can we have an elephant yoshi riding an elephant yoshi riding an elephant yoshi riding an elephant yoshi
Nintendo finally did it, they finally incorporated hallucinogens into the super Mario universe! Omg I’m so happy! Thank you Nintendo!!!
Man. Super Mario Bros Wonder looks great. Probably the most creative & complex Mario Game in a while. I can't wait to play it.
This is the first strand type Mario game.
does bowser actually take over a government institution, spew poisonous gases around a country, and turn peoples' homes into prisons??? i'm only a min and a half in but for some reason i'm having flashbacks to a certain period of recent history.......!!!
the only commercials i like watching lmao
1:50 why is the “Glee” choir singing tho
I don't think Nintendo understands what they have unleashed by revealing elephant Peach
The speed running community is going to be interesting..
This is the biggest change I've seen in a mario side scroller
Speedrunning this game is gonna be crazy
Can’t wait for this it looks so much fun!
❤ you Nintendo keep bringing outside of the box innovative fun clever charming games
Tons of stuff of going on in this game. I’ve also notice they changed some things from the usual Mario games. No timer anymore, which I guess because they want the player to explore much, and no points score. It’s just compliments now, no point numbers when you kill enemies and stuff.
lazy nintendo still using the same wii-wiiu engine
Marioverse is huge AF now and they couldn't think of anyone else to make playable other than multiple colored Toads and Yoshis? 😦
I actually have high hopes for a traditional 2d mario game for once
Oh boy that Jet Run would make this game a playground for speedrunners
This and Sonic Superstars, Nintendo and Sega, I will buy them!!
Mushroom Kingdom is taken to next level!
This has to be the most wholesome game of 2023.  It has been a banger year for gaming!
Why did did the end of the scream at 14:12 remind me of Toad from Mario Kart 64 🤣
This honestly looks a lot like a Mario fangame and I'm all for it
“If you look closely, you can find mario and some hidden coins!” So they showed exactly where they were.
this game is fuego tho its such a different approach i cant wait to play it
world 8 will definitely be the octahedron-shaped lands in the sky in the back (@ 1:56)
While I’m not a big fan of the art style I do love the online shadow players, the Wonder Flowers is a really interesting concept and have been wanting a 2D Mario game for a while. The game looks solid and I’ll definitely play this with my sister.
Man…with such a powerful item, you’d think it wouldn’t have been left right out in the open for anyone to just slowly swoop in and nab it.  I’m thinking that prince Florian and Bowser are in cahoots and Florian’s only in it for the insurance fraud proceeds. 🤷‍♂️   Game looks fun tho 😂
Why isn’t there original special  Nintendo switch’s anymore?
if someone is playing as a Yoshi you can jump on their back and ride them around the course 🤣🤣🤣
Bubble form. So i now can play bubble bobble in super mario wonder.
Okay but hear me out, what if instead if Super Mario Maker 3, it's Super Mario Maker 3D?
> sees badges.  Whelp this already is more of a Paper Mario game than actual modern Paper Mario games
Thanks Nintendo for making what seems like one of the best 2D Mario games. I've always loved platformers but I was getting bored of their repetitiveness recently. This one looks like its finally gonna shake up the traditional Mario formula, and I'm ready.
The game looks amazing and surely is very fun, but I hope the music is not that generic, to me the music in modern Mario games is not as iconic as in the classic games.
8:53 oh god oh no they made mario inflation who was on this dev team they’re two for two 😭😭
That snare tone goes hard for a minute lol.
Can I turn off The flower’s voice?
Aside from everything else, I'm glad they got rid of the timer.
When does it come out?
Okay, yeah, it’s definitely official, I’m getting this game some day. Might even ask to preorder it for my birthday
This is gonna be one of the trippiest games we're ever going to play.
Mhm. “Benevolent” Prince Florian. Yeah. Mhm.
Nintendo did absolutely amazing with this game and everything is perfect but it sucks that I will barely be able to see my friends when playing online
Huh, Mario Red OLED rumor seems to be true.
6:06 oh no pls, pls e621 don’t do it don’t pls
OH MY GOSH YELLOW TOAD IS BACK
The talking is stupid…..it’s giving off Philips CD-i vibes 😅😅😊😊
Take my money bro
This is a masterpiece, although I'm normally a 3D Mario guy, but I love this. Great job, Nintendo
Looks lame
Super Mario Wonder is a strand-type game confirmed
This game looks amazing and the race mechanic is going to probably get picked up for professional Super Mario Bros. Wonder racing.
Omg, I can’t wait for this game definitely will add this to my Mario collection.
Holy. Mamamia.
why do the flowers talk
Looks good, but you charge for online and can't even put real online co-op in your 2023 Mario game? Sad
BEANS
Nerd:um actualey Crouch high jump was on Mario 2 from América!
Great mechanics!
pyrocynical has entered the chat
Is it just me but does the talking flower sound like Goku?
This online experience looks INSANE! Being able to have other online players revive you. You`ll never lose.
HOW DID I MISS THIS
OH MY GOD IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME NOW AAAAAAAA
I seen a video like this, at least five hours ago, and now I look at it again. Not improved, I see. Well, looks like I'll have to DO something about its. Well now, lookie up. Daisy, who not even canon, she a game character too from aa Mario Movie game. Daisy? Just orange Luigi. Elephant? ELEPHANT? Who ever to makes a game, put an FAKE ELRPHANT! Ugh, not even after a bath time map mario kart 8, still screaming about that one Ninshito. So, the game we break it down again.  We see here, the game no good at all, just look to be damp. Damp? Not ever been a "Wet Mario." so now there is! Bravo! These enemas, they everywhere, too much, be rid of them from my sight.  Wario is absent.  In conclused, well, Luigi a pathetic man, Mario the hero, he kisses a princess, grubs not good presidents, okay, now delay the game thanks!   -Sincerely The Wario Forums Members.
every game needs elephant mode
This video game has SO MANY THING TO DO! I adore the Maw-Maws so much!
Mario games are so stale now this looks like more garbage
Hearing daisy yell out wowi zowi is all I needed in life
Really excited for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Sonic Superstars.
This game looks so good OMG
Looks like the usual same ol same ol
New SMB: Look at all these new enemies! Paper Mario: TOAAAADDSSSS!
please tell me you can turn off the talking flower VO
Ok is this just me or is this just Superstar Saga but bowsers the big bad and the game is a platformer
Nintendo played Cuphead and took notes.
This is true evolution for a beloved series.
Who ever is voicing mario, Chrales would be proud.🫡
you can play as yoshi? shut up and take my money
This game is going to be awesome!
I love how many playable characters there are
49 days left...
Ok i wasn’t so sure at first, but this looks really refreshing
One day we will get Wario and Waluigi as playable characters…. Hopefully
I am so pumped to play this. As a Paper Mario TTYD fan the idea of Badges makes me so happy!
Thanks for this wonderful game! The characters, the land, the courses, the power-ups, everything's perfect! Also, it's not everyday a Super Mario Bros game introduces SO MANY new creatures, I love them all!
I'm pretty sure that flower is just mario off a perc
This game looks good and all but I just don't understand why there's multiplayer online mode. I mean u can see other players in the world online mode and u can also create a room to play race with friends but not to be able to play the levels with friend online is such a shame.
This game sure is full of TF huh?
Ok but why does Bowser turning actually look HORRIFYING 😭😱🥵 00:50
This looks amazing!!!!
could be best overall Mario game ever. With all this VIBE. they took "wonder" seriously how whimsical and dreamy. Badges! And Heart points!! what excellent touches...
Mario fans eatin' good tonight!
This looks absolutely incredible, but they couldn’t have added regular online co-op? 😕 It would be so easy to, they already have online functionality
Obra maestra 20/10 y GOD, sin duda una innovación increíble para los clásicos plataformeros 2D
So it's more of the same.
Please no Bowsette again fandom
Man. I’m so bored with Nintendo
Have they figured out the name of the new voice actor yet?!
FAT ELEPHANT MARIO                                  FAT ELEPHANT MARIO LETS GOOO SMASH
as a ghooooosttt
this looks really cool!
I’m so excited for this!
I just adore the new art style and animations. It really adds alot more life and personality that just wasn't in some of the other 2D mario games!
This voice over guy is excellent
This game is very promising
YOU CAN BE SPIDER-MAN? Nintendo take my money
2:47 Fire Spikes
“I wonder what goombas taste like” bro wtf
It was a grappling hook  Dunkey 10/10
So what's the added incentive of earning heart-points? What would you use them for?
3:00 is that Smooth McGroove???
=IF ALPHADREAM WOULDNT HAVE BEEN DISMISSED THEY'D DO A PERFECT MARIO&LUIGI RPG OUT OF THAT IDEA  ......................AND I SEE THERE LOTS OF FUNCTIONALITY FROM THERE,THOUGH..............TOO WAY MUCH,TOO MANY OF PRG ELEMENTS!!!!..........IT JUST SHOULD VE BEEN A RPG!!!!!.........JUST WAS ASKING FOR IT!!...BUT R.I.P. ALPHADREAM......
Nintendo literally plagiarized a short story I wrote in Grade 7 about a place called Shining Falls with almost the exact same visual theme. Now I guarantee it's a trademarked name by them 😔
2 months. 2 months. WOW.
the online aspect of this game kinda makes it the next strand-type game lol
i can't remember the last time we got this many new enemies in a 2D mario game, let alone an entire new kingdom! i'm more excited for this game than i've been for any new release in ages
Why is Lakitu so cute?
Liiike it looks kinda good 👍
Epic
As a Mario fan, I already pre-ordered this knowing it truly is gonna be a blast.
Why does the Jump sound, sound like a really dry fart. lol
Omfg they canonized the prince
I absolutely love how this game is looking, but if you could do races against online players through the courses like mario maker 2 that would be so fun
Talk about evolving the 2D space. You guys basically took every great feature from all the best 2D games over the last 10 years and somehow put it into one mario game.
Super Mario World - Sonic 1 & 2 & 3  Super Mario 64 - Sonic Adventure 1 & DX   Super Mario Sunshine - Sonic Adventure 2  Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 - Sonic Colors & Lost World  Super Mario Bros Wonder - Sonic Superstars
What Odyssey did for 3D Mario, this game will do for 2D Mario. All the new concepts and additions to a brand new style of Super Mario Bros. is amazing! The replay value this game will have is off the charts! I can't wait when it will get released in the next couple of months.
Deep cut amiibo take priority in my budget
yes
I was not expecting nabbit to be playable again
Does this happen after Super Mario Land?
weird story but ok
Elephant peach is so cursed
I would like it if there was an option to turn off character exclusive mechanics. I really like playing as Nabbit but want to experience the game’s full challenge with my cute little burglar bunny 🥰
Something seems off about this game.....I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm not feeling it.
i am SO excited we're getting another fully fleshed-out kingdom a la the mushroom kingdom! we got other kingdoms in Mario Odyssey, but that was more about exploring small but very detailed areas in each kingdom. i'm interested to see a broader look at a big kingdom in mario's world!
Holy Crap..there is so much to do..racing replayable stages, new powerups, ONLINE?! i am gonna buy this game!
They added summon signs to Mario Wonder... so could we say this is the Dark Souls of Mario games?
genital fart
14:12  The talking flower : *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!*
OK FINE!! I'll buy a switch! Jeez!
The idea of Bowser touching something powerful and that having an extreme effect on him reminds me of the old paper Mario games, I love the idea!
Definitely picking this one up! A perfect Xmas gift! Also hope you reach 10M subs you definitely deserve it!!!
Pretty awesome
The holding item is like in Super Mario World. You could change too. I thought that was cool
Why no one talk about how they straight up stole the bubble flower from a smw hack patch?
Thanks for including the best Toad (Blue), definitely buying this game now!
07:29 what did she say? "where is your daddy?" O.o
Playable Toadette LETS GOOO!
OMG!!🤩🤩 This looks so exciting! I truly cannot wait to play this epic game when it’s out!❤
11:58  Yoshi (in his mind) : Just when I thought he couldn’t be any heavier.
I still do not trust that flower 🤨
11:54  We’ve got a Yoshi riding a Yoshi here!
Megaman
Some reason the flowers having voices annoys me. I'm not sure why. lol
if smb3dw and nsmb series had a baby
Yo, shout out to my boy nabbit for just being here
This new game reminds me of another game called super mombo quest
Game looks wonderful. Day one.
the speedruns for this game are gonna be CRAZY
Why is Elephant Peach so cute though?
I like how we're finally getting different Toads now
This looks like a lot of fun! Very creative!
First Strand-Type Super Mario Bros
THIS LOOKS AMAAAZIIIIINNNNGGG
Holy moly, no wonder (pun unintended) it took so long to make this game. There’s so many cool and innovative new mechanics but the online features are mind boggling! This is insane
the art style is a little weird but I'm still gonna get it
i fear the flower turns into a "chao"
I can't believe how GOOD this looks!! There hasn't been a Mario game like this since 1990!
Oh my god i love everything here! It's been a while since we've had a 2D mario game that feels NEW! and its not even titled "New" anymore!
Nailed it Nintendo
I’m BEYOND excited for this!!
The music reminds me a lot of Smooth McGroove, am I the only one?
I'm. Sad. Th voice actor. Won't. Be the same
I'm excited for the game but the switch could be more creative. The 3DS version of Mario and Luigi Dream Team looks way nicer 😊
Why did they give Yoshi baby mode ;c
You did it again.
marijuana kingdon
Elephas peach is so Werid
Daisy daisy daisy ❤
still in awe of how this game looks
I don’t see a timer!
You can tell this is a sequel to super mario world with how experimental this stuff is  Also just incase any nintendo person is reading this mabye try having a "suggest what badge i should use" in the side so players dont have to go back get a badge and restart the level ALL over again
Viva el Chochasupato
Nintendo really said Pizza Tower x Death Stranding x New Super Mario Bros
Speaking of Badges… It’d be amazing if Badges made a reappearance in the Paper Mario series + a Leveling Up combat system so the fights don’t become tedious
the wonder effect took the "mushrooms are drugs" joke way too seriously
A yoshi riding a yoshi that’s silly( it will be the first thing I do)
QUE CARAJOS ES ESTO?? Increíble, literalmente le dieron un nuevo giro y destino a los juegos de Mario...
My only pitty is how every character is the same
Wonder looks good, but I'm going to go out on a limb here - I think it's time for a return to overhead 3D Zelda.  Just saying.   (And maybe Metroid Prime 4, but I don't want to upset anyone.)
Finally a new 2D mario game! and it looks SICK!!
cant wait to buy
I’m excited to play this game with my 3 year old  v(⌒o⌒)v♪  Thanks Nintendo
Whats on the back of the mario red oled ? Is it just red or black? Does it have some kind of design like the animal crossing editition?
Omg, meme aside, but this Mario is the next Strand-Type game
I wasn’t planning on buying the game but after watching this I better start saving some money
killer bubbles lmao, wonder how powerful Mario is now compared to other fictional characters
WONDERFUL!!!
YO YO YO YO YOOO(MEME)
sad that there is no true multiplayer but it wouldn‘t work with strangers. true multiplayer online with friends would be fun
All im saying is DAISY FINALLY!!!! Im so excited 😁😁
why is regular toad never an option to play? is the color scheme too problematic?  I'm impressed though, some really cool New mechanics
Super Mario Bros. Pipe Dream.
Lets be honest ... the charachters playing all the same is lame and so is yoshi not taking damage...
Let me find out that man just said Pedal Isle. 😂😂😂
11:53 Woahshi, it's a double Yoshi exploshi
What a game
I refuse to trust the flowers... *Never trust a flower. Thats one of the constants of this world.*
I will not stand for this "Two Toads" erasure it is Buckenberry and Ala-Gold dangit!
Do water from the elephant trunk damage enemies?
THIS GAME WILL BE THE COOLEST VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN!
THE BUBBLE POWER UP!!! THERE WAS A MARIO ROM HACK CALLED "New super Mario World 1: The Twelve Magic Orbs" AND IT HAD THE EXACT SAME POWER UP!!! ITS A FLOWER THAT MAKES MARIO PINK AND HE SHOOTS BUBBLES AT ENEMIES AND THEY TURN INTO COINS!!! DID THE ROM HACK TAKE THIS FROM AN OFFICIAL NINTENDO SOURCE OR DID THE NEXT BIG MARIO GAME COPY AN 8 YEAR OLD ROM HACK??? SOMEONE HELP ME
Still cant break away from that crappy nsmb art style 🥴. What happened to this company? Not having miyamoto making these games has really hurt them.  And i just cant even deal with that dumb voiceover for the flowers 🥴. The gameplay itself looks solid. Such as the badges. Interesting idea.
Now I HAVE to see if you can stack yoshis
The cutest game I hadn't seen in years 😊🥰
This looks amazing! Theres so much new stuff and many new features. I love it! I definitely think this will be nintendos best game this year by far.
looks fun but it's a little sad that they removed unique character features outside of Yoshi. Luigi sliding and jumping higher, Peach floating, and Toad running faster and jumping less high made for interesting replays, but they're kinda there in the badges so ya can kinda make the classic builds at least
BEST MARIO GAME EVER
"Wowie Zowie" is my new favorite catchphrase. Now can we get a Luigi Green OLED model when Luigi's Mansion 2 remaster comes out and you surprise us with a secret remaster of the original Luigi's Mansion? Please? Luigi's Mansion is my absolute favorite game. I want a green Switch, lol.
Omg cooooooooooooooooooooooool !!!!!11111111!
Nice 🙂👍
Where is the 35 player battle mode????
I love yoshi's new chad glowup
the live countdown is garbage for every single character
I'm getting Mario 3 vibes
After seeing this direct i immediately pre-ordered it from best buy
Truly the first Strand-type Mario
boring
Honestly this looks terrible
This is the first time in 6 years that im hyped for a mario game
I could make Bowser creepy.
All the levels are gorgeous (love the DKC Returns vibes at 3:30), the animations help bring the personality to the characters, the powerups are very innovative, and the power up transition is super cool. All in all, this is good stuff. I also like that they're sorta acknowledging the Flower Kingdom from that Mario anime movie from the 80s.  Now I wonder if Bowser will turn into an elephant in the final boss fight 🤔
All of this was fantastic! Although, I hope there is an option to adjust the player opacity for online/room play. I would like to see my friends more clearly! Other than that. Perfect. Good job Nintendo!
Love how this game pretty much spat on every Paper Mario game released in the last decade
New NSMB but without NSMB interesting
11:55 Horse riding a horse So wrong! It’s unnatural!
i like it but it feels super overwhelming... like idk theres just a lot going on
this game looks amazing, the art style is just so good
This is trippy stuff dude
man, Bowser turning into that huge fortress (that was first seen in the game's annoucement trailer in the Nintendo Direct june) using the Wonder Flower is definitely the most awesome (but crazy) thing i've ever seen! :D
Playstation 5?🤔🙏🥹🤞🤝
We used to get 8 different worlds in a Mario game
1:51  You just know that Smooth McGroove is going to have a fun time recording covers for this game's soundtrack!
I don’t know why I expected more from this, but this game looks fine
5:15  🤜🤛
Im excited like no other for this game!  But can we please leave a desert world out of 1 game? They are just so boring  all the time. At least make them look unique from each other.
I find it kind of ridiculous that we STILL can't have a traditional online multiplayer experience. Otherwise everything else in the game looks great and like it will be a ton of fun. This is the 2D Mario experience that I have been waiting for over a decade for, so I am super hyped!
That online is gonna be so toxic
Wait, Toadette will be there too? Awesome!
NABBIT
The online is so confusing. It looks like it's just a regular online co-op mode, but they're showing it off like it isn't
0:00 Story 1:44 Flower Kingdom (World's & Courses) 3:47 Characters & Enemies 5:23 New Power-Ups 7:41 Wonder Flower & Wonder Seeds 9:25 Badges 11:15 Play Together (Local & Online Co-op) 14:15 Conclusion & New OLED Mario Switch
Excuse me are you saying we have to fight a CASTLE at the end of the game.
If they don't have a cappy badge they missed an opportunity
I absolutely LOVE the live player shadows and the fact you can revive each other and share items. It just brings so much more life to the game when your playing alone
I hope the world map works more like Mario World than the more linear Mario 3 style. The multiple paths and secret exists gave it more of a feeling of exploration and discovery
Looks fun and man i gotta get me some of that wonder flower lol
I love the idea of the badges.  Changes up the  gameplay, while still keeping it fairly simple and not overwhelming the player with lots of abilities.
"Inflate himself, just like a balloon, this Mario just digs this tune. HUH"
elephant mario riding yoshi is so cute i love it!!!
I hope they’ll add new worlds as DLC (not just a few levels such as the Coin Rush stages in NSMB2 on 3ds, but actual worlds).
Cant wait for zack play thus game and uplaod a video
I love how the characters turn into a ghost version while they await to be revived in muliplayer. Very, slightly creepy, old school Nintendo of them.
This game is about to be a blast!
Super Mario games never disappointed us it's always gets better & better I definitely like this one.👍
Maw Maw
Yoshi’s should take damage. Them not taking damage is just stupid. I would love to play as yoshi but not if it takes away the challenge. 😡
I honestly think the only problem is that it will most likely be super easy.
I’m so hyped for this game
Prince Florian is from Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach
PERKS?!
Has a 2D Mario game ever been voice acted?? It makes me very uncomfortable lol
❤ thank you Nintendo
why can't you enable the local co-op for online play as well? in a post (during, really) covid world, it's harder and harder for friends and families to get together to play games locally together now. as someone in a long distance relationship who was looking forward to playing this with their partner, i am extremely disappointed by the lack of a real online mode.
Is this the second Stranding-type game?
Fecking beautiful
This game is about to be lit and I already pre-order it for just one penny💯 Thank you Nintendo 😊🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🏼
I steadily stop playing Mario 2d games because I felt it was lacking... BUT man... now this might bring me back... so many games to play...
Huston, we have a banger.
oh em gee nintendo
I hope Smooth McGroove is getting some money.
i’m exited for the superstar theme
I love how the order of the worlds isn't generic grass, sand, Water, jungle, etc. etc. It's actually unique and they all are spins on the original types of worlds we see.
*_4:26_**_ why? Just...why._*
Wtf hapened with yellow yoshi tho
Man they really changed up the 2D games for the better. SMBU was just another NSMB game but this here is much more than that.   Feels like the American version of SMB2 but Daisy is here too. Glad Peach hasn't been captured this time either.
Death Stranding's online mode, nice
0:29 I hate that this reminds me of Sticker Star, how one touch on the Sticker Star/Comet caused it to explode and Bowser became ultra powerful from the explosion
This game looks so awesome and fun.
Yay! Now I can have people to play with and help me without the social awkwardness!  I can't wait to play this!
Elephant looks OP, hope does not make the game too easy.
3:34 I  W O N D E R  W H A T  G O O M B A S  T A S T E  L I K E…
Is this meant more for young kids? Sorta Kirby looking difficulty-wise.
don't really like that the Yoshi's are easy mode but I still want this game
Its nice to see nintendo doing something new and exiting!
Bro.
I have a feeling that multiplayer stuff is gonna get so funny, id be avoiding peoples ghosts on purpose 💀
Just seeing Daisy to be playable character make me happy
Absolutely amazing. I thought after the stall of the "New super mario bros" series, the future of 2D Mario games would be exclusively for the Mario Maker games, I genuinely thought there was nothing more to invent in a "regular" 2D Mario. But these guys once again are surprising us. You can never underestimate Nintendo.  P.S: Still sad that we don´t have Charles onboard in this adventure.
and i wonder if you know what it means to find your dreams and i wonder and im back on my grind a
i wanna play as yoshi but i want to be damaged lol
Oh my God! This game looks so much better than I thought! I can’t wait to play it!
The vibe of this game kinda remind me of Inside Story, Dream Team and Galaxy. Feels good
The fact that there’s so much characters to choose from is fun! I wanna play!
This game to me seems pretty inspired by the Mario Galaxy games
🤨 Seriously? This is the next Mario game Nintendo could come up with?
NABBIT IS BACK!! WOOHOO!!!
Flower Kingdom... Now it makes sense Why Daisy is there....  Love the way Daisy says Wowie Zowie
All fun and games till you see the username of a social media acc who called you a weenie. Then it's war
You are doing excellent Nintendo! Keep up the great work and I’ll probably buy this game when it comes out!
6:05 7:23 7:29 14:48 Man, DeviantArt users are gonna be eating good, and that isn't a good thing.
ONLINE!! YES!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH <3
Y O S H I  O N  Y O S H I
Can the Yoshi’s turn in to elephants and also can nabit ‘s
Where is the level creator?
Looks pretty great, but why can’t we do actual co-op online?
Ghost players like in Souls games, sharing items and sending a "Like" as in Death Stranding...interesting inspirarions for a Mario Game 😅
This looks.... Wonderful...
This installment gon be fire 🔥🔥
Daisy! 🌼💛
This comment section must be bots. It literally HAS to be theres just no way.  Game looks great but oh man there are some issues with online multiplayer
I'm kinda upset with this direct, is like spoiling all the playable stuff instead of discovering all from yourself.
this looks so weird and i love it so much
THIS GAME IS AMAZING! It revives all the classic features of past-series games and refreshes the art style while keeping it the same yet adding the new features that I think everyone is happy with. The Mario Red OLED console comes out on my birthday, which I think is pretty cool. Whether you’ve enjoyed older NSMB games, or never even touched one before, this game is a must play for players old and new. ❤❤❤
The only question I have are why does bowser want the wonder flower and where are the other Mario characters like wario, walugia, and Rosalina maybe there are working on another game hopefully
So... Wonder flowers are basically amapolas...
this game seems easy but complicated I can’t wait
Throwing items upward is finally returning! I will never understand why that feature was dropped after SMW.
This looks awesome! Always been a Nintendo fan, always will be. This is gonna rock!
This has got to be one of the best years for gaming
i wish yoshi had power ups
This game looks like its gonna be another banger. I hope there will be badges that add difficultly tho, as I'd love to play Yoshi with some difficulty, maybe a heath system for them.
It’s like Nintendo told the developers to just make it fun! I’m really looking forward to this!
I love how they actually made Mario a “strand-type” game.
Cool
The expression on Yoshi face has me Mario parody makers  engines revving
I see bowser went to the Phil Leotardo School of Turning into Buildings
THE BUBBLE POWER UP FROM THAT MARIO WORLD ROM HACK! HE PREDICTED THE F-KING FUTURE!!
Se ve bueno, saludos desde chile 😃
I wish there was more power ups, especially penguin suit or propeller hat, I know it would ruin the cap glider thing badge but it just awesome, overall game is going to be amazing
this was so worth it watchin it outside 15 minutes straight. this looks incredible i must have it
Yoshi now has back trauma
Dare I say this game actually looks good enough to warrant me owning two 2d Mario games on the same console. And I’m by no means the type of guy to always buy “the new big Nintendo game” every month. So that’s saying something on how great this looks
Let’s go
2:16 Reminds Me of that Auto-Scrolling Clock Themed Level From Mario 3D Land and dont ask me why cuz idk
Looks like Nintendo is dropping another megaton in October.
OH MY GOD!!! LIL' SPARKIES MAKE A RETURN EVER SINCE SUPER MARIO BROS ADVANCE 4 WORLD E AND IF THAT DOESN'T COUNT PAPER MARIO 64! WOOOO!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO!!
the speedrun of this game is gonna be crazy
I freaking can’t wait for this game im literally saving my birthday money on this game and mario rpg too im pre ordering this around October
Glad to see my boy Nabbit returning
👍👍👍👍🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎💯💯💯
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
This is the most wholesome mario game ever, I love every detail of it
wow this looks awesome
Well now we know what to expect when we dive into the unexpected
Im so happy a new mario is finally coming out
I can't wait. Awesome 😎
So glad we can play as Daisy
Oh no. I think I need to buy this game.
everthing is wonderful!!! the new animations, new way to play, and everything, the only thing is that i wanted to play as yoshi and use the powerups xD (i know it would be so broken). Also, the shadow online thing is amazing,
Bowser casually shifting from growing beeg in every game to becoming a huge demon monster to literally turning into a goddamn castle.
Imagine playing the game on a trip
HOLY THATS A GOOD GAME
Why did they bring back lives? I thought those were outtdated for today's gaming?...
I noticed that in the world map, one badge had to do something with spin jumping
So many characters 😂
What the... This game almost seems, dare I say it, GOOD?
I AM SO HYPED
any chance for integrated to super mario maker series?
This game is looking EPIC! Can’t wait till it finally releases, October 20th is looking GOOD!!! 🤩🤩🤩
strand type game btw
how did mario bros get so goofy
We need a new Rayman game to take this direction
This looks so flipping cool. I'm gonna buy this ASAP
I dont know why, but i can already see Peach's elephant form being turned into Rule 34
Prince Florian? WHO’S HE?!!! WHAT THE?!!!
I think it will be a wonderful game. I also like how Prince Florian has the exact same name as the Prince from Snow White.
i haven’t been able to look at bowser and princess peach the same ever since i’ve saw smosh’s mario reunion video
Did they say a badge system from Yoshi woolly world
That nario nintendo switch looks so cool 🎉
Isn’t bubble Mario fan made?
Looks good. The world doesn't look very interesting but gameplay has hopefully improved.  Bowser looks boring though, so finding the villain boring isn't a good sign, nothing can top SMB3 Dark World
Whoever came up with the Elephant power-up needs to go outside for a little bit
Is Nintendo on drugs?
Several of the badges are ripped from Wooly World
Lol at the murder bubbles
Oh god
8:01 so basically they take drugs
I'm upset they made yoshi into an easy mode but everything else looks cool
It could just be because I’m a Kirby fan, but I don’t trust prince florian
I like everything besides the revival system. I don't want the game to be that easy :(  I'd perfer it as a toggle-able option so that I could still see other player's ghosts or my friends' ghosts.
I feel like the entire franchise is getting a makeover with those designs
Omg Nintendo you heard us! 😭🥺 Toadette is both playable and also *not* an easy mode! Yay! This is so hype. Toadette fans are winning :)
The talking flower, man!!! Amazing ❤
i need rule 34 on peach elephant NOW!
I need this
Never thought mario would get a death stranding game
Inflation fetish art coming to deviant art in 3..2..1…
I'm get this!!
Wonder flowers are like crazy psychedelics trips
Arn’t the badges just like items?
0:43 The top of the tower is doing the rock eyebrow raise lol
THEY Brought back my boy blue toad
Honestly pretty sad that in 2023 we don't finally have a 4 player Mario game with full online co-op. Game looks great, but that's a total shame. It's Smash Bros all over again.
I love that Bowser IS the castle, I WONDER how they’re going to turn that into a fight.
I love you can choose invulnerable characters
maaaan i want a Nintendo Switch "Luigi Green"
Amazing Job!!! A New Universe of Super Mario Brothers!!! Well Done 👋👋✌
GOTY 🎉
Mario sponsored by drugs.
This game is too cool it will be unfair for the people who don’t have switch online who just want to play with their friends or just want to help people out
Everything about this new game is perfect! The new art style, badges, and even how they handled multiplayer Co-op and online! Can’t wait to see what it has in store!
6:00 The toads have hats, its not part of their head!
Let me play this game NOW❤
I am glad Nintendo got Smooth McGroove for the soundtrack
This game seems too easy
The game looks great, but Bowser becoming a castle looks really stupid...
Only feature I need to see to be sold on the game is a separate sound setting to mute the flowers
Mario keep doing a Sonic smile
yoshi mouth weird
Nintendo are so lazy. This looks like a GameCube game. They never try something new.
ngl i am so excited i thought it was goofy first time but this looks hella fn
Speedruns of this game will look insanely fun
Nintendo really needs to implement a device and profile rewards system similar to XBOX's achievement system and Playstation's trophy system.  Otherwise, a good deal of players like me are just going to emulate these Nintendo games on PC or Steam Deck.  A rewards system will incentivize players to purchase Nintendo consoles and games.
I hope they make an option to disable the voice of the talking flowers as thats gonna get annoying fast!
Guy notice something there is no timer
New bosses?
THIS LOOKS BEYOND AWESOMEEEE🎉🎉🎉
I love the idea of live player ghosts, i just hope there is normal online coop, similar to local
They added Captain Toad, this game is now worth it 🤌
THEY BRANG BACK YOSHI'S EYELIDS LETS GO
actual game
Castle bowser
ACTUALLY THE MOST CREATIVE 2D MARIO GAME EVER, WE WON‼️🔥🔥🔥
the only real disappointment is that it seems only the Talking Flowers will really talk. i was hoping Mario & co. would be a bit more verbally expressive. otherwise this game looks just nuts. it's gonna be so worth the wait.
PLEASE FIX YOSHI HE LOOKS LIKE AN OLD MAN
Toad has the best elephant form
This game for some reason reminds of spongbob bfbb if it was 2d and i am all for it I loved everything i saw
Obsessed
The online play elements are a really neat idea. Stoked for this!
This is perfect
I think the heart piont counter aint gonna go up anytime
This looks so freaking fun I love the online aspects.
Super mario maker 3 is gonna ruin soooo many social lives.
I really liked this Direct, there's soo many favorite Mario games references in this. Super Mario World, Paper Mario, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Odyssey, Super Mario 3D World.   I really love how Daisy is in this, & how she's got new Power-Ups. I have a feeling they'll be releasing DLC for this not too long after release date they'll add Rosalina as a DLC character.
Ok the prince hyrule rumors are false… or are they
i want elephant peach to sit on me
at 6:10 boss thug: "You all know the rules!"  Thugs: "All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bodied patron in the bar... bar." quote from Spongebob Squarepants movie
mario is on magic flowers now...
this is the second strand type game
Reminds me of Kirby
I’m not gonna lie Mario’s new voice is actually kind of getting better. I hope you get some more news of the Mario, Movie and Mario wonder
This game looks like it was made by someone who watched all of Proton Jon's LPs and made a game with his reactions in mind.
$Niyahbolden12  Help my daughter for her 2nd birthday party please🎉🎉 I would love to get this she just loves hearing the sounds of the game
please tell me you can turn the flowers off, so freaking annoying
I need some clarification, can I play the same way I would in local Co-Op as I would online with my friends?
Blue Toad = Bucken-Berry or Yvan Yellow Toad = Ala-Gold or Wolley
I love you, Nintendo!!!!!! 😍💕
I was not expecting balloon Mario to make an appearance! Looking forward to it!
Definitely getting this.  I would really love to see another Super Mario 3D World, Odyssey, and Super Mario Galaxy!
The main 5 all play the same and no online multiplayer :\
They are so wrong for not allowing player interaction in private rooms
Game seems pretty fine, but why do I get the vibe that it feels less Mario?
looks neat, I'll pick it up after I get my hands on Sonic Superstars
The online shadows are such a Nintendo idea. So adorable!
Elephant Peach is gonna get rule 34'd
Can't wait for this game
Im getting this. And i if i cant, i will cry.
Yoshis fave looks horrible when he eats something
I can’t wait for this game to come out, Oct 20th couldn’t come fast enough.
Mario maker levels would go crazy in this game💀
THE RETURN OF BLUE TOAD  EVERYONE I DONT CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE LEGEND
Elephant peach is real omg
I love this, great for a bigger cast of characters.(Can there be at least one more character that is present?) Love the expressions on all of them, and the actions it shows their consciousness, I'll play the Toads or Yoshis as assistance. More helpful words shown in "read more" text, Toadette will have cute moments with the two playable Toads. When specfically the Toads, can they have a reaction if they land on a enemy, while the Toads doing the sliding animation? Honestly, If Yoshis are being played by a expert or master please protect the ones that can take damage, although they can't take damage; Mario can also not take damage for bumping into a "sleeping" goomba, therefore Yoshis aren't "Easy mode" characters they're relaxable/ease mode characters when playing as them, being hit as any character does make the stunned for a brief period. I saw the controls (It's the most techniqual options shown, the multiplayer synergy potential is __________). Lee weiland Pacific rim athletics shows unique bodyweight concepts that will make people more stronger.
I wish I could just clone myself and play both Wonder, Sonic All-stars and the Pokemon Scarlet DLC at the same time! So many games, so little time!😩
3:34 "I wonder what goombas taste like?" Like a mix of meat and mushrooms. 🥩🍄 3:57 It has been a while, Daisy. 🌼 4:43 The melon piranhas are a neat spin to the classical piranhas. 🍉 8:54 DeviantArt. 👀 I need not say more. 🤐 10:30 Looks very hard to play while invisible. 😵 14:59 Looking real good in red. 🔴👍🏾  All in all, this game is looking wonderfully colourful and fun. ☀🎮
3:34 " I wonder what goombas taste like?" LOL! ❤ 😂
this looks amazing
they finally gave us some more interesting worlds other than the grass, desert, ice, beach, jungle, mountain, cloud, lava that we have gotten from the past 4 2d marios
TOTK, pikmin 4 now mario wonder damn Nintendo is giving us ALL the goodies this year
This game is so cursed lol
Each time they release a new Oled switch.... my hopes of a switch 2 are dashed
Launch this mobile game please
Yeah the direct's great and all but we should absolutely shame them for the elephant princesses
well i'm sold
I wonder when this game will come out
The new super mario bros game looks fire 🔥 as cool my boyb
We need  more cute animal transformation abilities like Bunny form and Squirrel form and Raccoon/Tanuki form and a Cat form that's not a costume but makes the character into an actual cat
Anyone else call wonder mode drug trip mode?
I'm a little skeptical about this game. This seems like a giant step back after Mario odyssey. I'm sure I'm probably wrong I just don't like Nintendo not using their full potential. In odyssey I loved how they mixed the 2d & 3d. I think it was underutilized & could have even more potential how clever it was.
Elephant Luigi: kelm Elephant Peach, Elephant Daisy, Elephant Toad, and Elephant Toadette: *panc*
gonna miss martinet...
damn they makin you op in this game
OH MY GOD!!! Nintendo just NAILED it! I'm speechless...
wii mario bros still the best mario bros game of all time
I like that they actually found a way to make the base idea of a normal mario game into something unique! There's a couple things that I don't like, such as the new toad people in the flower kingdom just look off, the elephant powerup being just way too out there, the talking flowers that are there for no reason😭 but most of the new features are really cool like the online mode. its a cool way to play the game while making it just different enough to have the incentive to play it. the badges are fire too. the wonder flower is kind of weird though, and the bubble powerup is super cool, but a little too overpowered from what is showed. love all the new enemies tho, they really spiced this game up.
I could cry I'm so happy Daisy is finally being included in main Mario games again.
game looks like its gonnna be easy to beat...
I don't get why half the playable characters have to not take damage just put a setting where any can or can't depending on what u want. I will never use yoshi now. Thanks
imagine 12 people playing mario at the same time, that would be so fun
Poor Yoshi's SPINE when he carries an elephant character..... my boy's only so big.....
NABIT!!!!! NANII WHAT THE HECK THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!
The badges are not only gonna be cool for speedrunners to find the best ones and optimize their runs, but it’s also gonna be really cool to see them do categories centered around one specific badge throughout.  The badges are a really awesome idea from a replayability standpoint.
"It's not just mario though! Luigi, the toads, pea-"  "AUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-    OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO."
Finally something similar to how the miiverse worked on the wii U
It won’t top off the OG Wii mario bros. It ain’t the same. Still may be a decent game tho.
(3:19) I truly don't understand why everyone hates these flowers. They're charming and they add an extra layer of depth to the Flower Kingdom. You people complain about Pokemon not having voice acting, yet you want *NO* voice acting in a Mario game.
8:42 he wasn't watching the super mario brothers super show
Part of me wonders why in the world they can't just release a GOOD (64, TTYD) Paper Mario. Like, what is stopping them? Go back to the roots of Paper Mario, and release a new version.
THE BADGES ARE GREAT AND THE POWER UPS AND THE ENEMIES OH MY  GOODDDDD😭😭😭
WE GOT A VS RACE MODE
Omg the bubble flower is a. Real power up now nice
I'm very happy that Nabbit is playable in this game! He's such an underrated character. There's not a lot to him, but I like the idea of a character who isn't very righteous helping Mario and his friends with heroic work.
Love it! Can't wait. However, I'm going to miss Charles Martinet voicing Mario and Luigi...
The drill in this game reminds me of the drill from mario galaxy
wtf, i dont like it, is a phone game
I may often not agree with decisions that Nintendo makes as a company, but they are second to none when it comes to these niche fun games. Bravo!
This is probably the most creative 2D Mario game I’ve seen since the new super Mario bros for wii. There’s lots of new features but yet still hold the spirit of 2D Mario games.
i miss the ice flower. it hasn't been used since its daybue
Love the inspirations from Donkey Kong Country 3 and Bubble Bobble
3:34 ayo 🤨
Super Mario bros wonder is going to be really good to a point where it could be in Super Mario Maker 3 with courses based on Super Mario bros, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros 2,  New Super Mario bros Wii, Super Mario Bros wonder, plus 3D playing field modes
Man, the art style is so good! The mix between oldstyle and new style!
Why do the flowers sound like Sonic?
Man
this game is straight up trash. don’t get this game. it sucks booty 😂
IMA NEED TO LIE DOWN AFTER THIS ONE
Wonder already looked REALLY good, but now it looks better than I ever could have imagined it would be from the first trailer. Nintendo seems to have done a great job!
I LOVE THIS ALREADY 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
TAKE THIS MALSTROM 😅
el juego se ve maravilloso
Elephant Peach has granny panties...
This game about to be WONDERFUL 😄
This is what Mario maker wants to be. Damn good job on this one Nintendo, you did a damn good job.
8:47 - Mario becomes a Coronavirus.
Gonna miss you Charles you freaking legend. Been with us since 64. Take care buddy
Wait... did Nintendo hire Smooth McGroove to do the music of this game with his voice??!
I wish Nintendo owned Megaman and would make these type of games for that franchise 😔
ADD WARIO AND WALUIGI YOU COWARDS!!!!!!!!
I NEED THIS GAME
I would not buy it... 😊
I’m praying boom boom is not in this game
Nintendo just shut everybody who doubted them on the online up. Daaaamn!
Toad got to able to join Smash with these new abilities.
Idk i just dont like the look of this one
MAKE A FREE DEMO TO THE WORLD PLEAAAAAAAAAASE IM DYING TO PLAY IT NOW!!!!!!!
Another reason why Nintendo Switch Online is worth it
The online gamemode actually seems really cool! I do, however, hope that they add a feature to do the same local co-op mode but for online players for the people who want to play normally with faraway friends.
Big fan of these async online capabilities - almost feels like they’ve taken some inspiration from From Software games to work around the often questionable NetCode that affects their synchronous online efforts - very cool
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Bowser got so zooted he ain't even thinking right
mario serie modo wonder
This is cool and all but the *real* question is that is can a yoshi thats being carried by one yoshi, carry ANOTHER yoshi??
2:50 SMOOTH MCGROOVE?!?!?!?!?!?!
now i want this game it looks great
We’re entering a new generation of Mario, and I’m all in for it!
Hey the campsite I go to is named Florian!              We’re gonna miss you Charles Martinet 😢😢
This is…A REAL MARIO GAME.
Actually looks kinda hype
I love that Nintendo learned from Mario Maker’s co-op mode and made it to where you can’t troll people.
I'm spreading? Okay Nintendo, thanks, but I'm not famous.
What a amazing direct!!! Definitely getting this game day 1 to play with family and friends.
He turned himself into a castle.  Wackiest stuff ever.
This game will be revolutionary
I havent been this excited for a Mario since my childhood
we can play  as nabbit! Yayyyy!
The older I get the more kiddish Mario is starting to look.Don’t get me wrong the game looks super fun and I’m definitely going to get it, I just can’t be seen playing it around people my age.
This may actually be the best 2D Mario game. I loved all of that! Especially the online featured! 🎉❤
Finally, I can become a goomba
I love that Prince Florian is some kind of wiggler cousin.
No timer ⏳?     (Jaj)
YAYY!!! TOADETTE!!! OMIGOSH!!! YAY!!!
🙄give us Mario odyssey  2 not this kiddy 💩 Same old game but different features the fanboys eat it up and yey wonder why nintendo is made fun of🙄
I'm sooo ready to have "FUN" with elephant Peach!! lmao
Wow they're so animated in this one
haha... all to show the same game as always with some new things... and sell you another red console!.......only for nintendo fans or rather nintendo sick people!.. ..
No matter how many times they do multiplayer online, they need to just fix their servers
7:15 Guybrush voice actor?
10:02 Just like Super Mario Bros 2!
What what it’s pronounced lock e too i always thought it was pronounced lack a too
Luigi doesn't jump higher?
Wait so bowser fused with an entire castle and can somehow fly? *sigh* yet a wind waker port wouldnt make sense.
the speedruns r gonna be INSANE for this game
I LOVE YOUUU NINTENDOOO
I wonder why Daisy is here? Is she the ruler of the Flower Kingdom?
Mid
Finally blue toad appear
I wish the yoshi’s could take damage. I want the unique play style but I don’t want the game to hold my hand.
It looks really fun, but I just want to make Mario run and jump. Mario doesn’t need any more “changes.”
I really hope the talking flowers become the twist villain of the game.
I know that the koopalings were repetitive but I hope to see them in this game and give them more unique boss battles that actually say something about their personalities
I'm going to enjoy emulating this on my pc.
NO INFLATION MARIO
This probably going to be the best Mario game
Y'know, for apparently being the first set of Mario Bros to not be voiced by Charles Martinet since before SM64, when he had no voice at all, these Mario Bros sure sound extremely close to Charles Martinet's Mario Bros.
Can't wait until I can play this on my STEAM DECK for FREE!!! LOL thanks Nintendo!
This might be their BEST mario game EVER 😮 apart from mario Maker😅
The characters in character select are not animated?
As if I didn't already have enough reasons to buy a Switch!
I want to play this game sooooo bad
The Wonder effect is like being high.
Mario Candy Crush sound
My goodness, whoever is the new VA for Mario and Luigi are absolutely NAILING it. Cannot wait for this amazing game.
I love game already
my brain hurts
4:46 “stick their beaks where they don’t belong”
Is that smooth mcgroove?
Super Mario 2D world + flower’s fury
YOSHI CAN RIDE YOSHI
nice
With the badges I can’t wait to see the speed runs
Why does the narrator sound like Roger Craig smith doing an emo sonic voice
im going to have a blast playing this!
They had fun making this
All my dreams just came true in a 15 minute video, I LOVE THIS GAME ALREADY
That's not a drill power up, this is a Devo form.
This all sounds amazing. The badges add progression and the wonder flowers make sure things dont get stale as easy as they tend to do in 2D mario games. I cant believe im 30 years old and excited for a 2D mario...
this game looks like such flames
Wow, they have no more ideas. Now, there are flowers to give you hints to where there might be a secret.
can we just take a moment to appreciate how nintendo didn’t lock the only girl character to an easy mode? this is shaping up to be the best 2d Mario yet 🍄
is there chris pratt dlc for the mario voice :P
That unmistakable Koji Kondo overworld theme that plays at the end of the video 🤌🤌🤌
Nabbits Back!
That switch is a literal one for one copy of the previous Mario one. Major let down.
This game looks amazing
This game needs 60fps support but sadly is a switch, so yuzu 😮.
Looks great! Thanks nintendo
So glad they changed the style of the Mario Games. I think it was much needed after all the mario maker levels.
The online features are crazy. Reviving each other?!
SO DOPE!
Thank you Nintendo and Charles
GIVE ME IT I NEED IT NOW! ITS SO AMAZING I CANT WAITTTTT
This game will 100% be inflation fetish awakenings for some people
Dang I loved this direct
I have a question though! can wonder effects and powerups also affect the characters that don't normally take damage?
Wow I’ve already seen enough all brand new animation and levels then when I saw online I was blown wow this is the game of the year they gived so many potential to the game this is a day one buy it makes much more new ideas for next generation games
the first strand type mario game
WHY IS THE POWERUP RESERVE THE JUMP BUTTON D:
11:57 Yoshi Abuse 2: Electric Boogaloo
OMG AWESOME😃😃😃
This game would be good
Imagine having a 12 player
NABBIT!!!!!!!!!
Thanks nintendo this the mairo game ive been waiting for best gaming year ever!
This game is really weird.
Bro, just imagine being able to have having a 10 player or a 11 player if there’s two toads
Did we really need a 15 minute direct for just one Mario game? Even with new features this was so unneeded. zelda TotK's made more sense because of all the creating combos, but was also unneeded. Its a mario game, you jump and collect stuff. 1-2 3 minute trailers should be all that's needed.
ON VEUT DU ANIMAL CROSSING ! 🤎
NO ONLINE CO-OP HAHAHAHA
yoshi badges ong
I can't wait to play as Daisy!
I am hyped for this game but am gonna miss the new super Mario bros art style as I think Mario looks too kiddy when the characters are overly expressive. I think that’s something that works better in the sonic franchise. I also am going to miss killing eachother and speedrunning the stage so the other players die.
now this i a *wonderful* game haha get the joke yeah i’m not gonna say jokes
We lost a world
This game looks SO FUN
As an Elephant, Luigi's bulge is now twice the size it usually is.
I’m super excited for this game so I can play it with my brothers
This looks fun but I wonder when Mario's getting a new 3D installment.
Did Bowser literally go "reject humanity, become building"?
i realy like artist game like that
omg NEEEEEEEEEED
Being back the Crown Mushroom for Yoshette, Mariette, Luigette, Daisette, the Returning Peachette, & Peachette-Ette But Sadly no Nabbette.
I'm surprised to see so many people being excited about this game as if were something they have never seen before. I remember being excited when I saw Mario in 3D for the N64 the first time, then I got excited to see him with much better graphics on Gamecube and then on Wii. But now, I only see a copy of a copy. I hope they see this and try to work on a new Mario title that surprises EVERYONE as Mario 64 did. Something new, creative, different and amazing. I know they can do it. I hope they do it.
WARIOLAND SUPER JUMP IS BACK!
#1 trending!!!!!!
Is it just me or do the Maw-Maws look like a pokemon
Give me it now!!!!!!!! :) ITS SO GOOD!
Disappointed that out of all the new characters Wario and waluigi aren’t available. They better make a new Wario land game!
This game is going to be absolutely amazing. It includes so much stuff that wasn’t included in the other 2d Mario games.
BLUE TOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this'll be what may be one of the best 2D platformers that nintendo has ever released yet  can't wait to try out the online mode too
So excited to play this game more than ever! it looks so incredible!!!
Cannot believe they have snubbed Rosalina like this! XD But maybe she'll be an unlockable, like in Super Mario 3D World.
Seeing daisy be accessible after 20 or years of not being a selectable character is quite relieving, I wonder what her unique abilities are
Is it crazy that I’m thinking about buying this over spiderman 2😬😂
the soundtrack for bowser turning into the castle goes way too hard for such a goofy topic
Smooth McGroove is in the soundtrack?? @SmoothMcGroove ??
Can you Ride Mario or Peach as Yoshi?
Truly a fresh take on the original game's mechanics.
4:08 OMG
The speed runs are ton a be nuts
This game is gonna be so sick.
I’m totally having a moment right now.  I am NOT a game person, but my older brother is and all my life he has tried to get me into something.  Mario Brothers is like the only game we both have always bonded over and we’ve played all the games as the years have passed.  This.  New.  Trailer of Mario my brother has not seen it yet and he doesn’t know about this AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS NEW GAME FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!🎉😱✨🥳😭🥲
RIP to throwing your brother off the course to die
This game looks wonder-ful! …sorry, had to😅
I cannot wait for this game. The game looks great and I can't wait to play. I only hope that the ice flowers in the game and you can turn the flowers voice off because I feel like they're going to annoy me. Edit: Im shocked theres not an 8th world.
Bowser: Touches the wonder flower  Also Bowser: BECOMES THE DEATH STAR
Bummed that the characters don't have different stats, but overall it looks pretty awesome. Glad to see that Nintendo is overhauling the game and excited to see the full release
This one looks fun for everyone, silly, and the no damage with Yoshi and Toads will make it way easier for anyone to play
The online mode, despite them stating it's not direct, is essentially the normal local mode!  Think about it, You help out other nearby players by being a checkpoint, You can share items with your team mates, You can even play with friends in basically the same way as normal!  The only thing that doesn't apply is riding Yoshi, but regardless this might be the best Multiplayer (and single player) Mario experience I've seen in a while.  (no wonder they called it the next SMB3!)
Amazing! Imagine if it was in the super Mario world graphics as well? 😍
That's a lot of Playable Characters
The online is looking better than SMM2’s! I live to see the day when everyone has the kind of WiFi that game required so this is good for now!
Elephant peach r34 gonna be crazy
so, it is voiced by mario dubber or already replaced?
Wow! This looks amazing.
bowser castle goes hard
Crouching high jump badge reminds me of super Mario bros 2 (aka dokey dokey panic)
I "wonder" what's going to happen next?!
Smooth McGroove!!!!
Sonic is better in my opinion
mario 3/world vibes
Blue toad exists  Yoshi is playable  This game will be awesome
I haven't been this excited for platforming Mario game since, Super Princess Peach.
Mario's back and he's better than ever
Elephant Mario on Yoshi— that’s one thing I cannot unsee… poor Yoshi.. subjected to countless deaths via sacrifice (or on purpose as demonstrated by many streamers) but now being sat on by something 20x the weight? Haha oh my..
This aired on the same day as the Devil Survivor protagonist (Kazuya Minegishi)’s birthday! Neat!
I thought the Flower Kingdom was Sarasaland aka the home of Princess Daisy ? Poor Daisy losing her titled kingdom   to a nefarious Prince and Bowser of all things. You finally give Daisy her moment  to shine and cheat her at the same time
Super Mario Maker 3 will be so crazy
Taban de la wander flower.
They took standees from death stranding lol
This game looks like Mario on drugs
This looks like the best Mario yet!! They absolutely nailed the art, continuity, theme, all of it looks fantastic!! Wahoo!!🎉🌼🍄❤️
I'm extremely happy for you Mario fans. This game looks CRAZY FUN!
Dude, is that Smooth Mcgroove?
The co-op element looks so fun. Reminds me of soul games with being able to see other players, but way more wholesome.
I'm curious if this direct will make me buy a game I was previously gonna skip 🤔 After Watching: Mabye? The best part of the direct was the yoshis but I wish there was a way to play as a yoshi that takes dmg. Going to have to wait for reviews on the game itself though.
Lars's trash can snare strikes again
THIS. GAME. IS. SICK!
THIS LOOKS SO UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING
Glad they put Online Co-op in this. Would have been a terrible choice to leave it out.
is anyone else offset by the elephant forums?
This looks exactly the same even the characters
I like badge system in this game makes the game much more interesting and fun.
Poor Yoshi trying to carry that elephant! D:
A star is born.
I really really hope that it's at least a little bit challenging.
My grandmother is so excited to play this😊
Cool Mario game, I like it.
So happy Daisy is getting some love! Hopefully they give some to Waluigi as well. 😌
Is this a real game? It sounds like a fan fiction... I mean - "Super Mario Bros. Wonder"... C'mon... That just sounds laughable...
Yoshi no podrá usar poderes?😢
I can already see the elephant peach fan art
The way mario gets electrocuted is hilarious i mean seriously he went “HOUHUHOHOUHOUHO”
Buuuuuuuu 👎no está charles martinet  Buuuuuuu
Game looks incredible and i cant wait to play, however i still think releasing it at the same time as Spider-Man 2 is a bad choice.
I wonder what the DLC would be like.
LAHKITUS 😭
Why did they have to make yoshi easy mode 🤦🏽 I just want to play yoshi normally
Is the music by Smooth McGroove?!
Cuando sale
i love this
OMG LOOKS GOOFY AND I LOVE IT
Live Shadows is how you make online Co-Op Nintendo do its again! 👏
Finally a new switch
Looks epic
I really wished the kingdom was Daisy's because we never saw her home
Live player shadows is a really cool concept. Reminds me of how you interact with other players in Death Stranding.
This looks amazing!!!!!!!!! 😮😮😮😮😮
The new Bubble power-up reminds me of the Blue Baby Yoshi from New Super Mario Bros U
Best believe, If I could like this video 100000000x times, I would 😭😭😅
I CAN BE YOSHI NOW I CAN RIDE YOSHI ON A YOSHI
Elephant luigi
4:10 The fact yoshi and nabbit can't be hurt is just sad because i realy like nabbit but what is the point in playing him if i can't get hurt? The game would be to easy.
I wonder what goombas taste like????
Flower kingdom huh? Isn’t that where Daisy is also from?
Oooooh intimidating Bowser! wonder what the final boss'll be like...
Nintendo please add online co-op 🙏🏼 please! The game will be 10/10 is this online feature gets added.
Why did this phonomenal looking game have to come out on the same day as Spider-Man 2?
Donkey Kong Tropical freeze is better.
8 hours
I need Ice flower
I feel like maw maw should be a fairy type Pokémon u know the sweet sugar one
10:16  Luigi: "I'm gay!!"
This looks really cool. Kind of a bummer that Yoshis are restricted to no damage mode tho.
This game looks so good
Next game:      MARIO GALAXY 3 OR MARIO 3D ALL STARS VOLUME II  for switch   with games    Mario galaxy 2  Mario 3d land  Mario 3d world
finally they've put their intrest back into Super Mario i'm exited it looks like a polished game experience it will likely get about 4 years of updates and support buy it i feel like it's worth it thanks so much Nintendo, Very Goood Job!
peach as a elephant is the last thing i wanna see
It's a Mariovania
Just counted, there are TWELVE playable characters for this game, correct me if I’m wrong but that is the biggest cast to play as in a play former Mario game
They added the Fortnite augments to this game? Wow!
I’ve been waiting for the next game. Put it in Mario maker and Nintendo’s winning (idek how it’d have everything)
I stand by it, this is just an overly complicated mario maker theme waiting to happen.  It's not new soup but it's not by any means an impressive game. At best it's a solid 2d platformer mixing in a handful of great mechanics from across the genre and polishing them up a bit, but it is nothing more than that.
Yoshi riding Yoshi?!? I'm in. 12:25
W
Ayo i dont think florian is a benevolent guy
8:52 *UH OH*
Imma be honest, i love bowser being associated with rock now, along with him being associated with big bad orchestra
Gonna be honest, I'm not a Mario fan, I played a bit of the original 8 bit Donkey Kong, Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros when I was young, liked them to a degree. After I bought the Switch I tried the Odyssey, definitely a great game but didn't grab me for more than few hours, but GOD DAMN you may bet I'm buying this one!!! Gameplay looks super fun. Probably gonna kindly force few friends to play it with me one way or another :)) The only thing that bothers me is a quite noticeable slowdown during the trailer, old fella Switch gotta go to rest sooner or later...better sooner since it's barely holding. We're ready, Nintendo, go for it!
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
the style looks super great
This seems lame considering the Switch is aged. We need new hardware already. Can't compete with today's handhelds.
I love how the charge jump pays homage to Super Mario Brothers 2.
Side order where ?
But why the elephant though. What crazed mind thought of it up lol.
What do the heart points do? Can you spend them?
Hold on, so Luigi, toad, and Peach won’t have their signature abilities? Still looks like an amazing game though.
New súper Luigi long legs 2
Present 8 hours
It's the same game as every other last 10 side scrollers
This looks the same as the terrible new super mario bros
There better be a rainbow road
This game looks so unbelievably fun, I know it's wishful thinking and maybe asking too much but imagine a Mario Maker 3 made of this stuff, all these mechanics look so fun
I can't decide if this looks like a completionist's dream or nightmare.
will wario be in super mario bros wonder?
This looks wonderful!
Imagine when fan made rom like newer will be created 🤯
LETS GO YOU CAN BE HIGH IN MARIO!!!
Wow.  This is excellent.
Nintendo was definitely cooking in the kitchen and in turn made a 5 star meal. Not only you get to play as 12 different, badges to equip for your characters, online multiplayer, smooth animations, and a fresh interesting story (at least for the Mario games), and so many more like the transformations and the power ups. This is a true evolution of the 2D Mario games, I’m so excited for the game to come out now more than ever now!   Also I did not expect something like this to happen but poor Yoshi lol 11:58
All the characters play the same? What? 😅 no distinction between characters jump/run/float capabilities? Why tho?
THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!
CANT WAIT
IM SOOO EXCITED!! I CANT WAIT 🫶🏾🫶🏾 NINTENDO LITERALLY MADE NY WISHES FOR THIS GAME COME TRUE WITH EVERYTHING THEY SHOWED HERE ^_^!!!
this game looks genuinely incredible. the fact they managed to turn mario into an mmo is so insane and even crazier that it works. the only part i hate is how the oled model is just red with a mario silhouette and some coins.
this looks fun!
I bet that online ghost feature its just as fake as the mobile mario kart feature, its Nintendont we are talking about
Lots of fun ideas but this game does seem pointlessly easy at times. I understand the desire to create a game which appeals to everyone but it's not like kids or non-gamers are stupid.
Super excited for the game but sadly I think we’re not gonna be seeing much of the koopalings anymore, rip Roy :(
The amount of imagination in Nintendo's games are simply unmatched.  Im currently playing through luigis mansion 3 for the first time and its magical.
shut up and take my money
HAHAHA, YES THE CATERPILLAR IS JUST A CATERPILLAR MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED THANK YOU MIYAMOTO FOR MAKING PRINCE FLORIAN JUST A CATERPILLAR AND NOT HAVE ANIME CONNECTIONS
This might be the greatest 2D mario game oat
I'm really looking forward to this game & I can't wait to get it! However, I still WONDER (See what I did their?) who are Mario & Luigi's new voice actors? Lastly I really don't think that new Nintendo switch OLED model is worth it as double red Joy cons exist. Still excited cuz I got the game!  ...Looks like I'll need Blue Toad, Toadette & Nabbit figures for my Mario Wonder figure display as well  Edit: I finished my Mario Wonder display, I will show it off in community posts & Kevin Afghani off to voice the Mario bros!
Soul
The fact this is the first mario game to have the chachters ACTULLY die should make it E10+
Its a bit weird that we can create room to play as ghost in each others level but not to play  normally. Anyway, ill have fun for sure !
This game absolutely evolves everything about 2D Mario in every possible way best. I’m most certainly getting this amazing game. I’m so excited to try everything out! Nintendo went all out here!
when the warioware direct
God LOVED you so MUCH that He sent His only son to die in YOUR PLACE so you won't have to die under Gods judgement but live forever IF you fully trust in Jesus, now that he's risen. Please repent 🙏🙏🙏
6:05, 10:18, and 14:48
jesse
I am supposed to be doing a presentation on gene therapy but instead I am enjoying the complex lore of Super Mario Brothers Wonder  WAIT THESE NEW FEATURES AS SO GOOD
This game looks nuts and I love it
YESSIR blue toad in the game.  They copying A hat in time with the badge thing but I aint compalinin
Big large elephants riding small Yoshis, let's make sure I saw that right
7:18 Did Daisy just dab?
This game looks bonkers!
WAIT HE IS THE SHIP ITSELF??????
Super Mario is a painfully overrated franchise.
looks incredible!
I hope they have different hats or something to customize
elefant toad looks adorable I have good expectations for the game
0:39 Love the Mario 64 Bowser Theme reference there, it's my favorite Bowser Theme.
I like all the references to all the previous games! good job👍
This is the second ever strand-type game
This game looks a blast and just incredible. After Mario and Zelda's amazing latest entries it's a real shame The Pokemon Company and Game Freak don't (aren't able) to put the same effort and creative design into new Pokemon titles. Guess great things can happen when you have longer than a year to make a game...
Bro the game looks so sick! Speaking from it, the kingdom map also looks epic enough, as we can see that Nintendo kinda mixed up w1 and w2 from the past games into a solid distinct w1
Why tf did that guy pronounce Lakitu like LOCKeetoo, also kinda lame that it isn't actual online co-op, also WOW they sure weren't shy with literally showing a large majority of the game in terms of spoilers ig idk
This is STUFFED with content, cant wait
They have totally nailed it with this version maybe out doing Super Mario Bros. 3 as the greatest 2D Mario ever!!!!
Ok this has to be the weirdest thing bowser has done yet
wowie zowie
12:38 lmao the framerate
I was already excited before.. now I'm SUPER excited! I can't wait to play this game!
Dude this really seems like an evolution of Mario itself and all they had to do was give Mario every drug in the book. In all seriousness I’m really excited about this game.
Bowser's facial animations and expressions are gorgeous
Since no one else will say this I will! I am so glad the Princess does not get kidnapped in this game. She's been getting kidnapped numerous times for at least thirty five years and not only does she avoid that same damsel in distress fate here you get to actually play as her. Princess Peach will be my first choice for sure so she can finally be more involved as a character other than a kidnap plot.
Ok am I the only one who thinks bubble mario is op
"I wonder what goombas taste like..." 😮
Rumor was they were gonna bring up a new Switch . . .
I was WONDERing what was happening!
Please tell me you can turn off live player shadows
Add real online multiplayer for once
Aww man, no amiibo?!
5:03
Nintendo, você não cansa de carregar a indústria dos games nas costas? 👏
OMG I've never seen so much newness in a single game, mainly a mairo game in the classic style... this time they really outdid themselves, I thought there's even too much stuff kkkkkkk I'm crazy to play
I’m so happy
I'm can't wait to buy this Super Mario Wonder game and Switch OLED this holiday ❤. Want to upgrade my Switch Lite that I bought early this year with BOTW, Final Fantasy 12 ZA & TOTK ❤
Time to carry the game with blue toad
It’s been a real long time since I’ve been this excited for a 2-D Mario game
Bubble form be like "MARIOOOOO! TAKE MY HAMON!!!!!!!"
Look at all the playable characters gawd dayum 🥹
ALL HAIL B.O.W.D.O.K.
When wave 6 releasing?  Also TOADETTE!!!!  I’m now legally required to make Toadette the sole dictator of the Flower Kingdom.
Easily the greatest Mario game ever. Can't believe this plumber has been impressing me for over 3 decades now. 🥲
Why did they have to give yoshi an underbite while holding something it just looks bad. Also why does Nintendo hate Yoshi on Switch? Crafted World is a slogfest, he has the worst dice in Super Mario Party, and now he's stamped with 'this is the easy mode'
I feel like people are gonna exploit power up swapping for speedrunning and glitches
Looks good, except for the usual stupid lack of online co-op.
I hope they add an option to play as yoshi or nabbit but still take damage. I would love to do a second playthru as a character that behaves differently
I absolutely LOVE the live player shadows and the fact you can revive each other and share items. It just brings so much more life to the game when your playing alone
Ehhh pass
FAT MARIO LETS GO
Fun fact, the yellow Yoshi on the cover is actually an old render
this is AMAZING
darn the yoshis are the easy mode well now i don't to play as them.   but hey, other than that the game looks lovely.
It's like Super Mario World 2
lmfao i love the story here
so what are the odds that this new mario console was the console that was being talked about in the leaks?
8:30 the top down view of your player is really trippy. It’s like 3D world with a 2D perspective if that makes sense.
I like it but I want Yoshi get power up
I hope this game takes a long time to beat.
"In this presentation, we'll go over what's new in Mario's latest side scrolling adventure, the Super Mario Wonder game!"  _such as Mario's voice actor?_
New mario maker is bout to be crazy
I haven't played a side scrolling Mario game in decades but this might be the first one I wanna actually play :)
The online looks kinda bad. You're basically playing local/single player but you can see your friends and or Randoms. The only sort of interaction with others there is that you can revive them and give them power ups.
It was brief, but Kamek is here! So glad he’s present, people can’t forget that he was the original main advisor for Bowser. He’s an awesome right-hand man.
Everyone knows this but he said that the name wrong 5:19
These are GENIUS additions to the Mario sandbox - every single one!
poor yoshi hes gonna break his back
"Lockytoo"
First Bowser became big...then a skeleton...then a nightmare creature...then a dragon...then a Godzilla ripoff twice...and now a giant castle. Who needs last breath sans and tricky when you have this mfer...
This game looks so damn good!
It's fitting that Daisy would make her first mainline appearance in a game about the 'Flower Kingdom' since she's named after a flower lol.
13:36 so it’s like 2d mario + sky: children of the light because other players can help you and you give them hearts in return. That’s really cute.
Wow this looks so cool! Excited to get it when it comes out!
StanDEEZ NUTS
This looks like the burst of fresh air 2D Mario needed. Seems like it is filled with creativity in every corner. Looks awesome!
Sonic Superstars 100% Better 🥱🥱🥱
Love the idea that Daisy is finally a playable character in this game. I just hope that she's not a secret unlockable like Rosalina was in Super Mario 3D World.  I'd like to play as Daisy from the start.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
4:27 what’s with yoshi’s face!!! Lol
This game looks absolutely amazing
I saw all new models for every character at 1:31, but that yellow yoshi was just a png from the 2000's era
The RE8 baby is now Mario canon
At first, I'm really excited for this game! Until when I saw that people can place these checkpoint like things. It was at that moment I realized how much trolling that would be. Sheer chaos. MAW HA HA HA HA HA HA!
Yuzu time
this looks SO COOL!
please tell me the vocals for the music is Smooth McGroove
As a fan of mario 3d world I love this
So much about this game looks so exciting! The style, the music, the level themes, the gimmicks, the Badge system… it’s all so fresh. Some things are weirding me out though. It seems like there’s a push to make the gameplay more homogeneous between characters. Classic differences like Luigi being a better jumper than Mario (but a little more clumsy) are no longer in place. It’s cool that novel characters like Daisy are here, but what’s the point if every character is identical, unless you want the easy mode character? It loses an element of strategy this way.
This looks quality and I'm so looking forward to playing this with the my two kids and wife! Keep up the great work nintendo!!
CASTLE BOWSER
This isn’t a problem, but I just noticed the online is pay to win.
14:30, hey captain toad is back.
damn this game is gonna be good 😭
9:21 no "Just what I needed"
Pre ordered already. My daughter is so excited to play as Daisy!
can you just play normally online or is it just races lol
Can’t wait to ruin friendships with the online race mode.
THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE PEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow this might be the most content rich and unique Mario game to date. Only real problem I see is it looks to easy
what a game
YOWIE WOWIE
7:56 I got cought up in the money *cough* the power - Big Smoke
So the wonder flower is basically shrooms
#1 Trending!
Man, I hope Wario and Waluigi get added in DLC
What a FABULOUS Direct! Definitely can’t wait for this game!😆
“Magic Mushrooms? Nah, We got Wonder Flowers”
this is dumb lol dosent even seem like a mario
People watching this: wow this game look so cool, I can’t wait to play it!  Elephant peach: never mind
I hated the wii U's super mario bro and think they're utter garbage so I brushed over this at first, but after watching this video I think Nintendo are fixing their mistakes and are going back to making Super Mario side scrollers great again, this game looks amazing
Mario rpg, Paper mario sticker star, color splash, and now this can bowser ever catch a break
If only other nintendo games got this level of creativity…
The characters all playing the same, the game is instantly dead to me. No longer excited in the slightest, absolutely not buying.
Yo this direct is extremely awesome yo like Oh My God I’m so Hyped for this game everything about it looks amazing I can’t wait till it releases😆😆
Is it just me or the characters look shorter kinda like Mario RPG style but yet again we are getting a remake of that which might be why since there in development around the same time now.
This is the next Death Stranding style game
WE ALREADY HAD AN ENEMY THAT DID EXACTLY THAT!  *holds up a skipsqueak*
M O O L A H
Now, we actually need to answer  What do Goombas actually taste like
9:37 Guess we found who took Overwatch's skill tree
I am so happy that finally Mario feels fresh again! We've been stuck for way too long in the now ironically called "new" super mario bros games. Thank you Nintendo! <3
Dang i wanted elephant daisy shown
This new game is promising a lot...
On an unrelated note, if geometry dash 2.2 releases on oct 20 im gonna scream
i was hoping theyd officially announce who the new vo is :/
All around looks really great. Love the amount of playable characters and the art style is a massive improvement. I just wish they'd have an option to play as Yoshi but still take damage.
They eliminated toxicity
so this game is mixed with paper mario with Zelda , and alice in wonderland inspired
need bowsette to be canon
This game will be like tropical freeze
Shame they didn't say "Bload" and "Yoad" and just said one of two toads
Bowser is literally the Castle! lol
The last thing we want is the NPCs speaking out loud
This going to be amazing game
I’m curious as to how the final boss will play out. Bowser is merged with the castle. Maybe we’ll have to enter the castle and beat Bowser from the inside?
It's amazing how much expression and personality this game already has compared to the NSMB games.
cool game but why do our friends have to be invisible when we play with them? the live shadows ghosts for randoms makes sense.  online play at all is good but come on.
I genuinely can’t believe I’m saying this, but playing with friends or strangers indirectly online is somehow better than direct online multiplayer in my opinion
Super Mario Bros finally makes a return after 35 years. This looks so classic
This Game Is WONDERFUL !
it's looking like a real follow up to mario world finally dropped (i love yoshi's island but i wouldn't say it was a mario world 2 lol)
This game looks really inspired and I love it!
They didn’t protect this weapon of mass destruction very well from Bowser at all
Bright off the bat everybody knows that we're done with that Mario saves the princess crap if those Yoshi's didn't run up after them we would all be out
I wonder what would happen if everyone was playing as a Yoshi and if its possible to have a Yoshi stack
This looks like fun
The power ups look insane. I am so ready to lose hours playing this game!
Are koopalings gonna be there
Fuuuuu...sion...hoooo
Not a big fan of the talking flowers with peoples actual voices and words. Why not do it like odyssey???
Shut up and take my money
Did they get smooth mcgroove to do the music? It literally sounds just like him
The narrator sounds like crap he almost sounds like he's being sarcastic
Is that Smooth McGroove doing the overworld at @2:49 ?
i hate the talking flowers lol
Basically nabit and yoshi are easy mode for players 😂
There better be a Mario maker update after this to finally fill in the spot next to 3D world…
I love how the person playing the game is named David
Everything about this game is perfect, they finally got some original amazing looking enemies, and the word map looks so awesome
I’m excited
Bowser really said MR ELECTRIC SEND HIM TO THE PRINCIPALS OFFICE AND HAVE HIM EXPELLED
Looks cool, only thing that disappoints me is all characters play the same except for easy mode
Also I'm obviously picking yoshi when I get this game
R.I.P blue toad 😢
its funny how its still your standard forest desert ice volcanoe rocky mountains type beats
I simultaneously love and have the talking flowers
Wait so Mario wonder is 3D and 2D now? Nice!
The Elephant power makes me physically ill looking at them and we're definitely still in the "It's Weird It's Not Charles" period but other than that the game looks really cool.
I can't wait to play it
This game looks and sounds INCREDIBLE
can you ride yoshis???
I just want to know who the new VA is
Yooo Nabbit is back
This was SOOOOOO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤ LOVE IT CANT WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT!!!!!!
Please make this a gamemode in Mario maker 2 in like 2 months of realese
Obvious day 1 purchase. Not even gonna watch this lol. Just need to know the date it releases and where I can preorder lol.
The only reason I may buy a switch before the next new console is this purpose. The New Super Mario bros series introduced me to Mario, and it will always be my ultimate fav game series ever❤
oh nahhh they brought back nabbit  Edit: hey atleast blue toad is here
We'll be playing 😎
I love all the little details of the animation. But aside of that it looks like the old game with a couple new power ups.  Not as hyped as I hoped I'd be.
this game looks insane already!
I haven’t been so interested in a 2d Mario for a long time
I cannot wait to speed run this
This game looks absolutely fantastic! Can't wait to play it when it comes out!
Mario X death stranding
Bowser becomes the Devil Gundam
I’m just happy to see they’re finally thinking outside the box for Super Mario!
This game actually looks fun, can’t wait to see the new game in action when it comes out
No online is a deal breaker. My friends live far away. I need to have online. Now my only option to play with friends is Yuzu and Parsec. This is a huge fail from Nintendo there isn't online co op. This is on top of them charging for online.
What I love about this game: -The power-ups have more features than before -The variety in playable characters -The improved animations -The elephant's cry being subtly incorporated into the sound effect for its powerup -The Dark Souls jolly coop -The gay flowers
is this the new Mario VA or is it still Charles?
I need a full version of the trumpet overworld theme right now 13:45
They said prince floraian is malevolent, whats that supposed to mean Nintendo 🤨
Contexto del juego: si tocas una flor que brilla te drogas
Definitely going to be my favorite 2d Mario EVER! THANKS NINTENDO!
WHAT DID THEY DO TO BOWSER????????????????????
I’M DEF BUYING THIS HOOOOOLY!
8:53 NOT AGAIN, DEVIANTART ALREADY HAD THE P BALLOON NOOOOOOO
I'm so glad that Nintendo is doing something so new, unique, and refreshing with Mario. The new mechanics, enemies, characters, artstyle, and music is such a great thing to see, and I'm so glad that Nintendo is taking this direction with this game. This is looking to be truly the best Mario game.
the bubble powerup really shouldof been a recolored cloud powerup
bLUE TOAD
they werent holding back when making this game
I like how the online play works. It's not 1:1 with the local co-op but it's still multiplayer
That jump sound effect is awful
bro reallyed copyed cuphead 11:31
This game looks epic Cant wait to play it
Bowser's-a Castle
This is so awesome!
NO PRINCE HARU NOOOO
Nintendo finally releasing a Mario game worth buying
Is it Smooth McGroove the one who "sings"?
Can you push your friends in the game?
No Bowsette. No thank you.
When he said "plus a new Nintendo Switch" I was so ready for it to be the most randomly placed Switch 2 announcement of all time. xD
Why Can’t The Yoshi’s Get Killed At Get Power-Ups Like Nintendo I Wanted To See A Freaking Yoshi Elephant That Would Be Hot
They really liked Death Stranding's like system.
Why is it that when Peach uses the elephant power up, she looks kind of like the mammoth named Peaches from Ice Age?
it looks fun but it also looks super easy from what was shown here I hope it is still playable if you are over 10 years old
Rejoice blue toads back!!!
I was already considering getting this game based on the first trailer we saw in that Nintendo Direct a couple of months ago. Now, I'm definitely getting it! What a nice breath of fresh air for the Super Mario Bros. series. This will be a blast!
NO ROSALINE!? NAHHHHHHHH
I CALLLED TOADETTE.......poor Rosalina though  P.S - Glad to see Nabbit here
Looks amazing😮😮😮😮😮 so is the wonderful some kind of drugs?
This looks like the best Mario game ever!
This is the best day of my life!!
Nintendo try not to make great games challenge (99.9% fail) TOADETTE IS IN HERE! YEAHHH! But I can smell the Deviantart Elephant Peach art already...
I desperately hope the voice acting for the flowers isn't really in the game. The visuals also seem really... I dunno, I hate to say forcced soul, but that's how it feels. Aside from that, I'm pleasantly surprised and can't wait to play.
THEY MADE PEACH AS AN ELEPHANT NOO THE FAN ARTS GONNA BE CURSED
I wonder what goombas taste like
It’s a very ballsy move to release this game the same day as Spider-Man 2
It seems like they are doing things right for the first time in some time! Don't remind me of Mario Strikers...
"LAW-kee-TOOS"
6:53 reused idea from Mario Kart 8?
Microtransactions...awesome.  Just what I've always wanted in my Mario games.... 🙄
El Wonder no es un efecto de drogas
Smb3 was game that got me in gaming, i Wonder do folks @ Nintendo really eat hallucinogenic shrooms cuz this is crazy in a Mega good way!
Bubble seems a bit op I mean, CREATING PLATFORMS ANYWHERE ?! So cheese...
Super Mario bros: rayman
WHY DID THEY MAKE ELEPHANT PEACH WERE DOOMED
The standees are literally just Nintendo giving 100% speedrunners the finger
Wow! Even newier super mario bros looks great! This game surprised me because I thought the replayability was not going to be that good but with those badges I think we will be having tons of fun with the different challenges we come up with using the badges!
To bad i sold my switch lol Btw i sold it in case they anounce the new console so that i can still sell it for a good amount.
Bowser need uh wonder nutt 🥴
No damage with some characters??? WTF
This Direct is awesome
This is so adorable and i'm so excited for it, it really seems like a passion project
I loved when bowser said “It’s bowser time” and then bowser’d everywhere
BLUEBTOAD
Blue toad is back boys
Bro piggy back yoshis!! i'm getting this for sure
awsom
It looks like fun for a night but I cant see myself playing it unless there is a challenge.   The Stand ins,  powers on top of powers, and a literal easy mode turn me away.  If there is challenging levels I wish you would advertise them too.
Seeing blue toad as a elephant just made my day happier❤
When is the splatoon 3 side order direct????
YOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥
damn i kinda feel old playing this series game at 2016, goodbye charles hope you okay somewhere there👋👋
11:31 oh, didn't i see something like that before?
I can't wait to buy this game
It's great to see Daisy, an enthusiastic fan of flowers, finally get access to a fire flower outfit.
Fun and happy vibe. Definitately getting this.
They took all the drugs when they came up with this game
Absolutely Fantastic! Can't Wait to Play this!
I'm surprised that there's online gameplay! Now time to convince my friends to get this.
I don’t like yoshis’ model when he has something in his mouth
woah! the badges are a real game changer! I don't think i ever expected passive upgrades to be in a mario game, but I'm very happy to see them!
10:07 Not even Super Mario is free from the hookshot curse.
Mario 🎉
predicting it now, final boss battle will include picking up a wonder flower that turns mario into a castle
❤
What about wario and waluigi? Can I play as them?
I love how they slightly squished down luigis head, he looks great
No real online? That's lame.
Disappointing that people who like Yoshi are locked into easy mode
Nooo no baby yoshis 😢😢😢😢😢
looks like another poopy mario game, i don't think mario is gonna last anymore lol
I'm buying this game, physical copy
We all must repe nt and believe the Gos pel of Je sus Christ and flee our s ins and eternal  he ll. 🔥
Everything about this game looks very lively, like the talking flower guys and the online ghosts. I'm also very excited about Nabbit reappearing.
Yall shouldn’t have made Maw Maws 😭 the artist will have a great time
I’m becoming a Nintendo player
NABBIT MY DAWG
I CANT WAIT TILL OCTOBER! AMAZING JOB NINTENDO
2:37 I'd eat one 🍄
Hoppy cat are just the mouse from 3d world
Yoshis riding on other Yoshis? Have we seen that before
Boycott new Mario voice
Marios Drug trip
I like the wonder flower element
Them new equips seems like something out of a indie game how fantastic.
This game looks so good, I still wonder (heh) why they did the online like that and even more why they didn't use the  private rooms to be just like local but with friends
Seems like a good voice actor to take the new place! I wish Charles the best
Bro..... Why tf did y'all ruin the opportunity to do a playthrough as Yoshi. We are finally given a chance for creative diversity on the roster with a Yoshi on the board and you gave him easy mode setting..... Come on.
Hang on. Is the prince a Wiggler!? Now I feel even worse for jumping on them!  This game looks like a ton of fun. I'm really _digging_ the drill power-up designs!
Why is Batman not playable???????
I love everything about this. Bringing brand new elements to Mario is such a beautiful idea.
Soooo... Is there an option to turn Mario completely to the side ? That seems a bit disturbing and looks like he is running toward us
This is what if super Mario land was made in the present
Yoshi riding on a Yoshi?!
the heart points are so cute😭
But when the heck are we getting Mario Odyssey 2????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This looks stunning havnt been excited for a 2d mario game since i was a child
60fps?
8:54 vine boom
The purple op man is back
wow this game looks great
I'm gonna be real with you guys. I dont see it
Who's voicing the Mario bros now that Charles Martinet is retiring as their voice actors?
What I got out of this: THE ANIMATIONS ARE INCREDIBLE lil worm 12 characters (including all Yoshis) HOW New peranna plants. Yes, RED SPIKE Cool map. 2 COINS!?!?! Flower toad. Flower are funny. SO MANY NEW ENEMIES AND THEY ALL LOOK INCREDIBLE Maw maws are the best thing. Why hide elephant daisy? Elephant toad is the best elephant. Big hat. Dolphin kick looks… useless mostly. MOOLA Yoshis can ride Yoshis. Yoshi stack? Cheeped out on multiplayer. But still looks good. Imma place standees in funny/inconvenient places. There are 11 unlock able standee slots but only 3 announced power ups. Hmm. Elmo baby bowser. New OLED is INCREDIBLE. Make Luigi green. Generally good. I’m tired.
Beautiful animations
WHY DO THE FLOWERS TALK!! I feel like thats going to get super annoying real fast lol. Still super excited for this tho!! looks awesome!
while this all looks really good, i do have one concern. While watching this, along with the reveal, i have noticed the crown icon on a player. I’m scared it’s gonna be like a camera system that follows only that player instead of the regular camera system in regular NSMB games.
I love you so much Nintendo ❤
I wonder who are the bosses in each area. It stinks that it's not the koopalings.
This game is gonna be great but i hope it wont be to easy. I also think t and hope that the badges arent gonna be necessary. I think it can be really compicating or frustrating reallising in the middle of the game that you used the wrong badge
This looks INSANE forget what I said about it looking like a flash game.
Cool how Nintendo created a new psychedelic
The Hoppycats remind me of the Skipsqueakers (not the original Mario 3D World, Super Mario Maker 2)
The friends race is how mario maker 2 online versus should have been
all jokes aside, did they hire Metallica to do that epic guitar riff for when Bowser merged with Florian's Castle?
Already seeing the ending : Mario merge with princess Peach castle.
Dont give the devian art artist ideas 8:53
We will not be playing NEW Super Mario Bros Wonder
This is deff using elements from Kirbys return to dream land Deluxe, BUT I was not expecting the Hat in Time Badges to appear!
I'm SO excited for this game! Everything is new and creative, from the powerups and visuals, to the level design and enemies. And the Online mode!! I can't wait to get my hands on this game omgg
So this is basically New Super Mario Bros. Switch...
Brought back ballon Mario
Ninetendo I just got pikmin 4 it was great thanks
0:03 Blade 2 (PS2)
Can't wait for the ytp's of this
I was on the fence but I’m excited now.
Nailed the game perfectly Nintendo. Custom gameplay with badges, Player 1 isn't forced to be Mario, a wide amount of characters to play, new mechanics along reused mechanics. Heck, even multiplayer is interesting.  Though seeing every characters play the same is quite a change from a few Mario games where characters had their little "something" unique to them: Mario was classic, Luigi had a higher jump, Toads were faster and Peach has a short glide effect. Yet I doubt this is a major downside, since it lets players play with their (hopefully) favorite characters without wondering if they've picked the right fella for the right couses  What could be interesting to see (even as a DLC) is a course maker integration. The game's mechanics seem simple to experiment with which could lead players to make their own unique courses the same way they're doing it with Mario Maker 1/2 once they're done with the base game. Nintendo Online would be required to share created levels online and with how great multiplayer looks showcased to us here, maybe playing this integration online will be more pleasant than on Mario Maker 2.  The artwork is really cute, can't wait to play it!
Daisy and Peach together in a mainline mario game Everything about this game is right
Can't wait to watch the game grumps play this
This game is so freaking alive!!! Edit: The music, the animation, the new gameplay changes, the sound effects, the different worlds.....it so good man holy moly.  I wonder how long it took to make this...
I will never forgive the voice over guy for calling lakitu lahkeetoo
This game looks great. I just with Yoshi wasn't an easy mode.
Is this the 2nd STRAND-TYPE game?
Some stuff reminds me to other games, who put Mario in my Mario?! Can I have more?
YES NABBIT IS FINALLY BACK
It's a Stranding game! The Noby-Noby boy genre continues!
Nabbit!? Cool!
This comes out today
This is just another way to get our money. The scenarios look almost identical like 10 years ago. 😂😂😂
Looking forward to this and not Starfield!
Please dont spoil too much of the game Nintendo
I hope the invincibility thing can be toggled, i dont wanna be forced to use it if i play those characters
NO NINTENDO NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO PRINCESS PEACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭😱😭
Finally. Sidescroller Mario game with next-gen graphics.
I hope Game Award's Family Game will give to Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
they said daisy like how its said in hi im daisy omg    also RIP yoshi’s back
Whilst the oled looks a bit cheep and lazy, this game looks like the best thing thats happened to mario since mario odyssey!
Lets-a GO!
Cant wait for the Sans wonder transformation
So excited for this game! Great job nintendo. Altho I don't know if the drill power up should be considered "new" but revamped as we technically saw it in galaxy 2. Also nintendo can we please get a dedicated shy guy game, a shy guy rpg digging into his backstory would be amazing!!!
Best Super Mario Bros game
5:15 that’s gonna be the new “bah bah” dance isn’t it  This game looks phenomenal
Fat peach hrngggg
AN OFFICIAL FIRE FLOWER DAISY! OMG, THANK YOU! Finally!
NOT THE MARIO GANG ON PSYCHEDELICS😩😩😩😭😭😭
This game looks great
I will probably play this game with my cousin Jenny . This is going to be on my Christmas list
RIP Ice flower
This is the most playable characters we have had in a mainline Mario game  We got Mario Luigi Peach Daisy Blue toad Yellow toad Toadette  Green Yoshi Blue Yoshi  Red Yoshi Yellow Yoshi  And Nabbit  Who do you pick I pick Green Yoshi
This game is looking amazing
OH BABY! MARIO LEVELED UP!
Is that Smooth McGroove in the background at 3:15ish? Hope he was compensated
Oh wow!! Princess Daisy's debut for Super Mario Bros Wonder for her 1st time since Super Mario Land AND Super Mario Run, you better go Daisy and you better go too Nintendo! Love it!🧡🧡💛💛🌼🌼❤❤❤❤
So far this game does not look like a let down at all, Im so happy to have another 2D Mario game that isn’t NSMB
October can't come soon enough...
nintendo turned a platformer into an mmorpg
Rule 34 E621 artists began to have liberty on their creativity 😮
“They all play the same!” 😫
You can play as Luigi Peach Daisy! *Two Toads*  Nintendo, they have names.
I don't know why but I'm so excited to see spedruns
I’m so glad Nintendo didn’t pull any punches and let Daisy and Peach have full on elephant forms. They are adorable and I love them.
I've just noticed the possibility of them all saying Wowie zowie. Great game already.
Awsome in the next trailer we going to see new Bosses to fight
Finally a new and unique 2d mario game. Glad we didn't get new super.mario ultra deluxe omega.
Jin of BTS : I will probably get this game on my breaks from the miltary   Jungkook of BTS: we will definitely play it together
If Democrats ate that elephant shape power up, they would have turn into donkeys
Someone else has probably said this, but I think I just recognized the voice of the flowers. It might be Zeno Robinson. He lends his voice to many cartoons nowadays!
I'm so glad the Elephant power up is universal.
This game looks beautiful 😍
badges... so we're playing hollow knight now?
can you carry shadows of online players as yoshi?
YES ITS FINNALY OUT!!!!!!!!
Game looks really good! Though I’m not sure about the online play
They’ve been oddly secretive with the bosses, aside from the weird Jr variant they’ve shown twice.  Hope this means they want to keep the bosses a surprise because they’ve finally decided to not use the Koopalings again.
Okay so this is the best game of all time
“You get an elephant form! They get an elephant form! Everybody gets an elephant form!” lol
anyone else getting mario galaxy 2 vibes from the drill powerup?
you know, Bowser did some crazy things, became a giant, became a dry bones, became a Cat Koopa... But a Castle... oh boy I fear what they do next
6:30 "And knock out *baddies* on the other side."
It would be much much cooler, if it's just a game mode and not an stupid ability
Oh, just me again Start to grow up a little more So in this game, people turn into elephants  blow up into Balloon Inflation vore Furries But I always think about all that stuff I know it's weird but😮😮 Never mind I was was playing on my PS5 Gravity rush in this Game girl that has cool powers. She Fly In Air 😮😮😮🙂🙂✨️🎇🎆✨️🎇🎆
WOW this looks different and so fun i cannot wait to get my hands on this!!
This game looks like a whole lot of fun
Ooooo   Also that bowser castle DAMN IT MUST BE BIG aahhh
Super Mario Bros Wonder is the first strand type platformer...
Super mario bros zaza edition
Who is the new voice actor of Mario
Bowser is mad because he didn't get an invite
NABBITTTTT
When are we going to get Yoshi mechanics from Super Mario World back? New Sup was great, but I enjoyed being able to go into any course I wanted with a Yoshi.
Im still surprised this is an original Mario Game
Mrbeast, by any chance can you give me 2000 dollars for my new iPhone? Thank you
Not elephant peach😭🙏💀
New Super Mario Bros. Acid Trip
14:31.captain toad
cant wait to see spiderman and mario swinging around bro
Never thought I would say this but this Mario game is cringe for adding crazy new fetishes and stuff… :( And Mario’s voice it’s just so bad
Can mushroom Kingdom stay
NEW KINGDOM!!!!
The real Mario Odyssey
super mario bros wonder is looking *WONDERFUL*
God I hope that talking flower can be turned off, or at least avoided... I'm immediately getting worse-than-Clippy vibes. Also that "Good, Good, Good, Great, Good, Great" looks like it will get obnoxious quickly. Other than those this looks like it'll be a great game.
I like how when they introduce the characters everyone else is fighting monsters while Luigi is getting absolutely tormented
Dear Nintendo: I would like if the Yoshi's weren't invincible. They have really cool abilities but their immortality makes playing with them too easy and boring.
7.04 Dark Peach returs? hahaha, the Peach with Drill and Elephant power-up is very nice
6:04 oh look, new characters for rule 34
Finally
5:03 Clodsire looks a bit..  weird
This looks awesome
I LOVE THIS!!!
Wow! This game looks STUNNING! I can't wait for this game to release!
This right here is the breath of fresh air that modern 2D Mario REALLY NEEDED!  I can't wait to play this game when it comes out!
3:57 love how he said it
If Maw-Maws are enemies then why are they friend shaped?
Nintendo is a CHAD for even making Toadette an option. Yeah, it’s not too crazy. She was also playable in NSMBU Deluxe. But still, the fact there’s areas in the over world where you can free roam is amazing.        RELEASE THIS GAME ALREADY!! I WANT IT NOW!
dude there can be up to 7!! players thats 3 times more than the laster super mario bros   sorry i meant to choose from well really its like 12 but sorry if you thoute i meant 7 players
NABBIT IS BACK
8:44 If you're not watching the Super Mario Brothers Super Show, you're gonna turn into a Goomba!
Amaaaazing Direct!!
Badges... lets go 2K finally added more badges
this is acid
Meh, no martinet
By the way, if you have TWO easy mode characters, there's literally no excuse not to ramp up difficulty. The whole "it's for kids" excuse no longer holds. I mean, have you seen the way children play video games these days? Their hand-eye coordination puts our generation to shame. 😂
So every kingdom could be dlc?
Bro why do the talking flowers sound like thinknoodles
This looks awesome!
Wowie zowie
Some music sounds like smooth mcgroove and I’m all for it 🤩🤩
HYPE
Candy Land is nice
I'm surprised at how negative this comment section is
Best game since nsmbwii, no challenge
Nabbit is back.
HYPE
This game is fantastic
6:06 NINTENDO…. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE… THEY’RE COMING….
Mario cures aids
Was that lena raine???
Mario elephant or other player with water remember me the Donkey Kong Country 3
Was that Smooth McGroove that I heard?
I'm so disappointed in Nintendo any more.  Barely any real innovation, not consumer friendly at all.  Everything they create just seems greedy and lazily made.
That flower is irritating!
The game looks great! It is disappointing that the is no true online coop for the main game.  Also, I really hope we leave this narration style for the directs behind with the next gen system.
Comes to think of it Mario is are very stupid games.
Kangaroo Mario?
The new Mario voice is pretty close to Charles Martinet’s. Whoever is voicing Mario now is doing a great job
have in others languages?
This feels like if "YouTube Kids" was a Mario game: no offence!
looks boring
That wasn't Smooth McGroove in the background music, was it?
3:34 that is a weird question to even ask flower.
Bowser looking like mr electric from Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Jokes aside I'm not usually a fan of mario games they just never appealed to me but this looks genuinely interesting. I'll also say the same for super mario rpg.
BLUE TOAD GANG RISE UP
Who let Nintendo cook 💀
Me; seeing all the cast that i predicted walk together Me; '' alright, predicted those guys! nice! Me; sees Nabbit walk by Me; ''WHAT THE--he..playable?...what a...weird chocie.. ''
Dude Bowser's piranha plants look metal. I actually like the idea of him just infecting the world with gigantic monstrous plants.
yay blue toad
MARIO FANS BE EATING TODAY
The new enemies are very cute
Wait I thought this was going to be lame but it’s, like, the coolest game I’ve ever seen! I was really impressed with the multiplayer as well, despite not being true online multiplayer, they added elements that spice things up.
A Mario game with public lobbies    WHAT
omg, ¡OMFG!
a mario game with mulitple characters and all of them control the same, meh
Yoshi: "Mario, you've gone too far this time."
It’s good to see toadette and nabbit make a reappearance
Really nice! I just hope we can turn off the voice lines for the flowers...
Transformation and fat fetish users must be happy
Making Yoshi an “easy mode” character was so unnecessary.
Nintendo keeping couch co-op alive is really important. In an age where most companies try to milk as much money as possible, here comes Mario saying "4 people can play with a SINGLE copy of the game".
"I wonder what goombas taste like"  Same?... I guess...
When I saw the “NEW POWER UPS” I was like “Oh oh my goodness I’m definitely playing this
Looks like an Odyssey sized leap forward for the 2D Mario games. I hope we also get this game's style in a future Mario Maker sequel too.
Nintendo is sooo good. I can play this as an experienced mario 2d player and my daughter van enjoy it too with the online players' help. This deserves the 30m sales already.
Elephant Peach is gonna give me nightmares
I ain’t even mad at the online mode really. Yeah we can’t directly play with each other, but the ghost mode with friends seems pretty close and without the lag that would be there if we were full on playing the courses together. Also sending messages and helping each other will be neat and gives the game a real community feel. This game is so exciting. Modern 2D Mario is here!
I think Mario needs to lay off the shrooms for a bit. This looks a little too wacky.
14:16  “What a beautiful day!”   It sure is, talking flower… it sure is…
Did you know that prince florian is based off of a Japanese mario movie where prince florian can turn into a caterpillar and loves peach and peach for some reason liked him mario was jealous and at the end of the movie he turns into a caterpillar  never to be seen again till now and can't transform back for some reason
😮
4:52 What do you mean by that 📸🤨
*He turned himself into a castle…*
5:03 Maw-maw, my precious
Wow! Spoilers!
The only thing I’m not a fan of is the no damage taken as yoshi or nah it tbh but everything else looks sick!
I'm a bit disappointed that all the characters play the same, and that Yoshi is "easy mode", but everything else is absolutely incredible!
I can't wait to add this to my collection
It feels like the mario team is actually listening after everything with the massive backlash of the New Super Mario Bros series
This game has a lot of fan service and Bubble Mario is one of those fan services featured in this game.
Bro why, Mario Wounder going to be great.
6:11 Bubble bobble 6:45 Mr. Driller 8:07 Acid trip
those flowers? talk tooo much
Imagine if you're a child again first time seeing this trailer. I'd have massive goosebumps!
What a wonderful direct.
This direct is awesome, how did they make it so good?!
I'd say this means to Nintendo Switch the same Super Mario World meant for SNES.
8:43 looks like someone didnt watch the super mario bros super show
3:22 “talking flowers” checkmate vegans! Plants have feelings too!
Maybe the Wonder Flower got Mario and everyone tripping and it's just happening in their heads. Just a theory. lol I mean in Mario 2 everything was Mario's dream but then again there's that Dream World which was an actual thing so it's not a dream but real.
Drill helmet is amazing and must be in SMM3
lock-e-twos?!?!
This game has potential
Best 2d mario game because it changes from the original
The fact that they're actually once again acknowledging that there's other places in the world other than just the Mushroom Kingdom and Bowser's Kingdom makes me unexplainably happy because it reminds me a ton of what the Mario and Luigi RPG games tried to do to expand the world a little bit.
what am i looking at
big W
After you touch the flower when things start to act weird I think it should even play iconic music
I'm *SO* excited to play this online! Glad 2D Mario is back to it's tracks
Yeah... I'm starting to think Mario is no longer safe for children, those new power ups are clearly drugs.
insane how this became the second strand type game before ds2
Can we turn off the flowers voice
3:28 sounds like sonic
Too many spoilers... it's like a review of the game packed as a commercial 😜
Woah
And what a wonder it is. Beautiful and fun.
Super Mario 3 better
the shadow players concept is very cool.  It's neat to see Demon's Souls and Dark Souls's influence reach into unexpected places like this.
I think there’s some deep hollow knight level lore going on here…
First Bowser became a furry, then a enraged kaiju, and now a castle 💀💀💀💀
Who is going to be the new voice of Mario
Tire screech...  PLAY AS YOSHI & NABBIT!?  SOLD
*Inserts positive comment.*
My mom sent this to me and told me: "Skip 30 minutes into the video 🥰" Mom where the💀
Looks great! Can't wait to play it.👍 I love the art style too😁
This is the baby of New supe and the new yoshi island games
Bowser is air ship
FINALLY THERES A ONLINE
Standees are technically locked behind a paywall since the only reason you’d use it is with Nintendo Switch Online. It is still a really cool game though and I can’t wait for it to release and Balloon Mario is back.
Reminds me of sm3dw
It’s just samey old Mario stuff but with new paint job, not that exciting TBH
11:58 Elephant Mario on Yoshi! (Here we go again...)
0:59 bowser literally has Fart Powers
This game looks sooooo good, I’m very excited!
they butchered online so bad bro💀
Baldur's Gate 3.. Starfield.. Diablo 4.. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.. Tears of the Kingdom.. And this...?? How does one have time for all these amazing games!? 😅  And then we have Sonic Superstars coming soon as well... 90s all over again. 😹
Due to this new content, the ESRB may change the game's rating. These advertised contents in this game are too much for an E-rated game to handle. What will happen with that game will happen with Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. I don't know what Nintendo's reason is for the ESRB not changing the rating for this game.
I wish Nintendo would add a little more edge into their marketing instead of talking to us like we are three-year-olds.
Tbh I was not excited for this game but after watching that I’m pumped!
So excited to preorder the Fentanyl edition!. My body is ready for the trip.
Wow sonic 3 looks amazing!
Oh great nabbit is back
I was really hoping this game would not be boring and too easy. Looks kinda boring and too easy.
6:10 I see that Nintendo is taking inspiration from th best spongebob flash game, whobob whatpants, they even have the bouncing off bubbles mechanic.
I havent seen badges since Mario & Luigi: Bowsers Inside Story. Omg the nostalgia
I was already sold but the online made it an instant yes!
the live ghosts worry me as a mario maker 2 fan, will the lag be as bad as it is there?
Please give me a Mario Maker 3 with this style included. Please Nintendo.
Does the new Switch come with Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario Odyssey and/or Super Mario Wonder?  If not, it should. All three games included.
12:35 online co-op in a Mario game is genius. 🤯
I wish the yoshi s were not the game easy mode
Wowie zowie💀
This game is awesome!
THIS IS THE YEAR OF MARIO
This game is going to be insane! I hope it also becomes a Mario Maker theme!  Edit: Wow! This is my most liked comment! Thanks!
买爆
Ah, the Flower Kingdom... a dawn of a new Mario Era is coming to us all.  Guys, we have met... OUR DESTINY!!!
😭  they really did her dirty like that 6:05
LoCkeTOoS
YESSSSS
Yellow metal mario?
2023 looks like a good year for games, Sonic Frontiers, Fnaf Ruin, Garten of Banban, Pizza Tower, and now Super Mario Wonder. I Wonder what’s next.
Only problem i have is most of the characters play the same
Ok fine. I'll buy it.
DAISY
Tip tap top 🔝
12:20 *mario freaking dies and his soul leaves his body* just to be revived
Love how Mario and the worm that Bassiacaly stole princess peach from him are gonna have to work together
I can't believe they labeled the Drill power-up as a "New" power-up
Red Yoshi is fast. . I'll play as Red Yoshi and Mario. . Dang it's terrible that Wario and Waluigi. Dark-Blue. Purple. Orange. And pink Yoshi didn't make the super Mario Bros Wonder.
SO ECXITED!!!!!!!!
Okay, definitely a must but! I was wanting it regardless, but this convinces me a new style if 2D Mario is back baby! 😊
New súper Mario bros Wii .u de luxe ultra solo para Nintendo Switch
Damn it’s good but they’re getting lazy with these oled models
awesome
5:18 please dont make this the official pronunciation Nintendo. The debate has been going on for years, but I think both sides will agree that this is very very wrong. I dont want Lockitus in my game!!!! other than that though this game looks fire
Ngl I'd be happy if my two major Switch games for the holidays were Super Mario Bros. Wonder... and Fashion Dreamer
I don’t trust the talking flower. He knows something Mario and the gang doesn’t know
I am DEFINITELY getting this game! This looks very wacky and creative. And I love it!!!
Tubular is back
Stoked! I have a newborn baby and in the cracks of my time, it’s been hard to play more advanced feeling open world games. Still making time for Zelda totk, but this game is exactly what I need! Wish it was out now haha. So sick!
I legitimately can’t even think of word to describe how excited I am. This game looks soooo original and different from every other game but still has the same 2d Mario feel. Good job Nintendo❤
Not gonna like that flower ngl
man i thought the drill power gave mario a DEVO hat. im disappointed and i need new glasses
Who else is exited for wonder?
This looks so fun, can't wait!
That Bowser music at the start 🤌🤌 the soundtrack to this should be gold!!
If you think about it, the badges "replace" the authenticity of the characters. For example: peach used to float but now she can be spiderman. Literally now Mario can have whatever feature YOU WANT. Very much like Odisey and for me the best feature this game will have.
omgggg it looks so good
Oh,Okay then.
I hope badges can be equipped for other people if you’re playing local multiplayer
The legend, Blue Toad, has returned
This may become my nintendo fall game of the year
Love that mario is beyond just psychedelics and is now getting into narcotics 🤣
Mario: HEY! ARE YOU EXITED TO MY NEW GAME? Inuyasha: Yes.
The multiplayer Co-Op is gonna be the most insane out of all 2D Marios
6:06 You Fools!!! You just gave rule 34 artist more ammo!
This is going to be the most broken Mario game ever
The peach and daisy elephants…. They’re REALLY cursed
truly the mario of dark souls games
Holy cow Nintendo beat Kojima to the second strand-type game
Bowser is a pile of blocks, a skeleton, a baby, a rabid monster, a fire monster, a giant, a cat, and now he’s a castle, what’s next?  Bowser becoming a lady?
If this game is more difficult I’ll tell poofesure to play this
6:04 oh no…
Nintendo really killed it in a good way!   The amount of content in Wonder makes it appealing for veterans and beginners and I love it. Features, designs , and a refresher makes this worth the play. Their direct is just high peak excitement and I do hope Nintendo tries things new to appeal us fans in upcoming games next year and later 2023.
I just want to ride Yoshi as a big elephant. 😂
What?! 4:26 Why did they changed yoshis full mouth animation to this?
Quite the masterpiece
THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER
Wow hopefully Mario feline, Mario squirrel and the feather of super Mario world will come out
Mario fans be eating real good with this one, this game looks sick and I'm all here for it! 🔥🔥🔥
Never thought I'd hear the words "Gaping" and "Benevolent" in a Nintendo direct.
Maybe all this isn't new or could be it but, remember why we play videogames? For the FUN,AND ALL THIS SOUNDS SO FUN TO PLAY,AWESOME
never expected them to add zipcaster to mario
Dark Bowser Jr. Is canon
best 2D Mario game I've ever seen, I can't wait to play it!
I love this game
I already love this game, and it isn't even released yet.
I love how we're still getting new unique characters. If only paper mario could stop being so lazy and do the same...
OMG ONLINE PLAY AND THE ELEPHANTS THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST MARIO GAME EVER 😭 and plus badges being in here and helping you along the way lowkey reminds me of Paper Mario
truly the 2d scrolling super Mario of all time
A truly wonderful new adventure indeed!!!!!
Wow, this game looks great! It's so expressive and the Bubble Flower just might be my new favorite power up!
BLUE TOAD RETURNS
So awesome! You can tell a lot of love went into this.
2:05 Mountain world with it´s CELESTE´s like soundtrack!
This game is beautiful, I just really miss player collision from the last game. I wish we could jump on our friends heads and throw each other
i swear the mf flowers sound so much like n
This could be the best Mario game of all time- beating out Mario 3, Super Mario World, Mario 64, Galaxy 1/2, AND Odyssey!
what incredible charm
so does this have online multplayer
goomba
Looks very fun. My dream is to see Nintendo make a Sonic game 🙃.
goty
"I wonder what goombas taste like.." *Kills* the flower.
This seems like a fun game
Awesome!!!
Day 6 - Bring Arms back
Remember kids dont do drugs
This is awesome for sure on my list
11:57 Yoshi has scoliosis…
Sad they didn’t add my boy Wario or Waluigi, maybe for a future game. Otherwise I’m super hyped for this one!
Goddamn I am so damn excited to play this game
It makes me so happy that they have put the fan favorite character BLUE TOAD in the game !
You can literally see the png in the thumbnail
Bring back the ice flower 🥲
I like how this is (to my knowledge) the first non-spinoff Mario game where Bowser doesn’t kidnap Peach; it’s like he knows he already won. 💀  I haven’t gotten a Mario game since Super Mario Galaxy, but the vibrant visuals and interactive gameplay really has me considering this game.
Goodbye Charles.
I surprisingly can’t wait to see what bosses are going to be, because the fact that they weren’t shown in the direct means Nintendo must be saving a spicy surprise.
El juego lo tengo reservado pero no necesitaba un direct para spoilearmelo todo la verdad
Im sorry, "LOCK-ee-toos"!?  No. Just no.
This is truly revolutionary  Especially with the online play
Super Mario Maker 3 is gonna be WONDERful
Really looking forward to thr online community aspect of it. Can't a wait!
i'm usually a skeptic about new video games but i gotta say: nice
You know what... this direct spoils a lot of gameplay surprises... where's the "payers should learn thought playing the game" motto Nintendo used to have?
Just give me an online 2D Mario without a crap ton of lag, and I'm sold.
Glad to see Yellow Yoshi isn’t just a playable png!
with the yoshi on yoshi thing i wonder if you can stack 4 yoshi's
MAW MAWS LOOK SO CUTE!!!!
I wish you could play with others online like in local multiplayer
This is alot I am enjoying here! Can't wait to get the game!
That was just insane to see blue toad is playable elephants and Yoshi can ride on yoshi daisy is now playable in a mainline mario game and the power ups
As much as the I enjoy the shadow player mechanic for online and getting together for races. I just want regular co-op that you’d get in person online since most of my friends live away and few of my friends here don’t want anything to do with this kind of stuff
I was weirded out at first that Yoshi couldn’t take damage, until I remembered he can’t technically lose a life from touch damage in Yoshi’s Island or Mario World.
I love the inclusion of badges! not as deep as the badge system in paper mario but it's awesome.
And yet we still can’t talk to friends over online play which is unbelievable in 2023…
Guess I’m cynical now. After 11 years since the last 2D Mario game this looks dreadfully boring, repetitive, uninspired, and too similar to the four “New Super Mario” entries. I’m tremendously disappointed. I honestly don’t know if I’ll get this 2D Mario and I ALWAYS get the new mainline Mario games. It looks like they’re phoning it in for a $60 cash-grab.
It’s gonna be amazing when all this new stuff hits Mario Maker someday.
It would be cool if it had a DLC for Wario and Waluigi
Mario has Dark Souls phantoms now
They really added the death stranding online feature to the game
I was expecting more old power ups coming back
this game will be sick. no more words. perfect bomb. going to preorder right now
you're telling me Lakitu is pronounces "Lock-ee-two" and not "Lack-it-two"?
BLUE TOAD IS IN THE GAME HUGE W
this is the first time in a while that Nintendo is willing to experiment
Can't believe Mario is now a strand type game
Yo
Morio Wonder is a video game?
TOADETTE LESGO
I miss Charles
Who are the voice overs on these? They’re so bad
Genuinely interested. However, I can't afford it.
Its clear now Yoshi never skips leg day.
Besides the way Yoshi looks when he has something in his mouth this game look AWESOME! I already love it so much this will definitely be the best 2D Mario game of all time!
Mario can finally solo Goku….
One of the crazy things about this game is that Daisy is now playable in an adventurous Mario game, other than the party or strikers games
I No One Gonna Talk About How Bowser Literally Becomes His Own Castle?
Looks fantastic! Can I pay extra to have Daisy removed from my game though? 🤔
Mario for Beyond The Spider-Verse confirmed?!  Seriously though this game looks great! I like the idea of playing with people from around the world.
12 player be like
This is giving the same hype as mario Odyssey when it was first announced
I wonder if you can stack more than 2 Yoshis on each other, that would be hilarious
Where Wario, Waluigi, Rosalina, & the Toad?
WE GOT NABITT!
This art style is incredible.  Sooooooooooooo much better than the NSMB series.
So That Flying Castle Wasn’t Bowser’s New  Weapon, IT WAS LITERALLY BOWSER HIMSELF!!!
I like that power ups feel like copy abilities in the sense there is an animation when collected  Nice touch
2:44 Fire spike!?, Dang
I just got official confirmation that it isn't pronounced "luh-keetu," and I've never felt more vindicated.
Great game, one question though. Will the online features be for online pass
Bro, bowser Keeps Getting BIGGER in Every Game!!! From Godzilla to Castle!
BLUE TOAD LETS GOOO
The moment where we all thought we were getting online multiplayer.
What were they thinking! Now deviantart artists have access to elephant peach! 😨
Danm October gonna be stacked
11:57 in before the lunatics come in who proclaim that Mario always “abuses” Yoshi.
It’s like they tried? Where has this Nintendo been when making side scrolling Mario!?
Nintendo Switch Red October 😆😆
This game seems kinda bad
Can't wait for all the inflation
Daisy, Mario Galaxy 2's Drill Ability, AND Mario RPG Badges in the SAME MAINLINE GAME?? Oh this game's gonna slap SO hard.
This looks like the best 2D scrolling game ever made! WOW
i feel like this game is gonna either be great or not be very good. it’s pretty promising tho. it mixes the old with the new which is cool
Mario x Bubble Bobble x Mr Driller.  What a time to be alive!
like how Elephant toad looks like hahaha
Super Mario Galaxy 2 Drill is BACK!
Truly the Dark Souls of platformers.  - Player phantoms - Placing signs - You can drop items for other players to pick up - Opt-in co-op - Teaming up to fight bosses
Is it Smooth Mcgroove singing on background????
I will buy this game, period. What can I say more?
6:06 Didn’t it was possible to make a girl elephant look cute and pretty!
I expected nothing less from Nintendo, that's all I'll say.
This would be epic to play on shrooms
Yay Excites to Buy and playing🎀😸🙀💖❤️
The game have a grappling hook mechanic. 10/10
Looks good!
Sorry Nintendo, im sure the fanboys are going to like this one, but ima pass
I like how they implemented the talking flowers Really makes this game alot more cherry
I wasn't going to buy it because I can't rely on my friends for local coop. But since you can play online I'm all in
Why can't Nintendo just make a good Mario themed Switch?
This looks so fun and I really like the idea of playing online with other ghosts in real time. Those save posts are a neat idea too.
This was an amazing Direct. Certainly one of the most innovative 2D Mario games we have gotten in recent years. One thing I will say is it looks like certain levels are designed around certain badges. I hope they have a recommended badge listed somewhere so you don't have to remember which badge is best suited to which level.
I don't get the hype for this it looks like a new soup game with a more interesting artstyle
Why not a green Luigi oled switch😂 your telling me they wanna make another red console
This is the first 2D Mario game that I've been excited about since maybe the SNES. Looks great!
drill peach is an emo baddie
Oh, I get it now, a Super Mario Maker 3 game hasn’t come out yet because you wanted to wait for this game to come out…         Right?
I would say the plot is funky, but this is Mario so the plot really don’t matter😂 looks like a great game!
this giving me super mario world vibes
This looks SO FUN
11:58 Dang Yoshi is STRONG.
*This ain’t your Grandpa’s Mario game son…*
I’m gonna be using the grappling vine badge and you can’t stop me from being spider-man
I love the platform style, reminds me of the super mario bros on the DS
Is it just me or do the talking flowers sound like Teddie from Persona 4?
The Direct made me not want the hehe anymore. Too easy, no surprised characters, too NSMB, online I just wanted to play normally with friends.
Seems like that bubble power up is gonna be OP
This game looks truly incredible.
I often think about how cool it would be for a future Mario game to have something like what Sonic Forces had.  To be able to make your own Mario character.  Granted, I am just looking for a way to play as Bowsette in an official Mario game =P.
I’m obsessed with the talking flower 😂❤
Mamma Mia that’s all I have to say, I’m so excited for this game.
Got really excited when I saw the first teaser and saw Yoshi as a playable character. Definitely a bummer seeing that you can’t play as him without it being in baby mode…  Rest of the game looks awesome though. Can’t wait
That new oled mario switch looks amazing, I can't wait to buy it
This game looks really interesting! Looking forward to this 🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼
They totally nailed it in this mario wonder direct the world map and new abilities and worlds look amazing cant wait to play it especially being able to play as daisy i just hope the online multiplayer is actually world wide and not local only
They really say wowwie Zowie? RIP BRAY
They showed the elephant peach. God help us
im sold this games look so fun and amazing i cant wait to play it
This sealed the deal on my pre-order. The multiplayer is a huge win
That spooky forest level will definitely be appropriate for Halloween (assuming we reach it by then)
Okay I’m gonna buy this one
It wouldn’t be a mainline Mario game without the fire flower
5:47 AVGN: You can just…walk over it.
so like... it's the kirby of mario? this just reminds me of kirby's epic yarn! i love it :3
WOW!!!  Freakin' Wow!  This could be the best Super Mario 2D ever made.  And since I have no friend, the online feature is perfect.  Take my money Nintendo and congratz on another amazing game.  You guys are truly the best in the industry.  Oh and who gives a crap about another Bethesda's mess, Starfield ??
2:38 that was uncann y
Because this game is aimed at adults AND kids, this is going to outsell Odyssey in a heartbeat
Wonder what Silvagunner is gonna do when this comes out
They made this game impossible to be bad!
6:02 Oh... my soul hurts...
Basically those Flowers are like Drugs when you get high 🤣
Yoshi gots some great strength to hold on to an elephant!
i want a maw-maw as a pet
Just realised this is the triple deluxe of mario.  New kingdom of different people, entrapment of their people,  the flower/plant motief,  special plant-like collectable special interactable plant beginning a stand-alone sequence specialized to the new gimmick, old threats revitalised with a new twist,  flying castle,  niche powerups, The antagonist becomes fused with a focal innanimate object in the story, ridding of their humanity and becoming sometimg "Greater" for their  increasingly less sane goal.  Did I mention the flower motief?
This looks absolutely amazing! I cant believe the amount of new stuff in this game. I felt like I was gonna pass out from all the new stuff! especially the online multiplayer!
So mario ate all the mashromes in this one
WALL JUMP BADGES. PARKOUR STUFF. I LITERALLY PREDICTED THE DRILL POWERUP. THANK YOU LORDDDDDD
So so so excited!!!! The badge system looks incredible and there's even an in-game speedrun timer for some levels, this is gonna be such a cool speedgame
Rip Wario
That Bowser Castle is TERRIFYING!!!
I'm not a fan of 2D Mario games nowadays (I'm here out of curiosity), but I'll give kudos to Nintendo for making Wonder a packed game. If this was the next 3D Mario game, I'd be all over it. Wonder will be a special game.
Hey Nintendo, any chance of a new Snipper Clips game? That is by far one of my favourite Switch games, so addictive, I'd love to see a bigger, longer sequel, also would really love to see a new Pilot Wings game.
sucks that yoshi is stuck as an easy mode character, i wish there was an option to play yoshi normally :/ still really excited to see this game
IS THE TALKING FLOWER THE SAME VA AS CAT NOIR?
Peach looks like Meena from SING when she's in elephant form😂😂😂
Foot Racing???? Such a groundbreaking concept for a Mario Game!!!
Not a fan of most of the characters playing the same, but everything else looks great!
I like how the jump animation is somewhat reminiscent of Super Mario world. Also, Daisy hasn't been in a mainline Mario game for over 20 years. This is going to be great.
when mario becomes a strand type game. but fr that part was cool as heck
Oh no you gave to jump with B
Nabbit yes 🙌 predicted right!!!!!!!
Plainrock will destroy that switch lol
“With just a single touch of the mysterious Wonder Flower…0:32 He doesn’t look too good Mr. Stark!”
To Nintendo. Can you make so settings for characters. Example, you could have a Yoshi setting, if you want him or them to not stink when attacked or vice versa. By the way, I am very excited for this game. I swear that you guys produced really good games this year. Keep at it!    Edit: Fix Yoshi’s item in mouth face please and thank you.
Nintendo better put Rosalina as a secret playable character! She's my favourite chracter to play as in 3D World.
Will this game have the same music from the Wii & U version? I like the castle music
Since yoshis can ride each other, someone should try to beat the game while always in a 4 stack of yoshis
Hi Nintendo i like that trailer but if you want can u make super mario games on android? Plus respect
You can play with Luigi that shouldn't be no shocker LOL.
They still made the online seem fun even after saying you’re not directly playing with each other.
Mario with Rayman Legends aesthetic, AWESOME
Eyo! SMWCentral is calling, they want their bubble power-up back
I absolutely LOVE the art style
Bellísimo
Finally a nintendo game with online play
I could definitely see a Super Mario Maker 3 coming out in the future too  anyways this direct is awesome and this is one of if not the best 2d mario game, I can just tell.
11:48 "or you can jump on their back or ride them" 💀💀💀
I star love this game so much and funny part yoshi on top yoshi XD and yoshi carrying elephant Mario XD poor yoshi
Cool, a game with badges like some of the Paper Mario games and the Mario and Luigi series. I wonder if they’re gonna add clothing next.
The looks absolutely phenomenal!!! I hope the love for this release leads to a Mario Maker 3. QOL improvements plus these new additions would be amazing!! Looking forward to this game :)
Nice to see a Super Mario game with strand-type elements.
Can't believe they brung drill back from galaxy, cool
The mysterios power of Flower Land!  Drugs
4:47 unlike these Condarts, when I stick my beak where it does not belong, the cops come for me 😉
So did anyone else see a dinosaur riding a dinosaur or am I just crazy?
Heck yeah
It’s quite preposterous that Bowser has transformed
1.1 Million views 5 hours ago. Just turned 6 hours ago also with 1.1 Million views.
This new artstyle reminds me of when the Pokemon anime changed.
This game looks so fun! So many whimsical and wacky ideas, Nintendo really went all out!
Typical nintendo. Perfection.
omg this is so cool, i can’t wait for october
wat they added charms to a mario game WAT
Flower Kingdom no Wonder we have Daisy get it 😁
Saw Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Toadette and Nabbit returns. And the debut of Princess Daisy, like, she's finally in Super Mario game for the 1st time!!!🌼🌼Go Princess Daisy!!🌼🌼🧡🧡💛💛
super ambitious game. this is going to be up there with mario bros wii
Looks really amazing ! I'm waiting this game more than tears of kingdom.
Online co op is a hard miss, needs to have parity with local.
Is there a demo?
Sounds just like charles martinet
this has to be made by goodfeel.
I’m in tears! This is amazing
This is getting stale.
I love Republican Mario
Basically the online is what miiverse did in mario 3D world, i need it. Also i hope we can do normal online play in the game instead of the ghost thing, ghost thing still gonna be so fun though l
When kidnapping the princess isn't good enough anymore and now you have to become a giant ball with tentacles.
Fine but now we need a movie based on every Mario Game
SUPER MARIO BROS ACID TRIP LOOKIN SWEEET
This game doesn't look like it has enough content.  Don't get me wrong it looks awesome and I love all this creative energy that they're putting into it.  But for $90 it'll probably be a game that only takes a solid 5-6 hours to complete, and after that have no replay value. There needs to be more game modes and ways to play multiplayer.  Bringing back challenge mode from Mario Bros U would be a good start. Maybe re-using coin battles or some other challenging multiplayer mode would be good as well.  However, as it is right now, I am not convinced that this game is worth my money simply because of how quick it will be finished and forgotten.
Wow, I really love the art style and new enemies in Super Mario Bros. Wonder! Can't wait to play this game!
I hope we can merge with Princess Peach's castle and have an epic kaiju battle at the end
imagine this in Mario Maker 3
There's no way to play the intended co-op mode unless you're on the same system? Why? I get the ghost mode works well for strangers and all, but give the option to play the game normally with friends online. On the note of multiplayer, why strip the other characters movement differences? The game looks amazing otherwise, and it's exciting to see a fresh and new 2D Mario, but what strange design choices
I want so much of these features for the next mario maker!
Cute as heck
7:30 Daisy: WOWIE ZOWIE
Mario red edition Nintendo Switch looks like that one mockup Communism edition Switch.
So Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy the game? Yeah, I'm fine with this, get to experience an acid trip for 20 hours, lovely.
You can tell how much love and care just by looking at the direct. Great job to those involved
The entire ship is bowser💀💀💀💀 IT'S NOT A FLOATING CASTEL👌💀💀💀💀
Peach looks terrifying as a elephant
I hope Nintendo drops more characters along the way. I can't lie, that Wario, Waluigi, and Rosalina rumor had me excited.
"A rich variety of courses await in each world!" *proceeds to show the same grass, underwater, swamp, sky, desert, and lava worlds we've had for the past 2 decades*
Are you serious my brother😐😐😐
BRO IS THAT SMOOVE MCGROVE
8:34 reminds me of Super Mario Land 2 :)
RIP Playable Donkey Kong
I want this game now!
Okay, now THIS is more like it! The first look we got of this game didn't impress me much. The 2D series has become old and stale. It's always the same thing, we get new power-ups, a few new enemies and such, but that's pretty much it. The series was in desperate need of something new added to the gameplay to take the series to the next level, much the way SMB3 did with the world map, flight, and item inventory, and the way SMW did with Yoshi, an upgraded and improved world map, and secret exits. The "New" series didn't really add anything new beyond multiplayer co-op. But now, we FINALLY get the next big step up for the series with badges, a very unique and innovative online multiplayer, and an open world map! This is a pretty huge deal!   I have to wonder if the Mario games are all going to take place in the Flower Kingdom for the next 30+ years now. It also has me curious about the Star Kingdom which common sense tells you must exist. Perhaps there is a Leaf Kingdom too.
Thanks Nintendo
I think the only thing I dislike about the game so far I'd the online multi-player and how the characters are basically just invisible but besides that the rest of the multi-player is badasss along with the rest of the game badges, wacky things happening with the wonder flower, the new power ups aren't op like in New Mario bros. They're actual useful items for this game and not a useless powerful just to have it. Good for Nintendo :)
All I needed to see was playable toadette. I’m happy
This is now my fave smb game of all time. So much variety, great game design, colors popping, new boses, different power ups, different ways to use the power ups, online, it's gonna be fun.
You Gotta Love The Talking 👄 Flowers 💐
Anyone else notice how similar some of the badges are to badges in Yoshi's Wooly World?
The only bad part to me is that the yoshies are easy mode characters
Mario spike ball = me buying the game.
Is that smooth mcgroove doin the ba ba ba ba?
Hopefully they have an option to turn off the talking plants.
These sooo cute I want to play it also Tcnick will love to see his favorite character playable in Mario
can a yoshi ride a yoshi thats riding a yoshi thats riding a yoshi?
No thanks, ill pass. Looks great but too much mario. Wish it was a new DK game instead.
The flower voice is offputting.
This should be a good time! Haven't had a platformer game with this many playable characters since Sonic 2006. Sad most don't have distinct styles, though, since it'll take away one appeal of second playthroughs. But the first play will be amazing
OK, thank GOD that Wiggler wasn't Prince Haru. That would've made for an even worse moment for Mario than the Odyssey ending.
Elephants Peach and Daisy are just so adorable! I can't get enough of them! This is gonna be a wondrous blast of a game!
BLUE TOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bowser death star
Only disappointing thing is all the characters play the same
It feels strange to have every character play the same... i don't know how to feel about this.
Great work! Looks amazing! 😊
Elephant Peach is real lmao
They stole that ghost thing from cuphead. They even say thank you!
Broooo this is an instant buy
I love the idea of the other players being shadows in the levels with you even if you arent playing together and still being able to help each other, its gonna be a great game
14:24 did y’all not see that glitch? Edit: I know they’re invisible, I mean when the pot moved suddenly
Another verse to the legendary Mario franchise, and what a verse it is! I think this just might be their magnum opus!
Daisy in a new mainstream Mario game?! Have we finally won?!
can’t wait to play this game. i’m so excited to play a new mario game
The end of an era and the beginning of a new one😢 Charles martinet will be missed as the voice
What an awesome Super Mario Direct!!! I can't wait to play this new adventure!!! 🥰
Wowie zowie, this game looks incredible!
Make Mario Maker 3
What kind of sorcery they used to mammals this game ? It look so polished so premium, good job Nintendo.
Mario Kaizo after this game will be insane.
Dibs on Daisy.
Finally, finally, FINALLY!!! They finally got rid of those stupid super annoying floaty-slippery controls from all the New Super Mario Bros series!!! Controls finally feel almost as tight as they were in Super Mario Bros 3 (the way they were always meant to be)!!! Thank you so much!!! All the NSMB games were just unplayable for me.
I love the dark souls style shadows!
no Rosalina? 😢
Nabbit: I always come back.  Yoshis: *also exist for easy mode*
Wonder if Mario Maker will get a update of this😂
0:17 They legit merged Kibidango and his true form, Prince Haru pft.
I love the journey/dark souls style multiplayer
Nintendo is finally copying Dark Souls with player shadows
11:32 bruh thats literally cuphead.
Why couldn’t yoshi just be like the other characters GODDAMNIT NINTENDO WE WERE SO CLOSE TO PIRE PERFECTION
I'm happy because there's no haru
Wow! This is pretty awesome!
Love the online ghosts idea. It's multiplayer but without the possibility to grief players
Very pleased to see Toadette playable again.
Hold on if bowser Jr is in this then are the Koopalings going to make a return?
This is making me very excited for the next Mario Maker
6:45 IT'S BACK!! IT'S BACK!! DRILL MARIO IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A yoshi riding another yoshi. I repeat a yoshi RIDING another YOSHI. Never I thought in a million years that I’ll see a YOSHI RIDES ANOTHER YOSHI!! It’s insane it’s Chaos!…and I absolutely loved it, I really can’t wait for this wonderful Mario game.
This game look so damn good, full of wonders
great new features add and no flying racon🤔 online looks good..longest running game since the 80s playing as yoshi and no dieing unless u fall😂 glad to  see him being able to use and not saving princess peach again.....damn u bowser!
The game look so good !
This looks so fun,but I’m gonna miss Charles Martinet voicing Mario. 11:58-Poor yoshi
I really think it's the best modern 2d mario
7:44 dear god
I love this
I dont understand. This looks like you are on drugs...
Aww, man, I just wanted to play yoshi because I liked him, but now I'll get outed for being bad :(
Elephant form riding Yoshi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Yoshi : why Nintendo why always me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😝😝😝
"a new nintendo switch OLED themed after mario is on its way!" *paints right joycon red*
Spider-Mario Bros 2: Wonders
So exciting! Can't wait to start playing this.. Am I the only one found elephant Peach adorable?
Only thing I really hate are the talking flowers. I hope you can make it text-only.
this game looks great, i'm sad charles martinet has retired we will never forget you charles!
Looks like the first truly new Mario Bros game in quite some time!
day 1 no questions asked!
@01:50 Is that Smooth McGroove' soothing singing I hear?
I love how Nintendo just casually drops that there's another big kingdom that's not the mushroom kingdom
Super Mario Bros. A good game to play with your family
Wait the bubble flower the color of the outfit is one of luigis colors from smash bros
My brother thought this was good ong
No *WONDER* it's called Super Mario Bros *WONDER*, this game is completely *WONDERFUL*
Just amazing!!!!
We need more daisy appearances
Looks to easy
This is my GOTY for sure after seeing this!
wonderr
I’m so looking forward to playing this game it looks so much fun
5:22 - It looks like the SMW modding community guessed correct on the color scheme of the Bubble Flower. That or one of the devs in the design team is a fan of those mods, or is one of the devs of said mods. Also, I like that this is now Nabbit's third playable appearance ever. Gives me NSLU vibes. I love that badges are returning from Yoshi's Woolly World. Edit: The only thing that I don't like is the lack of the Ice Flower, but since Mario Bros. Wonder has enough scripting as is, it won't affect me that bad, and seeing the Bubble Flower makes me content as that is a more-than suitable replacement.
Wario and Waluigi dlc?
The games gonna be too eaaaaaasyyy though
This game’s animation is so full of character and that Bowser design is incredible!  I’m actually really excited for this!💛
The level designs look absolutely fantastic! Definitely getting this game day one!
@05:45 has to be a Angry Video Game Nerd reference, right? 😂
Makes me happy that you could have the og Mario bros Wii crew together
Yet another Mario Red switch? Missed opportunity. They could’ve made one decorated with the Wonder scheme. Like a blue and white reminiscent of the wonder flower.
a must have for mario fans..
Feels like a 2010s era Kirby game
The new Super Mario Maker 3 is gonna be insane…
I *WONDER* is this game is gonna be any good 🤭
8:55 oh no Nintendo what have you done
This looks awesome! Can't say I've been this hyped for a 2D mario game before! Look forward to it
This might be my new favorite game
Cool , congratulations ! why not wario can be boss again like in super mario land 2 ?
I loved seeing this direct until the flower said   “I wonder what Goonbas taste like…”  All jokes aside I would definitely buy this game!
Bro it’s like Mario and Luigi story wise
“Wonder” truly captures the essence of this title. There’s a whimsicality about this game that I’ve sorely missed in recent years. I can’t wait to get my hands on it.
Will Wario and Waluigi be added to this game later?
Hopefully there some boss fights But overall this game is wonderful
8:35 PLEASE BE NAMED THE SPIN DRILL PLEASE  I NEED MY GALAXY 2 REFERENCES
Finally a strand type mario
Rosie red mascot good girl
Fire whoever thought "wowie zowie" was a good line
BLUE TOAD GANG RISE UP, THE GOAT IS BACK
3:33 this is gonna get memed HARD
Wish there were more returning power ups tho
I bet Mario maker 3 will come out after Mario bros wonder
Game looks great, but wow, ​ between the strength of the power-ups and badges and the way online works, it feels like it'd be hard to have a middle-ground in terms of difficulty. Either those will make a breeze to go through the game if not putting restrictions on yourself, or it'll be really hard if not using them... Here's hoping they can figure the best way to implement all that!
I hoping can use Bowser as a playable character in the entire game
I’m I’m glad bowser went after the flower instead of peach
I love 2D Mario games,  so glad they are still making them.
"All characters play the same so choose who you want" Ugh, why do I feel like this is gonna be the one glaring issue that'll ruin an otherwise perfect game?? I'm not sure how anyone else feels about this but I personally love replaying levels as different characters, as I think it adds a lot of replay value, and also makes stratigizing which character you pick a thing, and keep in mind this has been a staple of the series since Mario 2, and come on, who doesn't love choosing peach for the glide ability, or Luigi for the high jump?? I'm really hoping this doesn't ruin the experience at all, I personally think it's one of the laziest things to just add a bunch of characters that are nothing but simple cosmetic differences, and I'm extra disappointed about this as I've been waiting for Daisy to be playable in a Mario Platformer FOR YEARS NOW, and now it just feels like a cheap imitation of what I was really hoping for I'm not saying they had to make the characters significantly different, but I'm gonna really miss the subtle differences of playing as each one Also yeah I know they added Badges to change the playstyle, but I personally really hope we get some character exclusive badges that bring back specific characters traditional movesets, cause I think the act of playing as different characters will be a hollow one without this at least being an option
Looks great! Gonna play through the whole game as Daisy!
There's navid
Super Mario Wonder looks fantastic, and different enough that is what 2D Mario needs all this time. Definitely game of the year along with one other game. Definitely gonna get this for Christmas this year!!. Everything just looks clean and new, the power-ups are fun and brand new for the series too.
Maw maw is def a new friend
The Flower Kingdom??? Another world!?! Pure genius
I AM SO EXCITED THERES SO MUCH TO EXPLORE IM SOOO HAPPY
I was hoping they'd just forget about nabbit... Mario luigi peach and daisy are the only real unique characters here after all XD Toads and toadette dont count cause they're ugly and annoying and yoshi only makes sense when you're under the age of five.. Wario and Waluigi are missing which makes no sense at all but I'm pleased by the addition of daisy who could and should  have been in 2D mario since Nsmb Wii.  I really like the artstyle and the new features. Everything beyond questionable characters and obvious choices still missing like Wario..looks really promising
This looks awesome
I HAVE to buy this bro
Yep... Certainly just Mario being on drugs
omg they turned things like the blue baby yoshi from U and the drill from galaxy 2 into powerups 🤑
Best game ever
Oh my god, this looks amazing! I was expecting "New Super Mario Bros Switch" but this is so much more! I wish they'd talk more about the new voice actors, though.
Awesome, no time limit!!
So I have to play as an easy mode character for new abilities? You've completely ruined this game for me nintendo. My Disappointment is Irrmeasureable, and my day is ruined. Thanks nintendo.
I wonder if there will be a splatfest about this game
The music sounds like "Smooth McGrove" and im al for it ❤
Bowser does not look to be in his right head space.
ELEPHANT PEACH WTF
It might be finally a good 2D mario since mario bros wii ! Can't wait to see other play because i don't have a switch XD
So there are 4 power ups? Not as many as I’d want, but they’re all pretty unique.
I like everything they showed about this game, like, everything. The power-ups, the art style, the levels, the amount of ways to play it, and the other stuff. I'm more than confident that I'll buy this game.
Honestly everything was perfect but the badge system not only can you use one but it's only a one time use. Really kills the fun tbh
"i wonder what goombas taste like"
"Suicide rates drop to 0%" All I thought throughout the whole presentation lol
This looks amazing
Yoshi riding Yoshi! Lmao
Nabbit and Yoshis a great add-on for the little buddy mode to play with kids.
So I guess we won’t be needing baby yoshi when when have a bubble flower
This'll never happen because it won't make canonical sense, but please make Bowser Jr a playable character lol.
The characters, the backgrounds, the soundtrack, the features, and the plot. This is Super Wonder-ful! You guys never cease to impress us all!
🥲 Mario Forever!!!
This looks so good
The new game looks sick but I hope you can disable the talkimg flower voice. It sounds so out of place
Need it❤
After finishing lots of Mario games recently I’m excited to play this especially in multiplayer with family and friends.
This game looks phenomenal
huh
I think Nintendo did it again. Unlike games nowadays, I love how they implement the online modes, encouraging a friendlier community and making it less competitive, less toxic and more fun; yes, I'm looking to you, Warzone, Dota...etc.
Never heard someone pronounce Lakitu as "law-kee-two" but alright lol  Also that OLED model where they just made it red and slapped some coin stickers on it is an accurate Nintendo move
They cursed peach tho
Mario got the bubble bobble power up oh my god
5:14 Is it weird that it looks to me like those Koopas bumped shells as they turned back the way some friends bump fists?
looks fun! will be pirating! 👍
This looks so dope
A strand type mario game
wait this is THE best mario game so far dude
Great looking game! They added a ton of new features over NSMBUD, which makes it worth it to try day 1. The Wonder feature brings back "random" chaos and definitely can be fun in a friend/family session where winning isn't always the main goal. Also new is that Bowser merged with the castle (like Marik w/ Ra in Yu-Gi-Oh).  The new badges help players with cool abilities, but I wonder if those are just enhancements to already existing abilities. I liked the vine shooting (ala Spiderman) and the ability to travel just underground. Even the Safety Badge is useful for difficult courses or inexperienced players going over lava. I do like the ghost feature and the standee feature. Being able to revive others makes it more fun for everyone.  There also did not appear to be any time countdown, which is a blessing. The game has so much happening that having the stress of a time limit won't make the experience fun, so I'm glad they took it away (please confirm if this is correct). I also like wandering around the map to complete different stages in any order (within reason). It makes for an open world type experience so the game doesn't have be played linearly all the time.  For the co-op mode, local co-op looks fine. As long as players don't bounce off each other and accidentally kill each other like in NSMBUD I'm all for it. For the online co-op, we can see other players there, but what happens when you are ready to move on? I guess no matter what part of the stage you are in, whatever online players there are at that part of the stage will also be there. Pretty nifty as there could be several online players playing the same stage but at different parts of it.  What I did not like was the statement "they all play the same", when the announcer referred to the human characters. Did they take away the uniqueness of Peach, Luigi, Daisy, and Mario and simply move those traits into the badges? I surely hope not because I want to be able to float with Peach's dress, or jump a bit higher when I'm Luigi.  Overall, the game looks solid and based on this trailer, I would rate it a 8.5/10. That red OLED Switch looks nice, but it's not an improvement if I'm playing on TV with my original Switch. Will definitely get the game upon release as it's been a good while since their last 2D side scrolling adventure.
Mario maker 3 when
SO MANY CHARACTERS  Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi if 4 colors, Toad, Toedette, and nabbit
Can't wait to emulate this game in 10 years
Yes they did it! They confirmed Toadette playable! Thank you very much Nintendo for not leaving it out! Toadette is my number 1 in the Mario saga, now this game is perfect
6:16 soft and wet??????
I like the idea of the badges. But i wish it were a one time unlock and then you keep it as an item. Idk why but I feel like I’m cheating when using consumables like this in game
I loved how Mario never blinked for the whole presentation. 😂
This game is literally as if Mario and friends are in a cartoon! Everyone is animated beautifully! I especially love when Mario jumps off of a vine and flies through the air swinging his arms around, and Yoshi’s new flutter kick! The smears look so stylish! Please keep up this attention to detail, it’s given this game an amazing sense of identity!
I need this game so bad
This looks absolutely excellent. Finally a new direction for 2D, side scrolling Mario.
Looks like Nintendo at the top of their game. Can’t wait! 👍🏻
I NEEEEEED TO PLAY THIS NEW MARIO GAME!!!!
YOU ADDED YOSHI AND NABBIT AS INVINCIBLE CHARACTERS (WHY)
I be looking forward for Super Mario Wonder once I getting that around my Birthday and Christmas presents.
I desperately need to play this.
WOOOOOOOOOO SUPER MARIO WONDER
holy crap i had a dream last year about that EXACT red switch with the coins and everything
"i wonder what goombas taste like..."
Looks good but I really hope you can turn off the annoying flowers in the settings.  I really don’t want to hear that crap the entire time
This might become the best Mario ever!
It’s like a combination of Mario plus Rabbids, the Wonder flower is the megabug that merge bowser with the castle
Dear Nintendo need a Mario vs Sonic or a Sonic and Mario game.
Ok I really hope there's a stage creator in this game, there's to much that I bet Nintendo isn't going to utilize as much as they would if they'd let their games be harder. Like the bubbles as platforms and catching enemies.
4:04 "they all play same" does that mean that no Luigi physics?
The Mario  characters are cuter than ever now! I ❤ the alterations. ☺☺ And the new power-ups are so imaginative and look really fun to use. Can't wait to get my hands on this. :3
Para los que crecimos con Nintendo y en mi caso yo solo veo un Mario más hecho con base a esta época y para está generación porque, parece más new super Mario 4, nada nuevo.
game speedruns are intense
why does the talking flower sound like teddie from persona 4
Everything looks amazing but good ol Nintendo still does not know how to do multiplayer lol
Is it just me or does some of the music sound like @smooth Mcgroove
I really hope we can turn off the talking flowers somehow
charles martinet's last game as mario
This game looks weird AF but seems to be really fun as well!
Did they take a galaxy powerup and call it new?
I have a theory since they added the prince back I think he will steal peach from Mario again
That face when Yoshi has an enemy in his mouth 😂
El Fanservice que todos queríamos y necesitábamos.
I cant freaking wait for this!
The speedrunning potential in this game looks AMAZING Also yoshi on yoshi is super hilarious to me 😂
Bubble Mario has been a skin in Smash for years now
:0
Woah bubble bobble power up
Peach has the most amazing character animations in this game. It makes me want to use her when this releases.
IT'S A STRAND-TYPE GAME
If there is one i wonder what post game content would be for its final level
Why would Nintendo give elephant forms for every one. Disturbing.
oh god the lag must be insufferable when playing online coop.
The first strand type mario game
Why Nabbit tho???
I was 100% confident we would see the video of Miyamoto and Charles in this Direct...Nintendo said to keep an eye out for it and this made all the sense in the world...
I love all the new enemies, I'm also excited about the "goods" that pop up when you stomp an enemy or collect something like there's a combo system.
This new story looks like it will be one of the most creative and unique in the Mario series history.  Edit: I also love the homage to Warioland on Virtual Boy, plus all the new enemies/power ups are so awesome! This will certainly be the greatest Mario game ever made!
It seems too easy and babyish… maybe I’m wrong. What happened to the old super mario?
Looks incredible. Well done, Nintendo. Well done.
The online feature seems really fun! Competing with friends too!
That is easily the CLEANEST Bowser/castle design
Wowie Zowie! This looks great!
Am I the only one who thinks the acapella parts sound like smooth mcgroove?
They had me with intro lol I don’t want to see anymore just want to play and experience it the first time when I’m playing
4:27 The facial expression tho
5:11 - Are those Langoliers?!
4:53 ... When the what attacks?? And they will plow through WHAT???
So no local wireless? Really? it's 2023 cmon
Game looks amazing, but four easy-mode only Yoshi colors and no original Toad color scheme :(
We need nabbit to be playable
They added spiderman
Now I’m excited for 9/13/23 Nintendo, direct
Okay but online play sounds cool though
Love the way the game is but the way how online being treated is trash online co-op could have worked they should have put this back in the oven 😂
Mario finally ate the wrong mushroom and it's great.
I'll love it..I hope my wife will play local co-op with me.. she loves Mario too..  I'll buy this for sure.. maybe day one.. soon
Is the ice powerup and penguin powerup removed?
11:09
Nsmb got NOTHING on this
we eatin' good tonight. 6:06 oh god this is cursed XD
Making 2D Mario great again! Everything looks brand new, and the powerups look great, I'm super excited!
I feel like they could've at least made the online shadows optional and officially have online co-op. Especially with an entire new smb engine, players old and new could have the full interactions and experiences with friends from afar the same way friends play locally. This is very close to online co-op as it possibly got so why not add the full content? Overall, the game is amazing with new enemies, obstacles, and courses as well as the huge roster of characters to choose from. I for one am already going to buy a copy of the game with full interest, but I can't even imagine how much more content it would be throwing your friends around, helping each other to collect the new wonder seeds, and creating funny moments with them along the way! (It's highly understandable if there needs to be an update at a later time along with the online membership being required).
🔥🔥🔥
Came for the Starfield, stayed for the Mario
8:53 no way, Mario inflation.
I really love badges and courses seem nice. I only dislike that first group of characters play the same. Only thing that worries me is that Odyssey was too easy. I don't expect Dark Souls or even Donkey Kong Country (returns), but it would be nice to make some platforming challenges for people over the age of 5. I think Super Mario Galaxy 2 had the perfect difficulty so even the youngest kids could play and improve over time and it's not completely trivial for teenagers/adults. Art style of this game makes me a bit worried that they'll overly balance it for kids (which should be able to enjoy, don't get me wrong), but I think it won't be the case and they will make a good balance.
14:31 captain toad’s first appearance in a 2d Mario game
wow
Looks really awesome! Should be pretty fun to play 🎮
We've never seen this much ambition for a 2D Mario game since the original Super Mario World. We might be looking at the best one yet too.
When Elephant Mario hopped on Yoshi's back, it's like me carrying my team in Apex 😂
Honestly I wasn’t really sold as it didn’t look too much better than 3d world… and then once the wonder flowers were showcased and everything after that, I am now sold 😂
If only Pokémon was 2d
I was worried they would do a peach kidnap story… despite being able to play her. Good to see that’s not the case
i hope this art direction inspired future spin-offs
this might actually be GOTY worthy, obv TOTK was a 10/10 game but this could match it. Italians are making a big comeback this year!
Bowser merging with a castle is admittedly a pretty refreshing sight to see after so many games have just recycled the same trope of him turning giant
Add this to the Super Mario Maker 2 please ;)
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO COME OUT
The online play is a cool feature!
I could do without the talking flowers but it looks fun!
It's a shame that there's just one returning power up.
Well i'll be in bankrup for two months
Easily the best 2D mario to come out this year…
AWESOME
Wish thee was wario and waluigi
Was hoping on old enemies returning, we’re getting lil sparkies and hotheads!
Can’t wait for Goomba Mario, Elephant Daisy, Bubble Toadette, and Drill Peach to all come to Mario Kart Tour.
The online interactions have made me want this game. Seeing the live ghosts playing levels with you makes it feel less lonely in game.
This game screams emasculation smh
Day 1 buy.
This is sick nintendo! I'm gonna buy this in the first day since release date. It's coming in october 20 this year
I was enjoying it until peach and daisy became an elephant. I can’t unsee it XD
So... you can play with your friends online BUT you can't actually play with your friends online. Got it. I hate nintendo's way of doing online modes. They're always 10 years behind
6:05  You have disturbed the horde...
The only thing I am kind of disappointed at is that some characters don’t have unique ways to play but I guess it’s that way for multiplayer
Seeing some of the mechanics from previous games return, like the jump sensitive platforms, is cool. I also love some of the new mechanics, like the elephant and bubble power ups
im disappointed at the lack of full online co-op. its just a kind of loose online multiplayer.
Really looking forward to this
The best part of this was bowser jr
I hope we can know more about the Mario's new VA in the near future!
This just change the Mario Universe. Peach is no longer kidnapped, the characters are expanded, and new monsters ... the greatest revelation
This game single-handedly brought my switch out of retirement  Yes I don’t wanna play TotK, I just don’t
This has some really cool innovations! The online especially looks sick, and the badges will probably add a lot of replay value. It is odd there’s no option for more traditional online multiplayer with friends though.
The game looks great!!!😊😊😊 ALSO did my ears deceive me or was Smooth McGroove recruited to help in the soundtrack for this game??? That's totally awesome to see his glow up after all these years!
indiscutiblemente va a ser el mejor juego de todos (al menos de los 2d)
The PR department deserves a PR award for coining the term, "subtle connection".
No challenges, 0/10.  Just kidding, this game looks absolutely insane and I genuinely can’t wait to get my hands on it.
Peach and Daisy look so cursed when inflated with the Wonder Flower or when they get the Elephant Mushroom
That new mario voice bothers me..
Nintendo getting all souls on us...
dont tell me the final boss is gonna be a space-invaders-esque minigame
6:15 Bubble flower must have been from a fan game they DMCa
Popplins look like Oompa Loompas
U should changed the mario game to New Mario Bros. Wonder
no online coop rip
If this game is somehow bad, which by looking at this direct seems impossible, I’ll still love it because Nintendo actually branched out and tried something new. It’s so good to see after years of the “New” SMB series.
While Mario 3 will alway be my favorite Mario game.  I can't wait to play this. This looks really fun.
I like how everyone turns into elephant, but Peach and Daisy just get elephantiasis.
0:38 he turned himself in to a castle funny's sh*t I've ever seen
Yep. Of course the insanity had to increase with the next game.
They are finally giving Toadette some respect lol! I love playing Mario games as Toadette, and I'm dying to play this game!
I hope the new enemies, items and mechanics make it into a future Mario Maker game.
this is awesome i like to play this game
Only Bowser would think turning into a castle is a good idea. We love him, but my man isn't always smart to say the least.
How many times do we gotta kill bowser 😂😂😂😂
WHOA, Nintendo is going ALL-OUT with this one!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! I TRULY believe this has the potential to be game of the year (and considering this year we got "Tears of the Kingdom" and "Final Fantasy XVI", not to mention have "Sonic Superstars", "Spider-Man 2" and "Super Mario RPG" all on the way, that's not a statement that should be taken lightly AT ALL...seriously, this year has been INCREDIBLE to gamers)!!!
bout time daisy is the rightful player 4
seems a little *safe* removing unique character playstyles, all the new items making it easier to play it safe, and the badges just feeling like bowling bumpers for platforming, kinda rubs me the wrong way ig seems like a cute game, just a little disappointing
Marior
Welp, I know what *the* extra theme of Super Mario Maker 3 will be. I wonder how much they will leave out though
marios crack adventure
Someone on the team had some *very* *very* interesting fetishes
The game hasn't even been released yet, yet it's already one of the best and most original in the franchise ☠️
I was kinda hoping the Animal Power Ups would be more Individual with the characters rather then everyone turning into Elephants like Luigi becoming a Kangaroo, or People becoming a flying squirrel to glide more.
Con razón no habían sacado nada de Super Mario Bros, esque se estaban partiendo la cabeza haciendo esta obra de arte!!! Este juego cambiará por mucho la manera de ver el 2d
This looks like a perfect reimagination of the format! They had to do it after super mario maker:)
I’m actually SO hype for this game. Can’t wait to play local and online. This is GREAT!! =]
Where's Wario and Waluigi? 😠😠
Yeah
I love how corny the narrator is when talking about the game
Wow, this looks and sounds so fun! Can't wait to check it out in a couple months.
Oh my god they brought back the P balloon
Looks fun and awesome. Can't wait to play
Bowser lowkey the illest, most resilient villain of all times😂
Wait they never mentioned if yohsi can get the the power ups? Can he cause I haven’t seen him using the power ups here.
i do not like the talking flowers
12:30  Does Peach have a new voice actress too?
super mario souls?
We’ve peaked
Amazing job!!!
This game looks so good… wow. Everything, from the creative course design to the online/local Co-Op. This may just be the best 2D Mario ever created - and that’s not an easy feat.
Its Bust a Move bubble power!!
Wonder-ful
the best thing i could see on my birthday
I love this men, this game is gonna be fire
just WONDERFULL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚
i can’t believe that they made this a strand type game 12:46
Can’t wait!
I SWEAR MY LIFE IMMA BUY THIS GAME ALONG WITH ONLINE MEMBERSHIP IN MY BDAY
Super stoked for this new game. I have got to get my hands on it 💯💯
Im absolutely loving the new enemies!
My question is, can a yoshi ride a yoshi that is riding another yoshi riding a yoshi? 🤔
A new Mario game…with original characters, new enemies, and AMAZING ideas…okay yep I am BEYOND SOLD
This is probably my favorite 2d mario ever
NINTENDO IS COOKING BRO
Less goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
No Charles Martinet and no Wario or Waluigi??? The game looks cool but those are big disappointments
No Rosalina? 😔
Crazy amount of power up features. Adds a lot of variety to your play style.
8:58 THE NEW VOICE😳
So Bowser become EGO and Guardians of The Kingdoms have to save them.
Cool touch how they laid out the hidden coins on the red oled switch like the coins in the underground section of 1-1
We finally have Daisy, now we just need the Wario brothers to finally make their way to a mainline game.
Super Mario Bros Wonder is a Strand-type game.  No, I will not elaborate.
I could use the same thing by making small changes and playing to do the opposite way. <<<
Of course it's Bowser.  .
We at Nintendo are proud to announce that we have made every single Mario character a little bit fatter and shorter by default, and also can transform into morbidly obese mode by turning into a BIG FAT ELEPHANT. Just for fun, haha. Also, it would be really cool if everyone has to INFLATE up really big sometimes just for fun, haha...look kids, peach and daisy can both inflate to an ENORMOUS size! Wow, just look how big they are!!! I wonder how much fatter Princess Peach and Daisy will get when I turn them into elephants!!
That online stuff is honestly cool, it’s like watch dogs online
6:05 COMMENCE THE FAN ART
Oh my gosh. I'm so excited for this game to come out!
Liking the look of this one
"It's a giraffe!" —Patrick Star
I hope there's an option to silence the talking flowers :P
I hope they have a challenge mode
this is honestly such a nice breath of fresh air for the series, it gives me just the right amount of nostalgia but also novelty and art style to make it fresh and exciting. i cannot wait and also my girl daisy finally being playable in a mainline mario game 😭elephant daisy is so iconic and something i never knew i needed until now 🐘
SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME!!!🙌❤️💚🍄
This game feels like an acid trip and I'm all for it
Game looks absolutely incredible. My only gripe is that everyone shares the elephant power up, and everyone plays the same. I wish there was a reason to play as pther characters like in 3D world!
Now this will be legendary game that’s truely worth 60 dollars     Preordered it and I’m chillin now
My wife is going to sue Nintendo because I let my daughter watch the trailer and now she says she wants this new Mario too, and the wife goes crazy "why so much Mario". What do I do now?
Looks good but I may wait to see how it is.
7:29 Daisy really just dropped Luigis 'Wowie Zowie'
This is gonna such an awesome game!
The OST at 3:14 sounds like it's from Smooth McGroove, love it
Petit Mario mignon, jeux amuson mais il reste toujours le meilleur Mario de la série New Super Mario Bros  J’espère que se nouveau Mario mignature le premier et le dernier que Nintendo fait
I'll never get over the "Wowie-Zowie"s
I thought for sure they would call the elephant power up an elefruit cause it looks like a fruit, but great direct, im exited for the game!
7:29 Nintendo, quit with the teasers and just give us Luigi x Daisy already!
Request Nintendo Direct September 13th 2023
This Nintendo direct it’s totally nailed it ❤ I can’t wait to play new game Super Mario Bros Wonder ❤for Halloween i have to be wearing a Costume Super Mario
Nintendo, you've really outdone yourselves with this new addition of the Mario series. I feel so lucky to be able to experience your older titles and patiently wait to play the new ones. We support you all the way! Onward and upward 😎
Surprised that bowser is the castle now.
This game looks so fun and creative. I can't wait
NABIT’S BACK!
This is the Breath of the Wild of the Super Mario Bros platfform saga :3
Ok but elephant peach tho 😭😭😭
I could imagine the speed runs for this game,they could use those badges and the bubble power up to their advantage.Its INSANE!
Nintendo should just make a Super Mario Bros 3D game that follows the movie that they made
Not the first time bowser touched something to make himself powerful.
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER ALREADY
Let's hope that the online service in this game doesn't lag you in the same way that SMM2 did.
Mario Wonder looks Wonderful!
PLEASE I BEG YOU CHANGE PEACH AND DAISIES SKIN COLOR IN ELEPHANT MODE TO GREY BECAUSE THE SKIN COLOR ONE S THEY HAVE ARE TERRIFYING, other than that it looks sick
Awesome so now we have actual hallucination powerups. Trippy
MAGIC!
2D Mario game design is finally weird and creative again!!
the death stranding mechanic is really cool
This is already the best 2d Mario game
Nintendo give us actual online co-op play challenge (impossible)
I feel so bad for yoshi how is his back not hurting him?
I love the direction Nintendo has went with this game, everything looks so expressive! With Bowser being the castle, I wonder how the boss fight will be?
cool gimmicks with a fun style, and even a good compromise for online coop  BUT WHERE'S WARIO? I LOVE THAT GUY
Watching this made me quite depressed, knowing they pump so much money and investment into the Mario IP, yet completely abandon and ignore the Animal Crossing IP, despite Animal Crossing doing better as a stand-alone IP compared to the entire mario IP.
So we do get to see Fire Daisy!
This game sure looks WONDER-ful! XD
Please tell me there will be an option to disable the talking flowers i feel like they will get annoying
The badge thing seems awesome, this looks great
Why does Yoshi look stoned
we’re gonna have a problem if i can’t mute those damn flowers
THIS. LOOKS. AMAZING.😍
Maybe DLC for new playable characters like Rosalina and Pauline?
Biggest breath of fresh air in years.
I wonder if we can do online play with friends like in Mario 3D world on switch?
0:39 Loved the motif
Nintendo, this looks amazing and I can’t wait for it but please add a setting where we can interact with other players either online or locally like in the old games, where people enjoy the chaos of picking each other up and throwing them.
Ceave Gaming will be thrilled that we can ride a Yoshi... as a Yoshi (in co-op)
This is such a fresh twist for 2d mario games. Thank you Nintendo for making 2d mario games fun again
3:28 yeah thats cool and all but whens the next donkey kong game?
i hate the flowers voice, was hoping for a cape feather or racoon leaf power up aw well looks fun annyway
I'm more of a Sonic fan, but that won't stop me from being hyped for this.
ngl little disappointed by the Yoshi being easy mode, hoping for some modders to fix that
Nice to see Pathfinder branching out
Bubble power up Is canon now
This game feels like a complete acid trip so far, and I’m here for it.
We don't want another painted console, we want the switch 2 already :)
This new bowser theme sounds awsome
the multiplayer gameplay are so nice, also if you have discord you just have to find people to play with , thats nice
2:37
This has to be most colorful and creative Mario game since Super Mario World on the Snes.
I wish Nintendo put this much effort into their Mario sports spin-offs
"It's not just mario that can turn into an elephant."  me: "no..."  "don't you do it..."
Looks amazing the only thing I’m not convinced on is Mario’s Voice!!!
This game is going to be great. The visuals are vibrant and alive. The power ups are inventive and creative. Online play is here. There are so many characters to choose from. And best of all, the badge system would be incredible! This game was MADE for Mario fans.
is that the new prince peasley !!
3:34 That flower is a psychopath.
What is Nabbit’s deal; Nintendo please I need to know
It's been a whiel since I have been excited for a new game, but man, this one looks so good
The badge system looks pretty neat
This is going to be the best Mario game
BRO IM GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING THIS!!
the best game❤
When playing Mario odessy I looked at the planet from the moon and I thought that Mario’s world was so cool, now we have another installment where we see even more of his amazing world, I love this franchise I can’t wait for more games in the future! ❤️
I INSTANTLY thought of TCNick3 3:58
Wow, an interesting 2d Mario game? Surprising
Seems like there will be a lot of replayability with all the new power ups, badges, and the wonder seed mechanic. I'm actually excited for a new 2D Mario game - It's been quite some time.
YEahhhh lets just make the switch red and add a teeny tiny silhouette of Mario on the back, and put coins on a part you'll never see. Now that's what i call a good product. Thanks Nintendo.
Hagan al príncipe Florian jugable en alngun próximo Mario kart
No cambia nada
12:11 The Dark Souls of Mario games lmfao
this game is literally gonna be the ultimate ever
This game is the GOD of platformers
This is a lot to take in. I'm just hoping it's not too much. By the way, Mario reminds me of Sonic with the Jet Run badge at 10:38.
If I had a nickle for every time the latest new title of a series introduced a new power up that turned the main character/s into a drill I would have 2 nickles, which isn't a lot but it's SUPER strange that it happened twice.
this is insane
That online multi-player mode looks so cool, and the entire game seems extremely creative. Im going to be getting this game on launch day.
Where's Wario??
This is shaping up to be the best 2D Mario game
I am so glad I watched this entire Direct I am so excited that Toadette is in the game and we can play as her or Nabbit too! I feel like maybe we should have unlockable Characters in the game that way it even be way more fun.  Characters you can Play as when you first play the game or for a few days:  Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yellow Toad, Blue Toad, Daisy, Yoshi, Red Yoshi  Unlockable Characters you can get in-game by doing a specific task like how Mario Kart Double Dash, Wii, 7, Character Unlock System Works:  Toadette, Blue Yoshi, Yellow Yoshi, Nabbit  When All Those extra Characters Unlocked:  Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Daisy, Yellow Toad, Blue Toad, Toadette, Yoshi, Red Yoshi, Yellow Yoshi, Blue Yoshi, Nabbit  Now that’s how you can make the game more fun by including Unlockable Characters as well.
Noooooo they ruined Yoshi
Question. Can a Yoshi riding Yoshi ride a Yoshi riding a Yoshi? Asking for a friend.
Was a little surprised that a Super Mario Bros. game was going to get its own dedicated Direct.  Now I know why. That's a *_lot_* of new content!
The only thing I’m disappointed in is not being able to play online like coop play
Yoshi can ride Yoshi... Nintendo, I thought you were a kid friendly game company! Btw, what year is this? A new open-world Zelda game, A new weird and unique Mario game, AND (DLC for) a new Xenoblade game? did we somehow travel back to 2017 again? Or did the Switch 2 launch and somehow no one noticed?  Jokes aside, this game looks incredible, and I'm even more exited to play this than I was for Odyssey when it released. Being able to revive from another player online who has nothing to do with me blew my mind away!
That's 19 days after my birthday
Hoping we eventually get a Rosalina to play as in a free DLC update.
Yellow toad toadet nab it
OMG THIS BLEW MY MIND
This might be the best 2d mario yet, that badge feature hopefully will add so much replayability
I really wish Rosalina and Wario were also playable here.
That online feature is really cool
I know Wonder would have multiplayer but I didn't expect it to have an online mode and seeing people travel through stages. You can even interact with other players in the stage as well. I'm definitely buying the game when it releases.
It's funny how everybody completely assumed that Mario would be the only one with the elephant ability
This looks like the funnest Nintendo video game in deacades
Man the music sounds so much like Smooth McGroove!
MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
What is Nintendo direct?
The game looks fun and cool, hyped!
Notan como Nintendo se aburrio de lo cliché de que peach es secuestrada? Las últimas entregas han Sido distintas.
This voiceover guy they’re using is really terrible
I am loving this new Mario Finally 2D Mario returns to greatness it deserves
You just created a heaven on earth, NINTENDO!!
This looks incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a great super mario game i really can't wait to play this
i'm hyped but still sad that there's no online co op even though mario 3d world did it, ghost stuff doesn't count.
wait guys, super mario bros maker 2 wonder theme? that would be awesome. probably in smm3 though because nintendo said they wouldn't be updating 2 anymore. it better be on the switch though because i do NOT have enough money for another console pffff
I can just see how crazy "mario maker 3" will be with wonder-flower 😵
4:35   Rip ninji you will be missed 😔
*new super mario bros wonder         Cant wait for this game tho
This looks pretty awesome, actually.
nintendo literally deleted all my comments my life is ruined
Mama mia
This is the most inspired Mario game I’ve seen in a while
So they replaced Charles Martinet with AI? That's what happened, right?
I’ve never been more excited about a Mario game until now.
This has GOT to be one of the greatest Mario games ever!!!! It would be cool though if in the online version, at least in the *create a room* area, the other players were not seen as shadows and instead worked more like the local co-op mode. It would just be more fun if it felt lile your friends are ACTUALLY there instead of just being shadows on the backgrouns, you know? It should be too hard!
Deviantart is gonna have a field day with this… they will show no mercy on Peach and Daisy
Ok, now i am really hyped lol
Very excited for this.
I'm so ready for the talking flower% Speedrun category
3:34: "I wonder what Goombas taste like..." that cute flower is wild.
A switch in all red is the dream coming true
Amiibo please
But what about elephant Yoshi or elephant Nabbit?
This look like NSMB mix with Rayman Legends love it
HOLY MACARONI THEY BROUGHT BACK BLUE TOAD!!!!
Great direct!
I wish there would be 8 player co-op
Making an online mode dedicated to competing for the title of "nicest person" is such a Nintendo thing to do
OMG THEY ALL SAY "Wowie Zowie!!" THIS GAME WILL BE GREAT!
I do like challenge myself and not use any of those badges if it’s optional, or help from other players till I finish it 100%
This game really makes you FEEL like a castle
Damn, yoshi is easy mode? Idc I'll still use yoshi
Ok cool. A new 2D Mario. Now give me super Mario odyssey 2
why is yoshi rideing a red yoshi
I can imagine the speedrunners are going crazy right now.
imagine all four players being yoshi and they mount on each other 💀
Man, I can't wait to spam crouch and emotes online!
The badges are really cool.
Side-facing mouthful Yoshi is the definition of that "it's not real, it can't hurt you" meme.
"Pipes might start moving", "You might end up in a free fall", "Makes you float in space", "You might change perspective"?????  Is it just me or does the wonder flower sound like some psychedelic drug?
I love the idea of the badges.  Changes up the  gameplay, while still keeping it fairly simple and not overwhelming the player with lots of abilities.
7:25 They changed the A button, I didn’t think they’d actually do it. I mean at this point B is the jump button so it makes sense
Elephant peach and elephant toad are hella cursed
11:58  NO THIS CANT BE
this game is going to be PERFECT
welp, my wallet is safe!
So it's basically like any other mario game lol
I changed my Sonic Superstars preorder to SMBW. Wow this looks amazing.
Now we’re talking. I have a feeling imma be playing Yoshi
The first strand-type Mario game
This has to be my new favorite SMB game now, you’ve really nailed it Nintendo!
While I am still hyped for the game, I wonder why the four main characters do not control like in Super Mario Bros. 2. Everybody and their grandmothers wished for the control scheme of Super Mario Bros. 2 and now we got informed that all characters play the same. Besides that I believe we are in for a treat... : )
You can throw up is all I needed to see
I’m so happy this exists.
I LOVE IT IT’S SO GOOD
RIP to my wallet
I honestly change my mind about this game! From the first trailer, I hated this game woth a burning passion. Now, while it's still not the best, it's not God awful after I saw more! I might actually play this now!
Elephant peach I’m dead 💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😭
imagine wanting to play yoshi, but nintendo says "NABBIT RESKIN SUPER EASY MODE FOR NO REASONS BUT TO GIVE PAIN!" like why? whats the point? nabbit allready exists, so why make yoshi the exact same aswell?
Nah I thought Yoshi was the same as Mario   >:(
00:23 Was that the beginning of the Mario World Boswer's Castle theme?
Wowie-zowie this is looking to be the best 2D Mario game yet. Hopefully there are some good challenges so that it doesn’t end up being trivially easy
Literally Dark Souls Mario with the online ghosts!!
They made some "people" "kinks" canon 💀
but Nintendo, I am Paglia--I mean  I have no friends.
First sentence I hear: "UuUuHh... Suiciding!"
I wonder (pun intended) if each player can use a different badge, that would make collecting flower coins more easy
The fact this game has online/friend rooms already makes it have so much replay ability. Can’t wait for this!
6:05  Nintendo already knows what they’ve unleashed…
So, can Yoshi's also use the new power-ups?
Bowser loves to create chaos. I love him he he
1:09 Hey it’s not my idea to go in there bud…
IM SO EXCITED
cant wait for this one !!!  Happy Collecting !!!
If they were gonna make the flowers talk they could’ve at least made their voices less annoying
6:05 Does Nintendo even realize the enormous can of fetish worms they have unleashed here?
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK finally updated the New Super Mario Bros gameplay the Bubble suit is cool and the elephant i still cant get behind. I just love that DAISY is playable LOL and Yoshi looks great but don't like the fact they don't turn the enemies into Eggs just spit them back out a minor gripe otherwise Wonder looks like a TON of FUN.
Masterpiece!
this is mario heaven.
wish there was online co op, that unfortunately might be what killed this potentially wonderful game for me
I love the music. It's so nice. In general the vibe is different and lovely. Excited to pick it up later this year.
This looks more ambitious than any 2D Mario I've ever seen.
Why don't they just put Bowser in jail already? He can't keep getting away with this!
The badges are going to add so much replayability, it’s gonna be freakin’ awesome.🔥🔥🔥
Nice
0:36 Don't you think these particles look like those of Super Mario Sunshine?
Y'all really took out my boy blue toad for MID yellow toad bring him back
“I wonder what goombas taste like”- talking flower. Truly a question to ponder.
Game Of The Year!
Trust me when I say a Yoshi on top of a Yoshi is op ong
Ok I was thinking about pre order mk1 over this and now I’m not going to I’m buying this!
Mario, Luigi, Toads, Toadette, Peach and Daisy playing the same is slightly disappointing. One of the main appeals of Super Mario Bros 2 and 3D World is the playable characters all being slightly different.
Bowser be going metal in that take over cutscene! 👹💀😼
What NSMB wishes it was.
I haven't been this hyped for a 2D mario game since New Super Mario Bros on DS
10 outta 10, this looks so dope
Rayman legends:am I a joke to you
I see dashie playing this and raging 😂
I'm honestly pretty excited for this now! I know a friend who was BEYOND excited for a new 2D Mario game that was actually new, unlike the "New" SMB games since the DS. We were hoping this game would have Online functionality, and it does! Although not in the way we were expecting. This is pretty nice too, though. It reminds me a lot of Death Stranding's online functions.
This comment is for the user "@Personthatexist"  Stop, nobody takes seriously your lame attempts to be a troll, If you don't like Nintendo just block the channel lol
They should really bring back the Beanbean Kingdom (which bordered the Mushroom one) sometime.
Can't wait to see fan artwork for mario & bubble bobble
The excitement is real.
The badges seem very similar to the ones in a Hat in Time (Not saying they copied it's not that unique of a feature it just reminds me of it.)
Ladies and gentleman, we may have lost the Koopas vibing to the BAH’s, but now we get Koopas bumping their shell together bro-fist style whenever they collide.  I am fulfilled
“Peachette won’t be in this game. We got so sick of the memes.”
So there’s not only the elephant power up but ALSO the P BALLOON?! And you can play as PEACH?!
Literally Mario galaxy as a NSMB game
O Bowser não desiste nunca. Cadê os Koopalings?
O Bowser não desiste nunca. Cadê os Koopalings?
O Bowser não desiste nunca. Cadê os Koopalings?
Nabbit got done dirty the hole thing.
O Bowser não desiste nunca. Cadê os Koopalings?
Online feature sold me the game.
they should of put 8 red coins on the new RED oled model?
Well... this and with all the other upcoming Nintendo games... RIP my wallet.
The Maw-Maw brings back memories of Boss Bass from Super Mario Bros. 3.  🐟
Only thing I hate is that they babied the Yoshis too much. That little detail sticks out like a sore thumb compared to how good the rest of this showcase is, since I was looking forward to playing as light blue Yoshi…
It's sad to see how the prolonged use of mushrooms has effected Mario...
This looks fantastic.
This is insane, I am so happy they are going for something new.
Yoshi can ride yoshi?!?!
What I wouldn’t give for a Mario Maker 3 based on this game 😭 these new powerups and enemies would be a dream come true for the builder in me
CAN DIFFERENT PLAYERS EQUIP DIFFERENT BADGES THIS IS IMPORTANT
I only wish they added character differences like a float or jump! Also does Daisy sound different or is it just me…
I can’t wait to play as all the characters
I love how charming and funny the characters look!
Nintendo keeping couch co op alive
I thought the Flower Kingdom would be part of Daisy's Kingdom
Nintendo why did you spoil so many wonderflower effects  :/
Well better start making customs
Really starting to seem like Bowser is bit of a troublemaker
And once again, Nintendo proves they have nothing to fear from Sonic the Hedgehog.
Ohhhh I can’t wait to see this game and play it
oh we're so back
BLUE TOAD!!
Looks incredible, Daisy is finally playable!!
Let’s a gooo i can’t wait  hope y’all have the same amount of fun I’ll have and I’ll see y’all there
And here's why the Switch will not die anytime soon. Because it doesn't necessarily need big hardware to make great games. Especially exclusives
Time to ready to play with the family as a yoshi because i sometimes like being a support!
I like the part when Mario does drugs
6:06 thanks I hate it 😭
0:00 Story 1:44 Flower Kingdom (World's & Courses) 3:47 Characters & Enemies 5:23 New Power-Ups 7:41 Wonder Flower & Wonder Seeds 9:25 Badges 11:15 Play Together (Local & Online Co-op) 14:15 Conclusion & New OLED Mario Switch
All really great additions love the ghost feature, great job Nintendo 👍🏼
They made Yoshi easy mode?! Im triggered
Looks awesome. Still not a fan of making certain characters only available as an 'easy mode'. I want the option to play as Nabbit or Yoshi without being invincible. Or how about a character that makes the game more difficult for the players that want to up the challenge?
0:47 Look at Daisy helping Toadette.
This game looks great but I’m not excited to see art of the elephant forms…
this looks like the most fun I'll ever have had with a 2d mario game since nsmbds
We are so back
BLUE TOAAAAAD
Wow, definitely picking this up for my little sister and I
So I assume there's not gonna be a star power in this game, right? It would be a big change and a big risk to get rid of a power up like that, but I think chaning the star for the wonder flower is a fresh change for a new and improved 2d game "generation" (to call it a certain way).
While I'm not great at 2D Platforms. With no pun intended, this game has quite a beautiful bouquet of new mechanics and creativity and I really have to tip my hat to the team on this one. It's already going to be a fantastic new Mario entry!
"Wowie zowie!"
This is a work of art.
Very excited to see speedruns for this game!
The original NEW super Mario bros was one of my favorite games as a kid. Wii was pretty fun as well but by the time of U the series felt very stale and boring to me. Even as a 12 year old I never beat U.  But Wonder genuinely looks like a lot of fun, I was already sold from the initial reveal.But these badges adding new movement mechanics is an amazing idea that allows for more player freedom and unique level design.
I like that there is online play
I feel like im getting the same feeling from new super Mario bros on the wii, so many memories were made with that game and it was by far my favorite 2d side scroller ever as a kid, im so excited for this game
You should make it 8 player's were are brothers or sisters and mom and dad could play as well
That's not a wonder flower. That's a mushroom and we all know it. Nintendo aint fooling nobody.
Deviantart gonna have a field day with this one
Only thing I really don't like is the talking flowers - the level design of mario games are typically intuitive enough to not need this kind of prompting
Much of what I'm seeing beyond gameplay here feels very similar to the RPG games from the late alphadream, it's even down to the overall, let's say, "weirdness" in its themes and such, I mean consider things like the drill powerup showcased, its either a reference to the drill from galaxy, or the drill ability in the RPG games and im leaning toward the latter.  Maybe I'm simply reading into this too much and its copium, but regardless I love the direction they took with this, and really look forward to its release.
4:27 Yoshi’s mouth looks cursed
The characters not having their character specific abilities is a shame but otherwise this game looks so much fun
haven't been excited for a 2d mario game in such a long time.
Is Elephant Mario jumping on Yoshi animal abuse or animal abuse? 😂
Bro what now nintendo can't even afford people to properly edit their uploads?
Hi Nintendo always make us so hype
Wow
I feel this game looks fine & I’m sure it’s gameplay will be at least rock solid  HOWEVER  I’m still not moved all that much by this game After nearly 2 decades of the tired NSMB formula & considering  a record breaking movie blockbuster I don’t feel this is ambitious enough 🤷🏾‍♂️
This game really just makes you wonder huh?
Game look 🔥 Nintendo good job
Every Wonder Flower got that Green "Wonder" Flower effect
BETTER GET IT TOGETHER NINTENDO!!! Sad, other platforms focus on amazing things like Starfield and other triple-A stuff. And Nintendo focuses on...well...kindergarten stuff. They better get their damn act together, or I will be done will Nintendo forever. As a 50yr old gamer, I'm tired of the kiddy stuff. Would be nice if I was 10, but I'm not.  My Switch is collecting dust. Lack of amazing triple-A games because it cannot run them. If the next Nintendo console doesn't put out more grown up games, more triple-A titles, then I will use it for a cup holder or spare parts for something.
Man it look so fun :D
Yeeeees, Nabbit is back!
6:05 what have you done... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.
Yoshi riding Yoshi. 😂 10/10. This game is nonsense and I love it.  The animations are so insanely smooth and lively.  So many vivid colors it's a trip.  The new power ups open new mechanics. The badges add even more new options. This is going to be tons of fun with friends or even random online people.  It'd be fun if courses aren't timed and you can chill and see how many people you can help out on a course.
I will say. I never thought Mario would embrace and build upon the Dark Souls casual multiplayer system.
I think this could be the best mario game ever, there is just so much things to do in this game and I love the new mechanics and the art style
there is twelve characters, TWELVE CHARACTERS.
YES YES YES!
Love the badges and incentives to help other players. Looks really fun.
I wonder if Prince Florian and the Flower Kingdom are a reference to Prince Haru and Kibidango from the 1986 anime Mario movie... if so, that's a nice nod to the first Mario movie
Unpopular opinion: Obviously this new 2D Mario game looks interesting though I still like the New Super Mario Bros games as they were still good and fun
2:50 Is that Smooth McGroove?
The bubble powers remind me of Bubble Bobble, it's the crossover i never knew i needed.
Amazing! Good job nintendo!
Speed runs for this are going to be insane!
Pedal Isles sounds like pedophiles XD
Bro bowser turned him into a castle lmao 😂
BLUE TOAD !!
Wow, Nintendo and Mario got new characters from Wonder! Prince Florian and more! BRILLIANT!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I want that drill mushroom.
I was gonna give this game a pass, but it actually looks really cool! Am I the only one who finds the Yoshis a bit unsettling here? The way their bottom lip covers their nose when they eat stuff is a little creepy.
This game looks like it oozes personality. Was a bit on the fence about it, but I’m totally on board now. This looks so fun!
When I was younger, I would always dream of a new 2D Mario game. And now, that dream is about to come true.  I am super excited for this.
Can yoshi’s easy mode be toggled off? Like what if you just want to play as yoshi but don’t want the easy mode?
Hello there_ :D
This is one weird game. But I love it. 😄
Beautiful
Drill mario is back from galaxy 2?!!!
This game is gonna sell better than freaking totk this game will go down in history
I can see all the challenge videos coming with for example the invisible badge xD, whole game using that
Probably the best side scrooling Mario game ever made. Congrats Nintendo, this game is looking awesome!
This looks amazing
This was a very interesting direct in my opinion. The the artstyle definitely still looks a little weird. it's not bad, actually it looks quite good in fact but it will still take some getting used to since visually it's a pretty major departure from what we've seen before. I actually kind of don't want to watch all of the gameplay simply because I don't want to be spoiled too much, but everything I've seen looks like it will be a ton of fun, and I bet it will be even better if it will have the standard 4 player multiplayer like the other games.
The vocals in the music reminded me of Smoove Mcgroove
no koopalings? 🥲💔💔
That's really dumb that they couldn't get online to work fully... I was looking forward to playing with some friends in a discord call but guess not...
I'm sad we didn't get more informations about the bosses.
maybe for a 3rd wonder seed they can have a bonus objective like captain toad treasure tracker
I guess it's Lockey-tu now, not Lack-itu or La-key-tu
Sooo... Instead of getting more characters to play as we get... Colored toads and Yoshi's... What a joke.
This is an important question and maybe hopefully a great change. A button is for item. So b button is probably jump. So zr is sprint ?????!!!! That would make these games sooooo much better
This is probably going to be the most expressive, most creative Mario game yet.
Wowie Zowie indeed! 😂❤
This direct was amazing but to bad the different characters don’t become different animals
Daisy 😁
Yo wait, top-down Mario might be it.
10:06 "HERMIT PURPLE!"
are we not gonna talk about the game not having player collition...? it looks great and all but what is the fun in mario when i cant throw my cousin into a pit???
Wonder if the koopalings will return. It wouldn't make sense for the only bosses in the game to kamek and bowser jr. Kamek and junior could be like tower bosses.
I think it's hilarious that the only character to receive full voice acting is a flower that just sounds like a regular dude 💀
This game looks so fun! And I'm so glad that Princess Daisy has been added to a main Mario game; she's my main go-to Mario character so this makes it even more awesome!
I hope there id gonna be a Super Mario 3D World: Wonder xD
If they have such powerful items like the wunder flower why do they leave them In plain sight for Bowser to take?
Yeah yeah, love it, now where is a new Donkey Kong Country game?
A new 2d Mario game I'm actually excited for? Pinch me I must be dreaming
oh god no, they all gave them the elephant form
Damn no Rosalina. Still a great looking game, heavy excited.
Calling it now, this is gonna be the best 2D mario game Edit: while i wouldve preferred a different antagonist for the game, the way they did bowser in this with him just being a straight up castle is pretty neat
If Yoshi could have at least got wing,fire, and earthquake powerup this game would be perfect     Daisy is love, Daisy is life
I have a feeling the Lava World won't be the last one
you guys let the best to the final, the multiplayer mode! make me want to buy an switch just to play it online with everybody
So super mario bros wonder has 7 ereas well i hope super mario bros wonder won't be a short game like the other super mario games
I don’t like that all the characters play the same :(
EXCITING
I have a new kingdoms to  A New super mario Odyssey 2
“The Super Mario Bros. Wonder game” I hate this new trend of Nintendo game presentation.  Other than the slightly cringey flower voices, this game looks incredible.
what a W for the Mario franchise. everything here is just updated and refreshing
Nintendo always fails to disappoint 💟🌌☮️
5:17 what
Wished Wario and Waluigi were also selectable characters...
Soooo amazing
this looks like game of the year
Game looks incredible, better then I expected!! Can’t wait to play this with my son & family 😁
So creative and full of content!
You could say that this game looks Wonderful.....but seriously though, it looks great and I can't wait to play it!
Wait Mario Wonder has the Kirby Bubble Power? Awesome!
No one:  Talking flowers: I wonder what Goombas taste like…
Kind of looks like a kirby game but with morr to do
4:26 NOT BOOPKINS!! (This comment is just a joke)
They’re really getting innovative with this one. It’s gonna get crazy once we finally play it
The online features is dope
4:47 replace the N with a M
Looks so fun and rich with personality!
I can hear Smooth McGroove singing the acapella song in the background XD I will look forward to such a video.
Hoping they keep these new character designs
Elephant Peach and Daisy. It happened Lol
this trailer alone sold me
"I wonder what Goombas taste like." He might as well have said "I wonder what humans taste like" lol
"and blow up like a balloon!" so... the elephant just WASN'T enough, nintendo?
I’m really excited for this but I’m definitely looking forward to the rpg remake more
This looks sooooo good! I cant wait!
Looks fun and wonderful!
i hope i can make the flower shut up...
New Super Mario Bros. SWITCH:  Bowser brings grungy Metal to Mario World...
lol pipe rock plateau
Dude, a strand type game 🌌💟☮️
Man. Imagine if Dark Souls had that Player Ghost system.
Above all else, this game is going to be FUN
Awesome!  This game is going to be so fun!
BLUE TOAD IS BACKKKK
Bowser castle lol
my only gripe is that using yoshi is basically easy mode
I really admire the effort put into this project. So great to get a new 2D Mario after so long!
Definitely has some great creativity, but it still feels like just an extension of the NSMB franchise with the standard evergreen art style. I’ll definitely buy and enjoy this like I always do, but I miss the amount of secrets and weirdness of titles like Super Mario World or Superstar Saga
Mehh
I love how you can turn into enemies when you touch the wonder flower kind of reminds me of super Mario Odessy
It does amaze me how Nintendo manages to make the best music ever heard to man for these games.
12:05 they actually did it. they literally made the dark souls of mario games
I HATE that the online play seems worth trying.. I ain't paying for it, though
Oh my gosh, Bowser became M.O.D.O.K.  And I thought Bowsette was the cringiest power form
Holy cow, this looks REALLY good. And I'm not even a huge 2D side scroller fan!
The art team went WILD with this and it paid off. It is stunning to look at.
Altso it’s Mario on drugs game
i preordered this game
This only proves ALIENS ARE REAL! Because this game is OUT OF THIS WORLD. ❤
Mario Maker would be busted if they added everything from here lol
I've already bought it. Waiting for it ❤
this channel is lucky nintendo hasnt copyrighted them yet    /s
Speedruns of this game are going to be INSANE. Well done, Nintendo.
Badges? We don't need no stinking badges
Nabbit + Safety bounce = win win
I hope this is not baby easy difficulty and have a good challenge and aftergame
This looks incredible. Me and My daughter are going to love playing this game, so excited!
I was very sure i would not buy this game intil now
sey
I want it to be October 20 so bad
The VA they hired for the flowers sounds like a manga dub VA
cool online play! it's just too bad nintendo switch online sucks.
Anyone else think the speaker was arrowstotle?
Cant wait 😍
Wooooooo. This is the best thing.
gráficos mais bonitos, nova lore, novas mecânicas, novo estilo de multiplayer e novos poderes e itens, tá potente Nintendo
Woooow 😍
Can’t wait to ride my homies
Great trailer. I’m definitely gonna buy this game. But, I will turn off the voice of the talking flowers because they sound annoying ngl
It’s official!! I am buying this game!
this is amazing! i shame on me for ever doubting!
Anyone else watching these new power ups and thinking how they will use them in the Next Mario Maker?
Rest in Peace "Bah Bah" You will be missed
Huh. So the person who said that only Mario would get the Elephant power-up was making things up? Honestly not that surprised.
Haazaa subtle multiplayer! One step closer to the real thing
Seeing player shadows online and leaving a standee for people to rate makes me think of Dark souls and the orange soapstone messages lol
I cannot clap at Nintendo enough for this!  Class is permanent
I really want whatever these devs were smoking
Can we turn off the Talking Flowers?
So many new abilities... It'll be fun to master them all.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!
This gunna be awesome!! I'm gonna play online when I get the game!
Why can't we play Bowsette?
This looks really great but I can't stand that talking flower
Is this flower fields basically from paper Mario lmao 😂
He turned himself into a castle. Funniest crap I've ever seen.
Wasn't expecting Super Mario Bros. Wonder to be the next Strand-type game
Why does it have the Mario rpg jump sound effect?
How are we getting a more Paper Mario game in a mainline entry than we are in an actual spinoff entry? The story here is super unique with a pretty large amount of lore. And it has actual badges that have functions! LOL!  Jokes aside, this looks absolutely incredible. So fresh and new!
Now THIS is what we wanted! So much charm and personality! Outlandish and fun ideas, unique and interesting new characters and enemies, varied and unique areas and so much more!
Ugh.... why are lives still a thing -_-
"OOH SO EXCITING" I thought that was Mario at first... thank god it wasn't I was about to puke.
I’m so excited for super Mario bros. Wonder :D
This is gonna be the best 2D Mario game ever!
Nintendo has truly outdone themselves with this.
I’m not kidding Luigi bowser turned into castle funniest thing I’ve seen
wowee zowee
I love how nintendo did everything in their power to make online multiplayer for this game, except adding online multiplayer
Mid
Needs rosalina 0/10
LOCK-EE-TOOZ?  It's "LACK-IT-OOZ".
No silksong :( /s
This feels like the first 2D Mario game to actually go toe-to-toe with Super Mario World. Also I gotta say, I love that, unlike in NSMBUD (god these names are getting long), I love that there's enough character options for regular play and also "little sibling" play, as I call it. Being able to let your kid or younger relative hop on your back as a yoshi and literally help carry them through a level is genius, and is definitely making me wanna play this with my little sis.
God that badge mechanic makes this game a must buy for me
“I wonder what Goombas taste like”💀
The drill power up is straight up a mario&luigi reference
Nintendo, please just let us play the local multiplayer online, 3D World did it so well. That’s my only criticism though otherwise I’m loving this game, it looks like so much fun!
3:52 Y'all know that nintendo thit on purpose
This would’ve been the perfect Mario game to bring back Wart as the big bad instead of Bowser
The game looks amazing. This is genuinely the first Mario game I've genuinely had an interest in playing in a long time. That OLED also looks great. I said I wasn't going to get an OLED with the Switch 2 coming, but with the rumor that it will start off with an LCD, and because this is a nice red version OLED, I'm quite tempted to pick it up.
This game looks awesome in every way, but why the heck is Yoshi invulnerable? And why is there Yoshi and Nabbit if Yoshi is just Nabbit with extra abilities? It would've been great if Yoshi acted like Toadette in NSMBUDX, where you could still use powerups and take damage but with a few abilities that other players can't use. But here Yoshi and Nabbit are nearly the exact same and Toadette has no special abilities.
You guys NAILED IT!
This looks so fun and im loving the online options.
Imagine the bubble tech in a speedrun
FIRST!
I love everything about this except the talking flowers, really hoping they can be turned off! 33:17
NABBITS BAAAAACK
Looks really great, shame that Yoshi can't be hurt though. I wish easy mode was a toggle for any character instead of locking some characters behind easy mode because not being able to take damage will just make the game boring.
But can you be a yoshi riding a yoshi riding a yoshi riding a yoshi?
based
This game is WONDERFUL!
Wtf this look incredible
Forced soul
The multiplayer features be like Death Stranding x Mario
So Mario finally doen it, he went to drugs to find a way to forget about Peach rejectig him after all those years, I feel sorry for the man himself...
Let’s be honest. We want it. NOW
Multiplayer = CUPHEAD DIS IS CUPHEAD
Well i certainly learned alot from this single game direct... Yoshis have incredible back and/or leg muscles.
this sucks we needed real online play... i hate it when nintendo does this
This has me wishing for Mario Maker 3
Why has Bowser not been executed for his crimes yet?
A story, large cast of characters traveling with Mario, good gameplay, and even badges. It’s nice to know that the 2D Mario devs are listening to Paper Mario fans.
This game looks amazing!!!!
Gooooodddd this looks so good
This makes Sonic Superstars underwhelming in comparison especially with the online features that Wonder has too.
2026年春、super mario bros. wonder 2の発売を希望します^ - ^
The drugs mario's been doing are definitely harder than before.
O Travis Touchdown narrando mano kk
Now that’s one trippy looking game! So looking forward to it.
Kinda wish there was a demo
Bowser’s theme had no reason to go that hard 🔥
This feels like a Rayman game... Which is GREAT!!!
sad that this game is extremely vibrant and artsy but the switch that goes with it is just solid red
there should be a local wireless  too
THEY ADDED A  GRAPPLING HOOK TO MARIO, LETS A GO BABEH
Already from the worlds, power ups, characters moves, and even the music. Wonder is a Mario game that truly deserves the definition of “remarkable.”
One trippy Mario game we got here
I love elephants 🌌💟☮️
Didn't know this was happening cool I'm a bit late but hey
4:35 HOPCAT SUPER SMASH BROS?!?!?
One of the best directs this year!
We all though the shroom where magic...but it w+s actually the flowers !!
Siblime, simplemente gano el gaming
the only flaw is the talking flowers seem super annoying
Wonder flower will gonna make you get high 🤢🤮😂 shroom
This game looks awesome.
Will there be a time limit for each level ? I hate these
They could have made Wario and Waluigi playable without even having to give them special abilities or anything, and instead we got 3 Toads and 4 Yoshis.
Truly a wowie zawie moment of all time
It’s interesting that because of Mario Maker we are finally getting an inventive Mario side scroller. The days are gone where simply making a “New” Super Mario bros game in the exact same art style are gone! Now hopefully the “Wonder” style isn’t dragged through the mud as well. 🤞
they should make  an online against random people to see who can clear stages first
I hope it is changed so multiple badges can be equipped at once
Nintendo is having fun again ❤
I cannot imagine the fan art that will spawn thanks to that Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct. Especially from 14:49.
really wanted yoshie in human form fml
Wonder seeds are definitely acid
Looks like there are going to be lots of optional features to help novice players, thats really sweet.   Looking forward to it!
Those online features are great. It's almost like playing a Mario MMO!
traduz pra português Nintendo, na humilda
Ok for all the troopers go on rule 34 and look up elephant peach for us please
So basically the gang gets high whenever they get a Wonder Flower... neat!
Looks awesome! I wish the Wario bros were playable though.
So it's just NSMB again...
MY BOI NABBIT LETS GOOOO
so glad they're finally done milking the "new" series, it's been more than like 10 years of basically the same game
I just hope they let multiple players have different badges since they kinda glossed over that
First, Yunobo becomes a Drug Lord during the Upheaval…  Now, Mario and friends gets some drugs…   *NINTENDO DOING DRUGS CONFIRMED?!?!*
os gráficos tão mó bonito
The new art direction and badge system feel like a game changer for the series, i was hoping to use yoshis withought being invincible tho
Omggg Nabbid made a return!!! Im surprised but happy that hes back :)
I knew the oled was gonna be lame and red 😭 they try to pass it off with ONE Mario indent and something on the BACKPLATE
The game looks so great, but this presentation makes it feel so boring somehow. I don’t know why.
So Dunkey was right, Mario is the first Strand-type videogame ever... The online mechanics seems to have a lot of influence of Death Stranding, but with less assyncronous gameplay to it
Bowser high as a kite as that castle
Oh my god I can’t wait, I’m ACTUALLY excited for a new 2D Mario game!
I'm sold👏
0:05 Blue toad is back!!!
This looks like the most laid back mario I've ever seen, idk how to explain it but like it's a game you can relax/unwind to, not cause it's boring but the stages look so nice and the music in the video  make it seem like it'll just be a fun time
No way Rosalina isn't in this
I hope we get a game that focuses on sarassaland! We haven’t gotten an expansion on it as far as I know
This video didn't even start. I went to 29:50 and nothing happened
This is the 2d mario game we needed.
The online looks amazing lol
THERE ARE 12 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS
Toad as an elephant reminds me of the Babar cartoon
Oh my goodness, Daisy and Peach look adorable as elephants. Also, Fire Power Daisy? That’s hot (pun totally intended).
Haters will say its “forced soul” but this game looks awesome. It’s putting back the WONDER the classic games introduced with every entry
Was a bit worried at first with the same grass, desert, ocean, forest, ice, mountain, cloud, Bowser world formula but everything else just seems so fresh where I’m legit hyped for a new 2D Mario game now
Its huge... feel like mario eat super mushroom
Who’s voicing Mario
ELEPHANT PEACH NOOOOOOOOOOO
The potential for Pikmin references is extremely high 😃
seems like the modern day equivalent of super mario world. i love every second of it.  this is the first 2d mario game i'm willing to purchase, and am excited for, since super mario bros 2 3ds
While I love how you can see online players around the world, I do wish you could play online co op with 4 players, that arent shadow players. It'd be fun to interact with friends online without them being shadows.
this art style is so plasticy and i hate how everyone is facing a 3/4 angle to the camera it makes it seem less serious than the other games also i hate the flowers  i like the new power ups and wonder mechanic its mostly the art style that i dont like
This game looks amazing!
They're becoming silly!
EVEYONE SAYS WOWIE ZOWIE
The “multiplayer” seems really interesting but at the same time I cannot muster 3 other people to do offline co-op. Just wish Nintendo would recognize online mp is viable
This video doesn't play
This looks great, too bad it's stuck on ancient hardware...
This direct is a coping mechanism for the fact that Charles is gone, and also the mario movie lost to the barbie movie
I can’t believe they added the Zip Lash into this game
Wowing Zowie
So does this mean we killed the koopalings?
Please make a daisy switch controller pretty pleeeeaaasseeeee Nintendo
Anyone else find it odd that Daisy isn’t the princess of the Flower Kingdom? We still don’t know which kingdom Sarasaland is.
As cool as this looks, there's almost too much going on for me. This isn't even coming from a place of nostalgia or old age (I'm 21), but the bright colours, new abilities, new enemies, overlapping sound effects, new voicelines, new animations, it feels very overwhelming and internet-era attention grabbing. I may be in the minority here but I can't be the only one feeling this way, it seems like the game equivalent of a sugar rush.
WOW LOOKS GREAT!
Super high hopes for the next 3D Mario now. Almost hope they just made a 3D Mario Wonder
Congratulations Nintendo, you really made quite the game this time 👏
This is Better than the so called new super mario bros series (don't hate me but I haven't found any new in new smb series)
wait Smooth McGroove is on the soundtrack?
Instead of Mario eating strange hallucinogenic mushrooms, now he’ll be eating strange hallucinogenic flowers. Stick to shrooms, Mario. You don’t know what you’re getting yourself caught up in.
THIS IS the best Mario game OF ALL TIME
The talking flowers are really funny this game is like an acid trip
Someone make fanart of Mario as spider-man with the grapple vine
glad I preordered this because it looks super fun!
This game has Soooo much Stuff in it!
Someone give InfernoPlus a hug.
pls add to mario maker or ill cry
DEATH STRANDING?!
😊
This right here is what sets Nintendo apart. It's why they'll never stop being amazing.  They design and create VIDEOGAMES. They focus on finding ways to make them fun and engaging. They're not trying to make cinematic experiences, they're still in the business of GAMES.
The Hoppycats are just Squeaky Squeaks or something.....   Hey where's the Arcon Mushroom?
So glad the stagnation of the overstayed NSMB series is behind us.
They literally made kindness a competition! I’m so Excited!
Aw kinda wished the others had unique animal powers
Great looking game! Although online looks to be bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to have some original features, but I'd prefer it if the features were in addition to more standard online play, rather than replacing it.
So the wonder flower thing is basically an acid trip
This looks soooo good! I can't wait!
Something I've noticed in the trailer is that the levels don't really have a time limit. THIS IS GREAT.
The game feels like it's taking a page out of Kirby's book with some of the ways you can use the powers
Cant wait to play this. Looks like a modern indie platformer with nintendo level quality.
Been playing Mario since the 1st game realised... still going love love love it... let's  a GO!!!
really wish dk was character after seeing the end of the mario movie where he had a fire flower
perfect game to play on shrooms!
wow this game going to be day 1 for sure and it has been so many years i didnt touched any 2D mario and the idea to see other player transparency in real life but dont interact to your gameplay, that an idea that need to stay for ever 10 out of 10
Ok it's beautiful
ugh... for once can we not make bowser the villain please? we need a game where bowser saves the world and you play as him.
The world map is beautiful! It reminds me a lot of 3D World's map design, but also weirdly a bit like Mario+Rabbids, too. Super excited for a new 2D Mario, just gotta wait a couple more months!
So excited for this! Love the fresh new ideas and creativity of the team!
Cant wait!
35:47
The Yoshi’s are Journalist Mode. Lol.
bro the speedrunners are gonna go crazy with this
29:50
Day One
Man that Bowser's theme slaps
The first 30 mins were my favorite
Hopefully they allow an option to turn the talking flowers off. I feel like that might get quite annoying over time
Saying holding on hope that this is Daisy's kingdom and Tatanga tricked Bowser into becoming a castle so he can control him.
this is literally gonna be the best 2d mario game ever
Why did they have to make the peach and daisy elephant forms there skin tone. I’m going to have nightmares. Also I’m a big fan of the flower guy
This looks so fun! Mario games have akways had balanced challenge so I just thr game isnt too easy haha
is mario wonder a strand type game
Now imagine all this stuff in a new Super Mario Maker 👀
Lol didn't think I would be this excited for a 2d Mario game again in my life.
SCAMMMMM. On the oled😂
This looks really good!!
46 minute video for 16 min of direct. Just make a damn 16 min video please
Love that we’re getting a new 2d Mario game but personally I liked the old art style better
I love how 2D-Mario got Badges and “Heart Points (HP)” back before Paper Mario 😂😭 but seriously this looks phenomenal and I’m so hyped to see how the speedrunning community develops around this game!!
Man if this gets a Kaizo mod the bubble is going to become kaizo player's absolute nightmare lol
Can’t wait for the new game I’m just so happy!
Wonderful!
A banger. I'm curious if nintendo will actually stop the switch or let it live in a switch 2 Era. I'm hoping they allow smaller titles like this to always be made. Let's see what happens! Cool times ahead
I like this new game!!  😀🎮!!
This might as well be the most fun Mario game ever made!
Watch people passed a game when it comes out😂
This is one of most unique and interesting games in the 2D Mario series we’ve seen in a while. No doubt this will turn out as a great game.
NABBIT IS BACK
i have to say, if there's ever a mario maker 3 with super mario bros wonder in it, the wonder effects NEED to be added there'd be a whole bunch of levels based around it, like for instance, a whole genre of top down levels
The game looks incredible!  But please Nintendo, remember we may not want to listen to the flower helpers all the time! A setting to change them would be really nice!
This game looks absolutely amazing ❤
i can already see alpharad making a video with his friends and one of them is going to be nabbit lol
Was anyone else reminded of Crash Bandicoot 2 when Mario drilled underground?
38:33 looks like Mario wasn't watching the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
I was so hyped to play as Yoshi, but the game just doesn't feel focused around him. I don't know why they made him an "easy mode" by making Yoshis immune to damage?? And the Yoshis cant transform into elephants? Can they even use powerups at all, because the gameplay didn't show it? Love how the game's shaping up, but I find these odd Yoshi decisions to be a big disappointment so far lol
So the wonder flower is an acid trip
New mario game, new characters, and new adventures. I hope this game suprises us with all these new things!!   😀🎮!!
I can’t wait for this game to come out
Something tells me people are going to dislike the online play.
Mario IA voice?
i love all the super mario galaxy details that are in here
Oh my god. Prince Florian plushes when??
Elephant Daisy!
Please let there be a Mario Maker 3 with a Wonder theme.
Only thing i can say is just, wow...
Figured Bowser would be the antagonist, but I was NOT expecting him to just straight up be the castle. This will make for an interesting final boss.
Fantastic
29:49
OH MY GOD, SOME OF THE ENEMY GIMMICKS AND MECHANICS FOR THE NON-ELEPHANT POWERUPS OR TRANSFORMATIONS WERE FROM THE MARIO MAKER GAMES 😭😭😭  First, Drill Powerup, which takes advantage of the Spiny Helmet mechanics but adds in clear inspiration from the spin drill in Galaxy 2.  Second, we got the Bubble Flower, which is probably inspired by the wooden box thing Builder mario can do and also the Cloud flower from Galaxy 2, but they made it usable as an attack akin to the bubble yoshi!
Koopa Troopas doing a hip-bump when they run into each other is such a great detail.
I was already really excited but god damn this looks amazing
wow what a great direct that starts at 30 minutes in ;-;
DARK SOULS ESQUE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!?!?!?!?!?
I can see the memes of the elephant daisy and peach.
This looks great no doubt, but I do wish Bowser wasn't the big bad again
So no more super stars ?😢
This might rival Bowser’s Inside Story for how many “intriguing things” they packed into a Mario Game.
Mario on drugs be like
They have online, but no normal online multiplayer? Where are their priorities?
do we really need lives? Mario Odyssey tackled it beautifully, just take some coins...
Meanwhile on other platforms: "WE HAVE THE SPECS SO YOU CAN HAVE LOADS A BIT SLOWER THAN 16-BIT CARTRIDGES, AND 4K VERSIONS OF THE SAME INVISIBLE WALLS WITH 3RD PERSON/OVER THE SHOULDER VIEWPOINTS FEATURING THE COLOR GRAY!!"  Ahem.
Kinda disappointing that yoshi is the “easy mode” character. I was looking forward to playing as him but I guess not anymore.
Bruh no multiplayer online Co-Op. this game sucks
Gosh damn the mario universe just keeps growing. I cant wait to dive deep into this breathe of freah lore
oh baby
Bowser’s giving my Pigma from SF: Assault vibes
This looks really fun!
That must have been a HUGE amount of coding
oh, this voiced flower will get on the nerves so fast.
I wonder what Wyerframez will do with all the new enemies... probably nothing bad right?
This looks awesome, but I might have to play this one with the sound off.
I better be able to throw my friends into the void
Mario red editions are so nostalgic I have the red edition Wii that came with New super Mario wii
Best 2D Mario game ever? Looks incredible. This might be the first game I go through fully co-op with my 7 year old son.
If Mario becomes a Goomba, does that make him Goombario?
Although unlikely, as dlc characters please add Rosalina, Wario, WaLuigi, Captain Toad, Birdo and Pauline
Besides looking super fun, it just looks beautiful.
They should let you disable no damage mode on yoshi and nabbit. I simply want to play as yoshi normally
looks phenomenal! cant wait to play :)
38:18 so basically Mario and everyone will get high 😂
There is no way they put a grappling hook in a mario game. Game of the year
33:31  On Dune, that is a wedding proposal.
I am so excited for this gameeeee
I never expected Bowser to be the castle itself.
No the took out collision 😭. I can't throw my family off the stage no more? 😭
This actually looks great! I think this is a great evolution of 2D Mario. this feels fully fleshed out. I loved Odyssey and this seems like it will be just as creative if not more so.
Yo, this is so creative. First of nice cast of new enemies, i'm also glad to see distinctive themes in stages also. I also was surprised about the drill! The last time we saw that was Mario Galaxy 2 so seeing it in a 2D Mario game is peak! The bubble powerup honestly looks like something that could break the game in the most fun ways possible. Also Daisy again playable in a 2D side scrolling Mario game is incredible. Now I can use my main from Mario Strikers Charged. Lastly the stage design, the layouts and secrets these stages will bring, oh god. May just be the most open 2D Mario game especially with its ton of new movesets. This truly is like "New Super Mario Bros" compared to the other ones.
33:40 hype if you can play as yellow toad and blue toad as separate characters, like player 3 as yellow toad and player 4 as blue toad
For more than 30 years, they still have so many refreshing ideas, unbelievable and out of this world.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAA BLUE TOAD IS IN THE GAME LETS GO
the approach to online mode is so sick, i can't wait to buy this game
Covid 19 be=super mario bros wonder
Looks really cool, but also way too easy. The powerups/abilities were definitely designed with game journalists in mind
I actually am excited for this game
What we’ve been hearing from the new guy voicing Mario, I’m impressed 😁.
This game is like one of those dreams I had.
RED SWITCH RED SWITCH
Amazing! Great work, Nintendo!
Mi única queja o algo por el estilo es que todos los personajes de juegan igual, claro es para no tener "ventajas" Pero más que personajes jugables seran skins
I love Nintendo but man, they really need to extend their “Nintendo polish” to these because leaving almost 30 minutes of dead air of is kind of ridiculous for what it would take to fix
This is the first 2D Mario game this generation of kids get and dem they will experience a lot  from this game
This game is exactly what I've been needing out of 2D Mario for so long. I'm so ready for this.
This game looks amazing and I’ll probably spend way too much time playing it, but I can already tell I’m going to get tired of the talking flowers
shut up and take my money
This is truly a Strand-type game.
How is no one talking about online play this is actually going to be amazing I can’t wait
I'm excited to play this game as Daisy.
Whoever did the gameplay knew what they were doing, I love when that happens.
it’s joever
Nintendo nailed this direct ! Def gna get this game fr
The way the narrator says "Daisy" at 3:57 is such a throw back to mk double dash
31:14 MY BOY NABBIT!
I know some people will probably be disappointed that there isn't any interactable online co-op, I love the inclusion of hologram online multiplayer. Makes it feel less lonely when playing through a level lol. Also the race mode looks like a lot of fun. Gunna make me tap into my inner speedrunner lol. Looking forward to it.
Hypeeeeeee!
Did Smooth McGroove make the OST for this game?
I'm annoyed about Yoshi being easy mode but eh, whatever. Someone will probably make a mod that has him take damage.
WOAH THEY ARE ADDING DARKSOULS MECHANICS TO MARIO!!!!!
That was so Awesome 😎
I love how Nintendo has incorporated key features from their previous games, namely 2D, but some from their 3D games too!
This game looks amazing! I'm totally gonna play it. My only two complaints about are that I wish the plot wasn't just Bowser attacking again. He should be possessed or something. My second complaint is that elephant Peach and Daisy are bald. They otherwise look fine , but WHY ARE THEY BALD!?!?!?! Otherwise this game looks so good and I can't wait to play it!
44:38 the moment you saw on twitter.
I dont know which Millenial needs to hear this, but its time to grow up already.
It's just simply....WONDERFUL
Can you turn off the flowers? They are the only part of this game I hate. Love everything else.
Oh god the p balloon returns, this tike with princess peach :(
can't wait
Nintendo, the greatest 2D action platformer developer or all time, no company can match this. The team in Kyoto nailed once again, is so pretty.
35:07 Lockey-WHAT?!
This is almost perfect. Now all I need personally is for them to add a proper vs mode handled in the same way they did the New Super Mario Bros DS vs mode where you can choose either how many lives you lose, or how many stars you collect to win.
This game remaind me of rayman legends
I really wonder what Daisy's connection is to the Flower Kingdom. I was hoping they'd give more details.
will be in the top 10 of best mario games 🙏🏾
Oh yes wait 29 minutes for 20 minutes of content i had to waste half an hour to watch a presentation for a game I'm never going to play because an sd card fried my switches sys nand chip because the sd card was in ntfs format forever making it a $400 paper weight please understand i have been unsatisfied with your products since Christmas 2019 and since that was four years ago i am not seeing that money back i have not financially recovered fron this mishap and shipping it to a repair center will put me in more ruin and i have $100  of digital games rotting on my switch account stuff ive only played for 2 hours before my switch went dark if you expect me to buy your games i expect a way to play them and please put Hong Kong 97 on nso snes
Playable nabbit
This game looks so good all the new enemies and obstacles look so cool this is gonna be a must have for my switch collection 😊
I’m still hoping we can get September Nintendo, direct
I’m so glad they finally broke away from the new super Mario bros formula because this looks amazing
I don't know if I've ever been more excited for a Mario game! All aboard the hype train!
I'm just happy they added one of two Toads
What about the mini power up?
If I'm being critical, I wish the characters played differently or kinda like how it was in SMB2, but I guess they don't for balancing reasons? Also sad that Yoshi is basically NEW FUNKY MODE. Otherwise game looks great, and is a day one purchase for me.
Cyan Yoshi's thwomp face 😂 at 34:16 I feel like this will turn into a meme.
YES! Collectibles that aren’t star coins.
I can't be the only one that dislikes this art style. Everything just feels way too wide and too front-facing. Everything feels like it's looking at the camera/player more than anything else.
nearly 30 minutes late SMH
Looks cool, but I really don't get why easy mode has to be tied to a character. I want to play as Yoshi, but I don't want to play easy mode + when the entire game is essentially easy mode already.
32:31 frame drops lol
37:07 yeah Daisy first time using fire flower
What about the Propeller Mushroom?
omg this looks so amazing! Really found a way to bring 2D mario to the next level. I wish all the Yoshi's weren't on easy mode but that's not a huge deal just wish I could turn that off and give them the regular move set. Super excited for this though, 4 player is always fun and that Red Oled looks nice! :)
What about the Ice Flower
I just had a stroke watching elephant Mario jump
This is going to be the best 2D Mario, We Got TOADETTE, BLUE TOAD, & NABBIT IN THE GAME, & Their are other that we can do. Great Job Nintendo!👏👏👏👏
I hope there’s an option to make the other players solid instead of transparent in friend rooms, even if its just visual. Makes it feel more like they’re there.
Why have a 40 minute live if you're going to start at 30mins? 😶
NINTENDO STRAND TYPE GAME
6:10 I can't help but notice that the Bubble Flower works near exactly how it does in some Super Mario World rom hacks that I've played many years ago (right down to trapped enemies turning into coins and you being able to use the bubbles to jump much higher). Even the color of the outfit is the same, too (pink hat/shirt and red overalls). I get the feeling this isn't just some sort of coincidence, and it's honestly really cool to see Nintendo incorporating fan-made ideas into their games for a change.
How many shrooms did you take over there at Nintendo
Nobody gonna talk about how the narrator said at 35:07 💀
Crazy how they let this sit for 30 whole minutes before it started.
Wow the bubble power is so op!
Facts 🔥🔥🔥
YESS BLUE TOAD
Top tier game. Wow
I always love when a Mario game has metal guitar
Cant wait for nongamers to get filtered
This game comes out one day before my birthday 😁
I think they miss mark on online multiplayer where you can’t play like local multiplayer. So I can only play with ghost friends online and only race them?
I was WONDERing😉if this game will have online co-op and this Direct just clear out my doubts! 🤩
Super Mario Bros: Quest for Weed
With this and Sonic Superstars, 2D platforming enjoyers are gonna eat GOOD this October
Nintendo i ❤ you
This game will be one of the great Mario games
I'm not against there being easy mode characters but I really wish it was optional on who those characters would be. That really lessens the fun of playing as a Yoshi or a Rabbit to me
shouldve call it "super mario bros on drugs"
Love the drill power up.  Love the badges system.  Lots of awesome new art and visuals.  I will say I wish the graphics style was different.  It is a good balance of familiarity and newness, I just think it still looks like the “new” series too much.  If they would have pushed the realism just slightly, would have made for a much fresher look.  Over all tho, it looks like a blast.
bowser became thanos
If somehow VS mode (From NSMB DS) gets added, this could be one of the best Mario games for a while
Bing bing wahoo!
this looks so terrible
I like how they added local co op, made it work for online co op, then removed  it for online and replaced it with all the "interactive with online players instead of co op". Does Nintendo like not having actual CO op?
Smash reveal not even there?
Water is stored in the trunk.
Caco Gazapo is back baby!
GYAAATTTT
I love Nabbit🥰🥰🥰
RIP to the New Super Mario Bros series. 2006-2019.
This looks absolutely fantastic. I cannot wait
This is shaping up to be the best 2D Mario of all time🥲 And my god that art style! Promotion for whoever is art director(s) for this game. Not just beautiful but reminiscent of 90s Mario. I literally screamed when Yoshi showed up with that slender, old-school look. Fifty thumbs-up from me, Nintendo.
Yup. DA’s eatin’ good tonight
Good indie game
WHY ARE THE PEACH AND DAISY ELEPHANTS FLESH COLORED BUT THE REST ARE GREY
Looks dope
Don’t get me wrong, I love that we get to play as Peach AND Daisy. But I would’ve loved to see them get new clothes to match the Bros. They’re gonna get hats for that falling section, why not make that their new “adventure outfits.”  I mean just imagine how cute they’d look with those hats and overall style skirts. It’s a missed opportunity now that they’re playable.
This game is honestly like if New Super Mario Bros. U and Super Mario 3D World had a baby
Looks like one of the best 2D Mario games we've ever had but I have to ask why do all 5 of the main characters play the same? I liked that Luigi had the high jump while feeling like he's on ice, toad's tiny jump and fast speed, and peaches floating jump. I was hoping Daisy would have unique weaknesses and benefits too. Why would they make everyone play the same?
CHAOS!
The game looks fantastic! However, this narrator makes it sound like the game is for toddlers...
I fear no man, but that thing... *elephant toad* it scares me ...
39:53 Super Mario Bros 2
The koopas bumping each other when they collide is great
Looks good, not better than any new super Mario bros game tho
41:52 bro we freaking won, September - December really is peak gaming for 2023 this year bout to end amazingly for the gaming community
They legit made Mario a strand type game.
Where are wario and waluigi
Why don't they get this creative with the Paper Mario series?
Let's gooo
can we disable the flowers from talking?
Ngl i kinda wanted yoshi to have an elephant form😭
I want to play this game!
hope it can run at least 60fps on a switch! tired of porting all my roms to emulators
TOADETTE IS PLAYABLE LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I am excited for the new Super Mario Bros game (no pun intended), the art style is a decent change and the powerups look fun. Plus it's rare that we get to play the princesses. Too bad Yoshis are dumped down to being ez mode characters tho, for that we at least can team up with folks who use these locally.
Oh god, I wonder how the princesses will look like in some of these forms...
35:55 what have they done?
Some of the music sounds like Yoshi's Woolly World and also...Pajama Party from Rhythm Heaven.
I've been a super Mario Bros fans since the 80s...I don't think I will be playing this game... especially with some fat elephant Mario or any other character.
Gotta appreciate the live chat how when this clip played 3:33, everyone just started saying “AYO???? 💀💀”
this is gonna be so awesome, i almost cried just cuz im so happy to be here for the first fully new 2d mario in a while
Preordering
BEST MARIO GAME EVEEEEEEEEEEEERR
The online part actually looks cool.
This is amazing, really. It looks fun & fresh, with so much gameplay possibilities, and the art direction is gorgeous. I always loved the Super Mario Bros games since my childhood, i can't wait to play this new one during autumn and winter with a blanket and a hot chocolate!
29:50
Where is the new Super Mario Amiibo?
This finally seems to address everything complaint of the NSMB series. Kudos to Nintendo for finally making 2D Mario engaging and inventive again. This feels like the same excitement going from mario 3 to SMW
Is... is that Smooth McGroove doing the map music? that's what it sounds like
Bowser turned himself into a castle, funniest sh*t I've ever seen
Oh man the red switch version now I really want that.
Why would you hide Mario on the back of the dock?!
I wasn’t sure if I’d be getting this one but this convinced me. That Yoshi buff makes this game so much easier to play with my kids and I’m all for it. And being able to save their ghost. Absolute win.
Mario Wonder looks amazing! can't wait to get it
If you show this to someone playing Mario in mid-80s, you'll definitely blow their mind.
Nintendo introduced the real game of the year!
Day 1 buy
... but can we play co-op with our friends online?  It wasnt clear on that.
I hope you can turn off the annoying flower voices.
A mix of all 2d mario games and mario 3d world and 3d land = addictive
40:20
Genius 😍
This looks actually REALLY good! Except for the Yoshi riding a Yoshi thing? that seems unholy to me XD
40:36
I can see this being a fun speedgame! I can already tell that the bubble powerup, and some of the badges will be absolutely broken lol
Again, mario takes the wrong mushrooms: the game
bruh said lockey-toos
Is rosalina making an appearance as playable character?
Oh dios mio you put the balloon effect and peach (and daisy) in the same game the deviantArt is real 💀💀💀💀💀
Online seems like a waste of space, but everything else looks amazing. I wish you could connect online for co-op, ah Nintendo doing great dumb amazing things
I WONDER what drugs Nintendo was on to make this game. This is going to be interesting.
40:45
I love the new enemies, they all have unique mechanics and they are really expressive.
Too bad Rosalina is not a playable character but she was only in 3D Mario games 2nd of all super Mario bros wonder is better than new super Mario bros wii 3rd of all Nintendo finally looked at the deviantart of the princesses are balloons and last of all I am buying this game then I’ll buy sonic superstars
THIS IS GOING TO BE SO SICK!!
Grappling hook hype
Classic Nintendo and their extremely smooth and polished games
Is it a new mario voice actor? Or is it still the one that just left?
i am fairly confident i'm going to buy this game when it's released. Also you mean to tell me that bowser IS the freaking castle!?
Cannot WAIT to hear the underground theme remixed for the 80th time.  Jokes aside, I'm excited for the music in the OST to be an absolute bop.
Excited to see how they plan on combating everyone spamming standees all over every square inch of levels haha
Nintendo never fails to amaze me.
My entire life I’ve said “I’m not really a 2D Mario platformer fan”. Im realizing now it’s because I’ve only been given New Super Mario Bros 100 times over. So excited for this!
They brought so much to the table this time LETS GOO!!!
This game wil be amazing 😆
Why you can't play online in the same ways you can play in local. Such a bad decision
kinda dissapointed with the online functionality. Especially now that we have ridable yoshis as players, it feels like a missed opportunity
A Mario game with a grappling hook. Dunkey will go crazy
Bowser: I AM THE CASTLE NOW
Nice I think I will get that game upcoming season which is in Christmas.
But the real question is: who's voicing Mario if Charles Martinet is not doing this? :(
Wow… I was NOT expecting this AT ALL   IM EXCITED
I’m glad there is online “co-op” so you can play with friends
Whoever said that all the other characters turned into different animals, were lying 🤥
You can play as a GOOMBA in Super Mario Bros. Wonder!!1!1!
Ok, I'll give it a chance, but I still think those flowers are gonna be annoying, still a little funny sometimes.
I hope we still can throw people in lava like others opus
YES 🎉
Super Mario Bros 3 is still the best Mario game ever. Fight me.
I hope Blooper and Side Stepper are in this.
This looks awesome! A big step up from the new super mario games. I love the new features and mechanics they've added. Can't wait to play this soon!
Why is there 30min of nothing?💀
Okay Nintendo, but where is Metroid Prime 4? Hopefully not stuck in that fat elephant pipe!
I'm so disappointed that Yoshi isn't treated as a normal character. I'd love to play as him but I don't wanna be put on easy mode because of it. Besides that, the game looks amazing
Can you only play online with ghosts???
Daisy has new voice lines I think. Neat!
Awesome
They pronounced lakitu in a way i have NEVER heard before
IS VERY GREAT GAME CONTENT WE GOT HERE!!!!!
44:40 E L E F A N T
Sometimes I think Deviant art is part of Nintendo
The badge system sounds neat!
I’m also thinking about how amazing the hacks of this game will be.
where’s wario and waluigi donkey kong Rosalina more animals power ups
Why is there 30 minutes of literally nothing?
I'll admit, I was really not a fan of what I saw in the first appearance of Wonder back in the previous direct, but now, even though the game seems very gimmicky, it does look like it has genuinely solid gameplay on top of that.
What time will it be in News on the Nintendo Switch? Around 5:30 does it appear or later tonight? I want to be able to make a reaction video to it :)
The online function seems so smart. It's like non intrusive co-op. Or a helpful assist. Really cool
Not you guys getting upset about the actual Direct only being 15 minutes 😂 Their streams always have a half hour wait time and they specifically said 15 minutes anyways
The first 30 mins was my favorite part. I'm really glad they included that. It was breathtaking!
2 things. 1. Everyone’s an elephant. 2. Mainline has badges, but not Paper Mario
Nintendo just doesn't run out of fun ideas 💀
I watched this video three times now, I just love it so much
Imagine calling yourself a gamer, and not being a Nintendo fan.
The trailer actually begins at 29:50 if anybody is wondering, hope I'm helpful! 😊
Me witnessing badges for the first time:  Upgrades, people! UPGRADES!
I thought the campaign of Mario Maker 2 was the best 2D Mario game since the SNES era which has everything to do with difficulty and satisfying mechanics. I'm so excited for WONDER and I'm hoping it won't be plagued with the recent 2D Mario problem of being more casual than challenging.
33:00 Based of this frame, it looks like World 1 will have 14/15 levels (Not sure if the castle is one or not). Also looking at the title at the top, it appears there may be an 8th world.
WE ARE SO BACK!
Grappling hook!
This looks so fun. I do hope/wish we can activate a setting where Yoshi can receive damage too. I would like to play with Yoshi without feeling almost invincible :/
35:00 Langoliers!
MARIO FANS ARE EATING RIGHT NOW!!!
This is honestly an amazing step in the right direction to making 2D mario better. It adds so much replay ability to a game which you may play once every one to two years
THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AWESOME
PEAK MARIO
So all those online features with friends but no actual online co-op, only local.😢
I wasnt sure about this game at first but now I'm excited to play it
This looks like the next true creative jump in the series since Super Mario World.
Can't wait to challenge run the entire game invisibly xD
i will miss the old series but i think this will be better than nsmb besides the ds one lol
yoo mario maker 3 is gonna be wild with this style
Speed Running for this game is gonna go crazy in my opinion
Get ready for all the incoming furry pron for the characters in elephant form.
They made the “ghost” thing because they don’t know how to make a good and stable connection game, sad about this. Still looks like a fun game.
This game gonna be interesting and could possibly take 2D Mario  to the next level with all those new power ups, enemies, secrets and multiplayer modes.
I Loved It! 👍
What if I put sum wonder flower in the blunt? 😳😳
Never been so hyped for a 2D Mario.
I really like the badge system!
..... another year without Wart. 😢  🐸👑
Omg. Blue toad is here
Mario and Sonic fans are eating GOOD
Cool game, but those fps drops are nasty stuff man.
I screamed when Yoshi hopped on another Yoshi!
The secret potential with that bubble power up is amazing.
This will make the next mario maker levels pretty interesting with the new powerups
This is the mario game ever
Nintendo just shut up and take my MONEY
A little disappointed Rosalina didn’t make it in…  Y’all did her dirty including all the other Mario characters.
Finally after years we finally get online play
I wonder what goombas taste like…..excuse me what?!
There is nothing you could say that would make me think that the developers weren’t on an acid trip when they were making the Wonder Flower.
Haters be like: Duh Wonder Flower iz jus an event flag!
Bruh it’s perfect well almost, it seems I won’t be able to pick up my friends and throw them down pitfalls 😭
With the jet run the fact you can run in the air for a few seconds looks like a minor glitch they made into a feature
29:50 is when it actually starts.
nintendo take my money
33:38 I'm Highly dissapointed that ya'll did Red Toad wrong and left him out. 4 Yoshi's and 3 Toads don't sit right with me.
Sometimes the narrator sounds legitimately confused
.
elephant peach 💀
I am DEF getting this game when it comes out omg it looks so good !!
I like that toadette is playable. This game looks so fun. Especially the online part.
Hope koopalings are in
L is Real
Did SmoothMcGroove make this soundtrack?
This tiny Italian plumber has been a part of my life before I even hit the double digits. I remember it like it was yesterday. Coming back from church finally being able to open up the presents under the tree. There was a big box saved for last, in it my first console, the Nintendo Wii. The hours I spent with this console were plentiful but nothing compares to when I booted up the game and heard the squad scream                 MARIO KART WII !!! WAHOO ! Thank you Mario Jumpman Mario and for the time we spent together. ❤
Daisy said "Wowie-Zowie!" And that's what we came for.
This game looks really good, but I have a couple gripes... "You can see and even lightly interact with other players while online!" Okay, that's cool... But at that point, why not just make an online co-op mode?  Also, why do they keep launching special edition switches WITHOUT the game included??? What's so special about a glorified color-swap?
Man, Sonic Super Stars and Super Mario Bros wonder are like the rebirth of old platformers
I love the new souls-like-like (lol) style of indirect online co-op!
I was skeptical about this game but, of course Nintendo never fails on surprising and innovating. The badges dynamic and the online stuff really catch my attention. Also Yoshi having a neck once again like the old desing, 10/10. Also it seems that the excess of things/effects happening simultaneusly was a bit reduced so, if this is true its a really good decition, another 10/10.  Looking forwards to this one.
jeez edit the damn video at least. 29:50
This is a game where I refuse to play by myself, I’m gonna invite my cousin over to enjoy this game with me because it looks amazing!!!
8:59 Oh My God. I F**KING CALLED IT!!!
This is so cool ngl
So Bowser IS the castle now lmao
This will be this generation’s Super Mario World. DEFINITELY getting this.
So only question is why no red toad if there can be a red yoshi??
GROOVE METAL IN MARIO?????????????????????
41:45 oh my gosh, poor Yoshi lol.
Bro why would I ever take a wonder seed. The flower looks like so much fun
I hope we fight bowser as a mech and not him as a flower pot :/
This game looks awesome
Time to round up some friends for this!
Hopefully online play won’t be as laggy as Mario maker 2
The vine badge’s abilities looks so cool omg😭😂
This looks absolutly amazing, a nintendo masterclass game for sure, i love it already!
HYPEEE
30:29 mairo 64, bowser leimotif
Like that Blue Toad aka Buckenbarry is back
Looks amazing !
RIP nsmb you will be missed maybe
Ok, this game has a LOT of content, so good Nintendo!
looks nice, hopefully its about as big as a big 3d mario game.
Game looks great though I wish there some sort of battle mode or pvp mode
No coins?
Originally I wasn't excited about wonder, after this I am though.
Creativity returns to 2D scroller Mario!
.
Everything about this looks fantastic however I would’ve liked to see Online. Multiplayer be like Local Multiplayer. Not a bunch of transparent characters that you can’t really interact with
What have you done Nintendo? What have you done? Furries? Inflation? What have you done Nintendo WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!
this is awesome
Elephant peach got me acting frisky
All I care about is the fact that blue toad is back LET’S GO!  Also y’all know what little siblings are going to do when they realize there’s a speed badge.
The koopa troopas bumping their shells is a nice touch
This game has soulslike online and that shatters my entire world view
Bro some of stuff I saw brought so much nostalgia to me like balloon Mario is back HE IS BACK
Something about yoshis face doesn’t sit right lol
The varied gameplay and the really neat live player mode seems like amazing direction for Mario’s franchise - I cannot wait to get this day one 😊❤
Should have called it New Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
wow
ويجيك ضفدع يقول العاب ماريو تتشابه......اخوكم من الجزائر
This is game look amazing I can’t wait to play this masterpiece. Although i wish u could take damaged with Yoshi & use power-ups it would’ve been cool
The second you give me a drill power up I’m all in.
Mario Maker 3 is going to be incredible
It's a shame they didn't incorporate Charles Martinet into this, with his new role as Mario Ambassador and not being the voice of Mario in this game.
This game looks so full of life and charm. It's nice to see all the playable characters and while Yoshi and Nabbit (who I guess is just a 2D Mario staple now along with Toadette, no complaints there) have special attributes the badges do sort of remedy this in my opinion. Can't wait to play this actually *New* Super Mario Bros. experience.
Looks terrible.
Looks incredibly easy... But it will be cool to play with my daughters. I'm open to being surprised with it being better than I expect... That being said, I expect them to love it and that will make it an instant classic for me. I'm sure SMW probably looked like this to someone who was a Sm 1 or 3 purist back in the day...
Peach and Daisy looks very tiny.
Woah they really revealed a lot... which makes me things there is way more to discover...
GOOOOOOOAT
From the looks of it, I'd say that Peach and Toadette will become...  Pink Elephants on Parade!
I dont know about you, but im making a yoshi stack of 4 yoshis.
Just imagine they made a Super Mario Maker 3 and added this to the styles. That would be so interesting to see!
I feel that it is a combination between mario world and kirby returns to dreamland
so THAT'S where the ESRB got its stupid "in-game purchases" thing from
That bowser theme goes hard 🔥🔥
I called all of this I’m too good at predicting
the only problem i have is the online room feature. now if theres only 2-4 players in the room it wont be the same as local co-op.
I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely do not need it, I don't need it, I don't need it...            I NEED IT
It's so refreshing to see so many new enemies! This made me realize they were a bit lacking in that department in recent games. They look so cool and unique!  That aside, everything else looks incredible! Genuinely cant wait to play this! The scale and creativity of this brings me back to playing Super Mario World, which I still feel is the best 2D Mario game ever. But this game just may finally change that opinion for me! Super hyped!
I didn't expect to see Nabbit
This might be the BEST Super Mario Bros game EVER. Maybe as well as the BEST Mario game they have ever done.
yoshi not taking damage is disappointing, why can’t it just be a option to turn on and off damage and make all characters the same. Will not be buying for this reason tbh they ruined it again
This looks amazing!! Really looking forward to this game! :D
Seems like Nintendo is RESETTING the average age of its target audience. This is definitely for kids who continue to (or grew up with) mobile gaming standards 😕
Elephant Peach is a bit chubby. Maybe she should get some exercise tips from Queen Celeste
Essentially this is New Super Mario Bros. 3
SAYLESS
Guinness world record going be busy with this game.......so many firsts that will happen for this game.
Game: *Has Daisy as a playable character*  Chuggaconroy and Pringus Mcdingus: *Malicious laughter*
Personally, I only have one complaint. WHERE IS ROSALINA
WOW dark souls style online!
Looks brill, however no online coop is a huuuge omission!
They just be  releasing the same game since ds
Badges in a 2D Mario Platformer?? It’s official Paper Mario fans.. they are absolutely DONE with OG paper mario games
This game will hit us different. I was expecting for a "really" new super mario for a long time.
Mario needs to “man of steel” bowser or this is going to keep happening….
The shows elefante Peach. Oh god
Yall will get hyped for anything.
Yoshis as easy mode seems like such a good idea! No more having to bubble as someone does the hard part of the level, just hop on and help them get across that way!
This is literally the Mario world of this generation probably even better
they knew what they were doing with the wonder flower... "Super Drug Bros" for real
A new 2D Mario game bursting with creativity? I thought I’d never see the day.
Often big budget mario games tend to seem a little corporate for lack of a better term, but this feels like people executing their vision perfectly with no interference. So excited for this!!
anyone else feel disappointed at the announcer mispronouncing Lakitus' name?
Man the challenges on this game bout to get wild
I guess the mushrooms finally came to him 🍄
No actual online co-op?
Missed the opportunity to make Wario a playable character Nintendo lol
I feel like Sonic-Superstars and Super Mario Bros. Wonder is competitng with eachother. Both classic 2d style games with loads of abilitys, movesets, and customization. I am honestly excited for both.
They made so many improvements over the old series. Brilliant!
Man, I'm getting a lot of Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair vibes from the badge system. Still, this looks very, very good! Looking forward to it!
36:19 is my favorite quote
why would you post a 46 minute video, and the first 30 minutes are nothing?
I think this will be one if not the best Mario ever created ❤
Lmao I can't wait for full invisible runs
Why is there almost 30 minutes of dead air here?
Mario Schizo
THE ONLINE YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
ok
this has been a hype day a Mario wonder direct and for my splatoon homies drizzle season comes out on the same day
Games journalists will be playing with Yoshi I see.
This game is the definition of CRAZY 🤪 😜 💯🙏😎
Looks good for a 2D mario
I wish we could play yoshi without it being an easy mode
I'm just super glad Yoshi and Daisy are finally playable in a game like this
As interesting as this looks, the elephant is gonna get annoying fast If they all say that stupid phrase every time
I still can't believe that Twitter post made many people believe there wouldn't be an Elephant version of Peach and Daisy. How foolish they must felt now.
Finaly a Mário game that doesn't turn bowser into a complete unsufurable misarable simp, what a breath of fresh Air that IS my friends.
Where is Mario maker 3😢
Can we have a green luigi model switch please? 💚
LETS A GO!
1:28 this is probably the title theme and it makes me cry :')
The talking flower went from being concerned that the Goomba was blown away by Mario to wondering how they taste like
I like the Mario Galaxy reference with the Drill power up
Drill Mario gives me memories of Super Mario Galaxy 2
29:49
W
Only a few minutes of game play footage and I already need this. We're eating good for gaming at the end of this year.
Same old tired garbage. The last great 2D Mario game was in 1990.
This is some AWESOME multiplayer! I wasn't going to buy the game, but after seeing the ghosts system?? That is SO COOL! $60 has been set aside :D
Think this will be good but I like superstars more just my opinion
Missed opportunity by not giving Princess DaisY a ponytail like Peach in her Fire flower form.
This is gonna great! I'm excited!
Holy F^ck! This looks amazing!
I'm so looking forward to this game! While I do wish all characters had their own unique traits along with the Ice Flower being present, I can not deny this game looks already amazing! With all the expressions all characters give off along with the ghost online features, badges, power ups, and the roster, I can not wait to play this game!!!
I can’t wait to play this game!
Flower Kingdom... Anything to NOT use Sarasaland again eh?
Good Work Nintendo.
This is, I believe, the most polished game I have ever seen. The amount of tiny details in every corner is absolutely insane.
Looks great!! Excited to get it.
Why is it 30 min of nothing first? Nintendo can’t afford editors?
Looks perfect! Just sad that Yoshi is the easy mode. I wish I could play with them normally.
Wow, I can't wait to play "The Super Mario Bros. Wonder Game" on my "The Nintendo Switch: O-L-E-D Model: Mario Red Edition System" this October 20th!
Im officially excited for this game!! Can not wait to play a fresh 2D Mario, Its only been like 15 years lol. Really interesting to see Paper Mario like badges, and Im happy to see online. I really like the idea behind the online also, I think that will be super fun!!!
Kinda hate that Yoshi is playable. Also rule34 is gonna have a trip with Peach and Daisy here with elephant.
This game was made for achievemets/trophies. I hope Nintendo adds some sort of system in the future. Please Nintendo! I need proof I beat this whole game while invisible!
This looks great! I love the online mode where player shadows can help you, also badges add so much potential
41:44 the answer is solved
I really like yoshi so it kinda sucks that he's an easy mode character, but being able to carry others on your back like kirby is cool, I might play him in multiplayer
Looks incredibly inventive, I just hope the talking flower isn't too intrusive
I haven't seen a 2D Mario this fresh in 20 years...
Bowser castle form reminds me of koffing
Satoru Iwata would be so proud to be seeing this game for a new generation of gamers
Mario has style again
6:11  I was expecting a bubble power up in a future game. Called it!
Looks cool, but i really despise 2d mario, kirby, metroid, hollow and shovel knights all destroy this series
Almost above half of the direct is just a screen lol
Best new Mario game!
It seems like these courses are based off of ideas that people came up with in Mario Maker such as carrying items and using them throughout the level
The fact that half this video is a png shows how lazy Nintendo is
I think Mario had a little too many mushrooms😅
This makes me more angry about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
YOU CAN BE A GOOMBAS
Dam! Even mario has better online world play than pokemon
Valskibum is gonna have a FEILD DAY
Give us Wario and Waluigi!!!
Woah woah woah, *12* player Super Mario Bros? What are you gonna do with all those slots?  43:57
There is a lot more to this game than I initially thought. The amount of power ups seemed lacking until I saw the amount of wonder effects and badges that basically act as power ups.  This is definitely not just another "new super mario bros " game.
They turned Mario into Death Stranding 😭😭
This looks stellar!
41:59 ghost mode is back!
An ELEPHANT riding Yoshi?!  Man, as if doing the flutter jump isn't hard enough for Yoshi, now he's got a 200 pound animal on his back! 🤣
30:20 so..  Bowser became the pizza tower huh?
The only thing I don't like is Mario's animations being heavily based off of Mario 3, specifically his fast run and jump. I personally never liked that mechanic nor that I like the game
3:34 “I wonder what Goombas taste like…” 😂😂😂
35:55 NOOOOOOOO!!!!
THE ONLINE STUFF IS SO COOL OMG
It looks like an ICP special edition console 😂
damn bro nintendo added dark souls mode to mario
NO ELEPHANT PEACH AND DAISY 😭
Atleast they should have changed the villain.. it’s boring bowser again and again..
Goku flower???
visuals and gameplay looks great! just hoping this game isn't too easy
this feels like 3d world but 2d, 2d world if you will
The speedrun meta for this game is going to be insane.
i love how the talking flowers are voiced by the same guy who did the voiceover, so at first i thought he was simply saying what the flowers were saying for fun but no, guess they have voices and for once a mario game has real audible lines of text!
Blue toad is saved! Glad he's still sticking around
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF COOOOOWS MAKE THIS GAME ONLINE MILTIPLAYER, MONEY PRINTER
So it's a modern-day mario game using the classic formula. I didn't realize how much i wanted that before seeing this direct
It's pretty obvious but the art direction in this game is beautiful
I was excited for this game before this direct, but now this is one of my most anticipated games of the year
Looks great overall, but why does it have to tell me 'good' when I stomp on a goomba? I don't think the extra indicator is necessary.
Looks fun, however you can tell that Mario 3 and Mario World was their peak
The badges need to appear in future games, and in 3d games
Game looks great I'm picking it up day 1 but why did they make yoshi the easy mode!
This online multiplayer makes it the next strand-type game
Crazy that they're actually using ideas fans came up with a while ago but then also making them even better. Things like bubble and drill existed in hacks for a long time
Things just won't be the same without Mario's voice actor. I've played a few Mario games when I was growing up and the actor for Mario never failed to deliver. I don't know what we'll do without him. It feels like the Mario games will not be the same without him
i love this
Yoshi is not going to have a fun time with carrying elephants for sure
Did we really need a direct in a mario game? It can't be thst different   Even in a kingdom and a game trying to do something new ita still just "bowser steals castle"...wish nintendo understood the importance of storytelling  Also first world just looks like mushroom kingdom. 1-1. Hope it's different  Plus nintendonand the mario gentrification again not allowing original characters. "One of two toads"  and "one of 4 yoshis" is lazy.
Am I the only person who noticed that the yellow yoshi was the exact same sprite in Mario party 9 ?
I haven’t realized how much I missed 2D mario
Unfortunate that there’s no real online play, but I’m still very excited for this. Will probably be a day one buy
this  day  is  bananas  B.A.N.A.N.A.S.
NABBIT RETURNED
This is gonna be someone’s childhood game
The Drill power-ups remind me from Mario & Luigi game franchise
i love bubble powwer up
I'm Excited for Super Mario Bros. 4: Wonder  Also Can the Super leaf with just ears and tails, Ice Flower, Cape Feather, Hammer Suit, and Super Bell Please & Thank you
I quite easily see that this will be one of the best Mario games.
Just the use of the word "spelunk" alone in this direct makes me want this game
Take my money Nintendo!
This game had more life and effort in it than the past few titles in the  new super mario bros series
Why is there 30 minutes of empty space?
Very excited about this one! Loving all the course, background, & character designs!! The New gameplay features look so fun! I have some skepticism about the "Live Play Shadows" and how Nintendo Online can handle that (when I DC all the time in Splatoon), so we will just have to see! It looks super neat tho!
Knowing what the Internet will do next, I think it was a mistake to not make the Elephant a Mario Only Power Up.
This looks like the best 2D mario since...Super Mario World? Is it safe to call this Super Mario 5 ?!
I can’t believe this is the second strand type game
The game is coming out sooner than I thought. I thought it wasn't going to happen until November
42:42 the only thing I didn't like was the Standees surprises. These cassino/gacha mechanics are just wrong and have nothing to to with Mario Universe. Just let me buy the Standees I want. This could open dangerous doors for microtransactions in the future, which is not nice.
1001 games you must play before it’s game over for you. One entry: Super Mario Bros. Wonder
Please include an in game volume slider. The prior entry on Switch doesn't have one and it makes it very loud on my setup
Standees? Hearts? Is this the next Strand-type game!?
The new enemies are ADORABLE
reat!
Kinda disappointed about the lack of returning power-ups (one of the good things about the New Super games), but otherwise, this is a perfect 10! Really excited to play this game!
Hey Nintendo I have something to ask of you, could you please talk to Gamefreak about making a Pokemon black and white remake? I really enjoyed those games. Thanks :)
bruh at 36:18 they say baddies💀
yooo bowser is now mr. electric LOL (game looks amazing, can't wait!)
BLUE TOAD!
So much new stuff!  Looks the folks at Nintendo went all in for this new SMB!    It could very well be the best entry yet!  Extremely creative.  The backgrounds are very impressive too.
Everyone laughed when Kojima said he was making a strand-type genre, and now Nintendo has put strand-type elements in a full-out Mario game. Good job, Kojima.
I was iffy on Mario’s new look but I think they improved it since the trailer. Or I just got used tonit
Please please please have Mario Wonder style in Mario maker 3
They've made a sidescrolling MMO.
Cybergoth Bowser Jr. is not what I was expecting but you know what I dig it.
I fear the horrors of what nsfw artists have planned
This game looks so cute! I love the poplins and the little prince guy!
Alright, anyone else PAINFULLY aware that this game was made to be upscaled to 3D? Looking at the scenes at the beginning with the Bowser castle floating around, it really has some POP if you know what I mean. I noticed it instantly. I am willing to bet the next Switch edition has 3D capabilities. Obviously I mean 3D as in the 3DS
The flower will be the twist villain
I just left my job and moved out to the forest. Glad I did – now I will be able to play this non-stop! 😆 Thank you, Nintendo!
29:50
This is a huge turn from the NSMB games and am liking it
I wish we could get Charles Martinet DLC. Maybe a hack by the community at least...
Maybe they should ditch the AI sounding guy and hire an actual people to narrate this, it is not impressing and actually annoying.
"I wonder what Goombas taste like" Uhh... what?
After Super Mario Maker I thought no other 2D Mario game was going to surprise me. But here I am
The badges are gonna provide so much depth to the speed running scene
lol classic Nintendo can’t make a normal online co-op everyone wants
its like they were inspired by bubble bobble.  i love it
The flowers talking sounds awful😅
...thank you for watching our direct"? Huge thank to the team. They have worked hard to bring this game together. Great to hear we do not need to wait so much.  The new expression of Yoshi while he holds an enemy is looking too goofy imo.  Thank you!
I feel like this direct spoiled the entire game, lol... does a side scroller really need a whole direct?
I “Wonder” why my brain hurts after watching this :/
Honestly, the online is probably the best in any mainline Mario game. The only thing I’d change is that in private lobby’s characters shouldn’t be shadows.
The perfect mix of Mario and Mega Man
elephant peach, oh no
Stopped a little just to ask, is it Smooth McGroove ba ba ba ba'ing and whistling on the soundtrack? That's why he is away for so long?
So you consume a flower and start hallucinating...
At long last nintendo embracing online play! This will make it replayable , unlike an one time game and that’s it.
Elephant peach 🫦
Can’t wait to play Tengen Koopa Gurren Lagann
This will be the best mario game as of late
YOOOOOOO I PREDICTED THE BUBBLE FLOWER, LETS GOOOOOOOO!
It looks amazing but unfortunately I grew tired of Mario, to me it always been the same game with more power ups, but I hope this new Mario game break records
They done made Mario death stranding
Switch is already the third best selling console(129 million) behind the DS(154 million) and PS2(155million). That's insane.
This game looks amazing, I look forward to playing it online!
Probably gonna be too easy.
Nintendo is unreal at creating new features and mechanics that both could make the game more accessible to new players and more fun for returning players. This looks so good.
Daisy helping Toadette after she almost fell over was adorable
WAIT N!?!?!? HOW DID YOU  JOIN NINTENDO AGAIN 1st RING FIT ADVANTURE AND NOW SUPER MARIO BROS WONDER!?!?!?
32:36 FIRE BOOPKINS!
I admit, I was skeptical when I saw the first trailer but this? THIS made me completely change my mind on it and now I will surely purchase this to play together with my father or my mom, so that they can play as Yoshi and never die and get carried by me. The important is playing together
I love surrealism, so this game is right up my alley. So hyped!!
This really looks magnificent. Dare I say….wonderful?
The characters all angled diagonally still looks very odd. I don't get why they needed to be as that wasn't the case in any past 2d mario game, and it also makes the rolling ball power-up's roll animation look very awkward.
Petey would've been the perfect antagonist tbh
The one miss is the lack of player collision, I only want chaos
Is the video not playing or is it just me
Ah, the strand genre expands.
So there won't be Rosalina here... :C
I hope there will a Demo soon
But still no wario
34:41 😂😂
GRAPPLE BADGE LOOKS SICK
Where am I ? 😔
This is amazing!
I can’t believe Mario just ripped off SpongeBob with this bubble blowing
Best Mario Game Ever
I don't know why, but unconventional multiplayer mechanics like these are always interesting to see and try. Can't wait for this game!
I don't even really like mario games and this looks fun
Leave it to Nintendo to revive 2D Mario yet again! This looks like a ton of fun. The online play and race modes look like people will be doing that a lot! This brings me back to the fun and hype around the Super Mario 3 heydays.
Nah Nintendo, allow actual player interaction. Best thing about these games was being able to throw each other off, this created long lasting friendships and even strengthened them...
I love how they look like Modern versions of the N64 cover art characters.
the online features man. i can't wait to see other people doing levels with me and being able to help them. so many playable characters too, i can't wait for this game. perfect direct
Everything is awesome EXCEPT for the online co-op. Now I can’t throw my friends into pits unless there next to me😭
5:23 I like this part
Looks amazing can’t wait ❤
Is that smooth mcgroove singing around 32:40?
This is the mario game of all time
Yoshi riding Yoshi this game is wild.
I will personally BUY a Switch just to play this, I need this game RIGHT NOW!!!!
Elephant peach
Also badges!
Hum, it's cute, I guess🤔
I hope the online actually works, if they do manage to nail it could be something fun.
The flower kingdom gives me hope It gives me hope that they're actually expanding the lore,that we might be able to go back to the bean bean kingdom
Poor Yoshi, riding it as a elephant
Awesome seeing Death Stranding community mechanics in this game.
Mario wonder switch oled pleaaw
the map menu reminds me of 3d world, can’t wait to play this (also the toad elephant looks so funny)
“I turned myself into a castle, Mario! I’m Castle Bowser!”  In all seriousness though, this game looks AMAZING and I can’t wait for release day.
Damn , we’re eating good in October fellas!!
I really hope you can change the voice acting language like in breath of the wild because i like the Japanese flowers way more
Mario wonder switch oled edition
nailed it
This game looks absolutely amazing! Nintendo's sure going all in on this project. Wonder looks like it could be the most ambitious and creative 2D Mario game yet! I can't wait to play it come October 20th 🥰
This looks so creative and fun. Definitely gonna up there with 3d world as one of my favorites.
The animation is top notch, super excited for this ❤
The Switch is going out with a bang.
Nothing kills a nintendo presentation like talking about the online features
Looks nice will be cool that kids can play and not just die they can actually try to have some fun especially if they're really young I'm talking to you about the easy level.  You can die if you fall but not if you run into an enemy.  Kind of a double-edged sword is that going to teach the kid just to run through an enemy?  I guess the question is how will you teach your kid?
okay the ghost player, where you can see other people playing at the same time as you, is literally the coolest idea they’ve had with a mario game.. there will be no isolation with this one
World data at 31:30!!! Thanks nintendo
this is going to be that weekend mornings under the blanket type of game. Super inviting, and it looks crisp animation wise.   I'm actually excited for a Mario game. Usually, it's just a series that's..There for me but this looks genuinely intriguing.
wow 2nd time bowser has use powerup in a main mario video game.
Compra día 1!
Ok, im buying this game! Its wonderful! I hope they will add Scorpion enemies for the Desert course
Mario is taking his crown back now
My only concern is the courses are gonna be like a minute long
That new mario switch is the most unoriginal one they've made.
Nintendo i BEG of you to make a level editor. I dont even care if  its paid dlc. there are so many elements that can be used to make amazing levels, like the badges. you could make the badges selectable from the editor's choice or force it on a player
Come on Nintendo, that Oled, what were you thinking! That's just plain lazy. 🙄
I feel like this game is gonna be painfully easy
Damn, thats the most creative mario game ive witnessed...
That mouthful yoshi is something
Amazing. This looks like the best Mario game ever made.
The entire career of the "New" series was put to shame with this video alone. This game just looks phenomenal, and what Mario fans actually deserve.
I want this game even more now!
Im hearing Smooth Mcgrove ?
How to make mario wondur a good game  1 remove everyone but lugi 2 give him vacuum 3make him sux
next GOTY!!!
AAAARRRRLLLOOOO! WHERE'S YOUR REACTION VIDEO? WE NEED IT!  😅😅😅
I need confirmation on 1 thing...If I play as Yoshi in online multiplayer, can I ride on top of a Yoshi riding another Yoshi getting a ride by the 4th Yoshi?  It truly would be a marvel to see.
Where is Rosalina and the red, green and purple toad? I hope he is in the game
The core game looks really good, but, like with Pikmin 4, we're focusing on all the wrong things again.  These online features will all be gone one day and the badges are unnecessary get out of jail free cards that exist only to justify collecting coins.  Nintendos games were known for being deftly refined and highly concentrated gameplay experiences.  Pikmin 4 is proof enough that filling them up full of this unnecessary stuff is the wrong focus, at least as far as I'm concerned.  Instead they're just throwing a bunch of stuff at the player seemingly without designing the levels or balancing the game around it all, exactly like Pikmin 4 did.  What's so great about your new power ups, which can only be found conditionally, when I've got a full on grappling hook on me at all times?
I bet someone is gonna make a Charles mod lol
Imagine if they added Wonder DLC for Mario Maker 2
Well Toadette’s playable, and that’s already a 10/10  Any game with Toadette as a playable character is automatically a good game
I desperately need a mawmaw plushie
This is probably the perfect Mario game that everyone needed, we keep winning in this house!
Neat that the new power-ups seem to be inspired by Mario Maker. The Elephant power-up seems to take inspiration from the Big Mushroom, and the Drill power-up seems to take inspiration from the wearable shells.
I love how the game looks, but I do hope you can mess around with eachother like you could on nsmbw
"one of two toads" they have an identity, i swear the disrespect is crossing lines
Daisyyyyyyy😭😭😍😍
bad network
The fear in the Koopa's eyes as the bubble takes his life...
Gameplay begins at 29:50!
The fact that there isn’t regular online 4 player co op is kinda ridiculous to me
Hope we can mute or disable those flowers, otherwise might have to play muted. If those hints are forced on the player that’s pretty bad.
The multiplayer is awesome! It's kinda like Dark Souls Co-op with their summoning system lol
I miss the days when you didn't need a spreadsheet to play a Mario game.
We want super Mario odyssey 2
omg
34:53 Nintendo be disrespecting everyone's mom
Hope this theme is in Mario maker 2
Good to see that they're fixing the recurrent issues with co-op. They don't force you pick one of the newbie characters if you're 4. Also giving you a chance to not lose a life is huge when some players are better than others. Having someone constantly at 0 lives made it not so fun
Was bummed that the characters all played the same....then they showed badges and I was HYPED!  Maybe they will introduce a mode that lets you equip more than one!
Dude, I legit teared up at this and I would have cried if I wasn’t in class 😭 this game has so much going for it and I can’t wait to see how this will inspire our next generation like how new super Mario bros Wii did to me 😭💕
its too late elephant peach is real
My biggest disappointment is that Nabbit and Yoshi are Easy and Very Easy modes respectively and neither can actually use any power-ups
this is really the only thing keeping me alive rn
2D mario really did a comeback with one (also went a bit overboard lol??) Made me remember the mystery and exciteness when playing "New Super Mario Bros." for the first time on the DS! Thanks Nintendo!!!   (Hoping to some extra world(s) too XD)
Can't wait to see Mario Maker 3 featuring Super Mario Bros. _Wonder_
This looks absolutely incredible!
In my opinion another classic in the making.
38:42 Hey, the P-Power up came back...mostly!
While overall the game looks really awesome, they really did the utmost to NOT include a regular co-op mode online huh? Pretty wack if you ask me. Still gonna really enjoy playing it but a strange decision especially when super mario 3d world got it when it came to switch.
BLUE TOAD IS BACK BABIIIIIE! 🔵⚪
Need to get better at online multiplayer and stop with all the locally play. Really sad Nintendo limits that.
Yep this is gonna be cool
Leave it to Nintendo to be the only ones able to get away with half-assing online features some pat $60 a year for...
33:52 w-what do you mean they all play the same Nintendo
Aaaaaah this is what you get when you have 35 years to polish 1 game :)
just when you thought bowser couldnt be more awesome...HE MERGES WITHA FREAKING FLOATING CASTLE AND BECOMES A LIVING FORTRESS!!  nintendo, i love you.
This game looks absolutely fantastic ❤
Mario And His Friends Are Back!
9 days from my birthday, can't wait to play this with friends
Big "Wario Land" vibes from this one, and I personally can't wait!
So Much of the world building in Wonder seems to be inspired by the early Mario RPGs, Visiting a Foreign Kingdom like in Mario & Luigi: SSS and a Flying Bowser Faced Castle that Stole the Kingdom's Castle like in Paper Mario.
the spin drill has a child now
Looks boring to be honest.  New power ups are not very original or thought out, and the art is not that good imo.
Wow this looks so fun
Super acid bros
Blue and yellow Toad are both here? I'm in.
I am very excited! This one brings so much more than the previous installments! I can't wait to get my hands on SMB wonder.
this direct was pretty wonderous
Since Toadette are isn't mario strikers battle league due to final free updates on this december 2022 and Toadette has finally returned as playable on previous games for the Super Mario Bros Wonder! 💗💗💗💗
*OH MY GOD AAHAFAHHGGEEHEGAFTASSS I WANNA PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!*
This is like the classic mario games but at the same time, a new one
So these badges are just basically how LEGO does cheat codes in their games? Unlockable assist type things
I'm so shocked they brought it back where you can throw the item your holding upwards!
This is oddly similar to Hollow Knight. The badges and abilities, some of the enemies, and the areas.
Nothing beats Super Mario Sunshine. Still the greatest Mario ever. Full stop.
Game looks beautiful  Oled is very basic Some amibos or pro controllers would of been nice
Gosh I love how expressive everyone is. like the koopa being scared of a bubble. the art team did a fantastic job
I can face a challenge. I beat the oldest mario games and face the challenge (mostly) and I'll do it again
I don't why, but this game look SO beautiful and pleasant
such a unique and great looking game. really looking forward to it
3:34 chill out, talking flower!
yeah fix 30:19
Super Mario marker getting a good update soon
what do goombas taste like 😭
Anyone else just excited for Daisy FINALLY being playable in a main Mario game?
Wait, the fuxk you mean they play the same? No special powers and physics?
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME
OMG I CAN BE A YOSHI RIDING AN OTHER YOSHI I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS!!!!!
Looks amazing!! Never stop making Super Mario games please! :D
Mario Stranding!!
Instant classic this one.
the elephant characters are going to give me nightmares, anyways, looks good
Wow cool super Mario is amazing 🤩😍 I love is Game 😍
This game is gonna be so crazy
I was already sold on the game, but the online is going to make it so much better.
HOLY MOLY! That was crazy awesome! I’m gonna try to get this game asap (As soon as possible)!
Only complaint is that we don't have online multi-player in the same capacity as mario+ bowsers fury. Why can't we have local co op just online, races only feel like a way of bandaging a gaping problem especially considering the fact that online multi-player is a standard in modern gaming and even in other Nintendo franchises so why doesn't Mario, the one who started it all, get the same treatment?
Starts at 29:50
I’m actually rlly digging this game
29:49 Mario Koug
Not one flaw. Even with the online not one. This just gives me Galaxy vibes if it was a 2D game
the first strand-type mario game
One of the most exciting parts is finally being able to play as Daisy in a Super Mario Bros game!
Mario MMO Confirmed!
Imagine super Mario maker threes potential with this
Florian looks cute, I hope we get more of him
Ill never understand why they feel the need to include 30 minutes of silence in the stream VODs for directs. Just start it when the direct actually started
Yes
This genuinely looks like a all timer guys
I feel it's a missed opportunity to name the various locations based on flowers.
It's the best Super Mario Bros game I've seen
Parachute Cap, huh?  ...looks like someone learned something from Shantae...
Didn't know this was also the new Paper Mario game!
Nice
I like the space levels! throwback to super Mario land 2!
My anticipation for this is right up there with Odyssey.
Video broken won’t plsy
Speedrunning going to be fun with this game
Looks like Yoshi _is_ easy mode, I know so many people who will be upset.
I love that they are really reinventing the 2D Mario games. The only thing I like less is that the characters don't have unique abilities, that would've made it even cooler. Having to backtrack because u needed another character's ability and stuff.
There is no reason for this video to be almost 50 minutes long with only 10 minutes of actual content. This is just nintendo trying to scrape money out of everyone and everything as much as they possibly can.
I have lost interest in 2d mario until i saw this....i will buy it since day 1!!!
38:44 oh no.
This looks really overwhelming
I actually love the graphics style, the lighting reminds me a little bit of Rayman Legends in a way. Game so far feels like a completely new and fresh take on a Mario Bros-like game and I'm all in for it. My favorite 2D Mario platformer game was Mario Bros U for a while, but I think this will be my new favorite 2D Mario platformer.
I love all the new features in this, feels like Wonder is a huge step forward for 2D Mario games!
This looks perfect. The badges just further sealed the deal for me.
It's been 19 years, put Wario in a main game again.
Some one could mod this to be a 12 player game
Elephant Peach and Daisy will have grave consequences on the internet
Well done Nintendo. I’m down.
This Direct was awesome! So many things to be excited about! It’s so cool we can finally play as Daisy and Yoshi! Well done Nintendo 👏
This is by far the most creative 2D Mario game ever.
looks FANTASTIC !!!
mario is so cool i wish italians were real
Not just a Game of the Year nominee, but a heavyweight contender at that. If this is how the Switch goes out, it will be going out on an excellent note.
How many times do Mario have to teach Bowser a lesson?
Anyone else getting cuphead and shovel knight vibes from how they handled the badges  (This is a compliment on how their game design has evolved and been inspired by other industry greats, not an insult)
No proper online co-op? Stop trying to make forced local co-op a thing again, Nintendo, this isn't the 2000s anymore
I bet the people will go like "WOW this looks awesome", but later people will be like "Booooo this game stinks"
I love the addition of the Bubble Flower! Totally original idea that was not taken from a rom hack!
This sold me on it I’m definitely going to pick up and play Super Mario Bros. Wonder at some point next year. Still got the masterpiece that is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to continue with and the great remake of Super Mario RPG to get through.
I’m super exited❤  What do you think Spider-Man🎤—————-⚰️
So excited!!! Looks like the fresh start 2D Mario needed!
Once I heard everyone plays the same I genuinely got mad💀 whats the point of playing any different characters then?
I bet the other characters as elephants are going to become a meme
29:51 That’s when the actual direct starts for the people that didn’t catch this live.
i wanted this yesterday... why is it so late
They should include a versus mode, like on New Super Mario DS
My man Bowser is such a real one he literally became a fyxking castle
That’s how you pronounce lakitu?!
Didn’t think Nabbit would be the biggest surprise of this direct… love to see him getting love!
So Wonder flower equals a bad trip; got it.
We’re gonna get high under the kite tonight
They should add Mario to smash
Knocking the spiny back up to Lakitu has the same sound effect that getting the perfect timing on Super Mario RPG when using an attack.
I wish they all played differently, like in 3D World, but I’m still excited! Also, the elephant power up being for everyone isn’t as bad as I thought.
I really want levels to go with the theme of the world like in super Mario world. It's been jarring how random the levels are in the worlds in 3d land and 3d world seemed compared to theme of the world.
This was overall a pretty good Direct! It's pretty cool how you can use badges like in Yoshi's Island! I like how you can make you character grapple with Vines! I also like how you can bounce on the Bubbles you've thrown with the Bubble Flower and Drill underground and along walls with the Drill! The Drill is going to be a pretty crazy new power-up! Edit: The badges originated in Yoshi's Wooly World not Yoshi's Island. Also adjusted my comment abit
Mario galaxy 3 próximamente
I hope online multiplayer with friends  is similar to Mario 3D world :( I hope we can start new save files
Words can't describe how amazing this looks
This is crazy I’m spending my whole bank account on this game
The badges look like an awesome addition to the Mario experience. Ever since playing Shantae and the Pirate's Curse I've wanted something similar to Risky's hat in Mario's toolkit.
The game is going to be amazing. The new OLED model however is so boring. They could have done something so much better.
Why is there so much inflation though???
Omg!!!
Dont usually buy physical games but this one i need physical , this is one for the books ! looks fantastic
I wonder what Goombas taste like.
Gee, spoil the whole game why dont you
Nobody is talking about 38:20, ITS SO COOL OH MY GOD
So they finally decided screw it let's make Mario taking drugs be cannon
too bad yoshi is not a regular character to play with :(
That poor Yoshi... After so many years hauling Mario around, now he has to deal with an _elephant_ on his back XD
I feel like this great but I do wish we got 8 worlds instead of 7 and I wish Yoshi wasn't an easy mode. I could see some disappointed with the lack of true online. The rest looks good and very original. I hope it's more challenging than the new super series.
Seeing lots of cool features like a sort of 3D mode, the return of storing items from Super Mario World and Super Mario 3D World, balloon Mario from Super Mario World and Super Mario 64 DS, the crouching high jump from Super Mario Bros 2, purple coins from Super Mario Odyssey, Bowser Jr, etc is indeed WONDERFUL! 🎊🎉
im glad i chose this instead of super mario rpg remake
Yo when Nintendo even asks what a goomba tastes like
Elephant Peach is going to become one of the most cursed things on the internet... calling it now.
Looks GREAT!  However, it’s a hard pass if they slap a $70 price tag on this.
Everybody knows there will be 8 lands at the end
i played Super Mario Bros U Dx for the first time when this started.
the flower voice acting is so crappily generic. does Nintendo hate voice actors now? they just want Chris Pratt crap?
This looks incredible.
Can't wait to play it on yuzu emulator
Finally, blue toad is getting a comeback
It might be a while before I buy this game cuz I have a lot of them I'm anticipating. Sonic Superstars, Spider-Man 2, and this game which are all full price with Spider-Man 2 being about $10 more expensive so maybe in a few months?
57 minutes
This game looks incredible.
41:42
THEY REMEMBERED BLUE TOAD!!!!!
another Nintendo cash grab Thanks you Switch Emulators that make it possible to not fall for these tricks
Daisy as an elephant is EVERYTHING!!!❤
I can’t wait for this game hands down best Mario game we will have for years to come😁👍🏼
This game looks so fun!! I want it once it comes out
Never been excited about a 2D Mario until now
mmmm..is prince florian gonna be a hot anime prince? cause, if so, this is a great call back lol
fun fact: that place at 33:20 looks so similar to the end of world 1-2 in smb nes
This game is going to be amazing!!
This is going to be super awesome!
Something i havent noticed was the super star, Will it be in this game? it has to be XD
They probably used pre recorded Charles Martinet voices for Mario ..unless there's an exact imitation by another voice actor because I can NOT tell a difference
Mario meets Yoshi's Island. I mess wit that heavy.
It seems all those psychedelic's Mario's been taking since the original mushrooms in the NES trilogy are finally kicking in. No but seriously this game looks like a breath of fresh air for the franchise & I cannot wait, it's so different & unique. Multiplayer with strangers is also something I'm shocked wasn't implemented sooner like within New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe or Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. Here's hoping this game is really good, Mario's been needing a good entry since Odyssey.
I've heard of Bowser Castle, but this is absurd.
I wish this game was rated Teen instead of Everyone!
BLUE TOAD AND YSLLOW TOAD. ONFIRMED
Im getting solid Yoshi's Island vibes from this game. Love it 👌
Reddit edition?!
this might just be my favorite mario game yet
Why is this 15 min video 45 minutes long?
Total fake out at the end with the "New Switch" :(
Thats soo fire broo
It’s not bowsers castle anymore, it’s bowsers a castle
Mmm.... New OLED Switch USSR Edition...😂
The flower’s voice is annoying
Loving everything... except... did they really just say that all character play the same? As in no more luigi high jump, peach float, and toad speed???
This looks so good
Toadette is playable, game worth buying
I LOVE the addition of the badge feature! It's almost like the skill shop in Sonic Generations, in which it can make a level feel completely different!
The music sounds like it's from Smooth McGroove on youtube lol
The Internet has lost its mind. Elephant Peach is canon.
Everyone is saying they nailed it but they can't even release a video that begins in the first half of the video
Remake SuperMario World!
so awesome, can't wait for this release
The fact I can play the game alone as yoshi just please me as it were Yoshi Story 64 sequel
Gosh, rhsi game looks so Great!!!!!!
I wonder what this game is going to be like when i do magic mushrooms 🍄
Super Mario Bros. Wonder is definitely the best when it comes to content, this game has a lot to offer!
Are we not gonna talk about how this vid has only 32k views but somehow 47k likes?
Sometimes I hate Nintendo, for example when they shutted down the online servers for 3DS this year, but now SMBW is coming, I ABSOLUTELY love them now! I’m so damn exited for this!!!!!
It needs difficulty please Nintendo
This looks fun and graphically it looks great, but it brings nothing new to the table really. A lot of these power ups have been in other games and the mechanics.
Highlights:  Blue Toad: FINALLY, IM NOT A GOOMBA ANYMORE!  The Deviant Artist: everyone has an elephant form you say?  Spiny: WHY DOES EVERYONE FORGET MY NAME??  Wonder Flower: and remember! If you’re not watching the Super Mario Bros Super Show, YOURE GONNA TURN INTO A GOOMBA!  Nabbit: this badge is gonna make me rich!
Huh, so instead of Bowser’s castle it’s Castle Bowser? Neat.
I wasn't too fussed about this when it was announced, but this actually looks amazing. Deffo a day 1 purchase now.
Turning Mario up to 11 and I love it. One thing I will say however is brave move competing with Spiderman 2 on the release date, I know they're both juggernauts but still.
can you do multiple yoshi per stack
yes
nabbit!!
literal bot comment section lmao
What a mess
I am going to purchase this game, i love you Nintendo
I bet some people will call this game fatphobic when it comes out
I am still bummed that you can't play as *THE* iconic Toad with red spots and the blue vest with yellow trim. We get 4 Yoshi colours, but not the most iconic Toad who is in all the spin-off titles.

broo, the elephant on the yoshi is the saddest thing I have seen ever... (41:46)
yo Nintendo, you're so awesome, but suggestion: edit the videos, if possible, or complain to youtube LOL
Y’all need to get rid of the first half hour of this 💀
I LOVE it when triple a game devs do cool stuff like this, EA would have just made more copy pastes of NSMB again and again, but nintendo actually did what the fans wanted! And by the looks of it, this is going to be my favorite mario game in a LOOOONG time, they even made the flower kingdom feel distinct, and changed up the world formula!  (Btw, that art style change is AWESOME! :) )
While the New Switch looks nice, they also should have gone for a more Wonder look, meaning more colorful.
This is pretty cool. I like the online features.
This is “ Babies First Mario Game” .. and it’s sad … the art style/ graphics are awful ….. the flower literally gives you hints about where to go and what to do next ? Really ? Lol … they even removed the differences in how the characters play such a Luigi jumping higher but being more slippery and stuff … this looks REALLY bad
Que jogo mais lindooo! A Nintendo acertou em cheio esse Mario, muito mais do que esperava..!
Im so disappointed that yoshi is the easy mode at least make him take damage or something PLEASE
I feel like there is already some elephant peach r34 right now.
Perfect
DUDE THAT FLOWER WANTS TO EAT A GOOMBA. 33:22
This is going to be the best 2D Mario game yet
I'm gonna be yoshi a lot now!
Wait these power ups are kinda lit
BOWSERS THE CASTLE?! Now I gotta see mario as a castle fighting him like reminds me of mario galaxy 2 so cool
The Heart Points reminds me a lot of Death Stranding’a Likes system. I’m so glad to see it somewhat implemented in another game, especially a Nintendo game!
Tripping on acid: Mario version
Ugh bowser again? Isnt there some other villain?
Couldn't help but think of Radahn seeing that elephant Mario riding Yoshi
Haven't seen a Nintendo 2d  platformer with this level of world building since yoshi Island on snes very cool
It feels like that Super Mario Bros Wonder is a Metroidvania game.
I'm so excited to get this game and play it! Definitely one of the best Mario games of all time so far
Bro can't wait to see competitive Mario races for real!!! THIS DIRECT DID NOT DISAPPOINT
Good thing they stay the same date as last time 10.20.23
Now I’m super hyped for this game. It’s not even out yet and it already looks like the best Mario game I’ve seen.
I was not ready to wake up to Elephant Peach this morning... But everything else (especially Daisy) is wonderful.
omg amazing, i was delighted 🤩
Bowser’s new form looks sooooo cool!
This game implemented Online in a similar way to Pokemon SwSh and this game did it WAY better than SwSh could ever DREAM of doing. Seriously, this game looks AMAZING! Can't wait to actually being hyped for a 2D Mario Game. Unless you count Mario Maker 2.
There’s just something about this game that just puts a smile on my face without fail
Reading the reports that this will be a more “difficult” Mario game has me even more hyped.
BLUE TOAD IS HERE YES
Yes there doing the super paper Mario rpg thing I wanted. I’ve always wanted a Mario game with a story to follow and characters but with that classic Mario platforming. Not saying the story will be on the same level but it’s still really cool
i cant belive nintendo kinda added a support class within yoshi (KINDA)
I need it NOW
Err is the wonder effect, what the creators/programmers envision the gameplay when they’re High? …..looks amazing!
This game looks sick!!! I can’t wait to play this game with my friends we gotta first super Mario Wii and this will bring us memories now we’re adults also enjoy your retirement Charles 😊 and the new voice for Mario and Luigi isn’t bad
No tanooki or ice aw man
This game looks amazing. I can’t wait when it releases!!!
WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING ONLINE PLAY!!
A little disappointed that Yoshi can't use power-ups but that's not enough to dampen my excitement for this game.
E L E P H A N T P E A C H A N D D A I S Y oh god
I want to get this for my nephew but i worry the elephant transformation will give him weird ideas.
It's gonna be awesome!
Yay mushroom trip
Oh cool, they put DeviantArt in a mario game…
I think I'm in love
Holy crap this looks so good tho Can't wait to play it myself :D
Tbh I’ve always wondered what Goomba’s taste like too
OH MY GOSH! I wanna play this game sooo BAD! IT’S SOOO AWESOME! 😭❤️
impressive, much wow
Except for the talking flowers and the near constant Good/Excellent pop-up spam, this looks WONDERFUL!
" WEEEEEEEEEEEE "
Looks so good!
The online multiplayer ghosts look so sick, a feature I didn’t know I needed
Elephant Peach got me rock solid bro 🥵
29:50 is where it starts.
Super Nice new Mario Game, Amazing desing, awesome animations and gameplays
Dark Souls mechanics in the new Mario game! I'm hyped!
As a huge 2D Mario fan, I feel like I'm one of the few people actually pretty disappointed by this direct. I'm sorry, but it feels like with every Mario platform Nintendo adds more to these games that just make it even more obnoxiously easy and the core mechanics just feel... eh.
No silksong?
I’m sure this’ll be a good time and I’ll be getting it day one, but Mario games are becoming more similar to Kirby games with difficulty. I’m leaning more towards Donkey Kong games for my platformers.
As always, Nintendo isn’t disappointing. This looks so fun. Thanks, Nintendo!
PLEASE make Amiibos of EVERYTHING in this game!! 😍🤩
LETSA GOOOO
36:04 that's what baby blue yoshi was for
The double yoshi combo 😂
Why Mario's jump sounds different? That is his singnature move :(
They called it Wonder because they couldn't call it Acid Trip 😂
Drill power up looks good!
Nintendo KNEW ppl were worried about blue toad with him being front and center on the characters title card, and being the first character they selected
The only thing I got from this was that there is no online co op
I can die happily after seeing obese Mario.
Wowee zowee!
Please let Rosalina, be a secret unlock, please, that would be icing to an already amazing game!
Yet they forgot to add Rosalina to the roster 😭
This is going to kill my quality time.
❤❤That was WONDERFUL!!!!! ❤❤
We need a demo for this game
I was unsure about if nintendo knew what they were doing with the elephant power up, but the balloon power up set it in stone…
Wonderful game, first day buyer here!
The bubble power-up is literally just the blue baby Yoshi
Why is there like almost 30 minutes of just nothing 💀
I'm not ready for Elephant Daisy in Mario Kart
The online race is like Mario Maker 2 all over again
Why is the first 30 minutes a still image with no audio, it was a waste of time completely
I was really hoping they’d using a different villain for a change
This is the perfect Game of Mario
Wow ok, I didn't expect an early birthday present, a trailer.
This game is gonna go crazy
What about Super Smash Brothers 6 game?
Is Charles Martinet going to be the voice for this game?
Ok, I am not a Mario fan but holy moly this looks absolutely amazing.
Whoever at Nintendo that made that invisible badge.... you're a sick individual   Imagine doing a challenge where you have that equipped on a mainly platformed world?  Joycons will be broken
Please tell me that's Smooth McGroove doing the soundtrack
Wow
This is awesome:)
can you imagine the speedruns this game is going to have
Wow I'm getting a switch just for this game!
PLEASE let us turn those annoying flowers off. I may not buy this game purely based on how lame those things are.
So relaxing and satisfying. They nailed it!
So the correct way to pronounce Lakitu and Lawkitoo 😂 ok then
Those talking flowers are either going to be beloved, or absolutely hated. Can’t wait to see which.
As long as their’s no Birdo this game is an easy 10/10
Anyone know if the acapella is Smooth Mcgroove??
Why isn't there online co-op Nintendo...   WHY ISN'T THERE ONLINE CO-OP NINTENDO  YOUVE DONE IT BEFORE SO WHY NOT THIS TIME
The Badges are such a great idea for changing up the way the game is played. What a great addition.   Can't wait for this and Mario RPG this fall.
This is going to be just as fun as Super Mario Galaxy, I’m willing to bet on it
I am so torn if I by the Mario RPG or Wonder, damn they both look so good.
I hope the koopalings are in it
My question is. Who is voicing Mario now?
Wwwow. With everything shown here. This has to be the greatest Mario game we've ever gotten. Man I can't wait when it comes out!
This Game is gonna be so much Fun. Love all the characters animations, had me Surprised seeing Nabbit return and so many Awesome features added in here. Definitely can't wait to play this Game!
Vine Badge = Bionic Commando
this actually looks amazing
This is amazing i cant wait to play it on my nintendo switch!
Ok, I am really impressed with the co-op for this game, The Player Shadow system is great.
I don't get it it looks like new super Mario bros yet this isn't hated I like both but why is this loved but not that
Wow theres so much color, variety, online functionality, and a sense of whimsy with this game. This might just be the greatest Mario game yet. There’s even a sense of replace value with trying to find multiple ways to beat a stage with the badges
Dam that story is deep
The jump sound is the same as Mario RPG.
33:23  I don't need sleep  I need answers !
The Switch is just red? That seem kind of lazy
37:33 omg its so beautiful
Of all the Mario Galaxy power up they could've brought back, they chosed the drill...  I love you Nintendo
I'm literally SO EXCITED!! Can't wait for my sister and dad and I to play! And I definitely can't wait for the RunawayGuys to play this in the somewhat-distant future lol
Now make this game to be hard.
The voice actor for Daisy really gave it all at 37:20
This is going to be one of Mario’s greatest achievements for sure, this game truly is going to be epic!
im to poor to get that game on my nintendo swich
so when does it come out
The Yosh abuse :’)
Oh wow they don't have those star coins like in the other mario platform games!?  It looks like u collect purple 10 coins this time instead at 35:28
give me.    I SO WANT THIS :D   I CAN HELP THE PEOPLES edit: CAPTAIN TOAD IS HERE HE NEVER STOPS EXPLORING YIPEE!!!!!!
The online functionality is so cool!!
It's perfect, thank you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!
Ngl I only watched in hopes we got to see this message from Shigeru Miyamoto and Charles Martinet…
While everything looks great, sad Yoshi isn't a regular character. I was really excited :(
Hey Nintendo of America.  Feel free to hire an editor to cut down your video so I’m not scrolling for trying to find where it starts.
Okay wont lie I was wishing this game would have different gameplay styles for each character BUT I’m not too fussed about it this game looks incredible! This autumn/winter season of games is going to be amazing
That’s it, Nintendo won. They made the perfect game. How is anyone expected to top literal perfection?!
Wow Nintendo really wasting my Nintendo online money.
This looks too good!! Amazing!!
Metroid Prime 2 remaster please!
Seeing this, I already like everything about this game. can't wait to get it.
Finally, a creative 2D Mario game.
I am disappointed that Yoshis are locked behind having to play an easy mode, that and they look kind of weird when they have something in their mouths
This is awesome
I Absolutely Love *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* game this year! This is Amazing and Fantastic! I even love this when Princess Daisy of the Sarasaland Kingdom herself is in this! 😄😁👍👌
blue toad is real
Bro i got excited when i saw Nabbit for some reason
It's not a complete 2D Mario game if there isn't a Special World at the end of the game. So I suspect they're keeping it under rap until people actually get to the end. Even if there isn't a Special World, hopefully, the game's entirety is SPECIAL, in which case Super Mario Bros. Wonder is already shaping up to be something truly special.
Mama Mia, that's alot of playable characters!!!
elephant toad looks funny asf 🤣
... I'll never forgive Peach after what she did to Mario in Odyssey. Daisy for life! (maybe)
I know this isn't even released yet, but anyone else excited for it's sequel, Super Mario Bros. Wonder World?
Looks cool! I really wish Yoshi wasn’t invincible though. Guess I’ll be playing as Luigi once again then.
Just don't like that they made yoshi the super easy character, it makes sense but i feel likd they should let us turn it off, yoshi is my favorite of the playable characters in this but I don't want to breeze through the game
this is gonna be so good
35:54 what have you done...  38:42 STOP IT
this should have been shown in the mario movie
WHAT?!? No Miyamoto speech? 😱
Getting serious @SmoothMcGroove vibes at 32:40
@smoothmcgroove music. I swear to god
WAIT! I thought the Elephant Apple was ONLY exclusive for Mario! XD But I LOVE how they designed Elephant Forms for Peach, Daisy and Toadette, they're SO ADORABLY PRECIOUS!!! And Goomba Form, we haven't seen that since Super Mario Odyssey! Except this time, Mario doesn't have a mustache in this form!
I like the new things they try but i absolutely hate some of the new animations like yoshis or some of marios animation so i will not play this
So no Rosalina? :(
No battle pass? Hard pass.
Imma be honest, I really like the ideas they went with this! This is exactly what a 2D Mario game needed after a long time, so thanks Nintendo, for improving an already great idea! :D
I'm upset they spoiled the antagonist
This game is a masterclass in animation. Every motion is beautiful
Ice flower where? 😢
A lot of things look great in this. The take on online multiplayer is really interesting too. Could do without the talking flowers and the "good," "great," etc. word pop ups when killing enemies though.
It is kind of annoying how all the characters have the exact same stats. I always like it when the different characters play differently.
I Mario *WONDER* if I can turn off the voices for those talking flowers? Nintendo continuing the tradition of absolutely grating voice acting.
Are they going to still have a regular Direct in September?
Peach and Daisy but no Rosalina? Other than that the game looks great!
Wow. Sure seems like Nintendo had been saving up on ideas, creativity and inspirations from the New Super Mario Bros games for this new adventure. You can tell there was an ENORMOUS amount of effort poured into this game.
this is a strand type game, prove me wrong (u cant)
34:02 MOTHER F-
Y'all. This, Sonic Superstars, and Spiderman 2 all come out in the same week. I don't know what I'm going to do with myself lol
It seems like at least with the badge system & ghost aspect, they took a lot of inspiration from Cuphead
Yoshi on Yoshi action 😳
I’m blown away
29:51 Starts here
Great to see another first party game that gives Nintendo the excuse to keep using 10 year old hardware
This game looks amazing. Now the only thing that's missing is Yoshi's Woolly World being available on the Switch too.
YEAH I LOVE THIS
I cannot believe a new gimmick is Reddit karma
CHAOS!
Looks great! I hope it's difficult.
Oh no, elephant characters other than Mario? What have you brought upon us, Nintendo? 😳
The speedrun potential for this game looks insane
41:45 yoshi getting abused😂
Luigi papa smurf
I wish baby Mario Luigi etc was available to play as
Wow!! I'm lost for words all I can say is wow!!
Bro said F it. Im tired of stealing castles. I MUST BECOME THE CASTLE
no joke when they were showing the elephant power up i started flinching when the guy said peach
Wonder Flower side effects may include "not watching the Super Mario Bros Super Show" (turning into a Goomba).
29:50 de nada
SMB, kitchen sink edition. So much new stuff
Peak
So the wonder flower is Mario on acid… cool
of course yoshis a bby mode character rip
Yooo this videos runtime is a massive scam. Nintendo is just making money off of nothing for most of the video.
32:12 Monument Valley reference.
Deviantart is going to go Crazy
......
I mean this as a compliment; this game really hits like if you combined New Super Mario Bros with the Kirby series from RtD to Star Allies.
I know what I'm getting for my birthday. ♥
Thirty minutes of a still image lmao
I wish friend lobbies were like local, how am i going to bully my mates now
38:43 oh no
This looks like the best 2d Mario OF ALL TIME
I WONDER if you’re buying this game on DAY 1?? I am!! 🤩😍
No online co op Nintendo? Taking a step back arent we?
Might want to talk to the editor who thought we needed to stare at the intro screen for 30 minutes, great edit. Fantastic VOD
This game looks like an absolute joy to play! Looking forward to it!
The switch from points to textual affirmation and talking hint flowers feels a bit creatively bankrupt and unnecessary. A bit too New Coke.  Level designs look good as always, though, and that's all a Mario game needs.
Add online coop up to four players and just make it the exact same as couch coop Please
Rule 34 gonna pop off with that balloon power and elephant form daisy/peach. I'm just sayin....
HA HOO
Why is this video 46 minutes and the video is just 29 minutes of wasted time!?
Elephant toad look funny😂
I can wait!!!
Peach has those woke eyes. She's not getting kidnapped anymore. Yoshi looks ugly when he swallows enemies 34:15. They don't look cute anymore etc
I'm so excited!
Oh thank God blue toad is in the game
You know this is a good direct when more than half of the entire 46 minutes is a single image 💀
It's so nice to see Nintendo loosen their grip and get more experimental with Mario again~
Those bubbles... SpongeBob on the GBA, anyone?
Is there an option to turn off the talking flowers? Please?
Elephant Mario on Yoshi's back 😂 "You're heavier than when you were a baby"
I hope we can have an elephant mario amiibo
If you told me years ago that half of the things that are introduced in this game would be a thing In the future I would of laughed but it is genuinely so cool to see how far Mario has come , looking forward to this adventure 😄
Now THAT'S innovative. Especially the badges are a cool feature. Oh, and the wonder flowers of course.
It looks amazing, the new ennemies, power ups, badges, the new artstyle, and everything else sounds promising and fun... but what about difficulty? Please don't make it as easy as all previous 2D Mario platformers, at least give us a hard difficulty setting or something, I beg you.
This looks so great!
i can’t wait to play this with my family
THIS WILL BE THE BEST MARIO GAME EVER CREATED! IM SO HYYYYYPED! 😁
Okay so... we are in 2023 and we still release game with couch co-op but no online ? I mean it's cool to be able to see other people playing as live shadow but... I'm not interested in playing a classic mario game with stranger. I either want to play alone or I want to be able to pick up my friend and throw him in the lava while he is screaming from his house man  Nintendo will never cease to impress me (for the good and the bad reasons)
Just take my wallet Nintendo 😂
so we can emote in the game with other players? And it has nabbit? Might be the best game ever
I can already see my sister raging at this and me getting chased around the house
That online multiplayer part made me very excited for this
This looks awesome❤
I can definitely tell that Memes and DeviantArt is gonna have fun with these power-ups and enemies.
Imagine this being your first mario game. So much to do and it still has that classic formula. Hats off Nintendo, you’ve done it again.   Ps.  Pleas let waluigi be unlockable PLSSSS
Looks incredible but I am slightly worried it will be too easy.
38:42 "Good thing I found a MAGIC balloon!"
This is AMAZING!!!!!!
it’s like i’m 8 all over again
That switch is very red, I want to bite it
This genuinely looks amazing and I can’t wait to see the finished game
I've been skipping on the 2D series since Wii because they all looked the same to me but this legitimately looks different.
So while I cant play 2d platformers  Because i suck so much at them  I love watching people play them I feel this might be a very fun game to watch people stream and play <3
Looks fantastic. Glad that we have so many characters even if I would have liked them to have unique abilities and powerups (but the badges are a good compromise).
Holy I can’t wait for this to release, also super cool that it takes a different approach then other traditional Mario games
This feels so good to finally have a new Mario game after sooooo long and new enemies that comes with it
I think considering people were complaining about lack of online play, this satiates any desire I had for an online mode.
New Mario edition switch and game. Going to my collections as the 3rd set.
Yoshi's back is gone
is mario new voice in this game?
First strand type Mario game. Bravo Miyamoto, bravo.
Finally we get to see elephant peach after pringus mcdingus refuses to let us see it
Bowser’s castle (Bowser is castle)
The Elephant form has one more hidden power…Being morbidly obese😂
Too bad they made Yoshi a character for easy mode.
I did notice frame drops when they show racing friends and a lot of stuff is on screen.
I cant wait!
CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's been 33 years but we can finally kick upwards in a 2D Mario game again.
33:24 thats louie from pikmin ngl
Assuming the music they're playing is part of the game, it's still as bad as it was in the NSMB games.
This game is gonna be great
Looks like a blast. I would have been happy with another new super mario bros.  But this is so much better
bowser acid body horror
Is great that allá the game do not depend in online mode, its ok but is like the death stranding interaction and nobody uses it
They really tried to hide Mario's new voice actor
Not only did they show more elephants..... but they inflated mario rule 34 artists are about to have a field day
Gotta give them credit where credit is due. That was a really clever subversion of Bowser's put my own on my stuff gick, i was absolutely floored by how it actually turned out to be...can't wait for the Final Boss fight!
Yoshi on a Yoshi was of the funniest and coolest things ever
New OLED just tells me that they are definitely are not going to announce a new console anytime soon.
Can’t wait to pirate this
My god I'm so happy I pre-ordered this game
Yoo that ending of the video, those levels look insane
**sniff sniff** I smell fanart
Looks "Wonderful".. I do see some framerate issues though, hopefully that'll be fixed before launch.
From what I observed the game does not have time to finish the phase, is that right?
So that's where the Paper Mario badges went. This game took them lol.
Jojolion is back
That wonder flower seems dubious. Might be illegal in some countries lol
Elephant Peach/Daisy: exists The internet: i can milk you
38:35 The sheer fear in mario's eyes when he realizes how weak goomba's really are.
Co op
Please tell me there's a way to disable the flower voices. 😒
So this is post Mario Maker Mario... Nice
Game looks good.
This is gotta be the best 2d mario ever. Only complaint is that the characters don’t have special powers like mario 3d world.
Im going to run around multiplayer with the elephant powerup in my pocket
I can't wait thank god I pre ordered when it was announced during the nintendo direct
So... Who's voicing Mario?
I shouldn't be surprised that a mainline Mario game is looking to be very impressive, but I am. The number of new features and capabilities in this game are fantastic. Can't wait for it.
44:28 I was just thinking last night about how long it's been since we've seen lil sparkies, what the heck
Yeah I’m quite impressed. I think a lot of Mario fans will be pleased because this isn’t like another new super Mario bros game. It has a lot of new additions and gameplay mechanics that make it absolutely feel new and different.
YEEEESSSSSSS!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
A demo would really sale me on this game. please.
29:49
This game looks Absolutely AMAZING!!!
Is it just me or is each world based off drugs? Rock pipe, flowers, white sand, giant mushrooms….
WHAT IS THIS GAME?!?!?
33:23 Seriously, the Talking Flowers are literal memes
Starts at 29:50
Koopas bop shells on the rebound? Neat addition.
So many new characters created if this becomes part of mario maker 2 as an added  style people will go crazy
This looks sweeeet
Direct starts at 29:49
Oh now i am even more excited to get this game!
Equip-able powers is the best thing about this game. The rest is meh
This is so Awesome! I’m soo hyped for this game now it looks really fun and I like all the different power ups and wonder effects and I’m just gonna say it I don’t really care that Yoshi is a easy mode character like Nabbit I’m still playing ashim cuz Yoshi is my favorite Mario character also I never thought I’d see the day where a Yoshi can ride another Yoshi also this just might end up being MY game of the year or at least Nintendo Switch game of the year
Molted!
This game is going to be INCREDIBLE
38:33 mario didn’t watch the Mario bros super show
I can only imagine how fun this game is gonna be! I can't wait to play this with my friend!!
Is that SmoothMcGroove doing the music??
It's great to see them implementing ideas from modern games, such as the player ghosts from Cuphead or the kind of multiplayer interactions found in games like Journey.
F*** they brought Dark Souls ghosts into SuperMario x)
Bro that bowser jr design
Its weird how Daisy is the princess of Sarasara Land instead of the flower kingdom
thats nice buts wheres tomodachi life for the switch?
POV:  Spiderman 2 releasing the sanem day as wonder
Although Charles is no longer acting, he will always be the voice of mario, always and forever, and everyone who comes after charles will try to give him that tone that charles defined, we love you!
So basically it's Mario meets Molly
Pipe rock? Rock pipe? Nahhhhh
They canonized the Bubble Flower, which was a fan-made power-up.
The effects really remind me of sunshine, and its absolutely amazing
the character list is the best one from any 2d game
Looks like an absolute manic fever dream of a game, as it should
I came only for the elephants but then came back out with much more to look forward to than funny elephant Mario and friends. 😃
só questão de tempo para rodar no Yuzu galerinhaa  kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Wahoo!
why does Elephant peach look like that
pipe rock plateau?  what is with these names?
oh dios mio elephant daisy
This is awesome
As a side scroller AND mario hater, this game actually looks super fun. Im really considering getting this one!
this is only going to make me more excited for the game
That's it, no smash?
Would have loved actual online co-op with friends but besides that I'm really looking forward to playing it, not enough platformers these days, like how it has a similar revive feature in co-op like Rayman origins/legends too
I live for Nintendo
Meh. Looks ok
BLUE TOAD
33:23 "I've eaten Goomba Jerky that was tougher than you!" (c) Bowser back in Mario Party 6... Apparently
Hmm.. the style looks kinda generic.. Looks like a better New Morio Bros WiiU.
Remember, an elephant never forgets!
36:24 I wonder if people will use this to speedrun pun not intended
MOM, LUIGI HAS TURNED INTO AN ELEPHANT
Every character plays the same ? Then whats the point?
It's like New Super Mario Bros. with the wackiness of Yoshi's Island. Can't wait!
(You count the medals: 1, 2 and 3 Life goes on, Anything goes, Coming up OOO!!!)  Can I call the flower kingdom something else?
No online multiplayer???  All my gaming friends are online?
Starts at 29:49
OMG
This is the ultimate Mario game and perfect send off for Charles!
Without Charles Martinet, it just doesn’t feel the same anymore 😢
Online racing is going to be my thing
So the elephant fruit can affect EVERYBODY?! So that means... Elephant Peach, Daisy, and Toadette are real. This. Is. Unreal.
Can I at least turn the flower's voice off
circle the pedo isles?
Flower Kingdom is surely one amazing location to start out from our main cast to start off, and we all hope that Wonder would be... a *_WONDERFUL GAME!!!_* Wowie-zowie!
OHHHH MAMA
Bro this Mario game is gonna be awesome I am so excited but it when it comes out !!!
37:50 When you touch a Wonder Flower in a course, you'll get high and hallucinate Wonder Events! Don't take too much though, you may overdose!
Nintendo really said "Let's make another 30 million unit selling game."
41:25 Mario x cuphead
Plz! tell me the giga bowser will return in there! Plzzzzz!
There's a prince now??
That poor Yoshi's face when the Elephant player jumped onto his back. lol
38:44 Looks like Nintendo is putting Inflation Fetish in Offical game
the movement, the badges, the style, this game is gonna be amazing, content wise and for speed runners, might be a top 5 mario game for sure
PLAYABLE YOSHI
Just saying, I bet that Caterpillar sage we saw in Bowser's inside story came from this place all along. They fit the aesthetic WAY to well.
This going to be better than new super mario bros
I told you badges were a good idea
I FREAKING LOVE YOU, NINTENDO!!!!
I'd pay a stupid amount of money for a Wario/Waluigi charecter dlc pack.
Standees? Player Ghosts? Likes?  Finally the first stranding-type Mario game
Looks a bit easy. Hope it has some sort of hardcore mode!
Warío and waluigi and Rosalina where 😢
blue toad returns
Waw!!!
Boring...
Mario is high
The Badge feature is really cool!
All i need is an option where i can play as the yoshis WITHOUT easy mode. I like the easy mode, it makes the game more excess-able and that’s great. But I don’t want to play easy mode, but i so desperately want to play as Yoshi
Bubble Powerup? Ability to dig into the ground? This is Kirby Squeak Squad!
Wasn't sure about Mario's new voice at first, but his "WONDERFUL!" voice line sounds just like Martinet in the N64 days.
Excuse me, this is Super Mario World 2, Flower Boogaloo, you can't fool me!
Super Mario Bros. 4:20 😝
Well, Wonder looks good, but if they added Wario it would be double wonderful
So glad to see Peach and Daisy playable together!
This feels new and fresh
I “Wonder” if Wario can join in on this because with his abilities from his Wario land games it could fit here nicely.
Nintendo totally nailed it with this new DIRECT. Hoping this new Super Mario Bros. game inspires the next Super Mario Maker installment.
Bro, they just combined Mario and Kirby. That's just amaizing
This is EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL!!! (　＾▽＾)
Nintendo of america NO SEAS RACISTA Y SUBTITULA EN ESPAÑOL y portugués de Brasil  ya que AMERICA ES TODO EL CONTINENTE AMERICANO DONDE HAY MAS PAISES DONDE SE HABLA ESPAÑOL  TU país Estados Unidos NOOO ES EL CONTINENTE , es parte del continente asi que piensen en todos los PAISES del continente , YA DEJA DE MENOSPRECIAR A LOS LATINOS
MAW MAW MY BELOVED
“I wonder what goombas taste like”  -Sun tzu
its a shame all teh characters are the same, luigi playing a little different was good...
I think they should make the yoshi take damage like the other characters
34:24 definitely not skipsquecks
Man those flowers are annoying.
Bowser Jr looks older, that's pretty interesting
I think this game might overtake Mario world and become the best Mario game of all time, excluding spin offs. I think I soulless 2d Mario game is already way more fun than a well crafted 3d game, so I WONDER how good of a game Nintendo can make when they pick the better formula and pour their heart and soul into it. This game is gonna be WONDERfull
This game loves inflation fetish
38:43 Did they just reference the Balloon Flower from Super Mario 64 DS!?
This will be too good
Can't wait till I get this game
Everything about this looks so good! Hands down gonna be the best 2D Mario so far! This is the type of creativity we need more from Nintendo these days. Such a wonderful direct, if I do say so myself 🍄🐘
NABBIT!
I've feared the worst, everyone is an Elephant which means we're gonna see even more disturbing fanart than what we already saw when Elephant Mario was first showcased        Jokes and fear of R34 aside, I'm looking forward to what's to come in this game. Definitely gonna spend my life insurance on this banger of a game, along with Sonic Superstars
I’m so thankful we finally got rid of the New SMB series. I was so tired of those. Felt like they were on autopilot.
Immediately this game is so unique and interesting, I really can’t wait for thi mrio game to inject new life to the 2d formula!
34:17 look at that face it’s hilarious
Cup head style level selection sometimes is a very cool idea
YOSHIS CAN NOW RIDE YOSHIS
boring
MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT'LL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
Super excited for this! Gonna be awesome
This is a Strand type game
Love everything...however there is one thing at least for right now I'm iffy on and it's the new jump sound after hearing it so frequently.
They should have named The flower kingdom Florida 😅😂😂
I'm glad Nintendo's finally stopped approaching their 2d mario games as if we're still in the '90s, considering how much creativity is possible in the 2d genre nowadays. I hope they give their next 2d zelda game the same treatment instead of just porting the (already on Switch Online) Oracle games in cute graphics to make a quick cash grab. Link Between Worlds' defining mechanic was one the most creative in a Zelda game yet but the rest of the game was based on a game that came out in 1991. Here's to hoping they make a whole 2d Zelda with that same level of modern-day creativity.
I guess Ceave was wrong about the item balloon.
The most unique and creative Mario game I have seen in a while. Hands down, this is going to be awesome!
Couldnt they just post a 16 minute video
Omg 🐘 toad  vibes like Diddy Kong racing elephant XD
ma.,roio
Love having to randomly skip through 30 minutes of nothing to get to the video 👌
I was so happy when i saw nabbit
Bowser really went NOW I AM THE CASTLE!
I cant wait for oct 20th
Looks cute, can't wait to be high af when I play it
Not bad, definitely seems a lot more fun than past 2D Mario games, they went all out indeed
Peach Elephant looks curse 😨
alright guys, you asked for it, and you got it. elephant peach.
king of 2d
This game comes out the same day as Spiderman 2, do I sense another Doom x animal crossing situation?
This game looks absolutely wonderful!
What a fantastic direct! But they need to remove the unnecessary first few 29 minutes from the presentation.  Edit: Yay, they’ve finally done it!
I love the friendly take on the dark souls phantoms 😭😭 being able to drop revives and help people when they become a ghost. This game looks incredible.
What a plot twist this will be if prince Florian is the final boss and Mario and browser has to work together if they want to defeat him
omg i can't wait
beautiful animation
Bruh
I'm sorry nintendo but the OLED looks terrible.
Bucken Berry and Ala Gold return
Honestly a perfect take on online mario. This game is gonna be great.
31:00 skip to for the actual direct
I know Charles martinet won’t be Mario anymore but I’m glad he will be Mario ambassador even when the new games come out
We need wario and waluigi in the freaking game as dlc bruh
I am SO HYPED for this game. Everything about it looks incredible, from the gameplay to the cast of characters to the new powerups. This is the 2D Mario game we deserve!
I hope you can toggle Yoshi or Nabbit’s invincibility if you just want to play as Yoshi with the flutter jump
I over the moon that Mario is allowed to be weird and wacky again. This feels like a Gamecube era Mario game with all the creativity on display and I’m so happy
I wish peach could glide on this One
Just as I predicted. No matter how it's played, no matter what the situation, it's *STILL* the same thing again like it always will be. "Mario beats Bowser. The End.".
This is a strand game.
O Nintendo Switch vermelho é LINDO!
The online feature was disappointing as usual
Wario is missing
Gonne be one of the best 2d mario games!
I think Nintendo might've been listening to complaints about the NSMB series lol. Seriously this looks amazing, definitely buying this game.
The yoshis and nabbit being the younger sibling mode fr
BUCKENBERRY IS BAAAAAAAAAAACK
Looks like a reskinned new super Mario and those games were forgettable. I’m not wasting my time on this game
that badge system is AMAZING
100% speedrunners are going to have a blast with this game
5:04 Maw-Maw looks like a creature straight out of Pikmin
I love how this looks.
33:23 what did he just say🤨
Unique levels different gameplay mechanics yoshi and nabbit for those who want an easy experience new enemies new Ost power ups bruh this is going to be the best 2d mario game ever im super excited. Lets de Go
They couldn’t edit out the first 30min before posting?
Super Mario Wonder is a strand game! 👍👌
New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe + Donkey Kong + Kirby =  Super Mario Bros. Wonder - NICE ! buy buy buy buy !!!!
One of the most creative Mario games I have seen so far. Looking forward to play it on launch day (on my birthday)
This might become my new favorite 2D Mario game right next to super Mario world lol
to much yoshi and toads
Everything looks great, I just hope there’s an option to turn off the bad voice acting specifically the flower.
This is the next generation of 2D Mario games and I’m SO excited. New Super Mario Bros Wii was my first 2D Mario game, and that game is pure nostalgia for me. Can’t wait for the new gameplay and to play this with family.
Thank you for everything Uncle Charles!!!😎🍻🍺
I love this game already❤
Man, this sure its my favorite Mario game so far
oh. elephant form isnt mario exclusive. oh no.
I'm super happy that a lot of Super Mario World elements are found in this game, considering I have always wanted a modern sequel to the former game: - The world map really reminds me of the layout of SMW (especially W1). Even some of the level designs and backgrounds also got quite heavily inspired. - Bowser using the Wonder Flower and transformed into a gigantic floating castle actually looks like an evolution of SMW final castle with his floating clownface car lurking in the dark sky - Characters floating using their hats, looks like how they descend with a cape feather, and Mario's animations are recreations of his old posture in SMW. - P-Balloon transformation from the Wonder Flower - SMW sound effects (burrowing into the ground = destroying rotating blocks), riding on Yoshi (I guess it's an evolution) - The pipe designs look like in SMW - Upward shell or item throwing (this was seriously needed long ago)  At the same time, this also really makes some big steps away from the "New Super" series, and I love that they are somehow going back to their original roots with SMB3 and especially SMW influences.  10/10 💕
Nah the badges add sooooo much
elephant Peach is beautiful ❤❤❤
They brought inflation Mario back 😭😭
Finally bubble Mario is real!!!
Poor Prince Florian 😢 I feel bad I hope he gets his castle back
So basically the Flower Kingdom can be interpreted what is beyond the background you see in the distance when you’re in the Mushroom Kingdom in Odyssey? Also, I love how this game just seems to be full-on trippy all the time.
Did not occur to anybody to trim this down before uploading it as a separate video? Is YouTube seriously OK with spending any amount of resources on streaming a still image for 30 minutes for no reason?
World isnt prepared for this game. I cant believe such a masterpiece ive just seen
Super Mario Wonder givs me major Super Mario World vibes
Lo compró
ugh i missed this! but i can watch it
Looks and works fantastic, the creators did amazing!
Mario and Sonic fans will be feasting this October! Great to see 2 platformer kings return.
I feel like Nintendo is buying all these positive comments! This game seems mediocre at best! 😊😊 The elephant power up seems suspiciously like a DK thing. Is it possible Nintendo poached this idea from the unannounced (probably much better) DKC title, retro studios has been working on for like 9 years??? Also: why would you have all these characters if they all play the same? That seems very lazy and uninspired  [must get excited and buy every Nintendo product]
I feel like if mario wonder released during the wii u era or during the switches launch it would probably be one of the greatest 2d platformers ever. But in 2023? When there are hundreds of 2d side scrollers on switch that have nearly all of the new mechanics found in wonder and were made years ago and are a better price point right than wonder will be l, I dont know man I just feel like this game if coming out a pretty late time by play forming standers. Its still looks incredible, dont get me wrong, this will be a must have switch game but its been almost a decade since dkc tropical freeze and it really shows.
1: this game looks like a mix of nsmb and yoshi’s new island and I love it 2: that elephant and balloon Peach/Daisy is definetely going to start, “something” on deviantart
This might be one of the Mario games of all time
Why is the online multi-player with friends not just... 4 player coop? I was really looking forward to playing the game with my online friends.   It's so weird that they messed it up like that AFTER giving us ED Worlds multi-player, which was great.
This is gonna freaking good
Best Mario game ever
You know how great the wonder flowers world distortion mechanic will be in the mario maker games?!
I just realized daisy makes so much sense because the game is flower themed and daisy is also flower themed.
They realy let us wait 30 minutes for 15 minutes of contend
I love Nintendo. I also love Mario and Luigis new voices 😮
Wonder Flowers = Reality Warping Drugs. 🗿
Seems a bit rote. "Here's your new 2D Mario side-scroller", "it has many convenience functions", "Interesting Areas". 😕
Nabbits back gang!!!
Капибизон Капибибигон
In my opinion the 2d mario games havnt been worth playing in like 20 years. This game might change that though. That bubble power up looks fun and the actually unique worlds that arent just the basic ice level, fire level, water level, desert level. The badges that give you additional abilities are a REALLY cool idea. Nowadays i never get my hopes up till the game releases, but if the game is actually as good as this trailer shows its gonna be a banger
With this and Sonic Superstars coming out not to far from each other. Mario and Sonic fans are eating good tonight
The announcer seems to be a big daisy fan and i can't blame him
The speedrunning potential of this game looks NUTS
Wow, this looks so much better than I was thinking. The badges especially have me excited!
Wow this Mario game actually looks amazing. Probably gonna be the best one since Mario bros wii
yoshi will die if you keep abusing him such as putting elephants on his back
The way he said: "Daisy" 33:46
This game is devientart
This game looks fun competitively, definitely going to check it out!
These purple 10 coins are like star coins
Looks like a merger of Super Mario and Kirby.
I can finally play with friends. Maybe they had something like a invite?
This game looks soooooo coool!!!!!😊 i cant wait To play this!!!!  Watch other people  play this!!!! Maybe play with other people 🤔!!!
Can't wait til October gets here cause we're eating good boys.
I’m so buying this and playing as Princess Daisy.
29:50 the video starts thank me later
Hold on the way how online works is actually pretty cool and Creative but online doesn’t seem physically next to one another though.
Bowser is now prime real estate
Yooo9ooooooooooooooo
I COULND'NT WATCH THE LIVE BECAUSE MY OF MY HOMEWORK    FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  but still awesome Super Mario Bros. Wonder direct
man if alphadream was still here it would've been cool if we got dialogue with voice actings in their game
PLEASE WE NEED A CHALLENGE MODE THOUGH... LIKE MORE OPTIONS LIKE A COIN RUSH I LOVED THOSE
where is wario and waluigi
This game looks incredibly fun! Love how all the extra features enhanced the replayability factor that was badly missing from the previous iterations. I WONDER what Nintendo will come up for their main 3D Mario title!
Wish atleast one yoshi wasn't on easy mode
This is going to be a really good game. It’s so unique and so much effort was put into it. I’m so glad Nintendo hasn’t lost their touch with 2D Mario
toadette is in the game i have everything i want
Is it just me thinking about gett 4 players and yoshi stacking everyone on top of each other.  (edit): yoshi at 41:40
29:50 holy crap that is an insanely long wait to see anything. So the vast majority of this stream is just a still image. Did we have to wait a half hour? I missed the live stream but damn
…I shouldn’t have watched this! But it was so cool!!! 😅
Wow..... I mean, WOW! I know that this is ANOTHER 2D Mario game but, combine this with Sonic Superstars and I think we've got a great year for 2D platformers on our hands! What I especially love the different enemy designs in the game, including the snail enemies and the Mumsies!
This Mario games like a dream it's insane and creativity is incredible
.... Kinda wish they characters still had their unique traits but the new powers are sick
Looks good, but i might not get it at launch. It is still a 2d mario game, which havent been great since the super nintendo. If the reviews are good i might pick it up after a week or two. Also why is the item thing mapped to A?
TWELVE CHARACTERS?????? we’ve never even gotten more than 6 😭😭
Well, this Direct gave us everything we needed to know and more. Will be very interested in picking this one up.
They know what they are doing with the grappling vines and the release date
You showed elephant peach and daisy, what do you think you’ve just unleashed
Beautiful, i wanna get it so bad!!!! ❤
38:43 The effect returned since Super Mario 64 DS?
Best Mario game. Though the story is generic (again), it is at least an upgrade from saving peach 1000000000000 times over and over again.
BLUE TOAD
Deviantart’s gonna have a field day with Elephant Peach and Daisy..
Honestly the toads as elephants look cursed
Its a real shame yoshi and nabbit are still easy mode... ;-;
can't wait to pirate this
The drill is from super Mario galaxy isn’t it?
All i can say is this will be my game of the year
Wait, so everyone has the elephant power-up? Oh boy, the Internet is going to have fun with this one.
Gonna buy day one. No matter if I am sick or my family passed away, I will get this game
So many new things to help the player.. i really hope this means the game will be harder than previous 2D marios then
My excitement is over the roof!! 🎉
I LOVE IT ALLLLLL <3
I want to be stomped by elephant peaxh 😢
36:19 nintendo is still stuck in a time where the word "baddie" actually means it
The online functionality is amazing for younger players but i can see it being a very toxic experience at the same time
that online conectivity looks awesome
WHEN WILL THE DOPES AT NINTENDO LET ME BE THE VILLAIN AGAIN, AND GIVE THAT LIZARD BOWSER A REST!?
I REALLY hope Florian becomes the new series mainstay.
Sorry Nintendo but you got to accept that no one will be playing this game day 1 because they will be more focused on Marvel's spider Man 2
Presentation starts at 29:49
IS THAT SMOOTH MCGROOVE'S VOICE IN THE ACAPELLA TRACKS  edit: AND GIANNI MATRAGRANO FOR THE FLOWERS
To the person who sponsor blocked up until the direct I love you
GAME IDEA: waluigis suburban home the gameplay is that waluigi must stop people from buying his home so he can clam squatters rights he will make cardboard ghosts like the ghost that are in luigis mansion he will scare people from moving in by doing a bunch of "scary" things it will be a stealth game with lots of comedy elements if you fail waluigig gets kicked out of the house and the game starts over
Im already in love with this game and glad its coming out near my birthday
So peach is not getting kidnapped anymore ? It's woke now ? Ok I'm not buying this.
Im gonna emulate this
From this trailer, this might genuinely be one of the best 2D mario games of all time.
What gets me is how it's not that Bowser has a castle, Bowser IS the castle!
29:50
I still can’t get over how in 2023 they don’t have online co-op.
the wonder flower gets you high and send you on a trip lol
Lil sparky and hothead return after all these years
Its hilarious that everyone has a new artstyle and then bowser just deadass has his nsmb model (before becoming castle that is)
Finally returning to the wonderfully weird Mario that made it what it is today, I neeeeeeeeed this game
The New Super Mario Bros era is officially OVER! This is the breath of fresh air the series needed!
I once was hesitant of buying it day one. Nintendo is killing it
29:51
I have to admit this is the first mainline mario title ive been interested in atleast over a decade, this game looks like its gonna breathe new life into the 2d mario games
Now I have no idea, what’s the most exciting about this October, the fnaf movie, sonic superstar or super mario wonder
Elephant peach is lookin               Ok. You thought I was gonna say fine lol
Video starts at 29:49
Elephant Peach got her wig snatched
Never thought bowser would become an actual sentaint castle but it's not the strangest.
Will Cap'n Crunch be a DLC character?
bowser puts MCU modok to shame
bruh… the yoshi under lip when they eat something is burning my EYES
Wonder!!!!! The red Mario oled look great.💪👍
for those looking for the time of the gameplay , it starts at 29:50
the main four not playing slightly differently like they did in nsmbwii/u is almost a deal breaker for me, dk why they'd change that
No one is gonna buy that oled model so close to a new switch
Im so in love with these fresh new animations for mario & friends. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dang I wish you could play Yoshi without it being on easy mode
Another awesome DIRECT! Gonna have lots of fun playing this new Super Mario Bros. game. Hoping this new game will inspire the next Super Mario main game
Starts at 29:50
how many switches do they expect us to buy? I really like that red model tho I wish there was a trade in offer, or an option to buy the doc and joycons
did you guys notice the difficulty on each level?
Mario on acid. That is all.
They should have made the Switch fully red, not just an ordinary OLED Switch
This and Sonic Superstars looks like so much fun  I can't wait for October
41:08 is the Multiplayer Direct
*WE LOST SIR CHARLES MARTINET!!!*
New Super Mario Bros Wii is still better
ELEPHANT TOAD 🐘🐘🐘🍄🍄🍄
This is a mix of Super Mario World and the New Super Mario Bros series with a LOOOOT of new stuff, I was already hyped before but jeez, now it's even better
Whats up with the stuttering..?
"locky-toos" 😭
ratio
New EKWReacts confirmed, y'all! Stay Tuned!
I love how the characters designs are so resembling of the n64 Era cover art. I can't be the only one that sees that. This game's art style is phenomenal! I can't wait to play it! 😁
I can already tell the "safety bounce" stamp is gonna be a late game thingamabob
No way 😮 shops?! This gonna be great 👍
35:55 the worst thing
"Making a total of seven areas, to explore !" 😉 Oh, seven, are there now?
I CAN’T WAIT ! I have been WAITING for another Mario game 🤩🤩🤩!!
38:34 Mario didn’t watch the super show
29:49 it starts
Please Nintendo just add options like "no damage from enemies" instead of making it something for specific characters. let people have accessibility and play their favourite characters please.  do better
41:42 [Insert "yo dawg" here]
I can tell that nintendo won't let us down for sure
Imagine the mods for this, playing custom levels with like several badges equipped at once or something
THEY C O O K E D
Omg why is it 30 mins of nothing?
Plop!
Why does yoshi have to be an easy mode, man.. i just wanted to play as my boy normally 😔
They put a ridiculous amount of effort, creativity, and polish into this. It looks fantastic!
When it comes to 2d mario game. SMB3 is always gonna be no.1, but this is very good for what I can see, might be tied with world for 2nd in my personal list
Bowser is such a menace
Since when did Mario become a Metroidvania?? What is happening??
2D MARIO IS BACK BABY
Alot of the same gameplay!  Boring!
The flower saying weeeeee 🤣 I love this.
All of the game journalists hyped for the baby mode💀💀
Pissed off that we can't throw people into lava
Am I the only one missing collecting 3 stars or green stars or whatever :(
That yoshi saw his life flash before his eyes when mario elephant jumped on him😅
This looks great!
Can’t wait for Arlo’s video about this
I'm so glad we're not getting another generic 2D Mario game. I'm looking forward to this. :)
38:15  bubbles might pop up! they missed a perfect opportunity there!
This might be the greatest Mario game ever made!  *the flower always talks to you.*  ... This might be the worst Mario game ever made.
Nintendo really tried to make this distinct from the New Super Mario Bros series. And they nailed it perfectly. Everything, from the art style, the new power-ups and enemies, all the way to the wonder flowers, easily makes this the most exciting 2D Mario adventure yet. New Super Mario Bros walked so that Super Mario Bros Wonder could run.
The player shadows and standees tells me the devs played elden ring (or dark souls, who knows)
Another booooooring Mario shovelgame ZzzZ zZzZ
The game looks bonkers!
Looks great! I wanna play it now!
Forget it they need to now have no voice actors for Mario or I'm not playing
Starts at 29:49. You're welcome.
Can’t wait to play along side others in online play, the potential cooperation will be so good
🤯
I can't wait! I can't contain my joy!
PEAK MARIO
This is amazing
So where’s Metroid prime 4
wowie zowie
Condarts are just more anoying version of flaptacks
Hope net game have some va by jack black and the crue 😢
Mario games won't be the same without Charles
👀
I wonder what goombas taste like got me CRY LAUGHING- Super Mario wonder in a nutshell better be that the flower is creepy
This is my most hyped game yet
cool asf storyline is literally mario & luigi superstar saga though
Wario and Waluigi WHERE
Nintendo really saw NSMB critisism and said "hold my wonder fruit"
Super Mario Metroidvania xd
This is gonna be a best Mario Game Ever.
I'm a bit torn. On one hand, this would have been a great final game for Charles Martinet.(Though his last canon lines being the mario bros dad praising them is probably sweeter) On the other, this will be an amaxing game for his replacement to start with.
There WILL be heart point-less speedruns, MARK MY WORDS.
Everything about this looks excellent, my one worry is that it'll be too easy. Anyone else feel that way?
The Nintendo creative juices are strong in this one. Color me super excited!
So weve had bowser have a castle, steal peaches castle, and now he IS the castle
We making it out the flower kingdom with this one 🔥🔥🔥
I feel like this eases some people’s concerns about this game being too similar to the NSMB games. And I may still be worried about the Internet’s reaction to the Elephant forms (cause we all know what artists are capable of), the rest of this game looks fantastic! Plenty of fresh and charming ideas are what Mario fans old and new crave and expect from the franchise.  Fun fact for anyone that bothers to read my comment: the Blue Toad and Yellow Toad have actual names! They’re Bucken-Berry and Ala Gold, respectively. I dunno why Nintendo doesn’t refer to them as such, but I promise, they’re real.
Well I definitely wasn't expecting this game to have Dark Souls passive multiplayer.
29:49 for all yall
10/10
Yoshi's are Peak
Okay thos is pretty dang cool.
Man i really wanna play as yoshi but i don't want the game to be easy
i love how for once they didn't forget the blue toad
Bowser Be Like: Imma Gonna Steal Your HOUSE XD
they spazzed on this game can’t wait
I'm more hyped now!
Glad to see a new 2D Mario game with some creativity and nice production values. Badges should add a lot of replayability, too.
I’d honestly be surprised if this game was bad or mediocre
So it might not be hard good
SO PUMPED AND EXCITED! The animation is absolutely stellar! It’s gonna be an amazing game!
They even put a Bray Wyatt reference in this game? Damn, nice Nintendo.
I like the music
I normally dont care for the 2d games. This game is the exception
who tf uploads 30 minutes of loading screen
32:48 Nintendo going to the open world aspects
I was super skeptical when the game was first announced, but the fact that theyre bringing back so many abilities and features that made thebolder games so great, im sold😅
this game is like kirby X mario
daisy saying “wowie zowie” isn’t something i knew i needed
Start 30:00
They finally addressed the elephant in the room.
"They all play the same" is a big disappointment
THERE WAS AN SMBW DIRECT AND NO ONE TOLD ME???
THIS ONE BRINGING US STRAIGHT TO THE FLOWER KINGDOM, THE HYPE IS REAL!!! 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
… did they just use Dark Souls as inspiration for a 2d Mario?
Ausome ,will be getting it day 1
I can't believe Drill Mario is coming back for this game, I definitely wasn't expecting that of all things. Galaxy is my favorite Mario game so I'm excited that a power up exclusive to Galaxy is making a comeback
This looks like a nice game, I might play it. Nintendo always makes games I love them so much
This is hands down the best Mario platformer I’ve ever seen!! Love how much love they’ve sown into it! I have the Mario v2 switch but I play in handheld mode quite often so I May hace to bite and get this one! Lets-a-go!!!
Oh god Elephant peach is worse than i could have imagined
33:23 Not sure if you really wanna know, but don't let me stop you.
Oh my lord  elephant peach
elephant toad
cool.
LUIGI ELEPHANT!  THE PROPHECY IS TRUE!
no bubble form replaces the tiny blue yoshi
that's it?
i had so much fun playing Mario Wii with my mom. so i am inviting her to play Wonder with me
Video starts at 29:49, Thank me later  Edit: you dont need this anymore so dont thank me later :5
one of the best mario game ever made ❤
This game releases on my birthday
While I wish the artstyle was New Super Mario Bros I'm still very excited for this game! I don't like the Elephant Power Up because it's cringy but those other Power ups the bubble and drill look awesome! I'm really excited for the Yoshi's! Especially Red Yoshi! What a vast selection of characters! I wish we had Rosalina though...
This game looks so good and fun even blue toad is playable definitely worth it to bring your family and friends even if they ruin your friends ship last time you play Mario games
If there one thing I want to say is, there’s tons of VARIETIES! Wonder flower let unexpected things happen, different enemies, amazing themes, 3 new power ups, characters, badges online races and amazing artwork.
Ok! I like it! This is great!🙂👍
"I wonder what Goombas taste like?" I'm sure Yoshi can answer that question.
9:25 So you know badges can make the game more fun… seems like you should put it back in a game that originally had it, that made it fun (heavy cough) PAPER MARIO!! but for now, super excited for this game :)
Best integration of online play yet.
MORE SPIKE STUFF PLEASE
Great Game, but they need to improve those special editions of the console, including more details IN THE FRONT and the joycons for example
I really don't like how Mario moves left-right
The online is gonna be a nightmare
Game looks fun
I can’t wait to see trolling in this game
yoooooo the badges seem so cool
41:43 YOSHI RIDING ROSHI
I really can't wait for this to come out, this is literally perfection.
Why is this not edited?
34:53
AHH ITS PRINCE FLORIAN! PEACH X MARIO IS CANCELED-!
ONLINE PLAY!?!!?!? OMG
Time to defeat Bowser. Again!
29:51 start ))) no mercy )))
SMBW is looking good already
So what I’m hearing is this is the best Mario game ever made?
Cool.
So this is basically the definitive 2d modern mario game. I'm so excited!!!
this game actually looks good asf
29:50 - Direct starts
We need Wario and Waluigi playable   Who will be the new voice of Mario
Such a wasted opportunity for a Wonder themed OLED!!!!!
They play the same? So does that mean Luigi doesn't have a higher jump and Peach doesn't have her floating?
I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning all over again, this is all I’ve ever wanted, and more! Thank you, Nintendo!
When will we ever get Wario as a playable character.
This game is so beautiful and gives the mario bros series a new fresh vibe. Love it.
🔥🔥🔥
P0G so many chars
it seems that luigi can take on a charging chuck
34:57 I’m sold on the little dude
Game looks awesome!
A nearly 47 minute direct dedicated to Super Mario Bros Wonder! Can’t wait for 29 minutes of it to be absolutely nothing.
I already looooove the music. Remixes will be CRAZY
What did they do to my boy yoshi ?!?
This looks 3-AAAmazing!!! Nintendo outdid themselves once again...another absolute gem 💎  on the way with zero competition
Where is Miyamoto? They said he will come to talk about Mario new voice actor?
Tbh, this is actually good. I'll play it.👍
The game looks amazing, I can already see myself playing around with the best way to complete a level.
I WAS SMILING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DIRECT. ITS LITERALLY EVERYTHING WE WANTED AND HOPED FOR FOR A 2D MARIO GAME (FROM NEW POWERUPS TO NEW ENEMIES)! IM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS!!
Although it lookw good, im anxious. My first game was mario bros on the ds, and that was simple(which in my opinion is better). Probably an unpopular opinion
the worst nightmares about the elephant powerup have been confirmed
38:19 super Mario 3d land😂
Do you wonder? Wii wonder.
I love Nintendo.
wtf is this monstrosity of a mario game.  Nintendo, you are trying too hard.  Stop it.  100% will not buy.  This game is going to be known as the worst mario game since Super Mario 2.
I’m in love with this game
Hope I can turn the talking flowers off
This game is going to be the best one in the series!
NABIT
This video starts at 29:50 , your welcome everybody
Now I may not be the biggest mario fan and the last recent mario game I invested time on was Oddyssey, but this one takes the cake  I'm stoked to try out these new mechanics and just admire the art style of tgis game 🎉🐘
I hope this game isn’t too much space.
Skip ahead to 29:50 to start
ITS TIME TO STACK 4 YOSHIS!
hmm the hoppycats kinda make me think of the 3d world pipsqueaks
wOnDeRfUl - Mario 2023
Already pre ordered
The Bubble and Drill seem like the most broken power-ups since the Cloud Flower lol I really like the variety and sheer amount of ideas in this game, but I feel like it's going to be even easier than the average Mario game.
Why is there nearly 30 minutes of just nothing but the splash screen at the start?!
This is the most excited I have been for a 2D Mario since NSBW when I was 10
I’ll not gonna say anymore. It’s literally masterpiece. Goty
38:12 New Super Mario: Tears of the Kingdom
The person who did the voiceover for this deserves a raise.
So who is the new voice of Mario?
🥱
wow this was incredible
Super Mario Bros wonder looks absolutely amazing and outstanding can't wait to play it on the Nintendo switch when it comes out in October but I'm really gonna miss Charles doing the voice of Mario in the video games he's a brilliant and fantastic actor in the world also let's hope in the near future Nintendo will ask me to do the voice of Mario, Luigi and other Nintendo characters too now that will be a dream come true. ❤️😁❤️
Wonder looks incredible!  It looks like a huge leap forward from the New Super Mario Bros games.  It makes me wonder how Nintendo thinks it's okay to charge $60 for both...
OMG YOU CAN PLAY AS TOADETTE! I’m definitely going play with her and Daisy the most!
So the goomba transformation in the cover is actually Blue Toad and the wonder flower powerup gave the hint and now other characters too can transform like that.
A lovely game of collaboration and not competition. Beautiful designs and music!!! Cant wait
Oh boy. Toadette and Nabbit. Again. Yay.
Any way w exam disable the big crown that the main player has when playing co-op?
How can they give us badges, new abilities, etc. in this game, and expect us not to want a new Mario RPG-type game?! Please bring Back Mario and Luigi, or make a new Paper Mario game with stats and exp., something, anything!!!
you'd be a fool not to play as daisy in the flower-themed mario game
Galaxy still holds #1 for play, visuals and music.
Yo how they got lizzo in mario
At least it has some sort of online
This actually looks like a speedruner's dream.
😞
Very very excited about this game!
Start of Vid: @29:50
that was epic... it was like an energizer bunny... kept on going and going and going...
The amount of money Super Mario Bros. Wonder is about to make Nintendo would make your head spin as though you're wearing a drill cap.
I am actually speechless how fun this looks
WHY IS THERE 30 MINUTES OF NOTHING
42:42 Hey look it’s me 😃
That's the first revolutionary 2D Mario game in 17 years
I'm so excited to play this.
THE COLORED YOSHIS ARE BACK!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It’s not bowser’s castle now it’s bowser IS castle
Regardless me and my wife are playing this day one 😂 , any Mario game with multiplayer is an instant buy, im hoping we get more games like this before the year is up it brings so many smiles and good times
Finally! More elephant friends! ❤❤❤
29:50 thabk me by tapping the like button
Can't wait!
29:47 content starts here.
Now I actually care about it
I want to get the game so bad. The backgrounds, the power ups and the rest are AMAZING
Luigi not elephant is giraffe you dummy not the same elephant bad Super Mario Bro Wonder
“Lockee-Tooz” being the pronunciation was the biggest surprise lolol
this dude really said “lockey-toos” I’ve never said Lakitu like that 😅
I'm definitely looking forward to this masterpiece!
38:46 i can already see the art of this
I hope this gets dlc to add in Wario Waluigi and Gooigi as playable characters
So excited for this game. Last 2d Mario I played was 3d land
This will absolutely be a day 1 purchase for me. This looks amazing.
Thank you Charles Martinet, you helped make the greatest video game character of all time.
This Game Definitely Will Be The Best 2D Adventure We Will Have By Far.
R34 is gonna have a field day with some of those power ups...
This is 200% gonna be a top 5 Mario game of all time
I loved that there's no timer to complete de stages.
Fantastic! I'm definitely looking forward to this. :)
Video starts @ 29:49
Great work; It shows a great design and programming work behind. I wonder how long it's been developing for the Switch.
So no player collision yet player interaction. That's cool
This has more characters then what I expected and it looks perfect💪 hopefully they add more characters and I understand about yoshi being an easy mode character but I wish it was an option for him
The too bad screen is much better then the usual condescending one
Nintendo's version of "Newer Super Mario Bros"
I can't believe Super Mario Bros Wonder is the Dark Souls of Mario games
This game looks legendary and may become my favourite Mario game❤❤
Iwata would be proud to see this
Mario Maker 3 is gonna be nuts.
Sounds like Smooth McGroove at the 32:30 mark....
The perspective change dude. ITS TOO MUCH!
Ok, i will be playing as invisible on online. Dont worry ill fond a way to troll
yoooo
Bubble Ability looks too much like Spongebob's signature attack in the GBA games....
30 Mins of wasted space? Are you kidding me?
I was curious why all characters played the same  surprised they brought badges to this game
Thanks, i hate elephant toad.
I love the way they made the "online multiplayer" portion so unique!   Gosh I love Nintendo!
nintendo truly went sicko mode on this one
Yowie. Zowie... This game looks sweeeeeeet!
This games gonna set off an all new generation of deviant art freakitude. Prepare for the storm.
It comes out on my birthday!
The speedruns will go mad
Can we all agree this announcer is the worst I dont want to be that guy, but i could've watched this without him stating the obvious "Collect coins on your adventure! Its as easy as walking up to them and collecting them. You'll notice the counter on the upper left hand corner INCREASE after every coin. Try to get as many coins as you can! Who knows; something special might happen if you reach 100...!" I dont know who's writing this stuff, but its getting annoying
Im so hyped for this game! I really love the visuals and the uniqueness it has, it is truly going to be different than the past few 2D Mario platformers. Can't wait to play it in October!
Omggggggg game of the year
They really are going to release it on the same day as spider-man 2????
As much as I enjoy Nintendo, it’s kinda annoying how they always explain pretty much the entirety of the game up front leaving very little to be discovered. It’s like handing somebody a present and explaining all the ways that the gift can be used. Like “okay cool thanks, can’t wait to open it and get exactly what you explained to me”
The creativity of this game is so amazing, will wait for the gameplays in the near future ❤
This game might not be for me but i can admit this looks awesome
29:50
Imagina esses elementos novos em um Super Mario Maker❤
Last Switch Special Edition until the new gen is out
Mario is trash. If you wanna give us a 2D platformer, give us another Donkey Kong Country.
The badges gimmick remind me of the Mario and Luigi games. RIP 😢
"I wonder what goombas taste like"
Looking forward to playing this!
As a ghooost
tbh guys i don't think i want this new game at all  1st elephant forms looked cursed af  2 really Nabbit?!(sorry i'm just annoyed seeing him everywhere)  3 annoying talking flowers that won't shut up  4 unimpressed with the gimmicks here  i think i'll buy Mario Kart 8 Deluxe instead  🍄🐢🐵🦖⭐
Yoshi can ride yoshi confirmed. This changes everything
Presentation starts at 29:49!
This will be in mario maker 3.
I'm still not fond of the art style, but this presentation actually has me excited for the game. This may be the first Mario game where I like all power-ups. The online features remind me of the Miiverse integration of Wii U games, except this time they're locked behind a paywall.
Online play is going to be so much fun! I can already see some creative speedrunning techs in the game! That'll be so fun to watch!
Hey guys! In the end, the new Switch RGT was talking about, another OLED color! 😂
yoshi rides yoshi! this is gonna be insane
This Game Literally Screams CREATIVITY Rigth in your Face!
I grew up with NSMB and while It's really nostalgic for me, I do and agree it had major problems.  But this, other than a toggle to turn off that damn flower, is everything I could've wanted from a 2D mario title. I cannot tell you how happy I was when they revealed the online aspect, I thought it was gonna be local or nothing again! So damn excited!
Looks super cool!
They have all of them!!! 😭
I can't wait
great first 30 min
So the elephant form just turns you into Wario?
44:38 DeviantArt be like…
35:55 deviantart is going tp bave a field day with this
q
The online mode is the best strand type game, and it actually looks fun
Gotta admit, if I didn’t know Mario’s voice actor wasn’t Charles Martinet in this game, I wouldn’t have noticed. The new VA does a pretty good job!
Actual video starts at 29:50
This game looks great Although I was so excited to use yoshi on my first play through cuz he is my fave but he is easy mode and I want a challenge so that sucks
You guys are shaping childhoods YET AGAIN!
From software online feature
This might actually be the Mario Odyssey of 2D Mario.
This trailer is certified Wowie-Zowie
You fools! You have doomed us all with elephant Peach and Daisy
They got Nabbit in here?
the 30 minutes of silence
Dashie is gonna jump straight onto using Yoshi for this game. No doubt XD.
It starts at 29:50 for anyone watching afterwards.
Elephant Peach and Daisy truly frighten me
I kind of hope you can turn off the voice acting on the flowers
Lol they made y’all wait 30 minutes for the LIVE, that’s why i watch it after 😂
guys does anyone remember prince florian from the original mario bros 3 cartoons cause i sure do
Seeing ghosts of other players? Leaving them messages? Truly, this is the Dark Souls of Mario games.
Is this truly the second strand-type game???¿?¿?¿¿???¿
Wow 😮 the best mario game ever
Nobody does it like Nintendo and Mario! Looks to be the next exciting evolution in platformers! Yahoo!
It looks better than I was expecting, hopefully it's better than New Super Mario Bros. U as it's been over 10 years since we get a proper 2D Mario game
With so many helps, the game will be easy 🥱
at last, the second strand type game
Peach elephant, new fetish unlocked
i hope you can mute those flowers, they’re kind of annoying :P
Okay, so it’s a ghost online play… I guess that’s… good in its own convenient way.
This was such an amazing direct had me screaming the whole time
Ok so this game is gonna be extremely easy but idc because it looks like SO MUCH FUN!!!
So this is also a yoshi game?
Amazing
Actual video starts at 29:50 :)
Is that Smooth McGroove singing?
33:46 the entonation of daisy helpp 😭😭😭
YYYEEEEEAAHHHH
So happy that Yoshi can finally go in Boss Castles now 😂
If ANYONE hurts a Maw-Maw, there will be consequences.
This is insane!⚡️ Never been actually excited for a 2D game, but I am definitely excited for this one!⚡️ Edit:This game is a masterpiece.
That guy needs speech therapy, it's petal isles not pedo isles.
The fanart of elephant Peach and Daisy  is gonna be INSANE
I'm excited Daisy and Toadette are both playable in this game. As for the elephant forms, you artists better control yourselves.
I really can't wait for this game!!!😁 YOSHI FTW!💚💚
I’m so hyped for this game to come out! It really stands out compared to the last decade of 2D Mario. From the design, additional characters, and all the different abilities, this game is gonna be a blast! Definitely buying when it releases!
So much fun, passion and creativity clearly went into the making of this game. I can’t wait to spend cozy nights playing it.
Is this the last Mario game on the Switch?
People who think Super Mario Wonder is wonderful  👇
29:50 is when it starts, your welcome ;)
Just waiting for an Odyssey sequel…
Blue Toad bros….we are so back.
Sorry Spider-man 2…. You are going to have to wait. This looks phenomenal!
Super Mario Wonder looks phenomenal! This is why we are Nintendo Fans 🍄
This is sooooo cool
Looks good, I sincerely hope we can mute the flowers though.
33:26 and thats how this game was named
Finaly the change up the formular. This looks fantastic!
Mario Wonder is officially a strand type game
Why did you not reveal the new voice actor for Mario?
Wonderful direct, Nintendo!
Mariowo der style in super mario maker 3 is gonna be amazing
That was fun and I can't wait to have fun playing this.
I know this is about to have the best music
mario on crack, NOW WITH A GRAPPLINGHOOK!
The Switch 2 rumors just died with this new OLED model release
fav part if the direct was the still picture 😁
7:00 AM NOA? really?
mario maker 3?
THAT WAS SO COOL! i can't wait for the mario console to come out it looked really cool tbh idk why ppl where being mean abt the game being multiplayer -_- like you don't HAVE to play with other people  i think being able to ride yoshis backs while being an elephant or being a yoshi was really good! bringing old characters back was also really cool! can't wait for the game to come out!
NABBIT is gonna be back y'all!
im about to die from choices everybody my life depends on you tell me which game to buy and choose wisely please: Hogwarts Legacy on switch - mario rpg remake - biomutant - zelda totk - mario bros wonder
I want to play as wario or waluigi they would look cool in this art styles
Might get a Switch to play this
Didn't think they could pack enough new features into a 2D Mario game to justify a stand-alone Direct, but I was wrong!
Dear Nintendo heard your new console is as powerful as the Xbox One, so does that mean it will be able to play games like Battlefield and Call of Duty because that will make the Nintendo the console of choice. Should have a Elite version as powerful as the Xbox One X. With things like a built in 4K 3D Creator so it can do Side by Side 3D and do Red Cyan Anglphy 3D at 4K. The Red Cyan 3D should be Side by Side converted by Red Cyan 3D so we get pop out if images go into the foreground. Yeah tested it with a 3D Creator Side by Side converted by Red Cyan 3D gets you pop out 3D.
I’m excited to see the speed runners get this game. Some of the stuff looks like it’ll create some fun routes
This game is gonna be legendary 🙌 It’s like history’s repeating itself 😭
Damn didn't think Mario bros could get any more fun than this ong😆
41:46 Yoshi: f*** me.  Also this is the best Mario ever created
Actual video starts playing at 29:50
😀
Sheeesh, that perspective change is trippy. This game is cooking
I wonder what matpats stupid theory about this will be
@nintendo When do we get Twilight Princess and Wind Waker on the Switch?
i must protect the maw-maw
Even tho abit disappointed that Mario, Luigi, Daisy and Peach wont have unique abilities (like Luigi's ability to jump higher and Peach floating down slowly), everything else looks promising for this game. Cant wait to get this game on release😬
Welp, it’s not just Mario that can use the elephant form.  Here comes the fan art.
Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Blue and Yellow Toad, Nabbit (tell me who he is), and TOADETTE! TOADETTE'S IN THE GAME! And also I'm very happy to see some new creatures, power ups, and new areas, also Bowser, Bowser Jr. and Kamek and of course we can't forget Prince Florian.
having your online  firends play as ghost is dumb. have full online playing with people
I've never been this excited for a 2D Mario game. Especially the badges finally take the game to the modern era of Jump'n'Runs.
This looks kinda mediocre
Starts at 29:58
Oh my god this might be the best Mario 2D ever
Okay they called this thing at 36:40 the Spiky aren’t they called Spiny?
Caesar Zeppeli powerup lets gooooooo
I’m dying to see the kaizo rom hacks that people are gonna make for this game 😂
Starts at 29:50
Oct fun  Monthly   baby's..  spider man  2   wonders  &,    Helldriver 2  too
This game is actually so expressive, I love it so much already from what I'm seeing here 😊
This is the first true sequel to Super Mario World. Same vibes anyway!
42:18 what is peach doing to nabit
35:09 He forgot to say, "Whatever those  guys are!"
It’s too bad we didn’t get to see Charles and Mr. Miyamoto’s video about passing the torch.  I guess they have to follow the NDA.  Maybe in the September or October direct.
New Mario game. epic
This is why Nintendo is #1. They dont need the fastest/strongest console to outshine any other team out there. Just amazing.  My 2023 is set on games going forward
Am I the only one that thinks they let too many details about the game? Like nothing will really seem surprising.
they took away the timer and the score
Amazing Direct Nintendo!🙂👍❤️
NABBIT YES
"Dear Mario, please do NOT come to the castle, i just ate the entire cake i baked for you..."- Princess Peach
Love how Blue Toad, Toadette, and Nabbit were added to the wallpaper after they were announced.
OH NO, TWITTER ARTIST, DON'T DRAW PEACH ELEPHANT
cant believe they brought back luigi
ok this direct actually convinced me i really would like this mario game kk
44:38  Oh no.... It's Deviantart all over again....
MARIO IS A STRAND TYPE GAME NOW
The burrow ability is actually really creative and makes sense because since Super Mario World we've had iconic boss enemies that are capable of burrowing and reappearing.
If I had a nickel every time you had to literally fight a Bowser's Castle I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
As someone who grew up on New Super Mario Bros. Wii, this is honestly looking like it might be my favorite video game of all time.
Wario isnt playable😭😭😭
Duff Beer for me, Duff Beer for you, I'll have a Duff, You'll have one too…
Mario wonder, its... wonder.🎉
THIS LOOKS INSANE!!!! I pre-ordered the game and I’m soooo hyped!
first kirby, now mario. drill is life.
29:50
Here at 23,319 views. (before that too)
Me gustaría que haya una versión demo, eso podría promocionar mejor el juego para darnos un vistazo de lo que se viene y así ver si nos gustó, lo cual es muy probable, o si no era lo que esperabamos. Por favor nintendo, sería una buena idea😅
Yoshi is having a hard time caring an elephant
It starts @29:51
Nintendo did it again! 🤩
So can you do the races with random people???
here before 1000 comments
Why not make a new Boss
This goes crazy
Someone mentioned yoshi being an easy mode now is kinda dissapoiting and i agree, would've rather to have him being able to take damage but with the extra features he got, not a big deal tho
How did Mario add skill trees but  it overwatch 😭
Wonder is the Dark Souls of Mario games.
I love how goomba wakes up when mario walks close to him 31:48
❤❤❤❤
My only gripe is that Yoshi is invincible, i love to play him but that makes the game to easy, but maybe the knockback can help with the challenge for insta kill parts.
Video starts at 29:50
Video starts at 29:50, your welcome
Awesomesauce
I like how half of this clip is nothing but a wallpaper lol
29:49 That is when it starts
I wish it would come out with a Geometry Dash 2.2 update....      Ehh.. maybe it can happen.. right?
Well the Mario Elephant transformation looks like Benjamin Blümchen (=Flower) a German cartoon char.... xD pls google it they even have the same hat lololol
YOU CAN THROW SHELLS UP AGAIN HOLY MOLY  honestly wasn't super hopeful going into this trailer but damn this game looks insane
Wowie zowie
Flower: You'll share your water with me? 0:  Me: *cries in photosynthesis*
starts at 29:50
41:44 And here we have a picture of Yoshi riding another Yoshi.   Brilliant.
Tomodachi Life better be coming soon. I've been waiting forever for a new one
I wanna be YOSHI
People are going to be so weird about Elephant Peach and Daisy
Yoshi and Nabbit have no power ups
My jaw was dropped the entire direct. This game looks so flushed out and every detail was accounted for and wasn't forgotten about. Amazing and im so excited to play this game!!!
Elephant Peach and Daisy make me worried
KRACC BACC WAKE UP
“Somebody cooked here”
Looks sweet
Rule 34 elephant incoming
I can already tellspeedruns of this game are going to be crazy.   P.s.bubble mario looks like someone pulled a sonoc oc on normal mario lol. So s8mple, let effective. And the dril reminds me alot of the one from forgotten land.  Team luigi for the win!
here before 20 min
I’m so excited for this
If giving Bowser a rock theme is a constant for upcoming games im ALL FOR IT!
Nintendo always surprises positively.
It’s gonna be strange to not have Charles voice act on Wonder. But I am excited to give this one a try. This game will be one of the most astonishing pieces yet to be created.
This game is gonna sell like hot cakes due to the success of the movie
29:49 Direct starts here.
Can't wait for this game! Kind of upset that the Yoshi's are easy mode but it makes sense since you can play as Green, Red, Light-Blue, and Yellow.
Day One on the new 2D Mario!!
I still don’t know if I’m going to like this game or not. It feels like a constant sugar rush, I don’t need to get so much incentives literally every second in a game lol
Crazy if true
Ngl, this looks amazing
Florian isn’t his real name… I can feel it
We just witnessed a yoshi riding  another yoshi, this game is gonna be incredible 😂
This Nintendo direct was so dope and incredible 🎉🎉🎉
This is a Mario game on bath salts and I am all here for it! 🤣
This direct was one of Nintendo's best for sure, as everything in this trailer was so charming, colorful, and exciting. It's great that we have a 2D Mario game that is new and not unoriginal, unlike the new Soup series. This game will be one of my favorite games of 2023 alongside Sonic Superstars and the Mario RPG remake.
I must admit, Mario's new voice is starting to grow on me
They really went the extra mile in letting you interact with other players except actually PLAYING with them. Game looks incredible but no online co-op with friends is such a massive bummer.
Mario is trash. Ray-man, come back, bro! We need u!
Wished Yoshi was capable of using powerups.. and now it must suffer carrying more than 4 ton of elephants.
Imma beat this game as daisy
Норм игра, ждём
So, is W̶e̶e̶d̶ Wonder Flower legal in the Mushroom Kingdom?
29:50
Skip to 16:25 for the demo.
WOOO 🥳 HOOO
So it has online just a weird way of ghost online? Instead of the normal mario 3d world one? 😕  Ill take it ig
Yoshi is easy mode 🥲
what did they do to Yoshi's face??? D:  I hate it (when he eats stuff)
It Starts at  29:49
Lanky Kong would be so proud of everyone. I only wish he was still here to see his niche hobby hit the mainstream.  Rest in peace, my guy. Say hello to Chunky for us 😢❤🙏
you know i thought that elephant power up was mario only....well
Just Amazing I almost fainted (not joking)
I’m just a minute into it, and the music alone (Bowser’s metal theme) is enough for me to pre-order.
Feels like a trip with this flowers and the beautiful level design.
The new Mario adventure begins.
First mushrooms, now weird plants. I think Mario is in need of a long and intense rehab.
wowie zowie.
that was wonder-ful🤣🤣🤣
WE WILL BE PLAYING
Elephant mario better learn gravity magic to continue riding that small yoshi
29:48 START
30:27 Bowser moving Castle
Did 41:04 not sound like Pokemon XD Gale Of Darkness music!?!? Awesomeee
Finally a 2D mario with a soul
I think we can all agree that this looks AWESOME!
2:45 firey boopkins
hope that the game comes to the switch 2
This is the Second Strand type game.
The furry community is so hyped for this game🔊🔊🔊🗣️🗣️🗣️💬💬💬🔥🔥🔥
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
For everyone worrying about the coop mode, this did NOT disappoint. I can’t wait to be a ghost and also earn some heart points 👻❤ This is going to be an amazing game!
flower effect kinda more like weed effect xD
That is pretty cool, although I feel like the drill power-up has been already used before (Super Mario Galaxy), but the Flower Kingdom, new enemies, and some others is definitely going to make the game great for everyone.  Edit: There also some new enemies here, like a scary door-like enemy, a armadillo-like enemy, a flounder-like enemy, beak-shooting birds, jumping fishes, slime-like enemy, and many more! How many new enemies are going be in this game?
The online aspect with revolutionize the franchise, this expands content in many new ways. I think many YouTubers will creat a bunch a content. Even the ones who don’t play super Mario games.
MORE ELEPHANTTTS?!!!!!!!
This looks great, the whole elephant thing is still kinda cursed though
27 minutes of nothing????
THANK GOODNESS NABBIT IS HERE
I lost count of how many power-ups are in this game. There is so much😄, also I love how much Expression everyone has, they look so alive❤️
Why is the Peach elephant pink but not Mario. e
This has to be one the best 2d Mario games we have gotten in a long time
They turned bowser into a castle, funniest thing I've ever seen.
Welp I'm ready to be Spider-man in the mario world.
Game looks cool, Edit in the video for time Sucks... Also some background noise??
probably gonna be one of the best mario games hands down
Video starts at 29:50
deviantart is canon
Wowy-Zowy! This game looks amazing! There's so much Variety ib worlds and characters and just so much content in general! The power ups are great throwbacks as well. The Buuble power up is like the blue baby yoshi from NSMB U, and the drill power up is like the one in Mario Galaxy as well as the Spiny Cap from Mario Maker! This game looks really awesome, and the online mode looks like a lot of fun! Definitely gonna get this the day it comes out!
32:27 An WHAT Forest *insert mr incredible picture here*
I can’t wait to get it this Christmas I really like the fact you can play as yoshi ( yoshi is one of my favorite characters) and the online parts just makes the game more “wonderful” as it truly is. excited to play with other players. This is about to become a wonderful 2d Mario game
29:50 the thing starts here.
Im exited for this game i love everthing i see
This is a day one purchase for me.
Yoshi not taking damage seriously
I can’t wait to play!!!
Really an amazing direct and best Mario Bros game so far 🔥🔥🔥
This is more than I have imagined for this new Mario title! Hands down, it's Wonderful!
I'm sad that they made Yoshi be essentially an easy mode, it would have been cool if he took damage then turned into Baby Yoshi, but I'm still excited for this game, regardless. I'm just sad that Yoshi can't power up/take damage (rip elephant yoshi). I must admit however, he is a much more natural fit for an 'easy character' than Nabbit. Since there's so many playable characters, it would be epic to have a 6, 8, or even 11 player mode
Fantastic direct, looking forward to the game now!
This game is kinda like Super mario world And I love IT!
The speedrunning community is going to have a field day with this between the option to race players, use different badges, etc.  It's going to be great
This is the most everyone-friendly and replayable mario game ever.  5 easy mode characters with the choice to literally carry little timmy through the stage if you need too. 6 regular mode characters.(the most character choice we’ve had so far is 5) Powers that feel new and can offer ease for new players and skill for precise jumps Badges that can make replaying a stage different, easier AND harder! Online options that are classic AND new. Also, did they add a pseudo save-state!!! (Its optional, most importantly) that also functions as a collectable, what?
most playable characters in a mainline 2d mario game
I think i just got one heck of a birthday present!!
This game is definitely going to be Wonder-ful.
New Daisy voice clip!
I swear, PLEASE let me mute the millennial writer flower
I love how they combined every menu and stuff from each game if u pay attention
WHY DOES THIS GO SO HAAAAAAAARD THO
Anyone hear the Wii bowling pins sound at 38:38? Got hit with a bit of nostalgia!
Can't wait to play super mario realistic mushrooms! That plumber is high af.
Love that all the characters from past New Super Mario bros games returning to be playable with even Toadette and Nabbit coming back and playing as new ones like Peach, Daisy and Yoshi himself without have to be ridden on from Wonder, Bowser Jr and Kamek also return and kidnapping the flower population!
All right folks , back to sleep. Direct is over.
Can't wait to suffer hours in a level just to use yoshi or nabbit in the end🗽
W
The game just has so much going on  Glad I stayed to watch it all Really hyped for this game  It looks amazing
STARTS AT 29:50 FOR ANYONE WHO MISSED THE LIVE STREAM
Wait this game looks AWESOME 12 characters, a new and fresh artstyle, cool new power ups (bubble looks SICK), online looks fun af and you don’t need friends to enjoy it, BADGES, and so much more! This is definitely the breath of fresh air that 2D Mario needed. Thank you Nintendo! Can’t wait for 8/20!!!! 😎😎😎
Bowser getting a castle with Pirahna Plant arms, Toadette and Nabit being playable, Balloon Mario coming back, and Peach and Daisy turning into elephants  Whats going on?!
The only thing that disappointed me is that Mario Switch. They should’ve made it Wonder themed. Oh well. My wallet will be hurting plenty this October. I was looking forward to Wonder before the Direct. Now I’m hyped af. Would someone tell that elephant to get off that poor Yoshi.
I am surprised the flowers were not voiced by Chris Pratt.
PERFECTION!
Wasn’t the drill introduced in galaxy though?
Never thought I would see the day Peach and Daisy turn into elephants. All jokes aside, the hype train is definitely chugging away.
funny how an elephant represents fatness and a fat princess peach. lol well done nintendo
This game looks unbelievably fantastic. This is gonna be the best 2D Mario. For sure. I haven't been excited for a 2D Mario game since the DS. I'm shocked at how much they're shaking things up with this 35 year old formula.   Creativity is king.
We need toadette
can you imagine if this style of mario was in mario maker 2?
I only hope i can turn off the flowers talking.
BOWSER IS NOT KIDNAPPING ANYONE??????? FINALLY NINTENDO, FINALLY (actually, he is kidnapping, but it's similar to 3d world)
was glad there was a new 2d Mario game that's actually really alive now! the only thing i have a problem is with how online is made, sure it deletes trolls but having to grab people and collide is fun.
Nintendo really messed up with this game it should have been an RPG it looked set up to be one and it would have been so perfect  🤦‍♂️
I wish the local co-op could also be played online rather than the ghost stuff. Ghosts feel better if you're playing online with random people rather than people you're friends with, and I know me and my friends that aren't local would rather have the normal 2D mario co-op experience.
Gameplay starts at 29:50, for those looking for the time   Edit: This comment was made before the wait time was cut out
AAAAAAA ME LO PERDÍ 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Ufffffff alto contenido más encima online, seguro tendrá DLC más adelante 🤑 PD: C viene los fan arts como elefantes 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
No bouncing on other players heads. 0/10   (Okay but jokes aside, this looks incredible.)
The fact people have been rumouring about this game for many years is insane Absolutely worry the wait for this masterpiece
Starts at 29:50
Amazing, hope we can get some additional characters like Wario, Waluigi, Rosalina, etc., especially where they all already play the same! It's like Nintendo finally caught on that we don't have pre-conceived expectations on different characters behaving differently, which is why Miyamoto never included characters like Wario before!  I hope at some point they take the Smash Bros./original Mario Bros. inspiration of having fireball color coordinate with characters too, that'd be cool.
That was good Direct! (Yoshi on other Yoshi and all elephants except Mario and Luigi looked cursed)
Can the official Nintendo of America account not trim the video or at least put a timestamp?
This Was AWESOME
Please tell me you’ll have a September direct with not only one game in it
Great! I already want this game!
Hopefully Sega doesn’t find out that Nintendo have remodelled the phantom ruby and made it better.
The shadows are totally the devs seeing the netcode and thinking "How do we circumvent this?"
I wonder what the next Nintendo Console will be...
Bro turned into an entire castle
This could be Martinet last Mario outing
34:00 HA! THOSE ARE MY BOIIIIS! 35:50 *OH GOD I DIDN'T THINK I'D SEE THAT* Ngl I'm excited! This game is gonna be cool!
Thank god blue toad is back. But Nintendo should have a option to pick a toad color.
The new Mario VA does a good job, unless they are using Charles voicelines that they saved and reused
I love it when this game has some well voice acting.
starts at 29:50
This already has more personality than every NSMB game
Can’t wait to play this while stoned
I'll Play Soon
starts at 29:48
This game looks insane cant wait
Stream starts at 29:49
It starts at 29:50
now this, this game is worth 60 bucks laugh😂
This is the 2D Mario I've wanted in the longest time. It's WEIRD and I love everything about it.  YOSHI CAN RIDE YOSHI.  We won.
Peak! Will be buying!
It bigins at 29:49
Looks great! October 20th finna be hype with this and Spider-man 2
THE RETURN OF BLUE TOAD
Flowers seem to add a bit of humor and can be kinda cool that they are being voiced.  Also the cuphead similar mechanic is really cool, i love the power ups and levels too, this is going to be day one for me, bravo Nintendo for making great creative games every year 👏 ❤
So basically its super mario world all over again
I think there is a hidden area (maybe post-game) at the right-hand corner of the world map.
Evrything is realy realy cool but why cant play rosalina ?
this makes me so happy
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Direct starts @ 29:49
intro 0:00 começo 7:00
Starts at 29:50.
Starts at 29:50
The start 29:49
This going to be best 2d Mario of all time and the weirdest!❤
I’m still curious about the bosses.
Shortest 46 minutes of my entire life, I was convinced it lasted like 10-15 minutes, that's how WONDERFUL the game is
⚠yoshi riding another yoshi
The Direct is super phenomenal!!!! And i knew Blue Toad would be playable! There's a 90% chance ill get this game!
This is perfect. The BEST Mario 2d game is oficial here. I’m realy exited to play this game.
I’m so ready for this game when it’s out!
This game looks incredible and I can’t wait to get it! I especially love it since it’s differentiating from the previous 2D New Super Mario Bros games. Also did anyone else notice that Hoppycats are essentially just Spiny Skipsqueaks as they are both spiky enemies that jump when the player jumps?
They gave Mario a grappling hook, the Dunk will be pleased.
ofc people are dissapointed haha
The flagpoles finally make sense!!
@29.58 is when it actually starts
"I wonder what Goombas taste like..."      -Cursed Talking FlLower
Video starts at 29:49
For anyone watching after the streams ended. Video starts here 29:50.
THE GOAT BLUE TOAD IS HERE ‼️‼️‼️
29:49 is where it starts You're welcome
Nintendo epically fails at understanding multiplayer once again.
Video starts at 29:49
JUSTICE FOR BLUE TOAD HAS BEEN SERVED
Wow, bot much?
Talking flower guy: I wonder what goombas taste like lol
Now I know what elephant peach and toad look like now lol  The internet memes is going to have field day with this lol
For anyone who’s late like me 29:50
30:28 can we just agree that bowser's music absolutely SLAPS
You could say it was wonder-ful
Starts at 29:50
This is probably the best looking 2D Mario game, and people are still complaining, classic. The last one I thought was good was the first New Super Mario Bros. on DS. Not even a big fan of 2D Mario, but I'm totally getting it.
NABBIT!!?!!?!??
for anyone looking for the start of the direct, it starts at 29:50 lol
so a wonder flower is basically a psychedelic that's gonna send you on a trip lol
There's so much Mario goodness to look forward to! So many more features that Nintendo surprised us with, im even more hyped now!!!
This looks like an absolute banger of a mario game but ill be the one to say it, this direct could've been more then just mario. Does nintendo just not have anything else for us to see right now?
This is going to be unbelievable, what a weird year for some good games!
That Is WONDERFUL Nintendo!! Thank you for the 2nd trailer Nintendo😃
29:50
29:50
I cannot wait to play this when it comes out. What makes this even more special is that it comes out 3 days after my birthday as well
ALA GOLD IS BACK!
They did my boy yoshi dirty why is he a nabbit
It starts at 29:49

All I could think about in this direct was "damn, Super Mario Maker 3 is going to be awesome
THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUTTON.                            not the like the reply button👇
starts at 29:49
This really does have 30 mins of nothing with 15 mins of gameplay?
Bowser is the castle, never expected that twist.
Video starts @29:50
THERE'S SO MUCH VARIETY IN PLAYSTYLE, imagine how speedruns of this game are gonna look with Badges
This game has no business to look this good!
This was amazing.
Elephant Peach? I'm sure nobody will ever draw anything disturbing of that.
I WONDER how the fandom takes on the elephant form
Elephant Peach and Elephant Daisy! Yoshi riding Yoshi!  Dogs and cats living together!  I love it!
Deviant Art  is going to have a fleld day with Elephant Peach and Daisy.🤢🤮🐘
29:50
Wonderful!
how can nintendo be this tone deaf, was gonna buy myself and friends 4 copies of this game, and then they reveal there is no online coop, instead i can see 50 other people i absolutely dont care about on my screen and only see my friends shadows with no interactions. After 3d World had such great online coop as well, super disappointed
This will be the best 2D Mario for a WHILE. The 2D Mario series really needed a bigger cast of characters, more items and unique concepts, and Nintendo delivered.
The same day as spider man 2 I’m a PlayStation and Nintendo gamer❤️💙
29:49 starts here
29:50 !!
Nintendo, you made a mistake. Elephant peach is gonna ruin the internet for the next couple weeks.
Woah. This game hasn’t even been RELEASED yet and I can already say, this just might be my NEW favorite Super Mario game!
This is worth the 11 year wait for a new 2d mario (Blew everything I expected out the window)
He turned himself into a castle. Funniest sh!t I've ever seen.
This feels like DLC for Mario Maker 2
I'm so hyped for a possible elephant bowser!
Every thing I WONDER about this game comes true❤ wow Nintendo really put some work and effort into this
YESSSSS
Video starts at 29:50
Yoshi riding other yoshi 10/10

This is insane. 10/10 direct, I am speechless with how they integrated online play, this is like 3D World but better! I loved 3D World!

I really love the direct Nintendo but I wish you show Wario and Waluigi as playable characters to as well maybe as dlc or something in future or maybe show them later if you could add them and maybe even Rosalina as well great Direct❤ thumbs up 👍
waluigi is not in. wtf did we do to you nintendo.
Nabit!
This look good
Not hype but I'll buy it
EVERYONE IS HERE!
W Nintendo direct
I love that they incorporated badges from Paper Mario into the mainline games. Almost makes me forgive them for driving the series off a cliff. Almost.
The narrator's voice gives me the feeling of being in the lobby of some island resort. A big screen near by explaining all the enjoyable sights to see and activities to have.
This a natural evolution of 2d Mario, with the magic touch that only Nintendo has
When is the next direct bruh
well that was something
41:44 Mario kart is canon??
Mario  Maroi  Maroid  Matroid  Metroid  METROID!  That was a great direct about metroid Prime 4!  (Sobs uncontrollably)
29:50 for those who want to rewatch
Man they were trying their hardest not to make another New Super game weren't they
At first I was a bit bummed by the 80% of the characters playing the same, but the badge system definitely rectified that if you wanna try to do level runs with the "classic" abilities of Luigi, Peach & Toad. Honestly this whole direct really surprised me at how lively and chaotic the game is shaping up to be.  Really gels with that news bit awhile ago at Mario Wonder actually being a rather difficult game by Mario standards. 10/20 can't come fast enough.
OH MY GOD THAT WAS THE BEST! I LOVE HOW THE BUBBLE FLOWER IS NOW CANON TO THE MARIO UNIVERSE!!!!
29:50 is when it starts :)
Yoshi having an underbite and both princesses in their elephant forms is extremely cursed and will take time to get used to.
i cant believe they made deviant art canon
I WONDER if I will ever see her again ...
Finally Daisy is playable instead of spin off
Mario franchise never disappoints!!! Unfortunately the same cannot be said about Pkmn...
So who here is surprised that they are excited for Elephant Mario? Who here is excited to shut Elephant Daisy in a closet and never speak of her again?
oh 35:28 i saw a FPS drop for a moment
This game is going to be very good!
AMAZING COMORADE
Deviant art bouta have a field day after watching this one 💀
“I wonder what Goombas taste like...“ - random talking flower from the Super Mario Bros Wonder direct  These are words I will live by
If this would've came out on the Wii ir GameCube, it'd hands-down be one of the greatest games of all time.  But only WITH Charles-san and Miyamoto-san working on it.  I hope at least Tezuka-san is involved.
The game looks fantastic, the switch really ugly
I got to get people to play this with cause this is finally the time to play online Side note- This made me Smile
excited baby
29:51... nothing like all that wait for a 15-minute video
This years truly has so many great games
WOWIE ZOWIE
This was an Amazing Direct, Super Mario Wonder is gonna be a Fun and Wonderful game. Like the expressions on all the characters and animations, had me Surprised seeing Nabbit return and so many features added. Definitely can't wait to play this Game!
BANGER❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
Its was no point turning in to an elephant when mario can always break blocks🙄
You really dropped the ball on this roster. Literally just the same as the last 2D Mario but now with Peach and her annoying clone. No Wario, no Rosalina, none of the interesting characters are here. All of them playing the same is a letdown too.   Apart from that the game looks pretty good.
Yoshi on Yoshi is insane 🤣
31:23 game trailer starts here
why this actually look good
The perfect 10/10 game better than new super mario bros
Please Nintendo don’t turn me into an Elephant!
I love this game and I haven’t even played it❤❤❤
Special moves will be MANDATORY for this game. This one will be harder than all of the other games combined, including Mario Sunshine.
YOSHI ON YOSHI ACTION IS REAL
I'm So Excited!!!
ESTE JUEGO VA A SER EPICO
Starts at 29:50
43:53 Uh-oh there’s gonna be slowdowns. Get ready for the Mario Maker 2 online treatment people. WOOOO!!!
What a direct! The fact that Mario's friends turned themselves into an elephent and Mario isn’t the only one shows that Nintendo knows exactly what they're doing.
PLEASE let us turn off talking flowers
This is going to be the best Mario game to every exist. Badges,new powerups,wonder flowers, and much more makes this game looks super duper amazing! I *wonder* if it has more waiting for us when we actually start playing!
Yeah I'm getting this
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, SO MANY CHARACTERS LEVEL IDEAS AND POWER UPS I KOVR SUPER MARIO AAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
Hoppycats are like skipsqueaks
They really went above and beyond for this game, all the new stuff they have on top of it looking and sounds so beautiful. Never been so excited for a 2d Mario game. 💫
This is gonna be an amazing game
starts at 29:50
Can't wait for this. As a new soup simp, this is amazing
The variety of abilities is what's convincing me to play this game
Can’t wait for this game to come out, this is going to be a fun time. *Wonder* what other features are in this.
This game is JAMPACKED with wonderful new ideas
i bought the regular switch mario edition 2 years ago in feb 21, then the oled model of mario edition comes 2 years later bro 💀💀💀
Starts at 29:51
Mario is so much more quiet
WOWIE ZOWIE that was so WONDERFUL!!! Can’t wait for Mario Wonder!!!
ELEPHANT TOAD LOOKS SO SILLY
The 2nd asynchronous Strand Type game.
This might be game of the year 💯
My jaw was on the floor the entire time, this game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play!
This was pretty much just an extended overview of the game, but that still doesn’t take away from my anticipation of Wonder itself. Excited for the grand return of good ol’ 2D Mario platforming!
Badges super Mario rpg reference
So good
I'll finally play as the best Mario girl daisy I can't wait I'm gonna play this game daisy hot princess daisy mommy mommy DAISY PRINCESS.
That was a really fun direct, and I can’t wait to save this for Christmas. Nintendo put a lot of heart and soul in this project
29:51 is when the actual direct begins
Bowser don't kidnap a princess peach again look like super mario 3d world
The best mario game in the entire world.
Mario fans, we are so BACK!
I missed it live ;-; Why is everyone so cute in this style aaaaa (Bowser not so much but eh) I'm so excited for this game!!! There's so many playable characters!!! I can't wait to play as Daisy! I love the difficulty indicators. I also wonder (haha) if this'll be an extra mode in Mario Maker (One can dream I guess lol) My only complaint is that "wowie zowie" is gonna get old real quick lol 37:53 Mario when the mushrooms start kicking in: So, mario maker online but hopefully without the extra lag and we can't throw each other
Badges... c'mon why don't you just hit me right where it hurts.
w stream
never thought i'd see the day where my girl toadette transforms into a mushroom, holy CRAP
This will, without a doubt, be the greatest 2D Mario Bros. game of all time.
MY BOI LUIGI  HE’S DEFINITELY MY PICK EVERY SINGLE TIME
38:32 he didn’t watch the super Mario super show 😔
This is awesome! A large roster of characters, new power ups, new enemies, new features to improve by going out to any course and choosing any course you want is phenomenal. Even better, you can ride Yoshi with another Yoshi!
W
starts at 29:50
I love this so so so much
Bowser METAL 🤘🏼
A real pity Wart not coming back anytime soon.
I love how many people kept saying every character was gonna get their own unique animal transformation only for it all to be elephants lmfao
I am very excited for this game and the Mario Red - Nintendo Switch OLED console! Yahoo! 🍄
This is what every mario bros game should be like this is what we needed the most
This was the first time I was in a Nintendo live chat and everyone was happy except maybe the TOTK direct
A real pity Wart not coming back anytime soon.
29:50 The start of the Direct
I know they revealed a LOT but I think it’s safe to say that something even bigger is in store
Mario is based.
I’m so glad we finally get a modern “reboot” of the 2D Mario games, this looks really promising. I can’t wait to play this game when it comes out!
Amazing. I will definitely play this game
I sense a disturbance in the force, as if millions of fetish artists suddenly reached for their pencils at once
The Mario Galaxy of 2D mario's
I wanna play as Daisy!! ^^
Elephant Peach and Daisy is something funny we need!!!!
Cant wait for this
Now Nintendo please put this in Mario Maker 2 or 3
the entire video being amazing except for the new switch reveal at the end 💀💀💀💀
This looks SO creative! THIS is what 2D Mario has been missing with the NSMB series. The first game was incredibly creative too but all the rest that followed it barely did anything new
hot       hot
Pepsi...Pepsi...Pepsi...Pepsi...Pepsi...
have online mode good job !!
Incredible what they showed. This game honestly looks a huge step up from previous 2D Mario games.
Starts at: 29:51
This looked simply amazing! I‘m buying this game!
Yayyyy
YOSHI WITH YOSHI'S ISLANDESQUE MECHANICS IN A 2D MARIO GAME?! WHAT?!??
I am HYPED for this game, but could someone please count how many times the elephant power up was shown in this video? Because if im right, it was shown (AND MENTIONED) a lot. …Also, what is with the NEW ENEMIES AND SOME OF THE WONDER FLOWER SCENES?
E6 is going to have a field day with this.
I cant wait bro
WHY SO MANY MECHANICS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ICE FLOWER AND THE TANOOKI SUIT I'M SO DONE
When I saw Peach get stuck momentarily, Ohhhhh boy, you know what the internet is about to do.
I Am Going To Pre Order Both The Game And The Nintendo Switch Oled Model Mario Red Edition 😎
i want this in my wii u
So good. I can’t wait till the game is here.
Actually the most peak game I’ve seen in a while
Direct starts 29:50
I’m hype
Wow, what a game! It looks like a Wonder...full experience.
The new design of the Qled is the same of mario oddysey 💀💀
cool
Best game ever
I’ve been waiting for a new 2d Mario for years. Glad this doesn’t look disappointing
Peak mario platforming. I have no idea how they'll top this
Grappling Vine is the meta
Pretty cool direct! Excited for the full game ^^
I thought Bowser would transform into something more weird and less threatening. Like a butterfly or a unicorn
The difference in the expressions the characters give and the animations they have in this game compared to the New Super Mario games is like night and day, this game looks wonderful
Man that Mario OLED is tempting. Must resist for Switch 2.
Same mechanics
I really want this game
they put a lot of time into this game which is great plus the red oled switch omg
WOWEE ZOWEE!
I LOVE IT
This game looks so WONDERful ! Cant wait to play it !
Blue Toad is in as well as Toadette and Nabbit. Truly pleased everyone with this addition. Especially people who are bad at platformers with those badges and the help you can get in CO-OP online. That will also result in some cheese and more ways to kill and troll each other too.
No demo🗿
Can’t wait for its release.
Direct begins at 29:56
While I am sad that Yoshi did end up being an easy-mode character, I'm extremely happy about everything else Nintendo has managed to accomplish while making this game. This is truly the Super Mario Odyssey of 2D Mario.
Peak gaming content
start at 29:49
Wowie zowie
why does nintendo always make us wait 26 - 33 minutes just for a simple direct to start. this didn’t start until 30 minutes in 💀
WONDERFUL AS ALWAYS NINTENDO!!!
The art style and the wonder flower concepts feels really fresh, and I"m GENUINELY excited for the global online play. CANT WAIT  for OCTOBERRRRRRR  💀
Wish they showed more bosses but other than that this looks peak
So excited to play this game!!!
Best Super Mario Bros ever
THE Best 2d Mario, For now.
I like how daisy yelled WOWIE ZOWIE
Artists are having a field day rn  also who let clodsire in this game
An INCREDIBLE REVIVAL of 2D Mario definitely getting this game at launch
This is so cool! A 2D Mario game that's actually new.
iqoqoooqooqo
Nintendo cooked here and I already can't wait for September to end so we could play this game
Cant wait for release!
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
absolute goated game there were so much great things about this, all the wonder effects, online, mario oled switch and heck, even BLUE TOAADDDD BABYYYYY
Gonna secure my preorder soon
So amazing! I can't wait for the game!
Wow! With the number of power ups and abilities that they added, this game will be a blast.
THIS WILL 100% BE THE BEST 2D MARIO EVER
I can't for this game to come out It going to be so fun!!!!
I have been waiting for over 5 years for a new mainline Mario game to come out. Im so glad that it looks amazing and that it was worth the wait
This was so awesomeee, I'm really happy daisy is playable >.< and seeing the balloon power up being back is legendary
DRY BONES
RIDE YOUR FRIENDS!!!
I’M GETTING THIS GAME DAY ONE!!! 🤩🤩🤩
fire stream, it was peak
I’m very exited for this game!!!!!!!
I absolutely love how Mario's eyes look at the next platform he's about to jump on, and all the different expressions the characters make depending on their situation. Nice little detail! Day one purchase for me!
Rosalina should also be there in the DLC
TOADETTE!!! Thank you Nintendo!
W mario game 🤑
I can already imagine the elephant peach and daisy art
Hype gang 👇
I did not expect the other characters to turn into elephants too i thought they would turn into different animals
This is gonna be the greatest mario game ever once it releases... I don't care what anyone else says :)
Excited to play the game!
That was an amazing direct for Super Mario Wonder. So much new content and I'm super excited to play it ❤
it was amazing! I didn't expect online feature would be this good. it's gonna be an amazing game playing with your friends!
Hi Nintendo I have a new game for 2025 in April make Super Mario bros Ultra cause here’s a plan: make Mario use mushroom 2x and when you use mushroom 2x you can grow bigger and bigger! And there’s 4 more characters to add 1 is Mario 2 is yoshi 3 is Luigi 4 is peach and 5 is toad

The stream was good i really enjoyed it and i would recommend getting it!
Shut up and take my money!
Mario Wonder feels a bit like Mario Land, but better.
I wanted elephant Yoshi for some reason
Looks really good, only complaint is that it may wind up being too easy.
11 years was a long time to wait. It was worth it.
THIS GAME IS GONNA BE PEAAAAK!! SONIC SUPERSTARS ON THE 17TH AND MARIO WONDER AND SPIDERMAN2 ON THE 20TH WE UPPPPP!!!!
WOOHOO DRILL POWERUP IS BACK

I was hoping that this would be the video that they talked about with Miyamoto and Charles Martinet explaining the voice situation...
❤
This game is gonna be wonderful!!!
That was weird but totally fun trailer or direct lol.
Super Mario Bros Wonder really is a wonder. Shut up and take my money!
This is going to be one of the best Mario games in a while!
spectacular
Nothing else to say except that this is truly another Massive Mario W

R.I.P Yoshi’s knees.
Upload broke
Sick preview can't wait for its release yah

Amazing!!!! I am so marioing right now!!
😃
The fact that nabbit is actually returning to this game is just amazing, even seeing yoshi return as an actual character  Also, I was hoping for an elephant bowser or smth, but bowser being a massive clown kart castle is just amazing Spending my life savings on the game
😂
