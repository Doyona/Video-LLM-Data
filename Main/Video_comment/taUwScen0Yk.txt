He sounded exactly like your dentist! It was uncanny!
“To clothe all my tapeworms”! I can’t!
Make like ariel and grow legs🤣
that comment about 3% of the wealth really hit hard
be careful showing outside your window girl
Sorry about the TyPiNG but I’ve GOt hiccUPS Edit: crikey your legs are long
OMG ITS JARED LETO!
Get Certified!
Asking to spend the night does not happen very often here.
I’m on the floor dead!!!! I laughed literally so loud I can’t!!! 0:39 😂😂😂😂😂
The skillshare add😂
Your fatal mistake wasn’t sharing your the spelling of your first name.  It was being so stinking adorable that people just couldn’t help but stalk you.  😊
I could really relate to the safety part. When I was working in retail we were told by our Company tgat we should not wear name tags anymore bc so many creeps did search the workers up on Facebook 🤢
Micarah PLEASE make some of Cruella's outfits from live action "101 Dalmatians" or Disney's "Cruella". *THE TRASH DRESS or A (stuffed animal) FUR COAT!!??* I love the idea of thrifting a bunch of stuffed animals, and making a fur coat with them (and would love a tutorial..).    LOVE YOUR CONTENT, YOU'RE AMAZINGGG!!!!
You are my comfort show
i would absolutely adore to get beginning basic sewing tutorials from ur pov...skillshare collab?
I almost burned my rice THREE TIMES while watching your videos
So I remember looking at this apartment when I was browsing
Why you were not allowed to watch Narnia when it's literally a Christian movie
I wanna start clothing my tapeworms too haha 😂
I know this video is ten months old at this point, but as someone else who also has an extremely rare and identifiable first name/surname combo, I fully get it. You can very easily find a lot of info about me with that, which is why I never give both away. Individually, they're both rare names, but together, I am literally the only person in the universe with this name...which is cool and daunting and why there have been a lot of efforts by me to keep as much info off the internet as I can and to semi-regularly google myself and make sure I am not accidentally doxxing myself in new and unfortunate ways. Like that time I put my full name into a Bebo page that was a "band" page for my friend group and then was just filled with comments of my friends falling out with me and asking me to remove them from the group and me just stubbornly not. And that was up for over a decade after, even though I deleted (it went deactivated) my Bebo account because there was apparently one friend over a decade later who still used Bebo who I was no longer in contact with which meant that the page stayed up on the first page of google if you searched my full name. You just got a group of teenage girls saying why they hated me.  so yeah I try to not do things like that anymore
tldr micarah has a gun and she will protect her bird
I feel like you and Doja Cat could be great friends
from modern Manhattan apartment to victorian out the way mansion 😌
Who needs drawers with a desk thay cool 👌🏻
WAIT! They still have games on the Barbie website??? *_virtually runs_*
4:15 this hole thing was hilarious but I couldn't stop repeating this part 😂😂😂
15:17 is this why I found lemons on my balcony that one time
idk why but giving some real hilary duff vibes?? love it : >   (specifically the "office tour" moment where you opened the curtain charmingly : >)
14:39 im sorry i laughed so loud at the thats kinda ugly part
i’ve been saving up micarah videos  for winter break and am now all out. sigh back to the beginning
I get people being worried about your safety,  but what they're forgetting is you aren't a child. You're a full-grown adult who knlws what they're doing, and if you don't,  you have people around you who knows what they're doing.
If every person was like her, the world would be a happier place! 🤓
New subscriber. You are hilarious!
random but it's kinda funny that you weren't allowed to watch narnia as a child when it's filled with christian themes and parallels, like one of the characters is quite literally jesus 😭
I love you! But I've also learned the hard way watching this video that drinking alcohol and then watching your video on 1.5x speed is a bad combo. Hope you love New York!
11:01 This completely killed me 🤣🤣🤣 I had to pause the video and wait until I had stopped laughing 😂
You're PSA is so good ❤
you are a SCREAM! I wish I found you sooner! Absolute treasure! Thank you for existing
Is it just me or was that the sonic the hedgehog theme song at the end? Anywho i love your content Micarah! God bless you and keep you 🙏
Calling it, the throw off shots were of the Victoria mansion we didn’t know she owned yet 😂 which is honestly brilliant A+ manipulative misdirection Micarah
Your editing is so chaotic and it scratches my brain in the BEST way! I'm sorry people comment nonsense and not just "you're amazing! Keep being you!" Cause that's clearly the only comment that's relevant to these Oscar worthy videos
Now all I can imagine is elaborate home alone traps Micarah sets up every night before bed as her “unknown security measures”
Thanks for the laughs I am sick and you made me smile and laugh 🫶
As someone with an unusual first name... this is why I use a fake name when I meet new people (read: men) that I don't trust straight away.
I love how many times you mentioned Victorian houses in this video. It was like you subconsciously knew. Or consciously. Who knows.
NYC will open opportunities for you and give you a great life
I feel like I need her to do a collab with best dressed now that shes in NY, their energies are so different yet so similar?? (yes I know shes been off youtube.. I can dream tho)
You are a very odd young lady. Its wonderful
How fast can you speak? Micarah: Yes :D
I doubt that I'm the first person to bring this up, but I really hope that the sponsors realize how much effort you put into your ads to make people actually be entertained by watching them.  Being here for 10 seconds and scrolling down once - yep no doubt, everyone likes your ads. Nice job, Micarah.
Evil Bunny jajajaa
Its kinda crazy that she wasnt allowed to watch Narnia growing up, yet in my school it was a mandatory book we have to read and do a book report about! Idk what her parents were sheltering her about...but whatever they did they raised a very cool daughter lol i ❤ Micarah!
Wait her brother plays in my favorite band!? HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
You can avoid this by buying property with a trust
That sewing desk table upcycle was one of the best diys I've ever seen
This was sooooo NOT a useless video… 💕
YOUR SO COOL THE 🌎WORLD IS CHANGING BE HAPPY And positive, for what you Think and manifest,, becomes your reality,,,,,,,, 🐢💨
I admire your fearless authenticity and tenacity.  It encourages me to do the same ❤
I've never related more....... "I just want my clutter to match"  And i also aim for a visually pleasing flow to the clutter.  Yes, let's make those half dozen ginger ale bottles waiting to be rinsed for recycling that have been there for four weeks look cohesive in the space 😉
you don't like the greatest showman :o do you like la la land though
I am a non-native, I watch the channel for fun and practice my listening skill, this is super fast English speaking LOL.
I've watched a chicken eat out of your mouth and I've seen how high you can kick. You're safe lol
I have a very rare first name and last name combo, so I understand how easily people are able to find you. Im rarely on social media (if I am I don’t give my real last name) but have also run into some issues in the past. It really is futile, all you can do is be prepared.
what about your house 😭😭😭
Glowing glossy glow up
<3 ill love you forever and always stay safe and go visit the british candy shop on lex and 97th. <3
WHERE IS GARRIAN😭😭😭😭💔
👋 Hello Micarah the findable.  Sincerely Elya the findable.   There is no way to hide 😑 thanks mom.
Haha it's so amusing to watch, thank you for the tour!
Micarah security is a chicken. Every night she borrows one if JJ’s chickens just to watch her sleep. It also helps with separation from gerion.
That lampshade she painted was stunning: should think about selling them.  Seriously.
Anyone can find you without even trying. Facebook suggested my bus driver one day.... Yep..
Zacchaeus! Lol!
I’ve always wanted to move to ny but I’m broke
i was about to skip the ad break but i just enjoy watching you so i stayed lol. every company should take note and want to pay you money because you make good content
I forget, did you sell your house? Or do you still have it?
☠️😂😭🤣
I thought my screen was dirty and I kept scratching the dot during the PSA. The I realized Micarah had a dot on HER wall! Lol I felt silly
I love how each video is micarah slowly losing her grip on sanity
I’m genuinely so happy for Micarah living life on her own terms and getting to meet all these wonderful and diverse people in NYC
This is so specific but the "not allowed to watch narnia as a kid but never wound up watching it as an adult" speaks to me so much. Anyway, in terms of thrifty stuff... have you tried Savers / Value Village / whatever it's called in your area? I get GREAT kitchen goods there, and they almost always have coffee makers, just be sure to clean them VERY well. But it ought to be a lot cleaner than the side-of-the-road ones! Just be careful if they try to tell you they're a charity. They're not.
You are so creative.  You should be much more well known!
Nyc doesn’t deserve you!!! 😂😂😂 For realz, it’s a place where you can either thrive or die in, having true friends is important there.❤
all i could think about this whole time was that she should calab with @haileyybaylee they both are so funny and both are in new york nowwww soooooo. they are both my favoritesss <33333
I'M CONFUSED...why did she move?
You should just get a Murphy bed and use the loft for storage
Ok this is creepy. I have the EXACT same polka dot pink blouse, that was passed down to me by my mom who wore it on the 80s. This is so cool😭😭 it looks so good on me but I'm  too shy to wear it cause of the POOFED sleeves 😂😂 (mine are extra poofed)
It’s actually so crazy how much that guy sounded like your dentist
Where is Gareon? Does she have to be separated from her bird? 😢
One of the rarest youtuber’s I don’t have to worry about, Micarah is just so pure 🥹
Help hopescope
It's so sad you have never seen Narnia😢 Especially since a Christian movie. That was like my childhood!
“Hello New Yorkers. I fit right in” Somehow she’s already a strereotypical New Yorker
A studio in Greenwich village?? I'm scared of what her rent must be..
1000 pounds of oxygen costs over $8,870 dollars
lol i live in nyc and i can personally confirm i have no intention to look up ur location"" cause 1. i have my own life. 2 isnt there other things to do/ u do realize every resi reservation you've ever made has this? and 3. there's no point looking for someone i can see online any time i wish 🤣😂lol great talk!
Very amusing and also made me queezy by the hyperbolic
What happened to your house
with you I don't even skip through the adds 🥺
You weren't allowed to watch the movie adaption of the most Catholic fairy tale ever?
watching your videos is like a more relatable version of devil wears prada x barbie, i'm obsessed with the 70 outfit changes per video (also i'm loving that top you have in the safety psa parenthesis) and once again you make me want to sew but i'm lazy so i'll probably just go thrift shopping again
...or some other 3rd thing
A big cork mat could be rolled out on the sewing table to pin patterns down to- oh wait, it's Micarah's channel, I suppose it would have to be a Barbie canoe
i cant wait for your inspirations after the barbie movie!
That lady with the Edna hair was awsome
This was 100% NOT a waste of time Micarah! Thanks so much for making such wonderful fun videos! I loved the sun comment, "You disgusting little sloth! Sleeping outdoors, in my presence!? Get up!!!" Because honestly, i felt that. I work late and dont get home til 2am sometimes, so i sleep late.
I like grandpa JJ marry him
Micarah, please don’t let the big apple change you! Stay pure, stay positive! I know moving can be hard and it comes with challenges but don’t let it way you down!
Im sorry that you wete experiencimg pain im your old house idk what happened but wishing you the best 😢
Lord I hope she used CG for the window view
last time i saw her she was living in rv and then in a full house and now an apartment?? girl how
I just realized Shes wearing the speak now dress she made❤
I have just realised that where my brain should be is a Micarah like world..
So when she started talking about having safety measures that she couldn't talk about my instant thought was "OMG, Micarah is secretly a superhero!" AND THEN SHE STARTED JOKING ABOUT SUPER POWERS TO THROW US OFF TRACK. Very sneaky, Micarah.
You are everything I want to be. amazing vlog! :)
How many homes does she have
12:52 Factssss
what was the price??
i dont know how people live in new york its like a prison state i mean new york used to be ok to live there but now its worse then the 70s and 80s new york but i suppose if you got money you might like it but even still the place is just trying to take away ever freedom it can
16:20 lmao
I am suddenly *possessed* by a need for a sparkly crop with the bell sleeves. Did you make that?
That desk is amazing, Ikea could never
I really want to buy a projector now! That’s so cool! I love your apartment!
The Narnia stories? Really? I understand you were sheltered but they're literally all Christian allegory and some of the most innocent and wholesome literature out there XD
i don’t have unique names separately thank goodness but i DO have a unique name put all together (i have 2 last names lol) and that means i am the only person with my name and also probably pretty dang easy to find
NOT ONE OF MY CLASSATES LITERALLY BEING IN UR VIDEO AT THE END 😭😭 i suppose it makes sense tho bc we ARE fashion students in new york. the pieces sort of align that he’d also be at the met
This video wasn't useless - it was fun! I love all your videos.
WAIT CAN YOU ACTUUALLY DO 73 QUEstions VOGUE STYLE PLEASE
LOL “it feels like I live in a big Victorian mansion but I’m  only allowed to go into ONE room”… ::continues to prance and twirl up the stairs::: —— YESSS ! That’s how I felt when I first moved to DC. 😂♥️ I’m glad I’m not the only one who felt like that 💃🏻
Omg, leave her alone :/
Your such a sweet little country mouse, I love it!❤❤
TOCOTOCOTO🗣‼ 13:52
not to derail, great video! i realize its been 3 weeks but your keurig may just need to be demineralized  and you can buy a kit to do it (or it could be broken fr idk but thats what happened to my grandmas)
Story Time.
I love it, so glad for you and your adventure
This is my favorite John Hughes film
Oh my gosh I didn’t know people were so crazy and stalkers! Like LEAVE MICARAH ALONE!
When she first started talking about safety I thought "she's not going to fall off her balcony." Ah naive  me... The joys of not being a well known person, and also not living in NY, or America..
The part where you pick up your shoe with your feet while at the park is my favorite 😂😂🎉 love your videos.
Micarah, I have just finished binge watching all your videos for like the past week. I think you are up there with the best content on YouTube. You have such a lovely personality and I just want to be your friend ☺️. The new apartment is beautiful! So excited to see what you create next! 💕
"You're incompeten- You're entitled to compensation!"
I like your clothes.
Please help hopescope :)
What is actually wrong with people that you have to put a disclaimer to please not find you. Geez, I'm sorry girl.
will miss the rv, but so excited for your new adventure!
Your apartment is a Doll House! So excited to see your new adventures! That little bird is going to miss you ❤ Sending love from your home town ❤
you know she's talented when you get excited for her to talk about her sponsor 🤣
it’s not even the fact people can find you it’s the way you’re making it easier
Nice Apartment.
She's so gentle to my ADHD 😄
It’s silly that we are conditioned to be so afraid of each other meanwhile the biggest threat we face is the government but no one mentions that. Seriously, when was the last time one of your creepy neighbors stole one third of your salary and thanked you by unleashing a bioweapon that he used your money to cook up in his laboratory? 😂
Ya I agree that guy sounded just like your dentist
Please start interviewing more New Yorkers 😂🫶🏻
I’m so proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and experiencing life from a new lens. May God bless your healing process. I’m a huge fan and I’m always inspired to be authentic when I watch your videos ❤❤
She gets it
for some reason, despite having watched your videos for a year or so now, i had no idea you (formerly) lived in ohio! i'm an ohioan so it just came as a shock. i wish you all the best in new york :)
So jealous!!! I hope you have a great time in New York!
don't get sunburnt on ur balcony!!
Micarah I love your apartment!!! It’s so nice 😁😁 I love your bedroom and your way of getting up in the morning and I am an evening person definitely 😂
Such a fun experience! Bucket lists are made of these, who are we to disagreeeee... And sorry to hear about the privacy reminder. Like mama says: Believe in good people but lock your doors ⭐️
Had to stop watching. Made me feel nauseous from how fast it was moving from one thing to the other.
love your videos !
Your videos always bring a smile to my face. I have been having a bit of an identity crisis lately, and have decided to focus more on making things with my own hands instead of "climbing the corporate ladder". I feel like your content has made me more sure of what kind of life I want to have 😊 What you do is very important 😊 (Sorry if my English seems a bit clumsy, its not my first language)
Girl are you ok with all the bad air quality in New York right now?
You are so funny, I love watching you! The part with the workout and the roulade👌👌👌
Hows the air there
The outfit changes in this video are truly amazing. I love the kitchen fit especially and the before bedroom fit was perfect barbie energy I love it all so much
Me: How many outfit changes were in this video? Micarah: Yes
As a man who watches, I’ve always been drawn to your editing and creativity, including your creativity in editing.  You’re authentic with skills.  And potato.
Okay but like y’all should’ve stormed the met 👀
They should’ve casted you for Barbie 😩💖
She's Amazing woman
omg I love your apartment it looks so cosy <3
The hypothetical tapeworm garments took me more off guard than I think they should have
that customised sewing table is sick! i love personalised stuff - life hacks make everything easier
Josh is a massive improvement on the 73 Questions guy. Eat your heart out, Vogue.
lol I used to live in unit #A for 6 months before I was asked to leave. Landlord doesn't play 😑
MICARAH HEAR ME OUT: you need Mr. Kate to collab with you on your apartment. I know that you're in a very transitional period of life and having someone talented who loves diy-ing as mush as you could make your new space feel like home.
off topic but the PSA makeup look was just so good
Help hopescope😆
Hiq
Props to Camera Josh
Micarah you are a delight.
I love your content! I hope you know that Jesus sees you and loves you! Hold on to him and let him lead you in New York! ❤❤❤❤
look at micarah living out her dreams!
Fun fact: The term Freelancing actually does come from the middle ages and their lancers. It was a word used to describe lancers who would offer their services in exchange for payment.
Micarah!!! Please, please, please make the Cruela trash dress!!!
Yes he sounded like your dentist
Cute apartment! Keep on living your best life! Also, just want to say that in the safety portion of the video, I LOVE that shirt you're wearing. It's beautiful and looks so comfortable
Your amazing!!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤.  So funny ! X
If I would put my scissors under the table like that I would be constantly cutting my legs XD but desk idea is still great :)
I just visited the place I want to move to and I'm inspired by u queen
When Micarah say she has safety measures, I imagine her having Scooby-Doo type traps. Trap doors under welcome mats,  trip wires, all that,  haha!
Evil Rabbit lmaooo
*after the safety bit* so what I'm hearing is your apartment is booby trapped
Micarah should be in the new Barbie movie
that one guy in the crowd at the met has a point lol
this appartment looks exactly like bestdressed Ashley's old NY appartment
I mean i get that it's not her/your (it's weird how i can't figure out which tense to use here lol) most favourite part to speak on as it crosses the meta twice. But I'm fascinated by the part where she briefly spoke on not living in fear. As that's what I'm hoping to work towards. I come from a very different part of the world and life, but I've been watching a long time and always enjoyed the winky-meta humour to her/your tomfoolery pretending like this is all a mess when it's obviously a lot of work you've put in, and i guess a peek behind the curtain that yes, you've got street smarts and have figured out how to live as freely as you can under these confines we all operate under as girls is like, 🅰️➕fascinating stuff.
I lived in Denmark for awhile in the 90's (my parents were missionaries there...so I also was homescooled and not allowed to watch a lot of the things you mention not being allowed to watch) You could get brand new things out of the dumpsters behind stores(they had some weird laws about selling slightly damaged items).
can you make live action ariels pink dress please?
Ugh I feel you on the safety!! People truly don't have to warn us, like.. WE KNOW. It's giving 'women don't know how badly men talk to each other about women' - as if we are not victims of their actions, as if the way we move in public is not centered around our fear and safety from them. We don't have to know the exact words they use to know we're in constant potential danger in this society.  People need to realize how it feels getting these warnings. It frames us as being naïve about our own safety, it makes us feel more scared and limited than we already are, and it's veering towards victim-blaming because it make it seem like we can prevent ourselves from being harmed. We can't.
16:26 Sorry but I’m I the only one who sees the wrong in this, like it’s the met gala, one of the biggest events in the world, not ur little sisters birthday party, let alone that it was an honor for someone,and as if it wasn’t enough that the celebs ruined what’s going on inside by doing things like never actually following the team and vaping, now the mad haters gonna spread their energy on the outside, OK, like we get it you’re mad hater you don’t have to prove it in an event like that , like it’s really sad that mean many other people were waiting for a whole year just for things like these to happen
i missed you woman
josh keeps you real humbled hehe
Micaesh darling I'm moving to NY in the fall as well and my god, the rent is astronomical there, I get it 😢
that apartment feels like the one from breakfast at tiffany's
Where is Garian this entire video?!!! Show us the bird!!
14:00 i have headphones in I thought there was a bird flapping above me and I panicked & jumped across my bed trying to figure out if there was a bird/bat and why a scary voice was yelling at me for being a disgusting little sloth. still love ya though!
Those end tables are so cool!
None of your videos are useless!! I would watch you for 5 hours straight
HONESTLY, I AM SURPRISED, THAT ENORMOUSLY LONG CURTAINS / DOES NOT DOUBLE AS A  " GREEN SCREEN" /  " BLUE SCREENS. just a thought 💭🤔  🌅⛱️ SUMMER MADNESS 6/4/2023 SUN
There are no other content creators that can get me excited about ads like you 😆
Kills me how many ACTUAL New Yorkers cannot afford to live in a “dream place” like this but you just get to live here for half a year for ✨fun✨
Now you just need to show us them filming Law and Order: SVU & I think your NYC experience would be complete
Thank you for always making me laugh Micarah, have fun living in New York. ❤️
the one thing abt safety in nyc, you are in the worst place if a zombie apocalypse were to happen
Well damn it! 😂😂😂 I can’t believe it! 😂😂😂 That sponsorship section COMPLETELY snuck up on me! 😂😂😂 I didn’t realize what was happening until I was already watching it and by then I was actually invested 😂😂😂 I didn’t even skip! 😂😂😂👏👏👏
I love the tables Your outfits are amazing You made the ad wildly compelling I laughed out loud and made my partner come and watch in your segment about getting free stuff off the street! You're kind of goals 🙃🙃🙃
very sorry people are invading your privacy and making you feel unsafe. that's very very scary 🖤
Your NYC apartment looks like a dream compared to my Brooklyn digs. But I bet you don't have a pet mouse who lives in the walls.
thanks so much for sharing... we really appreciate it xoxoxo I love house tours!!
I don’t know why but I lost it when she yelled “Zaccheus” 😂
Micarah, please be kind to trees.  Kicking their bark off isn't exercise.  It's giving them an injury that can take 15-20 years to heal.  Learn about Olmsted's legacy--Central Park.  Love your work in general.
I love your content so much <3
THAT DESK WAS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFULL!! neeed that in my life as well
1:54 THE BARBIE WEBSITE WAS THE BOMB GROWING UP
2 sq ft…..amazing 😂like a family home in NY. Love your videos, thanks as always for sharing.
My boyfriend looking at the screen: “is that Hilary Duff?”
Please share with us in another video where you have to carry your laundry and TJ's grocery walking down and up all that stairs. Silly out-of-towner.
unrelated but you remind me so much of Lady Miss Kier from Deee-lite!
WHERE IS THE COUCH FROM? its perfect
It seemed pretty good till she go to the bedroom- oh the horror
what tool did you use to cut the cutting track with?
First time that I've seen a psa delivered in lingerie.
Looks like you had some fun at that park lol 😄
I'm so excited for your new adventures
I mean if I ever stalked Micarah, I’d just leave a bag of grapes at her door and call it a day.
You never cease to inspire me Micarah! Keep doing you!!!
Why would anyone live in a 5000.00+ a month sh$#!! Hole? Oh yeah.... Arrogance. Anyways when you snap out of it don't fffffffffu€!π€ move to Florida...... It's full from all you northerners tired of all of the bs.
I love Margot robbie...but I think they should've cast micarah as barbie in the new movie. It would be absolutely perfect !
the vogue 73 questions was impeccable 🥲 you should do a whole video like that
“He is getting paid a thousand pounds of pure oxygen” HAHA I LOVE HER
5:25 I got this far thinking, “how does she talk so fast?” Before I remembered you’re one of the channels I don’t prefer on 1.25 playback speed.  I love people who’s internal tempo is fast like mine.   I wish I could put IRL people on 1.25 speed sometimes.
11/10 🎉
am i tripping or did you just fully dox yourself. it’s not hard at all to find your address now you posted the stair and door there’s not many apartments with this floor plan in nyc. did no one learn from bestdressed stalker
whats the brand of her projector ??????
You're so badass, Micarah. Thank you for the reassurance that you've got things under control though, I'm no longer worried. I like your kitchen outfit.
Girl, get yourself a Barbie taser. You must remain safe if the vids are to continue
YouTube why did I not get a notification for this!!!! 😢😢😢❤❤❤
Holy crap Micarah, Calm down.
You are SO BRAVE???? Like just buying houses, renting apartments, and making permanent changes to things you own?!!!!!??? I aspire to be like 0.00000001% as brave as you, and wowee zowee am I worried that I'll never get there. Um but anyway love the channel, I may be in NYC soon(ish) and I can't wait to exercise in your spacious backyard
The man who asked for drawers is thinking too small. He is wrong. He has no imagination. Drawers mean you cannot see the things inside, and you have to do a minimum of two useless stupid actions to get anything (opening and closing the drawer). Heaven forbid you have to put the thing back. Then you've done four useless pointless actions. Magnet strips and racks > drawers every day of the week. This man has just not been enlightened, you can't really blame the uneducated.
What a lovely video.  I especially adore your AMAZING sewing desk.  I might have to steal some of those ideas!  :)  I wish you all the luck in New York and I hope that people LAY OFF about telling you what to do unless it's suggestions of the next awesome outfit for you to consider sewing!
So no more chicken?
IDK HOW I DIDNT REALIZE UR BROTHER WAS LANDON TEWERS WTF
At this point, if someone doesn’t throw a nice fruit basket on her balcony, I’m flying to New York and doing it myself.
Land mines? The security measure in Ohio has to be land mines
"im micarah tewers, and thats besides the point" is ending me hdgdgdhdgsg
i love that micarah now needs to pay for ny rent so she posts regularly hihihi
Is the top on the mannequin one of those y2k butterfly tops? Cus I sure hope it is
As the years go by, you're just morphing more and more into Barbie and i'm so here for it
Argh you're just so freaking cool ❤❤❤❤
Why weren't you allowed to watch Narnia? When aslan is an  allegory of jesus 😭
Micarah needs to star in a David Lynch film
Where's the bird?
This video made my afternoon, day, night, and month. Hope you’re adapting to the sleep deprivation being in the city that never sleeps! Thanks for taking us to nyc with you
I had to stop listening to True Crime all the time because it was honestly giving me a paranoid mindset throughout life. Yeah, there are evil creeps out there, but they will ALWAYS be there. Do the things we can to protect ourselves and try to enjoy life. <3
Now every time you go outside you can sing the 'Oh Manehattan' song from my little pony
It’s a butterfly shape 🦋
I am so happy you made it to NY. I always envisioned you being in NY since the very beginning 🥲
Was I the only one who didn’t know her brother is in The Plot in You 💀
I have never liked a video for it’s amazing video sponsor plug before…theres a first for everything 😂
Literally, the female experience in a nutshell: “I’m not naïve to danger, I’m more so desensitized to it.”
I’ll be waiting for the video where you tell us that people have started throwing fruit on your balcony. lol 😅🍎🍇🍊
i can't believe that today was the day i learned micarah's brother is literally the lead singer in the plot in you?????
Micarah should of been casted in the new Barbie movie 🤣🤣
So FUN! Yaaayyy that was fun!  So many fun people! I lol ed when you showed your bedroom it felt like a Barbie camper bed 😂 Too bad about that ottoman tho. 🙂🍎
I was rooting for you. But YouTuber in nyc is saturated and uninteresting
Seriously her sponsor messages are the only ones i want to watch
THE BABY HEAD IN THE COUCH
There is literally a movie where Jodi Foster spits grapes on ppl from a NY balcony I'm pretty sure.
Thanks for Addiding to the gentrification of nyc!!!!
I would be so terrified to roll right off that “bedroom” area. *lol*
I love 'useless videos'
Shootin my shot here- if you need friends and wanna grab brunch, lemme know! Can show ya around BK :)
no one is talking about that sewing table?? It is BRILLIANT!!
your videos make my brain happy like chemically on a cellular level... your editing will never be beaten Micarah !!!!!! my brain loves you !!!
btw your gym is a good place to bird watch
Your walk up feels like breakfast at Tiffany’s
YO, I'm pretty sure that pink thing in the crowd at the Met Gala ended up being part of a guerilla theater group piece I saw yesterday in Union Square.
You and your videos never fail to bring me joy! Your sewing table is absolutely blowing my mind!! Totally genius. ❤
yes.
Start carrying!
As someone who lives in nyc, I can feel those door slams in my soul
16:32 FOR REAL
Omg the Barbie chair in your bedroom! I'm a fan!
Micarah, you can always get a goose. Goose make great guard animals.
Laughed so hard, ur work is absolutly amazing <3 can't wait for all ur next adventures in NYC
Guuurrl you mastered all of those many hairstyles. You inspire me to try a few . #stukinarut
The chaotic energy and quick editing and humor fill me with joy!
LOVE THE COUCH MICARAH
I’m so curious. Who is the guy filming her videos? Did I miss something?
The street you live on looks like it’s been in movies. I wouldn’t be surprised if it has. Also that balcony is skinny, are you sure it isn’t just a very structured flower bed?
Wow.  You have a kitchen. And I cringed with horror when you mentioned bedbugs.  So not a good memory.
I wish you were Barbie, in the movie. It is your humor. - City Mouse Country Mouse
I love rich people documentaries❤️
So basically you want to be those snotty kids on the stairways at Sally Moffat's coming out party? I 100% love that for you.
ikr he sounded exactly like your dentist!
I don’t know why YouTube algorithm took me here but she is so funny!
If she doesn't get invited to the premiere of the Barbie movie we riot!
I know you've never done a makeup tutorial but i would love to see one for the smokey eye you did during the safety talk! So stunning!
The desk was worth its own video.  Very nice.  And drawers are just where people put things so they can forget about them until they have to move.
Not grapes please! They’re toxic to doggies. Cute apartment!!
Not only are you super hilarious and fun to watch, you keep it real where it matters and I really respect that! Loved this video and PS... I think you could put IKEA out of business with some of your furniture ideas, just saying.... lol
As a none New Yorker I was lead to believe that no disturbance bothers them and therefore my theory on the grape situation is “steady vibes”
“small” apartment lol I wish my apartment was that small 😭
Hi Micarah! I hope you're doing well. Thanks for the video :)
"Evil rabbit or something" 🤣
Because of my own principals I don't get to watch the Barbie movie so I was super happy to find this again ... wholesome entertainment was what I was hoping to get from both of them but this will do freaking nicely 🙌
Sometimes I get sad because I will never be as genuinely funny as Micarah
How to like more than once this cinematic masterpiece.
I'm glad to she you stretch your wings and fly to a balcony of your own <3 I hope your time in new york will be more fun then scary and I hope you meet lots of interesting new people more than creeps. P.S. I stole the drawers of your sewing desk.
This is my first video of you, I'm loving the chaotic vibe here! Keep it going <3
I’m astonished that she wasn’t allowed to watch at least the first Narnia movie since it is a Christian story by a Christian author 😂
martha freaking stewart
Your outfit in your PSA (the top) is absolutely beautiful. I'm in love...and with your honesty.
Thanks for adding the safety part of the video, not because I think you're naive, but just because you are such a ray of light and that we care about you. ❤
You should be super proud of that sewing desk!! It’s absolutely perfect for YOU! And that’s what counts. I’m proud of you.  Visited New York for thé first time last fall and didn’t want to leave! So happy for you and everything you’re doing. Live the super fabulous, well rounded, creatively fulfilled life for those of us that can’t. ❤❤❤
Micarah is THE ONLY youtuber who sneaks sponsors into her videos and we don't want to skip those parts because they're always witty.  it's actually very impressive.
You look so happy and your new place is great. I like it a lot. I'm happy for you. I was worried when you announced you were moving to New York. I now see you had it all under control and you're just fine in your new home. I think its against the law to have stalkers in New York.
The dress on 6:08 looks so good on you ❤
I’m so happy I got to meet you in person you are amazing
Love your Vids, I won’t stalk you just too lazy
i’m so excited for this new journey of your life. great things are ahead
So fun!! Hope New York is all you need it to be ❤
Beautiful neighborhood! Congrats on your new place. This is huge!! Blessed new chapter for you and yours.
Why were you not allowed to watch Narnia?!!? (I’ve watched it so many times since C.S. Lewis based it off the Bible and we use it for VBS at my church EVERY year)
I think I recognise the last lady voice, shes a barbie collector and has a youtube channel
See the Lion the Witch and the wardrobe it’s good and the only one worth seeing also read the books, Christian Allegory too.
:(((((
Does anyone else 100% want Micarah to go to the Met Gala next year but like legit?
Starry Night is a suicide reference.
<3
Ok, that dude talking about storming the met.. like, my guy, when people are talking about the problematic wealthy.. they are not talking about celebs. They are talking about the fools that own the billion dollar companies, and pay their employees crap, charge us too much for necessities, lobby the government to protect their hinies so they can keep doing awful things to their companies, society and the planet.. They are not talking about movie stars, singers and models. 😵‍💫
Genuine question, when youre traveling or living in different places, how do you keep all of your projects straight? Like, if you have something youre working on in your house, how do you remember to bring all the pieces to NY?
You inspire me to be myself a lot Micarah, I'm going through some tough things in my life now and this video really made me happier and more confident and hopeful about the future. Your comment that it was a useless video was totally untrue - we love to see you and get updates about your life. I wish you'd share a little more about your met gala experience though!
Yeaaah.  I am so going to refer to your vids as "programs" now.  "Gotta catch the new Micarah program." Also, we love snagging neat items from the side of the road.  People chuck out a lot of great things.. just be careful of bugs and such!  🤣
Fr I'd love to wake up outside with sunlight 😭😭💜 always love the vids!
Please, if you haven’t already, go to the NY Ren Faire.  And thanks for the video.
Why does that crowd remind me of district one in the hunger games? 😂
So she's a newywoker now, no but please adopt me tho ,i can't see my future anymore and i want to live on nyc so bad idk why, maybe as your assistant/bff/maid idc i can be anything like im not evern kidding, i don't want to live at my place anymore. 😭
You are a breath of fresh air and I’m an indoor plant in snoop dogs hot box
All the tapeworms that I've ever known like to roll completely in the buff.
Welcome to the neighborhood! I live in the area as well. If it makes you feel any better, plenty celebrities and famous people live in around here. This is NYC -- no one cares. I've often gone to the homes of singers and actors with similar apartments, and they don't think twice about it. Please, try not to feel nervous, and just enjoy your new home :)
Micarah, you're going to LOVE LOVE LOVE fabric shopping in NYC.  I'm not jealous, not one bit.
Micarah your so pretty it’s not far!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤ ps love your videos so much you are the best YouTuber in my books!
how did i not know your brother was the singer in the plot in you? ................................................................................................................................. ?
Hmmm... According to Merriam-Webster, the term "freelancer" comes from a Sir Walter Scott novel: "I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused them—I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find employment."
The "Zacchaeus!"" at the Met Gala was 10/10 biblical humor
when you started to talk about safety, I thought it would be about how the railing of the balcony seems to be really low and as soon as I noticed it wasn't about the railing, I knew that I thought too german because safety concerning creepy strangers was only my second thought
But what‘s wrong with The Greatest Showman?
Do you know how enjoyable is watching this video for this part of your audience which lives on similar amount of space? And it's not some insignificant part as well :D
I know you will find your people in NYC, Micarah🥹
i love the new apartment :)
You'll soon realize that NY is the place and worst place in the world lololol I do hope you enjoy your time there!!!
Can I Learn how to push the subscribe button from skill share
This is such a good video and well edited/directed/scripted!! Love it
I have the same Ikea couch! Love it!
I love your loft/gallery bed thingie, oh and I ALSO recently thrifted a yellow armchair from facebook marketplace
It’s obviously a butterfly top … how does he not know?  Also, my brain might be broken because there’s butterflies, sparkles, a purple dress and you said enchanted so all Icould think of is Micah is doing a Taylor Swift video soon! 😅  Love your videos, they bring me joy even during a cruel summer or rainy winter
Blessed St Andrew Huberman
I'm so sorry to hear everything you said about how easy it is to track someone down now. You're completely right in not letting all of these creeps control your life❤
lots of love always
Y'all be acting an absolute puerile in public, but because it's New York they'll assume you're one of theirs.
Fun times ahead in the big apple 😁😂
Well she did say stupid in this one so thats a pretty big step towards a curse word
You are one of the realest people I know (in a fake way because I dont personally know you)
Who was the first person we saw at the Met Gala? So much to digest in this video i love it.
8:30 Agh as a woman who travels alone, 90% of comments I get are from other women telling me how ACTUALLY xyz woman was killed leaving their house and I will die at any second. Then you get guys who are just patronizing and say the same thing with the guise of being protective of women...then there's women who also solo travel and completely get it ahahaha. I know women are harassed dude, let me live my life. You can live in fear I'm gonna travel the world, thx!
I FEEEL the unique name thing. I'm the only person with my name (the first thing I ever hear is "I have never met anyone with that name in my life.") and EVERYONE is obsessed with it right away, don't forget it, and then if they're creepy yeah they can find you. I've also had stalkers so I'm very careful with my name and then people think you're a bitch for not giving your full name. Like YOUR NAME IS JOHN?! It's honestly scary and it makes me kinda wanna legally change my name even though I love my name.
Shockingly the ad reads are usually my favorite part of your videos lol
We like ourselves.
I love your ad being dine in the bathroom. Also, I'm so jealous to whomever has their own laundry in the bathroom! That's amazing!   Also, sorry you have crappy people being weird and creepy. I've not had to deal with full on stalkers in Canada.  I hear it's a bigger issue in the US. So, I hope you can go on some vacations out of the country in places that's less common. Although going to random places is probably fairly safe generally from the sounds of it.  And I love your ottoman and desk!
Last video Everyone: Micarah please don’t show where you live it’s crazies out here. Especially in NYC Micarah very next video: Here is my exact apartment and layout 🤗
You have a bucket of water set to be triggered above your Ohio front door huh?
I hate the greatest showman! I thought I was the only one!
the cutest street! Love that you're living in New York!
10:41 cinematic masterpiece
You’re the only YouTuber who has given a sponsor spiel that I have actually listened through the whole thing and didn’t skip it. Cue the applause 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I liked this video also u should go to the Bronx and try a bacon egg an cheese
STOP!!!! The Zacchaeus joke took me out !🤣
i think youtube decided youre a bad influence or smth because i just dont get notifications for your videos anymore, even with the bell on... which means ill have to find Other Ways
So funny...glad to see you seeming more up to your usual energy, as you seem to be enjoying this next chapter of your life! Go you!
Totally unrelated but i love your brother’s band lol
All I need is a Big picture of Gereon on your wall👍😉🕊
Gurl!!! Welcome to the city, I'll start carrying random fruit to give you if I see you and not fan out lol
Please recreate Halle’s premiere dress from the little mermaid 🧜‍♀️
no mf way, ill be in NY next week T0T
Micarah, I live in the lower east side! We can be not friends in new york if u want
micarah have u seen the barbie versace!!!
Eye'm 2 capable 2 🐝 incompetent....
For a “useless video” I thought it was pretty fun actually
I swear the YouTube algorithm knows that I have the same exact yellow couch
Wanted an apartment tour.
Micarah, you're my favorite youtuber and I get very happy each time I see you've posted a new video! It looks like a butterfly shape on your dress form. :) I'm praying for you! ~Rose
I totally get the name thing, can't get away from it, either.  Enjoyed the tour of the apartment.
I’m really excited for you!
your artistry makes me want to paint more :D its very inspiring in a chaotic way and i love it!!! i hope you have a great time living in NYC
my reaction to your bathroom is: its bigger than the rv ones
Narnia was awesome why were you not allowed to watch it.
Your videos are literally the only ones with entertaining enough sponsorship ads that I don’t skip past them, we’ll done 👍  Also the term “terminally uncoordinated” is the perfect thing to describe me so thank you for that
Bless you Micarah you are such a ray of sunshine for millions of us <3
Love you loved this keep slaying queen
Wow you really made an amazing table :D So creative!  I also love the new 'everything is a television' meme. Getting the money out of that projector
Great video! I love the decorum of your apartment. It's really inspiring me to up-cycle my own place into something more creative and colourful.  Thank you so much for sharing all of your great ideas!
he did sound EXACTLY like your dentist!
does anyone know where i can get a projector like hers? I feel like i only see the big ones in amazon
my favorite youtuber lives on the same side of manhattan as me. crazy
New York City is a great adventure.  Enjoy!
I just knowww there are barbie videos brewing
Omg, I have a unique first-name-last-name combo too!!! At least there are 2 others who share it with me and I can use a different spelling in case I become a content creator (which I'm just about too, btw, and the only reason I don't share my twitch channel here is because everything will be in Brazilian Portuguese... Unless you wanna learn to speak it, in which case, it's bugdomillenial in most social networks)
Micarah you can’t cuss bc then birb might learn a bad word and repeat it at school
Can’t wait for the future videos in this cute apartment! Congrats Micarah!
IT'S A PLUMBUS
THAT WAS THE BEST SKILLSHARE AD EVER OMG MICARAH
That top is a butterfly surely.
Still only youtuber I like watching the ad portion of.
The biggest tragedy is that the ottoman had to go back to Ohio
The dress you wore at 11:09 reminded me of a dress Taylor Swift wore at her Speak Now World Tour.
Absolutely stunning yes I am here for the new york casey nistat vloog
when the quantum computer comes out all crimes will be solved - like the alien grays hiding in the black holes, that can use a quantum computing tractor beam on black hole to make it what it was before black hole destroyed it, or just turn it into a worm hole or Oneill cylinder. but i wanted to change the grays DNA to give them bunny ears so can tenderize them for being probing little b's   👽🐰
Can I please paint you a XXL Starry Night?
okay but where do you store your clothes 😂
What about your bird? Did you leave him behind ?
I'm in Jersey City and I have a Nespresso Vertuo Next in the colour Cherry Red if you'd like it! My mom gave it to us for free because it didn't fit under her cabinets - so instead of returning it and getting her money back, in classic Canadian fashion she avoided any potential conflict and gave it to us... You could have an ~imported coffee machine~ that you didn't have to pick up off the ground, ooh la la, but maybe you want one from the ground for the New York-ness of it all
YOU DONT ENJOY THE GREATEST SHOWMEN ?!!!!!!!
I hope no harm ever comes to you! I want you to live in your vibe
The weird wake up hack actually works and i wish more people thought completely oit of the freaking box like that coz omg 👁️👄👁️
So happy for you, queen! 😁😁😁 Your apartment is really cute!
I'm so glad you're making friends already!! And especially Rebeca, she looks almost as fun as you!
Be prepared to have those fruits
Micarah Tewers, the only youtuber whose ad segment you can't and won't skip on.
Micarah should colab with Hailey Kalil now! They give chaotic barbie vibes
You’re so right, that guy who sold you the table on Facebook marketplace DID sound exactly like your dentist! 🤣
So glad you are out here living your best life! You should be so proud of yourself and the positive impact you’re making ❤️
It’s so weird to have started watching you when you were still a small creator, stop watching because of, well, life, and then coming back to seeing you have such a large community!! So proud!!
your ads always slay me lfnmmfjreifj
What a talented DOLL.  Be careful in the big city!  God Bless.
ur so rich now that it's giving barbie🤩🤩
12:01 Did that when I worked in Tokyo for a month 😅
You not being allowed to watch Narnia when it has so many religious similarities is hilarious
It's so sad that we live in a world where you must devote as much time as you did to explaining your safety. I paused the video to say that. I really appreciate your quick-witted content. I will resume now.
I find it very fitting that I had an advert for the barbie movie while watching the video
Ah living out all my sex in the city dreams lol
i had to check if i was watching this at 1.25 speed
I really want you to make your own barbie movie.
This Barbie, is the Barbie I wanna be❤
Love your videographer's work. Love the vogue bit. I'm always here to be inspired to be creative and laugh at your jokes. I feel like doing hard things is how we grow and while living in New York is exciting it's also super novel to you and a huge thing to take on. So now I'm here to be inspired to go on adventures too. Also, you're one of the few YouTubers I don't skip ads on because they're still amazing content - so advertisers ->Give this girl your money. 🤣
I've been a long time fan and it's really fun watching you evolve. I'm glad Newyork is working for u and that the creeps aren't getting to you. I hope the year will bring lots of interesting experiences and that you have fun. The video was great I like when u just ramble o about whatever its good entertainment. Also well done with the ads their actually pretty good usually I just skip them cuz their boring but not yours. I'm pretty sure one day your dream of becoming a tight rope walker will come true just believe. The decorations in your apartment are really pretty.
Waking up to go and sleep on your balcony is very new York behavior  You've already adapted
It's wild to see you living in my old neighborhood in NYC. I met numerous creative & interesting people in my years there after art school. I'm excited for you & all the potential to grow & the tales you shall regale us with from your adventures!
Love the location change
This wasn't a useless video because it made me laugh and I find that very useful 💖
If you wanna spice up the word terrace you can say it in an Italian inspired way: ter-AH-chee
Micarah’s jokes are undefeated
They make roll-out fire escape ladders? you could attach one to your terrace just in case? ❤
Nice thing about Central Park: it's practically empty when it's raining 😀 All you need is a big umbrella and a pair of sturdy rubber boots and you got yourself an adventure!
i think you and gigi goode would make the bestest of content together
Micarah can do no wrong. Just keep up with these videos whichever way and take New York by storm. I’ll be here to support these channel. 💜
That I'm only allowed to go in one room of lololol
Nah that Zacchaeus joke 💀
Holy cows. You’re a genius! I’m going to go take a pillow outside when I wake up the first time now. & you did a sick job editing! Haha ha 🤟
Gurl, don't touch grass in NYC 🐶 😂 excellent video 💚
Great video and great PSA!
Hope your ear's ok.
that painting is grandpa JJ! and that table is really nice. have fun over there Micarah❤
You're the greatest comedienne of my generation
i just moved into a tiny studio apartment that has the bed above the closet and i throw stuff to the couch all the time i feel insanely validated right now 😂😂
15:47 Shouting "Zacchaeus!" as a guy is climbing up a tree to see over a crowd is peak Christian comedy
I think the word you were looking for at your yard was *somnivolent*
Congrats on your adventures!!
Excited for you Micarah! So happy you moved to the East Coast/NYC & not the West Coast/LA. You are going to thrive & reach new heights with your creativity & stretch & grow so much as a person. We can always go home. Fly & use your wings. Dig this.
Every outfit change was fire
Not the Zaccheus “was a wee little man” reference. 😂
Wait why’d she move to nyc?
watched the skillshare ad after the nyquil kicked in and it just felt like a normal sequence
You would always make my day
Is your cameraman friend single? I'm asking for a friend
I loved the video it was not useless 😔😔! Also a side note: I'm obsessed w ur blouse at 14:51 that color is stunning on you
8:55 I’m assuming the other YouTuber was Ashley (aka bestdressed)?
You werent allowed to watch Narnia as a child. How sad. 😢
I love this ❤
Ever since I watched Friends, I always wanted to live in NYC. This apartment is so cute Micarah! Great job decorating and furnishing it! 💙
I was actually curious about rent  on a place like that in NYC so close to cemtral park nonetheless. I understand why you wouldn't share the exact numbers but my crazy self spends hours on zillow with no intention to buy a house just to see the prices
THANK YOU FOR THE FREE MONTH OF SKILLSHARE!!! 😄😄😄
Such a cute apartment on a gorgeous-looking street! I love the functional upgrades you made to the sewing table/workspace.
“This is my lake.” Micarah says in front of the Central Park reservoir.
Marry grandpa JJ
So jealous of the good dumpster diving finds! I was pretty satisfied with myself when I would dive for spare boxes when I was moving and didn't have to buy any more. Love the video and the waking up with the sun is kinda inspired, may try it when I get my apartment lol
Can you plz do a video on all your scary situations?!?!?!
You went to the Met Gala!!!! I’m so jealous! Also, this video was epic.
The word is “facade” for the outside of your building
ADHD?
I'm so glad you are happy! It would be so fun to meet you in NYC one day! Also, phenomenally edited video as usual!!
0: YOU DIDNT SEE NARNIA 0:28 of all the movies I’ve expected you to have never seen, i wouldve never guessed this one! i mean its based on christianity, the lion *is jesus*
Other tv screens not shown - floor, toilet bowl, an apple, a box of life cereal, the neighbors building etc
yess queen give us everything!! im so excited to see what comes out of your new york living, the thrifting is gunna be insane!!
girl you will slay new york, so happy for you!
im moving back to nyc this summer and omg u've inspired me sm on how i want to decorate and make things for my home, and yes i will prob fail these easy diys but idc cuz they look so fun! ur place looks so you and so beautiful and fun!
From what I’ve seen of tiny NYC apartments she got a good one it’s so cute ☺️
Margot Robbie is wonderful, but Micarah is my real-life Barbie icon
Love Micarah but NYC is a disgusting cess pool 🙂
Also I’m so glad ur in a healing era I love it for you
Lol wtf this video is so good.. nice job. 😂 Sub’ing!
Side of the road furniture is always the best furniture
I feel like Micarah is older sister telling all her subscribers to not worry about her safety cuz she’s a smart 🍪 ur content has always gotten me through a hard time Micarah and if you are seeing this I wanna say thank you
A lot of YouTubers put ads in their videos. Most of them are usually skipped, sometimes they're simply ignored but when the macarah puts an ad in a video not only do you watch the entire thing, you rewind and watch it again because it's hilarious.... I wonder if she learned that on skillshare
so bold of you to make a shirt shaped like a rorschach test
LOVE your new york era this semi vlog content is so fun :))
I think Micarah’s maple shelf as my friends old shelf…
thanks for this cute vid I love a lil home tour
the butterfly that looks like it should be a bodice but also looks like the only way to wear it is to tape it to your body which is both very micarah and also like something she would never wear. 10/10
I too and the only person in the world with my name. And yes it is annoying.🙃
I love a tewer tour
That table works harder then me
Micarah, I have to say, you have a big personality fit for the Big Apple! You can do whatever weird stuff you want in public and nobody will mind because it's New York. When I heard you moved I thought, "Oh, she'll be happy there."
Micarah and maipham
What a great appartment! I hope you feel at home.
"Zacchaeus!!!"
This is random but you look like Chrissy from Stranger Things
This makes me want to eat some pepperjack cheese. I don’t have any, though.
AJAJ EL EVIL RABBIT 😂
You know how AI works by figuring out the most likely next word or phrase? My belief is that Micarah Tewers works by predicting the least likely next word or phrase and saying that. Genuine struggle to watch these late and night and not wake my lodgers with laughter. Steller work.
"The fact that 3% of America's wealth is in front of us right now and we haven't stormed the Met yet" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 This guy seems cool.
Adding some love to even out the bad comments. I don’t sew, not a fan of retro or Barbie, but goodness I LOVE your content 💕 keep being you :):) Much love from Norway
Bdbsjsb This video makes me wanna move to NY- And I can't stand cities ;w; But it would be so fun
Yes, you are spot on. Let's teach people not to be creeps and not chastise women for showing too much of their lives to allow said creepos to find them. Also a working mental health system would be freaking fantastic. I love the Barbie New York City apartment you have added to your collection and now I want to add a cutting track to my craft desk.
Wait… your brother is in the Plot In You?!
The only thing that worries me when Christians move to the big city, is that they'll lose God. I've seen it happen with other YouTubers and it makes me sad.
I love that you changed your outfit to match the astettic of the diferent areas in your apartment. I"m glad to hear you met some cool people outside the Met Gala. Love your videos so thank you for making them
Such a fun space!
Urban exploring with kappy has so mmay good videos, if you want to see some old house explorations he is the channel to go to!!
It sounds to me like Micarah takes advantage of her second amendment rights, I wonder if it’s pink?
you're literally the funniest person ever
What’s ur TikTok??
Zaccheus 🤣🤣🤣
Okay but how do you make friends because I lived in NY my whole life and still can't make any friends
love love love your videos! :+)  apartment is GORGEOUS and don't let the lack of shelfs get you down, im v jealous of ur sewing table T_T
Keep thriving queen!
As someone who is also desensitized to danger I was annoyed, by all those comments about safety, for you. You have always struck me as someone who knows how to defend themselves and wont comprimise fun and quality of life for safety theatre.
the desk i so genius
PLEASE Let us watch Narnia with you on youtube live or twithc omg
the amount of shelves you have is amazing. i love shelves. thank you
My laugh of the day
The butterfly top or dress (not sure what you're gonna make with it) is everything I will be able to think about until you show us the final result
Maybe it’s me but Bridgeton is in New York and I wanna see her go and make a dress. I don’t know why😅😂😊❤
Can confirm - he sounded exactly like your dentist.
Love the the dude at 16:32 lol
Barbie needs to endorse you. You are just absolutely barbie energy in the purest form 😍😭
"Someone on this street will throw out a Keurig any day now!" Ya  Micarah, it's you XD
I love your ability to recognize good trash. Its my favorite quality in a person.
YES QUEEN!!!❤ slay your epic dream life❤❤
This is a perfect video
Good for you, Micarah! Living prepared is so much better that living in fear!
So proud of you!! You should drop by long Island city. The parks and views there are so amazing, and 90% of the crowd are doggies and babies.
this looks exactly like @bestdressed apartment!!!
I'm glad you're safe! Honestly for the size, the flat is cute
I watched the Barbie movie trailer for the first time today and my first thought was „Oh this website looks exactly like the one Micarah made the other say!“ 😅
Enjoy wondering around New York.
Welcome to New York! It's been waiting for you! It's a new soundtrack, we could dance with this feeling... FOREVERMORE!
he did sound exactly like your dentist!!
Micarah, it's dangerous for you to not set any traps for werewolves
If it’s any consolation, YouTuber Adam Ragusea filmed some sponsored content outside of the front of his house, and had the comments on the video flooded with warnings. I remember also being concerned until he reminded is in his next video that we have his full name and could just look him up in a phonebook 😅
the way I thought the safety clip was going to be about the really low railing on the balcony.
I love it ❤ I live in a small apartment in Mexico City 🌞👼🏻 yours is so cute. Thanks for sharing
okay can we talk about that pastel green and white fit?? LOVE IT SM
Enjoy New York, Micarah.
I love all these fits! they look great! and the brick wall looks so cool in the apartment
You are the real life Barbie.
I think Micarah would be perfect for Kelly Wakasa videos (he also lives in NY) for man on the street. Cause she is not shy to act out in the public. 😂
Micarah my queen, I predict that ULTIMATELY you will become a Brooklyn girl. Take your time, but I really think you'd thrive in BK getting around on a pink bike. Also there's parking!
15:48 The Zacchaeus joke had me pause the video and laugh out loud. For those he didn’t get it, in the Bible a tax collector named Zacchaeus climbed a tree to see Jesus.
Where’s Gareon???
Is no one going to talk about how cute she is with braces??
i love it
BRAD MONDO NEEDS TO DO YOUR HAIR!!!
You should totally start a series on sex in the city…where you do the opposite of those women in your series and recreate all of their notable outfits.
I liked the sewing.....
the tree kick was so cinematic
So happy for you and your new adventure!! I do have to point out that Josh 1000000% sounds like the 27 questions guy and did a great job! Thank you for all the hard work you put into your videos and for being you! <3
I personally knew two different women who were murdered in their homes. Maybe the comments annoy you, but its because a lot of us know people who were attacked and killed and you always seem very flippant about it. And YouTubers have had people break into their homes. Not just women. Ryland and Shane had someone break onto their property in a gated community. Julien and Jenna had someone break into their house. Gavin Free and Meg Turney had a man break into their house having written a manifesto about murdering Gavin and then shot himself in their driveway. So I don't think showing where you live and just accepting stalking as inevitable is the way forward.
i wonder what her take on santacon will be, it won't really reach her on the upper east side but i could see her attracted by the costumes, although the stench of alcohol and puke are pretty repulsive even for new york
Trust Micarah to make the tiniest space highly functional. Can you that to me?
That tiny balcony is everything I don't live for cuz I'm a fatty. Did you know that having a small balcony like that is actually fatphobic towards any visitors or people who walk on the street and look up and wonder what it would be like to be on that tiny balcony? And yes, this comment was a joke.
This video you worked so hard on was really amazing! I loved the editing, even tho you may have been sick ^^ Lots of love for you.
Noooo! As soon as I move out of NYC you move to NYC! I am gonna have so much fomo watching all your NY content!
About your privacy, girl I feel you!!!!  My freshman year in college I was the absolute only person with my first name attending the university (it was a major university, I’m talking classroom sizes of 100-200) and just based on my first name and guessing what university I went to (because I was wearing a tee from the school in one of my MySpace pics [yes this was that long ago] an “internet friend” found my exact dorm room from the student directory.  He traveled from VA to NY to pay me a surprise visit and was none too excited with I was upset and called him a stalker. I was also none too excited by the fact that I thought I was talking to someone my age and he was over a decade older. He accused me of being a c-tease and tried to assault me. I never flirted with this person. We were online DnD buddies and I thought he was a real friend.  Fast forward to today, I will never move from NYC (born and raised here so I thought an upstate college would be a change of pace for me). I don’t use my real name on the internet anymore. But similar to you I’ve learned people that really want to will always be able to find whoever they want no matter what. Safety comes from more than anonymity because no one can be 100% anonymous.
I feel like nyc fits you so well. I hope you have an absolutely amazing time <3
Not my boyfriend being in the video😂 have fun in nyc!
I'm living for this PSA. Everything about this is so true
I just can't believe how you can improve your videos EVERY time Each time a video drop it's perfect and the montage keeps getting better, like the rythm is godly, the jokes always new and hilarious, the ads never slow down the rythm of the video. Everything is energising and motivational Thank you for those good laughs
Welcome to NYC! ❤
We're neighbors!!! Hope to run into you one day, enjoy magical new york <3
15:48 core bible jokes
I love your commercial for skillshare.  And yeah now that you bring it up being a pretty woman named Micarah (not a terribly common name) would make it likely that someone would stalk you. 😬 I have a common first name, my maiden name is slightly uncommon but not terribly so. And honestly average looking. So no one wants to stalk me.
love to see you living the best of both worlds (Manhattan and Ohio)
loooooove
When she said that Skillshare was ruthless, I imagined Skillshare aggressively imparting skills to people. I love how Micarah does ads.
I'm pretty sure Micarah is the reason for me feeling pressure to be witnessed in more than five repeating outfits while simultaneously somehow staying home for that?
That is such a big apartment! That’s beautiful
Get better soon <3
Ok I actually LOL'd at St Andrew Huberman 😂
micarah makes me wanna move to ny, i absolutely loved it when i visited and this isnt helping with my obsession 😭😭😭
micarah beware of the city. it's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, it is mad! those who are fools are swallowed up whole, and those who are not become what they should not become; changed. in short they go bad...  that's from the musical evita. you should go see it. in new york city.
I need to know the brand of that little projector thing
I love your yellow couch 💛💛💛
you’re my real life barbie foreverrrrr
I love you Micarah, every single one of your videos have given me so much comfort and joy and this one is no different. Keep being you!!
#ThoroughlyEnjoyed 💖😎😂💖
Loved this video!
I love it!! 💖😂💖😂💖😂😂💖💖😎😎😎😎
Ha! Don't think I've ever seen her be so serious 😅
I really love your videos, they always make me laugh. Hope you find a lot of joy in your new place!
All I wanna say to this video: I was really taken aback by how accurately you pronounced the word "balcony" in Greek 😂  OH AND ALSO I'm glad you're keeping yourself safe!!!
I'm surprised with all that YouTuber money she couldn't find a proper apartment but hey guess that shows how expensive New York is
i'm in the bronx with a keurig we don't want anymore... i assume if i leave it outside on a week day afternoon it'll magically appear in your apartment
Lovf NYC
good video! if i lived in new york i would not throw fruit onto your balcony because i am poor :)
amazing video
Watching your videos always brighten my day. Your sense of humor is amazing! :D
The balcony with the trees, sunshine and birds is really nice✨ Not sure where your legs go when the table front bit goes down. 😐
Thats such a cute apartment, permission to steal🤲🏼
I don't dream to be tight rope walker, but I do dream now to meet you one day and befriend you like all those nice people in your videos.
❤
Micarah is a sunshine <3
Saint Andrew Huberman 😂😂😂 It’s funny because he has totally reached Saint status in my mind but I didn’t realize he was popular enough to be referenced in a Micarah video so it really threw me off guard
Don't worry Micarah, I got you. I'll get a hamster and name them Micarah Tewers, then somehow craft a birth certificate for them so you will no longer be the only Micarah, and therefore you will be safe..er! us girls gotta stick together💖
I'm so jealous! First, having a manhattan apartment, second, WITH A BALCONY! Aaaaaand it's springtime right now, the ultimate best new york season, myy god! Living your best life, enjoyyyy it!!
The scene at the park gave me Phoebe from Friends vibes so hilarious 😂
The abc part, throw me of guard
Not me relating to thermostats triggering a gag reflex😂
Your personality fits new york so well! I'm so excited for all you are going to show us
The only thing I would be afraid of .... is falling off the bed.
I miss grampa JJ in your videos 🥲🥲
I honestly forgot about the ad and was justo watching it as another part of the video😂. I hope you are happy in NY!
Your videos are so fun to watch cause you are so very energetic and creative...which are things that i am not 😅
"I just like all my clutter to match" sound like fun. 😂
She's the ultimate real barbie, pay her for promotion of the film finally
I’m currently living in NYC and bruh, your apartment is possibly 3 times the size of mine. And my bathroom is down the hallway. Im not digging for sympathy but more putting things in perspective.
I'm so happy for you. I pray all your dreams come true in New York.
the yellow couch × exposed brick combo is SO good you truly have an eye for aesthetics
Get better soon 🙏🏻 Thanks for the details of the table, I was curious about it - drawers are useless when you have many ✨ magnetic strips✨ The apartment is small but well refined, I know the rent situation is dire but you wouldn't make a reckless decision, so I hope what you get from this is priceless 🙏🏻
do you guys know whats the projector she's using? thank you🙃
I really need her to go to the Barbie Premier
The ending 💀😂👌🏻
I mean, at least it is roomy :)
Ho-lee crap! I don't know why anyone would purposely move to New York City. Your video was so stinking funny though. Good luck on this adventure.
The sound you used for the sewing room section will forever be associated with you in mind. Love the apartment, looks super cute
I have the exact same problem, my name is so rare. I never use my full name in usernames or profiles cause ppl can google me so easily 😣
ZACCHEOUSSS
that desk is a hold mood , love it
i got the trailer for the barbie movie during this video
ZACCHAEUS!
Best roommate ever
ok but can you drop the tutorial for the smokey eye you're wearing in the safety PSA part of the video.....
No but like seriously...he sounded JUST like your dentist!
Ashley and micarah collab
I have an unusual surname (well, I married into it, anyhow) and as far as I can determine there is ONE other person on planet earth with my first name, surname combo, and like, my first name is JANE, so yeah, I feel that.  Loved the Met Gala commentary, and the skillshare ad was genius. Wishing you all the best for your new adventure!
I want the kitchen shirt please where can I acquire one or one adjacent
"This is the best smelling crowd I've ever been stuck with." 😂 This whole thing was glorious. Thank you.
Large swaths of fabric or curtain just make any space that much better. And thank you for giving your thermostats privacy. I'm sure they appreciate it
That was fun
This is so lovely! Also can I ask if Garion will be invited to hang out in your shack?
… Multifunctional table/desk is the best … 😂
i just know this is gonna open up such a bigger better chapter for you in your life, Micarah. New York seems to suit you well :) This video lowkey is helping me manifest my future in NYC one day too (hopefully)
I wanna see you meet Aubrey Plaza and have a conversation.. I feel like that would be... Fantastic. 🤣
The end of the video with all the chaos was so slay and i love it.
That desk is amazing. I want to make my own like that!
i love your apartment and its coming along really great!! i cant wait to see all the things you do and make and see if you do more barbie things with the movie coming out! (you probably have said you will but -2 memory). also im really glad you added that safety section to the video because i totally agree that it took over the comments on the previous video, the things you have made and done so far look amazing btw!!
I'm glad you called out all the buzzkill females who try to subdue the rest of us. Like if yall stop being so scared and actually leave your home what are the creeps gonna do, kill us all?? We actually out-number them. Just be smart, carry a weapon, and live your life.
That desk is amazing!
He sounded exactly like your dentist
You're the only YouTuber who's ad-reads I NEVER skip. You really are talented at it all, a true Barbie
<3
I can't wait until you realize that your ceiling is an empty football field of usable space just waiting for you to occupy. Pulleys are wonderful transformers.
im sorry that painting looks toooo much like ur friend AHAHAH
Not me knowing the Barbie website doesn't have games anymore 😭
The serotonin increase I experience when seeing a new micarah video
Omg I want Micarah to storm the MET next year with that guy
your humor one to ten is 11
Useless video?? Jokes on you I’m moving and videos like this are what’s getting me through the struggle.
Love
I like the guy pointing out that we’re not angry enough at the massive wealth discrepancy, thanks for including him in your always-perfect editing 😊
a congratulations 🍾 micarah you won a dinner  🍽 with me to claim your dinner gently reply back. my pleasure 😇
i.. i wanna be as fashion as you when i grow up
Always love how fun and heartwarming your vids are. Even when you tackle the hard stuff it’s so nice to see a YouTuber who is just being real and having fun with videos. Your vid’s really bring me a feeling of comfort
I wanna be best friends with the girl who said “ yes queens give us nothing” at the kardashians lmao
The way you edit these is very addicting
Id only wish to own a nebula capsule 2 projector , holy over 700 bucks!
I feel like if you replaced the butterfly art with a huge plain white canvas it'd be perfect for the projector and waaay cheaper than a tv. And when the projector is not in use just say it's a metaphor.
Would love to see you try buy nothing!
Welcome to New York! 💞 So excited to see what this move brings you
I was gonna comment about something you said but I waited until the end of the video cuz I didn't want to be rude but now I can't remember so here I am uh just writing. Anyways ig I'll just what you have against the greatest showman and I hope you are doing great! :3 (Ik the second one wasn't a question, but don't mind that lol_)  Also if you ever read this, my mom says hi, we watch your videos together and she loves you (you're the only youtuber she watches since she doesn't really watch youtube)
Your sewing station is legitimately one of the coolest things I have ever seen! Love all the outfit changes, the fact that you went to the Met Gala (honestly, that guy about the 3% thing), and how you called people out for acting like you were some dumb, naïve, small-town girl.
"ZACCHAEUS!"
You're really selling me on that projector, I think I'm gonna buy it!
must be nice
When you were on your balcony, and then cut to a safety discussion, I thought for sure it was going to be something about reassuring people you were practicing balcony safety. This is the non-famous-person world I live in, it seems. Anyway back to the video! You are literally like one of the only youtubers whose paid advertisements I really enjoy because they are nearly as entertaining as the rest of the video XD GOOD JOB! Also your apartment is lovely and wow the street is so pretty! (And I really liked your hairstyle when you're in the purple dress ^^)
Of all the YouTubers I would expect to move to NYC .. a girl too afraid to watch the Chronicles of Narnia is not the one. 😂 Actually I think it is freaking amazing that you have done this and I look forward to many more hilarious videos for the next year. Good for you!❤❤❤❤😊
The apartment is so cool! My question is: do you still own the RVs?
Considering the Christian themes of Narnia I'm a bit surprised you weren't allowed to watch it. For fantasy reasons? Or violence maybe? lol either way congrats on the new place!
I always look forward to watching your videos!!!!!❤️❤️
I almost commented about not showing your door and then your segment on safety came on 😂 I never really thought about it that way, it’s not fair to always hear about safety concerns when you’re just trying to have fun and life your life. We deserve better 😭
Guys let’s not find her location and kill her please :) love you Micarah🫶🏾✨
This was an amazing video all laughs and happiness loved it 💕 stay safe girlie 🫶
not judging just curious why you weren't allowed to watch narnia...?
I've never cussed either Micarah! Maybe we can both have "she never said a cuss word" on our tombstones.... I realize that sounds creepy but I promise it is not. Lol I'm so excited to see what God has in store for you in NYC!
You look so happy here !!! very slay
The Chronicles of Narnia are actually quite in line narratively with Christian beliefs, I think you would like the series
Ligit sounding like Tara Strong in the ad haha
Just an awesome video. The energy is top tier and reminds me of your old bedroom makeover. You did amazing.
sure it costs a lot of money to live there, but with all the free furniture/projector screens it probably evens out.
That is the most perfect sewing table I’ve ever seen in my entire life!!!!! (I too dream of having one of those line cutter thingys so I can cut straight lines)
While none can best the energy of Micarah, the individual at 16:33 comes close. What is said with such aplomb (love that word) embodies the people that I wish were my besties...well after Micarah. She is correct BTW, anyone with a recent (in computer years "recent" would be defined as within the last 2 weeks) social media presence is fairly easy to find. However my unprofessional opinion after seeing Micarah's imagination and energy play out on her videos, behooves (love that word too) me to caution anyone from in-person weirdness. It would NOT end well, besides there may be a 6 foot tall version of Choupette lurking nearby. Seriously, it is the 21st century out there, while there are no flying cars, no colonies on Mars and no adequate universal healthcare globally, we still need to behave like adults. If that doesn't work, remember that just about anyone who has Googled consciously or subconsciously thinks that they are Sherlock Holmes so no weird stuff.👀
Okay but those Met Gala clips were EVERYTHING.
I don’t know why I found it so funny… but you had my hot chocolate coming out my nose when you felt the need to specify you had no acquaintance with the butterflies 😂
Enjoy NY!
Did you ever say why you took an apartment in NYC?
There is a tarot reader here named Empress Census that reminds me of you
Couldn't watch Narnia? Probably also not able to watch HP.  That's so sad. 😢
Another hack to small space living (I live in a tiny apartment in Tokyo) is to hang stuff up on your walls! Get command hooks and the like and go all out. You can hang up cuter stuff like hats or scarves in the main area and use the front door for uglier stuff, and even hang up spray bottles or washcloths for cleaning in your kitchen or bathroom (just make sure you get strong enough hooks).
EVIL RABBIT
Love the flip hair style on you.
When you talked about the security of your ohio home I was low-key expecting a scene of you putting a glass of water on top of the door that will fall on whoever opens the door
Ok but not me gasping when she said my name because I am Emily Smith😂
Girl please watch the Narnia movies or read the books they're literally Christian allegories
i don't know if this is a thing you even have any interest in but i lowkey hope to see you at new york comic con this year.
Micarah might not cuss, bu she definitely has a "I dont Give a f***" attitude!  Its soooo NY! She might be sweet but she has bites. Definitely a carrie bradshaw!
NOT ME FEELING SO SPECIAL HEARING MICARAH SAY MY NAME (Emily Smith). Thank you for ensuring my anonymity 😂😂😂 PS WELCOME TO NYC 🎉
Wow I’ve never seen a NYC apartment with so many offices lmao loved what you did to the space ♡
💖
Can’t believe someone would sleep up there before the thing she added. I’d be terrified I’d roll off to my death in my sleep.
OK one where is garien and two what did you do with your campers and three What about your house?
New York makes you look normal…. I was looking forward to this move yet, this made me feel confined. I do believe you’ll find a suitable prosperous guy quickly though and a fashion gig. 🎉🎉
Install a small wall organizer on the outside of your fantastic mutli-use sewing table, on the side that doesn't have anything on it and bam...'drawers'. In fact, if you get the ones with tiny drawers you could use those for storing notions (buttons, trim, beads, needles, etc.)
I farted a lot watching this video.
Fun NY allergy fact: most of the trees are male to avoid having to clean up the seed pods so spring/summer is an allergy battle and that’s why New Yorkers are so tough, also the rats
What a fantastically useless video, compliment by the way! I'm a gay bro so no threat from me 😂 but super cool to see what you've done with the place, and as always JJ's the one need to be watching out for me cuz fuck is he beautiful!
I like your videos. That's why I like them.
Dude, that place is huge for NYC! Congrats, nice find.
This is so fun to get to see your life and journey!  Thanks for taking us along! Yaaaaaay for new adventures and new friends!   I'm curious how much of your food budget will be covered by the free fruit landing on your balcony soon.  Smart girl. hahha
is this bestdresses apt?
"my apartment was built before fire existed"  please never ever change, Micarah <3
I love how funny and weird Micarah is
girl im so excited to see that you're in nyc. would you hold a fan meeting to watch the barbie movie premiere together cuz we would SLAY HARD
Oh my God. I have that EXACT SAME rotary phone!!!!!!!!!! Holy moly!!!!! That thing is in my basement! :D
What else
1. passers by,  2. Attorneys General, 3. ...??
wow I was considering working out today and after watching your workout I don't think I'm going to.
I laughed way too loud at the ABC song joke 😂
Did Little King Gereon move with you?? I seen him twice in the video but it looked like it was the old house, He’s so darn cute and I can imagine him loving the Manhattan lifestyle 😂 xoxoxoox
If you ever want a friend in Nyc I’ve been here for 3 years now 😅😂
You say useless, I say it was the PERFECT video entertain me as I washed the dishes and cooked sausage for my breakfast for dinner dinner.
I GOT A BARBIE AD BEFORE THIS VIDEO ❤
I’m loving NY Micarah 😊
.. I was leaving the G-will in Marysville last year and passed you ( Ms Micarah ) and your Mom were on your way in .. just looked at you and did not say a word ..
Another awesome video!  Thank you for sharing your adventures with us.
Also Micarah, the realness you said at 7:14 about being a woman working retail with a name tag. Sadly so true. I’m sorry you had to go through that. Creepers gonna creep. Keep on being a confident and safe queen ✨ also I used to have a Barbie pink car, and nothing bad ever happened to me.  It stood out, but no one was ever creepy the whole 6 years I had that car. Never hide your colorful side! We live to regret the reasons we didn’t just go boldly into the world 🦋
Wow you got that fully set up fast!  Too bad your landlord said no to pulling up your couch over the balcony, the cushions are harmless at the least.  6:00 If your dress is not supposed to be butterfly-shaped then I feel ashamed.  I really appreciate your comments on safety.  I guess, if you could do it over again, maybe you wouldn't share your first name?  Waking up to a neighborhood party is hysterical.  Thank you Josh for the camera help!
Hahaha I love the young man with the fro hair & what he says at timestamp 16:33 !!! *shade*
Hawt.
I think you could win Next in Fashion and also Survivor.
In Narnia, the lion is Literally Jesus. C. S. Lewis became Christian as an adult and you can tell he had strong feelings about it. The movies are fun to watch and might inspire some new sewing projects!
NY foraging sounds so fun.
The apartment looks great! And also the safety thing, I completely agree. I am just a regular not well known woman and I am constantly reminded by my female friends and family about how I can be in danger. Usually in situations where it’s not preventable too. I can honestly say it’s never saved me, it’s just made me scared to live my normal life. I know people mean well but I wish this would stop being the norm.
Thanks for the tour and hope you had fun at the Met gala crowd. Sounds like you have lots more gretmat creative ideas. :-)
realised i've been watching you for three years now. your creativity and approach to life has honestly been one of my biggest inspirations and i'm so glad to have found you. have a fantastic time in new york.  ps. that table may be the best thing ever since sliced bread
NYC meetup when?
lancing is also something that you've done before! (it was weird how you liked my unexpectedly popular comment about needlework on that video where you lance your dad's arm literally years later, I'm honestly so intrigued and have dozens of competing headcanons about why you did that.) Also I'm glad you're having fun and getting settled in NYC. It's a very fun place I wish I lived there but hooooo boy I don't envy your rent.
I love your program, Micarah
15:50 😏 Micarah, I’m no stalker but I know where you got those earrings from 😂
New York was just waiting for her
You actually got the one about freelance right.  A FREElance was an armored dude with no commitment to a Lord. AKA a mercenary.
do u think now that u r a fancy big city girl,  you will buy a serger?  I didn’t see it on the list of 5 things you will never do.
You is a smart, fabulous, amazing person I’m obsessed with. So thankful I get to see a little bit of you and your life cause you inspire me to be a less lame human, and more like the eclectic lady I wanna be 🤍
YOUR APPARTMENT SLAYYS LIKE A DRAGON !!! 🤩🤩❤❤❤
So now I really want to storm the Met
Yoo oh I should totally collaborate with Haley Kalil since your living in New York now!
i'm lowkey glad she tore into the safety warning, some of the comments on the last video were sooooooo condescending it drove me insane
The lady whose name is also a song 😂
Omg you are the absolute best. You make everything so fun and exciting
You weren't allowed?  Haven't gotten up the courage?? 🤷 Totally have the courage to go see Barbie!  Can't wait!!
still the best youtuber ever.
I'm so happy I've finally found someone like me (but with way more style and energy, lol). Like the carpet looking like old cigarette smoke is something I would say! Someone finally gets it!
Where’s your little bird? Is he not allowed in your apartment? 🕊️
I was subconciously wondering where on Earth you'd fit a bedroom or even a bed in there and then :D Your apartment is really cool, love the outfit changes AND to see you conquer New York!
This is the only channel where I gladly watch the sponsored section.
Zacchaeus!!! Totally got the reference even though it's been thirty years since Bible School
Thank you Micarah, you are helping me with what you do. Really thank you, I feel like you are exactly doing what you should do, coz you are at least reaching my heart just being you. And Im just a random Spanish perdon who lives in Spain! Incredible! Thanyou againnn ❤
bro there is no way the plot in you guy is ur brother this is crazy
The safety psa made me really emotional. But the apartment is beautiful! And the bit about free home goods with rats made me laugh so hard
You RULE!!!! 👏👏👏
that green velvety corsety top with the purple top trim is soooooo cuuuuuute. also, i need to build a multiuse desk for myself, that is such a useful piece of furniture.
You are absolutely the only YouTuber that I actually watch the “commercials”. They are awesome. Loved your hair flipped up. So cute.
I’m not sure what it says about me that, when you stopped to talk about safety, I literally thought your were talking about falling from the balcony 😅😂😂
how have i just realized your brother is in the plot in you..??
to the person who asked if i had watched the video no i hadnt finished it yet which is why i deleted my comment after getting to the relevant part of the video and cant reply to you anymore 🥹
Micarah is in her Cornelia Street era ❤ love this for you, babe!
…. But do you “think” curse words?.. like when you stub your toe? Sometimes yelling HOLY SCHNITZEL!! Won’t cut it.
Your channel is my absolute favorite thing on YouTube. Anytime a new video arrives, I get excited knowing I’m definitely going to have some laughs and I never have to worry about watching you with my kiddos! Love your apartment so much. Congrats, girl. ❤
When I find you I'll give you a hug (if thats okay)
re security, pretty girls had to worry about this since forever and ever and ever. Nothing to do with the internet.  These problems have their own transportation and can lurk about seeking out their target in person, no internet needed. You don't get through puberty without a ton of education on safety, you just don't.  Hiding is not the best method at all. there's so many better ways, like situational awareness, varying your routes and schedules, building local support systems, choosing when and where to be "vulnerable" and having a variety of self defense options on your person. From learning martial arts moves to carrying pepper spray, there's a lot of options. Micarah hasn't gotten to this age without knowing a thing or two.
petition for Micarah be in Barbie 2 when it inevitably is announced
I thought New York was only concrete 😂 it looks so pretty. Never been to the us so I wouldn’t know.
The moment when you shout „Zacchaeus“ at the guy climbing up the tree is honestly the funniest part of the video
Never say a cuss word. Yes, be proud of that. I'll never be able to say that because...well, in short, the pandemic. But this inspired me to commit to never saying a cuss word for the rest of my life, so thanks, Micarah! It's the end of one era 😮 and the beginning of another 🎉
Wooo how cute! I too am woken by the sun and that’s how I’m watching your brilliant content so early on an Australian Sunday morning.
I feel like you and NYC fit together so well! The apartment is adorable and I can't wait to see what other crafts you find and can create!
good good very good job on the adspot. I actually watched it and felt amused.  Also, nice desk, I'm jelly. I remember not having too much stuff so that a tiny place doesn't look cluttered.  I try so hard to get a semblance of that, giving things away and stuff, but dayum, the tools can't be ditched, right? LOL! Enjoy this journey, however many lives we may have, you only get this one once.
I'm thinkin of a summer trip to nyc just to let Micarah spit grapes at me from her balcony... All while I serenade her on bended knee with 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'...   or the 'Now I Know My ABC's' song- 🍇💐 Although, I wonder if it'd be more effective if I rode in on a hippopotamus.🦛
Did your cat purse inspire the cat costume?
I love your new place!!! Glad your safe and that looks like so much fun! I was hoping you were there to be on a certain tv sewing competition that we’re sure your would win 😅❤ have you found some interesting fabric stores?
Wanna how i got these scars? Side of the road, in a pile of garbage.
Wait does she still have her house?
No joke, some of those workout shots were cool.
just thinking about your landlord watching you sleep on your balcony for 30 mins every day
The thing about confidence, you are not afraid to totally let someone who intends to harm you know that through their effort, they WILL be hurt to the point of death, either theirs or yours. They may hurt you, but they will not walk away without injury. Most creeps want compliance without resistance. If you cause problems, you’re not worth the effort and they will leave you alone.
Did you make the shirt you are wearing when you talk about your security?  Because it is AMAZING!  I LIVE IT SO MUCH
narnia is actually just a retelling of the bible idk why you wouldnt be allowed to watch it
Lol I know an Emily smith 😂
I wish we could all just feel and be safe no matter where we are.  Really liked this video, inspired me to go thrifting for polka dots I can diy into an outfit
Well that's a whole lot of things you can't get in Ohio.
Micarah did you read the magic attic club book where the girl joins the circus and walks the tightrope???? I loved that book so much. Also not being allowed by Christian parents to watch Christian movies is always funny, my friend wasn't allowed to watch Prince of Egypt because it had magic
Micarah this was great editing and so creative. I love the attention to home decor and you making friends in the met crowd!
Please don’t forget about what happened to bestdressed stalkers are real stay safe
Did you buy your home in Ohio in full cash then? If you don’t want to pay a mortgage?
12:01: She's washin' her and her clothes!
Micarah for president 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Micarah... I hope you know all about the Mermaid Parade in Coney Island on June 17th.  I know you'd love it!
So you saying if i ever leave my room i can have a 1 in 8 million chance to run into Micarah on the street?! Love that for me! Welcome to NYC!! <3
No, but what was that guy at 16:30 saying? I was getting interested.   Also, love you micarah!!!
Micarah got a big ass gun in her sound booth
You'll never give a real AD home tour if you don't get a decorative bowl of citrus fruit
Your NYC wardrobe is already my favorite thing ever!
I’m glad you addressed the safety concerns! It’s hard not to be worried after what happened to the Best Dressed channel and being a woman our society conditions us to be afraid while also conditioning men to believe we are weak and easy targets. We know big celebrities and former presidents have top notch security, but it’s not something that comes to mind for influencers which is what makes me more anxious. I hope you have a good NYC experience 🖤
All hail St. Andrew.
Your content is one of the few things that makes me unexpectedly laugh out loud. Still laughing about the mailbox lyrics.
‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️go check out her net worth
“hi new yorkers”
Are Josh and JJ the same person?
Omg I see the plot in you poster I love them!!!
Why I feel you'll be friend with the whole neighborhood in a matter of time 😝 cause I would be, your such a gem ! Love your video ✌️
You NEED to watch Narnia! ❤ It is written by C.S. Lewis and the first book coincides on how Jesus died for us and our sins! A must watch🙏💒
"...to clothe all my tape worms."  That's the stuff that keeps me coming back. Thanks for the smile, and keep 'em coming, Micarah!
He sounded just like your dentist.
Ah, the joy of having an incredibly unique name...my legal surname is so rare I've literally never met or heard of anyone who shares it who isn't directly related to me. Sometimes, you really do just have to accept that you're easily findable. Your apartment is so cute -- you've taken a small space and given it so much personality without it looking cluttered. It's great to see you so happy again.
omg she hired THE avengers to protect her home
whoa New Yorkers are strange in like the best way possible 😂
You should do a collab with Haley Kalil she lives in New York as well you both have such similar senses of humor. ❤❤
I got the Barbie trailer as an ad, YouTube knows what the micaricans want
Similarly different!
Another great video!  🌞  I admire seeing you enjoy yourself (no matter what mood you're actually in). Very inspirational!   I delight in you living full on and making such fun videos.   Thanks for all the editing and stuff.  I bet I can't imagine all the hard work that goes into it all.
I folded my laundry to the entirety of this video and now I know that 2 loads of laundry takes me 17 mins to fold. Thank you.
bruh you need to get a patent for that table. i dont even sew but it's so good
That jump in gym was actually v impressive
The project is the gray matter in the spinal cord
From a girl with her name combo being super rare. I get it. If they want the sandwich they will find a way :c
It looks like you're having so much fun!
I am so excited for your NYC era! Its going to be lit!
You're the real Barbie, Michara.✨️
I got recommended to watch this video after watching the Barbie movie trailer
It really is so crazy how much that guy sounded like your dentist!
btw the dresser sold to you by your dentist looks very vintage and I would say is still in line with your anti modern yet still  modern look
Jared Leto 😭
Evil rabbit 😭😂
Miracah i like you but eww saying pete davidson ex ??? Why i am not a fan of kim kardashian but even less of pete and he say soooooooooo many disgusting and problematic things and he is  friend with this mysogynist of mgk , sooo that really dissapoint me that you did that,  just educate yourself next time even tho i know that that  was just a  sort of joke but knowing who he is that just not it
The only thing that sucks about watching youtubers for years and seeing how much they grow, is looking at yourself and see you sitting in the same place with nothing accomplished.
Why did you videoshop a bust into the sofa storage?
I like that your work out includes taking your shoes off.
i thought new york was a dangerous place to love especially if youre a woman...and everything is expensive
I need that sewing table and I don’t even sew (anymore) but I MAY start (again)
lol how many drawers does it have
Does anybody know the background song in 2:03? sound soo familiarr
Never rent and never have mortgage. So either be rich or live with your parents forever? Because you could never buy a place cash on your money from Joannes.
I'm pretty sure you got the skills to make watchable ads from skillshare, because that skill is ON POINT. Still haven't missed any ad from you.  btw, love your apartment and I actually I always pictured you living in the big apple. <3
I live vicariously through you Micarah 😂
still mad at the fact that micarah ain't the barbie in barbie movie
Quoting Huberman was not what I expected to happen in this New York vlog
I love your custom made desk 💜
7:09 omg! I love that top so much! The colours are all my favourite combinations. If anyone knows the website so I could take a better look at it, it would be much appreciated.
I'm miserably sick.  This was a nice little ray of sunshine :)
That was definitely the best Skillshare ad I’ve ever seen
Have you ever said "fan" because that's a swear word in Swedish.
I love that I watched the Barbie Movie trailer, scrolled down, and this was the first video I saw. Glad NYC is treating you well! 💗
do you have a kitchen tho (i was  listening to half of this video so if you just showed it without talking about it i totally missed it)
16:31 lmao let's storm the met next year 💃🕺 🏃‍♂🏃🏃‍♀💨
I think Micarah and New York will be mutually good for one another and I'm here for it. Can't wait to see more of your big city adventures.
Sick Micarah sounds like like Daria
So happy for you! Cheers to this exciting new chapter <3
Justice for Jenny Lind!
YOU DIDN'T TELL US HOW MUCH IS RENT
Micarah I hope New York brings much happiness to your life, I know you will thrive
As someone who also has a totally unique first/last name combo, I feel you SO HARD on the difficulties of privacy. I'm just resigned that I cannot hide at this point, and am grateful I am in no way famous or interesting to most people.
Idea: Sit at a cafe and draw pictures of people. Optional: give them to the person afterwards
Still the only YouTuber I’m excited to see doing an advertisement lol Hope NY brings you many happy adventures and NO stalker weirdos❤
Great place to film some onlyfans content.
The couch storage content gave me a jump scare😂
thank you fit inspiring me to work out and throw fruits at people <3 love you
You should collab with Haley Kalil :)
LOL that met gala footage was amazing.
I love The Plot in You!!! I can't believe that's your brother omfg
It was so weird to hear the voice behind the camera in the beginning, I guess I always supposed the camera was just magicaly floating around Micarah
I love you so much <3
people are saying they like the efforts she puts in her videos, but she is so talented she literally puts no effort at all lol
I wanted to give you a standing ovation on your 'Safety Comments' speech.
Where are you going to church? I'm sure there are a lot of options; hope you find something as fulfilling as what you had back home.
can you all creepy [eople leave her alone, thank you, and Micarah you are so funny and i always look foreward to you videos thank you for existing
OKAYYY. IMA NEW YORKAAA NOWWW. It make Sense
Now that you are in New York, please do some Gossip Girl fashion!
YASSSS you live in the CITY. I LOVEEEE IT I hope I see you Pride Week 💕💯
MICARAH!!! The ad before this video was the new Barbie movie trailer! And take way through the video it was interrupted by the ad for the Barbie movie again!! It feels so right!
Waiting on some Taylor swift eras costumes diy 😜
MICARAH I HAVE THE SAME GREEN GORGEOUS CORSET YOU HAVE! TWININ👯👯💚 Please tell me you also found yours at the thrift store!!
i love apartment tewers.
I'm really glad you *swore* to never cuss ☺   yeah I can't be the first one to comment that but I couldn't resist
I gotta say, i totally understand the break she needed, but I am SO happy that shes back to making videos
Look, I really appreciate that little message about privacy, but all I could focus on was "Damn, she really rocks that hairstyle" and then you mentioned us not focusing on the content of the video and then oh lol look at me contributing to that logic, yet again. Society, amiright? 😅lol love you Micarah! This is such a refreshing video, everything feels so new and colorful and 'breathable'. Also the amount of looks you sneaked in theree?? *chef's kiss* Favorite part was that little clip you inserted from the Met gala. It's always fun to see you interacting with strangers, you're always so pleasant and warm😂Anyway, excited for your new journey! 💖
Can we talk about how Micarah owns New York now?!
omw to get a curtain to cover my God awful thermostat
Love your videos! Keep being your creative and whimsical self!
U... U.. U- dont like... U dont like the... U dont like the GREATEST.... The GREATEST showman???
You are amazing. So proud of you. And my oldest son (3 years old) laughed so many times espically at the ABC joke 😂😂
You are awesome
How do I hire Micarah to decorate my house with street homegoods?
How do you get the fish eye lens to only effect your shins and feet?     Nifty!
Oh, you should hook up with some sort of “security company for a sponsored ad in your videos
wait did micarah not bring gereon or did i just not see him?
i love how micarah went from the city with the most bedbugs in america to the city with the second most bedbugs in america. micarah loves bedbugs
I love the Appartement and every outfit is so good but the one she wears during the beginning of the safety speech. The green one. It's so pretty
Imagine having to pee in the middle of the night and having to climb down the ladder and back up 😭😭
Love that dress you're wearing on the balcony 😍 also great to have a balcony in NY. God bless, Dora
I love you and your videos, you always seemed quick witted and pretty intelligent. Then you said you were moving to NY city.  😮
I love how your PSA has a bat in the background scratching (or it's just Gereon, idk)
Did anyone else have the irrational fear during the sponsor section that Micarah was going to knock the phone into the open toilet? No? Just me? Okay   😒😒
useless video? I disagree Micarah, this is prime entertainment
Yes Micarah is was a useless video.... and I enjoyed every second of it.
Micarah, I have to say with every video I am in awe of the time, talent and extreme creativity you put in to make them so entertaining!  But, I especially appreciate your soliloquy in today's video about choosing NOT to live your life in constant fear or paranoia.  You're right if you were a guy, no one would automatically assume that you are too naive, or worse dumb, to be aware of the "risks" you are taking to live a life you love.  As a 54 year old, I've learned through the years that in order to embrace this one life we have, you have to put fear aside and leap into the world with some knowledge, but mostly confidence and positivity.  You keep shining that beautiful light of yours ❤
omg no way ur in new york nowwwwwww i hope i run into u
This was delightful
The B on her apartment door stands for Barbie
I'm so happy you are thriving :')
Also... nic3 butt
Seeing you in workout clothes is so weird. It doesn't fit you at all, you look like a completely different person 😂😂😂
I got huge Carrie's place in SATC vibes during the balcony scene.. Micarah is already Ms Big herself but I would be very excited if she found her Mr Big (less toxic than in the series maybe) ❤
Yesssss.omg. I love you. It always irked me when people would be all "I have to blur this out so peeps don't find me" or "I can't say the name of the restaurant bc blah blah" but then go on the show the walk to the restaurant and the whole front of the building like bruh it doesn't take much to figure it out. So I am glad about everything you've said in this video about it 🎉🎉🎉
https://youtu.be/1ArqqCbMZ1s Red and black, you need more blues and oranges
I unfortunately feel the same when it comes to my safety. My first name is relatively uncommon and also is spelled differently than how most people spell it, and my last name is also uncommon and also has a different spelling than how it is normally spelled 😂 There is literally only one of me (first name last name) in the entire United States, so I’ve also been stalked before rip. I just carry a baton on me now. So sorry you have to suffer through these kinds of things too!
what's wrong with the greatest showman?
Oh my god the first name thing!!  I'm the only person with my first name/last name combo in the world and it's an unusual first name to start.   I run a group of popular charity events with the gaming community and before I realized how uhhh....the internet would turn out,  I shared my first name in an interview and did some projects under my real name that linked back to my events, then continued to do some other stuff under this name. I've had some weird experiences.  Everyone else on projects I do will get all worried about being doxxed and I'm all out here like "As long as the next angry person also sends pizza with their threatening messages to let me know they know where I live cause that was the best day ever..."
theres a dizzying amount of cuts in this video i can’t imagine how long it took to edit
how can you afford a second place to live but not a better microphone lol
Set for retirement right next to ya
We literally have the exact same table! You just were a genius and turned yours into an awesome desk and mine's just a crappy old table, but hey 😂 Hope you're having all the fun in New York
WHAAAATT?? NEW MICARAH TEWERS VIDEO????? LETS GOOOOOOOO 😎😎
The guy qt 16:31 made me actually cackle!😂😂  I love your apartment!! You always do a wonderful job making things look cool and efficient. Indeed i hope this year brings you good things and less umm.... security issues😅 so yeah i hope you're safe and have lots of weird and wonderful adventures in NYC!!❤❤❤
Its been so cool watching you grow and change and become such a power house youtuber. I'm so happy to see you thriving. You deserve it <3 <3
The thing I like most about Micarah's channel is that no matter how many times you see each video, it never gets boring. I actually return to this channel every 2-3 days and I end up watching like 10 videos at once but it's always great to see that a new video has been uploaded because no matter what type of video it is, she manages to make it entertaining. (one of the only channels that I actually watch sponsorships and that says a lot considering I have a short attention span)
Love that desk - it's super neat! Thanks for sharing it!
evil rabbit
This is reminder to please respect people's privacy!!!
Not me over here thinking the safety talk was going to be about being on a very thin balcony...cause I'm scared for her
Whats wrong with the greatest showman???
Micarah is the type of person to pick up a trendy blue couch on the side of the road
The filmography budget really went to Josh with those action shots in the park. Well done.
People tend to live in a false reality when it comes to safety. It’s usually projection of their fears, which are generally exaggerated. Love your videos, thank you for sharing 💖
She is tour guide Barbie ❤❤
Amazing tour 10/10! I figured you had some tricks up your sleeves. Fantastic table! Magnets are better than drawers.
I hope Micarah makes an exercise video next.
I love watching your videos. It's  rare that someone makes me consistently giggle! Take care of yourself, Micarah. You are a lovely person and you make so many people's lives a little brighter with your videos!❤
There is so much free stuff to do in the city, I hope you have a blast!
“Sew” and the City.
I'm glad you know the safety comments come from a place of love because I was one of those women with bad experiences who was like GURL  But I'm also glad you have secret safety measures in place! Keep at it, we love you
What an AWESOME video!!!
16:31 Oh my god this guy made me freaking LOSE IT HE IS SO RIGHT
Micarah only knows how to do one thing, and that is: live her best life.😂❤🎉
YEP.😍
How were you never allowed to see Narnia?? C.S. Lewis is literally a Christian. The book is an analogy of Bible people and things like that. I would understand Harry Potter, but Narnia?!
My gosh, finally.
This was literally THE BEST Skillshare advert ever. 10/10 would subscribe immediately if I needed it.  Also I'm glad you addressed the safety issue and that you have measures in place. I hope nothing untowards happens!
I'd be so worried about rolling off the loft area, omfg  Beautiful apartment, I'm excited to see what you do next~!
Love you use the word accountability! You have a beautiful soul. Keep rocking it!
what a wholesome local New York program
He actually sounded exactly like your dentist. It was wild.
That Skillshare ad though. 😅
I think our plucky young gal is really going to bloom and grow in this new space she has planted herself!
I have sunlight flashing through my eyes and I still fall asleep 😂
Micarah you live down the block from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Zacchaeus joke destroyed me, thank you
she is barbie she is iconic
Okay that green top slayed tho
died at the workout !! hlyfk!! LOL !!!
I think I've always been a silent watcher here, but cannot and will not stay silent anymore... YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED WATCHING NARNIA?! Girl, it breaks my heart. Go read the books, or listen to audiobooks (the movies are good but books are 11/10) Micarah, I love you and I'm telling you this for your own good DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS LACK OF NARNIAN VIBES 😭😂
Can we just talk about how gorgeous all Micarahs outfits are in this video? Also the Barbie movie premier better invite her
I have to start using the "it tells your mind your not waking up your just going somewhere else to sleep"
as someone living in Old York (Amsterdam) it is not much different <3 (high rent, rats, rich lazy people throwing out all of their furniture every wednesday)
Thank you, miss micarah for making my day better ❤
But a fire escape ladder! Theyre like emergency rope ladders that hook into a window or balcony. Fr fr.
That butterfly top is giving me Winx Bloom vibes so badly, I'd love to see Bloom costume
Such a cute place, I'm happy for you~
What a great video, I love how intense the editing is!
Amazing ✨
Great taste of music! The alphabet song is not my favorite song, but it surely is up there.
Gosh it makes me so happy to see someone i adore do so many cool things :))  The first day i moved to my apartment last august, i walked the sidewalks of our neighborhood with my friend and found a swiffer mop and a big bucket, both things i was going to buy anyhow. I love free things/trash on the side of the road 😭❤️
I'd give it a year ... too small and too expensive ... nice location tho !
If you havent been contacted by at least one celebrity to make them a Barbie-inspired dress for the Barbie premiere, ive lost faith in the world to know what good taste is
Your security talk reminded me of how suprised I was when mom told me that everyone from family she talks to is so suprised that I'm not.. afraid to go to a forest alone?? a small forest wih plenty of bikers and runners mind you??  You have to draw the security line somewhere or you'll end up scared in your house 24/7 :') I birdwatch and love plants, take frests out of my dead cold hands (and your skull damaged by heavy af binoculars)
This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for
the guy that spoke about the 3% is basaased
My name literally being Emily Smith 😭
but have you found an $8000 blue couch on the street yet???
heck yes!!!!! i adore your editing as always <33 apartment looks incredible and I can't wait to see what you get up to in New York!!!
It's the most Micarah NYC apartment ever!
I love this video.😄
Rebecca is an icon
Oh Micarah, that was so entertaining, i really mean it, I miss the ottoman though. Maybe you could hire a Turkish guy to hang around wearing cargo pants and one of those vests with all the pockets. You can probably find one teaching a Pilates class nearby!
Love. Also “Zaccheaus”, perfect. I’m glad you touched on the safety, and I do hope you only have to deal with the bare minimum creepy/stalker situations, and you have a great time in NYC!
I love New York! And I love New York Apartments! Brilliant idea to have a projector instead of a TV, it saves on space plus you can have it anywhere?! Genius. Much respect, very love.
Lowkey looks like bestdressed old apartment 😮
As someone with a double barrelled surname with both of the two names being rare and having an uncommon way of spelling each of them anyways saying you are desensitised to people easily finding you I felt in my soul.
I want a trash digging video upload 😂
Hope you're enjoying your new place! Love your matching books/tech, the fact that most surfaces can be a TV, and your revamped furniture pieces. Thanks for another wild yet interesting video!
meanwhile in sweden you can google anyone and find their address and every personal detail of their life
If I find you and throw grapes at your window, can I sleep over on your balcony?
sooo many outfits!
your sponsor ads are the only ones I can respectfully watch of any content creator ever
Micarah new york era is giving breakfast at Tiffanys vibes and were all here for it💗
i really never thought that Micarah would come to new york, but since shes here I'm holding out hope that we'll run into each other and become besties 😍
Did you sell your house in Ohio??
Would LOVE to hear Micarah unpack her hatred of The Greatest Showman (i am a fellow hater)
love the PSA you included even though I’m sad you found it necessary!! your videos are top quality and you deserve comments that reflect that!!! very taylor swift the man/lily allen hard out here of you to bring it up!!
Now I want a New York apartment
I am _ruthless_ when it comes to skipping sponsor ads in videos... except yours. I hope these brands are paying you extra for actually creating enticing ad content.  Also: you couldn't watch Narnia? It's a Christian allegory by a noted Christian essayist! What branch were you raised in?  Also also: The thing in the crowd appeared to be a plumbus.
I actually bought a sewing machine sacond hand last week - inspired by years of watching Micarah. And earlier today i thought of her chaotic yet amazing way to film and edit her videos and NOW she has blessed us with a new one! Oh happy day! Sad to see the ottoman didnt work. Does anyone know where i can get one like that?? I've been searching for months to buy something like it to use as a guestbed in my apartment
zacchaeus!!! ❤ enjoy your time micarah, take care of yourself!!
I honestly enjoy every single one of your videos!
I think this is my new fav video by you - I hope New York is so fun !!
Welcome to NYC micarah I feel honored to be breathing the same city air as you 🥲❤️
micarah i literally screamed when i saw the notification, i love love love your content, you inspire me soo much 🥰, obe day ill live in nyc too!!! working hard for it , fingers crossed !!!!
Do you need me to live with you and protect you from creepers?  I'm just selfless like that.
WHAT!! Landon is one of my favorite vocalists of all time! I never realized his last name was Tewers, let alone that he's your brother holy shit
Skillshare needs a class teaching folks how to close their toilet lid MICARAH 😜 (poo particles… from the several NY ghosts living in your apartment. I know YOU don’t personally poop.)
The cutting track is genius, I want one!
lmao the drawrer joke!
I've seen a lot of NYC studio tours and 1 thing I noticed is that there are no bathrooms or doors that would lead into a bathroom... :/  So are public showers and bathrooms just a thing in NYC studios? :/
i am batman
Honestly brings me back about 8-10 years to the good ole days of YouTube where this was just fun, silly and also letting us into her life a bit. So refreshing she makes YouTube a better place 😊  Also she’s one of the only ones whose ads I actually watch bc of her delivery and writing. ❤❤❤
If it was so useless then I was being useless watching it and quite frankly...I'm offended  #knowurworth
When you talked about the secret security measures at your house, all I can imagine are a bunch of home alone style booby traps. Of course do not deny or confirm this theory but I like to imagine it’s true.
“Evil rabbit” 😂😂😂😂😂💀 took me a minute oh bad bunny
your apartment looks like a thai restaurant that i like to eat at.  it's not in bew tork
Okay but why is that sleeping wake up hack actually brilliant
Fun fact the name “the big Apple” is actually referring to p00p on the side of the road :) NYC is just one big pile of sh1t, welcome! (I live in Manhattan too and the rent is insane)
“How many drawers does it have” 💀💀💀
the open toilet gives me anxiety having the easily overknockable phone over there...
The storm the met guy has a point tho
I feel you on the, erm.. name thing :/ This many years, you get used to it. Hey, off topic, but when you were little did you ever have the heartbreak of never finding the very shiny keychain with your name on it? Nah, me neither 🙄
I’m so excited for your time in NYC! You’re going to meet so many wonderful people, experience new art, and explore beautiful locations. This video is just the beginning!
i've seen 1.48289 billion skillshare sponsorships but this was the best one i didnt skip like usual you are amazing micarah <3 ty for providing a positive corner on the internet
The sewing table is awesome!!!
Awesome tour ! Can’t wait for your content about summer , New York is so much fun 🎉🎉🎉🎉
you make my days better 😫
While I'm always hyper aware of my surroundings I also desensitized to the danger. Like life is dangerous  done
Im a server and its why i don’t tell people my name at often (only cool gays) (this new job doesnt use nametags) sometimes they ask and i do them them but so awkward
As far as security goes at your home for some reason I hope there are many traps set akin to what is in Home Alone.
You’re my hero
My guess for the rent is $3500
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! You go babe! Your apt rocks!
AAHHAHHAHHHAAAA!!!  The SkillShare ad!!!!  Genius! Also, truly loved the extended explanation of the fact that you really do know what you're doing and have been taking your safety seriously all along.  (btw, I'm sooooooooooo tired of women forever being scared of existence.  I'm old.  I don't scare much anymore.  Indeed, I never scared easily.  Makes for a much more interesting life)  ANYway, love the apartment.  Love the vibe.  Love that you branched out.  Looking SO forward to your adventures in NYC. 💖
love that one guy who was talking about storming the met, wishing nothing but the best for them
Será que o mundo tá preparado pra
kinda living for the fact that Micarah's brother is the lead vocalist of The Plot In You 6:00
What happening with your house?
The apartment is much bigger than your RV. And your other RV. Even as a rental I bet it's way more expensive than the Ohio house
First of all, welcome to New York, I know its expensive AF in the city, but you can legit find just about anything you could possibly desire within walking or subway distance.  There are some amazing communities that exist in the city and I sincerely hope you find everything you need while here. Have fun, enjoy every moment, and if you get the chance go to the NYC Pride Parade (just remember your sun screen and water, its a long day!). Sending you lots and lots of love and healing 💜
New era queen slayyyyy love this transition for you
I love how you change your outfit after every segment it’s my favorite thing it’s hilarious
such a headach towatch video i cloulfd nt even write commente properly now
Martha Stewart?
I have no idea how I got through existing before finding this channel. Loveeeee
ugh i will never get tired of a good old micarah tewers video
my queen posted
solo women will literally breathe on the internet and get 900 comments like “it’s so sad we have to worry about safety” “you’re so brave” “ *random unsolicited advice* “like SHUT UP WHY CAN’T YOU SEE PAST MY IDENTITY AS A WOMAN AND LISTEN TO WHAT I AM SAYING IDC ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS BABE YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN A MAN!!!!
Yes.
In Paris we find antiques...some really old shit along with the average Ikea pieces.....
I loved this video! ;-;
Everyone's moving out of NY, and you're moving in?
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THAT TRANSPERANT ARMCHAIR WHERE DO I FIND IT ????
just finished every single video in your channel now i have no purpose in life but just to wait for a new video😅🤣 also GIRL your apartment is sooo cool like hello???? i really love how everything is together and lets talk about how amazing your bedroom is the chair?? the bed ?? the posters? if that doesn't scream micarah then what does?? also if you feel like some creep is following you just wear the queen outfit you made and go out and hunt them 😂
i saw this on my fyp and immediately went AAAAAAAAA NEW VIDEO!!!
So everyone just missed the part where she said she clothes her tapeworms?
Watch Chronicles of Narnia. I think a privilege of being an adult is that you can look at ideas or art different from yours and not feel you have to adopt them. C.S. Lewis has written many beautiful pieces about his Christian faith. Do not be afraid of art and literature. I personally don’t like the Barbie aesthetic and it goes against a lot of my values. But yet I love to watch you recreate dresses and looks. It’s the technique and art. I also think you are not using it to damage girls  self esteem. Quite the opposite.
the crowd for met gala was so funny! love a semi-violent crowd always
People underestimate the security of thin walls, you hear everything. i used to hear the neighbour's clock strike at night and I'd be able to tell the time. My gardenfence is quite loud so if anyone tried to climb it, I'd hear and all my cats would stampede over me out the window too. They tried to break into my neighbour's house and I can only conclude he must not have locked his gardengate.
Hiii
thanks for the tour!! loved the vid and ur humor as per usual :D hope u enjoy ur time in good ol nyc <3
New Micarah video = instant happiness 😊
... why the honest to Mr tumnus heck were you disallowed from watching Chronicles of Narnia? They are literally biblical allegory, CS Lewis was notably a Christian it is probably the most Christianly kids book that isn't explicitly about Jesus that I've ever read... That's just so silly to me
Have a great time! 🎉❤😊
Where is garian is he ok?
Not Zacchaeus 😂 …. Not Evil Rabbit 🤣🤣🤣 ….
I'm so looking forward to more adventurous chaos from NYC. Thanks for the great content and the apartment looks awesome.
I have the Zara dress in green and it doesn’t look so good on me so I never wear it 😩
I'm in awe of your broken dining table to amazing custom sewing station/desk thrift flip. Also the Skillshare commercial was so funny, I laughed the whole way through. Honestly this is the only channel where I don't try to skip the sponsorship portion.
"My building was built before fire existed" GIRL 😭
I thought the safety PSA was going to be about how low your balcony fences are, me and my busted ass sense of balance could never
I love how an event that would have been the entire focus of anyone else’s video is like a 2 second clip in Micarah’s 😆 (carnival on street)
Wait, did she move to NY bc she was in danger?
Its good your seeking new adventures and experiences and sharing with your audience. Thanks for sharing
CONGRATS AGAIN!!! exciting times 💃
Hope you do audrey hepburn outfits. Your new apartment reminds me of breakfast at tiffany's
You're so funny. Love the space! How is Gereon enjoying it?
Love the green corsety top! Hope you are enjoying your time in a new city!
Micarah, just keep swinging. May your NYC adventure draw you closer to the One who loves you best.
Micarah's living out her dream as a real life Barbie by adding the Big Apple Apartment playset, which is a New York exclusive, alongside her Happy Camper and Dream House playsets!
I love your adventurism when you watched the Met and made so many unique connections, that's so cool!
love the devor the appartment is adorable and the outfit changes are simply divine
The Plot In You! I was wondering if you were related, talented family!!!
I appreciate your comments about safety, not because I am worried about you, but because I think you make some great points about the world we live in. I wish the creepos who stalk women would get all the flack, not the women who might be targeted by them!
The best in ad segment ever!!!!
I love how u make friends everywhere :) hope your health is better now. Enjoy your new place!!!
Your humor brings me out of a bad place.
Great video overall, but the message about safety ... wow. I (and I believe many others) never imagined how intense it can get. I really admire you for not letting this take over you and your life
love ur ads so much
I loved this video its so chill and so YOU <3
Hope New York is full of amazing experiences to enrich you beyond your dreams. Go You!
congrats on your new apartment, I hope you will have a wonderful time there, and thanks for the lovely video
"Zaccheus!" 😂
Rooting for you!!!!!!
Micarah's video is like how I used to day dream in 7th grade, this must be why I like them so much 😂❤🥰
Best commercial for Skill Share!!! Totally want to check it out!!!! 😃👏
ngl, those jumps were hella impressive!
i wonder why you weren't allowed to watch narnia as a kid since it's a christian story, but to be fair i wasnt allowed to watch disney channel up until i was like 13 lol
I'm sick too Micarah 😢
You niled the Skillshare commercial to the bone! Love you girl and t&e apartment is cute! ❤
You're such an inspiration!!!
I'm just sad you didn't welcome us back "to the Tewer."
Always like 👍🏼 Micarahs videos before even watching them 😊 also Does anyone know where her bird is? 🐦
I'm so excited for this new adventure of yours! Thanks for continuing to record and make videos for us! Also I know you said not to say anything, buy just remember to stay safe and wear your sunscreen - there's sun in New York too 😂
everyone in NYC hearing that bell ring at the beginning having a heartattack   also like THANK U for saying the thing about safety and honestly pointing out the thing about how ur comments are flooded with ppl worried about ur safety bc yes like a lot of girls feel the need to point it out bc we're like "haha stick together watch out for each other" but ur 100% right about the male videos not saying that so u know what.  i'm not sayin NOTHIN
Let some of the air out of the seat you’ll be able to sit in it 😂
Excited to see your NYC adventures, will you vlog at the consignment shops? The shoes are AMAZING in NYC shops.. 10 years ago I got some Prada shoes and a couple other good brands, and I STILL have them and now my kids wear them 😂.
it looks great you always make me happy
Thank you for the Zacchaeus reference. You said it as I was thinking it and I’ve never been so happy to catch a reference.
My favourite things about this video are 'BalCOny' and 'Side of the road. Pile of garbage'
I know how it feels to move away from everything you know, sending you love it get easier the longer you’re there 💜
Micarah, i don't think you understand how important it is for you to recreate any outfit from winx club,  was tuly a magical show and the outfits just scream you❤
I feel like you get sick a lot 😅
wait but why weren't you allowed to watch the chronicles of narnia??? isn't it an actual biblical allegory? (aslan is jesus yup)
Firstly, I hope you're feeling better, voiceover you sounded really under the weather. Secondly, you have the nicest small apartment I think I've ever seen and that sofa is great. And most importantly, I really hope New York is good for you and leaves you with nothing but happy memories. You really do deserve a whole lot of joy. Thanks for the new video!
I aspire to be this funny one day
the new project reminds me a lot of  a butterfly or something from winx
I'm so happy she's having the time of her life in the city. Is she going to be doing most of her art projects in her apartment or in Ohio? Also I'm kinda jealousy (not really) that she has a barbie car, an rv, a house AND apartment like that's so cool.
😍🥰
You are my spirit animal. Cheers to shoebox living, I’m right there with you! So glad to see you living life, and thanks for inspiring me to do the same :)
❤
Another great tip for waking up early: Have a small animal that gets right up in your face at 6am and sneezes on you 💦😃
Aaaah, Micarah, I’m SO GLAD YOU WERE BORN AND THEN RAISED WITH CHICKENS xxxzxzxxxxxx
Get ur in the first hr prize here
I never thought I'd want a yellow couch but now I NEED ONE
micarah in nyc.. didnt she just buy a house?
YOUR STYLE IS IMPECCABLE
So interesting seeing the Met Gala from the perspective of the locals - "3% of the country's wealth is in front of us rn, and we haven't stormed it"   Edited: just wanted to say that this is kind of a paraphrase as opposed to a direct quote, but the sentiment really hit me. In a few different ways
wooooah city guuuurl perhaps one day i will run into a wild Micarah~
3:51 pure oxygen in new york?
You’ll love New York!
We love a serotonin boost on Saturdays ❤
Your stairway is giving me Breakfast at Tiffany's vibes and I'm so here for it
It would have invariably been a grape day when you were just randomly walking in the vicinity of Micarah's balcony and then you suddenly felt a grape hit you that was presumably spat by an invisibility superpowered Micarah.
This was not a useless video. This is one of your creative outlets and you use it creatively! Loved it ❤
The not having a fire escape thing is real. I was very surprised when I moved to NYC and was told my options in the event of a fire were basically a trapdoor to the roof or jumping from my window 😅 (my oven actually did catch fire my first day, but that's another story).
that block on the bedroom upstairs is so clever bcs I would probably roll off the bed and fall to my death if I had none there :D
It's honestly the most Barbie thing for Micarah to have an apartment, a dream house, a camper, a car, a scooter and a birb.
I’m so excited for this New York journey for you ❤ it’s a an incredible place hope you grow so much
just wanna say, this video is very good and edited to perfection
You needed a change after massive heartache. This will renew your creativity and help foster the new version of yourself. Remember your values and stay true to you!
Micarah Tours strikes again
This was the best house tour to house toured
Why are ads the best parts of these videos? That skillshare ad made me want to get it...
I'm a little upset. I wanted an apartment tewer. Not an apartment tour....  In all honesty this was a great video. The perfect amount of micarah chaos, but also really fun and aesthetic!
Now Micarah needs a whist from the apartment guy!
i cant wait for more videos !!
The wake up advice is actually pretty great
Micarah I miss uuuu
The fact that I got the trailer of the Barbie movie as an ad on Micarah’s video is truly fate. I’m going to be immensely disappointed if execs don’t do their due diligence and invite Micarah to the premiere.   So great to see you thriving in NYC btw!  P.S.: Thank you for addressing the safety issue yourself… ngl, that’s the first thing that came to my mind too. 😅 Sorry, just want my fellow women to stay safe and vigilant and it’s excellent to hear that you are. 💜
It’s a gorgeous little place, and can I just say - I have never enjoyed a Skillshare ad more. I still won’t join it, but I enjoyed your ad for it. Very creative and entertaining.  I moved into a small apartment in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, and I am learning very quickly that same lesson - everything needs to double as storage!
i’m so happy for you micarah! i love the apartment smmm!!! ilysm and wish you the best 🫶🏼
I love the couch! I love that yellow😍
Micarah please try theater or acting I think you'd do well!
Love this for you. Already a new energy😊
The child of Barbie and Kate McKinnon.
OMG! He DID sound exactly like your dentist!
Take a moment to appreciate how much effort Micarah puts into these videos. I can't imagine a world without her channel 💖✨✨
As a fellow NYC trash forager, it truly is like a Home Goods every weekend, especially in May-September when the seasonal migrations hit.   Will Micarah get into Freegan foraging? That nabe has spectacular finds.
I really pray that Micarah is living her best NY life and is feeling better. Thanks for the Smiles M! Your work makes a lot of people happy!
Have fun in NYC! Love the video and not concerned about your safety at all gorg! 😜
Omggg love ur apartment it is so u
This girl is so talented! ❤
Love the tour!! I think you're going to have SO much fun in NYC!!
Apartment B for Barbie 😌
16:20 its a girl... or Jared Leto?
That everything needs to be storage thing was FELT. Lived ina 540sqft studio. Definitely needed everything to be storage and feel like their own space
i just had an idea! would it be okay if i threw you a new keurig onto your balcony for fun? or maybe leave it conveniently on the side walk? for science :)
Very much not useless video. I'm moving into a tiny apartment right now and I'm craving videos about it by other people. But they're either pretty regular size or like a closet in Tokyo so I'm very thankful for this, I've been waiting.
Looks like a lovely neighbourhood. You're going to have an amazing year ❤
Glad you’re being safe! Love you so!!🥰😘💖 If you need anything, let all of us know!
Wait, will you get a NYC PO box?? I wanna send fanmail!!
Narnia are my favorite books and movies honestly with CGI the way it is now I'd love for a redue of the movies
Love the apartment. Have a great time in New York!
I caught the last few seconds, and somehow didn't question that it ended in less than a minute. 😅  Watching from the beginning now that I figured it out! 😂  Yup, watched, and thoroughly enjoyed! Seems like you're having a blast! 😊
That was a really good video
another missed opportunity to call this an apartment TEWER smh
😂❤🎉 smiling the whole way through! NYC watch out! She’s arrived!!
Im so glad your having fun Micarah and I hope you continue to have a great time  Awesome vid i had a lot fun watching it!
“the fact that 3% of americas wealth is in there and we haven’t stormed the met gala yet” BAHAHHA icon
The growth, we love to see it!
Another banger from Marinara!
hahaha what an ending
Love it
i wanna live in the loft bedroom
"The fact that 3 percent of America's wealth is in front of us and we haven't stormed the Met yet...." I mean....we couldn't even storm Area 51.
okay, question. do you ever get scared that when you're asleep you're just going to roll off the loft...  i know its a very weird thought to have but that was all i could think about when i saw your bedroom
How are almost all of the tewers sibling famous?
I worked in retail for 3 years and I refused to wear my nametag, why do you even need one?
Stoked for this new leg of your life journey! Massive couch envy! Your dropleaf table gives me guilty vibes because you actually finished it, instead of having a half cut pile of wood. whoops...
im so happy for you micarah!!! youre glowing
My safety concern for you was in regards to bed bugs
The apartment has SO much personality! It looks perfect Micarah ❤️
Everything could be a tv if you try hard enough
Your apartment is so functional and pretty!
Micarah, have you considered having your sewing table design manufactured and for sale? It is really excellent in spite of not having drawers.
Everyone should hire Micarah to do their commercials, really
There’s something both confusing and random yet hilarious about her vids.
Get your early ticket here! ⬇
This video is so chaotic…and i love it.
Absolute love seeing Micarah thriving and growing 😊❤
Yay! I'm so happy she uploaded a new video❤❤❤❤
Micarah changes outfits so easily…she nailed the Barbie Quick-Change thing 😂
That cat bag is going to haunt me, I swear
Hello micarah!!!!
I love your videos Micarah!!
Oooh I'm so excited
Finally! Ive been dying for an update
That's a LOVELY couch there
giiiirrrrrllllllll. literally can't believe you are here in nyc. i always loved watching your midwest lifestyle, seeing you living where i live how kinda messes with my head lol but i LOVE IT!!! please reach out if you ever need a feisty friend to clap back at all the weirdos making passes at you on the street!!
Does Micarah rhyme with Shakira?
No words can describe how happy I get when I see that Micarahs posted ❤
:o even from just the thumbnail i can tell the apartment looks so pretty
It’s so nice ❤
EE she's back!
Ooh I can't wait for all the new york shenanigans!
Hi michara
