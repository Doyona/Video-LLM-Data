No one’s talking about how Payton Pritchard hit a 35 footer when the end the the game came? 💀
This is the win of the year
Nice game
Celtics is praying that the warriors wont mke it from the west

The Warriors are the best NBA team!!! 🎉❤
I have watched the Bos vs Gsw finals, and Warriors still take victory. As a Warriors fan, I am proud of the Golden State Warriors.
Hah i like that they display on how far currys 3s are
9:23 that final shot that didn't count was crazy lol
IDC then Celtics won't be beating the warriors no time soon
Lmfao warriors aren't making the playoffs thats facts
If the Celtics could play some defense that would be awesome 👌
Thank you, May God bless you and everyone. ❤
Warriors is another level. 🔥
The warriors are in 11th place!???????? Wtf?? HOW?! How are the defending champs in next to last place?!?!?!
Game 8 😂🔥
look at Curry man ….
7:40 and 6:08 wtf we doin here refs ?
Rob Williams the new bill Russell comon g rooting for you to pull through
The lakers should’ve watched this before the played
Did he really say "Larry Thompson???"
Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown are our 2 franchise players. Them 2 together is unbelievable especially that they built up there chemistry. Boston better not get rid of them and there still young. In my opinion there still rising to there prime years, they will be great players for a while as long as they stay together and help each other out. If one of there game is off and the other one is hot uark who to run the game off and vice versa. There the #1 team in the whole NBA right now so there the team to beat. Boston usually has the best teams in any sport. Not just saying that cuz I'm from Massachusetts but we do have the best teams. Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox, and Bruins they all have rings and I think in a 12-14 year span they all won one in there own sport Patriots had 4, Sox 2, Celtics 1, and Bruins 1-2 name another team that has done that.
Refs really hate the Warriors 😂 sheesh
Hi
Curry on top🎉🎉🎉
Great to see Steph Curry and his franchise battle it out against the Warriors.
Wow I was thinking Blake Griffin wasn’t doing much but the stats said he had as much as Marcus Smart!!
Tatum’s move just after 1:20 where he fakes the shot then makes the quick dribble move… wow!
The fact that curry turned around when he shoots, dude is unreal.
Curry was playing like it was nothing shesh he is a cheat code
Dope
If anyone wants it 2:52
geez

I live in roseville ca...so much blacked  out I am a big warrior fan..for years..love the warriors..nancy
They didn’t even give Celtics their 3 points 1:24 seconds left in the game
Fantastic game
i am a warriors fan and i love it that they won
7:41 😆😆😆
Number 0 on warriors when he flipped got the ball back and scored looked like he said eat my ass
di man lang lumamang ang mga hinayupak na no. 1...
Kaminga is much better than people think!
What happened to “Draymond gettin traded this year?”
"Hello Klay Thompson"
Let's gooo warriors
If you think the Warriors needed KD to beat LeBron, you’re a dick puller & blind the greatness of the Big 3 of GSW.
jason tatum should switch to the suns so they can their regular season energy together
I’m glad they showed how many feet that last shot was even though it was outta regulation.
And people said Klay was washed? He’s a beast.
Curry might be the Celtics kryptonite
Curry might be the Celtics kryptonite
the fact that the entire arena gasped when jaylen committed an obvious up and down is crazy, and what’s even more crazier is that the ref just let it slide 😂
Let’s goooo😎💙#WARRIORS #4XChamps
Did anyone see the dude at the end drain the shot after time expired 😮‍💨😮‍💨

Celtics are fugazi
The crowd in Aww 7:40
The problem with the Celtics is that they are team of ALL GUARDS! Heck even Griffen plays a wing shooting guard! Horford is basically a shooting guard too. Got to dump some of these guards off. Maybe get rid of Brown and Pritchard and their center Williams too for an AD level guys and they will be much more effective.
When Carrie is shooting deep is there a measurement saying 30 and 35 ft while he changed the game for real
I would not want to be guarding Steph! He is SO GOOD it’s RIDICULOUS! 💯😂🙌
JT MVP candidate right.   18pts though. 😕
Blacks Mexicans and native Americans We are God chosen people the real Hebrew Israelites of the earth we are the real Jews repent
That ref blew that call on Brown. If it wasn't a travel it was a jump ball because the ball was never out of Brown's hands it was just simultaneously possessed by the defender, thus a jump ball, but, without the jump ball call it's a travel. Terrible.
1.7 MILLIONS VIEWS IN A DAY AND THE PRODUCERS AT ESPN AND FOX WONT TALK ABOUT IT FUCKING SHAME
7:42 clear travel. Zoom in for a better look, everybody
They had to remind Boston that we still our the world champions 🏆 steph curry is something the world never seen before ! It's Unbelievable the gift God bless him with
Mike Breen "Celtics on a 3pt struggle bus..."🤣🤣🤣
I still feel bad for J Poole. How good do you have to be for people to care when your teammate punched tf out of you? People really just said "well we were never supposed to see that." That's not a good excuse at all wth?
Tatum chokes under pressure. He really needs to build his confidence as leader of this team. His teammates feeds off his energy. Turnovers are caused by a lack of concentration and ball security. Not being able to make easy baskets I'd also a lack of concentration and confidence. You can't teach confidence, that's mental. He has to build that himself by getting over his fears.
Wow our defense effort of getting rebounds was horrible. Maybe because Al Horford wasn't in.
They can’t fuck with us 😂
Lights out shooting by the dubs!....the dynasty is real
7:40 that's either a up and down or travel
Go Warriors, beat those Celtics
That's what I'm talking about! Warriors looked like champions in this game.
I wish they would include some defense in these highlights. I was at this game and Klay made a great pin block on Tatum that's not here. Also Draymond had a great steal that's not here either.
Kuminga is going to be a whole problem if he continues to get minutes and stays healthy! He’s already in good company!
Klay looking like old klay
Celtics defense needs to step up
Steph is the GOAT.
They win championships and they keep tearing up the team to start over, and they do nicely, would have been the greatest dynasty ever if they could just keep the pieces together.
13-13 and still got them C’unts number 😂
Outstanding win by the Dubs! One win at a time. We are starting to gel with the second unit, very encouraging. Before we know it, we will be head and shoulders with the Suns for the #4 seed. We are coming!
7:42 Did Jaylen Brown Travel??
The warriors being able to hold Tatum without Wiggins is very impressive
Warriors prove time and time again. No matter what seed they are, they will always rise to the occasion.
Splash brothers.. on full display
Tje disrespect is crazy
Steph:I wanna time machine and fight the 1992 dream team. Press: but your fighting the greatest teams of today!!!  Steph: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣(yells at the NBA Organization) "I WANNA FIGHT THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME" WHO CAN BEAT MY TEAM IN A SWEEP, LEBRON MAYBE, BUT AFTER THE KING WHO CAN GIVE THAT CHALLENGE? I WANT MY TIME MACHINE NOW"🤣🤣🤣
boston's nightmare 😂😂
Some of the lamorinda soccer players don’t even like Masood Ahmadi   Some of the miramonte high school soccer players don’t even like Masood Ahmadi    Obviously some of the lamorinda soccer players are lying or lied  Obviously some of the miramonte high school soccer players are lying or lied   They lied  Dylan Kronenberg is lying
Blake would be a great linebacker in that jersey 🤣
Top seed of the conference vs the World Champion! Great game by the warriors!
You Celbricks can't F with the Bay Area get that through your skin heads lol.

Curry💪
Stop showing the distance he hits for 3 it takes the shock value out of it
The Dubs are my my squad , but Tatum cooked tf outta draymond at the 1:23 mark.
Warriors are the most entertaining team
Jordan poole saw some cute girls
After i saw the whole game the celtics team did not make any differences from last year that they lost the finals to curry how coul you allow just them two killing you guys so easy curry and thompson and jason tatum got shut down or you can say he got intemidated by the GSW D IF YOU GUYS CELTICS want to go back to the finals you guys must improve every every phase  of the game offense defense espeially  EXCECUTE the game plan the right way you must play super  defense to contain the two killers thompson and curry you guys defense was too slow  you allow the shooters curry and espescially  klay have too much spaces to shoot you must match the intensity you guys celtics were not ready to compete against the GSW they are too much for the celtics.
GS is deeper this Year. They're clicking on all cylinders now and Klay looks like he has his legs back under him. Great Win 💪
They might mess around and win it again tbh.
Curry isn't missing a damn thing 🤣😭. Crazy range bruh
Celts and Warriors were luck Khris Middleton was injured last year
My boi JT still giving it %120 at a game even when he loses.
You can tell GS got up to play The C’s
Kuminga literally gets pushed down lol 6:14
Steph Curry used to be one of my favorite players to watch years ago......... and he still is.  😎😎😎
That Blake Griffin drop coverage really hurt the Celtics this game. GSW was feasting on it.
You can tell Steph gettin up there in age 😂
Golden State getting another ring this year. They're just too good
25-30 plus Klay awareness
7:39 they called this bull shit against steph but when brown obviously does it no call wtf
The media kept saying Tatum and brown best duo... man shut up its still klay and steph
Incredible
poole is getting so good.
That 35ft shoot at the end 🔥
When does Wiggins come back? They'll need him for this brutal road trip coming up.
Once again JT looked scared out there smh
Look at Klay man, so inspirational.
Typical boston team led by jayson tatum..it chokes when playing gsw
Brown should have been called a up and down
Klay plays O and D effectively, the Dubs are hard to beat.  Not sure what his +/- was but for sure it was +
Tri it it's all for GSW
Tatum ratulon😜
Lmfao get shiiiiiit on Boston 😂😂😂
Celtics never able to outscore them, Warriors made it look easy to defeat the team that has the best record this season.
Big fan of the bridge lol
Hi guys
No fair they only marking curry shots
Whelp we know the warriors are beating the celtics again in the finals, lets just hope the warriors dont get there.
Im a warriors bandwagon , but seeing Tatum and brown have even better chemistry is dope to see
Curry an Thompson greatest shooters of the decade!!
Could someone explain what happened at 7:42 please
Klay finally gave 88% effort, on offense. Klay ONLY shows his true power, in big games. That's why his nickname is GAME 5 KLAY. That literally means, he shows up in the biggest games, of EVERY season 🐐💯
When the celtics lose everybody wins
Tatum doing tatum things, being non-existent Vs the warriors
I’m convinced that the Golden State Warriors only care playing certain teams, this was by far their best effort this year. and the Boston Celtics have been on a run lately.and this game didn’t even look close.
No one gonna talk about how after the buzzer sounded Prichard hit almost a half court
Zero to add.  Not my thing.  Maybe Bob saw it.  Boston Celtics,yes??
If the Warriors continue to play like this defensively the rest of the year, they won't lose very much the rest of the season.
Warriors conditioning is top tier..but you can’t allow them to rest while on defense…the opposition needs to have equal player and ball movement
One game doesn't dictate anything, GG to both teams Celtics are coming for the 18th banner
where was wiggs?
This game could do serious damage to the Celtics psyche.
That loser troll Barkley must be in pain and nowhere in sight every time Klay makes a performance and the team wins. LOL.
Wardell Curry is thee best player in the world been saying it the last 4 years
Curry hitting the buzzer then look away :🔥💯
Why you marking Steph curry’s 3pt shots it’s not like we care
How can you even guard curry if he shoots very far with the big man screening him? You need like 3 people to defend him.
Just remember folks. They did all this without Wiggins. Sheesh
Wow Ms. Chrassengale, Celtics sure for those cheeks clapped, eh?!
Klay's getting back & the bench players are also getting better...they almost won against Jazz a few days ago without Curry, Wiggins, & Green...so we knew what they're capable of.
Klay's defence is 💀
No Wiggins either?? Damn
Imagine trying to figure out how to beat Steph and Klay...and then they sign Poole.
The word bubbles on stephs threes is really annoying
Just a casual “Steph” back 30 foot no look buzzer beater to end the first. Dude is bonkers
Warriors  are beasts
😷🙂
5:58 editor did smart dirty
Tatum Does nothing but shows me  the fact that this team isn’t shit without JB
hey siri play back to back by drake bcz thats what warriors bouta do💯🏆
MR.UNGAURDABLE (Curry)
wow the warriors lost to the pacers and magic and the celtics STILL can’t beat us
Always good for a win
Curry’s such a certified bucket they got how many ft he shooting from all most every time love to see it ‼️🔥🔥🔥
NBA I LOVE NBA 2007 2004 2003 NBA
The officiating in this game was pathetic
GOLDEN STATE SIEMPRE SERAN PAPA GLOGLOGLO
Love the steph curry footage markers
The Celtics still can't do anything with the play style of the Golden State warriors & A.W. didn't even play 🔥🏀
and they didn’t even have Wiggins
Definitely without All in the paint the Celtics play worst.
Warriors vs Celtics NBA Finals 2nd Straight year
I like how nba put some editing in it @3:02 days 30+ Ft
Warriors vs Dallas western conference finals
Draymond's one strong suit.....,, being able to tell him teammates GOOD JOB for THEM making a play.   Holy s*** is Draymond terrible on offense. And boy has his defense took a turn for the worst. How is it a 6'3 point guard is outplaying him in every category, except blocked shots (which is pretty close considering the rolls). Draymond can't even catch as many boards, or allow fewer points from the person his job is to guard.  Wouldn't be sad to see Draymond go. Definitely wouldn't be upset seeing him shut his mouth every once in a while either.
Celtics knows who's your daddy
隐隐约约隐隐约约有 尼nyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyn
Another Tatum no-show on the big stage
terrible refs
they need to stop showing Curry's distance. It's distracting.
Warriors weird move dancing mid-game at 7:42
Best reaction  https://youtu.be/39Yzb-uJSyY
9:09 they didn’t even add bro points 💀
So Boston is Tatum's team right until they GSW?
happy to see the splash brothers back their old selves again!
1.2 million views om 12 hrs we clearly know who the fans love to see
So happy to see Klay playing insanely good recently
Let’s go Dub Nation
Klay heard all da talk
Wow....! That was a great game. Warriors look championship ready. Klay is getting better and better. Steph is just awesome 🙂
Steph and Klay better stay in sync
Anyone can win during a regular season. Only a few teams know how to play when and how they want to when it REALLY counts. 💍🏆😂
The crazy part is I just seen a poll a couple days ago asking what duo r ppl taking between the jays or splash bros and majority ppl chose the jays with tht good reason but this was a statement game for the splash bros not to ever count them out
CeLtics fans so salty rn
Everyone praying CeLtics would win this game are soooooooooo mad right now lmao 🧂 and about to commit suicide 😂
Boston shot themselves out in PHX. Whenever you see a team score crazy points and slow up, the next game they are off. In all sports you see this.
NIGHT NIGHT BOSTON. FOREVER
definitely been lackin on my 2022 nba upkeep but wtf is blake griffin doing on the celtics. i saw this man at tipoff and i was dumbfounded
Kerr knows what he is doing. Curry and Thompson gets plenty of playing time but he doesn’t do back to back next day games. The younger players get lots of playing time.The warriors will be in the playoffs with a young core who have had plenty of playing time to get prepared and Curry and Thompson who are always prepared. The goal is that they will be well rested and not have lingering injuries from too many back to back games. The warriors are preparing for another championship run.
This single win by the Warriors proves that they still own the league. They babysit the Celtics boys.
You can put 2 guys on Steph and he will still make the 3 or 2.    When that happens there is also an unguarded man waiting for the ball for an easy 3 or 2.
The Splash Bros Are Absolutely On Fire 🔥
Yo low key sleeping on wat the celtics did in the offseason and the the team they already had💯 then they got blake and malcom plus other scrappy guards and having horford and williams
When Klay and poole do their part, warriors are still the best team out their.
Looney be traveling 😂
U can tell by the play if this game dat these teams been at it before lol jaylen brown and Tatum tag teaming Draymond and both of em play above the rim is funny thing and they both similar and got a shot on em😂
As long as the Celtics playing these warriors with prime Steph and Klay, they’re not winning any championship!!!
I'm a die hard Celtics fan but NBA fan first with that said curry and Klay nice they got it and healthy nobody stopping that unless u close they're lanes but once they get the rest of them team scoring outside them there's nothing you can do, turnovers will always kill u against them,you can never sleep they're bench you just gotta give credit where it's due they are well rounded when it counts   Side not ain't shit rigged about curry game 🎯 thats all work and practice
Well! When you get out scored in the first quarter and the third quarter. Is how you lose games
How tf you lose without Wiggins on the team? Their second best defender was out and you lost in double digits?
Brown carrying Tatum yet again
Tatum is not a top 5 player. I'll say it again. He's not better than Donovan Mitchell. Stop putting him ahead of Mitchell
why did they let him double what the hell
hopefully the warriors make the playoffs i would love to see these two teams in the finals again
as a celtics fan, ya the result is obvious they would lose again to gsw, smh
Boston got the biggest big 2
Andrew Wiggins was a beast tonight
8:23 "three point struggle bus" 😆
So is Klay still washed? 😂😂The D (as you can see) will come back. It’s takes years to recover from acl and Achilles. He’s making it happen though.
It was not a fluke STRENGTH IN NUMBERS 😤
Maybe it's fools gold
first time klay showed up this year 😂
People forgetting that our no 2 pick wiseman is not nba ready yet Wiggins is still out and andre igudaula hasn't even played yet 🤣🤣
Referees went from calling everything to calling nothing
You can tell who only watches one team in this comment section
Look at my nigga curry man so inspirational
The Warriors woke up vs the Celtics and the Celtics fell asleep. They went back to being still and playing ISO in the 2nd half. They need to use Pops method for the Warriors, he always has the team moving and the defensive sets change constantly so they never get a rhythm.
I called it, Warrior's fans were sayin that GSW would get smacked, but it was the Celtics who got smacked, this was a test & they failed horribly, Suns isn't no real threat, if they end up in a finals rematch I'm not even gonna watch it, just like I didn't last year, it's not like they lost by single digits, they got beat the fuck up 🤦🏿‍♂️ I swea I don't wanna see the same team win again, they win, I'm done watchin, it's like when it was the Cavs, or Heat every year, it becomes predictable & that ruins the entertainment about it
Warriors are in their heads
Nets cant beat the Celtics, and the Celtics cant beat the Warriors 💁🏾‍♂️
Get off the court Celtics 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Once again curry and Thompson can destroy any team
I’m just here for the Tatum won’t ever break this curse squad, acting as if there were superstars that never had challenges rather it be lebron and honesty/Celtics Jordan and gambling /Larry bird  or even Steph curry’s ankles challenged him a bit early. It will be alright congrats on the dub but keep hating
2:57 8:41 Curry has THAT much confidence, turned before the shot goes in TWICE in one game.
But somehow the GS not even making the play in tournament 😮 The problem with this GS team this year is that they’re not hungry enough they still full from that championship last season. That’s why they’re going no where this year plus they not a good road team this season
Klay Thompson is on Fire🔥 & Splash Brothers lead da WARRIORS💦 Golden State Warriors can WIN BACK to BACK CHAMP🔥💦
These two teams here MIGHT make the finals again. If healthy enough it's a lock for the Warriors to make it, can't say that about the Celtics because there is Milwaukee.
Haters will say it’s fake 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Why don't they ever call fouls for Steph at the rim. it's always at the 3 point line. Look at Steph's FT numbers and compare it to Harden or Kyrie. it's just disrespect.
Wow the no call by brown
STOP saying the Celtics are 1# offense.....how is there offense against G.State....when  they can beat Good Team constantly then we can have the conversation 🤬
The warriors defense is so underrated
Celtics are world beaters until they choke against the warriors. Like every time
Wow Tatum killed it
8:31 I wonder how they calculate these 3 point distances. If top of the arc 3 is 22 feet then Steph's 27 footer looks more like 24 or 25 feet. But then I'm looking at Draymond before the pass and he's almost 40 feet from the hoop. I do know the NBA be lying to ooh and ah the fans 🤣
9:01 i missed this part of the game. how did this 3 pointer not result in the celtics having 3 more points but did result in the warriors having 2 fewer points?
Aye! Golden State Warriors 🎉🏀🏆 🥇🏀
This is going to be a great rivalry for years to come. Curry is something else goat 🐐
6:26 klay and Tatum racing to the transition looked like me and my sister racing for front seat as kids
I feel like there's some finals trauma at play here
If Tatum pulls this bullshit against La he better be bench to start the game
Draymon was getting cooked all game 😭
I'm a Celtic's Fan but they got spanked by they're abusive Father and he really did a number on Tatum's physique WOW 😲😳 daddy please don't spank me again. Celtic's defense is subpar from last year.
warriors is the best team ever☺️👏💯
Celts looked road weary and flat. They’ll be fine.
🔥
When both Klay & Steph are on fire, the Warriors are unstoppable.
It’s been a long time since I’ve watched BBall but I never remember it being this slow and boring!
Gamstor stor out final out out
AM I BUGGIN OR CELTICS GOT NO FREE-THROWS SMH LOL
Steph isn't human, Marcus Smart is an offensive liability!!!
The Boston Celtics is the better team...They just don’t know it. Once they realize this fact... They will reign to become the 2023 NBA Champs.
Am I the only one who saw them not give Pritchard his 3 points 9:03
4 straight Ls to the same team! Tatum is not the MVP. I can give a damn about their record that Milwaukee will surpass in the next 3 games.   How y'all let a 14-13 team wash y'all again?!?? Revenge game my ass. HOLD THAT L BOSTON 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂  And I hate GS 😖
to all the celtics hate comments, yea we played bad. but, we're a young team and we make mistakes. props to GSW winning and the splash bros for dropping 66 pts combined. plus we're gonna go back to the finals and win
As Gsw fan. I was expecting Celtics to owning Gsw but I was surprised.   Kuminga dunking over Tatum. Burn! Lol.
🔥🔥🏀
Jaylan brown and Jason Tatum need to stop pushing off mad annoying
5:11 that was a refresher  comeback! imagine  getting 2 embarrassing turnovers and  they  really needed that  shot  to  get  their  confidence back  on the  court!! STEPCURRY IS  NO DOUBT  PHENOMENAL! MY  FAVOURITE NBA LEGEND 💯
Klay definitely back
The Warriors are just a bad match-up for the Celts.
Nah why the ending so funny why they do tatum like that
The only way the Celtics can beat the warriors in the finals, would be by some how acquiring Kevin Durant 🐍🐍👑
& Klay not in the Top 75 (76)!
Looks like the Warriors bytch slapped Tatum and the team again. Great job JB always up for the fight.
G.S. is our team to beat!! We have to tighten up and get around their stoppage towards our fulfillig our plays and follow throughs. We gotta figure them out.
That embarrassing turnover moments  that  happened twice  was being outdone  by Steph Curry's 30ft long 3point shot!! That  was  phenomenal!
I am excited for the playoffs after this showing by the warriors.
7:44 yo was that not up and down
Warriors 2023 champions again watch I’m falling it right here right now….
Them Celtics got a little too cocky after beating the Suns LOL
lol @ all the Warriors fans, acting like they just won the championship after this game.  🤣
Splash Bros In Sync 🔥
That up & down was crazy
I knew warriors went to the NBA playoffs
Warriors
He got 31 points
Making buckets yesterday
My boy curry
9:26 was the best shot 🤣
And even with all those turnovers they still brought it back now that's what I'm talking about! Go Warriors! But try to work on the turnovers
Wow. Incredible. Well hey ain't gotta be afraid of the Celtics anymore. Lol. Warriors proved that tonight. Bravo. Congrats! Go Warriors! But what I don't understand is how you can lose to the worse team in the NBA yet beat the best one. Don't make any sense at all but hey oh well. What the Warriors did to the Celtics they need to do to Booker and the Suns and even the Grizzlies when they play. Make it look easy just like tonight, kick some ass lol.
The warriors has been dangerous for so long they just keep getting more lethal 💯🤪
Some one going to tell the Celtics that stupid drop coverage isn’t it again the warriors ???
@ 1:13 what happened to defensive 3 seconds? Blake was in the paint for 5 seconds without guarding anyone! If y’all gonna call all the travels, call EVERYTHING!
ito ang nakakatakot dito, kaya ng warriors manalo sa #1
I’m ashamed to call myself a warriors fan. I was skeptical of them winning againts the celtics knowing they were taking it to another level this year. But here we are.
Splash Bros 😤
If Klay was this healthy last year, its a sweep or 4-1. Played a solid 2 way game.
I LOVE THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF JK
Warriors like “ hell we not making playoffs lets beat them now why we can “ lmao
Warriors really needed that dub.
Not even close, i don't see the warriors loosing against the Celtics this season
These dudes really played drop coverage against Curry😭
Only reason why this game was even a game is because the warriors bench is 🗑️... An Boston needs Williams to return before the playoffs because they have no big body down low and it shows..
Klay went crazyy!! Without him they would’ve lost for sure
Love Looney, he always contributes.
Warriors are a bad match up for the Celtics. Curry doesn’t have to play defense against their PGs. All of his energy can be focused on offense.
I would hate to guard steph hollllyyyy shhhiiiittttt
When klay hits his shot warriors win. Klay gotta step it up
Tatum said Dam again after the Game
Thompson 🔥💯
Always nice watching Boston loose
St3phen .why did yoo know papapas are desd
Why didn't yoow your dady
Celtics are regular season champion lol, Tatum fold so hard when matters. They basically rely on other team stars have bad game
Putting distance marks when Steph shoots a 3 is annoying
IDC what people say, he helped pioneer position-less basketball, he's the undisputed greatest shooter of all time, Steph Curry the goat 🐐
Wow
the 2016 splash brother is back?
I'm a celts fan and you can see a big difference in the offensive sets  between the warriors and c's. Its not hard to watch their videos and copy a few of their rotations they run on offense. If the C's need someone to do that, I'm available.
Does the Warriors have the Celtics' number?
Mahirapan talga Boston sa wariora
This is an important game for both teams
The number 1 joke team ever 🤣🤣🤣.
Warriors still the favorites. Don’t get it twisted
• The Fact That The Whole Stadium Seen Dat Jaylen Brown Travel 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:13 you can see Williams and Brown argue on who was supposed to guard Curry. Once you start arguing like this, you are going to lose
I love Jayson Tatum but he's just isn't that dude when it comes to big games or big moments..... that's why I always had a huge problem when people put him over KD and I just can't cause he reminded of that player he was last year in the finals......So right now Giannis is running this MVP race now and it's his to lose
Beating a good team without Wiggins is a good sign that championship hangover.is over.
Good game. This year is starting to look like last year, get in the playoffs, stay healthy and then dominate. Go Warriors
Damnnn Curry range is insane 🔥
When playoffs come I can't wait for the Nets to sweep the Cs
Warrior's showing that championship medal
Tatum got shut down
Go Warriors 💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💙💛💛💙💙💛💛💛💛💙💙💙💙💙💛💛💛💛💙💙💛💛💙💙💙💙💛💛💛💛
Throttled them. Good job boys.
proud daddy of the celtics😏
Should consider starting brogdon agains the warriors since everybody on the Celtics starting lineup is scared besides Jb and brogdon lol

Its Like Tatum Is Scared Against Them. Im a Celtics Fan And This Game Showed Me They Still Wont Win It All, Tatum Was Bricking Everything And Just Did Not Look Like Himself. Brown Has Been The Better Of The Two So Far This Year. And The Record Proves Nothing. Hopefully They Figure It Out Or Else Its Guna Be Another Long Summer.
Thompson and kuminga have been amazing for us !! I’ll take losing to the pacers and jazz ANYDAY ! After beating the nbas BEST the Celtics !!!
Can we talk about brown just jump and didnt get a call that one was hilarious then the ref just clap it out
Wtf ref.
Heck of a time to find your rhythm as a team 😂
.
Bruh they really taking advantage of this game. I've watched 8 ads already 🥲
I will be calling Brian Scalabrine tomorrow morning and clowning  🤡 him tomorrow about his precious Boston Celtics
Steph just takes all the strength away from opposing teams.
Congrats Warriors 🤗💙🏆💪 Great WIN 😎 and So far this is the Biggest Win by the Warriors this season 👏👏. Against the red hot Celtics but Never Understimate the Heart of a Champion 🏆🏆🏆🏆  Also What a Game by the Splash Brothers 😎👏💙 and the rest of the team, most especially to Kuminga, Divenzezo 😎💪🏆
Klay Thompson is already back  Splash bro is already back Ladies and Gentlemen
As a die hard fan for the warriors I believe they just started the season off wrong. I knew they were gonna turn up this season. Trust me they are gonna finish this season strong.
The "Splash Brothers" are back!
How is tatum in mvp convo if he can't perform when they need him?
How many coaches do the Warriors have😳🤯😂
Curry making it look so effortless
Tatum not clutch... Missed both crucial FTS at the end of game
The Splash Bros are making a statement! Let's goooooo
9:02 what happen to the score
Is 🔥 how they showing us the distance from downtown, 25ft, 27, 30, etc  I wish they do this in every game
And wiggs didn’t play
tatum just fears the warriors😂
And the Defending Champ proves again💪
#SC30 THE REAL MVP & GOAT💪👊💪
Celtics missing their 2 best big men, outrebounded 53 to 39.  Warriors got 11 offensive rebounds to Celtics 6.   3-pointers was not the story, Boston 12 for 40, Warriors 13 for 39.
7:42 Even the crowd "TRAVEL"
Basic lang pala ang celtics kalabanin sa gsw hahaha
Damn Celtic play like a girl vs golden state always 😢
are you idiot ref?????
Alot of no calls on both sides. I like when they let them play ball !
When u see Kerr cross his arms like that know it’s ON
"YEAH! YOU CAN'T GUARD ME CELTICS". - GSW
Celtics is luck of consistency in deffensive end, slow ball rotation at selfish basketball by individual player. They play not as a team.
And they got tatum leading in the mvp race smh. Dude always chokes when it matters most like in the clutch or close games. Of course it's easy to put up numbers and shoot good when your whole team is playing well and beating the other team. But what really shows how good/great a player is, is when they need to make big buckets that matters and they deliever. Tatum doesn't do that. Overhyped forsure.
Chef curry Goat.
il like to know why they are showing us where curry is shooting from like we give a shit at all ?
Celtics forgot who is their father is
tatum starting to have a reputation of disappearing in big games lol
Lot of empty seats.
crazy how many no calls curry gets even though he's getting fouledl like hell. the refs really be hating on the warriors
Boston need a reminder who’s waiting for them in the west, they’re a playoff team. Record in regular season don’t mean nothing 🤣
low minutes in pritchard and hauser it is a losser.
Okay this is good to know that if Warriors wants to flex they really can FLEX hard & put the league on notice that they're still real.
So this is the no 1
I honestly like that they put the distance of the threes curry makes. They should do that for all way beyond the arc threes. Cause I'm honestly curious as a watcher at home lol 👍
Honestly Celtics should be better defensively, but Tatum & Brown focus on scoring a bit much
Jaylen Brown's efficiency is unbelievable
Fan of neither team but the warriors wanted to let it be known that those finals weren’t a fluke
That boy Dylan kronenberg just ruined all of the afghans   With his small wiener
All these fools saying Tatum is MVP but comes up small in the first big game of their season. What a surprise!!!! Boston fans I hope y’all never see another ring!! 😘
PROUD DADDY OF THE BOSTON CELTICS🥱
2:56
I love Tatum ever since he played for my favorite college team Duke but 18 points is not going to cut it if they want the win
They can win in road games, if warriors keep this kind of momentum
As usual everyone picks the Celtics and The Warriors fold em and make everyone look STUPID
Tatum eclipsing himself again.. 😂
Where's moobly?
The Celtics arent frauds, Tatum is 🤦🏾‍♂️
This is the most interesting and terrifying 500 team I have ever witnessed😂
🎉🎉🎉we showed the league that we’re capable. Time to go on a run
The fact the warriors weren’t getting calls and kept making shots anyway was tremendous they kept the turnovers low and had solid 2 way play from steph and klay and the entire team d-fence was nice to with no wiggs
I mean if GSW aren’t playing bad D they seem to then make up for it with turn overs.  How long can their offense hold out laying that way.
The Splash Brothers 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀, warriors showing who he the BOSS!!!!
If Kuminga keeps playing like he has the last few games, then he will not only be featured in the playoff rotation, he will be in the closing 5.
i really thought celtics will take revenge , good job warrios for shutting down Jayson Tatum.
Draymond Green guarding Tatum is bad defensive matchup for Tatum. Anybody Green guards needs to take difficult shots to score, especially Tatum and Jaylen, both often scores off the dribble. Klay, Steph on the other hand, are quick release elite shooters. They only need a split second space to score. If they both get rolling, you got no choice but to brace for a storm.
I made 300 bucks betting with my sisters boyfriend
A Great Game! Can't wait till the finals
Curry is a real life cheat code
I’m sorry but I see something different in steph this is crazy
Welldone GS
Congrats Warriors!
strategy game from Celtics. 😎
It’s just something about the warriors,they just don’t look the same.
7:41 was a TRA-VEL curry did not touch that ball 😂🤣
Bucks fans love to see it😁
Curry tres lang alam gago 😆
Hehe
Let’s gooo warriors starting to look in form again. Solid defense and offensive contribution all around
GG Warriors
i think we just watched the 2023 finals. possibly... a lot of bad calls as usual... refs tried to help boston win but they arent good enough.
1:22 Beatiful move by Tatum
Congratulations warriors 💪💪💪
Warriors know how to handle Celtics pretty well.
Felt like the Warriors would really regress with that Utah loss, but maybe a couple days to think about it is what they needed
yeyyyyy💙💛
The Celtics had an off night.
GREATTTT WINN
What happened to the slaughter Celtics were supposed to give the Dubs. 😂
It is really dominated by Warriors since Finals...
Look at draymond mann on jk dunk . So prooouuuuuuuud
Tatum is only the "best player" when the Warriors aren't guarding him. Looks like he can't score against a real defense, with his "no jump" jump shot.
LETS GO WARRIORS
Tatum showed what choke and soft are 😢
At exactly 7 mins in the 4th number seven from the Celtics left the ground with both feet n return back to the ground before shooting I thought we was calling obvious travels no consistency
Overreacting like crazy over one game 😂 warriors didn’t have Wiggins but we didn’t have two starters. Both teams weren’t healthy and the warriors happened to win ggs we’ll see how it goes in playoffs.
4:02 Draymond looks for Curry & Curry looks for Thompson  what a Trio 🔥
Warriors at home is crazy
Smash Brothers are the Debarge musical group back the day..
What’s new?   Absolutely nothing.
That dude ever come back from the moon? Biggest up n down in history in sure
Last year Finals between the Warriors and the Celtics. This is an epic rematch!
curry fouled so many times...no call:P
That Steph shot from 31ft after 2 consecutive turnovers is everything 5:10
Curry is one insane SOB. The audacity to take those shots, and the skill to make them.
Shit watching golden state win make my day easy
Good defense by gsw!
i like how they added a distance counter for curry's 3s haha Although, you can't disregard pritchard at the end of the game hitting a 35 ft 3 that's swish.
Refs still love the Celtics, they still lose though
Celtics got flashbacks
Unless boston upgrades in the low post they are an injury away from not being a contender.
Damn Celtics got molly whopped
I am glad too see Kuminga confidence,  he called for the 1 one 1 with Tatum and wasn't afraid to go to the hoop
Warriors playing at a championship level tonight made me forget that Wiggins wasn't even on the court.
I am glad Klay is starting to take a few steps in instead of forcing a three. You can tell it helps him get going.
8:41🐅 Curry Disgusting 😂🙈
The Cs just need to beat the dubs once to give themselves some confidence. The next fame in the garden will be the difference, of the C wins that fame they be fine... If they lose then the Dubs will be in their heads
Love to see the Celtics lose - sincerely, division rival
Curry be hittin' threes like it's nothing
@38 secs left of this video, they didn't count the basket ????? 👀👀👀👀 doesn't make a difference but still
7:45 whole crowd was like, “Wtf?!!”
Looney the most underrated player.
When they start showing the ft for the shots.  That’s clean af
Kuminga going at Tatum is BIG!!
Good way to carry momentum going to Bucks game 🥶
A nice 10 game winning streak for the Warriors is due.
This a huge win for the warriors and also Klay Thompson especially trying to find his mojo overall they reminded the whole league on what the splash brothers of Steph curry and Klay Thompson can truly also out playing jaylen brown and Jason Tatum as a whole in this game against the best team in the east and also had a good road record.🏀🌊💯😁💪
Saja nmn gusto laang sa regular season Ang Boston pangita n nmn
Klay sat down in jayson tonight and made it really hard for him. I thought he was going to have a big game with Wiggins out
See what we have to say about this game tomorrow night at 7:30 est  https://www.youtube.com/@themikeandbeckershow/streams
Pause the video at 2:58 . Look where the ball is and look where curry is facing. Truly spectacular … Stephen Curry man so inspirational.
Tatum's a fkn joke dude, I'm so tired of watching this clown choke against the Warriors. He plays scared, it's annoying.
Those Looney screens for curry were really on point! Looney be the most consistent guy for gsw 👌
Draymond Green say what you want about him dude has a beautiful basketball mind. Seriously I’m watching post game with Draymond if Tom Brady has 300 million coming in broadcasting after football Draymond should have at least 100 million coming from abc nbc Turner whoever. He just played in a game that was a finals matchup last year. And he’s talking about it like a teaching lesson as if he was in the studio already..  That’s insane I would say Draymond Basketball Iq is up there with the best.  I think because he’s not the best player he prides himself on knowing everything he’s one of those guys.
👏👏👏GSW
Celtics: we lost the championship because we didn’t have enough offense.  *celtics dramatically improves their offense*  Then faces curry and curry is like. That’s cute.
Just like the finals. Go Dubs.
Well that's the statement we wanted to see 🙏🎉🔥
The warriors bench is only getting better! Wigs wasn’t even playing! The bench has confidence now, the splash bros are clicking! Honestly, the warriors seems to be improving while coasting to keep players healthy. Injuries is their only weakness.
As long as the Celtics play any other team, they’ll win the NBA Finals
We pick it up where we left at
Referees STINKS men
Panis ang celtics
ESPN announcers are annoying
Warriors just got the Cs number at this point
All this just to walk up and down the court and throw his hands up and complain
at the end of the day, it’s still the defense that wins games. hopefully golden state turns it around starting from here. i don’t know if it was because boston plays a lot of iso or that they couldn’t get going on 3 (or maybe both), but help defense, recovery, and transition was excellent this game. they need to remind the league why they had the 2nd best defense last season.
Give us stock in your franchise Celtics we already own your team 😂 #DubNation
Celtics are Rattled everytime when they playing with  warriors 💯
no wiggins 😂 W
I thought the Celtics were unstoppable? At least, that is what the Celtics fans keep telling people.
Seems that the warriors have the Celtics number
Oh shit Wiggins didn’t even play lol & they still won
When I said warriors could take this win couple days ago a comment section laughed me to scorn 😂.. going right back over there to ask em how’s the laugh.
Amazed by the defense of Wiggins... Coz he's still in Tatum's head eventhough he's not playing.. Poor Tatum still recovering from that finals trauma..🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣
Panis....curry still sharp in the rainbow territory
GSW FOREVER🥰🥰🥰
Curry was NOT losing this game
Warriors just showed Celtics who has the better'ball movement
7:40 that collective AWWWWW from the entire arena hahahaahhaha
Considering how we play at home this year I think if we can get homecourt the first round or two in the playoffs and we fix our play on the road we can repeat. No one wants to play the Warriors in a series where Kerr and company can make adjustments for an entire series.
Tatum just can't play good vs the Warriors. Wiggins in his Jersey.
This is supposedly the best team in the league don’t let the best record fool y’all the Warriors got that championship dna
Green is a waste of money
Warriors took this one seriously.
Yessss! Good Job Dub Nation!
Not enough klay in this reel
Wait ending 5-6 5-7 ako
7:41 bruh
❤❤❤❤💋Dub Nation!!💋❤❤❤❤
Deum bro the warriors played pretty good and curry needs to score more than 30 so the warriors can win if he doesnt the warriors lose but anyways in this game every1 played pretty good D on the celtics..
Warriors are just in Tatum’s head right now. Been a long time since he had an efficient game against them. This is the team the Celtics want to see the least if they reach the Finals again.
warriors may be 11th in the west but we can see they're still the team to beat
Imagine if Wiseman stop being soft
The Celtics could have won this game easily if Tatum played well
Ain’t no way Steph had two no look shots in a single game
Splash Bros. outscored Brown and Tatum: 66 to 49. Celtics, or ANY team, will not beat the Warriors when those two outscore your best two players, especially by 17 points....
you know GSW is winning when Steph dropped that 30FT 3 to end the 1st quarter
thank God it wasn't the usual cnbc bay area commentators for this one, all they ever seem to do is bring up how the Warriors are playing championship basketball
If Tatum play with the same intensity JB play with the Celtics would be unstoppable. He has no aggression no grit no get mad & make them frustrated!  He rely on his slow step back from the waist 3 pointers too much & looks uncoordinated with a hell Mary flip up & in; driving to the hoop layup most times!  Tatum a monster he just play weird sometimes while JB be going to get it
*NBA finals rematch Warriors still on top*
3 refs didn't even see the travel by brown 👀😂😂
This was the weirdest game ever. As a hornets fan I saw the Celtics make shot after shot against us, then they play the warriors and miss layups, open 3’s, and brick free throws. Dubs play good defense for sure but there were plenty of looks where Boston just didn’t execute. Wish these were the Celtics we saw a couple weeks ago lol
Can someone tell me why when kuminga did at 7:03 he moved back with both feet
❤
Brogdan is a problem. He's one of those players who's not a superstar but he has his moments
My team better learn how to defend that same play the warriors keep running since the finals where someone will handoff the ball to curry, klay, or poole, then a pick, then a jump shot because they keep doing the same dropoff coverage. Doesn't matter if both horford and rob will are playing, I think it will be same result. They showed they can defend it by playing small and switch fast but they couldn't maintain it. If the celtics want to win the title they better learn how to defend it well FOR THE WHOLE GAME.
Poole wasn't turning the ball over ever 3 plays tonight 😂
Celtics still have the best record in the NBA, but they are obviously not the best team in the NBA.  Maybe some day.  They D'd the ever loving ^%$& out of the Celts.
Celtics are trash
Everytime the Splash Brothers are in their Rhythm, there's no way you can stop them from scoring. They can Shoot anywhere, anytime and even in the quickest way possible. They are Programmed to Shoot the Ball.
This is the game 7 of 2022 finals featuring blake added to the celtics and wiggs out for the dubs hahaha
Celtics is No1 team in NBA my ass
Can we all agree that Jaylen Brown is a more consistent and better overall player than Tatum? 🤷‍♂️
Celtics not fully healthy. We'll c even both are
look at step and klay men so inspirational
that shot fake @7:41 by Brown looks like a definite travel....
Ok CT11 on the thumbnail lookin like a gangsta!! Its over.. Its over.
I dont understand the warriors this season.. They lose to teams who r ok or bad and then win against contenders and elite teams…?🤦🏾‍♂️😭
Steph is a human cheat code
Warriors own celtics
8:40 sheeesh 🥶
Kuminga is nice 🔥🔥🔥
Man curry is pure fire mvp
JAYLEN BROWN ALWAYS SHOWS UP
I want Tatum off them chips 😭
as a Celtics fan I know we are the better team but damn this hurts.
I remember seeing a pole which asked: who would score more points this game, Steph, Klay, Jason tatum, Or Jaylen Brown. %4 of the people voted Klay on it 45 percent of the people voted tatum. 2 percent of the people voted brown. and like 49 percent of the people voted steph.
Tatum must have had flashbacks I guess
As a celtics fan, we need a big man. Griffin has no defense, i mean cmon yo!
I was almost mad my Cs lost to Golden State then I saw their record 😬😵‍💫. Yeah we’re not worried bout GS
Warriors best game of the season so far, now if they can bring some of this home court energy with them on the road trip they’ll be in good shape.
Steph is different against Boston
Bro literally doubled and ain’t get no call bro what tf both his feet left the ground
I take back what I said about Boston being in the final. Ain't happening!
Love the “30ft” marker that came up on stephs shot. Was that your edit?
7:42 the bench were mad HAHHAHAHAH
Celtics had Finals flashbacks
WARRIORSS🗣️💙
Dylan Kronenberg said   Lamorinda soccer sucks, blame Masood Ahmadi, it’s all Masood Ahmadi’s fault
Dylan Kronenberg 5 hours ago Lamorinda soccer sucks, blame Masood Ahmadi, it’s all Masood Ahmadi’s fault
I hate the dubs losing to the pacers and winning against the bes- record team
Dylan Kronenberg said   Lamorinda soccer sucks, blame Masood Ahmadi, it’s all Masood Ahmadi’s fault
7:42 was crazzyyyy, how'd the refs miss that travel
Great game DubNation! Offensive and Defensive level of play was phenomenal. Way to limit turnovers and transition shooting for the opposing team. The Splash Brothers were good, and the rest of team's contributions were AMAZING! GSW reminded us all that they are the CHAMPS...put some RESPECT on their names! Great game, entertaining from beginning to end.  Way to go WARRIORS!
I truly believe the Celtics are better off without Tatum. He disappeared again. Then he's gonna score 50 against a mediocre team. Brown showp up to fight alone. Brogdon is better in crunch time.
Well we see Celtics biggest rival is themselves especially Tatum;have a terrible shooting night and look out of it;missing easy layups ,with no Wiggins he should have got whatever he wanted but sucked repeated of the finals hopefully he get better and the team ready mentally for playoffs
If Wiggins played in this game Warriors would have blown out the Celtics..
Draymond and the coaches are creating a Monster with Janathon Kuminga.  If he keeps this growth especially on the defensive side.  It’s going to be scary for the league come playoffs.  He could be that 3rd lock down perimeter defender We’ve been needing.
Am I crazy do you see how far curry is shooting the ball really
I’m not worried warriors are ass
Kamingaaaaa......
Warriors still the champion for me 👏👏👏👍👍👍🏆🏆
This was the best Fun watching of GSW game 7 hahaha Gotta love it Damn Crazy  Fave GSW Champs  Damn this one of the Cooking Chef Curry and Klay Splash Bros and Buddy Jordan Poole Party And Jk Damn Bench Warriors Legend  ifs ok  now of Wiggs hes going to be Damn to Jk Also 💪💙💛🎉🐑🔥👌
That up& downs no call was horrible..ball was not deflected
No Wiggins tonight warriors still won 💯🎯🤞🏿
this match only proving one thing: there's little reason for GSW fans to be concerned. they'll make the right adjustments during the season to be a top 3 seed in the West - much like Boston last year. and given how close the West is this year with no clear #1 seed, the race is wide open for GSW to take over.
Its chip or bust for the Celtics this year
Can't wait to we whoop those tricks in Memphis Christmas day
Celtics,no match with GSW
Boston does not put fear in me....never. Tatum for me, is STILL, the very same non aggressive player i saw in the finals last yr. He dont get the key rebound or defensive stop.
Refs be definitely helping the Celtics
Pple kookin at our record n think we slippin...it dnt matter wat seed we gt in the playoffs ass long as we get in..then we fna tke over
I love how they started putting how far the shots were made from 😂 please keep it up! I like that!
Curry wants to steal your soul and eat it. He is just unbelievable.
Let's not forget that the Dubs were without Andrew Wiggins this, and they still held Tatum to 21 points on 6-21 FGs.
Warriors can't play that well for 7 games. Celtics can play to a higher level and more consistently.. I hope the Warriors get their stuff together and make it back to the Finals, would be fun to watch them run it back.
4th straight ass whipping by warriors, Celtic fan . Not looking good for us
Klay and Kuminga came thru. Warriors didn't have Wiggins or GP2, but Celtics didn't have Williams or Horford, which is probably more damaging for the Celtics than the Dubs tbh.
Curry playing against his sons. So inspirational 😂
damn! that Jayson Taylor is good - Charles Barkley
Haven't watched the Celtics since the finals, same old Tatum I guess.  Fraud record for sure.
Celtics still can't beat the Warriors lol
poole shot 11% from 3.
That blatant Jaylen Brown Travel 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Every Celtics fan reasoning out about injuries🥱🥴🤧
Payton casually pulls up from 35 feet after the game is over for no reason 😂
So much for "The league is in trouble against the Celtics." Warriors show up to shut them down
Tatum always gets exposed vs the warriors
I was at this game. RIP to everyone that came outside in their Celtics gear 🪦
curry is tatum's daddy
i have to remember to never read the comments on a game where the warriors win, i stg warriors fans online are either 8 years old or 80 years old this is a toxic swamp
I never understood the thing about Celtics fans being so toxic. It is now as clear as day why they have the reputation when you look at the replies of this comment section.
7:42 that was the funniest reaction I've ever seen. By the way I didn't see a foul idk what the crowd was tripping about ☘️
7:41 lmao
wtf why are the last two plays out of order?
Statement win by GSW. They beat the league's current number 1 team, best 3 pt shooting team, rated number 1 offense.
Warriors brought Celtics back down to Earth and remind them to be humble.
Damn I would’ve thought this was the nba finals all over again with how Curry was playing 😎🔥
i cant believe kuminga decided to 1v1 jason tatum in the paint and dunked on him. you know that felt good.
Love to see the measurement when Curry pulls up for a trey!!! 💯
Damn the entire first quarter music sounded like this was in LA. Dr Dre/warren g
I'm wondering what will be the outcome if Wiggs is playing?
It was only right that the Splash Brothers go off against the Celtics.
Celts are overrated man.
That first Poole 3ptr came with a lot of traveling on the side.
Great game for sure.
Glad that Warriors won against the best team in the league this season, but Curry has to be careful with the turnover. He's generated much this game.
Boston usually plays GSW well on the road. Must be a mental hangover from that Finals collapse.
that's the reason standing don't matter!!!!!
JT choking again... Everytime JB score over 30 JT choke under 20s... JB keep climbing up that MVP ladder while JT falling.   Luka about to win MVP if Tatum keep choking on games that actually matters.
Good job warriors🙏❤️👍
I was at the game tonight Celtics vs warriors it was a good game
Although Wiggins didn’t play this game, there is no excuse letting Celtics scores more than 100
Tatum got PTSD when he touch Golden state or somn
Can someone please explain 7:45 when did curry touch it at all
If the warriors have home court advantage in the play offs it’s a wrap
As a BUCKS FAN TY GS......Boston get rdy to FEAR THE DEER
Watch out for Kumingaaaaa he sleeping
Woow good job splash brother 🥰🥰🥰  nice game warriors 👍👍👍👏👏👏
Curry da real mvp. Between curry and luka. Steph curry daddy of the Boston Celtics he wasn’t lying😂👍
I See Jayson Tatum Has Not Yet Recovered From His Very Bad Finals Showing!!! To Be Honest Jaylen Brown Looked Really Good But WithOut Him Boston Would Have Been Blown Out By Much More...This Proves They Still Have A LOT Of Work To Do Honestly!!
Did Boston actually think they were going to Win tonite 🤣. Warrior's own Boston and Tatum!! Good luck with Milwaukee!! Warrior's vs Milwaukee Finals!! Derrick White ain't The Answer!! Warrior's ate white for breakfast last year and this year. Your Welcome 😅.
they pissed Curry off when Tatum stole his Rock when he was just chilling but then after that double team dunk Curry went off spitting 3's in their face at home game.
Seve kerr know how to defeat celtics
7:41 - No call?
PROVE THESE BOYS WRONG, LET’S GOOOOO DUBS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Where the bronsexuals at..🤔🤔
God damm Celtics come on!!!
The problem I have with Steph is he will put up a 28 footer with 18 seconds on the clock. Yes, he is a great shooter, but that doesn't make it a smart basketball play.
marcus smart the kinda guy to push off for a floater and still bitch for a foul call
Means nothing. One good game doesn't a champion make. Celts are on a long road trip and were bound for a bad game. Warriors are 14-13, seriously inferior team, zero bench. Long series they have no chance.
Looks like it's game 1🤔
It's Deja view, like I've been here before
That #30 man of Warriors is very good.
Im sure the warriors never watch a video tape of the other team playing, they only care about celtics.😆😆😆
I keep rewatching 7:03
wow, 1st highlight of the game is the flopping of smart
Good showing for the Warriors. Celtics are probably still a little shell shocked from last year. Side note, Draymond Green's scared to shoot attitude continues.
its unreal to me they beat the celtics without wiggins  damn
@1:08 JT and JP caught kissing in game
The dubs confuse me 😂 like let’s loose to the small teams but win against title contenders
Splash 💦
Tbf they weren't winning so anything helped
Good to see klay coming bac to where he left off with 34 points defense was on point and the warriors won without Andrew Wiggins 💯
I don’t understand why the Cs are still doing the drop coverage on Steph. But i think the Cs are still the best team in the league. Im a warriors fan and i still think the Celtics are coming out of the east.
The 35 footer at the end is hilarious 😂
Jaylen Brown played a good game. Tatum, laid an egg. It's called pressure, he did the same thing he did in the playoffs, #nothing. I just got to say one thing, #my boys are gold-blooded, dub Nation for life. # going to get that ring.
11 offensive rebounds and second chance points… that’s the game
Wow. I'm so depressed. Tbh, I don't know where the Celtics are gonna go from here. Even if they get the one seed, we just don't have what it takes. You can't lose games like that. I really thought this was gonna be the year but this game shows that we need more. Shit
I thought for sure Dubs were gonna get smashed, pleasantly surprised they played well.
The warriors are the most dynamic team in the nba Have always been. There gameplan is unstoppable… Why am I the only one who sees it. Draymond is the key little Do people know… We will win it all this year and next… Curry goes down in the goat Talk just wait and see Curry is the greatest player of All time💯🙏🏽 in Jesus name I pray Amen
Klay Thompson priceless. All I want for Christmas, is another ring, #banner, gold-blooded..
If jayson Tatum is the leader in the mvp race THEN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TF IS JAYLEN BROWN????
Steph really hit a 2 turn around shots a turn around 3 and turn around midrange 🤯 he is really him bruh!!
That boy Blake back starting
Klaaaayy
I don't like it when mark and stan do our games, subtle bias for the other team. Doesn't matter who they play you can hear little jabs, or is it me?
Boston can't beat Warriors they have their numbers.
Looney is priceless. And we didn't have Wiggins. I bet your Boston was licking their chops at the beginning of the game, I mean no Wiggins, no problem.. we gold-blooded. #Let that sink in. Gold baby, solid gold.#next...
The warriors are built to beat a team like the celtics-celtic fan
Pang play offs talaga ang warriors kahit baba sa standing
klay forgot that this isn’t game 6
It's really incredible that GSW defeated the Boston Celtics just like they did during the 2022 NBA Finals
2:54 Celtics were like, "Not this sht again."
I like Jk's game
dont disrespect the champs
Feels like 2015 Steph Curry
Please just give us a 5 game winning streak
W FOR THE DUBS.
Tatum still shook and Boston still can't see us Boston to finals again nope
Celtics got way too cocky after their hot start and blowing the Suns out. The champs are here!
9:22 bro sank that ball from half court and nobody noticed 🫠
At least warriors still know how to win at home
Golden state fans all look like red fat tomato’s
Nice!
The warriors can clearly keep up with the best, so it’s frustrating watching them lose to bad teams constantly. These losses will add up.   Side note, warriors shoot the least amount of free throws and teams shoot the most against them. They have to work on that
The comeback of all-time slash brothers....
This better be the game of the day on NBA channel tomorrow? Hear the Celtics have the best record in the NBA. But who are they beating? Not the dubs baby. Not the dubs....
CURRY THE BEST PG EVER SMD TO ALL THE MAGIC JHONSON FANS FUCK CP3 FUCK WHOEVER YALL LIKE AND YES IM DE
7:43 curry did not touch the ball and if u watch in slo-mo u can see curry move his hands away from the ball.
I just got to say one thing, WARRIORS. Some people just don't get it. It's a long season. And yes the warriors are going to be in the finals...
jayson n derek wer shit tonite
I see that Marcus Smart implemented his hard fought flopping early.
so many adds
This is gonna look different by May '23 playoffs.💯
kuminga is coming baby😝😝😝
this is why luka is mvp
7:43 Even the crowd knows its travel😂
Celtics aren't as good as they think they are.
You can't defeat a guy who can shoot from anywhere. It's the points that count... not defense, not dribbles and not steals.  ..When Curry is playing, the Warriors are at their best, if they like to win.
Whoever said trade klay they r fake dubs fans accumulated during our championship runs.  Stfu.  Mofos.  Just get into the playoffs.  Not playins playoffs.  Then no injury pls.  We gonna repeat.
Warriors gave the Celtics finals ptsd 💀💀
Hope Ayesha cooks good tonight. Them father and sons need a good meal after that awesome game
All the morons saying that the Warriors can't win as constructed can just sit down and shut up. Wiggins didn't even play.
Feels like the 2022 championship
Wish milwaukee never got rid of Malcolm brogdon
All the haters who said Klay is finished must be hiding now
MVP my ass.
Win or lose, when Golden State play their brand of basketball, no show on the court comes close. Just lovely to watch. Steph was Steph, Klay was Klay, and Draymond was Draymond, as always. Good job to Jordan Poole; so lovely to see that ball movement, and sometimes, you will drop 50 if that is what the other team gives you. Kuminga is really coming along and playing really well. JK, I am sure that you know that the ball is faster than everyone but that you are faster than most people. Recognize when to leak out, especially when Steph or Draymond brings the ball up and the coaches do not call a different play. As your role increases, consider super physical fitness. But great job! Good game tonight.
As much as I hate Steph he may end up wit more rings then MJ
This is good for us ,it will help us figure out what we need to do.
Poole, Thompson, Steph, Draymond. The Celtics still have PTSD when they see that lineup lol. Great win for the Dubs in the finals rematch!
Dang! Dubs winning this really says something! They just Best team in the east. Really unbelievable that they are 14-13
Same shit, different season.
7:41 I'm not surprised, just disappointed at the no call
·               The Currys !              · "Shooting Is The Family Business."  🌟
Teams can only beat GSW without curry
Curry is a proud dad.. of Boston..
2:53 the ball was still over the free throw line and he’s already runnin the other way😳 Momma, there goes that man
Celtics just got dominated by the 11th seed in the west lmao.
Thompson is slowly returning to form and is already doing a lot better this season than last season. If he keeps this up, the Warriors are gonna repeat again as long as they stay healthy.
You know winning constantly Golden State would be fanfu*kingtastic 🤷🙄
Jason curry vs his dad Stephen curry
Chamba
Is Klay coming back like 34 points lol
Warriors are STILL the team to beat! The Celtics were playing great but the Warriors had to remind everybody who the champions are!! Celtics aren't  on their level yet!!
7:41 LMFAO... NBA serious?
Celtics out there hugging and hand shaking after the game. Thats equivalent to watching someone smash ur girl, then telling them good job afterwards.  Celtics looked like straight clowns.
GO, WARRIORS, GO!!!
No wiggins btw
SO: what have we learned?  The Warriors Are BETTER THAN THE CELTICS.  Period.
Amazing game for Warriors! I predicted Celtics would beat Warriors easily because Celtics looked so strong and unbeatable. But I am happy that my prediction was wrong.
Blake Griffin doesn't look right at all in that Celtics uniform
GS can beat the Celtics but not the Suns…they need to work on that.🤪
The splash bros and poole party goin crazy
Hahahaha, I'm glad the Warriors beat the hell out of Celtics😁😁
9:02 that 3 pointer did not count on the scoring??? Or it was late? I'm not sure 😁
.
just a taste for gsw
Finally, Klay is starting to let loose
The Celtics may have lost tonight but I’m sleeping well right now that we got a legit dog in Blake Griffin. He may have lost his athleticism but he would die for this team. He’s a huge pick up after losing a huge role player in Gallinari.
Klay looking like regular Klay again golden state has a chance at a back to back for sure
Wow what a greatmoves Champion Rosters GSW
Big time win for the warriors
Splash brothers in da hauzzzz
Congrats Warriors. Consistency now is the key. I don't know. Can't judge fully, but as a solid Warriors Fan, I observed that Warriors don't bring they A Game when playing a less challenging Team and then end up losing.   Another observation is that, they tend to relax and be sloppy when they are up.   The team should learn from Michael Jordan. For Him the score is always 0-0 , that is until the end of the 4th quarter as a result, every possession is equally important and crucial and he would always give his best. No downtime. Same intensity.   That is consistency. If Warriors will learn this, no one can beat them.
That was a travel!
Im actually shocked they won without wiggins
Diff d
So Tatum is still the MVP favorite?
Warriors had it all second half  Celtics just couldn’t do it
Where is Steve Kerr's mask??
Congratulations warriors
7:40 UHHHHMMMMMMM??? 😂
The Golden State Warriors are 14-13🔵🟡⚪️🌉🌁
Ay I like the 3 pt range thing y'all added
They win in home court, only
Let me guess, Draymond got his usual triple single.
The refs were pissed they lost this one
addressing the elephant in the room.!...Tatum choked AGAIN !...yet the player they wanna trade soo badly 'Brown'  puts up 31!....its more than one game cause I see a pattern here with Tatum completely soiling himself when he faces the Warriors!. .he'll put up 50 in the next game and it wont matter!...I have ZERO confidence in Tatum against GS
KD is better then Jason Tatum!
Glad I didn't watch the full game these teams are exactly what they were last year. Waste of time as a Celtics fan
Steph & Klay are certified SNIPERS 🏀
Wardell Stephen Curry is just Stupid, Crazy, Amazing.! 🙀
steph kept on feeding klay and it feels like he's doing it on purpose considering that wiggins is looking like "replacing" klay as his duo.
8:40 these no looks are just absurd
klay in his 3 or 4 games has been really good
Klay silencing his critics.
Thank god no more idiotic finish
GS HATERS SAYING THAT ONLY WEAK TEAMS THAT GSW CAN BEAT THEY BEAT THE FIRST SEEDED TEAM IN EAST
Celtics will not win a championship ever
Man we played so well! Especially considering how Wiggs was out. Kerr's rotation was great tonight. I was so nervous we wouldn't be able to beat the Celtics since they are #1 in the East but my boys proved me wrong. I hope we can keep it up. LET'S GO WARRIORS! 💙💛🤍
GSW only home loss so far: Nuggets and Pacers
And the warriors still own the Celtics 😂
kids see ghosts
Let's gooooooooo GSW
Nice one warriors
Shut up doubters, just shut up. Saying celtics will dominate GSW? In ur dreams. An obvious fanBron, sheeessh. GO GSW!!!
Where tf was Tatum?
Tatum shitting the bed against the warriors??? Why does that seem so familiar
Boston having flash back. PTSD
Do they only show how many feet curry’s 3pt made?
Wardell a fool with it 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Nobody beating the warriors in a 7 game series if klay play like this with Wiggins. You got 2, 2 way players that can score and play defense. With curry. That's tough to beat!
When GSW is getting serious, no team can defeat them...
Ppl forget when healthy (curry geen n klay) golden state has the best trio record 💯💯 big 3.
Boston look like Detroit wen they play Steph lmaooo much Respect for Tatum always but Steph bout dat 💯💯💯😂😂🙏😔
I guess the kryptonite of this celtics team is the warriors
Nobody beating GS in playoffs im sorry
Wow for curry 🎉
Warriors in 6
Its starting to get boring. All 3's not a fan. Its a shooting game. Not much of a thrill cant even call it a basketball game.
4:23 he waits for curry to turn 😂
Wiggs did not play?
Boston got humbled 🤣
Only the Bucks can beat the Warriors in a 7-game series.
Celtic fans Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum not more talented though..Brown always takes over
N Wiggins didn't even play 💯🤫
Both teams were poor overall on 3pt shots tonite:  30% vs. 33%.  (Poole was 1 for 9, very poor).  DiVincenzo was +20; he had 8 rebounds and a steal. Amazingly good work he did tonite. It was rebounding that won the game tonite.
As a celtics fan, I suffer from PTSD because of the warriors.
Tatum Who?
curry really said yall can steal and dunk all you want ill just pull up from the moon
Giannis is the real MVP.
Ref's gettin worse holy shit
As a Celtics fan, the amount of turnovers I witnessed was crazy and I’m disappointed about all the 3s missed
The warriors mentally own the Celtics 😹😹
Tatum underperforms whenever he faces the Warriors.
celtics still havent learned from game 6
how did the ref not call Poole's travel at 6:00?
Looney good touch
these editors are getting better
Green, Brown and White all in the same game.
Boston CELTICS 107 vs 123 Golden State WARRIORS
Poole lookin' like a chef
It’s a mental thing the Celtics going to have to get over the Celtics are clearly better
Curry's long distance shots should be credited with 4pts! 🤩😍
@nba please stop the 3pt FT graphic
Tatum having flashbacks to the finals
Celtics look CLUELESS just like in the Finals, Warriors are true Champions, Celts not ready for that Team Still 🥴
Pool needs to stop traveling lol dude was wide open and still traveling
Celtics are praying Phoenix plays Golden State before they do in the playoffs
Klay Thompson is washed?, nah it's just a long slump
As A Boston fan this is a tough lost
props to Curry, dude seemed to catch fire. Seems like the Warriors did a good job of slowing down Taytum. Looking for the Celtics to bounce back after this one.
This by far is Klays best defensive performance all year!!!
💪💪💪💪GSW LANG SAKALAM
Taytum just isn't that guy. So many times brown is better than him specially against the big teams he is just hyped brown deserves the same hype he is as good as him if not better
I love the warriors but I thought the Celtics were gonna try and embarrass them Lmfaoo.
GG Boston 😁👌
Unpopular opinion: With this loss, coupled with the one in the Finals, The Celtics are slowly figuring the Dubs out.
Who the champs! We the champs! Stop playin wit us! Idc how many games we lose!!
Curry cheating
Yyoooo, ultra instinct, where you at hater?? 🤣
*the defending champions will get the chips 023."*
I am convinced that Steph, Draymond and  Klay for free rental in Tatums head.
Here you can see the consistency of Jaylen Brown🔥. But props also to he's buddy JT.
The Warriors still got the Celtics number.
Warriors had a full squad minus Wiseman but Celtics still don't have Williams, Horford(Covid) and Gallo. I doubt Celtics will play this bad again.
SPLASH TRIO BE SPLASHIN!!!
Boston is the best  in the league but warriors is their biggest problem regardless the stats of warriors
Celtics are supposed to destroy the warriors without wiggs.
GSW OWNS BOSTON 😂😂😂 THATS A STATEMENT
Tatum really blew it no cap where’s that 49 piece at smh gotta do it against great teams too to be called superstar
SPLASH BROS!!!
Tatum hates playing the warriors wth
The warriors said the Celtics still not ready yet
I like how they show Currys distance from the arc🔥🔥
stephon "father of celtics" curry
It’s looks like a playoff game
Warriors ain't making it to the finals this season... Just wait and watch!!!
Splash!
0:34 one dribble and lost track of the steps  But, at 8:14 it’s kinda the same thing
Celtics: Damn, we can’t beat this team even when the Finals are an eternity away and we got better this year.
Never, ever sleep on the Warriors
The Warriors got lucky Jayson Tatum didn't show up today. 😂🤣🤣
after this every Celtic will be dying their hair green....like that's gonna help
Remember the resolution of television in the 80's? The NBA does...
Celtics are not ready to win a championship.  They are not mentally tough enough. Not even close.  Their record is deceiving.  Lots of home games .  Lots of wins against lower level teams.  They ain't all that hot for all of their so called talent.  Tatum is not great either against the better teams.  He disappears and jacks up the worst shots I've ever seen.  Coach Mazulla doesn't know hoe to coach in game.
Nba is horrible with these videos, all they do is skip skip skip I'm done. F the NBA highlights
Saturday night primetime drama.
Finally won
Tatum is a fraud man
Warriors did this without Wiggins, too. They are the best team in the NBA. No question.
Tatum is very scared of the Warriors
Mentally weak trash
The warriors showed up and spooked us I’m disappointed but hopeful that the Celtics can get their shit together when real teams show up and the Celtics don’t look so shook
I think it is a disgrace that Blake Griffon is wearing #91! I mean he is a worm, but he is nothing close to Dennis “The Worm” Rodman who is the only other player to don the number in NBA history! The only thing worse is LaBronda wearing #23, who is also nothing close to his number-sake Micheal “The Goat” Jordan!
Nobody covers their man I just see ppl hide behind a guard and shoot. There’s should be someone helping the defender when they do that like literally always a 2v1… doesn’t seem like a hard job to mark your man and follow the play of the game smh 🤦‍♂️
Jason Tatum still lookin for the top of his hairline after Kuminga put him in the basket.
Not suprised, the celtics and tatum love to choke against the warriors
Celtics arent any better than last year, if anything there defense sucks this year.  Huge Celtic fan here but the warriors own us get used to it.
Lesgo
I don't mind the NBA not calling as many fouls as it use to but some of these non-calls are getting ridiculous. Also whatever happened to the traveling call????? For me professional sports is starting to become unwatchable.
If they keep playing drip coverage on the warriors they will always lose that is dumbest defense scheme ever
flashbacks really hittin rn 🤧
Warriors to the Celtics......i'm in your head Anna Mae"
Big brother had to put the Celtics back in their place.
DAMN!!  THAT. WAS. A. *GAME* 🏆
WTF was that @7:42?
Nice..!!
Bro why does it take forever for NBA videos to upload 720p or better versions compared to other channels?!
Go Warriors. Glad you we continue to defeat Celtics. Perkins  will cry on First Take on Monday. I hope Steve A Smith will pay attention to this Topic as a Headline. Thanks!
woes it goes
Only in Ohio
Grant Williams:we can win against them last finals  GSW:I'll take that personally  Bruh 💀
Not a warriors fan but they are so smooth on clutch tonight
Great win! Keep on crying haters 😂 Go Warriors 💪
God loves you and i love you to make sure to Pray and Read the Bible and get right with God before it’s to late because God is coming back real soon and he’s real
7:42 ahahhahahaaaa
Earliest I seen a finals rematch
Boston looks better than last year, but something feels flakey about the whole organization rn 🤔 Really good basketball players-Lack of leadership
Watching in 360p
Shows that Warriors can defeat any other top teams in the league. Come playoff and no team wishes to play against Warriors.😂
Kings beat the Warriors tho Celtics traumatized by the Warriors lmao
Congratulations! GSW💖💖💖
Reading today about the improved Celtics offense, and couldn't help but think how much the description matched the Warriors Offense of the past 8 years: spread the floor, pass up good shots for great shots, lots of movement and off-ball screens. Imitation is the highest form of flattery.
The best ka talaga curry wala ng maka gaya sayo ng galing mo sa 3 points.
The worryers/ woke-ers (🤣🤣🤣) are only good at home. Klay the Egothompson dumps so many shots hoping to get one in. Celtics gave this “Now” thrash team this win.🤣🤣🤣
Glad GSW woke up, particularly Klay, Poole and Jk. Hope they continue and build on this win. 🙏
NICE JOB GOLDEN STATE.... BUCK'S FAN HERE🥂🦌
Steph is insane man
It’s cool Celtics fans, we lost tonight, let’s just get it back going forward. Ggs warriors, y’all played great tonight
It’s cool Celtics fans, we lost tonight, let’s just get it back going forward. Ggs warriors, y’all played great tonight
Common Warriors W
Dubs largest lead in this game was by 20pts. The Celtics largest lead in this game was only by one point. Pathetic!
An amazing game from our Dubs!! Love to see the Splash Bros going off and the bench coming up with some big plays!! 🫡
Who says Klay is washed and needs to be benched over Poole? Best backcourt duo of all time! Great win Dubs! #splashbrothers
Warriors is customed taylor to kick celtics ass
Proud daddy of the boston celtics
Bro alam my nakaka bad trip ka gumawa nag video putol2x gagu
IMO the Warriors are always at their best when both Steph and Klay off and they did tonight, and it resulted in a huge win!
LOL I spotted that editing error in the end where the points actually went down to 119
Huge G.S. fan Tatum not clutch AT ALL vs us. Reminds of me of Harden when he was with 🚀, Brown OBVIOUSLY the real threat. Tatum just doesn't have IT
Dubs outrebounded the Celtics 53-39. That led to plenty of points in the paint as the Warriors outscored the Celtics in the paint 46-38. That was the difference in the game.
Yeheyy congrats gsw🎉
Brogdon was a great pickup by the Celtics. When the Mavs lost Brunson the clown owner and his GM did nothing to replace him... while the Celtics management are serious about winning a title so always looking to improve even after reaching the finals last year.
Warriors are winning the chip again… They are the Celtics kryptonite
Win warorors
Warriors can still get the 5th this season. I think they got the most experience as a team to win another championship
Everytime Steph's gonna shoot in a long distance 3, the feet mark appears😂
Na balhibuan ang boston.GSW 💪💪💪🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
The Warriors did a good job of keeping the Celtics out of transition in this game.
I don't understand how any fan of basketball can have the smallest bit of respect for Marcus Smart. He literally complains on every play, offensive and defensive. And apparently, he and Rasheed Wallace are the only two people in the history of the universe to have never committed a foul
Klay gets 30 points in the strangest ways for some reason
Tatum ain’t doing sh*t , J.Brown is the best player in the Celtics !
Warriors defense managed to hold Jayson Tatum to 21pts on 6-21 FGM and 2-9 3PM. Tatum averages 30pts during the regular season, so their defense against him tonight was really impressive.
that was a good game, Celtics are scarred by the Warriors.
Dubs needed this boost as they've been losing recently.
That Kuminga dunk on Tatum 😅
If Tatum played a little better we would have won by ten. Warriors had great defense, but still, those are his spots.
MVP Curry!
Celtics playing like GSW own them.
Look at poole celebrating after he scores like hes nice. Lets see him do that on his own team
Jaylen Brown had Draymond Green on him all night and was double team on occasion yet still put up 31 points on 13-23 shooting, grabbed 9 boards and had 3 assist.  So, here's my question, TATUM, WHO ON GOLDEN STATE IS SCARRING YOU?  Does Curry have Deuce held hostage???  This is getting sad at this point, smh
This was an amazing win for the Warriors. Curry and Klay each scored 30pts+, the Warriors played good defense and what's even more impressive is they did this without Wiggins! Great win for the Dubs!
Wheres Messie?
Love when the celtic hype train loses
The video quality took an L just like the Celtics lol
Dubs dynasty will continue. I don’t see anyone beating the Dubs this year.   Repeat is inevitable.
Klay says about social media, 'if you gonna go lurk, you gonna get hurt."   Hahahaha!  O man, the Celtics wanted this one so bad.  Wiggins not even playing.
I keep hearing in my head "Jayson Taytum is playing the best bsketball right now" (Paul Pierce) said that lmao  Man stop promoting the Boston organization!
klay is looking better over time he still has trash games but by the end of the season he should be right
WARR-IORS! 💪💪💪
Not worried about regular season uo and downs, or record. As long as they in top 6, they will have deep playoff/finals run. They just wading water till than.
Man, y'all need to lean on Brogden a little more. He always hoopin if he's not hurt
Klay Thompson balled out in this game: 34pts (14-26 FGM, 4-11 3PM, 2-2 FTM) 5 Rebs 2 Asts 2 Steals 1 Block
Oh yeah, their smoking everybody except the damn warriors. That figures. I'm so mad right now!😡😡😡
💪🏆☝️..
If the Celtics can't beat the Warriors on the road they're not winning the finals
dalawang team ko naglaban nako saan ako boboto? hahaha
Man oh man…we can tell when the vets are missing compared to the last game. Definitely a better bounce game from that embarrassing lost! GG GSW!
the message is being sent clearly. gsw can still beat celtics no doubt.
Klay and Steph were on fire and they are roasting the Celtics again
TATUM EVERYTIME HE PLAYED AGAINTS GSW 😂
I vividly remember many people saying Celtics will win by over 40+ points..
This loss is a good way to build the Celtics character this year.How will they adjust?
7:40 refs are sleeping 😴
Waiting for tatum to have an interview and say that he was injured to excuse his poor performance
Steve Kerr mastered the defense to the isolation offense style of opponent team
Warriors own the celtics  Hahaha.
Boston. Like i said, You live by The Jumper, You loose by The jumper.
2:50 Greatness in a one shot 🍺 Feels just like watching basketball animé with that turn away before it goes in from 30ft
Hell yeah! As a longtime Lakers fan, I say F the Celtics!
It's obvious Tatum's still scarred from the Finals.  But the good news is the Cs didn't play Horford and are getting Rob Williams back soon.  Tatum needs to get over it because he played like a bitch tonight
JB>JT
This game proves that celtics won't win a title
The Celtics are a great team currently top in the NBA standings but they are a shooting team they can't beat the greatest shooter in the NBA's team ie the Warriors
My Favorite Teams are the Celtics and Spurs but Congrats to GSW for this Victory👏 and atleast my Spurs getting an Upset in Miami.
Dang when u make celtics run around they cant defend, u cant play celts staying still thats the key
Kuminga might have the best on ball defense in the league. His defense is insane!
Gsw are 14-0 when Splash bros score at least 30 each
Bro, nowadays why are the maximum quality on these warriors videos so low? Specifically warriors matches, the maximum is like 360 bruh wth?
Statement.
Great father and sons moment between Steph and the Boston Currys
CURRY & KLAY SPLASH BROS🏀💦
Feels nice when the warriors are in sync like this
Wonder what the ESPN nutjob reporters think about Tatum. That dude is no superstar. JB should be leaving this team. Carrying them while Tatum gets all the credit lmfao.
Can't wait for Memphis game!
Jayson Tatum went missing tonight. It would've been a much better game if he played well.
No lie, I think I'd trade Jordan Poole straight up for Malcolm Brogdon in a heart beat
Every offensive possession should be running thru Brown in this game it's sad how he doesn't get the ball when he's the best player for the Celtics in this game. Tatum and White had a horrible game, Smart was being not Smart today. Klay and Curry shooting the ball well warriors very hard to beat.
Warriors at home: Championship team Warriors on the road: G league team
Tatum was in finals mode 😤😤😤😤😤😤
To those moron and idiot haters. That is for you. Look how the Warriors dominated the game against the number 1 seed in the East. Keep hating the Warriors and keep saying foolish things about them. They will show you how they will dominate the game.
Kinda sad I couldn’t watch this game. I would’ve loved it becuase im surprised the warriors beat the #1 team in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics have 21-6.
Tatum shrinks when it comes to playing the warriors
Curry is still bostons daddy😂
Still some life left in these old Warriors ...
This is one of them games that the attention has been on the celtics so far this year and the warriors had to remind everybody that they are still the defending champs
1:22 imagine if green blocked that, it would be a great highlight
360P, REALLY?
Stephen curry threeeeeeeeee..😴
They won by 16 without Wiggins by the way as long as our bench can score the warriors are going back to the finals we just need the bench to be consistent poole with 20 and kuminga getting boards and averaging at least 15 a game
they're back with their winning form..🍺🍺🍺
Ggwp
Back to the drawing board for my Celtics. Exposed they were. No hustle. I'm thinking they looked at their record and the record of GS and figured they'd just show up and win. Not good enough. What good is it to dominate the season if we're just gonna get quashed again.
Celts had a bad night, missing open 3s and fts. That happens sometimes. It is not everyday christmas. Good win by gsw.
there's no doubt, and there's nothing to prove. Looney the man of warriors!!!
Good game by the warriors. We'll see yall next game in Boston.  The Celtics are still the best team in the league either way.  They will be getting better as the season goes.
Impressive win!
Love to see Kuminga contribute with his athleticism
"Celtics are the best three point shooting team in the league". . . . . . Splash brothers say hold my beer, what was that again?
Have you guys noticed deonte played crunch time minutes
I guess warriors are Celtics Daddy.
Curry and Klay heard they weren't the best back court duo in the NBA and reminded the league who they were again.
Big W
Tatum nervous as hell 💀
I was hoping the Celtics showed up for this game to prove a point. Cause they have the best record in the league but they play in the east. This would have been a morale booster and a statement that being in the east is not an excuse for their record, and their hunger since the finals loss. I know its just one game but it was a bit disappointing.
tanginamo nba grabe yung ads
People keep saying the “Warriors won without Wiggins, amazing!” yet the Celtics don’t have Horford or Williams III. This is one regular season game. Celtics had a rare off night shooting-wise. Can’t see this happening on a regular basis.
Freaking beautiful
7:42 no call?
YESSSS
you already know if steph going for a iso at half court, you finna get scored on
curry foul as hell for that no look shot 💀
no horford and no rob williams really hurt tonight
Maaaannnnn... TATUM STILL MVP
Warriors dynasty gives so much trauma on the entire NBA!  Different Season yet same result!
Thanks Chuck 😂
CELTICS: We got the BEST record in the LEAGUE!! WARRIORS: Don`t forget that WE are the DEFENDING CHAMP!!
OSN bout to be on Tatum's ass tomorrow 🤣
tatum got daddy issues fr
How do the Celtics blow out other title contender teams but lose to the trash Warriors? 🤔
For the win🎉
Warriors did what Devin booger and he's Phoenix Sons can't do
I had a feeling Celtics fans thought they was gon’ win this one 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ nah all jokes aside frfr what a hell of a Game 6 rematch. Good game to all Celtics fans out there. 🤜🤛🤝 #dubnation #greatgame
Jaylen Brown " 7 " underrated player future superstar this league 🔥🔥🔥  #All-Star #All-Defense #All-NBA
I never get tired of mike breen saying "bang"🥶
As a Celtics fan I want to see this Finals rematch so bad. Hopefully the warriors can make the playoffs
My friend aint happy right now because of this 😂😂😂
Celtic fans real quiet rn 😂😂😂🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️ just got exposed!!!
Good game 👏 Splash bros, jp, and jk u probably made Tatum's mad
Hello idol..
Damn!!!!Warriors clicked on all cylinders
The Celtics are monsters on the court until they meet the Warriors. even without Wiggins. Tatum is still having PTSD
Warriorsssssssssss
brown should be allstar this season
whats with the inconsistent video quality?
Happy versus champion
Wiggins is Tatum’s father and Kuminga is now his step-father 🤣
The Boston Celtics are the Phoenix Suns of the East,  they just happy to be in the game..
Congrats on today's win dubs 👏💛💙
Giving them flashbacks 🏆
Idc how good y’all play who you trade you ain’t beating us when it matters the most CELTICS FANS
Warriors own the celtics
Absolute choke job from the Celtics 😂😂😂🗑️🗑️🗑️ tatum is not mvp after that dumpster fire of a game
Great win warriors
7:40 😂😂😂
LIGHT OUR BEAM
Useless 360p. Going elsewhere for highlights
Tatum flop wasn’t enough to beat the defending champs
Love to see classic steph and Klay scoring 30+ together ❤️ 🏀 🔥
CELTICS THE NO. 1 TEAM!???? DUH.... GOT PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH. RUDE AWAKENING
I hope Kuminga continues to be a big contributor off the bench. He's getting better every game.
No homecourt no win
winning with no wiggings is crazy
grant williams still thinks they are the better team LOL
let's welcome the sportman of the year 2022, proud son of Dell Curry, proud husband of Ayesha Curry, and proud Daddy of the Boston Celtics.
No Wiggins, no problem. JK was balling. Great win, Dubs! 💪
See why Klay would start in the game rather than Poole..who guard Jalen though?
As a die hard Celtics fan, I will never take shame in losing to Curry. Dude is unreal.
Tatum shooting 6-21 without his Daddy playing 💀💀💀 he still having nightmares from the finals🤣
Steph might be Tatum's father.
Anybody know the instrumental that was playing multiple times as it went to commercial break?
Warriors played championship basketball, can’t even blame Grant Williams for being mad 💀
Jaylen brown > Jayson tatum  Better in big games and national TV  Now yeah vs nobodies on a random tuesday tatum might be better
I gotta give it to the Dubs,  was worried about them but the showed and proved that they are still the champs. Did it without their second best player too. I still think that need 1 or 2 adjustments to the bench before the playoffs, but I don't see anyone beating them in a 7 game series if everyone is healthy.
great bounce back game by the defending Champs, on the best team of the Eastern Conference, truly this was a great rematch but when both Steph and Klay are in Sync, the splash bros are always on top  💙💛 💙💛🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good game! Hope the bench players will improve and win the games even without wiggins in the next games.
Celts still hasn't figured gws out...
good job boys!!! people got to see whats the GSW when the playoff comes. they want all the smoke.
Congrats dubs!
The warriors still own the Celtics lmao
warriors own the celtics this is sad
lost 2000 on my Celtics  Tatum sucks against the warriors bad defense tonight terrible effort need Robert Williams he's always fucking injured reminds me of pervus Ellison  just want some service pervus sorry bastard was always injured
Game's starting to slow down for Kuminga!
Klay splash
#Warriors23Champs #WeBelieve
Blake Griffin gets around more than my baby momma
This win was for all the Celtics fans that thought we needed any extra validation for that trophy 🏆 #Dubnation
LIVE BY THE THREE, DIE BY IT, Boston!! Good news: that's the ONLY reason you lost to this annoying Warriors team! Next game is yours! Bleed Celtics Green!!
How in the world are the Warriors only .500? We were completely outclassed in every facet of the game just like the Finals. From here, I don't see how the Warriors have more than 4 or 5 losses.
Lol Boston fans bow down to your daddy warriors
Truly a finals rematch, contuining their drop coverage on Curry and Tatum coming up cold.
Tatum still has issues at the rim
Maybe they win game 8 rematch hahahaha
Celtics are not a juggernaut and when things get tight Joe Mazula not making big time adjustments like Udoka as of now hes just copy and pasted last years scheme but what happens when hes gotta make adjustments only the creator of the scheme knows how to adjust best
Tatum is a great player. But he hasn’t figured out how to show up in these big games yet on a consistent basis. It’s one game in December, but this was the game, as a Celtics fan, we needed to win.
Lmfaoo lets not all forget the Suns got beat down by this same Celtics team a couple nights ago, and tonight the Warriors smacked the Celtics with ease!
⚠️ BRING IME UDOKA BACK ⚠️  😭 😭 😭
Beat the Celtics without Tatum’s dad 🥶🥶🔥
This the dude yall got over Giannis as MVP right now? yall crazy
Jt max contract disappeared
this probably would have been game 7
Great game by Warriors, LET'S GOOO!!!!
This yall MVP ????? That tatum nigga 18 pts 7 reb 6-22 FG 2-9 3pt 4-7 Ft NOT TOP 10 IN MY EYES COME FOR ME
When Warriors are actually focused, they can beat any team in the league. I’m getting really sick of these stupid turnovers tho. They need keep TO’s under 10 a game…
Jaylen Brown committed the biggest travel I’ve ever seen 😂
You ain't repeating you Warriors fan's! Don't let this go to ya head🤣🍻🍺
Tatum must got that Warriors Finals PTSD this game … he didn’t show up
Cavs can beat the Celtics
LMAO at all the L-tic fangirls. Tatum is a fraud and showcased himself in finals form. 18 points on 6/21 shooting, bum.
DiVincenzo reminds me of JTA like what do they do for the team lol just run around
Bucks will beat these Celtics comment below
Celtics wish they won't met the warriors in the finals again
Splash bro💣🔥🔥🔥
Warriors still run the West remember that, as long as the winningest trio in NBA history is together and playing at a high level never doubt them
Rumor has it that Jayson Tatum saw the ghost of Andrew Wiggins tonight
Scott Foster can get deported back to Plastic Surgeryland and the Emblaming Islands
Warriors its doesn't matter what record standing they can smoke top teams
Tough to beat the Warriors when Curry and Thompson shoot like they did tonight. Props to the young guns as well. Didn't foul like they usually do and kind of kept the turnovers down. Big win without Wiggins.
Tatum might have the most talent on the Celtics but once again Jaylen Brown showed he’s the one that keeps this team in the game. Celtics couldn’t match the warriors energy and it showed with the rebounds (Celtics 39 Warriors 53) plus, it’s starting to look like the warriors are just a bad matchup for the C’s
Everyone in the bay, “YOU FUCKIN THOUGHT”
Death Taxes and the Warriors owning the Celtics franchise!
Celtics will be like last years Suns, lose a finals then take off the next season and lose 2nd round. I see a team like the Cavs upsetting them and if not them Bucks will, i dont think they have enough
Great game, this is why you can’t sleep on the Warriors. They are champs for a reason, records don’t mean shit.
On Undsiputed Friday, Shannon Sharpe talked about if this Celtics team played the way they play now then they would sweep the Warriors 😂 well look what just happened ! Same story Warriors are better than the Celtics despite their records. Steph with another 30 plus point performance
Y’all can’t beat my cavs or the warriors
Warriors are 14-0 all time when the Splash Bros both score 30+
Hahaha talo prin
I think the Celtics thought that they had the Warriors number this year. Many thought the Celtics were way ahead of the Warriors this year. But Celtics ate humble pie tonight. Warriors showed that this rivalry is just a continuation of last year. Nothing new to see here. Congrats on the splash bros posting a 30-30 night.
Maybe relax on the Jayson Tatum MVP talk after this performance. Jaylen Brown is the better all round player
Shit quality
With no Wiggs….sheesh
Statement win without Jayson Tatum dad in the game 💪
Bostowned celtics
“Steph and Klay showing Tatum they are different shades to this light skin business, Big Perk.”
The Celtics do not match up well with the Warriors,  they just don't.. And Tatum always fold in the big moments... They can save that best team title for real contenders, it ain't the record,  it's the heart...
LET'S GO! WARRIORS OWN CELTICS! GSW FANS VS CELTICS FANS ON THE COMMENT SECTION LET'S GO! SPLASH BROTHERS ROLLIN'!!!
Media should Stop saying  tatum is the MVP favorites this year over luka.  Luka is far far better than tatum, its happens tatum just had a better team. Brown is more consistent when it matters most tbh
Stop the fake narrative Tatum isn't even the best player on his own team jaylen brown better don't let the media push fake narratives jaylen brown shots less doesn't have the offense run through him plays less minutes shots less free throws doesn't get fake fouls shots a better percentage and still scores more equal or slightly less stop the fake narrative jaylen brown better
It's just incredible to watch the Warriors in championship form. Kuminga getting better and better each game!🔥  Congrats Warriors on this big win. This was a great defensive effort overall.   Not to mention this game is w/out wiggy. 🥲
People gotta understand the warrior's aren't really a 11 seed team, their real seed is 1-4 in my opinion
When the Splash Brothers go splashing the wave they make will wash any team out!!
ARE U GUYS SURE THAT CELTICS ARE FIRST IN THE EAST? DIDNT REALIZE THAT GSW HAVE PRACTICE GAME TODAYYY! PROPS TO KLAY FOR STEPPING UP.
Tatum kryptonite is the warriors
Celtics have a fatal flaw, Mazula copy and pasted Udokas system that worked so well last season but what happens in the playoffs when a team takes them out of their comfort zone can Mazula make those critical adjustments that perhaps involve the Celtics changing the way they play at certain points in a series
LOOKS LIKE THE SPLASH BROS BROUGHT THEIR OWN POOLE TODAY !! KLAY 34, CURRY 32 and POOLE 20 WITH NO WIGGINS!!!! GREAT WIN DUBNATION !!!
Warriors played out of their minds
Jayson Tatum chokes against the team who beat them in the finals lol
You just knew Warriors were gonna show up for this finals rematch, you gotta put your foot on the neck of the team you won the championship on especially at home, as far as matchups go Celtics still made the same mistakes as the finals defensively and offensively looked stagnant
Let’s see the rematch when the Celtics get Robert Williams and Al Horford back
NBA Finals  GSW vs Bucks or Celtics  GSW in 5 (vs Celtics) GSW in 6 or 7 (vs Bucks)
Steph with 32 pts and Klay with 34 pts put on a show and the Warriors play great against the Celtics tonight!
SPLASH BROTHERS ARE SPLASHING 3s SO INSPIRATIONAL
GSW obliterated Celtics👏Rock solid offense and defense!! Go Warriors!!! Rise and shine🙌👍✌️👏🏆Raise the roof💪👍✌️
Boston still traumatized from the Finals...
The Warriors got huge contributions from Kuminga, Poole and the splash brothers. They also made sure they kept the Celtics out of transition so that they don’t run their smooth, efficient, high octane offense
Warriors own tatum
I am tired of seeing Tatum fail against only this team It's like with Harden against the Spurs
DAM TATUM😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Splash Bros took this game personally!  Great win.  👍
Let's Go Warriors! 🔥🔥
Nice
Biggest Win of the year for the warriors 💦
Fuck wrong with them they forgot we the champs go by warriors
warriors would sweep the celtics if they had another finals
Yes need more of KUMINGA!!!
Tatum getting carried by Brown and getting clamped by kuminga 💀  #NOTMYMVP
Tatum getting exposed against a below average defense he’s not that good he’s kind of garbage we should of traded him for kd instead of brown and smart
A healthy GSW is unstoppable
There are only 2 genders
Tatum still scared of warriors
historically great offense by celtics stopped by the historically worst defense of the warriors xD stephen curry is truly tatum, smart and brown's dad
Kuminga was awesome pls continue to kum on people
It seems that warriors are the Celtics kryptonite! 🕵
Ye
Warriors just a better team
All time warriors
It's going to be hard be them until they butts retire lol curry and klay day is 14 and 0 when of them goes for 30 each
Ez
I guess the warriors do own the Celtics 😭
The best Warriors games are when both Steph and Klay are in sync. Splash Bros on top 💙💛🔥
2nd view crzyyyyyyyy7y
Dope
Go Dubs!!🎉🎉
Defending champion lets go!!!!!!!!
even in their weakened state, the warriors are the ghost the celtics can’t be rid of. great showing from klay in this one
JAYSON TATUM  SOFT ST LOUIS KID  KOBE WOULD’VE GONE BACK AND DUNKED ALL OVER THE WARRIORS AFTER GETTING POSTERED by Kuminga  WHERE IS THAT MAMBA MENTALITY KILLER INSTINCT  TAKE IT PERSONAL. GEEZ
What a fantastic by the Warriors beating the Celtics and they did this without Wiggins, and Curry and Klay played amazing with 30+ points each leading the way, and Poole had 20 to combine for 86 for the Splash trio!💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
lets goo
It’s crazy that I’m the first person to comment
Nice game
Klay is on fire 🔥
Jayson Tatum should go to prison for a crime he committed "played super trash" even though his dad didn't play tonight.
The Warriors just feed off of hate and doubt
Bucks the best team in the East
Great bounce back game by the warriors on the best team of the league.
Nice
Lets go dubs🔥🔥🔥
Klay and curry did amazing
Damn 30 seconds.
Warriors 2024 champs
Look at curry so inspirational 💯💯
They thought we were scared cause of the record 😂😭😭 we ain’t scared of no team we want all the smoke we are the WARRIORS🔥😑🔥🔥
Wow
2nd
😂😂😂😂😂
1st
Celtics fans hiding now.
Warriors Had to remind Boston who the Defending  Champs Are Splash brothers Combined for 66 pts not including poole party Steph 32 Klay 34 let’s go boys💙💛💙💛
Warriors: France National Football Team! Celtics: Brazil National Football Team!
