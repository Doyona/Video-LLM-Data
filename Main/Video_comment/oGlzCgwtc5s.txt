lol baby hands
The fuck was he doing that for at the end he lost his mind
god i would have LOVED that alien dissection kit as a kid... All the fun of dissection without the awful smell of preserved corpses!
Please don't use door bell sound effects its just annoying for some reason.
6:45 I found the commercial and it’s totally Arin 😂 I can mentally see the goofy faces he was probably making while reading the lines!
That treasure x alien thing is a terrifying gift for kids. Here’s a creature. Tear it open
pretty sure one use toys would never sell in UK even back then
Anyone from 2024?
10:08 😂😂😂 my favorite sound from dan😂😂
11:44 Thanks, Arin. You gave me nightmare flashbacks of the 1988 version of The Blob.
11:42 The Miracle of Childbirth
well that certinally was 12 minutes of video
Why does he sound like he’s being held hostage and being forced to use tiny hands at 2:20
🥰😍🤩😘
Arin: hey Dan :) Dan: what’s up, Arin? :) Arin: *Half-life 2 headcrab zombie sounds*
Missed opportunity for Dan to put miniature middle finger on his middle finger.
i just realized that the intros in Current Times(tm) (2024) are MUCH LOUDER than the one on this one, for which i wish a return to (is this english??) this volue. m. UPDATE: i love you sorry
8:59 - I am glad they found “ANOTHER” use for there “PADDLE”……             😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omfg lmao Arin loves screaming into things. Just like a parrot.
Did you kill the lizard?
It's funny, the whole time I just wanted them to just use their real hands to play these XD
Anyone got the link for the commercial Arin was in?
I went to go look that commercial up and found it!
If you don't have kallmekris on the show after watching this I'm going to cry
"it's an it!" XD there are way too many one liners in this
In a commercial for that spider alien dissection toy, the skeleton guy can go into the head and pilot it like a mech, and the alien goes "Haven't I been through enough!?"
11:56 [A] "Hey Dan..!" [D] "What's up Arin?" [A] "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!"
im down for some lizard stuff
I love you guys! Thank you for making the world a creepier/better place😅
They're definitely running out of ideas
Hi grumps, just messaging you that I don't want you to kill a lizard on this show.....I do want to watch you guys hunt Ike or Jory for sport for one episode, though.
Arin just plugging merch at any chance always gets me
Arin is like Dan's bester friend , not bestest .
11:45 hey I found a Sbassbear clip haha
Dan opening RPS with the New Jersey state bird…classic
I'm surprised nobody made an "Arin HANDSON" joke
my therepist its only a nightmare it cant hurt you the nightmare 11 43
when dan said ARIN STOP was really funny
11:53 arin sounds like Chewbacca
I can't imagine a curious kid, wanting to know who the person that voiced the toy commercial was and what they find is Arin playing and/or violating the insides of the alien.
125/147
kill it
I loved that "AH, GIANT BUG-" at the very end, and how the video cuts off the literal second after the paddle made contact, absolute perfection
Treasure X seems like it's a one time only toy
Is this aqua man
My broccoli salad just kept getting harder and harder to eat🤢
I had a beloved pet lizard as a child, when it died my dad didn’t tell me for 6 months
I was drinking water when Arin smashed the box at 2:20, and the added baby noise almost killed me via laughter induced water inhalation
I do not remember the opening to this oh my god
I think I still see Ethan’s underwear back there
Arin sounded like Chewbacca 😂😂
Today is the day I realized Dan is old enough to be my dad.
Kill a lizard
You look like you’re being born”
11:46  this is how that person died in “The Blob” 1979
Uh oh…They experienced the Curse Of Tiny Hands Tokyo…
The commercial Aaron did is the Usos off commercial. Took me awhile to find so please say thank you.
the end of this episode felt like a fever dream
Arins over here trying to unbirth himself
That alien autopsy thing is so gross. I love it.
I thought I would be safe eating during this bit because it's toys but I was wrong
Kill the lizard
charming
There wasn't a single "Grahb my hahnd." I'm disappointed
I had no idea Dan and Arin have had this other channel for fucking years. I've been watching since at least 2014/15, don't tell me it's been here that whole time 😭 so much content to watch
KILL A LIZARD        PLZ
I'm so glad I'm not Arin. :V I would hate to put the bug organs to my face.
while they seem cool, i really dont like those kind of toys cause theyre one use only
Honestly I would enjoy this much more with out the gimmick of the little hands just the boys playing with then toys is all I need
Arin has discovered dental dams 😬
Arin profusely screaming then stoppin to say "hey dan" only to go straight back to screamin killed me. 11:50
6:57 sounds like a frat party competition
Kill a lizard
Please kill a lizard
All I could think about by the end of this one was Ace Ventura being birthed by his robotic Rhinoceros.
honestly tho, why the f are you buying what seems like.. single use plastic toys? surely that sht just goes straight into a garbage bag as soon as the episode is done.. n then into the ever increasing landfill sites it goes. pretty sure thats how most of these power hours go tho right? you just get a big black bin bag and sweep everything you used in these episodes in there and chuck it away.  it's so fckin wasteful really..
Wait I actually wanna see the commercial Arin voiced over 💀
That alien is the kind of toy I would have loved as a kid.
Can rewatch pretty much any 10MPH video an infinite amount of times, and still lmao until I am in tears. Love how weird and chaotic they are. Especially Arin. 😆
I love the high five at the start ✋✋✨
idk why but I am infuriated by the door bell sound effect on the dinosaurs
"Ew. *keeps touching it* Ew. *keeps touching it* EW. *keeps touching it* EW! *keeps touching it*"
The "Hey Dan" "Yes Arin?" "MMMMMMPH" absolutely slayed me
The operation game was so not fair.
Dan is 43? My life is different now.
"Aaaaah, I cut my finger-" "Did you really?" "No, it is plastic, dummy!" Arin wasn't trying hard enough. You can most definitely cut yourself and others with plastic knives.
So yall gon get and iguana so to fuck it?
NO
So why can’t they swear
5:24 callback to 'baby hands operation' on unus annus 👏
Really impressed at 11:40 when Arin reenacts I have no mouth, and I must scream. Very artsy of him.
I spat out my drink onto my keyboard when Dan informed the poor wife that they had lost her husband
Kill a lizard? no. make a power hour where you two go outside and SAVE lizards. now that's content !
I would like to see you kill a lizard. This is my official vote.
IS THIS THE DM EPISODE OR THE HANDS EPISODE WHAT ARE THESE COMMENTS???
Dan Yelling WHAT ARE YOU DOING ARIN?  Arin keeps messing with the sac  Me:🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arin at the end looking like that scene from Fire in the Sky 😂 mate you kill me!!
The smash cut from "we have to break it" to Dan beating a children's toy with a Yaoi paddle was the funniest thing I've seen in a while
This made me laugh so hard.
Dan’s married?? I just saw his wedding ring in the first minute of the video what?? 👁👁
I like that the sheep in the background is wearing a sock/scarf
The sound effects are gorgeous
KILL A LIZARD!
LOVE THE PBS THERAPY THANKS FOR THE FREE DOPAMINE
... didn't the bug warn that it was made with bio-hazardous materials? and then Arin put some of it... on his face.... yeah, go to a doctor man
Grab my (tiny) hands
11:58 Ace Ventura moment
...no, they're all bears.
Does anyone like… play test these “activities”. Seems obvious you wouldn’t be able to play jenga or operation with the hands… unless that’s the joke??
Ever heard of TWO BIRDS ONE STONE DANNY!! Arin wins.. small hands down.   Much love!
that's an AWESOME toy! too bad you can only use it once.
I want you to kill lizard
I love how Allie has become the disappointed mother of the grumps.
Has anyone found the link to the commercial Arin is in, out of curiosity?
Dan: "I'm a 43 year old man!" *looks like a baby faced 20somthing*   Lies!! Lies you immortal demon man!!
I spent way too long finding that commercial Arin voiced over
Kill lizzard
5:30 The most accurate reënaction of their Trauma Center playthrough.
Arin Handson
Kinda sad that they didn't open the brain of the skull man
Smacking the bug with the Yaoi paddle with that thousand yard stare killed me lol
kill a lizard!
Man that Arnold guy sure is a hot.
The moment they pulled out Operation I had (REDACTED) flashbacks
The video: “..and viewers like you, thank you!” Me: Aw man that’s like the PBS kids thing The video: FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT
So am I seeing things or does Dan have ring on the same hand and finger you would have a ring on if you were married?
I’m fucking dying I can’t breathe why is it so damn funny every single word
My 5 year old has taken over YouTube, so this is the first 10 minute Power Hour I've seen in waaaaaaay too long. Thank you!
Kill a lizard💀
Thanks Arin, now I had to look up Treasure X Aliens commercials
Haha 900
I feel like they don’t fully think through the activities before gibbing it’s to the grumps.
When Arin stretches the wrap against his face vertically, and screams, it sounds exactly like a tifighter
Rock beats rock.
i just realized that dan looks like young brian may from queen but less britsh
I watched this while eating and now I regret everything
the mouth and eyes are openable
I AM A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN
Im scared
KILL THAT LIZARD
"AAAAAAHHHH!  AAAAHHH!  AAAAH!  Hey dan." "What's up, Arin?" "AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!"
I think a funny video could be of the boys making custom air force 1s, it calls for patience and a steady hand, two things that won't happen and in the end they can display them in the office.
For anyone who doesn’t know the song that plays whenever Dan asks “So what are wrong today Arin?” the song is by Glaciære, Island. Thought I might pass on this information :)
Disney?
Why do I always make the mistake of watching 10MPH whilst eating dinner OTL
They look sleepy
I don't like those intros that spoil the video -w-
What’s even funnier is that there’s a company that sells even smaller hands that goes on each of the fingers of the small hands they were using. I don’t think you would be able to get anything done with them but it would be pretty funny.
I love when Arin goes homunculus mode
That ending though was so funny! It was just like the "MOAR" scene XD
I haven't heard Arin call Dan 'Danny' in so long it actually caught me by surprise at 8:47
Kill a lizard 🦎
killll
Has anyone found the commercial? lol
Best episode this season so far!!! I'm so glad we're back to "Letting Arin and Dan play with niche and gross toys" 10MPH. ❤️ That's my favorite kind of content.
omg! lol
I want to see Dan and Arin eat a lizard like Alligator meat jerky ^o.+^
did that say decatheter?
First of all. Aaron you can definitely finish to this haha
Sometimes I forget that Dan is 43
Kill the lizard
Yup I got that it was a PBS parody
I want them to kill a lizard, but I don’t think Arin will be able to go through with it
The sparkles after the tiny high five made my entire day :))
11:11 - 11:17 legitamitálly had me crying laughing, just the sheer joy and humor, I love Arin
This made me roll
So that last game is just something you can do once right? Like you can't re-goo it.
Many hands make for light work and all that
why would anyone buy their child that last toy?
Peace was never an option, Dan.
I love that it doesn't need to be a video game for them to be true to themselves. They found the treasure in the brain and were still like "Where's the thing!"
Well this that weird.
I would like you to kill a lizard. A giant monster lizard. I'm talking about Monster Hunter. I want you two to play Monster Hunter rise and kill giant lizards.
0:47 1:59
At 8:30 the video parallels the animation of the ten minute power hour abridged. Thumbs up guys.
oml i haven't seen PBS in such a long time, but yes i understood the reference lol
Can we have a full version of the ten minute power hour intro a whole song would be sick
Arin screaming in the plastic makes me think of the scene from The Blob when the first kid gets eaten
im so freaking glad 10mph is back
Arin going completely feral with the slime by the end had me twisting in my chair laughing
This is stupid. In a bad way
“Mrs. Johnson, I’m sorry to say it, but we lost your husband.” “He had paper clips all up in his everything.”  - Dr. Daniel Sexbang and Dr. Arnold Handsome, 2022
Kill thy lizard
yes i actually got the PBS reference at the end having grown up on a lot of their stuff. Thank You👍
Wow Dan sucks at Jenga lol. You're not supposed to grab so close to the top too bruh 🥲
*I WANT YOU TO BRING BACK THE OLD INTRO MUSIC THIS NEW ONE SUCKS BUTT ON FIRE...* 🤨🙄
I havent seen TMPH in so long! And as a 42YO watching a 43YO getting frustrated at kids games, I find it very cathartic.  Splendid work boys, you're the real Lovelies.
When it comes to the 10MPH, peace was never an option for Arin.
I think whoever is coming up w the ideas for this is just making it over complicated with rules instead of just letting them have fun and be creative. No need for tiny hands or anything extra added.
This video made my day. Thank you, Grumps!
I firmly believe the ghost of Founding Father, George Washington, lives in that shibari unicorn over Dan's shoulder. Poor guy, get well soon.
the alien surgery genuinely makes me feel bad for the poor alieum they brutally dissected :C
Kill a lizard, obliterate that reptile, slice the scaly sucker, flambé the freaky fucker, digest upon their mother, and lure their lewd lover longingly into a lavishing lair of a grizzly bear
This is somewhat nauseating to watch once you get to the bug.
It's great to see them but I don't enjoy game grumps anymore, I just watch to try to use the nostalgia effect to try to find some happiness in life
Arin screaming into the void at the end had me rolling.
wait, did they replace the plastic pieces in Operation with metal paperclips which will set off the buzzer when they are successfully grabbed? that's either impressive cruelty or stupidity
This isn't a power hour get bent.
there is something to be said about the imagery that only the 10MPH can accomplish. Two middle aged men, both with miniature hands on their  fingers. With one smacking a toy alien with a spanking paddle while the other watches in astonishment.
I see that wedding ring! Congratulations Dan. <3
The editing in this one is particularly tickling my fancy
Lol Ariel's knife
What do we do if we don't want you to kill a lizard?
There's something both hilarious and kinda disturbing about a toy that encourages you to rip its guts out and crack its skull in
Big Ace Ventura 2 vibes when Dan stretched that goop over his face and started screaming
2:40  it does comes with instructions instruction one: panda.
I looked up the Treasure X aliens commercials and I can't tell which one you did, they all sound _almost_ like you, Arin. They all sound good tho, so well done!
can you guys put some merch out that relates to the fan base being called lovelies. like uh a shirt that says "im lovely" or sumn.
all the extra editing goofs for sound and visuals are a chef's kiss.
Arin in the target audience for that toy
FYI youre supposed to combine the yellow thing with the skele-man and put them in the brain and then bug does something
read the title, thought "thats weird i wonder what this episode will be like/about", if you asked me after watching the video i would have no answer for you. love it
dan is the bob ross of opening boxes.
wait an extra week for 3 more minutes of content
Arin would be the kinda person to play Rock every time 😅😂
I love how chaoticly this devolves. lol
Ah. Any power hour without some rando "special" guest is a good power hour.
dan loves that paddle
The fact that Ethan still lives on in these videos as his undies wrapped around that poor sheep
Please don't kill a lizard.
Still can't find that treasure x commercial.
kill a lizard
GET BIGGER HANDS!!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
that bug is so cool and fun and cool!!!
I missed their flirting with each other, I'm glad power hour is officially back! Arin and Dan are involved in one of my all-time favorite content creator bromances and it gives me such serotonin
BUT HANG ON HAS ANYONE FOUND THE COMMERCIAL VOICED BY ARIN
I think Arin was lying about the size of his butthole, but that’s just me.
Arin screaming into the slime thing at 11:38 had me rolling, omg
Arin hanson is why they put asphyxiation warnings on childrens toys i swear! XD
"We got paper clips all up in his everything." 🤣🤣🤣
Curse you comic sans!
The extreme variety of Dan expressions
Best episode in a long time!
Either it’s their level of fun or the editing, but this episode feels like season one. 😊👍
11:09 he looks so happy
A comment
Kill that FUCKIN LIZARD!!!!! With kindness 😃
Ehh, not your best.
They really have just run out of ideas already, huh.
Sargeant Stun? OF COURSE! -Arin Hanson, 3 years ago
kill a lizard
Kill a lizard, please.
I forget that Dan is as old as my mom 😵‍💫
forty eight???????????? Dan looks 32 MAX.
I've scrapped the brain out of a dead bird's skull through the neck hole and the damn dissection toy was still more disgusting than doing that.
Arin "Can You Feel the Finger In There" Hanson.
I haven't laughed out loud much to these new episodes of 10mph yet, but I can absolutely tell how much more creative, interesting, and insane this show is and has been compared to the worn-out and boring formula of the Game Grumps lets play episodes
tiinyyyy hands!
i love how ethan's underwear is still wrapped around that sheep
bug toy seems so wasteful, you make a huge mess then throw a bunch of plastic parts into a landfill.
Editing is especially on one today. Props to the editor. Love it
A
I know it may be a bit much to ask, now that the power hour has finally returned, but will *Good Content™* ever make a return?
i cant stop smiling.
Vote here for dead Lizard 🦎
Volume warning bc Arin truly just starts screaming at the end lmfao
Will you kill the lizards that roam on my porch and watch me whilst I sleep?
Dan's 43 already? it feels like he was 39 only last year. lol
LOL. Many hands make light work.
4:35 The way he started patting the jenga block lmao
Trying to eat lunch at work, and the end bit where Arin is forcing his face into that gel stuff .... Arin :Hey Dan Dan: What's up? Arin: PTERODACTYL SCREAM. Hurts trying to stifle laughter cuz you've got earbuds in and you're not alone in the break room >-<
Even Cheeseman can't compete with how disgusting the second half of this episode was.  I didn't say stop.
arin should have gotten 2 points as you can kill 2 birds with one stone. dude! learn the rules!
For just a moment Arin entered the "Grab my hand" voice
Still waiting for the day y’all get like 50 different temporary tattoos and give each other sleeves of nonsense
Arin ‘hey, Dan.’  Dan ‘whats up, Arin?’ Arin ‘WRARRRRGGG!’  Lol. I LOVE when Arin just goes BALLISTIC for NO REASON. 🤣 he kind of reminds me of my older cousin, accept he’s Male.
How many people also immediately searched up "treasure x commercial arin hanson"
GET BIGGER HANDS!
Please, Arin, don't kill a lizard.    _This message brought to you by your reptilian overlords._
Arin- “If you want us to kill a lizard, post it in the comments now.”   I have cats at home who sometimes play and kill lizards, and leave their corpse on the floor of my house. So I’m good, Thank you
That was the most honest “arin stop” I’ve heard out of Dan in a long time
get... bigger hands :(
You should do more of the treasure x stuff I think there’s dinosaur versions
Hey editors don't forget to add this to the playlist
KILL A LIZARD
THE TREASURE X COMMERCIAL HAS ALMOST 2 MILLION VIEWS AND COMMENTS TURNED OFF AHAHAHA  (Arin did a great job tho 👍)
Always go rock. Nothing beats a rock.
On one hand, the bug toy is pretty cool, on the other, why the hell would you pay more than $5 on a toy that you can literally only use ONCE.
This episode is so unhinged 😂
Can someone please find arins treasure x ad?
Hear me out Good Mythical Morning trades places with The Ten Minute Power Hour.
I looked up the treasure x ad out of curiosity and now my recommended tab is going to be flooded with kids toys. Fuck.
Brain had a moment ... thought they had huge hands ... there normal sized ... 🤫 ill just leave now
Arin with glitter on his face looked like a fucking crime scene
Editors trying hard to replicate Matt and Ryan and failing at it
After searching for the treasure x commercial with Arin.... I cant find crap
New sonic game new sonic game
I'm so glad you guys are doing 10 minute power hour again!!!
This is the hardest I've laughed at I think anything ever maybe. The concept. "I don't know that they've thought that far ahead" and then they haven't. He had paperclips all up in his everything. The cutaway sneeze scream. I literally had to pause the last bit with arin trying to put the bug sac over his head MULTIPLE TIMES bc I was in a fit. more of these, boys.
Watching this in my graduation cap, been enjoying GG since I was in elementary! Thanks for shaping who I’m (still) becoming!
"Hey Dan!" "What's up, Arin?" *screams of existential anguish*  That one got me real good.
When Dan reminded us that he was 43, I got a little sad
Watched this while eating my morning eggs. Let’s just say Dan gagging while Arin plays with snotty material is very appetizing
GET THE LIZARD
Do we know who’s been recording for the power hour? Since (if I’m not mistaken) Tucker went to go work at the SuperMegaPlex, a.k.a super mega office.
i absolutely adore the chaos in this one lmaooo
You gotta hand it to the grumps, they’re handling this really well. At no point did I think that they needed to get a grip, frankly I think they should be put under a wrist for their jokes, they clearly have a lot of time on their hands. Their jokes are getting out of hand.
Wait…is this a reupload? I swear I’ve seen the clip of the monkey pissing on Arin before
I NEED an episode where Dan just carefully opens kids toys and does commentary
I enjoyed the little star edit you did there when they high-fived with the tiny hands.
Damn i would play with that last toy
Strong Unus Annus vibes, I gotta say
This is now my favorite Power Hour video. I couldn't stop laughing when Arin put that stuff on his face 😭
Skull man looks like mojo jojo
Honestly watching you play with and open those alien things was kinda fun.
11:52 Arin briefly transforms into a TIE fighter
If Dan puts a hand on his monstrous thumbs, they'd have be regular sized. Then tiny hands on each of those fingers... It's turning into a Cyriak video.
I am here in case someone came to comment section looking for like-minded people who thought the doorbells when Arin hit the dinosaurs away in the intro was real
11:32  the build up, the screaming, the set-up, and *killer* punchline? Arin's a comedy genius.
Cheese 🧀 gromit
i want you guys to kill a lizard.
3:43 "there might be a rules card" deltarune chapter 2 stream confirmed
Did Dan get married?
Maybe one day I'll learn to not eat while watching these things...
I really love the editing on this one, the subtle little noise editing, keep it up!!
Arin's voice when he said "you were helping and now you're not! :(" sounded legitimately sad. XD it made ME sad for a moment.
I wanna know if this was the intended way to use the bug or if they went beyond and actually broke it.  But great episode. I like how uncomfortable Dan is.
Arin is a very special man
kill the lizard danny and arnold
Is Dan wearing pajamas
Kill a lizard
I really wanna hear the commercial so I tried finding it and I cant tell which voice is arin's lol
"Get bigger hands!"
Its not a PBS parody, this literally is Public Access TV. We've come full circle.
2:05 Yo bro do you think this coffee is too strong?
8:25 I can't tell if they're gaslighting me with intentionally bad subtitles or not.
That was surprisingly disgusting.
lol dan always knowing things about sports that no one knew were things in the first place
Did anyone else look up that commercial after Arin said he voiced it?
“GET BIGGER HANDS” -Game Grumps 2016
I’d love to see the animated version of this episode but the small hands are their real hands
4:50 10:)0
I looked up the commercials and it's true
KILL THE LIZZARD! KILL THE LIZZARD!
Kill the lizard
Kill the lizard
Please don’t kill a lizard 🙏❤️
11:52 why arin sound like a tie fighter
Yeah you might need to go to the dr, I feel like I've seen warning labels of not to let your children ingest this because it's toxic.
That camera break had me gasp. I know it was fake but that was alarming.
I'm a simple man, I see a Yaoi paddle on the thumbnail and I click
Please kill a lizard. I’m not a psychopath but I think it would be funny
Part of me hopes, that Arin near the end was trying for an Ace Ventura 2 reference.
You ever think danny and arin stop and look at them selves and think, we are both 30+ and this is our job
Didn't know Dan was so young. He acts like a crusty old man sometimes
you guys got me through some difficult times, you are always making me smile and laugh, thank you for your videos!
Man, I wanna see Arin's Treasure X commercial, but I haven't found it.
i love game grumps so much but i cant justify 90 bucks for a set if PJ... no matter how much i really want them
Not even one “grab my hand” reference from Heave Ho….
I've been searching for Arin's commercial and I can't find it and now youtube is going to think I want children's toy commercials
I love these new Power hours and all, but it seems like they are censoring themselves a bit more. A lot less swearing and all that. Anyone else notice? I dont hold it against them, im sure they have a good reason.
the operation game was..... familiar....
10:34 the way the head just crumples more and more with each hit.
Did I just watch them perform insect vivisection..?
its so nice of dan to play with arin after suffering brain damage from creator clash.
Kill a lizard
Me finding the Treasure X youtube channel and seeing that comments are disabled on ALL videos: 🤔
I regret eating during the alien surgery
Seeing Dan with his wedding ring on just makes me feel so happy 😭
MATT COME BACK!! they devolved into chaos again xD
When Arin asked for a clip of his voice over to be put up i briefly hoped that instead they would put up one of the voice over bits he did on In Space with Markiplier where he loses his mind. The monkey was a great one to use instead though!
Every single person involved in this video and watching this video will be dead one day. It's my greatest wish that long after we're all dead that another intelligent life form finds these videos and NOTHING else. I want videos like this to be the only be surviving evidence of humanity's existence.
It's funny to see Ethans boxers still on the lamb in every video
That alien brain looks even more delicious than tide pods and I dont say that lightly
why do they spoil partof  the episode at the beginning i alrdy clicked the episode its not like they have to sell me on it at this point
props to the editors, some really good gags in this one
every new ep i have to congratulate show feet guy
👱🏼‍♀️Me”Oh Yaaaaaaaa!!”  *Kool-Aid Man,Jumps Through,Game Grumps,Wall!!*😉🥤👨🏻
Oh man, tiny hands AND Operation? Looks like someone is going to be sleeping with the fishes!
I want an alien bug dissection thing now. I don't even care if there are gems or not.
The monkey pissing.
I want you to kill a lizaed
Sexuality 4:59              You can’t kill me arin I don’t care how many people comment  The only lizard allowed to kill me is ME You can’t stop this disco, pal. love ya
2:02 - ...............w h y ? ........ 7:13 - I love that Holy shit dude
Aron looking jacked
💖💖💖
Never expected a Fire in the Sky reference with the Grumps but, here we are.
Please only do PBS Parodies to end the videos because YES, I GOT IT WAS A PBS PARODY AND YOU TOOK ME BACK TO WHEN I SHAT MY PANTS WATCHING SID THE SCIENCE KID
We have evolved from crumching to stretching.
Why didn’t they use the actual tiny hand sleeve things that were a trend a while ago? I feel like whoever is in charge of the props and games on this season slightly misses the mark a lot and gets things that aren’t quite suitable
Maybe I'm just getting old or something but these new 10 minute power hours just don't have the same magic they used to. Arin also seems more annoyed about doing the 10mph these days.
Dont kill a lizard! My bearded dragon Persephone watches this show!
Certified lizard owner here, you wouldn't even have to do anything, he's really stupid.
Arin: Hey Dan. Dan: What's up Arin? Arin: ÀÉÕÚéÏÄÜ
I liked the pbs parody thank you for the nostalgia
😂😂😂😂😂
....................... Can the lizard be a sitting Senator named Mitch McConnel? Cause if so.. yes. Please.
11:40 How I feel about trying to get something approved from healthcare through worker's compensation in the US.
1 MILLION SUBS LETS GO!!!
I have never made my neck look more like a thumb in my entire life than when the gel sacks came out, there was screaming, and some mention of gems
Yaoi paddle, weren't they banned?
Kill a lizard
Nothing better than seeing grown-ish men going absolutely insane with children's toys
Katya is somewhere nearby, searching for her bag of tiny hands and there will be HELL to pay when she finds them
the segment of arin screaming into the bug skin sack made me think about how much of my waking and sleeping time is spent watching these two people and just reflecting
Arin HAND-son Danny sex….hand   I don’t fucking know
Godzilla. Must. Die! Kill that lizard! (Chant x3)
I want you to kill a lizard
Shut the f*ck up, is it every other Monday again! Hell yeah
Why would anyone get their kid a toy that is purposely gross and meant to be broken as the way to "play" with it? Do your kid a favor and get them literally any other toy.
The operation game with baby hands reminded me of something.....unus annus
i miss the old sax intro..
I’m surprised no one made the obvious jokes of Arin Hand-son and Dan Avi-hand.
(sniffle) I don't know, man, those... those are pretty average s-sized hands.
I saw that Treasure X Aliens commercial Arin voiced, and gotta say... Arin teaching children about vivisection is so on brand I thought it was just a different 10 Minute Power Hour.
“He has paperclips all up in his everything” is a good bit
0:56 - Dang it guys, I thought my doorbell had actually rung! XD
Arin Hanson unleashing his inner 8 year old!
I am certain that Arin has, at some point in his life, tried to fit his entire body inside a condom, and I am relatively sure that he succeeded.
if my memory is correct i believe the grumps said they would go to disneyland at 1 million subs
I thought they were helping the bug give a c-section birth, but then Arin smashed it's brain open.
"Isn't there a thing that lets you square it away" -He says after he destroyed the BOX!
I would love for Dan and Arin to kill a lizard
why do i feel like that bug thing was one of those discontinued toys that should show up on one of those discontinued toys for boys videos
Dan randomly coming in with the yaoi paddle killed me
I'm gonna be that guy... I miss when they had more original ideas and went to unique places. Now it's just grown men playing with children's toys, worse than an actual child would. It seems like they are relying on others to produce these things and are trying their best with what they are given. Dan actually looked checked out in this one. On a positive note, the editing has improved.
Arin asking "how many are there?" knowing that they didn't actually plan 10 events shows why he's the big rat that makes all of the rules
🤣😂👍
This was disgusting and unsettling. 10/10 Would dissect an alien again
They could literally just sit there and I’d be entertained
Please kill a lizard
Thank you for this Arin, this is going to haunt my nightmares for years to come  11:43
I don’t know if it’s just me but I think it’s would be so funny to just watch them play with treasure x toys for an episode.
"It's a decathlon so there's 10." "I don't know if they thought that far." ((laughter of shame in the background))  I love all you guys so much
I feel like the level of effort being put into these videos is less and less, and everyone is just hedging their bets on Dan and Arin being funny enough to make the video good.
Nurse Bussiness: "I'm sorry Mrs. Johnson, but your husband has passed...." Dr. Hanson: "Yeah, he had clips all up in his bizzz~."
Kill a lizard
ok but which commercial was it??????
As a big nerd toy collecting they those "you only get to play with this once" toys distress me greatly
Died at 9:31. "Grab on!" Best reference. Yes. Yes indeed.
While I love these episodes, I hope they do something new soon.
3:43 Rouxls Kaard?
[rips up box] SHOULDN’T THIS COME WITH SOMETHING TO MAKE IT EVEN?
An example of classic comedic duo routine: 1:46 "Rock beats ROCK!!!" "Noo it doe- WhAt?!"
Arin's lil PBS parody at the end made me frighteningly aware of how great a radio voice he has when he's not screaming and making poop noises.
9:26 for when Danny completes.
still no "GET BIGGER HAAAANDS!" joke? Im so dissapointed guys....
"He had paperclips all up in his everything" 😂😂😂
4:12 took me tf out lmao
I don't know what a "decatheter" is supposed to be but I'm going to choose to believe the editor made it up just to see who actually read the subtitles because the other option is horrifying.
KILL A LIZARD
That doorbell when you knocked off the dinosaurs made me think I had a visitor. I then realised my house doesn't have a doorbell.
the Operation bit gave me Unus Annus flashbacks
tags: S U R G E R Y  T U T O R I A L
As a dog owner, I give this episode a tiny middle figure for having a double doorbell sound at 0:55 😖
There have been some shitty premises for this show before but this one really takes the cake. Maybe time to stop the power hour if you can't think of shit to do
Lol Dan freaking out over the goo coming out was the absolute best!🤣
Just listening to the audio without watching the screen makes for a whole different experience 😅.
dan's stare at 2:01 brought up the same terror i'd feel when going into my grandma's basement and seeing the two creepy dolls she had stored in the corner staring at me. his gaze reminded me of the damp smell and always present feeling of some sort of presence in the corner. i havent felt that in a long time lol
The Tooky jenga is actually from a company/website that makes educational and therapeutic toys for kids! I work with kids and buy from them fairly often because the toys' designs are often geared towards being educational, sensory friendly, or therapeutic in some way. The Tooky jenga is good for young children learning animals, colors,  OCD management, and frustration tolerance.
I'm so glad power hour is back c: This made me giggle so many times. SO MANY TIMES!
Has anyone been able to figure out which of those treasure x commercials Arin did voice over for?
I would enjoy to See Dan and Arin see a lizard
I require the Treasure X AD please...
Whoever edits is amazing
The pbs parody hit hard
Dan really tried to say "it's a peace sign" like a rock doesn't beat that too
this is why they have to put choking hazard warnings on toys
So glad I watched this while eating lol
YOOOOO you guys should have brought dr sung on for this one
Arin “I don’t want peace. I want problems, always.” Hanson.
0:55 i thought that someone was ringing at my door!
The Arin Hanson cunnilingus experience - where he just yells at your vagina.
Dan being freaked out by little hands is great 😆 I wonder if baby's hands freak him out? Lol
comment 420💪 anyways screw the lizard
game grumps can you kill a lizard please
You fools. Obviously bird is double susceptible to rock which is why you can kill two of them with a single stone.
Arin: "If you want us to kill a lizard post it in the comments now."  Well don't kill it but...  Do what I did in highschool with recently unalived creatures. Dissect a worm, then a larger bug, then try to go up from there before it finally gets to gross for you two, or gets demonetized(maybe all of these are...)
WOOO!
Kill a lizard
Dan: "Why is there a yaoi paddle" Dan and yaoi paddle in every subsequent episode:
for some reason around the 9:30 mark, my visuals went black and all I had was audio, and I gotta say. that was an experience leaving those sounds it up to my interpretation
can you guys do a video of you killing lizards with a rock?
The old Dissect An Alien toys were better.
Oh god david cheeseman looking rough at the end there
THAT TINY HI-FIVE OH MY GOD 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Lolol that ending  Throwback PBS 🤣🤣💀
Can someone tell me the name of the commercial that arin did for the big thing?
Sent some Operation replacement pieces to the Grumps PO Box The chances of them getting them is slim but still greater than 0 :p
I'm more confused than anything
God i love Danny and Arin so much i'd dedicate an entire country to their name !
"Look, Dan, I'm a porpoise." You owe me a new keyboard I spit my water EVERYWHERE. Lol!!
Please link the commercial Arin did for the alien! I've been trying to find it. Also, please kill a lizard.
I’m sorry but that last bit was hilarious and reminded me of one of them old abduction movies, also as a grown man I want to play with that alien thing as well cause ya both made it look so interesting with your shenanigans
they finally found the perfect toy for arin with the gross break apart goo bug
kill the lizard
What’s up with al lot of the captioning being wrong?
Please someone animate the audio for the alien dissection…
I wanna say yes kill a lizard. But, Arin mentioned how much he liked them and how he tried to avoid running them over with his bike back who knows how long ago. So please no lizard kill
"I'm sorry ma'am but after a gruesome 13hr operation (with tiny hands on) your son was not able to make it lol"
They can cut me open next, I got paperclips AND gems.
do an episode where you do old internet challenges and whoever handles it the best gets an amount of points
When do we see Dan with his wife in 10MPH, be cute for all of them to make some chaos
Grats on 1 million subs!!!!
The Yaoi paddle once again steals the show. Too bad they didn't have a tiny yaoi paddle for the tiny hands.
No don't kill a lizard! They're really neat! Bring a lizard on and pet it
to be fair a 5 game decathalon seems on track for a show called 10minute power hour
This reminds me of the iconic Arin "MOOOOAAARRRRRR" moment
1:31 i think you'll find dan that you double lose as many people can kill 2 birds with 1 stone
The cut right after Dan smashes the giant bug after exclaiming “Ah a Giant bug!” Was absolutely perfect  Also yes, I got the PBS parody
The glass breaking affect was great.
So amazing screenshots lmao
I love how Dan has to include the yaoi paddle into every power hour now
Arin stretching the goo on his face literally looks like that scene from the Blob 🤣
What if they were being held hostage this entire time and guests are brought in to make that Stockholm syndrome more effective
"That's going down on, like, turn 2"  "Good, that's your turn"  There's something so true to life about this.
Dan Avidan…is 43 years old?!  Good for him, I hope I’m dissecting lizards at 43.
I know not a lot of people will understand this, given the wacky sense of humor you guys have, but my cat of 15 years passed away this weekend, and this video is the only thing that made me genuinely laugh during this hard time.  So thank you Arin and Danny, keep on making us laugh and bringing light into an otherwise dark world.
Please do not kill a lizard.
Is that alien bug thing’s sole purpose to get opened and destroyed like once? Very wasteful toy, why.
i wasn't paying attention, the doorbell got me
Baby hands Operation
I don’t know if people are commenting this at all, but I kinda hope they are cause I’d say it’s necessary feedback. The short preview of the episode before the episode begins isn’t great. Every time I skip over it and I think it’s wholly unneeded. Thank you for reading this and also not reading it.
nothing like recreating the ace ventura thing
Awesome
This is the worst episode yet, I love it
Please restock the pi jams pants 😭 i really want a pair.
@3:24 Yup, I was just wondering if there'd be a... so they'd be able to... Uhhh,... just "Yup."
kill a lizard
does anyone know which Treasure X ad has Arin’s voiceover?
10:13 Nice job with that product placement.
very small hands
5:19 the fuck is a "pentakalon"? You mean a pentathlon?
I have only 1 of these little rubble hands. I wanna get 9 more so I can put one on each finger and wriggle them at people
Suprised "Dan... grab m' hand" didn't appear as much as I thought it would lol
_Operation_ is just the third 10mph member at this point.
anyone else get ptsd/flashbacks to the 1993 sci-fi/horror movie "Fire in the Sky" due to that last part?
How many 10MPHs do you think can be described as, “the miracle of birth?”
Grumps: Pull out tiny hands and Operation Unus Annus fans: *PTSD*
Does anyone know which episode has Dan asking “Are you ready, Arin?” and then smacking his head into Arin’s back?
Get these the hell outta here! -Fuyuhiko
I want a list of every product Arin has ever voiced for. I would BUY EVERY PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE HE WAS IN IT* IF ONLY MORE PEOPLE WOULD HIRE HIM  *I GUARANTEE IT**  **(not guaranteed)
Who else went looking for the commercial Arin did?
GET BIGGER HANDS!!!
Peace? Snow peas.
I don't know why but that alien toy unlocked a memory from the ancient times of the late 90's. Some kind of toy I had that was an insect/alien/thing with goop inside, and you dissected it or something. It's wrinkling my brain trying to remember more clearly.
I don't remember this episode of Trauma Center: 2nd Opinion.
Man it's awesome getting a power hour for my birthday. Thanks Game Grumps!
I have. The PBS trademark. _Ingrained into my head._
Not the yaoi paddle used for rib breakage
what was the actual point of that creature thing, besides turning every child that played with it into a psychopath LMFAO. Gotta teach em young I suppose. "NO, you don't understand mom! I have to slice this persons abdomen open and smash their skull to find the secret gems!!"
8:45 Arin calls him 'Danny' and I'm 90% sure he's called him that before but it just don't sound right xD
Is this a re-upload? I swear I’ve seen this exact title and thumbnail weeks ago and I’m big tripping. Someone save me, plz!
In the intro, what’s the one where they look like they’re at medieval times
I love how this is the one game arin looks for the instructions for
seeing dan beat the fuck out of a toy alien patient with a yaoi paddle affected me psychologically
KISS A LIZARD
when when when will i learn not to put these on while im eating
Kill a lizzard
I want you guys to gently hold a lizard and pet it.
Arin demonstrating why the age limits on toys are insufficient
08:42 on really has potential
I'm surprised this is the first time we've heard Dan shout, "Arin, stop!" with that inflection.
that hand monster from Elden ring that's what this reminds me of
doorbell sound effects in videos should be illegal
I think the "Arin STOP!" at 11:23 legit scared Arin for a second 🤣
11:34 Ladies and Gentlemen. Arin Hanson. CEO of Game Grumps.
kill a lizard
"Quote." - Name Year
Playing Operation with tiny hands? Why do I feel like I've seen that in a YouTube video before... **distant clock ticking sounds**
Was this intentional? 7:57
I love this mouuuuuch!!! From the creepy hand clapping to the slamming of the yoai paddle 🤣🤣
Can Aaron make do the SFX for a llama simulator?
ill be honest its been a while since i had a laughing fit watching a Ten min power hour.... good god my sides....
Arin, doing something he isn't supposed to do: Man this is really hard
That doorbell made me go check my door you asses!!
but where’s the commercial Arin was talking about???
12 minutes. Damn, sure am glad I waiting 2 weeks for these longer episodes they promised us.
The moment I saw operation come out I saw Ethan going "Oh my God" in my head. Unus Annus
I do NOT want you to kill a lizard.
For how much these two love the Nihon, i have YET TO SEE A JAPANESE POWER HOURRRRRTRRR
There definitely needs to be a Treasure X Ten-minute Power Hour for the Grumps to do in the near future
Not me trying way too hard to find arins treasure x voice over
I got a pringles ad…
As a Midikal Profeshunal, I can confirm that most dissections begin with a yaoi paddle.
kill a lizard
Even though I know our door bell is broken and has been for years, it was so authentic that I had to rewind to make sure.
Time for me to watch 10 hours of treasure x commercials to see if its arin or not
my two favorite idiots
Love this episode!
From the moment Arin first saw the goo pod, I knew it was going on his face.
Every time I watch power hour I'm on my lunch break and every time I feel a deep, visceral regret at my choices
They now need to do the same games but mega giant hands
So we just don’t get to see the Arin voiceover of treasure x
“Can you feel the finger in there” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was eating breakfast. Not anymore
Well, this quickly devolved into nothing.
I'd love to see you two kill a lizard! Maybe with tiny hands for it's tiny body? Great idea. Super excited! 👍
It's nice to see Godrick the Grafted found a part time job as a surgeon.
Don't kill helpless the lizard, that started big trouble last time long long ago
little bird fly away
Wow that thing is disgusting I want one
Someone should make the fire in Dan's eyes a meme template
Unus Annus Baby Hands Operation, anyone?
1:59 This few seconds of Game Grumps brought to you by David Lynch.
the grumps
Dan……. Thanks for the monkey pissing……
I love Dan’s bit of doing things slowly and carefully
Dang, what a wasteful toy tho. How is that even legal?
6:01
So wait, that giant bug thing is a toy you play with once and then that's it? That seems like a huge waste of money and also also just going straight into a landfill.
"Peace wasn't good enough for arin hanson" being the entire story behind the tournament of gamers lol
Always thought the warnings about plastic bags were for toddlers. My bad, apparently  they were for Arin, who sees a bug stomach toy and immediately thinks🤣 "How can I get this on my head as fast as possible?
Well done on achieving 1 million subs
So much of this audio can be taken wildly out of context
So glad Mr Johnson didn't make any movies....or was a sports entertainer...
I missed this
"Mazel-tov! It's an it!" Is an underrated Dan quote
Someone's having a lot of fun with the edits.
I remember this part of Elden Ring.
Do you think these have gotten maybe TOO unscripted?
Any sound engineer/music producer/ whatever that uses a doorbell or police siren sound effect, I would immediately fire.
Everybody who works for GameGrumps: "So this is Arin Hanson, founder and owner..." Arin: 11:52
Screaming into the rubber must be an iconic fucking clip
A good one
I love how much mileage Dan gets out of the yaoi paddle XD
The sound effects are spot on today
Arin Tiny Hanson
I am emotionally scarred
GET BIGGER HANDS!!!
don't kill lizards
i need to stop watching game grumps at work because good lord arin screaming into that sack or whatever nearly had me on the floor
I want y’all to kill a lizard.
Day six of asking the grumps to continue hollow knight
hell yeah
Dan and Arin fight a Komodo Dragon to death next episode
I think you guys should LOVE a lizard :)
You have to put David cheeseman out of his Misery
Please do not kill a lizard.
Please don't kill a lizard, lol...
Them playing operation with the tiny hands just gives me flash backs to unus annus🖤🤍
I can totally send a couple of Florida iguanas if you guys want. They're super invasive So it's encouraged to kill 'em
ayo that pbs style ending tho
Someones a little handsy! The hand jokes are gonna get out of hand
11:52 Excellent Tiefighter impression
I would in fact like to see you guys kill a lizard please and thank you
LOVE GAM GUMP
Solid T-Rex impression 11:53
I definitely got off to this episode with my tiny hand job.🤣
has anyone found the commercial Arin is talking about, i need to see it , i NEED to
kill a lizard
How hard would it be to send someone to go buy a new operation if your operation was missing pieces?  YOU LAZY FUCKS.  I blame Ally.
Ok...but why do I kinda want that dissection toy?
This video is how i imagine Shaq lives on a daily basis with small things 🤣🤣
That alien x toy was so violent😂😂
"Shouldn't it come with a little thing so you can just shoop and square it up?" That's called the box, Arin. The box you ripped apart was made for that.
Did I detect the Enter Shikari riff at 6:35?
I love seeing men and their 30’s and 40’s play with kids toys :)
I thought these new episodes were supposed to be longer
Cc: you might need Ariel’s knife Me: who’s Ariel?!
Arin reminds me of that kid in biology class that would play around with the dissected frog that was full of eggs
i just love the gamely glomps! daniel and arinson are my favourite people!
I tried to find the toy commercial he voiced and I couldn't find it
2:22
8:02 - Arin dissecting an alien bug: 'Twerking! TWERKING!'
Neat.
this was posted like an hour ago but did anyone else feel like in the beginning they could have just...put all hands on their 3 fingers instead of only picking one to put on?
Their fucking ripping into that bug is a one to one remake of the disection scene from star ship troopers
DONT YOU DARE KILL A LIZARD ARIN!
Dan: It's a decathlon, so there are ten events. Arin: Idk that they thought that far ahead  Fuckinnnn' Arin Hanson with the SALT damn
I feel like we aren’t giving enough credit to “and the bird flies away”
Don’t kill a lizard. Love ALL the lizards!  **ohhhmmm**
I'm actually really upset they didnt put in the commercial clip, i wanted to hear it!
0:54 omg I thought this was my doorbell so I got up to check LOL
random doorbell noises give me an extreme feeling of anxiety, had to go back a bit to make sure it was a SFX and not real
I think this was the only episode so far where I have stressed out due to the difficulty of the activity.
NOOOO, DON'T KILL THE LEEZARD!!!!!
thanks guys for being here on the days where i really don't want to keep going. i cant miss out on my daily favorite guys.. the ones who treat me right
No matter what they’re doing they look like 2 brothers that hate each other but are forced to hang out with each other
Rip camera lens
Who wants another Ross episode?
I started dying in the start from Dan's  "Arin! STAHHHP"
OMGOMGOMOMGOMGOMG out of nowhere last night I binged about 46 episodes of 10MPH, and here's why. CAN IT BE!? AAHH
I want the grumps to kiss a lizard.
‘Hey, Dan!’  ‘What’s up, Arin?’ ‘HUUUUAGGHHHH!’  Wonderful.
11:56
Dan's 'nam flashback moment would make a great gif
This power hour felt a lot more like S1, real snappy and fun; the show definitely works better in short 10 min chunks rather than near 30 minute episodes
For a man who hates gooey shit on his face, Arin never ceases to go to 11 on the gooey shit on his face
I always loved those mini hand finger puppet things. I used to work in a toy store and when we got them in stock the first time I started sticking them on the arms of dolls or stuffed animals or on reindeer horns during Christmas and see how long it took before people noticed.
now i need to see that commercial
I'm in the hospital possibly awaiting surgery and somehow I find this very comforting to watch I don't know why but it is
this has to be one of the best episode in a long time. just another banger of an episode for the playlist.
Why is Arins hair always tied up? Let the beauty flow!!
You give me just 20 minutes and even I could come up with a better idea for a power hour episode than this lol
that toy seems like a major waste of money, I mean, it's cool, but once you use it, that's it, makes no sense.
2:03 zoomed in on dan's face in HD 4K is something i never knew i wanted until now
You know what they say about small hands. That’s good, because I don’t.
The camera crack actually made me think it broke
I wanna see Aron kill a Lizard
Congratulations Mrs.Johnson, your husband's paperclip transplant was a success.
I love the power hour, but the end when they were picking up the snot legit made me gag >.<
The last part with that toy was hilarious. Always laugh at Dan being grossed out by anything
This reminds me so much of the chocolate fountain video from Cold Ones, everything derailed and devolved so quickly it felt like a 3 minute episode.
The commercial Arin mentioned is a Treasure X Aliens TV spot titled "Ooze". Found it by googling and yup, that's definitely an Arin voice 😂
I keep thinking of the Unus Annus tiny hands video and the Ethan “Oh my fucking God” meme.
Peace was in fact never an option.
Get bigger hands!
God i love you and arin so much, thank you for making content and your team too! Alli is awesome too!!
KILL THE LIZARD!!
new mothers : eat the placenta  arin: covers his face in it and screams
Arin "Tiny Hand"son
There is so much tism in this video.
The tiny hand clapping is unsettling
Really stepped up the editing! It accentuated the humour without drawing too much focus.
Who produced and gave the all right for this episode lol
KILL A LIZARD
What started off as a pretty slow episode really really went off the fucking rails quickly lol
anyone else trying to find the commercial arin voice acted? 😂
Wait a second there... is this a toy channel?? qwq
Kill the lizard
Kill
Can we just take a moment to notice Danny looks like Weird Al in this video? (Unless that really is WA and Danny’s probably singing about somebody that he used to know polka style).
“Can you just put an image of like…a monkey pissing?”
We're gonna need a bigger hands
5:34 sneaky fart
I had some of these and I touched my dad's arm with them. He looked out the window and sighed for a long ass time. I'm a disappointment.
ethan’s underwear in the back gets me every time
I don't know why, but I especially like the editing this episode. So many funny flourishes. Give the editing bay tiny hand high-fives for me!
"I don't understand the *premises* anymore"  I'm about to preeeeeeeee....mise.
Pls don't kill a lizard :(
I'm fucking dead xD
Dan: "You threw (the instructions) away" Me: Yeah, that's an Arin move
the raw “boys will be boys” energy of this episode is divine
No joke... I'm obsessed with Treasure X. And now knowing Arin did a voice for one of the commercials, I love it even more.
I actually thought someone was at my door there for a sec... Which was surprising, because 1) I have my door open because jesus christ its hot rn, and 2) I'm sitting by the window and saw no one approaching the door. "You've screwed me for the last time, Hanson!" seems like an appropriate quote  And please don't kill the lizards
Patreon can fuck off. Why would I pay for something thats used to be free and has diminished in quality?
I have to say I'm not entirely sure who the doofus in the merch department made the call to charge 45 per portion of those pajamas instead of one price for the set but that guy probably needs to re evaluate things
don't kill a lizard, you have a perfectly good Jori
Not gonna lie... that bug discretion toy actually seems like fun.   I always hated one-use toy gags, because they felt like a scam. But the goopiness sells it for me.
KILL A LIZARD!
Dan screaming, "I'M A 43 YEAR OLD MAN YOU THINK I CAN JUST FIGURE OUT AN ANIMAL STACKING GAME" is the new highlight of my day
Props to the editors of this, they really do be elevating it to another level lol
Amazing Danny reactions in this one
Dan's getting grey beard hairs! It's too early! Someone stop time!
*Treasure X ad searches suddenly increase*
NEW POWER HOUR WAHOOOOO
Peace was never an option for Arin "Crimes Against Humanity" Hanson Edit: peace was never an option for Arin "Animal Cruelty" Hanson
KILLIZARD
im honestly surprised Ben Gleib didnt walk in to show you how its done.. that dude loves playing with his little hands.. very funny..
PLEASE BRING BACK TUCKER pay him whatever he wants please
So is this season 2 version of Airn saying "MORE" with that mouth thing. lol
7:30
0:55 I literally thought that was my doorbell for a sec
Arin wouldnt survive District 9
Kill the lizard
Heave-Ho throw back: Grab mah tiny hand!
The yaoi paddle is my favorite addition to the show
“Hey Dan” “What’s up Aaron?” AUUEUGH
oh my god, Arin woke up and chose to be UNHINGED today! What was going on there with the bug goo, send help!!
not really a fan of the hand bit, it kind of just makes them not able to do anything, and it's not super funny on its own.
That was fun
I think this video unlocked a near fear in me....tiny rubber hands  make that two new fears....tiny rubber hands and goo pods    XD
The yaoi paddle sound effects are so fun
"infact it was a Peace sign, but apparently peace wasn't good enough for Arin"  Peace was never an option!
You guys never fail to put a smile on my face!
"Are We Using These? I Don't Know."  👆 a great alternative show title if they ever get tired of using "10 Minute Power Hour"
That ARIN STOP really sounded like Dan was getting murdered.
Peace was never an option
Arin streching the goop over his face made me laugh way way more than it should have
ARIN'S PITS
KILL A LIZARD! Please!!!!!
still waiting for the bunny suit parkour thingy video.
DANS 43?!??? i knew he was an old man
missed opportunity to do a Flubber bit
7:00 Dan opening this so nicely reminded me of the "Every 10 Minute Power Hour in a Nutshell" animated so much XD
I'm a thirty year old adult and I desperately want one of those alien toys. Kids today get the coolest shit, istg.
I had a really bad yesterday... this video is a blessing for me... thank you GGs
Arin: Ew this is so gross I hate it Also Arin: *continues to play with it*
I feel like these “play operation but with small hands” is just doing the same thing over and over. I love you guys but please come up with better ideas for episodes ❤️❤️❤️ first season had better ideas imo
new meme moment right there best since the m&m one
What a treat, a 10 minute power hour for my birthday!
not sure about the seemingly added sound effecs on the goo lol. not really needed?
"It's more of a pentakalon" Ah yes, the ancient sport of "pentakalon", if you thought it was called "pentathlon" you are seriously mistaken.
That's what you two get for making fun of Toko and Natsuki  Bullying? Not cool, Hajime.
This actually made me gag
the cutting of the heart with the goop leaking out made me so upset it brought me to tears thank you 10 minute power hour 😊
Arin screaming into the improvised slime mask reminded me so much of the mouth guard chewing 🤣 I lost it. Love you guys, happy Monday lovelies! 🥰
Finally, we get to see the Magic Mike Fingers at work.  Truly a spectacle to behold!
I had to stop watching this for a bit when it got to the goo part because with all the screaming and squishing sounds I knew people were just going to think it was porn
Raise your hand if you also just YouTubed "Treasure X Aliens Commercial"
More giraffe town please
Best series!!!!!!!!!
Kill a lizard!  But only if it's an evil lizard
Kill a lizard
I had a dream that I was a Drill Sargeant in hell and the elevator plays the 10 minute power hour intro music. I was in heaven
big men with tiny baby hands will always be funny and I have no idea why
KILL A LIZARD !!!
Have we found the treasure x ad with arin yet?
That has to be the most disgusting toy ever. Who the hell wants to operate an alien bug and mess with goo
Watching this in secret because there's a bonus to the channel for quick views and we must feed the algorithm
do not kill a lizard or I will kill you
I have to give Arin and Dan a small hand for realistically recreating the medical practice of replacing bones with paperclips.
get bigger hands
Wow 57 seconds ago, 6 comments when all I see none, 16 likes and 1 view I love how confused YouTube is when a popular channel drops a video
Hmmmmm…..that’s a new ring on Danny. Will there be a Mrs. Sexbang????
Was just at tournie of gamers in Cleveland and it was amazing! Love you guys so much!!! 🥰
For the next power hour you guys should turn one of you into a mummy. Or Halloween depending on your availability.
Rock always beats peace
"He had paperclips all up in is everything..." -Dr. Arin Hanson 2022
If one of the first things you hear in the intro is “ARIN, STOP!”, then you know it’s gonna be a good episode 🤣🤣🤣
As the giraffe town World record holder, I never give up. I'm always going to be watching grumps. Here on out. Until and even after I've got to jam liquid game grumps up my pee hole, I'll be watching, no matter what channel your on. I fear that tomorrow our favorite giraffe will not return. Great video BTW as usual love the power hour :)
Their friendship is just beautiful, I love you guys so much. Thank you for your comedy and laughter :3
Hell yeah, always love when a new Power hour drops
"ARIN STOP" -Dan
YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHH BAYBEEEE
kill a lizard
ARIN, SS-SSTOP! I love this show
Hehehehehehe  Arin Hand son
It's that time of the month
I have a legit google calendar reminder every other week for these videos. I love it. AND I stopped listening to the new Distractible (Markiplier, Muyskerm, Lordminion777)  episode for this. Which take ls a lot for me to do.
you guys should steal the declaratoin of independence nick cage style
HAPPY MONDAY LOVELIES 💙🧡
AHHHHHHHHHH
Sayori hands
First..Dammit!
can't wait to see where they're trying to put their hands this time
👹 *GET BIGGER HANDS* 👹😤😤😤
The Rapture is coming. What they tell you after is a lie. They’ll say we were abducted by aliens (demons) Accept Jesus, don’t get left behind! Read Ezekiel 37-39, Daniel, and Revelation(see The Bible Project) ❤️
Maybe I do want you to kill a lizard. What would happen then hmm?
Been watching you guys for about 7-8 years now, and I love it. Keep it up guys.
Oh boy
EEEE
How about you CATCH THESE HANDS, GRUMPS?! (Oh wait arin already did try to catch some hands-)
I’m mildly concerned by the surgery tutorial tag, but I’ve also never been so excited.
Best part about Mondays! Even though its every other week
