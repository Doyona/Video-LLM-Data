Ksi is such a fake person, literally aged like milk this video
Duuuuude its not an achievement to have a sing with rick ross, stole freeway ricky ross' name, such a fraudster
Sexy accent!
KSI does not belong in a serious social education series like this. Hes nothing more than a shameless vacuous self promoter.
His youtube persona i've never really been into, watching him here is cool to see a natural side to him.
Got to respect the legacy he's created for himself. There will never be another KSI
KSI is a mega star now
This guy deserves everything he has earned, respect my lovely 💯✌🏽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧
Proud to say I've been a supporter since day 1, and to see the heights he's reached. KSI is truly a legend 🙌🏻
KSI needs lots is respect he's a amazing guy he  so talented and I think he deserves much more me and my brother whach him lots and all the time we love u 😊😊
litlle did he know he would start a buissnes with logan and become friends with him 2 years later yet he still hates jake
I find it so funny how this was 2 years ago u can really see how far he’s come in just 2 years and saying how he will never be friends with Logan and now Logan is his business partner and good friends crazy how much he’s matured and how far he’s come in boxing , music , YouTube honestly jj is carrying the uk rn @jjolatunji

Love the use of the word Twat... Such a British thing to say hahaha
Why me and Logan will never be friends…. Proceeds to make something called PRIME HYDRATION
"this is why me and logan will never be friends"   *starts a business with him and becomes really close with him*

True renaissance man but will his parents ever forgive him for not going to medical school?

"Logan and I will never be friends" oh boy this aged well....
“Me and logan will never be friends”
First forward a year and he’s made a drink’s company w Logan
I know it’s the accent but can we make it classy to call jake paul a tw*t? Please?
Cant stand him one bit 🤦‍♂️
This aged well “ I’ll never be friends with Logan “😂
“I will never be friends with Logan.”  Love the honesty

Our Fat Neek ❤
Me watching this again 1.5 years later and he is friends with Logan and has a business with him ahahah, guess you can be friends
Man said : he will never be friends with Logan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 , well that aged well
This didnt age well with the point of not being friends with Logan! Now they got that sweet PRIME together!
Education is key but it does not have to be formal education. As long as your learning something positive and beneficial in whatever your doing then you are growing
"Why me and Logan will never be friends" proceeds to become business partners and start a beverage company together.  A lot has happened in two years
O
So hes been in the game for 17 years CRAZY
Absolutely hate this wee @wat!
This show or wat u would call it is definitely dope n I can’t stop watching it great great content
4:31 says it like the fight didnt tripple his profits
1:12

Not friends with Logan ever???? Hhmmmmm.....
ex gangsters and youtubers?
Saying he will never be friends with Logan and now has a company with him
1 yr ago: me and logan will never be friends  1 yr later: create prime together and become good friends
"Why me and Logan will never be friends." ...And now they have Prime together
Seing this now and jj saying me and logan will never be friends and he owns with logan now a drinking company prime, how the tables have turned
"why me and logan will never be friends" oh how the turn tables, good to see character development I guess :)
whos here after prime has launched and JJ and logan are best mates
If you can't be friends with someone you have fought in an organised fight, then you were never truly deeply connected to begin with. There was always a superiority complex battle going on in the first place, hence the fight just made that apparent and egos were hurt.
6:42 Oh how times have changed
He became friends w Logan tho didn’t he
"Why me and Logan will never be friends" - 2022 own a drink company together. I like how they overcame their problems for the better.
“Me and Logan will never be friends”
Me after he released prime with Logan: 🤣👀✌🏾🤣
Lol I love how he says he will never be friends with Logan but look at them now ahahah
he said he’d never be friends with logan, now they own a company together, life changes and he rolls with it jheez
Well in 2022 there is something called prime now so......

“Never be friends”
“Why me and Logan will never be friends”- Introducing Prime!
When ksi says him and logan will never be friends
'Me and Logan will never be friends' bruh
jj:i dont really look at numbers anymore also jj: always compares his monthly listeners to others
this didnt age well
“Me and Logan will never be friends” - Sure thing
"Why me and Logan will never  be friends..." okay jj
Hes such a nice guy
I came to hear him say "pop pop/quikmafs" and was immediately disappointed
"i can never be friends with logan" that didnt age well, today with a drink company together
anyone else here in 2022 where ksi and Logan Paul are now business partners "we could never be friends"
6:42 that aged well
Well… this aged well
Me and logan will never be friends...sure jj
Little did he know a year later he would be business partners with Logan Paul
@6:42 this aged well
So much for him and logan not being friends 😂
KSI: "Why me and Logan will never be friends..." 2022: *KSI and Logan Paul are best buds and also business partners*
6:43 this aged awfully.
“Me and Logan Paul will never be friends” one year later they launch a drink company
he lied he said he will never be friends with logan paul but there are now friends nd also started their prime drink business together
JJ: "Me and Logan will never be friends" *1 year and 2 months later* Logan and JJ: "We are business partners"
Who’s here after jj and Logan Paul partnership
“I will never be friends with Logan” says the guy who just made a sports drink with him😂😂😂😂
How times have changed
6:42 “me and Logan will never be friends”  - JJ
I'm sorry jj, but wtf are you doing? 0:40
Fun fact: logan and ksi are friends lmfao
“Me and logan will never be friends”
Lol a year later Logan and ksi are friends lol
The irony
nah jj u have amde all of use so so happy and now seeing you make vidose reddit on question go everything is the best thing ever STAY STRONG JJ!!!!
"I'll never be friends with Logan Paul" Yea right..
6:15 - He is slightly warped on that point. When you fight, you generally squash the beef and move on.
I think we can all get on board with Jake Paul being a twat
This is probably the quietest I've heard KSI speaking in a long long time 😂
KSI's old Fifa videos with his Dad and Mum were some of the funniest times on Youtube. The Hesky jokes were off the charts. Also the songs, Race to Division 1. Good times, good vibes. Happy for him!
This aged well, because Logan is good friends now 🥊🥊
Big up jj. Uk legend
Look at those lips holy shit wtf
Haha when he said Jake Pauls a twat….. I agree lol
for once JJ can be proved wrong He and Logan became friends
6:43... oh well
Whos that
lol “ me and Logan will never be friends” 10 months later their on a podcast together blowing eachother to the max 😂
Welp it looks like logan and ksi have turned things around
“Me and Logan will never be friends”
6:42 looool yeah anyways
That video of him getting jump scared was one of the funniest things i've ever seen! lol.
Me and Logan will never be friends. :/
Knowledge Strength Integrity 💪
fast forward to him now being friends with logan
When you watch THIS after the Marvin Herbert one and wonder why 🤦🏽‍♂️
6:41 ''me and logan will never be friends''      that aged well
Pro boxing match ?? PMSL that was funny.
Seems more genuine than the wannabe top boxers Paul brothers
Our fatneek
“me and logan will never be friends” well look how that turned out
*"you can never truly be friends after something like that, especially after winning"*  Well this aged well.
Our fatneek is a legend 👌
Now he is friends with Logan
As Nathan Barley said."I'm a self facilitating media node".
well… our fatneek is friends with logan now and we love to see it! 🙌
well… our fatneek is friends with logan now and we love to see it! 🙌
“I deleted loads of old videos and tweets to make myself happy”  Harry “deleting your old videos are you dumb, stop being so ashamed of where you came from. it’s the old KSI that made us all fans. This KSI is a fucking waste man”
WhY Me AnD LoGaN CaN NeVeR Be FrIeNdS This week's sidemen Sunday  FISHING WITH LOGAN PAUL
8 months later and this man is hanging out with Logan Paul 😂
“that’s why me and logan will never be friends” who else here after the fishing contest?
“I don’t think you can be friends after a fight” - spoken like someone who really, deep down, has no idea about boxing.
6:43 well this didnt age well. don't worry though, it was for the better
1:12 6:49 why 💀
Yeah, we can all see that education wasn't your primary focus
Who's here after the sidemen sunday with Logan Paul
This didn’t age well. He’s cool with Logan now since they collaborated twice in the span of two days
Greatest YouTuber of all time
l like ksi but fuck no should he be on this your story ain't hard times like the other people being interviewed lol get out of here
Annoying seeing this kid everywhere
Our Fatneek made us proud!
And thats what seperates 'boxers' from martial artists....
Who is this dude?
1:10 "ok so just stay there and stare at the wall while i record your face"
our fatneek, but he is amazing though.
Jesus loves you all!
1:12 what is that close up lol 😂
In the age of social media we would shamely call him an icon for what particular significance I would not know I mean compare him to those with stories of epic heroism or contributions to societies that we have seen on this channel!..."he makes youtube video"  erm,ok.
Thats Our Big Boy!!!!
damn my sire fatneek is actually humble and genuine man,damn:)
I've worked with this guy and he is genuinely a nice dude. I was expecting him to be way louder than he was, but he was the quiet one.
Good luck to the guy.. he's made his own path i life and not just through luck, but through determination,  he done it and I respect that shit!!... well done mate
Honestly, I cannot stand this guy's content and I find it obnoxiously loud and over the top in my personal opinion, but I like seeing things like this separation between the content and the much more humble, thoughtful creator behind it. Seems like a genuinely interesting, grounded person who's still surprised by his success and hasn't let it go to his head like others in his shoes, the prime examples being the massive twats, Logan and Jake Paul. They are their content; loud and obnoxious still, but thoughtless and absolutely detrimental to the behaviour and minds of the young people who follow them and see them as role models.   Still won't subscribe to his channel, but I think he's pretty alright.
I am seeing this waaaayy too late, but i realy want to comment on this video. I realy love to see the ‘non entertainer side’ of jj and to see more of who he is! He can be that loud and obnoxious persona who can be reallyyy hysterical, but this brings it back to earth. Great job u guys! (Hope i didn’t make it unreadeble xd i’m Dutch and English was always my weakest subject XD) for the one person who may read this, i hope you have/had a nice day X
That’s our Fat Neek
The goat
Who?
Who is he never heard of him
Money making brain, you can't fault him.. he is no noel Clark or Kevin spacey.
Now hes performing at wembley
Fatneeeeekkkk
Something I realised...JJ gives a great interview
Hearing JJ so calm and tranquil, is so weird, but it was so nice to hear him open up.
I dont know why i cry
The silly duck unexpectedly expect because cactus independently stuff within a deep bandana. taboo, crazy canoe
niga
@LADbible TV How about you change the top comment on the "How to survive a plane crash" video?
The melodic puppy indisputably vanish because error precisely overflow toward a apathetic segment. equable, sordid intestine
mic up the person asking questions!
JJ/KSI he is serious and down to earth on what he does, but he is amazing guy.  I don't know what happened between Joe Weller and him( not like it's any of my business) but the Paul's are just stuck in there own little world ,just now realized.
Very real interview 💪👌🙏💙 #noordinaryladybkb
Love JJ, been watching since the last 6 years ❤️❤️❤️
1:12 when the barber takes a video for his Instagram and you try not to laugh it look at him
the millennial generation are screwed up. our parents generations are very strange. I think Logan and KSI etc will be friends when they are older
Gotta love the fat neek
Something in my urethra
I've worked for this . I'm ready you're not ready to fight me. What a motivational word.
Looks like they pointed a gun at him 1:11
Who was missing jj’s laugh 😂
fat neek
we’re proud of you jj. from where you came from, to where you’re at now, all we can say as fans, is thank you for the greatest of memories growing up as a kid. forever the UK G.O.A.T of youtube, no debate.

10 minutes and 8 SECONDS
My G. <3
1:11 “yo can we get a random close up of JJ? Yeah mate just move the camera back and forth and make him say nuffink yeah yeah sick”
I just realized this video was released on november 9th. Precisely one year after the fight
some Americans don’t like ksi because of his beefs w/ American youtubers. but honestly as an American, him & the sidemen are my go to’s when i wanna laugh and enjoy watching youtube. i was a fan of logan & wassabi but the doesn’t mean i gotta hate jj.
Respect to jj
Honestly a top bloke
You may think hes just bragging about his accomplishments, but thats simply just because this man take NO L’s
https://youtu.be/XgecMhcQABc
Love ya jj always going to support you.
Seeing what our boi has done is so amazing man💯
What a guy 👊🏼
"i don't look at numbers no more" also jj "Lets check your monthly listeners"
I love the fact that he wears the chain that simon gave him as a gift in almost every interview..
Infectious laugh very likeable guy.
yeah we sometimes make fun of jj but we're so proud of how far he's come.
legend
aside from the memes jj is  a really genuine guy he deserves everything and is just a great inspiration for a lot of people including me
Ksi is just a LEGEND
It looks like hes holding back his laugh
You can’t hate JJ
He’s soo cute and humble I love him ❤️❤️ and I’m soo proud of everything he’s done big up my gg ksi
Bruv even my 50 year old dad loves his music
Proud of you JJ !!
this man is my inspiration lots of people say “only boys can watch the sidemen and ksi” but im a girl and i enjoy watching them. he’s inspired me to 1) keep going and 2) start editing. he doesnt edit but he helped me to do the things that i love and keep going and stay motivated.
this guy earned  everything he got
Ayo ik ksi isn't gonna see this but mans actually lookin like a pretty fitneek

1:14 me looking at my mirror after taking a big poo
Our Guy's FIT!!!
Ayy
Wait !! YouTube didn't existed when he was 11 , it was 2004 and YouTube started in 2005 .
Seeing what was hot and jumping on it. hmmmm
On screen hes just so funny, and in person hes so humble and so down to earth and such a nice person I dont understand how he gets hate.
E YO FATNEEK
♥️JJ
JJ: I don't even look at numbers anymore. Also JJ: Aight let's check your monthly listeners.
Love u jj
1:12 he is trying so hard not to laugh
i appreciate this dude so much
Can't take this guy serious
Jj you wanted to laugh so hard on the outro 😅😅
Anyone who thinks JJ is an egotistical prick should watch this. Hes one of the nicest and humble guys
KSI please react to Smile 2 Jannah and Ali Dawah's video!
Anyone who says Jake Paul's a tw*t is definitely a friend of mine, never liked KSI before this video, great to see an honest and humble guy. peace KSI.
He is happy with HIS songs
They should really interview JJ next
Fatneek is Unhateable.
Fatneek is a good human being
How is this not more popular?
disliking this video until JJ gets hyper
Our boy jj
Fatneek out here acting like a sentimental man now, reddit get him
“you can never be true friends with someone you fought”  i swear him and Simon became best friends because they had a fight 😂😂😂😂
KSI - GET HYPER... i miss these days tho
Mans a legend❤
I mean deji is an interesting one just hear me out after jake beat him he went kind of on the down low but if he won he could of got 10 mil really fast but he didn’t. I have been watching the press conferences and stuff and that’s how I got hear because deji is the smallest YouTube compared to Logan, JJ and jake so really if you think about it he has more to loose than the rest of them.
The mushy mustard cumulatively contain because apartment evolutionarily protect before a even excellent excited digger. military, shut curler
how does he make my day ..his laughter his vid makes me say in 24 hrs. ooh so that's why ? then comes the laughter :D
Look at JJ man, so inspirational
This fat neek is the GOAT. His stupid videos have been entertaining me for as long as he’s been making them. Mad love for JJ.
Never knew this gentleman until now but he has his head screwed on for sure. I agree with him about Logan. Good luck with your future KSI!
He forgot about there best moment of his life, him and pewds musical instrument flex fight.
Bald when?
Legend
Wait KSI started with uploading Family Guy xD
This might be the best ksi interview
Your not a pro boxer lad lol it was a publicity stunt for money. You were at your best when doing fifa videos with your dad and bro, since then your annoying and everywere. To much of something is a bad thing.
"it's crazy what hard work can get you"  - KSI
Cant wait to see him smash jake paul 🥊🥊
One word, for one man, to one man. King.
KSI on interview: I don't look at numbers. KSI on video: Alright lets look at your monthly listeners!!! What's your pro boxing record looking like?
Lovely mates there "it's crazy where your at bow, I never thought you'd get there... Yaknow because I thought you was a loser"
if JJs parents weren't strict then JJ would of applied for a real job then ksi wouldn't be at his place today as he said
The vid should be called: "what KSI is 100% about."
Goes on to make 100 "among us" and "reaction" videos...
He got fame and it went over his head. He lost me there
I am a KSI fan, I am also a sidemen fan but yo KSI can't box and he defo can't spit bars
Yea but his music sucks
The rampant drill expectably serve because orchestra ultrasonographically grin per a unknown trial. accessible, well-off sandra
This is the interview that Starzio used for the movie
A persons successes or failures always begins with the parents.  Parents don’t realise how much they influence their children lives
ksi is really an inspiration, he went from being a nerdy kid who no one liked to the uk’s biggest youtuber
Hehe
Tuck those lips in boi you don't want to get them caught on a trip wire.
“If my parents let me do my own thing I probably would’ve stayed in education however they were strict so I did the opposite. I’ve always been the person to do the opposite of what someone tells me!” AS AN AFRICAN CHILD I CAN 100% RELATE😭😭
Loves him playing fifa 😂
K-Kiwi S-Short I-Introvert
What accent is that? Not British.
Why's he not screaming
HOLY F$UCK why are there SO many ads on your videos its ridiculous.
Who's here after the ksi movie?
He smacked the shit out of jake and Logan
Can you do one with a nat geo photographer and their careers? I’d be glad listening to them
We love you fat neek ❤️
Always blows my mind to see how far he has come man and the shit he has accomplished 🐐
there is not a video where JJ does not laugh
i made ksi poppin into a drill song
this guy is the biggest bounty. does nothing for black people apart from mock them.
Absolute legend, he's grinded for everything he has today and I'm happy to have been there from the start 🤙
I fuckin love that guy man. Honestly he’s prolly the biggest role model I’ve ever had.
bro wdym u lost the fight
You ask kids from the UK 10 years ago who they watched on YouTube, they’d say KSI. You ask kids now from the UK who they watch on YouTube, they’d say KSI. Mans stayed relevant for so long now
Fair play for his YouTube success, abysmal music though.
Who his him? Never heard of him
He said he gave his first channel to his bro?! And his bro still has less subs than him lol
So him and Joe can never become friends again, fair enough. But I'm wondering how him and Harry patched their friendship after those uncalled for diss tracks.
He deserve it all
It's actually 10 minutes and 8 seconds.
Do pewdiepie next
Bruh we got scammed it’s 10min and 8sec bruh
All we see is the loud KSI, sometimes rude and chaotic KSI, but when we get to see the down to earth, humble ksi.....it’s just the best!
Bro he will beat jake pauls ass
1:11 why does this feel so awkward
2:04 silent voice crack
You should interview Babatunde he's more talented than this guy
Of course you can be friends with someone you’ve beaten. You beat him at boxing, he can beat you in something else whether its sports related or not, and you can still beat him as well, it does not matter. Friendship goes beyond anything of that sort.
KSI "JJ" is an amazing person
Punching people in the face and letting them enjoy that KNOWLEDGE STRENGTH INTEGRITY 💪
What I love about this vid is that you see the real JJ for once and not the JJ we see on YouTube.
he look like hes out of a jail
1:12 WTF?
KSI be lookin’ buff💪🏾
Finally
Amazing Work 👍
Nobody really talks about how much he has actually done for Youtube and the world
Amazing camera quality well produced as well
Ksi didn’t beat Logan Paul second time, Logan won on the scorecards but the ref docked Logan 2 points for some reason and that allowed Ksi to get the win
Got to give credit to KSI he has come so far and deserves all da success he’s a top YouTuber who can do so many things that are entertaining including his music 💯💯
very u neek FINALLY A LAUGH: 8:41
sadly no matter how much music he makes or how many fights he does, he will always been seen as a youtuber.
Normally with a rapper you only see their good side, but with JJ we get to see both sides ❤️
He's fast becoming a national treasure. Got to admire him.
Hes the UK Version of Logan Paul. Famous because of YouTube yet limited because of it.
I love jj ksi ❤️
“I’m not a person that was born with all these skills I have just worked hard, it’s crazy what hard work can get you” 👊 followed Jj since I was a a little kid now I’m in my twenties and watching this man grow has been so inspirational I wish nothing but success to him and anyone reading this comment just go out set goals and smash your dreams ❤️
Our fat neek
look at our fat neek being all humble
Calling someone a twat is very typical British word for insulting someone hahahaha 😂 that chuckled me more then it probably should of lol 😂 😂 😂
Does anyone know what that opening music is called?
Holysh i played dune 2000 a shitload mate:) love that game
KSI is just one of those guys you always wanna be with and someone we all want to be in one way or another
Take a look at this JJ Olatunji ripoff
Ksi: i don’t like to look at numbers.  Someone talks shit to him Ksi: let’s check your monthly listeners fam!
*So.....not even Deji can comment on his brothers vid?*
I’m a simple man      I see jj I click it
Motivation.
From FIFA videos to this... Haven't enjoyed watching anybody's journey more than KSI's. Representing the UK appropriately. 👏
Ok honest opinion here, pls dont hate me...but I think the "you cant be friends with someone who has beaten u" is an immature take. I understand that feeling, but if you both push away your egos it's actually really cool that you get to be friend with someone you never though you could be, idk just a cool feeling.
Jj “ I don’t look at numbers anymore”  Also Jj “ Alri let’s see how many monthly listeners he has”
Crew: “you obviously had beef with both Joe Weller and Logan Paul... and Logan’s brother...”   JJ: *smirking internally* Jake Paul: “did that British guy just say that to CSI?”
it's our fatnick ❤️❤️
ALL HAIL KING BABATUNDE
Wow that's crazy bro But who asked?
sub to our boy ksi
UwU
We need KSI documentary! It would be awesome for sure!!
Legend
Fat neek made it
His mindset is truly inspiring... If he wants it he gets it. Jj is a real guy and if you think like him your going to get far...
Why tf have ladbible put 'neek' in the tags?
4:51 Best motivational quote you´ll ever get.  "I´ve worked for this. I´m ready."
he opened up the doors guys mad respect
He singlehandedly runs the Uk YouTube scene. Will be remembered long after he’s gone
Sad that he gets such a bad rep, he’s genuinely a good guy.. I hope he continues to climb high an high in his career
Man's kinda buff u know
Rapper MO3 shot dead 😢😢 https://youtu.be/vVdgHvrgh1w
Fuckin King
Can u punch some people to make me happy
His voice lowkey sounds dead.
Who knows if ksi is sparring for Jake rn
KSI: I was unhappy hopping on trends all the time   Also KSI: uploads among us videos
Idk why, but i get goosebumps when he talks ina calm voice and open up about himself.
Sidemen Niko chunks filly carry the uk
Our fat neek has really grown up 😭
Babatude was the turning point for him.
Our favorite lovable fat neek
I guess the dislikes are from 9 year olds from jake pool
JJ: 8:24 Also JJ: *Let's check his Spotify listeners shall we*
Ksi:I was very quiet and still am Everyone that watches his vids: CAP
This man is an absolute legend I’m so happy for him.
I've never heard jj sound so smart before lmao
01:11 wtf was that 😂
HARDWORK!!
One day YUNG JEONG will be the biggest artist in the music industry...manifest 💯🥶💫
Ksi was one of the first youtubers I watch when I growed up  I was  11 when I watched him I'm 19 in 2 weeks so a long time I watched him and the sidemen
always will be so so so proud of him
not quite how to be behzinga
He is a really nice...genuine guy.
Ayrton Senna
maybe we make fun of him and bully him but we are proud of him
This video is so god damn boring
When he laughs I wait for it get louder but then he cuts it short, mans gotta stay composed lol
Actually it’s 10:08 not 10:00 straight
This is my 🐐 on Youtube! I have been a fan of him since the early start of his YouTube career and I am SO proud of JJ man. He is such an inspiration to me and is that little bit of my day that makes me forget about depression.   You deserve everything you have got!  I love you JJ
I thought this was gonna the first video where JJ doesnt laugh
What I like about KSI is he gives no BS
JJ: i gave Deji my old YouTube account and made a new one  Deji: he tried to ruin me
DONT USED THE LORDS NAME IN VAIN
Yup... he was the quite kid
Big up KSI 💯
*this was released before the KSI movie*
KSI on Youtube: 🤪🍆🍑 KSI on Reddit: 🥶💩💩 KSI in Interviews: 😏😎😊
I love this guy!!!!!!!
1:11 he wants to laugh so bad😂
I like JJ but this man can't go a few words without "ERRRRR" EURRRRRRMMM " ERRRRRRR...........
Stop posting positive shit about KSI       I cant like them all
I don't agree with what he said about being friends after beating someone.. half the fighters in the UFC respect and befriend some of their opponents, and learn a thing or 2.
Sidemen - Beta Squad - Pewdiepie  Greatest content creators on YouTube.
Dont believe he was a quiet kid
Jj - "I don't even look at numbers anymore" Also Jj - "let's check their monthly listeners!"👀😂
Ok jj don’t snort cocaine
to people who don't know JJ, they must think hes capping when he said he had a pro boxing match in staples center, and that he made a song with rick ross and lil-baby and stuff like that
Aww Look at Our Fat Neek
1:12 Wtf is that close up shoot?
00:13 *Among us video uploaded 2 hours ago*
jj is the only rich guy im not jealous of
Good man ksi 👌
Loved the Ads, video was okay too.
I got 5 ads in one vid wtf
People with loud voices sound weird when they talk quiet
Love to see our fat nick opening up😂😂
One day I'll collab with JJ
Nerd at heart yes respect from this boomer
His first video where my volume is at 100%
Ever heard of a vop?? It vacuums, it mops it’s a a VOP
Lets be real, most of these interviewers ask the same questions
We need one of these interviews with Ethan Payne, Behzinga. Both him and KSI are very inspirational people🙏
In interviews ksi has a complete different laugh, its like he acquired a evil villain laugh lol.
Stop calling it a PRO boxing fight, it was an AMETUER boxing fight. YOU and LOGAN ARE NOT PROFESSIONALS JUST BECAUSE YOU GO IN A RING
Can someone please tell me where that violin piece in the intro is from?
So much means
🐐
This comment will get 6.9k likes for no reason
This guy looks the most familiar of anyone you've had
His laughs always gets me
JJ is a big inspiration 🙌🤜
Hi there, I only needed to say that i really liked your content, congratulations!  I have subscribed to your C h a n n e l 😉 Maybe, You can do the same and we will become "real" Youtube friends
He is introvert huh? Bullshiiieeet
is it me or is JJ's skin a bit green?
“I don’t look at numbers anymore”  The Reddit is gonna get you
KSI what a genius!
People say JJ and the Sidemen carry the UK YouTube scene but from my perspective, they carry the YouTube scene, period.
proud of him
9:31 - "I'm not a person that was just born with all these skills. I've just worked hard and you know, it's crazy where hard work can get you"  He's a Cristiano Ronaldo of YouTube😁 In all seriousness though - such a strong message :)
Ksi: I dont look at numbers  Also Ksi in every video: How many  monthly listeners do you have
"I don't even look at numbers anymore"   *Also JJ*  "What's your monthly listeners?"
🐐
It's hard to not laugh because he made our year, his humor and music.
hello reddit
ksi is the genuine one and jj is the mad one😭
JJ: I don't care about stats  Also JJ: how many monthly listener's?
We out here for you bud
Why have ten minutes with Ksi whenyou can watch his Reddit videos
❤️🤩
No one: The producers at 1:12: Get a random shot of your face and do this: 👁👄👁
i love this man so much
NDL
Aye my boy looks good here he doesn’t look like a fat neek
Why does he look like he just got out of prison
“Don't always make it about you. Don't be selfish. Don't just have yes men around you, have people that will tell you how it is and be real with you 100% of the time.”  -Fat Neek 👑
he is so strong for being black when it wasnt his choice he is so inspirational
He is a GOAT. Really proud of him. He has accomplished a lot. Respect.
Wooooow they put 5 ads in the video talk about being money hungry
Saying that he "open up" on his family is a bit clickbait
This guy looks promising. He should probably start a rapping career in the future
I like what he said, just because you're not born with it, doesn't mean you can't achieve it. Thanks JJ, that spoke volumes, Hard work sure pays off. Keep grinding man and I like your hair like that and not the wriggling red chotos 😂
I got this many millions..... subscribers
6:35 I mean.. its his opinion. I don't believe everyone is like that.
Dis guy has guts to call jake a twat openly
4:20 it’s every day bro
I hope he even exceeds more and doesn't fall, because when he falls...trust me this will be a very painfull one
As much as he plays the wanker in the sidemen  sometimes, he is so down to earth and genuine
I was under the impression that Joe and JJ had made amends? I guess they're not "friends" though still which is a shame as they're both sound lads.
“I dont look at numbers” Mr montly listeners
Jj said he and can't be friends. They will become friends they follow each other on twitter.  Jj thinks he cant be friends with weller and Logan it will take time and they will forget what happened in the past then it will be ok
jj: “I dont look at numbers”   Also jj: “lets look at your monthly listeners”  But ay repect man 🤙🏼✌🏿
I think this is dope, shows his true character and motivates others to work hard for their dream! Truly inspiring! Man
YouTube's biggest Legend
Lil bored and flying kitty Entered
It’s mad how this guy grown up I watched this guy since god knows😂 I was like his 690 subscriber. Keep up the good work bro @ksi
The thing is all mainstream ask the same questions ‘did you ever thing you/this would be so big’ about the boxing, his YouTube etc and it’s an obvious no
Your videos got me thru a lot my man, thanks for lighting up the world with your humour 💯

Who’s this ksi olajidebt guy?
He is the youtube GOAT..idc what you say ...
I saw the views and i was like only 400k? Thats so low, lets see how many unilad usually gets....channel views in 1000's ohh......ok.....
He can’t believe he has a song with Craig David and Rick Ross but what about Offset? 😂
love KSI🤗🤗🤗🤗😘😘😍💓💓💜💜💛💛💚💙
jj: "i don't focus on the numbers anymore"  Also jj:      *ok let's compare our monthly listeners*
Seeing Jj lit  🔥 I’m glad he’s been doing good lately
We all know why the interviews are 10mins.   PS. YouTube are getting real cheeky with them double ads.
It was not a pro boxing match u utter tosser
Dunno why but the gap in his teeth is nostalgic of the old ksi and reminds me this is still the same guy.
yo jj is a G, he is the best and deserves all the success and happiness he has now
Is my man trying to sound like Dutchavelli?
Blokes a tosser
8:25           "Let's check your monthly listeners."
why did this come out right before starzio releasing the movie
Hy, ngl he kinda looks like JJ's twin
seeing jj get the recognition he deserves is so inspiring
I thought it was jj
U forgot trippy 🤣 Ps it’s a joke.

This just gave me motivation’!!
Biggest UK legend and most humble in the YouTube scene
KSI IS A GREAT YOUTUBER ! ! !WHO AGREE?
OUR FATNEEK❤️❤️
"I don't even look at numbers anymore" Not too long ago: "let's check your monthly listeners"
What a humble human i luv ksi
Legend
As useful as an ashtray in 2020
JJ: I don’t really look at numbers anymore  Also JJ: let’s take a look at your monthly listeners
JJ: I don’t really look at numbers anymore  Also JJ: Let’s take a look at your monthly listeners
Bro you’re such an inspiration! I do karate and want to eventually do amateur boxing when this whole pandemic is over. I am also currently getting into the music scene. I want to thrive with hard work just like you man! I promise one day I’ll make a collab with you my guy!   Ima screenshot this to show you in the future
Is it just me or is JJ getting asked the same questions over and over again?
Fat Neek
JJ is a fucking G! An inspiration to many of us out there! Been a fan since the FIFA days!
JJ really speaking at a normal volume. his voice not moving mad
Yo he actually looks pretty fit...
Couldn't be any prouder for our Fat Neek
Sometimes I genuinely forget that JJ is an introvert who came out of his shell
Its not 10 minutes it's 10:07 😡
I love KSI man he makes us all happy
5:45 is the jake paul segment
we love our fatneak
X
Ksi in 10 millions subscribers
I’m not a fan of either KSI or Logan but Logan definitely won the 2nd fight and was robbed
its yo boi ksiolajidebt
One day this will come to an end, Scary
Lovely guy, deserves all his success and more. xx
Please re-record yourself when you ask them questions because it's really annoying that the voice asking the question sounds so soft and it's hard to hear. I know that there's subtitles but that's not enough for people with eyes/sight complications 🙇🏻‍♂️ thank you, love the videos
Jake Paul's gonna flatten this geezer.. he better get training.
The fact that the Reddit bullies him, other than that he's genuinely humble as a person, everyone liked that.
.
Man, KSI man, truly truly really such an inspiration. Look what he's doing in life he's an absolute legend. His mindset hardwork personality and overall humbleness just everything about him is legendary!! Hes not like any other successful person. Bieng a youtuber you can really see his personality. You can joke with him. Interact with him, more connected then any other mainstream famous person. And I like that the most that I feel closer to the person I idol. Love you KSI❤️
One of the greatest youtubers!!!! He deserve everything he had
Jesus is coming very soon, repent, accept Jesus as your personal lord and saviour. Follow Christ today, you don’t want to be left behind!. God bless everyone🙏🏾❤️
Jj can easily be friends with Joe lmao, he just doesn’t want to
1:10, 6:47 lool the way they just interject with these random zoom in angles
I followed KSI since his fight with Joe Weller. I liked his content and his comedy. Saw he was fighing Logan Paul. He drew. He faught again and won. To see him go from Youtuber to mainstream makes me happy. He is Professional fighter. A rapper. A youtuber. And a down to Earth person. I've never met him or spoke to him but I would. He acts like an idiot on Camera but In person Id say he's a chill person. There is alot of kindness and heart in him.
We just want to see the man play fifa, leave him alone
Why does he look like JJ olatunji?
I dont care what anybody says, KSI is as humble as they come. What an inspiration, a man of his word and hes also got a brilliant mindset for anything that comes his way.
i just love him
8:24 ALRIGHT TIME TO CHECK YOUR MONTHLY LISTENERS
Sup
Dune 2000 was the shit! :D
Ksi hater check
1:11 what is this shot lmao
"From the United Kingdom!"  💪 💪 💪
never heard of this dude but in spanish his name means ok yes.
Ayooo that's out fatneek!!!!
Nah. KSI has acheived a lot in his life but I am the most jealous that he seen Jay Z and Yeezy performing watch the throne.
Ksi he a real genuine guy
imagine him and Deji collabing again, damn the memories
Can’t wait to see all the boomer replies asking who he is
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_szpr18X3KU
people who dislike ksi are the people who are just fails in life
THEY PUT 'NEEK' AS A TAG FOR THIS VIDEO (Thats just peak bro) 😂
ngl but JJ has huge biceps in this vid (don't know if I wrote that correctly
Watch more videos from the 'Minutes With...' series ➤ https://bit.ly/3kckORZ Watch 'The Gap' playlist ➤ https://bit.ly/2IldmHd
instead of deleting he should have just moved the "stuff" he doesnt like to his second channel... and then watch it pass his main channel because people watch him for the stupid things not the "music"
Ksi is impossible to dislike such a genuine down to earth bloke completely!
10 minutes???      10 minutes and 8 seconds
“Maybe I treated you too harshly”
JJ: I always do the opposite of what someone tells me  Someone: JJ don’t kill yourself
I’m so happy for him. He really deserve what he has right now.
Ksi: I want to do things that make me happy   Also JJ: makes reddit videos and gets mocked by his own fans😂😂😂   We still love him though🙌🏾
People who disliked are Jake Paul fans
https://open.spotify.com/album/03csHeZJA0TRfiDINBoVa6
He's lying!!!!!! He was 11 in 2004 and the first YouTube upload was in or '05 how the fuck did he upload back then??!!
JJ: I don't look an numbers... Also JJ: Aight let's check his monthly listeners 🤣🤣
Shout out to the northern Irish interviewer! Yeooo
3:45 KSI: i didnt worry about numbers Also KSI: LETS CHECK YOUR MONTHLY LISTENERS
All these good  comments about KSI...        I have to like all of em.
You already know that the people that disliked this video are jake paul fans
We are proud of our fat neek
KSI: I don't even look at numbers anymore  Also KSI: ayo lets check your monthly listeners
Lets just say it....HE IS THE BEST YOUTUBER💜💯
1:53 names his second channel while the channel he’s talking about is KSI😂😂
if he does not scream during his vids, his voice would be therapeutic like his voice now. like an English version of corpse with a bit of high pitch added
Why he so serious
JJ should Collab with him
RIP Joe Weller 😂
What a prick
It's so great to see how well he's done for himself. From watching the race to division 1 vids, to where he is now. Well done! 👏👏
Who’s dis mans
YouTube getting cocky with the unskippable ads
KSI is just a fucking legend man
Ksi: I don’t look even look at numbers  Also ksi: let’s check his monthly listeners
Woah ma boiii made it to LADBible #UniLad very happy for you jide  Idk but I felt it you worked so hard helped many who doesn’t know yet what you did for them  all the very best of luck for upcoming albums #KingTheNightmareKSI
Acting
JJ: I don’t really look at stats also JJ when someone talks shit , LeTs CheCk HiS mOnTHly LiSteNers!
It said ‘Side memo’ on the subtitles when he says sidemen 🤣
'I was just not happy" *laughs continuously*
Boxing   Audience lol . U fought the same guy twice . 2 point lost . No knock out . How could u can’t a real boxing audience. If u had 50 fights then ya u will have a boxing audience but yours here to end u tube boxing while Jake love the game of boxing . Look at the boxing world . All those who love the game of boxing made it . And people that don’t give a fuck and only here to end u tube boxing didn’t make nothing .
As fans we bully this man in every way possible but as soon as he has beef or someone trys to harm him, he has the most loyal fans on the platform, we always got your back you fat neek
"I've always been someone to dk the opposite of what people tell me to"   "Don't eat my asshole"
This was sooooo honest I love it!
Also why is everyone saying the KSI weller fight was in 2017 it was February 2018 LOOOOOOL
KSI is better than the paul brothers in every way
175 dislikes.. they must’ve lost in a boxing fight
Wow, crazy to Think he was such an introvert, that kinda motivates me cause Im very fucking introverted
Class act! I remember being in the first 500 subs back in the day and not even considering the numbers.. few years later and the growth was incredible! Just wish I had taken him up on the football video offer.. could be on more than 55 subs right now lol
The new song with Craig David is KSi's peak in my opinion
How many adverts do you want in one video?!
What a guy
When he said I traveled and came back in a better fo- all I thought about was goku 😂
Learnt abit about ksi td in English just shows how big he is
10 minutes and 8 seconds actually.!
you won’t regret it 🔥https://youtu.be/zUXSCxu4ch0
Other thing is he can take a millions of people bullying and still having a happy face travis couldnt even take so much of the bullying he deactivated inta lol
Its crazy how alot of these singers left youtube to do music respect for jj for not leaving youtube and doing music and hes humble respect man 15,000 respect gained
This is the most calm I’ve seen JJ in a while
Started watching JJ back when he was doing Fifa Funnies videos. Great respect for what he built, and the loyalty he has with his friends.
This guy is such a legend , I really love him and his videos, he is always making me laugh even though I’m having a bad day! Thank you sooo much man for changing my day from bad to good
https://youtu.be/s6617YCInME
#1 motivator
🐐
1:10 so you a maverick 😮
AYE WHO CAME FROM HIS STORY
Wow ksi shining
Who came here from his story on instagram ?
Had to get the 1000 comment
This man can smile through anything  thats why he is a legend
It's unreal what he has achieved! Iv got nothing but admiration for the guy. Big respect KSI keep it rolling brother👊
1:12 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I remember fifa and Q&A Ksi it’s so crazy how far he’s come and how long we’ve all been watching him grow couldn’t be more prouder!
KSI amoung the sidemen is dubbed the dumb one but all jokes aside for him to step away from the internet take some time for his own mentall well being and do what makes him happy takes alot of maturity. Guy's inspirational
Look at ksi man such an inspiration
🐐
Title should be: life being a fat neek
This KSI guy is cool remembers me a lot of a guy named JJ Olatunji.
Unpopular opinion but ksi is overrated
the most dead question is "did you ever think you would be as successful as you have become"... and you asked it twice in 5 minutes.
Nice interview from our fat neek 🔥
Dune 2000! Cracking game. I'm old enough to have played Dune 2 - of which Dune 2000 is a remake. Super basic game (you can only select 1 unit at a time) but still good, very old school.
JJ......LAUGHED........AT........AN........ACCEPTABLE........VOLUME.......OH...MY......GOD.....
1:12 that is memeable
Its weird that Logan and KSI have very similar ambitions but different methods. They have similar personalities too.
JJ and Ethan josh are probably the 3 that has changed from the start Ethan doc josh growing KSI being him
Lol who is this guy? He's kinda fat
i couldn't take this seriously. i laughed at every clip of this video. God help me.
YouTube fucking getting too comfortable with this multiple addvertisement.
JJ: "i don't look at numbers"  Also JJ: "Let's check your monthly listeners fam"
The only person in the world who loves his fan base even getting roasted and taking it like a champ❤️
👊👊 inspirational g
10 mins from ksi more like 10 mins from ads LMAO!
One of the biggest inspirations of our generation, leave a like on the video for our fatneek
damn if this didnt pop up in my recommendations i wouldnt have found this after weeks
"You're actin bare suss bro, you're acting bare suss!" - JJ a few minutes before Simon kills him.
'opens up' figuratively and literally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x7nIRRn3Jw lol jake paul wants to fight conor mcgregor
He dosent look at any numbers besides monthly listeners 🔥🤙🏽😂
Crew: "So why does miniminter sleep in your bed and are you engaged to him?" JJ: 1:11
It felt like he was close to crying But ik just used to hear him talking loud in videos
JJ: 8:24 "I dont even look at numbers anymore"   Also JJ: "Lets check his monthly listeners".
1:17 is going to be clipped for a meme lmao.
I still get annoyed when I see Olajide called 'KSI'. KSI is the name of the halo clan he was a part of, his gamer tag was 'KSIOajideBT'
look at that fat neek being sentimental and all. I will speak for all of us who has been there since the get hyper in kfc stage , that we love you and appreciate all you have done for us. we will always support you my g. <3
It's honestly mad to see how far jj has come we might make fun of him and make jokes but in all seriousness we would never have expected him to come this far and be in the position he is in today we love you JJ
A JJ video I don't need to keep on adjusting volume
JJ sold out in 2017 2:48
The accent😇
JJ has always been a person i look up to, he really deserves more credit 🙌🏾
iAm KiNdA iNtRoVeRtEd      Also screams the life out of his soul every time you see him.
Some one clip these for reddit 6:47 🤣 idk I find em hilarious and I think they would fit so well with memes
10 min and 8 seconds **
1:10 fam the exact same with me smh, dont like them to mix into all the stuff i do
Aye that's our fat neek
Alctually nice listening to him not having to turn my volume down once in a while.
KSI makes me laugh
The interviewer probably tell him not to laugh or scream.....lmao
What a man. Props to you JJ. I’ve seen you grow and i feel like I’ve grown with you
Ksi is talking like a wise man. This is one of the videos we should all be proud off.
We love you KSI
even if jj loses to jake paul , my love for him will be the same
who else waited for "hey whatsup its ye boy ksiolajidebt!"
r/ksi here only   |   |   |  \/
What a man ✨✨
KSI has worked smart here.
He may be a bit fat and can't do maths but we still love him
1:20 That ting in his hair is triggering me
This is not 10 minutes it's 10 minutes and 8 SECONDS how rude if u to click bait 😂
JJ: I don't care about numbers also JJ: lets check their monthly listeners
Dam JJ’s vocabulary was on a level in this interview compared to his videos 😂
1:11 this man trying so hard not to laugh
We can take fousey and slim as an example after fight they became more close than before.
*Queue the reaction videos*
Hey its our fat neek
ksi : money be dripping like water  me : homeworks be dripping like hellll

Ksi is a legend. No cap
“He forgot S-X”

Doesn’t look at numbers anymore? Lol lets check his ...
Even after the fights, I'm pretty sure Logan and KSI could be friends
That's why we love JJ
We proud of u jj.
‘I want to be fluid in everything I do.’ Me: Do a year 12 exam
He's cool he should become a Youtuber
So glad I grew up watching this legend
0:54 finally.  hence proved, he can't go a single minute without that laugh.
this is a weird ksi video.
I been watching this dude since 2012, and this dude continues to makes great content that can make me laugh.
We should respect what this man has done for us. He wastes his time to make entertainment for us. Huge respect for this man
Big up jj🔥🔥
boys JJ is in Lad Bible oh my god
Our Fatneek..❤️❤️❤️❤️
ksi is like one of the only successful ppl im not jealous or envious of for some reason... maybe it’s because he’s changed throughout his life and hasn’t always been such a “go getter” or a “maverick” from the start.
Nc clickbait thought it was JJ OLATUNJI
Nothing i love more than our fat neek doing big tings
He forgot "Hey guys it's ya boi KSIOlajideBt"
Love Ksi ,top man
Lad bible gonna have a heart attack when they see the ksi fan base numbers coming in on this deffo gonna be there most viewed video 😂

JJ is so proud of himself for not having a *voice crAck* this video  Edit: *well nEverminD*
I think he should do a song with dababy or Lil Uzi Vert
Is this the same channel that interviewed Ksi’s friend Ringside?
Guess he hasn't been to Thailand
Lots of respect to our fatneek
African parents is strict about education KSI: Can’t spell apologies and pronounce mural

Watching his content makes me wanna start a youtube channel your awsome fam

🤍🤍🙌🏽
The dislikes are Jake Paul's fan's...
Although KSI is so amazing and he has done many things that he could be proud of, his humble character just makes him a million times better.  Thats why we love KSI!!! #baldski
He only made 120k from his debut album he does music more for the passion
Jj is the most humble person, so happy for. Him ❤️❤️
HE IS STRAIGHT UP GOAT, THE BEST EVER.
8:24 "Let's check their monthly listeners"
Aye JJ. My day 1 inspiration, 😟😰
Ay are fat neek is a champ gg jj
U can tell that JJ dosent show off like he is a 20mil sub celebrity..he treats everyone like a normal guy..and being a normal guy thats why people loves him cuz people gets arrogant after being this popular..wish i was in Uk..its my dream to meet him and the sidemen
Throughout this video...I remembered the first time I ever clicked on a ksi video..and it hit me hard... I've been following him since i was in my mid teens.. he's truly an inspiration man! One day I'll meet him and tell him i love him🙏❤️much respect
Look at fatneek here🔥🔥🔥 you always the great jj

“I didn’t think I’d ever have a son with craig David, I didn’t think I’d ever have a son with Rick Ross” yea neither did we jj, we only knew about the one with simon
Shoutout to our own Fatneek 😂😂❤
jj moves a lot, lowkey got a headache now lmao
Ain't that jj olatunji? Who's this ksi Donny!?
Thought I saw jj olatunji and clicked, was surprised to see the KSI
Ok
These youtubers change with the video setup. He isn't a nice person the video format is just very played down its the theme of unilad that makes ksi bareable  too.
Our fat neek 💯🖤
Look at Jide man, so inspirational.
Clickbait about opening up about family, prove me wrong
He's come a long long way and we are super proud of him. Almost feels like he's a brother of mine ❤️ Cheers my g, you're a legend.
I thought this was KSI, turned out to be JJ Olatunji.
JJ is never afraid or never minds to say what he feels and I respect him for that
This KSI guy looks a lot like that JJ Olatunji Youtuber
Everyone: complimenting JJ Real fans of JJ: What a Fatneek anyways props to him
Still wearing Simons chain 🥰
John 3:16 (For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.) The word believeth is highlighted because that's all you need to be saved, there is no other way, than to believe that Jesus came to this world to die for our sins and rose up again (Never to die again.). In Romans 10:9 (That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.) meaning all you have to do is believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, confession is made as a proof that you believe. Don't let anyone bamboozle you into thinking that there is a special way or steps into becoming a christian the only thing to do is just to believe that's all. Believe today and you will never regret it.  In Romans 6:23 (For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.) this is trying to say that once you become a christian you automatically get eternal life(making heaven) as a gift. Hell is real. But it's not the fear of hell that gets people saved. It's the gospel(believing that Jesus came to die for our sins and rose up on the third day). Fear will but produce false converts. If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” - Romans 10:9-11(NIV). There are so many benefits that come with being a christian why don't you believe in God today and see him manifest a lot of wonders in your life. Jesus is coming back again so be prepared.  The demonstration of his love remains unchanged. God loves you. I’d never doubt it. Praise God.
You gotta Respect JJ for his Hustle 👑
LMAO his face in the close ups 😂😂😂
The Reddit is making notes.
But he forgot to say “it’s been your boy ksiolajideBT”
He's the 🐐, always has been, always will be.🐐
8:30 oh let’s check your monthly listeners then
KSI: "I don't look at numbers anymore" Also KSI: "Let's check his monthly listeners"
I REALLY like how he didn't want to call his state of mind at that time a depression.  Because I feel like a lot of people use that term too loosely, while not realizing what an actual depression really is. Just being unhappy for a while doesn't mean you're depressed most of the time. An actual depression is like a life long curse, a dark cloud, you carry with you. You can learn to live with it, you can take medication and go to therapy, but the depression will always be with you and you have to work hard to keep it at bay. An actual depression is something non-depressed people struggle to understand.
Wow. Very genuine video!! Good luck, KSI
Seems like a good bloke, he have his own YouTube channel
Quoting ksi " I am the king of the drama cream of the crop I'm the new age farmer Poppin man I don't stop it man I do all this shit with no karma "
Yellow trousers ??
Why does he look like he’s a criminal that escaped
Our FatNeek always doing us proud <3
Never in my life I have seen a guy with such a loyal fan base. Pure love
A big part of that hard work that he doesn't get enough credit for, is his willingness to really put himself out there - and absorb all the shame and ridicule that comes with it.  I find it interesting that the second biggest Sidemen is Harry, who is another guy that's quite capable (albeit to a lesser extent) of putting himself out there warts n all. The rest of the Sidemen are quite insulated by comparison, and it shows when you compare their body of work. All seven of them work extremely hard, but KSI's ability to face down ridicule and criticism is a major X Factor that separates him from his peers.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Love u bro
🐐
JJ is sitting on top of the mountain because of his pure hard work and determination. Nobody can take that away from him. When it comes to GOAT of YouTube, he is definitely in the mix. This man raised the bar for the whole YouTube community multiple times. Absolute legend. We are so proud and happy for you JJ. Now back to reddit my G!
6:49 what’s the point of these random shots where jj’s just like 🗿
His voice kept on cracking at a low voice
The people who disliked this are Jake Paulers
im proud to be part of this fat neek's growing process
This KSI lad looks alot like JJ
1:12 looks like he’s having a Vietnam flashback
He made it also I made it before 1 million views
Bascily he's grateful for everything that he has
milk
My guy Ksi ! Love you mate ! I will always support you JJ !
It’s crazy what hard work can get you” -KSI
10 minutes with jj and no insults, what is going on fam
love you, jj ♥️
Dang thats our guy
The shots of him just pouting cracked me up for some reason 🤣🤣🤣 the cameraman done him dirty
KSI day 1’s in the house
I do like Ksi but Jesus I wish he didn’t make music he’s so cringe when he raps but he’s a great guy and deserves all he’s got
1:10 pewdiepie: hmmmm
This dude is my idol fr i wish i could be like him one day just achive my dreams
👁️  👁️    👃    👄
Every dislike = Jake Paul fan..
Seriously though. JJ’s girl is so lucky.
The 🐐 of YouTube doesn’t matter what anyone says
Don't go bald guess u have to do the opposite
Its not 10 minutes tho????
Top dog.
Was the interviewer Northern Irish?
Really ksi.... all this great people have explained their story on here, and now ksi... that's a downgrade...  Just saying 👌  No hate on ksi, just I can go watch him whenever I feel like it...
Ksi looks buff you know
10 minutes with our fat neek
Ksi is a goat
Isn’t this jj olatunji
It’s sad he only posts music on his channel now, wish he played games or even do Reddit content like the others in the sidemen
Petition to get harry on
Damn, that’s the same guy who shat on a spade and threw it in a tent
Every interview KSI talks about himself
Kinda brings tears into your eyes when u started watching him back in the days and seeing how far he has come now.
Whenever u get jj(ksi) on a video its Cashcall no cap.
MAAAAAAAAAAAD
Imagine showing these 10 minutes of video to JJ 10 years back...Every single word he speaks would hit like a tonne of bricks.
He resembles a man now. He’s grown.
Ksi: it's hard to be friends with someone you beat. Anime protagonists and their rival: Imma just ignore that
We need 10 minutes with babatunde
1:13 lol wtf dude hahahahah
Shout out jj for getting rid of my depression daily fam
Big inspiration JJ
18 now and grew up watching JJ seeing his growth acc makes me so proud.
i’m so proud of jj he’s so genuine and deserves all of the good things that are coming for him
AYEEE IM SO PROUD OF THIS GUYY
Damn JJ talking at an acceptable volume, that’s new. Anyway all jokes aside I love seeing these honest interviews, keep them up and good one JJ!
8:25  JJ: I don’t even look at numbers anymore Also JJ: let’s check his monthly listeners
I love this guy more than I can say💙
So proud of our Fat Neek for how far he's come
Me: thinking JJ would be professional and make a positive comment on Jake  JJ: Ive always hated Jake Paul ,I think he’s a twat
We love our fat neek
I was subbed on my old channel before they did all that crazy YouTube update email thing go KSI
🙋
JJ in 2016: I have the best life ever! 2017: Are you sure about that, kid?
Comments on this vid are all positive but his comments is a madness
Fight Nate Robinson
Smiled the full time such good guy.
Why have they got the name wrong in the title. This is JJ Olatinji not KSI, such an obvious mistake. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
It’s crazy how ksi prevents depression for some people I’m so happy for him
jj: i don’t even look at numbers now also jj: HoW mAnY mOnThLy LiStEners?!?!
This man is the definition of the meaning you can do what you want if you believe in yourself
Love him or hate him, hes still doing what he wants to.
*DONT FORGET TO*  _Claim your “here before 100K views” Card !_
JJ: I don't really look at numbers Also JJ anytime anyone does anything: Yeah but what's there monthly listeners
Is it just me that turned the Volume down before watching this video? Then realising it’s not his channel so it’ll be at a moderate level
Wow, this guy KSI really looks like Jj Olatunji.   *there is one imposter among us*
JJ is one of the youtubers that i watched from the start and still watch
Hit home when he said I’m a type of person to do the opposite someone says eg. Parents
Protect this man at all costs. I mean it. We’ve lost too many legends in the past year
This video is so calming
I have no clue who this man is, I thought I saw the fatneek
JJ will watch this in 5 years:  “Ayo I was so clapped bro” “This is so cringe fam” 𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙚 𝙇𝙖𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 “My nose was so big man” “I couldn’t even grow a beard”
This guy looks like he’s a trumpet player. He should try it one day.
I never heard him quite
Just a reminder that this guys has fans that make fun of him on a daily basis
wtf is that 1:12 😂
Anyone who disagrees with the fact the sidemen carry the uk youtube scene. You’re delusional
🐐
JJ: “ I don’t look at numbers anymore “  Also JJ: “ LeTS SeE His mONThlY LiSTeNErs”  Reddit: another one 😂😂
We love you fat neek we do
KSI: *sees views from ethans documentary*  KSI: Ahhhh I know, Ill talk about my past and make up a depressing story
Can’t want to see this on the reddit
Hmm maybe he is lonely deep inside
78127th
I really don’t understand why people prefer and agree with Jake Paul rather than JJ, he is such an amazing person compared to the absolute dump of a man Jake Paul lol!
Are u from northern Ireland
my fat neek 🙏
This is a great video, i have to admit i agree with jjs opinions but logan is now a great guy and produces good content
who else felt like he was trying his best not to laugh in the close up shots like the one in the outro XD
Why I’m I watching this I already know this
🌟🌟😍😍
Breadbatch fans who came here
I like this side of jj
KSI is really cool guy, i want to meet him
I wondered why ksi didnt make a video, he is bloody here
We are proud of out fatneek and we love him soo much ♥️
This is KSI, not JJ
i like JJ alot.. but this video is nothing new.. so    do not waste time.. he covered pretty much everything in 2018and 2019 it's same old story all over
2:31 he also didn’t think that he would have a reddit that bullies him
A video where I don't need to hover over the volume button haha. JJ is such a likeable and genuine guy, watched him and many others since the very beginning and he's paved the way for so many others! Genuinely wish the absolute best for him!
I am the 420th comment
When are they going to add subtitles
JJ "I wasn't looking at numbers" Reddit "I smell meat. Meme meat"
He seems so calm it’s weird
Wow I watched Ksi at full volume without dying, first time he’s not screaming lol
You know whats funny Ksi never talks about his movie 😂💔
No offense but these questions are fucking stupid lol. Terrible interview performance by these lads
he is so cute🥺
Damn Ksi is everyone lately
Why they takin shots of him like that😂
I was thinking his voice sounded kinda weird, then I realised he was talking at an acceptable volume lol
I mean Ik it’ll never happen but I would actually Love Logan/joe and to be mates
Ksi is impossible to dislike such a genuine down to earth bloke
Who knew that same KSI from 2011 would become who he is now.
Disgraceful. Man forgot about Jide Junior.
Allow it fam
This guy is great, he should make a YouTube channel or something
OUR FAT NEEK <3
JJ LETSSS GOO
This is so fat
10 mins and 8 seconds with KSI ‼️
The interviewer was asking good questions, props to him.
Watched this lad from the start mad to see how far he has come, 100% deserves everything he’s worked for!
Genuinely humble man, this is why I’ve still been sticking around all these years.
JJ: I don’t look at numbers anymore.  Also JJ: Let’s check his monthly listeners!
For once he's not shouting lol
" 4:20 " yea...EvErYdAy bRo.
Jj= True king ❤🏆
"Talent can get you far, but hardworking can take you anywhere" - knowledge
“And logans brother” 💀💀💀💀
a 🐐 amongst us
I had to connect to my speaker and put it up to my ear just so it sounds like JJ
Who is just staying up late and watching this amazing video..??
Logan Paul makes better content than ksi
He's such a genuine nice guy
We love and appreciate our fatneek ❤️
Anyone here from breadbatch
Jj never talks about his film 😂😂
Anyone keep getting these stadia ads
JJ: I don’t really look at the numbers anymore  Also JJ : Aight let’s check your monthly listeners
Lets be honest you all turned the brightness up
Ksi love keep doing what your doing dont let anyone tell u different
Okay
The 🐐
WH🤣?
Hi.
JJ left the chat
I’m just annoyed at that bit of white fluff on his t shirt lol
Some great words from our favourite fat neek
9:39 ' It's crazy what hard work can get (you) ' KSI Olajide Olatunji
KSI looks Big
Great Words JJ
JJ our fat neek representing 🇬🇧🐐
Hahaha look at all the jealous nerds in the comments
That laugh isn't jj nor ksi. 🤔
I mean im not gonna lie i would like to see jj and logan as not TRUE friends but good friend  Logan is very good guy and so as jj
Aye yoo guys  Allow it fam  Ffs😂😂😂
JJ and ksi should meet, they both seem to have similar interests and family
JJ lookin fresh outta Prison with that fit
I think you can be friends with someone you’ve boxed. I think he might be thinking of it a bit too deeply
......
I think ksi is a true inspiration but he does realize that his music audience,boxing audience and his youtube audience are the same loyal fans like me and around 8 million true fans because not all the subscribers don't watch your videos
JJ: It's hard to be friends with someone that has beaten you. Jide & Yinka: 👁👄👁
Jj is ♥️
1:11 lmao wtf is that angle
He is a true inspiration, i remember the First thing i saw from him was the video with racist AI or something quite a while ago, and i watch him till this day. I can't believe how far he made it and remained humble.
flexing the jawline on camera jj
Kinda crazy how tomorrow it is a year ago that Michael Buffer said: “From the UNITED KINGDOM....”
PROUD OF HIM 😢 👑
Watching this guy after a shitty is truly magical fucking love this dude
Ksi carries uk YouTube so well,  what a guy. You can’t hate him.
Our fat-neek is on point guyssss
He might be a fat neek but he is our fat neek, love you JJ
Such a big inspiration of mine cant wait to see what he does next
Something in the back of my head tells me in 50 years he'll be friends with Logan and Joe, just sitting back and reminiscing. Dunno why.
Ksi: i didn’t worry about numbers JJ Olatunji: alright let’s see how many monthly listeners you have
KSI’s reddit is just his fans roasting him, but then you realize what he had done to be here... and you realize, damn... he’s really good at what he does...
Respect ✊🏼
1:12 JJ was 11 in 2004... YouTube wasn't even a thing in 2004 😂
I love JJ, but it’s sad to hear he’ll never be true friend with Joe, they well like so good friends back in the day
Did ye aye?
Imagine if Jake Paul did an interview like this, yikes I would hate his voice and punch my screen.
There’s nothing to say that I’m proud to be a KSI fan since like 2013. Weird but amazing that JJ is where he is right now lmao
i love ksi so much its insane how inspired i am by him i love you bro'
I see KSI content I click
Ty youtube algorithm for bringing me here
JJ has really grown into a really well-rounded individual, keep killing it man you da goat.
For first time..I m watching KSI video with full volume..
jj: i dont check numbers any more   also jj: yo lets check his monthly listeners
Claim your before 1 million views ticket here
I fucking love this guy
Why can't this guy just tell the truth everyone knows about the JideJunior channel so why did you skip over that
I love ksi u kno he got me into YouTube in 2017 even deji and a guy called Freugend that's where I got my name freugend
👑
“I think he’s a twat” 💀😂
Jj is awesome 🙌🏽❤️. KSI GANG WYA? 🔥
“I started....... f.... falling”   JJ has malfunctioned
Jj: I dont really look at Numbers now Also jj just a couple months ago: whats his monthly listeners
I was dead at 1:12
wtf is that angle at 1:12 lmfao
Imagine being one of the 37 losers who disliked this video
This is where you can find all the reddit user that recycle posts on his page
“Logan’s brother”  Yep. Sounds about right.
Ksi is the goat
I like this bloke.
Bro ksi is an Inspiration
5 mins in the video and already 4 ads.... chillll
We love you JJ!🖤
Damn it feels good seeing jj like this ❤️   But I hoped  Babatunde was here too..
Hey this guys genuine, he should do something like creating content on yt, also his voice is very good for a rapper, ALSO he is very buff he should think about boxing or some shiz
From watching this guy in 2012 when I was in year 7, been a huge supporter to him. To then seeing him topping charts in the music history, creating history in the YouTube scene with boxing, having one of the biggest fanbase in the world. JJ has honestly shown passion and love to people and inspired so many people to do what they love no matter what. I have mad respect and love for this Legend. Proud of you JJ!👌
Ksi is a good person
I screamed when I saw this on my phone
The dude looks like he came straight outa prison hahaha But for real tho, JJ is a different creature, a beast of a man. Respect!
👇People before 1mil views
4:30 he sacrificed his own life for Pakistan 🇵🇰🍇!!!
Where is KSI I only see Babatundi a wild creature of a man.....
im proud of my boy jj
Such inspiration man
JJ’s looking hench recently, even bigger than he was for the Logan fight. He’s carrying a bit more fat, but he’s got even more muscle.
i wonder how r/ksi will make fun of JJ with this
U gotta love how he has changed through the years and the same with the whole group
Great video
KSI is such a huge inspiration
Who else normally doesn’t normally watch ladbible but cause JJ/KSI was in the title clicked
KSI was such a big part of my childhood and teenage years, and I’m still a big fan today. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find him inspirational, to see how he’s grown and proved people wrong time and time again, it’s something I can relate too. JJ is the greatest YouTuber of all time, hands down.
i want be be good at youtube just like jj 😥
"I dont look at the numbers now" Also KSI : "What's your spotify streams?"
jj: I dont look at numbers or analytics anymore       Also jj: lets see your monthly listeners mate
Love you jj
Well you still clapped
It's my dream to meet KSI!!
i pray to god that KSI doesn’t do what he said at 4:58 with Jake Paul. Please train my guy
Why does it say in the description that he fought against his brother Jake Paul lol
can we have some babatunde interviews ? why is it ksi everytime
JJ: I don’t look at numbers  Also JJ: Let’s take a look at there monthly listener
I’m happy for him ❤️
When you break something and your mom look at you the reaction 1:12 😂😂
Epic
Why does jj look sad 🥺
Ksi made a big raise from his room with deji to Craig David and digital farm animals
He's come so far man, so proud of him
BBc is here
ksi is a actually certi when he dont try act bad
KSI ,JJ is one of the most loyal Kind funny positive most genuine celebrities out there always putting out content for his fans for what they ask he’s a decent guy his music is unbelievable I really hope the best for his future he’s incredibly talented 🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️
our fat neek has come a long way lads
He looks big dont know y??😂😂
i am a hug fan of him ..
Remember jealous emo teens, for you guys he's KSI, for fans from back in the day and OG fans, he's JJ. If you can't appreciate his success, it shows how jealous you are. He is the true YouTube GOAT. Getting 100 Million subs from just meme/movement was impressive but making high quality music with the big musicians and making/winning one of the biggest events ever and be apart of the best youtube group(Sidemen) and representing the youtubers well, unlike Lilly Singh. He is the goat, I've never liked him that much, but I respect him for his resilience and integrity.
Remember this: everyone starts from somewhere. look your idols aren't magically famous. If they can do it I believe you can do it. You will do it :)))
This person is a legend. So inspirational.
This guy is a LEGEND  change my mind
i like KSI
Who tf is jsi
They acc @ted Sidemen Sunday lmao
1:11 can someone explain to me what the point of this shot was 😂 and this one 6:47 😂 and this one 8:46 and this one 9:40🤣
I was thinking his voice sounded kinda weird, then I realised he was talking at an acceptable volume lol
Our fat neek is on ladbible
I hope JJ ever gets on the telly too. That’d be so cool
Watch this get a mad amount of views because its JJ
KSI def my favorite youtuber
1:12 I can’t imagine how awkward that was for him
I feel like even after the fights with Logan KSI would have been willing to go on his podcast and hash things out but for NO Reason when jake went on Logans podcast he was randomly chatting shit in jjs response video you can tell that he was pissed he didn't like Logan but it was still sorta a betrayal especially since he was complimenting him around that time shit was moving in the right direction and it just shows that jj ain't petty but Logan had to go and randomly fuck things up. Without a doubt we all know what kinda of person jake is there's no need for me to give examples but Logan differently matured and changed since EVERYTHING you can tell from his content but when he's around jake he goes back to his old ways it shows how much BETTER jj is mentally then Logan to not get so easily manipulated
JJ: ”I dont even look at numbers anymore”   Also JJ: *”Ayo lets look at his monthly listeners”*
Such a sound geezer, fair play to him and wish him all the best.
Can’t wait for jake to get knocked onto the canvas
I remember when lads bible was a Facebook page that willne made fun of
Whos here before 10 Million Views?👏
Mad respect for JJ. A genuine and amazing guy❤️
yes our fat neek made it onto ladbible
Tried to swipe up on his Insta story, didn’t work... Cheers JJ.
This guy is a Beerus.
Proud of our Fatneek❤❤
You realize how clapped he is when the camera zooms in on his face
Bruh why does KSI looks like he's in prison
People from his insta story can only like
I’m sorry but how is he saying his parents were strict? Has not seen his old qna Sunday’s with his mum and dad
People from his insta story can only like
I think we can now tell that he works out😂
Who else came when they saw family
he radiates inspiration, genuinely an icon of our generation
I don't know what to comment, the vid speaks for itself sooo stan JJ
look at our fat neek so inspirational
this is guy is such a legend. We should appreciate him more
true king
saw dis on insta
KSI is a legend.. like if you agree.
i can’t believe he was quiet!
Love you JJ💙
We make fun of him, but he's a really humble and genuine person, and seeing him grow is great.
i hate the "did you ever think it you would get this far" question
This is my 🐐. There is not a person alive that inspires me more than him and I don't think there ever will be.
Who's here before million views?
You see jj you watch the video 😂
KSI and the Sidemen carry the UK Youtube scene. KSI deserves everything he got 🙌
Respect bro❤️
You always make my day
I don’t rate his music, he’s gd but I can’t look past the fact he went to private school, and his content is so repeated jus try not to laughs but fair play to the guy I respect him still
I am so happy for him. He has come so far. God bless. You are amazing
This man is the reason I’m here.
The “S” in KSI is for staying strong 💪🏾
KSI is the best example that if you work hard, you can do anything you want. He’s a true role model 🖤
Top lad
Ksi had inspired me to challenge and have confidence in myself
LeSS GoOOO
AYE WHO CAME FROM HIS STORY
1:12 He’s trying so hard not to laugh
It's actually sick to see YouTube personalities talk about stuff like this
It’s seriously amazing to see how far he’s come. I’m so proud of him 🤩
So proud of him
🎉
Good guy 🤝
Chris akabusi is doing well looking good for his age awogga.
Ksi awogga
KSI is one of my favorite people on YouTube. He seems to be a genuine person.
Here comes new memes
Nice
Bro that's dedication
KSI , possibly the ugliest man on earth ?? He looks like if Harvey price matted with pepperami
KSI: "I don't even look at numbers anymore" Fans: "Aight let's check how many times he checks monthly listeners"
How did he end up here?
4head
Twat I don't watch KSI videos but he seems like a humble man 🙏
Soft White Underbelly, anyone?
Nah I miss joe well we n ksi
I've watched ksi from a kid but I can't stand when he classes himself as a boxer he has the worst boxing technique ever and has never fought a boxer 🤦‍♂️😂 stick to youtube King
wanker
Did he honestly just say "i decided to make myself happy" and not make a masturbation joke
KSI aka JJ Olatunji and Deji run YouTube. Imagine they have 3 channels between them that has 10 million subscribers...Facts or correct?
I am waiting for the day where JJ and Deji make a video together again.
3rd
redditors where u at
Ksi is impossible to dislike such a genuine down to earth bloke  Edit: OMG 4k likes! Im famous as KSI himself! Haha thanks so much everyone im so happy!
👍
1st
how's the ladbible admin doing today?
