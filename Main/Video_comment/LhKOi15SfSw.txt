Which brawler are you MOST excited for!? SUBSCRIBE for update sneak peeks!
0:13 “Mo” and 5:50 “Larry and Lori” 😭🙏
We got UwU Collette before Gta6
Whos here 2024 spring
For the exclusive brawl pass skin, can I buy that with bling or gems in the future?
For the brawl pass exclusive skin, can I buy it with bling or gems in the future?
Why is the barley when you are talking about mico why was barley the old version
Due to this update, Brawl stars is now pay to win. Horrid!
Barly is that you? 2:20 look
Am I the only one that noticed a cursed barley 😂
Can you join my club called killer katz!My name is Daniel in Brall Stars!
Kairos larry and lawrie are epics
kit = close range crow + dymamike
Im furious about the brawl pass change regardless. Like i donr even want to play anymore. Please advocate
I was confuse for this season. Turns out its season 22. Theyre showing season 22 for the colette anime skin n kits skin for  season 23 😓
Can we get next brawl pass by gems😢
The first ever legendary support???
Larry and Lori have a gadget that's switching weapons like you switch with the bot and they get the ticket while you get the shotgun
Nobody seeing the rework of barley at the miko super?
Is Kit the next brawl pass character? Or is it just a legendary character for 3800credits?
Gonna get that poco skin for sure now that i can't  buy the brawl pass with gems.
They are epic brawlers
0:40 what is going on with barly his walk is like maxes
Anyone else see the barley rework?
No brawl pass with gems ?! This is super greedy ... Shame ...
So should I buy this seasons brawl pass for 169?
Question. How many Gems will the new free battle pass include(normal battle pass), you said 50. But in the previous battle pass which we have right now (chrlie) we get 90 Gems. So does that mean we will get less in the Gems in the new battle pass???like Why
Has anyone noticed that Barley got new walking animations? (Possible Remodel?)
"Toon spike will be a twenty-nine-" "😮🥳" "uh 299 gem" "😐😞🫡🔫"
So will new hypercharges come out for the next season or nah?
ngl mico ruined the game he’s so annoying
Im disappointment about p2w brawl pass  dang...
hey kairos, if possible after the brawl pass releases compare it fully in a video cause i am happy with most of it just not the part where we wont get to unlock the latest brawler now 😅
It's Lawrie, not Lori
You will be able to play lorry(the bad bot we’ll have a gadget to do that)
#SantaStu
LESGOOO 5 V 5 FINAALLY!!
Who is the artist of the draw of Larry and Lawrie in the thumbnail?
Don't Kiiro Pawlette give you default Piper vibes? The same color hair and clothes? 🤔🤔🤔
They took the kings from clash royale and brought them in brawl stars.
barley looking wild
19:05 huh
YO BRO IS THAT OG BARLEY
Yooo is that yuumi from legue of legends?
I like all the features and all but what I do not understand is that nobody seems to care much about the change to what you can buy with gems. They are literally changing what you can buy with the gems you bought with your money! People who have bought and stacked up on gems to buy future brawlpasses  now have to spend (much) more money again for that purpose. How is that acceptable? I have reached out to supercell support and other channels and now I am here. @kairosgaming as voice of the community how do you feel about this change? I know it is not easy to think of solutions here, transition period?, but something is not right.
It's really gonna be a hyper ultra super mega update ever
19:07 what do you mean "transformed into a brawler"?😟
Hi friends kindly suggest upgrade mico to max is it worth or buy hyper charge for other brawler is worth kindly suggest im in two thinking what can i do now
Is that a barley remodel at 2:00?
I think for Larry and Laurie, it would be cool for them to actually be played simultaneously, like Lola and her ego. To balance it out they could be individually weaker, but to take them down you need to take down both. The super could be a self heal that heals both and revives one if it was taken down.....
9:15 speaking of hypercharges,why not make a hypercharge olympics?🧐🧐
so now the brawl pass can't be bought by using gems???
DID NOBODY NOTICE BARLEYS WALKING ANIM CHANGE?!?
Will the hypercharge gem packs be available for coins after the 2 week period?
I don’t really like that they are doing lots of recolored skins, especially of brawl pass, like Lola’ and now Fang’ skins
THEY NERFED MY GIRLIES RARITY T-T atleast she got a neko skin or something idfk
5 years in n we still can’t report players :/
Clash royale = brawl stars (now
Please take hyper charge out the game. It just makes everything off balanced and you can’t even counter these hyper charges. It’d also a pay to play feature. I hate how everyone’s hyper charging and just wiping teams. Hyper charge sucks I might quit
The last brawler looks like an epic rarity one
So basically they copied Yuumi from League of Legends, which is a huge mistake
Whats with barley?
A insane video that helps a lot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m gonna love kit
Wait, what rarity will fang be once chromatics are gone?
Wow another Yuumi situation ... Kit will be so Toxic
0:41 did they change how barley walks omg is thsi fake or real ???
Did anyone else notice when he was analysing mico, barely looked really different?
Dark angel colt awfully reminds me of gabriel from ultrakill
Kit is buzz 2.O
nooo why did they add yumi to brawlstars
I'm glad they are finally picking popular brawlers to give hyper charges to
Actually Spike was the first ever legendary support brawler but then they changed him to a damage dealer
no way yuumi in brawl stars?
METEOR STRIKE
One thing I realised is that barleys walking/running animation was changed in the brawl talk i know it’s kind of useless information but still it’s a change to barley.
I can’t wait for this
#QLCQJ2Y00
I want to see 5 trowers on 5v5,and also ill pay anything for that Collette skin
Shelly remodel is more of a revamp since it just changing little small thing on the characters to make it look more real
I love.the new brawler Larry lawrie he looks.a.good bralwer
It's not only shelly thats gonna be changed. Did you see barley?
I think for the new brawler you should be able to switch between with brother your controlling
kit is witch shelly's cat
Here's another league of legends character inspired by lol
Why is Barley shuffling so weird in the mico hypercharge part
Can my store credit be used to unlock kit ?
Doomfist
Ayo that piper skin 😏
I wish we could get the two bots as a swapper type thing
So, I was just watching this video but at 1:59 I noticed that barleys running animation changed. Not sure if this is supposed to be for the update or not
I guess they really added Doomfist and Yummi to the game
2:00 I just noticed barley animation changed
brawl stars is copying overwatch. mico's super is the exact same as doom fist. Lou is the exact same as mei. Meg is the exact same as dva.
Kit with Meg healing was not a bug. Since Kit is healing the mech, it doesn't "take damage", and thus follows the same rules as any other brawler where they start healing off when they do not attack or take damage for a bit. Hopefully they will fix that and not allow the mech to be healed from Kit, else this will be busted
miko is essentially a good doomfist from ow
GUYS!!! KIT IS HERE🎉🎉🎉!!!
Buddy, do NOT encourage skull emoji comments. Those should’ve died months ago.
*fang*
I followed his f2p and know I've got can't :)
When exactly is the update happening?
2:10 why does barley look like that?
is it me or barley looks weird
Karios
Do they complete rt Trio or do they count as one brawler
R34 artist are gonna have a field day 🥵
Kit is Mimikyu from Pokémon unite
0:40 cursed barley walk animation
8-bit w 🍸🗿 Jessie 💀
the mico apocalypse is starting soon
Do we know when the update will launch?
The Collett skin is soo 🥵
So the brawl pass skin come back after a year but what about the recolours...will they come back too or are an exclusive feature to the brawlpass+?
yea 5v5 i still have no one to play with :(
i really regret spending 100$ to buy gems in this game which are nothing more than trash now. i have everything maxed out and not ever gonna spend a single penny anymore in this volatile game where so much money spent becomes trash in an instant. NEVER EVER GONNA SPEND A SINGLE PENNY, NEVER EVER! filthy developers..
warwicks ultimate + yuumi. wierd combination but alright
Supercell fr added yuumi to brawl stars 😭😭
I want kit so bad😊
timestamps wya
9:47 can someone please explain what this 1000 coin offer is?
Why does my boy barley look like that😔 1:06
i really hope supercell doesnt put ads cuz supercell games are known for having 0 ads
Literally watching this again I can’t wait for this update!
why is barley walking so weird?
This update is so hype lmao
Did someone notice the barley's animation it kinda weird now..?
عبد القدوس افضل بطل باللعبة
Also if you look closely you can see Barley having a different running animation 0:14
#santastu
Ignoring all the new toys that SC clearly wants us to focus on. This update IMO is decent. There is a lot of new content both for paid and non paid players but ((as a paid player)) it seems like SC is giving non paid players the short end of the stick ((similar to their other games)) but the brawlstars team is definitely doing a food job of softening the blow or hiding the damage at least. But some things to keep in mind. StarrDrops on the pass is not a budd to progression at all. Considering that these drops will likely be replacing the tiers of things like token doublers, coins, and power points and what not and the fact that 6/10 you're going to be getting a rare drop you'll likely end up with things you dont necessarily need. I've been scrolling through ths reddit posts long enough to know that a major reason people don't like starrdrops is because you usually don't get anything you want when you open them whether it be getting lame rare drops like token doublers or power points and then when you do get that legendary drop it's just more power points or a pin/cosmetic for a brawler that you may or may not want. Not to sound ungrateful or overly negative but people don't like randomized rewards as much as SC mysterious magical data ((that they still havent shared publically)) wants to lead everyone to believe and most people would rather get consistent rewards. ((Well how come in the past after the removal of boxes did people complain and what about starrdrops reviving the game in a sense. Logically I can attirubute this to the fact that A. The marketing for Drops was more enticing than the actual product I mean free skins and cosmetics as well as progression items sounds great but what we got was an overload of items that most players don't need that came at a major nerf to progression in other places. And B. After the removal of boxes progression was so bad that anything especially the new shiny progression method would be recived well.)) People didnt miss random loot and boxes as much as they wanted good progression which after the removal of boxes the game lacked. It seems SC's method of implementing new progression methods is to nerf the old ones to the point where anything they give only has to be slightly better and it will be well recived. The only way drops in the pass could be a buff over getting flat rewards like before is if these drops are guaranteed to be a high rarity ((which is unlikely given the footage and the guaranteed legendary drop at the end of the pass being different from the rest.)) Or if they also buff the other progression methods that they previously nerfed when they introduced starr drops. If not people will end up going through the pass and end up with an excess of non vital currencies and a lack of the most important one GOLD the thing needed to purchase Hypercharges which have proven to be very deciding when it comes to matches. Given the team with more/better hypercharges is likely to win. This is also ignoring the fact that no improvements to things like matchmaking ((skillbased)) or other issues people have were mentioned. They did however mention a whole lot of skins new and returning which shows how SC is trying to monetize the game even more with their new *look at all the shiny new skins* model. All in all my gipes can be limited to   -The pass is no longer free every few seasons and there isnt enough supporting evidence to show that the buff to the free pass will be worth it seeing as before every few seasons free players would get the rewards of both the free pass AND the paid one which is literally double the rewards so unless this new free pass is 2x value this is a nerf.  -The Buffs that they have shown in the new pass don't make up for the loss of progression to free players and this is including all the other nerfs to progression that we have been seeing for example power league giving waaay less bling to compensate for all the bling we would be getting in other places i for one can say with 100% certainty that this is jist straight up not true. Since the nerf to bling all the bling I've gathered from drops isnt even equal to one tier of rewards to the last power league track ((although to be fair we don't know specifics yet so there is still benefit of the doubt.))  -They keep pushing starrdrops down our throat at every opportunity because they are seemingly convinced we want random rewards when all that leads to is an excess of token doublers and power points with no way to spend said power points because everyone needs gold and we arent getting enough of it because we need gold to upgrade our brawlers, buy gears, buy hyperchages ((which al insanely overpriced given how much of an advantage they give you durinf gameplay)) people dont want random rewards and eveyone would be more than happy with flat basic rewards if SC made them fair but instead they nerf all the flat rewards and give the random ones more often so that they seem much better.  -The starr drops arent even rewarding when you do get a good one because youll often end up with rewards for a brawler you may not play or like. I've seen too many posts and comments about people getting pins and cosmetics including skins for characters they don't like. ((For example I got police RT from a drop when I much would have rathered the gem or bling equivalent since I will literally never use that skin ever and that's not me veing ungrateful I deliberately chose not to buy that skin because to me it was not only a bad skin but I prefer his brawlpass skin way better. But instead SC took currency i could have used at my own discretion and bought a skin I would have never wanted to or like to own.))  -And lastly SC seems to be pushing monetization on the game more than ever as of late given now you have to buy the pass, they are bringing back old exclusive skins, they are adding more skins than ever. For example Fang had almost no skins for like an entire year after release under their old model but Nico is releasing with almost double what Fang had. ((This is relevant because the skin market is getting flooded and with the increase of skins and quality it is obvious SC wants you to buy gems and skins now more than ever.))   No hate to the video or to the dev team ((necessarily)) but lying to our face about these changes not being a nerf doesn't rock my boat well. These new changes are definitely a nerf compared to the highlights of the past. The dev team is doing a great job of softening the blow which is more than other teams can say but just because others are doing it worse doesn't make this good. Hopefully now at least we can get a break from all the nerfs to progression. And of course I am hoping to be 100% wrong and waffling on about nothing sounding mad out of my mind but we will have to wait and see.
Bro Morita and eager have a baby mico 💀💀💀💀
As a long time Gedi-Kor fan I thinks iys awesome his work is getting recognised by supercell. (For newer players Gedi-Kor is probably the best skim fan art artist in the bs community, and he is alsi the one that designed Horus Bo)
so virus 8-bit won‘t be an exklusive skin anymore?
“Antivirus 8-bit is getting the legendary treatment, and he is getting a new variation called Antiviruse 8-bit” -Kairos 2023
I would really appreciate some guidance on how to max out getting the new brawlers in the new systems. I used to have maxed out account at lvl 9. Now I still have all of the brawlers, but would be nice to get any new ones ASAP to play new ones before they fix the balance :D
What about a button to report people for cheating/teaming easier
Kairos kinda SUS 16:38
Wait what trio is kit in if not brawlywood?
the brawl pass + is gonna cost gems or money?
Imagine if Lory and Larry are interchangeable
I think I'll only use my gems on hypercharges now
Can someone explain why barely looks so small near the start of the video
2:18 barly is a bit sus☠💀
''Kid is the first ever legendary support brawler!''  Sandy: ,, Are you shure about that?!"
you are wrong sandy is the firs support brawler
Kit's the first Legendary support brawler?? What happened to Sandy, did he get reclassified?
Nobody talking about barley running or walking animation Revamp not in brawl talk?!?!?!? Edit: also why tf does barley look shorter💀💀💀💀 Plus the NPC looking idle thingy💀💀💀
Micos super is copied from pokemon unite
I'm not sure why people feel that progression is being buffed for free-to-play players, because hypercharge and the gears are constantly being introduced to raise the progression ceiling. 5000 coins for a hypercharge is just bonkers. Giving you more resources while raising the amount of resources required for progression is not buffing progression in any way.  I used to have a nearly maxed account, today that same account is FAR from being maxed.
Did barley get remodel? 2:11
Bro said  "Kit is the only legendary support brawler" Sandy be like: 😢
Did anyone notice the barley when Mico‘s Hypercharge is shown??
Kairos what is wrong whit barley 2:11
Who makes the art for your thumbnails?
this game right now is doing at least 10 times better than 2 or 3 years ago
My only question is how much the new brawl pass price will be
I think that in 5v5 gem grab you will need 20 gems to start the countdown because in the clip the blue team has 18 gems and there is no countdown.
Kairos said fap
If you look at the enemy barley at 2:12 , he is not playing his regular moving animation
Kit is yumi in League of legends
I realized after rewatching that Barley is getting some new animations. Unless that's a bug in the dev build
Kit isn't first support legendary brawler!! Sandy is first support legendary brawler
Everybody: New brawlers and so many skins ! Me: WHAT IS THAT BARLEY ANIMATION!?
If you click on the camera on the screen you go to a security area and if you click on the items on the table other stuff happen
Now hear me out. Collette hyper charge + Crow hyper charge in heist = Bye bye safe
it is 50% faster bats for mortis mithic gear b/c Lex found it
Did barly got a remodel?😮
#SantaStu
Since Larry and Lawrie are 2 in 1 brawlers, does that mean that the Starr Park Hub trio is NOT complete yet?
Voice chat between only friends would be awesome for me
How much dose the fereochios fang cost  I misspeald
I found something about Mico, when he is showed his super circle grows, but when they show his Hypercharge his circle does not grow
2:23 We have reworked barley
2:30 so were not going to talk about that bot barley?
Kairos please bring back eating challenges now that you can save Starr drops
Whens the sneak peak
#SantaStu
Kit super is funny
I did not get everything from my Throphy Road yet. Is it better to wait until the rewards are changed to Starr Drops or is purchasing now better? What would you say?
Kit is the simpler version of yumi from league of legends 😂
I'm still mad about Brazilians choosing the pipper skin. The Mandy carnival skin was first on a character than doesn't have 10 billions skins. And was better.
Sandy is a support brawler too😂
Kit is Freaking Yumi all over again
Does anyone know how much the brawl pass is gonna cost?
Did barley get a remodel he walks weird
Barly is getting a remodel
Im also trying to create brawl stars content but it’s not working nobody watches it maybe it’s just bad idk can you guys rate it in my comments?
#SantaStu
I think there should be a permanent 5v5 game mode.  How? Well everyday one game mode is 5v5. And it change everyday. I think that would be cool.
Did no one notice barleys new model/animation?
I just noticed something..... If you pause at 4:12 , when max dies and drops the gems, they are dropped in the shape of a smiley face. I'm sure that I'm not the first to notice this and i know it's not that important but i noticed it so i thought i might share. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
#santastu
Yuumi
Gam grab will be like boom beach Frontline
WHAT? BARLEY IS UPGRADING 😂😂😂😂
GUYS AM İ ONE THE SAW BARLEYS RUN AND NORMAL İS DİFERENT JUST LOOK 2:00
I can't believe am saying that but Spike is so fucking cute
was i the only one seeing a barley remodel 1:06
wow is that a barley rework
Someone tell supercell i can't tell who im fighting because of skins, i have quit for a while, but everytime i come back to play, literally have no idea who I'm fighting, need to add the name of ghe brawler above the players name in small text
the new legendary support brawler is a rip off of yummi from leauge of legends basically 😂😂😂
Why does brawl stars not get sued for copying league of legends wtf
What about trophy road ?! 😅 Should we keep our rewards or open them
New barley running animation
I've always wanted two brawlers in one ever since the pirate brawlidays (for some reason i couldn't comprehend what that Brawl Talk shown us...) So the bots are pretty cool! Kit and mico as well. Kit is like the Mickey Mouse of Starr Park or something alike (Oswald the lucky rabbit?) Interesting concept and pretty fun idea for a brawler that latches onto people.
Kit will just play piggyback the whole game lol
I love your jokes they’re so funny
I am confused so it's like we buy the brawl pass and than pay again for the plus?
Is it worth buying pearl with 1250 croma credit? ,i have 1250.  If i save the cc(croma credit) . after update cc convert to credit.does it go to fame?,that is my fear..☠️  As you know guys ,pearl is epic that is 925 credit, so i can save remaining credit for nxt brawler 😎, after update,   .....if it is not go to fame,   Any one please Reply, give me ur opinions 😢😢😢😢
0:14 DO I ONLY SEE THAT THE WALKING ANIMATION OF BARLEY CHANGED?
1:59  guys look at the Barley he’s look like a classic version of himself
I think y all missed that when mico has the yellow bar full, he instantly reloads one ammo and steals one from enemies
Is barley also getting a remodel cause when u were showing mico u can see barley looking hella diffrent❤
YOU CAN SEE THE BARLEY REWORK
BARLEY GOT A REWORK
HAS ANYONE NOTICE THAT ALL THREE BRAWLERS ARE THROWERS And that barly has a different walking animation
Gadget idea for larry and laurie: for 5 seconds u can switch to laurie and play as him for 5 seconds
pp uiygi
When are you going to make the balance changes and gears video
Kairos i think this update is going to sad most f2p maxed out players like me cuz after the 21st season is over all of our credits from earlier seasons will be collected and then they will release a legendary. I have like more than 10k credits (combining both chroma credits and credits) which will go to fame😢😢 and simply will be wasted
Dynamic hypercharge looks awesome
I don't know if adding Yuumi is a good idea.
Am I seeing things or barley looks diffrent in the mico hypercharge showcase?
rip throwers
#SantaStu
2:27 wait di barley got walking animation remodel
I think it would be fun if we had the choice to switch between Laury and Lawry. Just like how eve can switch her attack pattern by equiping star power. So it would be cool if we had the sp.
Do you know how much is for kit?
The free side of pass is terrible, why they added random stardrops , random always will give you rare or superrare drops they should have made it coins or gems so it would actually be called good
Barley got a remodel to we can see it when they present Mico
I feel like we need more rare’s or super rare brawlers man… there’s at least over 11 mythics now
Mortis Mythic Gear: The speed of bats is increased by 50% (watched it at 0.25x speed)
the new brawlers are cool and all but did no one notice the new barley animations
It wasn’t bugged. The healing was working. The numbers just didnt show.
I know one of micos star power I think because u see bottom of micos ammo is look likes a mortis long dash but it isn’t when the thing is charged and u jump at a enemy u steel 33% of  enemy’s ammo or 1 ammo
I always wondered why Barley was moving like that while showing off Mico's hypercharge
Is it me or am I the only one who thinks the cartoon spike came straight up from Powerpuff Girls🤣🤣🤣
i just got lola skin from legendary star drop and brawler
The heal didnt work when mico jumped on meg cause mico was at full health
17:13 it reminds me of the devil in cupheads though
Can’t wait for the random mortis mates that are trying to do 1v5
Is it just me or does barley look *different* ? 2:33
2:19 what happened to barley 💀💀
All of them are like throwers or are similar
omg i just realized that there's star drops as every other reward in the brawl pass ;-;
2:36    Sandy: am I a joke to you?
Final Boss Rico is Jock Stu's identical twin.
Furrys r taking over
nobody talking about the new walk animation
#santastu
Man that Piper and Collete skin 💀💀💀💀💀
Bs is becoming like fortnite
Did barley get a remodel 😢 ?
We are all going to become randoms who either move or attack but not both at the same time with these colette and piper skins💀💀💀💀
Hi kairos, I was wondering if the brawl pass plus would be 7 + 10$/£  or if it would just be 10$/£?
Now I gotta carry 4 people instead of 2, oh no💀
Idk if it was a bug or its a feature but when bull hits the playeable bot brother (don't know the name), your brother received the dmg instead of you 6:51
To be honest, the best brawl talk of the year
5 Edgars vs 5 Edgars
#Santastu
best update in a while, so excited for jan 4th
I can't wait for 5v5, it's gonna be the best thing ever!
Thank god I stopped playing this garbage
Can we also remove the trophy requirement for replays pls
I don’t know if this is a known fact  but if u click on the camera in the brawl stars lobby, you ´re taken to a pretty strange star park surveilance room…
#suntastu
KAIROS YOU HAVE A WIFE
“I’m gonna speculate how much a skin will cost based on how cool it is “ and that’s very accurate 💀
nobody gonna talk about why barley walking so zestily?
Okay,kit laching onto a teammate and doing 4k damage is obviously an attention grabber and it's obviously getting Nerfed 1 week after players had the chance to buy him and use him
Is it Laurel or Yanny
Barley is getting a revamp too you can in the micro clips
Larry and Lawrie looks really fun I kinda wish you play Lawrie imagine you have a chance to spawn as Lawrie like 50/50 chance you can get Lawrie but Larry's attack is super interesting
when is darrly  hyper charge coming?
For gem grab 5v5 I suggest when a Brawler dies, the gems shouldn't just fall at the place but burst out and spread a Lil like Mike's gadget
#SantaStu
Larry very similar to Barley?  Again? I mean during Willow released back then you say the same thing. Her projectiles just the same as Barley😂Btw his Super twin is a bot, thats why he can auto dodge and back and forth any attacks.
Anybody else notice barley getting a remodel? (1:59)
Toxic teammates send you thumbs down👎  You as Kit latched onto him "Errr... Okay thank btw"😅
Eliminating brawl pass to buy with gems is the only thing I feel sad about ...although as he said it's a buff overall , but tbh it's really unfair gor F2P players 😔😔
Collette skin looks like ram and rem from re:zero
2:35 Kit the first ever legendary support brawler?? How about Sandy???
5v5 is gonna be chaotic rn
How is this on trending?
Miko's star power is that he reloads one ammo when he jumps on two or more people
I dont understand… So is Kit the brawler you will get from the brawl pass or there wont be any brawler to get in the neww brawl pass??🤔
14:39  YouTuber be  like i got 100 trofies at once 😂😂
16:41 artists gonna have a field day w this one
i think i saw ram from re:zero
Cartoon spike is going to get banned in competitive just because people won't know its bit box. FYI this does happen in ither games
Surpercell tryna start some with them Collette and Piper skins 😭 #SantaStu
Bruh pin packs don't exist😢
I have an idea on Larry's gadget which is-Role Switcharoo-Larry can change to Laury for 10 seconds and play with him
2:08 wait look! Barely is getting a remotely!
I feel neutral towards Pinku and Midori Pawlette, but I really like Kiiru, since her color scheme looks like a reference to Alice and the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland
Ow mobile
r -t as a bomb
I had collected gems for next season and not used it in this season but as the new update says we cannot buy it using gems .  Can anyone tell me if I should use my gems for this season or not?
he: Everybody's slipping around all the time. my brain:💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
DUDE I BOUGHT SHARKTOOTH COLT ONLY TO FIND OUT THE DAY AFTER THAT THERES A FREE AWESOME COLT SKIN 😭😭😭😭😭
I’m really starting to get tired of every single new brawler being mythic. The only non-mythic we’ve received in the last year (excluding cromatics) is Hank.
Wake up, Kairos uploaded! Its gonna be a good day!!!
Fang mains hoping to get fang hypercharge🔥🔥🔥  👇
I just realised that in the 5v5 wipeout has slippery tiles 💀
The 14th is my birthday!
#SantaStu
1:05 barely getting a re-model 😊
Hey Kairos, Please Let Us Know What We Should Do With Our Chromacredits, Credits (From Mastery Road As Well) Etc Whenever You Do A Brawl Pass+ Comparison Video In Future
2:35 why does barley walk like that
Why isn't kit in a trio with gray?
and I can't wait to get my hands on him💀💀
I'm predicting a Willow buff
Brawl pass and plus gonna be super expensive if compared to the progression it's rewarding the player.
It'll increase the overall match time which player will soon be getting fatigued of playing, but it'll be fun and I'm not seeing it being permanent mode in the game. Might become rotational event.
I hope you are ready for edger apocalypse 2.0
Do i need to login everyday to collect the brawlidays rewards?
Can you tell us what is the best way to spend gems.
Will the brawl pass skins be exclusive or will be available in shop in a later time?
Edgar will probably be going up in kairoses tier lists
Sandy, A legendary support brawler.
Barley got a rework Look the Brawl talk
i just noticed that barely has a new idle animation. Possible hidden revamp?
Mico is legit just Doomfist from Overwatch
i just noticed that barely has a new idle animation. Possible hidden revamp?
Kairos simping for cholette, yet he has a wife
2:26 i just noticed barley walks differently
Barley has a new walk animation!!!
Did you guys notice that barley looks different
Yo i think Kit only heals allies when he has health missing cause he was also healing 520 and after he  is fully healled the ally he's on also stops healling. when the kit attached to the meg he was already full hp so he the healling didn't start
Does anybody notice how the Barley walks weird? It might be a remodel
College and piper skins are weird…
Barly ia getting a rework!
Barley remodel
Kairos: "Kit, the first ever legendary support brawler." Sandy: "Seems I like I don't exist anymore.. Zzzzzzzz"
#SantaStu
Nintendo switch larry and Lawry is awesome. I heard brawl stars is on PC now so im thinking its coming to switch soon
Why brawl start doing this bullshit...OG players don't need hyper charge and gadgets all new brawler is mix up of old brawler these new brawler basic attack is more powerful than old brawler they contains very special ability in their basic. What we don't need them instead of making mix up brawler they should remove hyper charge and gadgets so they can make good unique brawler
oh no yumi from lol
THEY GAVE MY BOY DYNA A HYPERCHARGE L:ETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
at 0:40 wtf is barley walking
❤
There's so much come I can't imagine anything ❤
I hope we have some 5v5 exclusive modes. And i cant get over how cool the hypercharge art always looks. With the white eyes and all. That should be a dang banner or smth.
Wukong Niko is the new valorant skin bundle finisher 15:50
The mythic gear for mortis increases bat speed by 50% (you can see this if you slow down the video)
At 0:45 barley runs differently
I wish you could swap beteeen larry and laury as like a super or something. Like when u spawn laury is already following you and your super lets u swap between the brothers. Idk tho it just sounds so much more fun
Kit has to be the most a** brawler I have ever seen, I thought poco was trash but i stand corrected 😂,and as an insult to injury it's a an effin legendary brawler
Why barrly looks like that? 2:10
i am GETTING that colette skin if its the last thing i ever do
Barley remodel?!??
CCTV Poco is more like Miguel from the COCO
#chromanomore
For one frame in the brawl talk, you could see the top of the morris gadget description, and it says, “the speed of bats increased by 50%”
How will f2p players able to unlock those brawl pass skins, will they be limited like other brawl passes or we can unlock them after a certain period of time ?
MICO STEAL AMMO
This is kairos talk
Finally not a good skin for Janet and for god skin for others
Ik oj is going to try and cheese the 5v5 maps
Hey kairos , there are a couple of frames that show mico getting free ammos using his recharge bar; i think that what is the bar for 1:09
no classic skin this year?
How do you get the pin?
Finally crow hypercharge💥🎇
I noticed that mico has a red bar and it makes him attack twice
miko=doomfist
When will my sprout get a skin '-'
Too op the new brawler
did anyone notice that if you touch the cctv cameras in homescreen, it takes us into camera room?
GET READY FOR THE MICOPOCALYPSE!
Kit being released is something we have been waiting for for years super excited for this! Remember when he was announced (kinda) during Starr force brawl talk?
YO WHAT IS THAT BARLEY RUN ANIMATION  YUCKKKKK
Did anybody else see barley's goofy walk now lol
Wow wasn’t it like 2 years ago When everyone was thinking kit would come out
Lex put 4.5 brawlers😢😢
Imagine using Lawrie and Larry or Mr.P in 5v5 🙂🙃
Now Brawl Star have way too much Mythic Brawlers
Mico's Star Power: His Star Power charges up (like Mortis') and when he lands an attack he instantly reloads one ammo.
I feel sad and happy at the same time because i want to unlock all croma brawlers but i also want mico :/
IM SO EXITED FOR MAID CAT COLLETE :3
# SantaStu rivera??
Calling the L duo 1.5 or 2 brawlers is like calling Nita 2 brawlers. Like, it's not because they gave it a different name that it is less of a spawner than any other spawner (Yes, I forget the name of the L duo)
Isn't Sandy technically a legendary support brawler as well?
The speed on the bats is 50%
Kairos’s laugh never getss old😂
Yo why does the gift say 22 mythic brawlers
Sandy’s a support😂
I’m curious if Larry and Lawrie have completed R-T trio’s since it’s technically 3 people even though it’s only 2 brawlers (and if another brawlers is added then it won’t be a trio since a trio is 3 and it would have 4)
Fang is getting a hypercharge? Guess I’m never switching off Charlie ever again
ayeeee mom can i get doomfist  mom : we got doomfist at home doomfist at home = miko
What is the power league skin for the season in February
Hello Im nick and I am wanneimg that the brawl pass how it will work so the 6.99 brawl pass  right do I pay 10 dollars  with the 6.99 or will they have an opshin  to buy the brawl pass plus for 10 dollars
Hei Kairos, det var veldig hyggelig å treffe deg på World finals i Jönköping. Elsker Brawl stars YouTube videoene dine 👍
DID ANYONE ELSE SEeThAt At 2:03  The barley walk animation omg
I think Laury is keeping brawlers at the edge of his range. Probably acts like a bot in game play.
okay but kit is literally just yuumi from league of legends. attaches to teammate? check. attacks change while attached? check. A CAT???? check.
So we jus gonna ignore how difformed barley looked in mico's gameplay?
Tbh if you can swap between larry and laury that would be cool, i would suggest by getting the super a second time
E
Does anyone know when this update will come out?
#santastu
U can see at 2:26 that barley got  reanimated as well I’m pretty sure.
I figured out what it is that’s making me less interested in the game lately, besides the removal of siege. There is always a new game breaking feature and it’s just too much. The meta always revolves around what’s new. This game was great because of the interesting characters, lore and balance and now it’s just rushing to get the new OP ability. Playing against Charlie and Colette every game isn’t fun and there are brawlers that you might not see in an entire week of play.
idk but at 1:06 the barley running kinda weird any idea?
Barley 😭
#santastu
The anime skin of this season are juste so crazy !!!!! Kawaii Colette is so cool and this skin of spike 🥲  I need it it's my favorite of all time
Look at barley run
You won’t be able to get Barley for free anymore by logging into supercell😭😭
WHAT ABOUT FANG 😔😔😔
2:28 kairos!!! you forgot Sandy :(
#SantaStu
They also changed barleys running animation
Crow can now shred the boss bot so hard.
I love brawl stars, It's one of my favourite games, but the blatent copying of other games characters e.g. kit functions in a similar way to yuumi from league, lou is similar to mei from overwatch (especially with his ice block gadget), cordelius is similar to mordekaiser from league,  meg is Dva and so on, I'd really like to see new brawlers consistently having mechanics we've never seen in gaming.
I feel Larry and Lawry should be a super rare because they don’t have a really unique ability. They just spawn an npc like Bruce but more advanced. This is where the super rare rarity comes from.
#santastu
Larry and Lawry have awful designs im sorry
#starrtoon🎉
Brawl stars really know what they’re doing with that collette skins being in the brawl pass
Sooo,can anyone tell now what's the best place to spend the gems as a f2p player!?
how many euros will the brawl pass plus cost instead of dollars?
Please kairos continue brawl theiry there's so much stuff going on right now it's so worth it please
seems like kit heals his tm8 when he is also healing. so when he is at max hp, he doesnt heal tm8?
The colt skin!!🥵🤯 holy that’s so cool
0:14 why is barley running like that 😭😭
Dynas hyper charge is totally whack. Dyna is my main, and only time I see the hyper charge being anything significant is in hotzone. In some instances brawlball but most of the time it’s not going to make no change.
Ngl, this new update seems super fun!
15:57 I do like that skin too I wish I can buy it lol
Yo Kairos, I’m an exclusive content creator for Stu! Hope I can win the giveaway! #SantaStu
Well I guess I will have only one choice being a poco main and no brawl pass to buy...(also being free to play player)
Will the collette skin ever be gems, or will it only be available during that month?
Final boss rico has got cuphead written all over it.
We will be progressing faster? Honestly... how? Just tell us how this is a major buff. For every 1600 tokens earned, which translated into 160 coins, 64 PP and 32 credits... you are now getting maybe only 100 tokens for a drop or probably a rare and even if it is super rare... it is a MASSIVE downgrade.
Holy crap the skins this upcoming updates are one of the bests ones they’ve released yet, really creative, and I’m getting that blue hair Colette cat maid skin
Fun Fact:Mico Super looks like  doomfist while he’s in the air during his ult
Fun fact kit from ukrainian in translate is cat
Kits healing isnt bugged on meg, it just isnt showing the healing numbers while attached to her. You can see Meg attacking and her health bar still being healed
I love every single hypercharge and have all of thoose brawlers maxed and am going to buy every hypercharge
Anti virus 8 bit and anti virus 8 bit it doesn't makes sence 17:57
Cant wait for clips of Mortis 5v1 teamwipes. You can insta recharge ur super unless they change it.
Larry gonna be broken in heist
Hear me out, guys. 😭 That Piper skin 💀😭 and them Colette skins 😭
Is the fact that the new support brawler is named kit a pun?
I was hoping on a 5vs5 showdown (whenever u die ur out )🥲
Of course these are my views but i just thought it might be helpful for some people:  Timestamps: >Until 0:14 - Introduction >0:14 - Mico >2:35 - Kit >5:51 - Lorrie and Larry >9:16 - Mortis >9:30 - Brawlidays info >9:49 - 5v5 >11:19 - Brawl pass >14:31 - Random Changes >15:22 - Skins  New changes: >9:48 - why does it look like that offer is for coins? >Mortis new gear looks pretty good and potentially easier to play for newer players. However with such a big update I am surprised only one mythic gear is being released. > I am not sure how the new season length/brawl pass length of time is like so I am not commenting on that. >If the brawl tokens name is being changed to xp, why is 'chromatic' skins instead of colourations or varieties; its just that the main purpose of the word chromatic is being removed yet it is still there. >Changing 'tokens' to 'XP' does make more sense for new players >The ability to - I believe - favourite skins looks good, particularly for saving up for a skin you like.  >Personally, I don't love star drops but it does look like they are a bigger end of season reward than at the moment. >I'm not commenting on any skins as they are all subject to personal opinion. >Win streaks seem good, a bit like showdown plus but without being primarily showdown. >New modifiers and more weekend events look fun however noticeably this and the last season we have seen less and less challenges.  New brawlers: >Mico looks strong but may be overrated because of the reload speed. Also I think his super recharges after hitting up to 3 enemies which is interesting in termes of chaining. >Kit looks overpowered for obvious reasons, and I think very fun. >Although the Larry thing is like barely, he looks to have a fast movement speed which along with his  super may make him be able to be played a lot more aggressively than all the current throwers. We also don't know whether Lorrie will stay alive or not like Lola's turret after Larry has been killed. The AI of Lorrie looks interesting, a lot more like a bot player than Nita'ss bear too.  Hypercharges:  >Edgar - a weak hypercharge however depending on how played the ability to chain supers attacks and this may mean chaining the hypercharge as well looks very strong. >Leon - Very good, also fits well with the mythic gear. >Mico - Strong, as are most stun abilities. >Fang - The popcorn gadget does 500 damage so I assume its the same, the hypercharge going through walls also looks strong. >Crow - Super can be used a lot more aggressively with the hypercharge now. >Dynamike - very strong, like you said very hard to dodge. >Overall looks like each hypercharge will be a free teamwipe.   5v5: >Wipeout looks the best in my opinion as less communication is required between players, especially if playing with randoms. >Brawl ball could be very interesting, there will probably be a wider goal, the fact that it reminds me very much like playing duo showdown could be something. BB might be a bit of a failure as it is a gamemode arguably more skilled than others and as players cant communicate it could become  very chaotic. >Gem grab looks like a mix of hot zone and showdown in how it may be played; having multiple zones on an extra wide map is almost like separate games at once  Brawl pass: I am not writing much/going into much detail for this as my opinion will take too long, but here are a few things: >The 20% progression on the brawl pass+ may be interesting. This could be in s similar form as  when a player gets back into the game after being offline for a couple of weeks - instantly upgrading random brawlers to slightly higher levels. It could also be making upgrading or the number of credits required for a select few brawlers cheaper or giving them away for free.  Sorry for spelling errors and of course I could add more detail for most things but it is long enough already, thanks for reading. :)
OH NO BRAWL STARS IS TURNING INTO ANIME FORTNITE NOOOOOO
Imagine stacking kits 😂
Barley got a new look? 1:59
You have to change the brawlers tier list
When you showed the super clip I just saw an old barley skin
Mico is just doomfist 😂
The question is what happens if you aim kits super at a empty space, will he just leap over there?
If you pause at the right frame it says Mortis bat buff gear is 50%
I will definitely save my gems for Toon Spike because the skin is so GOOD! It's better than any legendsry skin, like spike is so cute, his eyes and how he looks walking in a match is JUST SO GOOD
Anyone else see barley during the mico hypercharge bit?
Best battlepass in my opinion number 1 reason: TOON SPIKE number 2 reason: TOON SPIKE NUMBER 3 REASON: TOON SPIKE
Kairos I think I found something important for the lore of brawl stars
they need to chill with these game breaking brawlers
I'm pretty sure it did heal the meg robot as you see it health go up before she starts to naturally heal. meaning it just didn't show up and green numbers.
IM SO GETTTING TOOON SPIKE 100% , ITS THE BEST SPILE SKIN BEST SKIN IN GAME
tokens>
Just asking will the brawl pass skin be available for purchase with gems or bling eventually?
G I M M E    A   C O D E    R I G H T    N O W     I    N  E E D    A    G O L D E N    C O D E
Rule 34 Artists galore!
#SantaStu
We not gonna talk about how Barley unlocked the ninja animation in Roblox? (2:05)
Did dynamite the imo strongest thrower have to get a hyper charge?
Don’t know where else to say this but s.p.u.d.e is written down in the security room in the whole time anomaly thing
It also looks like for Mico, when his bar is charged, he either takes ammo from the brawlers he hits, or he just straight up just gains an ammo bar
I feel like Kit is gonna be broken when on the back of a teammate and should only be able to use 3 ammo before hopping off or reduced damage
did anyone see barley walks
If the Frank skin doesnt say "Heheheha" "Grrr" and the others, thats a missed oprotunity
At 3:46 he hops onto Nani and then off really fast and this might show that the way to get off is by maybe activating a super again or getting damaged
For the brawler coming to rt family I think u should be able to chose who I controle
if doom fist was in brawlstars lmaoooo
Colette and piper skin is my most favorite to buy
mortis mythic gear is 50% faster
Hey KT dont know if you noticed but the brawl pass is shortened too 50 tiers
We will get a barley skin old barley
I think Larry and his brother there should be a gadget where u switch people and u become the brother and the brother becomes u
Kit being the 1st legendary support brawler huh. As an og sandy user who played him first day first legendary i got, i feel very offended by this support legendary since there is no way sandy is a controller without his rude sands sp or exhausting storm gear
seeing mico is like doomfist could be cool
Wait guys since brawl pass is one month that means 6 hyper charges every month that means 72 a year
Wait can I get the Colette skin outside of the brawl pass???
I don't really like collette skin tbh.
Poco quadruple tank😂
Sandy was the first legendary support brawler
mico also had a hypercharge
Holy hell, I love that Colette skins so much! I am instantly purchasing that as soon as its available! 💖
Mico’s first star power probably make him take ammos off of enemies when the bar you see in the clips is fully charged, you can see it in many moments actually
The mortis gaget says that the bat's speed increase with 50% from what i've heard.
The 2 robots are basically Jacob & Esau from TBOI
Is it just me or Kairos keep changing form
Can't wait for toon spike 😂
Barley remodel?!
Were those bombs next to the unbreakble walls?
Mico looks like he has a star power where he charges a bar which reloads his ammo when he hits a jump.
14:56 They removed Shelly bandaid 😭😭
You don’t get the “Unlocking of skins of locked brawlers” being a horrible change, this change alone just made stardrops horrible, the percentage of obtaining skins in mythic to legendary drops is insane. By having a bigger pool of 29 gem skins to pull within a star drop makes the chances of obtaining the other useful drops such as hyperchaeges and star powers decrease.
Be funny if Larry and Laurie have a Star power where they swap places (Larry will be the spawnable). Idk if that’ll be very good but it’s an interesting idea
I hope that larry will have a gadget, to swap that controll to his brother, and rewerse.
2:08 anyone else noticed the barley skin
It would be soo cool if brawl stars had a MOBA 5v5 mode
dude you finally acknowledged the existence of cctv!!!
Brawl stars brought in meteor strike 😂
So we get a yummi warwick hybrid as a character. I dont care about the warwick part, wolf is cool but yummi is a tumor and anything that resembles yummi in any game deserves to be put in alcatraz
Mico first star power is...  When he he hits an enemy with his first ammo it will restoret
6:07 When brawl stars is trying to be creative
I bought brawl pass, i want activate it in the new season, do i get bp+ or bp?
New brawl pass on my birthday wooh thx brawlstars for my birthday present
I said it once and I’m going to say it again Kairos is the man for giving us the info we need after the brawl talk. Man I love Kairos best brawl stars YouTuber
Will you be able to buy Virus 8bit again?
Sandy is support too
I guess that i might grind 2 days of power league like i did for maisie...
ANIME SKIN HYPE
Why did they remove Shelley’s Band-Aid?
The new barley animations are 👌 00:40
now im curious, if kit jumps onto a edgar that's on your team and they jump, can they take you with them? if so then that's just crazy
NEED POCO SKIN!
ok the APOCALYPSE started USE THE SECRET BRAWLER HAHAHAHAHAHAHA MICO KIT GET CLOSE TO ME I WIL- AHHHHHHHH BOY THAT SUPER SUPER AHHH
MICO IS FUCKING DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTT
Who else noticed that Barley walked WAY differently
Is it me or barley got a remodel aswell?
Always a flex to say that my birthday is on the 24th of december. Thnx Brawl stars for a cool skin on my birthday 😌
Hey Kairos try clicking on the camera in the lobby.
I’m actually so happy for the change!! I think the game is gonna  be even more fun now!
I Deadass predicted the fang one and crow
Barley movement is no normal
For anyone who knows, kit is giving me comfey from pokemon unite vibes in terms of gameplay
Only thing i am worried about is if i will be able to buy that collete skin
3:22 I thought someone came into my house. I live alone.
Is it just me, or does Final Boss Rico look like the devil from Cuphead
IMAGINE MICO IN GEM GRAB.
why is barley running like that LMAOO
18:20 honestly w edgar wouldve been a better fit or add edgar in otis' trophy cup
We got a barley remodel too
#SantaStu
I love that Jessie skin sm 🥺 def gonna save my gems for it!!
We can see on the Mico's gameplay a symbol near the brawlers he hits that resembles the recharging shots, so that probably means there may be a starpower that takes ammo from enemies...
Me thinking ill finally get crow next year Kit revealed  Me:Here we go again Also how did they mess up colette even more
Kit actually healed Megs Mecha, but it wasn‘t shown. If you pay attention you can see her constantly gaining 740 Hp in various ticks which isn‘t her regular regeneration, you can compare them 2s later as megs gains an uneven amout of health back. :)
Kit is like yuumi from league of legends 💀
I got a question about the brawl pass:  Do we have to buy the brawl pass to buy the brawl pass plus or can we just go straight to the brawl pass plus just like in clash royale?
I think i noticed that a Star Power in Mico is that the bar that charges, when he lands an attack and hits someone, it charges 1 bar of ammo
If micos bar is full and he hits a target he instantly reloads an ammo :)
The 5v5 feels just like showdown or basketbrawl, I would of like it if it was just the 3v3 maps but 5v5
YOOOO IM SO EXCITED FOR 5V5 LOOKS SO FUN
Pretend this comment is funny
Edgar about to be even stronger than in world finals. Also i saw ram in the brawl talk and i thought we were gettim remz 😮‍💨 wouldve been perfect
Someone needs to hire kairos for brawl talk
Now that staar drops are being added into the brawl pass, woudnt it be better to just have boxes again? Idk, but I miss boxes
when mico's bar below the ammo bar is full, his next attack recharges 1ammo. think this a star power
I love how Kairos actually sat down and thought about what type of tickets will a character in a mobile game use
Did i only notice barley walking weird?
God save us from these new Hypercharges 💀🙏
THEY PUT YUUMI INTO BRAWL STARS WTF
2:27 wait.. barley might be getting a rework, see his model?
so nobody is talking about season 23? year of the dragon at 12:03
This isn't even brawl stars anymore it's stars brawl
The final boss rico skin reminds me of the game cuphead
Nobody its talking about Barley,in Mico presentation .
For a split second you can actually see that mythic gear for mortis does increase bats speed for 50%
Day 1 of asking Kairos to give me toon spike without further questioning
Yo new pass starting 2 days before my bday, can’t wait I’m def buying it😆
Kairos i saw barley new walking animation style did you see that?
One of the star powers should be that Larry can switch attack pattern with the other
Is it just me or does Doll Jessy looks creepy af......
There is no way im not buying the next Brawl Pass
Gotta play collote and piper with one hand noe tho😅
You can see how when Edgar activates his hypercharge, he doesn't get the reload buff. Only when he jumps with his super he starts having the red effect (sign of a reload speed buff like Bull's 1st star power and Meg's 2nd gadget)
So hyped for Mico!!! I already have enough stuff to completely max him out plus hyper charge!!!!!!!
Isn't it weird how Fang's Hypercharge can go through walls and Colt's Hypercharge can't break Unbreakable Walls I know that "break unbreakable walls" might sound stupid, but this is the least thing they can do to Colt's Hypercharge in order to make it NOT JUST BIG. And we all know Colt is a high skill brawler and he won't be broken or anything. we don't even get that much of Hypercharges per game. Give my boy Colt some love
This is a lot to take it in, and I want it all.
Ruffs and kit supporting a meg boutta go hard
i'm guessing antivirus 8-bit is a lunar new year skin, will it be available permanently or only during the lunar new year thing? or every lunar new year or a different schedule?
did someone notice a funny running barley?
Doomfist from overwatch literally
At 10:23 u can see that u need more gems than 10 in 5v5 mode
The movement of barley is a little off when they show micos hypercharge
Kairos: “Next we have kit, the first legendary support brawler” Sandy: “Am I a joke to you..?”
Anddd this might means that you can continue eating until i get series
I think it was a missed opportunity to make it to where if you gain your super again with Larry, using it you would be able to switch to Laurie and play as Laurie until you switch back. Switching would make Larry turn into the AI
LOVE the update!
Nobody noticed that micos bar gave him ammo
I'm confused with the brawl pass... Soo if you buy brawl pass + you get 2 months worth of stuff or 1 month worth of stuff? For example if I buy brawl pass + do I get both collete and kit skins? 😅
They really added Yuumi to Brawl Stars lol
#SantaStu
Bro now I want the February brawl pass and the kitt skins
Wahoo! So excited
Oops he is
Nah what is up with that barley
Runing
2:00 minutes
Bro, is barley having a new animation for tuning?
So the Last member of RT's trio going to be Rik?
I think crows getting hypercharge
Kit is literally yumi from  league
''Mico is too op, he can hit everyone" *Mortis* :🙃
That's what I love in brawl stars  more than any supercell games every update is more exciting than the other, Fang + edgar + Leon hypercharges in the same update let's gooooooo!!!!!!
This is the craziest brawl talk yet
i was onestly surprised cause they're gonna give mico for free on my birthday
Are you kidding me?! The Frank skin is only obtainable through the supercell store? That sucks!
I call you League of Legends players, we all should have flashbacks seeing Kit
Kairos you are late Lex already made video of this and Lex gave more info
Who is the Brawler in Season 22? Cuz ik Season 23 is Kit I'm not sure 😅
Is frank coming to clash royale or smth?😅 Is that a teaser?
i know repeating mechanics or even copying them from other games is bound to happen. but kit is literally warwick + yuumi from league of legends. devs should try to get more creative.
This is such a hype update!
For once we actually got a good set of skins i havent bought new skins in a year so i am happy we got some good ones for now
Did anyone else notice Barley had his animations changed? During the time of 1:59 and beyond you can see it but you can’t see the change when a bit of barley is shown again. I was wondering if it’s a bug or if that’s his new animations
I watched it and it was AMAZING
IM SO EXITED! ive been playing the game for four years and this is by far one of the best updates
Mico the only jumper brawler
Anyone else notice barleys remodel?? Looking 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cat is straight up Yuumi from League
My main issue with this update is the Colette skin they decided to release. I don't understand why the dev team went with designing and releasing such a skin in a game made for children. Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining about the "anime aesthetic", but instead with portraying a minor(?*) as a catgirl. They could have released a cool anime protag skin on any brawler and it could have captured the anime vibe just as well. However, they instead went with this. I understand I might be overreacting; however, I do not approve of this skin at all.  Be that as it may, they also announced possibly the most fun skin ever: Toon Spike. Doll Jessie is really cool too :D   *My assumption is that she is underage seeing as how she is portrayed as having Esgar as her love interest who is confirmed to be a teen.   First impression with the brawlers:  I think Mico's gonna be broken lol. And isn't his super just Janet but way stronger? lol It will be super fun to blame your duo when playing Kit lolol I'm sure playing it with a friend will lead to hilarious moments L&L seem strong and I'm excited to play them
Is it just me, or is Barley getting a remodel?
Kit was healing Meg. It just didn't show that +520 hp thingie
UPDATE LOOKS AWESOME
According to me kit is similar to mickey mouse
I feel like the healing of kit is star power
Yessssss baby yessssssss finally best colt skin for free yessssss
It would be fun if it would be chosen randomly if you play Larry or Lawrie after respawn or joining a match 😀
am i the only one who noticed that barley has new walking and idle animation in the mico showcase part?
They nerfed crow enough so that he wasn’t super bad or good, just to add an insane hyper charge
Why did Supercell have to go from f2p players being able to purchase the season pass with gems to the same b******* passes you can by with Clash Royale? I understand what you are saying that they are buffing the normal f2p pass,but still, Supercell wants to force everyone into spending money. Anyway, still excited for a free brawler.
Sandy deserves a legendary skin 😡
I don’t care about anything else about this update i only care about kit and toon spike nothing else matters
Barely got a new walking animation.
Am i the only one who saw a barley remodel
2:06  Barley remodel? or Skin. Maybe Skin of classic brawler.
for mortis’s mythic gear i think dani shifted over and you could see it said 50% faster
Can you end Mico super early or do you have to wait the full time?
Now my crow is about to get maxed
2:37 Sandy: 😐
I saw that one of mico starpowers is that when you hit someone with that bar below the ammo fully charged, youremove 1 ammo and gain 1 ammo
Time to come on my opponents as a traditional naughty season
Piper skin sucks, what a waste of skin for such a good brawler
#SantaStu
Nah the Colette skins are wild 💀
Bruh what about sandy Give Sandy some love
the "animation" skins🤮🤮🤮 looks like fortnite
Looks like miko has an ammo reloading starpower
Why so many good spike skin I'm tired of buying every single spike skin like i skipped 2 seasons and lost my f2p title for him and if you think I'm gonna get toon spike  You are god damn right
Did anyone else notice the barley reskin
The mortis mythic gear is 50 percent extra speed, i saw in some way
0:12 they changed barleys animations
Wait, so we won’t be able to use bling after this season ends?
I so hope Anti-Virus 8-Bit's name is changed. It looks TOO much like the OG skin. Maybe something like ProtoVirus (prototype Virus) would work better
Don't understand why virus 8 bit is back.... I bought it because it was limited, kind of a scam
Me about to save my gems for that poco skin:
Bt1 or waseem
Why Barley is running?
The barley at 0:40😂
13:20 FURRY
Look at barely
why barley running like that?
No new RT skin 😢
What happened to barley in 02:03
I wonder what happens if kit is on a teammate brawler and they use mobility super Like for instance Nani or charging bull with kit or can Piper fly with kit on her
Frank skin need the king laugh pin
It seems like you need more gems in 5v5 to start the countdown
What happened to bling tho
Kairos you are the best youtuber❤❤❤
Shelly remodel👎 Barely remodel 👍
13:47 The CoC team does it with some of the heroes in higher TH, for example if you bought the Gold Pass and you are TH 11, and the hero skin is for the Royal Champion, that skin will be in stock for when you reach TH 13.
It’s been a long time we didn’t get a good update like that
It sounds like a nerf for the small percentage of people like me who save all gems but always get the brawl pass with 5dollars every other pass
#SantaStu
I noticed that when Miko got a kill with the purple Barr fully charged he gained one ammo
We are still trying to nerf Charlie, and now kit will be the new INSANELY broken brawlers
That college skin makes brawlstars another game
Heist with Kit and Chuck combo is going to be terrifying!
14:56 he literally doesn't know
Colette the wife
I think kit actually just increases healing and it doesnt show, the 520 heal was from emzs star power
I’m soo glad win streaks is coming because sometimes I just login and get my daily tasks and 200 coins. There be few times I wanna play longer for trophy rewards I’m super excited for this much needed feature
I'm probably not going to play this season because of Edgar hypercharge
2:25 bro why is barley like this
1:58, look at the barley! what is that
and they should also make it so that you can purchase skins from previous brawl passes or just pick any brawl pass season
"Kit: the first ever legendary support brawler" *Cries in Sandy*
Kit is going to be TERRIFYING IN DUOS
so yuumi got into brawl stars too
Nobody gonna mention barley movement
Hi Kairos  I gave you like 2 cents by using your code.K-A-I-R-O-S In the brawl stars shop hey
#Chromanomore
#santastu
Can't wait to play Kit. Also very exciting changes coming.🙂
New Spike skin is just INSANE!!!
Kit and collete skins will come back in 2025?
Will datk lord spike return?
I don't get it! Free play accounts can't buy the brawl pass with James?
is it just me who sees barley like an old mas 2:26
Larry and Lawrie will be goated in showdown
bro i was saving up for mico to max him out and not i have to spend 10000 coins on fang and leon hypercharges
0:14 barley remodel
Kit reminds me of yumi from lol
#SantaStu
What is the price of the new brawl pass ??
#santa stu
Old barly skin
Sad that there wasn’t any old skin for one of the oldest brawlers (like Darrell(he could be called tequila bot Darrell (or something)))
I Guess it's time to get no life cuz thas update seems insane man
2:01 barley????
Cant wait for some 6yoshi9 colette fan art after this update! 😏
KAIROS the bats speed will be increased by 50 percent
Ima main Larry and laury
people quitting brawl stars after this 👇👇👇👇
Kit is getting released on my bday
Gonna be hard to play piper and collate without both hands
what if there was a gadget that let you switch between which bot you control
Everybody talking about collette and pipers skin, but im more into the poco skin. Ruggedly handsome for no reason.
watched it and this will be crazy gotta save my gems
healing “tara”
Why does barley look like that at 2:27 skin remodel confirmed
I am so scared about this toxic-mortiso-edgaro-pocalipse
at 2:23 why was the barly walking like that?
Edgar’s does change his super. He gets faster reload speed after using super
How much does the brawl pass cost?
A few months ago, I was admiring the Rogue Mortis skin in an offer in the shop for 99 gems, and I accidentally clicked the purchase button. I didn't want to buy the skin so that's 99 gems wasted. Is there any way I can contact Supercell and ask them to take away my skin and refund my 99 gems?
There were 3 mythic brawlers when I started playing. Seeing Mico’s unlock screen say “1/22 mythic brawlers” made me cry
I think mico will be a c tier brawler
Mico's star power is he rekordszámú an ammo after killing someone. You can see it in the video
Mico's star power is he rekordszámú an ammo after killing someone. You can see it in the video
Bruce but better
Barley remodel
Is no one gonna talk about the remodeled Barley in the Brawl Talk Gameplay?
Kairos I always wanted a heart from you but you didn't gave me :<
for a split second u can actually see the % of the speed increase of the mythic gear its 50%
OH GOD I WONT HAVE ENOUGH CREDITS FOR A GODDAMN MYTHIC AND LEGENDARY
#santastu
F2P progression is still really bad and this update did nothing about it. Supercell is distracting everyone from the problems of the game and it’s working
Quick question : will the new brawl pass have bling ? Before I used to get them from power league and the brawl pass now that it's real money I can't buy it so will they add it in the free pass ? Or buff pl to get more ?
Maybe it is just me but doesn’t it look like Barley got a new walking animation?
New OJ video idea: NEW SUPERCHARGE CHEESE WITH CROW IN HIEST
Mico is what I thought Edgar should have been
Ngl Larry and Lary is basically a Lola clone but a bit different
Kairos, do you know if previous brawl pass rewards are going to be automatically claimed? I’d be devastated if I didn’t have any saved up for kit
Spikes skin 😢😢😢(im f2p)
I realized Mico’s star power, its shenever he hits 2 enemy (maybe 3) he reloads. Because his reload speed is low and thats what happened in videos of him
One of the sp of mico probably takes enemies ammo when his bar loads up and the other does more damage is my guess with the footage
3:45 I think him healing himself was a star power, and he was healing Meg but the numbers weren't showing.
Could you imagine playing against kit and edgar in brawl ball? Kits on edgar, edgar passes to himself and jumps, then passes again and kit jumps onto that pass? And both of them have automatically charging supers? I think this is a great way to buff tanks.
barley's animation is different?
I know it isn't 100% accurate, but still..  FEMBOY COLETTE FEMBOY COLETTE FEMBOY COLETTE
I swear I saw micro steal ammo when he hit people. If that’s like a trait that would be really awesome on mortis
I remember like 2 years ago when everyone thought that kit was a space cat.
#SantaStu
Barley looks a bit different when walking
Mico is literally doomfist from overwatch its perfect I love m so much
so if i want a skin in the brawl pass like the kit skin i need to buy it for real money and for 2 more skins are for more money?
Did anyone see the barley moving like max?
Kit will change heist games. That damage while attached on a teammate is ridiculous.
1:04 Something missed, barley got a walking animation rework!! FINALLY!
THEY'RE REMODELING BARLEY  or atleast reanimating him
Mortis is a 50% speed buff
BRO LOOK AT THE BARLEY ANIMATION 1:05
When will the brawl a days thing start?
In 5v5 I hope they make it require more gems like 15
Why does barley look weird?
Sandy isn’t a support brawler?
I hope that when you are playing the new double brawler and when you have both brawlers on the map then using your super changes the brawler played by you It would be crazy but idk
Yall forgot about hunters coming to the game😕
Will the automatically collected credits from the bizarre circus pass and the one before that pass go towards Kit? I really hope so. Great video by the way
I have a question. Now I got all chromatic brawlers, should I convert the chroma credits I have into fame and get for each chroma credit two credits or wait until the update and get for each chroma credit 1.85 credit? I am afraid to wait after the update and then loose them while waiting for the new brawler to get released
Did anybody notice thet barley has a new movement
Is mariposa piper coming back
11:12 no nononononononono the darryl is slowed
Cant wait for that anime skin
16:38 Kairos be like: hear me out
2:30 did anyone even notice the barley re model???
Oh god yuumi is here
2:30 What happened to Barley💀
Where’s new kairos?
in first gamplay barly has a remodel
I'm still confused about credits. Are my saved credits going to go towards Kit when he drops?
The bats are actually 50% faster ! You could see it for a millisecond
new hypercharges are broken
I’m Brazillian, and when Dany say “Aqui é Brasil, po###”, he wanna say “Here is Brazil, f### yeah”
Is that a Barley remodel i see?!
Barley looks wird
Starr Park Security Cameras if you want to get info for Brawl Theory  https://youtu.be/Nr9sftaK_eA?si=w9faKhNnT-OyBeQP
Wasn’t sandy once classified as support?  UPDATE: it’s true. On the wiki it shows us that on 01/23/2020 Sandy was changed from a fighter to support. He was later reclassified again to controller, so kitt isn’t the FIRST legendary support, just the only current one.
I want  to watch you’re f2p 20# but you forced us to buy you’re merch and I cant cause I have no money😢😡😭
Hello!  Could you maybe make a trio video or spreadsheet lol please and thank you
Oh no 5v5 mortis and thumbs down and wtf piper and colette skin I think that 40 y old man are cona be ferry  happy
I can't wait to play all of this.
#SantaStu
Larry and Lawrie look awesome
O cant wait for mico and every new brawlers🎉
Deeem thes fire😂
His star power is once every 5 or 4 seconds maybe 3 he takes away enemys  ammo
i just realised.....is tahta  new animation for barley?
Nah as F2P player im exited about new changes but this season is little bit harder for me to not get pass cus these skin
I'm confused so you don't get kit from the brawl pass
Edgar fang Leon hypercharge…. Why!!!!!
They went so hard with this update
I think Kitt heals depending on how much health the brawler has in total
Am i the only one that thinks there is something wrong with barley?
"First legendary support brawler" Sandy before his category got changed: anyways this is my favorite update BY FAR, i can't wait for kit to drop    why is sandy a controller anyways? he feels much more like a support imo
0:40 secret barley remodel/animation????
It's my 18th bday today and this might be the best present ever thx brawlstars ✨💚
Kairos what do you think of having hotzone points stop filling up if both teams are on it. Like you can only fill it up if you or any of your team members are on it alone without the enemy team on it. I feel like it would be funner and more strategic.
Hey, Kairos! I think it's time to make a video on Clash Mini on your second channel since there's been a huuuuge update. Still looking forwart to it!
Cool
‏‪1:58‬‏ what happened to barly Sorry if I misspelt his name
#SantaStu
Kit seems like yuumi from league but deals DAMAGE
I’m kinda desperate, Jock stu is too expensive so plz #santastu
This update is gonna be insane Im so hyped
I honestly am very disappointed that BP road star drops will all be rng besides the last one, I feel as if setting them to certain rarities would be better for progression even though it would take away from the experience of opening them
Kairos if you don't let me win I will stalk you and your family
IDK WHY BUT LARRIE AND LAWRIE REMEMBERS ME OF MIME AND DASH 💀
YESSSSSSS DYNAMIKENHYPERCHANRGEGEGEUDXJFJ
Rare star drop isn’t any better
This is what brawl stars needs, this update seems so polished and like a whole new fresh experience I can’t wait for 5v5
17:23 That's exactly what I thought!
what's up with cats being attached to teammates like league has yummi now we have kit
I don’t like that they removed the face bandaid on Shelly
I am so Excited for Kit, they look so good. Hopefully they don't get the 'New Legendary' Treatment and become terrible a year later.
If you slow down the brawl talk, it says that it increases Mortis's bats speed by 50%!!!
wasn't sandy a support before the controller role was added or am i just trippin?
That collette skin 😍😍
Larry’s aa the first explosion is the fine and the second explosion is the rise in insurance
What rarity is larry'lawire?
I NEED the Spike and the Poco skins ASAP
At 9:34 what is that offer on the left? 500 gems ?
Kairostime,when will you make a brawl theory video please,PLS also great content
1:04 new barley walking animation looks sick
I believe fang pop corns do 2880 as eve took 2 of these dmg while fang main attack did 3264. I might be wrong but it seems to me. Paused at 8:25
when does it release?
Shellys remodle is so cute, i wish they kept the bandaid tho
1:10 in the video you can see that miko have full amo with a bar up and then he jumps on the other bralwer and reacharches hi amo directly!
#santastu
Imagine how much fan art there will be when the piper and Colette skins release
Bro why does barley walk so goofy El primo broke his back or smth?💀💀
#santastu🗣️🗣️
Why barely run like that💀
The collete, Piper and spike skins are AMAZING!!!!!!
Bro what is wrong with braleys run?
randomly asking - am I the only one who haves missing prizes to collect from the championships? (the bat pin)
Alternativ skin in the future for colt will be a "Realistic depiction of an Angel Colt".
3:33 It's not that the healing is inconsistent; Kit heals a flat percentage of the brawler's max hp every second.  The "inconsistency" is Meg's natural health regeneration.
Dani Mario Frank please increase free pass gems to 150 gems free to player to purchase one legendary skin 2secend pass
I have credits saved from 2 brawl pass seasons and no all brawlers unlocked (except pearl), will they get automatically added to KIT's unlock progression on jan 4 after the auto collect happens?
By the way, if you slow the bt down you can see that mortis’s gear speeds up his bats by 50%. I hate mortis but i hope this helps!  Edit: COLETTES MY FAVORITE BRAWLER AND IM GOING FERAL OVER HER NEW SKIN AHHHHHHHHH
Looks like barley got a new running animation
Honestly, I bought certain skins because I thought they were not going to be available EVER again. Seeing recolors of these legendary skins are super unfair.
Love all that is happening but keeping Pawlette behind a paywall is Supercell cuking F2P players
16:52 its obviously a Ram skin
My guess is that kit doesnt heal megs mech but meg herself.
Me being a free to play
why does barley look like that 2:11
9:20 in the brawl talk video There is a couple frames that show the speed Increase for the bats and it's by 50%
Im free to play but im getting the brawlpass for the Colette skin😂
Idk how I feel about this update, it’s both great and awful
1:04 2:12 anyone notice barleys animation?
A lot of skins will be legendary (i can see it by the killing animation)
#SantaSTU
Kairos be acting sus 💀 Overall, this update seems really great, outside maybe some unique, mechanically suprising hypercharges, and new brawlers seem fun. Can't wait to see miko's abilities breakdown!
Btw! Mortis’ new gear increases his super’s speed by 50%
Love your vids❤❤❤
Anyone notice barley walking animation is different??
I think that the snow/ice will possibly replace the speed/slow tiles from the map maker, sothat they fit into the environment better.
So do you have to buy the brawl pass and then you can buy the brawl pass plus or could you just buy the brawl pass plus
How does spike keep getting dope skins
They took away brawl boxes in the brawl pass, but now they're putting star drops in, which are very similair
Micos first star power allows him to instantly reload a shot when the bar is full
P2W
This ice climber rt looking- HYPE
Kit on Knockout💀
Let's gooooo this is so cool
Meg was being healed by kit, the healing numbers just didn’t appear
Could you buy kit with credits?
#Santa Stu
Just a quick fix, there is a frame in the brawl talk where you can see mortis's gear speeds up bats by 50%. Great video Kairos!
In the case of Larry and Laurie they should do that if you use your super while Laurie is on field you’d swift the controls to lawrie and if Larry dies you get to play as lawrrie till you get your super back and get Larry on field that’s such a cool thing to do
They ned add daryl skins
I liked this wonderful brawl talk on my birthday, it really made it better (it was pretty boring until now)!
8:53 looks like that dynamite launches him with dynajump
I rerely play spike but that skin looks so cool
mico's ult is like doomfist from overwatch 2's ult
Kairos,i have a question,will i need to buy the normal pass to have acces to buy the brawl pass + ?
Will u be able to purchase the Collette brawl pass skin later for bling?
“The first ever legendary support brawler”  Laughs in Sandy
My top hyperloads would be the following (in my opinion): top 6: Edgar only recharges his basics and ulti faster, plus to charge his hypercharge he needs to do damage, I think he's going to do something tedious. top 5: Leon is not a big deal but he is very subtle since it would be difficult to know from what position Leon would attack you when he was invisible, but I would have liked them to put him next to the enemy and not be detected.  Top 4: Fang is a good hyperload with a lot of potential, it passes walls and throws popcorn but there are better ones. top 3: very good dynamike, almost the same as massie, one of the best hyperloads. top 2: crow, this shit is going to be broken in a robbery, it will counter a lot of brawlers but from the looks of it, it seems easy to dodge so, I don't know. Top 1: mico, his hypercharge will literally turn a game around, you will be broken. (I remind you that it is my opinion of what I believe about being overloaded)
0:45 what is that barley walk animation lol
Dang Kairos confessing his love to the skin 😂💀
imagine Larry's 2nd star power being that you control Lourie and Larry is ai instead
What if the gadget for Larry that they can switch out for the other guy?
I wish that the BP+ skins will come back later
my guess is EL Quarterback will come out on the day of the next Super Bowl
Has no one else realized the Baley remodel
It would be cool if for Larry and Lawrie you are able to change perspectives using maybe a gadget of some sorts.
Anyone else notice barley's new animations
League of legends players are having flashbacks from Yuumi.  (It is a cat support champion that permanently attaches to an ally and can't be targeted and everybody wants her removed from the game)
#SantaStu
Mico feels super squishy
I feel like Larry and lawries gadget would make you switch between them
Okay my one question that I'd wanna know is I haven't collected trophy road stuff for like 15k should I collect before new update?
LOVE YOUR VIEDEOS
its not buff its nerf to f2p why are you care my game ı can buy brawl pass every 4 month i dont must skins.
2:16 What’s up with barley??
am i the only one who saw barly redizined?
#SantaStu
also it looks like barley is getting a remodel if you take a look at mico's gameplay clips
Bro why brawl star do like that I can't get college skin
No surge hyper charge 😔😔
Kit finally came, I wished he was added earlier since he was replaced by ruffs when we all tough cat brawler was announced but ruffs came This i hope mico won't broke brawl stars as Edgar did
Can we talk about how bling feels rarer tha gems like seriously f2p have to save up for 7 month to get 5k blings f2p skins my ass this is just a way for them to have an excuse to make star drops worse
Hello Kairos! Do you have any idea wether the chromatic rarity will be removed on December 12 or January 4?
CCTV POCO IS SO YNDESMSBSshrueksbdyjsbdh GOOD
Skins are gettinh worse with each update smh
Can somebody explain me one thing after the changes in brawl pass now will we able to get the new brawler in the pass through star drops? Or will we have to wait for the next season for it to become free for f2p players
This is starting to look more like Clash Royale
Sandy was once a support
Dude I just realized. Barely got a remodel 😱
Be very good in brawl Olympics
Am I the only one who sees barley running animation
Isnt Sandy support
Sandy is actually the first legendary support brawler
Hi
WHAT, 1600 exp for a single starr drop? bruh thats way too much, isnt it
Toon Spike looks like a power puff girl character
Kairos I think I found what one of the gadgets or star powers are - at 1:09 You can see Mico automatically reload one ammo after eliminating an enemy
NO PLEASE NO WHY CROW AND EDGAR
The only bad thing about this update I need to wait 1 year for waifu colette skin
I think they need to rework the training area. I want a friendly bot for brawlers that heal. And unlimited gadget uses.
Barley got a remodel
Kit reminds me alot about Morgana
No way there adding a better yuumi I to the game
Can someone tell when kit will be released like actual date plz 🙏🏻
Piper came ro Brazil, lesgooo
Imo, this one of those rare updates where Supercell got nearly everything right. Brawl Pass change is the only thing that’s a bit controversial, but I personally think it’s a good change since it buffs the free-to-play economy a ton. Without taking into account balancing and bugs (since they’re unpredictable and tend to be fixed), I’d give this update a 9/10.
Mico got doomfist ult lmao
#santastu
larry and lawrie is just lola but as a thrower
10:47 reminds me of project laser first map 😢😢 very similar map
I like all the new content, but I feel like Colette's skin could look more like regular colette? It'd be more difficult to make them look similar as its a completely different style but once more toon skins come out it might make it more difficult to tell "that brawler is a colette" from just a glance, though this is more of a nitpick then an actual criticism as once they attack it's way easier to tell, especially if they keep the same sound effects
Mico's starpower is that when the bar is charged he reloads his ammo.
Barley is walking kinda weird in that mick footage
i honestly hate the piper skin . the first time i actually hate a skin
I wanna play as lorry
#SantaStu
As a fang main I can't wait to see him S tier
hypercharge unleashed with 5 assassins and dyna? the team with dyna just loses
Dang this is a standout update in terms of skin designs... the Starr toon skins are genuinely some of the best cosmetics I've seen in this game. I haven't dropped gems on cosmetics for years but I'm so sold on the Spike skin!! Their artist team deserves a huge raise!
Kit’s Super is basically just Yuumi’s W and Warwick’s ult from League of Legends combined
Mico is broken mf
Spike god is oficial
So will we get the collete skin with the free brawl pass or not?
CLICK THE CAMARA IN THE LOBBY
CLICK THE CAMARA IN THE LOBBY
Oh and by the way kit deals 1000 damage when MAXED OUT AT 11. Imagine him at power level 1 😭😭😭
this will be terrible meta for throwers For folowing reasons:  1. Mico being added 2.edgar getting hypercharge 3.leon getting hypercharge 4.fangs hypercharge going through walls 5.mico getting hypercharge 6.mortis getting mythic gear (witch will make him slightly better ig)  I will suggest you not to upgrade any throwers until mico will be nerferd (he seems the biggest counter for throwers) i upgraded grom and i regret it this meta will be worst one for throwers so far
fun fact: in japanese, midori (緑）means green, kiiro(黄色）means yellow, and pinku (ピンク）means pink !
ok
IS SOMETHING WEIRD
Im getting that Toon Spike not matter what
PLEASE
Can we take a moment to appreciate how much time kairos takes to tell us
CLICK THE CAMARA
7 dollars every month is crazy tho
IN THE LOBBY
"kit, the first ever legendary support brawler" Sandy: am I a joke to you?  I know hes classified as a controller now but he was technically classified as a support first
KAIROS
Taylor Swift made this update!
They removed shelly's bandaid in the remodel
does someone know when the update is coming?
I feel like once the update drops ppl are gonna start complaining again.
I LOVE SPIKE
did anyone else notice in the brawl talk when it was showing the win streaks hunters was there?
This is the best brawl pass only problem is that its only real money
Edgar will finally go back to the top tier, after years
So we got 3 throwers
isn't sandy a support? or at least he was edit: can't wait to play kit it seams like a fun idea to hop on your teamates especially on a call
When is the update happening???
2:36 kairos: kit, the first legendary support brawler *sandy crying in the corner* 😢
2:13 Nahh that barley run animation 💀💀
Barley looked different in the whole introduction part of mico
2180 dog and 6k health is not that bad. And Mico jumps with every attack. Also you can still see into the bushes, pressuring enemies.
The spike skin should be 199 gems, it lacks custom voicelines which all 299 gems have
This is the first ever brawl stars update that made me disappointed 🫤 the only good thing is kit but everthing else is just extremely disappointing
Anyone else notice how at around 2:05 Barley has, what i’m assuming is, the anniversary skin, with his old model?
Man, im confused with something, like i was thinking about getting the brawl pass plus, but do i have to buy the normal brawl pass and after buy the plus version? I really hope its just a one thing where you buy the plus version or the normal version of the pass😭  (second time i coment this bc nobody seems to know)
Will virus 8 bit skin be seasonal or it will stay in catalog forever ? I really want it
The F2P leaving my body when I saw that Colette skin
wait is barley getting a remodel what was that
We got Yuumi in BS before GTA6
What will will be the cost of monthly brawl pass in INR ?🤔
I hate edgar so much and tgey decided to give him super
If kit is released with the new brawl pass, will my auto claimed credits go to fame or kit
#santastu
1:04 what is. that barley walking animation
cant believe they added doomfist to brawlstars
when is that 2d spike skin coming?
As a Fang main I’ve got to say… YEAH BABY! THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR! THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT! WOOOO
This is crazyyyyyyyyyy!!! I wish I wasn't f2p but this still looks sick
COLETTE'S A FURRY!!!!
if you look frame by frame you can see mortis gear be a 50% increase
Anyone noticed how Barley runs differently? Or is it just me?
I bet mico will bet s tier in gem grab
W UPDATE #SANTASTU
These skins are absolutely godlike
As a League of Legends player when I saw the new legendary I started having Yuumi flashbacks. Hopefully he’s better designed than Yuumi is (no one likes Yuumi)
Y20JLPPRJ #Brawlstars
They also remodeled barley
#santa stu
What happened to new kairos? 😢
Gedi kor the og goat that man made the best skins concepts ever
The new legendary brawler kit is kinda underwhelming ngl
supercell used karios’ idea for Leon’s hypercharge no way
pinku pawlette i gonna make me do bad things
Has anyone noticed Barley new walking animation?
Why is no one noticing that the kid skin is inspired from that one thumbnail Kairos' used!! I know that he gave some artist the task to make a concept but still.
Image we get a gadget by which we can switch between larry and lorry 💀. That would be sol broken 😂
mico starpower : if your first attack hits someone u get 1 ammo
Kit is a her not him
This is probably one of the biggest updates ever like oh my. I cannot wait for 5v5 100% going to get me back into the game. GRAAAAAH YESSSSSSSSSS  Also not mentioned in the video but Barley is getting a remodel
1. Mico apocalypse 2. Dark Angel Colt apocalypse 3. Getting ripped by Kit and frustrated 4. Getting ripped by Larry and frustrated 5. (For some players) Couldn't get Surge and Cordelius and gets frustrated 6. So many skins and couldn't afford a single one
Did ypu see barley move
Starr drops aren't better for the bonus rewards, because now it will cost 1600 XP, not 500.
Im so excited for kit and the free skin!
Miko thinks he is goku
Kairos is the type of guy to find the remodel of Shelly controversial💀
Mico apocalypse in 5v5 💀😭😭
League of Legends got so much hate for making Yuumi, and yet every single game I've played thinks it's a good idea to copy yuumi's design, even thought EVERYONE hates it.
was cool is then you have put the other brother doun and you have the supper you can change. and is you changed and the other bot died,you remain whit the other one
Theyre cooking well
Can we team up with 5 ppl in the lobby?
Spike skin is super 🥰
As usual after watching brawl talk we come to kairos fro explanation
Im so confused is the star hub trio completed? Or not?
Why does barley look like that in Mico showcase
Sandy isn't the support brawler?
Mortis bats speed increased by 50%,you can barely see it when dani's head goes to the right by a bit
Meg’s mecha gets less heals from kit because when she was released, there was a strategy of Byron + Meg = unkillable, so she receives less heals from support now
In the Brawl Talk, the enemy Barley had different walking animations and looked a little off....
Colette skin is from RE-ZERO anime
Guys do you guys notice barley
I want to save the credits from the chroma conversion and credits from my brawlpass for kit. Will they saty?? Please reply 😊
Am i the only one who noticed something off about barley. When they are showing Mico, Barley had a weird run and attack animation. But later in the video he is back to normal. Is this a bug or something for a future update?  Anyways, i love your video's!
isn't barley different?
He has Doomfist ultimate
KT instead of saying ___ gem skin say the rarity of it its simpler
Why does Kit remind me of my 1 year old cat
As a fang main, i'm going to teamwipe even more with the new hypercharge
Gem grab 5v5 looks like you need lots more gems to win, they had almost twenty gems, and there was no countdown.
Hopefully i dont get edgars 🤮
Secret barely remodel
and I just mean that they need to make it work with meg's mech
today my sister turned 18!!
Bro why no one talking about the barley at the mico hypercharge showcase?
#santastu
Let tick live
Kairos’ reaction to the Colette skin was exactly mine as well
Lets go monkie kid collab
Did anyone notice that barleys animation was changed when they were introducing micos hypercharge
toon spike seems crazy one of the first times where i can agree a skin is worth 299 gems
I NEED KIIIIIIT !!!!!!
bruh sandy is a suport brawler
I really hoped for the Brazilian Mandy skin to win. Piper has too many skins while mandy only has 2
#SantaStu #QYRQ9GUL I love your content, i really hope that i win this!!
*good
hopefully they make his super work and make his attack a good attack
barley rework is kinda bad i dont like it
#SantaStu
They need to remodel this colette skin cuz it doesn’t even look like her
So we have cuphead Rico ?
Can I buy collet skin with gems after the brawl pass duration end ? like buster skin .it was in the brawl pass but know i can buy it
This is gonna be crazy! Cant wait for the new update
I am SO exited for kit because he is so cool and I love cats
I will gladly pay for this seasons brawl pass and that spike skin is just to beautiful to not have.
This update might be the best one brawl stars ever had!
the hypercharge and the edgar pick for world finals is changing edgar’s emo life
Best BT review)
Now i have a reason to collect credits. Kit, what a legend.
Bo got buff? 1400 damage! Das crazy
well RIP Brawl stars
kit and mico are even more dyna counters. i hate this idea of giving every new brawler weird mechanics.
5:22 Kit can use his main attack with his super when he is on an enemy. Starpower maybe?
#santastu
#Santa
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
#Santa
Mico-pacolipse  💀
All the toon skins are amazing, especially the spike skin. Although, that colloete skin will destroy the internet
I am so happy Kit is finally here! He is my new fav brawler his mechanics are also so interesting
It also looks like barley is getting a remodel
Can someone pls answer my question? Question is, new brawler kit can be unlocked by credits when he will arrive in game? Or only Brawl Pass/Brawl Pass Plus? New Brawler larry and lowrie will be myhstic? And they can unlocked with credits?
rico ski gives me cuphead vibes 🔥
No one mentioned that we see barely remodeled?
The popcorn does 464 dmg on instant contact
has anyone noticed surge got an hp buff to 6000
wonder what blockbuster will look like in 5v5
Absolutely love this season
Did anyone else notice the barley remodel in the very first shot from Mico in this vid?
I NEED Toon Spike, I absolutely need that skin and I’m so hyped for the update!
If you look at the bar below Mico, when he attacks when his bar is filled he seems to reload an ammo when he hits somebody with his main attack
1:07 is that a star power where when the bar is full and you hit someone, you get your ammo back
1:58 why is Barley like that
They really agve every assasin a way to be even more annoying
I really like mico ❤ bc It freee 😂😂😂
Ferocious fang and antivirus 8bit 😢
Am I The Only One Who Saw Barleys New Animations
For the Mortis mythic gear, speed of bats are increased by 50% if you look closely enough as that segment of the video ends
Piper looks Awesome 😍😍😍😍😍
It sucks that only larrie is playable and not Lawrie. It would be amazing if we can able to control lawrie once larrie dies when lawrie is on the map
This is probably one of the best updates with the new brawlers
50%❤
Ain't no way brawl stars devs literally made  Pinky pawlette  (in case if you're wondering im a Christian)
At 3:25, when Kit latches onto MEG she doesn't heal because he uses his normal attack to latch onto MEG while at 3:49 Kit latches onto Emz using his Super healing her, so this could be how the healing aspect works.
Nice
THE CROW HYPERCHARGE?????? im crying its so beautiful
2:00 did anybody see barley looking different and miving wierd?
We should be able to pick which robot to play as.
Spike's skin is soooooo CUTE😍😍😍😍😋
Barley got remodeled which isnt also mentioned in the brawl talk and you can see that gus is heavily buffed by his ghosts healing up to A WHOPPING AMOUNT OF 3200 in the footage Also collette got a nerf to her super dealing the same amount of damage always not depending on the enemy, she is no longer unique other than her main attack rip I am so excited that I can get all the brawlers releasing in the next update immediately because of how broken the event is W brawl stars
Will skins stay exsclusive for only a year?
Tldr "Together we strong" can work in 5v5  Im imagining a 5v5 team comp where it has Buster Barley Charlie Byron Poco which is similar to another game Overwatch that has 1 tank 2 damage and 2 supports as a standard team. Byron and Poco will  keep up with the healing as well as Barley but he also serves as a thrower for the team, Charlie has basically unlimited ammo which is an advantage and her cocoon can create opportunities for easy kills because 5 players can just target the person. Buster has 5 people around him to charge his super to create space, he is also really good at dealing with assasins like Edgar, he provides protection and close range value to the team. Yea idk thats what I think when I see the new 5v5 update.
Kit did not heal meg beacuz she did not have her starpower!
00:42 what the look at the barley!
Supercell: adds Edgar hypercharge. The community: we are screwed
16:40 get up... you're an adult
me l ABSLOUUTLEY loving the hypercharge event cause i have leon and crow maxed and fangat power 11 so im chlling
Como editaste el video tan rápido? 💀
They added a furry skin for Collette😔
Brawl Stars is getting more and more expressive and creative with their skins and Im loving it!
Can we save ticket for kit or they will take it before ?
In 1 hour clash royale circle jerk “artists” would finish making very detailed art of the new collete skin, mark my words
How much is brawl pass plus??
Did everyone forget that sandy was the first legendary support brawler? 👁👄👁
I noticed barley has a new rework his walk is weird now
Imagine a kit on a mortis😂
1:58 I Just Seen barley having a remodel
when will the update maintenance drop?
As poco main, the poco skin is Too op.😍❤
Toon spike made both of us have the exact same vibe a paper mario outlines and powerpuff girls eyes
Kairos turns a 10 minutes Brawl Talk into a 20 minutes analysis and I wouldn’t want it any other way! 30 minutes of my Saturday well spent!
Can you used ur banked credit for kitt or its auto claim😢
#santastu : )
Look I’m not a furry………….. but
The newFrank skins better say "HEHEHE HA" When he uses his super
you get faster in snow
Trouphy road changes ???
9:12 I MAXED CROW AND HAVE ENOUGH COINS TO GET A HYPERCHARGE AND CROWS MY FAVORITE BRAWLER😁
Where is balance changes
i am NOT looking foward to people using collete's new skin.
Collette skin is something else💀💀💀
That spike skin >>>>>>
From super does 3200 damage. Mico’s super damage is nowhere close 💀
I never considered to buying a 299 gem skin until I saw toon spike
The new spike skin is so awsome
Collette 😩🥛
When does hypercharge come out
Does this mean r-t’s trio is going to be the first trio to technically have more than 3 brawlers or at least characters?
Hey Kairos i saw a change in Barleys model in the Mico hypercharge clip is that a bug ?
Penny mains when kitty uses super to teammates
Bro exposed himself at 16:40
Kit is actually healing Meg in the footage, because she just got shot right before he jumped on her and then immediately started healing. With EMZ he was healing himself, which can potentially be a star power.
The charged attack of Mico is if he hits an enemy with it he regains 1 ammo👍
Larry and the other one (forget his name) is going to get a name nerf like ruffs.
As a player playing from global launch, seeing Gedi's king skins being added brings so much nostalgia, congrats gedi ❤️
man, I might say your the best player ever
Lary and lory 7:43 are basically gama 1 and gama 2 from the new dbs movie🎥
The bar ander MICO😮
I think he procs the natural healing quicker or something and the 520 was the health he recovered
will fangs hypercharge scale off his fresh kicks star power?
Piper Skin Doesn't change My Mind She is Still Mid Charlie Better
Judging by the footage, I can assume Mico's star power will be "Steal ammo if you land DIRECTLY on top of an enemy brawler"
Am I the only one who thinks barley got reworked?
0:42 Did anyone see barley? Why does he look so discombulated💀
I'm glad the brawl pass isn't gonna cost gems anymore, so now I can buy the Toon Spike skin and not feel shame for wasting progression 😀
Hypercharge Crow super on the safe 💀
They Made Piper dirty🤮
So gems r not getting removed from game right? 😢.  Coz i got panicked when chicken said they will dissappear after the update in last video.....
lori takes no damage when larry? is spawned... new sprout cheese maybe
is there any one note frank attak delay been decrease
#SantaStu
THIS UPDATE IS LITERALLY INSANE! SO HYPE!!!  On a real note, I actually haven't been this excited for an update in ages!!!! Let's go!
Mico just straight up Doomfist💀
Common brawl stars W
Why would we need more progression on f2p if we almost maxed acc and not getting any bling
Lex: 4 and a half brawlers  Kairos: 3 and a half
The fan service is insane. Hoshino Ai will be mine!
Mortis's new mythic gear makes his bats go 50% faster and barley gets new animations! THIS UPDATE IS HUGE🔥
1:04 nobody talks anout the barley remodel
Does anybody else notice that Barley has a new walking/running animation?
Did barley get a remodel
I need that collete skin for reasearch purpose
Barly has a diferite movmen in The brawl talk
It should be noted that Mico has a mechanic or starpower that seems to replenish all/1 bar of ammo when he lands his main attack when the bar is full
Mico low-key reminds me of Doomfist from Overwatch, which is ironic because now we're getting 5v5 lol. Will definitely be into maxing him out, looks crazy fun
Kit is basically lol yuumi
Prepare for Edgar apocalypse 2.0
Who liked spikes costume
Kairos wasn’t lying when he said “hear me out” for Collette with these new skins💀
2:00 Bro what is that new Barley walking animation 💀
are the brawl pass recolors going to be available for purchase after a year?
This update is too crazy.😆😆😆
I honestly hate that a sign of your skill and dedication to the game is now also a sign of the money you spend This is about titles btw
3:00 What if, when Kit sticks onto a brawler, there is a bar that runs out by time and decreases faster when that brawler attacks, and Kit still doesn’t get damaged (i.e. the attack stick time runs out faster). After all, they are stunned when stuck onto so there should be a way to manually unstick and survive. Like you could at least run away from Cordelius.  Questions: Will Kit go invisible when hitched on Leon (I hope not)? Won’t Kit basically nullify most brawlers’ supers? Will other brawlers have a chance to attack at all? Kit can just see any opp with a super and use his super on them. There are brawlers who need much more time to aim attacks. Imbalances currently: Terrible teammates. What kind of support does that kind of damage? Kit can hitch onto other brawlers too quickly and from a range, can easily join a fight.Attack deals way too much damage. Stunning is a big disadvantage in solos. Kit sticks on and both brawlers don’t move: Kit has no ammo + could get camped (valid way to combat Kit in team scenarios, but unfair to the stunned brawler and Kit in solos). Solo scenario: Kit sticks onto brawler A, brawler B arrives and camps Kit -> Brawler A dies, Kit unsticks and is killed by Brawler B. Team scenario: Kit sticks onto opponent, other brawlers have enough time to go and kill any survivors.
It nobody gonna talk about barley remodel
Bat Storm will increase the speed of bats by 50% you can see it slightly in the transition
new barley anims?
I also saw a skin for kit!
0:14 BARLEY WHY?!?!? WHY DOES HE WALK LIKE THAT WHYYYYYY?!?!?!?!?
3 Hypercharge brawler= 0% heist in 2 sec
can we buy the new brawl pass skin after the season is over??
Its just look like we going back in time 2d game play
Brawl stars turned into furry stars real quick 💀.
colette fans:
nice
I actually predict leon hypercharge is gonna be like that and I see barley walking weird
I wonder what happens if kit jumps on a brawler that can jump/fly/dash/walk on water; and whether or not Lawrie can heal himself while not attacking or get healed by teammates since it’s more like a brawler than a pet 🤔
Doll Jessie is so creepy
Wsp with barley 💀
Supercell knows what the collette fanbase wants 💀
That spike skin is insane easily the best skin in the game
I guess Kairos likes Pawlette a bit too much...
So what I’m hearing that Kit is just a different multiverse version of league of legends Yummi.
The best brawl talk.
I like having some sort of stage hazards like the ice. We haven’t had that since the minecarts and it adds some good variety
This robots looks more legendary then the cat
TGE COLETTE SKIN LMAO
you should make your wife rate the skins again
I think that when the mico bar is charged at 100%, his next attack steals 33% of the ammunition from enemies like Pam and Chuck And Kit can attack while he is on a ennemy whereas the ennemy can't
Honestly this might be the best update we've gotten in a long time.   The Brawl Pass changes are overall pretty decent imo, even if you're a f2p player. Obviously it sucks that you can't buy the Brawl Pass with gems, but the devs did buff the free pass in other ways to where it's not a complete slap in the face for f2p players. Also having the pass be monthly will help the game not feel stale for long periods of time.  The main thing I'm happy about is 5v5. The last few updates (and even this one) have mainly focused on fixing/overhauling features already in the game, so it's nice to see a new way to play the game. I'm VERY excited to give 5v5 a try, and I'm also curious to see what broken strategies will arise due to the unique comps we'll be able to make with 5 brawlers on a team.
will the new brawl pass skins be available later for gems ? :)
Bro made a video so fast
When you show the hypercharge of Mico, the barley looks weird
#santastu
Will the new brawl pass  skins come back after a year like the other ones?
Collete skin 🧐🧐🧐
#santastu
They added yuumi on brawl stars like we havent had enough of yuumi in league💀
To your knowledge will the accumulated credits go towards Kit or will they just go to fame at the end of this season?
Any way you can make a list here in the comments or description of the skins and their prices, I want to remember them but my memory is smaller than something’s that’s small
Poco's skin is ironic in that this is the only skin of his where he HAS a skin
It looks like the charge bar for mico when is fully loaded gives you 1 ammo instantly
I love your videos Kairos! Greetings from Guatemala!
Oh no brawl pass plus sounds like diamond pass
I love the spike skin
This is just my thoughts but I think that Larry's super can be more interesting if we were able to switch places with Lawrie.
The old leon is BACKKKK
this is by far the best uptade for me
Barly remodel?
Toon spike is the best skin in the game, change my mind
Im definitely buying that Spike skin, is the first Spike skin that I like and doesn't remove the Spike charisma
Then how to get brawl pass😢
Watching Kairos after Brawl talk is compulsory 😊
#AquiéBrasil!
All of these brawlers better get nerfed!
This is maybe the most fun update of all time.
Miko is doomfist
Does anybody notice barley attack animation😱while mico killing barley.
15:59 ah.... i thought it was gonna be a Barley skin and i got excited for a moment.....
They so tought it'll be a good idea to give fang a hypercharge 💀
Hey Kairos, I have a question. I already have all the chromatic brawlers. Should I spend the rest of my chroma credits on fame?
Theres a new remodel for Barley in the Mico footage btw!
What is up with barley in the mico part
i also noticed that barley got a (remodel??) and he walks different too so that’s cool
Karios you havent seen that in the brawl talk we can see barley attacking animations not confirmed but might come
3:25 Kit is infact healing Meg in that clip. It's just not healing itself because Kit is already at max health
LETS GOOO FANG HYPER CHARGE +ferocious fang  SKIN
Why is in the mico hyparcharge clip barley looks so weird?
They should make 5v5 gamemodes that are combos of different gamemodes where u need to achieve all win conditions Like gem grab + brawl ball, hot zone + wipeout, heist + gemgrab I think it will be so chaotic and awesome
Imma be honest:Anti-virus looks horrible.
Wait, barley is getting a remodel.😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Mico is the new anti thrower
One thing i am confuse about is in both brawl pass andbrawlpassplus bothshoe new brawler unlock but not shown in video ?
Did anyone noticed the new movement for barley?!!!!!
7:11 heyy! How did Lawrie got damage of 1750 😮.....if you slow the video to the fullest u will notice that bull damaged larry but it didnt do anything to him it rather damaged his brother lawrie
Yuumi of Brawl Stars 😀👍
Is no one gonna talk about how cool the toon spike skin looks?
10:37, how did that dynamike super not kill 8-Bit???
I think the 3rd brawler's super (couldn't figure out whuxh belong to the guy we're playing as) is like a bot
I have just one question, is virus 8-bit coming back for 300 gems as a recolor or is it only gonna be available for the players who bought the regular for like 50 gems?
My wallet be down bad next month for the Colette skins 💀
I don’t know who I am excited for, Mico, Kit, or Larry & Lawrie, all of them are just so cool!
oh no brawl stars added yuumi to the game T^T
Crow hyp
Just noticed that barley have a new animation
im so glad that no more than 2 of the brawlers i use are getting hypercharges
I'm really looking forward to the new vs old brawlpass progression video. Am not sure whether the brawlpass plus is worth the extra few euros, the vid is gonna make it easier to decide.
I feel like one of the L Duo's gadgets will let us change to the other L, meaning we will be able to play as Larry (? the evil/bad one).
Kits brawl pass skin is so sick, supercell did a fantastic job
can we literally talk about barley having a different model
Wait a second they gave a kid a valentaines skin. Ain’t no way
I can’t believe kairos did not saw the new barley walking animation 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thanks for the update!
since furious fang now got a recolour, but major rosa didn't (those were the 2 bp skins in season 10) does that mean that major rosa will never come back as a recolour in the future..or is there still hope for me? 😢
YES THE FANG SKIN
As f2p player, im definitely getting that Jessie skin
Mico has a mythical gyatt
#santastu
Woo hoo! Let's go!
Anyone else feel like these hyper charges are kinda boring
BS is pay2win now😪
Idk if anyone else saw, but in the Mico clip you can see another probably free skin for the anniversary: OG Barley
Edgar hypercharge 😭💀
Everyone do be simping on collete waering a maid dress
I want to ask that in 5v5 brawl ball we have to goal 2 goals or more Edit-1 I want darklord spike
I had respect for brawl stars until they released anime skins. First fang, now collete...
Frank Hihihiha, finally ✍️🔥
That collette skin became my new favourite skin.its a shame that its a brawl pass skin so i have to wait for the colour variation...  Anything for my wife
Are they changing the way barley moves because I hated it in the developer build
With all of these new hypercharge, brawl stars decided to ignore the mega at this point
even more star drops 🤬
LOOK AT THE BARELY WALKING ANIMATION THO
Hatsune miku is coming to brawl stars!
Why barley look like that when they were showing mico
Anyone else notice the Barley remodel?
LET'S LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!
come on , it would be a lie to feed if u say all the f2p players want is progression. we also want cosmatics, yes not as much as pay 2 win players but we also want it. also,the two paid brawlpass thing  is used in every china company based games. and iterestingly supercell now belongs to tecno . china game company also use gotcha machanic to make thier players addicted to their game . you know this kairos . just hope you wont be blinded by the money or other pressure to bring all this to light in your 100 parcent honest review.
The devs knew what they were doing with collete and Piper💀. Honey trapping is crazy
Do you know if we will be bale to save credit for kit and larry as i have a ton
0:14 What is wrong with barely
This update will be so good !
Why does Barley walk like that?
This update is gonna be INSANE! 🔥🔥
Barrley got a new walking animation check it out kairos check 1:59 and pause it
I will be spending quality time with the piper skin😂
The team is knocking it out of the PARK
When will be the apdate?
I think Larry will have gadget that give you a chance to play with big brawler(if its true its gonna be insane)
Are their balance changes?
Another great update as usual
If they add hot zone 5v5, I hope, they add a contested mechanic, because having 10 people constantly coming to the zone will be more of a "who reaches the zone first wins" than capture and defend the zone  Also the cartoon trio skins is a wierd trio: Anime cat maid Colette "Cuphead" Rico And "power puff girls" Spike with mickey mouse pants
2:30-barley looks a bit different
Thx kairos for keeping us entertained for all these years we love u❤❤
So we wonr get another update until march?
anyone notice barleys run animation?
I love monkey
Are the 5v5 game modes gonna be for trophies?
Sandy is actually the first legendary support brawler but got change to controller.
Did anyone else have trouble claiming there pin I press claim and nothing happens am I doing something wrong or is it just not working please help??
As much as i absolutely HATE, and i say REALLY HATE WITH ALL THE FIBER OF MY BODY the starr dropp system, its far better than 10 coins ever 500 tokens
Iam happy that i save legendry credits😢😢
Good skins 🎉🎉🎉 I have 400 gems saved up 😎😎😎😎
Did we juts got 3 thower type Brawler
Will we be able to buy brawl pass skins after the brawl pass ends?
Hello Kairos i would really like to get the Santa Stu skin and i follow you on ig and YouTube
Okay but this spike skin is insane time to get my credit card LMAO Also, where is the last castle trio brawler? :( Hopefuly next season...
5 assassin hypercharges at once, showdown is gonna be chaos
hi
0:14 Did Barley get a remodel?
just curious, for people who make an account and connect to supercell id, who don't have barley, will wizard barley be saved but they won't get barley or will they get barley?
R34 bouta be wild after this update ( im not watching it just sayin )
Have anyone noticed that when Mico hit someone with basic attack, the scrap sucker effect shows up. Maybe its a star power, idk.
Imagine best players on mico unplayable
Wait lets say u dint have collette and u get the bp what will happen to the skin
Did anyone else catch that barley remodel? Literally looks like the girl from the ring 😂  Also in my opinion this is one of the best updates that the brawl stars team had released I’d even argue it’s better than the very first brawl pass
Wow, Kairos Sonic Time.
Kairos your too fast with the brawl talk videos it scares me 😂
I wished that leons hypercharge was teleport but I was right about fang.
SO EXCITED FOR LARRY AND LAWRIE
Something to note: there might be more gems needed to begin countdown in 5v5 gemgrab because when bo grabbed gems a countdown didn't begin
Kit
I hate the cartoon skins
you get the brawl talk early, don't you?
Is barley changed?  1:05
The collette skin looks kinda wierd, outside of that everything else looks awesome! (Also are we not going to talk about how Kit is literally Yuumi from league of legends)
Everyone is happy about the update until you realise that kairos and generally every other brawl stars youtubers f2p series is over due to the change to the brawl pass😭😭😭😭😭😭
The controllers skin is based on switch joy-cons
I'm confused isn't sandy also a support legendary?
#SantaStu
So we got cooler Mortis, Warwick and Yuumi hybrid and better nita?
18:36 FBI FBI OPEN UP!
Dude did u see they updated barley's throwing animation
I just love ur vids Kairos! #SantaStu
Edgar mains: YES EDGAR IS FINALLY S-TIER!!!
i am really disappointed how the brawl stars team removes credit banking and then adds a fun legendary brawler. so sad. please dont delete credit banking
Is the player titel with brawl pass plus forever on your acccount or just till the season ends?
I really like the idea for Larry and lorry 😊 (i think that how you spell lorry)
Why does barley look so weird
When I first saw Miko I knew he would get a son wukong skin
I like that the controller brothers skin have a joystick and the 4 buttons on there head
They did barley dirty 💀💀💀
Is it just me or does Barley look like he has new animations? During Mico's part in the video, Barley looked different  Also about Lawrie, it looks like it has the regular bot AI so he'll move similar to bots and not like Nita's bear
For Larry and Lawry I wish we could switch playing between them as long as both are alive. Also it would've been cool if we could choose with which one we start the match (this will also be the one that respawns during the match).
i hope 5 v 5 gives more trophies
Finally they realeased kit after 2 years
Imagine 5 throwers on 5v5 😭
3:54 this aint tara its meg btw😅
I can’t wait for Mico to come out and for that amazing Wukong skin!
The new brawlers names are pretty self explanatory this time around: -kit being a cat -a Mico is a family of monkey in it's own right (and they're super cute too) -Larry and Laury are basically there to enforce the law  --Not much ik about kit's personality but he does remind me of Felix the Cat who is one of the first big time names as far as animated cartoons to leave a mark in the industry. --Of course, people who are familiar with the Powerpuff Girls will recognize what Spike's skin is inspired by. -- Larry and Laury's skin resemble Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers  Overall, this is a pretty tightly packed update and I'm really hyped and excited for it. *Especially* the 5v5 game modes!
How can f2p players get the brawl pass skin?? As someone who loves anime, i have been waiting for an anime themed skin for a long time. I really want pinku/midori collette
am i the only one that saw barley running @ 0:41 ??
bro the super of the third brawler it's like a ranged bruce💀💀 i feel like that's gonna be op
cant wait
WOO!! HYPE!! 🎉😊❤😮
Kit supporting Ash will be broken
I mean. It’s gonna take 4 days worth of xp to get 1 bonus star drop. 2 with doublers. So at most in a season we would get 12-16~ extra star drops. Imagine their all rare. Which can very easily happen, I wish I could share my mega pig rewards to prove it lol. They wanted to take away boxes for the “random” progression yet it’s more random than it was a year ago.
What if a kit uses a super on a kit and that kit uses a super on another kit
Looks like one of Mico’s Star Power is ammo stealing when his bar is fully charged
Kit is finally here after 3 years
30 mins after brawl talk is crazy, kairos is him
16:39 Bro Kairos is getting wild 💀
1:05 I haven't seen anyone talk about this, but Barley looks like he has gotten a remodel, or at least some new animations
Why did barley look like that?
Like crow, Cat also affected by the Mysterious Gem from starr park!!!
Larry is basically dynamike + nita + mr p
Karios: kit the very first legendary support brawler Wasn't sandy a support brawler?
#SantaStu
i have so many saved credits in this brawl pass and chroma credits, and if this season end these credits will instantly go towards to kit? please help me :)
Most unique skin IS SPIKES SKIN
Kairos, the brawl talk just ended, how did you get those drawings for your thumbnail
This update will be great. I just wonder what happens to gifted brawl passes, now the brawl pass will be cheaper. I still have 1 pass unused.
#SantaStu❤
10:00 it looks like dyna is no longer going to be able to push back characters with his super normally… probably only for the hyper charge as a Nerf  I know he has been dominating, but damn… that’s pretty harsh
Ayo, we just got Brawlstars Yuumi
Love your videos KT keep it up❤❤
15:48 Me, a Lego Monkie Kid fan seeing this: *I want it*
Hope they buff coin progression cuz I am broke with coins
Guys should I stop unlocking amber and wait for kit I have 3078 credits for amber and they are claimed pls help
as a spike main, that spike skin is gonna make me lose my f2p...
Although the free bp got buffed, the paid side of bp also got buffed, which causes f2p players to get a disadvantage, personally, the new bp system gave me a feeling similar to the update for losers for clash royale, but the rest of the update makes up for it.
micos starpower looks like he reloads a whole ammo if he hit his first one like piper
5v5 looks so fun 🔥
Ngl kit looks different from the previous model... BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING HES FINALLY HERE-
WAIT, BARLEY HAS A NEW ANIMATION?
This is good, but I was really hoping they would add a way to trade power points for coins, cause I followed your old advice about spending club points on power points, and now I have too many power points and way less coins. Btw Kairos I would really appreciate if you liked or replied to my comment just so I know you've read it.
Did I saw that right? 2:30 Barley is walking strange and looking a bit different
#santastu
Man my all chroma credits , that will turn into credita will be wasted because i have all the brawlers and the new brawlers will be released late 😩
Bruh forget everything we have the fucking king my only hope is that he's gonna have a hehehaw sound 😂
New Piper skin is something else 🥵
Isn't sandy a legendary support brawler? 🤔
Guys the old skin this year is old barely
Got to love a good kiaros video am I right😊
Can we purchase colette skin or should we have to buy the brawl pass??
It looks like the 520 was Kit healing himself. The kit on meg wasn't showing healing numbers but the health was going before the regen timer started. It looked to be about 10% teammate heal per tick.
Did anyone notice the Barley bots walking really weirdly???
9:47 did anyone notice early access offer giving 500 gems for 1000 coins 🤯🤯
What about that bar above mico
Kit is healing meg i think but it isnt showing the value? Probably a bug because of megs mech
As a crow main, I see this as an absolute win
#santastu
I think mico’s star power will be when the bar is fully charged,if his next attack hits an enemy, it will charge one of his ammo
The comparison for Mico's super to Grom is incorrect as Grom deal 3200 damage, while Mico only deals 2380. It's more similar to Emz's or Frank's super Also, Kit's super heals him and allies 10% of their max hp. It doesn't show on their teammates, but you can do some calculations on Meg and Kit to figure a pattern
I’m waiting for the new Colette simps they go crazy lol
Did anyone saw How The barley moves? 💀
W update
I am surprised that brawl talk did not covered about the “ice”
Yeah this is def the best update so far
This was the biggest brawl talk😮
Hello kairos, please can you make another series where you you play F2P EXCEPT. The brawl pass to show the value of the pass! 😮😮
I think one of mico's star power is that everytime he has his bar fully charged, he will steal / gain and ammo from the enemies
Despite there comments I’m still a little confused on the brawl pass and brawl pass plus
How on earth did you make this so goddamn fast brawl talk was 20 mins ago, this video is 20mins and it was 10 mins ago
This update is literally about to make me blow fr💀💀
You heard of Poco double tank. Now prepare for Poco quadruple tank!
That 500 gems tho😮
So i guess kairos f2p account is going to have some good days while getting jumped on micoh (i forgot how to spell he name)
How fast did u film this video???
I am afraid that Kitty vill be like Yuumi from League of Legends...
Its become a tradition to watch Kairos after watching Brawl Talk. ❤
finally another counter to throwers
Say bye bye to throwers yall
Why does the new brawl pass kinda feel like stumble guys pass?
I don't know if my eyes may have played tricks on me, but it seems like Kit Charged the supers for the Allies who they jumped on!
Will cat girl collete come back after a year?
Finally Niko arrive to Brawl Star
New member for RT family!
I am an edgar main with edgar power 11 and that hypercharge..... i am coming
Me rejoicing over this update knowing damn well my bank account is crying
This brawl talk was packed
I like the update a ton they really went out of there way for this BUT LOOK AT BARLEY AT THE START WTH IS THAT
Dude the skins look soo good 😫 I really wanna buy them all specially those frank skin , furious fang recolour ( i am now regretting after buying kabocha fang 🙂) , and skipe & collete skin 💀 and mico skin is also really good
Interesting new brawlers... Mico seems OP Kit seems on the weaker side And Larry seems weird. I don't like though how his basic attack is basically the same as Barley's
Kairos do you know how the 5v5 wins are going to work out? Are they going to be added to 3v3 wins or are they getting their own category
The fact that they made some of the hypercharges that you wanted is pretty crazy
Yeah no Kit is gonna need several emergency nerfs
THIS IS SO HYPE!!!!!! =D
Did i dream or barley is getting reworked 😮😮😮look at the hypercharge mico part
13:48 This means that you can’t unlock Barley by getting his Wizard skin on Supercell ID. That’s interesting…
May be kit only heals when he has missing hp and it might even be proportional to missing hp??!
So one question, can we buy with credits Kit when he comes out ? Ty if anyone can answer
Brawl Stars dev team cooked with this update
Imagine being a simp for collete's skins💀
Best brawltalk ever
2:36 actually Sandy was classified as a support
Kit really thought he is L4D2 hunter
as a former league player, i can already say kit will be annoying
Invisaheal hypercharge will be stupid good
Can you make a max voice actor for lex!
I just realized, the purple line from micos attack, if you hit an enemy with it, emediatly charges another attack
Honestly excited for 5v5
There is about to be a boom in weeb players
Piper looks horrible 😂
Forget the mico apocalypse, Edgar’s hypercharge is scarier
Wouldn’t it be cool if you could choose who you want to play between Larry and Lawry before you start a match? I wish\hope it’s like that.
This update my 4 favorite brawlers gat hyper charge at once.
I think his gadget will be that he can play his older brother.
micos star power will take away ammo when the bar is full THIS IS TEREFAING 💀💀
I have a question , Will i be able to buy the brawl pass plus without having to buy the normal brawl pass in the Supercell store?
Fun Fact: In some of the clips barley is being played, he has different animations. He’s the next brawler to get a remodel!
I love how Mico’s super turns him into Doomfist from Overwatch
I think this is gonna be a great update, fixed a lot of issues! Thanks Kairos for ur commentary!
Looks like one of mico’s starpower is healing during his super
buzz got new attack animation and barley got new walking animations ahh
What if kit can ride nita bear 😳?
The spike and Collette skins are 👌😩
I still think is quite unfair to be forced to use real money if you want the brawl pass, the only thing that made brawl pass special was that it could be get by f2p too
Kairos uploaded so fast No wonder he is called Kairos Time
Hiii
WHY DID THE BULLSHIT EDGAR WILL GET HYPERCHARGE😭
That Clash Royale Frank skin though! 🤩
Which brawler are you MOST excited for!? SUBSCRIBE for update sneak peeks!
I just completed watching the brawl talk and I am stunned 😳. Literally this much stuff 😮 and the most shocking part for me was edgar and fang hypercharge 😂 no one literally expected two most popular brawler to get a hypercharge. Overall the future of brawl stars looks really great 😃👍
KT it wasent dam 20 minuts
Brawl talk was 3 minutes ago, i klicked on this video when it was uploaded 3 minutes ago and this was a brawl talk recap, are you god? And it was edited!
0:40  bro barley got that cartoony walk 💀  yea also, #SantaStu
Isnt sandy a support brawler thats legendary
probably one of the the best brawl talks in a while so much stuff 😭😭
This brawl talk was actually insane
A lot of league of legends inspiration this update between Wukong and Kit
simps will be awakened after seeing that collette and piper skin
There is so much contet i dont know where to start☠️ 👇
So am I just mistaken or wasn’t kit supposed to be the name of the final member of the star force? With ruffs and squeak?
Whats going on with the barley at 2:10
I rlly want a discount on kit like chester when he was released!!
Those Cartoon Skins LOOK AWESOME!!! Especially the rico and spike
2:23 we can clearly see they remodel barley
BRO WHTA HAPPEND TO BARLEYYYY
There is remodel for barley
Will we get to buy virus 8 bit again
Kit is basically yummi and warwicks fusion
you gotta be kitten me right meow
I'm so hyped for maid colette🗿
Kairos voice sounds a little off you good bro?
First legendary support brawler yay sandy no support it seems
Did anyone notice new barley animation at 0:40
2:00 KAIROS! they didn't mention it and I think you didn't notice but barley clearly got a remodel and new animations!
The barley looks remodeled look at it when they show mico
So much to take in! Love the skins, especially the cartoon themed ones, the brawlers look fun and there's other cool stuff in there!
No rt skin :(
saying it so 8 year olds can’t say it first
Ok but why does the barley look like that lol 😂😂😂
Sandy was a support 🙃
I think this update looks amazing, but one complaint I have is that they are now gatekeeping all content behind time. The new brawlers from startoon release in January and in February which is a very long wait for what would otherwise be instant releases in previous updates.   I'd honestly rather have them release the brawlers immediately since by the time they would actually come out the hype will have already died down. Another thing to mention is hypercharges are also gatekept for 2 weeks which feels a bit long
2:31 I just noticed barley has a new animation
My Kit fans unite! We finally got him in game!
Idk why but a funny cat that attaches to brawlers is kinda familiar🤔🤔🤔🤔
Of course Colette gets the anime skin
As an endgame player I rarely find myself feeling excited about these updates. Having played the game for four years, I rarely see new features that I am excited to experience. Part of this is because all of the new brawler concepts are very lackluster.
I just want to say that the dedication Kairos puts into these videos are insane! Keep up the good work!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Who noticed that barely got new move animation in the brawl talk video 1:04😂
2:20 what the heck is that barley model???
Anyone noticed that barley animation changed
Something I noticed was the bar that mico has and whenever he hits a target when the bar is full, he gets an attack back
Brawl pass improvement is my favorite thing
Oj's cheese will be so fresh
Why does kit look like that im sorry 😟
Was so loaded with information from brawlt talk.Luckilty good ol kairos here to break everything down.
2:11 barli new
How did you get an Video out already?
HOW DID YOU DROP SO FAST
I genuinely thought that was a piper skin and not collete
Fang be looking like a Mint Oreo now
Oh no… Best spike skin that I have ever seen… fang getting hypercharge… my wallet 😢
Ahhhhhh
3 min ago and very early
that collete skin makes me want to buy the brawl pass 🥵
Please god pleeeease make a Tara skin or Tara hyper charge or even mythic gear next NEXT season PLEASE
Did i just see barrly is diffrend
POWER PUFF PLANT 🌵🌵 SO CUTE
Barley design change and movement 💀
I have over 4k credits saved I WILL GET KIT WHEN  HE COMES OUT!!!!
I'm so excited, this is one of the most packed updates ever
Mico really has Doomfist ult lol

#santastu😊
Why did Dani swear
It’s almost like a tradition to go to Kairos after brawl talk!
#santasty
Win streak absolute insane
pls watch the video first ( dont say i did it )
They really said: "Let's make everyone mad with this update by making the most hated brawlers broken"
That a genius bp+ marketing. Simps always a good money bait.
I always like your explanation
They knew what they were doing with the colette skin 💀
When u get to watch brawl talk.cuz after the end of brawl talk u guys immediately upload ur video 🎉
bro the brawl talk dropped 2 minutes ago...
BARLEYS ANIMATON CHANGED!

Dear kairos, Supercell banned me for „Acc sharing“, but I didn’t do it, I Writed them before I get banned that I got hacked, but they banned me anyways :( i swear I didn’t shared it, the ID was: 9U0VLVQCY, I can’t write anymore the support on second accounts, pls help me
Omg oh no edgar
1 minute gang
you are the best
Edgar hypercharge fans gonna like this comment ❤
Kairos will heart this comment 🥶🥶
2:10 og barley skin?
Why tell of about the February brawler so soon
İs kairos a brawler?  Why does he say "hello fellow brawlers?"
bruh Karios made this video before brawl talk 1:58 what's up with that Barley animation?
#santastu ......  Me?
i think larry and lawry might be a bit hard to tell apart so getting the skin would be a debuff
Oh man it’s about time we got a new Mythical Gear I’ve been waiting for this one! 🔥
These brawlers are about to be insane.
Announcing 3 new brawlers really gets me hyped
How can you do a video longer then the brawl talk?
This is tradition at this point...
hey can i ask, i have like 2000 saved credits on previous brawl passes, i dont want them to go to fame but go to the new legendary brawler will it go to fame or the new brawler and how do i put it on new brawlers
Always go to Kairos after Brawl Talk
I'm excited
HYPE
So quick after brawl talk
I tot I'm first
I think mico will be cool but we need to watch out for the apocalypse
Ion know how I feel about the brawl pass. From what we were promised, a 33 percent nerf to the progression we were supposed to get makes me dissatisfied
Brawl Stars boutta make bank off the Collette skin
this update crazy
Just like 3.5 new events some time ago hahaha
Lets go early
I’m ready
Barly looks so different.?
aah yes i remember when they released 3.5 new game modes

bro posted instantly
I wish poor Doug would get a new skin 😅
Love what you do keep up the good work
Jaldi jaldi comment karta hu indian viewers like dege 😅
This update is crazy atleast from the thumbnail
I thought it was small but I was so wrong. It’s BIG. Like we haven’t got 3 and a half brawlers in 1 brawls talk
#santastu
All the brawlers sound fun as hell. Though I'm surprised the 3rd brawler is for the rt trio and not the castle court yard
UPDATE HYPE!!!
What is happening to chromatics?
THE UPDATES KEEP GETTING BETTER
