I will miss this 2020 heat bruh
bucks is so good
I love you so much
Finally we win a game it's been so long I actually can't believe we Quest Orlando but after this we got your stroid
Kobe Bryant in 2009: - Beats Houston In the 2nd round  - Faced The Nuggets In WCF And Won - Won his 4th Ring In Orlando LeBron James in 2020:  - Beats Houston In The 2nd Round  - Faces Nuggets In The WCF.. - Trying To Win His 4th Ring In Orlando🤯
Stop supporting the Chinese Communist Party, stop watching the NBA!
Fuck Bucks and Screw the NBA
are these highlights of the game or highlights of bucks basket
Andrew Wiggins Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid and Ben Simmon are speechless to Jimmy Butler and his Teammates MiaHeat. Jimmy Butler is a good leader man 💪👏👍
ChicaBuls Minnsota and Philla76 Andrew Wiggins Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid and Ben Simmon are speechless..wOw to Jimmy Butler and his Teammates MiaHeat. Jimmy Butler is a good leader man 💪👏👍
Always next season with the Milwaukee Bucks hopefully a great win championship would be nice
cool video. go jazz and heat. I play a ton of Basketball.
Who’s here after the Heat won the series?
Miami deserve to be in the conference finals. I'm a pacers fan.
i'm genuinely so confused, why are the bucks so good in the regular season but so bad in the post???
Ok maybe not.lol
I fully believe that the bucks can win this series even after being down 0-3. It's never happened before but all things are possible. A 16 seed had never beat a 1 seed in the mens ncaa basketball tournament but we witnessed that streak coming to an end a couple years ago. All I'm saying is Eventually it's gonna happen and I think this bucks team is good enough to pull it off against this heat team, no disrespect to the Heat cause they have been playing great team basketball. I think it's time for it to happen and I think the bucks are gonna win 4 straight.
3:31 flopping
how the f are the bucks losing
I like how Lopez his size can shoot threes better than Giannis they are all 🐐🦌 miAmi  are also bad asses
Giannis is key to the team but when your back is against the wall you just gotta play. But man that Herro Guy almost knocked the Bucks out, lol!!!

Telling me the bucks won this game without giannis? hmmmmmmmm
90 percent of these highlights were just the bucks making their shots. NBA is hating on the Heat
love watching NBA game highlights!! check this out too - https://youtu.be/fEzvSbAg9G8
Wow
I honestly think Miami could make it to the finals and WIN.. it's over for the Bucks
Has the NBA and players went to visit they're new National Hero in his hospital bed?
This highlight reel is one sided!!!! 👎

God bless you all. God loves you and so do I. I beg of you to please repent and turn away from your ways. Accept Jesus Christ as your LORD and Savior and watch your life transform for the better. Please take heed of this you’re not reading this by accident, please do this now, no day is promised.❤️
If golden state have Klay and Steph Miami had Tyler and Duncan
what the hell is up with herro lmfao, he literally can't miss in clutch situations
Who cares? Oh I forgot, China.
I don't want to scare anyone but, things aren't looking too great for the current state of the world. But don't worry, there is no need to be scared. Everyone has been offered the most valuable amazing gift in the world. I just want to make sure you guys know that, "15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:15-18 King James Version)" . Men and women have been made sinful since Adam and Eve, the start of our creation, and Jesus has offered a way out. Salvation is a free gift from God given through His Son Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins. I want to let you know that you can escape all the trials and challenges coming to this world by having absolute true faith and trust in Jesus Christ. True faith will show through your actions and your thought process when you have truly believed you become a brand new person for the better. You don't have to experience what is going to come to the world, you can be taken out in the rapture and brought to Heaven while these things take place, and eventually, the entire earth will be destroyed and made new for us to live on. This time, the earth will be without sin, and pain, and suffering, and without corruption, without evil, and without darkness. Things will no longer pass away, but life will be eternal. Trust me, there will be soooo much happiness and true joy and love! The world is going to become amazing!  . Do not worry though, if you miss the rapture, and end up going through these times called, "the tribulations", you can still be saved and receive eternal life, however, you will have to go through very tough trials, and most likely be killed for your faith in Jesus Christ. But do not worry, if you get killed for your faith in Jesus Christ, it will be noticed. You will appear before the throne of Jesus Christ, and He will bring you back to life and you will be able to join in the feast and celebration, and receive eternal life as well.  "4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (Revelation 20:4 KJV)" . There is no simple prayer, or action that you can do to "earn" salvation. "8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV)" Salvation is a free gift from God, and all you have to do is accept His gift to you by believing in His Son Jesus Christ whom the gift is given through, and by believing and trusting in what He did for you. Have faith and trust in God! The start of your journey begins with hearing the word of God, then leads to Jesus Christ, which then leads you to the Holy Spirit, which then brings you to the Father! "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KJV)" "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 KJV)" Enjoy these scriptures to get you started with the word of God, and begin this journey for you now! It is an amazing journey, and you won't ever regret it!  God will never let you down, and will never fail you. He just can't because He is perfect. There may be times where you may feel disappointed or like things didn't go your way, but it is because there was an even better option for you. God has something even better planned for you. Just know that no matter what, when you have true faith and belief in God, things will always turn out well and be good. Almost like they turn out perfectly! God is great! God is SOOOO amazing! Truly! I want you guys all to experience it for yourselves, and receive eternal life, happiness, joy and God's everlasting, infinite, endless amount of love! . Trust and believe in God, He will take good care of you!  Trust and believe in the Father, trust and believe in Jesus Christ who died for your sins and rose on the third day, and trust and receive the Holy Spirit that gives you strength, teaches you and guides you through life. . I like to think of it like this, there is a road, and two on each side of the road. On one side of the road, is the Father, the road is the Holy Spirit, and on the other side is the Son, Jesus Christ, the son of God. You through your faith and belief will be attracted and led towards this place. You are led to Jesus Christ first, and He takes your hand and guides you back to His Father. He guides you and takes you onto the road, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the connection, the bridge, that connects you to God, the Father, and brings you to Him, but it takes Jesus Christ to guide you and pay for your price, and make you worthy to step onto the road, the Holy Spirit. From there, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ work together as one and bring you to the Father. All three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are God. God is one and in His Power and omnipresence, fills and plays all the roles together through these three things, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. . Take care all of you guys! I love you all! Stay happy! Stay positive! Keep loving each other! I hope you all have a blessed and amazing day! Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you all! Amen!
Literally 99% of you won’t see this but God loves you so much. Hope you guys have an fantastic day! (Please Read My Name 🧡❤️)
NBA admits crucial mistake NEWS: https://heatnation.com/game-news/nba-makes-game-changing-discovery-miami-heat-game-in-l2m-report/ VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6mvAoP1NCg
Looks like the Heat were told to let this one go.
Yeah, with Giannis hurt,  the Bucks now have the reason why they lost and didn't make the finals🤗
Can you imagine Bucks wins 4 in a row and make history!

Boycott pro sports
Who gives a shit!!!
that Rookie HERO reminds me of Ray Allen on his shooting form and quick release.
saw this on trending and just wanted to stop by and say FUCK the nba and fuck all y’all
miami choke, Warriors in 7
Lmao did anybody see Lopez flop at 3:33
No Milwaukee bucks is cool !
That was a good game
When Jimmy Butler fell for the Donte 3 Pump fake at the end of the 4th quarter, I already knew the Bucks would win this game, like coaches gotta tell these guys to stay disciplined and not fall for pump fakes or foul on jumpshots, like Bam foul Brook on a fade away 3 like what??? Also why doesn't whoever guard Middleton not put pressure on him, they know most of his shots come from Jumpshots so why sag on him like they do on Giannis? Lastly the Heat have to dare Bledsoe to shoot, he is a below average shooter
Herro went off with those OT 3s, i just might get his jersey DAMN
I show the hoods of New England on my channel . Go celtics !
Giannis too damn frail.... 😂 dude can’t stay healthy. If he could the Bucks would be a problem ever year but shit yo, he can’t and the Bucks won’t be contenders
Tuff
Bucks in game 5 by 12+
Hello it ur reading this PLEASE take at least one minute at least to support me it would really help I need least 1000 subs all I have is like 19. My passion has been music  since I was 7  and I haven't had money or good motivation to start this journey to a big fan base I need your support anything would help thanks God bless you all!🌍🌍🌍
This is over  Mia gonna win the next year one
WOW
Wow
If the bucks come back kris gotta keep playing like this 😤
Middleton stepped up in OT big time especially with out gannins, but if gannins dont play in game 5 this series is over.
The best semis in the entire playoffs even though the bucks are down 3 to 1 but it still is because almost all 4 game were decided in the last 2 minutes of the game and every win by both teams were by less than 4 points.
Herro great shooter, needs to work at his defense
Herro for 3! Bang!
Mamba Middleton. Tyler Herro nearly heroed Miami out of that loss. My God this kid is going to be scary.
For a sec I thought Bam Adebayo qas Dwight Howard
Oklahoma
Kansas City
Was kris middletons foot not on the line 5:21

Dafuq!!! What happened to the game after the jumpball? Both teams suddenly scored 11 and 20?!?!
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
The Heat better put this series away tomorrow. The Heat should've swept the Bucks smh...
Did Giannis fake that injury? He seemed to be walking off the court fine at the end there.
Khris Middleton
BAM is an animal!
They are not going make it... 😢
4:30 Ive noticed that Robinson tends to travel on these handoff screens.
yy GTvlpkVYg. ? Bub and..? In your company in thivs¡
Fun fact: you can’t breathe while you smile. Joking, just wanted to make u smile.  (Don’t I deserve a sub for that??)
https://youtu.be/L2_tY6VFPKI Tyler caught lackin wit folks bitch
Damn hate seeing star players or anybody go down like that. Hope he comes back
KD: i shoot overdose               Middleton: hold my beer
Tyler herro and Duncan Robinson reminds me of klay thompson and S. Curry.. This two making his name in NBA..
So some guy on youtube commented "the Heat blow a 3-0 lead in 2020" in 2017 and his profile was the Bucks. I saw that a day ago like an hour before the game started and im like no fucking way thid has to be a coinsidence, but how in the hell he even know the Heat were going to make the playoffs 3 years prior much less have a 3-0 lead to the Bucks. So that man had to be a time traveler. That is just so crazy to think about
Herro looks the same playing against HS’ers as he does in the NBA. God he’s fun to watch play
Man, I know the bucks had their prayer like oh Deer God 🤣🤣

We're not dead yet. This is getting interesting.
Giannis antetokounmpo u gave up on us you want to leave for Miami. I hope u get als or something horrible u trader. Fuck you Giannis antetokounmpo milwaukee bucks dont need u.

Kris literally carried lmao
Please support my YouTube and subscribe po thank you https://youtu.be/8zXqwlWWgYU
Herro has been at it since he played for Kentucky. 🙌🏼
The Bucks fought soooooo hard to win this game. Amazing 💯💯
So Giannis gets injured never comes back and the heat still find a way to loose 😂
Damn paul peirce be jinxing the games
they let them win or were forced to by the league
Yo I was so scared 😦 I really wanted them to win
thats a respect giannes is down give him a win man..
No giannis but the bucks still won
BUCKS IN 7
Giannis never in his life missed playoff game before he love the game of basketball he dont care how good that team is he will play this for everybody thinking Giannis fake his Injury
rippers undergraduates
I have requested this channel not be recommended on my home page 8 times NBA must be paying YouTube to harass ex NBA fans wer are not coming back until social justice idiots are broke
ayo is it just me or is 5:17 a 2
Its about time for the Bucks and for Middleton. He hooped.
Heats and rockets funs are thinking the wrong way Its just hype NBA is business they want you to be excited.😂😂😂 And at the end superstars still win.
We won 4 straight vs. The Magic.  We can do it again.
Oh deer...
Chris miligoat🐐 just discovered Super Saiyan 💪🏾😅😅😅
Bucks should get Giannis some post moves, put him in the paint and run the offense through KM. He’s one of the best midrange shooters in the game and one of the best 3pt shooters in the game plus his footwork is really good. He can be better than what ppl give him credit for.
Middleton deserves to much credit for this.  Huge performance.  Lots of stars in the league today don’t have a performance as clutch as this on their resume.  If you look at a lot of the games giannis has sat out for some reason or another, it really gives a glimpse of the level of scorer KM would be if he were more of a featured scorer.  I’m not gonna lie I tend to forget about himself myself, but how many 50/40/90 type guys average over 20 per??
Chris Middleton the way of shooting looks like kobe
Kris Clutch threes is better than Gianni Offense and Fastbreak
You Bucks fans are some hopeful people huh....     Still, Heat are winning the series.
Heat in 6
Some of y'all are really ungrateful for saying bucks playing better without Giannis. You all forgot quickly this guy gave you 30+ every night leading them to first seed. I think it's more like the coach that need to change the strategy
BANG!! 🔥Khriss Middleton from downtown! 🔥👌🏻🔥
You gotta love having Herro for your last name
Reggie Kawhi Middleton
surprised heat didnt sweep lol
Let’s go heat🔥 we got this last game
9:15 ok that was lowkey the coolest ATO I've seen in a while
2:53 travel?
Tyler Herro had a chat with Saitama pre-game
This game made me fall in love with middleton never really watched him but cant do nothing but admire the will he had for the bucks
9:16 that play call by Spoelstra is why he’s one of the best in the league. Herro takes and makes the shot, but Dragić and Robinson both had enough space to shoot too. Pretty much 3 options to score. Genius
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the Heat Blew a 3-0 lead...  ( Imagine ) lol
Hero was looking like Reggie Miller for minute lol
Damn Middleton was unguardable in some possessions there. Hope he can bring it again the next game. Butler will bring it for sure.
Much better no gianis
What a road win for the bucks
Gentleman's sweep
that's what i expected from chris he has experience and a better shooter. keep it up that's a good game.
Some moves of Khris look like KOBE x MAMBA MENTALITY <3
scam for the views
Are the bucks better with the star
Now that the Bucs know they can win without 34 they can use two game plans when he comes back they should come back in the series
lopez win this game
Naruto Adebayo
We all know Middleton, he plays a great game today, the next day he bricks all night. But great effort , congrats
Im more impressed with hero shot than middleton. Damn that boy has dagger on his hands
I bet for game 7 bucks
Gianis: what the fuck! why did you won the game guys, i wanna go home.
Mia first lost of the season impressive
if heat can advance to the finals, they have a great chance to beat any west teams even the lakers.. they have all the key to win. good outside shooters in drajic, herro, olynyk and robinson. they have defensive two way players like butler, crowder, igoudala, adebayo..
go bucks
nice bucks...
Lopez a superstar
this channel is legit! im a filipino i made a channel because this page inspired me.. heres my channel. its tagalog for ya'll pinoys out there! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE4at2V80s2H0SQlsq49iHw?view_as=subscriber
huh!? anu to bucks highlights? hahaha puro sa bucks lang e
Middleton Middle Shot Killed Cooled the Heats
Jeff van gundy should be fired, he is biased.
The bucks are the only team that disappoints me every year they had the easiest conference in Tha East!! They should've been sweeping every team
Tyler Herro 💪
Always a debate about who reminds people of the most of Kobe & after watching this twice & maybe 4 or 5 more videos it’s definitely Kris Middleton, mid range maestro, 1jab 2-3 jabs, spins, stop & pop, turnaround. Only if he was more aggressive more people could see the similarities, especially 2008-2013
Big fan of Khris.  He hasn't had too many of these moments.  Get hype my guy, get hype.
I’m a bucks fan and almost had heart attack at the end
Middleton with Giannis: 🧱  Middleton without Giannis: 🐐
no mvp and they still snatch a game. a coincidence or luck to win 4 str8 & be the 1st nba team to do  the impossible. if san miguel beer team in  PBA can do it, they can too,
this is bucks time highlights -_-
Am I the only one who thinks the thumbnail looks like the same person.
Giannis needs a Shooting like KD 💪👍
Hmmmppp Go go bucks
Bucks have to dig deep..gotta play with heart...one big game can change the momentum of the game...one game at a time..
Middleton w/o Giannis  45 points 17-20 shooting Elite Marksman All-Star Player  Middleton with Giannis getting wide open shots because Giannis is fucking triple teamed in the paint 6 points 2-13 shooting absolutely dooky is he even a basketball player, can’t tell if hes 26 or 46 in the face ass rookie vet playin ass Shit don’t make no sense to me... Oh and Lopez always been great shoutout him
Too much protest less practice - bucks going to be eliminated lmao
this nba tv really just skip the first 8 minutes of highlights lol
Giannis should be so embarrassed... if I was he, I'd sit out game 5.. he's undeserving to play in it.   He thought his team would be swept tonight, so he dissapeared!
8:03 nice
This is Bucks Highlights
Yo, Heat in 5. 😂😂 You guys really doubted Bucks. They don't wanna get swept, with the help of refs, again. 😂😂
Bucks better than without giannis.
im seeing kobe on middleton dont know whyyy
Yes the Bucks won this game
Tyler was awesome man!! Two 3 pointers in difficult circumstances but Heat will finish the series in the next game.
Middleton must be their Ace and Giannis must be the second star.
They're better without Giannis
Subscribe to my YouTube channel D3ire
Remember that Tyler Herro is from Milwaukee. :D
So this is the formula for the bucks to win. Giannis not playing.✌😁
Nail biter!
One sided highlights. Stupid video
Uh oh 😧 here comes the upset
Khris Middleton proved here why he's one of the best in the league, Bucks need to start treating him like the star he is
What a game
Everybody shooting threes like dunking
That's the reason why bucks is on top of the ranking in eastern conference ranking . Middleton and giannis
Well they needed those Giannis points before the injury to get to overtime but it was all heart shown by Milwaukee tonight. Total team win tonight and Middleton was clutch.
everyone saying bucks are better without giannis are so brain dead it hurts my brain. Giannis makes this team. Middleton played like a god tonight but after  game 5 you’ll see.
Milwaukee, just go home already.
Is this a bucks highlight??
if middleton plays like this they still have a chance in this series
I didn't see Middelton take one uncontested shot, he was nailing everything with a hand in his face, astounding. He willed the Bucks out of a sweep along with Lopez.
https://youtu.be/bZWIBDibD7Y Watch this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a game!
No team has comeback from a 3-0 deficit. Hope the bucks prove me wrong.
To whoever put the ad right before the video ended, here you go 🖕
Middleton save the day
Tyler herro is fucking goated
Just came to see what an arena would look like in a pandemic. Didn't realize how many ads I'd have to watch just for my curiosity
Lol they star player got injured we felt sorry gave y’all a win next game y’all gone
Bucks really struggle playing with HEAT.  Middleton's 3 was a lucky shot anyway..
Brook Lopez really showed up. His. jumper is so smooth for a big man
Future Nostalgia is a great album
As a Raps fan I'm hoping the heat win in 6-7 after the bucks wear em down. It's gonna be a tough series with the Celts and the bucks and the heat both be looking scary.  Raps vs Heat ECF Raps vs Clips for the storyline
Maybe the Bucks don't need Giannis and could be the unexpected burden of this team.
Damn I so wanted mami to win
Middleton hadbto take over
Tyler herro deserves his name.
Khris Middleton will unleash his own beast on Game 5 if Giannis doesn't play.
Cant lie Middleton got lucky with that shot, but man, Tyler herro, once some space is created and there is room for him to launch, all you can do is staunch
If you slow it down you can see it “bend” a bit it’s not a lot but the fact that it hurt him that much means it would be best for the Bucks to bench him and hope the team could win maybe another game without him and make him come off the bench if anything I wouldn’t play him
Khris showed up big time ✊🏾👏🏾
I’m amazed that the heat were 4 point away from sweeping one of the best teams in the NBA.
Dont blow up no 3-1 lead now
Tyler hero got that Reggie Miller clutch shooter gene in him
Tyler herro play like tracy dmc
I really said this. Without giannis antetokounmpo as The bucks #1 option are a better team simply because middleton is a baller bruh. Shooters and players who can make there own shoot win championships. I feel like for this to really work giannis would have to come up off that first option or come off the bench. If Middleton was the number one option they would shine. But if they continue to center their offense around giannis they're going to fail.
Bucks in 7
Tyler herro gonna be the next Klay Thompson man... He wants to guard the best player and is a clutch shooter ❤️
Once Paul Pierce declare that the Bucks are gonna lose they ended up winning. I'm tellin you its his fault lmfaoo
ESPN: Is the bucks better without Giannis?
I can feel Giannis going to pull a Kevin Durant I can feel it hopefully he doesn’t 😖
Middleton was great today. However, he played big minutes. Meaning he will be super tired next game. Therefore, he won't be as effective. They need Giannis to come back.
bucks is lucky today, but not next game ;)
GIANNIS to Warriors confirmed.
Why’d the first ten seconds of the video start at 4 min of the 1st quarter left
Is it just me or do the rest of the bucks play better when they don't feel that they have to defer to a {one dimensional} MVP/super star? George Hill (best %3pt shooter in the league) is shooting catch and shoot, instead of just open shots that boost his percentage. Middleton going to war, banging on the high post. Bledsoe crashing towards the rim. This team is clearly imbalanced. It's time to leave Giannis. They looked kind of like the Raptors without him
Tyler Herro be like "I only play Herro ball because it's my name"
This season sucks. The games have no passion and intensity. NBA games look like 24 hour fitness pick up games in the gym after 5pm. Minimal contact, too many pull up j’s, no presents in the paint. Every once and a while some one will wow you with their athleticism. Back in the day the paint was sacred. You would get an elbow to the face for coming in hard too many times. The only thing I like now is Malika Andrews. She drives me crazy with her curly fry hair. I used to date a girl in college who looked just like her. That girl is now my why wife ( love you baby ) .. I miss the old NBA!!
k. middleton? i see kobe on him!! carried a team without giannis.
why most of the highlights is with bucks?? wtf!😂 bias
Chris Middleton is Lowkey underrated but I feel the bucks need a better PG
Tyler Herro is the only reason they lost by 3. He almost saved the Heat
Fuck raptors
I mean they win  of course because the entire defense of the miami is solely focus on giannis, well i hope the coach of the bucks figure out what to do .
It really hurts BAD when you twist an already sprained ankle that why he hollered.
Yo Giannis maybe you should stop this SJW crap and start focusing on basketball?
The Heat forgot Middleton and laxed when Giannis was out. Spoelstra needs to make another adjustment. Hero is clutch and needs to be fresh in 4th quarter.
The bucks are gonna come back and this may seem crazy now but when they do and they advance to the eastern conference finals, you see, you see
the Milwaukee Bambis live to see another game. But how long til J-Butt and the Heat get them?
So y’all telling me giannis gotta get Injured for them to win a game shit sad
Khris Middleton and Bam Adebayo looks like twins in the thumbnail
the refs need to go away
Heat is consistent.
Why are these stars using Fake Injuries to get out of the game whenever they behind and feel no chance. Hmm
That lay up before the foul with that free throw before overtime would be the hot topic if they lost game4. Phew. Live to play another game. 😁
Tyler Herro is ROY  Change my mind
Middleton needs to come to houston
I'll bet if they checked Khris Middleton's locker, they'd find a voodoo doll of Giannis with pins in the ankle. Khris looked like he was waiting with his fingers crossed for a chance to be the #1 guy for awhile.
Bucks have no match with the heat
Chamba😂
Middleton proving himself to y'all haters, if Giannis comes back healthy, I can see him using this win as inspiration to go harder and maybe even take the series
Giannis for mvp my ass😂😂😂
There is still hope, Bucky! Never give up! Fear the Deer!🦌
Who remembers when ppl said Boston blow 3-0 lead vs 76ers 2018 when it didn't happen its not gonna happen  the will try in game 5
Middleton can lead I swear.
Bam Adebayo looks like Dwight Howards little brother
The Bucks without giannis is like the Boston without kyrie. They have just showed their talents and potentials without depending on their key player.. They dont need to adjust but to just show what they got. Well played bucks 🔥
Wtf 🤣 ginnanis was out and the bucks cooked heat 😂 man this is so crazy
Lucky Bucks...if ginnis never get injured miami might win this game.
To me bam adebayo is the second best passing big man, behind only jokic.! When the heat would run the offense through bam at the elbow and ft line, and have him coming off for dishes and lobs during the season. The heat were almost unstoppable. Do that more
These guys really knows how thumbnail should be😁😁😁😁😉
Bucks fans won’t wanna hear this, but Giannis getting hurt allowed them a chance to recalibrate and win.  Middleton really earned his All-Star nod this year, and Brook Lopez has revamped his game entirely.
Tyler hero putting a show what a guy
at the end of each highlight video, they should the leaderboard for points in the game
Hey Bud. See what happens when you make adjustments?
Its funny how a lot of people in the comment section says the Heat defense is built to go against Giannis. I mean. Of course they will game plan against him. He is the reigning MVP and possibly back to back. Any sensible coach and team will have his name at the top of their scoutinf report. Then some go as far as saying that Coach Spo cant adjust mid game as if the Bucks blew Miami out. Also, middleton was a little shut down when Butler came back mid 4th so thats adjustment fot you. It was a good game. A close Game. The bucks made good shots. There were some questionable calls here and then but, overall, the bucks played great down the stretch. Give Bucks the credit for stepping up this Game. No need to put down the Heat. Heat in 5/6 still. I think Giannis' injury is a blessing in disguise for the Bucks not because they were better without Giannis. But Budenlhoelzer finally had no choice but to adjust his game plan sincr Giannis is out. I think thats the biggest problem with the Bucks. I think coach Bud is the one that is not capable of adjustments. Lol
Tenks to injury bucks win ..no injury no win..so wats its means ..gianis is the ploblema..hehe
the first two minutes were straight bucks highlights
Tyler herro proving he deserve his name
MVP OUT.. THE BUCKS WIN😅😅😅
Goes to show how bad budenholzer is in playoffs, a forced adjustment is what it took to win this game. If you can win without Giannis that sure as hell means that you should crush with him!
I swear George Hill was open so many times and no one passes it to him. He can ball 💪🖖
ESPN tomorrow: Did Bucks win the game or did Heat lose the game
butler @ gianis " u want win ? gianis : yes butler : ok, buy me a cofee @ starbucks  gianis: ayy ayy captain
Looks like Giannis will be joining the 2 time champs next year in T.O. Hahaha
Amazing NBA Finals 🏀.
Bucks save one for their season. Rip gianni's.

Heat spent all their time preparing for Giannis...  They forgot about EVERYONE ELSE! 🤣
We need a T. Herro in the lakers 😱
Tyler Herro is the clutch GOAT
Giannis is the most overrated player to ever lace em up, and this game proves it. Bucks better without him
Middleton is a bad dude
Tyler hero is living to his name
Khris Middleton can't be stopped the guy is clutch under pressure. He deserves to be in the second All NBA Team this year or be in the all star next season
Skip Bayless: Bucks better without Giannis. Giannis is overrated. Colin Cowherd: that bucks win just got Giannis to stay with Milwaukee. But anyways, back to the LA Lakers and Clippers
MILWAUKEE Bucks 118 vs 115 MIAMI Heat
This Heat team is so good on both ends, made the #1 seed team hold on for dear life
So during clutch moments Giannis is just standing?
You knew the bucks would win when Paul Pierce said it was over for them..
Raptors Fans: "Giannis to the Raps!"
Almost got sweeeped
Cmon coach
Iggy gotta be in there 3rd quarter
Giannis: *gets injured*  Bucks: giannis is injured so now we get to play and get buckets.

SAS tomorrow - The Bucks need to bench Giannis and let me tell you why...
Can't believe this is miami's first loss in the playoffs.😬
Is it klay thompson wearing in black ? ?
"Hero" tried to live up to his name
This whole NBA is a racist organization that only admit Black players
Khris Middleton proving the haters wrong. He is really worth that 30 mil a year contract. lol
doesn't meant they are better w/o Giannis. they're due for this game. should have ended in regulation with Ante.......heat in 5 tho
Bucks in 7
Bledsoe broke Duncan Robinson 6:46
I thought this was a sweep. I mean no Giannis in the early game
Bucks can win a game without Gianis thats the true
Hahahha kawawa c giannis grabe nag arte
Tyler is a legit hero! He always made those clutch shots.
I know I ain’t the only one that sees Duncan Robinson traveling every time he collects the ball
I know Giannis’ triples are starting to sink in but he gotta continue working on it. That shooting form is awful to watch.
Someone give Brooke Lopez his props in this game please!
Dayummnnn they won without Giannis  That some shitttt
Big props to Middleton. Hope Giannis is good tho.
They lose on purpose today, if they sweep the bucks, giannis wont go to miami next season. 😅
Without giannis bucks is better and its a fact...I just heard it last night and now I got to see an example also
This should’ve been a sweep, but I’m not mad - I’m glad the Bucks got a game, and Middleton and Herro are clutch af 🔥
Nobody:  Tyler Herro: *Hero mode activated*
Am starting to get shaq and kobe vibes
Tyler Heero seriously trying to be the broom who swept the Bucks in the semis
Miami got over confidence when Gianni's injured thats why they losing. Next time it's payback time!
Lmao top comment has only 1K likes, nobody watches this woke bullshit anymore!
Enjoying all these rigged games 🤫
As a heat fan I was scared of giannis today he came out hungry if he wasn't injured he was gonna drop 50😂
The MVP aint even at the Game
CAN YOU PLEASE YOU HELP ME REACH 1K SUBSCRIBERS SO I CAN FUND MY SON'S BASKETBALL TRAINING...THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Heat ahd it in the bag...I think they relax a little bit in the Final Qtr. They didn't took advantage of Middleton being tired and exploit his defense.
Giannis wtf is wrong with you?
I've never been more ashamed of my city Milwaukee in my life. For those who don't know basketball is a set up just like WWE. Checkout Gematria effect news
The editor of this highlight is biased
who is this hero..super duper clutch men
Broke Lopez play also good
What if jimmy wins his first ring
Stop with these heat in 5, heat in 6 u guys have chuck's touch 😭
Bucks did good tonight but need to Crank it up to Max the next 3 games if they wanna move forward
bro let's just talk about tyler herro. period.
Good work bucks show yall win all this games not to fall like that strong and smart
So from my perspective they need to play five outs first and foremost. Playing 2k Donte Divencezo is vital to the bucks success. They shouldn't play kyle korver at all too much of a defensive liability.  Then Bledsoe is vital when he plays smart and plays tough defense.  Donte is defensive guard who can drive and shoot. If Giannis was playing he become even more deadly because you can't help of him and if you manage to stop him for the three he can drive past and get bucket in the paint.  Lastly, George Hill can be important when hitting threes and driving but if he don't pass or get others involved it will be all for nought.
Now they play hard 🔥🔥bucks das was beautiful playing hard 3 more to go
Shoulda been passing to Tyler Herro the entire Game 😒
Super intense
Wow
Respect to the Bucks for not throwing in the towel, highly doubt they win the series, but they regained some respect from the masses with this effort.
Nice one bucks
Gianni's figured his team was on the verge of getting swept so he took a dive. He's outta Milwaukee ⛹️
Miami has been throwing everything AND the kitchen sink to stop giannis with a gimmick defense but then they lay an egg once hes out. Maybe we should just sit giannis for the rest of the series 😂 miami wont know what to do
Lol, finally won without the MVP
Middleton ‼‼
The bucks ain’t go pull off a LeBron and the cavs 2016
Shoutout to The Starters 8:05 #wedgie Miss that show #TheStarters
All herros don’t wear capes
chuck: GUARANTEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Miami will really give the bucks the gentleman's sweep on Tuesday now#BLOWOUT
Wow, NBA is so fake. The refs needed to force another game.  Cantlet the MVP get swept in the 2nd round. That's bad for business.
Bucks win yet again
The Heat will most likely still win the series
Reason why Milwaukee won....... no giannis.... why??? Cuz in the last few games giannis always has the ball and also miss a lot of oppurtunities, he is trying to be clutch but its not yet his game, thats why now we saw less of missed oppurtunity resilt in winning. They must teach giannis to not miss 6 three point shot every game 😂😂😂
Ref decided who will the game. It couldve been a sweep for the heat.
They gotta trade Gianis for whoever they want now..hahahahaha
Shout out to Middleton! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BASKETBALL 1v1👉🏽  https://youtu.be/sP9DiOp5DXs WE GOT INTO A FIGHT !
Μπράβο ρε Θανάσαρε!
Heat sold they actually blow this lead
I love Middleton's game. Best I seen him play in the playoffs so far. Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson, my goodness!!
Boss Pashoutout kay Patricia Gaylle Mendoza. ❤
middleton has a far better offensive game than Giannis so it makes sense that he gets more shots
Honestly glad they didn’t get sweepers
Khris finally realized he got to be more than a robin. He has to be a Nightwing, Red Hood, or etc.
The heat better not blew a 3-1 lead
Bucks depend on Giannis so they step off the gas... Butler depends on his teammates so he steps off the gas... it’s a long playoffs so losing composure and balance is a probability
Bucks without Giannis is a good enough team!!
Middleton play like Paul Pierce
Hey guys check out this video https://youtu.be/OhiJa1N-gxo
Hes actually grabbing the right ankle Mike
No doubt giannis is one of the best players of the league  But because of him the team play is not working coz he always put in his hands more offensive play .. real talk much better if let go the bucks and finding the team who giving you the play that much better for your talent ..
When Giannis left the bucks got the lead
There it is, bucks problem is giannis
The refs won this for the bucks
They proven they don't need giannis
The refs are big help for the bucks.
Just watch your ratings going down lmao
ONE GAME AT A TIME
Woooohhhh! Milwaukee Bucks survive in Game 4. Even if without Giannis.
Miami is dull of defensive players.. And mr. Bam adebayo will be a future all star.. Good luck heat
Win or lose Milwaukee to the bone southside pussies sports ain't shit but sheepdog that ass 187 tuck trump
If the bucks tie the series without Giannis then it would be wise to trade him
if i was a betting man, Giannis is going to Miami no way hes staying on the Bucks
Wow, this played out similarly to last year's game 5 finals. Unfortunately if Giannis is ruled out for the rest of the series it may be the end of the road for the Bucks.
Miami so nice they had the game handed to them instead they gave it to them
Boycott the NBA
They finally won without Giannis.
Tyler Hero tho...media talking bout Middleton being a robin...hes more of the Batman in this series....news would be saying Bucks better without Giannis
ESPN: Bucks win without Giannis, which team is he considering to go to next season?
The MVP curse continues
Miami really loves scoring 115  G1 - 115 W G2 - 116 W G3 - 115 W G4 - 115 L
People keep comparing Giannis and this bucks team to the 2000s cavs. Lebron would have begged to have someone as good as Middleton on those teams.
This just proves that Giannis needs help. The Heat designed a Giannis-stopper system. But the Bucks needs extra star power that can carry the team without Giannis. Even Jordan had Pippen. Even Duncan had Parker and Ginobili. Even Shaq had Kobe. Even Kobe had Pau.
Is Giannis playing G. 4?
So Gianes is the problem?
Heat you don't have what it takes to be a champion
The problem with the bucks is they think ginnas lebron but he not he a center n thats facts 💯  not somebody that should be handling the ball harden was right he have no skill  just ran n dunk 😴
7:40 was this play not a charge, it seamed pretty clear to me, but I could be biased, and if it isn’t a charge please tell me why
Why are you going for the ball with 2.2 on the clock if you not a 3 point shooter and Jimmy Butler is about to grab it 🤔 be ya own teammate bruh
Bias why all the shots of mil are highlights?
they don't need a 2x mvp.
Lopez 🌦️⛈️
Series still alive
What a game
Since when does lopez hit 3s wtf
Giannis tryna escape being exposed ended up being more exposed when his team win without him🙄
Is this Bucks highlight? Shows the NBA is so rigged.
Bucks without giannis:im a savage Heat:
Giannis still a great factor for the bucks with or without him their aim is to win the game, win or loose is the key word that you can say in every team.
Because of the new adjustment that bucks made the miami dont know that middleton system so thats why they won great adjustment by the coach
It's  4-1. Finish  In  5
This channel is a bucks fan wtf!
Props to the Bucks. They earned that win tonight.  Heat in 5 tho
No giannis,no problem lol HAHHAA
Tyler Herro Was CLUTCH props to the bucks for winning the game tho
Playoffs is a game of adjustments. Spo and staff will be ready game 5.
Damn Paul Pierce
bucks no giannis no problem.. no mvp no problem....
hes actually grabbing his right ankle mike
Jae Crowder looks like a small version of Lebron,  but he's slow compare to him.  Whos agree?
At the beginning parang 3D lang. Haha
Middleton is better than giannis
This series getting me scared as hell
Pls change the name to bucks highlight
Giannis the drama king😂😂😂
Giannis is a bitch for that. He thought his team would lose so he faked out so he wouldn’t be in the swept game. Plot twist!
didnt even mean to make middleton go off like that just wanted to play nba mobile
Make Middleton a main man. giannis need to play center position
Is this a bucks'  highlights?
lol they actually are better without giannis wow
This Bucks without Giannis will be the first team to come back on a 0-3 deficit.
Giannis looks like he's going to be the new "Chris Paul" when it comes to playoffs injuries. Some guys just find something to hinder their championship hopes, every time. He'll have to learn how to play smarter and meaner. Regular season heroes, playoff zeroes. Call Charles Barkley for a pep talk because he knows.
2:13, nice 4 step layup brah
Series should be 2-2 but the refs are wearing Heat jersey’s.
Career-ending shame injured Giannis
His injury is fake...as a MVP, they told him to avoid the 4-0 shame
Luka doncic Played with a bang Ankle  Giannis just didn’t want it as bad  😂lol MVP
chris middleton gaming 💪
Fook the NBA.CHINESE COMMUNIST.
As a heat fan I hate how good brook lopez is playing. But as a basketball fan overall I like how consistent he is, he is lowkey keeping the bucks afloat on these matches
A definite safe bet to make about any of these playoff games is that the opening tip NEVER gets gotten on the first jump...I can't be the only one to notice this. Also, a twisted ankle is poetic justice for euro-stepping and traveling your way through the league. Lastly, Heat in 5...maybe 6 lol
Cancer si giannis.
Why aren't all signs in Chinese?
Middleton is nasty....
Can some Heat fans calm or comfort me. Because Im scared that the bucks can come back in this series 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Disgraceful.  Those who watched the game know that Butler was clearly fouled on a layup attempt near the 2 min mark. They reviewed it to see who the ball went out on, and there was clearly a foul.  Ball was given to Milwaukee.  The NBA is scared to admit there mistakes and put it in the highlights.  Game never should’ve gone to OT.  Another game decided by refs, and the league, who didn’t want to deal with their #1 seed Bucks to be swept by a 5 seed.
Hays Milwuakee Bucks highlights hanggang sa pag sisimula ng 3rd
The bucks 😃"LIVE TO DIE ANOTHER DAY!"😅🤣😂😁👍🏾💯🔥✊🏾🙌🏾😎🤷🏾‍♂️👀😬🤯😳😱🥶😭😑😒🥱🤔🤭
Why happened to my uncle jimmy neutron butler. Ayoooooo sweep dems deer
NBA BLM  the viewers are finished with this trash!
Their offense with Giannis is predictable
Heat roster is so damn unpredictable, as Butler said, anybody could go off any time. Too bad Robinson and Jae went off, and those clutch 3s by Herro giving psychological damage to Bucks. Onto game 5 to close it off. Heat in 5.
Middletown says: come on! Lets play it! The series doesnt finish yet,
Fuck..
Giannis definitely faked his injury
Bud needs to stop benching brook when he gets hot. Frankly they’d be up in the series if he had more minutes in the previous games with that level of efficiency.
tyler herro has that clutch gene in him what a young stud
I don’t think giannis was hurt I think it was an excuse to get off the court
tyler playing herro ball
Middleton been the best player for the Bucks this series!!!
bucks on survival mode.
No1 talks bout this rookie tyler hero man  damn dudes clutch
The Heat was built to guard Giannis. They didn't know how to guard the Bucks without him.
Iggy woke up dangerous:😈😈😈 22 minutes  : O points : 1 rebound : 2 assist:
https://music.apple.com/us/album/derrick-rose/1526961750?i=1526961751
Not a bucks fan but its just sad that fans are thrashing on their star for one bad series and forgot all the things he had done for them.
Giannis still the most important piece to Milwaukee Bucks... Imagine deducting his 19 points in this game to the final score if he didn't play
And they say this will be surely a rigged game....
Chuck literally predicted this
Heats need to put them away don’t give them no hopes 🤛🏾
Takeaways:  - Middleton stepped up, and he's gonna need to continue to step up if Milwaukee has any shot to win the series - Herro is a big time player, not just a sniper, pretty nice to see from a rookie - If I'm Coach Bud, I sit Giannis for game 5 regardless of how his ankle is. Think long term. Grant Hill reaggravated an ankle injury in the playoffs after he tried to play on it already hurt, and he was never the same player again. You don't want that from your young superstar. Also, you have the chance to experiment running an offense through a legitimate perimeter threat in Middleton - Bam is my fav center in the league. His improvement has been amazing. His free throw % in the playoffs has been miles better than the regular season and his mid range jumper is looking sweet. Add that to his already great defense, passing ability, & low post game
Yo Iggy was tryna kick giannis in the balls and ended up hurting him no ones leg comes up like that when contesting a layup NOT COOl
Lol
Giannis aka "poison" s tagaloy lason hahah
Jimmy Butler stans hiding in the bushes
That was a bogus ass call u not only bail out a terrible shot but in the playoffs cmon son 😂😂
Good game. Bucks should've of won game 2 anyway!
They speed ran the first 2 quarters
Bucks win but herro is so damn good
Great series
Aint done yet
Giannis to golden state 😈 let’s go heat❕❕❕
Heat defence designed to stop Giannis and not Middleton's luck 😂
yeahh 🤘
It’s  good for the bucks to get back into the series and take a game out of this
game 5 on inside the nba with ernie the escalator johnson, shakel the big gasoline oneal, kenny the airplane smith and charles the round mound ground of rebound barkley and its time for Gone fishing segment presented by FLULA BORG from germany😄😄😄
Can we please appreciate Middleton!! Underrated as f***
THE MOST DIFFICULT GAME OF EVERY SERIES IS THE CLOSE-OUT GAME.
Tyler herro and kris Middleton they both should wear 24
Heres the thing about this game. Giannis afraid of getting sweep thats why on this very 4th game, i dont know, is he intentionally got injure? And when middleton and the rest of the bucks won their 1st game against heat, giannis can return to game5 without worrying getting sweep.. Hahaha, funny move on the side of giannis
Bucks get bailed out by a terrible call.. how is that a foul on bam contesting that fade-away long 2 by Lopez when he’s sticking his foot out, which made him fall. Heat would’ve had ball with chance to tie or take a lead if that garbage call doesn’t happen. Players more than ever are baiting refs into calls, refs need to step up and stop falling for it
You can sense that the heat felt exhausted entering the 4th quarter the reason why they collapsed.
Bias Highlights
I can’t see the Heat losing four straight, Bucks need to be cleaned off the headlights they smashed into.
all bucks highlights huh?
Heat bench forgot that they had a foul to give. They could have won the ball game
it simply shows that heat did not prepare for a defense that Giannis is not the go to guy for the bucks
Bucks should trade giannis to warriors they dont need him. Lol
Hero SUCKS haha bucks won haha loosers
Looks like bambi was able to avoid fire for now
The real question is are the bucks better without giannis
No team in 0 3 deficit, right?   Go bucks, Make a "deer-acle" happen
If they want to win this series, the bucks should play more aggressively like in this game
That 3 from middleton saves the deer from roasting
Trust me Bucks is the only team that will firstly come back a 3-0 deficit. Mark my words. Bucks in 7.
Now Bucks play better without Giannis.
The bucks are finally waking up
The thumbnail is lookalike... LMAO
Bucks has no ball movement. Heat is almost the same as 2014 Spurs. There will be no game 6 for sure
Watagame
Giannis Injured Himself for A Reason To loss on Heat LOL
Remember this comment, they will comeback
Three clutch 3-pointers by herro and a heroic showing by middleton
Good for the Bucks.
Middleton the truth carry them bruh
On the back of Khris Middleton, Bucks live to fight another day... 😥
Y'all still thank the heat n 5 ????.
The bucks did it for Giannis tonight for the W.
If the support of the Bucks played like this the first 3 games, it would be 2-2, maybe 3-1 Bucks.  They didn't help Giannis at all.
Perhaps this game will make people give some respect on Middleton. Dude did everything he could to win this game. Also, I hope Giannis recovers quickly from that ankle injury. He's certainly playing better before that.
The heat are not prepared to play defence without giannis. But this will be a big problem for the bucks for game 5 if giannis will not play
if Giannis have played its 1 2 3 Cancun😄😄😄
I’m a bit disappointed on how the Bucks are performing. They’re not playing like champions currently! HERRO, damn
Nice game bucks congrats no sweept!
No giannis No problem
7:19 giannis doesn't
No janice no problem
Giannis not so valuable
Aight so instead of 4-0, it’ll be 4-1
Middleton is on fire.. literally on fire!!!🔥🔥🔥
the bucks and lakers will not play in the finals thats the plan.
the bias highlights 🤣
who needs giannis?
Why i have a feeling that Miami will blew the 3-0 lead
we survive nigga we survive lets buck lets go
Refs tried so hard to keep the Bucks in it  And what a surprise it worked
I feel like we're gonna be hearing "Herro does it again" quite a lot in the coming years
Watching khris here reminded me of kobe, hitting tough shot after tough shot
Dang!  I thought the heat had this.... choke city bruh.... or gentleman sweep for the bar owners revenue
Giannis didn’t start?
The Bucks desperately needed to do something different. It took Gianni's getting injured to make it happen
Read My name and subscribe  Dear, Stranger "Only one person who like this will one day be a billionaire"  "Good Luck"
Read My name and subscribe  Dear, Stranger "Only one person who like this will one day be a billionaire"  "Good Luck"
Bucks wins without Gianes.. wew
Pagnakikita ko si George Hill nakikita ko sa kanya si Dogie ahahha
I think Middleton is the next Kobe?!
Tyler Herro and Khris Middleton takes this game serious.
I like basketball most but TNT has far superior coverage.
4:36.......soooo that’s not a travel? Gotcha.
How beat these niggaz with Giannis but lose to them without Giannis
muntik pa ma 4_0
Nice for the bucks, but heat in 5 or 6
Tyler herro is something else
Been said Tyler HERRO is a future MVP.  Its straight facts he has more than what it takes 🗣🗣💯💯💯
Inner Kobe FTW
Everyone praising herro after a L but no credit for Middleton for stepping up when giannas went down
The ball has a good rotation when Giannis was out! just sayin'  Hope He's fine.
19 in 11 minutes..damnnnn.giannis...
Bruh they barely survived... its over for them
Middleton is on🔥!!
Wish NBA arguments were as subtle and calm as these comments
Dang seems like Eric Bledsoe fell off ever since leaving the clippers. He had so much potential 😬
These refs are so shit
Lucky win. Good game though.
Tyler hero gonna be a beast👀
Bucks just gotta keep being aggressive and MOVE on offense. Way toooo many times everyone is just standing around watching one guy try to score. There offense the past 2 seasons has never been about that, yet when they play a good team in the playoffs they resort to iso ball and thats not how there team is set up at all. Middleton is the only iso type player they got yet they do it all the time. Blows my mind coach bud doesnt see this and make adjustments. Also coach bud needs to figure out his rotations...bad.
Giannis travel to much that's why he twisted his foot. He gotta stop walking.
The heat obviously still in the driver's seat but anything can happen now .one more bucks W and we have a series
It's Herro time
HERRROOOO
Middleton saved giannis' legacy from avoiding a smooth sweep..
Jimmy be chumping guys. Why Giannis let jimmy take his heart like that? He just Quit on his team.
BigBetBob saved me
Nba couldn't handle seeing their precious mvp get swept
another wrong prediction. Mr. Paul Pierce👎
Ok I can’t be the only one who thought the thumbnail was the same person
I saw in game 3 the bucks played better with chris and brook leading the way..they open the court up ...no Miami should still win the series tho ..but they now have to play a different plan cause Lopez and Middleton have the jumper that Giannis does not
Middleton playing like KD 🐍
Miami lost👀....uh oh.....
Better team without there mvp..
this is exactly how i used to play nba street as a kid just all guards i remember thinking centers were the lamest position crazy to see it in person now
So Giannis is the problem. Middleton averages more points than him even before game 3. And has two teammates that averages 20 plus ppg this series. I don’t wanna hear fans saying he got no help when he’s the one underperforming as an MVP as a leader. You can’t point fingers to his team mates without pointing himself first.
Tyler hero we see you bro 🤙🏾💯
are the Bucks better without Giannis? or the Heat is weak without Giannis?
Remember bois, Denver came back from a 3-1 lead with Jazz. Bucks will definitely cannot do that. Heat in 5
Fuck the heat how they lose without giannis playing I was ruting for the bit now nah fuck them they suck that’s why they’re gonna get fucked up in the next round of the play offs
What a game for both teams 👏 hoping Giannis signs with the Heat at some point. Miami has also appreciate and provided silverware to talented athletes
Tyler Herro hooped in his T-Mac bag.
without giannis and the bucks win. wow. lol
ESPN: Bucks could force game 6 without Giannis.
I been saying the buccs should run their offense through Middleton
Coach Bud still has everyone running around screens and getting abused by Spoels.  Lucky to get this win.
Whats his Name "KHRIS" 👊🏾
hey guess what????? who wants duncan robinson to warriors!!!!! what it be like???? hahahahaha
Gianni's still scored 19 in 11 minutes
Much better without GA34
Heat finna blow a 3 - 0 lead. Come back to this comment when it happens.
Giannnis should have faked his injury on game 1
You guys can come back to my comment when Milwaukee wins this series.
got it done without the Greek guy.
Basketball has gotten soft. An ankle sprain wont keep u out of the whole game....A PLAYOFF GAME‼️...that they won by they🤷🏿‍♂️
The deer is injured know
When Giannis was holding his ankle that is one of those "can you see it" things because i swear that was his left leg lol
Don't play gianis hahaha
He packed it up when giannis got hurt
giannis: still playing  kris: I'll just sit down and watch us take this L giannis: gets injured  kris: Hold my beer
I dont want to sound petty but Jimmy Butler was clearly fouled with like 5 minutes left and the rules stated it was a turnover. Nba rigging again
Tomorrow on first take “Are the bucks better without giannis?”
One game at a time.
Guaranteed the bucks will come back and force game 7  just because the NBA is rigged and wants the bucks to win over the heat
I think I just lost 10 years off my life watching this , the bucks almost play better without Gianni's..I'm a bucks fan and can't believe the performance of this team
Bucks in 7. Book it
Kris Middleton need to play like this every game giannis is out.
We got next game 💪🏽
I’m not gonna front like I’ve been a huge Middleton fan, but he really stepped up this game. Dude is earning his contract. Middleton hitting shots like a prime Rip Hamilton out there.
I KNEW IT WASNT GONNA BE A SWEEP YALL HEAT FANS LIKE OH WERE GONNA SWEEP BUT NAH
If Middleton can have another good game and the bucks play tuff defense I see heat in 5
I smell 3-1 lead hmmm
Bruh Tyler herro is da truth hopefully dey didn't open dis series back up bucks play great through Middletown no cap lol stay safe out here RIP CB wakanda forever God bless BLM checkout The Main Squeeze🙏
I see people here who didn't even watch the game and keep on talking sht
Am I buggin or did it look like the heat were lowkey looking for that ankle on giannis
Giannis just make excuse lol 😂😂
That thumbnail tho 😅 cant determine if they are twins or what 😅
Giannis is the most overrated player in the NBA
Finally Bucks woke up from their slumbers
For the first time and forever the v Bucks avoid the sweeeeep. And hopefully heat win gameeee 5.
Middleton looking like Reggie Miller.
Tyler Herro 🎯🎯🎯 Heat’s playin with a lot of confidence. 4-1?
All bucks highlights
Lakers needs a herro or butler
First I Want To Say Congratulations To The Milwaukee Bucks On There First Series Win , Very Disappointed In The Miami Heat Organization This Series Supposed To Be Ended No Excuses
Herro is big time
OMG ...There's Been A  Khris Middleton Sighting..😂🤣 Obviously the One Player that left is messing up the Bucks Whole Offensive Chemistry..
Let's go to Game 7. I'm here for it
Greek has not been coming through for his team this series
While the bucks the 1st seed can fend off a sweep, the Lakers might not avoid it.  The Rockets are a bad matchup and they Lakers don’t have much options on their backcourt.  The Rockets are just gonna our speed them and can sweep the Lakers.
Giannas is not hurt that nigga just don’t wanna play 🤦🏿‍♂️
Refs vs Heat
just wondering where is Giannis??? 🙄🙄🙄
Those 1st half highlights was only on bucks team! Tsssk!
Giannis Antefkamfhsbdndkd is overratted! An mvp candidate and a dpoy with such an ass stats in the playoffs..lol..
The one game I dont watch and my Bucks won. Damn maybe I shouldn't watch the next ones either + #loveandHUNDREDS #fearthedeer
Hopefully Giannis can return in Game 5 and they  stay alive..
the heat is such a talentented but not a rigged team; so, they won't advanced- what has been planned is planned, i.e. The Laker winning the Championship facing the bucks.
Middleton is like slower, heavier KD, but still clutch...
Lopez is better than giannis in the 4th quarter
As I watch basketball these good games I think back to the warriors with KD they blow everyone out ptsd it what they gave me
Khris middleton channeled his inner jordan after hearing that giannas needed his jordan
There's should be Rookie of the playoffs.
Well they live to fight another day.
Tyler Herro is the most underrated player in the nba
OK, without Giannis, the team won...A killer bit awkward....
Refs😭
Fucking butler wants to take the last shot
Giannis choker.. Doesnt deserve mvp award 😅 coward leave the game. Looking for excuses. Such a dick
Heat just gave them 1win for Giannis.  Because Giannis will move to Heat next season.
Heat in 5
Full highlight but this video in first 5 mins its all about bucks. Quit highlighting video man your bias
Wtf was that last play Miami, better off trying to shoot from half court than trying to successfully land a hailmarry pass.
Not a fan of either team but man this was a good game!
Keep Giannis on the bench, win the game!
Fans of bucks. A lot of historic moments happened in the NBA bubble,  and for sure there will be more! Like a 3-0 comeback that has never yet happened! #FEERTHEDEER
I'd rather see Giannis go to Brooklyn with KD and Kyrie then Golden state. We got enough powerhouse teams in the west my Houston Rockets need a chance 😅😅
Yo Jack I Told U That Greek Freek Will Be Injured Smh U Bet BiG TOOO.....  WOWWWWWWW.... whole time I though I was texting my buddy
Props to bucks. No credit given to the phony mvp tho.
Lopez stepped up big time.
The absence of Giannis is questionable because of his ankle sprain .  Giannis: they win without me. So I'll go to Warriors next season
The Miami Heat Team issa a big big problem Omg 😳 Bron We Need Kobe 🥺Why 2020 somebody find me 7 dragons Balls Im Bout to ‘Make me a Wish Out This bih ‘ Kris Middleton You Did What you could Y’all Not Built like That Look who u signed over Brogdon Scary Hill OMG
Haha what happen to gianis the big head.. season 30+PPG  PLAYOFFS 3.1PPG  HIGH SALARY THAN MIDDLETON  no chance at nba finals
Dragic is so underatted and so unlucky Game 3- refs call a stupid call against him in the clutch too  Game 4-thats not a foul on divencenzo
such a joke. Heat in 5
Did Giannis duck on this one?
Check out the youtube channel "gematria effect sports".
The heat got robbed at the end lol
Its Ok, knock em off next game 😴
They should trade Giannis.
I feel bad for Giannis
If they actually end up winning 4 straight games I won't be surprised because it's fucking 2020.
Tyler Herro Being South Beaches Hero
Heat in 4 🤫🥱🥱
heat finally play a good team and get exposed for the trash team they are by the way the knicks are the best team in the nba they dont need a good front office or bench to win games enjoy watching the knicks dominate next season
BREAKING NEWS: Gianis has sprained his other ankle while in the locker room
Khris Middleton played the entire game 😐
Giannis really left his team. What a joke wtf r u getting paid for????
Milwaukee has a good chance now
Shout-out to the starters for that clutch wedgie finish at the end of regulation. Man I miss their show.
Is giannis gay?
it should be butler on midleton .hes heating up d kastminute why left him unguarded .anyways miami in 5
Screaming bloody murder! it's a sprained ankle buddy, come on!!
it should be butler on midleton .hes heating up d kastminute why left him unguarded .anyways miami in 5
Tyler herro is the next Klay thompson with his shot creating and his catch and shooting
The game, as usual has some dubious calls at the end.  Nevertheless, give credit to the Bucks.  They flat out shot the lights out.  Still, Miami will close this series next game.    #HeatDontQuit #herrosplash
No Giannis and the bucks win ?? Wow!!!!! That says a lot!!!
My opinion is that Giannis should improve or master mid-range shot. He don't need to shoot 3 always.  He needs to develop mid-range (Duncan boarding shot), one legged fadeaway (Nowitzki and Durant style) and mid-range jumshot (DeRozan) in order for him to be efficient and stable. Good coaches can check his game coz normally he's points are coming from fastbreak and one on one plays.
Everyone saying there lucky. Heat will most likely win the series,but the bucks were outplayed.
BUCKS winning without giannis....  harden: he' s the MVP??
Refs helped the Bucks so much in this game
I’m a bucks fan and yeah we are gonna loose most likely but it is nice to see a little spark of something positive (winning with Giannis down) from the team when they have looked so unbelievably horrible recently. Also Herro is a bucket, this Heat squad is insane.
Well at least they weren't swept lol Gianni's still gone and Heat taking game 5
And when heat win series, they gonna be like, "giannis was injured anyways."
Herp derp Khris Middleton is a 3rd option at best.
Bucks in 7
why the hell are there no highlights in the first half for the Heat? Who made this one?
Bold prediction: Bucks are gonna make the biggest comeback in NBA history.
Giannis, you are.... the weakest link. Goodbye.
Where is giannis🤔🤔..  In bench,
Bam Adebayo!!!
The game of bucks was good without gianis.just saying
espn be like : is giannis worst than BLEDSOE?
Middleton got the mentality of Kobe☝
Giannis quit during the interview,  the injury is bull crap... he shows he has no heart
bang damn right fear the deer
bucks look so much better with out regular season gumby
Poor Gianis, hopefully just an sprain ankle.
Middleton is a beast 👺
Giannis injured. He will play next game with injured?  Middleton is EMPTY NOW. THEY CAN WIN NEXT GAME?
Herro👍👍👍 the heat will beat the nuggets in yhe finals
It's either the Bucks will come out with the W humbled, or the Heat come out with the W exalted. I swear if this goes to 7, this won't be playoff basketball, it'll be a fucking anime fight.
Middleton carried the bucks ass
Heat will win.
GSW, Raptor and Heat be like: ohh we still have game 5 before preparing for Giannis off season. Hahaha
"he's actually grabbing the right ankle, Mike..." 0:57
Duncan Robinson has all star shooting skill. Mans stroke is nice. Reminds me of Ray A back in the day.
8:00 this is crazy I've seen this before but not in the clutch
So the mvp gets injured and the bucks win? Lol 😆 is
Bucks couldn’t go out like that 😤
Don't worry we're just being gentlemen😉
Kris Middleton brought that Mamba Mentality
Awts gege
Bucks coming back I’d probably die of laughter if the next 3 games go to the bucks lmfao force a game 7 at Milwaukee with the win 😂
Largest comeback starts now. Bucks are a first seed for a reason. Keep faith Bucks fans. Anything is possible!!!
Giannis lame for not being on the sideline with his team
Lol to everyone saying herro clutch. We don't have full arena of fans to bring the pressure, please wait until we get fans back so everyone starts to worry about hitting a fan on the sidelines again
I think duncan Robinson can be a better version of Marco bellinelli.
Bucks are better without DPOY and MVP.
Heat was robbed. Missed foul call for Jimmy, BS call on Bam, as Brook extended his leg.
Imagine bucks come back and win series without gainis..lol just saying..
This is lit.
Heat in 4 lmfao. Delusion ass Miami fans bruh😂😂😂😂😂😂
Respect to Middleton but the Heat were robbed.
Gianis best actor hahah
Not gone lie Chris Middleton looked like KD tonight
Defund the refs. Utterly disgusting calls against the Heat.
Refereee 2 3 times at the end helped bucks. We KNOW what we see!
Sad how giannis is the current mvp and the dpoy and scared to guard jimmy
Khris Middleton is the MVP and Lopez what a game.
Bucks played better w/o the greekfreak. Lol
0:47 Giannis hurt himself and you think the Bucks are done.
Bruh how Giannis mvp and his team won an elimination game without him smh . Giannis I’ve
It's never over till they down and out.. Miami could just start playing horrible next game, Giannis will adjust his game too .. If they can take it game by game and let Middleton be the star of the team for the rest of this series and let gianns be the pick and roll box out man they will definitely  make a comeback.  And if it werent for Giannis this game would have ended way differently That lil 19 did a hug amount qtr wise
Lucky day for middleton
Hero is my favorite rookie I ain't even a miami fan. I just like the way he plays.
Someone needs to hire the Heat's head scout.  They be finding gems.
Heat in game 5 boy and girl
Because of this NBA will give lebron the mvp after he beat the rockets tonight. Hahaha. I'm just trolling. . Anyways as we saw and learned on that game without giannis this bucks team is way harder to guard, middleton handling the ball is harder to guard than giannis with the ball.. Facts, with middleton the floor is really spread heat can't even build a wall.,facts,middleton with the ball is better than giannis with the ball because he can shoot and attack the  basket and can pass the ball, facts. What I'm saying for those idiots who thinks that this team won't reach playoffs without giannis is dumb. Hahah this team is better than the Pacers, nets, Orlando and even the 6ers yes the 76ers this team without giannis is better than those teams..facts.. Folks this is your dpoy and he can't guard butler 1 on 1 all he does on defence was help, Davis is more versatile defender he can keep up with any position from pg to center and of course the mvp award does he really deserve this award because of his stats? Because when he didn't play in some games in the regular seasons they won like 10-3 I'm not really sure but they have a good record when he does not play and it shows on this series that he is not as valuable on the team when the team that thier facing is a team that can defend. He looks like Ben Simmons... Facts..
Put some respect on my nigga Middleton 💯
bucks in 7
Miami Heat: We're going to sweep.  Middleton: No.
Middleton was lightin that hoop up bruh
The Bucks avoid a sweep in OVERTIME, that's how superior the Heat are vs this team.
They are better without the mvp eh?
We supposed to be blowing the heat out ain’t no way man
Bucks in 8
Middleton wanted to avenge giannis
That's got to be an awkward locker room for the Bucks
At least they can say they didn't get swept
Refs really like the bucks
Nice One Milwaukee Bucks 💪🧔
Where was Giannis?? I did not watch the full game.
I really thought that the Bucks were gonna be swept, Who else?
Why the hell does anyone think the bucks can win in 7 holy shit they’re so quick to change their minds after one game. And it wasn’t even a blowout
Anyone here thinking a reverse sweep or is it just me?
I will trade giannis but middleton not
now it's different... can a team come back from 3-1 deficit...
Am I watching heat vs bucks or buck highlights only
Heat and Clippers in 6 games in 2020 nba finals (and heat will win)
This just shows the Bucks are not all about Giannis. They're a solid team even without him.
Heat on 5 👌👌👌👌
https://youtu.be/eS493A7px0o  Anthem
Eric Spolestra probably wishing he had not used ALL his timeouts! Plus the Heat did NOT bring the same intensity to this game. Bucks wanted it more!
People who say bucks gonna win next match butter gonna dominate and rip the bucks ass😂😂 And giannis gonna get MVP at home watching heats play final
Bucks in 7
Hahaha pinagbgyan ang bucks pinagmumukha kasing kawawa ng heat hahaha kaya hinahayaan nlng hahaha dapat tinambakan niyo ang miami kung talagang di kau hirap wag na kau umasa bucks sweep na kau kawawa lang kasi kau kaya pinagbgyan pa kau para naman gumanda laban
Hero is a hero 🙌🏼
Duncan and herro was on 🔥 🔥 🔥 man the gm picked great rookies
Man hero is just rookie but he has ice in his veins!!! Let's go heat!
If Giannis plays game 5 and comes out swinging like the way he did in the first half ngl the bucks might have a chance 😬
😂
Still taking Heat to win the series
Bucks winning the next 3 games, watch!
I don't care what anyone says, giannis is a soldier. Guy was balling out while injured, which he never even acknowledged. His team just followed his lead and refused to give up. Man middleton, if this guy played this aggressively and confidently alongside giannis, this would be a series! I put some of that on the coach, who needs to involve these guys in the offense a lot more, not just stand around and spot up while giannis does everything
First take: Is Giannis overrated?  Stephen A: Hell No!! he is a victim of white privilege.
Thanks Buck you made me some $$.
Bench the MVP, get a win. 🤷
Heat in 5
Refs won the game
Giannis got injured from carrying this team so long, his body is starting to crumble.
Whelp the comeback begins.
mannn takes an OT to get W over the Heat..hoping for game 7
They need to play through Middleton. Obviously giannis is better but u cant win playing through giannis
Tyler hero would have ended the season if they had a timeout
I thought Tyler Herro would become this game's literal Hero of Miami.
Kendrick Perkins will not come on ESPN tomorrow
Damn they better not slip
This Shit far from over we gotta lock back in. Only idiots are dumb enough to be overconfident
It’s crazy to think once Giannis went down the team rallied up and won the game. They won it for them and Giannis and the city of Milwaukee 💪🏻get well soon Giannis 🙏🏻
Good job refwakee u got 1
Let's fuckin go Middleton  💪🏿💯💯💯 great historic won for you
If they play like this in first to third game then they dont need miracle.
Bledsoe play like he still in the 90s 😂🤣😅😆😁😄😭😭😭
Amazing how the refs won the game for bucks. They should be “gone fishing”!
The Bucks played with heart and desperation while the HEAT is just chillin with the 3-0 lead. That's just a delay for the series. I wanted the HEAT to lose 1 game before moving to the EAST finals. I'm worried going to the EAST finals with an undefeated mentality and then lose for the first time HEAT would be more focus in game 5 and close this out BIG.
What a game man the heat took thier foot of the gas after the Greek left ..
giannis sucks  to be honest
Blessings from Taiwan  🇹🇼😇🥰  Tyler Herro is ALMOST the hero to help the Heats wins Game 4 😉😜  I hope the Heats will WIN this series ! 💪🤩
The bucks played better team baller and more shooters to match shooters
Is that giannis fault that he re-injuried his ankle?
a  we defiantly not no worriers we don't blow 3-1 and we fo sho anit blow 3-0
Heat in 5🔥
well then, next game should be interesting
Skip Bayless: See! I told you Giannis is overrated!! 😂😂
The refs trying to prove they are more effective than giannis in the 4th quarter
Milwaukee in seven
giannis is trash. shame on him. milwaukee is better without him.
Lol they better thank Giannis for those 19 cause shit would’ve been a blowout 😂😂😂 plus HEAT didn’t even shoot that well
He’s actually grabbing the right angle mike 😅😅
I swear if the heat didn't have jimmy herro would have had a better rookie year
Bruh he literally hopped twice with the ball 0:10
Herro that guy is a hero with those clutch
Let's be real the bucks just got hella lucky
Bucks in 7
Hero an Duncan just nasty
BS call on Dragic at the end, heat deserved the sweep
tyler herro gonna be an all-star in the near future. dude's cold blooded
Calling it now they finna blow a 3-0 lead
Bucks in 7... Well idk maybe heat in 5 lol
If ever there was a chance to come back from 3-0 is this season, because it's a wild card for every game and we've seen a number of times already that momentums can shift very fast. The bucks were crushed on the floor and Heat didn't finish them off. Middleton got out of slump, defense played better, and if Giannis comes back rested after playing 1 quarter in 4 days, the Bucks would have a good chance to win game 5. If that happens, it's game on.
Like Bam said, we played like we were up 3-0.... I wanted that sweep soo fu*cking bad. But with that loss, the bucks get more respect and we'll get even more respect for beating them.
9:15  what a great play by Spo
bucks in 7
Bucks fans so humble
Alriiight, it's Heat in 5, then. Bucks were just lucky because of Middleton. But there's still no way in hell they can rally now.
WTF HAPPENED TO ANTETUKUMPO ? BACK THEN HE EASILY AVERAGE 30 PPG NOW WTF?
That's okay he is only one game is three games to one go Miami Heat game 5 beat them and get this out of the way and go to Eastern Conference... Go Heat..
Chris was getting on ass cheeks
It was just one of those nights where the bucks were a little better. A few questionable calls? Yes, but the heat were up before they went scoreless for a big chunk of the 4th. Still, Heat in 5
BUCKS IN 7. RAPTORS IN 7.
How was that not a charging foul on Divencenzo Dragic wasn’t in the restricted area and he beat him to the spot
Giannis' last game as a buck?
Refs got paid ‼️‼️‼️
Giannis was slowing them down if he would of been in the game still they would of lost to the heat 🏀🔥
Jimmy Butler got the heart of a Lion!
Lebron is still my MVP
Middleton saved the Bucks, the best Somali player.
It is a miracle if they win 4-3
Iguodala stat line: 22 minutes  1 reb 2 ast 0 points 🤣
I feel like Middleton can play like that consistently tbh
Milwaukee should trade Middleton, korver, rob lopez for cp3
Giannis is overrated will never be the face of the league 😂
Giannis was about to go for 40+ in this one. Props to the Bucks for showing heart. I’ve been trolling all the Heat fan pages on FB after they were talking reckless last few days 😂
Good game for the Bucks but they can’t win this series if they keep banking on Middleton to be a iso demon
Damn they all super human. I cant make a shot half the time with no defense on me lol while they can be in air get fouled and still make it. Wow
I want 4 0..😭
tomorrow on ESPN  ESPN:can the bucks win the series without Giannis
Tyler hero gonna be great
Props to the Bucks for stepping up. Middleton finally woke up.
Great performance and win for the Bucks, but damn Herro is something special fr
i said it bucks in 7
As a Raptors fan I'm glad the bucks won tonight 😂
Middelton out here playing like kobe, since when? i'm referring to his play syle cuz he be hitting some tough shots
Middleton really underatted people always trashing but I can understand him not being That guy he can be
Dony give a team that already done life cause now you've given them a breath
For those of y’all who still can’t tell: Khris Middleton is legit. Still can’t hear me? KHRIS MIDDLETON IS LEGIT!
Hi
Hope Giannis gets a speedy recovery. Middleton went off. Props to them.
Look at herro man so inspirational Making the nba look easy as a ROOKIE
lopez clutch
HERRO is something speciall!!
Can someone explain why they play better without Giannis?
Media: Is Giannis holding back bucks?  Me: Who put them in this position in the first place?
Dammm let’s goo bucks
thank u giannis for believing at your teammates at the very first putting 19 points in 11 mins creating the heat and momentum in the game. props to khris for playing very well and to the team for stepping thats playoffs basketball ladies and gents!!
Cant wait till flight reacts to this
Well ig no sweep
Miami never shoot mid range shots
Props to Louis Gossip Jr Jr, I’m mean Middleton he played a great game.
I knew the bucks weren’t getting swept after Charles Barkley said they were gonna get swept.
I hope nothing major happened to Giannis. Regardless if the bucks lose, I just pray that he’ll be alright for the longevity of his career. 🙏
Screw you,  you are woke.  I hope you morons go bankrupt.
The paul pierce curse is alive and kicking😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Heat will win this series regardless if Giannis didn't get injured or not. Even if he returns, they'll still win it. Just one game. Hard to close out teams. But what a great shot from Khris Middleton.
ESPN: Should the bucks trade Giannis and start Marvin Williams next season?
Herro the new Ray Allen
Credit to Bucks for playing with heart, even though they will DEFINITELY lose this series
Hahaha dapat dna mag laronsi Gianni's, para makapag laro ng maayos ang bucks 🤣
Herro said y’all must of forgot what my name is. Rookie got ice in his veins.
Mr.Overtime middleton do his duty tonight 💪
"Tyler Herro has one too many Rs in his last name."   - Shea Serrano
The bucks is not coming back they are losing next game they got lucky
Why can’t the Bucks always play like this?
What time is Giannis going to next season?
delay foul call for lopez.. refs took over when giannis got injured. 🤷‍♂️
Bucks still alive and it was scripted 😂✌️
Middleton finally playing up to his contract
As a Bucks fan...Heat in 5😭😭😭
Puro ra man ni highlights sa bucks naunsa
no sweep memes now huh? lmfaoo its cool the refereetards gave bucks the win
Bucks are trash with or without a healthy Giannis
That was the best I’ve ever seen Middleton play. Too bad he can’t EVER keep it up for more than 1 game. 😔😔
Bucks are gonna be a problem if Giannis leaves, Middleton doing that work ✊🏾
Heat vs refs.
All those amazing BANG calls sound like my favorite commenter Mike Breen
Lmao they avoid getting swept without giannis in the 2nd half
Middleton outscored giannis even before this game,but somehow he still got more blame than the mvp
Giannis still leaving for Miami or Golden State. Doesn’t matter if they win 1 game lmao.
espn ready to slander giannis' name because they won without him on the 2nd half
Rip all the heat fans that said over in 4
Herro is a beast and he's only 20 that's crazy
Bucks held on without Giannis
Next game Heat vs Bucks and the whole Referee Squad LOL
Heat can Guard Giannis so Tough but the other Bucks Players not so Tough
RIP HEAT  BUCKS IN 7 FEAR THE DEAR
Mga kano mag comment kayo sakin pls 😢💔😆
Giannis big time bench player let's go!
Mas maganda pa nilaro ng bucks ng wala si giannis di ba? 😆💕
I think bucks make a history comeback win.
FEAR THE DEAR. BUCKS IN 7 RIP HEAT
Lmao
dreymond is right..lopez is the key here..
Tyler Herro playing like he takes his name serious.
Bucks playin better without giannis😂
Heat vs The NBA
This is the first time I've seen Middleton clutch in my life lmao where was this all other games down the stretch ?
Let's see if they can win 3 more in a row though 🔥 LOL
Bucks will be the first team to comeback from a 0-3 deficit
Bucks are gonna win the series now that Pierce said it was over for them
Hero > butler today
F in the chat for those who bet heat in 4. Heat in 6.
They should think Charles Barkley for helping them with tonight win.
Herro is gonna be the future
If only Middleton would play like that consistently
Great game by the bucks, they really put up an effort to not get out.             Heat in 5.
giannis got hurt cuz he's new line sucks, freak 2 ftl
Bucks fans: wE aRe fO sHUa cOMiN bAcK ta WIn da sERieS! Reality: Unlikely... as in “iMMa fO sHUa wInNiN dA lOTteRy tAmoRrOw” unlikely.  0-3 series comeback has never happened before and nothing about this Bucks team (or last year’s Bucks for that matter) tells me they are in any way the historic team Bucks fans and random ESPN “experts” have made them out to be. They are the most flawed no. 1 team ever seen and the fact that they’re down 1-3 to the Heat, that they got rolled 4 straight last ECF by the Raptors and couldn’t even take it to game 7, says it all.
I had faith dat we wouldnt get swept but ion kno if we gon b able 2 make a comeback
Full of drama, giannis injuring his ankle, bucks playing well without giannis, bucks surviving another day, wedgy shot, Middleton taking over
Middleton unlocked super saiyan 3 this game jeeez
Breaking News from every non Bucks fan:"The refs really want the Bucks to win" Edit: Guys relax i was trying to make a joke not start WW3 lol
That rule where Butler was fouled but it was Milwaukee ball needs to change NOW. Sick of these rules always going the Bucks way
Tyler Herro is very underrated as a rookie
Atleast bucks win one game.. We dont need   the broom.. haha....
Giannis should have went back in. Ankle shit is a cop out
Only miracle can save bucks..but i cant believe👎👎👎👎
Miami not undefeated. Oh well. Bucks in 5
Bucks in 7.
I'm still shocked, nice ending :)
Great win but It's a little too late for the Bucks now at this point.
Heat in 5🔥🔥🔥
Less goooooooo
From a neutral perspective, just imagine the memes if Milwaukee comes back from down 3-0. I highly doubt it, but just imagine!!! Haha!
Imagine if the Bucks somehow win the series
As a Bucks fan, this series has been hard to watch but it will at least sting a little less if we lose the series because at least we weren't swept.
Damn Kris Middleton carried the team like he wants the W!
Heat had a let down after Gianni's left but we'll be back. Butler didn't take any shots in the fourth till almost the end of the game. We can't win like that. Heat in 5.
Hope Giannis is okay, he's one of the league's brightest stars
Kris and Herro are clutch
Good job bucks! Still in 5 tho for Heat
It's much easier to come back down 3-1 than 3-0
They left Kris against Herro so long before helping out. I'd rather double that right away and get the others to shoot it.
Damn Khris Middleton clutched up huh, he should win the MVP instead of his greek teammate Still Heat in 5 tho
Herro and Middleton man
Draymond is somewhere in the parking lot calling Giannis if they lose this series 😂
What a game
As just a fan of basketball, I couldnt even watch OT. That last minute or so of regulation was a travesty. NBA officiating is a Fn joke. Two uncalled fouls on Jimmy resulting in Bucks possessions and a clear charge taken by Dragic was instead called a block. Putting Milwaukee on the line to tie or win the game. NBA and NFL have become WWE and AEW. The blatant rigging is a turnoff from the product.
MIDDLETON IS SO CLUTCH OML
bro the people on the thumbnail look identical lmao
What's the point of the 2 minute rule if the refs can't change calls...bucks had a great game but i think this series is over next game
Gg Milwaukee but Middleton can’t be Kobe 2 games in a row
Kris Middleton finally showed up big 🔥🔥🔥
ESPN be like tomorrow  "Are the bucks better without Giannis?"
Jimmy dropping 50 next game heat in 5
"It's over for the Bucks, Miami just got much toughness bye bye Bucks 3-0  -PAUL "The Truth" PIERCE
It wasn't a sweep... That's sad It'd be a gentleman sweep., so cool. 😌
Who else thinks it’s gonna b Heat in 5
I think Giannis and James Harden don't deserve the MVP. LeBron deserves it. Giannis and James Harden are good in the regular season but when it comes to the Playoffs, they choke. Meanwhile LeBron is good in the regular season and can maintain his greatness in the playoffs. Just LeBron's longevity in the Playoffs is outstanding to see!
All the heat fans are quiet rn
Bucks stay alive to play another day. Still think Heat will win in 6.
Man they should be giving the ball to hero more often I like jimmy but he really sold on a clutch shot
bucks + ref vs heat
bucks will win this series
Fun fact: No one in the history of the NBA has come back from a 3-0 deficit in the playoffs
For once, Jimmy Butler was a non factor
The heat will be on fire next game! I'm sure they take it personal. They really wanted to win. This game will surely fuel them🔥🔥
Things we learned from this game.  Bucks are better without giannis  Bucks actually played like a #1 seed K midd proved he deserves that contract K midd should be the bucks go to player looking at how he played today
the bucks literally won without Giannis, and they say Giannis has not supporting cast, people around the world is obviously pushing Giannis to join the warriors not only to feed curry more rings, but so they can talk crap and trash to other teams and say "its over for the league", and waste our time watching nba, I miss the old competitive nba man
Middleton stepped up big time in the absence of Giannis.
tyler herro is clutch asf
Herro Clutch Bucketssssss
you never know what can happen.  take it game by game
The heat formula was designed for Giannis, once Middleton was in charged it was a whole diffrrent game. Im a heat fan,Jimmy Butler said in today's interview they gonna close em out and we know they just got more hungrier and they can ensure u a game 5 W
The only way Giannis finally got help is by not playing.
Ih
Bro that doesn't matter they just need one more win
I'm a Raptors fan and big respects to bucks even after giannis went down, get another 3 dubs I believe in them
The Heat should of won
I’m a raptors fan so I want Milwaukee to win more games to tire the heat
Tyler really made some "HERRO' plays down the stretch lol
I’m a Huge bucks fan and we probably gonna lose the next game😂 The bucks played better without Giannis because Heat defense is made only to stop Giannis they weren’t ready for that adjustment. I still have faith tho🤷🏾‍♂️
Heat goin bounce back 🔥
alright heat in 5 then
Keep in mind they did this without giannis for 3/4 of the game.Herro was pretty clutch though but Middleton out clutched him,very enjoyable game
Ref ball at it's finest
hello, bucks. nice to FINALLY meet you guys in this series, it had been a minute haha
All this to lose in 5 lmaoo
I'll give the Bucks heart, but this series should be over next game.
Giannis seen the sweep coming and wanted out.
Fans look like they're loving it.
Heat in 5
Heat played horrible in the 4th quarter and last part of OT. Bucks did their job and that’s our fault. But don’t worry we’ll close it out on Tuesday. GG Bucks.
As a Heat fan, I'm not mad we lost. We still played great and made some clutch plays. Let's see if we can close out on Tuesday. Let's go Heat🔥⚪
Bucks in 7
That was an amazing game, back and forth, that foul before OT was BS lol dragic was in legal position there should have been no foul called, anyway great effort by the bucks to leep the series alive, herro hit some unbelievable shots and middleton finally came out of his shell
Paul Pierce: This series is Over!  Middleton: You sure about that?
Miami better not throw the series their up 3-1 come on Miami I betted $150 they would win the series
Man only if the heat got a sweep it would be a tribute to kobe cuz the last 1st seed sweep was the 2001 lakers sweeping the spurs
The Heat got screwed big time. The Heat got screwed because the NBA didn't want their "Next Big Star" Garbage Giannis to get sweeped
No sweep
Great game Milwaukee playing tough for giannis 💪
Khris Middleton been bailing out the Bucks for a while now...
Well Milwaukee finally won a game I'm actually a little surprised, I'm still taking Miami in 5 or 6!
Bro Giannis probably just wants to go home rn
So nobody’s gonna talk about that ghost call on Lopez at the end
Giannis has called off his search for a home in the SF Bay Area.
Bucks in 7. First Nba team to comeback 0-3 Mark my words.
Will world of bucks be the first team to comeback from a 3-0 deficit? LeBron could never do that with cleavleand
I hope the 1% that reads this will follow their dreams and never give up. My dream is to become a successful Youtuber.
Giannis:"I'm taking my talents down to South Bea-     Khris Middleton: "I don't think so buddy"

MILWAUKEE BUCKS AVOID THE SWEEP
Now is when people ask "Are the Bucks better without Giannis?"
You guys work fast hot damn
The Warriors Gm going to send Deathstroke after Khris Middleton

Heat weak asf
It's ok that the heat lost but the eric Bledsoe foul on jimmy butler being ruled BUCKS BALL IS ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT NBA NEEDS TO CHANGE RULES cuz at this point it's not even basketball
Bucks in 7. I said this before the series started
Damn Heat 😂😂 actually Giannis is a problem in Bucks
Heat still gonna win because they lettin up to many threes
I am a Lakers fan and I was so disappointed when the Heat lost...
Congrats to Milwaukee for the W today still a long way to go but shout out to Middleton he played with a lot of heart in this game and hopefully it's nothing seriously wrong with Giannis
Tyler Herro had me bout to break my TV 😂 Good game, good win
Middleton turned on allstar mode
aw i thought bucks will gonna go home.  HEAT in 5
Middleton is in giannas’s shadow, when he is just as good when he wants to be
Continue that Milwaukee
Ngl Middleton played his ass off today. He said give me the damn ball we’re winning this
BRUH THEY COULDVE SWEPT
It’s Khris Middleton’s time to shine for Milwaukee. No Giannis, no problem!!
Cute heat in five
Wow
Bucks Fans finna say”YALL SLEEPING ON US WE GONNA COME BACK”
Hopefully they can come back(bucks)
Tyler Herro is clutch hits two straight threes  Thanks never had this many likes
If Giannis and Moddleton played 40+ minutes regularly this would be a different series
Tyler Herro underrated asf, dude is a sniper 🎯💯
ITS NOT OVER UNTIL ITS OVER
I’m happy Middleton woke up and realized that he’s supposed to have a big role on this Bucks team in order for them to succeed. Edit: shoutout to Tyler Herro as well, such a gift to take and make big shots especially as a rookie
Middleton's stats  36 points 2 steals 48 min 2 turnovers  8 rebounds  8 assist
Middleton: Look at me, I'm the Captain now
Miami Blows a 3-1 lead
middleton and herro went off this game
Bucks win
KHRIS MIDDLETON IS A GROWN MAN!!!
Bucks Might as well sit Giannis Next game....Played better without him😭
NBA gonna drug test Coach Bud after seeing he played Middleton over 40 minutes
Let’s go bucks
First I swear
give them 1 win atleast lol
Khris Middletown tried to channel his inner Kobe to push a game 5
EEE
Middleton just saved the Bucks from total humiliation
Just got done watching the game tv
Dammit we really have to watch 1 more game of this series😑😐
AAA GG
Kris saved them from getting swept, but they're still losing the series
Giannis fakes injury because heat gonna win💀💀

😂😂 Heat fans, all 5 of you, don't be surprised if you end up blowing a 3-0 series lead.They beat you without their MVP so stay tuned NBA fans because it's about the get interesting.
Goran sucked yo
Not going home just yet for the Bucks
What a victory
Bucks in 7
If I’m Bud and IF Giannis is available next game. I’m running more for  Middleton than Giannis. Giannis will get his numbers just on his activity on the court alone. ESPECIALLY in the 4th qtr Get Middleton going and JUST MAYBE,MAYBE..👉.MAYBE👈this series ain’t over
Giannis in the locker room, (on the phone): So Curry, can I join you and your bros in Oakl...  Middleton comes running in: YO GIANNIS DID YOU SEE ME WIN THE GAME, WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN THE SERIES!  Giannis: 😳
First
Kris Middelton is so fucking ugly GOD DAMN 🙉💀
ESPN: Is Giannis Holding the Bucks Back?
1
Giannis is not the 1st, 2nd or 3rd best player In the NBA he is #5. If James Harden gets past the LAL he is better than Bron and Giannis. If James Harden gets past LAC and wins the championship, (which i highly doubt that) , he would be the best player in the NBA. 🙉 FAX.
Even though the heat lost man herro is so clutch
