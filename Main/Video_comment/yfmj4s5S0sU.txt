Talk to me like that and watch how quickly I hang up 🥱😂
ngl i see why he said it, people lead with their ego’s
I was looking for a mentor some people recommended me but just saw this short video definitely this is not what I’m looking for, I’ve never close a deal with someone that talks to me like that
AND CUT!!!! 🎥🎬 NEXT VIDEO! ACTION!!! 🎬🎥
This gotta be staged.
get fucked - lost 30k over 100
The wolf of wallstreet smoked you Bud!
Yea or Nay. Amazing!
he teaches  to not be antagonistic but he’s literally the most antagonistic i’ve met😂
These are the exact scumbags i would buy new underwear from if i had just shit my pants...i stole that but its accurate
As a salesman myself I'm telling y'all Grant is not a salesman he's a pushy con artists who makes more money off the salesman he hires vs his own actual sales skills. Stay far far away from business owners like grant they'll leave you in the dirt.
King of the warm call
If I heard the dude say “get his credit card rn” that deal would be destroyed. Grant is a con man.
Meanwhile his closers only make $3k off this deal
He's definitely a closer but at the very end he's giving me Richard Pryor vibes..Lol
A sales manager said the same thing to me once, i told him yeah sure i will spend the money elsewhere thanks. 😪
And recently he admitted these were random prices built on nothing in order to fund his real estate deals. Fucking Charlatan
I dont know how people cant tell when they're being sold, I really don't
I challenge you to live off 4k a month. Rent, utilities, insurance, phone, and food and gas.
Hai M r Grant do u wants or no pls can u tell me,
Holy fuck grant cardone is such a bullshit artist. I’ve worked in sales my whole career and nothing he says is of substance.This wouldn’t work in a mall kiosk let alone a $30,000 sale
Loser
And if you’re a salesman, you know that this video is a marketing
I AM HOMELESS
PLEASW FIX MY TEETH
PLEASE PLEASE I AM HOMELESS PLEASE FIX MY 1989 CHEVY VAN
PLEASE HELP ME
I AM HOMELESS
Wolf Of  Wall street Vibes
Cardone needs money bad right now.  The economy is terrible and he knows it.
Things that didn't happen: Nick made a million dollars.
Sounds like wolf off Wall Street
Nah id walk
Grant is garbage
This sales tactic only works in the south where you can just double-dare billy bob to do something and just call him a liberal if he refuses
Corny and greasey
This is the worst douchey salesmanship ever. This is for those dudes who don't get that Patrick Bateman is not a role model
Found this bad boy on r/cringe. This was my old job and I quit because of the cringe.
I didn't know the office r doing a remake "con-man" edition
Cringey guy
Embarrassing.
This is the fakest video ive ever seen. This guy screams slimy conman
Douche alert
Wow you're making yourself look like the worst amateur salesman with this video. I'm shocked you haven't deleted it out of embarassment
Vids like these make me a firm supporter of abortion
"Get his credit card right now" and that should sum up GC in a nutshell
get his credit card now
I'm pretty much convinced this call was staged
Sad that people like this scam folks outta their money if you let someone talk to you like that you got issues
You made a whole video about 100 dollars
promisses from the scammer itself...
This is stupid
Wait 30,000😭
Huh, that’s funny because yesterday I saw the short where Grant said if you weren’t worried about the $200, you could save by writing off your home office you would never make it to 1 million 💭
dude you sure care about that $100, hypocrisy.
Grant give me a job
This dude has more red flags than a Chinese parade
THIS IS STAGED!!!!!!
"Take his credit card right now" before he has time to think and  changes his mind
Yikes
All good until he shat and put down his own employeee who did 99% of the work...even joking...so unproffesional and arrogant..embarrassing really
What kinda phone was that??
If anybody used the word "begging", I would've ended the call then and there. Irrespective of whether it was a good deal
So successful in sales that he needs to become a Youtuber. Hmmm
Yes or no man
Slimball conman
The scum of the earth.
The face he made when he heard $100!   Lol
So full of nonsense....Get real..
No.
I’d never do business with Cardone. Man’s a scam / crook!!!!!
If you’re not worried about money when making a deal then you don’t need to be making a deal
Trumpet footer!!! The customer just wanted to “get something!”
Get his credit card? How about let’s finish up the formalities
His an arrogant sales man and style won’t sell to everyone
As soon as I hear that southern twang coming through my phone I'd hang up immediately
Get his credit card 😂😂😂
Trump gets destroyed for this exact thing with trump university
Just found out jeremy miner NEPQ 2.0 cost like 4-5K, he copied michael Olivers natural selling course, wich is 300 bucks.. some Are con men, some are honest.
And he saw no return on that at all and started living out of his car 6 months later
It shows none of u guys work sales lol
Hahau get his credit card rn
Felt like I was watching wolf of wall Street
Ain't nobody gonna make you a million dollars, off your 30k. If they could they would borrow 30k and make a million.  You see this crap on the trading desk back in the 90's
But your interested in 100 dollars...
Fighting for every dime😂 would have looked sick if he said no.
We don't have any more (of your money) to give you. GET THAT CC#
Wolf of Wallstreet vibes...
Get his credit card rn 😂😂😂
Is grant Cardone university still enrolling?
Telling me I need to beg on the corner gonna lose my service
Cardone university lol
Bullying people into deals isn’t a great sales strategy. If I heard someone say that to me I’d hang up. Grant just preys on the weak and ignorant like most conmen.
'get his credit card RIGHT NOW' lol.
30k for course 😂
Can I transfer my credits from the Trump University to the Grant Cardone University?
mental warfare is the the world we live in...
I'll come down to your office and knock your teeth out if ever talk to me like that again!
Nice one
This man does not make millions buying real estate he makes millions selling you promises he just made $100 extra for 20 seconds of his time
Get a credit card right now before he finds out we fleeced him out of 30000
Wack
Please don’t try this. It only works if you’re famous and rich, so you have branding behind you. Lol.
"You really care about 100 dollars?"  "Do you?"
This is as fake as it gets.
This is a fake call
Could’ve just paid for the man’s lunch , dosent change it either way right ?
Get his credit card right now 💀
One of my clients wanted an apartment to go from 350k to 250k I literally laughed
Gives me Wolf of Wallstreet vibes🤣
Good at talking bullshit
You sold lots of tapes and scamed people
Rube
All of you broke mfs telling cardone how to sell 😄 🤣. Please stfu and scroll
This guy conned every one with his BS and pretending to be a millionaire and all to sell a course. Lol. Dumb ppl deserve it
U not getting my 100 bucks but u can have these...     DEEZ NUTS ! 🥜🥜🥜🥜
That's how much Cardon University cost?
Good attetude
I really hope this dude turned his 30k into 1m… grant needs to post this guys progress 😂
I bet anyone $100 that if the guy called Grant's bluff and walked away from the deal over $100 we wouldn't be seeing this clip on YouTube 🤣🤙🏼
Oh boy would I love to see Chris Voss negotiate with Grant Cardone undercover 😆
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never keep talking over someone ….wtf is he modeling after ?
Wolf of Wall Street vibes
He needs to get more videos made about him And his ways :)
Andddd…. It’s gone
always my favorite clip
And he lost every
$30k to a millionaire over 3 years, I'd love to talk to that guy one day to see how successful grant was on his commitment to him smfh I bet he's lost the whole 30k which makes sense why he 😁 now needs his $100 back asshole con artists!
If conversation is one sided you need to hang up the phone
This guy. What a weird flex. He saved $100.  If Grant Cardone needs $100 that bad he should be begging on a street corner for it.
And I bet that guy never made that 100 back using the university
this should be under "Cringe" on Wikipedia
I know you guys think it was a con and he was contradicting himself. To me it was very impressive how he flipped the frame of the negotiation
Lol I closed $30k in 2 emails today…med device baby
I think Nick was trying to be Grant and Grant just lost over Nick either which if Nick is the consumer then he should get the $100 off if that makes him happy and makes him get the product that is just a straight Savage 💯💥he's not trying to give him no money up the grand traits doesn't make or break it so Grant why don't you cave in the answer is he's a top dog
Grant the SCAMMER
I would have a greed with Cardone on the $100 dlls and ask for $10k discount and ask him… yes or no??
"Get his credit card right now"
😂😂😂 the con
And that ladies and gentlemen is a closer!
what in the wolf of wallstreet kinda scam artist bullshit is this
Tried this at my sales job. I got fired, and I didn’t even get the deal 😂
Lol in reality... salesman would of coughed up 100 dollars to get the deal.
So many Know-It-Alls here in the Comment Section.  "That's why you're there (in the audience) and I'm here (being watched by you)." -Donald Trump saying that he'd go into Network Marketing if he ever lost it all again.  This is Grant Cardone, one of the WEALTHIEST PEOPLE who love to help and teach people how to make money work for you... People who don't like him most probably feel like they're much better than him, but have not even proven ANYTHING yet. This guy over here is EVERYWHERE on Social Media helping change people's lives and he's almost 60 Years Old. How about you, Know-It-All?
Car bone just made 30000clear warch this 👦
Some way this guy bought jet for 18 people needs cesena 210 red flags Spooky Jordan.....hustlin
Sounds like wolf of Well Street......hustle
If he was the big man he says he is and money ain't a thing why does he want that 100 so bad kinda sounds like he bullied him in to it
Wolf of wall Street strat lmao
30k for bs
This crap is cringy. They would have heard the dial tone talking to me like that.
Gant is a BEAST
Poor guy just lost 30k
I'm a life insurance salesmen and I'll tell you right now that is not how you want to sell anything 😂 he practically called his client a bum.
That’s not how to do business this shit is so crap
All these fools on here saying how wrong grant is. End of day he closed the deal. Guy could have declined. It was a clean deal. Exactly why most of y'all will never get anywhere in life lmfao
This man is wonderful...
FAKE
Im just sitting here laughing because I know half the people here couldn’t sell a prosthetic leg to an amputee.  Meanwhile, Cardone can sell snow to a snowman and the snowman will walk away happy. Hes dialed in and doing things on a bigger scale than any of us
G✌🏿 💞🌎💞 ✌🏻G
Try to pull this shit off with me and you are gonna hear an earful, get bad reviews  all over everywhere, and big and thick NO.
such a sad man
Slinging that snake oil
What a plum
This was definitely staged
Mark my words Grant Cardone will be broke sometime in the next decade. You always see it with these con artists
He got the script from the Wolf of Wall Street film, hilarious
Douchery.
This shit is all staged ..... This dude is scammer...
Lol what utter horseshit 😂
Same thing to dude in the suit. If $100 don’t change it one way or the other, then why bother him about it. Give him the deal con man. He was hustlin guy on the phone. If they’re rushing you over the phone, it’s a con. He admitted it in the beginning, “we don’t have anymore money to give you”.
Dude just got scammed out of 30k over 3 years 😂
😂😂😂😂
Hurry get his credit 💳 card right now before he changes his mind tee hee! 🥸
So he grilled the other guy to give me money. Nice
Easy to call the tune when you've got millions and you can go elsewhere.
He sounds like he needs the 100$ 🤣 what a con man
That 100 dollars was the poor dudes commission
This didn't age well for this schmuck.. complete douch€
Love the haters. love the haters here.  Imagine going into a restaurant for a $30 dollar meal and saying “I’m not sure this is going to fill me up. Can you give me a three cents discount, please?”
Everyone's is hating but at the end of the day Grant has money and has made more sales then all of u. At the end of the day salesmen don't force anyone buy things. If buy the product, that's on u. You allowed yourself to be sold, you can force someone to be sold
Sounds like some bullshit
Grant is the worst
Well he got scammed
Staged
“How to steal 30,000$”
Lol lots of broke keyboard warriors here, get a life boys.
Get his credit card right now...
If someone were to talk to me like this, I would not purchase anything from them.
If the guy selling cared that much about the $100, he should be begging people on the phone...oh, never mind. It would have been a nay for me.
On the other hand, you almost let $100 stand between you and the deal. The customer was happy with $100 as the decision maker and you said $100 doesn’t do anything either way, so why risk it? edit: I see other comments already called out this fraud for this dumb strategy.
Am always asking a discount. That shows the person cares for the business. If 100$ change one way or the other, then why is he not giving him $100 discount? And the crickets are we hear now
Damn with 30k I could make a million ?? Lol if I don’t make a million do it get to slap grant cardone for being a fake if it was that easy everyone would be a millionaire all these money maker gurus on YouTube are just full of 💩 💩💩💩
Sounds like a pyramid scheme
Grant chucks this b.
It’s the Brit in me that makes me think fuq no the deals off, you aren’t speaking to me like that
Biggest scam anyways
Horrible management! 100 bucks don’t break the deal for 30k. And on top of that ruins the rep for the company that they won’t negotiate and plus they’ll cut you down and insult you. They probably lost untold amounts of money plus all of his friends money, now was that worth 100$?
Wolf of wall Street in the flesh 🤣
“The only thing you’re gonna regret, is that ya didn’t buy more. Sound fair enough?”  -Jordan Belfort right before he scams someone
Con man
And to this day he is not a millionaire, and just out of pocket $30k
Scamming people over the phone 101
People who are frugal keep the money, people who aren't, well, you can guess what.
“Get his credit card rn” 😂 😂😂😂😂
Another Andrew Tate
“Get his credit card rn” 🤣☠️
No one does it better fucking over a customer asking for 100 bucks off 30k like Grant Cardone , I would have said go get fucked
Y beg for the extra 100 .
"Do you know who this is?" -"no.." "This is Grant Cardone!" -"..ok...still no.."
Con man
I'm getting wolf of wall street vibes
I would of said no and hung up the second he started answering the questions he was asking me he made his money conning people idk why people watch him
Cringing at the boiler room tactics what a cornball
Setup
How to be scammed in less than 2 min
New title : how to scam someone out of 30k
he cut out the part after where the guy was like no i don’t know who this is
I’m gonna send him 30 grand as well. That’s a great return.
Yikes not a good sales person
I got fish 🐠
I dare you to talk to a Dutch client like that
Scammer
Definitely should’ve taken the 100 dollar discount.
So that's grants minion selling his "university" classes? I'm assuming this guy will then become another minion selling the classes. Soooo yeah that's basically a pyramid scheme.
Amazing energy!!
Looks a lot like the wolf from walstreet
The next Jordan belfort
I don’t know where embarrassing your customer actually works. You’ve just pissed off the other person.
Scammer 💯
The way he says get his credit card now... jordan belfrort vibes
Oh god  guy is all fake
Try to get like that in this market now
Bro this guy is a joke !! Start off right now from nothing n let’s see you get to the point your at now !  Move to a different state and start from scratch n let’s see how it easy it is ! It’s only easier for him cause he has millions now
Love GC!!
I don t give this Man 30000$ 😂😂😂
watch Boiler Room then come back to this
Grant is genius everyone hating is broke.
I used to think this guy was smart   This video made me realise that he is not   There are lots of better ways to deal with a USD100 price objection than this
Takeaway close...nice
Wit he's paying 30K to join the university? Damn .... and Brent didn't even  want to take 29000 I'm gonna fused lol
Nay
Close the deal. A+
When will we get a movie where Jon Berthal plays Grant 😂
Lol 😂 thank you for the show, flash news hotshot this is not Hollywood, this is real life…
SCAMMER MANIPULATOR 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️🖕
Stage
I'd definitely say no, because that's obnoxious
If 100$ don't change anything, then make a discount and you will make the guy happy 😁
i can’t wait until his time on the internet is up
I never understood the strategy of insulting your client to hook them. I recently let go of a project manager for my 2 million dollar home construction because he had a similar attitude. Actually , even worse if you can imagine
Yeha this reminds me of when the wolf of wall street were he was  Using "aggressive sales tactics"
How to close the deal > be Grant Cardone
It’s always dope to be able to save extra $ even if it’s a couple dollars it adds up
Biggest scam artists
The way he says ‘GET HIS CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW’ is so fucking funny to me and I can’t explain why 🤣🤣🤣
As a new sales learner I found this video helpful but all the disrespectful words for a m potential client doesn't make sense to me
Thought he said to never use your full name because no one cares
He called you a bum and you gave him money
This scammer always selling lies
Con artist
WHO IS THIS VERY STRANGE WHITE THAT KEEP APPEARING ON MY TIMELINE UGH A WANNA BE WHITE WALLSTREET 😑 GANGSTA LORD HELP HIM 🙏🏾 😆🤣 $100,000,000 MILLION TIMES OVER HELP HIM
This is a really good Jordan Belford impression
I just watched another video of this guy tell a kid to not say his full name when trying to sell and then mf says his full name💀
Scammer.
Hey buddy you trying to call me and act over the phone real quick
And on the flip side why would you want to lose a customer over 100 if you are going ro make him “millions” lmao such b.s
Lmao, learned this the hard way but 100$ is like a million bucks to these scammers, guess why they pressure you so hard into giving up on that 100$ discount. I’ve seen top conn artist like this in an event that I was taken to 2 years ago and this is the same tone and attitude they use ☠️☠️
Id never do business with a man if he talked to Me like this my first time meeting him. I’ve done a lot of deals, this is not how you build your connections/network
Snake oil salesman
I hate how ppl try to get any lil discount like that.. i guess they feel good spending it thinking this is the money i got to keep by low balling some bs
“Street corner to beg on” 😂😂🔥👌He was thinking was that too far 💡👌🔥That man is a genius 💡💜
If a 100 dollars is worth that much to you as a big company, why are you yellow at the person with a small business that they shouldn’t worry about $100
Manipulative
He talks like he has en ego
Grant is a badass
Scammers be scamming like never before. No shame
Fake call
Grant cardone university for 30k my man just lost his 30k shoulda just bought a house with that money and rented it out
This guy is just a puppet who carries jesuit agenda’ wake up wankers
Grant Cardone, scammer of the decade
This is embarrassing to watch
Bullshit program...!
Cardone University is total garbage it's literally Grant cardone tooting his own horn for hours on end Jesus there's like tidbits of good nuggets but the majority of it is ours upon hours of Grant cardone stroking his ego what a f****** waste
I took grant class back in 2003 in las vegas he was great to learn from
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍👍
So Scammy it's unreal
Trifling get his credit card info so we can destroy his savings 😆
The fast talkers are the ones you gotta watch out for. The pressure you into doing something you don’t want to do and you end up regretting it later.
Yup, talk down to the customer.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
When I run into a guy wanting a 100 bucks off I just raise the price 150 bucks then give him a 150 dollar discount..works every time
They only got the sale bcuz of Grant not bcuz their sales tactics works!!
He said get his credit card right. Not right now.
cisty Pellegrini
When people start talking to me like that…. I usually start thinking a Bull shitter
I just wonder what he says when he doesn’t make them a million dollars
This guys a fraud
Dodgy second hand car salesman…. Awful person.
He just did it cause it was Grant Cardone.
“Get his credit card right now” 🤣🤣
30k for 3 years of bullshit
Ponzi scheme artist!
Wolf of Wall Street springs to mind
"Get his credit card right now" what a scum baggg
Sounds like some wolf of Wall Street type deals super sketch
He's selling his own university for 30k? How is this legal? What a weasel. Charlatan. @grant cardone is a charlatan.
Anyone whom im spending 29,900$ on gives me shit and asks me to beg. Im beatin the verbal shit out of them
Yeah not gonna happen. Yay or nay…you ask me that and it’s always going to be a nay
Don’t ever intimidate me, this is sheer disrespectful, please don’t treat your clients like that, you never know where the business can came from.
This was cringey. If I'm the salesman I'm going to laugh and give him the $100 (0.33%) discount. We're all happy and shake hands. I'm not going to berate the person.. but this was for TV. Not even close to reality.
He is a scam , sheep follow him Not lions
Gotta love all these dopes who think they understand sales better than a millionaire who does it for a living. Stay ignorant fam.
This dude is hella aggressive I can’t imagine getting sold on something like this. Imagine working with this dude I would be annoyed as fuck. Money hungry ass dude.
He says he makes millions in real state, why is he selling entrepreneurial courses? Dealing with people for 100 dollars should be a waste of time if you are that rich. Real millionaires like Ray Dalio, Frank justra, warren buffet share knowledge for free, to give back to the world. They don't sell seminars, or promise to make you rich if you invest 30k. BS. 😒
He will get everyone's credit card and move to Switzerland were you can't extradite him.
“$100 doesn’t change it one way or another”….. You know what it will change though? The sound on his end of the phone when he hears the click and dial tone!
This guy sounds exactly like wolf of wall street
And that's a professional scammer in action. D-bag
I've been in sales for 7 years now, this is either staged or an alternative universe...
"You're worried about a hundred dollars, you need to be worried about a million!" Says the millionaire
Used car salesmen vibes
Isn’t this the guy that said you can just 10x your 100 million
$30,000 for what!??
Lame
Get that credit card number now
Rule number one, never make a fast deal where you are the one trying to go up in value.
So the course is $30,100.00 🤔 and he guaranties that he can make him a million dollars…at least he’s got that on video👍 Trump wasn’t that dumb to video any guaranties with his course…🤣😂🤣😂
In the words of a famous crip.  HE’S A CUSTOR!!!!!
Wow
This is the modern wolf of wall street. “Now john ima need u to buy 10k shares”
Cardone university
You know who this is? No It doesn't matter who this is
“Get his credit card rn”
I’ve worked in sales and marketing for many years and these types of guys are the slimiest people you’ll ever meet. Wannabe wolf of Wall Street and anyone spending 30k in 3 years wouldn’t be worried about 100 bucks this is obviously staged
You’re amazing Siri absolutely just sold them by his weaknesses phone is weakness got it sold them all
Anyone remember donald trumps university?
Something about this guy just doesn’t seem legit…..
I would love to work for you. And close those deals . That’s just a challenge I would love to do.
Get his credit card right now
Scammed
My boy got husstled
There's a bunch of haters in this comment section who don't know shit. Watch Undercover Billionaire season 2 and you'll see the real Grant Cardone. This guy built a million dollar business in 90 days with none of his resources. All of you haters are clowns that don't understand a thing about sales.
Lmao What a SCAM ARTIST 🤣 😂
In reality no one cares about you, they just want your money and they will tell you exactly what you wanna hear just to buy you in.
Pretty obvious its scripted. Dude is an asshole, ain't no way any business is willing to lose 30k over 100 dollars
That what a con artist does lmao You basically just showed the whole web how much of a scammer you are
That don’t work for everyone if he talked to me like that I would find him and make him eat those words
Just checking back in. Who here thinks grant actually made that guy a million dollars?
Remember kids, you can be rich, but still be a total fucking loser.
How dumb do you have to be to fall for this guy? He's one step removed from a monorail salesman
The guy is a joke, no idea how he gets any attention
The whole selling space is about selling courses to people selling courses trying to sell courses to people selling courses who teach others how to sell courses…
If you guys don’t think this is an effective close, you probably can’t sell shit lol
Hey!!!!! Why did you take down the MILLIONAIRE Booklet  off youtube!!!  I listened to that every single day!!
The car dealers always say this and I always tell them to please take it out there wallet and give me the $100 directly, then you see how fast they shut up
If anyone talks to me like that. I’m hanging up. Not selling anything but 🐂💩
Get his card right now how do people fall for this shit
That money is gone.  What a conman
What a waste and bullshit call
Wow
He never got the million he was promised did he
Grant is the man, y’all don’t know shit about sales shut up
"We don't have anymore money to give you" "imma make you a million dollars with Cardone university) lmao
These people are scumbags.
Just close the deal if someone talks to you this way, what a POS
I would of told him no.
Balla man how does one simply want to go Cardone  university
Grant Cardone reminds me of wolf of Wallstreet. When Leo learns how to talk people out of their own underwear lol.
Dude 100$ on a 30k deal ain’t shit. He isn’t lying Foreal. Price tag is a price tag. Don’t like it then leave
He make 100 bucks in a few seconds
People don’t speak to people like that when asking asking for $30K. People hustle people outa $30K like this.  Run 🏃
This is legit the worst salesman I have ever witnessed. Imagine embarrassing your potential client like that
This man got beat up alot in school
Yeah but did he make Him am a millionaire
I just saw Wolf On Wall Street in real life 😳
Scam!
Well done!!
What a tool this guy is. He loves the sound of his own voice.
Jordan Belfort of 2022
Cardone is a legend and this video is a classic!
It’s funny looking at all these comments bashing a man who is a billionaire, because he knows how to sale, but all the comments are talking about how he is a terrible salesman
Man’s was trynna keep the 100 for an onlyfans give Him a brake haha
I love how he thinks this will help his reputation
Sell that fish!!
For sure didn’t end up buying
A million dollars in 25 years. Maybe 😂😂😂
He works great nothing but a dial tone
Watch out for fast talkers
Dudes course is 30,000. But now only 1,500 a year what a great deal
If the customer wants a 100 dollar discount , I’ll put the 100 in myself to make that deal happen ijs
“Get his credit card right now !” Lmao
The difference when you don’t give a shit whether you get the sale or not 🤣🤣👍
That “get his credit card right now” 😂
I had to buy a car this year 🤯 went to several different dealerships.. if they care about their money, we should too. That’s my policy. I still ended up saving $3k by shopping around and getting a 200 mile car  I’m going to pretend like I lost that $3k and put in the stock market
😍😍
Not even meet in the middle? This is peer pressure and bullying
Talking so much yet saying nothing
I need to  enroll in the university to master Real Estate to my finger tips
So nick if you are watching, did you get a million return on your investment ? Let us know please ?
Never let someone tell you you’re going to be a millionaire over night.   I haven’t been selling nearly as long as Cardone but I think that’s very scummy to say “I’m going to make you a millionaire” that’s something ametures do to try and push a sale.
“GET HIS CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW”
Imagine asking for .3% off of something
30k for 3 years?
A disgusting individual
I am a magician that raps and Grant inspires me!
How tf he let himself get ripped off like this😂
If you get bullied like this why the hell would yo spend your money here
People in the comments have never done sales. Dudes dropping 30k and is nitpicking $100 bucks 🤦‍♂️
This is literally that scene from Wolf of Wall Street 😂😭
I don’t even know how people can listen to that amount of bullcrap
I don’t understand what’s going on
The wannabe Jordan belfort
Fake ash
Laughs in fired
looks like ben affleck
Poor guy, just got scammed. If they don't give off wolf of Wallstreet vibes idk what does
Man is straight outta wolf of Wall Street
This may not be a call center scam in India but this is for sure what American Scammers look like
Reminds me of the wolf of wallstreet clip where he’s on the phone and everyone’s gathered around him laughing while the guy on the phone is getting fucked over
Get his credit card real quick lol
Get his credit card right now…. 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
But you were fighting for that $100 the whole video how you gonna tell him it doesn’t matter
He really said “do you know who this is?”  Ew.
Scam alert
Get his credit card quick
I’d walk away if the owner spoke to me like that, no matter how rich I was.
Nice now all they need is his cars extended warrantee
I don't have 100$ but I damn sure would make this call like a 2 hour thing then when it cones time just hang up on them.
He a snake
This guy is like a moving company broker. “Get his credit card right now “
Staged
Leo did it better
Fake
If a business is saying $100 isn't that big of a deal then why are they worried about it so much? Make the customer happy and business will boom....
These just seems scammy.
This phone calls so f****** fake. Also if that guy's limit is 30k on his credit card and he's paying up front for 3 years worth of education he's doing well enough he doesn't need this get rich quick scheme
I see a bunch of experts in the sales world commenting on this haha bet y’all don’t got a million in your account? Y’all laughing at card one for making 30k lol jokes on you
*Gary Vee at a garage sale:* "$5..... Can you do $3" *Grant:* "if you're worried about $2, you need to go beg on a street corner"
Wolf Of Wall Street 2.0
This man told him to find a street corner to beg on if he cares about $100 bucks 🤦🏽‍♂️. You won’t get anywhere talking to people like that. And when he says you know who this is it doesn’t matter who it is. he watched the Rock wrestle to much. Some dude is just going to trust you over the phone after you tell him that 🤣
Sounds like a scam
How he makes him a million Dollar? Someone can explain please. This man looks fishy
Really? GC is a peasant salesman. MFR can’t close a door.
If I ever pick up the phone and someone talks to me like that imma troll tf outta them, make them think they made the deal of their life
Never trust a guy that wants to sell you something and do your own reaearch. 30 k and he gonna make him a million? Sounds too good to be true so prob a scam
It doesn't matter !!! -The rock
Ladies and gentlemen, the “Jordan Belfort” ordeal.
Reverse psychology 101. That man on the phone will buy something he can't afford in a heartbeat if it made him feel like a king in the meantime.
Wolf of water street
It's not the $100, it's the control of the relationship. Who is telling who. That's what the $100 was about. Authority! Grant won
He just wolf of wallstreet'ed  his ass
@GrantCardone the con man!!
Is this an add for Wolf of Wallstreet 2??? 😆 🤣 😂
Gosh I hate sales...
Slime ball
He said this is (his name) acting like everyone this dude talm to know who he is
How fake do you want this?  *The entire office* - yes
A total set up call just for the camara🤳
Oh wow you’re a good, Sike!!! Bm You can’t close the door
Best scam artist of the century
I would drop the phone as soon as i hear this grant idiot n
Is this the new Gordon gecko?
I love sales closed a 24k deal on Saturday and make 14% commission 👊 and that’s a daily 💪
This guy would get embarrassed on a timeshare sales floor. I can’t imagine he knows how to build a trust worthy relationship within 5-10 minutes of meeting someone he just met. And close them within 2-3 hours on something they didn’t want until they met YOU. This dudes just rich and talks a lot. And it’s obvious he’s taking money from someone around my age.
30k for what, classes?
Would like an update on this customer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Close and shut up
I’d reply ,, if you’re willing to lose a $30k deal over a 100 then the 100 does matter grant right ?
Get his credit card RIGHT NOW 🤣
What does he sell?
I hate this dude for real lol
This guy is a tool. You're really gonna tell a customer they need to beg on the corner because they don't wanna pay your asking price.
holy s*** he really just ripped this guy off in real time and posted it
Class act conman
He just stole that poor kids cheddar lol
Anyones natural reaction to hearing someone talk to them like this is immediately “I’m getting conned”
What I will forever hate about sales is the superiority complex some people display in trying to manipulate people into buying things. Unless there's no other way to get sales, I totally detest this
High pressure used car salesman.
I'm on Grants side clearly it worked. Maybe not all the time but maybe Grant could see it was a fish on the hook who was asking for a tiny little piece of worm when he's got a long night crawler in his mouth. Grant is a boss. I'd love to have him deprogram me and help me become a winner. God bless you Grant, your team, and everyone here!!!!!
Good
I agree with most of the comments saying that being disrespecful to a customer is the worst thing a sales person can do. However, i believe that we are missing the fact that this customer says that he is ready to purchase a $30k shit if they make a 100 buck discount.   From my phone sales experience, that customer is  A) probably lying, and the 100usd discount is not the deal maker but something else is, he just does'nt wants to tell Or  B) he is ready to buy but he just wants that 100 dollar discount just to feel like he is a good negociator and is getting something out of the sales person.  Or C), this thing is all staged.  I sale vacations over the phone, i know nobody asked, but still :)
That didn’t look like a phone call on screen. Was that a YouTube video
What happens when you don't have consequences in your life.
Even a 2 year old kid will figure out that this scammer is a fraud
This reeks “you that broke you need it back”
Bruh lmao pathetic
Won't work with everyone. Its stupid
Pyramid scheme asf
You talk to me like that, I'm hanging up
Makes the guy a million whilst making himself 10 off same deal
Scared money don't make money 💸
Scam artist.
After just landing a six figure web development deal, we can verify this is NOT how you land a 30k deal. Good luck to the entrepreneurs out here 🖤
I'd say no.
Old president and new both r fucking ass give me a young boy and I’ll b happy no more 70+ fuckhead wanting to go back to a unsustainable era of the world
Ewwww
Greatest con artist of all time
Sounds like a scammer to me lmao
what a scam artist. it's about the principle. if 100 is nothing, you shouldn't bat an eye giving that discount.
This is so staged haha, grants marketing of himself get weaker every year
Set him up for bankruptcy
Scripting from The wolf of wall street
This guy lol..
100% bull. You want problems in business? Talk to a self-righteous guy like this. Work with a guy like Grant Cardone.  Because, yeah, he'll possibly take you further, but you'll hate your life, hate your future, hate your team, hate your career and hate your money.  Somebody said "if a person talks to you like this, you're being conned", and I couldn't agree more.
Killing it
sounds like a triangle scam
"close" the deal
At the end : "get his credit card" lol
Im not giving my money to someone who talks to me like this hell na
It was never about the $100. Clearly the dude on the phone just wanted a salesperson willing to spit on him and call him scum
Whats he selling?
POS definitely just used his words to conn that man
Seems like a scam
This is why I’m not a salesman
That's kinda wolf of Wall Street type of s**t. 😂😂
Damn, this guy really wanted to keep that $100. Must mean a lot to him
Try negotiating a 30k Injury Settlement lol
Yay or nay? Really?
I mean hes spending 30k over 3 years if hes worried about 100 he does have problems
39
Get his credit card right now .  A true sales person.
That was horrendous
As much as this guy sucks, he's right. On a $30k sale, $100 is nothing. It was probably going to be a foot in the door for more negotiations and this guy stopped that.  Or maybe this was all scripted cuz most people doing $30k transactions don't sweat $100.  But then again, maybe it was legit. I dunno.
What a scam . You never just close a deal over a phone with not knowing anything . Thats the biggest bs ever .
Sounds like a used car salesman.
i hate this man so much
And now I know why I never trust this scam artist
Grants a scam. Just because you have money don’t mean you ain’t full of it.
That is not how you end up with happy customers
Yo I have 180k saved will u plz make me a multi millionaire? I’ll do whatever it takes
All of that fancy talking can be silenced by one button.
How to make 1 million dollars: 1. Don't give Grant Cardone your hard-earned dollars 2. Develop a skill 3. Start a honest business after years of experience 4. Invest
This reminds me of a scene from The Wolf of Wallstreet. Which doesn't seem good
Such sleezy used car salesman shit
If a hunerd dollers don't change it, just say fine.
The guy will be down $30K and none the richer.. He deserves it for falling for this jerk
https://youtube.com/c/Traxzu
This guy going to be in the feds soon
He is a Con artist at best
That guy lost is money 😂😂😂
"Get his Credit Card right now"  Red flags lol
grant just do yourself a favor and link with hollywood  your an ACTOR !
This dude is really a crook
How many old ladies you think he has ripped off…
is he even a good salesman? I seriously can't tell.
Literally a video of him saying “congratulations you just said yes before you knew what you were buying” his goon was about to lose the sale so Grant jumps in, closes, and says “haha this is grant card one GOTCHA”
I can’t do that, 100 dollars is 100 dollars
Your a scam lmao
This dude definitely eats his corn the long way.
Uh huh...sure...
If a person ever talked to me like this on the phone I would drop the deal immediately
This entire conversation has nothing to do with $100 and everything to do with maintaining the position of power over another person. Dude on the phone just wanted to see if Mr. Peanut Gallery had the decency to budge. Mr. Peanut Gallery decided to kill two birds w one stone by saving himself 100 bucks and using a condescending tone to remind this guy who’s boss.
How old is this clip iPhone 4? Yeaaa million bucks boiiiiii
It’s call bullying sales tactics
Give me your hundred dollars 💵 and all you get is get swindled Boi
We got some great stocks for you, only a penny each. We are giving you the opportunity to get in on the ground floor and make the real money.
EW
Sorry man! This dude rob people’s emotions.   Nobody in the world should charge anybody that much money, Even if your a great salesperson!!!!  Instead, he should give it away for Free.
Three weeks later nick filed for bankruptcy
Top 10 things said by Grant Cardone that will never happen, "I'll make you  a million dollars"
I would’ve told him get bent and this video would’ve never existed lol
30k deal and he’s worried about $100? Literally never happens. Cardone is full of no value lol
Grant: I know what I'll do I'll set up this fake phone call with one of my other employees, I'll swoop in and show people my staff can't close a deal and I can with the pushy sales tactics. This guy is a con artist.
You can play that 100 dollar game both ways....
I would hang up if I heard this arrogance
Oh god this guy has a university? Call it everyone, societies f#%$#ked
If someone get too aggressive at me for a little favor/discount I just tell them to fuck off and tell them they just lost a client for their fucked up treatment (and file a complain if I can just maybe fuck with them some more)
Ur going to $0 mr Cardone
It’s like brainwashed religious people
Works great if you’re signing up an 18 yr old for a cellphone plan but If you’re trying to close a $100k deal or literally anything, this won’t work and you’ll lose the sale. Piss off your client and they will never buy from you and you just lost your sale. Next time, say, if I give you the $100 off, you going to do this? He says yes you just got the deal. He says no/unsure you never had a sale anyway.
What a scam
Does anybody in these comments have 1million dollars? Unless you are already a millionaire you shouldn’t speak on things you don’t really have information about. Calling a person a con because you’re broke isn’t an excuse to shame a person. Do your research first. Of course broke people are the only ones that have time to devote to talking down on someone they don’t even know personally. Tighten up people! Stop making foolish accusations
This dude is out there scamming.
Jhaater bal bara
This man has no manners or respect, this is not how you talk to someone.
this advice to get him more money ‘’100 dollars doesnt matter’’
I can't believe this guy still has a platform. Goes to show you that having money isn't synonymous with intelligence
Can’t stand this dude
If you couldn’t give up $100, he needed it more than the other guy l
Unless he truly offers something i can't get something else or his price is already better than the 30k i would walk away if he'd said something like that to me.  Depending on what you're selling there is a 25-30% Gross profit to be made with a sale. Thats 7.5k-9k.  What would you prefer telling your boss? - hey i closed that 30k deal for 29900 Or - hey you know that 30k deal? Its off because he wanted 100$ off but i would'nt give in.  Even if the 30k is your bottom price there are way better methods of giving thats to the customer. For example : i can't give you this as a deal now, but future purchases can be done at a discount.  This gives you a sale at the current price and a future customer which might get things cheaper than new cliënts, BUT the returning factor gives you a more steady and certain cash flow.  Always think long term. Giving in on a sale today can give you an easyer or more sales in the future.
See, I like sales but not this crap. A good salesman is genuine and they try to get what is best for your needs. They don't create urgency or insult you either.
Just by the arrogant way he's talking I'd say no thanks.
someone telling you their gonna make you a million dollars almost guarantees you won’t be making anything
Another person getting scammed. Notice the “get his credit card RIGHT NOW”
A sucker is born every minute…
Totally and completely not staged at all....totally reeeeal.
Who can put 30k on the card or am I hearing this wrong
Conn artist... it's a wonder he didn't ask if his wife makes the decisions...
My favorite part is the fact that he used a horrible tactic, sounds like Grant needs the $100 more than Nick if you ask me. Nick wanted to feel like he was getting a good deal.
Damn, I remember a guy who used to deal with his clients like this.... oh yeah, it was Jordan Belfort. You know what happened to him? He got sent to prison. Careful Grant, you're walking a path many rich people have tried walking already, and the government doesn't play nicely to them.
he got scammed
See, i look at it the other way. If you aren’t willing to budge a small amount to get my business then what’s gonna happen when a real issue comes up or you try increasing prices even though i have you tons of business.
Man your da best
This guy is a con artist
Love what you do grant
I'll immediately hangup the call because only scammers talk like this. A 100 off is a 100 off, why do people use cashback cards? Even rich people?
Fake customer. Fake salesmen.
Lmao would said no
Reminds me of wolf on wallstreet 🤣
Wow what a con! Waiting for the house card to collapse. When this happens he will be in country where he hid his money.
Yeah I would’ve said no a hang up.
Lol. Seeing this guys strategy getting roasted is hilarious.
Todays wolf of Walstreet. Lol.    Caint wait for the movie to come out
I feel you but that was harsh
Lol id tell him to walk
THIS is ear hustlin’!!!  Sheeeeesh
If $100 isn't such a big deal, how about you waive it?
Get his credit card right now 😂🤣😅😆 Bunch of 🐂 💩
so the guy is looking for investors ? Saids doesn’t have more money to give him? Can’t bend for $100? Promise to makes him a million out of $30k…. Im not a sales man but just doesn’t seem right lol
Where do I have to invest 30k for 3 years to make a million?
I always knew Grant was a bloody con man. He's not as rich as he tries to make it look.
Grant is the best     Scammer
But how you can do it if you are NOT Grant Cardone thaat s the question hhh
I love it trying to be like the wolf
This guy makes me understand why Akira Toriyama based Frieza off of salesmen. Mostly real estate salesmen but still
What GC is doing right now is the same thing that got Jordan Belfort in Jail
This is Scam at it’s best. I have to admit he is better than the india’s scammers. lmao
This guy is a joke
It’s not worth arguing with a customer over a 100 dollars just to make a point, he could’ve lost the 30k sell for sure
You couldn’t get away with that in the UK you talk to a customer like that he gunna tell you to get to fuck
Any salesman talks to you like this hang up.
So essentially belittle someone over them trying to barter?  Sounds like a typical dumbass internet "tip"
If $100 doesn't matter why doesn't he knock off $100 for his customer
This dude is a financial predator
If they aren't willing to do you a hundred dollar favor why bother?
After being exposed on the wolf of Wallstreet podcast surprised he still acts like this
As fake as it gets
What a scam artist.
I can't stand a sales man like this...
Lmao this guy is soo full of crap
As someone who comes from sales, and someone who LITTERALY has talked to GC sales associates there aggression in sales is insane.
This guy is literally a monster lol
How is this entertainment?🤡
I wouldn’t give this guy a hundred pennies.
Nick is broke now!!!
Who wants what the most; how bad does buyer need his product/service. How much does seller need to make that one sale to fill quota, etc. Supply & demand.
Sounds like Wolf of Wall Street
Snake oil come,s 2 mind
Guys. NEVER EVER FOLLOW THIS CAT. Naww. Not, don't and do not. Reply if you want to know why
Lol . Thst easily going the other way . If you want my money . It'll cost ya 100$
This is pretty much how the wolf of wallstreet guys spoke to people...
I want to find out if this guy lost his $30,000
Now get his credit card!
and that same person is more likely to cancel, because they were pushed into that decision.  probably why the up-front scam fees are higher 🤷🏻‍♀️
I'd send this guy a gulag van. This is how u scam people. 😜
Lol try this in the UK and watch how quickly the phone line goes dead. You Americans and your sense of "humour"...us Brits and our "sod off mate" attitude.
Someone’s been watching too much Wolf on Wall Street 😂🤣😂😅😅😅😅
youre the one begging for the $100😂
Bro I would’ve hung up the phone. Grants tripping with his little intimidation tactics.
These sale tactics are actually illegal.
Damn that guy makes me feel like I just watched boiler room
I will give $100 discount to get 30k sale lol
Stages all of this videoes
Says: “get his credit card right now” 👁👄👁
You speak to anyone in Europe like this and you will be saying "hello, hellooo...."
Not gonna lie, I would walk away over 10 cents, it’s the principle man, 100$ is negligible but when he tries to manipulate you by insinuating your too poor to do business with him I wouldn’t have done it if he offered me a 1000$ discount.
“NO” & “fcuk off” should be the answer.
I work In Retail. Jewelery to be specific if I ever spoke to anyone that way that its not the response you would get. Ima assume this is Fake
I wana see ppl really talking like this to customer
This guy watching too much Wolf of Wall Street
Tie looks like shit and tied like a idiot tied it
The husky of fence street
I can close like that, im a single Dad 5 year old twins,,,, I need work and I can CLOSE!!!!
This is the biggest con man I’ve seen
How to make amillion dollars. Convince people that if they give you money you will make them rich
Any customer with knowledge would back out of this
Sounds like wolf of Wall Street type shit
Dude is saying $100 shouldn't matter to the guy on the phone, if $100 doesn't matter then why does it matter so much to the sketchy ass salesman lmao
🙄
Get his credit card right now
He could have taken that 30k and yolo’d it into Tesla calls
For someone who says 100 dollars doesn’t matter in this deal, he sure seems to care about getting the 100 dollars
Lot of sale snowflakes in the comments. The guy is asking for 100 dollar off on 30.000,00. Its easy, kill it.
If someone talks to me like this I will hang up
To this day grant is still tied up in legal fees from countless lawsuits lol
The confidence is what he had, insulting the customer doesn’t always work. He was willing to pulll those cards and ballsy risky tactics because if it went to shit it’s on that sale agent and his sale charts and he would turn the camera off to save himself
I wanna know how many times this DIDN’T work.
Conman.
Felt like i was watching wolf of wallstreet
I'd rather go to Trump university
I think nick tried to hustle the wrong guy
How much more do you need to see this is fake and just marketing for them…obvs it’s an employee behind that phone. Who tf asks for a 100 bucks discount when they gonna spend 30k…….just…ugh
He's going to wait until you ask him to start reading his card number and then all you will hear is the Sound of him hanging up the phone
Ah yes talk to your customers like they’re pieces of shit. Why shouldn’t he save 100 dollars…
This guy's sales tactics only work for transactional sales. I spent 5 years as a car salesman, and my first 3 were being force fed grant cardone's bullshit. Seriously the worst idea ever. if you like working 70 hours a week and standing outside all the time, sell like this. This garbage will get you zero referrals. If any new salesmen are reading this, just be a human. Relate to the person, treat them how you would like to be treated, and you will do well in time.
I would have FU
He straight up said they don’t have any more money to give him so how’s he gonna turn 30k into 1m
I’d leave the deal immediately if I was talked to like that? How is this supposed to be a good salesman? This guy got to be a fake.
Wolf of wall street right there
Would be interesting to talk to this guy now.
If I see this I think about the wolf of Wallstreet movie
These scam artists are awesome
My answer would be: your far more rich than me? Y/N, ofc he says yes so then I say surely you should be less bothered about the 100 than I am then
He just got conned
Lol the wolf of wallstreet right here fam. That mans just lost 30k 🤣
If you’re getting $30k on a product that’s almost pure profit you should give them $100 off. Also if someone talks to you like this don’t give them $30k over the phone…
If he’s so confident why not give the guy the $100 discount? Bc it’s total bullshit. He’s a con man
Coughs in modern day wana be wolf of wall street
And now he’s in prison for coercion. That’s not legal.
Nice acting*
I don’t think people understand buyers now have an exceptional amount of ego (as sometimes they should - but that’s another convo). But they have so much ego that most buyers would happily spend an additional $300 with the next company and remain respected than going with this shit and saving $100. And if they can’t afford to have that flexibility with purchasing the item, then they shouldn’t really be buying it.
fake gurus . He isnt making this guy a million dollars for 30 grand. Everyone would do it
"Get his credit card right now....before he throws up the bullshit i fed him 👍🏻👍🏻" My man Grant!
** CLICK **
🖕🏿to all the pushy salespeople.
So long story short my friends...   Grant Cardone sold fake knowledge. Made NO ONE millions like claimed.   Money Laundered the money into buying real estate properties in Florida.   Had other companies manage his properties   Than Grant starts to get sued by his followers.   Companies pull out of management of his properties   To be continued...
Successful man terrible teacher
Lmaooo sounds kind of like the scene from wolf of Wall Street lmaoo
Fast talker always the one to watch
Conman Grant Cardone
Grant's secret is that he sounds like Matthew  McConaughey. His voice and delivery. He sounds cool.
The other few clips where the caller hangs up after being called a panhandler didn't make it onto YouTube for some reason
I’d tell him right there I’m good if he ever spoke to me like that
Literally filming himself scamming a dude I feel bad for the people who actual give in to people like this.
Clown university
Weird way to pronounce Grifter University
This is the same guy that had a speech about a penny saved is a penny earned
This is scummy
I could never work for him
Slimy sales tactics are shortsighted, I treat people with respect and provide them what they need and I do well and I can sleep at night.
I’m in Sales and let me tell you something, people don’t take too kindly to this kind of nonsense
Who the fuck cares? Is this supposed to be life coaching or just some prick gloating about how good his constructed negotiations are?
What a fucking goof. Pretty easy to say No and go to the next guy, cuz there’s a million people selling.
Cocky little salesman....
You might not want this deal if they talk like that to you
This guy is just another con man in the slew of con men on youtube shorts.
Never do business with someone like this. Period.
Next Jordan Belfort at its finest
Nah, get what your worth. Someone wants to say your price is flawed then why are they begging "YOU" to do it
Bruh I would’ve hung up him as soon as he started talking like Tom cruise on tropic thunder
Looks like a pressure sale to me…just saying GC
Horrible sale if this is real. Social media is funny  Don’t do this in real life 😂
If the guy is willing to spend $30k over 3 years, I'd give him his 100 off amd not belittle him like this. It's also staged but what do I know..
This fake crap kills me.
Fake
I could stretch that 100 out 4 5 days if I really wanted too I know he’s a business mans and HE shouldn’t be worrying bout 100 but fuck bro talking shit silver spoon ass
I hate mfs that dog on a hunnit saying they always have to beg
“Get his credit card right now”  Another con man
"If $100 is too much, you need to go find a street corner to beg on." 😂
Seen this in wolf of Wall Street 😅
If a guy gave me this spiel, I would hang up and take my business elsewhere.
Scammer
Yeah he doesn’t sound fishy at all
Never heard your name until you said as if he would recognize it lol love you man slow down the arrogance a hair or two it’s bit much
Am I watching a pyramid scheme?
“You need to go beg on a street corner”.  Yep not taking his advice
Call his bluff. He's trying to be all hardass salesmanlike but he is the one who is going to lose the most as if you are not prepared to at least negotiate or meet half way then he will have just lost a 30k deal for the sake of $100.
The answer to this nonsense is always “no”
One thing I realized is most salesman won’t understand. Most people saying don’t do this doesn’t have millions in sales let alone 6 figures lol. The top multi millionaires and billionaires delivery ain’t for the faint of heart 💯🤷🏾‍♂️ look at Dan Peña.
Pure pressure and redirection. Car Salesman shyt. No thanks
This sums up Cardones career… he was able to bamboozle people out of their last money lol
Cardone university? Is that like Trump university? 🤣🤣🤣
If you spoke to me like that I would hang the fuck up on you. Being pompous doesnt make you a salesperson.
This is corny and easily staged
Remember why are these normal calls recorded.... Because they BS.
Staged
You all should chill this called room energy during sales sometimes I hard on my customers sometimes I go soft but u have to read the room know ur customer at the end of the day every one need to convince someone else to buy a product be it god or bad product I am not saying this guy is a good guy tho so chill.
I would take my money somewhere else
Con man 💯
When you realize the video and call were staged lol
Billy mays was better
Gtfoh fake
Ronnie Pickering > Grant cardone
Title should be “how to immorally bully a guy with shame in to making a sale”
Dbag
Just because you have 100$ doesn't mean you have to spend it
You know when they hard sell like that it's cos u don't want what they are selling....nothing but a scummy conman

$100 was spent on that call. Just close the deal at 29,900 and move to the next deal.
Used car salesman..."its only a $100". Respond to this clown with: "Great then it won't bother you Nick to give up the $100 and we will both be happy because Todd closes a deal for 30k and I'm saving that 100."  Many people don't understand here Nick has an emotional tie to that $100. $29,900k is better than $0 deal.
The guy lost his 30k and had to file bankruptcy
if $100 didnt matter at all then why are you arguing so much to not give it to him
Grant  I’m shocked. You once said never pass on a deal over $100. In person and on your cd’s!
For anybody going into the sales field, do not act like this to possible customers
Cardone is not good in sales
Gotta love the end. "Get his credit card info quick!" Ya he just conned him.
*Nick watching this: 👁👄👁*
If someone repeats the same thing at you it’s so you stop thinking and only pay attention to what they’re selling to you
Don't follow what happened here - it's scripted 100%
Bullshit.
Straight scammer
This dude is a scammer
I remember this guy
Wolf of Wall Street
You people that hate Grant are pathetic. Admit it your jealous of him being rich. End of story. People love bringing up Jordan interview. Shit Jordan is jealous of the dude. Their sales approach is different. So what. Did sales make Grant millions? Well id say good job. Stop being weak envious pathetic souls and go make millions. And if Jordan makes another 100 million you'll hate him too! You only like him because he lost it all.
I think ‘Nick’ works for the company and they have such few real costumers that they can make fun skits like this all day🤣
So they wanted $30,000 and the guy was willing to pay $29,900? This whole video makes absolutely 0 sense at all.
I would've said ok thanks ill consider it and hung up.  Whatever you're selling the next guy will have it or the next guy or the next guy and anyone of them could potentially give me the discount. I've had plenty of salesmen try to play me like this. When I end the call they expect me to call back and when I don't they realize they just lost out on a sale and give me what I ask for.
Bro what, u not gonna go through all that for a 30 k purchase then back out because 100 bucks. You got the cash for it, you like it ,you buy it. Makes himself sound like such a sales tycoon
yes or no? but my book
Sounds like the pimps in my neighborhood ! 😂
Real talent
If the hundred dollars doesn't change anything, why can't I have it instead of you?
What a clown
how staged do you want it to looks?  him : YES!
This is soooooo fake
If “$100 doesn’t change it one way or the other” then give them the $100 off.
"If a hundred dollars is the decision maker, don't do it." This is probably one of the only kinda decent advice pieces this guy has said, though the amount can vary.
Scam
Get his credit card alright? Hahahaha
No.
The second I hear his voice I’m hanging up
What a tool
“Get his credit card right now” -
He basically bullied him into saying yes. Also, that statement at the end “get his credit card right now” was so slimy it made me cringe.
It goes both ways lmao, guys ego is too big for him to realize that.
What a greasy used car salesman!
Nick should have walked away.
He just wanted to get one over on the car sales guys.
It's easy for anyone to con a person but it takes a con artist to clean somone out to the very last penny.
I mean if losing 100 makes me 30k then il happily lose it
If you don't understand the value of $100, my 30k isn't going to be invested with you. Period. I turned my stimulus checks into 100k+ in the stock market, while also working 45+ hours during the pandemic.... That $100 you're not willing to work a deal out with, showed me that you're not worried about my investment or the compromise that I'm making by taking a risk with you. You just want to get your grubby little hands on my cash and sit me out on the curb like you do all of your clients.... You quite literally have nothing to offer me, Mr Cardone.
It worrisome that he ends call and says GET HIS CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW!
Don’t do this people. Neither they are acting or that guys is extremely lucky he didn’t drop 30k for that 100$ worth of juice. Let’s just say it 1 in a million of luck if it really work.
If its NOTHING! THEN WHY IS CARDONE BEGGING SO HARD FOR THAT $100. SNAKE OIL SCAM ARTIST!
Actually a really good quality in a businessman is practicing his negotiating. You should negotiate everything.
If you're not already a millionaire than Cardone Is not for you... he preaches to the everyday guy like we have millions
If $100 is the decision maker.... ok I'll pass. Peace out
he talk like leonardo dicaprio ni wolf of the wall streets 😂
This is super fake. Fake call. Scripted reply.
Scam artist 101. "Get his credit card right now"
This is madness - he sounds like Wolfie
That's my brother UNCLE G
He is going to end up on street corner after throwing away $30k
a con man pushes you into something. A business man doesn't have to talk you into something. If it's worth it it people want in. Cardone university only makes one man rich.
I’m 13 and I don’t need a 100 dollars
Such a BS this guy
Why does he always do this to Todd? 🤣
“Watch me close a sale that was already closed.” #JordanExposedGrant
I Lost My Job Recently & I Have Twins 4 Month Old, What Can I Do To Find A Good Job, I’m In A Bad Time, I Need Money So Bad. Im lost
Damn i hope this is scripted cause its just sad to watch...
If $100 is nothing. Why refuse him for that same lousy $100
If anyone tries to give you the hard sell, just walk away. There's a reason why they need to use the hard sell. And it ain't for your benefit.
30k over the next 3 years ? Can you say scam 😏
Grant Cardone once said "I would rather spend a little more and everyone be happy than make more and I'm the only one who is satisfied. Because if we make a deal and everyone's happy then I get to do more deals with you." Appearenty not.
Lol do people actually believe this shit.  Cardone University?  Wtf
get this bum off my recommended
I would still do a discount of 100 no matter
All the haters below me couldn't sell their way out of a paper bag, and are just jealous.....🙄
Get his credit card right now 😂
Car dealerships are full of peer pressure antic people. All they do is make you feel bad in order to get the deal. Yeah fucker, I could go else where and they get their 30k plus their interest. It's a 100$ you bumming off of me because you're a middle man?? If it weren't for me you'd be on a street corner begging.
Worked in sales all my life, if I was a consumer and someone hopped on the phone to me like that I wouldn’t buy I’d go elsewhere 😁
“That is true” lmao what a spineless loser letting him speak tjag way to him
These YouTube idiots think they can just get on here and say oooo look I have money pay for my seminar listen to my rules.    It’s all bullshit.   There’s no easy get rich quick scheme that is foolproof or everyone would do it.   Find your own way out there.   Those are the real millionaires.  The ones who stop caring about other peoples wealth and find out what people need and become the supply.    One of my favorite examples of this is.  Michael jamison.    He moved to South Africa and sold under the sink water filters. And became absolutely rich beyond his dreams.  All because the right time the right place and a little elbow grease
I watched wolf of wall street yesterday and holy fuck
Cardone is such a loser
Bell end
If some jackass talked to me like this id hang up
This seems like a fake call for promotion
Ya, I'm in Enterprise sales so this is a bit lower than what I deal with but if a prospect had this moronic request I'd say "done, here's the pen."
Another fake call...30k ..no one is gonna nickel and dime over $100...ridiculous
And that’s how you get the phone hung up on you by someone without ladyballs
Yea okay say that to real people they hang up bub
That’s good advice. If 100$ is the decision maker in a 30k deal, you probably shouldn’t be doing the deal
I would have hanged up
This guy is a egotistical p.o.s...Another wannabe motivational speaker.... 🙄
Get his credit card details right now
Alright, alright, alright!
He says 1 thing and does the thing he says not too do! This video is staged!
GC is a con…. Nothing but a hype man…. Shit hit the fan back when civic hit and he fired everyone and didn’t pay them their pipeline money….  He ain’t got all that $$…
Obviously a lot of you guys don’t know how money works or just are simply a 9-5 worker on any deal above $10,000 asking for a $100-$200 discount is almost insulting it’s a bad offer it shows your not necessarily skilled in negotiating and even encourages them to take advantage of you best bet is if your gonna negotiate at all which you shouldn’t really do if there’s already a set investment pricing is aim for the thousands range so instead of asking for $100 off ask for $1200-$2000 that’s a proper negotiation and not waisting time 😂
The worst 100 dollar investment ever
I smell a scam
Wtf is this Gordon  ?!?the  🐺 real live ?! ...lol wtf ...😂😂😂
Unfortunately that dude probably won’t make a million dollars and he just lost 30k that he could’ve just saved or used on something more important.
Scammer. "We gonna take care of you" "We're gonna make you a millionaire" okay calm down
This guy is so annoying, I mean who wants annoying customers, he’d be on the phone all the time asking “do you know who I am”😂😂
Cant ppl see all this is fake.
This had that vibe from wolf of wall Street where leo pretends to ass f**k the poor man of 5000 $.
Snake oil salesman
Love the end get his credit card right now
Grant cardone, the biggest scam artist
We don’t have anymore money to give you but you’re gonna help him make a million?
Lmao he turned into the rock 🤨🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nick: I need a discount  Grant Cardone: don't come over here with that begging sh*t my boy 🤨🚫 🗣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Thanks for doing business with Grant Cardone." -Grant Cardone
Seems fake. Who’d ask for just $100 off on a sale for thousands?
Never trust
Lmfao the customer knew what he was getting into that’s why he let the guy say that about him but I get the idea
Thats fake. He wouldnt be whining about 100 if he is putting up 30,000. This was stupid n only a weak minded person is unable to see the cap in this video.
Wish he said no
Cant wait to see this ponzi scheme gwt blown up in about 5 years.
Guy is such a scam artist.
Nice. All faking. You can't deal 30k with dumb furious way saying my man, and just y or n.
This is some fake ass wolf of wall street wannabe shit😂. If a 100 dollars isn’t going to change a thing then let him have the 100 dollar discount. Guy, if you’re ever trying to make a sale don’t try to shame the person into giving you more money like this fake bozo here
Could I have that $100 please Sir
With such irreverent attitude I would hang up in a jiffy
Faker than WWE
Exactly $100 won’t change but still made him pay it wen he already payed 30k wtf
Love this shit
That guy has a nice pyramid scam
guy is punchable
how to set up a YouTube video
He should’ve asked for a 5k discount.
Worst sales pitch I’ve ever heard….
The fakeness hurts…. Hurts so bad
get his credit card rn lol seems like a scam to me
Tell me you're on your fifth marriage, without telling me you're on your fifth marriage.
If someone says they’re gonna make you a million dollars, run. Cause they’re gonna make themselves a million dollars before they do you
Lots of people in here who don't know shit about the art of sales and it shows.
This reminds me of the movie Boiler Room.
Get his credit card right now 🤣🤣😂
Want to see him close on women business owners.. talking like this..
Kook
Make me money
If the dealer can’t budge $100, then I’m out. There’s always another car.
Uhhhhh, I’m going to go ahead and say this guy doesn’t know how to sell anything.
Um this is the opposite of what to do 🤣
So trashy smfh
This dude just seems greasy...
I feel like we should all just keep calling this a-holes business and ask for $100 off just to waste their time. What a boiler room douche
So what’s going on lol
God a slimy salesman
He just said a bunch of nothing. Don’t eat into this bull shit
Im willing to walk away for a $100,-   And if you are a salesman. You better take that $100,- “los”.
Lmao people act like these guru courses are the answer to all of their problems and believe the gurus business model is helping other people when it’s actually just selling courses for exorbitant amounts under the guise of ‘having skin in the game’
I spent 6 years in auto sales and this is exactly why I got out. Sales is such a cringy line of work
Meet Kevin! GC’s a wad.
It’s easy to look at money like this when he’s never done an honest days work with his hands his entire life
I hope no one takes this advice at all.
Scammed and they work more than the average joe
This gives me the wolf of Wall Street vibe
This is just bullshit 😂😂😂😂
Reminds me of the wolf of wall street
Bro im bouta make a zillion dollars making videos like these
That's how you scam someone like... That
Lol 30k gone down the drain . People don’t realise they sells courses not dreams
I would say he willing to let a $30,000 deal go over $100. Who wants to close the deal more, and if he's just promised 1m in 3 years for 30k and don't deliver it doesn't matter to him
Can’t take this guy seriously. Jordan Belford straight up expose this man. He’s knows anything about the basic of sales
What a setup. This guys a con and can’t sell for sht
Salesman promptly proceeds to not take care of Nick or make him 1 million dollars
He didn’t close the deal because he outsmarted the customer, he closed the deal because he made it too much of an effort for the customer to say no. The seller was lucky the customer didn’t feel too uncomfortable and run away.
This screams to me that you just pressured the hell out of someone. Anyone this pushy isn’t willing to do business. It’s a scam. If that $100 isn’t financially responsible for you even if you’re spending 30k then don’t do it. You handed them the keys to your money because a thug got on the phone and pressured you into it. SMH promised him a million for a 30k investment 😂
Still not as cringe as DL
The more I watch him, the more I hate him
He just got hustled out of 30k. 😭
This is how not to ceo 101.
I hope he sees all of these comments are negitive
when he said “ did you get his credit card”
That 100 decision making  can go both ways
Wouldnt work in Australia, if someone talks to me like that im hanging up the phone mid sentence, period.
so you make fun of him getting hung up on $100, but that essentially means you’re hung up over that same $100.
If you guys pay for this than you deserve to be a sucker for the rest of your life.
P.o.s. for not giving $100. Total scam artist
Not good advice
Sounds like a ponzhi scheme. : stay away from this guy.  Sounds like “Tom Vu- come to my seminar , I’ll make you rich !”
Thank you for this video..now I know never to watch this channel again... such garbage advise....folks pls don't try this strategy in actual sales you will not only lose the sale but perhaps also your job !
That's kind of a wild way to hold a phone grey fox.
Cardone is a huckster. Watching him get exposed on Jordan Belfort’s podcast is very gratifying.
I sell cars and have heard this once a week at least I normally break it down with them but telling them look the company can’t do that I’m sorry we don’t have $100 to give you but your car loan over 5 years that’s 38cents a week I’ll tell you what you can come get that 38 cents off me personally every Friday if you like that closes the deal every time and I’ve only ever had one guy come and ask for his 38 cents and he only did it three times.
Cardone University lmao. If this guys so rich why does he need to sell business lessons to teenagers
America worshiping money like it is a god.
Or just give him a $100 discount and on a 30k deal?
Pressure selling. I guarantee that guy has lost his money
Yep pyramid scheme confirmed.
The way he said get his credit card rip loool
“If you’re worried about a hundred dollars you should just go beg on the corner” well if it’s so insignificant just give the discount then.
There’s literally a video of this prick ON STAGE ASKING THE AUDIENCE FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS.
Grant you’re a fraud! I love the Gary Vaynerchuck videos with you and how he owns you. Haha.
This guy is so damn cringe.
Get his credit card right now
I almost fell for that scam too.
$100 now is on fucking principle alone….dead deal I’ll go to the next guy he will respect my money 30k or $100…
Wtf is he selling for 10k per year??
So what did he just buy for 30k, some jerk calling him names?
“Get his credit card right now”
Can’t wait til this faker gets found out
Setup
That was the definition of scummy
This entire video shows that he's a great CEO
I can tell you, that shit would not work with me. I hate arrogant, without a cause people. This guy is the epitome of nothing, that thinks they are everything
My answer. Close your company, if 100$ effect your company's balance sheet.
Snake oil scam
I got a call from one of their sales guys & they were so pushy on a $9000 trip to Florida for a 3 day class. I don’t have that money to spend on a class….Plus the ad said it was a free online thing why am I getting a call lol
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Paper money doesn't make sound only coin does..
People are investing on a credit card?  Holy shit.  Sketchy.
Oh my god the wolf of wall street of 2021 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Fake guru
🤪😃
La tarjeta. De bolada saca la feria y serdio
How to become bankrupt? Short amc and gme
30 fucking k bro start investing in real estate. Fuck his class🤣🤣nick ya fucked up
30k is to much to spend on this guy
Grant Cardone is a fraud.
What books is this guy reading?
Bullsitdown
The king of con
Would never buy off this 🤡
I’da went from $100 to $1,000 “cuz I don’t like your attitude buddy”
Should have said no
This conversation reminds me of the movie The Wolf Of Wall Street 😅 when Jordan Belfort is selling that piece of shit for huge amount of 💰😅
Good salesman. But let’s not forget he didn’t wanna give an extra hundred dollars away either.
This is horrible salesmanship, and very good con artistry. 9/10 customers walk away from overly confrontational salesmen. All he has to do is show you the 1/10
"Get his credit card right now" is all I heard. 😂
US ias full of predators with no morality!
the red flag of a MLM "business man"
This is disgusting
One day I’m going to be learning from you
Will...love to see his "course" dissected
I see this guy everywhere. I honestly dnt know what he does lol
Insulting a potential client results in a hangup.
The wisdom of this call is brilliant. Yeah sure $100 wouldn't affect the deal ... the genius is Grant was changing that guys reality with money.
Scammer.
play on there ego
what is he even selling?
Should ask for 5% off
I'd a hung up the phone b4 he got to street corner
Get his credit card right now
I think a teacher at my school might be this guy's double
The poor guy just got f$ck
Personable-  this is the effect of “winning friends and influencing people “ comes in at its finest!🔥
🤣 He is such a joke!
This guys just the top of the pyramid scheme 😂 this guy cannot make you rich
"Doesn't change it" Yeah it does, that's an extra $100 that I didn't lose. But you lost 29,900 over something you said was small. Who's the real idiot
Lol I've canceled business because they were late let alone over $100. Tell this guy to fuck off and get someone less douchey
Weak
Saving the small money is what makes you rich......
Get his credit card cause i just scammed a big fish...also this is all fake..this guy is a liar and a scam artist...FORMER JUNKIE,FORMER CON MAN...TRYING TO GO STRAIGHT...YEAH RIGHT
This cardone guy first insults his customer....then he Insults his sales agent. Smh. I wonder what he was thinking after he walked away like did his conscience tell him he was wrong or did he just feel on top of the world. Let the pride man humble himself so that he may be exalted. Those who humble themselves will be lifted up.
This dudes a total mega doosh.
Nah bro this isn’t a movie you aren’t going to tell me to go beg on the street and continue to receive my hard earned money, followed by “get his credit card information right now” you seriously couldn’t be more shameless.
This feels like wolf of wall street
It's all about putting pressure on the spot, confusing the other person into making a rush decision, "yes or no" it's that simple, very good business tactic!
Grant wants to be the Wolf of wallstreet so much
Eat the rich
Duck that. I got that $100 for you my man. Let's get this done.
Cardone University 🤣🤣🤣
Arrogant
Grant cardone hasn’t met my dad.  Old man from the old country he was willing to walk away from a $34,000 car for $50 bucks. Made that salesman sweat bullets after spending so much time with him. When asked what he could do with $50 my dad replied I can take my wife out to dinner. He got the $50 dollar discount and then proceeded to pay the car in cash. This guy was a dope I would have asked grant a question was he willing to lose 30k over $100.
When you try to script a video after watching Wolf of Wall Street
People were so stupid they just give their money away all because of greed
I love how the video after this is literally him asking people to please give him a hundred dollars for seemingly no reason.
Today on american greed we look into.the grant cardone enterprises.
Staged.
this cant be real  100% bullshit get his credit card gtfoh
This guy wants to be Matthew McConaughey so badly
From that 20 second clip that man is a grade A tool
A scammer at work. I hang up on people like this.
I swear I saw this same seen in wolf of Wallstreet 🤔🤔
I was at a car dealership and the salesperson used a similar tactic. I told them that obviously things were going well and they didn't need my business. I left found another car I wanted and negotiated a fair deal with a salesperson that was eager to secure my business. Let dinosaurs like this go extinct.
Kind egressive marketing and negotiating make me sick. For real it’s for poor investors and poor marketers.  Wolf’s from Wall Street than cry …🤮
This dude has Car Dealership Business Manager vibes. Trying to sell a bunch of shit you don’t want, trying to convince you that financing is better than cash, hook you on a bunch of bullshit insurance options
All the comments from the salesmen about the street corner comment,  only shows you guys have no clue about sales. Regardless of your profiles, EVERY customer is different. You sell to the customer, not the technique. Nick took the exact same customer, connected with him to find his closing angel and did what his employee couldn't do because you don't learn this stuff in orientation. Nick walked away from the sale and focused purely on the decision... Yes or No? Why ask that question? Because he understood we're no longer in the sales cycle, we're closing, and he shut it down.
why is youtube recommending me this guy and his BS! Hes a gary vee try hard!
You know this was scripted 😂
I would of said yes let's do it. My man.         Oops just kidding now make it a thousand or find your money from someone else.
These comments are hilarious 🤣. Apparently none of you know who Grant Cardone is. I would advise you to save up 30K and attend his University. I'm sure you'll become a millionaire!
The Wolf of wall street.
I've had people buy their own hvac equipment then ask me to install it . I would price it less equipment made same money with no equipment warranty they save money they thought .
I had a guy complain bout my pricing he said come can't do a better price i said yes so raised the price he said thats not better! I said its better for me ! He would always to figure ways to cheat me told him someone else he did and nothing would pass code.
This dude lives off of peoples money and flips it. That’s how these fools get rich from nothing.
Hmmm sounds familiar!
Scammer Alert Scammer Alert Scammer Alert
So what does this guy even do?
I didn't even know grant could pronounce the word university. I just assumed it had too many syllables for him.
,,,,???!!!!
The problem with my clients and Nick's is that my clients dont have 100 dollars to negotiate , so if I don't give them that discount they will probably not do it at all.. Whereas nick's client has that 100.
I actually fucking dislike this guy more than anyone on YouTube. SO fucking skeevy
I'm tired of a billionaires talking about how easy it is to make money ... lol I make a decent wage and enough to make meets ends this is the real world my friend...make great decisions and keep pushing forward..thanks!!
He literally got caught for scamming people… “get his credit card right now.” Only said that because he knows it’s a scam and he will want it back but oops it’s already been long processed
My guy needs to watch wolf of wall steer
"Im gonna make you a million dollars"   Yeah ill need that in writing asap.  Snake oil
Now that is beautiful salesmanship
In other words brow beat the customer into buying.
Grant Cardone I want 10 million dollars to join your university upfront
Cardone University? Sounds awful familiar to Trump University. Just a bunch on con artists ripping off the gullible.
This guys a joke.
The real life wolf of Wall Street lol
Dude all you SCRUBS saying OMG he’s slimey, or douche bags.. Get used to being broke. Is fucking closers go get what we want.
Grant was definitely a car guy!! Love it he’s one of us!!
Get his credit card with an evil grin
The guy on the phone had all the power in that transaction and didn't even realize it. He could have gotten that 100$ off. 💯
We love you Grand you're the best ever and my sister said she would suck the f****** love out of you oh my God
First of all, who requires $100 off a $30k deal in the first place? That’s just insult to whoever is providing the service. And if you are asking for such a small discount then that person is literally only doing it to feel like they’re getting a deal or that they have power over the deal. That’s just unbelievable. I’d say that that a 3.3% discount on a deal is so irrelevant that I’d need to know the motive since it’s absolutely not financially significant.
Lol at all the comments thinking this is real.
Nae, I'm out.
Who the fuck is Grant Cardone 🤷‍♂️
Get his credit card now!!!
Infinitely better ways to handle that. He touched on it for a second and than went straight into ego mode. I will say if your TIGHT with a client you can get away with that sometimes. But it’s a case by case basis.
Get his credit card RIGHT NOW, before he realizes I'm full of it.
Idk man kinda gives me Jordan Belfort vibes
he's not giving this guy a 100 dollar discount, and in that other video he expects that kid to go from house to house washing cars for free and getting 90 100 dollar tips?
Bullying people to hand over there money is seriously going to back fire on u one day. If i was the customer i would of hung up and went else where. F**ked if I'm letting someone bully me to make a business deal. U seem like the kind of guy who would bad mouth other businesses just to make a sale. Unfortunately for u I'm one of those people that walks out and spends my money at the business u just bad mouth.
Who else watches this and thinks of "Wolf of Wallstreet"???
What Cardone  meant to say is ima  make millions of dollars with Cardone University 🤡
How much you paid Nick to read the script
This guy popped up on my recommended and all I want is for him to go away now.
This guy popped up on my recommended and all I want is for him to go away now.
😆 he would’ve been like you need to beg is next 3 words would’ve been hello ? Hello ? hello
Well actually I was thinking forget the $100 what about I pay you 90k after you make me my million 3x your money for one job must be worth it!
I wouldn’t even do biz with someone like that to begin with. Gross
This only work on dorks with no back bone
$30 000, so many businesses opportunities, so many financial instruments and investments, and you chose to give it away to Grant Cardone? And for a what? "GC University" bullshit... grant cardone your programs are pushing more people into financial difficulties and I hope you get what's coming to you, Karma is a bitch...
Anyone who has ever worked in sales knows the fact this is a video up on youtube means that this guy really doesnt give a damm about people. This is a data product being resold over and over again. It isnt custom so they can discount the sale by 50% and still make profit. But to push this kind of success story which I presume is fake on us here at youtube is like trying to say this is why you should not dare ask for a discount. I just wish they called me so I can tell them to P off
This is fake as hell lol
Get his credit card right now
And the he proceeded to short amc 🤡
Always be Closing = rebuttal, rebuttal, rebuttal. The end
First of all ppl need to know that there is discounts KPI for those employees and you cant just talk like that to them they will ruin whatever business relationship for their KPI TRUST ME YOU JUST GOT HIM IN THIS ONE. +if you’re negotiating a price plz don’t bring the quality shit as part of the negotiation it just irrelevant and never convincing.
This is grant cardone and you just got scammed, nice doing business with you
Here in my garage
Sales people saying shit like “if youre smart, you’ll buy my product, and if youre smart like ME, you’ll sell my product”.  Amazing how some people love the taste of their own shit.
Im getting wolf of wall street getting ripped off vibes from this
Yeah i WOULD NOT have been so kind wtf
This guy is scamy as fk.
This is not sales this is being a douchebag. Make a you a millionaire with his university is the biggest scam pitch ever.
Get his credit card right now....thats the key
Watches Wolf of Wall Street one time
do you not see the cuts in the video? Those brief cuts generally indicated there are moments or takes in the video, usually that could be attributed to them wanting to cut down the video in a production sense, but in this case the entire convo is relevant in real time to their cause so there would be no need to cut the video... unless it was rehearsed and had takes in between certain moments. Watch the video a couple more times and youll see it.
why not just give him the 100 grant has millions
Sounds like a typical sleazy used car salesman to me and I sold used cars for five years
I used to work with Todd  that was always on fire
"Get his CREDIT CARD right now"  For grant cardone university  RIP
Yeah no, its more of principle thing with me, if you're not willing to work with me, im not willing to work with you. Goodbye.
If I were the customer, the second this guy picked up the phone I would've hung up. If $100 is insignificant, then you can discount it. Unless you're such a poor salesmen, that you've already hit your max and gave the client your whole commission in hopes for a monthly bonus.
I’m really confused on what’s happening, can someone explain?
Dude just took 30k from some poor sap. If you have to pay someone 30k to show you how to become a millionaire you're an idiot. He just showed you all you need to know on that phone call. Except he's the only one making the money and it ain't because he's selling something worth it. Scam artist
Yeah this guy seems legit. 😳
So.....be a douche....got it.
That's how you handle calls when you're not desperate to get a sale
Bro you got money we get it, its nothing to brag if you care more for 100 dollars than 30k
Great customer service
This dude watched wolf of wallstreet and decided to put on a show. Its all bs. The real world doesn't work like this.
Sounds like the line off wolf of wall street
And this is why we can't have nice things
Yall need to not believe this shit, when people barade you with questions trying to get you to say yes and not giving you time to respond or think, it's a scam. Worked for a company liked this and I hated myself for it
Scammers
My money man. Later
This us fake and cut lol sorry to spoil for those that cant see the obvious
Batman?
So disgusting.
Someone’s been watching Boiler room!😂😂😂
This guy is a greaseball  I'm guessing he is severely unhappy in life with a small pp
I would be part of the 1% that cancels the deal over 100 USD.
Reminds me of the science from wolf of Wall Street
everyone : wow what a deal maker  Me: what kinda phone is that...
I know microphones aren’t the best quality but you don’t need to put the phone halfway down your throat when speakerphone is being used.
This is so fake lol, the jumpcuts, the “dialogue” with quipping and pressuring the client like it’s some kinda Wolf of Wallstreet movie, nothing adds up lol, not even entirely sure what was even sold, or IF they even sold it to the guy since he didn’t wait one lick of a second for a firm approval. I pray the guy on the phone didn’t give his credit card if it wasn’t fake.
Who?
Ol boy wanna be the wolf of Wall Street so bad talking like that
Pfft.  Anyone who falls for this is extremely beta.  He is very obviously a con man.
When you have so much charisma you just tell people to hand over money, and the victim thanks you.
I’m surprised we couldn’t hear “Nick” on his cell phone calling from the other room.
Are we supposed to believe that garbage? The guy is spending 30k and wants a 100 dollar discount 😂
No the real question is if you don’t want a sale because a measly 100$ you’re in the wrong business deuces ✌️
What's the ROI on $30000?
Sounds like the wolf of wall street selling penny stocks lol
I took that street corner to beg on remark offensive.
Can't express how much I hate this guy Cardone
Anyone seen the movie Boiler Room?   How about Wolf of Wallstreet?  Ever seen the interview between grant cardone and jordan belfort?  By the way, in 2020, when the market crashed, and everyone was looking for work, granty baby fired a large number of his staff.  Just dumped them on their asses after they had busted their butts for his company.  👏
That’s not how you deal with a client. This is someone he knew. This is how to build a poor reputation. I like every other video up to this one. He should have phrased that differently about begging. That was a straight insult and unprofessional regardless of your net worth.
U give me 30k now and I'll give u 100k outa my life insurance. When I die.
How bullshit do you want this to be? Yes
Disgusting man.
I would love to know the true statistics on how many people actually make a million after payin him this money
I'd say if you're willing to act like a pushy used care salesmen and lose at30k deal over 100 dollars then you don't want the sale and I bet your competitor does, see ya
This is fake
Sleeze bag  "Get his cc number now"
This some wolf of Wall Street used car salesmen crap or just fake why would someone record this
Nay, assert dominance.
"Get his credit card now!"  Todd: 😶 he hung up
The master manipulator
Scam university
Thats when he's supposed to say no for gods sake. If the seller asks if you're willing to lose a "deal" over 100 bucks yeah. Lose it because its more than likely not a deal with these guys
Why lose 100$ when you can lose $30000
This dude is the worst
Scam artist yes of course lol Don’t hate the player Hate the game 😂
Lmao, customer wants a 0.3% discount on a $30,000 sale, and they say no? Errrr ok, great business minds 😒
How much is Hund Red Ollers
Just that attitide would make me want to say no. I don't like being bullied into things.
So homie had the deal sold at 29,900 and then boss man was tripping over the $100? 😂
Say what you want but this guys a savage lmao 🤣
Fake, any sales person giving that BS on a $30k order can go F themselves.
I see a same person in him as in Donald Trump. He’s just a lot smaller
Anybody selling you a way to get rich did not get rich with what they are selling you. They got rich by selling it to you.  If people "thinking about $100 should be out on the streetcorner panhandling" which corner do you work Grant? Because for a "rich" man you sure wouldn't let go of that $100.
You just watched a high pressure sale... but he's right a 100 dollars man should had asked for 5 grand off to make that 30 grand sale... better to try and pimp them than get punked like this fool 🤪🤪
Had a car salesman try something like this when we negotiated the price. Talked him down $550 but was firm, he said if you're so worried don't do the deal. Told him he was right, got up and walked out. He tried to be like "hold on let's not throw away a good deal", I ignored till he said "fine you got a deal". Told him no thanks and I'd be going somewhere else.   Don't ever do business with someone who talks to you like this. Dudes like this prey on the gullible and ignorant. I've laughed in the faces of people like this. Go hug your money guy because you clearly have some issues
Tell me it's staged, without telling me it's staged
I got strong wolf of wall street vibes from this😂
Yeah this doesn’t sound like a scam at all…
I need his help I’m 28 and I just spent $60,000 in 1 year  I need to learn how to save and stop taking care of everyone around me or make better investments
LOL 😅
I am still searching for that one positive comment on a video featuring Grant Cardone. My search continues...
Anyone I do business with talks to me this way, we will no longer be doing business.
This is just so much poo
Nay
God damn this guy is sleazy
Its true...if someone that I'm selling to is complaining about a few dollars when the bill is in the thousands they need to stop wasting my time...and yours too if you're in that situation...they're not ready for the purchase and you need to move on to buyers who are ready.
God how many peoples fall this guys bullsh*t
Man, this dude is gross.
Scammer
Can't even tie a tie properly
Tell homedepot customers that well I did lmfao they still begged for 10% off lmfao
Tell me you run a pyramid scheme without saying you run a pyramid scheme.
If $100 is nothing for you why not take it off the pricing
It goes both ways thought if you were gonna let the deal go over 100 dollars you just as greasy as the other guy
I mean he has the ability to sell like that because he is Grant Cardone. Anyone else using that verbiage it wouldn't work
Wonder if Nick got rich or not 🤔🤣🤣
I know a guy who told a bunch of people he'd make them a million with his university too...
What is this guy selling? That line wont always works but I'm guessing works enough that he doesn't care. The high pressure play on your ego man gimmick. I mean some people just want to feel like they won even if they didnt and others just enjoy the haggle etc
Already was done just a hundred dollar difference acting like he scored.
He just be littles you into spending your money. It’s not motivation. Don’t listen to a “rich” person tell you “how to get rich.” Or  “how spend your money.”his money is mostly inherited I’m sure.If they are so well off and have so much, they should have caved for the $100 for the customer. Especially if he is a first time customer. This guy is more of a slick/fast talker salesman
If you realize the tactic, it’s to make the other person feel broke or inferior for not giving into you. So many people try to do this with my business trying to portray it as small and going no where if I don’t use their services.
So many haters in these comments. Congrats nick hope you make some money with these guys.
Cardone University = Trump University = SCAM
This guy is a tool and only sells to sheep
Poor dude just lost 30k lol
Buddy your not Jordan Belford
If the hundred doesnt matter u take the cut mr businessman.
absolutely terrible salesman
so then why is this cardone guy worried over a $100 it makes no sence
Scam bro
The customer watching this guy online Humiliate him on camera and still choose to work with him. 😀
I get that it’s a bit bullish but he did something pretty important. He got the customer to start saying yes. That’s what led him to agree
He is a terrible salesman
I for sure would've cussed him out and gone somewhere else
He should have asked "are you willing to loose a $30k deal over $100?"
Than you will need 300 corners start begging that would have been my response
Why the fuck did this tool end up on my radar? Did Gary vee stop getting sucked off by yt?
Fake so stupid
They both so lame lol. I literally talk to jewelers out of thousands of dollars. Learn about what you’re doing before you try to negotiate like an idiot.
Yet another greaseball who uses boiler room as a training video.
That guy isn't interested in making the sale he is getting off on strong arming that guy into doing something he doesn't want to.  When I picture scummy salesmen this is basically what I imagine
Don’t do this
Purchased a car with cash, that's how my negotiations went but I walked out and they did the begging. Millions of cars out there and theirs isn't anything special.
Wolf of Wall Street  vibesss
30k isn't even that big of a deal. If as a sales person you aren't willing to sacrifice that little bit of margin to help a customer stay in budget or save a little bit of money what is their incentive in working with you.
Con artist
Wanna be wall street skit
This guy sounds like such a scammer
People actually believe this crap  And make deals with this bullshit  Ok 😂😂
I’m no salesman but I can tell that is absolutely not how to close a $30,000 deal.
I think this will backfire a lot
Is it just me or something about this cardone that just isn't right. Hmm.
Ummm this sounds like a horrible scam. Has ANYONE made money with this clown?
This is not how you do business. Your sacrificing 30k over $100 dollars. I wonder how many times this lame said the same thing to a customer and the customer walked away. Don’t believe these YouTube or tic tok videos.
Con
You can see by the look on his face when he says the begging thing, like it's a joke and he is trying it on, like he can't believe he bought that shit. Then immediately says get his credit card details right now....I don't think he will get close to a million 😅
Wow that is some straight up wolf of Wall Street selling confidence there 😅
If you are giving internet gurus $30k you are a certified moron. Phone call is absolutely fake tho
let’s just force shit down there throat & don’t let them talk or speak their mind.
Bs
Negging. Not just for insecure men talking to women anymore. How inclusive.
Love everyone thinking this is an actual customer on the phone.
This fake shit gross
All this shit is so fake it literally hurts
Looks legit.
Why would take someone else 30k to turn it into a million, when he himself probably has 30k to spare  woukdntbhe be better off earning that 970k instead of giving it away for a measly commission? Unless..... he's lying
I have so little clue who this guy is that when I went to google him I had already forgotten the first name and put “nick cardone” And there happens to be a man by that name who did a ted talk. I’m gonna watch it
Scammers!!!!!
Didnt make a fraction of tht millie
Scam
This is actually how to get hung up on
Ew this is a fuckin “sales university” 🤢
That's how you rob emm
This guy can go to actual hell
He pulled The Rock's it doesn't matter! Of course he will seal the deal.
Get his credit card!😂
Wow that guy just paid $30,000 for Grant Cardone university 😂😂😂😂😆
Everyone’s saying this was a horrible way to negotiate but I think it was pure genius. He trapped the buyer by making him think he was cheap for that 100$
The answer is Ney if they are not willing to negotiate.  ALWAYS, I don’t care if it’s a dollar.   Nope, nope, nope. They can keep whatever bullshit worthless thing they are peddling.
If the person was that aggressive towards me I would not do business with them.  That is not professional to bully someone to make them do a transaction.
Cant believe people fall for this nonsens. Its beyond my mind.
Most sales people are dirt balls. I can’t stand a salesman that “will do anything” to make the sale….cause they will
Is Cardone University the equivalent as Trump University?
You become rich by selling weak ppl false hopes and dreams...
This is for his scams that make you believe you’re gonna get rich and shit it’s all snakey marketing and not many ppl get return on their inverstments
F U, I need that discount.
Sooooo did Grant make him a millionaire or what?
This Guy is a fraud.
I'm smelling a scam
Conman
Slime
People always have to feel like they are winning one over on the other person. Don't be fooled by these people claiming they're going to make you a millionaire either. If it was that easy everyone would be a millionaire.
Grant cardone is a joke
What a slimeball
Idk man, if some sale man talk to me like that while I'm holding 30k and about to buy something, it's not gonna work. I'll keep increasing the discount by 100 everytime he belittles me out of it. I'll do it until he realizes that he's lost the negotiation at the first 100 dollars.
This is some real wolf of Wall Street energy here bois🤑!!!!!!!
This guy reminds me of my floor managers at the dealership I worked at. Bunch of con-men
Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Scam
I love how people eat this guy up 🤦🏻‍♂️ he's a fake
The disrespect 🙃
This guy is soo a scam lmaoo
The master in action
So insulting people and making them Feel Dumb is How You get high ticket sales?   Ugh so tired of these clowns Pretending they are wolf of wallstreet or something 😂
This is some slimy, self-obsessed shit.
Never ask for $100 on a 30k deal  But it obviously matters what the 30k is buying.. if it's a service then definitely $3,000, if it's an asset with a known "true" value... it could be $500... never $100
As a salesman, this is the worst tactic you can use. Sure you might make that ONE sale, but you'll be hearing from HR ASAP about mishandling customers with predatory sales tactics. You mightve gotten that sale, but that customer isn't coming back for DAMN sure.
This guy is a scammer lmao
it’s so sad that people sign up for grant cardones courses it’s similar to dan lok
Sounds like a bully tactic. Business is business but when you’re the customer, you do have the right to walk away. Never make a deal without first understanding or accepts position.
Imagine being this pretentious
(Aussie jungle guide voice) “Shh what’s that? I can hear a wild Jordan Belford  approaching folks careful around this next corner”
So being overcharged $100 on a $100 item is a big deal, but if your overcharged $100 on a new car you don’t care???
So these man lent money for business? Anyone knows how to get In touch whit him ? I don't have a business BUT I KNOW A FEW BUSINESSES THAT WILL MAKE HIM A LOT OF MONEY,all I'll ask is a little % !
What’s an absolute douche. That hundred dollars can be used for a ton of things…
Yall need to watch Coffeezilla, he absolutely destroys internet gurus. Grant Cardone is one of em. He lies and promotes fake techniques and sells people false hopes and dreams. Terrible human being. Coffeezilla has multiple vids on him.
The fucking air in this guys head
The mans child college fund $29,900.
Let’s see the follow up on that million.
Nope- I would have told him to go you know what himself
this guy doesn’t care about the customers he only cares about the money lol
Garbage fake person who sells a dream built of stolen techniques and bs tactics that truly do not work in the real world...
all these ppl are slimy but they know how to convince ppl , tbh I think this should be illegal but surprisingly it isn’t . But good job for taking everyone’s money 😐
Wow, what an a.....hole:D I really wanted to kick his butt,  if he would be that shabby to me.
This is garbage haha
People pay a 100k for a education they don’t even use, 30k for something your investing into your own skill set why not you will get a ROI depending on your passion and efforts just a thought.
Yeah definitely patronise the customer and come off as confrontational as possible that’s how you make a sale.
Fake.  The only thing being sold here is Grant Cardones name
Such a bad sales guy !! I’m in sales and I wouldn’t want to loss a deal for $100 dollars you know why sure $100 off go out treat ur self well today for a making a good deal . I would not make deal with someone telling me to go and beg on the street for $100 dollars. Well then u better start doing the same cause u jsut lost a $30k deal for a $100
Smells like Trump University 2.0
Stop assuming stuff, he was hard selling because the other guy couldn’t close the deal so he took the approach that would be best with the person on
The more I see shit like this as I’ve gone through some hard-core struggles and things compare my situation to that person’s I don’t know where he’s gone where he’s been or what he’s done to get where he was to earn their spot or that number one spot but all I can say is every time I hear some shit like this it makes me not want to help people out more and more the older I get every year I turn in a new age
Wow! And all those under privileged family’s out there
I wouldn't close a deal with a man who talked to me like that. You TREAT ME like the mf KING. Not the other way around. I'll take my 30,k else where
The man was already buying, that's why the phone was brought over. He got handed a lot torch and acted like he made the torch and lit the fire
Biggest scammer in America these days
How do I get involved
Bernie Madoff looks younger here
Y’all don’t know shit about sales 😂 it’s called taking it away from them. Brings fear of loss into play so he bought into it. Be confident and you can sell anything at any price
The guy on the phone is a huge sleezeball
"get his credit card info right now....you know, before he can change his mind or realize we are scamming him"
That only works on the weak. Real men will not be bullied by your idiocy. If they feel like you charge 100 to much or 10000 to much than you didnt give them the product they wanted and you failed at the most important part of your job. Smh. 10 years a salesmen I never had a bully moment like this. These ways are why people would rather by a car from a vending machine site now. Smh.
Fast talkers. I woulda asked for 20,000$ off cause they still making money on the deal. You want $30,000? I'll give you 8,000$
The more I watch these videos the more staged I feel they are. I woulda walked on a deal like that had someone come on the phone and talked to me like that. I appreciate his confidence, but that isn’t sales, thats bullying.
Bye! *cardone calls back apologizing and offers $500 off*
Wolf of wall Street bloke
Get he’s credit card right now …. You ain’t making a million but he sure will be
How ya gonna make me a million dollar if ya can't even give me a 100 dollar?
Well Mr. Grant Cardone. . You may have gained that $30k in business. However, after this video, you've lost far more. Lol
This is so fucking fake
He could of been just seeing if they would take 100 of because either way it wouldnt matter on mine or yours. But gives me insite on how you work and manage to get sales
Dude reminds me of the Wolf of Wall St.... btw: Did he just guarentee he'd make him a million dollars from this deal? What a shit talking con artist
This gotta be fake
If you unironically watch grant Cardone pls reevaluate your life
You work for the customer, not the other way around! Would have loved to see his reaction if the customer shut him down right at the end of that horrid rant
Just like a scene from the Office
What did he buy for 30k
If $100 turns your budget upside down than you've done something seriously wrong with your business and shouldn't be an owner!
Yeah I’d have just hung the phone up. Idc who tf is on the other side of the line
Bruh only a scammer can't see the value of 100 dollars
“How man gets scammed out of 30k by sick con artists”
Con artist if i ever seen one.
This is so stupid ... no one makes or brakes a 30k deal for $100 ... this was designed to make this guy seem like a "closer" lol just made you look like an idiot
This is some wolf of Wall Street sounding shit and look how that ended.
Alright, if $100 ain't that big a deal then you won't mind giving me that 100 off it then 👌🏼
I fucking hate salesman.
Lmao dude got jacked
Yess
Staged
Looks like someone on the phone just got absolutely hosed 🧑‍🚒
Anyone else cringe from that sleazy sales garbage?
same guy who fired his whole staff at the beginning of the pandemic and told us to sell all our stocks?
Rare footage of slime in the wild….
Fuck I thought he was tryna buy a house or something but its just this fuck heads course
He is such a scam
He then got pumped then dumped
Lmaooo if someone ever tries this shit, know you’re being conned. Say “wow, you just let a 30k deal go over $100 dollars” and hang up the call or leave, lol. This is the most disrespectful and incompetent way I’ve seen to close a deal  Edit: damn 253 likes? Never had this many before thanks yall 😂👌
Conman 101
That last "get his credit card right now"  This wouldn't be a more obvious scam if he admitted it.
It's all about manipulation and control
Cardone is a pathetic human being
Something about that doesn’t seem right, I wouldn’t trust him.
The Nigerian prince has evolved
Yea he got ripped off lol... this is the guy that guarantees you wealth... all you need ia $300 million... 🤦🏻‍♂️ if your so wealthy... hook the dude up... you said it yourself... its just $100 dollars... and people think this guy is successful... no wonder why this world is so fucked up.
Pressure by a cocky salespitch, yup no balls. Stand your ground, client has all the power, not the salesman.
And I bet he won’t make that man a million dollars lol
"Get his credit card right now" *buys a lot of vbucks*
This guy's a goof and his grandma thinks so too.
This is that wolf of wallstreet shit here boys
Hahah what a scammer.
How fake you can come over? All up man😂
All you guys need to know who grand cardone is, with that broke mindset of yours
"Don't worry about $100" *Warren Buffett has entered the chat*
This is literally the worse video regarding advise ive ever seen
Wtf wat is 100 compared 2 30gs these R sum serious idiots wit more then just mental problems
This felt like a scene from wolf of wall street
How are people this dumb? You do not negotiate. Set a price. Then they say yes or no. That's all there is.
For 30k over 3 years might as well go to college and get Business degree that is actually worth something when you are done
Scammers if india be like
Fake af
Clearly this is just shitty advertising to drive people to check out this guy
These kinds of people are why I left car sales. It was too much pressure for an honest person to work there. We sold Hondas, so the product was great. But the car sales culture killed it. I'm a Financial Advisor now, but I still drive Hondas/Acuras.
My answer to his bs would be "this conversation is over. "
Everything you said could be turned right back around on you. If you're that worried about $100 you should be begging on the corner
Jordan Belfort behind his screen like “you’re not that guy pal, you’re not that guy”
How to get conned 101
Get his credit card right now 😂
Just like every great scam artist, this guy will show you how to manipulate people but make it look convincing for a mere $30.000... what a joke
I don’t trust people who talk like this way, and I don’t like to make any business with them.
"You know who this is?" Immediately cuts because they didn't.
What a shark
Another poor guy gets scammed what a pos
And still to this day hasn't made anyone but himself a million dollars lol used to believe in this man until I read his Financials and the lawsuits he's getting for scamming people. Lmao
Screw all that, that there a con man.
Nope.
I work in sales and this dude is some fking sliiiime.  "Doesn't matter who it is" yeah here comes the plausible deniability.
"my, man"
take this shit out of here
If you’re concerned about a 100$ discount on a 30k$ sale, maybe you’re juste not able to turn those 30k into a million yourself.   If you want me to invest a full Bitcoin in you, ya better sho more respect with your customers.   That’s not how you talk to someone who gives you 30k. This is fucking aggressive.   I have no problem with the fact that when you pay 30k, is stupid to ask 100$ discount. But respect is the basis of the relationship with your customers.
And that’s how the Wolf of Wallstreet started!
There was a movie made about a guy who started a whole business based off this selling style it’s call “wolf Wall Street” 😂
Pride is a bitch I’d walk away 😂
That’s why suckers like that who lose all their money say yes. Atleast we know grant taking care of his money himself 🤣
This is like that one scene in the wolf of Wall Street straight up
Him: if you let 100...  Me : hangs up the phone
Let someone talk to me like this I finna hang up end of the deal 🤦‍♂️
He is right though a hundred dollars is nothing compared to thirty thousand dollars. Especially over three years the first guy should have closed that sale no problem. But yeah does seem a little fishy the way he said you got his credit card information right after.
That dude is a boss!
“Get his credit card right now” isn’t something legitimate business people say.
Nope - no deal. It's easy. You can go and buy the same stuff elsewhere. 🤷‍♂️ It's about principle.
Do you know who I am? Any one who says that I automatically have no respect for
I would have shut that shit down. He knew he was talking to a boy.
That’s just a bad salesman if u every actually did some business u would know not to tell your costumers to go bag on a street corner and u would also not shout get his credit card so loud that he can Hear it …
This is why I hate salesman you want 100 off that 100 doesn’t mean anything in 3years... okay so give him the 100 off if it doesn’t mean anything like tf...
I would’ve been like yep it’s just a $100 dollars. Either do or don’t but you’ll either make 30k or lose 30k.
Grant cardone doesn’t know shit but how to swindle
Wolf of Wall Street part 2! Get his credit card right now!
Don't do a deal with a piece of shot like this. His rich from scamming people.
This is the reason I hate sales people. Move along buddy.
It a fake it to make it world. Just stay awake enough to not fall for this kinda shit, be humble, not gullible!
Keep the $30k and buy Dogecoin.
This is the signs of a scammer
Man I'm getting a Conning Wolf of Wall Street Matthew Mcconaughey vibe.
Telling a “customer” they should be on a corner begging. Any real person would immediately say nah, now you’re not losing $100 but $30,000 and all credibility. I bet he sells a self help e course too😂😂 dudes not a deal closer he’s an asshole
"You're willing to lose this deal for $100"  You're right, make it 1k
this man a whole scam.
Lmao such trashy people
This guy is a con.
Another rip off
So the guy on the phone just lost 30k from some "guru" saying he can make him a million I hate these guys I almost lost money with this same person it sounds great but it's all shit unless your already well off
Fn crooks
00:00
Imagine getting punked by Cardone lmao
When I bought my car they were trying to charge me 250 for delivery. I told them I don’t want to pay delivery. They said are you going to walk over 250 dollars. I said I don’t know, are you going to let me walk over 250 dollars. He smirked and shook my hand. Saved 250 bucks!
Does anyone actually believe this Hollywood style of selling? What bull
In the world of interest rates. $100 over 3 years can be a lot of money. Dude just got played like a fiddle by a guy being "Alpha", for lack of a better term, on a phone call
Don’t ever listened to anyone talking to you this way. Hang up and go somewhere else.
Cardone University? Wasn’t there another university the former president got sued for?
Matt McConaughey in Wolf of Wall Street.
This looks like something from family guy
Sadly, many people fall for this simple psychological trick.
$100 isn't making much of a difference when you're doing sales in $30k
Yea screw this guy !
Delete this account
He is fake
I’d have told him to piss off and hung up.
Damn boy! You closed on them sucks just like Jordan Belfort probably for something similar in value as he sold his customers I bet 🧐😳🙄😂🤣
There's always a better deal somewhere else. That was a rude cocky ass salesman.
And this is cardone being a cocky shithead.. if I was that salesmen and was possibly going to make 10 percent of 90 racks and cardone loses my sale over a measly 100 bucks I would have lost my shit.. I’ll take $9,000 and sacrifice 100 bucks .. and number 2 cardone only did that cause the guy knows who he is ..
Slim ball for sure I'm listening to how he talks and sells and I know him, I know 100 guys like him he's literally a Conman period. Always trying to tow the line with his business morals. Missleading and trying to corner people with tactical questions that force them to give specific responses. Not to mention if you look into him he obviously gambles with people's money by messing with the real estate market in a volatile manner. He owes more then has available and he convinces people to trust him with their money. Wolf of wall street  much when shit goes sideways this guy will walk off richer then before.
The real joke was the weak salesman who clearly disappointed his boss and wasted his time.
Seems like grant hires weak sales reps  Get his credit card number right now
Yeah this dude is a complete con. I doubt he has any actual money and it’s all being laundered. Edit just did some research and his business seems like a classic money laundering scheme disguised as “money management”
Now that's a CLOSER
“Get his credit card rn” damn
I think he paid the guy 100$ to fake call 😂
If $100 wasn’t an issue for a multi millionaire to be worried about, then why didn’t he go ahead and just waive the $100? Oh yeah, he wants to bleed people of all their money, get them to pay for 10X so other “speakers” can sell their bs too
People like the caller being sold regurgitated info for $30k is what makes me stay away from these so-called gurus
If someone talked to me like this trying to sell me something, im hanging up
30k for a seminar and the kid put it on his credit card? Really
Scammer
"If you're interested in $100 you need to find  a street corner to beg on..." wow
How to manipulate and rape a innocent man of $30,000
He sounds like he’s about to make you sign something but doesn’t want you to read an an just keeps talking fast
You know your business model is tight when you’re scrambling to get someone’s credit card info before they realize you just bilked them
Who is this sleeze ball... God help me if I let him run my business, someone might actually murder me.
Get his card card right now.
Grant Cardon't
I would of hung up
Ummm I think that was reversed reversed psychology…. 🤣 you can take the same thing and ask the bigger company that question
Oh you just got got son
"Get his credit card right now"  What a scammer man, wtf ?
Don’t listen to this dude! Fake guru
If money os what makes you happy like the man in this video your lost people.
No one has ever watchee,  The wolf of wall street?
This dude is real fucking con man. 100% u lose 30k there
“Get his credit card RIGHT NOW” 😂😂😂 he said fuck dat man
Nick just signed up for Amazon affiliate YouTube university
Fuckin beast
This man puts a whole new meaning to con artist.
He probably has framed motivational posters on his office walls.
I would have went to another company and told him make his money on the street corner .
“A sucker is born everyday” WC Fields
Atrocious close…so overrated but kudos to him for finding success, always respect the hustle
Yeahh but the guy could've said the same thing back because they also were worried just as much about the $100. So by that logic they should meet in the middle somewhere.. right
For some people 100$ is a lot of money.  Fck u buddy.
They finally pronounced Gigguk's name correctly!!
Fake
Omg, worst sales advice ever🤣
What a load of BS
If clients are only interested in the price and not the cost then they don’t see the value and they will only narrowly focus on your product. Not good clients, I wouldn’t be interested. I’ll give them “discounts” if we have been working together for a while and I understand their budgets and how they spend money.
He is such a bad person
The take away.
What is this guy even selling? Scam
Straight up con like all the ones before him.
that’s how you scam someone for 30,000 lol
A penny saved is a penny earned. Keeping my $100. Screw that big mouth. He’ll be the one on the corner.
Shitty business man
Con… just run. Pressure sales exist for worthless products
The wolf of twitter
The new wolf of the market
The guy at the start of the clip sounds EXACTLY like Ninja.
Full of shit. They have money from scaming people...thats why they are rich. Its a family biz
what a scam.he selling him some training webinar milioner lessons shitfakes and this milioner teacher cant give you a discount of 100$.the best way to become rich is to sell other people hope and lies that they are special and they become rich.
🤣🤣🤣 I just picture Leonardo DeCaprio (wolf of wallstreet) flipping the caller off while convincing him to take the deal of a lifetime.
Earnings claim… I want my claimed earnings or imma sue.
He studied under Bernie Madoff!
A.) If a sales guy belittles you on the sales call its probably b.s. B.) Why does this come up on the Googs if 30k is gonna make me a millionaire : Real estate crowdfunding guru Grant Cardone is facing allegations that he's misled thousands of investors across the country by falsely promising them annual returns of at least 15 percent and other incentives that never materialized
This is some wolf of Wall Street shit
Walk away
It's like a less dramatic and somehow faker seeming version of Mike's first meeting with Nacho.
This guy made millions scamming other people by telling them he'll make them millions. But doesn't actually know how to make millions without scamming others.
This is how you shut down haggling, its business, and it is in fact dumb af
Spoke too soon, just googled this guy and its not lookin good. He has misled a bunch of investors. Not a good look GC.
Wow! We will see this guy being indicted soon.
Is there any millionaire proven to be a millionaire because of shit like this?
You can tell he's a con. He has a tie on and that top button, is unbuttoned. That is a tight Windsor knot... Like he's trying to hard.
I sell properties for a living; I made just under 230k last month. £228,937.03 to be specific.    *This wasn’t a close, it was a set-up for the camera*   Do not follow Grant Cardone’s actions because it will DEFINITELY lose you a sale.   Nobody (unless ridiculously rich and outrageously generous) in their right mind parts ways with 5 figures over the phone.
Grifter
Wolf of wall Street wannabe snake oil salesman
'Let me put you on the spot, Nick. Asking for a discount isn't gonna change much though you can buy groceries with it, I don't give a damn about you because that's suppose to be my money. I'm the alpha male here, yes or no? I'm going to barrage you with words and pressure you, yes or no?'
And this is how they con you out of your money!
Dude is a con man pure and simple.
What a scammer
Frauds
Don't give a damn what your name is. You'd have lost that sale with me. Negotiation is a two way street and the second you dare talking to me like that you'd have been hang up left to dry
I’m telling you no. The fact that you’re acting big and tough over $100 bucks is pathetic
You're charging that man 30,000 dollars for your university. SCAM
One way or another he’s gonna make him beg in the streets
Grant cardone CON MAN
I really don't like this guy.. sounds like a scammer
Ego's be floodin the comments
Wow, man tickled his chin into investing 30k after hesitating (probably REALLY digging into the pocket on the gamble)
STAGED
This guy will definitely be investigated by the FBI.
More cuts than the “quiet kid’s” forearm
When the punisher decides to change his career path
I would have said no
Grant Cardone is somehow capable of being the biggest douchebag without realize it.
Dude just lost 30k + $100
Wow, who signs up for this shit?
Would have been nice to see him tell him up yours and a big NO. Just on principal alone..
I would have hung up after he said it doesn't matter who this is. You trying to sell me and you act disrespectful like that I'd tell you to kick rocks. Also this is 30k sale are you willing to let me walk over $100? It's better to let the customer feel like they got a win and get a couple referrals from them rather than haggle over $100.
Rude and disconnected from people, swimming in his own ego.....
Wait do you have a university?
Comes off as a prick
Ah yes Cardone, the biggest fraud on the internet
Grant cardone is just the newest con man on the block. I can’t believe people even give this jerk the time of day.
Guilting people into giving you money is closer to begging
Wolf of Wall Street who…
If you talk to me like that you lost yourself a customer.
Found another sucker🤣🤣😍🤣🤣😍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why in the hell would they even post this? Anyone who speaks in that tone of voice and says those types of things is a clear scammer. I mean, they didn't even bother cutting out the "get his credit card right now" line.. I've heard of this guy before because MeetKevin exposed him and his scams previously many times in the last. Clearly they're not even smart con artist if they post their tactics online for the world to see and brag about it.
What a tool.
I definitely see someone becoming a millionaire using this course and it is not the person buying it.
Grant cardone: dont give your money to banks.... give it to me instead
Guess who should really be begging on a corner? This guy worried about letting a POS car go for $100 less....
This is how you hustle. Someone does this, you drop the deal.
It sounded like a scam at first, but when he said his name was Grant Cardone I realized it just is a scam
That dude is absolutely a scam artist. “Get his credit card right now”. People like that are legit the biggest pieces of shit alive.
Yeah I’m gonna give 30k to a guy who won’t even give me his name or show his face..
Grant ur worker is a pussy I need a job ASAP he might be smart be he def don’t have balls to be a boss or make decisions or close with out the back and forwards haggling u did it like a pro the car game def teaches u how to close a deal fast
No sales dude is allowed to talk to me like that. There are thousands of other dudes, selling the same and negotiate with a customer in a good manor.
Well wouldn’t this guy also be worried about that same $100 using his logic?
$30,000 for a course what a goddamn scam. “ get his credit card and charge it bbuuuaahahaha SUCKER..”
Staged show off,  and bad sales skill tbh
Find a street corner to beg on … phone disconnected!
If YOU are worried about giving the customer $100, YOU need to go beg on a street corner! Butch! All he did was try to humiliate the buyer to make him feel like he wasn’t worthy or good enough to do the deal. Butch is a conman. No thanks
Fraaaaaaudddddd
Put the coffee down. Coffee is for closers.
These are scams why trust a person.
I would be saying "fuck off you don't talk to me like that"
ABCMF
Who tf gone give this man 30,000 for a class
Scam Artist. Looks at this guys sleeeze, geeez!!
These types of sales people are disgusting.
These dudes just scamming
3 3rd
The worst part is this is for a “education to wealth” or whatever bullshit these “gurus”. Say goodbye to that 30k
Wolves of wall street  kind of deal closure
Id just interupt him and say yeah sure
That was staged….no one who do business with a prick like that……yet they do…in their droves🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
😲🥱🤭🙄A con man if I ever did see one 🙄
Slimy POS. Such a sumbag
Trolled! Conned!
Wolf of wall street
I’ve been around too many people to know that if someone is talking like that they are the one that’s desperate, and absolutely do not care for your well being.
"Oh btw this is grant cardone-" "Who?"
The minute he started that shit…..I’d laugh and say no sun…..you just lost yourself 29,900……bitch, the fact the guy let him speak to him like that is crazy!
So traded is real I just got my new house, money from investment trading, trade with the right broker and enjoy your profit, Mrs Tracy Britt thank you ma'am.
That would never fly with Asians..... 😂
I would not do business with anyone who has this attitude. I know a con man when I see one.
Pfft.. Cardone University. Who the hell fall for these fake gurus. 🤡🤡🤡🤡
This is wolf of Wall Street all over again...
Get his credit card rite nowb
Yeah that is true
I would love to have a percentage of his confidence.
"Damn u right" *hangs up
Straight 100% conman.  Only poor idiots get fooled by scammers like this guy.
Used car salesman....no offense to used car salemen.
How do people still listen to this guy?
So… overrated.
When you have to push so hard for a sale you way too desperate and flashing red light to give it a miss
Customer took a fat L
Xenu sure is greedy
He just embarrassed him into agreeing. But technically Grant is interested in $100 too because he just grabbed the phone to make sure he got that extra hundo
I would never give a penny to a guy who talks to me like that.
One year later and the guy is still broke
Such bullshit! Hucksters at work! He's rich from selling his workshops!
How to scam over the phone 🤣🤣🤣
Con artists at work
"WhO????"
These are the type of car salesmen I walk out on. Millionaires are millionaires because they are concerned about every last penny. So fight for what you want  whether it’s $100 or $.01.
Lol what? The buyer was ready to give him $29.900 on the spot, so this dude didn’t “close the deal” on anything - he whined up the deal by $100 - congrats.  How come his argument about “if it’s down to $100 don’t do it” doesn’t apply to his shitty scam, I wonder.
he just got finessed
Imagine being so naive and maleable to fall for this manipulation tactic 😂
Scam artist
That's confidence at peak. Nikki was owned
Y would this be a movie where Matthew mcconaughey plays this guy
Chris Handson to catch a predator.
I have zero clue what these idiots are selling but my first thought is this:  If $100 doesn’t matter then why are YOU haggling over it
Proper con artist tactics.
Cordone university?????????
Its funny how none business/ none successful people are telling a multibillionaire how to close a deal…. The hate in this world is crazy
Sleazy salesman
Isn’t grant cardone a scammer
This is so fake it’s hilarious
Wolf of —————— street !! Slim ball.. this guy has got the devil inside his soul.. yes from now he want be able to sleep at night..
Sounds staged
I was getting my oil changed one time at the dealership I had gone to.for years. Their new shop manager was talking to me and I jokingly was like why the price go up 10 bucks am I getting better oil. He said if 10 bucks is what I'm worried about then to get my oil changed somewhere else lol.... its principle, you don't say shit like that to customers.. I stopped supporting their shop and called the dealership manager to know why. He comped me 10 free oil changes and said he would talk to the shop manager...
That’s how you sell shit…manipulation is a hustle it’s the 21st century
What a stupid closing strategy!  If you ever speak with a customer professionally you will lose him for ever.
That is such a petty thing to do , give him the 100 like dam
My answer is no. If $100 doesn't make a difference, why do you want it from me so bad?
Can’t tell if he’s a car salesman or a marine corps recruiter, but I know one thing. Don’t trust him.
Scam
Bully game😂
Anytime someone is pushing you to say yes and kind of talking down on you, they’re a scam
Idk what he's buying but I would have hung up and put my $29,900 elsewhere
Car salesman mentality
Biggest scammer ever
Get his credit card right now
Fucked up. Rip the poor dude that just paid 30k for business training... Lesson 1, don't fall for this shit.
Never let a nickel hold up a dollar. Solid close, a bit cheesy though
I woulda hung up the phone
The guy in the phone is an intern hiding in a back office
“Alright, well have a good one.” Is the proper response to someone pressuring you that much
Never listen to this conman Grant listen to Dave Ramsey
I used to be a salesman and never spoke like this, it’s far too obvious. Work for a product worth buying and you don’t have to sell yourself, only the product.
Coming from someone in sales I can say with first hand experience that calling a customer a homeless panhandler is the last strategy that you want to use
I say yes then hang up and never answer again. Crawfish like a mother 🤣
This is so fuckin fake
I saw this clown on wolf of Wall Street.,
I’d have told him to go f himself after he talked to me like that clown
How to close a scam
how to scam somebody and boast about it on social media
“ Get his credit card right “😂😂😂
"Do you know who this is?" "It doesn't matter who this is." "I'm Grant Cardone."
what kind of shitty scam is that?!
As somebody who works in sales and has seen countless Grant Cardone videos, it is extremely apparent how shitty this guy is. It’s sad so many people in the business see this guy as somebody to look up to and aspire to be. In sales part of the deal is helping people. Those like Cardone give the industry a bad name
Jesus what a scam
Yeah I would have hung up.
Ironic how he doesn’t want to give up $100 because it couldn’t mean anything but he can’t do the same.
"You know what guys, you're right.. $100 is nothin, how bout a real discount, let's go 20% off the top. What do you say?"
I'm really glad to see the responses on here that I am seeing. Makes me have a little hope.
Jordan Belfort wannabe...
Dont ever try to pull this off in the real world!
Sales person give me that kinda BS the deal is off. Don't con me.
“Get his credit card right now.” That sounds suspiciously like somebody who wants to charge him before he backs out of your scam.
This dude sucks
People who begin statements saying, "I tell you what...", make me stop listening and start thinking, "how can I get out of this conversation."
If someone talked to me like that they wouldn’t be getting my money.
Hey Grant you might to change your buisness strategy lol this country is “woke A.F now 🤣 just read the comments
Reverse uno
🤣🤣🤣moron
Boy, see the slime just sliding off of that saleman lol
Man I get it. But sometimes a customer wants a small win and it can totally change how they perceive you. $100 off of $30 k ? Let him have it. If people think you're a shark, then they're not coming back
That's how scammers act, you filter only the top dumbest people to get into your scheme and only the ones willing to waste the most amount of money. If the customer was smart enough to back out of that deal than he didn't belong in the course. The guy on the phone, if this is not staged, is so submissive and trusting of Cardone that he would never sue Cardone, and if He did, he's so dumb he would probably get scammed again in the process. Cardone isn't impressive as a salesman neither as a conman, this is scamming 101, the only impressive thing is how dumb people can be.
He just got took lmao. If you believe this man will take your 30k and turn it to a million your an idiot.
Grant never used to act like this, shame he turned into such a sleezy car salesman
Garbage…
How to get in touch with
Cardone University sounds like a scam
The difference between a Amateur and an Expert Sales Associate
Lol always tell a conman
As soon as he said if you are worried about 100 don't do it I would have said ok thanks and hung up on his ass.
Rule #1 of any deal: Be willing to walk away.
“A penny saved is worth more than a dollar earned” is what some old millionaire car salesman I used to work for would always say,
Cardone really needed that 100 huh
Wolf of wallstreet right here
Sounds like a scam to me
Run away
I knew he was fake when he sat down with a young millionaire and you could see his envy! Tried to belittle him at every turn! Winners don’t envy and belittle as they don’t have to. This phoney is insecure which is why he was talking crap about billion dollar deals when he went to Jordan’s place
Hi I sell snake oil! Knew he was fake as soon as I saw him a few years back! Youtube phoney
$100 on 30k who even??
What he’s definitely not going to do:   Make that guy a million dollars.
That is not how sales works AT ALL. This a pyramid scheme or what?
POS
Such a hypocrite. Making 30k off the man and he asks for 100 off. Grant says you should beg on the corner if you're that worried about 100 dollars. Is grant not the aggressor and more worried about the 100 dollars than this man was?
This looks like a scene directly out of The Wolf of Wall Street 💀💀
The way he speaks is very disrespectful. I wouldn't take or give this man a dime and hopefully people will see through his  ways.
This guy is an absolute idiot. If the sale is this big and they want that $100 discount you give it. It means nothing to you and a lot to them.
Whatever you say, Bruce Wayne.
Wow boss
If you could be a millionaire in 5 years off cryptocurrency would you invest now or wait until its too big to get in
You guys talking about "if they talked to me like this then"....a salesman dealing with a 30k sale doesn't care about the hundred bucks....neither does the customer....it's a power play, and folks spending that kind of doe on a phone sale don't get their feelings hurt ..iron sharpens iron....anything else gets ruined....y'all to deep in your feelings.
Snake oil
He's the one interested in, if I was on the other end of the phone I would hang up and look for another deal.
Little did I know how far I'd have gone if I started trading and investing sooner, but
Con man
If my boss jumped my sales and talked about me like that, he'd be on the ground
Thats some ass backwards logic. The big grant Cardone is willing to risk a deal for 100 bucks? Lol.  What a fake
Shit sales
Another sucker swept away by high-pressure sales.
"Get his credit card right now" smh
So if $100 is nothing, why not give the $100 to the guy If “it’s only $100”? Now that right there is a piece of shit. I’m all for being a business man but sometimes it’s really not that fucking bad to lose out on $100 to help someone else out. You can be a businessman and still be humble.  These are the types people that ruin the reputation for other CEO’s of companies/anyone that’s successful. It’s so fucking pathetic just how greedy some people can be.   Always be humble. Always remember your roots. Always help if you can.
That hard sell voice throws up red flags for me. Guy tried doing this to sell me a time share and it set off my fight or flight.
He couldn't talk to me like that. I'll be knocking on his door with a big ol stick wit some big ass clips and tell him to repeat what he said earlier on the phone
Rude asf ill hang up as soon as he started sounding like a wolf of wall street wanna be
Steeeeeeeeevvvveeeeee maaaaaadddddeeeennnnnn
How do we know this isnt staged?
Somtimes that hundred off will get you a sale , instead of talking to customer that way wich is risking losing a sale.
"Cardone university" sounds just like Trump's University where a ton of gullible people have Trump money for basically no
If $100 don't matter so much then why don't you give him the discount? Like you said he's gonna spend $30k. You're an enormous multi million dollar company. What's $100 to you?   That's if this phone call wasn't set up just for a YouTube video
The next madoff but except  He learned from him..
What a slime bag.
He never would have gotten that far with me
And he never saw that $30k again
For real help with sales Read a book called Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss.
Nick should have responded it seems like you are not really interested in doing this deal. (I agree high pressure sales like this is almost always a bad thing for the customer.)
Negotiating should be taught in high school
If it’s takes to be that fake and greedy to close a $30,000 sale, you know your getting jacked. This guy can’t play with the 6 & 7 digit closers for that very greasy reason! If it floats, you know what it is!
Wtf if you are worried about a hundred dollars you need to find a street corner to beg on wtf 😒 this guy is a bitch for that
Huckster
I would have told Todd he lost the sale because of the asshole that grabbed the phone.  Click!
The answer is inaudible. The line just goes dead. You talk like that to people in the U.S. and you might get somewhere, but in many parts of the world, and people who come from there, you’ll lose more business than just that one deal if you try this tactic.
Idk why people do these kinda deals... u don't inveat money you're not ready to lose, if you invest 100 dollars and you're ok with that beong gonw do it... but 30k? Ever watched Wolf of Wallstreet, same scam
Thats just a shitty way to talk to people
He’s right about one thing, if $100 means that much to him in a deal with that has to do with that much money then he shouldn’t bother. But if I’m talking to someone on the phone and they were talking to me like that I’m hanging up right away, no chance I’m doing business with them.
Better call Saul My stoned mind
I will never be talked into a sale for anything. If I want it I get it, if I'm not sure I walk away until I am sure. Getting talked into shit is stupid.
Coffeezilla loves these guys. They make great content for how you're being scammed
Scammers
Everyone ripping him on here but I really don’t see the problem. A man talking to another man. A lot of fragile people these days.
What a bullshit way to talk to somebody.  He’s letting you know that he’s in charge and you are weak.
There is one commodity which is not cheap to earn but very cheap to lose ..  self-respect  !!!  Not everyone wants to become Jeff Bezos
Sounds more  like my cell phone line...with bunchaaa hidden fees.!! Robbing me $$
How to close a $29,900 deal in 5 seconds... $100 off? Only for you my man. Done
Still on speaker- get his credit card numbers NOW! Ummmm click!
literally hate this guy
Wolf
Imagine not knowing this wasn’t staged 🤣🤡
And this is the world we live in.. if someone spoke to me like that, face to face, I'd crack his eye socket. Invest in YOURSELF, not others.
It's funny how he thinks he is showing how great he is, but when you scan the comments they are all saying what I came here to say, and it totally backfires lol
#RacistGrantCardone
So overall what is taking place here I'm missing something
Social media is fun until the psycho narcissists take center stage. So boring.
"$100 one way or the other doesn't make a difference"  Umm so I get $100 off then?
Con artist to the max lmaoooooo
Even without the promise of generating $1M, and just considering the cost of $30k over 3 years, why tf you asking for a rounding error of $100 off of $30k? 😂
Typical sleaze ball salesman.
Your a sleezy ass salesman. If a hundred dollars is the difference just sell it. This goes both ways
This is what car dealers say before they sell a bad car
This guy seems slimy AF
They way he talks, the accent, and the way he looks screams con
Not buying it!
A lot of people seem to be missing the point. If these sales guys can be pushed around for $100, they might not be capable of making $1 million for this guy.
No one cares dude. I’m not sure if you’ve noticed but the cocky jerk is NOT something people are as excited to see after the plague that just went thru. Do something worth watching maybe?
The client got the money obviously so wtf is a $100 discount that you gonna spend somewhere else anyways going to do for you?? Mr Cardone just squeezed the cheapness out of him and saved his deal haha business is business…
Wow, so impressed with his insane selling skills , crazy how 100$ was the issue on a 30,000$ sale… so hard to close almost impossible and this guy did it… only a god can come down and close a deal like that. I got sold just seeing this video. Send me his bank account I’ll fucking wire the damn 100$ !! Matter fact I’ll Do the 30,000$ cash .
Just a marketing guy LOL  sales ppl would understand this
Pretty sure Cardone takes your money like Trump University or DeVry
That's every time I buy a used car
If the $100 doesn’t matter, then take it off the price for him. It shows that you’re not just trying to scam him and you’re going to be an actually ally
This guy with his BS university is nothing but a scammer.
Probably fake phone call
First off, don't insult your prospect. Second, build perceived value in your product. He's just pressuring the guy into a sale, which sounds fishy to begin with. Any salesman that talks to you this way is not earning your business. Go to someone who will treat you with respect.
This guy seems like a scum bag.
This is staged  Now one would stay on the phone after being talked to like that
Next wolf of Wallstreet
"Street Corner Salesman" This is not how you overcome a sales objective but insulting  your potential client.
Classic scumbaggery
I HATE sales. Slimiest job there is.
Scamer cardone
Why would ANYONE PAY a stranger to make them money?   Let’s just think about that.   He’s offering to make a stranger a million dollars. All the stranger has to do is pay him.   If I knew how to make a lot of money on a great deal I would do it for myself.  Never for a stranger. Maybe friends and family and I certainly wouldn’t tell strangers about it.   Let’s just think about that.   He is telling a stranger, on the phone that he will make them a million dollars if they pay him some money.   “Get his credit card details”,  is the most honest interaction we see and hear in this whole clip.
He is one of the premier charlatans of this era!
That’s a no for me. $100/- if it’s a small win for the customer, why not? That attitude will leave to make decisions and build a pattern that only serves yourself. In the end, you will a decision like that will have consequences! But good luck to you
If he cant afford the $100 he should beg on a corner but you can’t afford to lose that $100... interesting. . .
Hope y’all don’t think this is real lmao
I'm not sure what this company does, but seeing as how this dicknuts just talked somebody out of a 100 dollar discount by insulting him, for an advertisement, we can be pretty sure this company isn't in the advertising game.
This guy is so greasy I bet he doesn’t even get wet in the rain.
Good shit grant
I've called that bluff with a dealership. They ended up calling me right back and when they did I just laughed and asked for 500 off for wasting my time. I never thought they'd do it... But they did. 🤣🤣🤣
He sounds like a scammer.
Anyone talks to me like this i hang up
So many experts in the comments. The Comments! Lmao. 💰💰💰
I hope that’s all fake and planned so that nobody gave this guy $30,000
I remember someone called me and offee something like this.  I just shut my phone. $100 is $100. If you're worried about $100, don't do it. If someone else tells you not to worry about $100, DON'T DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF MAN.
This is insult to his intelligence  and his worth as a customer. Hence best action would be not to fall for this deal as it will be hard ship for u for a long time
If you think this was real and not staged, you haven't spent enough time on social media.
I'm sensing strong wolf of the wall street vibes here
The guys actually pretty great.. u guys are shmucks
reminds me of wolf of wall street.
I don't care if its a penny, if I tell you thats what i want to pay and you come up with slick talk like that I'm out.
GRANT: YAE OR NAE?
And he never saw his 30K again...
No its just the intimidation factor, any white person who sounds like a cowboy is scary
Sounds like a man that's never been punched in the face before
And I saw this guy tweaking while giving an inspirational speech...
Old tight silver head azz 😂 give the man his 100 dmn
This dude is hilarious haha I wonder if people buy his shit.. he goes to get a burger “hey kid why you making $15 an hour when you should be making 15 million an hour”? Then the kid says get tf out of here you snake oil selling sleezeball
A horrible pitch, he said "Do u know eho this is" Lol It dont matter of its Grant Cardone he sounds so arrogant
I hate salespeople like this i would've just hung up the phone
So apparently Grant Cardone needs to be begging on street corners since he was willing to kill the deal over $100?   This is such a talentless hard-sell I’d just laugh in the guys face and tell him if he needs my $100 that much,  he must be a terrible salesman and needs a new job.
What an ass of a guy
I would of just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum with money instead wasting it on that 🤦‍♂️
They’re too white. They reminded me of Get Hard, the movie.
Oh yeah grant the guy with a shitty REIT the returns 6% each year before taxes and fees
Lol. If I thought they were 100 bucks to high, I would have said no thanks to the deal.
Well you are not only a scam artist but a pos as well, congrats Grant 👏
The insecure dude on the phone just lost 30k not just a hundred🙈
This really feels like a con man pressuring you.
Yeah you talk to me like that I'm walking away. I don't really care who you are
Don't forget the name grant cardone people. He'll treat you like shit do you really want to spend money on a arrogant condescending prick wit your money he needs u to survive u don't need him wat a douchebag
Covid got rid of all the seniors to scam 🤷
Is he one of the crypto scammers like here in the comments?
Watch Coffeezillas videos about Grant Cardone
Pffft that's not a real objection. $100 on 30k sale lol. You're kidding right
When it seems like it's for business then he says Grant Cardone University like what 😂 fake guru garbage 🤡
You sound like a money grabbing meany.
I find it slightly disrespectful in Holland he’d lose the order
This is a joke. 'Nick" is a Cardone employee. NO ONE that can spend 30k would let a salesman belittle them.
Would be nice to see this thief behind bars where he belongs
Cardon is a con
I would totally not buy anything from someone talking to me like that.
Someone once told me that deals can be made or not; over a few words, rather than a few dollars. It was literally a used car salesman. This asshat would have lost my deal because of a the few words, not over the few dollars. I would never trust someone acting this way, EVER. F'n con artist bs. If someone can't see that, I have little hope for them. Next thing you know they'll vote for a known con man/reality T.V. star for POTUS.
" his credit card, right?"
I thought at first he was trying to talk him out of spending $30k. I didn’t know it was a sales pitch.
i'd hang up and keep 30k
I would peace out. ✌️
I love the way that this is obviously some kind of scam Enterprise but the funniest thing is that the dude is kind of dressed as a stereotypical con man lol
It’s funny this is supposed to be some flashy “here’s how you do it” video…. The customer isn’t any good at negotiating.  Up next a grown man shows us how to box with a 14yr old…
Dude, this sales tactic does NOT work anymore- it is NOT the 80s... LOL You want to avoid annoying sales people like this? Hangup.
Lmao I would’ve walked away and took my 30k to someone who respects me over the phone
I would've hung up immediately. Poor doormat
If someone talked to me like this, I'd hang up. That's a pressure sale. It's a tactic of desperation and FUD.
Who else Googled Cardone University scam?
Thanks for doing business with Douche Douchebag enterprises.
This must have been a car salesmen. Worst sales people ever. Try getting a $10 million dollar deal and see how that goes.
I wouldn't give that guy 30 cents. The I got fish guy.
Meh.. I would’ve hung up after the first 2-3 seconds…
The fake guru is back
He’s worth 300 mil though
Grant cardone and all these clowns who claim to help others make it in real estate should all shove their advice where the sun don't shine.
There is no way I would haggle over $100  in a $30k sale.
What a douche
This call sounds like some the wolf of Wall Street type of shit
Who tf spends 30k over 3 years
Dude is a Freud
Used car salesman business tactics.
Wolf of Wallstreet wasn't a lie?
“Yay or nay? Yay or nay? Ya wanna be in debt? Yay or nay? Yay or nay? Come on nick ya Fukien poosi, who am I huh? IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT MY NAME IS YAY OR NAY?”
Cordonne University.. More like get Conned University
The end where he says, “get his credit card right now.” Is enough for me to know this dude is a con artist and an asshole
Sound like grant needs a punch
Fucking shit sales technique. Basically bullying people till they say yes on the phone. And then ain't seen for dust when it's time to commit. Stick to properties mate.
Fake … to aggressive… you don’t talk to people like that Just hang up the phone… byeee
This is called high pressure sales. The man is spewing pure bullshit out of his mouth. If $100 doesn't matter then why not give it to him? Only one reason to put that kind of pressure during a sale and that's because the deal is bullshit and if they think too long about it they will walk. You are forcing a customer to make an impulse decision. Someone does this to you, you should always walk away and think about it. They will still be there selling bullshit tomorrow I assure you.
That guy bench 225 in high school and Bench 225 right now. What the fuck can you teach me about numbers. You are just good with paper.
“Get his credit card right now” that’s some slimy words man. Its unnatural how many likes the comment section gets on this video lmao.
Scam Alert
The reason a 30k deal is worthy of bragging about for this guy is because he treats clients like this. He gets hung up on more often than not I’m sure
The answer was nay. .33% of 30000 is not a loss,if it was the company would of already failed. Greedy.
My man just lost his 30k
He’s lucky he owns his own company because he couldn’t get a sales job on a buy here pay here lot with that skill set
So this guys a professional grease ball?
This is acting...Real life dont qoek like this. You will chase away all the good ones
dude became the Rock for a second
Insulting him by saying he's broke works everytime
This guy is a legal scammer! Anyone who gives money to people like this are crazy!
Fastest way to be scammed lmao
Just a reminder.  When people talk to you like this in real life you are supposed to punch them in the fucking face.
Dude seems like total BS. I agree with people here. If people are talking to you like that they are hiding so much shit. They can’t make money in their own so they have to steal yours. This DB will be cool in the news in the future. Cardone, you are a douche bag
This guy is pure trash of course you sell a book a seminar and ,12k a seat you became a millionaire lmao I love the ridiculous amount of money they spew to people lmao if it was that easy we would all be doing it and you for one wouldn't have to make you sells pitches but yet you do
If he’s so good at making you money why can’t he make the money for himself. Why does he need you? Con man bro!
Douche
Con man at it's finest
I’d just hang up, you know you’re being conned
“Get his credit card right away”
Lol his arguement goes the other way too. What a crock.
After that Yay or nay i would have hung up
The disrespect in this mans voice, don’t ever speak to someone like that.
What's so special about him? A literal con artist
Yep same BS f”VS. investing in friends  mom and pops shop this what we doing keep  t feeding  fake distractive capitalism!
He did not make him a million dollars.
If this isn’t who Matthew McConaughey based his Wolf of Wallstreet character on than he’s incorrect
Nope! I would have said the same thing to him. He's arguing over $100 too!
Dam illegal you done fucked up and made an earnings claim and now YouTube has this man's back if you fuck him around
I'm gonna make you a millionaire. Get his CC.
It’s funny y’all say he sounds like a car salesman because when I first started in sales management tried to use this morons videos to train us. However those of us that were not retarded hated him so much they stopped, this guy is a con man and is an awful salesman.
Cardone enterprises,  3 out if 5 stars on BBB, NOT BBB accredited. 18 complaints  in 3 years, 9 of them in the last 12 months. Hustler.
I would have hung up on this hustler within 10 seconds.
I'd be saying, "Well if $100 makes no difference, let's make it $1000. How's that sound?"
So fake. No one would ever ask for 100 off a 30k deal. Been in sakes 24 years
The price is the price. PERIOD. Do you go into the Apple store and ask for 100$ off for whatever random reason? If you can’t pay the quoted price that means you either can’t afford it or don’t believe the product is worth it. But it IS worth it if it was $29,900?   Prospects come up with the pettiest of reasons to not make a decision, the customer could have said no if the $100 was significant to him but it wasn’t.
Goes both ways.
I.wpuld.have said nope you're all good I will go and stand on my street corner now lmao
If the sale is on the line for 100 dollars I'd personally pay it and let them know I am. You know his commission is at least 10% with how hard he's pitching this shit
I dis agree with this 100 hundred dollars I only make 130pounds a week that's like half a weeks wages
Get his credit card 😂 scammers
Reminds me of the wolf of wall street
I figured it out, this gaslighting scammer allows all the negative comments on his own marketing, because in the approximate 1% of positive comments, he finds new gullible leads. That's the only plausible explanation for allowing your best marketing material to get, deservedly so, roasted out in the open like this.
😮😮😮😮😴😴😴😴👿👿
Big scam energy coming from this video.
Guy: Ok i wont go with the deal.   Salesman: Uhhh, wait nevermind we can do that deal.  Me: fuckouttahere.
A salesman sells a bad investment to make money off the commission - The video.
This makes me not want to make a deal
Do you know who this is as if the guy forking over 30K hasn't heard that annoying voice before
I hate people who make a living off other people's misery or less fortunate
Scam artist at his finest
1st rule of being a grown up. Never let anyone rush you especially during a sale.
If someone spoke to me like that I’d have them sacked. Let’s see who’s begging on the corner now, eh? 😂
Lol everyone in the comments are funny , I would sell just like this …. Because at the end of the day no one cares about a tire kicker of a customer, I would rather have quality over quantity 🤷🏼‍♂️
How to scam someone of 30,000
*anxiously says* : GET HIS CREDIT CARD  Yeah bro you’re totally not being scammed 😂💀
The sound of a total douche bag.
and if you can't give a $100 discount on a $30,000 sale you can't afford it either
"And then they all pulled their wee wees out to show dominance."
Well this was staged, no man is going to tell me I need to be begging on a corner for whatever amount I feel needs to be adjusted before proceeding to spend $30k with you comfortably…foh 😒
This has to be fake, just to make himself look cool. Who the F would risk a 30k deal over $100?
This guy is a shill
Peace I’m out ✌️
Fake
You can tell straight away these guys are crooks
This guy sounds like his wife hates him...
"if you're worried over $100 you need to go to the street corner to beg" my first reaction would be "then you better start begging cause you just let a $30k deal go because of $100"
This dude loves the smell of his own farts.
Okay well if you’re so interested in my investment why does the 100 bucks even fucking matter buddy
How many tries did this take? So many cut outs.
I'd be mad at my $100 😡 discount not being approved. No time for games. That's my 100
craziest part about this is that 4 years worth of tuition at a public university is about 40k. so 30k over 3 years at cardone university or 40k over 4 years for a REAL education
All he needed to do was ask was "100 bucks or 30k what will it be?" Scam written all over... Any university that says u will make a million by paying them is lying. I'd Use that 30k to invest in a small business
How to Intimidate a student..... To close a sale. Pathetic.
Apparently you close the deal by belittling people and being a solid straight-up jerk.
If a hundred bucks ain't shit,than wtf are you arguing with me for?
100 dollars off of 30 grand? Ok
I feel bad for this guy he got conned put of 30k
I'm a millionaire and I'm gonna teach you to be a millionaire too.  Just buy this 30,000 dollar course.
Dude for sure just bought a 10K truck for 30
why does this seem fake ?
I can stand when they say that…. I take my business elsewhere.  If I’m spend 30k and you can’t come down 100 bucks.  Well!!! Bye
If someone talked to me like that on the phone I would’ve hung up and taken my business elsewhere man 😂
Wait to make yourself look like an ass
This poor guy on the phone is doing his best to get deals made for his start up and this douche salesman is manipulating him left and right
This dude got hustled
Douche
Some Indian scammer was talking to me the same way!
That's how you make a sales pitch and deliver.
Nay.
Um 30k for Cardone University? I think a real university would be a better use of money. What a con man.
Fucking stinks of pyramid schemes
Arrogance wouldn't work on me
He said yes just so he doesn’t have to listen to his voice
The lead this generation drank and ate when they were kids is starting to show.
He ain't wrong, begging at any corner at any city can net you $100 on a few hours.
Con much?
A bunch of tools
An hour later and the guy on the phone lost everything 😂
Bs dripping from his mouth 🤣
What kind of Fuckery
Peer pressured that man lol
Straight up some Wolf of Wallstreet type shit
So he didn’t lose $100….. without getting the discount, he lost $30,100.00  Wow! Mind blown
How to prey on the vulnerable 101.
Talk to me like that I'll buy elsewhere
Doesn’t that go both ways,? The guy we see on the phone could’ve lost it also over 100 bucks?
I've been selling in business to business sales for 10 years now. If I handled my self that way I wouldn't have made it a year. This guy is just a clown.
This man think $100 is nothing if this man came from the place i came from he would only dream about a millon dollars.
Ahhhh yesss the classic ‘you’re worthless to me and I have more money than you’ tactic
Completely staged.
Jordan Belfort destroyed this man in my eyes.
I did this on a truck that msrp at 47k I bought. Negotiated down to the last 100 and if I didn’t get it I was going to walk away lol. Nothing wrong with negotiating, some are just better than others.
I'm about to be a sales engineer and I would be appalled if any one of my colleagues talked to someone like this.
God i hate salesmen. If $100 worries you, you need to find a street corner to go beg on?
Don't close deals over the phone ladies and gentlemen, you will be conned
Lol, people fall fir this scam
Went to one of his training seminars.  It was the biggest joke.  The whole seminar was just him selling his book set.  Bought one of his books out of curiousity even after I realized how terrible the seminar was.  The book was worse.  Lean on the pen brother…. Do you have to ask your mom for permission… these kind of lines are not for closers.  That was back in 2008.  The guy is Still a joke to this day.
Aye let's pay this turd 30k to show us how to do the lemonade ! Hell yeah. Let's do it
This is a horrible human being who is obsessed with making money no matter who he screws over
Cardone University?? Wtf??? This looking like Trump University and all those scamming ass get rich programs.. feeding into people hopes and praying on them.. look how quickly he said get his credit card number and get that 30k before he realizes what he's done.
The modern day wolf of wall street
30K for a “course” to become a millionaire?!?! Ooookaaaay... or you could go to fucking business school and get like 2 years of courses. Lol. So fucking stupid. What a grift.
Lol horrible guy, wouldnt offer a penny to him
How to scam young kids.
Dang if a sales person started talking like that to me I would have walked right out
I’m so happy ☺️ I have been earning $18,000 returns from my $6,000 Investment every 13 days.
Aaaaaaaand your scammed.
What a douche nozzle
Scam af
Nay see ya
worst.
Another Wolf of Wall street 🙄
Good to see the old school ponzi scheme is alive and well.
Almost never pay out...Besides...real  estate will bomb when there aren't any residents....pennines on the dollar...
Someone let me know whats going on here.
Well, we know Nick is probably going to have a rough life.
It's 2021 sales tactics and pitches are becoming obsolete, it's all about the data and facts  not the way someone speaks.
My uncle is a realtor. This guy seems like a p.o.s running a "me getting paid getting lucky while talking like a big shot when I'm not one" vibes
I wouldn't do business with anyone who acted like it didn't matter the way this guy did. If you're trying to tell me $100 doesn't matter then you better be giving me a $100 discount. I've been to car dealerships that have basically tried this tactic during negotiations and I've walked out without buying because clearly they don't care or want to earn your services as a customer. To top it off I told other friends that were looking at vehicles to avoid that place so it cost them a lot more than me. Not to mention I went down the street and bought the same vehicle from a different dealer.
Customer should’ve said the same thing back!
If you really wanna earn big money, teach people how to earn big money
That's a pretty small phone for someone  who claims they can make me rich
When he said, "if your worried about 100 dollars instead of this 30 grande item" I felt that
I’d never work with Grant he is rude
This guy is a tool
This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen lol, people really buy this shit smh.
Grant Ponzi
So what in 5 to 10 years he’ll busted on pyramid scheme
What’s con artist
Bleed out on a bathroom floor.
Closed a 57k front end gross deal Saturday 🤮
Scammers
“He’s so rude” yeah well he also owns a multi million dollar company so to each their own. Have fun being broke while this guy is closing deals on the fly.
IF HE IS TELLING YOU HE WILL MAKE YOU INTO A MILLIONAIRE BUT HE IS WORKING FOR A ENTERPRISE AT A CUBICLE AND DOWSNT HAVE 800k IN HIS OWN ACCOUNT, “DONT TRUST’EM”
*Sleazy saleswomen. Selling this guy a "get rich class for 30k". Also this video is fake but either way, people that say they have the recipe for becoming a millionaire and they just want to help you because they are good people are just full of shit. Stay away*
"you know who this is?" Me:*ITS BRITNEY BITCH*
I used to love watching Grant but I'm not a huge fan of him anymore cause there are many other down to earth people just as successful as him but they don't push you to buy stuff like a $900 course or their most recent book of the month. Ben Mallah is a perfect example, he is straight to the point dosen't have online courses but he does have live Q&A's, Meet and greets, and he will even let you call him about your next business venture or property to help you out for a nominal price.🤷🏽‍♂️
Fakest call I’ve ever heard. No one is guaranteeing a million dollar return that’s being recorded. If it’s real this “salesman” really just did guarantee that return. Dumbass
This is clearly fake. PROOF - it's posted by Grant Cardone
This is the exact opposite of what to do lmao
I would have said no and hung up. Hate when sales people try to be like this.
Bully scammmer
Its a fake call.  Calm down.
This gots The Wolf on wallstreet writen all over it
How not to close a sale!  If $100 gets a $30k, and that’s all u have to do, you do it.  If it’s a standard product and changing the price messes up ur automated billing or something, you explain that to the client.  Don’t be an asshole!
I think it’s for a class????
There's a snake in the grass 🐍
Another slim ball guru 😅
So fake.  Dudes like this get slapped in real life.
If you think he's gonna make 30 k into a million.. I got Beach front property on Miami Beach.... for 10000 down and $500 a month. And not only that I can offer you 0% APR on your Visa or MasterCard, extend your car warranty that you don't have, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity includes forgiving your student loans
If the hundred bucks doesn't matter then why not give him the discount. This guy is a prick.
I would defininitely have said no.
Tool bag vibes
I would have hung up forsure
Wasn't this scene in Wolf of Wall Street?
Aaand it's gone
Just a great con man - snake oil seller his “University” is a joke and an insult to education
What was he selling
Alpha Male American cringe right there.
Con man hard at work
What a worthless bag of air.
If 100 dollars didn't matter one way or the other then why would he persist in getting him to spend the 100?
I rly don’t like salesmen they’re so slimey
Snake. Oil.
That dude got GOT
I want to watch this a few more times so I remember his name and if I ever meet him I can be like congrats you became internet famous but in a bad way I don’t trust you.
I’ll bet you a $100 he never saw that $1M
Imagine getting bullied like that
I thought he went bankrupt
Con school? 😂 guy on the other side of the call was a pussy, should have hung up
Ahhh nothing better then watching A professional mondern day swindler at its best. Craziest part is he so good he fools people into actually believing him and hell at times rooting for him lmaooo
You talk like that to me in a meeting and I'll walk away everytime and take all my money somewhere else you don't talk to business people like that ever were you be fired instantly there's a reason why he's not a hundred millionaire because he's probably pissed away every opportunity to impress big people
This guys thinks he's John Anthony or something
Honestly talking to a salesman like this just feels like they are just blatantly trying to screw you over.
This seems like the type of guy to end up in a coffeezilla video.
Hey, thats a lot of confidence, man. Con man Hey
Same tactic works the same in reverse
Modern day Jordan Belfort 🤦🏻‍♂️ your gonna go to jail for this one day who knows when tho
“If it’s that small of an issue why can’t you cover it?”
In collections they call this "second talk off" the customer presumably has a pretty good idea of what to expect from his current salesman/collector. That's when you pass the phone to a coworker to add "legitimacy"  IMHO being an above average debt collector  for some time (sorry) this guy took the opportunity to show off to staff with what seems to be a passive customer. Guys like "Grant Cardone" are a dime a dozen, the only thing they sell are empty promises.
This some scam shit fr fr
I think that for people who really are wise with money they know that ever dollar counts, no matter the peer pressure. If you can get 100$ off a deal then that money can be used somewhere else. Especially for a 30k dollar product, they will typically be willing to negotiate a price to be lowered, but I’m also young so I don’t know everything there is to know
This is literally a con job. If you can Google someone and “scam” is a suggested word then you probably shouldn’t pay them.
But if it's "just $100" then give him the deal Mr rich guy😂😂😂
He's been hustled real quick
We saw this trick in wolf of wall street 🤣😂😅
That’s a sure fire way for me to absolutely say no.
I can't imagine the douche-baggery that must go on on that office. These kinds of guys watch financial movies like the Wolf of Wallstreet and cheer on the main characters.
Charles Ponzi would be proud
They aren't going to make you a million dollars,  you will.
When he ask are you willing to lose this deal over 100 bucks, counter with the same question.
People are such pushovers. No pushback, no asking are you willing to lose 30k over 100 bucks? Plus, it's probably for his scam of a school. Wolf of what street?
Yeah I'd never do business with you if you'd talk to me like that I'd straight tell you to eat the curb. I'm spending 30k and this man comes at you for that
I mean if it’s $100 off of $30k to close the sale why would you not just take it, instead of losing to $30k.  Also, please don’t ever give concrete, absolute numbers when you’re talking about earnings like that, it’s a free lawsuit you’re guaranteed to win, without any effort.
He’s better than Dan Lock I’d give him that
Hilarious that this is on Cardones channel, and all the comments are about him scamming😅
S.C.A.M. anyone?
I was the guy on the phone
Thinking 100 dollars dont matter is how you lose being rich. Losing money no matter how small is actaully something to think about cuz 100 dollars there and 100 dollars there soon you will be broke begging for a 100.
Gross
Lesson #1: If you are paying someone 30k to get you 1 mil, you are being scammed.
Douche nozzle
That how you make the decision to say…. No
This guy watched wallstreet and thought he’s a big shot
Get his credit card right now 😅
Sooooooo fake.  Total douche
What a disrespectful ass hat
What a con man
Scammed out of money
Fake person was calling
Always remember; anyone can buy followers. Dignity is invaluable.
Someone’s been taking Jordan Belfort’s “straight line persuasion” classes.
People are so stupid
How to spot a con-artist 101: they promise to make you money, they speak fast in hopes of confusing you with bullshit words that don't actually make sense all the time.
Can’t meet me for a $100 and willing to lose thousands? Lol I would go elsewhere
I thought he was gonna say, "My name is Jordan Belfort. I am the Senior Vice President of Stratton Oakmont, and I want to talk to you about an amazing investment opportunity."
Stupid sales person. Eat the 100 close the deal.
Guy seems really shady
This is scary predatory buissiness tactics...he's not teaching he's scamming.
This really just sounds like he watched the Wolf of Wallstreet too many times
Dude seems shady asf
Aleast he's not in college losing $40K per year with no return...😂😅
Ponzi is that you scheming
What a mug
Nay. All day.
The second you start talking to me like that I'm going to hang up. Con man if I've ever seen one.
He looks like Bruce Wayne
How NOT to close a sale. I have done sales for a long time.  I am not the least bit impressed.   Real sales skills have you selling more complex product to highly intelligent people, typically business owners/CEOs.   Not a get rich quick scheme to scam people into spending their life savings or going into debt... Thats just playing the numbers game and seeing who will bite, anyone can do it.
Here is why this is a bad idea for the sellers - you are starting off a business relationship handing your new client a loss before they even receive the item.  Does not bode well for doing future business with them.
Perfectly done.
As if this is behaviour to be proud of splitting people with their money via persuasion 👏 well done you are so sophisticated
Give him a little. Show him that you value his business. 100 ain't nothing to either party
Typical.. 99% of the rich won't part with a single dollar. Tight ass
I got Fish
If $100 didnt matter like this dude said then why not take off an extra 100 dollars
Typical greasy salesman, nothing new or special happening here
Was this suppose to intimidate me into thinking what a  cool ass salesman this guy is.. well I didn't even make a deal here.. but I want my money back 🙄 not impressed
All he wants  is ur 30gs lol he pressured the guy to say lets do it
"If your so poor your worried about $100 you should sell your body on a street corner. Shit how did Grant say it?"
Guy just got jacked for 30 grand.
"imma steal all yo money with cardone enterprises"
LOL what's funny is that his course teaches you to always be respectful but he plays cool on videos
That's no way to treat a customer. I would have politely said "no thank you" and hung up the phone the moment he started talking to me like that. I'm not going to let someone disrespect me and then give them my money. There's no difference between him and a telemarketer or a car salesman.
I’d hang up so fast
What happens when you do 5 😳
It takes a realllly special type of person to be in the high pressure sales business.
You can have everlasting life and be saved and forgiven all your sins if you believe in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour 😊💕💖❤️ Jesus died for our sins got buried and rose from the dead ❤️ read Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 they are prophecy’s about Jesus written long before the crucifixion and can be found in the Old Testament or on google ❤️😊 also look up the prophecy of tyre  and what happened ( really do if you don’t believe in the real God ) repent toward God and believe in Jesus Christ if you have not and if you do not ❤️💕 do you know where you will go when you die? ❤️❤️ when it comes to truth don’t trust the lies from the ones called roman catholic’s or orthodox and I mean no offence ❤️ but they are not biblical in many things and I’m not saying they lie about everything but it’s just better to read the Bible for yourself then listen to a roman catholic or orthodox priest I believe ❤️  and I have lived in and one side of my family is from a orthodox country so I write from experience ❤️ My tip is to start with the New Testament ❤️💕 God bless you and your family 💕❤️ and if you are Muslim read surah 18:86 without the editing from the commentator ❤❤
That guy Todd used to sell Cutco. Great guy
“Get his credit card right now” sums up how scammers like this operate. He is swindling financially uneducated people into thinking he can actually make them money. He is a con man for sure
Imma make you a million dollar!. Literally seconds ago you said we dont have $100 lol
If $100 is nothing then give it to me and lets do this if not i will get it done myself with someone else if necessary
See how easy it is to take money from people when u promise more back even tho we all know
Sheep being fleeced 😞
It's on speaker phone mode.. You don't have to scream into the phone lol
I wouldn't care if it was 20 cents, if the salesman talked to me like this...I'm out.
And that was a earnings claim. Illegal AF. This pos needs to be shut down and sued
Didn't Meet Kevin expose grant cardone for some scam?
*How to hustle money from a client by comparing them to homeless people*
this isnt real guys.
"This is $100 is the difference you need to go back on the street corner"  Except on the one that hundred dollars sounds like that's what you're doing to me right now.
This dude literally got scammed out of 30k his university is fake as fuck
They really thought this was a good thing to put on the internet? I can smell the scamminess through my phone.
Grant cardone put his works in, not smarts in, imo. He probably had to do 50x more of these calls with that type of demeanor.
this guy is downright disrespectful telling his customer to beg on a street corner
That poor guy just wasted 30 grand
your a goof obv just a con man always a big shot using other people's money funny he talks about making buddy a million yet he still works lol so obv his own advice didnt work for him hes still working lol all lies nothing but smoke in the air and yet alll you beleive hahahaha
What is this some kind of pyramid scheme?
100$ are 100$
He just sound like a duchebag, but I’m sure he thinks otherwise.
Guy thinks he’s a business wizard, he’s just that nob head that everyone sees on the golf course on his phone 🙄
Should've said nay.
This guy is such a sleazy snake oil salesman. Can’t believe people still falling for his act 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️
Almost picture perfect to the conning lessons scene from The Wolf Of Wallstreet
If $100 doesn’t make a difference why didn’t he just take $100 off?
Hey $100 is $100 🙄
Yay or nay!! If someone demanded this over the f****** phone to me? I'll be like "b****, I'm the mofo in charge, let me decide and I'll call back" You know how millionaires stay rich? They live like poor people and how poor people stay poor? They try and live like rich people. It's a goddamm fact
The used car salesman of the finance world..
if $100 doesn’t mean anything, why is he so adamant about getting it?
"If you care that much about $100 you need to find a street corner to beg on" Aren't you also caring about $100 but in a different direction. That type of logic always goes both ways.
Congrats u just got scammed
Lmao anyone else here work in sales? Like wtf is this boiler room nonsense?
Here is the course tell people you're a millionaire then make a class telling people general money tips then scam the shit out of anyone who falls for it
You can see it in his face that's going right in his bank account
" Now invest 100k for the 1 million that i promised you"  🥸" totally real why would I lie over the phone?"
Don't know much about arseholes, but I know one when I see one.
See if that was me and someone was saying 100 don't make a difference either way I'd say "well give the three 100 off then, what you taking about,  you want I close it take the 100 off" some ppl can just get bullied by a confident sounding person. And yes 100 don't mean anything on 30k but at least you could have made him think he'd won,  way better tactic imo.
"Get his credit card right now." This guy is full of shit.
Neigh like a racehorse bro get me tf out of there
You talk to me like this on the phone and I'm being polite trying to make a deal, you just lost business
This guys just a thug in a tie. I would've told him bye like 10 minutes ago.
Dumbest way to talk to a client. Doesn't matter how much money you have, I am the client then i demand respect if not given then i will go to a place that will.
This is the exact scene from wolf of wallstreet
Duh...SIGN  Dude gave you an earnings claim and recorded it himself....
People who don’t see through that kind of talk, deserve what they get.
This isn’t real life. This is a video meant to trigger us for views and comments and we all fell for it.
The fact that this behavior is excepted is honestly very sad. You're better off supporting your private seller than deal with these spineless sharks!
I’d be like good point take 3k off then I might be interested
Whos grand carton?
Scamdone Scamiversity
Got conned
This is clearly a 1 song and dance sale, zero integrity, willing to scare tact somone into the illusionary missed opportunity. Win them over as an individual and the sale comes naturally through trust. Although when your selling shit you need to bait them by any means necessary, and thats where and when the "salesmen" losses touch with the end game and long term.
Well atleast his scam went well
My wife commenting on the large bill at the restaurant...nooooo.  Don't do that or I'm wearing Crocks for our next outing.
call is scripted. heard the same shit when kirby vacuums tried to hire me lol
The word salad 🥗 chef at it again.
And that is how you scam people. "You have his credit card right" 😂
How are you gonna make a million bucks?
I would hang up the phone immediately
John 3:16
So presumably the chuckle fuck that handed him the phone took the course right? So I guess he's a pretty shit teacher since that guy couldn't close the deal.
This fella got skills being a POS
What a toolbag.
In real life the client would've hung up
You know who this is?  Nick: Mathew Mcconaughey?
I just want to say, every rich person I know dropped out of school, and none of them ever did any stupid class on how to be rich.(they might have sold the tho, lmfaooo) but really this is some serious bullshit
I hear a lot of dumb offers like this selling stuff on Facebook marketplace. People offering 10$ under the asking price for a 500$ item
Ew.
Hang on, wtf is he charging 30k for ? To be featured in a crappy YouTube video ?
⬅️"get his credit card right now" lmao.  Caller should have used the :"yes, no, I don't know" prank call..look it up⚰️
This guy is the embodiment of the sleazy sales guy
Someone just got fucked by Grant
ACN personified
I’d hang up if someone started talking to me like that
Nothing slick about this. Its sleazy
this is not how you make a sale 😂
If you think a $30,000 course is gonna make you rich, then you have more money than intelligence.
How to scam people in minutes
Me trying this and sending a poor soul down a bad and dangerous career path
Just got slick talked out of 30k! GET HIS CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW!!!
Sleaze ball. Whenever someone is trying to get you to make a decision quickly in a business deal. Walk away
Every time a business brings in their "closer" I get up and leave. They annoy the hell out of me.
Good old wall street wanna bes
Definition of snake oil sleazy salesmen
I would have hung up the phone
How about making HIMSELF a million dollars cuz I'm pretty sure the 1st sign of a millionaire is a million dollar smile...his is about 60 bux
$30k? That is about 0.98 BTC. (At time of comment) F*ck this trash heap. Invest in yourself not him.
rip nicks $30k
It's so sad, that Grant Cardone is literally facing major aligations for never paying out on investments. XD that 30k is gone and that's sales tactic only works with type B personalities.   Further more he promises 15% annual returns, does anyone see how fking ridiculous that is? It's literally impossible. Statically, mathematically, probability, its just not gonna happen.
Go promote more Ponzi schemes
Yes
Imagine this was real lol
So did Nick become a millionaire?
Isn't this the same exact course he sells for a couple hundred dollars that he admitted is the same as his  30k course
Better buy Cardano 🤣
One of my Idol's
Please play in traffic my man
Paul rudds evil twin
Tell tod that he was too weak to turn you down. Lol
Advice: do not do what this man is doing! simple
Kirby vacuum sales reps be like:
If 100 dollars is nothing. Just give it to him and move on. Sleazy salesman.
I saw a similar strategy in wolf of Wall Street, I think we know how that turned out.
Of he had said no, they would have called back in 5 minutes taking the 100 off. Dont ever give in to salespeople. Ad always wait until the end of the month, find the guy closest to their bonus mark and they will make the deal.
Hey, wait a minute! That’s ILLEGAL
Hey Nick let's make me a million dollars ok. It's doesn't matter who this is.
Lmao what a scam
Makes $m's but his kids hate him & his wife f***s the pool guy
I’d hang up if someone wanted 30k to go to school for a fake degree lmfao
This is exactly how conmen work.  They try making u feel like ur just not good enough to do anything worthwhile
You talk to me like that I ain't faking with your company again
30k over 3 years is 833 bucks a month. 100 dollars off is essentially 12% off the first payment. If that goof was talking to me like that. All I would say is, you clearly dont respect me or my money. If 100 dollars is beggars chump change, then why you fighting me? If he gives more guff, cancel the deal.
Him: Hey his credit card right now Me: *click*  30 secs later: ring ring Me: Hello  Him: lost you there buddy let’s do business  Me: sorry if my credit card is that important maybe I’m not the customer for you *click*
This dude is a clown
Why you gotta exaggerate your claims man. Earn someone a million? Yeah, no.
I'd have told him to shove it. And say if a massive firm cant make a $100 concession, then I have serious doubts that they can make me any money
I sold a 60,000 dollar impeller the other day guy wanted 250 off i said naw he said k gimmie still
You tell your customer why he need this. Not humiliating them for not buying your shit
I’m going to start using that!… Can I get it? Yes or no? Yes or no?
Can you tell me on what  I  can beg for money?
And I would have said to him "are you really ready to lose 30k over 100 bucks?".
A masterclass in how to steal from people
Is this how professional salesmen should be ?  Now, I know why my shit still together. I have been rejecting them all my life.
Feel like he watched The Wolf of Wall Street the night before.
I would just flip everything on that dude like when he said oh if the 100 bucks is what makes the yay or any or whatever and you'll need to go to a street corner to beg on I'd be like your exactly right so then those 100 bucks wouldn't be nothing for you either right so drop the 100 bucks
I would of asked for more money off
No, bye
Either way the deal is fucked lmao. The guy is so unsure of his 30k investment that he’s worrying about a $100 discount. Then this knockoff Dan Bilzerian hops on the phone jajajajajajajajajajajaja
“Get his credit card, right now.”
Grifter
After the "Hey Niki" I would have hung up
Wow yall are heated.
I don't even know what the hell is going on, but I know I'd immediately laugh and then hang up. 😂
Grant is a liar and a cheat, worst fake guru online. Wouldn’t give him a penny.
🙈
Wolf of wall street
Wanna know how to make money? Give me thirty grand over the next 3 years, I’ll make you a millionaire.
If someone selling a service to me started talking to me like that I'd flat out hang up. Don't do business with slimeballs
Straight up bullshit lol
Scam!!
“If a $100 is the decision maker don’t do it . Coz if you’re looking for $100 you need to find a street corner to beg on “ who the fuck talks like this.
Bullied him out of 30 bands
Goes.both ways..you worrying about the 100 too if you dont just give it to him
This feels like its ripped straight from wolf of wallstreet. Probably pounds his chest while ohming during brunch
Just say no
Fake as fuh
The guy on the other end of that phone shiuld come out and say how much did he actually make
It's not surprising Cardone and conman start with the same letter.
So if a hundred dollars is insignificant to this loud mouth why is he pushing for it from the customer?
Take the fucking $100 off, jeeesus.
What the fuck did I watch to get this on my recommendations?
Disgusting. I would’ve said as the customer “if you’re worried about a hundred dollars, maybe you’re not the business I thought you were. I think I’ll take my business elsewhere” then hang up the phone. High pressure sales people are the scum of the earth.
Tf u talking about be begging bruh 100 a lot for the people on the streets
Anyone could close a deal with a staged phone call.... 😂😂
Very cocky with a tactic that doesn’t work.
While he is right that the difference in 100 dollars for a 30k deal is semi ridiculous he talks like an asshole like most salesmen do
So insulting someone over $100 dollars is how you sell? Personally I’d have said if a 100 is gonna make or break this sale for you(the salesman) I’ll bring my business elsewhere.
Oh so your a scam artist nice nice
The biggest grifter online is taking peoples life savings for "CLASSES"?
Grant is rly insecure, his ego is built around money.  Watch his interview with Jordan Belford and you will know what I mean.
Idk what everyone is talking about I took grant cardone’s university class and now I have a hundred billion trillion times infinity dollars
It's a no from me dog
Reminds me wolf of wallstreet though
All the information in this course can be consumed on podcasts and YouTube videos. But my advice is that these type of courses give you analysis paralysis. Just get moving. You learn much more from your mistakes than you will ever learn from some financial guru’s motivational advice.
If this guy calls me...  I'd hung up immediately.
This is where matthew macanahay gets his Ora from
Kind of staged.. who negotiates like this?
Do you know who this is is Yes it no yes or no  Wow is this MBA 101?
How to bully a customer. $100 is petty, either way guys.
What people don’t realize is that this guy just got done watching Wolf of Wall Street.
Such a clown
Scammin
Imagine thinking this is an actual skill
My answer, no
Strange flex and how do you know that was a real cliënt? Phone calls are so easy to stage.
Gross
GET HIS CREDIT CARD NOW (Before he changes his mind)
He is right, he should of asked for $3k off the price. $100 off is nothing to negotiate about.
Cardone is a beast. Take notes and stop bitching
Such a deuce bag. Please move out of aventura.
How to screw people 101.
Some people just have the need to feel like they came out on top and if it's a $30,000 deal and that hundred bucks was simply to satisfy his ego, then peel off $100 bill and give it to the f****** idiot.
It’s a bully sale. Works great on unconfident people but it’s a garbage tactic.
If you only tried speaking to someone like that in the UK 😂
I would have walked. These are games these people play.  I told you what I’m willing to pay, Yes or No? Let me sign or walk.
I mean wouldn’t you make them comfortable with you and just offer more things since you’ve given a sense of safety me being friendly enough to give you things that you ask for would now make you return a bit more friendly just depending on the person
This is like somebody thinking they’re good with women because they’re a serial rapist
I'm going to make you a million dollars my man but don't you worry if I look like I live in my office lol
Someone just got scammed
And then he got screwed... And lost 100$...
Anyone who can truly generate millions for themselves in a business doesn’t need to charge 30k for a course. I’m not saying it should be free, but if you don’t need the money you wouldn’t charge so much. 5k at the most and even then that’s crazy. 30k? You are not trying to help people you are trying to scam them and make money.
this is gibberish lmao he's literally the dad of that 10 yr old speaker who "can't wait to have a job"
People like this you shouldn't listen to what they say. Listen to how they say it and you'll get much more info on skills they use to sell.
Lol he said I’m gonna make you a million dollars; he meant to say : you are gonna make ME a million dollars.  …get his credit card information (famous last words)
"you see me husseling for the pennies and dimes" said this poopoo head before now this
We just witnessed someone getting scammed out of $30k
Button up your shirt pleb
That's how a scammer works
Everyone is hating on Grant, but I’d be cautious of a customer like that. Someone like that who tries to get such a tiny discount is going to be the same person who calls up every month trying to get out of their payment, and end up costing the company a lot of money.
So im giving you 30k and I ask for a tiny fraction to be taken off and you compare me to a homeless person.............you my friend have just made a sell...........what in the actual fuck
Slime
Fake
Warning scam alert!!!
Fake af
Wow not scripted at all
This will ever fly where I am, he insulted the customer, and that would be the end of it.
To the people who are saying they shouldn't talk to a customer that way, you didn't hear all of the dialog or possible weeks or months of follow up. The guy on the other line was playing along trying to beat a closer. It was sport... closer vs closer.
Does it make you feel warm and special you risked 30k sale for hundred bucks. Douche
Jordan Peterson?
How to deal with Sales people: Hang up
This guy is a swindler.
Thirty grand.....for a course on how to become a millionaire?
Ahh, the sifu for life at it again. Scamming people with his fake, useless course.
These are the type of people that rot in the depths of hell
Is this the same guy who said: money by itself is garbage??
I would simply hang up
Too bad cardone can't tell the SEC nay when they come a knocking
It’s funny that grant is a con man, preys on the financially uneducated, manages to talk to customers this way and thinks it’s cool to brag about it. I guarantee this customer has never seen profits from his  initial investment.
Looks like a scammer bro i bet this dude is a scammer
The salesman can’t risk the sale over a $100. The owner is rich and doesn’t care. You can’t negotiate if you can’t walk away from a deal
Dude just lost 30k
Dude he made it obvious he was broke and just wanted to buy sumthin nice for someone it’s a hundered dollars shill out
This is how you know a real scammer.. get his credit card right now.. he knows he has no product worth selling, just the hype of "teaching" you to be a millionaire
Nice phone lol. Who needs to find a street corner to beg on....?
A whole scam right before your very eyes
Wait.....they're haggling over a school/course tuition??? Ummm yeah shady business right there
oh God, Cardone University..? this is how weak minded people get sucked into cults and financial schemes.
Shoulda said No
I mean you’re not entitled to your customers money, I’d hang up and look elsewhere
Why do they make these videos. It's embarrassing
If this is virtue we are all fucked
He wants your business i would walk over $100 and go somewhere else. It’s the principle and how much u can trust these ppl saying how much. Obey they will make u. ✌️
Grant Cardone can go Forget himself.
Im thinking that wasnt a real customer.  Idk if id believe a person who tells me something like that, has my best interest in mind.  Then again he did come off like a boss so it could go either way.
If 100 isn’t a big deal then just give him the discount lol
Pyramid schemes at its finest
I would've told that guy not no but fuck more you can tell he's all about the commission
Step one to make a million dollars:  Don't pay 30 grand for a course that doesn't lead to shit.  At least colleges give a you a degree with your debt
This guy jumps on the phone to pressure me into spending more I would rather hang up and take my business elsewhere.
The moment this clown says yay or nay ? say 100 off yay or nay if nay I hang up.  Other people willing to take my 30k
He fr need $100 to upgrade from an iPhone 4
Cardone is such a clown, this is embarrassing, he just talks in circles, guy knows jack sh*t.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like it because it works both ways but someone got out sold and bargain. Once they have the power you lost. Now to get that hundred after you drop the price they feel powerful you lost nothing. Depends how you do it. Read laws of power for better understanding
Don't let your buisness partners talk to you like that. That was ridiculous
For people who don't know. No real investor, manager whatever will be this aggressivly after your money if you're talking about 30k
Scam artist
As a customer service rep, This has to be the worst possible response
Imagine spending 30k and caring about 100 bucks….stupid
I’d have hung up
Report this shit
Ah yes a wolf of Wallstreet style salesman
Coffeezilla has some good videos on this…person. Don’t get scammed guys. Which is what Grant Cardone does.
man watched wolf of wallstreet once 💀😂
I mean your also letting 100 dollars get in your way it's not even a 1% discount  And your also a slimy con man and slipped up with the "get his credit card info right now" What kinds of legit buisness charges 300k to a man's credit card
I look up to grant Cardone not because he's a good salesmen and knows how to get business deals done. But because he still made a billion? dollars scamming the fuck outta people 😂 just  be honest with yourselves people 🤣
Conman
"Get his credit card, right now"
Biggest scam artist
This was obviously fake lol
“Do you know who this is?  It don’t matter who this is!”  Well, thank god we cleared that up.  *CLICK*
So gross
Sounds like he himself is worried about the 100 dollars lol
I’d have turned the tables and said wel grant who’s the one begging? I got the money you ok over there?
Nothing but a Used car salesman selling you some piece of shit 2003 civic for 10,000. all these people are the same hedge funds, lawyers, politicians they are just some sketchy sales man that you know deep down you’re getting fucked
I run 🏃‍♀️ when I hear salesmen like this
I would’ve hung up.
£100 to join a pyramid scheme
This the next wolf of Wall Street in the making !!! 🙄
👎
Wow. I was gonna say, $100 dollars isn’t much when talking about $30,000 but this guy was an asshole about it
He just stole his money and the man on the phone wont make a dime
One hundred percent fake and set up, you hear him say you should go beg on a street corner. The guy on the phone fuckin agrees
Imma start asking for a 100 dollar discount when buying a car. If they don't give it I presume you are greedy
No one ever sold talking to customers like this. Best believe it guys. Imagine paying someone after they disrespected you.
What a douche
get scammeddd ... haha dude cudvt just put that in. some leaps and be fukn balling but instead gave it to a fuk degenerate .... fuk u and congrats
What scam is this?
No way this real .. in real life it wouldn’t had played out like that common now
I don’t know what’s going on here…but if I was dude on the other end of they phone…I would’ve banged on home boy as soon he started talking all that slick shit.
The 100$ is a test. The fact that he insults the guy by calling him poor over 100$ means he’s not the one to do business with long term.
"yeah let's do it" "This is grant cardone and you've just been scammed"
will a customer really do the deal after being humiliated
Is this supposed to make you look good?
Wolf of wallstreet???
Get his credit card right now
I'd say no to this shifty sounding fuck.
What an asshole. A lot of dealerships I’ve been to know looking at civics are very open to offers and deals, this guy just shows his true colours acting too entitled to his money.
Many of the comments don’t under the context of this situation and don’t know much about the world of sales.
What is he even selling?
Scammers
That is how you scam someone out their money
The irony.....
Fuckkkkkkkkkkk that!!!
What was the sale?
Feels like Wolf of Wallstreets
It does not matter who is at the phone oh yea until there is a Scammers on the phone
Who still watches this clown? Didn’t Jordan Belfort straight expose him
"Get his card now" yeah before he realizes that paying $30,000.00 to become a millionaire is a scam
Great video!! Now I know who to avoid.
99% of the time people will walk from someone like this. He sounds like he is in your pockets already. Ive been in sales all my life and this guy would be at the bottom of the order if he sold like that
Oh yeah,  they can pay for the big office space,  all there employees high salaries, Grant's expensive life style.....etc...yet still turn your 30k into millions.....lmao!!  Invest in YOURSELF! Get educated on what u wanna do so you can pay YOURSELF all those high salaries, have a huge office, expensive life style, and still make millions!!!
If a person ever talks to you like this, you are being conned.
Same thing to the sales man. Are you going to turn down an offer for $100 bucks?
#ad
Wolf on wall street vibes
You’d be getting fuck all from me, crook
Just another scam artist with a youtube channel
Not saying it's necessarily cool to talk to ppl like that but he's the billionaire so keep your critiques to yourself until your portfolio is half his. Either way deal closed.
That's why I buy my stuff online.
Entrepreneur in his bio for sure
Did not know he was featured in a Carvana ad
This guy ripping people off lol?
In soviet sales we believe people trying to save money is do not value the sale, they are the privileged class and we must berate 💪🏾😂
Get his credit card right now.why? Cause he knows. He's not going in.
What a douche.
Wolf street boys
Every dollar counts 😂 I bet your boy grant saves every dollar he can
If he's selling a course he's already a piece of shot imo
Give him the $100.  Its nothing
sleez
Honestly I see all these comments about everyone calling him out for ripping into the customer. But honestly if you were paying attention to what the customer said before he takes over, he basically tries to sway the sales man by saying "100 bucks, that's how close we are". You are all overlooking the fact that what grant did wasn't actually rude, he was just changing the power dynamic. The customer had all the power and grant flipped it on its head therefore landing him the sale. I think it's alot deeper than you all seem to think :D
Ya'll acting like he insulted the guy with the go beg line. If anything, that was some decent advice. He basicallu said "if you're this worried about $100 while you're about to spend 30k, then you shouldn't be spending that 30k." That's true. If you need the 100 bucks that bad, then don't spend 30k. Use the money where you most need it.  Correct me if I'm wrong, cuz I only watched this once and may have misunderstood some parts.
Never trust a man who claims he can sell you financial freedom. 😂
Cardone university, where money is burned.
Let's hope he delivers on his promises. Doesn't seem like the right approach to business speaking to your customers like this imo
I can’t tell if this is a joke or not
At that point it’s either lose a hundred dollars or lose thirty thousand dollars. If they talked to me like that the call would’ve ended.
Snake
Cringe.. i see no humans just demons
Nice close. Too bad you're a conman
Dude is selling get rich prosperity seminars…
The majority is stating that a discount should of been given. But if the salesman believes so heavily and knows the "value" of his product/brand, and guarantees a ROI 3x if not 10x,  why would 🤔they  bring the price down for you, especially when there's a proven track record..
This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen, who in there right mind would give 30000$ to this lunatic, if I was thinking about spending that kind of money in one go I’d want to be dealing with professionals in person over many weeks. Not on a 30 second phone call cos some guy said told me to go beg on a street corner🤣
What a complete tool this guy is. No self awareness
That’s fucked he has all the money in the world why does it matter if wants that 100 🤡
Bro your 10x bankrupt
Super Douche
Pyramid scheme? $30k 😂
Guy is on record saying he sexually harassed his wife until she would not take no for an answer. Where is the cancel culture on this guy?
Grant Cardone is a douche. I have seen the Cardone university program. There is literally intros of him walking on the beach in the 90’s. Tells you how to eat salad. What a waste of money.
Car salesman has more class
Lmao this is the fakest shit this happens in absolutely zero client interactions anywhere
This is fake
You can tell this is fake/scripted because nobody would respond to "you need to find a street corner to beg on" by saying "yeah youre right"
Idc who you are…you talk to me like that I  talk shit to existence
Why are Grant Cardone's customer earnings so far below what they claim to offer?  Junk.
What a clown
We are talking about .003 hundredths of the full rice. Who the fuck cares either way.
Isn’t this the exact scene from Wolf of Wall Street
I’m no lawyer but I’m pretty damn sure he just made an earnings claim. I’d be talking to my lawyers the second I hang up the phone
I'd straight hang up without saying a word. They'd call me back asking why and I'd tell them why. Then tell them I'm not going to be talked down. They'll offer more than a 100dollar discount for sure
Nay… on principle alone!
So he makes fun of the guy for worrying about 100 dollars but is so confident that the guy will be making millions but he grant himself won't give up 100 dollars and is willing to walk away from a 30k deal for it? Smells legit.
I’d just hung up 😂 man talking way to much .. seemed so desperate. Terrible.
Con Artist ☝🏻
This is the most Clear Scam artist on the Website. Yikes.
get his credit card right now
this guy is the worst salesman there is.
Cardone University? Is this a franchise of Tr*mp University?
So if you steal 100 dollars twenty times a day you make 2000.
Hey everyone, I close 10M dollars of sales collectively over the phone on a yearly basis, this would come off as rude and agressive to alot of people, instead the key is actually to be clear and honest and use your charm and calmness to close deals or make sales.
What’s the name of the company this guy works for so I don’t actually do business with them. That was just obnoxious.
Let's go
Cardone be wild N sometimes
So you manipulated a man by humiliating him over a $100 discount
What a twat. Someone talked to me like this they'd lose the sale just so I never had to hear from them again
He is rude but closed him$ it's  like picking up chicks.Close close & close
RIP to the guy that just got scammed out of 30k to learn about some nonsense he could probably get from a quality online source for free.. or from an in person source for 10x less.
Dude is scamming people. He is the only one making millions. No shady ass university course will make you a millionaire. This course is a liability not an asset. Get assets that how you build wealth.
With those sales guy you just have to show that basically you do not give a damn and will go somewhere else . So best thing to do is to play the idiot and say that then you need to think ...they hate that because they only want to close the deal ASAP and show the revenue and they know that if they do not do it now then the guy might think again and will never do it because he will be distracted by other things.
It's all types of properties here for cheap
I would hang up with that type of sales pitch.
white man thinks he’s cool
What does he even sell…
What is this garbage and why is it in my feed
God i hate sales people like this
Ladies and gentlemen: The Devil.
📢 Conman alert.
This guy’s such a scammer
Is this real? They wouldn't give him $100 off 30k and the guy still said yes 😩
What a load of bollocks
deal breaker instead of deal closer. wouldn't work with me with that speech and tone.
Car salesmen hate me.   Was in negotiations over a vehicle for 6 months. I wouldn't budge.   They did though so 🤷‍♂️
Sucker, stick to your guns never back down.
Wow such a strong American accent.
Wanna be wolf of wall street, Jesus.
A $100 is just nickel and dimming in a 30k deal. If you're worried about a $100 you really shouldn't be investing 30k
No f*** that. I need that $100.
What is this transaction for? What are they selling/buying
obviously staged, you do that to any real customer they’re not going to deal with u
Cardone coaches the Nigerian scammers, "now get his credit card"
People are still giving this man money?
None of these people here have job, thats where you get the hate
He sounds like DiCaprio in Wolf of Wallstreet as he sells the Pennystocks 🤣
I wouldve said "no, ahole".
Fraud
I knew this guy was a complete idiot when he told some literal 20 year old that he was broke when he had 60 grand saved up. Idk about yall but you ain't broke at 20 with 60 grand.
This is staged
This pos. Why would anyone pay him .50 cents
Repulsive bottom of the barrel car salesman.
men like this are a nightmare for women lmao
He knew he could get away with being blunt because if you’re asking for a hundred dollars off you already want to buy it and for those who don’t know feelings shouldn’t be involved when it comes to making money business is business
Stay away from people this good at getting your money...
Guye, guys, getchyer panties out of a bunch. It's OKAY for him to talk like that to him, because it's GRANT.
Get his credit card right now…
Scammed a dude
I wouldn't buy bread of this guy if I was starving. Attitude stinks and seems like one of those guys that gets rich off other people paying him because he told them he's going to make them rich.
This guy watched wolf of Wall Street and got inspired
This clown has the devils blood good thing guys like this exist and have always existed so the world can stay un pure. The businessman was the first demon it’s crazy I know this and I don’t even believe in the religious mumbo-jumbo
Wtf is this?
How come a people who look and sounds like exactly the person i would never do business with are doing business...?
Assuming he doesn't get a milli
Nah, that's a hang up for me, you're not guna talk to me like that you little shit.
Pretty gross.
You guys in the comments are pussies.  If you actually worked in sales and knew anything you'd know this is how us closers close.  It's not for the weak so pack it up and work a 9-5.
I've taken a class in sales skills and this is what they tell you not to do lmao
Yeah... Ok
Why would someone post this? Offered zero value for his customer
My hell I'm sure this was a little click bait b.s clip.
He's like the dollar store brand wolf on wall street
Do what? And sell what? Who makes what? Do they speak English on What?
I would've said no then hung up.  Way to cost yourself a sale over $100
A warning to any young guys thinking about taking this guy's course. I'll teach you something myself. Lesson one. This guy is a con artist, watch him, understand him. You will meet many of them on the journey of life. Don't give them a cent
This is how i turn you 30k plus 100 other people but a property fix it flip it pay you 10% and I walk away with 1 million plus and do it ten more times.
When you finish watching Wolf of Wall Street and think you could be a good salesman   Ps this is fake
If anyone's wondering, this is fake and he's a scammer
It wasn’t about 100$ it’s about how good are you really going to treat oblivious like sh!t , I’ll take my money elsewhere you POS
Jesus Christ I would have giving him the $100 bucks and make him feel like he won. In reality $30,000 for a " class" to become rich is a scam. But hey, nobody's paying me that kind of money to bullshit them.
Prob the kids last 100 haha
100 dollars is the difference between me paying my credit card bill paying for collage and eating tonight give me my dame 100!
He is a 🤡, watch his interview with The Wolf
Lmao this would have the reverse effect on me 😂😂 I'd just go and take my business elsewhere homie, let someone else have my $29,900. 😂😂
Made in China version of Jordan belfort
Got $100 left in your account? Kids dying from starvation? Use that last $100 to buy surgical equipment and harvest your dead kids kidneys. Then just sell them on the dark market and buy my course!!!
Same game i walk right out of the door a minute a sales man starts talking or acting like they have any kind of power
Jordan Belfort an actual amazing salesman proved this guy doesn’t know anything about selling in his podcast
That car salesman is a real pos
Cardone is full of b.s and hot air
seems like a scammer, how is he gunna make someone 1mill off 30k rofl
Talk to me like this and I'd pull out of that deal instantly.
This is Bert Dingleberry from Bert Dingleberry Enterprises. Let's do this!
This man is if cancer had cancer.
How to close the deal? Clearly you insult the customer into thinking he's stupid if he doesn't take your offer.
I was a telemarketer for over a year. This is exactly how I made sales. Tell em how smart they would be to buy, and if that fails you just tell them how stupid it would be not to. Whatever the reason, you gotta have a rebuttal.
So you are proud of closing this 30k sale by basically insulting the guy over $100 telling him he needs to find a street corner to beg on? To most people in the United States today $100 is a lot of money. $100 can make the difference between getting all your bills paid or not for the month, $100 can make the difference between having food on your table for the whole month or not $100 can make the difference between your car being repoed or not. All I see in this video is a rich asshole who doesn't understand the value of $100.
Its funny watching you guys feel surprised about people doing 30K deals even after the closer shut him down.  I work in a timeshare company and trust me what he said and did was not even close to what most of the seniors do here.  I been working for 4 months now and what i realized is that people would go even crazier and pay more than 30k on the spot if u find their hook.   Selling is 4 issues, u solve them you sell: 1- Make them love you  2- Make them Trust you  3- Create a need for them  4- Create a rush for them
So sleazy.
same dumb school of pena/dan lok and the rest of the slimeballs . They say they wanna help others make money but give a 3 day mindset course that can be found for free in the neighborhood library
👎🏼🤦🏻‍♂️
This is ridiculous. You would never speak to a customer this way trying to close a deal. I’ve done 2-300,000 deals many times and firstly you would never risk the business saying things like this. Secondly, over $100 you would never walk away or try to get up him over $100. $100 is nothing, you’d close the deal straight away.
Use to have so much respect for this guy when i first found out about him
Never be afraid to pull the Ole " Walk Away"....The Cardone Bunch would of Folded like a Cheap Blanket.
This guy is a fraud, no? Coffeezilla did a video about him
How this guy's net worth is 300 mil is beyond me.
Sounds like a good way to not close a sale lol
Youtube morons love this shallow ass bs
Find a corner to beg on... $100 is alot of money hell $50 is alot of money
This reminds me of Wolf of Wall Street. Hahaaaa
EWW...GOOD MF'N LUCK! 👍Some people like to be talked to this way...I, however, DO NOT! 🙄  How solid was this deal, if $100 put it in jeopardy?  In his mind, he thinks: Why be just the ASSHOLE,  when I can be THE WHOLE ASS?!?!   You can be successful, and NOT be this guy! Gauge your audience!
First off , I feel this is fake. Who spends 30k and is worried about $100?
This is the worst type of salesmen hahaha
This man is almost like a scammer, at least in his methods
I’ve never got this guy
That dude looks like the most shadiest back door two face scamming car salesman I ever seen in my life
I love how ppl are finally seeing right through these guys
Give him 100 bucks lol 😆
Never trust a Guy who talks to Much.  Most of it is 💩💩💩.
Going to make yourself a million...
This is some trash used car salesman shit. I wouldn't do ANY deal for ANY price with someone who verbally bullies people into deals like this. This man is not to be trusted for anything.  Scripted or not, this man deserves zero respect as a salesman.
Talk to me like that and I'm taking my business elsewhere  period.
If 100 doesnt matter why are you fighting for it so hard
If Somebody was talking to mě like that I would hang up..
This dude only posts videos of him closing sales that were already gonna be closed anyway dude is incredibly annoying
"Get his credit card right now!"
Lol $100 is nothing... then why you want it so bad?  Get on that corner buddy
This dude has based his entire personality off of Matthew McCaughey in Wolf of Wallstreet and he's not nearly as charming or charismatic. Just a douche with a lot of money
Sad to see someone's ego so inflated he is so easily manipulated
This is faked to try and make him look cool and smart.
If this were real that would be a real good way to lose a customer and probably get your ass beat
People pay 10k year to listen to this guys tell you how to make him rich?!?!
I'm sorry, this really sounds like all those salesmen from movies who are just there to scam you for every penny you got so I'm good to beg off the streets thank you
In the marketing consulting world, you earn a button for each promotion you get.
Isn’t this guy’s time worth more money doing something else?  If his time was worth $500-$1000 per whatever time unit and the guy on the phone was asking for $100,  I think it would be a better use of time to give him the $100 break.
Apparently people actually pay this man . So obviously it works.. kinda grimy to me though but i guess that's what it takes to acquire wealth
This guy is going to end up in bracelets listen to Jordan Belfort talk about him he is actually a trash salesman to. On the other hand he is a incredible marketer
Just on that street corner comment, i would have cursed him out and hung up, very disrespectful. If a $100 is the deal breaker, then give the customer the break.
If $100 wouldn’t make a difference either way… why not give it to him? 🤔
$100, that's a game changer... Take note, kids.
Of course the sleaze ball would upload  upload a call to tiktok.
Dude kinda looks like Ben Affleck
If a dealer doesn't want to lower 100 bucks on 30k sale by "what's 100 bucks m8?", I'm reversing it around and going "yeah, you're right, you need to lower that by 200 instead if that amount means so little to you"
Everyone here salty is broke, it’s about your mental. Period. Look at the way his salesperson laughs nervously when he tells the customer to call him a bitch, that’s how you know you got the ‘quan.’
Ew.
Nah
They played you if they they want to keep their hundred dollars and they want to get it from you and you don't want to give it to him and you gave in if they want to make the sale drop it $100
Absolute joke. Just scammed someone for $30k for his garbage “Cardone University”
Employee: *tries same script* Customer: aiite peace Boss: wtf you lost the customer over $100?!  Ur fired!
Lol goes both ways. Why are they worried about 100 dollars.
This dude is horrible 🤣
When I see this fella one word comes to mind no matter how much money he has asshole
Imagine being this shitty and aggressive to a customer over a 0.3% discount
Sounds like that guys getting scammed for 30k
30k for a course wtf
Jordan belfort
.... The ending just made it better (worse) for me :  "get his credit card info right. Now."  Edit: it's also crazy to think that a guy signing up for grant Cardone's class wouldn't recognize Cardone's voice or at least his dialog
STAGED CALLS
When people talk to much put that shit in slow motion…. Like an astronaut in the ocean
Douche bag
He's selling his sales program to business owners and sales team leaders. He is so aggressive because that gives the client confidence that they will be able to close deals like that when they buy the sales training.
Staged
Someone in this video is really feeling themselves... can anyone point him out?
Someone explain
I would never close the deal with a salesman that cocky.
Garbage product isn't even worth $300. He isnt helping anyone make any money
He’s saying $100 dollars is nothing. If so why don’t he give him $100 off?
If this wasn't scripted, the way he started speaking to the guy on the phone would be enough for me to hang up and move on from that company.
LoL! I have walked away from deals for $50! In my position as well as many who are in the same, it has nothing to do with the money!!!! It’s the f@#king game!!!! 😎
Snake 🐍
Dang... Convince the guy to spend 30k and then rub his nose in it that he just got scammed by saying it was for Grant Cardone Uni... Lol
Reminds me of the wolf of wall street.🤣
If I was being talked to by a salesperson like that, I would tell them off and hang up. I’m not going to be disrespected when trying to do business, especially when I’m the one paying the person money. That’s insane.
I would have hung up on anyone that spoke to me like that and found someone else that isn't a complete prick!
Scammed
Whats he selling
I would off just told him if a $100 is nothing then tell you what you pay it and have a deal people never let these first talking mf what you should be doing no sir from he said to me l should stand on a street Conner the phone would off cut off
Cmon.   This is grant not acknowledging he closed it Bec who is.  Not what he was doing.  Still it’s a good clip
I understand where the dudes coming from if 100 bucks is going to be a problem maybe you should not do it if your gonna be broke but then again your being a hypocrite because you are begging for 100 to your lucky it worked because most people don't like to be talked to like that I mean  just a 17 year old who knows how to play games lol but I am smart enough to know how some things work but if someone is asking for a 100 dollars off it might be for gas and food to get up there
A true sales person will never talk that way to a customer. It’s either this video was staged or cardone thinks he is the big man. Ultimately it’s a scam. No one becomes a millionaire thru a course! Lol
I could watch wanna be alphas stroke themselves all day 🤣  this ass hat is getting rich hustling other people's money.   A real day of work would kill him.
To sound like a douche...follow this channel
Who the hell is grant Cardone? Cardone University? Prolly right up there with trump university.
Heyyy, you've just figured out the *#1 money making strategy relevant to the internet right now!!!* 😱😱😱😱💰💰💰📈📈 Spam the algorithm with trash content, the bare minimum of ability/capital/talent to flex on the noobs, flex the *money* and use all the buzz words. Hey presto, you're on your way to securing capital through exploitation of the monetized YouTube algorithm... Would I do this? Yes.. but with talent, and raw content... And this goes for you as much as it does the rest of the social-media-clout-thotties that have utterly oversaturated the airwaves these days. Fk. The internet truly has degenerated into cringe and recycled content with some glimpses of personality and character and talent here and there. It truly is content bedrock here. I and the rest of the community pray the quality comes back to media.  Tiktok. Our time is all running out on this rock.  Rant over. Make better quality content next time and take more pride in your work and the brain cells of the people making you money.  Cheers X
The problem with the call is it got taken over and he took control immidiately resulting into the other dude having no choice but to say yes
Bro I wouldn't do business with you. With customer service like that. K bye
*Tells the consumer to beg on the street* "That's how you close sales."
You speak to customer that way one day yoy may loose teeth😄
And people still fall for this crap... god we're a stupid race
Grant cardone is a KNOWN fraud.
Why in the world would you ever risk losing a $30k sale over $100??? Good business is about leaving a pleasant “taste” in your customers mouth so they come back to do more business with you and send you referrals. Kids, these “sales gurus” are all fraud, read books and learn through experience. This guy is not a business man.
Wow 😮 He’s one Arrogant irritating 😠 PRIC 🤷🏼‍♂️❗️
I see no difference between this guy and a typical car salesman.
Snakes in suits. Aggressive sales is so gross, you gotta be numb or dead to do it. Takes me back to the Amway days.
$100 out of my pocket into yours. Not happening
@grantCardone help me live life comfortably
100.00 per day, for 10 years is 365,000.00 100 dollars is a lot of money.  now 10x customer...gives in.. 3,650,000.00 the guy on the other end of phone is a better man
If he's not willing to give me $100 discount I'm walking away. If he has so much money what's it to him?
Cringe
Why would anyone pay that for a course anyway
That last part... "Get his Credit Card Right Now" ... The part we didn't hear him say out loud... "Before he realizes he just got hustled for 30K"...
Such BS... If $100 don't make a difference and you are going to help make that person "$1M" then give the discount and take it off the backend if you are so sure of yourself... Plus you said it yourself $100 either way doesn't change anything 🤷🏾‍♂️
And this is how billionaires get rich. They promise people to help them become millionaires for a hefty price.
Well.. I geuss it worked. But every customer is different keep in mind. Not everyone feels tested by insult into making irrational decisions. Understand your emotions and why you feel the way you do, make rational decisions.
He is the next Dan Belzerian of the internet
Smells like a con man
"Get his credit card right now" grant cardone.
Scripted 🐍
Great video,what growth stocks or crypto  I buy amid sell-off? i'm a newbie looking to secure passive income with digital assets (crypto) I've over 60k to begin with
Bro asked for 100 dollars off and had to listen to some dude who is full of shit and himself spew garbage through a phone
Get his credit card right now before he changes his mind. What a puke
You can close the deal but your trophy wife still won’t close her legs for the pool boy
Scam
Snakes
i would hang up on any sales person this aggressive
Wolf Of Wallstreet style
Looks more like a Ponzi scheme to me
That at the end get his credit card alright
Scammers everywhere are in shock
This type of person doesn’t age well.
Wow. No one who spends those figures on a purchase tolerates being spoken to like that. Disrespect is intolerable in any relationship. What a Creep/Cretin. Why do I sense a Swindle? This is how Scammers close in on cash transfers...
“If $100 was so small for you then you can obviously bring it down that little bit? No? Then you’re a hypocrite I’ll find someone else that’ll treat me better” *click*
What's the sale for.
So cringe! I would of hung up in the first few seconds lol
Lol sad
Guess I need to go beg on street corners now
Don't act like Grant.
Man makes money off of scamming people's money.
Get his credit card 🥸💀🤌.
Get a credit card now
Entrepreneur please don’t believe this is how negotiations are done. a lot of these guys are just public speakers or run some online university. They don’t make their money negotiating they make their money by getting people to believe in them and pay for their books or online class. Don’t put down a customer for 0.0034%. If a person is willing to give you 30k for a online certificate from a non accredited “university”. Be a little nicer.
Bro the way he said, "get his credit card" and 'thanks for doing business" seems like they're dirty mofo's.
Hahaha
This is sad and cringey and f a k e
What a shit bird. Worst part is people eat his shit up.
This is scripted and they're a bunch of grifters
Exactly who you don’t want to do business with
So bully you're customers and demean them into overpaying for your bs. Got it.
See kids - sales was hardcore back in the 80s!
He really said go sell some ass
I don't know who needs to hear this but stop saving all your money. Venture into Investing some, if you really want financial freedom.
Nick shouldn't worry about the $100. He should worry about the several thousands Cardone is scamming from him for his bullshit courses.
I feel I just bared witness to crime ...  that man just got robbed for 30k  OVER THE PHONE!!!!
If that $100 is not a big deal then why is he making it a big deal?
Thank you man. People who stress over 50-100€ when they reach quad digits kinda whack me tf out
Hi
Grant you havent got a clue how to sell.  This was clearly exposed by the interview you had with Jordan Belfort.  You rely on marketing and prospect awareness to be able to close a deal.  A good salesperson does not need to rely on marketing to prospect and close sales.   You did a massive disservice to yourself but an enormous service to the rest of us by proving you know very little about the actual art of sales.
Yes
Wow.. amazing to see others who trade with Mrs Regina peters, i'm currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously.
I make huge profits on my investment since i started trading with Mrs Regina peters, her trading strategies are top notch.
Thats when you simply say, "if a hundred dollars doesn't matter why aren't you paying it?" Pay me or step on bro. Simple.
At the end when he say who he is , he is basically saying , ha you’ve just been scammed 😂
Well looks like i need to go beg on the street corner
How could you ever partner with someone trying to sell you like that on the phone.
Dude just pulled a wolf of wall street!! Haha
This is so dumb why doesn’t the guy turn around and spit it right back at em. Hey Grant, if you’re worried about a hundred bucks why don’t you go beg on a street corner.
Well done Grant
I was able to build a big income stream during the covid 19 pandemic investing with a professional broker, Mr Abdullah Al Namer
Over 24000$ in 7 days is a good ROI
I sometimes feel this is scripted...who in their right minds would do business with someone who talks to them like that
They could have asked JB  He will explain.
I close 30k deals over the phone everyday and I never talk to customers like that. And I don't walk away for a hundred bucks.
Sharks on sardines 😂
Lmao he's like "get his credit card" before he changes his mind 🤣 poor guy paying $30k for something that's worth about 10% of that if that. But can't blame uncle G, he is about making money
How?
If anyone buying this garbage you’re a fool.
Why bro 😈😈😈😈
I need to think bigger
Yey or Ney Nick whats it gonna be Nicky boy 😎
Money is backed by bombs guys I wish it was backed by a “ worldwide distributed network invincible of bombs” as a starter? Maybe just second to corporations that control the internet either control or have a large stack in what the country does.
Damn. That’s how you do it. I would of have the $100 lol
This is old but still classic Uncle G
I feel sad for his blind followers. There are many videos of him getting exposed, educate yourselves guys 🤣
So it's all about tension. Tension makes a muscle grow, tension makes a deal close.
Pssshhhh
Why dint you just give the dude 100$ off lol
OK, I'll admit it, I was getting ready to bust your balls BUT the fact that you didn't flex your name until AFTER he was already sold is much respect Uncle G. Youre the man!
People who aren’t willing to invest in themselves are wasting their time and money.
Hey man you are amazing, and absolutely right
Nice video Big like from Jakarta
100$ each month for 30 years ? Bruh .
🏘🙅🏿‍♀️🌎🙅🏻‍♂️🏘
