cool i was at the visitor center for this
Just for 1000 comment count.
This was launched on my birthday and it has to be the greatest thing I have ever seen and experienced.
Amazing as always. Congrats Elon Musk, SpaceX everyone involved for the epic work. Elon Musk love you very much, please give me a birthday present, expand the scope and scale of my consciousness and life with an opportunity.🤟🧠🚀🛰🛸🪐🌡🎖🏆👑🤩❤💯👏
📡Starlink🛰️ for N. Senitel Island🏝️
Fast, safe, and effective. As always!
This is the absolutely incredible space.
Amazing
Beautiful photographi
Is there a distance shot of a booster landing on a barge?    I think a distance shot from another ship observing the barge landing would be an interesting angle.
I really can't wait
Attitude control????
So before SpaceX, what was the biggest hindering obstacle that hindered the construction of reusable rockets that can land?
art is making something difficult looks easy
I just watched the first Saturn V launch, and now seeing this all happen in real time is so amazing. Literally to launch, separate, and re-land in 8 minutes, all streamed live on the internet.
It’s nice to see that America is completely in the green 🙂
Thank you for shading beautiful ❤❤❤
Algum dia irei olhar pela janela e dizer "hoje esta um belo dia para explorar Marte". Tomara que eu esteja vivo para ver estes avanços...
The more numbers the more intel I agree!!!
I would love to see the estimated G forces from each cam's POV in real time.
Elon Musk is genius... brilliant 🤩😍🙌🏻
Now that's what I call unpredictable and entertaining 🤙  forget about the audio that a suggested Ellen      on my sub's .                   "SpaceX rules"
168km high and the earth was still flat

Waiting for SpaceX mission to Exoplanets & parallel universe..  Beat the record of this four countries:-  Soviet union, China, Russia and Japan ..
i like the new webcast intro!
To a pilot that rate of closure to the cloud tops and then the landing barge has me gripping the seat with my sphincter every-time. Fantastic and very slick operation
Day launch always has this magnificent view. Perfect footage from drone ship camera. Greetings from Russian citizen to all of you. I'm very glad that at least someone is trying to reach another planet and make the future while someone put us back in history of war and Gulag.
Can't wait till a giant solar wind comes along and causes a satelite apocalypse
USA launches a rocket to make life better for humanity.  Russia launches a rocket to threaten the existence of humanity.
Thanks for using km/h and km as units 🤔
I was there at Kennedy Space Center
13:45 Lol just read the instructions is that the name of the drone ship or is she being told to get back on script?

Love you guys at SpaceX
spaceX, greatest investment of NASA.
Would love some drone footage every time a booster lands. Would be awsome :)
Go SPACE X!!! Whenever things are F@#&$D up I come here to watch rocket launchs. You guys are so dam AWESOME Thanks

I am pretty sure I saw the satellites last night almost directly overhead about 9PM CST

Kate, you did a great job hosting and clearly explaining all phases of this mission here.
There’s something to be said for vertical integration and being aspirational & persistent & honest enough to make routine what once in the realm of sci-fi.
Can someone explain gimbling, please? I did not understand it.
Nice and nice landing Falcon 9
Great to see little old NZ on the green part of the map for Starlink connectivity
THE PEOPLE HAVE NO FOOD BUT THE RICH HAVE INTERNET ---- WE ARE PROUD OF THAT.
CAMERAS IN THE SKY -- AMAZING HOW THEY DO THAT.
HOW MUCH DID TAXPAYERS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LAUNCH THAT COULD BE CGI. AND FEW WOULD KNOW.
He that believeth on him(Jesus Christ) is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.   (John 3:18) - It's the last time. The Lord is coming soon. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
11:11 Max q :   This is the point where the mathematical expression (density × 1/2 velocity²) is maximum. It is called  erroniously 'pressure' . The actual stagnation pressure is considerably higher .  The physical meaning is the kinetic energy density of the relative flow from the point of view on the  rocket. Only at low speeds is this 'dynamic pressure' equal to the stagnation pressure. q as defined above is just a reference value.
That's amazing.
Awesome! Who would have believed this a mere 15 years ago??
So a Tesler is faster to 60 mph than a Falcon heavy
What’s the point of this?
I just saw a long string of lights spread out across the night sky, and I can only imagine it was a satellite constellation delivery.
man, i hope im alive when we can fly in and out of earth like the movies!
What's that floating thing around 14:25 on the engine that mysteriously vanishes?
hows laser comm. coming along?
I cant believe how fast this all happened good look with the future projects . space rocks.
Those legs got a bit crunched. Did their job though!!
launching to where,,, we went to the moon in JFK days,, now we have electric cars and personal cameras, computers,,phone in our hand .. not Impressed
Here are American broomsticks 👍🏾
Great explanations
should of just put a huge nuke warhead on it and send it over to you know who
Never gets old!!!
This is awesome
2:50 sounds like Hal-life 1 tram intro
Watching the landings is like watching 50's era Sci-Fi movies, it's just that now my throat gets a lump in it and my eyes tear up a little.
Never. Gets. Old.
The future is looking good
Brilliant. They don't need a marketing department because these videos do the job perfectly.
what time stamp where it blows up??
Good job Kate! Lots of great information and a nice presentation.
When she said “just read the instructions” LMFAOOOO

What Elon Musk has done with this company and with everything else he's touched is simply amazing! Haters will hate but facts and numbers don't lie!
I Hope we will finally go to mars 🚀
19:26 I'd take her to lunch and give her a sterling payload deployment of my own thrusting full power on 're entry 😎😉😉
9:43 <--- countdown
Love you Elon <3
I'm ok E tell them.
The weaponry that the western sheeples masters have is amazing!
Suck this Putin! How many flights do you recover?
Bom dia a todos. Fron Brasil.
I'm always mesmerized by the Booster landings. it never gets old and it's always exciting to see it land. it has a familiar Sci-Fi feeling to it, like all these while we've seen either a Millennium Falcon or X-Wing land in movies. now it's reality, we have a rocket booster land...  i mean HOW AWESOME IS THAT??? ROFL
❤
the liftoff of this video is exactly at 10' on a 20' long video.
Why is it you never get to see a front veiw of going into space? Do They block out as much as they can of space so you have no idea what's really happening?
Marvelous images! How about some sound from the drone ship (what does double sonic boom sounds like in the middle of the sea?!?! What does a rocket landing on a floatable football field sounds like!!)
Cringe at the constant never gets old comments
🙏
That ring that pops off second stage engine nozzle is a stiffener?
Woo hoo! 12th landing! Beautiful!  Thanks for sharing.
Still watching, every time they go up, and every time they land. Incredible.
Absolutely astounding to watch - yet again! It never gets old 😎  I just love those seemingly whimsical names for the droneships... 🤣🤣🤣
It is insane how SpaceX can send a rocket into space, drop a satellite into orbit and land the rest of the rocket all in just over 8 minutes. Science had come so far.
1 ooo ooo Lyes
The camera angle at 14:26 of the 2nd stage makes it look like the 2nd stage is going retrograde.
Amazing launch as always, and hello Kate :)
Nobody gonna talk about how the thumbnail looks like an orbital laser firing at the launchpad
the thumbnail looks like an orbital laser obliterating an enemy base
this is so cool.  I LOVE SPACE!  Elon Musk ftw!
STOP SATELLITE POLLUTION NOW!
it never gets old...
Love you guys--Save Ukraine!
first starlink launch i can say i watched on starlink! thanks for the great service spacex!!! best rural internet in Canada and the world!
Faultless yet again SpaceX team, well done........  Yet another stage 1 dead centre landing. Just brilliant to see :-)
Vous êtes passé au-dessus de la région parisienne, on vous a vu hier soir 🇨🇵
Witnessing the Booster landing, makes me realize that Future is now!
Im so proud of you as a human
The thumbnail looked like a death ray from orbit...you ok Elon?
Friendly hosting required eventually @foxnews How do you expect promote the integrity of the twins concept if you're not even able to give me a straight warm welcome?.... @ninjaextended Dance little monkey. Yes. #RIP
Good job Starlink
Bravo a toute l'Équipe de SpaceX, car vous faite vraiment du très bon boulot et c'est tjr un plaisir de voir vos décollages A+👽
Wow, The CGI production on this is Top Notch.. 🖕
Top 20 Anime Opening Spring 2022 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3541hMD3vU&ab_channel=KuroWolf
20 minutes...... We used to prepare a week for a launch live on TV, a big event that everyone would watch and be apprehensive for hours ... 20 minutes... And we get to watch a rocket land itself... Like it was nothing...
Why can't we just put Elon in charge of the world/everything? 👍👍
Musk is not just a genius, he get things done.  Much respect to him and everyone at SpaceX
Broomstick Effect 😎
Elon musk: See my rockets they are the best  Pentagon: we have UFO's 🛸   Elon musk:
Ahhhh man. Should be working, but why not 10 minutes to watch this. Thanx SpaceX
I'm really amazed at the length of the selfie stick on the second stage it's amazing how it has a totally nearly lateral view and from such a large distance. I guess the air is so thin it wouldn't break off like it would in the lower atmosphere.  Man there's a lot of hydraulics on this thing.
There is something wrong with the speedometer on this video all the other SpaceX videos in the past have shown the first stage going to zero kph at peak before returning, this one does the opposite and shows it going even faster 8000 kph no less as it turns around stops ascending and starts to come down. Woops! Haha. Cant always be perfect. 🤭 Well at least the rocket was perfect that's the only thing that counts
Never before have we gotten to see the first stage go all the way up in first person perspective through the lower atmosphere through the clouds and all the way up to Max q and higher! Well done SpaceX!
Amazing upgrade on the cameras! For the first time in history we get to see a complete flight in 1st person perspective from launch to separations! Full flight, no lag, and hd quality. A Trifecta no less! Thank you Elon for finally spending the money to upgrade.  ;)
Lost my interest. Don't care to watch Twitter goes to Space. Thought we were watching a genius at work dedicated to the advancement of humanity not another Billionaire Boy wanting to buy his way to influence people with his money not his deeds. No longer rooting for a power hungry Mad Scientist.
space thats deep
noice
It is really amazing how that booster can find this little barge hundreds of miles out in the middle of the ocean. It's almost routine now, but still very impressive.
I love watching these launches thinking hopefully one would give me internet in mid to late April as promised... But I missed the email that came Early April 5 th. So now I sent another down payment and I must wait until 2023 or after it says. Still not understanding why I needed a ship confirmation when I waited over a year already and haven't cancelled.. I'm completely clueless. Elon I'm just a noname that had faith that I would finally have home internet in mid to late April... Only to get cancelled April 5th. At that moment I realize that it was a dirty joke this whole 1+year I've been waiting. Please help me get home internet soon. Thank you so much for all you do with the knowledge you have.
Elon I’m finally getting a Tesla for the summer
Well presented .
i miss the videos we used to get from the fairing halves on re entry. Some spectacular views on those cams.
@ElonMusk how about a job for an inventor?
The Intro is beautiful.
Incredible
Can't wait for moon mission
SpaceX continues to push forward in space so thankful Elon and SpaceX workers are making America the leaders in this tech
Thumb looks like an orbital bombardment. Cool!
Great coverage! Kate sounds precise like Mr. Insprucker, adding a little bit of graciousness. Awesome footage is a bonus. Congratulations to the team
At 16:56 2nd engine  What moves around the outside of the engine counterclockwise?  You see the same type of movement again about 1 min later.
what does that for
Why did that thumbnail look so bad ass?
Yep. Still watch every last one of these.
Add some lasers capable of taking out Russian military equipment and that will get my attention .
Florianópolis o/ Spacex was born here 🤩🌎🚀🪐✨
Woohoo!!!!!!
Is this why my service went down lol, had to reboot the old boy!
Let's hope there is a better name for the drone ship in the future. 🙄
Nice nice nice nice nice Nice nice nice nice nice Nice nice nice nice nice Nice nice nice nice nice Nice nice nice nice nice Nice nice nice nice nice
a question from Spacex:  If countries stopped funding the military defense industry and united, would humans be on Mars by 2024?
Landing off centre, I call a partial failure :):)
Great narration Kate👍
Kate Tice...smooth as a gravy sandwich.  Well done as usual Kate.  You have skills beyond QA/QC :)
when we see starship in space??? wtf???
Kate Tice or John Insprucker. Either way it's going to be a great launch.
ELON MUSK FOR PRESIDENT !!!!!
Great commentary today! There were some great nuggets of info ie. gravity turn, us lay folk weren’t aware of how the Falcon Booster worked its way to orbit.
first impression is the last impression. Those who like astronomy and space are never narrow minded
Thanks Elon! 👍
Man it'd be so cool to see starship fly for starlink mission
This is great . Works like a clock
Twitter is just to remind the world where we’re really going.
only a 5 year lifespan on those satellites, better hurry up and get the rest up to make starlink worth the (very expensive) price... otherwise you are just launching a bunch of satellites and making empty promises
Been using Starlink since last spring here in AZ and it has been very stable and around 75x faster than the other available option (copper phone line in rural area).  Though for some reason there was an odd 15-minute outage today.  Usually get one outage like that every couple of months.
9:58  Announcer's voice expression sounds like: "ho-hum, big deal, just another one."
(watches opening sequence),... yeah, one of those ain't a Falcon9 :D Can't wait to see Starship flying with the same reliability as F9.
Bro killed the storm wither
SubhanAllah 😳
When I was in college, I drove a taxi part-time. Spacex has a higher success rate of delivering its payload than I did.
What do the instructions say 😅
Amazing.... And the only thing blue origin can do is touch the edge of space. Only with the tip though 🤣🤣🤣
That was a fast and probably hot re-entry, looks like they are testing limits again.
Sorry, John, Kate just is the superior voice of SpaceX launches.
this women  talks way to much
just saw the stack fly over cincinnati about an hour ago!! seperation is going slowly but surely
Wow das muß man lieben.

Hello 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭Philippines watching
Dammm that’s cool
At least our 'broomsticks' are functional !    🤣🤣🤣😁
Space laser thumbnail
And people still say earth is flat lmfao
18:43 - Someone telling her to stay on script but she reads it out loud.
I just saw the train from this launch in Indiana. It may have been the most incredible thing that I have ever seen
Sooooo who's nasa again lol
So proud of you all!
NASA?
Twitter has been down this evening, guess its being linked up with Starlink.
Meanwhile in Boeing ...
Yes thank you I ordered mine over a year ago
Watching this on my Starlink internet! Here in Amish country central Pennsylvania, we had zero internet options at our house other than Hugesnet satellite internet and it worked 2 days out of the month at best and when it did work it was a max of 1.5 mbps second. Now thanks to Starlink we get around 210mbps! Been a total game changer for our family.
Watching this 4k on starlink, thanks elon!
wu tang..
I hope one day that SpaceX lets go of the talking chick.
GG's gravity
Never gets old
THAT LANDING IS JUST AMAZING
elons net worth and stock value will go x10 in next decade lol
Thanks SpaceX !!! You kick ass. Can't wait for Starship to move humanity even further forward.
Why does this particular launch look so smooth and beautiful and weirdly perfect in every way.
Who doesn´t want space lasers?
Good Job Elon! two down two to go time to bring Axium home and send up Crew 4. hope the weather cooperates.
The thumbnail looks like SpaceX just shot a laser out of nowhere.
18:00 landing is spaceX's cup of tea 😌
You need to make an electric rocket
Now I deduce that NASA doesn't care about the efficiency of SpaceX because they won't be able to waste what tax payers are paying the losers🤣🤣🤣
Do they have this in Spanish for my girlfriend?
"Vehicle now cruising in slow motion,  at a thousand kilometers per hour."
Its pretty cool watching the latest starlink launch while using the starlink internet way up north in Northern BC Canada! I havent had internet in 10 years and i just picked up my starlink yesterday.
NASA!!! Fire ULA and let Elon Musk finish the job.😆😆😆
Amazing video!
We can all agree that these launches never fail to entertain us 💙
Broomsticks seem to be working great!
Fantastic! Keep going.
If you could go to Home Depot and buy some new paint before each launch, that would be great.
That was a soft landing
Watch out Elon China is on the prowl looking for more ideas to steal let's take it to the Stars
We never seen full landing !! Alweys some problems!! ....🤣🤣🤣
Activate my cell already. Every cell next to us is active, been pre-ordered for almost 15 months now... this wait is getting asinine. Watching everyone around us who never even pre-ordered get their service instantly is a slap in the face.
Why is it only low orbits?
flat earthers left the conversation...
Nice!  Loved how the booster had to pass through the cloud cover before the drone ship came into view.  Certainly added much deserved drama to the successful landing!  Great job Space X!!
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
Looking forward! 18 flights to go before it surpasses NASA’s Space Shuttle STS 133 successful return flights!
Sci-Fi live.
is this the broom stick the Russians were referring too ???
This was filmed in Spielbergs basement on a sound stage.
Minuto 16:55 en la cámara derecha ... Qué es?
The workhorse is still going that’s crazy.
Musk was one failed launch away from total failure and bankruptcy. You wanna know why? God. Elon Musk was destined for greatness, and God wanted to make him pray to Him. This pattern is everywhere in the Bible. It's a kind of resurrection.
Just routine now😳
Amazing, 115 1st stage recoveries x 9 Merlins per booster = 1035 rocket engines that aren't in the ocean. Not to mention all the saved metals and plastics. And it looks so easy now. I'm super excited for Starship to get moving forward again. Shame on the FAA and the Biden Administration.
On trending wow
Space force is not real
Beautiful!!! Space is humanity's hope!
You folks are making this look easy.  Don't ever get WOKE, and the real people of the world will always have your backs against the Government!
Elon Musk has accomplished some really amazing things, he has put his money to good use and achieved things nobody had ever dreamed of. Incredible watching this launch and realizing how far SpaceX has come under his leadership.
I'd like to know about the process of recovering the fairing halves and what shape those halves are in considering the speeds at which they hit the water.
🥴
Beautiful as always
It's routine 😎❤ well done SpaceX! 🚀👏👏
Happy to hear Test Shot Starfish make a return.
Not bad for a 12th time using a broomstick.  Great job by the SpaceX team as always.
Elon Musk is evil. Never trust him.
Still phenomenal! 115 times!
OMG shut up lady! Stop talking over the calls!!
dude 54 satellites per falcon launch ... this is doable go elon go space x!!!!!
Ask Elon to orbit this batch of satellites over lower Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. I'm desperate for something better than Centurylink 1.5mb DSL service.
never gets old
I know you have to be diplomatic but FAA deserves no thanks.
That is one beautiful sight!and the landings never get old. Thry are so fascinating!
Beautiful
amazing landing
Always an amazing sight to be seen.
I have to ask... Who is the commentary for? They've been doing this for so long now id like to think they could trust that most of their viewers understand what their looking at. I miss the raw streams...  Edit: I wonder the percentage of old versus new viewers.
These launches are becoming like weekly sitcoms at this point.
It's incredible how routine this all feels, it's hard to imagine just 10 years ago this was just a dream
Російський Путін - диявол людської цивілізації, який скрізь показує зло і завдає болю іншим! Якнайшвидше розберіть злий гвинт і захопіть Путіна, щоб його судили і повісили! Пора повністю знищити Росію! Боріться з цим, щоб ніколи не перевернутися, мир у всьому світі та цивілізація! Україна має перемогти!
Kate, I can hear you loud and clear on my high-fidelity (37 years old) here in Portugal. Not yet through Starlink...   :-D.
Australia Greetings from Perth....   ...///
wow
The show is always almost perfect. The quality of the images has improved significantly through time. I hope the war does not end this. It would postpone Mars for a century. SpaceX, keep working hard!
So cool
Congratulations Elon Musk and @spacex!!! Another beautiful launch and recovery!
Вот что надо продвигать а не заниматься в госдуме в пиджаках  всякой хуйней ненужной...
When will SpaceX send a satelit to space that only purpose is to mine Bitcoin and Dodgecoin?  Computers need the cold, space is cold. The computer needs power, in space there is a sun. The satelit needs communication to earth, in space there are Starlinks. Looking forward to environmental friendly Bitcoins :-)
*JRTI:* _Welcome back B1060-12 !_ *B1060-12* _Home, James... Thanks for the ride!_
The home rocket is cool but landing the booster is awesome
The narrator for this mission did a great job! Thank you.
Man, these events never get old! Thank you, @SpaceX, to continue to show the way and continuously improve the launches and processes.  "To boldly go ..... " as they say.
The thumbnail looks like a particle beam
I've watched so many of these now and even though they all look virtually the same I'm still amazed every time.
Fantastic. If humanity doesnt destroy itself Elon and the brains of SpaceX will be remembered for many generations.
Love how beat up the fairings and body are yet watching it perform flawlessly.
The world is over. Amazing Awesome 🏆😉👍💙
Take a rocket 🚀  and make it flyable on earth or take a plane and make it flyable in space. No big launch necessary just take off on a strip and enter space any time.
Never gets old.
Ive been on the wait list for awhile now..... Can't wait!
Why are we using rockets instead of making planes that can take off on a landing strip to go into space? Rockets are a waste of time. Theirs nothing else you can do with them. Space capable aircrafts are the future not rocket tech. Serious question though. Why can't we make planes that are space flight capable?
Would be great if SpaceX recorded each launch with 3D audio so we can really get a better sense of experiencing it in person!
Beautiful liftoff Philippe from Lyon
👏🏻🙌🏻🌌
Still amazes me to this day, I can only imagine where we go from here <3
🤯😳 wow......so cool
Are all Merlin engines removed after flight for refurbishment or replacement? How many launches is a Merlin currently used for? Thank you.
Yes Starship blows up a lot but don’t forget that SpaceX is capable of Falcon 9 levels of reliability. When Starship is as reliable as Falcon 9 access to space will be changed forever.
grey were service is pending lol the rest of the planet. Smart beautiful and funny. Hi Kate.
Space x is truly a God sent for the US and Her allies! Congratulations to the entire space X team.
The thumbnails look like they're shooting a giant laser into space
Yeah, even more trash around the planet! good job...
Congratulations💫 and Thank You Sharing 🤘🏻🌞🤘🏻 You are All True and Brilliant Badasses!!! Cannot Wait to See what the future holds.  Forge On Angels💛 Love from Texas
I’m so glad that spacex has begun development of starship. I need my periodic dose of explosive rocketry. Falcon 9 has become a good (tame) workhorse.
Humanity's Mission*
How many gravities of force are placed on the booster when it makes its re-entry?
👍👍
Awesome,  every time absolutely awesome, thankyou, all of you Team SpaceX!
Awesome!!
Kate Tice is a Quality Engineer Manager AND an amazing commentator as well. That's what I like about SpaceX - that the public face of the company consists of people like Kate Tice who really know their stuff. 👁️ 👁️    👄 Go Kate!!!
115 landings already... I love it. We are seeing the beginning of the human civilisation going to orbit and the moon and Mars and ....   And I hope this will only speed up. Just wish everyone on this planet would get along.
Very good presentator, she is funny and knows everything about the launch.
this is why there arent competitors at the moment  space x would absolutely smoke them  they took the space challenge and now they are the space challenge .. they get that stuff up into orbit "just like that - for a considerable fair price  and with damn good preceise routines  they would totally be my 1st call when i ever need a lift into orbit ..
Wish they would start to launch services in Africa.
watching the booster land is something else, we are in the future, well done all involved
Jst osm!!!the  tht booster landing amazes me everytime..go spaceX go!!!
How many of the engineers have a wager on how close to the bullseye the rocket will land.
Again, AMAZING achievement by the SpaceX team and thank you to it's founder for the vision and backing to get this started!
This is the most compelling case for the cancellation of the POS SLS.  If you were to do a cost analysis on a pound for pound basis comparing SLS to anything SpaceX, you would find enough cause to bring criminal charges against everyone in our gubernamunt associated with the administration of NASA.
Good job folks, as usual. Loving the improved landing footage these days. XOXOXO
I love how this is becoming more and more a routine...props to you Mr. Musk.
Hola! Solo una duda ¿después del aterrizaje de la primera etapa, la recuperación de las cubiertas y el despliegue de los satélites que pasa con la segunda etapa del cohete?
sick!
The thumbnail looks like orbital bombardment lmao.
50 more satellites is that what she said. wow. nice!
The ultimate company delivery truck.
want to go to space
I've been waiting over a year since we preordered.  Please don't succeed as much as possible
i hope to someday work for tesla, i have a idea as wild as the west and will give hyperloop a run for it's money. pattent pending
115 successfull landings of those Broomsticks 🤯
Are the satellites released in this batch numbers run in sequence.
The most lovely hesitating reading and in flight correction in space industry.  You're the best, love you Kate !!  🙂💙
❤ SpaceX !
I think NASA is the glorious past but SpaceX is the present and maybe the brightest future.  SpaceX team thanks for your effort!
I just turned 72. I love watching all your launches. Thanks to all you brilliant young people worldwide that have come together to make this wondrous new world possible. You are all greatly appreciated 👍🙏✊
Gratitudes from Ukraine 💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙
Maybe the host could broadcast from a room that doesn't have so much background noise.
.
Dawns here ☀️
What's Max Q? I can never hear it explained enough.
Loving the Improved stability of signal during landing. Such brilliant shots.
I’d like to see the pick up of the booster at sea.
Stunning views, new milestones, plus Kate as commentator. This was a great watch, thank you for the ride!))
Love the landing shot with the new bolted down starlink! Video didn’t cut out once!
I like how the droneship camera feed is now more stable than the rocket camera. 👍
why did the telemetry and countdown disappear during MECO?
Fantastic commentary, what a wonderful job. SpaceX must certainly be the best company in the World to work for in Employment History and it is because of the Genius Leadership of Elon Musk...............
Parabéns
17:53 The Earth has become concave! 😅 Seriously, do you believe again what I was showing us?
cgi
THANK YOU!
All kinds of love for Kate!  She's a great role model for girls like mine!
I got the same feelings while watching the Gemini launches, a little while back. Still amazed!
Now this is how you build back better. You guys are awesome. Gives me chills every time I watch you guys launch 🚀
Thanks SpaceX! Another thrilling launch!! 👁🌟✌️
And this is the first launch that I'm able to use STARLINK to provide my internet to watch! Keep up the great work!
Nice CGI. You're a fool if you believe this bs.
8 people TERRIFIED of Elon owning twitter, yet don't care about the Crown Prince's percentage of ownership!
Saw the launch Sunday in California from a local mountaintop. Beautiful to see these stages in person. Found out there's about 20 seconds of latency with the stream.
SpaceX Really Is Quite Keen.
checkmate flat earthers !
👏👏👏👏👏❤️ Congratulations Again Everyone 👏👏👏👏🚀👍
Damn, when did they figure out how to stabilize the drone ship video from cutting out?
This is the first Starlink launch I have gotten to watch without lag and above 240p.  Thanks to Starlink, I am watching it without lag and at 4k.
new Starlink Satellite's is a great thing but after sitting for a year after paying for the dish and being told it is on back order or hold there is a problem.
Fantastic stuff !
rad
Amazing. If 1 booster cust +- 60 millions  . 115 boosters landings means SpaceX keep in the banc  6.900 Billions .....  it´s  the biggest revolution in Space exploration since the landing on the moon
Old, successful - and ever more reliable!
She said that MECO is to slow the ship down for separation.   That is not quite correct.   MECO is to stop acceleration so they can do separation.  I did like the statement she made at the end of the video: "Thank You to the FAA for supporting our mission".     They really need the FAA to stop throwing up road-blocks at Boca.    Sadly, I am afraid it is the white house, not the FAA that is pushing for the roadblocks.
Can anyone tell me whether the drone ship pilots itself back to Florida, or does Spacex put a crew on board to secure the rocket and pilot it back?
12th recovery, wow! SpaceX has lowered the cost of getting to orbit for sure.
The dream of space is alive thanks to SpaceX
Does Space-X hire autistic people..?
Hello
Hi
These launches are kinda pointless
Rocket nerds appreciate the great stream #KateTice
Nice broomstick
18:20 - looks like it tried to slew a bit to the left to hit a bullseye?
I love that My son has shared these launches with me I'm amazed every time 🤗
Best rocket in history !
What’s the website to order from?
The landing is always so much fun to watch. It always amazes me how quickly everything happens and how easy they make it look now.
ThankS!
Did I miss it?  Did they say how many times today's fairing was used?
She said Space Lasers (2:29) just to trigger people.  :)
awesome
Mars 2028
115th successful recovery
Well explained ! ..... Best launch coverage yet ! .... Cheers !
SpcaeX has no competition. Period.
Need my dose of hope for America
Looks like Musk did what NASA could not do because NASA squandered our tax payer dollars. NASA could be doing booster landings too. But why do that when they can waste taxpayer money scrapping them and polluting the oceans? Money grows on trees for NASA by way of corrupt money laundering Capitol Hill politicians.
Their successes have become routine missions, yet I’m still in awe of it all. Truly inspiring.
These are so consistent now, I wouldn't know if I'm watching a replay.  👍
The earth is flat...like a dish.🤓
A tiny red dot with the number 2 in it (overlayed on a small bell icon) always indicates a SpaceX launch to me. Seems like pretty good compression, information density relative to screen space, an extra unintended communication cumshaw.
Same old take off, same old rocket burns, same old everything. Really, really boring!!
BadAss!
I think its cool they launch gophers before the Falcon goes up, its good to practice a bit before the main deal!
18:20 You really get to see the shock absorbers doing their work on this one. Looks like the engine cut out maybe a foot or two high. I guess with the pitching and rolling floating platform the hoverslam isn't just _quite_ as precise as on land, but it's close enough for the shock absorbers in the landing leg struts to deal with it.
Just a 16 story building, coming in hot.
I think the place that launches these Starlink missions will be the last to get Starlink... never-mind I know that.
"for all you rocket nerds out there" - miss, I'm sorry to inform you your audience consists only of nerds, so nerd it up!
OOH! Now "Is it cake?" will stream faster...thank you Elon and team
Any emergency supplies to space drop  down to the Azovstal Steel plant?
Go SpaceX!
He hi i will meet you CEO elon muosk
Question for Elon…. Do you ever get tired of NOT sucking ?
Flying Broomstick technology werks as advertised  😎👌
Communists and DemocRATS hate this guy Musk.
Walk in the park. Nothing to see here.
I like how the lady explain everything But we want the Asian girl to come back  She fine as hell  CAN WE GIVE SPACEX A HELLL YEAHHHHH
GOT IT!
I love the 4k stream, but I would love even more if the on-board cameras recorded in 4k.
Wow, this is one of the most beautiful telecasts I've seen. Congrats Spacex team on both your rocket and your broadcasts, truly inspiring us all!
Did you see the rocket sway on the launch pad 50 seconds before take off?  Incredible.
Been on the list for well over a year and no word as to when I will get Starlink even though I am in an area with service.
Oh! Not long until one of the two life leaders goes for number 13!
I want to add to what others have said. These launches never get old! Every time I watch I feel emotional. I am in awe of what SpaceX has achieved. I can’t wait to see Starship fly to space! We are meant to go out there! And I for one believe we will go much farther than Mars. I am fully educated in the physics involved and know the limitations as they currently stand, but never the less, I still believe we will go very far indeed and these are the first steps.
These launches are getting old!
way to go!!! Hey, Elon, how about organizing a lottery for space flight? I want to win the first ticket 🙂
This never stops being breathtaking
What becomes of the 2nd stage?
😄
The landings are getting smoother and smoother. Then there is the beautiful, sharp and colourful 4k video quality that makes the entire scene on the ground and in space pop!
I could watch these all day! So cool!
Soot...
These guys are starting to reach reliability metrics that MANY other companies would be proud of. For launching rockets into space!
It’s crazy that booster has been to space 12 times!!
Wonderful launch. Can't get enough. Only I wish you were in more of a sound proof room to eliminate the sound of the crowd around the control center.  Sometimes they a re loader than the person in the control room. Love SpaceX though. 👍
All nominal.
Congrats!
I like the buttering comment at the end "thank you to the FAA for supporting our mission"  as if they aren't the ones holding up the Starship's launches...
Love those touchdowns!!
Always fenomenal! Yes, this never get's old!
Incredible. So happy NASA actually appreciates SpaceX. Grateful to have Elon and SpaceX in my country.
I still find myself clapping at every successful step, despite their great record, it is always a celebration to me.   The people I live with do not share the same enthusiasm for my celebrations in the middle of the night. Lmaooo. 🚀
Yet another broomstick takes flight!
Ohh the landings never get old 😍
never ceases to amaze me, the landing reminds me of the "martian chronicles" second expodition "zeus 2". It lands in the same way as these do.
When can Sweden use Starlink?
How many launches can a 1st stage fly ?
I just came here to watch the landing 😉
wow, always wow
It never ceases to amaze me even after watching every launch year after year.
I Bet Elon Musk Isn't Cool Enough To Like This Comment.
Always exciting. Always amazing.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
And just like that its in orbit, no drama no hassle just exactly same sequence time and time again, well done keep it up, F9 rocks.
I love it SpaceX!
can watch for a million times and still not get bored...loved it....
I have missed only 4  falcon launches
I had been on ViaSat for the last two years as it an HughesNet were my only option. I signed up for Starlink in March 29th of 2021 and 1 year and 11 days later, it arrived and I am using it now.  The difference is life changing. I earn my living online as a software developer so I'm online most of the day and night.  Starlink vs ViaSat is like a Porsche vs a skateboard. Both will get you there but one is *slightly* faster than the other. Thank you SpaceX & Starlink!!!!
What I want to know is could I survive a ride on the inside of a fairing half as it comes down or would the G forces be to much for me? I would expect to be in a suitable space suit and strapped in tight!😂
IMO that was the best narration so far, thank you.
Very Cool 🚀👍
12 landings on that booster, 115 overall? That is just absolutely incredible! Space X is so far ahead of the game it’s not even funny!
Thank you space X. for your phenomenal work, it just goes without saying that everything you folks are doing is simply amazing. God speed, the future looks bright for SpaceX, Hopefully the Biden administration will get out of the way and let you lead us further than any organization ever has. Just goes to show you what American innovation and leadership from the private sector looks like.
I support Russia ❤
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 *Now if only Elon Musk can make Twitter into something useable* 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
are they still optimizing lading procedure?
*30 years ago, this was science fiction, to have a reusable launch vehicle*
This is what we call "future". Hope you guys invented rocket that doesn't need oil soon. He truly believe it will happen 1 day.
Musk should paint the blue Twitter bird on the top of the rocket…just to send a message.
ELON FOR PRESIDENT
Prima
OK than Kew SpaceX
How is the name of the music in the intro? 🤔
Love the "love" for the FAA ... Do you think they believe it?
👍
To anyone who believed it wasn’t possible when it was just a dream, all I can say is “horribly unintelligent”.
Love to see the Launch and Landings.... Makes the Blue Origin Up/Down Very Expensive Amusement Park ride laughable.
you guys make it look so easy very cool!!
Indistinguishable from magic.
Am I the only one going directly to the landing part and skipping the rest?
To think that NO OTHER WORLD GOVERNMENTS space programs are capable of this is simply astonishing, and here is SpaceX performing above all others.
So was stage 1 burning a little dirtier, or did I never notice before?
Beautiful photography today. Loved it. As others note, this never gets "old". Next flight will be the 150th Falcon 9 flight. That is an amazing milestone. Good luck!
Is it crazy that my favourite part is the booster landing?! 🤣
I think I can watch 500 more of these, and still be in awe every time. Always amazing! Fun commentary today too! 😊
Have you noticed that SpaceX stopped cleaning the fairings and boosters from carbon deposits from previous flights!? 😀 And that means they really become workhorses
Trampoline is working just fine. Cannot stop being amazed by every and each SpaceX success. Wish to join the team, but cant even think about this properly, has to bear consequences of putin's war, damn him.. #ArmUkraineNow
Keep nailing those landings and you won't need drone barges anymore. Any helipad will work.
catch up, the world, world need better tech than this, also SpaceX make it better than other colors, may be the bord head will selling the loyalty from or as American to else… watch out the rest, the world getting more dirty with this is come to face. SpaceX go go go
또 쏴??? again???
Обратили внимание на то что, SpaceX перестали отмывать обтекатели и бустеры от нагара с предыдущих полётов!? 😀 А это значит они по настоящему становятся рабочими лошадками
Saw Falcon 9 take off from Vandenberg last Sunday morning. We drove ten hours for ten minutes of show and it was well worth it! If you have an opportunity to watch a launch TAKE IT!
Nice
Congratulations SpaceX team, fantastic views.  Starlink, present day laser love :)   What a wonderful place to be!
Супер! Я можу спостерігати таку красоту тричі на добу! ❤️❤️❤️
Never get bored by this.Never!
12th reflight of the booster?!?!?! amazing work! well done!!!
Bull's eye!  Congrats!
LOVE the look of a reused fairing and booster, it's giving Star Wars gritty vibes
SpaceX Routines!!!
Crazy good!
Rocket nerds
It's quite useful that Bermuda is where it is - just the right place to acquire the signal :)
🖖 Every time is like the first time 😉✌️
Молодці! Дякуємо за допомогу Україні!
Funny how all of these supposed smartest people in the world said up until a couple of years ago that it was impossible to return a rocket and land it and keep reusing it. Just shows the propaganda mindset of people not wanting to try. Just let an entire industry waste away and pay communist our tax dollars to take our astronauts to our international space station. When the Communist didn't even pay for their parts of the station, back before they were sent up United States Corporation such as Pepsi sponsored that's building them for them. And Russia has the nerve act like they did threatening to let this ISS found Earth without their little capsule there to give a little boost once in awhile. Sometimes I wonder if they believe their own propaganda.  Let's light this broomstick!        🍿🍺
12 recovery for this particular booster?? 😯 amazing 👏👏👏
Seems like there will be no accident with Falcon 9
Never get old!!!

The launches don't get old but the commentary does.  We all know what the stages are.  We all know Max Q.  I hate hearing it every single time with an explainer.  lol they have made launches so normal that the commentary is tiresome.
Luv watching these #Broomsticks "stick it" on a floating dot in the middle of the ocean !!
This is incredible. SpaceX launched more than several countries
Thank you, I'll be doing some speed test soon. :)
Хочешь верить в Бога - иди в церковь. Хочешь быть Богом - будь инженером.
When will come in Yemen and the Middle East?
.
thanks for today's flight SpaceX! 🪐
First booster to 12? SO dope!!!!
RIP crush cores 😅
amazing  stuff
How quickly do these satellites come into service after launch?  As a recent Starlink customer, these launches are even more awesome.
I love how they dont even bother to repainting the booster and firings. They are treating falcon 9 like a lorry which totally about function and not fancy.
I know these are real videos but my mind still thinks CGI. Syfy comes to reality.
Everything is ...aaa.... N o m i n a l
Awesome landing footage, again!
lying signs and wonders
Is 414 the number of starlink missions?
Never gets less than wonderful.
Perfect landing again. Good job!
Well done. 💪 Can't wait for moon mission, and mars misson too 😍
This launch stream was about 25 seconds behind mission control audio.
American Broomstick FTW
Just astonishing that they are so good it's almost boring. 12 times has that particular first stage has been reused and landed, this is approaching airline reliability and frequency.
53 more bombs that will seed new life replacing all now for the future
excellent
Elon, our saviour
Wasnt the starship launchdate today?
Made my day
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🚀🚀🚀
Awesome sauce!!!!
18:13 Uninterrupted Droneship feed is <3
That booster looked like it did a hop on Just Read the Instructions
Nice
in awe as always
Meanwhile at Blue Origin…
12 times, wow! Here's to 88 more 🥂
A perfect landing by falcon 9 rocket!
As always,thanks for sharing.🚀🚀🚀👍
*Borat* Very nice!
Fast, safe, and effective. As always!
Amazing how routine these missions are now!
Nailed it. As always.
Oi
Thank you, Daddy Elon
No comments ?
These launches never get old!
